2144873,4,B0002YLCFQ,"I walked into this film not knowing what to expect and I really was surprised how much I enjoyed it. I never  saw Clive Owen in anything before this and I must say he was great as Arthur. He has a strong screen presence that I was surprised by. Kiera Knightly is also really good as Guinevere. Kiera Knightly is gonna be a huge star. I think she was even better here than she was in Pirates of the Carribean. She's believable in tough women roles where she doesn't take crap from anyone. She's also very sensual and sexy, the camera loves her and she can act too. So yes she's going places.
  Sure there has been lots of King Arthur films but most of them focused on the same story. They all had Guinevere fall for Lancelot and vice versa with both of them betraying their loyalty to Arthur. Here you get a fresher Arthur story that was never told before. Lancelot obviously loves Guinevere but she loves Arthur and not him. He knows this and he never gets too close to her. He mostly just steals looks at her. In this film you know Lancelot is too loyal to Arthur to go with his feelings for Guinevere.
  The actors and characters are strong and they help the film be more engaging. The battles are fantastic too.  They're exiting and intense. The battle on ice is cool but in some ways the one in Merlin is better. The battle at the end is the most compelling and totally makes the movie though. The story itself could've used more work but still I admire the film-makers for trying to be original story wise. They could've just gave us the same story we've seen many times before  but they chose otherwise and it worked for me. It's not a fantasy and Merlin isn't this great magical wizard....he's this dirty wise warririor guy that lives in the forest lol. Plus Arthur never goes looking for the Holy Grail. The movie is about love, characters with real emotions, friendship and freedom. It's not a great movie but it's a really good movie and deserved a lot more of an audience than was there when I saw it.",1089158400,6,2012,4.363636363636363
2144874,3,B0002YLCFQ,"Loyalty, Chivalry and Romantic Love are unusual subjects for the powerhouse movie producer, Jerry Bruckheimer whose movies usually have to do with Heroes with bad attitudes and badder guns. And even though the friction between his other films and his reputation for Wham-Bang movies might have made for an interesting re-telling of the King Arthur legend, ""Arthur"" is not.
The King Arthur of Clive Owen is like no other seen on the screen before. His Arthur is no romantic poet as in ""Camelot"" nor is there a Round Table or Sword in the Stone in sight. Owen's Arthur is deeply troubled and gravely concerned about the Roman conquest of his country, Britain. His Arthur manages to be heroic which is a major accomplishment what with all the silliness that surrounds him, mise-en-scene wise.
Keira Knightly has the right attitude for this film in that she plays her role of Guinevere with her tongue firmly planted in her beautiful cheek especially when she turns from a Lady to a harridan with a bow in artfully applied blue make-up.
Don't go to ""Arthur"" looking for a reverential bow to Ladies and Knights of the Round Table but if you are a fan of the Bruckheimer treatment, you could do far worse than what is on screen here.",1089158400,,1227,4.711627906976744

2144878,5,B0002YLCFQ,"The DVD King Arthur - HIGHLY RECOMMEND if you're open to an different telling of a this iconic legend. Initially, the audio was horrid; but, it wasn't the DVD, it was my laptop's settings. Kudos to the director - stunning scenery, loved the costumes & make-up. Was particularly impressed by the attention to detail, i.e. the use of tattoos, which were an important part of various groups of peoples at that time, characters who were filthy - bathing wasn't common back then except in Roman society & other ""more"" civilized cultures. Although how common this really was, some characters had empathy toward those of other faiths & for the less fortunate. Christianity was shown as not being particularly kind although some individuals were. In violent scenes blood spattered, heads were cut off, etc. BUT it wasn't anywhere near as graphic as in other movies. It entertained me & I enjoyed it . I've been a King Arthur fan ever since my dad introduced me to the classic tale when I was in early grade school. He collected the different telling of the story, which my younger sister & I eagerly devoured as we grew up.  This movie is just one of many different takes on that legend.  [I'm trying to find the one where Arthur & Modred are actually great friends but wanting to be remembered down through time & realizing they have to present themselves as being mortal enemies in order for this to work because people tend to remember the stories with glorious tragic endings - not stories of peace & contentment. If anyone knows the title of that book, please let me know!]",1514592000,,1570,4.684782608695652

2144913,4,B0002YLCFQ,As such movies go it was pretty good. A fair amount of action stabbings blood and guts you know the normal things you want in this kind of a film. The film went with the promise that the Western Roman Empire was still around in the mid 6 century and Arthur was some kind of military commander for them when the Western Empire dissolved. Of course we know from history the Western Empire was gone long before the mid 6 century. But other than that it's interesting period drama.,1488672000,,477,4.370786516853933

I love a good story, but the story of Arthur isn't really told here. Kiera Knightly is dressed like a dancer on IN LIVING COLOR for no particular reason other than add a bit of pretty flesh to a film ripe in the slashing of flesh. If you wish to know the Arthur legends, learn how to read. For those who just like blood, gore and gratuitous macho crap, buy it. You can pretend they have guns and motorcycles instead of swords and horses.",1457222400,3,629,4.575221238938053
2144962,5,B0002YLCFQ,"Good movie, great action, not completely accurate, but a fun ride nonetheless.

Tons of people have already reviewed this film, so I won't go into the plot. But suffice to say, this is a great action film that's often overlooked. If you're looking for a well crafted, medieval tale, with plenty of war scenes, this is the film for you. It's not your typical King Arthur story. Rather, it's more down to earth with a modern flare. Perhaps a bit dark.

The only recommendation I can make is, watch the Director's Cut. I've seen both versions of the film. However, I viewed the Director's Cut first. Then later, when I watched the theatrical version, I noticed several of the best scenes missing. For me, those scenes made the film, so I went out and purchased the Director's Cut at a used DVD store.

In conclusion, you can't go wrong with King Arthur, especially if you like films like Gladiator, Braveheart or Troy. Only King Author is very sparing in the romance department, which turns out to be a good thing in this case.

2144972,1,B0002YLCFQ,"By itself, the 2004 production of ""King Arthur"" is a middlin' costume pot-boiler yarn that obviously seeks to capitalize on the name of a legendary hero to get the audience to the box office.  It's quite reminiscent of the sword-and-sandals beefcake flicks that snitch names from ancient Greek mythology, with strident anti-Catholic hate messages and a bit of politically correct silliness layered on.

I would have give it a 3-star rating, maybe even 4, until I read the review by John Matthews, the movie's historical advisor, trying to claim that the story is historically accurate.  That absurdity is based on the fact that about 50 years ago, someone noticed that the name of an insignificant Roman army squad leader posted near Hadrian's Wall, Lucius Artorius Castus, had a middle name that sounded a little bit like ""Arthur.""  Historical revisionism is beneath contempt, and so flushes this thing down into the cesspit of deplorable Hollywood dreck.",1451088000,2,956,5.148387096774194

2144983,5,B0002YLCFQ,"When I first watched this movie I did not like it.  I am of the classical school of mythical tales and I thought that EXCALIBUR was the  ultimate
Arthur movie.  And I still think that, but after watching this again on my DVD I changed my mind about this one.  I guess it was trying to make a more
realistic telling of the mythical King and his boys.  Well, while much of this film is still fanciful and likely fictional, it is more gritty and bloody than
some similar films, and probably more accurately show how the ancient Brits fought the invading Anglos and Irish people.  They probably fought
in Roman style uniforms and spoke latin; Britain was heavily Romanized at the time.  Arthur may in fact be based on a Roman Brit named
Ambrosius who was a historical character.  But there is an inscription that does mention a man named Arthur so who knows.  Whether Merlin and
the other knights existed we probably will never know.  But it is believed by some scientists  that Camelot did actually exist but in what manner is
unknown.  This movie combines realism and perhaps some accurate speculations and I find this movie very enjoyable now.  I do recommend it
to those who find early British legends an myths fascinating. FIVE STARS for good story telling and production quality. I got my DVD from Amazon.

2145021,5,B0002YLCFQ,great movie,1433635200,,11,5.0
2145022,1,B0002YLCFQ,"As an action film, it's overlong and average. But as a pretentious self-proclaimed tale of the ""historical facts"" behind King Arthur's legend, it's utterly absurd. The fact that ""King Arthur"" (2004) was a runaway blockbuster hit is a testimony to the triumph of Hollywood marketing more than to the quality of the actual movie.

There are nevertheless some good elements. A good cast with Clive Owen as Arthur and Kiera Knightly as Guinevere combines with an intriguing premise that combines Arthurian legend with the Battle of Mount Badon. Here we see Arthur and his knights as Sarmatian heavy calvalry serving the Roman army as it withdraws from Britain toward the end of the 5th century. Production values are very high here, particularly in the film's large-scale fight scenes which include a battle on a frozen lake.

On the negative side, historical inaccuracies are too numerous to count. To cite one example, Arthur is presented as a follower of Pelagius, a Roman priest condemned by the early church. Pelagius, who taught that one could earn salvation through good works, was nevertheless an influential theologian who typified the excesses of Catholic doctrine on grace for Martin Luther in 16th century. But in this movie, he's presented as being condemned by Rome for teaching ""free will and equality"" between all men. For Luther, Pelagius represented the height of Christian elitism, but for this movie's screenwriter he is a populist hero who inspires King Arthur. Very strange.

Another weakness of this film is how it portrays every pagan character as noble and every Christian character as a snarling fanatic. The anti-Christian bias of the movie, encompassing Roman-British Christians who torture and enslave Christians to the disgust of the Christian Arthur and his pagan knights, is painfully embarrassing. Arthur, quite literally the only sympathetic Christian in the film, rejects his church and orders the death of wicked priests. For nasty caricatures of Catholics, this movie ranks right up there with the evil Jesuit ""hit man"" who tried to assassinate Cate Blanchett in ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" (2007). Christians, but also all viewers with any sensitivity or appreciation for nuance, will want to stay far away from this movie.

Other than historical inaccuracy and anti-Christian bias, though, the biggest letdown of ""King Arthur"" is that it's overlong (125 minutes) and features an incoherent script that alternates boring dialogue with rousing battles. But even the vaunted CGI effects, state of the art in 2004, feel cheesy and dated in 2015. This film, despite raking in money against weak competitors during its theatrical run, does not hold up so well today. Not a single moment in the film stays with you very long. ""King Arthur"" is hardly as memorable or iconic as, say, the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise from the same decade.

This disc has a few making-of features and an alternate ending -- the latter always a sure sign of compromised vision and mediocrity. It's full-screen (there appears to be no widescreen DVD of the original theatrical cut available) and rated PG-13. There's also an R-rated director's cut of the film floating around on DVD, which I haven't seen. Like Oliver Stone's ""Alexander"" and Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner,"" both of which have endured multiple director's cuts, this film is a hot mess of eye candy that never quite knows what to do with itself.

For a more fun and pulpy take on Rome's withdraw from Britain, I recommend ""The Last Legion"" (2007) with Colin Firth and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. Ben Kingsley is also in that one and it also tries to make a connection to Arthurian legend, sans any reference to Christianity. That one is a pretty cool little movie. The bloated ""King Arthur,"" by contrast, is for the birds.",1433030400,2,3796,5.075320512820513
2145023,4,B0002YLCFQ,"2004's ""King Arthur"" staring Clive Owen was a fairly decent action adventure- historically themed movie for it's time.  I did like the premise regarding King Arthur's true or more accurate origin (if the man lived at all which I believe very much so that he had lived).

 For ""King Arthur"" fans, the ideal notion that he had been a Roman soldier abandoned in Britain on an outpost close to Hadrian's Wall is historically very acceptable to me.  Previously with television shows and films such as the 80';s ""Excalibur"" (which was an excellent film and much better then this movie) Arthur had been depicted soully as an Englishman alone where his ethnic and national origin where never even considered as if the Roman Empire had no influence at all on Britain which is absurd if one thinks about it in more detail.

 We do get some good detailed action scenes, the bad guys are in the form of the Saxon invaders and as movie bad guys go they are portrayed well as true villains.

 However I did not like the way Christianity had been portrayed in the film, it struck me that the film makers took their modern opinions or viewpoints and pushed them onto the movie which is never appropriate nor good for any movie that depicts world history.

The Guenevere character from what I gathered seemed to reflect modern Feminist views much more then the actions or behaviors of what a young woman would have portrayed who actually lived during that time in ""Merrry Old Enlgand"".  I don't have a problem with making her strong character because I do concur in much older tv and movie media, women have been portrayed as either helpless victims in need of rescue or as sexual objects (exploitation themed) that had to be obtained by the male characters, and maybe modern film makers want a more honest and fair portrayal of women characters (which is what I personally would have done).  However with that stated, making her a hard lined Celtic Warrior was way over the top and a bit much, which made some aspects of the film seem way too far fetched.

 Then we get to the Merlin character, one of the most important in all Arthuerian media, and he is reduced to some primative tribal elder woodsman.

 There really is no strong romantic element between Clive Owen and Guenevere, nor is there any love triangle at all with Sir Lancelot's character.  Lancelot plays more of the buddy Knight role.

 Ultimately we get to the prime message of the movie, in that the freedom and the maintanence of a just civlization domestically do not come free.  The price of freedom is paid for by warriors, such as the heroes depicted in the film, with their bold actions and the sheding of their blood.  Unfortunately most who see this film will not get that message.  Owen's King Arthur has to not only find a way to survive in this abandoned land with out Rome's aid, but also obtain some form of order in the Britian he lives in, on top of on a strategic level find a military order of battle that can bring about the survival of both him and the people around him.

 So in those regards I do give the movie four stars with a B- grade, but as for material regarding the ""King Arthur"" franchise realm I highly recommend the Starz series featuring actress Eva Green titled ""Camelot"", along with the 80's movie ""Excalibur"", and maybe the 90's lighter film with Sean Connery ""First Knight"" over this particular movie.

 If anything, there needs to be another ""King Arthur"" movie that has no hidden agenda other then telling the tale of the hero with the most accurate historical means availible.  In all honesty, I do believe the real Arthur had been an abandoned Roman Soldier and more then likely with the tools and men availible to him at the time, he would have had to build a co-elition of sorts with other tribes to defend Britain from ____ fill in the blank hostile invasion force.",1433030400,,3860,4.598540145985401
2145024,4,B0002YLCFQ,"This movie suffers every time Clive Owen opens his mouth.  I like this movie.  I own it and have watched it more than once because of the great action.  I am writing this review 10 years after the film was released to get this off my chest.  The dialog handed to Clive Owen is ponderous, unbelievable and over the top.  The most embarrassing moment in the film is when Arthur (Owen) is giving his little Braveheart  pep talk to his knights just before the ride into battle for the last time.  He talks like he is giving a pre-battle speech to a thousand warriors.  He is talking to six guys for heaven's sake.  Second, on the cring from embarrassment scale is his reaction after the battle when a few of his knights are killed.  ""It was to have been me"", he complains to God.  ""I have failed you,"" he says to one dead knight.  Owen apparently thought when he gave that over the top performance that there is not a dry eye in the theater.  Actually, what the viewer is thinking is, ""Thank God for the fast forward feature on my Blu-Ray.""",1432166400,,1036,4.333333333333333

2145052,4,B0002YLCFQ,"I heard bad things about this movie, so I avoided it.  I watched it for the first time last week.  I left a string of two star reviews so I racked my brain  for something I recently watched that I really liked...

They're striving with authenticity in costumes and they mention Adrian's Wall, and there's people covered in wode who kinda remind me of smurfs...  My only knowledge of history comes from stuff I overheard from the history channel and my memory of Braveheart... Well, actually I did take a history course once and we had to read Le Morte D'Arthur and something by Tennyson.  The instructor seemed to get off on saying how awful knights and noblemen were to peasants and women.  I was expecting castles and maces and maybe myths of dragons, but I got a f--n ASPCA commercial instead.  So in short.. Historical Accuracy is not something I give two sh--ts  about.  It looked and felt authentic enough, to a person of my lowly standards, though the chronology seemed a bit off.  But people who know about this time period will probably have a richer experience with the movie than me.  I'm guessing they had composite bows which is why the arrows went further than the saxon ones?

I liked the story a helluva lot.  I like stories where there's ambiguity in what's right and wrong, like Kingdom of Heaven.  In addition, I have a similar view as  the filmmakers to Romans, The Church, Saxons (vikings) and Britons (woad warriors under Merlin's command).  I've found so much of people's enjoyment of a film is dependent upon whether they agree with the director/ screenwriter's worldview, so I'll say that I'm a cynic who sees corruption where others are moved to tears of  hope.  I suspect many people will see the film as a downer.  I thought Kiera Knightly was weirdly flirtatious in this and it was friggin' odd.  I also got annoyed at all the speeches about Freedom and other bs, but I think others like that kind of stuff.  It's a very brutal film.",1425513600,,1962,4.593659942363113

2145063,4,B0002YLCFQ,"I'm not going to base my review on any historical accuracy or, for that matter, inaccuracy.  This is just about the entertainment factor.

Clive Owen seemed comfortable in his role of the Rus, Arthur, knight of the Roman Empire and, while not specifically said, Catholic Church.

Ray Stevenson, widely known as Titus Pullo from the Rome series, easily slipped back into character, albeit a much more mellow character then before.

Keira Knightly of the Pirates of the Caribbean series wasn't all that far from that role either.  Her acting was nice and definitely not overboard.

Storywise, this was an entertaining two hours but not so that it held my complete attention.  I managed to snack liberally, review a few other movies and CDs.  Okay, the knights had been told that they had ""one more mission"" before they are released from their contract.  Sure... Typical military, one more turned one more plus one more.  The poor guys had no choice but to go out and fight two more missions.  Of course, the first mission was done with no problem and the second, well, that's the one that wipes out most of the platoon.

When all's said and done, it was a decent enough movie with Arthur uniting the country.  And. There's a very nice soundtrack thank to Maire Brennon, sister of the well known Enya.",1423267200,2,1298,4.741071428571429

The plot was wanting, the inclusion of this pictish, Celt woman archer bad ass character was a little lame. I don't know. Just not a fan.

2145109,5,B0002YLCFQ,"This film tries to understand Arthur as he is thought to have been historically--a Brit trained by the Romans shortly before they leave Britain.

2145111,5,B0002YLCFQ,"I love the film's more historically-centered take on the Arthur legend.  Tales of the Arthurian histories have dated back over a millennium and our culture's most recent cinematic adaptation is a testament to society's need for the ""Essence of Arthur"" to endure; a person of nobility who fights not only for what he believes in but for justice.  The Once and Future King often discusses the conflict of Might and Right, and the film symbolizes this quite well.  Taking historical revelations and documentations into account, the production depicts a fiction rooted in the history era of its setting.  With great acting, a beautiful setting, and an important message about what freedom is versus what freedom is perceived to be, King Arthur can stand up next to such a work as Excalibur, exploring Arthur as he could possibly have been rather than what we, the audience, perceive him or want him to be.

Note to Amazon.com - the description of the film on Instant Video describes Arthur as a ""Russian soldier"".  You need to change that to ""Roman soldier"".",1412726400,3,1054,4.893258426966292

I can accept this idea a lot better than Guinivere being an adulterous woman who marries a King, then has an affair with his best friend leading to the downfall of the mythical Camelot.  I don't like stories that beatify the male and place all the blame on the woman - like the male bears absolutely no responsibility in the realities of life?  I don't think so - it still take 2 to tango.  Anyways, perceptions aside, do check out the movie and decide for yourself.  Personally, I prefer the Director's Cut where some little clips remain that give the story a few added tweeks.",1403654400,4,824,4.453333333333333

There were many tribes that came and went ruling different parts of Europe in those early years.  But that part of the world did not become Russia.  There is more evidence of Ukraine being settled by Germanic - Viking- Scandinavian presence.  The word Rus stems from a Finnish word for Swedes. I found myself confused by the use of the word ""Rus"" yelled out in the movie and proceeded to look this up.

In the film he fights Picts, instead of the usual Saxons of more traditional stories. I like the assertive role of Guinevere as portrayed by Keira Knightley, she showing more fierce warrior spirit than many of the men. The battle on the frozen lake is the highlight of the film. I also admire Arthur's sense of justice in cleaning out corrupt Roman overlords who were trying to exploit and enslave the locals. He is like a sheriff  cleaning up the country and only later establishes a kingdom. A good film, though not to be mistaken for history, for it is not historical.

2145191,2,B0002YLCFQ,"I've read King Arthur, and yes, I know that most of it is myth and legend, but this movie is NOT King Arthur! The good parts of this movie are: The Medieval weaponry was meticulous and interesting. The battle scenes are epic but extremely gory. Blood sprays, heads fly. don't watch it before bed. The bad things...As I mentioned the battle scenes are pretty darn intense, unless you don't mind seeing peoples heads getting hacked off their spine. Although modern research suggests that if King Arthur really lived, he would have lived in the Roman era, I guess I like the Medieval picture. The knights (if you can even call them that,) look like barbarians. No sooner does the chivalrous Sir Bors come home, that his wife gives him a sharp slap on the face! The chivalry  of these knights is all but gone. Arthur lets Guenivere in the battle! This aspect takes away an entire star. She is dressed in an armored bikini; something that the real King Arthur would have thrown up at if he had seen it. Most of the movie takes place during a cold snow. None of the actors show one bit of cold discomfort. Guenevere had bare arms! The knights look there most Medieval when the knights go against the bloodthirsty Saxons. They have the gorgeous armored horses and have Medieval garb. During the climax two bad things happened. First when Arthur goes head to head with the Saxons commanders, as soon as Arthur's sword plunges into him, and he dies, the battle is instantly over. Huh? Not to realistic. The crummiest detail is where Lancelot dies! this movie was, overall a mediocre movie that took WAY to many liberties.",1391126400,,1612,4.636363636363637

2145196,5,B0002YLCFQ,"This is one of my favorite movies.  Now, the Y DNA makes it look as if my own male line ancestors were quite possibly Germanic soldiers with an auxilliary unit in Roman Britain - though from western Germany/ Frisia.  The experience of those soldiers must have been pretty universal no matter where they were from.

It is also a very good King Arthur story.  All good King Arthur stories are about the formation of England at the time when the Romans left.  There must be a half dozen equally valid theories.  I think that that musical/ movie in the 60's was about the last time anyone wanted to hear a version of the story where mythical high-medieval characters just inexplicably appear in the story.

My father's direct line were immediately from Scotland, and this could be pinned down only by his Y DNA.  I truly love the Exile song.  The producer ate this song (they refuse to release it); however, there are some truly excellent renditions of it on You Tube, and one of them features scenery of Scotland.",1388966400,,1010,4.597765363128492

2145202,2,B0002YLCFQ,"This movie had so much wrong with it, it is hard to know where to start. Still It had it's good points, and if you can put aside the terrible story line, lack of historical accuracy and lack of anything relating to the Arthur of legend it can be watchable. Or not. If you are just watching it for eye candy, the production values are quite good. And many of the supporting roles are amply cast and well played (such as Stellan Skarsgard, king of the Saxons). But the main characters were terribly cast. Knightley was probobly the best of the three main characters. I like Clive Owen and Ioan Gufford but neither of them are believable as tough guys, and these guys were supposed to have been among the toughest.

That was enough to ruin it for me, but they also had help from a terrible script, ripe with repetative and cliche lines. Historically speaking, it seems to me that locating a guy named Articus, who was a Roman, and supposing this was the Arthur of legend is a good stretch at best. As for the legend, there is no resemlbance except for the names. We will forget the fact that if these 'wariors' were centurions they probobly would have spoken latin. To be fair, there are aspects of the film which are acurate, and others that are believable, but mostly just a muddled pile of scenes, that on the whole, is indeciferable as a coherent story.

I guess the most bothersome of the verbal claptrap are the oft repeated cries for freedom. They are fighting for Rome's dominance over a conquered land that is slipping away. Yet they consistantly yell cries of freedom. Backwords to be sure. It is really beyond comprehesion how anyone with a modicum of sense can buy into this thing. I give one star because it is perfunctury and one star for the production values.

2145216,5,B0002YLCFQ,"This isn't the Camelot King Arthur, and even though there's a Merlin in
the story, he isn't a sorcerer. This is a gritty, earthy Arthur--but he
does have his knights and a round table. Also Guinevere, but she's a
fighter rather than an adulterous damsel. In fact, the whole saga precedes
the Matter of Arthur as elucidated by everyone from Thomas Malory to John
Steinbeck. Instead, it's about what happens when Rome abandons Britain just
as the invading Saxons threaten to wreck the place: a good guys vs. bad guys
western set in the dark ages. NO SPOILER: There's one big set piece that occurs on
a frozen lake, and as the good guys travel across it with their laden wagons
and horses, you really worry if the ice will give. The bad guys are supposedly
coming just behind them, too. And then something really does happen. I thought
that sequence the most suspenseful and exciting in the whole film.",1380326400,,899,4.625
2145217,4,B0002YLCFQ,"This is basically a very great film and Fuqua is a super director.  My critique here is directed towards the technical aspect of THIS version.  I originally had the theatrical which came from FILM on DVD.  This Director's cut seems to come from the HD Edited Original as this is obviously NOT shot on film and on an HD aspect it looks a little video and not film.  You can see pixilation and contrast on long shots of people.  You can see mixed contrast in many shots, especially the lighting on people and things.  Even if this is from a 24 frame video it does not look like film.  It's half film and half video.  Personally I find video hard to look at.  It looks somehow phony.  I'm just pointing this out to you.  Video is a soap opera, game show or nightly news.  Film is prime time TV and movies.  This is still a great film but you can almost see the original video that was shot and if this was put to Blue Ray it would look like it was shot on VIDEO.  Video has less contrast than film.  Film swirls while video doesn't.  This is still a great film, but if you object to video artifacts you might want to seek out the FILM based original version in DVD, possibly even Blue Ray.  So far I haven't seen anything ""super additional"" in the Director's cut than was in the theatrical.  Again, I'm not putting down the film or Fuqua, this has to do with VIDEO artifacts visible on the screen VS FILM artifacts.  If video artifacts don't bother you, this is a great value.",1380153600,,1473,4.252707581227437

 At the time I didn't even know who Clive Owen was.
Also 2 of the characters in this movie appear in the 2013 TV series Hannibal.
 The movies great and I didn't realize the Saxons were even more ruthless than the Vikings.
This movie is Definately worth watching.

I enjoyed the battle scenes, the relationships between the knights and the villain was everything a villain should be. Most of the time the villains are overplayed but not in this. I watch a lot of films of all genres but I rarely write a review and am usually very selective. I liked Kiera's strong warrior Guinevere a lot. Good battle scenes and loads of action.

2145239,5,B0002YLCFQ,"This is a lush saturated piece of cinematography so the eye candy is definitely there. The story is more toward what is now believed to be the truth behind Arthur - which is that he was a Celtic figure long before the Romans and Saxons invaded and Britain was a Celtic Nation. This movie didn't follow that specifically but got allot closer to that time frame than any previous telling of this story that I have seen. Kira is great, Clive is very good and the Roman characters are believably despicable invaders.",1369872000,,512,4.576086956521739

Clive Owen made a terrible Arthur, mumbling his way through the whole movie...  The battle scenes were entertaining.  And the Painted Savages north of Hadrian's Wall were kind of cool.  All in all though... A rather stupid retelling of the Aurthur legend...  Worth missing.",1369785600,,424,5.072463768115942

2145244,5,B0002YLCFQ,this was another great telling of authurian legend i liked it because it paid more homage to the knights than the would king arthur because it also gives us a small look at how great the thrist for power that rome had and how far the romans would go for power and the taking of what ever it set its eyes apon this was rome this was how it was done the weak obey the strong or be distroyed its not far from that thinking all over the world even today we might not have slave laborers anymore but we still enslave others thru out this world who are weaker and have n one to defend them this is still going on down to this very day and not just in rome.,1369440000,,650,3.9318181818181817

Terrible dialogue interspersed with ridiculous monologues meant to, well, I'm not quite sure what the point was of much of what was said on screen. I understand the license taken with the historical references but some things were so egregious it was hard to focus on what was happening.
  The battle scenes were offensively stupid. Here's a few tips for an attacking army:
  If someone is shooting arrows at you, hold your shield UP.
  If you and 200 men are crossing a frozen lake, maybe don't walk in a bunch?
  Try not to send your men into combat one at a time. Very easy to die that way.
  The one good thing was the wardrobe. That stuff was awesome. The armor, weapons and other gear were pretty realistic.
  Again, the dialog was AWFUL!!!!! I can't emphasize how ridiculous and predictable it was. Even the battle scenes were often rip-offs out of some movies that were actually good. I think the best overall description would be Monty Pythons Holy Grail, minus the humor.....",1363651200,8,1088,4.580310880829016

I have a particular interest in Scythians and Sarmatians--of whom we know too little and see even less of in popular culture. I wish the Sarmatian storyline would have been slightly more developed with some insight into the characters' backgrounds and the concept of freedom and equality found in their society and within their legends--out of which the story of the round table supposedly grew when the Sarmatians were seconded to Hadrian's wall. Instead, the concept of freedom was attributed to half Roman Arthur's favorite philosopher, Pelagius, in the movie.

I am not worried about the historical implications; I wasn't watching the movie for that reason. I just enjoyed it as a story and it was great. If you are looking for the true story of Arthur you probably won't be really happy with this movie. But if you can put aside your preconceived thoughts about what it should be about and just watch it as a new story it is enjoyable. There is a lot of action and fighting so you have to be into that kind of movie. I have had friends watch it and they found it to have too much fighting and lacking in the plot behind the fighting.

My favorite thing about Arthur is that he isn't a leader simply by luck but because he thinks about each move he makes. Arthur is a man that is loyal to his beliefs - even when his men dismiss those beliefs and that he is just as loyal to his men.

2145355,5,B0002YLCFQ,"Not being an historian, I cannot criticize those reviews that argue about whoever Arthur really was. My feeling is, it just doesn't matter and as far as I am concerned let him remain a legend and if he's half Roman half something else does it really make any difference? This Arthur is a long way from Tennyson's Arthur in ""Idylls of the King"" which I adored as a teenager and still do. But a legend can assume any shape or form, and this rendition of Arthur as an early fighter for freedom of the individual man should be accepted along with all the other renditions.

Guinivere as an archer along side Arthur in the thick of battle, yelling war-cries like everybody else, friend or foe, in definitely out of the box and I loved her! There are touching moments-scenes that will grab at your heart, such as Bors' wife singing a ballad to their baby. One scene I would have made more of is the boy Arthur's pulling the sword Excalibur out of a stone. But by and large you as viewer will go with the flow and have no difficulty emerging yourself into the plot, you are there.

The photography is so extraordinary one should see this film on that basis alone. The film was shot in Ireland. In the winter the snowflakes come down rather lazily but soon the ground is covered. You watch those snowflakes settle in the horses' manes, in the hair of the men. The Saxons and Arthur's tiny band approach eachother over a river of ice which splinters under their weight and sends up great gushes of frigid water. The special effects here are simply superb as the men and horses struggle to keep from being sucked into the water. There are many other marvelously crafted scenes in the film, such as catapults that send torches of fire into the enemy lines.

Cerdic, the Saxon chieftan, played by Stellar Skarsgard, almost steals the show. The portrayal is close to being hammy but Stellar has a grand time looming large ahead of his army and given to expressive, emotional glances to his men as well as enemy Arthur. Of course, Guinivere in the thick of battle with no armor to protect her is a bit ridiculous, but it doesn't matter. ""King Arthur"" is intense, thrilling, heroic!

2145356,2,B0002YLCFQ,"Touted as ""the story of the real King Arthur,"" this confused wannabe epic is anything but. Rife with sloppy historical and geographical inaccuracies, confused narrative and inane, anachronistic dialogue, this is Jerry Bruckheimer at his bombastically air-headed, self-indulgent worst. Pros and high points: excellent cinematography, an imaginativly choreographed battle on a frozen lake, and the lovely Kyra Knightley as a butt-kicking Xena-esque warrior princess in a leather battle brassiere! Cons and low-points: pretty much everything else, especially the scene where Clive Owen as Arthur tries to rouse his troops a la William Wallace in ""Braveheart,"" except that he's riding back and forth in front of only five or six guys, which, somehow, just doesn't seem to work quite so well in long panning shots. If the writers had done just a little homework they might have succeeded in making this halfway historically passable; as it is, set in AD 490, some seventy years after the Romans bugged out, and at least ten years before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the timeline is hoplessly off. Arthur is portrayed as a disciple of Pelagius, who had already been condemned as a heretic nearly a century earlier. You can look this stuff up, for crying out loud! We won't even get into the downright IDIOTIC geographical problems. Except for the delightful eye-candy provided by Ms. Knightley, this is an epic waste of time.",1342742400,2,1429,5.217391304347826

Even loved the cold-blooded Saxon king, absolutely lacking in mercy and a great villain.

My favorite scene is the battle on the frozen lake. Wonderful shots of cracking ice, brave knights, Saxons falling beneath the ice.

2145373,4,B0002YLCFQ,"King Arthur is definitely an action film.  An action film with a bit of romance, a smattering of comedy, and a whole lot of drama, yes, but an action film nonetheless. I wasn't quite expecting that, but came out liking it: from the moment the movie starts until the credit rolls, there is barely a break in the battle scenes or the intense moments where characters are running or fighting for their lives and their respective countries. Reminiscent of Braveheart in many ways, this film is worth the watch if only to consider the story of King Arthur from a new angle: with a realistic slant rather than as a mystical fairy tale legend.

In the early Dark Ages, a band of Sarmatian knights led by half British, half Roman Lucius Artorius Castus or Arthur (Clive Owen) meet with Roman Bishop Germanius to receive their release papers after 15 years of forced service in the Roman army. They are (understandably) upset to discover that they must forego their freedom awhile longer: Rome has decided to pull out of defeating/defending the island, leaving the country and its natives vulnerable to an invasion by the Saxons. Arthur and his knights are sent on one last most dangerous of all suicide mission: to rescue a Roman family from the bloodthirsty Saxons by crossing through the perilous Woads territory (enemy natives led by mystical woodsman Merlin) and bringing them back to safety. Only when they succeed in this trial will Arthur and his knights be given their papers and allowed to return home as free men.

The honorable Arthur must do a little convincing to get his knights to agree to this last most perilous mission: after all, this band of real men is weary of fighting and ready to return home. Soon his loyal yet rough-and-tumble knights agree, and Arthur and his band (including Lancelot played by Ioan Gruffud and Galahad played by Hugh Dancy) begin their perilous journey across Britain. Along the way they encounter Merlin and his crew, who for some unknown reason let them live and pass through the haunted forest alive. After rescuing the Roman family (along with some natives in dire need), Arthur and his knights are forced to turn and fight the Saxons (who outnumber them by the handful!).They are helped by a native warrior woman Guinevere (Kiera Knightley), who ends up forcing a confrontation between Merlin and Arthur. Arthur is finally faced with the choice to return to Rome or stay and fight for Britain alongside Merlin and the lovely Guinevere.

The overall tone and feel of this film is dark, with lots of smoke and fog used in the battle scenes: although this film centers around battles and fight scenes, there is an underlying storyline that makes it entrancing and interesting. The knights are not larger-than-life heroes, chivalrous and pure legend not reality: they are real men. You cant help but cheer for Arthur and his knights as they fight against the odds to defeat the enemies of Britain and gain their own release: but when the time comes for this band of men to go home, will they go or will they stay?

For me, the new setting for the King Arthur story and the realism made for a great story. Clive Owen did a phenomenal job as King Arthur and has gained respect in my eyes: Kiera Knightley was great, as always, as the Britain-warrior-woman Guinevere (although a completely different aspect of this legendary character, it never was so over the top as to annoy me), and Ioan Gruffud as Lancelot and Hugh Dancy as Galahad were wonderful as well: in fact, I think all the actors did a good job. If you like the story of King Arthur, you will like this: from the beginning to the end, you are taken on a real-life adventure with King Arthur and the knights of the round table.",1332892800,6,3725,4.698315467075038
2145374,4,B0002YLCFQ,"King Arthur - The Director's Cut (Widescreen, 2004). Runtime: 142 minutes.

""King Arthur"" sheds the legend and theorizes the true story of the British leader of the late 5th and early 6th centuries, who led the defense of Britain against Germanic invaders (the Saxons) in the early 6th century as the Roman Empire was crumbling.

This is Medieval-British Isle flick in the tradition of the three 1995 films ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Braveheart/dp/B00003CX95/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Braveheart</a>,"" ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rob-Roy/dp/079283366X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rob Roy</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/First-Knight/dp/0800141601/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">First Knight</a>,"" as well as 2006's totally underrated ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tristan-and-Isolde-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000EPFCPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tristan and Isolde (Widescreen Edition)</a>,"" which I feel is the best of the batch.

""King Arthur"" is my second favorite, followed by the underated ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Centurion/dp/B00406UK7S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Centurion</a>"" from 2010. ""King Arthur"" is visually gorgeous, shot mainly in Ireland, but also Wales and England. It has a good assortment of actors, including Clive Owen as Arthur, Ioan Gruffudd as Lancelot, Keira Knightley as Guinevere, Ray Winstone as Bors, Stephen Dillane as Merlin and an outstanding performance by Stellan Skarsgrd as the Saxon villain, Cerdic. Although I'm not a huge fan of Keira she certainly has a striking face, utilized to great effect in this film, and she looks awesome as a blue-painted Pictish warrior (i.e. a ""Woad"").

The soundtrack is good and is sometimes reminiscent of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-of-the-Mohicans/dp/B000A2WP7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last of the Mohicans</a>"" (1992), but blander and nowhere near as overpowering.

The theme here, other than duty and war, is that of finding one's true home and calling. Many of us dream of ""home"" as some far-off place to find in the near or far future, but home may be closer than we think. We just need to be open and open our eyes. This reminds me of this story of a Texas minister who wanted to move to a place with small lakes & springs, etc. and the LORD told him it was ALREADY there on his property, he just had to use his imagination and create it. So he made some small lakes on his property with seven springs, as well as other modifications. Later, when his father was visiting, the subject of vacationing came up. His dad confessed that he enjoyed coming to his son's house rather than traveling elsewhere because it was so beautiful and peaceful that it felt like paradise. The minister learned a lesson: You might be sitting on your paradise (or ""home"") and just don't realize it. In short, quit looking for the greener grass somewhere else and simply open your eyes!

FINAL WORD: I put off seeing ""King Arthur"" all these years for no particular reason and, after finally viewing it, I must say it's much different than what I expected. I expected another take on the legend like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/First-Knight/dp/0800141601/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">First Knight</a>"" or ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Excalibur/dp/6305558167/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Excalibur</a>"" (not that those two films are in any way interchangeable), but ""King Arthur"" is totally different. It's got a unique story, full of savage Medieval action, but it also possesses an undeniable air of beauty and reverence with quite a few epic/dramatic moments.

2145378,5,B0002YLCFQ,"King Arthur is a great movie, and the extended edition is a great edition to the library of an Arthurian legend buff. But this isn't history, neither is Arthurian legend for that matter. This is closer to the true story than most versions. For anyone who cares, here's a cliff notes version of the Roman withdrawal from Britain.

In the first century the Roman Empire conquered and subjugated all of southern Britain, but as they pushed north of modern day York they began to encounter unusually heavy resistance from a tribe known as the Picts. Every push north into Pictish territory met with heavy losses, which the Empire had difficulty sustaining so far from Rome. By the beginning of Hadrian's reign, the conquest of northern Britain had stalled into stalemate. The last straw was the destruction of the 9th legion, the most victorious legion in Rome's history. Ironically the 9th was sent north on a punitive/rescue mission after Pict raiders burned a frontier fort and the surrounding village, and took several Roman and Roman British hostages. Following the 9th's ""disappearance"", Hadrian order all aggressive action in Britain to halt, and ordered the legions in Britain to construct his wall, to keep the Picts out.

Now fast forward to the late 4th century, just after the Visigoths sacked Rome, the first time a non-Roman force had done so in about a thousand years. The Western Empire is an extreme state of disrepair, the product of political corruption, poor leadership, and endless raids from barbarian tribes. As a matter of strategic necessity, Rome began to abandon it's outermost holdings. At the close of the 5th, the phased withdrawal from Britain was well underway. As the legions were being recalled, the heavily Romanized Britons were simply abandoned. Without the legions to hold them back, Pict and Irish raiders had a field day, attacking every chance they got.

The Britons hadn't had to defend themselves in 400+ years, and decided on a very Roman solution, hiring barbarian mercenaries. Now enters a man whose name should be synonymous with blunder, Vortigern. He was king of Kent, and had the brilliant idea of inviting a formerly Roman employed tribe called the Saxons to fight off the Picts and Irish. At first the Saxons only brought a few hundred warriors, but the results were phenomenal. After only a few engagements, the Irish ceased aggressive action. As a reward, the Saxons demanded and received a considerable amount of gold and silver, and a portion of southern Kent. The next wave of Saxons counted in the thousands, and included women and children. By the time the Britains realized the their mercenaries were trying to settle, it was too late. After that, wave after wave after wave of Saxons landed, and there was no stopping them. Those Britons that could fled west, into what is now known as Wales. Welsh, as it turns out, is Saxon for ""stranger.""

2145379,4,B0002YLCFQ,"Now that Cowboys and Injuns is (appropriately) no longer the genre which allows pre-modern warfare in all its hand-to-hand Gore, Film Studios are hard put to find a substitute. What better than a Popular Legend, King Arthur and the Knights of the Roundtable,along with a bit of Feminism, Amazons who can wield a bow and arrow with the best of them and sufficiently agile to avoid spears, knives, axes, in  hand to combat without any need for the armor that the men wore. I couldn't quite make out the various ways in which the Chief Female made her kills, but did see her straddling one guy from the rear with wide-open mouth; I believe a sword also played a role in her repertoire of weaponry, I did expect Errol Flynn, either as Custer or Robin Hood, to rise to the occasion, but was disappointed on that score. There was talk of Rome, Christianity, Freedom, and Saxons, but somehow the native Celts, upon whom the others were feeding in that era, did not get a play. Of course, after the Celts, Saxons, Danes and Vikings had a shot at control of the area we would call England, the Normans ultimately successfully invaded and took permanent control.
Without much need to fall back on reality, which is nearly absent from our common knowledge of this period in "" England"""", the film-makers had pretty much a free hand to invent what they wanted to...and they did.
Over-all, it is not a bad picture if you only allow your mind to dwell on the fighting and not to the politics or cultural attributes which were at the heart of the struggle.",1322265600,2,1540,4.55956678700361
2145380,2,B0002YLCFQ,"Okay, the movie is called ""King Arthur"" and opens with the statement that historians feel that King Arthur was a real person. Presumably that means that the story will be about the real King Arthur. This is nothing like the Le Morte d'Arthur. The timeline of events are mixed up. The backgrounds are distorted. The geography is odd. Who dies when and how is also in dispute. The familial background of the characters is distorted. The step-up for the love triangle is completely destroyed. Merlin is discounted. So, just from the standpoint of the audience's expectation by the title alone, this is a disappointment.

The characters are empty, one dimensional and not very interesting. I like a lot of these actors, so it's really too bad that they weren't given anything to do. Poor Kiera Knightly is herself in everything. If she added, ""Mr. Darcy"" to the end of her lines, should could have been saying many of her lines in Pride and Prejudice. There wasn't anything period about the writing or the style of acting- not just by her, but by everyone. And when she starts shooting arrows with her broken fingers and no clothes on in the snow, that was about all I could take. I got tired of watching this about halfway through. I want to be entertained, but you either have to make the story so good that it's easy to suspend reality or you have to make it seem real. This did neither.",1321660800,3,1386,4.588709677419355

The film's view is that the legends of King Arthur are based on a real man who did not live during the middle ages, as the legends state, but in the middle of the fifth century; also he wasn't an Englishman, but a Roman. The film tells us that around 450, when Rome was in decline, and England, which the Romans had conquered was being overrun by Saxons, the Romans kidnapped youngsters and forced them to serve in their army for fifteen years. One of these youngsters was Arthurius, known to us as Arthur. Arthur became quite adept at fighting and led a small group of about a half dozen men, including Lancelot and Tristan, who were devoted to him and whom he called his knights. As a final fight before releasing the band at the conclusion of their fifteen years, the Romans insisted that he fight against the Saxons. Arthur has no choice but to agree, and his band joins him. They encounter a group of English led by a man called Merlin, and his soldier Genevieve, and need to decide if they will work with Merlin's army. The film is filled with battle scenes.

rite of passage. It is the solemn granting of honorable discharge and safe
conduct pass to newly discharged knights. This late Roman ritual was adapted
in the Middle Ages as the graduation ceremony for the conferral of college
degrees. The Roman honorable discharge document was a carefully inscribed
brass plate or stone plate. It was preserved for generations, since it proved
evidence of citizenship earned by military service that could be handed down
to the knight's heirs. Hundreds of such brass plates have survived and are
displayed in museums today. They were called ""diplomae"" by the Romans and
the same name is used to this day to evidence college degrees. A central registry

mural plaques in the temple of Minerva in Rome.",1313020800,,891,5.109589041095891
2145385,4,B0002YLCFQ,"I'm slightly surprised at the disdain this movie has received from some reviewers. Much like The Coens' The Ladykillers, the only thing it really gets wrong is the title. If this had been called The Last Legion or Eagle in the North it would surely have garnered more positive reviews.

As it is, probably for purely commercial reasons, it's been saddled with tinges of Arthurian legend which does take a bit of wind out of the sails. Like finding out John Wayne is called Marion. Step aside from that however and it's a great man on a mission movie; full of camaraderie, macho dialogue and gritty fights and some pretty good set pieces. The emergent dominance of Christianity is handled well with both sides of belief represented surprisingly adroitly and no disdain levelled at Merlin and his Pagans.

The story itself is quite gripping, too. Not original, but still well told. The last remnants of Britannia's indentured cavalry have their freedom revoked for one last mission, to rescue a child of the Emperor boarding in the far North and under threat from invading Saxon hordes. The sense of an Empire fast on its way to ruin, of stout men for whom duty comes first and of a people caught between changing worlds is captured vividly. This is a dark and dirty world and the film echoes that: The Knights on a suicide mission in a bleak winter land of very little beauty or hope at all.

Yes, it is overtly Hollywood: the ending is hateful and the voiceover just proves how dumb a studio can be (and how stupid they must assume their audiences to be.) Clive Owen is still a glowering, wooden lead devoid of empathy and character but here he is ably supported by an excellent cast, Ray Winstone particularly seeming to revel in being cast in his heroic role rather than as yet another gangster wide-boy. Much has also been made of Keira Knightley's battle fatigues but they are more dyed-in-the-woad than Xena Warrior princess. Certainly, you'd have to be pretty easily shocked to find them sexual and, as an ex-slave with nothing to her name and a fierce desire to fight, she is hardly going to have the epic battle dress and armour of the Legionnaires.

Overall, the Arthurian bumpf stifles an otherwise stirring sword and sandals tale that stands as better than The Eagle, Troy and Alexander combined. Overlook its faults and you have a fun way to spend 90 minutes that surprises, stirs and entertains. Somebody really should slap Hollywood occasionally.",1312848000,,2460,4.754098360655738

As the story begins, the Roman leagions are being withdrawn, just ahead of a fearsome invading Saxon tribe from Germany.  Arthur and his companions must also deal with the uncertain loyalties of the local Celtic tribes.

In spite of the non-traditional take on the Arthurian legends, this ends up being a decent action film.  Clive Owen plays a stoic Arthur, assisted by Ioan Giffud as Lancelot, and Kiera Knightley as an unexpected and attractive ally.  Skellan Skargard almost steals the movie as their ruthless Saxon opponent; his ""at last, a man worth killing"" observation presages a dramatic duel to the death with Arthur.

2145394,4,B0002YLCFQ,"This particular version of the King Arthur story is rather different than previous ones, in as much as it boasts a historical basis derived from current archaeology (or would that be anthropology?)  In any case, it's a cool concept but ultimately it ends up being a bit of a gimmick, considering how the only historic aspect is the theoretical notion that the legend of King Arthur may have been inspired by a Roman citizen in what was then known as Britannia. All the other tropes of the legends--the round table, the knights (in particular their names), Guinevere and Merlin--are just thrown in for the sake of entertainment and recognition.  Of course, the movie steers clear of any supernatural elements from the old stories, which helps maintain consistency in the overall tone.

The noteworthy differences make for an interesting departure, though.  The script is a little unoriginal at times and the antagonistic Saxons are portrayed in a one-dimensional manner, but there is some really strong dialogue peppering the movie throughout and the talented cast really helps bolster some of the weaker scenes so that the viewer is painlessly conveyed to the better ones afterward.  The fight scenes are really well done, which is a major plus in any war movie.  The camera work during the battles manages to be hectic and shaky yet the action is still discernable.  For the faint of heart, it should be known that the scenes are very bloody but no more so than, say, Braveheart or Troy.

I think if anyone enjoyed the aforementioned movies then they would most likely be at least marginally pleased with King Arthur.  If you want the legendary King Arthur with magic and the sword in the stone, check out Roger Boorman's classic Excalibur.  It's coming out on blu-ray soon and it's an awesome movie.

The picture:  overall the blu-ray is fairly good and obviously better looking than the DVD, but it's not really reference quality.",1296000000,2,1933,4.913846153846154
2145395,3,B0002YLCFQ,"This version claims to be based more on literal translations of several old prose tellings, and is more realistically done here, but much was still changed and its odd in places.
The art direction and cinematography are stunning, and I can believe this Arthur more than most, Clive Owen giving an good performance, but there is little recognizable about Lancelot's involvement.  Even less so is Guinevere here, made a Woad (a Celtic pagan) not a princess, just a pagan woman, dressed in rags.  She is cast and played, implausably, by the emmaciated looking actress Keira Knightly.  In one scene, she is washing up in a 'sheer see-through' tent {in winter as it snows outside} while giving Lancelot a come-hither look.  She'd only recently been rescued from near death yet is already thinking sexual liason.  And while it's still the dead of winter in the film, and all the men are heavily clad in leather and armor, Guinever is then dressed only in a barely-there nightgown and thin cloak, of too fine a material, and usually with an exposed shoulder. I was freezing just looking at her!
She's later seen here as a wild-woman of sorts, a skilled archer and hand-to-hand combatant.  While it's known Celtic women fought alongside their men, it's nothing like anything I've read about Guinevere. Again, here she fights while scantily clad, her bust squashed down by leather straps, while the men are covered in furs. {chuckle}

This is definitely a guy flick.

It also ends rather tilted, becoming fairy-tale and does not blend with the realism of the rest of the film.

It's enjoyable as entertainment, but it's no more believable than any other film on the subject.

2145405,1,B0002YLCFQ,"This movie goes downhill from the first time that the word ""knight"" is introduced, which is a class distinction and artifact of the feudal system of the Late Middle Ages NOT Dark Age England.  Although Arthur (which wasn't his real name) confronted Saxon expansion, it was only after the West Saxons were entrenched in the southern shires of England, making it an exercise in futility.  Cornwall became one of the first Welsh/Briton strongholds to become fully a West Saxon dependency, showing the line of advance was from the south to the north NOT from Hadrian's Wall south.

To increase the irony, because of the wrong direction of settlement, the movie changes the allies of the Welsh from their own tribesmen in the south, to a band of Picts in the north.  The Picts would have more likely slaughtered the Welsh if they encountered them, considering them too aligned with Roman customs and mannerisms (i.e., defacto Romans).  The fact that the Welsh and the Saxons both shared a common Roman acculturation is completely lost in the movie, which shows the muttering and barbaric Germans facing the articulate and educated Welsh.  In fact, both nationalities were trained in Roman customs in varying degrees, the Welsh having long-established trading relationships with the Roman empire and the Saxons having adopted Roman military methods and language (they probably even wore similar clothing!).  Not surprisingly, this resulted less in conflict but more in intermarriage, producing a hybrid race of barbarians that for the most part looked favorably on their shared Roman heritage.

There is too much false conflict in the plot based on ethnic differences and not enough illustration of what may have really antagonized ""Arthur"", namely a decreasing area of farming and productive space that would interfere with kingly prerogatives, control and wealth.  Another great problem with the movie is the use of weaponry that is 5 or 6 or more centuries more advanced than would have been possible in the 5th century.  The double-edged battleaxe was not invented by the Vikings until the 10th century, the arrow was not used in great numbers in Europe until the 11th century, crossbows were a medieval invention to defeat armor and catapults were perfected for siege warfare against castles (there were no castles in  5th century England).  This is part of the problem in connecting ""knights"" and ""armor"" to the Arthurian legend, then one needs to bring in the weapons of the Late Middle Ages to justify the misleading terminology and mythology.  One error compounds another.

All in all, a very poor rendition of history which lends no insight as to the real conflict between Saxon and Briton.  That the West Saxons were initially invited into England by some of the Welsh to defend against other invaders in the absence of Roman military authority is also not presented.",1281916800,3,2872,5.067940552016985

The art direction, costumes, scenery, and photography are top of the line but the plot is highly predicable and unbelievable. I found that Clive Owen and Ian Gruffudd did an excellent job of acting but the lines they had to say were so predictable and formulaic that I found myself feeling sorry for the actors having to make these overly emotive statements about abstractions that are barely relevant to the plot. I actually did not have as much of a problem with historical accuracy as many of the other reviewers since there was a period in which Christianized Romans gradually retreated from England, leaving the island to warring Angles, Saxons, Celts, and other native Brittan's. The concept that the Knights of the Round Table were Sarmatians integrated into the Roman army was also an interesting hypothesis. Most traditions have Lancelot as a native of Gaul or modern day France. The character of Guinevere seemed the most implausible. A Celtic woman warrior seemed to be the boldest interpretation so far of the character and position of Guinevere. The Knights of the Round Table, unfortunately, all got mixed together so that it was difficult to distinguish one from another. Merlin is a Celtic wise man and warrior in this interpretation rather than an established part of the court. In the end, I felt this film could have been much more if the screen writers had trusted the audience to comprehend a more sophisticated, realistic script. It was the script that pulled this whole film down despite the considerable talents that went into its making.",1272931200,2,1673,4.978571428571429
2145414,1,B0002YLCFQ,"This movie has gorgeous scenery, terrific costumes, wonderful acting, but is bad.

All because of a silly premise and ridiculous writing.

The idea is that the REAL Arthur was half-Roman, half-English, and led a band of ""Sarmatian"" cavalry against various enemies of Rome in 452--in the farthest-flung, and failing, outpost of the Empire, Britain.

So you get Roman soldiers, blue-painted Picts (or Druids), called ""Woads,"" and yak-like Saxons, whose clothes are apparently made out of their hair, all fighting each other.

There is incessant talk of ""freedom.""  This is never defined, but apparently it means taking orders from Arthur rather than Romans or Saxons.

There is also much talk of ""equality.""  But this is a mere sop.  This is a frigid jungle, with law-of-the-jungle hierarchies.

So the movie makes no sense.  It is beautiful to look at, between bash-them-to-bits Dark Age battles (of which there are many, many, many).  Lots of spurting blood, lopped-off arms, smashing, gouging, arrow-piercing, and so on.

It has one memorable line (Kiera Knightley's before the battle on the ice).

The director, Antoine Fuqua, has essentially remade his previous film Tears of the Sun and couched it within the Arthurian legend. Hear Clive Owen plays the Bruce Willis role.

The Good Stuff: If there ever was a King Arthur this is more in line with what historians think they know about him. His half Roman, half British blood line. His being a commander in the Roman Army, etc.  You also have Hadrian's Wall, the Roman rule, The Sarmatian horsemen, the local tribes who paint themselves blue and a host of other things. This is also a very thrilling movie. There's bravery, valor, great battle scenes, all for one and one for all and Keira Knightley in blue paint and leather battle gear. What else is there?!

The Bad Stuff: Some of the dialogue is a bit clunky.

But the movie is cool. They take some of what we've been told about the legend and use those same components in a more natural way. Excaliber and the drawing of it from the stone (here it's his father's grave) are less magical and more real. The magic here comes from the earth itself. The forests, mountains, rivers and forests are all shot to give the land a personality of its own. A mysticism of its own. And did I mention Keir Knightley in blue paint and leather battle gear? What else is there?!

Fuqua does a nice job directing here. He seems to have keyed in on the Ridley Scott school of film making as this movie has a very sweeping quality to it. It's a big movie with a great look, a good musical score and Keira Knightley in blue paint and leather battle gear.

The film follows the Arthurian legend we've all come to know in such films as Excalibur but without all the myth and magic. It recounts Arthur from youth to his rise as king. The destiny that surrounds Arthur becomes the very fabric of his legend. It takes a mythological figure and brings him to life as a real man. The movie itself is fantastic from the wonderful casting to the well written script. The action sequences draw you into the story instead of leaving you removed with shock and awe at the cgi! It is a wonderful film that will appeal to many and is worthy to be in anyone's collection.

NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: All the special features are carried over. This is the best the film has ever looked but it does not stand out. I was shocked considering Disney usually produces the finest products. Understand that the film's color tones are yellow and blue which is an obvious choice by the director. It clearly looks sharpened up on Blu-Ray but it isn't a demo disc. Nothing stands out. The audio is also lacking which leads me to an overall disappointment.

Christians were actually a minority in the 5th century and even ""Christianized"" Britons would have held onto many pagan customs. Christians NEVER would have tortured pagans simply because they were outnumbered. Saxons didn't have a concept of racial supremacy and their intermingling with the Celtic/Roman natives is what made the ""English"" people and language.

You have to make sure to get the Director's Cut rather than the theatrical version, as the director originally shot the movie as an R movie and 2 weeks or so before release, the studio got cold feet and wanted him to edit it down to a PG-13 movie, possibly hoping to cash in on young boys wanting to see Keira Knightly, who, by the way, is really, REALLY HOT!  As the director pointed out, if he had known the studio was only going to do PG-13, he would have shot the movie completely different than he had as an R.  The result was that there was an awful lot of film that was cut and unable to be edited in some fashion for the newer PG-13.  The Director's Cut is not only the original director's movie, but it is also far superior to what was finally released in the theater.

2145431,3,B0002YLCFQ,"King Arthur: 6 out of 10: 2004's grimy and supposedly historical King Arthur benefits form two great assets; Kiera Knightly in a leather bikini... and some of the funniest scenes ever put on film.

I pretty sure the former was intentional. I am positive the latter was not. One would be harder pressed to find a more ahistorical, awkward, forced and unintentionally funny historical romp anywhere. And the fact the film takes itself so seriously simply adds to the already bountiful mirth.

As any kid who has answered a test question based on watching Mel Gibson's The Patriot has certainly learned, movies and historical accuracy are not friends. Not friends at all. Yet King Arthur wears its 'we are being historical here that is why everything is so muddy' heart on its sleeve.

As if to multiply the historical missteps, the Arthurian legend is often awkwardly forced into the story line at strange places. As a result you have Osama bin Merlin head of what I'm guessing is the Picts. (They are called the Woats but of course there is no such thing. They do wear blue battle paint, which is historically accurate if you are doing a film about Scottish warriors. Scottish warriors attending a football match in the 1970's mind you.) Guinevere is now a leather bikini-wearing archer, and Arthur is a Roman commander fighting the Blue Meanies (after-mentioned Woats) of the north.

The Saxons show up out of nowhere and try to kill everybody. So now in that timeworn movie clich the two former enemies (Arthur of the Romans and Merlin of the Blue Meanies) have to combine forces to defeat the new evil Saxons.

A lot of clichs are evident in King Arthur. The worst is the screeching about freedom in what seems to be every fourth sentence of the screenplay. It's irritatingly repetitive, ridiculous (Arthur doesn't become President Arthur after all or as Monty Python put it ""How did you become king anyway I didn't vote for you"") and it leads to one of the unintentionally funniest scenes ever in a major motion picture release. (As King Arthur gives an almost word for word homage to Mel Gibson's stirring Braveheart battle speech the camera pans back and instead of revealing an army of thousands it has five lone guys. They might as well have been holding coconuts.)

Yet despite all this and an ending that reminds one of Kevin Costner's Robin Hood, I actually enjoyed myself. The battle scenes were pretty well done despite the PG-13, the acting is okay and Kiera Knightly did prance around in a leather bikini for most of the film.

Like the movie Troy, the flaws of this film add a humorous dimension to the proceedings.
And don't forget we fight for FREEDOM from the unrepresentative Republic of which I am a commanding officer so we can create an absolute monarchy with a round table.

 1. Portraying the Roman occupation as lasting into late into the 5th century(historically they withdrew in 410AD).
 2. The Saxon Genocide. Modern research seems to indicate that rather than destroying the natives, the invading Angles and Saxons settled amongst and intermarried with the native Britons. Also,the first Anglo-Saxons were invited to Britain as mercanaries by the Britons.

I know few movies stick to the facts all the time, but seeing as
this one was trumpeted as the best Arthur film yet, and the only one set in the correct era, was it unfair to expect a presentation of Arthurian legend that reflected current historical knowledge to some degree?

Artistic licence is one thing, politically correct revisonism is another. There seemed to be no end to the Roman and Christian bashing, with the Roman Empire depicted as evil ruthless imperialists, and the church thier instrument of oppression.

Pelagius died a century before Germannus came to Britain, so the former could not have had any part in his death, yet the film claims he did, in an apparent attempt to blacken his name, and demonise the Romans.

The Picts lived outside Roman Britannia, and their country was never conquered by the Romans, so they were not heroic freedom fighters as this film depicts. They were little more than opportunistic raiders who took advantage of Britain's weakness.

At times the depiction of certain races and people even bordered on the xenophobic, with the Saxons apparently holding to some ridiculous notion of not 'corrupting' their 'pure' blood that might almost smack of ideas later promoted by Nazisim. So because of their German connections, the Saxons are something akin to proto-nazis? Please.",1252022400,2,1437,4.970833333333333

Arthur is so besotted with Rome that he dresses as a Roman cavalryman? (But with a legionary's infantry helmet.) The Knights of the Round Table are Sarmatians? Merlin is a Celt who paints himself blue? Guinevere is an Amazon? Rome is the protector of freedom? The Britons are all for ""liberty"" and ""free will""? And the Britons, Sarmatians, Romans, and Saxons all speak the same language? (They don't even bother to pretend otherwise.) Gimme a break. Not to mention that the Saxons, not being stupid, invaded England from the south and never did reach Hadrian's Wall. The plot jumps from a time when the Sarmatians first arrive as recruits in the north of England (though they never actually fight as Romans) and Arthur is just a boy, to a scene fifteen years later, when Arthur (who, for some reason, was promised command when he was young) is running the whole show. From what everyone says, all the exciting battles took place years earlier and killed off most of the knights, so this, apparently, is their swan song. Though by skipping over those years, the director also never gives us a reason why the survivors should be so loyal to Arthur. There are a couple of good battle sequences, though the fight on the ice is dramatically superior to the big climax -- in which the Britons are suddenly in possession of artillery engines. And Keira Knightly is nice to look at -- though she's far too skinny to be convincing as a sword-swinging warrior. The only halfway believable character, in fact, is Cerdic, the Saxon chief, played menacingly by Stellan Skarsgaard.

A superb rendition, with accurate costumes, arms, and armour of the period. This version of the ""Arthur"" Legend centres on the romano-briton Gauis Artorius Cliptus, and the Saemartian Cavalry, and is generally accepted as 'too early' by 400 years as being the 'real' Arthur, by historians.

However, the story of a Britain being overrun by the Saxons after the collapse of the Roman Empire, is correct, and shown in all of its 'Blood, Guts, and Gory Glory!'

The main characters are well portrayed, and the Brythionic Celts are shown as a 'woodland' tribal people similar to Native Americans which is relatively accurate.

Merlin, (in this version of the legend), figures in a relatively small role as the leader of the Celts, who join with Arthur and his fellow Romano-Britons to crush the Saxon invaders.

All of the major action is centered around Hadrians wall, which is taken under licence since the location of the battle of Mount Badon is unknown. But what the Heck! It's Hollywood! Keira Knightly as Gwenevere is outstanding, just about the best looking Celt I've ever seen!

It's well written, well acted, with astounding music by Hans Zimmer, and is in short a much better version of ""King Arthur"" than so much of the other ""King Arthur"" films that have been done over the years.

The decision to only release the theatrical version of the film in a ""full screen"" format, on the other hand, was one of the dumbest ideas I've ever heard of... ever. I very much enjoy watching my hi-def home theater system, because the picture quality is so much better than at most theaters, the sound is always fantastic, and you don't have to deal with rowdy crowds. But watching the theatrical version in ""full screen"" is rather irritating, and it's even more irritating that a 16x9 widescreen enhanced format release of the theatrical version has never been released since then. A ridiculously poor decision by everyone involved.

2145444,4,B0002YLCFQ,"This version of King Arthur is a lot of fun. As has been previously mentioned, it is no retelling of the myth as per Tom Malory, but really a loose retelling of Kurosawa's Seven Samurai in an Arthurian setting. There are seven Sarmatian Knights (Arthur, Bors, Lancelot, Gawaine, Dagonet, Tristan and Galahad) sent on a dangerous mission to rescue a Roman family from the Saxons and later help defeat the Saxon army at Badon Hill. The names of the knights do not reflect their mythic counterparts, but there are nods to some of them. Galahad is the Christian knight, Lancelot likes sleeping with other men's wives, Arthur is the idealistic leader. There are also fun nods to the mythic elements of the story, such as the sword in the stone, Merlin, the round table, as well.

The villains are fun as well. Cerdic, the Saxon leader, seems to be suffering from terrible ennui for most of the story until he meets Arthur dace to face. ""Ah, finally a man worth killing!""

The film looks a treat and GENERALLY appears accurate, with a few deliberate anachronisms. The stirrup debate rages on, as well as the crossbow argument, but the most noticable inaccuracy is the fantasy armour that the knights wear in the final battle. Personally, I love their look, but you won't find it in any history book, blending as it does the dark ages and 15th century harness. Its a deliberate decision, rather than a mistake, as opposed to the costumes in 13th Warrior which seemed to have been put together by a madman.

2145448,2,B0002YLCFQ,"Anybody who knows anything about the history of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table in the cinema knows that English director John Boorman staged the best version of the Arthurian myth in 1981 in his classic sword & sorcery saga ""Excalibur."" Before ""Excalibur"" set the gold standard, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer produced as their first widescreen film ""Knights of the Round Table"" (1953) in blazing Technicolor with Robert Taylor and Ava Gardner. The 1967 musical ""Camelot"" featured Richard Harris as Arthur and Vanessa Redgrave as Guinevere and the serviceable 1995 Sean Connery/Richard Gere swashbuckler ""First Knight"" both deserve honorable mention. Any of these four, however, would eclipse the latest rehash of the Arthur legend. Not only do ""Training Day"" director Antoine Fuqua, ""Gladiator"" scripter David Franzoni and ""Pearl Harbor"" producer Jerry Bruckheimer strip the luster off the legend in their new movie ""King Arthur"" (** out of ****), but also they forego full-blown fantasy for half-baked fact. Based on 'recent archaeological findings,' Fuqua, Franzoni and Bruckheimer have revised the fable, so they can tell 'the untold true story that inspired the legend' in their tedious, long-winded, grimy, 130-minute mishmash of British mythology. Romance takes a back seat to the shoddily choreographed action sequences, and to preserve a PG-13 rating the filmmakers could only show blood on the combatant's swords. This time around Merlin appears as a wise elder with zero magical powers, while Guinevere emerges as a feisty battle maiden dressed up as a dominatrix packing a sword or a bow in either hand. Despite its mostly-Brit cast led by actor Clive Owen in a sterling performance as Arthur and ""Black Hawk Down"" lenser Slawomir Idziak's atmospheric cinematography, ""King Arthur"" does everything wrong in its misguided effort to create a new, different, and more realistic Arthur.

""King Arthur"" concerns itself with the roots of the Round Table. In this handsomely produced but hackneyed hokum, we learn that the mythical Arthur owes everything to a real person who lived back in the Dark Ages during the Fifth Century. This Arthur (Clive Owen of ""Beyond Borders"") is a Roman officer in command of an elite cavalry unit consisting of guys from Sarmatia (somewhere near the modern Republic of Georgia in Europe) who made a pact with Marcus Aurelius to serve in his army for fifteen years. Imagine a gritty, down-to-earth ""Magnificent Seven"" as knights on horseback, and you'll have an idea what to expect. As the story unfolds, our heroes await their walking papers as Arthur discusses terms with Roman Bishop Germanius (Ivan Marescotti of ""Hannibal""). The Bishop cooks up a last-minute suicide mission for Arthur and his knights that requires them to cross Hadrian's Wall and liberate a Roman family living on a farm in the middle of enemy country. The savage Saxon hordes, like the Apaches in a western, are descending from every quarter, and the Romans are pulling out, so the Bishop needs somebody expendable. After Arthur and his knights reach the farm, they discover the slimy Roman has natives holed up in a dungeon where he tortures them in the name of the Vatican. A wizened shaman named Merlin advises these rebellious Woads, and Guinevere (Keira Knightley of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"") is one of them, locked up and tormented until Arthur sets her free. Now, our heroes must escort this motley crew through treacherous territory with the murderous Saxons breathing down their necks every inch of the way.

The chief problem with ""King Arthur"" lies in David Franzoni's dreadful screenplay. The rescue mission on which Arthur and the knights embark resembles an uninspired 1950's era cavalry western. Interestingly, the rescue recalls Fuqua's lackluster last opus ""Tears of the Sun"" with Bruce Willis. In ""King Arthur,"" Franzoni and Fuqua make the fatal mistake of taking themselves far, far too seriously. Not even actor Ray Winstone's churlish character Bors can redeem ""King Arthur."" As a chivalrous Round Table Knight, Bors is a poorly dressed shaven-headed lout with several illegitimate children who threatens to marry their mother. Fuqua and company play Bors largely for laughs. Using crude contemporary slang, Bors becomes the first on-screen knight to carp about the need to urinate. Hans Zimmer's dirge-like orchestral music hangs tragically over the ponderous action. Fuqua should stick to helming urban thrillers like ""The Replacement Killers"" and ""Training Day,"" because he cannot orchestrate epic battle sequences. The larger-than-life battle between our heroes and the villainous Saxons on an iced-over lake lacks dramatic intensity, though the underwater shots bolster the suspense. Watching Keira Knightley triumph over opponents twice her size in combat stretches credibility to the breaking point. Meanwhile, the underwritten characters of Gawain, Tristan and Galahad spend most of their time on the periphery of the action, while the heavy-handed historical exposition bogs down the action. Stellan Skarsgard doesn't make much of an impression as the villain through his bearded face and whispered dialogue. Franzoni pulls a surprise that cannot be revealed without spoiling the plot. Believe me, when it happens, you will feel cheated. As for the love triangle involving Guinevere, Arthur, and Lancelot, ""King Arthur"" leaves it out! In their quest for a more historically accurate interpretation of the Arthurian legend, the people who made ""King Arthur"" strive to live down the legend.

I think the aspect that appeals to me is seeing these characters in a different light; Tristan without Iseult, Merlin without magic. I enjoy imagining the characters as real people, and not just romantic figures from fable and myth. I see a lot of comments about historical accuracies and inaccuracies, but I think films like this only inspire further learning. What can I say, I love this one.",1225756800,4,655,4.754385964912281

2145473,2,B0002YLCFQ,"You too can direct a big budget disaster based upon the myths. Of course, Antoine Fuqua, director of Training Day, seems eager to show that the idea that a person can direct only what they know is true- he's a black American homeboy, and his grasp of the legends is not even slender- is true. In truth, the tales of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table are for more entertaining and grand than the dclass tripe of The Lord Of The Rings saga, but you would not know it in this version. Instead of romance, intrigue, honor, and magic we get `realism'- or so the director spouts over and again in his film commentary, and in the assorted extras on the DVD. But, please note the ` ' that I used around the word realism. That's because there's not a hint of it in this disaster. First off, the blood and guts fighting is laughably unreal. Ever since Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line in 1998, filmmakers have been trying to be `real' in their violence onscreen. This `realistic' movie, however, eschews that. Yet, the Knights curse and spit, especially a Cockney Sir Bors (Ray Winstone). They also are not British, nor even French. Instead, they are from Sarmatia- a region that never produced knights in the early 5th Century, when this film is set, nor were they ever at war with the Roman Empire, as claimed. In the tales, King Arthur and his Knights are devout Christians, and Rome is little seen. In the film, Arthur is a Roman Christian in service to the Pope, Lancelot is a heathen, and Merlin (Stephen Dillane) the head of a band of forest people called Wodes who, in this `realistic' film, never existed. In short, the film centers around Arthur's Knights' rescue of a would-be child church bishop north of Hadrian's Wall before the terrible Saxons sweep in from the North. Unfortunately, the Saxons never occupied northern Britain, they were defenders of the Isle from Scots, Picts, and Celts, and they were not marauding barbarians in the mold of the Vikings a half an eon later- all, again, in this `realistic' movie.
  Gwynevere (played by the lovelier than words Keira Knightley -or is it Natalie Portman with an accent?) is a wild warrior woman in the Xena mold- possibly a Wode, although this is never definitively made clear- which she and Fuqua claim is historically accurate, although it's not, but allows the brief notion that the glimpses of her taut, lithe, nacreous bod (and nacreous is a word destined to describe Ms. Knightley's skin) in skimpy leather, in winter- mind you, will soon give way to a great romantic love scene with Arthur (the petrified Clive Owen). But, alas, the one brief romantic scene is lame, Keira stays far too clothed, and Lancelot (Ioan Gruffydd) is a total pussy who seems utterly impotent in the face of Gwyn's charms.... Now, none of these failings would matter in the least were the tale a damned good one, but the only way this script could have been passable on celluloid were someone like a Roger Corman brought in to camp it up. But, humor and camp are totally absent in this hermetically dry waste of time. So, the claims of `realism' and historical accuracy' are the only thing this monstrosity had going for it- along with the anticipated delight of Keira Knightly in and out of leather, yet it fails miserably on both scores. And the editing is atrocious- with at least three major discontinuities in scenes where snow is seen on the ground, them mysteriously replaced by green grass a second later. Avoid this film, burn the DVD, and read Thomas Malory. To sum up- I still look forward to the day when I can ogle Ms. Knightley's taut form in the way it entered this world, but the hopes that this film would be entertaining or even passable, well- to quote Mistah Kurtz- `He dead!'",1221264000,,3757,4.622754491017964

Which in turn is based on the actual battle of the Lake Peipus which the  ""Russ"" (sound familiar) defeated the Germanic / Teutonic Knights during the Battle of the Ice on April 5, 1242.

However, if you are interested in a powerful and different take on the legend and are up for something outside of that same old retelling of the same old story, this movie is a must see in my opinion.

In 'King Arthur' you will find action on all fronts and humor and a change in the appearances and styles of the old interpretations.  Guinevere is not the weak Christian woman of lore but a powerful warrior fighting along side the knights who each bear their own look as well as fighting style that makes for a far more visually stimulating flick than the previously stamped-out-of-the-same-mould look of other Arthur movies.

I'm not sure what the arguing is about regarding this movie.  Movies are for entertainment, not forming a belief system.  Historical accuracy has never been an obligation of Hollywood - nor do they claim it.  That is common sense when it comes to Mel Brooks (History of the World pt 1)and it should be in regards to this movie as well!  If you want an education in history - read a book!

2145480,4,B0002YLCFQ,"When I first saw King Arthur, I was delightfully surprised as I had mediocre expectations.  The movie contains a certain depth that most action/adventure movies these days lack.  The acting was better than average (bad) but nothing fantastic.  Most notable was the lack of connection to any other king arthur flick.  All of the fairy-tale type content was taken out and replaced with a more realistic feel, which I prefer.  For instance, Merlin is a tribal leader of wildmen that are king arthurs opponents.  For those of you who are interested in historical accuracy, this is based on newly discovered archeological evidence.  The battle scenes are good enough, lacking the overall violence of most historical movies.  That is fixed a little in the ""unrated"" version.  The characters are fun,  but my favorite part of the movie is Hans Zimmers sweeping score.  In my opinion, music plays a HUGE part in initial impact.  Overall it is a fun, above average action flick.  I have watched it many times and have enjoyed  it each time.  As long as you don't watch it expecting Braveheart, Gladiator, or even 300, you will find it to be on parr with at least ""Troy"".",1212624000,,1161,4.792929292929293
2145481,4,B0002YLCFQ,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""King Arthur.""  Sure, we can all haggle over history (or legend, as the case may be) but what this film boils down to is that it is an action yarn that's littered with historical and legendary tidbits about one of the greatest legends of our time, King Arthur.  Clive Owen takes up Excalibur as our hero this time, and he leads a group of Samatian knights against the Woads and then the Saxons to set his people free.  Galahad, Tristan, Gawain and others ride with Arthur and face death with not even the slightest bit of fear.  In this version, Guinevere and Lancelot only flirt for a minute, so don't expect the love triangle that was key to so many of the other versions of this great epic.

The cast is excellent, including Ioann Gruffudd (Fantastic Four, Horatio Hornblower), Hugh Dancy (Ella Enchanted, Blood and Chocolate), Ray Stephenson (HBO's ""Rome""), Ray Winstone (Cold Mountain, Beowulf), Stellan Skarsgard (Deep Blue Sea, Amistad, Pirates of the Caribbean), and Til Schweiger (SLC Punk!, Joe and Max).  Fans of Jerry Bruckheimer productions will notice plenty of the actors involved in this film.  The music, by Hans Zimmer, is some of his most epic yet.

Director Antoine Fuqua does an excellent job of melding plot and action in this tale.  Writer David Franzoni litters the story with just enough legend to remind you that Arthur may or may not have been just that.  Some of the characters, especially knights such as Tristan, Dagonet and Bors, are given lighter treatment than you'd expect, but maybe that's why this tale is called ""King Arthur"" and not ""Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table.""

The DVD is very nice.  It features two very informative mini-documentaries on the making of the film.  The first is ""Blood On The Land"" which gives you an inside look at the making of the film.  The other is ""Round Table,"" which features a literal round table with some of the cast and key members of the production.  There's also the optional ""Knight Vision,"" which offers all sorts of trivia about the actual time and place these events might have taken place in.

Granted, historians and armchair historians will argue over this film's accuracy until the cows come home.  In the end, though, this film is nothing more than an epic along the lines of ""Gladiator.""  I highly recommend ""King Arthur"" as well as two other Arthurian films, those being ""Excalibur"" and the musical ""Camelot.""",1211760000,,2426,4.804819277108434

Even though it isn't fantasy it is not hard to see how Arthurian legend came about. This is not for the feint of heart since the battles are depicted like they were likely to have been fought, vicious and bloody. Good cast, directing, effects, and music make this at least worth a rental for most fans of war movies. The central story revolves around Arturius, half Roman and half Britain, and his knights that guarded the Hadrian Wall. The knights were actually Sumation decendants that were exceptional calvary warriors that were drafted by Rome to serve fifteen years. When the Saxon army invades they have a hard choice as to whether stay and fight or return to their homeland. Merlin is a Britain and the father of Guinevere a warrior in her own right. Merlin's magic is smoke and something equivalent to Greek fire. Not a family movie, but certainly engaging for those that like chivalry and long epic battles. It may seem a bit long to those that aren't into war movies. Fans of ""Braveheart"" or ""Troy"" will probably enjoy it.

2145494,3,B0002YLCFQ,"This film is digging up the myth used by Purcell for his own King Arthur semi-opera a few centuries ago. But he does not really improve the fable. He adds the Romans, the Roman Legion, Hadrian's Wall, and the ""Roman"" origin of Arthur and his knights. But it cannot reach the sublime music Purcell had wrapped the tale in. So the film can only concentrate on horror. The Roman horror of slavery and forced Christianization, under the menace of dying in some dungeon where you will be buried alive. The horror of the Saxons who do not colonize people but only conquer the land and empty it completely of their inhabitants. And even the horror of the native Britons who are pagan and fierce fighters. This reduces Merlin to some kind of spiritual if not only war leader. Arthur will decide to fight against the Saxons, hence to fight with the Britons and then to Christianize them by marrying the girl he had saved from the Roman dungeons. Of course this film has nothing to do with history and it has no real depth about the real conflict between liberty and the future, between freedom and peace, or should I say rather war? The film is then a long series of bloody battles shown in details, but that's a little bit short to make a good film that has otherwise no content.

Video - 4/5.  Displayed in 2.35:1 1080p, the video is very good.  With the likes of Wall-E and Dark Knight out there to set the bar so high, older movies just can't recreate the same magic.  But often times, studios will do a haphazard job of remastering their films for hi-def.  Not so in this case.  King Arthur is an apt hi-def translation.  The film is a tad grainy, but that suits the film's directorial/cinematographical style.  Fuqua wanted to show the entire range of british weather.  So you get a lot of overcast, fog, snowy, rainy scenes.  The dynamic color palette of blu-ray picks up every shadow, snowflake and lush greens of the country-side.  Every pore on clive owen's face is visible.  The slight graininess is quickly forgotten, but the incredible sharpness is remembered.

Audio - 4/5.  Comes in Dolby Digital, uncompressed 5.1 48kHz 24-bit.  Not a sci-fi movie, so there aren't the thunderous explosions and fly-over rear channel effects.  But for a medieval set movie, the sound is appropriately crisp.  The pounding hooves of the horses will supply the most bass.  And the ice cracking in the 2nd act will provide some nice sound effects.  You won't be using this to show off your great sound system.  But for the most part, the sound is suitable if not fantastic.

Special Features - Roundtable with all the stars including Clive Owen and Keira Knightly, Antoine Fuqua and Jerry Bruckheimer.  Pretty cool insight from the discussions of the key players.  A Backstage featurette provides the standard ""making of"" bonus feature.  The best bonus feature is the ""trivia pop-up"" mode.  Random bits of history, filming anecdotes and various trivia pop up throughout the play of the movies.

If you are a fan of this movie, it is worth the blu-ray upgrade.  If you don't already own this movie, definitely pick up the blu-ray version.",1187395200,,2049,4.841040462427745

Those who are having a problem reconciling the fantasy with the reality, please try to get over it.  This movie sticks closly to what I have read about the real Arthur.  Those who had a problem with the costume Keira wore during the battle seen - check your ancient celtic history.  These great warriors actually painted themselves blue and fought naked.  There was an incredible amount of detail that was faithful to the historical research done for this film.  And, no, Arthur was NOT betrayed by his wife either.

Love, which replaces ""Merlin's Magic"" in this film is of the sort that comes from living for a greater good and practicing selflessness, not a romantic affair with Guinevere. Fuqua captured the grace and growing depth of Arthur's journey beautifully.

As someone who avoids action movies, I found the battle depictions to be as essential to the story as any of the dialogue. They were not gore-fests but smart battle scenes that gave us a glimpse of the brutality of the times and the unique characters involved.
Antoine Fugua made a beautiful movie and Clive Owen was the perfect thoughtful Arthur. In fact the entire cast was great.

2145510,2,B0002YLCFQ,"The movie aspires to be a re-telling of one of the many possible origins for the King Arthur legend.  I give it two stars for this effort.  The role of the Roman Empire in Britain is one that is rarely visited by Hollywood, even though the influence of the Romans on English culture lives on today.

""King Arthur"" is a mildly entertaining movie, but highly flawed.  Lots of reviews have commented on the historical flaws, but I'll give the movie a pass on this one.  The legend of King Arthur has such murky origins that nobody could possibly mistake this movie for a historical documentary.

The biggest problem with this movie, IMHO, is the casting.  The movie employs lots of actors who have done fine work elsewhere, but they just don't fit the characters that they play in this movie.  Let's go through the list:

Clive Owen - with his tired and raspy voice, cynical but earnest attitude, droopy eyelids, and sad hound-dog look, Clive Owen has NOIR written all over his face.  His looks and style most closely resemble Humphrey Bogart and he was perfect for his anti-hero roles in ""Sin City"" and ""Inside Man"".  But as King Arthur?  Throughout this movie, I could never see in him the power, the grace, nor the machismo that could inspire a legend that would pass down through the centuries.  King Arthur was a role that someone of the stature of Russell Crowe would have handled easily, but he must have been beyond the budget of this movie.

Keira Knightly - it is really weird how a semi-savage Woad/Pict princess can enunciate so clearly in grammar school perfect Received Pronunciation English.  I can hear every consonant in every word that Keira Knightly speaks!  Yes, Keira is somewhat pretty, but her teeth are huge, she has an underbite, her features are too sharp, and her mannerisms too much that of a modern day spoiled, proper suburban English princess for her to be believable as Guinevere, whether played as a Woad/Pict of ancient Britain or as the traditional unfaithful Queen of King Arthur.  Keira was perfect for her roles in ""Bend it Like Beckham"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", but not as Guinevere.

Ioan Gruffudd - I couldn't figure out why Lancelot was so skinny and wimpy looking and whined so much like a girl until I looked at the credits and realized that this was really Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four, hiding behind a hairy black beard, and speaking in perfect R.P. English.  'Nuff said, Ioan was great as the wimpy, nerdy Mr. Fantastic.  But, as with King Arthur, you need someone of STATURE to play the role of Lancelot.  The young Liam Neeson once played this role perfectly in ""Excalibur"".

Stellan Skarsgard - this guy actually does have a somewhat funky Swedish lilt to his speech on top of his American accent when he is allowed to speak in complete sentences (e.g., when he appears in the ""Making Of"" featurette), but, playing the role of a Saxon barbarian chief, he is only given a few choice words to grunt out; only his very modern sounding American accent comes through in these grunts.  Since most of Skarsgard's dialogue in this movie is with an actor with a proper German accent (playing the son of the Saxon chief), this mixing and matching of accents is really strange.

Joel Edgerton - the young Uncle Owen Lars from Star Wars!  So baby faced, and gentle appearing, definitely not the imperfect, powerful Gawain of legend.

Mads Mikkelsen - this guy has seriously hooded eyelids.  He was perfect as the evil Le Chiffre in ""Casino Royale"".  In this movie, hidden behind a heavy black beard, and given few lines to speak, his character Tristan is reduced to a disposable prop, much along the lines of the security guy who always dies in each Star Trek episode.  Tristan was not a minor figure in the Arthurian legends, he was a legend with his own story arc and origins.

In summary, this is a rather oddball movie that aspires to greatness, but is undone by poor casting choices and bad dialogue.  It did get me interested in learning more of the real history underlying the plot, things such as the Saxon invasion of Britain, the role of Pelagius in the early Christian Church, and the role of the Romans in ancient Britain.",1181260800,8,4183,4.665757162346521

2145522,3,B0002YLCFQ,"First of all, this movies is not nearly as 'historically accurate' as has been said.  The Sarmatian horsemen, made out to be the heroes of the movie and the identity of the Arthurian knight, were not even documented in Britain past the 3rd Century.  Yes, they had significant influence on late Roman cavalry, but by the time this movie is set most of the Sarmatian tribes were either fighting against Rome with the Huns, or had been destroyed.

Although entertaining to watch, the battles in this movie are at times pitifully improbable (such as the Picts' usage of catapults in the climatic battle).  The savagery of the Saxons and the nobility of the Picts are both also exaggerated.  The Pictish chieftain, 'Merlin' speaking Gaelic was an interesting (though implausible) detail.  The reader will note that I have said 'Pict' here, but they are called 'Woads' throughout the movie.  The real Picts/Woads actually used tattoos rather than paint, and they were also a symbol of the warrior elite.

The gist of the plot is that Arthur is one of the last Roman leaders in a troubled 5th Century Britain (historically, the Romans withdrew in 408) and leads a wing of Sarmatian auxiliary horsemen, whose names are taken from the Anglicized medieval legends (Lancelot, Gawain, Bors, etc.).  Arthur is portrayed as a Pelaganist Christian at the beginning of the movie; thus his is part of a different version of the faith followed by most of Rome.  His men are pagans.

Arthur and his Sarmatians are on the brink of release from their servitude to the Empire, but their final task is to escort one of the last Roman families in the north away from the invading Saxon horde.  Along the way they are joined by a Pictish female warrior, Guinevere.  The Saxons, under the leadership of Cerdic and Cynric are systematically slaughtering the native Britons and Romans (quite unlike real history, in which they simply established themselves as a ruling elite over them) and they do battle with the knights.  Arthur is joined by Merlin, leader of the Woads, and his warriors at the climatic battle, which is messy enough but not overly bloody.  The end of the movie suggests that Arthur becomes a ruler of the Woads.

Overall, it is a decent movie but it is very hard for history lovers to take it seriously.",1177718400,3,2295,4.786802030456853
2145523,5,B0002YLCFQ,"By accident, I ran accross this movie on a cable channel, FX. It was great fun. Maybe the last battle scene ran a little long tho. None-the-less, better entertainment than most of what is available.

The scenes between Arthur (Clive Owen)and Guinevere (Keira Knightley) have a great chemistry. They are individually and together magnetic. Having Guinevere as an archer works well, not so well with the sword.",1176940800,,408,5.08955223880597
2145524,5,B0002YLCFQ,The reason that I really liked this movie is the probability of it being very close to being portrayed correct. The director's cut of this movie is much better than the PG-13 version of it. It is much more explainitory and in depth story and the characters involved. This is probably my all time favorite story of King Arthur. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that likes movies about Camelot and King Arthur.,1175040000,,415,4.621621621621622

  I understand that this is not the penultimate story of King Arthur, but I would hope that someone well versed in the mythology might appreciate some embellished historic theories.  Not your father's King Arthur. Fine!

  While The Mists of Avalon and Excalibur are both exquisite telling of this myth, I enjoyed the relation of the Roman occupation juxtaposed with the Saxon expansion. The historic view was quite enjoyable despite any inaccuracies you might discover.

  Finally it's hard to be displeased by any movie with Clive Owen in it. If you like more reality based movies please watch Croupier. One of his best>",1172534400,,629,5.019417475728155
2145526,1,B0002YLCFQ,"Amazon's suggestion that Gladiator and this movie are comparable as entertainments is grossly misleading. For all its historical inaccuracy, Gladiator was highly original for its time and, as its enduring impact proves, exceptionally well written, directed, and acted. King Arthur, on the other hand, is typical of the made-for-late-night-television, low-budget-reworking-of-a-popular-film-in-recent-circulation genre--that film being, in this case, an amalgamation of the Lord of the Rings, the Pirates of the Caribbean, and, here's the connection, Gladiator. To some degree, King Arthur's pervasive anachronisms and historical romanticizations as well as its CGI effects make the movie feel something like Xena. Yet the movie's linguistically (see the script excerpt at the top of the amazon listing) and intellectually muddled writing--I stopped counting the dialogue's vagaries about ""freedom"" after about the 20th mention of the word--its choppy, sloppy, and unimaginitive directing, its stiff, B-list acting, and its extremely gratuitous violence ultimately render this movie inferior to the very worst of Xena episodes, let alone anything else I have seen on late-night T.V. during the last several years.

Visually, it had a mystical beauty to it and although I'm not a fan of violence in films, I really loved the battle scenes - very exciting and well done.  I bought the theatrical version first, then the director's cut, and I highly recommend this version.  All the actors did a wonderful job; several of them I had never heard of before, but after seeing this film, I won't soon forget them.  I was particularly impressed by Ray Winstone as Bors, and Mads Mikkelsen as Tristan.  Really top-notch actors.",1171584000,6,547,4.540816326530612

First, the acting is top notch. The entire cast did an excellent job. The characters are unique and interesting. The dialog is smart and powerful. This Aurthur is a student of Marcus Arellius, considered one of the greatest rulers of Rome. Clive Owen, as always, gave a commanding performance as Aurthur.

That is we really know little of them at all. Brilliantly filmed and produced, the viewer gets the sense that he/she is back in the time of Arthur and feels like a part of the film. This film is real. With love, action, chivalry and a taste of history, Arthur offers four corners of the named ambiance for the movie viewer and should be seen by all.",1169596800,2,541,4.42

Kiera Knightley just gets better and better and what hasn't been said about Clive Owen.  The best part of this movie was not shown in theaters, the Director's cut explains how and why Lancelot and the others are there in England in the first place, the supporting cast was magnificent, Hugh Dancy and Ray Stevenson standouts.  Much more than the typical love triangle usually presented in the Arthur legends, this Arthur was a real man with a real purpose and a conflicted dream, Owen's strength was showing Arthur's weaknesses and making us love him (Arthur) more than we love Lancelot which is pretty hard to do as Lancelot as always is such a hottie, (Dark Ages style).  The battle of Baden Hill is an historical fact, there was no need to resort to Merlin's magic to defeat the wonderfully evil foes, just hard fighting together.  Truly an excellent movie for those of you who love romance and reality.  I don't understand why Ioan Gruffudd isn't a bigger star, his is a powerful presence and his voice absolutely mesmerizing.",1169078400,2,1146,4.851282051282051

The characters and the plot of King Arthur and Tears of the Sun are interchangeable.  Watch one movie and you'll feel like you've watched both.

2145533,3,B0002YLCFQ,"It's got action maestro Antoine Fuqua (Training Day) as a director, big budget action extrordinaire Jerry Bruckheimer as producer, and a different, but creative, take on the legendary King of Camelot.  Clive Owen stars as Arthur; a Roman soldier stuck defending England against the invading horde of Saxons.  Even though there are tons of historical inaccuracies, twitchy logic, and even some sloppy editing; this King Arthur still manages to be entertaining and packs in so much well choreographed action that you'll ignore most, if not all, of the bad points of the film.  Owen is good as the heroic Arthur, and Keira Knightley is just plain gorgeous as warrior babe Guinevere, who loves arrows and leather straps.  Ioan Gruffudd is here as well as Lancelot, along with Stellan Skarsgrd, Ray Winstone, and Ray Stevenson from HBO's Rome.  All in all, King Arthur is an enjoyable, pretty much mindless, action film that delivers the goods it promises, and is better than what you may think.",1167868800,,990,5.012195121951219
2145534,3,B0002YLCFQ,"Let's begin by saying that as entertainment, this movie is passable (albeit, just barely). The scene of the battle in the ice is certainly one of the most exciting scenes shown in movies during that year. As for the actors, most of them lack charisma in their roles, except for Keira Knightley as an improbable celtic warrior. Clive Owen, specially, is totally devoid of charisma in the lead role (though he has proven he is a fine actor in other movies). OK, now let's turn to history. This movie was promoted when it was released as the true historical portrait of King Arthur (someone who, most likely, never existed), so it's fair to question this aspect of the movie. According to this film, Arthur was a Roman general who, by the time of the withdrawal of the Roman troops from the British Isles in the 5th century, decided to join the Celtic locals against the Germanic invaders and eventually become their king. Well, where one can start? With Arthur's warriors shown as improbable proto Russians? With its anachronic portrayal of the Catholic Church, already more powerful than the Roman empire and engaging in the inquisition (an invention from the late middle ages)?. With its laughable references to historical figures like Bishop Germanius and the heretic writer Pelagius? If you want to see an entertaining movie, you might enjoy this film, but if you have some interest in the history of the period, you are bound to came out very disappointed.",1166054400,3,1459,4.84

Ioan Gruffudd (starred in Fantastic four as Jessica's love in the movie) did an amazing job though in his part. I wish he wasent killed at the end. I didn't recognize him in this movie. I didn't like how there was no build up of Clive and Keira's love. They make out once and then at the end of the film they get married? At least show some love developing.

It's an very good film, especially rousing to a brit, like me. However, no-one knows whether Arthur was a Briton or not, indeed this film suggests that his mother was and his father of Roman descent.

2145549,5,B0002YLCFQ,"`King Arthur' released in '04 is a masterpiece! Not since `The Magnificent Seven' in '60 has there been such an exciting film about a courageous and valiant band of warriors facing insurmountable odds on the field of battle.

Synopsis: Seven knights are all that remains of the feared Salmacian fighting forces in servitude to the Roman Empire. The time of Rome's departure from Britain has come and the surviving warriors now await their long promised release from duty. However their appointed time of freedom is withheld until they undertake one last mission, a mission that will bring them face to face with a massive army of invaders from the North. Freedom is in the balance, both for themselves and the British Isles. The choice they make will make them legends.

The legendary seven are; Clive Owen (Arthur), Ioan Gruffudd (Lancelot), Mads Mikkelsen (Tristan), Hugh Dancy (Galahad), Joel Edgerton (Gawain), Ray Winstone (Bors) and Ray Stevenson (Dagonet). This is an epic tale with an unforgettable cast. I never get tired of watching this film.

Also outstanding performances by Stellan Skarsqard and Kiera Knightley as Guinevere.",1161648000,2,1139,5.179347826086956
2145550,5,B0002YLCFQ,"This film has it all with spectacular scenery, an interesting story line and good acting.

This is definitely not the King Arthur that most of us have seen in past films or read about in the wonderful stories of Mary Stewart.  This Arthur is no gentle scholar, but a skilled Roman soldier. The story begins with an explanation about how Rome required the young men from their conquered countries to spend fifteen years, in service, as a soldier in the Roman army. After that time, they were free to go where they pleased.

In this film, Arthur is presented as a great knight and the leader of a band of very skilled soldiers.  His men, including Galahad and Lancelot, are all seasoned warriors and have fulfilled their duty to Rome. Just before they leave the army, they are advised that the Saxons are invading Roman territory and they are needed.  They are all battle weary, but forced to take up their weapons and go on one last mission.

Guinever is of course beautiful, and in this story, a capable warrior. One part was pure Hollywood, where during a battle scene, King Arthur and his knights are completely covered in armor and Guinever goes into battle with them wearing body paint and skimpy clothes. Aside from that bit of silliness, this is an interesting and well-done film. Clive Owen makes a great Arthur!",1158364800,7,1319,4.663793103448276

If I want a history lesson I would read a book NOT watch a movie.  It is almost impossible  to recreate a history of King Arthur when there is none  available that has been written in stone.  They are still looking for some truths.  Guess it was called the Dark Ages for that reason.  Great costumes, background, filming, and everything else.  Good plot, could have been longer, lots to see and digest. I found Lancelot the hero.  Very good acting and he is good looking as well. Arthur's other knights of the round table were very realistic they each did a great job.  The music score is what always sells me on a movie and this music score was very good.  Very fitting to the plot, simple yet emotional.  I thought Troy was a disaster until the music of Josh Groben caught my ear at the ending then I watched it again, that made the movie, not Brad Pitt. Same with King Arthur, first time around wasn't impressive until I heard the closing music during the credits which encouraged me to watch it again.  My judgement for buying a movie and ranking it highly is the ""Music"", to me that makes a film.

2145556,4,B0002YLCFQ,"Although the historical accuracy of this movie can be debated, as with everything, it should be noted that this is a much more realistic look at the historical possibilities that could have built the legend we all know and love.  Gone are the magic, the folklore and the love triangle infidelity that came with the fantasy tale of Excalibur.

Now don't get too upset and think this is a disrespectful `re-imagining' like the Sean Connery/Richard Gere debacle of the mid 90s, First Knight.  Although that was a decent movie, it tore apart the fabric of what made the story great.  In this movie, Merlin is a soothsayer, a madman of sorts with a large following of nature worshipers.  You can see how this could kind of person could be seen as some sort of Wizard or magician.  If he says he caused the fog to roll in and all his people back him up, most people will believe it, and the legend will grow into a tale of fantasy.

As with the love triangle with Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot; in this film it's done as a side note.  No wedding, no infidelity, no romance.  Just an obvious attraction between her and the two knights, obviously finding each of them appealing for different reasons.  The battles are intense and realistic, the cinematography and visuals of the landscapes are spectacular.  And the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is pounding and alive, probably one of the best he's done in years.

The performances by the three lead actors is solid.  Great interactions with Arthur and Guinevere, proving once again that Clive Owen is highly underrated and Keira Knightly is one of the most talented young actresses of the day.  Ian Groffold does a fine job as well displaying a personality in Lancelot we have never really seen.  It's a shame this movie didn't do better at the box office, but if it find life in DVD and rental, I will be happy that it got it recognition.

2145557,4,B0002YLCFQ,"The King Arthur Director's Cut is no better or worse than the theatrical, having the same strengths - some good character writing, action scenes where you can actually tell what is going on, an interesting background - and weaknesses - plot holes you could drive a Mack truck through, laughable historical errors, idiotic battle strategies and some hideously bad performances. The latter are definitely the biggest problem, with Antoine Fuqua proving more often than not truly hopeless at directing actors. Indeed, KA boasts some of, if not THE worst performances ever seen in a major studio picture. Clive Owen may look the part, but he delivers the lines like a dyslexic reading off idiot boards while fighting a hangover while Keira Knightley's Guinevere is just as pitiful: she's supposed to be a Celtic warrior queen but despite the fact that her people seem to speak Sioux for some reason she sounds like she's been to a rather expensive English finishing school where they teach you to mispronounce words like `cuhnntwee' (country) and `Roahm' (Rome). That wouldn't be so bad if she had even the remotest shred of talent, but none is to be found. Not since Helen of Troy have their been two leads so desperately in need of dubbing by more talented artists. Throw in Ken Stott doing an outta-ray-juss Ay-Taly-Eano accent, Ray Winstone overdosing on the bish-bash-bosh routine he does instead of acting these days and a couple of frighteningly inept child actors and it's a miracle that the film manages to be as much fun as it is.

This movie didn't do too well for one simple reason: it was easier for movie reviewers to portray a version of King Arthur based on TRUTH as un-fun.  After all, are you someone who likes magic swords and explosions and legend and romance, or someone who likes the History Channel???  Um.  Well, I like fantasy, but I love the History Channel, too.  This was a GREAT story based in truth.  Most historians agree that ""King Arthur"" was an amalgamation of several warriors and kings, but history shows that that something just like this movie actually occurred.  Whether the guy's NAME was ""King Arthur"" is debatable, but the basic plot of the movie did happen.

Someone reviewed this movie, saying there's no plot.  It's the rise of post-Roman Western civilization!!  Wake up!  It's interesting and dramatic!  So many people have no conception that Britain was once a Roman province inhabited by Romans, Celts, and a handful of tribes competing for dominance on the island.

The movie also cleverly shows how the ""myth"" of Arthur could have sprung from the truth of his life, exaggerated to the Nth degree.  (Lancelot is a ladies man, Merlin is a mysterious druid rather than a magician, Arthur did pull have to work to pull a sword out of a burial mound, etc.)

2145570,4,B0002YLCFQ,"This is not Malory's Arthur of shining armor and banners fluttering atop a castle of gold and silver......this Arthur is gritty, a soldier, and far more believable than most portrayals in more recent history.  I simply couldn't take the bloke who played Arthur in ""Excalibur"" seriously after seeing him as Prince John in ""Lion in Winter"" - spoiled it for me - Clive Owen as a soldier half Roman, half Brit with dreams about to be shattered into a thousand pieces torn by loyalties and perspective of his youth and the pressures and demands of his position as commander of the Sarmatian Knights at Hadrian's Wall.  Now this Arthur, Arthur Castius, did exist in history, but in the 200's, Arthur of legend was about 200 years later- I wasn't terribly impressed with the depiction of the Picts (Woads?!  Ehrm....OK.....yes, they did have woad painted on their bodies......but calling them Woads?  Hrmmm....) and I loved the Knights as depicted here.  Tristan, a distant and  brilliant soldier who looked at the life of a soldier as one to put his whole self into - to him there was a grace in his work, and it became an art to him - you could see this in every move of the actor portraying him.  Ioan Gruffydd was his fantastically handsome self, and the banter between him and Gwynhwyfar was fine, but not as real as I'd have liked.  The banter between Lancelot and Arthur was still less real to me as there wasn't much given to us in the film to help build up their relationship - yes, Arthur says to him at one point, ""You, who know me best of all...."" but we don't see this, it's never truly explored.  There was some discussion in other reviews about the character of Bors.  I hate to break it to the reviewer who had issue with the actor's portrayal of Bors; but if you have ever been in the military, you will know that there is always at least one Bors.  His character as a man hard as nails, yet passionately in love with the woman in his life and father by her of a dozen children.  He loves his fellow knights and will do whatever he has to in order to see them safe.  He seems a tough unfeeling bear of a man at first, but you see through his portrayal that he is in fact quite an emotional man whether he's pouring mead out to his dead comrade in arms or shouting at the unfairness of the Roman Bishop (Germanus) who has given them one last job to do.  Gawain was as handsome as you'd expect as was Galahad, though Galahad was portrayed with more youth, bordering on naivete.

Gwynhwyfar, played by Kiera Knightly, was a woman who could stand on her own two feet.  A woman of her race who would stand by the side of the men of her tribe as was the tradition.  She wasn't the cowering convent-flower as portrayed in so many books.  I wanted to see more development of any relationship between herself and Arthur.  There was some mild flirting between her and Lancelot, but mostly banter, nothing further.  Merlin as a Pictish leader wasn't as believable as I'd hoped he would be.  No, I didn't want to see the old man with the long white beard and pointy hat covered in stars and moons, but I did hope to see a man who had more to offer in the way of wisdom and leadership -

Throughout it all, I felt the film was stripped bare, and there was so much more that could have been shown.  The soldiers on their last days at Hadrian's Wall before being released to go anywhere they wanted to start their own lives, well, great story idea, but in that there's really only an average of 90 minutes to 2 hours for any given film (thanks to short attention spans) I'm mostly frustrated that there was so much more in the way of character development that could have been offered - Dagonet for example - not a very well known ""Knight"" as it were, but his quiet protective character was endearing, and made me want to know more about him, and why he took the small boy under his wing as he did.  Is this review a bit scattered?  That's largely because the movie is as well, but at the same time, history is equally scattered - watch the movie, but don't expect anything like the Camelot Medieval version of the Arthurian legend - expect instead to be entertained.  The actors did their job valiantly, and while I""d have loved to have seen Bishop Germanus take a spear or four, I thoroughly enjoyed myself watching this.",1147910400,10,4318,4.4

It may be somewhat inaccurate historically,  but the film is still really fun and the acting is excellent. You wil cheer for the heroes as they fight the Saxons in this film. Nothing else can really be said that hasn't but this worth seeing",1147737600,2,371,4.3768115942028984
2145572,5,B0002YLCFQ,"I have read the negative and positive reviews of this film, especially noting the numerous complaints about historical accuracy.  But considering the era from which this story is created, and the various possibilities regarding exact time and place of events, (if they ever occurred at all), I think the film is a truly magnificent, thought-provoking piece about King Arthur.

Bringing in the aspect of the Sarmatians was long overdue in the Arthurian arena. Although various historians may argue the point, much evidence does point to the use of stirrups by about 8000 Sarmatian cavalry in the Roman army as early as 175 AD. With the commonly held belief that the stirrup was not introduced until many centuries later, I thought it a bold move for the movie makers to incorporate this into the film as well. It seemed to be one of the most commonly noted 'discrepancies' by reviewers, but I disagree - it is very accurate.

If you have watched only the PG13 version of this film, by all means, please watch not only the Director's Cut version, but take the time to also watch/listen to Antoine Fuqua's narrative over the film. His narration explains a lot, especially about how they had to change things drastically to make the mandated PG 13 rating. His explanation regarding his version of Lancelot and Guinevere is quite a statement as well.

The alternate ending was quite dark, or perhaps even depressing, in a way.  I don't know which ending is more suitable, and actually would have liked to have seen perhaps a different ending altogether, just don't know what that would have been.

I thought the actors were incredible; the battle scenes (director cut) some of the only such scenes I've ever watched that let you identify the main characters' roles during the fighting; the photography was the best I have ever seen; the music illustrated and enhanced; and this movie left you wanting to see more when it was over.

There was no dwelling on use of special effects for blood and gore, or rediculous feats of super-power athletics, or campy remarks that would bring you immediately back to your own century.  The horses were not constantly being tripped during battle scenes, either. All these were a welcome change from so many movies of today.

Above all, it passed the real test of a great movie - it left you with 'a feeling' after it was over.

In short, I loved it.  Antoine Fuqua, you are a genius.",1146096000,165,2414,4.764988009592326
2145573,4,B0002YLCFQ,"King Arthur is a feast for the senses. The musical score and the cinematography are equally outstanding. The camera, along with the ebb and flow of the music, became additional actors, conveying great emotion, from the romantic blue snow scenes, to the dreaded drab hues of war.

The battle scenes were amazingly staged and executed to perfection. Especially the ice battle, which represented a flawless combination of computer generation, stunt work, and live action.

The casting was first-rate. I recognized each character before he was named, just by the sheer brilliance of the character's manners and clothing.

However, as someone who has studied the Arthurian Legends, I was rather disappointed in the billing of the movie as being historically accurate. There are just too many flaws in the movie to make it truly historical: from the time and placement of the battle of Mount Badon at Hadrian's Wall, to the use of stirrups. I understand and would normally not be bothered by the need for dramatic license ... except for the publicity and its insistence that this Arthurian Tale was the real deal!

I particularly disliked the happy-ever-after ending, which gave the film a Disney quality. The alternative ending (which can be viewed on the DVD as an outtake) was more keeping with the ""dark feeling"" of the movie. I was surprised that the director, although he did insert the blood and gore of war that was taken out of the PG-13 theatrical version, did not use the alternative ending on the DVD.

I saw the movie on the big screen, as well as the DVD director's cut, and both versions were worth the price ... especially if you forget about the history lesson, and enjoy the sheer beauty of the tale.",1144972800,6,1712,4.8493150684931505
2145574,4,B0002YLCFQ,"The movie is pretty good BUT watch the directors cut only, however, historically and geographically it's a bit awry.
YES there was a Romano-British warlord called Artorius Castus, YES 4000 Sarmatian heavy cavalry were sent to northern Britannia around 180 AD from southern Russia, it was part of a peace deal between Marcus Aurelius and the Sarmatians.  YES the sword religon was a Scythio-Sarmatian ritual of the sacred sword, blood, plunging it into the earth etc
However most of their desendents by the 450's AD (when the movie is set) when the romans left britain would have been native british, and half were thought to have left to fight with Constantine in Europe.
NO they wouldn't have worn armour as in the film.  The Picts were ORIGINAL peoples of northern britain (Scotti were immigrants from Dal Ria in North Ireland).  They may have worn blue (Woad) body paint as modern research has suggested it had antiseptic properties to protect against wounds, they did use composite bows and crossbows.  The romans invited in the Saxons as mercenaries against the Irish, Scots, Welsh (no such term as Celt then! thats an 18th century invention) and other Saxon raiders.  They rebelled when they weren't paid and took over southern britain, brought they're families over and the rest is history (evenually to become Aenglaland...England).  One of the biggest mistakes in the film though is that all the romano-british v saxon fighting took place in southern britain, not around Hadrian's Wall, and the final battle of Baden Hill is thought to be in south-western england.
But if you're not too bothered by that it's not bad, particulary the less sanitised Directors Cut version with the blood restored!

2145575,5,B0002YLCFQ,"I have seen every movie made based on the Arthurian legends, and read many, many books on the subject, that being said, I have several favorites, but this one is, by far, the best telling of the tale. This particular story is to me the most believable if you are searching for truths or near to them. It depicts a very different Guinevere, a strong capable woman, not a frail giddy young thing. This movie is steeped in legends and lore, you will see more of a reality of life from this time and it's affect on all it's peoples, the knights, thier families, thier lives. This movie takes you into this time and its' surroundings it is not only focused on Arthur and his Queen but has encompassed the life and times around them. Add to this a very refreshing perspective on Guinevere, perhaps a more believable one. This movie is definitely a fresh look of the telling of the tale, with exquisite costumes more befiting the era, and the actors I commend, it is as if they literally stepped back in time.

In every myth lies a bit of truth...

I highly recomend this movie to any that enjoy or study the Arthurian Legends. The movie quality is exceptional.",1142812800,,1154,4.464454976303317
2145576,5,B0002YLCFQ,"When most people think of the Arthurian legend, they think of things like knights in full suits-of-armor, magic, jousting and medieval castles.  To be sure, these motifs are straight out of the writings of Sir Thomas Mallory.  However, they are also anachronisms when juxtaposed with the original myth.

This film gets back to the roots of the myth, which date back to right around the end of the Roman occupation.  It also picks up on Arthur and his knights being descendents of Samarian knights, which is a plausible theory.  In short, the epoch portrayed in this movie served as the genesis of the legend of Arthur.  Whether or not the fellow ever actually existed is still a matter of speculation - even amongst historians with doctorates.

David Franzoni, the writer of GLADIATOR, once again displays his erudition as he mixes historical fact with fictional details.  There are some cool special features that entice one to admire the lengths they went to in making the sets and battle scenes / battle tactics as authentic as possible.  One leaves this movie feeling as though he or she was just in the middle of 5th century (CE) Britain.

Clive Owen is terrific as the noble Arthur. Hans Zimmer delivers yet another top-notch soundtrack.  The direction is excellent. Unfortunately, the Unrated label does not = Keira Knightley taking her shirt off.  However, she still looks very sexy in Celtic warpaint!

One of the most refreshing factors of the film is that it does not concentrate on the love-triangle.  That this is an important part of the myth is not in dispute.  However, some versions of the tale focus on the triangle to the detriment to the rest of the myth.  In this movie, things never get past some subtle flirting between Lancelot & Guinivere.

For fans of the legend, this movie is a can't miss. For people who desire to learn more about both British and Roman history, this movie is invaluable.  For everyone else, it's certainly worth seeing at least once.  Long Live King Arthur!",1141689600,15,2004,4.807017543859649

2145588,3,B0002YLCFQ,"This film is about as historically accurate as any Arthur movie, which is to say -- not very.

It's not ""your grandmother's"" King Arthur, to be sure, because it's not based on Thomas Malory as reread and recast by Tennyson, T. H. White, and the movie ""Camelot."" But it is not the ""real"" King Arthur either, whatever credentials a History Channel documentary may have given it. Consider only that the ""Sarmatian"" theory of the origin of Arthur's knights (followed here) traces them back to the second century, but this film clearly takes place 300 years later. Enough of history.

The movie therefore needs to be judged on its artistic merits, just like other films of King Arthur. There the record is mixed. Clive Owen makes a good King Arthur. He possesses the requisite mixture of gravitas and sex appeal. Keira Knightley is a little too sprightly to be believable as the warrior queen Guinevere, but she is not lacking in charm. Ioan Gruffudd is sexy enough to be Lancelot, but too little is made here of the love triangle. Stellan Skarsgard is admirably scary as the Saxon King Cerdic, with his growly voice and matted blonde locks. My candidate for worst contribution to the Arthurian story, however, must be Ray Winstone as Bors, whose meatiness and labored humor represents this film at its worst. This is ""Comic Relief"" with a capital C and a capital R. All that is missing is the laugh track. This kind of bald humor works better for a theme like ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" also directed by Jerry Bruckheimer. Bruckheimer's heavy hand is also felt in the battle scenes, which are heavy on gore and light on character or plot development.

Compared to other Arthur films, this one would rank above ""First Knight"" and ""The Mists of Avalon,"" but below ""Excalibur"" and ""Camelot."" It's worth seeing, but be glad it's too late to waste your $9.50 at the theater.",1140912000,3,1866,4.753086419753086
2145589,4,B0002YLCFQ,"Everyone knows the story of King Arthur and his Round Table. This movie tells the tale from Arthur's beginning and from his view point. It conveys the deep feeling and rapore among Arthur and his knights. It shows off Rome in it's arrogant state while the Saxon's are as dispicable as ever.

Clive Owen is extrememly credible as Arthur and his knights are terrifyingly real. The Saxon's are very hateful and make you cheer for the knights. Good old story well told here.",1140739200,,470,4.662650602409639
2145590,4,B0002YLCFQ,"As many people have already written, this movie is not a hammed-up fairy tale Arthurian legend which people are so often used to.  People who are expecting this may be disappointed by the film, or offended.  What I found particularly engaging about the movie, were the battle scenes:  They were so unique and different from battle scenes in other movies, because they showed Arthur in almost desperate situations, utilizing his wit and guile to win battles.  To me, this seems like exactly what the real Arthur must've done as all of the odds were stacked against him; and it also makes for good entertainment.  The tensions between Christianity and Paganism in that day and age were very real, no matter what some people wish to believe.  If it hadn't been so, then the Saxons wouldn't have been invading in the first place.  What I find far less plausible than the criticisms of Christianity in the movie is the idea that Arthur was really concerned about human rights.  I'm sure that the real, human Arthur was probably not much better than anyone else at that time.  Then again, after all, it's the movies.  What the creators of this film did was use the history we know about the real Arthur as inspiration for a highly entertaining and original new story.  This is not to devalue the classic, romantic Camelot stories with well-bathed druids and large, pretty, Edwardian-like medieval castles, but rather to provide something totally different.",1140652800,2,1450,4.877551020408164
2145591,3,B0002YLCFQ,"I've been itching to watch this movie ever since I've seen the ending a billion times (unintentionally) and my mother -- in spite of my disregard towards the film being ""lame""-- suggested I watch the movie to boot. Two years later and a few more ""ending"" viewings later, I finally swallowed my pride and watched the movie. That aside, I have to say that ""King Arthur: Director's Cut,"" isn't a horrible movie as I would believed it to be, it coming from Jerry Bruckhimer and all (their Disney joined movies ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and ""Remember the Titans"" are two favorites of mine ironically). It certainly takes a different path as opposed to all his summer blockbuster films of previous and present carnations. Instead ""Arthur"" takes the recently traveled path of the ""Gladiator"" and ""Braveheart"" road if anything. However, unlike GLADIATOR and BRAVEHEART the storyline for the movie is seriously lost in the blur of ""Based on actual events"" and is simply played out through a series of events that don't add up to what their supposed to. (Funnily enough the story for the film is even written by the same writer for ""Gladiator""). Venturing to a local Internet encyclopedia, I discover it is true that, yeah, the movie is full of inconsistencies of the historical kind, but what did anyone expect from a movie like this? If you drop the accurate history expectance, you'll enjoy the movie far more better. The narration at the beginning of the movie, --via Lancelot's disembodied voice--, sets the mood and upcoming tone of the film in general. Thus explaining the conquest of the Roman Empire and the recruiting of Sarmatian army and their sons as part of a bargain. Fast forward several years later, Arthur and his remaining Knights of the round table are riding across the plains of Britain towards a carriage in need of their help. This fight scene in particular is probably the best out of the whole lot of few action scenes in the entire movie. Plenty of blood and violence in this one scene to make me happy. Upon their arrival to Hadrian's Wall, Arthur's friend the bishop denies his men of their freedom for one last task concerning a Roman family in need of safe passage from the Invading Saxons. From there more talking (which isn't bad) and watching the remaining Knights trudge through some of the best shots of scenery of Ireland I've seen since ""Lord of the Rings (New Zealand),"" takes place. Honestly the movie is far too long and riddled with scenery shots for time fillers. Most of the time you'll be watching the Knights and Arthur riding at top speed on their horses. As for the addition or subtraction of scenes in this version of the film? If anything there are some scenes I've noticed in the film as opposed to the regular theatrical version (a certain Knight's death scene and others for instance) that were indeed better off left out.

Sometimes the editing of the scenes seemed a bit jarred or too quick to jump to the next scene at times. The latter action scenes were all right, but felt a bit forced into trying to make you feel like there were ""epic."" Moreso, the battles felt like something taken out of ""Xena: Warrior Princess,"" in which Xena was engaged in battle with Romans or Chinese soldiers, only with a bigger budget, better decapitation scenes, blood and other things required to make a battle dazzling on film. The sword fighting was a bit slow in my honest opinion. Sometimes the actors made me feel like they were teasing each other by smacking the tips of their blades with their sides. The actors themselves, thankfully were convincing in their roles of Arthur (Clive Owen), Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd), Gawain (Joel Edgerton), Tristian (Mads Mikkelsen), Galahad (Hugh Dancy), Dagonet (Ray Stevenson) and Bors (Ray Winstone). Unlike other ""Arthur/Knights of the round table"" character carnations who always looked as though they had hot and cold running water in their dingy castles, these knights are hardened battle weary warriors, not so clean looking and tough to boot. And ironically I've seen at least several of these men in films at one point of my earlier and latter adolescent life. The seven actors perform in their roles as knights very well. However, there are times when Clive Owen feels less convincing as King Arthur in certain moments of the movie. One in particular being the end of the movie where he weeps over Lancelot. The delivery of his words were borderlining lame and unemotional. Kira Knightley as Lady Guinevere was a bit arbitrary and most of the time unconvincing. No, she does not make a convincing warrior woman of the Woadish kind, her battle costume was less than flatterning. This character was completely useless given there are seven male actors to occupy your mind. Guinevere is basically misused and her character is introduced far too late into the movie to do anything significant to warrant mention (unlike like Xena whom people politely compare her to).

The entire the Arthur/Guinevere/Lancelot LOVE-TIRANGLE was NONEXISTENT to be blunt. There wasn't even any romance in the blessed film. The Lancelot/Guinevere scenes clearly implied that Gruffudd and Knightley had better chemistry together than Knightley and Owen did not to my indifference. The sex scene (which I promptly fast-forwarded) was another poor excuse for trying to make the audience feel there was an attraction between the two characters when there clearly was not. Plus in my opinion, sex scenes in general are a complete WASTE OF TIME in movies in all, espically in this one. Getting back on subject, the unofficial villains, the SAXONS (relatives of Vikings) were hardly ever shown throughout the film. And when they would pop up they did nothing but burn things or chant weakly during marches. The leader, Cerdic (Stellan Skarsg?rd) felt in appearance like an ideal 'bad guy' but never acted as one in my honest opinion when he opened his mouth. His showdown with Arthur was weak even. The son, Cynric (Til Schweiger) whose attire and braided goatee reminded me of a member of metalica, played an almost convincing 'bad guy', better than Skarsg?rd did anyway. The WOADS reminiscent of the Amazons of ""Xena,"" having been stuck with the ""dying nation"" shtick, were also misplaced in the storyline. Their presence along with the underused Merlin was perhaps, not unneeded persay, but never utilized properly. On a positive note the music composed by Hans Zimmer is absolutely a splendid joy to listen to. It does well replacing the usual BRUCKHIMER action theme to my delight. Another added plus was that I could really notice the tune used in the BATMAN BEGINS score. The song used at the end of the movie ""Tell Me Now (What You See)"" performed by Moya Brennan is very reminiscent of ""May it be"" by Enya, except it lacks in strength when the drums aren't beating through the chorus. On last action scene note: The frozen lake scene was done pretty good all things considered, the CGI was utilized and done well for the cracking of the ice. In closing, all in all, ""King Arthur"" is not a horrible movie by any means, but its not great either though. Its highly enjoyable when you get past the dry spots, forced chemistry, 'historical events' and lack of character development. Recommended action flick.

2145613,4,B0002YLCFQ,"The sadly underrated ""King Arthur"" provides a rip-roaring and original take on the classic Medieval legend.  The film is set in the brutal world of the 5th Century AD, right at the moment when the crumbling Roman Empire is turning inward and withdrawing its forces from far-flung outposts such as Briton, where barbarians from the north, sensing Rome's weakness, are beginning to make incursions into the regions south of Hadrian`s Wall.  In this version, Arthur's famous Knights of the Round Table are a compendium of conscripted tribesmen who have faithfully and courageously served the cause of Rome for the past 15 years.  Now, just at the moment when they are about to be granted their hard-earned freedom and are eager to return home, they are sent on a final dangerous mission deep into Saxon territory to rescue a boy who may be a possible successor to the Pope in Rome.

""King Arthur"" focuses more on the geopolitical aspects of the tale than the customary romance and magic - although neither of those has been completely slighted in this telling.  The film opts for a darker, more realistic treatment of the story - there's no talk of Camelot here - one in which, Arthur, Lancelot, Guinevere and the rest undergo internal conflicts and moral struggles often overlooked in earlier versions of the story.  Arthur, in particular, the product of a Roman father and a Saxon mother, is torn between his loyalty to Rome and to the island he calls home.  But, above all, he is faithful to the men who have served under his command and, with whom, he has been able to forge a chivalric code of ethics - one whose very cornerstone is individual rights and freedoms - that seems like an anachronism in a world dedicated to enslavement, brutality and destruction.  The violence in the film is grim, graphic and gory but appropriate to the times in which the movie is set.

David Franzoni has written an intelligent, dramatic screenplay, and Antoine Fuqua has directed the movie with flair and style.  The action scenes are vivid and intense, and the film features the best ice floe battle sequence since ""Alexander Nevsky.""  The acting - by Clive Owen as Arthur, Keira Knightley as Guinevere and Ioan Gruffudd as Lancelot - is no great shakes, but at least it's unobjectionable.

For the most part, the movie's attempts at de-romanticizing the legend work well - although turning Guinevere into a halter top-wearing, bow-wielding combatant on the order of a Boudicca or even Xena-Princess Warrior, does seem a bit much.  However, since the film is less a retelling of the Arthurian legends and more a chronicle of the ""real"" people on whom the characters were allegedly based, such re-imaginings are more forgivable than they might otherwise have been.  And like most actions films these days that don't seem to know when to leave well enough alone, ""King Arthur"" is saddled with a saggy third act whose repetitive battle scenes drain some of the life out of the story.

All in all, though, ""King Arthur"" emerges as a handsomely produced, thrilling tale of love, hope and freedom that should satisfy the schoolboy adventurer in all of us.",1133049600,3,3137,4.848314606741573

2145615,2,B0002YLCFQ,"I've never understood ""revisionist"" attempts at telling familiar legends. Just because a story is allegedly more fact-based doesn't make it more entertaining; on the contrary, it's been proven time and time again that the opposite is true. So exactly why director Antoine Fuqua (TRAINING DAY) and producer Jerry Bruckheimer chose to ""de-myth"" the tale of King Arthur is a mystery-one that I don't care enough to solve, in light of the disappointing results.

The film showcases what may be the most uncharismatic King Arthur in cinema history (played by the usually reliable Clive Owen). Does it matter that Arthur is presented as a 5th-century British-born Roman general, in accordance with the limited historical data available? Likewise, the familiar characters of Sir Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd) and Lady Guinevere (Keira Knightley) are deglamorized to the point of being shallow and unsympathetic. Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't we supposed to be rooting for them?

If we are to take it on face value that this is a more accurate depiction of the era than we've ever witnessed before, then they must have had one hell of a dental program back in the 5th-century, judging from the pearly-white smiles of the lead players. And how about that bare-midriff action-hero outfit Guinevere wears during the final battle sequence? Based on historical record, no doubt.

In addition to its confused plotting and excessive noise level, KING ARTHUR is one of the grimmest and grimiest-looking major studio productions since Tim Burton's BATMAN RETURNS. And yet the distributor had the nerve to use the tag line ""From the producer of PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN"" in the marketing campaign. The colorful and engagingly offbeat PIRATES was lively fun for the entire family, and to have used its success to promote a movie as dull and unpleasant as KING ARTHUR was a great disservice to unsuspecting parents and children.",1132876800,7,1909,5.131832797427653

2145630,4,B0002YLCFQ,"It's a lot like the recent Jet Li film entitled 'Hero', which is a loose interpretation of historical events that are profoundly important to Chinese culture. 'King Arthur' is analogous in this respect because it is a liberal interpretation of a legend that is wildly popular around the world and has shaped the entire world culture in many ways, throughout the centuries until present day. As the saying goes, all myths are based on a grain of truth, so there's obviously something to it, but how accurate is the knowledge that we have, nobody can say for sure, but at least this version is more plausible than previous, fantastical versions. That aside, what matters is that movie is truly entertaining in more ways than one.

The Romans were accurately portrayed and seemed rather decadent and conspiritorial as they were infamous for.

As far as I could tell, judging by historial references, the Saxons were fairly represented. Their battle prowess was not in question, nor was their bravado. Without a doubt they were portrayed as being formidable foes, but obviously they were not going to succeed in defeating the ultra-talented knights of the round table and King Arthur himself.

I wholeheartedly recommend this film to everyone, especially those who appreciate a great war film with some romance and comedy thrown in for good measure. It is definitely one of the better films I've seen, and what can I say, I'm a big fan of the period, not to mention the myth behind the legends.

This film is a perfect example of how a film does not need world renowned film stars to be a quality product. Too many films are sold simply on the fame associated with a name, but in this case the outstanding professionalism that went into all aspects of the film production sells itself to audiences world wide. Kudos to Jerry Bruckheimer for having the guts to take a chance with a relatively unknown cast and forging ahead with a rather ambitious project that turned out to be surprisingly good, far more so than the mediocre 'Troy' and the abysmal 'Alexander'.

The director's cut is definitely gory, but not gratuitously so. It perfectly complemented the film's overall theme. I wish more films within this genre would follow in this direction.",1131840000,,2242,4.858638743455497

2145633,2,B0002YLCFQ,"As a grad student in medieval history, let me first say that this movie's announced intention seemed intriguing.  Then I saw the film.  My hopes for a decent, responsible historical revision were smashed by its crass attempt at appearing revolutionary, innovative, and important.

The majority opinion is that Arthur, if he existed at all, was likely a Romanized Briton who fought against the slowly rising tide of Angle, Saxon, and Jute immigrants (many of whom were actually hired as mercenaries by the resident Britons to defend against Picts, etc.  He would more likely have lived toward the end of the fifth century, or the beginning of the sixth; the Roman legions evacuated around the beginning of the fifth century.

Regarding the choice of Sarmatia (against one far-off vassal of Rome was as good as another), it makes no sense that the Roman Army would send such a small contingent so far afield from their origin, especially considering their utility against the Parthians.  It would have been logistically irresponsible.  Plus, Sarmatians would have fallen under the control of Constantinople; the Eastern emperors would likely not have sent useful auxillaries to the Western fringe, to their own military detriment.

Most horrendously, the film makes a gross mockery of the Church.  While some might enjoy this, it is almost completely inaccurate, historically.  (1) The bishop is shown in a most disrespectful and inaccurate manner; clearly the director/producer wanted to take a hit at the Catholic clergy with this movie.  (2) Also, the Church did not resort to forced conversions, at least in the manner demonstrated in the film.  The Church had only a century before come around to accepting the justifiability of warfare and capital punishment when carried out by Christian rulers.  Torture didn't enter into accepted ecclesiastical practice until several centuries later, and then only in extreme inquisitorial cases.  Furthermore, the inquisitorial procedure, we know it, was only initiated in pursuit of heresy under Innocent III, who reigned from the end of the 1100's to early 1200's.  (3) The armies of the Roman Empire in the West did not serve the pope.  There were no such things as ""papal armies"" at this time.  There were odd, rare occasions that popes would lead defensive measures in the vicinity of Rome itself, but the popes did not send out pontifical armies to squash resistance, either political or doctrinal.  This is terribly anachronistic.  (4) Just as the popes did not have armies to enforce their will throughout the western half of the Empire, nor did they have the authority to make liberal, nepotistic land grants throughout the breadth of the Empire, as the movie portrays.  This would be a dangerous act for any pope to take, considering both the reigning emperors in Rome itself (last was deposed in 476, long after troops were pulled from Britain), and the reigning emperors in the East, who lasted until 1453.  And to argue on the basis of the Donation of Constantine is also anachronistic, as it dates from the mid to late eighth century.

All in all, this movie's claim to historical accuracy is null and void.

It is at least enjoyable for the martial violence and occasionally cheesy effects.",1130198400,31,3247,5.06203007518797
2145634,2,B0002YLCFQ,"_King Arthur_ purports to set the historical record straight, making Arthur (Artorius) a Romano-British Legion Commander in charge of a band of ""knights:""  warriors from a conquered middle-eastern tribe, the Sarmatians, renowned for heir horsemanship.  Stationed in the north of Britain, near Hadrian's Wall,  they defend the land from the Saxon Threat and marauding bands of blue-painted natives, or ""Woads,"" under tribal leader Merlin.

As a fantasy movie, _King Arthur_ was really pretty enjoyable.  The hero is struggling with the usual fantasy choice between loyalty to a country and loyalty to his inner sense of what is right, discovering along the way that the country he serves is not what he thought and the ""savages"" he's been fighting so long are more noble than some of his own people. Although this means that every time Clive Owen opens his mouth he's delivering some variation on Henry V's ""Saint Crispin Day"" speech, it makes for a good enough plot device. The sets and costumes are well done;  there are some exciting battle sequences and lovely visual imagery.  Even as Arthurian interpretation, this movie wasn't bad.  There's plenty of historical evidence that Arthur was, in fact, a legion commander under just such circumstances.  And I really liked the portrayal of Merlin and Guinevere as Picts--although I thought the movie could have made much better use of both of them.

However.  If you're going to present something as history, revisionist or otherwise, you really need to get your details straight, and there was so much wrong with _King Arthur_ in this department that I spent a good part of the film groaning.  For example:  in the fifth century, the crossbow hadn't yet been invented.  Even if they had, the Saxons wouldn't have used them, because they considered anything but hand-to-hand combat cowardly.  The Saxons didn't raid to the north--the Wall was to keep the Picts at bay, not Raiders--and they didn't raid in winter.  Nor did they come in large organized armies bent on conquest.  A Roman villa would never have been built north of the Wall, which marked the boundary of the Empire.  And why would a band of Indentured Sarmatian knights have names from 15th century French Romances?

I'm firmly of the opinion that much folklore and legend has root in historical events.  The Matter of Britain is a complex tale and probably had complex roots.  _King Arthur_ oversimplified them and eliminated any reference to possible causes except the names.  By the end of the movie I was left wondering how such a moving story could have come from such banal source material.

I'd like to see a historical Arthur done well some day, with the attention to detail and character that it deserves.  This wasn't it, but it's an okay movie as long as you can ignore the names.",1130112000,11,2805,4.931769722814499

I never found time to see the movie at the local googolplex, but I drove 45 miles from Metropolis to Palookaville to buy the director's cut of King Arthur.. It's eye candy for a dull Sunday evening.

So I'm flipping channels on TV and see that Clive's sword opera is on one of the movie channels. I decide to watch because I, well, Clive is Clive.

Amazing but theatrical release made more sense and seem a bit grittier than the so-called ""Director's Cut"". For one, it was less of a femmy fan-bait piece of drool.  The DC cut out Bors talking about the gargantuan size of his ""Manhood""....cut out Bors saying he had to go ""relieve himself""... the whole scenes that those were in. Can't have that now can we? Focused demographic research likely showed that the target audiences (fan-bait) wanted less soldier talk and more angst. So... the director is told how to cut for max bucks.

Lamest has to be the slash-bait straight outta fan dreams rearrangement of the Artie/Gwen scene.

Theatrical Cut: Artie sees that the bad bishop has broken his Limited Edition Pelagius Frisbee. Artie is distressed. Someone bangs on his door. ""Ding dong Saxons calling"". Artie goes to wall,  decides to stay and fight. Leaves wall. Has some strong words with Lance.  Gwen in my grandma's sheers goes to Artie's room and gives him her hero's welcome to the Wide World of Woad.  Then in a scene sure to go down in the annals of cinema as rival to ""the beach"" in ""From Here to Eternity"", the scene dissolves to the next morning and Artie alone at the crest of the mount, holding his standard upright, banner flying. He shoots! He Scores!

Extended Edition Cut: Artie brooding sans Frisbee. Gwen in sheers parts the sheers. Knock Knock. Saxons Calling. Both go to wall. Lance makes broody dark face when Artie says he's staying. Lance does meaning-laden not nice look to Gwen. ""You ain't woman enough to take my man"" (subtextual of course). Then Artie and Lance have meaningful words. Then the hill, standard, banner, etc etc...We never do find out if the interruptus became completus, or if Artie and Lance decided to patch things up while Gwen went to sew herself into her leather trousers and have a mad field-day with the Mary Kay Blue liquid eye-shadow.

From this woman's perspective, it was a bad move by Fuqua, but maybe the studio told him to and the $$ were too much to resist..

Characters: Clive Owen as Artorius (Arthur) was pretty good in a role where he was stuck between a serious rock and a hard place. Guinevere played by Kiera Knightly was a character that begged for more detail and depth but never got it. The other members of the round table all kind of blended together and it takes some serious effort to tell them apart. The exception was Bors who was by far the best character in the movie.

Cinematography: Editing was well done, especially since the huge battle scenes take so much angle cutting to make them believable. The scenery and setting was pretty well done except for the over-use of smoke and fog. I understand they were going for mood and ambience but it just got tiring after a while trying to peer through the smoke.

Right at the start, they get the date of Rome's departure from Britannia. By the 450's Roman troops had already evacuated the island, they were fighting for their lives trying to defeat Atilla's rampaging hordes. The Pope didn't issue military orders and the Bishop Germanus character was an out and out prop for the anti-Christian, pagan revisionist lala philosophies of Bruckheimer & that hack Manfredi. It is especially an injustice because the character is based on the bishop of the same name (known today as St. Germaine) who went to Britain around that time and it was he who rallied the Britons & Romano-Britons to fight off a combined attack of the Picts (they weren't called Woads like this imbecile screenwriter calls them. ""Woad"" was the bluish dye they tattooed and painted themselves with...if they can't get something that's common knowledge like the Picts right, what else is wrong?) and Saxons. And what Italian Romans would be living almost underneath Hadrian's Wall at that time? And monks torturing the villagers?

The idea that Arthur was Roman goes against everything we've ever learnt about this possibly real, possibly mythical man. The beloved myth of ""The Once and Future King"" is one that has many important themes in it from which we're supposed to learn deep truths about honor, loyalty, love, irony, fate, etc., (as Joseph Campbell discusses in depth), and these themes remain, whether told in Malory or T.H. White, or in the Mary Stewart ""Merlin"" trilogy. None of those themes are present in this muddled movie, leaving one unsure of what is going on. We should have very clear ideas of who people are and why they're fighting whomever it is they're fighting, why the Round Table was so significant, all the more so because this is being advertised as the ""real"" historical Aruthur. If one is purporting to be making an historical, rather than mythical, version of this story, then getting things like dates and place names correct would seem self-evidently important. For instance, Arthur, were he a Roman soldier, would be named Artos; his men would not have Celtic-derived names such as Gawain, Galahad, Tristan, nor the French Lance-let (Lancelot). And the only Emperor of Rome who truly subdued Britannia was Maximus, 383-388, who came, conquered, fell in love with the land, stayed, ruled, then fought at Rome's doorstep to keep them off the island. He was killed, and as a result, the Empire removed finally to Constantinopolos. There is no apparent reason for making all these people into the mythological characters so beloved if you're going to change every single thing about their stories. Why not write an original script? With original names? And it should be accepted by the movie makers that no one can tell such ancient history ""for real."" Even the myths have changed over time, as Lancelot didn't enter the myth until Arthur had been long-established. His presence was a romantic addition that came centuries later. Mary Stewart's research (which she documents well in her books) therefore takes the ""lover"" who brings down the Kingdom via Mordred (Arthur's illegitimate son), and makes him not Lancelot, but rather Arthur's best friend from childhood, Bedwyr. My point is, that when dealing with what can only be one's own take on a story, a consistent point of view is necessary, and this just doesn't exist in ""King Arthur."" Never mind calling it ""historical""; just be consistent, would be my request. But many historical things are known, such as the existence of the Picts and the Saxon invasion from the South. To get those wrong in a ""true story"" is sort of like saying that early English settlers came to the New World and discovered Australian Aboriginals. Whatever story you write about those who landed, you should at least get right the names of the Natives who were here when your characters landed.

The Romans were supposedly driven out (by Bodicea--spelling?), and were done so long before any version of Arthur existed but in all the versions of his story, he is portrayed as having been the first truly British King, uniting Britain for the first time since the Romans left, bringing peace and an end to tribal fighting, rather than another Roman General in charge of this farthest bit of the Empire, as Clive Owen plays here (at least that what he seems to be, as I said, who he is, exactly, is very confusing). Whether he was a war-lord or the mystically created Artos for whom Merlin exerted all his efforts to bring into being specifically for England, any movie about him should take a specific point of view and make it clear. In this one, Merlin is there, but not as Arthur's ""magician"" and advisor. I'm not sure who he is in this movie, actually, or what his function is, but it seems to be anti-Arthur, which just is crazy-making. In all versions of this story, Arthur is born of the Duchess of Cornwall by Uther Pendragon, while she is married, and so deep is this belief that her castle, where Arthur was supposedly conceived, Tintagel, is still one of the most visited sites in Cornwall. Arthur's father, Uther Pendragon, King of England, was considered to have been the last ""Roman-trained"" king, but even he was never called Roman.

Central to all tellings of the story is Guinivere and the love triangle between her and her husband the King, and her lover and his best friend, Lancelot or Bedwyr. All of this is gone, but we don't get a meaningful replacement for the drama of that situation. And to have the girl running around barely clad and a warrior is straight out of Xena, where the Amazons wore bras and miniskirts and could have been killed with a pocket knife. This choice is especially bewildering--more so even than the choice of making Guinevere a fighter in the first place. The least they could have done is put in her into warm clothes; while the men are in fur to their eyeballs on an icy plain, she fights in a see-through, sleeveless dress, without even wearing goosebumps. It's ridiculous.

Clive Owen is quite a good actor--he's a very compelling presence--but he seems unsure of himself here, as though even he's not certain who he is or what his own point of view is. Owen can make up for a certain amount of poor storytelling, in ""Beyond Borders"" for example, where the movie is not up to the weight of its subject matter, but here he just can't seem to lift the film up out of the ever-present mud.

I was left wondering why King Arthur had been dragged into this story at all. If you want to make a movie about Roman soldiers fighting--well-pick a group, there were plenty to choose from--then make one. The Arthurian legend is not called a ""legend"" for no reason. It's a precious one to the English; the mythology is deeply embedded in the country's consciousness, and is actually part of why the idea of the monarchy never quite goes away. The idea that he will come again, Arthur, the truest British King who ever lived, is a myth that still hasn't died.

If a movie-makers want to explore the realities that went into building that myth, who can blame them? It's a fascinating puzzle. But this hodge-podge of out-of-context fact and traditionally inspirational fiction isn't much of success, on any level. And sadly, it's a waste of good acting talent and what was obviously genuine devotion to the project.",1125619200,8,6804,4.772495755517827
2145655,1,B0002YLCFQ,"For one thing, I am not very fascinated by the Arthur legend. I am more capativated by Beowulf or The Odyssey, tales with epic scale and human cores. But with Arthur, I don't feel it as much, and to get a movie about it done so poorly lowers all hopes for it. As if to insult the intelligence of the audience, Keira Knightley's Guinevere is put on the cover of the posters and DVD, as if the audience could not see the fact that she has about 30 minutes of screen time, thereby making her not a major character. Using someone as gorgeous as her to make money as part of advertisment is insulting; there's no getting around this one. I thought Clive Owen made a good Arthur, but he could not save this atrocity. The battle sequences were a great example of LOTR battle envy and style over substance, something an epic movie should avoid.

Just because a new `opinion' is published based on a few records and artifacts does not make this story fact or could even justify comments like `The real King Arthur' or `Setting the record straight'.  No one knows for sure. This movie is just taking a different viewpoint.

Even taking out the historical issue out for a moment, I struggled to enjoy this movie. The constant speeches by Arthur about life, liberty, freedom and the British way (oh, so that is where the Americans got it from :) ) were so out of place it was painful to watch. Did the writers forget this was set in the 5th century?  What made the scenes worse was just how wooden they were delivered by Clive Owen. I have not seen this actor in any other movie so can not comment whether he just had bad material or he was out of his depth.

The early battle scenes were mind numbing.  Arthur and his 5 knights defeat the 100+ strong Woad army. Archers are hitting their mark perfectly from over 100 yards and the Knights fire back into the forest whilst at the gallop, never missing.

Overall, it was watch-able, but not enjoyable.",1125619200,,1199,4.422727272727273

But apart from all this ""added"" scenes, there are also some scenes that weren't on this edition. From what i understand from a ""Director's Cut"" Edition, there are always some scenes added to the movie, but this one has some scenes removed.

2145679,5,B0002YLCFQ,"Quite simply, I found this movie to be the best film of 2004. Now, that is a significant claim, considering it was up against Spiderman 2 and the various Academy Awards-type fare that the self-proclaimed Hollywood elitist critics support.

This rendition of King Arthur was like a breath of fresh air. I remember when I started watching it for the first time (I did not see it in the theaters). My initial thought was, ""What in the heck is this?"" I, too, have only known the more popular version of King Arthur. Then I got drawn into the movie. I found the action to be very entertaining, and I liked the conflict that Arthur felt and was portrayed on screen. I thought the whole Guinevere thing was a little too hokey, and the movie actually would have been better had her ""warrior princess"" role been removed. The battle on the ice was great! Finally, the musical score is outstanding, and sounds really great when it is pumped through my home entertainment system.

Summed up, King Arthur is one of only two movies released in 2004 that I have no problems watching over and over, again.",1124582400,,1089,4.579487179487179
2145680,4,B0002YLCFQ,"This 2004 rendition of ""King Arthur"" reflects the old English version of his legends.  The DVD certainly offers an action packed interpretation for the king, his knights, and the history of late Roman Britain.

Setting aside Mallory's later French influence the movie makers introduce the Sarmatian legends blending them into Arthur's story.  This mix gives the movie an exciting note of uncertainty (because Sarmatian beliefs are not generally known and one doesn't know how Arthur and his band will end up).

Owen (Artorius) and Knightly (Guinevere) give great performances.  Artorius is a loyal Roman torn between his duty to serve Rome and his desire to save Britain from invasion.  Guinevere is an arrow-shooting warrior with a firm will to convince Arthur that Britain is worth more to him than Rome. In the end they marry out-of love for country and each other.  Gruffudd plays a more likeable Lancelot (much like his earlier Hornblower work) than the knight's bigger-than-life Franco version.

The screen play is refreshing, without the usual French overlay.  Guinevere and Lancelot are not lovers.  Gawain is a leading knightly presence. And a host of new knights (not named in the original English legends) take their place at the Round Table.  Thankfully, Morgan le Fey and Mordrid do not appear in this picture and the Battle of Mt. Baden is the beginning (not the end) of Arthur's reign.  I did miss the old English legend Percival character.

The movie history appropriately follows the late 4th C. time frame.  (Arthur was not a medieval character.)  Its use of the known weaponry, uniforms, Roman & Celtic culture, and a few idiom  from the era are striking.  The fighting Celts, led by Merlin, are accurately painted blue.  Arthur's men use the gladius (sword).  The snowy elements play a noticeable role (I shivered with the actors as they fought Saxons atop an iced-over river) in winning the battle.  English Roman towns are given high walls and luxurious baths.  The knights of the Round Table travel atop rocky Roman roads. And Artorius wears Roman armor while riding an armored war stallion into battle.

This movie is recommendable to any history buff, historical video library, or King Arthur connoisseur.  Also, those interested in the historical Artorius, Roman Britain, or the English world of late antiquity will want to own a copy.",1124323200,,2361,5.0595854922279795
2145681,2,B0002YLCFQ,"First of all, let me say that I am a fan of these types of movies.  Medieval/ancient world/fantasy epics do indeed stir my blood and my imagination.  However, I must say that this movie is at best mediocre and at worst poorly acted.  The actors were either wooden or overacting.  None of the heroic characters are particularly likeable, and the villians are wooden and the dialoge hokey.  Did I mention the plot is  both predictable and unbelieveable at the same time?  There are also many plausibility errors.  And who the heck are the ""Woads?""  I assumed they were either Celts or Picts until I learned otherwise.

The sad part is that there is a very good story idea waiting to happen.  I know a little about Arthurian myth and the real individuals that inspired the myth.  However, there is a real leap from what may have happened (this is the first time I've ever heard of the ""Sarmatain"" tribe) to what the filmmakers portray on film.  It could have been a very moving tale.  However, it was poorly executed. For having claimed to be based on history, they did a poor job of getting their history right.

And why the **** did all the ""romans"" (all the nobles anyway) sound like really badly done pizza chef's???

It does accurately point out how the Romans basically used extortion as a tool for their army recruiting and ho loosly they would honor their contracts.  Also much credit is due to the costum design.

2145706,3,B0002YLCFQ,"This movie is either hated or loved, I guess you as the viewer will have to take the pick. I myself thought it was nothing special from all the other King Arthur movies made. They tried I guess to make the movie different this time by hacking out a lot of the old story that has repeatedly been done on so many other movies and they thought this would make it better. Honestly it really didn't. It just made King Arthur fans like I disappointed and somewhat bitter. I can understand they wanted to make it a little different but it didn't seem right all the things they changed.
A lot of it seemed unreal and totally barren. Like Merlin, why is it you see him so little, when in the other Arthur films he is the main star? And Arthur hated him in this film, instead of considering him a true friend like in the other films? One of the largest reasons I liked the King Arthur story was because of Merlin. You do not see him though hardly ever in this film though so don't expect him to be. And Guniverye (I can never spell that name right) she was very unrealistic in this film for many reasons. I know they wanted a strong female image but back then women, especially half- starved women with a wounded hand did not fight alongside men. That was very unrealistic. Then the whole essence of passion in the love triangle of Lancelot and Arthur with G. was so vague in this film, when it was supposed to be one of the biggest problems in the whole story. They hacked a lot out of this story definitely, a lot of the stuff that made the story of King Arthur so popular in the first place. So yes, the movie loses major points on this. And the other thing is again, even with all those changes I may have enjoyed the movie nonetheless if the changes were interesting, which they weren't. They were changes that made once a fascinating, mystical legend just to me another historic movie with a few battle scenes, a few words of honor, and then the credits. And since I do enjoy historic movies, I thought this one was all right, it isn't terrible, but it was nothing worth watching again.
There has been better historic movies, and definitely better King Arthur films so I advise watching this movie once, and take your decision of it. Then watch an original story of King Arthur in film. Then you decide which is better. The modern tale, or the original tale. It probably will be a different opinion for everyone, but honestly I prefer the original.",1123372800,,2444,4.373626373626373
2145707,1,B0002YLCFQ,"In the beginning the movie cites new historical evidence to contradict the Arthurian myths and legends.  That sounded like a movie that I would really be interested in as I had done some reading on this subject and new none of it was likely.  I would love to know what historical evidence supports this movie.

First off the screenplay writer defends his research with works by Linda Malcor.  Linda Malcor is highly regarded as a historical crackpot.  The Arthur she cites almost certainly lived 200-300 years prior to this movie's time frame.  The Arthur presented in this film is not plausible at all.

What research did he use to have the Saxons invade from the north.  It is a historical absolute that the Saxon invasions came from the south and the east.  Why on earth would they come from the north when the Celts would have decimated them at that time?

More credible historians using actual history believe that Arthur was a Welt or Brit chieftain who put together a small kingdom.  In fact they believe they may have excavated his original home.

As for the religious depiction of this film it is shaky at best.  Although the Catholic Church was very corrupt, hence the reformation, it is highly unlikely that the corruption started this early in time.  This is more of a depiction of the Spanish Inquisition.

Here are a few questions:

How can a woman starved nearly to death with a badly broken hand shoot arrows and fight better than men twice her size?

Why do all of Arthur's knights have Germanic names not Samatian names?

Why does Arthur talk so much about freedom and non slavery when those concepts did not exist at that time and would not for a long long time?

Why does Arthur become so chivalrous when that too would certainly not exist for several hundred years?

Why do barbarians recognize signs of truce and not kill the only person that could possibly oppose them?

Its obvious comparisons to the Mel Gibson epics ""Braveheart"" and ""The Patriot"", the radical departure from mystical elements of the legend and the film's lack of the infamous subplot of sexual betrayal between Lancelot and Guinevere.

But if you liked ""Braveheart"" and ""The Patriot"" possibly you can embrace this version of Arthur and see it in that context. I love the whole Arthur myth and its epic scale of story-telling which in a lot of ways bugged me when I watched this new version but when I was able to separate the two as different entities I began to see what the filmmakers were trying to make.

What you get is a steadfast leading performance by the much under-rated British import Clive Owen as a struggling leader who in constant conflict between his moral code and what is right. He is a flawed leader and Owen is brilliant as this legendary but flawed man.

I also really loved the performance from Ioan Gruffudd, who starred in those brilliant Horatio Hornblower films on A&E. Gruffudd's Lancelot seems to be cocky and gallant on the outside but lost in the inside. It is a brilliant performance because we see a lot more in this man than the script allows.

Arthur's supporting knights including Hugh Dancy of ""Ella Enchanted"" and Ray Winstone of ""Cold Mountain"" who each have their own moments in the film. Winstone's Bors is hilarious, tender and boisterous all in the same moment which makes him a fan favorite.

Some of the problems I had with the film, without the obvious ones pertaining to the change in the subject matter, come from the performances of Keira Knightley and Stellan Skarsgard.

Knightley's gung ho warrior princess works in certain situations but lacks in others. I never once for a moment believed in her connection with Arthur. In part you probably can partially blame the filmmakers since their love scene is pretty pathetic as love scenes go. I also found that her character lacked the necessary depth and fleshing out to be effective with all these other beautifully flawed performances. I won't even get into her warrior wardrobe.

I was also disappointed with Skarsgard as Cerdic, the overtly hairy leader of the Saxons. I felt that he wasn't menacing enough or roguish enough to lead such a vast army. He almost came off as a clown. I felt that the portrayal of his son, Cynric (Til Schweiger) was more effective. You could tell that the filmmakers wanted the Saxon leader to be ruthless and sadistic but it never reached its blood-thirsty fruition. You should have wanted to drool at the fact that he and Arthur would square off.

I enjoyed this version of Arthur but I still remain a purist at heart. It is interesting, entertaining and a romp of a good time. Speaking of updates, how about a realistic update on ""Robin Hood"" without Kevin Costner?",1121299200,3,2849,4.7414141414141415

Keira Knightley seems to have left the set of Pirates of the Caribbean and on to this one. She reminds me of Orlando Bloom where she over acts her role.

This is an MTV world movie made for an MTV world. Why not just have  Guinevere possess excalibur and be done with it? Don't even bother with it. Stupid, stupid, stupid.

2145726,2,B0002YLCFQ,"Hollywood has always been at war with itself when it comes to historical blockbusters.  On the one hand, it is obsessed with historical accuracy, down to the last detail on armor; on the other, it is determined to produce a story that will draw in the crowds.

King Arthur tries, but fails, to reconcile the two pulls.  The drama takes place at Hadrian's Wall in Northern Britain, as the Roman Empire begins its retreat from colonial outposts.  The Romano-British commander Arthur, played by Clive Owen, leads a band of Sarmatian knights in protecting the abandoned people from the hordes of invading Saxons.

You can't argue with the basic premise of the underdog versus the evil attackers.  Director Antoine Fuqua and his cinematographer Slawomir Idziak are at their best in scenes where the warriors are either expecting battle or in the midst of it.  The crack of ice and the fire of arrows have a beauty in of themselves - never mind the people within it.

The letdown comes in the script.  To believe in a historical hero, you must build audience empathy, and Arthur is unfortunately a little too noble for any human man.  His band of men are a joking lot, but also sketchily drawn, and Guinevere appears to act as a spokesperson straight out of an American independence tract.  Gone is any tension between Arthur and Lancelot, replaced by a disappointing coda to the action.

The legends of Arthur may well have been founded in historical facts, but the legend of Arthur is resilient for a number of themes that strike deep: betrayal of a friend for love, courage in the face of certain doom, and the limitations of violence to contain violence.  King Arthur could have been improved by playing up these elements - the death of Arthur and a retreat of survivors to Wales would have retained historical truth - without losing its vision.",1121040000,2,1843,4.7578616352201255
2145727,4,B0002YLCFQ,"I would have to say I enjoyed this movie and historical version of an Arthur we don't know.  Let's face it, although the original version of Arthur is a good one it seems more like a tale of fantasy than historical acuracy.  This version to me at least exept for Guinevere in the leather strap warrior bikini, seems more likely to have some accuracy.  They did leave in the part about pulling the sword out, except it was out of a grave and not a stone.  But I think it is more possible that Arthur was indeed just a captain appointed by the Roman Empire on a far outpost, the knights were more like a band of warrior brothers conscripted from the lands and were a little rougher on the edge than the clean cut knights of arthurian tales.

As for the whole Christian bashing thing people need to just chill.  Arthur did not give up on his christian beliefs to become a pagan, he did give up on believing in a Rome that was just an idea and not a reality.  Can you honestly say that what history points out about ancient Rome being a little sinister, greedy, a little inhumane maybe is wrong?  Did they not set out to conquer the world.  Did they not use religion as a tool?  Does the Roman Catholic church have a few blemishes on its record?

So overall realize that the story of Arthur or Arturius Castus in this movie is not the Arthur you know.  But according to some recent findings and in my mind a ""whats most likely"" reasoning I think this movie can prove to by more accurate.  I think Clive Owen did a good job in this movie playing a character whose in torn between duty, brotherhood, and a belief system which is challenged and broken down piece by piece.",1121040000,2,1665,4.298076923076923
2145728,5,B0002YLCFQ,"A twist on the many Arthurian movies, focusing on the Historical context where Arthur was likely a Roman leader of some sort who stayed when most of Rome fled. Quite gritty for the faint of heart but realistic in its battle scenes.  Moves fast. Good characters and a fine climatic battle at the end.

Lancelot played by the same actor who played Horatio Hornblower.

Director's cut more interesting as it shows the movie ending and the director's preferred ending which is a bit less glory glory we rule attitude.

If you want more of the faerie tale telling of this, either read T.H. White's THE ONCE AND FUTURE KING and see EXCALIBUR, which has a very small acting role for Liam Neeson as Sir Gawaine.

Let's face it most of us love the romantic version of Camelot and the romance of Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot and the magic of Merlin this turns all that on its head and for most people that's hard to take. Its like they've ruined a favourite fairy tale. This film aims to tell the story from a historical point of view and not from a legend. I found parts of it riveting and interesting that's why I gave it four stars. If you want the romantic version you will hate this movie but If you're opened to a different point of view of Arthur you will love this movie.",1120435200,2,717,4.128571428571429
2145730,3,B0002YLCFQ,"This is nearly the best Roman epic and the best Arthur film, but it's let down very badly by the horrible casting. Clive Owen is at his very worst here, with his patented flat vocal delivery - like a bored photocopier salesman demonstrating a clapped out machine with one eye on the clock for the pubs opening - working overtime here to suck the life out of every scene he's in. The part is pretty well written, but he's hopelessly out of his depth with dialogue. Particularly painful are his prayer and his rallying the troops, where he just looks bored stiff and doesn't even try. And what's with the look of utter contempt he gives Guinevere in the wedding scene? It's a terrible performance.

Unfortunately it's matched by the dreaded Keira Knightley, who is equally bad but in different ways. Her Hollywood career is a bit of a mystery: there are much prettier lasses and better actresses out there and she has no screen presence. She struggles badly with the lines, delivering them in a flat Rodean (a posh English school) accent that is oh so very wrong for a Scottish warrior queen. And when she gets bloody in the battle scenes, she just looks ridiculous, like she'd tried putting her lipstick on in turbulence. The fact that she's so anorexic she looks like a small child could knock her down just by blowing softly on her just makes her action-gal act that much more of a bad joke.

Together this terrible twosome sabotage the good work of director and supporting cast whenever they dominate the screen. Luckily the battles and the rest of the knights DO compensate and somehow despite the black hole at the heart of the film the telling sweeps you along. But with proper actors instead of a couple of shop window dummies this could have been a contender. Shame.",1120089600,2,1773,4.625396825396826

Bloody battle scene after bloody battle scene, this movie was obviously competing for the kind of audience garnered by the Lord of the Rings movies. I know life was cheap and bloody in the olden days, but this is not what I associate with King Arthur and Guinevere.

2145732,5,B0002YLCFQ,"Most of the negative reviews of this movie have been downright unfair and laughable. Talk about nit-picking! Folks, if you want a documantary, watch A&E or the History Channel!

I also recognize the other source for a lot of these complaints: So many of us have our own nostalgia and memories about all the King Arthur fairytales, legends, literary references, etc. and anything that deviates from that warm, fuzzy spot we all have in our hearts for that material is going to meeet a certain resistance. I understand and appreciate that! I love all that stuff as much as anyone else!

But, this film deserves a fair and open minded approach, and I think you would be doing yourself a disservice to dismiss it out of hand without trying it out at least one time. If you're going to do so, this Director's Cut is the version you should watch.

I'm grateful to see things like expanded Director's Cuts come to DVD with greater frequency, as this is yet another movie that greatly benefits from it, as the film's screenwriter outlines below my review here.

Anyone that's a fan of movies like Braveheart or Gladiator should be eating this thing up, no questions asked. Easily!

I went into this movie with incredibly low expecations, thanks to the negative feedback I've run across. I also went in with aforementioned ""nostalgia"" factor in the back of my mind.

I'm so glad I finally said ""the heck with it"" and watched it to make up my own mind. I definitely implore everyone to do just that: Disregard any and all external opinions and preconceptions and make up your own mind about this film. It deserves that much.

It's a blast! Is it as good as Gladiator or Braveheart? Probably not, but it scratches that itch quite nicely.  You'll have a good time with this film and that's really what it's all about.

I really can't find anything to complain about with this film unless I really want to try and write a historical doctorate/thesis. The cast did a wonderful job and, like Braveheart, the film benefits from the fact that the producers took a chance in not casting a bunch of mainstream, A-list actors in every role that peopl everyone would recognize from dozens of other films. Braveheart had Mel Gibson and Patrick McGoohan leading a cast of mostly unknowns and the unknowns were a major asset to that film. The same is true here as well.

I'm glad they didn't go the ""Batman"" route and cast people like Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, etc. in this film. Everyone in this film is someone that I'm going to be looking out for, for now on.

Special mention has to go to Stellan Skarsgrd, who plays the lead ""villian"" in this film. He has a wonderful, undersated performance and avoids hamminess.

Clive Owen and Kiera Knightley are known from other works and they do excellent work here. Kiera now has two solid hits under her belt with this and Pirates of the Caribbean. Clive Owen may have just gotten his big boost from this film. Everyone did a splendid job in front of, and behind the camera.

I promise you this: If you don't go in to this film looking for a History Channel Documentary, and you like Gladiator and Braveheart-like films, you'll like this. I guarantee it.

I really wouldn't mind seeing a sequel to this some day. I'm certainly seeing sequels for far worse material being made, so why not this? You certainly could do a lot worse.

I'd like to see what happens next in the life of this King Arthur.",1119657600,4,3435,4.599018003273322
2145733,1,B0002YLCFQ,"I got this as a 1 week rental, and boy was it one weak rental. King Arthur is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. It consists mainly of boring, drawn out battle sequences interspersed with self-righteous speeches. It's also the most blatant and sustained piece of anti-Christian propaganda I've ever sat through.

The story and characters bear no resemblance to the story and characters with these names with which we're all familiar. The title itself is misleading, as this Arthur is not a king at all, just the captain of a small band of warriors conscipted by Rome. Nor does the movie have much credibility as a historical reconstruction of the ""real"" Arthur. Evidently, the screen-writer has bought into some new theory and is out to educate the public.

The story is used as a vehicle to relentlessly drive home one basic message: Christianity bad; paganism good. Somehow, these soldiers on the outskirts of the Roman Empire get their unwelcome orders not from an Emperor or general, but from the Pope. Clerics are predictably portrayed as cowardly, arrogant, hypocritical manipulators. Lancelot and the other ""knights"" flaunt their disdain for Christianity, mocking everything from prayer to burial practices (""When I die in battle, don't bury me in your little cemetary. Burn me and spread my ashes on the mountain breeze."") What did Lancelot do for fun back home? ""Sacrifice a goat and dance naked around a fire.""

Just when you think it couldn't get worse, comes the most outrageous scene. Of course, every rabidly anti-Catholic bigot knows that if you casually break through a stone wall in the estate of any Roman nobleman, you'll find an entrance to a dungeon in which pagans who refuse to convert are tortured and starved. There are even monks ranting about the need for human sacrifices! What kind of fevered fantasy is this? Never mind the fact that it was the introduction of Christianity to the British islands that finally did away with the human (not goat) sacrifices of paganism.

To lend the proceedings an air of historical grounding, two names from history are invoked, Germanus and Pelagius. The former, presumably the St. Germanus under whom St. Patrick studied, is here transformed into a stock conniving, calous bishop. The latter, a monk whose teachings denied original sin, grace, and redemption, and were thus declared heretical, is made into a hero, the idol of Arthur, who begins the film as a Christian but is apparently gradually ""cured"" by his pagan friends and his experience of the dark side of Rome and its religion.

 There's also an interwoven battlecry of ""free will"", apparently connected with the finer points of Pelagian theology. Arthur's men desperately want the ""freedom"" to choose their own battles. It doesn't occur to them that a warrior who individually chooses his own battles, free of any command, is not a soldier, but a serial killer. Oh, and some menacing Saxons show up for the big battle scenes, but it's OK, since they're pagans, too. At least those pesky Romans are pulling out of England. What a mess this movie is. It amazes me that a Hollywood that got so jittery over non-existent anti-semitism in The Passion of the Christ would have the chutzpah to make a film so obviously intended to arouse hatred of Christians.",1119484800,13,3286,4.922382671480144
2145734,5,B0002YLCFQ,"I'll admit I wasn't thrilled about seeing this movie with all the other versions we've seen in the past about Arthur. I kept thinking, ""What could they possibly do different that would be interesting to see?"" Boy, am I glad my nephew happened to bring the DVD over one night.  I ended up enjoying it so much that I went out the very next day to buy this version on DVD.

This movie bases it's story on evidence found, not some fairy tale we've all grown up to believe in thanks to Hollywood.  I honestly preferred the fact that they didn't use big named actors to play the roles.  They all did marvelously with their parts, and others I've seen on here who say Arthur didn't show emotion or Lancelot was an afterthought obviously didn't pay attention to the feelings that ran through this version of the movie.  I was very emotional watching it.  Now I will admit the Director's Cut is much better than the other version since I've seen both.

Just because this movie doesn't fit into what you always knew about Arthur and his knights, please don't just discount it and not watch.  It's a wonderfully done movie that still shows a bit of a triangle but shows how Arthur probably actually became king, instead of harping on that love story that supposedly cost him his friendship with Lancelot like we've always been told (after he became King).  Arthur is intense throughout because he values his men and what they are willing to sacrifice for a cause that isn't theirs.  (He's already lost so many of them before the story even begins.)  They fight for HIM.  People who belittle the ""freedom"" aspect of the movie missed a huge part of it.",1119225600,3,1639,4.537414965986395
2145745,1,B0002YLCFQ,"What an awful, gore-filled movie. The romance and mystery of the Authurian legend is replaced by the mystery of how Guinevere kept clothed during battle. She only wears a few well placed leather straps. How can they claim historical accuracy and redefine Guinivere in this way? When we first meet G., her fingers are all out of joint and Arthur painfully puts them back. In less than a few hours, she is Robin Hood. Killing evil  Roman Christians and Saxons with a bow and arrow. She is almost starved to death and dehydrated by the Romans, but in less than a few days she's gripping swords, out dueling opponents three times her size and running half naked to battle. She has pretty impressive recuperative powers.

The acting of Clive Owen is the only decent thing about the movie. He plays King Arthur in a nice understated way.

An undefined ""Freedom"" becomes the highest good. Freedom replaces truth, justice, chivalry, and duty of the Arthurian legends. The movie investigates the idea of freedom, but never really defines it. True freedom is no boundaries, I think. The movie steals from Braveheart, The Patriot and the Lord of the Rings. The battle scenes go on way too long. There are several scenes of Merlin with the wind blowing through his long hair. It is less than impressive.

I could go on, but why bother.

I would add 1/2 star. After I wrote this review I saw a special on Bouddicca. She led a charge in England against the Romans. So the warrior princess idea is well-founded in fact. I still think no warrior would dress that way and her recuperative powers were too amazing.",1119139200,6,1596,4.665480427046264
2145746,2,B0002YLCFQ,"I appreciate D.H. Franzoni's (a writer for this movie)review which seeks to enlighten us about the history used to construct this movie. I also applaud the moviemakers attempt to create a new perspective on a story that's been told many times.

With that in mind, I wanted to approach this movie with an open mind rather than judge it with one eye on the story we all know so well. Unfortunately, that wasn't enough to make me conclude this was a good movie.

First of all, the basic premise, that the legend of King Arthur was based on a roman with a similar name, was an interesting one. However, if the moviemakers are going to use history so faithfully, they shouldn't try to pepper the movie with modern day dialogue and personalities. The banter between the ""knights"" and especially Guinevere's behavior (particularly soon after a rather terrible ordeal that she was rescued from) seemed out of place. If the writers were so devoted to accuracy, why didn't they research how people related to one another and the true behavior of peasants of the era?

The dialogue sounding too modern and quippy at times serves to spoil the mood of the period which the moviemakers seemed to be trying so hard to be faithful to. Also, I just could not buy Guinevere being so forward all the time. Somehow I doubt most peasant women waltzed up to knights and questioned whether they believed in anything or that they made jokes about rape. Also, Guinevere's prowess with a bow soon after having her fingers (which were previous pushed out of joint for at least awhile during torture) was absurd. Additionally, if she were so kick ass, I doubt she'd have been captured and tortured in the first place. It seriously smacked of an attempt to create a more feminist version of the character which, again, seemed out of place.

Undermining the credibility of a desire for an accurate historical perspective wasn't enough to make the movie unenjoyable though it did make one feel there was some pandering to certain a certain demographic going on. The real problem is the movie moves too slowly and seems to linger lovingly on certain scenes for no reason. It's not that the scenes should have been shorter but some of them seemed unnecessary to the story's progress.

The only ""good"" thing about the movie was that it took elements of the mystical Arthurian legend and gave them a basis in potentially realistic occurences and that was interesting but not nearly enough to carry the movie. I guess that some might question whether or not such an attempt really holds any value for a classic tale steeped in magic and mysticism but I'm willing to give credit for the desire to do so even if the implementation on the whole didn't work very well.",1118620800,7,2728,4.710691823899371
2145747,2,B0002YLCFQ,"...not the result I expected. I was very interested in watching this film because, for once, the film was not based in the traditional Arthurian cycle. So I thouight it would great. Finally someone realized that Arthur or Arturicus was contemporary to the Goths and not to ladies in castles and knights in shining armours. But the film developed has been a fiasco.

The story developes in a strange mood. It is not epic, not funny, nor even interesting. The characters are simply too simple. And the small attempts to make them bi-dimensional failed. Let's take for instance Arthur. He has the same face all the film. He is always in this state of "" I am such a hero that I always act like if I were in a funeral"". I am not saying that the enviroment was exactly a picnic but, was he not tired of being always so proper? Clive Owen , ussualy an actor I like, acts like a stone, that is , with no emotion.

And what about Merlin? To make his character like that better do not let him appear. Stephen Dillane, wonderful in Firelight and Mel Gibson's Hamlet seems that he was just passing by there.

While I was watching the film I cannot stop thinking in Braveheart and Gladiator. I am not particularly fond of these two films but in comaprison they are two jewels. I am not sure if it was a problem with the direction. The battle scenes are realy bad, and the rest...well some videos have better features.

Truly a pity because I think the idea deserved a better cast and direction.",1118534400,4,1481,4.413919413919414
2145748,4,B0002YLCFQ,"Antoine Fuqua's King Arthur is an excellent example of what epic filmmaking should be.  The director is an underrated genius in his craft and I can't help but wonder if the troubles he faces from studios when it comes to presenting his vision stems not from actual feasability, but from the color of his skin.

That an African-American could present such a bold and exciting account of the Arthurian legend, side stepping the Hollywood perpetuation of impossible myth and instead seeking a more historically believable telling of the tale must have stuck in many a studio executive's craw.

The PG-13 theatrical release rating almost assuredly was an attempt to ruin Fuqua's box office credibility, when all it did was lend credence to the idea of disbanding the MPAA.

Now by no means is this a perfect film, and the overused(although resounding) motif of freedom gets redundant and eventually, annoying.  However, much can be forgiven when each and every battle scene is more jaw dropping than the last.  If you're a fan of film violence presented in a realistic fashion, that's all the more reason to see this version of the film.

This was one of the best films of 2004, too bad it never made it to theaters.  Also check out Tears of the Sun, which is another overlooked Fuqua film.

2145749,4,B0002YLCFQ,"I have no idea how historically accurate this movie is but it does have an interesting take on the old legends.

The level of detail was interesting, the plot wasn't to bad either- just took upwards of half the movie to really get going.

If the movie is historically accurate Arthur's knights were a people called Sarmatians but the look of their recruitment scenes (drafting?)and the use of the term ""Rus"", made me think of what is today Russia. That's quite a change from the usual idea of being from what is now Britain.

I noticed several men wearing what I'd call a buzz haircut, kind of a long stubblecut- I don't think that can be accurate given the haircutting tools they'd have had.

The story is interesting , Arthur & his men have fulfilled their enlistment agreement and on the day they were due to go free they get one last mission. They are sent north of Hadrians's Wall (that is an impressive set) to rescue a Roman family from the advancing enemy ( I think it was the Woads- Celtic Britons, not the Saxons who are also invading Britian). Arthur and his men aren't at all impressed with the family but they do their duty and bring them south, along with their worker's families and some captive Woads (Guinevere is one of these)which Arthur has freed.

Back at the base Arthur decides to remain behind in Britain due to his disgust with what Rome has become (the depiction of the supposedly Christian Romans may offend some but the actions shown are similar to what some early types really did do). Having already defeated the advancing Saxons in one battle in the run to the south Arthur and the Woad people get ready for another battle, this time at Hadrian's Wall. Arthur's men return in time to help out, this is where the movie really gets going- something over an hour into running time. It's a big battle, look at the DVD extra stuff on it, and Arthur is of course victorious.

I liked the look of the sets, and of most costuming, the battles looked very well done, I even liked the way many details of the Arthurian legend were worked into the plot ( just differently enough to be something believably and gradually changed over time).

I found it hard to accept that Arthur and his men did not wear anything on their heads until the big battle, no matter how hard they fought or how cold it was. I also didn't like their camping out in some freezing woods without any real weather protection. The Woad women going into battle, no problem except for the tops they wore, I think those people would likely have gone into battle bare chested -men or women.

I found it interesting that there was no swearing, surprisingly little blood or flying body parts ( was that to help the rating and film budget?).

The movie is all right, just slow going, I may skip most of the first half the next time I watch it.",1118102400,3,2827,4.47378640776699
2145750,3,B0002YLCFQ,"This movie is an ambitious retelling of the Arthurian legend using historical texts rather than the typical and more well-known legends.

As such, it sets Arthur as a Roman general sent to Britain to secure Rome's control over the island south of Hadrian's wall.  Lancelot and the other knights are explained to be captured peasants who are forced into 15 years of service in the Roman army.  It is around Arthur (Arturius to Romans) and these handful of knights that the movie revolves.

The stage is set with the end of Rome's 15-year occupation of the British isle.  Well, the end of Rome's occupation of it and the end of the knights' term of servitude to Rome, it wasn't quite clear what was happening exactly.  On the eve of their freedom, the knights receive one last command to rescue a Roman family north of Hadrian's Wall.  At the same time, it is known that a large group of Saxons is steadily marching south destroying everything in their wake.

In addition to the deadly Saxons, there is a group of blue-painted people who live in the forest and are led by Merlin.  They have fought against Arthur for years, but really all they wanted was their freedom and to make Britain a free land.  Luckily for Arthur, these blue people hate the Saxons more than the Romans, so they team up against the Saxons in an epic final battle at Hadrian's Wall.

My opinion?  Honestly, it was pretty bad.  None of the characters were very interesting, and Merlin, the greatest wizard ever, was a blue tree person without anything to add to the story.

If there is ever a world-wide shortage of blue lens filters, we can blame this movie.  Every scene is cast in blue light, I suppose to give it a time-worn feel, but it makes many things difficult to see as lots of details and faces are lost in the shadows.

The character of Arthur is more a book of homilies than man.  If it isn't Man's innate Freedom he's blabbering on about, it's something about loyalty.  After 15 years of that kind of talk, I think most of the knights would be rolling their eyes rather than riding off into battle with Art.

We have Lancelot who is the narrator (I think) of the story.  He's all smoky and smoldering and always hinting at his ""prowess"".  Too bad we never actually see him fight anything.

Luckily, just so we don't lose our minds from boredom, we get treated to Bose (Bozz?  Boss?) who sticks around for grunting, He-man humor.

On the Saxon side, we have Cedric who actually seems a little bit interesting.  He gets about 5 minutes of screen time because it's far too generous to let the audience enjoy this serious movie.

In all, this movie looks okay, but it's not really worth spending 2 and a half hours trying to figure out what's going on.  The director did a poor job of tying everything together and the cinematographer's decision to make everything too dark to see makes for a snoozefest.

A reluctant 3 stars for the ambition, but it falls way short of the sort of quality you'd expect from something so richly infused with legend.",1117497600,3,3029,4.538745387453875
2145751,3,B0002YLCFQ,"I don't know what people who've given this movie 5 stars are thinking. Let me start by saying King Arthur isn't a bad movie but it's not exactly a 5 starrer. I didn't dislike the movie because I didn't expect anything from it. It's a movie I'd rent and watch on my couch once in a lifetime and then later someday watch it on HBO and forget about it. I really don't know what 5 starrers are about although I would like to know. Ive seen some better big budget axes and archery films of late than King Arthur.

King Arthur has limited action potential thrill. Although it's better than ""Van Helsing"" it remains lacklusture in comparison to bigger projects. What I liked about the film is the absence of pretence which is quite evident by the absence of details to character chiasis. The direction isn't good and there were a few loopholes. I'm not the kind to take out mistakes. However, there are erratic tempo shifts in dialogue deliveries and accents. The accents sound a bit too forced. I must say I liked the jungle scenes (3 of them).

PLEASE READ:

This movie takes a big hit because I felt the supporting actor was far better drawn out and hero like than King Arthur himself.

I'm talking about Sir Lancealot (the better actor too).

Watch this movie on HBO,Rent it at the most. If you're buying this as a DVD then well either your very rich and a bit stupid like me or you liked this film.(5.5/10)",1117324800,3,1404,4.426356589147287
2145752,2,B0002YLCFQ,"I can appreciate that this movie may be more historically accurate than what we're used to.  Perhaps Arthur was in fact a Roman.  I wouldn't know, obviously, but I'm happy to take the word of someone who has looked into it, with the additional comment that I don't fully trust anyone on this issue.

Judging the movie apart from its possible historical accuracy, I have to give it a definite thumbs down.  There is just too much wrong with it.

There are many battle scenes.  They don't give me the feeling of battle.  They are Hollywood battle scenes, lots of closeups, lots of blood and gore, lots of heroism, and none of it looks the least bit real.  It is a bunch of nonsense.

The dialogue is pretty bad as well.  There's nothing realistic in the characters.  I don't sense even one real person on the screen.  This isn't exactly Dustin Hoffman here.  This is a bunch of Hollywood nonsense.

Guinevere as Wonder Woman.  Yeah, okay.  It's one thing to say that there were female warriors back then, and I have read about Boadicea.  But I bet if Boadicea did in fact participate in hand to hand fighting, she wasn't a slender beauty queen.

Guinevere reminded me of the female warrior in Lord of the Rings.  It's nice to have a female role model to make the little girls in the theatre, in their karate classes, proud of themselves.  Why not?  It's all make believe for the guys as well.  It's like Rocky.  The real Rocky was a shlub who couldn't beat Muhammad Ali in his dreams.  The Bayonne Bleeder.  Guinevere is Miss Rocky, so good for her.

This movie is a silly bloody fiction, and it isn't worth your time to watch, if your taste is like mine.  If you like silly bloody stories, you will like this one too.  The good guys come off quite well in it.  Don't put your money on the villain, no matter how favored he seems to be.  You want a real long shot, bet on a villain.

One part of this movie reminds me of another famous fictional story, the one about Moses leading the Israelites through the sea, a sea which ends up swallowing the army of Egypt.  The same thing happens here, only the sea is composed of ice, temporarily.  Crackkkkkkkk.........

I would have enjoyed this movie a lot more if the Egyptians, I mean the Saxons, were wearing swimsuits and inflated tubes.  Failing as a drama, it might have been funny as a comedy.

To put my comments in perspective, I think that almost all of the adventure movies out today are absolute garbage.  It's not that I'm hard to please.  It's that most of the dramatic movies out now are worthless crap, unless you are into watching phony violence for the sake of enjoying the phony violence.  I'm not saying that this movie is any worse than the rest of the garbage out there.

Here are a few of the things you learn from this movie.  First of all, Germans are bloodthirsty evil villains.  Second, Christians are stupid asses who enjoy torturing pagans.  Third, Romans were pretty awful themselves, except of course for Arthur.  Fourth, it is quite possible to shoot an arrow any number of yards, high into the air, and have it come down plunk right into a sensitive organ of a man hiding in a tree.",1117238400,3,3157,4.453590192644484
2145753,2,B0002YLCFQ,"""King Arthur"" is not the 'swords and sorcery' version of Arthurian legend.  It attempts to portray a more realistic, and I guess more historically accurate, story.  However, it's attempts at authenticity are dilluted by the standard Hollywood cliches.

  In Arthurian legend, many or most will agree that the most interesting character was that of Merlin the Magician.  In this movie, Merlin is no magician, and is certainly not interesting.  He portrays the most boring character in the movie, and that's no easy task.  The lackluster acting only served to make the characters even more boring.

  ""King Arthur"" also attempts to make up for poor writing with bloody, epic battles.  In order to pump up Arthur and his knights, we are treated to extremely lopsided battles.  The enemy Saxons are less accurate with bows and arrows than Stormtroopers are with laser guns.  The good guys can fire arrows with bullseye accuracy against targets they cannot even see.

  Aside from the predictable (this is Hollywood, after all) doomed heroes, the knights slaughter countless enemies with hardly a scratch on themselves.

  Just how many scenes of a knight on horseback charging and swinging his sword at the camera would be too many?  Whatever amount you choose, this movie probably exceeded it greatly.  Also, too many people were killed by the cheesy 'I'll stab my sword backwards and kill the guy behind me' maneuver.

  The movie also had a presistent, anti-Christian message to it.  Aside from Arthur, whose faith seems to dwindle throughout the movie, everyone of the Christian faith is entirely evil.  Most of Arthur's knights, particularly Lancelot, have disdain for Christianity.  So much for accuracy.

  A poor screenplay, poor acting, and poor fight coreography add up to a poor movie.  I would instead recommend ""Excalibur"" or ""Braveheard"" over ""King Arthur"".",1117065600,4,1867,5.1610738255033555

But what I was most surprised about was the performance of Keira Knightley. She has come a long way and for a 20 year old she is pretty darn good! She is charimatic and so beautiful that she absorbs the viewers to her character. I thought they could have used somebody like Ian Mcleen for Merlin, and there were a couple of other dubious casting, but you just can't take away anything from this movie.

2145765,5,B0002YLCFQ,"Despite the fact there are many free concessions respect the real Legend and many tergiversations to the true essence of the most important myth in the Western tradition. (Lancelot's death, there is not any reference to the Holly Grail) , it subsists the epic spirit that supported the noblesse of these Knights.
There are words that definitively can not be used in this Legend because it would deform seriously the dramatic effect and the whole transcendence: loyalty and honor. You may substitute by commitment and love, understood this last term as the supreme effort far beyond the prize. Loyalty and honor have sense by themselves after the French Revolution, or when the necessity and the established codes of power structures claim for them the presence of these concepts to guarantee the completion of the duty . The point to remark is the Knights support an ideal not an ideology. They have fought so hard all along fifteen years to obtain the expected freedom and just the last day  a new mission has come for them: so the loyalty and the word's completion by the religious authorities may be conceived such as another fine stratagem just to reach their goal.
The loyal fighters do not agree but Arthur ' s leadership imposes finally.
There is a cunning homage to Alexander Nevsky in the battlefield over the ice. That smart device is perhaps the true landmark of the film.
The action sequences are admirably well filmed and Clive Owen displays with sensational realism the essence of the aristocratic approach of King Arthur. Besides Lancelot `s wishes for Guinevere is suggested visually in two or three shots.

2145766,1,B0002YLCFQ,"This movie was the most convoluted slop that i have ever seen.  The idea that Arthur was Roman, and that Guinevere was a common rebel is insulting.  The acting was overdone in parts, and when people of importance were dying, i was yawning.  The whole story was ridiculous, because, Arthur and his famous knights apparently grew up together, the lady of the lake never existed, the sword in the stone was planted by the grave of Arthur's father, and Merlin...Merlin was the most disappointing.  Not only did they not explain his mysticism, his ability to tell the future (and by the way, that is all he could really do.  He was called a wizard, but did not have ""magic"") they made him a leader of a people who lived in the woods, covered in soot, and wearing loincloths.  King Arthur was WELSH!!!!!  NOT ENGLISH, NOT BRITISH, AND NOT ROMAN!!
This movie was made to try to make a quick buck, it was poorly cast, and too artsy for it's own good.  Yes, the cinematography was gorgeous, but that was all this movie had.  No Camelot, no prediction of Arthur's future, no prediction of Guinevere and Lancelot betraying Arthur and having an affair, leading to the fall of Camelot...oops, i forgot, apparently Camelot was a small unimportant village, surrounded by a big wall.  I watched this movie, not of my choice, because the moment i heard that they were trying to make King Arthur Roman, i just about threw up.  I stayed for the whole thing, because i kept thinking that there would be a saving point in this movie.  It is such a shame that such great actors, were cast for such ridiculous parts, and void of any other emotion than bloodlust.  The villain was so predictable.  Every time he came across someone, he ordered his men to kill them...i found myself saying, ""Kill them"" before the villain did.  The Knights of the Round Table were supposed to be forgiving, and helpful to townsfolk, but in this movie, they just wanted to let people die.  This movie was awful, and so was the plot.  Hopefully someone talented will make another movie, and do it justice someday.  Until then, AVOID KING ARTHUR.

2145767,4,B0002YLCFQ,"The film does an excellent job of portraying the historical controversy surrounding Britian's legend. For most Americans who have been taught ""the truth"" of the myths, this will come as quite a shock-yet for a historically based movie, it does an excellent job in bringing to the public the reality behind the myth. Histiography changes constantly, particularly in our modern times, for we continue to dig up evidence. For example, recent excavations at Hadrian's Wall have provided us with much more knowledge of the Roman period in Britain than we had previously known. The changeability of history must be kept in mind as you analyze the historical content of the movie and challenge your own presuppositions.",1115596800,5,712,5.146551724137931
2145768,5,B0002YLCFQ,"First off, I love this movie. Second, I have a degree in History and am familiar with the research of the likes of Geoffrey Ashe whose work supports the basis of this film. Therefore I'm inclined to want a more historically accurate ""King Arthur"" and this was so very well done. While I am a big fan of the King Arthur myth, I feel that version of the story was more than adequately covered in ""Excalibur"" anyone who is disapointed with a Roman version of Arthur should stick with ""Excalibur"".

  I won't rehash the movie here, but I will add that I am much more impressed with the Director's cut, the added scenes are very key to the storyline, I also prefer the original ending, which just made more sense than ""Suddenly, a wedding occurred!"".

 My only beef is the death of Tristan, I have a hard time believing that a warrior of that magnitude would be such an easy kill for a rather slow-moving lump of a Saxon. The scene couldn't have been more offensive unless they had, had him trip and fall on his own battle-ax!

 Other than that, the casting was well done and wonderfully performed. The movie elements of ""extraordinary unlikelyness"" (an arrow is lauched from a mile away and hits a well-hidden target in a tree.) actually add a level of excitement to the story that should help those who are hung up on the ""myth"" enjoy themselves.",1115337600,,1343,4.502057613168724
2145769,3,B0002YLCFQ,"I wasn't exactly expecting ""King Arthur"" (2004) to be a great film, but I was hoping for some dumb fun. Unfortunately producer Jerry Bruckheimer was there to ham it up with cheesy melodramatics. I know he wasn't the director -- that honor goes to Antoine Fuqua -- but his presence was everywhere.

The problem with the self-important melodramatic moments of the film is that in this movie there is not enough character development for the audience to give much of a toss for the characters during these moments that are meant to be heart-stirring.

What irked me in addition is that they advertise this film as the ""true story"" of Arthur. Any Hollywood marketing director who puts this lame line on the press release for any Hollywood film should be shot on general principle.

I guess having Arthur set in late Roman times is suppose to be a shock for audiences. Has Jerry been down to a Barnes and Nobles recently? Any history or fiction section dealing with Arthur in the last 50 years or so has had Arthur set in the 5th-6th century fighting the Saxons. Even as far back as the 11th century, the first major mass publication of Arthur in the ""History of the Kings of Briton"" by Geoffery of Monmouth had Arthur fighting the Saxons during the Dark Ages.

The difference between the legends and the movie time-wise is about a century or so. The legends have Arthur emerging long after the Romans had left Briton at the beginning of the 5th century. Arthur's time is often thought to be in the late 5th Century to the early 6th Century.

In the film Arthur is not a king but a half-Roman, half-British Roman Cavalry Commander of a group of Sarmartian auxiliaries serving along the Hadrian Wall. The Sarmartian knights in the film oddly all have medieval French names like Lancelot, Galahad and Tristan. I wasn't aware Sarmartians spoke French or gave their children French names.

Now in the movie's defense, it wasn't a ""First Knight"" (1995) debacle. The actors are generally good and there's not much in the way of modern slang that creeps in. The problem is the movie is a mish-mash of Arthurian legends put into a typical Bruckheimer film.

After a hammy melodramatic beginning of a kid riding off to join the Roman army, our story begins when the knights of Arthur have been fighting for 15 years and doing some amazing things that you have to take the movie's word for that they were amazing. The knights are fiercely loyal to Arthur because he has been a great leader which again you have to take the movie's word for it since we don't see any of this.

Instead of having the story detail Arthur's accomplishments, the film focuses on just a few days. You have the elite force of Arthur's knights one day from retirement (stop me if you've heard this before) but they are asked to go on one more assignment -- the toughest they've ever had -- to rescue an important family north of Hadrian's Wall.

This family apparently has never been wiped out by the Woads -- the native guerrilla force that Arthur and his men have been fighting all these years. Now the Saxons are coming so they have to get there before the Saxons and rescue them.

Overall I'd give the film 2.5 stars. As I said, the actors are good. Some of the historical tidbits are good. The lame formula of the ""last dangerous mission before retirement"" storyline and the cheesy melodramatic moments that don't fly because there isn't enough character development are what keep the film from being enjoyable.

It's a shame really. With the actors, sets, and costume and props it could have been a better film if not for the silly story.",1115164800,3,3604,4.624413145539906
2145770,2,B0002YLCFQ,"Although I am no expert on King Arthur, all I have learned was from books such as the Cantebury Tales and such, I find it hard to believe the 'supposed facts' that this DVD is based on. First of all, King Arthur is apart of British history and we as American's should not be taking their legends, fables and myths as our own and distorting them so atrociously. The British don't take the Civil War or our great heros such as Washington as their own and make 'true' versions out of what happened.

King Arthur, although having pretty cool landscapes is nothing more than a show of brutality and stupidity. The Roman's here are portrayed as being afraid of the Saxons when Rome at that time had one of the largest armies and was so bent on conquering the known world they didn't have time to be afraid. Face it, they wheren't even scared of Attila.

While I tried to watch this movie with an open mind, there was just to much untrue representation going on that it was hard to truly enjoy it at its level. And whats up with Merlin? He's completely hard to believe as the infinitely filthy gang/rebel leader of some backwoods army. Would such a person ever recieve the name Merlin. Most likely not, its rather a noble name. Such as Guinevere (*sigh*) so much for daughter of a great king. Who did she belong to anyhow in the movie?

On the whole, as one reviewer said, if they hadn't tried to use the names king Arthur, Guinevere, Merlin or Galahad it might have been more believable, and more enjoyable.

How also did King Arthur get Excaliber? And if it wasn't such a magical sword given to him, then why was it so famous and named thus? Roman's didn't usually go around naming their swords for the heck of it. And what about the wall covering Britain from Italy? Who destroyed that so completely that it was never discovered until now? The Saxons? Angry at Arthur that they took it out on the wall? Please.

 One the whole this movie tried to introduce a new idea, but falls completely flat. There are two many holes in this theory that just don't quite give it the necissary credience.",1114560000,2,2086,4.447643979057592

2145772,2,B0002YLCFQ,"A rather mediocre attempt at bringing to light the mythological origins of King Arthur undermined by a pathetic script and horrible screenplay. In addition, the history portrayed in the film is tentative at best and most historians studying the Arthurian myth wouldn't be so hasty to draw the conclusions presented in the film.

First, in terms of the film itself, it was rather mediocre. The plot is a standard Hollywood formula of that is completely predictable in the first 5 minutes of the film. The script was simply indicative reciting the obvious in addition to gratuitous jingoisms where the characters yell 'freedom!', 'liberty!', 'our rights!', etc. I didn't know Arthur was Thomas Jefferson. Although the film quality was very good, the editing wasn't that great and rather generic: overly long scenes showing the Saxons marching like Nazis (just to remind you that they're the bad guys) with their chief whose just a Hitler-like character who wants to exterminate everything (just to remind you he's the arch-villain.) The actors didn't seem very thrilled about their script and just recited what was given to them on paper without much enthusiasm. I give credit to the battle scenes though, they were rather good: especially the one on the frozen lake. One final weak point is that one can clearly see this film's cheap attempts at capitalizing on Riddley Scott's superior 'Gladiator' with similar editing for the battle scenes and almost identical music: hardly a mark of creativity on the part of those who worked on/marketed this film.

As for the historical theories proposed in the film, don't be deceived by D.H. Franzoni's commentary about the research involved in this film as the theories he relies on have many flaws that simply don't add up. In terms of historical accuracy, the film is correct in showing that, as most historians now believe, Arthur was a Celt-Roman leader in Britain who lived during the collapse of the Western Roman Empire c. 450-475 A.D. and, that he led a military/political movement to fight off the increasing migrations of Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, that were coming to Britain from modern-day Denmark and northern Germany. Contrary to D.H. Franzoni's claim, Lucius Artorius Castus is not a likely candidate as historical evidence places him under Marcus Aurelius/Commodus' reign c. 180 A.D.: 270 years before Arthur is commonly accepted as having existed. In addition to that improbability, the claim that the Holy Grail, The Lady of the Lake, etc. are undoubtedly the product of Sarmatian culture is false and a product of pure conjecture. The Holy Grail is a Christian symbol that had been around for 450 years in the Roman Empire and such symbols were introduced to Britain and Ireland by evangelists such as St. Patrick. Dragons, Merlin, The Lady of the Lake, and Excalibur, is stronger evidence of Celtic/Druidic rites than anything else; also, if members of Arthur's entourage were Sarmatian, why do they all have Celtic/Roman/Germanic names such as Artorius, Ulfius, Galahad, Tristan, Gawayne, Uther, Vortigen, Morgana, Mordred, etc., etc., etc. All of the characters in Arthurian myth have Celtic, Roman, or Germanic names: not Sarmatian ones. Legends of the Green Knight in Arthurian myth have little to do with Sarmatians and more to do with Celtic mythology. In addition, most of the battles, forts, and characters of Arthurian myths are recited as being in Wales and southern England which is where most of the myths come from, not Scotland where Hadrian's wall is located: presumably there's a reason for that. It is also important to note that most of the Celtic revival and geopolitical expansion at that time was focused in southern Britain and Brittany in northern France as evidenced by multiple Celtic settlements and forts: not Northern England as shown in the film.

Again, this film is rather mediocre in terms of its screenplay and acting while its script is rather pathetic in terms of its generic dialogues. The film has some good battle scenes. This may be a good movie to rent but, in my opinion, it's not worth owning. The only good Arthurian film in my opinion is John Boorman's 'Excalibur' as it cleverly combines the Romantic tale with Celtic mythology to bring a strange image of surrealism that works quite well for this genre.  The films 'First Knight' and 'Merlin' are the finest examples of bad film making and you're better off with this film instead.  Finally, for a more cautious historical approach to the Arthurian myth I would recommend Geoffrey Ashe's book 'The Discovery of King Arthur' in addition to the writers recommeded by D.H. Franzoni to get a balanced view on the many theories as to who Arthur may have been.",1114041600,10,4712,5.028169014084507
2145773,3,B0002YLCFQ,"This movie would have been better had it not invoked all of the Arthurian trappings. Give us different names for the characters (Not Arthur, Lancelot, Guinevere, Merlin, et al) and I would have enjoyed it more by far.

You see, historically accurate or not, King Arthur as a legend invokes hosts of traditional imagery and events--from the round table, the grail cup, the knightly quest, etc., to magic and myth. That produces an overload of expectations. The real subject of the film would seem to be the conflicts present in late Roman Britain. The movie would seem to cover these with a considerable amount of detail. Adding the Arthur legend names does not contribute to our understanding or enjoyment of the film. Once we remove the Arthurian trappings, the movie makes more sense. We do not, for example, find a Lancelot-Guinivere romance in this film; were it not for their names we would not expect such a romance, and its absence would not bother us at all. Let's rename the film, something like the ""Battle for Britain,"" and rename the characters, and we'll have a lot better result.

The battle scenes are (disturbingly but probably realistically) bloody. The scenery is great. The costuming fine (though the SM gear worn by Guinivere is possbily a bit over the top). The cast (particularly Clive Owen--superb here as in Gosford Park and Ioan Gruffudd of Horatio Hornblower renown) is good. The story is gripping.",1113868800,,1424,4.904564315352697
2145774,3,B0002YLCFQ,"The big plus in this movie is the new perspective on the possible history that inspired the King Arthur myth.  The possibility Arthur was a Roman soldier who was a student of Greek and Roman philosophers is tantalizing and from what I've learned, might even be true.

Another element of this story that I like is the conflict of religions in England at this time.  And for once early christians are not portrayed as the perfect ancient people they frequently are.  They are shown as violent and cruel towards the pagan faiths (Which in this story, many of Arthur's knights are believers of).  However Arthur himself is a follower of early Christianity and is the more idealized symbol of spiritual morality in the movie, as he should be.  The movie touches on the subject of religion without becomming to preachy or biased.  The ancient pagan faiths are shown with respect and admiration, not as evil savages as the church would want you to believe.

However, despite some of the interesting perspectives on history...as a movie, I found it lacking.  Here are some of the reasons why:
-For one, it's predictable.  And the leader of the Saxon invaders is the sterotypical ruthless war-lord.  Not a very inspired bad guy.
-The only conflict between Lancelot and Arthur is regarding Arthurs decision to make a stand against the Saxons, so the melodrama of the love triangle that turns brother-against-brother in the classic story is not there.
-The movie is not directed poorly. Antione Fuqua did an good job, but while watching it I couldn't help but feel that this movie had a sort of ""Me too"" attitude.  It wishes it was like Gladiator and Lord of the Rings plus a little Pirates of the Carribbean on the side.  It doesnt seem to be able to stand on it's own two legs compared to these movies.

These gripes aside, I did enjoy watching the film.  The action and battle scenes fit the story and are entertaining.  The acting doesn't suck.  But I still feel it could have been better...",1113696000,,1984,4.7043478260869565
2145775,3,B0002YLCFQ,"Well, where do I begin? After viewing this film, I know exactly what was going through Jerry Bruckheimer's mind while producing it. With the huge successes of Gladiator and Braveheart, Bruckheimer was trying to capitalize on the gladiator genre film as well. This film has all the graphic violence, and horrific battle scenes required for this type genre film to succeed, with one small problem. Bruckheimer named the film ""King Arthur"", and though this film is many things, it's definitely NOT the tale of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table; however, there are knights, and there is a round table. It was a calculated risk, which backfired miserably at the box office. However, I really believe if the film was called anything else and the main characters renamed, this film would have performed much better.

The film is your typical Jerry Bruckheimer film, which is beautifully shot and exquisitely scored. It has everything going for it, except it was marketed as the tale of King Arthur, which it isn't. The film could have stood on its own merit, but the ""King Arthur"" moniker is always on the mind of the audience; and with each ensuing scene that follows, the more the audience is dismayed by what they are viewing. Whoever wrote the script should be tarred and feathered, then boiled in oil.

Anyways, if you leave all that behind you, this film can be enjoyed by disregarding its title and the names of the principle characters. If you view this film with no preconceived notions or knowledge of Arthur and his Knights, the film can be engaging.

This film stars Clive Owen (possibly the new James Bond) as Arthur, and Keira Knightley as Guinevere (Not to be confused with Lady Guinevere, because this woman is anything but a lady!) The story revolves around the aftermath of the rise of the Roman Empire. The boys of the defeated Sarmatian cavalry have to serve fifteen years reparation in the Roman Army for their father's spared life. The film opens with Arthur and his knights coming to the ends of their fifteen years of service; however, they are force to complete one final mission in order to gain their freedom. The Roman allegiance is pulling out of England, all the while; the Saxon army is slowly enveloping Britain. The Knights' mission is to save a Roman Noble family in Northern England before the Saxon army attacks.

As the story progresses, the knights and the Saxon head towards the film's climax and the movie's final battle. In which there is massive bloodshed, many dismemberments, and the final sword fight between our two central characters.

All in all, if you can view this film with an open mind, enjoy what is being presented as entertainment and not history; this movie just might surprise you.

I've been a long-time fan of the Arthurian legends and the history behind them...so this was an exciting addition to the truer side of the Arthurian cult classics.  I only say 'truer' because we can never be sure about anything in history; we only have our best guesses.

It might surprise many people to discover, as I recently have, that most of the Arthurian legends as we know them sprang into being around the time of Geoffry Chuacer in the 13th Century--quite a bit later than he actually appeared.  They were infact made popular in England after the Black Prince brought back the embellished tale from France and decided to incorporate it into his own court: complete with round table for all the knights, etc.

I thought the director/screenwriter did a fantastic job revamping this legend so it is more historically acurate than the rumours that have been floating around England for the past 700 years or so, popularized by Chaucer and his contemporaries.  I couldn't give this movie the full five stars, because it doesn't rank as one of those movies that changed the way I wake up every morning, but it was definately worth it to me to purchase the DVD and rewatch it from time to time.

2145779,4,B0002YLCFQ,"""King Arthur"" is handsomely filmed, possesses an impressive pedigree, features a rousing soundtrack, is well worth your time - and yet failed at the US Box Office. I can think of two reasons why, both of which were out of the filmmakers' control. Neither of these reasons should prevent you from seeing ""King Arthur"" if you are the type who enjoys an old-fashioned costume spectacle geared to adults.

First is timing, pure and simple. Director Antoine Fuqua has the misfortune of following in Peter Jackson's footsteps. Fuqua's no Jackson, and ""Arthur"" is no ""Lord of the Rings."" It isn't a substandard film by any means - but suffers by comparison to the Middle Earth classic. The second, related reason is the decision to make ""Arthur"" as historically plausible as it could be. I doubt that the American public is familiar enough with Arthurian legend to make such deconstruction necessary. For the record, I am far from familiar with the details of King Arthur's legends but I was surprised to see that many elements of the legend such as the Holy Grail, Morganna Le Fay, the Green Knight, and Merlin's role as Arthur's wizardly mentor were either absent or altered. This probably alienated much of ""Arthur""'s potential audience, who had seen and enjoyed ""Excalibur"" or ""Camelot."" It also probably drove away a younger audience hoping for tongue-in-cheek hijinks; when I saw the film in theaters, the audience was primarily over 40.

The DVD restores some gore clipped from the theatrical release, a couple of minor character-driven scenes and - thankfully - a series of restrained extras. I find that most DVD releases tell me more than I want to know about the film I've just seen, and most are endlessly self-congratulatory. ""Arthur""'s extras seem just right to me, giving us a glimpse of behind-the-scenes action without wearing us out.

As long as you don't approach this film expecting it to outdo the sweeping vistas of Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, you're likely to walk away both entertained and curious to learn more about who the real King Arthur might have been.",1113177600,2,2093,4.940340909090909

2145793,3,B0002YLCFQ,"Since high school I had been wishing for a film like this: a quasi-historical, Geoffrey of Monmouth-inspired King Arthur.  I was tired of films like the awful, embarassing First Knight. After seeing Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy (something else that's always been on my wish list), I was even more excited of the prosepct of an Arthur film that approached the centuries' worth of material seriously and intelligently, without falling back on old cliches. Call it a dork's fantasy.

In some respects, King Arthur fulfills my needs. It has several esoteric references designed, I assume, specifically for die hard Arthur fans, like the replica of Stonehenge at the end. The prophet Merlin, according to Geoffery of Monmouth, was responsible for Stonehenge. He brought it back from what is now Ireland and erected it in the fields of Salisbury to commemorate the British who fell against the Saxons. I also enjoyed seeing the clashing of cultures among the Romans, Picts, and Saxons. This asked a lot from the audience, some of whom were likely to get confused: ""Now who're the bad guys? Those guys? Wait, who are those Braveheart guys, and why are they fighting the Gladiator guys? HELP!""

Ultimately, however, the film is disappointing because of the lack of characterization, lack of suspense, poor acting, weak dialogue, and slow pacing.

As far as characterization goes, these legendary and literary gods have been reduced to mere cookie cutter carbon copies. Not much distinction among the knights. The only memorable one was Sir Bors, which is a little confusing since the film opens on Lancelot as a child and then quickly abandons him. You never get to know any of them and therefore do not sympathize with them. None of them show fear or, for that matter, any other human-like emotions. Clive Owens' facial expressions range from frown #1 to frown #2, the only difference between them being the former is shot from his left profile and the latter from his right.

The Saxon villian is a typical baddie who speaks in a method-y gruff tone of voice, and in case some audience members are still unsure who the main bad guy is, he is shot amidst atmospheric lighting, moody smoke, and muddy locales. His henchmen look like tatoo-parlor clientele, and the main Saxon and his son continually have these lame little moments of power struggle to build false suspense and false depth of character.

The film tries to be suspenseful on several occasions but fails. The problem is that the film never establishes that the Saxons are truly a threat. There's lots of talk that they're dangerous, but we don't see it. They sack only two villages, one of which had nobody there to defend it. The two battles in which Arhur's knights confront them are lame and a poor excuse to show a little action. The skirmish on the ice has some clever underwater photography, I must admit.

The film also tries to evoke the spirit of heroics and courage and selflessness but instead ends up lampooning itself. For example, the music swells, the brass belts out the Arthur theme, and the knights' swords shimmer in slow motion as someone roars out: ""RRRAAAAGGGGHHH!""

Scene like this, and the movie as a whole, are intended to make the hair on your arms stand up. I love it when movies make my arm hair jump up as if in shock, but alas, during King Arthur, even my arm hair was bored.",1112054400,2,3374,4.795180722891566
2145794,4,B0002YLCFQ,"The 2004 film ""King Arthur"" is not your standard retelling of the centuries-old tale about King Arthur and his knights of the round table.  For many years, archeologists and historians have attempted to explain the possible roots for the mythologies surrounding the fabled British king, and based upon the evidence and various theories that have been put forward, many believe that if King Arthur actually existed, it was at a time much earlier than most people tend to place the legend: at approximately the time when Rome still occupied ancient Britain (Gaul).  The producers and writers of the film ""King Arthur"" then constructed a fictional story about the legendary Arthur without the magic and grandeur of earlier films such as ""Camelot"" (1967) and ""Excalibur"" (1981), but with the realism of what may have occurred when Rome was preparing to abandon much of its empire.

The film begins far to the east of Britain, in another part of the Roman Empire called Samatia. Here, Samatians, whom Romans had spared due to their fighting skills, were given an agreement by the Empire several generations earlier that a number of young Samatian boys would be taken by Rome, given military training, and serve the empire for the next 15 years as soldiers.  These Samatian knights, as they are referred to, would then be sent to a particular region of the empire to serve with the Roman army.  After their 15 years of service, they were then free to return to their Samatian homes. One of the groups of Samatian knights were sent to Britain to help defend Rome's occupation against the people's living north of Hadrian's Wall. Placed under the command of Artorious Castus, a.k.a. Arthur (Clive Owen), the Samatian knights include Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd), Gawain (Joel Edgerton), Galahad (Hugh Dancy), Bors (Ray Winstone) and Tristan (Mads Mikkelsen); who are all anxious to obtain their freedom after having served the Roman Empire for a long 15 years.  Unfortunately, a bishop from Rome, Bishop Germanius (Ivano Marescotti), orders them to instead rescue a Roman family living north of Hadrian's Wall before giving them their papers indicating that their military service was fulfilled.  Begrudgingly, they set out north of Hadrian's Wall for the first time in their lives.  After a small skirmish with local British, they arrive at the Roman estate where its Roman leader has used torture as a means of converting the local British Pagans into believing in Christianity.  Arthur rescues the tortured captives that include Guinevere (Keira Knightley), then proceeds to insist on evacuating everyone from the estate because of the approaching Saxon army that leaves no person alive in its wake.  The Saxons are lead by the sociopath & despot Cerdic (Stellan Skarsgrd) and his son Cynric (Til Schweiger).  The result is a film filled with several intense battle scenes that were no doubt inspired by such films as the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy and ""Gladiator"" (2000), but without the ultra-shiny suits of armor and mysticism as in ""Excalibur"" and ""Camelot"".

Because so many people are well familiar with the more popular & mystical stories about the legendary King Arthur, the far more realistic version of the story presented in the 2004 film ""King Arthur"" was not as well received by audiences as it could have been. However, by placing the possible historical Arthur within the context of the end of Rome's occupation of Britain, the film's writer (David Franzoni) and director (Antoine Fuqua) did a masterful job at attempting to create a plausible story from which the more popular legends could have developed.  Though parts of the story were a little rough at times, it was still entertaining and interesting.  Overall, I rate the 2004 ""King Arthur"" with 3.5 out of 5 stars rounded up to 4 stars.",1111881600,4,3801,5.022257551669316
2145795,1,B0002YLCFQ,"Unlike previous King Arthur movies this version attempts to uncover the historical Arthur. The most widely known stories about King Arthur were written over seven hundred years after the death of the historical Arthur. Many legends had sprung up regarding King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table. The stories were written to depict the ideals of the times. Europe had been in the so-called Dark Ages and now at the dawn of the Renascence writers used the existing legends as a base for creating tales that illustrated the newly embraced concept of chivalry. Previous movies were based on these chivalrous tales instead of historical research.

In this movie King Arthur is a Roman. Although there are various theories and the actual history will never be known conclusively, recent research suggests that King Arthur was a Roman nobleman in a position of power in the Roman province of Britannia, now modern England. When the Roman Empire was crumbling in the fifth century AD, Arthur was forced to defend Britannia from Saxon invasions.

This movie also traces the origin of the knights. The Roman army used mercenaries from around the empire. The Sarmatian mercenaries of the movie might have been the actual knights that were employed by Arthur. Other research suggests that they might have been from Scythia which bordered Sarmatia.

The movie ""King Arthur"", written by D.H. Franzoni, is based on the historical Arthur and this is a refreshing approach. However where the movie completely fails is in the depiction of the culture and society of the times. The characters are mercilessly vulgarized for no apparent reason. It adds nothing to the story or to the dimension of the characters.

An example of this demeaning vulgarization is Sir Bors discussing his huge penis size. He claims that he ""can't piss straight. I could never piss straight. Too much of myself to handle down there."" His fellow knights describe his penis as ""A baby's arm holdin' an apple"".

Later Sir Bors talks about his ""bastards"" and that he only named one of his ""bastards"" because naming the rest ""was too much trouble, so we gave the rest of them numbers"".

Sir Lancelot brags that he will commit adultery with Sir Gawain's wife and that he is also the father of one of the ""bastards"" of Sir Bors.

D.H. Franzoni states, in an earlier Amazon.com review, that ""A great deal of research went into the preparation of this script, as much if not more than I spent on Gladiator"". I doubt that the sources of this vulgarization of the characters are historical documents.

Later ages selected Sir Bors as one of the three knights that earned the right to find the Grail Castle based on his purity of heart. Although this is mythology, I can not see the point in now depicting Sir Bors as a penis egomaniac. The movie could have been an excellent historical drama without the vulgar portrayal of the characters involved. This review is a warning to viewers who find such dialogue, when used for no apparent reason, repulsive and without merit.",1111881600,12,3026,4.862135922330097
2145796,2,B0002YLCFQ,"What most ""Arthurites"" would want to see is either a different telling of the Story of Arthur and his knights, or a grander showing of the story they are already familiar with.

This film falls into the first catagory and tries to nail down the legend with facts.  Arthur was a roman solider...I'm not going to go into the details, as there are plenty of story  sum-ups already written here.  The movie doesn't work as a whole for the following reasons.

- Everything, everyone is ""too pretty"".  It's strange that they try to market it as a ""true"" telling of the ""Arthur"" legend, when it looks like everyone stepped out of a stoybook.  The settings are manicured and lit just so, everyones hair is just so, and pretty white teeth were just not part of the package back then.  Even the ""ugly"" characters seem sanitized.  The battle scenes, while interesting in passing, lack blood.

- The characters have been hollowed out, which leaves the story empty.  There's very little substance between the interactions between Arthur and his men.  The movie begins with them together, they hint that they've been together for a while, but really they just boil down to cardboard cut-outs.  In the end we don't care if so and so gets hurt or killed because there's nothing to back it up.  Arthur goes around preaching of ""Utopia"", but we never see or hear convincingly why he feels passionate about it.  It sinks the film.

For better grit and/or story telling for this myth: I'd recommend ""Excaliber"", ""Merlin"", or even ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" before this one.",1111881600,3,1560,4.722222222222222
2145797,4,B0002YLCFQ,"Coming off a recent disappointing viewing of TROY my expectations for KING ARTHUR were, as a consequence, pretty low.  I'm happy to say I liked this movie quite a bit.  Can't answer for its accuracy, but I can't attack it either.  A lot has changed from the Tennyson/Malory heroes of old.  No search for the Holy Grail (in fact all the knights are pagans, although Arthur is a Christian.)  No steamy romance between Lancelot and Guinevere.  Merlin isn't a wizard; rather, he's a leader of a large tribe of half-naked, tattooed and skin-painted-blue Woad warriors.

  I guess gritty realism is the way to describe it, and I was caught up in it from beginning to end.  The knights here seem closer to a gang of bikers from the wrong part of town than the finer stuff of legend.  Still, director Antoine Fuqua, and the actors, imbue them with a great deal of interesting individuality. From Mads Mikkelsen's stringy haired, hawk carrying, quasi-samurai Tristran to Ray Winstone's earthy and bullet-headed Bors, the characters felt like real people.

  The dvd contains the director's cut, which contains all the blood and gore they had to leave out for the PG-13 release.  There seems to be an awful lot of CGI blood flowing and spurting, which may add to the realism but I thought it looked a little cartoonish.

2145798,3,B0002YLCFQ,"Good effort? Not really. Different, I would say and that's about it. There a lot of bloody good killing going on if that's your taste. I found no real substance to the film. The plot was very thin. It was photographed well and there was one very good and innovative scene of a confrontation which takes place on a large frozen span of ice and snow. There are some good bits  strewn throughout but not enough to make this film anything more than just average.",1111708800,,458,4.3882352941176475
2145799,4,B0002YLCFQ,"For one thing, the description on the dvd of ""The untold true story that inspired a legend"" is a bit too much of an ascertion to make.

As is, no one really knows if Arthur ever existed at all, but it is fun to think what he would have been like, if he had been real.  This movie does a good job in portraying a ""possible"" Arthurian take, but as with anything that takes a favorite story and changes it, will be met by mix reviews.

For one thing, this movie takes out the fantasy aspect of Arthur, such as obvious magic, and replaces it instead with mysticism inherent in cultures at that time.  For one thing, Merlin is not really a magician (or at least we are not shown) but they do add the rumor that he is; of course, in those medieval times, legends about magic tended to be believed to exist.  They also took out the magic behind Excalibur.  Playing a particular large role in Arthurian legends, the sword takes an almost non-existent role; the only time the sword is even mentioned is once, but it's obvious they made it be just your average sword, that happened to be named by Arturius as excalibur.

The famous Gwyenevere(sp?)and Lancelot betrayal of Arthur is pretty much nipped in the butt since Lancelot dies.  Although, the movie did make it obvious that Lancelot fancied Gwyenevere (maybe it's in the extended cut?).

I do approve of the way they portrayed Gwyenevere, mainly because the Celts, I believe, had women warriors and it makes sense that a small rebel force figthing against a greater force (Rome) would have to recruit women to fight as well.

Arthur himself is portrayed somewhat well, by actor Clive Owen. He makes the character's moral sets believable, mainly due to the idea that he was taught by a Roman philosopher that believed every man was created equal.

Lancelot, the character, was ok.  He wasn't really anything close to the what the Arthurian legends say he was.  There was no indication he was ""the best"" of Arthur's knights.  In the stories, if I remember correctly, he was also from France; this is completely changed, since they make him be a Samatiann(sp?).

Overall, this is a good movie.  Worth watching if you want to be entertained for 125 minutes.  If you are an Arthurian purist, I'm not sure if you will like it, but I do suggest you give it a try.

Currently, I placed this movie as the second best Arthurian legend derived movie.  ""Excalibur"" being in my opinion the best to date.",1111449600,,2436,4.558620689655172
2145800,3,B0002YLCFQ,"A very different portrayal of King Arthur, it aims to be the `true' historical portrayal. With all said and done it simply a different perspective, but fans of the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table should be open to a different take on the story.

There was some things I liked about this and some things that I did not. The original story of King Arthur was indeed set before the Saxon invaders from Germany and Denmark succeeded in conquering Great Britain, and the Celtic peoples inhabited the island. As such the knights in shining armor often portrayed in Arthuric legend came considerably later in history. So I liked the idea of the costumes and weapons being closer to the age under portrayal.
I am not sure that I liked the idea of the Knights being `Samartians', men imported by the Romans as mercenaries from somewhere around the Ukraine.  I don't believe there is any evidence for King Arthur and his men as being anything other than indigenous to Britain. I did however like the idea of Guinevere being a Pictish Princess - played by the dark and gorgeous Kiera Knightley. Though I thought it was silly not to have Merlin at Arthur's side as his trusted friend and advisor, and to rather have him as a sort of enemy of Arthur's.

The setting where brilliantly done, it came together well, and the caste was good. I think that Clive Owen added some force to the role of Arthur, and Iiked the casting of his knights especially Ray Winston as the rough and ready Bors.
The movie is entertaining and thrilling and comes together well, even if I did not like all of the way the story was written.

It was better than First Knight , in my opinion, but not as good as Excalibur or Merlin.",1111276800,,1717,4.493589743589744
2145801,5,B0002YLCFQ,"I'll start by saying that I'm a moderate Arthurian enthusiast - I like the Mary Stewart retelling best of all, but the versions that go over the top with sorcery just don't hold my interest.  If you love the legend in its more fantastic form, then this movie is probably not for you.  But if you have an interest in how such a popular legend may have originated, then I highly recommend it - and most definitely get the Director's Cut over the theatrical release.  There are a few extra battle moments that I could take or leave, but the additional character scenes add both substance and understanding.  I love this version of the story for its simplicity and feasibility.  It is a stripped-down exploration of the circumstances and events that could have led one man to take on the mantle of responsibility that Arthur of legend bore, and it is free of the mysticism and spells that clog the legend.  A sadly two-thirds empty Round Table speaks of the reality and loss of years of warfare, and we have here an excellent twist on the Sword in the Stone.

The characterizations of the knights and Arthur are well done, and represent the ragtag collection of men from many different backgrounds that the process of Roman conquest must have amassed.  These are not shining knights but men who control their resentment of long years of servitude.  The personalities of each are distinct and colorful and their relationship and bond with each other is clear.  There is an eloquent scene in which the remaining knights have an entire conversation and reach a mutual decision without one word of dialogue.  Clive Owen presents an Arthur worthy of anyone's loyalty.  Lancelot is a ladies' man, a superb warrior, and an embittered skeptic who, for once, does NOT get the girl and betray the trust of his friend - and for me this was a refreshing and welcome change.  Guenivere as a strong and capable woman (and handy in battle) seems a far more fitting and useful partner for a man who's attempting to unite a nation.

I have to say that the first time I saw the film, I raised an eyebrow at the physics of the frozen lake scene, but have since made my peace with it.  The final confrontation between Arthur's outnumbered forces and the Saxons include tactics reminiscent of William Wallace.  As for the score, Hans Zimmer has composed a theme worthy of the legend, and the score has the haunting thread of Moya Brennan's vocals woven through it.  The atmosphere set by the cinematography and direction is of a barely tamed and beautiful land, and the cast is very well chosen.",1110153600,12,2570,4.650442477876106

2145803,2,B0002YLCFQ,"What a bad movie this is.  It commits the double sin of having nothing to do with the Arthur legend or the real history of Arthur's Britain.  I remember when this movie came out, The History Channel did a tie-in documentary about the real-life candidates for the historical Arthur.  I highly recommend watching that documentary over this film.  Even though the producers of this film sponsored that documentary, they do not appear to have watched it.  The insulting thing is that the film begins with a title card telling us that ""archeological evidence"" tells us that this is what really happened.  Uh-uh.

Why make this film?  They took everything that we love about the Arthur legend and discarded it and then they took everything we love about history and discarded it.  Well, you might say, that has nothing to do with anything - judge the film on its own merits.  Well, OK - it's ENDLESS.  The story they invented is boring, the dialogue is inane, and it exemplifies everything that is wrong with filmmaking today.  This is just another film off the assembly-line.  The higher-ups at the studio probably wanted to cash in on Lord of the Rings and all the other historical epics that have come out recently so they made a cookie-cutter movie of their own.

This movie takes it all on and presents us with a great adventure of King Arthur before he was the King.

The movie presnets us with Arthur as being a general of the Roman army in Briton on the Northern borders battling with bands of local Briton tribes that wanted independence from the Romans, and battling agains the invading Normans (Vikings) who had aspirations of capturing the island for temselves by pushing out the Romans.

Historicall it all makes sense of course and it seems like that has really bugged out a lot of critics..... yeah ... do not let reality or history spoil our childish vision of King Arthur ...

OK the move is exciting .. has some of the greatest battle scenes almost reaching the excellence of the battle scene in Gladiator where the Romans vanquish the barbarian hordes .....

Ok one thing bugged me is that there are a lot of dark scenes, foggy scenes but I guess for the sake of reality, I mean it was mostly set on the northern hills and mountain border of Britain, means that the viewers has to make one concession at least ...

2145805,2,B0002YLCFQ,"When you think about it, what is the collective conception of the Arthurian legend?

Well, it's a myth, for one thing, and an achingly Pre-Raphaelite one at that: a sword magically buried in the stone; the lady of the lake holding aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water; the ambivalent wiles of Merlin, a magician who has slept under a rock for a hundred years; a Merovingian Easter-egg hunt for the Holy Grail; the nasty skulduggery of Merlin's sister Morgana Le Fay; and finally the illictly, tragically requited love between Guinevere and Lancelot. All good, stirring stuff, if you like that kind of thing.

Now imagine how it would play if you took all of that away and were told instead that Arthur was a stony-faced Roman Centurion, his knights a band of cockney-sounding eastern European slaves (shades of an anarcho-syndicalist commune, I couldn't help thinking), Merlin a hairy, daubed (literally!) savage, and Guinevere a sort of skimpily attired, malnourished, blue, Xena Warrior Princess?

Doesn't sound much chop, does it?

And nor is it. (Well, all right, the skimpy warrior princess bit isn't *all* bad). It's not helped by less-than-imaginative borrowing from Braveheart, Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves, Black Hawk Down, and the Lord of the Rings instalments, nor the wheeling in of yet another member of Clannad to sing the theme tune, nor the credulity-taxing back story involving Sarmatian knights who, with Ray Winstone in their midst, sound more East London than East Europe.

Fundamentally, the Arthur story is only interesting as romantic myth. Thus, David Franzoni's justification of the film's historical accuracy on this site misses the point: La Morte d'Arthur is a great story; King Arthur: The Director's Cut is not. By purporting to take all the hocus pocus away, Franzoni has jettisoned anything of any real interest or point (unless you're prepared to see this as some sort of allegory for the Iraq War and, frankly, I'm not).

King Arthur ultimately can't hold a candle to Excalibur, and even that reading must pay fealty to the greatest exploration of the Arthurian legend of them all. Graham Chapman's remains the definitive Arthur, with or without the violence inherent in the system.

2145806,5,B0002YLCFQ,"Enjoyment of this film depends on expectations.  And so, if you don't care about historical reality or Academy Award winning performances, this latest version of the King Arthur myth is a great couple of hours of pure entertainment.  It's set in the year 405 and tells a rather modern version of a courageous and wise Roman King Arthur, who leads a band of brave knights into a variety of battles.

In a short prelude to the main action, the audience learns that these knights have been forced into involuntary servitude as young boys because they come from a tribe of great fighters whose lives the Romans spared because of their bravery.  Their names are familiar - Lancelot, Sir Galahad, Tristan, etc. and they are bonded in the way that men at war bond.  These are the years, however, of the beginning of the decline of the Roman Empire, which has Arthur questioning his own loyalty.  After all, his own mother was a Britton, one of the conquered subjects of Rome.  And he's also the kind of king who believes in freedom and justice for all even though its centuries before these concepts became popular.  But no matter, as played by Clive Owen, he sure does look good in his armor, as do all the knights, who seem to be able to move around quite freely in their seemingly restrictive garments.

Enter Guinevere played by Keira Knightly, an 18-year old beauty, who is so pretty that she steals every scene she's in.  But this Guinevere, however, is no damsel in distress.  After she is rescued from a torture chamber by the good Arthur, we soon learn that she is a woman to be reckoned with.  Not only does she stand the snow in a low cut gown and shoot arrows at the enemy, she also has another costume which looks like a leather bikini with just a narrow leather strap over her chest to bring out her cleavage.  This is appropriate since she is supposed to be from a matriarchal pagan tribe and for this scene she wears body paint.  In this outfit she carries a sword and fights one-on-one with the Saxon bad guys as their red blood splashes on her in strategic places.

I thought the casting was wonderful.  The prelude of the young boys taken away to fight grow up to look pretty much what we would expect them to look like as adults. Lancelot is dark with curly hair for example.  One of the young boys is chubby and he grows up to be a knight called Bors, who is a big lovable giant of man played by Ray Winstone who is cast as the loving father of a dozen children and is seen sometimes holding a baby who looks exactly like him.  I liked the idea that there were no super stars in this production.  This allowed me to see the people as characters, rather than the latest box office draw.

The battle scenes were great.  This was because it was possible to follow certain characters which fleshed out the storyline.  Later, the extras on the DVD explained the difficulty of training all the extras to ride horses, fence and generally look authentic.  The main characters' fights were great also, mostly because they really looked like they were fighting, including the exhaustion that must come after a day of heavy swordplay. I applaud the director for this as well as the film editor, because in a film like this there is a lot of footage to choose from and decisions have to be made as to what to leave in and what lands on the cutting room floor.

This is not a film that will grip my emotions and put tears in my eyes.  But it certainly did engage my attention.  That's why I recommend it.",1109376000,4,3505,4.4375
2145807,2,B0002YLCFQ,"This was a good attempt.  It was probably more historically accurate than any of the plethora of other Arthurian works on film.  I have no complaint concerning the quality thespianism demonstrated here.  The direction was excellent, the photography was wonderful, and I even managed to appreciate the camera angles, CGI used in fog creation, etc.

I don't know about anyone else, but I -like- Magick in my mythology.  Magick is in all mythology; even christian.  It's called something else, of course, but it's all Magick, just the same.

While I enjoyed this attempt, it just was not the Legend of King Arthur I embrace.  The Magick and mysticism are gone from it, and it lost all attraction for me.  It felt like watching Spiderman with no powers, or Superman when he couldn't fly.  It completely failed to capture imagination due to its having none of its own.

If you felt like I did, I highly recommend John Boorman's ""Excalibur.""  That was a magickal endeavor in the name of King Arthur.",1109203200,2,993,4.776470588235294
2145808,2,B0002YLCFQ,"I don't believe director Antoine Fuqa meant ""King Arthur"" to be a comedy or burlesque. So, why was I laughing ten minutes into the film? The movie, about the Roman departure from Britain in the fifth century, and the subsequent invasion of the Saxon hordes, resembles a Hollywood historical epic extravaganza, circa 1960. The first battle scene did me in. The new bishop from Rome, accompanied by a contingent of mighty Roman soldiers on their way to their base near Hadrian's wall, are attacked by Woads, an army of Pictish freedom fighters in delightful blue body paint. Tattoo artists are going to make a bundle from this film! I watched in disbelief as the primitive Picts, on foot, slaughter the mounted elite Romans. Now these are the forces who conquered most of the known world. I don't think these fighting professionals pick-off more than 6 or 7 natives while they, in turn, are being slaughtered. Tell me that's not a rigged fight! Enter the Sarmatian calvary to the rescue, led by their commander, Artorius/Arthur. Suddenly the seemingly invincible Picts are slaughtered like canon fodder, (which has yet to be invented), by the newcomers. How could the Woads be so good one moment and so bad the next?? Talk about contrived! So, from this violent interaction, I concluded that the Romans were the bad guys, the Sarmatians the good ones, and the Woads indeterminate - because Arthur allows their leader to go free. Now, I loved ""Brave Heart,"" ""Rob Roy"" was a good movie too, as was ""Gladiator."" Although Hollywood spectaculars in nature, these movies were believable enough for me to empathize with the characters. I had something to work with - someone to root for!

Not to be picky, but as soon as the various fighting forces begin to parlay I began to giggle. The Sarmatians all have different accents - they sound like representatives from diverse parts the UK, and perhaps Australia. The Romans speak English with heavy Italian accents, and when the Saxons eventually speak their lines, their leader Cerdic, (Stellan Skarsgard) sounds like Joe Cocker with a cold. Their soldiers just grunt, but in different dialects. There must have been a worldwide casting call for this film. This is distracting! The dialogue throughout is too cliched to be campy - are you getting the drift? The plot is too predictable. I did like the idea of a revisionist Arthurian history, but David Franzoni's screenplay destroyed the credibility for me. There are moments of cleverness - but too few and far between. I was, and am, very disappointed.

The Sarmatians, from the steppes of Central Asia, were conquered by Rome, and their sons forced as adolescents to join the Roman calvary for a fifteen year period. After rigorous training, a group of these impressed soldiers are stationed, with their leader Lancelot, (Ioan Gruffudd) in Britain, where they hang-out with local women, breed like rabbits, complain about the weather, gamble and fight the Woads, whenever they venture south of the wall. Their commander is Arthur, (Clive Owen), a man of mixed parentage, who was born and raised in Britain, is loyal to Rome, but also staunchly loyal to his men. And the Sarmatians are devoted to him.

Arthur's knights - Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd), Galahad (Hugh Dancy), Bors (Ray Winstone), Tristan (Mads Mikkelsen), and Gawain (Joel Edgerton) -- are about to return home to their families in Sarmatia after having fulfilled their 15 years of service. Their freedom is to officially begin the day after Bishop Germanius, (Ivano Marescotti), arrives. In this period, just before the Dark Ages, the Catholic Church rules in Rome through the emperor. The villainous prelate forces them to go on one last mission where they see, first-hand, examples of Roman cruelty and the brutality of the Saxon invaders, who are determined to take over where the Roman's leave off. These Nordic warriors show their stuff, amidst many more grunts, roars and bloody hacking during an action-packed battle on ice, which was a highpoint - much better and gorier than the Ice Capades. It is on this mission that they acquire Guinevere, (Keira Knightley), a Woadish nymphet who had been captured and tortured by the Romans in an attempt to convert her to Christianity. She is the cleanest one in the movie, and the prettiest, with a sexy, goth-style wardrobe and pouty lips. As a warrioress, she's good with a bow and arrow, and as a love interest, she sighs her way through love scenes with Arthur.

Arthur and his band of merry knights decide to stay and fight for Britain, and join forces with Merlin, (Stephen Dillane), the Woad leader, to expel the Saxons. The rest is not history, nor even legend. Boo!

It is dreary (It looks like someone smeared motor oil over the lense), boring, and completely uninvolving.  It Antoine Fuqua's effort to tell the gritty, ""true"" story of Arthur and his Knights he has single-handedly sucked the magic out of the story.  Every scene is either in rain, fog, or darkness.  Everyone looks absolutely dreadful.  If this is ""gritty"", I prefer magical.  There is hardly anyone in the film to care about.  Clive Owen does his best, but cannot save this dreadful telling.  I prefer ""First Knight,"" which, while controversal (understandably) to Arthurian purists and the much buzzed about casting of Richard Gere as Lancelot, the movie shined.  Camelot has never looked so magical and sumptuous.  It looked like a place you would want to visit.  Sean Connery as King Arthur is genius.  Julia Ormond made the loveliest of all Guineveres.  Richard gere, while miscast, does a great job.  His kiss with Julia Ormond is one of the great screen kisses, intense, erotic, and passionate.

2145812,1,B0002YLCFQ,"OK I understand there is something called literary license, and myths were made to be reinvented.  Also, myths and legends are often based on historical fact, and it is interesting to speculate what the historical fact might be.  The trouble with this movie is that it doesn't know if it is reinventing the myth or discovering the historical fact and it fails miserably at both.  First, if the legend of Arthur is based on historical fact, it is probably based on someone who live some time after the Romans withdrew from Britain.  There would have been no Romans left to rescue.  And the notion that Arthur was a Sarmatian warrior?  Frankly it's just too absurd to take seriously.  Moreover, not only is there is no reason to concoct this stuff, there is every reason not to.  The notion of Arthur and his knights being foreigners whose one desire (after they rescue the Romans) was to go home undermines the most important aspect of the Arthur myth--the idea that Arthur was fighting to defend his country, to establish a just government for his people.  As for the movie's reinventing myth...what can I say?  I can only groan. I even tried to keep an open mind about what they did to Guenevere.  After all, Celtic women really did fight alongside their men.  But I doubt that they wore the movie actress' ridiculous Hollywood getup. Worse, I detected nothing going on between either Arthur and Guenevere or Guenevere and Lancelot.  There seemed to be no passion between any of them.

2145825,4,B0002YLCFQ,"I did not see the theatrical release of this movie so I don't have a reference point for the quality of the extended director's edition as opposed to the original. I know that most of the extra footage came during the battle scenes, making them so long as to almost become boring, and it takes a lot for a battle scene to bore me. Other than this, I found the story to be quite intriguing, being Hollywood's take on the ""real"" King Arthur, an attempt to demythologize the legend in the same way the filmmakers of Troy had done. The plot centers on Arthur, a half-British, half-Sarmatian soldier in the service of the Roman Empire in the waning days of her glory. He is the commander of the Roman outpost at Hadrian's Wall in Britain -a territory that Rome has decided to abandon - and events force him to decide whether he wants to stay in Britain amid the chaos that the Roman pullout will cause or to go another way, either to Rome itself or back to Sarmatia with the rest of his knights. It's a clever way of imagining how the historical Arthur - if he indeed was a real figure - might have grown into the legend that we know. Interestingly enough, the film does teach a bit of church history, as it has Pelagius being an influential figure in Arthur's early life. Thus the young soldier has a strong belief in free will, and resists any hint that he might have a destiny as the future ruler of Britain. Although I do not think it was the screenwriter's aim to correct Arthur's doctrine on this point, Arthur seems to get the picture, as he (obviously) embraces his destiny, a concept that he formerly did not believe in. Christian behavior and practice are also important concepts in the film, as Arthur the good Christian teaches some bad Christians a lesson about tolerance. Overall I would call the movie's portrayal of the Christian faith as more positive than negative. Arthur makes a strong statement about the value of faith in the face of ridicule by the pagan knights that follow him, particularly Lancelot. But Lancelot later admits to Guinevere that his lack of faith has made him a man of less character than Arthur. The believability factor throughout the film is fairly high until the end, where the director wants us to believe that a ninety pound waif like Keira Knightley is a ferocious warrior on the battlefield. Also, the number of ""hero fights"" in the last battle is ridiculous: Guinevere vs. the Saxon leader's son, Lancelot vs. the Saxon leader's son, Tristan vs. the Saxon leader, and finally Arthur vs. the Saxon leader. I like a good mano y mano swordfight between the hero and the villain as much as the next guy, but in this case it stretches credibility. King Arthur is a quality film overall, however, and I think it will be part of my DVD collection in the future.",1108771200,3,2799,4.544554455445544
2145826,2,B0002YLCFQ,"I was so looking forward to this film. And then I saw that Jerry Bruckheimer was involved and I knew it was doomed from the start.

Antoine Fuqua is a fine director (Training Day was fantastic); it's just too bad that he had Jerry and his marketing idiots working against him. I mean really, cutting parts of a movie to get a PG-13 rating so more people will go see a movie in the theaters. There's warning sign number one there's something wrong with the movie.

Then the only reason that there are characters named Lancelot, Bors, Tristan and the others are there is for name-dropping and marketing purposes. Warning sign number two.

I have studied the Arthurian legends and history for 20 years and I thought it would be a novel approach to have a movie about the ""historical"" Arthur. Remove the whole Arthur-Guinevere-Lancelot love triangle, remove the Grail and remove all the ideas added by the French in the 14-century and return to ""history"". Unfortunately, the average viewer (no offense to anyone intended) will not watch a movie about Arthur without Lancelot and all that baggage (that's why the French added it, to sell books to the aristocracy).

The movie is supposed to be an updated telling of the Arthur story from a historical perspective. Arthur and his companions are soldiers in the Roman Army at the end of their service and have to complete one last mission. There have been many recent books following along this line (the Bernard Cornwell and Jack Whyte series are excellent interpretations along this path).

Great starting point but alas, poor execution. I was okay with the name-dropping, but the movie is still bad. Poor script, poor acting (Clive Owen excepted), poor everything. Which is very surprising considering the cast: Clive Owen, Ray Winstone, Stellan Skarsgard. What a waste of great talent. I really tried to like it, but I just can't.

I thought the director did a good job of making these larger than life characters real.  I really only have a couple of complaints.  In their attempt to make the movie more historical, Arthur was a Roman (fine), his cavalry was called (knights) a bit harder to believe but ok, Arthur and his Knights were sent on a mission to the North of Hadrian's Wall to rescue a Roman family.  This I have a problem with.  No Roman lived beyond the Wall.  To do so was to committ suicide.  That is the one major problem I have this the movie.  No Roman in their right mind would ever go to live beyond Hadrians Wall.  In the extended dvd, I liked the emphasis on Pelagius, which did occurr as well as the more fleshed out characters.  Clive Owen as Arthur tends to give too many profound speeches but he has the look of a king.  I also liked the fact that the screenwriter defended his screenplay on amazon.com.  Well done.

2145832,3,B0002YLCFQ,"When we did the obligatory Arthurian tour through southwestern England 20 years ago, we saw Tintagel. We saw Glastonbury (where some monks dubiously claimed to have found the bones of u-no-who).  Amesbury, where Guinevere was exiled to a nunnery (no nunnery here, however, or other 6th c. ruins).  We saw Camelot - a flat-topped hill that was the site of a long-gone stone age fort.  It was a beautiful day, even sunny, a rarity for the area.  No trace of a castle though. I had read Morris' ""Age of Arthur"" and understood fully that Arthur was a dimly-documented 6th century figure that may have checked the Anglo-Saxon advance on the Romano-Britons, but not the silver-armoured knight of 14th century hagiography. And what was I thinking sitting on the hill at Camelot? All that I could hear going through my head was Richard Harris singing from that ridiculous Broadway tune, ""Camelot! Camelot! Where we write the legal laws!""  My mind was filled with media gunk!

So I was ready for ""King Arthur"" which in ads promised to tell the real story of King Arthur as the savior of the Britons against the invading Saxons - getting the chronology rolled back to something close to the 6th c.(assuming the guy lived at all).  What do we get?  Some concession to history, but otherwise your typical bearskins and clubs Hollywood mush.  I'd like to beleive, really. But:

1.  Assuming spotty 8th century records are accurate (a leap of faith), Arthur would have been somewhere in the late 5th to 6th century AD.  The movie has him as a Roman legionary or auxillary. Probably not. The Roman legions left the island for good around AD 410 to save what was left of the colapsing Empire and fight the incessant civil wars.  Whoever was left would have been worrying about the Saxon Shore and interior settlements, not Hadrian's Wall which was long abandoned.  This Arthur is depicted as a foreign auxilary from the Russian steppes, so, let's give a pass here.

2.  The movie's reference to the Arian heresy is nice, but the victory of the Roman church did not result in an early Spanish inquisition agianst everyone else as indicated. There were too many other sects (e.g. Mithras) still around. I also don't think personal or nationalist freedom was a selling point for either Christian sect - this is about 14 centuries too soon.  Which leads to...

3.  The idiot Roman villa NORTH of Hadrian's wall?? In the 5th century? And the owner has an Italian accent?

4.  Guenevere is certainly a dish in her peak-a-boo leather warrior outfit. I saw somthing like it in a shop in San Francisco on Duboce.  Not exactly Sir Mallory here, that's for sure.

Unfortunately, too much of the movie consists of crowded battle scenes between the Mad-Max/Conan attired Saxons (grunt, kill), Arthur's soldiers, and the ""Woads"" whom I suspect are Picts. These battles are noisy and nothing special, but take up way too much of the movie, drowning out the few attempts to establish an alternative history.

This is realy quite harmless fun, as about as historically accurate as Monty Python's ""Holy Grail"", but it looks like Hollywood's  brainwashing a la Mallory will remain.  The most watchable Arthurian movie remains Boorman's ""Excalibur"", with a real Merlin instead of the nonentity in King Arthur.  And Venessa Redgrave will always be Guinevere to me.

I do recommend Berkeley author Marion Zimmer Bradley's ""Mists of Avalon"" (not the silly made-for TV movie, but the book) for an  alternative take on the Arthur legend.",1107820800,3,3496,4.8482293423271505

At no point in the movie was any sort of historical consistency built.  Right from the beginning, anachronisms and neopagan fantasies pervade the film.  The writers pick and choose which aspects of the Arthurian legends fit their particular bigoted view of history.  This is all well and good for a fantasy, but the creators of ""King Arthur"" are clearly pushing the idea that their version is accurate.

The work is overtly derivative of Braveheart - Arthur & his Knights use the word ""Freedom"" like they were speechwriters for George Bush.  But the movie lacks Braveheart's appeal of being an interesting story, well acted, and hyperbolic from a basis in reality.

It was fascinating to see the bigotry of the authors displayed through their absurd, hamhanded and unrelenting attacks on Christianity.  They extrapolate an enlightenment-era secular sensibility back onto the Sarmatian barbarians, and then feel that it's necessary to paint post-Constantinian Christianity as equivilent to the Inquisition.

For all the writers' handwaving about correcting the Arthurian legend back from a Christianized medieval fiction, their ""improvement"" is an Arthur who would be much more plausible in 1990's San Francisco.

But the above statements are just minor observations.  The real problem with the movie is that it is simply goofy.  The little fight on the frozen river, the Roman settlement north of Hadrian's wall, the walled-up torture chamber, Guenivere getting a sponge bath in a see-through litter in the snow, the salute of flaming arrows, and the whole climactic battle-scene at Hadrian's wall... all were sophomoric and trite.

2145862,3,B0002YLCFQ,"This was a hard movie to rate. I was prepared to hate this movie after seeing the trailers last year because they looked horrid. But I didn't hate it. I have issues with it, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.

My issues are that they use the character names from the Arthurian mythology but not the legend itself. If you don't like the legend, name your characters something else and don't use the name of King Arthur to sell your movie. Another issue is the movie is rife with inaccuracies from historical facts to weaponry and armor to battle tactics. Is it too much to ask that they get something right? The third issue is the atrocious dialog you come to expect from a Bruckheimer production.

Once I was able to let these things go and relax, I enjoyed the movie. There are some good performances despite the silly things they have to say. There is a very good scene of a battle on a frozen lake where the ice is cracking and the Pictish warriors have a good look and feel to them. Don't think too much and don't expect to learn anything.

2145873,2,B0002YLCFQ,"Despite the assertions of the screenwriter, this movie is not an accurate revisiting of the Arthur legend based on current archaeological evidence.  Nor does it come close to following the legends themselves.  At best, it takes a few character names, the general historical background of Rome's pullout from Britain and a lot of far-fetched speculation about what might have been and comes up with . . . what?

For those who have researched the Arthurian legends and their historical framework, this movie is a joke.  Yes, Arthur probably was either a Roman or a Romanized Briton.  Guinevere could certainly have been warrior maid along the lines of Boudicca, and Merlin as a Druid priest/leader also is logical and follows what archaeological ""proof"" exists.  But as for the rest of the movie, it is pure speculation.  In the absence of any new hard evidence, it would have been more effective to use as much of the Arthurian legend as possible while trying to make the legends accord with the time period.  However, the filmmakers decided that pure fantasy would be much easier!

If you want a movie that does a better job of depicting what a classic literary hero might actually have been and done, try The Thirteenth Warrior, Michael Crichton's retelling of the Beowulf saga.",1107216000,3,1279,4.911627906976745
2145874,5,B0002YLCFQ,"This movie didn't sit too well with the critics. Nor did it gain much box office success. However, that does not make this film any less grand. Since the story has already been explained by other reviews, I guess I can go without telling it in detail. Basically, it tells the tale of a half-Roman, half-Briton officer Artorius in charge of a dwindling Sarmatian cavalry unit. The day before they are supposed to gain their freedom from service to Rome, they are given a final, and quite suicidal, mission. What follows is some good music, acting, cinematography, and a dangerous adventure in which Arthur, and his knights later on, find out who they are and where they stand. ""King Arthur"" personally touched me as a moving story about the evils and hopelessness in the world and the hero in our hearts that urges us to fight back. Since Arthur's soldiers aren't really the privileged and wealthy knights of the Middle Ages, but rather men drafted since childhood to fight for a land not their own, their conflicts and heroics become that much more real and touching. Those who see this film as an attack on the church or as an insult to historical facts are missing the point. The movie aims to tell a good and entertaining story that keeps the appeal of the Arthurian legend. Be open-minded! After all, it keeps the noble nature of the main characters who supposedly become the subject of the legends later on, only this time around it gives them some realism. It really makes you believe that heroes aren't just the stuff of fairy tales anymore.",1107129600,,1548,4.673992673992674
2145875,3,B0002YLCFQ,"Wow, instead of noble King Arthur wearing a crown sitting in a white castle amongst green fields, we have a roman general fighting braveheart like warriors in Britan.  Interesting eh?

I never saw King Arthur in theaters, and I was not really interested in seeing it anyway.  When it came out on DVD I decided to take a look.

Early on I was quite suprised with the movie.  It had an interesting start, and the early battles were interesting (if a bit long).  The scenery was gorgeous and the story was moving along quite well.  All seemed good and true, but after the halfway mark had passed, I actually began to loose interest in the movie.  Not even huge battles could really get my interest back.

I think that the main problem with King Arthur is that it kind of goes on too long.  This being an unrated directors cut, there are apparently several minutes of battles and gore put back into the movie that were apparently cut out for the theatrical release.  To be honest, the new battle scenes don't really add much.  They also make the battle scenes go on and on to the point where a battle that should last at the most, five minnutes soon stretches out to ten minutes of non-stop chopping, hacking and slicing.  Well, it may not be ten minutes, but it felt that way.  When the final battle came on, it just kept going and going and going.  By the end of it I was actually bored!  I kept thinking, ""Come on, get it over with.""  Not a good sign.  At that point, I didint care about the heroes or if they would win or not.

So in my opinion, the biggest problem with the movie is that the battle scenes need to be trimmed down.  From my experience in film classes, you need to keep a battle as short as possible instead of dragging it out.  It would also have helped to have some overhead shots showing all the soldiers fighting by the thousands.  Those would have really helped make the battles more interesting.

Oh wait, theres the rest of the movie to review?  OK.  The scenery, props and costuming department really shine in this movie.  The scenery of Britan is absaloutly gorgeous, to the point where I'd like to take a vacation to visit some of the locales.  The costumes feel really authentic (well, except for the much talked about leather brassiere) and make the movie more believable.  I also must mention the great ice battle sequence, which was a refreshingly origianal take on ""How can seven guys hold off seven hundred guys?"".  The acting was on the whole, mediocre.  The only charachter I was really interested in was the main bad guy (who is never named in the movie), who spends most of his time killing people and frowning.

Personaly, I found the idea for the film being set in roman times with Arthur as a Roman general to be fascinating.  We've all heard and read about how Arthur was the romantic gentlemen.  Here, he's a figher with morals and beliefs, and to enforce those beliefs, he often has to slice and dice.  I won't get into how historically accurate this setting is, but I find it quite refreshing.

So in the end, this movie is simply OK.  It's not great, it's not awful, it's just a middle of the road, average movie that with some more improvments, could have been really good.",1106956800,,3218,4.450342465753424
2145876,1,B0002YLCFQ,"Where do I start?  Why make this movie and use the names of the knights?  Why, after just making their way through the snow, is Guinevere half naked, fighting warriors.  A total embarrassment for history lovers.",1106697600,7,211,4.805555555555555
2145877,4,B0002YLCFQ,"I missed this in the movies and so waited eagerly for its release in the DVD. I love a good epic, on film or in print, the closer to the way things really might have been, the better. And I think this version of King Arthur fulfills that criterion quite nicely. The real Arthur remains an historical mystery but, as others have commented here, his origins may fairly be found in the history of Romanized Britain as the Romans were withdrawing to leave their mixed Celtic and Roman subjects to the mercy of the barbarian Germanic invaders who were being pushed westward by other barbarians (like the Huns) or by the forces of nature (the erosion of their coastal lands in what is today's northern Germany and southern Scandinavia). Indeed, the Germanic Saxons who are the heavies of this film came, according to Geoffrey of Monmouth's History of the Kings of Britain and the later Anglo-Saxon Chronicles, as mercenaries to serve in the late Romano-British armies maintained by the leaders who remained after the Roman legions had formally withdrawn.

Initially the Saxons aided the local rulers to withstand raids from the Irish Scots and the Picts from what is today Scotland and from nearby Ireland. But these Saxons (and their cousin tribes, the Angles and the Jutes) were land hungry and liked what they saw when they came to serve in the British kings' hosts. As they came to realize their strength relative to their native employers they began to demand more and more land and autonomy for themselves and even to marry one of their daughters to the main British monarch, Vortigern (who is generally condemned by Geoffrey for importing the Saxons in the first place).

Cerdic, the Saxon leader, and his cohorts eventually conceived the idea of bringing over their families and fellow tribesmen and soon fell out with Vortigern over the land. Thus began a multi-generational tug of war for possession of the Isle of Britain. It's against this backdrop that the Arthurian legends grew up. Arthur, whether a Roman military commander or a local king or a commander who became a king, seems to have struggled to hold back the Germanic tide but, in the end, the effort he began was fated to fail as the Britons were driven into the western highlands of the island, to become today's Welsh, while the Angles, Saxons and Jutes expanded, warred and eventually consolidated as the Anglo-Saxons in time to face a new invader from their old haunts, the Danish and Norse vikings. By the time of the Norman invasion by William the Conqueror, the Anglo-Saxons were known as the Anglish or the English, a largely Germanic group of people who had intermarried with many of the Britons they had absorbed and come to rule.

The notion that the tales of Arthur were founded on a Roman dux (war leader, the modern variant of which is our ""duke"") who led Sarmatian cavalry is intriguing. The Sarmatians came from the steppes of what is today southern Russia and the idea that they were proto-Russians, as manifested in their war cry of ""Rus,"" is certainly interesting, if not based on historical fact. In truth the eytemology of the term ""Rus"" is unknown, but the Russian Primary Chronicle, not so different from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle in England, ascribes it not to the southern steppe tribes but to the Varangians who invaded the land that was to one day be called Russia from the north. Notably, these Varangians were Scandinavians, just like the Vikings in the west and, perhaps, not unlike the Angles, Saxons and Jutes who had invaded Britain in a slightly earlier period.

I liked the fast pace and tight scripting of this film (it kept me on the edge of my seat much of the time) though it had a certain artificiality to it, essential, perhaps, to achieve its dramatic effect. But there is nothing in the record to suggest that the legends of Arthur are all based on a relatively brief excursion to a Roman outpost north of the Wall. Nor is there any reason to suppose there would have even been such an outpost among the barbarous Picts (called Woads in the film) above the Wall, beyond the safety of the legions at that period. Why indeed bother to build and man a wall to keep the Picts and Scots out if you are going to establish settlements in the region beyond the reach of the legions at the Wall?

Moreover, my own reading suggests that much of the action in the Arthurian tales occurred in the south, not in the north near Hadrian's Wall, and that Cerdic and Cynric, his son, established themselves as successive leaders of their people for a time. Indeed, I don't recall them both dying in a single battle, such as the one this film presents, before the Roman Wall. Beyond that, I thought the presentation of Cerdic as a kind of Ur-Nazi fuehrer, and the Saxons as storm trooper automatons in bearskins and armor, a little over the top. While the portrayal of Cerdic in the film was sufficiently nuanced to make him an interesting foe, it's highly unlikely that he would have been as thoughtless for his men as he is presented, sending one troop in to die with barely a thought for their welfare or countenancing the killing of the one man who returns as though he were a worthless beast.

Not only would any leader who treated his men like that have a hard time keeping them with him, but among the Germanic peoples of the north such a leader would have been quickly bereft of followers for these people were amazingly disputatious and free-spirited, only following the war leaders who could command their loyalty. The brutal, almost inhuman, killer this film makes Cerdic out to be would have been without an army behind him rather quickly. Still as written and portrayed in the film, he was a pleasure to watch, a dark and world weary villain who, if not historically accurate, at least added dramatic dimension to the tale.

A related concern I had was the way Cerdic forbids raping the women to avoid miscegenation. This has racist overtones more appropriate to latter day Europe than to the era of barbarian migrations, nor does it accord with the historical habits of the Germanic warriors of the period, or of most warriors for that matter, since rape was part of the reward these barbarians expected. But even if they were going to kill all the conquered people, which Cerdic would not have bothered to do until he had already established his tribe in the land (which is not suggested in this film at all), there's no reason for him to have prevented his men from raping the women first and then killing them. There is just no logic to it.

And the battle scenes, while nicely handled, gave us an almost endless heroic slaughter that seemed a bit unbelievable as warriors with spears through their backs go on to fight like unscathed heroes, while others yank arrows from their chests in order to plunge back into the fray. Only the Saxon host seems genuinely mortal until, at last, the Sarmations finally begin to die off, after numerous plucked arrows, speared backs and slashed torsos and legs. I rather expected them to be out of the fight much sooner which, since this is presented as the anti-legend of Arthur, ought to have been how it was handled in my opinion.

So the film gets mixed reviews on story logic and historical accuracy from me. But as a tightly told historical epic, it was a lot of fun and intriguing to see how the Arthurian legend might be portrayed, shorn at last of its layers of Welsh, French and later English medieval narrative paraphernalia.

2145878,3,B0002YLCFQ,"I saw this movie in theatres and liked it very much. However, when I brought the unrated and so-called 'extended' version of the film home, I was rather disappointed. Oh, sure, they added a whole bunch of new battle scenes, but they also cut out some of the amusing parts that I enjoyed in the theatre. I don't think it's true, when they say it's extended. They could say it's 'different', but not 'extended'. I suppose there must have been an issue about continuity within the film to make them do it, but it is disappointing. When I see the word 'extended' on a DVD's cover, I expect them to have added more, not taken away bits and pieces and then added slivers of battle scenes.",1106352000,7,682,4.420634920634921
2145879,5,B0002YLCFQ,"Did King Arthur actually exist? Historians are divided in their answers, although most now believe that yes, such a man did live in or around the 5th century A.D.  This Arthur came to the aid of the Britons during an early period of relentless Saxon assaults upon the island. Arthur, these historians believe, was not a man of the Middle Ages who was served by the classic English knights of our imaginings, nor was the Lady Guinevere probably anything like most of us may have imagined. Instead, the Arthur of legend probably was the Duc Bellorum -- Duke of War -- said to have fought several great battles with the Saxons, the greatest of which -- Baden Hill -- is depicted in the film.

Sure, the film plays fast and loose with some known historical facts, namely the extent of the early Roman Catholic Church's influence with Rome's emperor and other leaders, the making of Bishop Germanicus to be such a villain (was he? He was later canonized as St. Germaine).  For the sake of 'literary license,' these small items can be overlooked in Fuqua's pursuit of a unifying whole that does a respectable job of pulling together what is believed to have been true about Arthur.

Was he truly a king? No one knows, but again it appears from an early time that Britons had rallied around someone to beat back the Saxons. If Arthur wasn't a king, through the years the legends that grew up around him, his knights and their exploits made him one.

As for Arthur's knights, the movie puts forth an hypothesis supported by at least a few modern historians: that Arthur's knights were Sarmatians, known as great warriors who fought from the backs of horses. Sarmatians came from the same area as the later Cossacks, also known for their derring-do as horse cavalry.

I was entranced by this film, by the cinematography, the costumes, the grandeur of the countryside and the supreme compatibility of Hans Zimmer's magnificent score. The acting was superb as well.

Was the historical Arthur brave enough to wait behind, alone, for the inevitable Saxon onslaught as his comrades-in-arms left him? According to legend, which has been passed down since the time of Arthur, that day at Baden Hill Arthur's sword alone took over 900 Saxon lives. This account might have been slightly exaggerated in the same way that Antoine Fuqua's film has been altered to fit what is thought to have been true about Arthur.

Either way, Arthur is a man -- and a king -- for the ages. If such a man existed, he set the bar extraordinarily high for all the other heroes who would someday follow him in service to humankind.

The music in Zimmer's score is both grand and eloquent; it suits the script to a 'T.'

Neither Fuqua nor Zimmer could have done any better. King Arthur and the soundtrack are just about perfect.",1106352000,5,2789,4.6850715746421265
2145880,2,B0002YLCFQ,"I missed this film when it came to theaters, because it disappeared so quickly.  This was one of the summer releases in 2004 that I was most looking forward to see, because there hasn't been a major film that I'm aware of that covers the legend of King Arthur and his knights of the Roundtable.  When it was released on DVD, I took a gamble in buying it, since I'd never seen it previously.  I thought no one could mess up a film like this, but I was wrong.  This is one of the biggest disappointments I've ever experienced watching a film, and its not like I had huge expectations before I watched it.  I was looking forward to seeing a big screen treatment of King Arthur that was equal to if not better than the film version of ""Robin Hood"" (the Kevin Costner film that unfortunately doesn't hold up well with the passage of time).  Like another film reviewer said, this one is not ""Gladiator"" or even ""Troy"".  I would even say that this isn't even ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" or ""A Knight's Tale"".

The main problem I have with this film is probably all of the battle scenes.  The filmmakers probably didn't count on the audience fatigue of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, in which the battle scenes were exceptionally well done in all three films.  After that trilogy, epic films centered on battle scenes aren't going to captivate audiences, so that's probably the biggest flaw this film made.  Had they focused more on the interpersonal drama and storytelling through dialogue and human interactions, it would have made a much better film.

Unfortunately, this film lacks warmth of any kind.  The scenes are dark and dreary, which is perfect for mood setting, but a whole film like that?  There is little sense of humor or funny dialogue that lightens the film, instead we get a treatment of Arthur that is entirely too serious.  It moves along slowly, and the entire plot rests on three key battle scenes...one in the opening, one in the middle and the big finale.  I would have preferred to see more of the intellect of King Arthur, how he related to people and why he became a legend...something beyond his display of courage and strength on the battlefields.  There's more to King Arthur than violence and killing of enemies, but we just don't see it.

The reason I give it two stars is because I like Clive Owen and the flaws of this film are in no way attributed to him.  He is a perfect King Arthur, in an imperfect movie.  The second star goes to one of the best scenes I have ever seen in any movie.  The middle battle scene that takes place on a frozen lake is clever, original, and exceptionally well done.  Its the only thing worth seeing in this film, unfortunately, but it is something to watch with marvel.  Too bad they didn't spend more time making the rest of the film worth watching.  I guess someone should send a memo to Hollywood:  epic films with little more than battle scenes are box office bombs.  If you don't believe me...look at the disappointing returns of ""King Arthur"" and ""Alexander"".  ""Troy"" is marginally better because the story worked.  However, after the brillant success of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, I'd say that people are just battle-worn-out.  Let the genre rest a few years.  When you've seen one battle scene, you pretty much seen them all, and there's no reason why any movie should base its whole plot on three key battle scenes.  That tells you right there there isn't a story worth telling, so they should go back to the drawing board until they get a story that's worth telling that doesn't rely so much on battles as it does on the wits and conversations that carry better films.",1106352000,3,3648,4.549079754601227
2145881,2,B0002YLCFQ,"I have no problem with the concept of this movie, however the execution was poor. Clive Owen is simply unconvincing, he just comes across as too weak when you compare him to the other knights. I just could not understand why they would follow him, as he didn't convey the charisma that a strong  leader would definitely possess. I think he is a good actor but he was mis-cast in this role.

The cinematograhpy of the big battle set pieces was good, however the other scenes come across as flat, and the camera work is iffy.

The screen play again had some good ideas but they were just not brought together very well. It just seemed disjointed---maybe this was the editing.

Compared to Troy and Gladiator this movie is definitely 2nd rate.",1106265600,,740,4.583333333333333
2145882,5,B0002YLCFQ,"I think this movie didn't do well in the theatres for two reasons: 1. no nudity.  2. no nudity.

Everything else about the movie is the stuff that blockbusters are made of.  The scenery: snow covered mountains and forests, paths through the woods, frozen lakes, castle walls, Roman council chambers is absolutely spectacular and dream-inspiring.  The plot is fascinating and the history quite accurate, down to the battle-tactics.  The fighting is superb and the costumes are great.  There are many touching scenes and a lot of exciting war scenes.  When I first saw the movie I could not believe the whole 'freedom' spiel that Arthur was giving throughout the movie, but upon researching Arthur's mentor Pelagius, I discovered that, yes indeed, this 'heretical' belief in the innate freedom of the individual was current at the time.  However, while the proof of history puts Artorius in the 2nd Century A.D., this movie places him seemingly in the 4th or 5th, and I am not quite sure why, since there is nothing to recommend the 5th Century cinematically over the 2nd.  In fact, placing the film in the 2nd would have made it a contemporary series of events to those of 'Gladiator', the writer's other major film, thus keeping it historically accurate and making it something of a 'sequel' as well.  To make my point short though, what I thought is anachronistic about the film is in fact quite historical and it was my misunderstanding of the period that made me think it was not.  The music in this movie is supremely haunting and enchanting.  In a sense, this film is like a take-off on the first battle scene of 'Gladiator': Romans and Germans battling it out in the Northern forests.

2145903,4,B0002YLCFQ,"Historians and scholars will debate the King Arthur mystery for many more centuries. Are they accurate? Will there ever be a consensus? Probably not!

Meanwhile, Hollywood will produce each depiction for the public to dissect. The ""King Arthur"" (2004) DVD follows Artorius (Clive Owen) as half Briton half Roman. His knights are made up Sarmatain fighters. The Romans conquered the Sarmatain Empire, so as a condition of survival all of their male offspring must serve the Roman Empire for fifteen years.  Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd) is the most recognized name in King Arthur's court. But in this movie he is just part of the knight round table. Ray Winstone's character Bors steals the show from all the other knights.

The knight's last mission before their tour of duty ends is to rescue a Roman family that is about to be invaded by the Saxons. Merlin's Briton fighters do not fight for the Roman Empire, but fight for native Britons. Merlin knows Artorius is half Briton, so he decides his fight is not with him but the Saxons. Guinevere (Keira Knightley) is saved by Artorius but fights for Merlin. The battle ending is not for the faint of heart.

I like this DVD for its action scenes and overall feel for time depiction. Ireland's location was perfect for filming the countryside shots. David Franzoni wrote the script. (See his comments on historical accuracy in the Spotlight review) It is nice to see some comments from the actual scriptwriter.

The unrated Director's cut is for intense battle scenes. There are many graphic head and limb departures utilizing the almighty sword.",1106092800,,1590,4.940074906367041
2145904,5,B0002YLCFQ,"I did not see ""King Arthur"" when it was in theaters but I wish that I had seen it on a big screen.  To be truthful, having seen the trailers I was not sure about the casting or that the story would be interesting.  I was wrong on both counts.  What appeals to me about this story of King Arthur is that it goes against the romanticized stories of the Knights of the Round Table and the search for the Holy Grail.  This is the historic Arthur or Lucius Artorius Castus.  What is known about this legendary hero is that he defeated the Saxons and established control over a large part of England.  The story presented in the film has Arthur and his Sarmatian cavalry (recruited from the modern day area of Hungary) in the days before the fall of Rome as the only effective force that maintains law and order in what was once a Roman province.

There is a round table in this Arthur, signifying the equality of the knights, which dismays Bishop when he sees he will not be given preferential treatment.  Guinevere, however, is not simply the object of Arthur's (and Lancelot's) affection but is a tribal warrior maiden; and Merlin in a tribal leader who is opposed to Arthur and the dwindling authority of Rome.  Keira Knightly, playing Guinevere, has come in for a good deal of mirth for her portrayal of a warrior rather than the traditional role of Arthur's Queen.  However, now that archaeological evidence has proved that there really were Amazons and we know that women fought as gladiators and, recently, even serving with the legions in Britain, it should not be so shocking a leap to have Guinevere as a warrior.  Although Ms. Knightly has scenes where she is the only woman fighting with men, there are also scenes in the final battle where she is one of several women.  It may seem odd that her body is painted blue (not just face-paint) but it is certainly true that tribal people did paint themselves.

Clive Owen does a magnificent job playing Arthur and is well supported by Ioan Gruffudd (Lancelot), Mads Mikkelsen (Tristan), Hugh Dancy (Galahad), Ray Winstone (Bors) and Ray Stevenson (Dagonet).  I liked Keira Knightly and Stephen Dillane made Merlin an interesting opponent/ally.  My only complaint is that Hadrian's Wall looked a bit skimpy for it being the location of one of the forts.  There are massive doors but the fortifications are lacking.  The location (in Ireland) was well chosen and the costumes were designed with some accuracy in mind, although one of the Roman cavalry helmet reminded me more of Japanese samurai. King Arthur is a film that will hold your interest and, hopefully, make one think about the real Arthur.  The story is well-conceived and brought to life by great actors; it is a film that deserves far more attention.",1106006400,,2764,4.687370600414079

Arthur, played by Clive Owen, was a very boring character - he would only do what was right, and he always triumphed. Whenever things started to seem more dull than usual, they killed someone off to make the stakes higher. About half-way through the movie, I started wished it'd be Arthur who died.

The point of this movie seemed to be: If you think you're right and they're wrong, kill them.

I don't think in today's world it would rate an R rating, so they probably could have left it at PG 13.

2145907,5,B0002YLCFQ,"Just a few thoughts for those of you thinking about buying this DVD.  I'm commenting on the Unrated Extended version and did not see the movie in the theaters.

First, I found the movie surprisingly good.  Part of the reason I did not see this movie in the theater is that (to be honest) the trailers and clips I saw of the film before it was released just looked corny.  The scene where Arthur meets the Saxon leader for the first time looked like a bad immitation of a bad Clint Eastwood movie.  The scene where Arthur makes his ""freedom"" speech in front of his knights looked like a bad immitation of Mel Gibson in Braveheart.

However, in the context of the story, these scenes are not only more believable, but meaningful as well.  This is part of what I liked about this movie.  The director does an excellent job building the stories and characters as the story moves to its climax.  Rather than just a series of battles with some story thrown in to link them (or a story with some battles thrown in for excitement), the whole movie seems to move and grow.  Even if you can guess the outcome from the beginning, you'll want to see how the movie gets there and ends.

I won't comment much on the story itself since there are many more here who have already written about it and know much more than I do.  I'll just say thanks to the script writer who commented here and for pointing out the key differences between this version and the theatrical version.  I'll just add that I thought the story was interesting and believable for someone who isn't a scholar in the subject.  There is also an alternate ending that adds some emotional closure to the story (although at the cost of some flow, which is why I suspect it wasn't used).

Second, I also found this a surprisingly good DVD in terms of sound and picture quality.  The sound was deep and clear on my home theater system.  At times the dialogue was a bit low (as it often seems in movies with grand musical scores) but generally clear and understandable.  The music itself was well done and added to the emotion and atmosphere.  Sound effects (especially use of surround sound) was not extensive but was still effective.  I think a bit more use of surround sound (especially in the ""ice"" scene or with the flight of arrows from different directions) would have been neat, but not necessary.

I thought the picture was extremely clear and clean on an HDTV with a progressive scan DVD player.  Some of the scenes (even when the sun is shining above) seemed a bit dark or muted (not without detail but less bright than you'd expect a sunny day to be), but I suspect that's the director's decision and not the film or video transfer.  Otherwise, I thought the picture quality was excellent.

For videophiles there is a nice extra in the Bonus Features section of the DVD.  There are some THX tools to adjust and optimize your TV (contrast, brightness, picture position, etc) so that you get the best possible picture quality for this DVD.  Not as extensive a set of tools as some of the callibration disks, but still a nice feature.  The only negative here is that a couple of the tests require a filter to view colors.  They should either include this filter in the DVD pack or omit the test entirely.

So, those are my thoughts on the DVD and why I found it surprisingly good for a few reasons.  Hope this was helpful and that you enjoy the movie if you decide to get it.",1105833600,3,3432,4.453525641025641
2145908,5,B0002YLCFQ,"THE FILM:
""King Arthur"" is a superbly-crafted historical epic. Mixing the Athurian legends with historical fact, the film, for the most part, succeeds at presenting a plausible ""truth"" behind the origins of King Arthur (mixing the acts of Ambrosius the Roman from the fifth century, the name of Artorius Castus and his Sarmatian Knights from the third century, and the battle of Badon Hill from the sixth century). The battle scenes are exciting, the acting top notch. Any fan of historical epics, and for those who want to see the possible origins of the Arthurian legend, then you won't want to miss ""King Arthur!""
THE DVD'S:
""King Arthur"" is available as either the theatrical version (fullframe format), and as the ""Unrated Director's Cut"" (2.35 Widescreen format). The extended version features some great new footage (A conversation between young Arthur and Palagius, a conversation between Lancelot and Guenivere) that should have been left in to begin with. It is also more graphic than the theatrical version, which makes the film feel more realistic.
Both DVD's come with some great extras, and are presented with fantastic picture and sound. Whether you are getting the theatrical version or the director's cut, prepare for a great movie experience! Movie/DVD Grade: A+",1105747200,5,1280,5.188405797101449

2145910,3,B0002YLCFQ,"Many different stories and movies have been done about King Arthur, but all of them have represented a medieval knight fighting against saxons and other barbarians invading England. When we think about King Arthur, we imagine somebody like the one represented in ""Excalibur"", living in the 13th or 14th centuries. But the truth is that the saxons, frisians and celts invaded Britannia in the early 5th century, after the last troops of Rome leaved the island. So, in a general view, this movie is much more historical and real than all King Arthur's versions related before. The investigation about the origins of Arthur and his cavalry, the clothes and weapons used, and some names like the bishop Germanius (wich historically was send to Britannia by the general Aetius about 450 DC), contribute to the historical accuracy that this movie was seeking.

Other details, however, are absolutely wrong, like for example the role given to the Pope in Rome (in this time, the Emperor Valentinian III was much more important), or the general situation in Britannia in the year 450 DC (the last roman troops probably leaved the island about 406 DC).

Once we have taken notice of this, the truth is that the script is not so good, even bad in many ocasions. The scriptwriters say that they spent 5 years working in the dialogues, but in general they are too simple, and became weak (even incoherent) in many ocassions. Only the quite good interpretations of some of the actors save this problem. The music is fine, signed by Hans Zimmer from Gladiator, but it becames more an obstacle than a help in some moments of the film (for example, when Arthur is talking alone with Germanius next to the round table: this is a no music scene).

No explanation is given to the origin of Excalibur, wich apparently is a sword like any other (read the novel ""The Last Legion"" of V.M.Manfredi for an interesting theory about this), and relationships between some characters are simple and unconcluded, probably due to some cuts in the original script that are not solved even in the extended version.

In conclusion, the problem seems to be that all effort has been spent in the general story and the special effects (specially in battles). The reconstruction of the Hadrian's Wall is quite remarkable, too. But the film will decepcionate to those searching for the real story of King Arthur, and to those wich only wish to see a good movie with some battles. This King Arthur's version is a good attemp to solve many historical lies about him, but probably the intention was bigger than the ability, and the result is another comercial film. Probably, we'll have to wait further versions wich will improve this first attempting of telling the true story about Arthur.",1105747200,,2749,4.842553191489362

2145912,4,B0002YLCFQ,"I have been steeped in Arthuriana since I was nine and my dad read The Once and Future King to me.  As another riff on the Matter of Britain, I have little quarrel with this movie.

There was much in it to enjoy, Clive Owen, the director's stunning visuals and sense of place, the guy playing Bors whose name escapes me, Stellan Skargard's scary and utterly convincing Saxon badass, the battle on the ice...I could go on.

Now about the history.  I should probably know better than to cavil with Mr. Franzoni's historical underpinnings for his script.  I did once before with Gladiator. I thought, ""Sheesh, no real Roman emperor would endanger himself by getting in the arena with a real gladiator.""  Oooops.

Actually, I have no problem with the whole Sarmatian thing.  Nor do I object to the Arthur as Roman commander thing. Other authors, most notably, Rosemary Sutcliff in her wonderful book, Sword at Sunset, also place the Arthurian story in the same time period.  The premise that Arthur was a Roman or Romanized Celtic commander is not new or particularly radical.

It's the Woads (or the Picts) that make me uneasy.  They are presented as the ""native Britons,"" a kind of guerilla force striking at their Roman conquerors.  Well not exactly.  The Picts and their lands were never conquered by the Romans.  In fact, the Roman emperor Hadrian built his wall to keep the Picts from raiding into Romanized Celtic Britain.

It is a subtle but telling difference.  One thing it means is that the Picts probably would have identified themselves as Briton with the same eagerness that Koreans would identify themselves as Chinese.

The other thing it means is the Britons who probably did face and fight the Saxons at Badon Hill were the very same Romanized Celts whose tribal ancestors had been conquered by the Romans centuries earlier.  They no longer painted themselves blue and their women probably did not take part in battle as their tribal ancestors did.

And they were not happy at the withdrawal of the Roman legions from Britain.  Oh no.  Quite the contrary.  They were appalled and terrified.  They were facing the complete destruction of, for them, a very comfortable existance as part of the Roman empire.  They were, on the whole, happy with being part of the Roman empire, particularly when the alternative was being slaughtered and enslaved by hordes of Skarsgard-like Saxon badasses.

Although the Picts did fight off Saxon incursions on their own lands, I am not quite sure why they were injected into this situation.  Unless the actual Romanized Britons didn't strike Mr. Franzoni as heroic or ""freedom loving"" enough for cinematic glory.

After all, they were just your average schmoes (merchants, coppersmiths, cheesemakers, carpenters, peasants, bureaucrats, alewives, etc.) stuck in a really bad spot.  Yet they managed to find a leader and the wherewithal to turn back the tide of barbarism long enough to keep their hybrid culture from being completely eradicated.

Come to think of it, that sounds like a pretty good premise for a movie script.  Maybe someday someone will write it like that.

Finally, just one minor picky nit.  How likely is it that a Roman villa complete with soldiers and slaves existed at that time in the territory above Hadrian's wall?  But of course I thought a Roman emperor fighting a gladiator in the arena was unlikely too. Maybe Mr. Franzoni has another surprise for me.",1105660800,3,3427,4.904347826086957

I have no argument with historic recreation, and speculation. But  - and I'll try not to spoil the ending - there are some aspects of the ledgend that have nothing to do with history that they have very definitely mucked up, and I do object to that. If you're going to change it and ""put your stamp on it"" and ""give it a new twist"" - then change the name of the movie from ""King Arthur"" to something else. Because once you muck up the story, change it all around, it's not the story of King Arthur anymore, is it?

If that doesn't warn you nothing will. Now. All that aside, if I can pretend that this isn't actually the sotry of Arthur and Guenevere and Lancelot and Pelinore and all the rest, then this is a perfect movie.

The whole Roman touch... thank you for actually putting onto film what has been neglected by so many.  Historically the actual King Arthur did NOT go around in suits of chrome armor with huge jousting lances and a bevy of fair maidens.  All that would not come into history until a 1,000 years later when Briton was already unified.  The jousting knights were a long, long way off in history still when Arthur became king.

This movie tries to show how Arthur probably did come about, right at the end of the Roman occupation of Briton, when it was nothing more than unorganized tribes and warlords.  Well done!

Ok... that being said, the rest of the movie is eh... so-so at best.  We don't believe most of it (reality of the fights), and we don't buy the whole frozen lake battle scene, followed up by the Let-Em-Into-The-Castle-One-At-A-Time-While-Kill-Em scene.  Much to Hollywoodish.

Knights in shinning armor and the glory days of jousting didn't happen until the 1200-1400's and I wish Hollywood would quit trying to show King Arthur as one of those.

What we all missed on the screens of the large theaters.

Luckily for me, I received King Arthur for Christmas, and I enjoyed it so very much.

I had read David Franzoni's e-mail weeks prior about the Battle of Badon Hill.  He was full of passion for the material and the story.  As I also revered Gladiator, I read his e-mail to Amazon.com very carefully.

After I finished watching King Arthur, the music score hummed in my mind for days after like bees inside petaled roses.  I did not want to let the characters go.  I have watched both Clive Owen and Ioan Gruffudd over the years, as I adore all films and television that are from the British Isles.  It seemed to me that both played against the characters of previous films.

Although Mr. Owen's accent bothered me, it made up in his stature , height, and acting.  Mr. Gruffudd was passionate as usual, as he is in his other work.  I loved the stillness of Hugh Dancy's Galahad.  Mr. Dancy learned the stillness and love of the camera from Mr. Hooper in Daniel Deronda. Mr. Dancy's soft voice and keen eyes add a true beauty to his character.  Why is this actor not getting Orlando Bloom's roles?

I highly recommend this unrated version to all of those who loved Braveheart.  Arthur captures you, ensnares you, the way that Braveheart did.  Give yourself to the action, the characters, the beauty of Ireland.  For once, film lovers can bask in the rare idea of a film being in and of itself, glorious.

2145966,4,B0002YLCFQ,"This darker , grittier look at the Arthurian legend is inspired by recent findings that there was a real Arthur- or rather a series of Kings named Arthur who were responsible for the early unification of Britain after the ROmans left. Written by the creator of Gladiator, directed in stunning scope by Antoine Fuqua and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer- this is a different twist on the legend and it works.

Merlin is depicted as leader of the picts- the mysterious primitive warriors who roamed the woods and refused to be haltered by the yoke of Roman Christianity.  Gueneviere is a pict warrior woman who Arthur rescues from the hands of a Roman who is keeping her prisoner in the name of his god.

The battle here is as much about the struggle between the old pagan ways and the new path of following the papist God and how these beliefs clash with self-determination and the desire of men to live free.

Arthur and his knights form a reluctant union with the picts for a glorious battle scene with the Saxons. Stellan Skarsgaard as the Saxon leader is as frightening on the battlefield as any bad guy I have seen in any film. Clive Owen is a courageous, smart, honorable man fighting to find his path and destiny. Lancelot is his trusty partner in arms and still pagan.

The principles we all know and love about the honor and valor of the knights of the round table are here- but what we see is not a world of magic, but a world of dark betrayals, brutality and the struggle for freedom in dark ages of history.

I missed the theatrical release and this unrated director's cut is great. I paid to see Troy and it's greatest redeeming feature was that you see Brad Pitt naked many times- Arthur has depth and story. Touchstone should have released this in December for all of us sad that the Lord of the Rings trilogy is done.

2145967,3,B0002YLCFQ,"I watched this movie over the weekend and, although it brings a new and interesting perspective to the Arthurian legend, I found myself uninspired and unimpressed by the effort.  From the opening scenes of the movie, the viewer cannot help but be reminded of ""Braveheart"", with its portrayals of the harsh, primitive life of Britain during the dark ages.  ""King Arthur"" attempts to recreate the same panoramic, epic feel as Mel Gibson's hit movie, but aside from the foggy countryside and a somewhat gritty view of life, there's really very little resemblance between the two films.

On the plus side, I enjoyed getting a new take on the same old story.  No Camelot or holy grail in this version.  Yes, the round table makes it's appearance in a few scenes, but not with the same grand pomp and heraldry that we have become accustomed to seeing.  Arthur (played by Clive Owen) is the commander of a dwindling group of Sarmatian knights who trace their lineage back several generations to the survivors of a battle against the Roman army.  The Sarmatians' lives were spared in return for their, and their sons', oath of service to Rome.  This group of knights, including familiar names like Lancelot, Galahad and Gawain, are the latest generation to fulfill their duties under this oath.

Arthur and his men are not pictured initially as the classic group of noble warriors, but as a rough-and-tumble band who are counting down the days until the end of their 15-year service requirement.  On the day before their discharge, however, they receive orders for one last mission -- to rescue the family of a Roman nobleman from the wrong side of Hadrian's Wall, just as a large Saxon army is invading from that direction.

During this mission, Arthur finds his loyalties divided between his oath to Rome and the drive of his heart to help all men realize and live out their God-given liberty.  In particular, he is asked to assume leadership of the savage Wold nation, now led by Merlin, in their defense against the coming Saxon invasion.  He also meets Gwenyvere, a rather tough and saucy Wold warrior maiden, not at all what the viewer would expect from the usual legends.

Ultimately Arthur gains freedom for himself and his surviving knights, but he feels compelled to live for ""a higher purpose"" rather than for himself.  Thus his character is essentially modelled on Mel Gibson's William Wallace, as he leads the battle for liberation.  The general tenor of the story is one of heroism, sacrifice and nobility of spirit.

Now for the negatives.  I thought the story was simply not very compelling, or very grand in its scale, as the entire plot revolves around only two events -- the mission beyond the wall, and a single battle to repel the Saxon invasion (the latter being most unrealistic).  Although the movie has the obligatory happy ending, I thought the story cut off rather abruptly.  Also, there was a little too much emotional sap in a number of the scenes for my taste, especially during Arthur's motivational speeches.  In these scenes, Clive Owen hams it up and frankly makes these scenes seem a bit corny.  The combat scenes were generally well done, with some blood but generally toned down violence -- i.e. no serious carnage as in ""Braveheart"".  While this makes the movie a little more kid-friendly, it steals away much of the sense of realism from an otherwise semi-believable story.

Overall, this isn't a particularly bad movie but it certainly failed in its attempt to be a great movie.  It's worth watching once, I suppose, but once was enough for me.",1105315200,3,3576,4.822950819672132

Fuqua has added yet another diappointment to his repetoire after the sizzling Training Day (in retrospect looking more and more like it was Denzel fueled rather than the director's own talent) with this mess. There is no real exceitement here. Arthur has all the emoting abilties of a piece of driftwood and the knights are all your average bawdy badasses who you could care less whether they live or die.

2145969,2,B0002YLCFQ,"What's to like about this drab retelling of the Arthurian legend?  The filming is uninspired, owing a large debt to the techniques Ridley Scott used to much better dramatic effect in Gladiator.  The plot is as skimpy as the outfit Keira Knightley wears for the final showdown between Arthur's knights and the Saxons.  Knightley's eye candy Guenivere provides one of the few bright spots in a film that is otherwise difficult to watch.  Arthur and most of his knights seem grossly miscast, and Clive Owen simply cannot carry off the role as this larger than life hero.  Stellan Skarsgard pulls off a moderately good performance as the leader of the Saxons, but inexplicably speaks with a distinctly American accent.

I rented the director's cut, which presumably represents the artist's vision of the final movie.  This film is exemplary of why studios often make dramatic changes to a director's work.  The film is grossly overlong, somehow deluding itself into believeing that a long run-time somehow equates to an epic film event--and the film's almost nonexistent plot seems only to serve as a device to get the combatants to their next battle sequence.

Thoroughly uninspired, this film does little to expound upon the mystery of the Arthurian legend as its opening titles promise.  Instead, it winds up being a loosely confederated group of battle sequences, which, while occasionally eye-catching, are often gruesome and gratuitous, and usually fail to advance the story, which is what this film is most in need of.  All in all, a huge waste of time for a person who does not have time to waste.  Very disappointing.",1105315200,3,1622,4.988847583643123
2145970,5,B0002YLCFQ,"SPOILERS BELOW!

I've commented on this movie before: the cinematic PG-13 version. This is what I wrote in Auagust 2004:

Saw it twice. Liked it even better the second time around. I know a lot of folks had their problems with it, especially those who wanted either a rehash of exisiting 'Arthur' tales, or alternatively expected a 'historically accurate' account.

Get a life, people. It's a MOVIE. A STORY. And it's well-told, with the mystical mumbo-jumbo removed and the French soap opera elements rinsed away, so that just the names are recognizable. Despite that-and that's one of the things I really liked about it-the movie managed to retain the flair of (demythologized) 'legend'. It was an uabashed story about a hero, and there's nothing wrong with that.

Another nice tweak: Arthur making the transition from trying to serve a 'higher purpose' to humanization, when he realizes that the 'higher purpose' is probably well and truly corrupted, and that if any purpose in life is to be found it lies in the service of one's people. A good and noble soldier's creed. The stuff indeed, of heroic legend, well told, and with a kick-ass cast.

---- Now, finally, I got the DVD, so here goes... ----

There's been a lot of complaining about the de-mythologizing of the legend. Mostly that means the removal of the French soap-opera component and the pretense that anybody really believes in magical swords, witches and spirits living in lakes. Is that a loss? I suppose it depends on who's talking. A review in the Guardian (complete with the inevitable political anti-American end-commentary) moans that 'Britain's national myth has suffered its own catastrophe' and that KA is 'one of the worst historical, or history-esque, films ever made'. Complaints also abound about its historical inaccuracies, and Keira Knightley's battle dress continues to draw major vitriol. Well, if you look at the latest research by people like John Matthews and Linda Malcor you may find that the inaccuracies may not be and that Keira, like her male comrades, should have been fighting in the buff, their bodies painted head-to-toe. That would have been a sight, would it not?

Of course, there's an argument for 'preserving' legends, and I think KA did that well. It just twisted it into a different direction. The DVD also contains an alternate, darker ending, without the PG-13 feel-good wedding. This had been Fuqua's choice, but apparently the money-men walked over him and Bruckheimer and what was intended to be an R-rated movie became a PG-13 nice-kiddy flick in the editing room: sanitized and dumbed down.

Fuqua's commentary is very revealing and shows up not only his disenchantment with studio politics, but also reveals his personal philosophy, which I've always liked, ever since listening to him comment on Tears of the Sun. Above all, he makes the interesting observation (one I happen to completely agree with) that, in particular, the adultery soap-opera element in the traditional  versions of the legend actually makes no sense. It may be perfectly in line with what we expect from daily TV soap fare and Reality TV, but between comrades-in-arms there is a kind of ethics that folks living within the comfortable and boring confines of refined civilization may well find incomprehensible.

To those who wish to advance the virtues of the 'noble' and 'clean' traditional versions: it occurs to me that the very _ignoble_ soap-operatic characters, whose 'courtly' nobility appears to be more one of declaration and general pomposity, can only cower in shame before the much less sophisticated but honest nobility of the Arthur and knights depicted in this movie. Surely, if we look for heros of the Campbellian kind, this is where we find them, not in the classical bedroom dramas centering around the betrayal of Arthur by Guinevere and Lancelo, or people's  obsession with that ultimate of social taboos, incest.

Watching KA again after listening to Fuqua's commentary gives the movie additional depth and reveals dimensions one might easily have missed before. All in all a worthy and important addition to the cinema release version. So many things I initially missed suddenly became clear, such the obvious parallels to such classics as 'Seven Samurai' and 'Magnificent Seven', and the even closer kinship between this movie and 'Tears of the Sun', another classic Campbellian hero tale.

Another nice touch (I keep discovering things about this movie!) was pointed out to me by a lady who truly loves horses. When the knights, together with the Roman garrison and a bunch of refugees, leave Hadrian's Wall and the Saxon drums of war start rolling, the horses bolt, prompting the knights to reflect on their decisions to leave. I thought it was a good scene, but it becomes even better when we remember that, as we're told early on in the movie, slain warriors return as horses. So it wasn't just that the knights had a sudden and not easily understood change of heart: it was their horses, the souls of the dead warriors, that reminded them who they were, and who refused to continue avoiding their destiny-albeit a destiny which, as Arthur reminded his knights later, they chose as free men, rather than indentured soldiers for the Romans.

2145971,3,B0002YLCFQ,"This film tries so hard to bring a sort of historical ""accuracy"" to the legend of King Arthur that it loses much of the wonder, excitement, and romance of Arthurian Legend.  No, I was not expecting a Mists of Avalon fantasy, but I also was not expecting this violent tour of the Dark Ages.  Now, I've never seen the the PG-13 version so I don't know if the violence was toned down (I expect it would have had to been less to get a PG-13), but the violence in this film is a bit much at times and with the blue-painted Celts it was like a British version of Braveheart.  At one point there is even a big speech reminiscent of Mel Gibson's freedom speech in Braveheart.  If Clive Owen had uttered ""For Freedom!"" I would not have been surprised.  The major positive of this film are the actors. Clive Owen, Ioan Gruffudd, and Keira Knightley are good considering the material they are forced to recite.  Ioan Gruffudd, in particular, was very good.  I look forward to seeing him in the Fantastic Four.  Overall, this film suffers from trying to remove the fantastical elements that have allowed the legend of King to endure for more than a 1,000 years.  Give me Excalibur, John Boorman's classic retelling, any day.",1105228800,,1212,4.522935779816514
2145972,2,B0002YLCFQ,"I love stories about the round table and Camelot. If you do too, don't rent or waste 20 bucks on this movie because it will ruin your fantasy. I could care less whether there is truth behind the legend of King Arthur or not, just don't ruin my fun! And I'm telling you--King Arthur was not fun!

First of all, it took me some time to figure out who everybody was, much less try to get absorbed into it. It was slow, and the plot reeked of a remake of Braveheart. It lacks some originality. Keira Knightly's acting could've been a duplicate of ""Pirates,"" and I wasn't overly impressed with anyone else. It lacked character and common sense. An audience wants to want to stomp the bad guys with them, to root for them, to feel their pain--Well, all I felt was a headache.

 Yea! for fight scenes, because that's the only reason I gave this movie 2 stars at all. Not an impressive ending, you get the typical. I was like, that's it? Fight, fight, fight, you die and you die, kill the big bad man; mourn, get married. Some characters don't even seem to serve a purpose.

Like someone else said, the hype wasn't all it was cracked up to be. Don't believe me? If you want to see for yourself, save your $$ and borrow it from a pal that got it for Christmas.",1105142400,,1251,4.265822784810126
2145973,4,B0002YLCFQ,"I have to admit that I did not know what to expect from the film, but as it turns out it is a very pleasant and entertaining movie.

King Arthur, brings to the screen not the traditional version, but an alternative tale of the legendary king of Camelot, Lady Guinevere, Sir Lancelot and the likes.

In this version, Arthur and his knights are Sarmatian mercenaries from southern Russia brought to Britannia and bound by a contract to serve out time in defence of the Roman Empire's Northwestern borders.

Times are changing; the Empire is under pressure from advancing barbarians and is forced to abandon its farthermost provinces and outposts and focus on the defence of Italia and Rome itself.  As the Romans prepare to leave, the Saxons invade and the native Britons are faced with a new threat/enemy.  Moreover, the Empire finds itself in the midst of the transformation from the old traditional Greco-Roman religion to the new Christian one.

Overall, the acting is above average, the special effects are excellent, and the plot is definitely original.

The clash between Christendom and druidic paganism is as fascinating as the internal conflicts within the early Christian Church, and both presented very well in the film.

The scene in the chapel/dungeon and battle on the lake are breathtaking to say the least.

On the negative side the lead actor, Clive Owen, carries himself too much like Nicholas Cage (his voice-his appearance) as if that is who he is thinking of when reciting his lines.

Moreover, it becomes rather tiring and annoying with the repetitive ""freedom"" theme, especially with the otherwise ""barbarian"" Guinevere (!!!) delivering modern-style lectures to Arthur.

The setting, the special effects, the music and the costumes are all wonderful!

Forts, Battles, and Swordfights are all about.

In short, though not a masterpiece, it is a movie worth watching!",1105142400,3,1887,5.087662337662338
2145974,3,B0002YLCFQ,"I admit, there are some things about this movie that were blown out of proportion a little bit but it's still better then Van Helsing damnit and even better then Troy. I really didn't care for Troy that much and I frickin' hated Van Helsing to the bowels of hell. Clive Owen (The Bourne Identity, Gosford Park, Croupier) plays King Arthur, this makes up for Beyond Borders with him and Angelina Jolie. Kiera Knightley (Pirates OF The Caribbean, Love Actually, Bend IT Like Beckham) plays Lady Guinevere. Knightley plays the same performance in dialouge like she did in CAribbean. Ipan Grussford played Lancelot did it to the max and I was pissed when they killed him off. Til Schwiger (Driven, The Replacement Killers) played a Saxon (bald head guy with the little braided goutee).At first I thought that was Moby but no, my wrong. Everytime he spoke it sounded like he was talking chinese and I was glad Lancelot killed his monkey ass. Stellan Saarsgaard (The Glass House, the upcoming Excorsist: The Beginning and The Savior) plays the leader Saxon. Why did they pick Saarsgard? I mean come on. The other knights of the round table were great and I liked the part where the tall bald guy axed the ass. Kick ass scene. I still like Caribbean better. They shouold rename this Pirates Of The Camelot: The Search For Freedom and Peace. Also Merlin as a forest man in paint was a shock. I was pissed cuz they didn't say anything about Excaliber like they did in the commericial and also the scene where Merlin yells like Gandalf. The director and editor are cheap.

2145975,2,B0002YLCFQ,"Much of the hype surrounding King Arthur was regarding the historical accuracy of this movie.  Sadly,  setting aside,  this movie is on par with ""First Knight"" on terms of historical accuracy.  Further,  the movie was not all that great on its own merits.  With a weak plot that often barely strings itself along,  the action scenes are often the only redeeming element.

In regards to accuracy,  please don't confuse the lack of fantastic spells and a magic sword with historical accuracy.  The movie is decent in the drama department,  strong in the action department.  Taken for what it is,  it's an okay rental movie,  but little more.  I've been reading historical facts and theories of Arthur since elementary school,  however,  and the movie is far off base (Even though it professes ""new information,""  which is movie shorthand for ""we're making stuff up."").",1105056000,3,866,4.97887323943662
2146006,4,B0002YLCFQ,"Because of the mixed reviews this movie got, I had decided to skip it even though it stars two of my favorites, Clive Owen and Kiera Knightly.  That would have been a big mistake. When I did watch it, I found it to be quite fascinating.  To those reviewers who have gone ballistic over the historical inacuracies and religious questionability of the film, among other things, I say, ""Lighten up!""  This is a great epic movie with an interesting take on the Arthurian legend.  I like this Arthur and I liked Clive Owen in the role and I don't have to believe or be convinced that it is the one, true story (if there is such a thing) to enjoy the movie.  It has a handsome, brooding hero, noble knightly cohorts, a stunning if oddly clothed heroine (and yes, the Celts did go into battle virtually naked and smeared with paint, unlike the armour-wearing Romans or Round-Table knights), beautiful cinematography, and a great score.  The battle scenes are amazing, whether Director's cut or not, and I, for one, was glad to see almost nothing of the Lancelot-Guenivere sub-plot.  This Arthur was to me much more interesting than many of his predecesors and the gritty aspect of the knights and the fights were refreshing.  Overall, I recommend this film highly to anybody who is willing to see it as fine entertainment and not freak out over real and/or perceived historical inaccuracies.",1105056000,5,1384,4.7375
2146007,3,B0002YLCFQ,"This movie begins with a note that it is based on new archeological findings and is supposed to bring to light the ""real"" story about King Arthur and his Knights.  I don't know about the ""real"" story, but in this movie most of the knights have been decimated due to many years or fighting and now King Arthur and a handful of knights (perhaps five of them) go to battles with other armies and always emerge victorious.  That looks more like Hollywood than history.

In this movie, Guinevere is more alike Xena the warrior. She is an extremelly skilled fighter, sort of dressed in skimpy leather gear.

Merlin is not a wizard in this movie. He is a leader of Britons, who are all tatooed, and live in a way that would resemble some poor tribe in Africa.

The movie with all the fights and intrigues between the Saxons, Britons, Roman Church and the Knights is bearable to watch (though I couldn't wait for it to be over), but its allusions to real historical events are rather laughable.",1105056000,3,986,4.51685393258427
2146008,3,B0002YLCFQ,"I'll start by saying I enjoyed this movie, a lot - and it's refreshing to see a new approach to the mythical story than simply rechurning old material as others have done. If you are a fan of the excellent ""Excalibur"" or have even read Le Morte d'Arthur by Sir Thomas Mallory, then your first reaction to this movie will be ""What the ?"". That said, I have admiration for a director who dares tread unbroken ground in such a way, and tries to express that stories of old, handed down over the years were probably based on some kind of actual events initially, and this is the premise here. Clive Owen, is a little too workmanlike for my taste as the Revered Knight ""Arturious"" nee Arthur of the title, born to mixed parents, half English, Half Roman who has spent the last fifteen years of his adult life, roaming England, and fighting heathens in the name of the holy church of Rome. On the eve of his release from Religious servitude, he and his band of hardened knights are sent on a pseudo suicide mission North, to rescue a young boy who may become the next Holy Pope. During his journey, he is awakened to the corruption of the Church, a revelation that rocks the very foundation of all he has held dear all his life. He begins to see his own countrymen (formerly his enemies) as kindred spirits almost, and unites them ultimately to ward off a huge army of Saxon invaders. It's a nice idea, and a nice twist with some inventive back story along the way. Launcelot is here, Gawain, Galahad, Guinevere, and even Merlin as a mystic Celtic style witch doctor, all adding meat to the bones of the legend. The trouble is, the movie tries to encapsulate the legend of the mighty Arthur, and really only serves up a slice or two in an almost episodic retelling. The historical timing and influences of the Roman prescence in the England depicted are credible, and the battle scenes are graphic and impressive, but something always seems missing as you watch. My favorite character was the Saxon King Cerdic played with a battle weary but ruthless malevolence by Stellan Skarsgrd, who adds more than just balance to the whole picture, and will make you hiss every time he appears almost. Overall not bad, it's worth getting this unrated Directors cut however, as the additional footage makes for a better movie, and the alternate ending is the one that should have been used, instead of the schmaltzy Hollywood one shown. Very enjoyable movie that is almost believable in places, but one wonders if it would have been better as a stand alone story, instead of trying to be the Story behind the story of the legend of Arthur.",1104969600,5,2621,4.578723404255319
2146009,5,B0002YLCFQ,"King Arthur is the best film of 2004.  I love it!  It is beautiful.  The acting is fantastic.  The knights are fierce, handsome, and brave.  Gwen is over-the-top beautiful.  There is an awsome electricity between she and both Arthur and Lancelot.  I have only seen the Director's Cut, not the theatrical release.  It is excellent.  I rented Troy after I'd seen Arthur and Troy was unwatchable after the wonderful Arthur.  Of course I bought the dvd.  I even watched all of the specials that came with it and I never usually bother with those.  But this movie is so wonderful I can not give it enough praise.  The men are to die for handsome.  The cinematography is beyond compare.  The battle editing is the best I've ever seen.  I'm usually very annoyed with battle editing.  Even Mel Gibson's.  But this was pure pleasure.  I had no intention of renting it at the video store because I hadn't heard much about it and didn't know the actors, etc., but I noticed that of all the movies in the store the only one that had all copies gone (rented) except one, for me, was King Arthur!  I thought to myself ""this must be a fabulous film that just hasn't had a ton of publicity!""  And I was happy to find out that this was true.  Please try this movie.  You'll like it!",1104883200,,1265,4.404347826086957
2146010,2,B0002YLCFQ,"King Arthur opens with a statement that declares that this is based on the truth behind the legendary myths surrounding the tales of King Arthur and his knights.  This is a bold statement, in fact, it is bold enough to bring the tale to its ruin before the film has even begun, as most people consider it folklore and fairy tales.  It seems as if the purpose is to draw the audience's attention to the story with a false statement and declare it to be the truth in an attempt to falsely advertise.  Those who are educated in the matters know better, but those who do not might not.  The falsehood of the tale is upsetting, as it could very well one day serve a similar purpose for some who want to change the view of history.

Antoine Fuqua's version takes place moments before the Romans withdrew their troops from Great Britain as the Saxon's were invading from the north, and the Britons where raiding convoys.  The Britons are led by Merlin (Stephen Dillane), who is not a wizard, but a tattooed leader of the poor Britons that fights a war with Guerilla warfare.  When the Saxon's approach from the north, Merlin decides that joining forces with Arthur against the Saxons is the best solution, as Arthur (Clive Owen) and his knights are sent to rescue a couple of Roman's.

Arthur arrives to the Roman camp and he discovers that the people have been unjustly treated and in anger he responds by freeing those who have been unjustly treated in the name of God.  It is, however, extremely strange that he has never seen any unjust treatment of people prior to his visit to the Roman camp.  Consequently, the escape away from the approaching Saxons begins, which is very similar to Fuqua's Tears of the Sun (2003) where a group of Navy Seals disobey order by helping local populations from genocide.  The story continues with brave warrior's fighting for just causes, as they fight for a higher cause -- freedom.

The original tale of Sir Arthur and his knights brings the audience wisdom and valuable lessons, which would be seemingly fitting for the time when the story took place.  Nevertheless, King Arthur seems like a parody in the way the knights tackle political issues in a way only contemporary heroes do in films.  Despite the awkwardness in the film, King Arthur offers some valuable lessons in what could only be a self-righteous attempt in recreating a frequently told tale, which is displayed through the vibrant colors of Ireland and grand war scenes that only shadow Gibson's Braveheart (1995).  In the end, King Arthur offers an awkward cinematic experience with some lessons, but overall leaves the audience with a disappointing experience.",1104796800,3,2661,4.754347826086956
2146011,2,B0002YLCFQ,"What a disgrace! Being fooled into watching a movie by a trailer is one thing, but to actually watch the movie is entirely different!

I was siked up to see this film, as I'm a great fan of the legend and love Keira Knightly as an actress. But this film was unbelievably crap!

The acting had completly gone to the dogs! The line said to Ioan Gruffurd by Kiera on the frozen Ice scene was pathetic. All you need to know was it was totally un nessacery! The armour Clive own wore and all his men wore, looked like they'd been to Hades to get it and Keira's ensemble looked like, it had been, very disasterously  shredded!(She wears it in the battle scene)

The love scene between her and owen looked like a heavy burden on both and so unrealistic! Lack of emtion was shown, or even an attempt of on screen chemistry for the audience! They were supposed to have been falling, in love with each other, but they showed no signs of this one bit. Then bam! Out of Nowhere she's in his room!...Totally stupid!

The setting was far to gloomy and the historical plot totally wrong! Why would the saxons bother attacking by Hadrians wall???

The script didn't give the actors anything to work with and didn't stay true to the hearts and minds of the characters. The whole love triangle between, Arthur, Lancalot and Guenievere was cut out, which is the backbone for the story!

I believe that there was to much sarcasim and dumb ideas about Arthur and his followers. His men at one stage appeared like drunk, womanisers and Kiera was quite, rediculouly funny as a follower of a tribe, lead by merlin (Who may I add is also a very important character, turned from a great sorcerer,into a shaggy warrior)-Kiera meanwhile,covered in war paint and as skinny as a stick, still managing to hold a sword?

This is very disapointing and had such a slow entrance to it, I didn't think it would ever pick up! Kiera must have appeared atleast an hour into it and to be honest, the battle scenes weren't that good either. Although people say this is best part!

Nearly everyone dies and then a short few minutes of Guenievere and Arthur getting married, to ""Settle are spirits"" is shown at the end.

I feel very sorry for the cast of this movie, it did nothing for them at all!

I recommend you watch 'First Knight' starring Richard Gere as Lancalot, Julia Ormond as Guenievere and Sean Connery, as King Arthur. Much more period setting, delightful acting and truly better tale of King arthur!

 Do yourselfs a favour...DON'T BUY IT! But maybe rent it from your local dvd store and judge it for yourself.",1104796800,,2582,4.526881720430108
2146012,4,B0002YLCFQ,"This is a pretty long movie at almost 2 1/2 hours and it kept me entertained throughout. You cant ask much more than that...

Clive Owen was a powerful Arthur and really commanded the screen. His character always looked sure and in control. Owens acting was great as was every others in the movie. The acting was a real strong point of this movie and no ones lines were over dramatic or made you say 'give me a break.'

The battle scenes and environments in the movie were great too. The snow scenes were especially beautiful and well shot.

But there were a few things that made this a 4, and not a 5 star movie. The first was that this movie tried to be a serious epic like Lord of the Rings or Gladiator and it was not. King Arthur was much more of a popcorn Hollywood flick and it seemed to take itself a little too seriously at some points.

Another thing was the music. The score was great but it seemed like the same song was played over and over throughout. It got annoying after a while.

And whats with the weather? Most people, including the females, were walking around in short sleeves in the snow than the next scene had more appropriate furs on. Then the next day would be sunny and green and everyone would be back to short sleeves. The weather and clothes seemed inconsistent.

All in all, these are just little nitpicks in a greatly enjoyable 'knights tale' of the always interesting King Arthur. So if you enjoy action movies, or fantasy, you should definitely pick up the extended uncut edition of this dvd.",1104624000,2,1527,4.4163701067615655
2146013,5,B0002YLCFQ,"Here is yet another retelling of the King Arthur legend. It's not a romanticized version laced with magic. If that is what you seek then you would do best to watch the Mists of Avalon (also a thoroughly satisfying book then movie). This story is laced with gritty realism of what life may have been like back in the period of Roman occupation of Great Britain.

I have read countless retellings of the King Arthur legend. This movie probably creates a more historically accurate portrayal of the story of King Arthur and the people who surrounded him ... if he actually existed.

This story is told during the ancient history of the British Isles and their occupation by Roman forces. Arthur is the son of a Roman soldier and a British mother. He is torn by his duty to Rome as well as his duty to the occupants of Britain. He and his band of weary soldiers look forward to their release from their service to Rome after fifteen years of duty (forced upon them from childhood by Roman occupiers) but, instead of receiving their release papers, they are given one last quest. To do the final bidding of the Roman Empire is a nearly suicidal mission into the lands north of Hadrian's Wall. Those lands are primary occupied by Celtic tribes who value their freedom and fight fiercely against the Roman occupiers south of Hadrian's Wall. Told they will be ""hunted down like dogs"" if they don't go on this mission, Arthur has no choice but to go forward on the very dangerous quest.

Meanwhile, from the north, the isle is being invaded by Saxons - fierce, murderous people who plan to kill everyone they find and burn every village. Squeezed between the Romans to the south and the invading Saxons to the north, the native Celts have no choice but to attempt to forge a bond between themselves and the powerful warrior Arthur and his band of warriors (not called knights in this story). Thus begins the classic battle between good and evil, right and wrong.

Of a historical note, the women (including Guinevere) were portrayed as fierce warriors themselves - running into battle nearly naked and screaming - running into battle along with their Celtic warrior males. This was a fairly accurate portrayal of how things may have been according to historical texts. Women in ancient Celtic history were leaders and warriors along with the men of their tribes. And, yes, historically the Celts did run screaming into battle nearly naked - often their ferocity frightened away their opponents.

Finally, this is a gritty, realistic retelling of the King Arthur tale. It is a also a satisfying story of the battle between good and evil. This would likely be a great addition to your DVD library.",1104624000,22,2686,4.718550106609808
2146014,4,B0002YLCFQ,"I think had Buena Vista/Disney not rush director Antoine Fuqua to finish this movie, I think it would've been much better, perhaps even being a great movie. But no, they had to chicken out by not distributing Michael Moore's controversial ""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" rely on ""Home On the Range,"" and skip out on a cool several million bucks. Because of those actions (maybe more), Fuqua was ordered to hurry up and finish ""King Arthur"" to be released in the summer of 2004 and become botched down to a PG-13 rating, rather than the fall/winter release with the original R rating. Yep, Disney didn't have the summer blockbuster hits like the summer of 2003 had (them movies with the scurvy pirates and a lost fish), so ""King Arthur"" was their last hope. Behold, it wasn't as great in the box-office as one had expected it to be.

""King Arthur"" tells the tale of Arthur and his knights, but in a different story. No sword-in-stone fantasy, but rather a tale set centuries before the ""fantasy King Arthur"" took place. It is an era called the Dark Ages, with Romans wandering around. Arthur (played by Clive Owen) leads his small group of knights, all of whom worked for Rome. Their time comes when they will be set free from doing such dangerous deeds, only to fulfill one last duty before becoming emancipated.

A touchy subject becomes interjected minorly into the storyline: Christianity. Arthur and his knights seem to not have ""faith."" Well, just the knights, but Arthur retains a little faith. The knights are known as pagens... weird, eh? They denounce everything that deals with God and religion. And judging by the movie, it seems to say that religion in general is ""bad."" A few ""monks"" punish sinners in a sealed off section in a remote town. They basically stay down in a hole and starve those who commit, what seems to them, an act of sin. *shudders* Just think, some people are like that... and of course, the knights become the heroes by denouncing religion and saving the few survivors, including one named Guinevere (played by the beautiful Keira Knightley).

Then things heat up when an army of ""Saxon"" (some Viking/Barbarian-type group of folk with a leader that looks like Rob Zombie with blonde hair) wreak havoc and threaten Roman inhabitants. Well... don't wanna give too much away, but I'll say that the action is quite impressive. Blood and limbs fly around (in the ""Director's Cut"" version, that is), but nothing too excessive as was seen in past movies like ""Gladiator"" and ""Braveheart.""

All the while as I watched this, I knew Antoine Fuqua would've made the film much better than what he has hastily presented here. It feels rushed and underdeveloped. We don't really get to know the ""other"" King Arthur in this movie. The storyline somewhat resembles ""Braveheart"" (fighting for freedom). Some of the acting is cringe-worthy.

But nonetheless, ""King Arthur"" is a pure Hollywood movie. It does what it's supposed to do: entertain. I was well entertained. I mean, it has such impressive action scenes, CGI or not. Plenty of times where you'll go ""Oh!"" or ""Ugh!"" And notice I said only ""some of the acting is cringe-worthy."" I said ""some."" Clive Owen plays a brilliant Arthur. I can't imagine anyone else playing that role. Keira Knightley as always is brilliant. It's amazing what she was able to do in the action scenes. As for the other actors whose names I cannot remember: all did fine jobs, despite overacting (that includes our two main protagonists).

For all you scholars and historical buffs, skip this movie and/or spare us your excessive knowledge of who King Arthur might have been. This movie is pure entertainment and although doesn't give us the 411 on who King Arthur was, it provides us an option to delve deeper into this legend's background by looking at some books or watching a special on the Discovery Channel. Or if you flat-out despise the Roman knight King Arthur, stick with Disney's ""The Sword in the Stone.""

As mentioned before, ""King Arthur"" isn't great, but it's good entertainment. It gets my thumbs up.",1104624000,2,4050,4.827089337175792
2146015,5,B0002YLCFQ,"Five Big Stars!! I really enjoyed this somewhat different, epic tale of 'Knights of Old(er)'. These are older, bolder Roman Knights doing their deeds in the Dark Ages on the British frontier, not the merry 'younger' England of in-bred kings and queens. Don't get wrapped up in historical accuracy, there isn't any Arthurian history by which we can make a judgement. This is a wonderfully made, superbly acted action adventure that goes in a different direction than Camelot. And it 'goes' into my private DVD collection of 'movies to see again and again'.

Producer Bruckheimer and Director Fuqua conjure up a whale of a fantastically enjoyable tale that has familiar Arthurian characters popping up in unfamiliar places doing heroic things of consequence.  Arthur is a Roman Knight, who is pressed into an urgent mission before returning to defend a threatened Rome. The movie is a fast-paced thriller with some remarkable battle scenes and one encounter in the snow and ice that has to be seen to be believed and it will slow your breathing.

 Clive Owen's Arthur is invigorarting and engrossing. The usual Arthur is a King with all of the trappings. Not so here, Arthur is a frontier knight without so much as an aide to help him and Owen captures the 'lone wolf' moralistic aspects of this character superbly. He's absolutely spellbinding. Stellan Skarsgard, with long hair, is a terrific bad guy closing in on the Knights and generally pillaging and plundering everything in sight. And this Lancelot, played by the wonderful Ioan Gruffudd, is a brooding double-sworded knight of action and loyalty.

Keira Knightley, however, as Guinevere, almost steals the entire movie. She makes an unusual dramatic entrance and manages to hold the camera in her every scene along the way. No mean feat for an 18 year old (that's right, 18) with one previous major role under her belt. She is probably the major action female of 2004 aceing out the likes of Uma Thurman of ""Kill Bill2"", Maggie Cheung and Zhang Ziyi of ""Hero"", all of whom were aided by 'wire-fu' and scene-cutting trickery. Most of the stunts in ""King Arthur"" were done by the actors themselves, including some dicey swordplay and tricky horse maneuvers. BTW, the horses in this movie are fabulous. In particular, the scene where Owen (on a horse) and Skarsgard (on the ground) are having a pre-battle 'chat'. Yikes, what a  fantastic horse! A great action and adventure movie. Pop some popcorn, eat some Tropical Dots and Enjoy. Highly Recommended. Five AUDACIOUS Stars! (Touchstone Pictures, Rated PG-13. Color. HD. CC. Time-2:05.)
( Afterthoughts: Don't miss the ""roundtable discussion with the production crew"" in the Extras section.
Also, contrary to some thoughts, ""King Arthur"" was a financial success. Director Fugua scored his first $200 million dollar movie success and Bruckheimer continues his string of boxoffice winners. While US sales were tepid ($52M), the international boxoffice was $150 Million alone, giving it profits of $40 to $80 Million. This is prior to Rentals, DVD sales, and the endless profits of HBO-like channels, network debuts, and revolving, eternal cable channel showings.  Wow, all of this and no cursing, nudity, or severed body parts flying around the scenery (in this PG-13 version at least. The Director's Cut is gruesome).  Lots of blood and death, though! )",1104537600,4,3357,5.0798548094373865
2146036,2,B0002YLCFQ,"This radical re-imagining of the Camelot/Arthur/Launcelot/Guinevere story is bound to leave most viewers mystified and shaking their heads.  This film doesn't work on any level; it begins and ends as a bloody hack-and-stab fest, and the middle consists of yet more violence.  The ""unrated"" version just adds an extra ten minutes of gratuitous and unedifying hacking and stabbing, as Rasputin-like characters refuse to succumb to butchery that would kill any ordinary person.

I write because what little plot there is involves a famous theological dispute between two Christian thinkers of the late 4th and early 5th centuries, Pelagius and Augustine.  Augustine (354-430 A.D.) believed that as a result of Adam's Fall, human nature is hopelessly enslaved to sin, and we are incapable of making right decisions except through the grace of God.  Pelagius (354-418 A.D.), a British theologian, believed that although countless generations of sin had weakened the human character, each person is still essentially free to make right choices, and can live without sinning by the right exercise of the will.  The controversy has been a perennial one within Christianity, with the church generally being closer to Augustine than to Pelagius.  (Although it should be noted that most Protestants reject the extreme form of Augustine's doctrine of ""original sin,"" which holds that not only are we born sinful, i.e., prone to sin, but we are born into guilt, thus necessating the rite of infant baptism.)

In the movie, Pelagius was Arthur's mentor in Christianity (which is plausible, since Pelagius was a Celtic monk who spent most of his career in Britain).  But, ridiculously, the movie changes the spiritual views of Pelagius and Augustine into political views.  Pelagius as seen as some sort of champion of political freedom and self-determination, while the other view is seen as promoting serfdom and slavery.  The anti-Pelagian Christians have built a special dungeon in which to imprison their political?/religious? opponents.  Of course, this is just silly.  The debate between Pelagius and Augustine had nothing to do with politics or social organization.  I suppose nothing better could be expected from such a stupid low-brow movie, but then why even mention the name Pelagius, never mind make it so prominent in the movie?

What is worse, the movie seems to be a broadside attack on Christianity:  The pagan knights are honorable and self-sacrificing, whereas the villain of the piece is a Roman bishop.",1104537600,2,2508,5.279596977329975
2146037,1,B0002YLCFQ,"This is a pitiful attempt to bring the historical King Arthur to the screen; I confess to not having seen the original version of the movie, but the ""extended unrated version"" doesn't inspire me with any confidence that it has anything of any value to offer to those seeking a new version of the Arthurian story, historical fact, or even entertainment.  The script is inane, Keira Knightley, though very beautiful, is absurdly miscast as Guinevere, and Clive Owen is positively wooden as Arthur.  The supporting cast is occasionally very good, particularly Ray Winstone's Bors, but Cerdic and Cynric as the father-son villainous team are too obviously inspired by Vito and Santino Corleone to inspire anything other than guffaws of laughter.  Their villainous behaviour-stopping a rape only to have the woman murdered, casually knifing a henchman in the gut in frustration-are clumsy.  I don't mind over-the-top performances; I'm very fond of ""Conan the Barbarian;"" this isn't just over-the-top-it's incompetent directing, poor writing, and indifferent actor commitment.

The fight sequences would have been exhilarating, if only the characters had been compelling.  But they're not.  They're neither convincing as human beings, nor in the least bit interesting.  In particular, the ice fight is visually stunning.  But it doesn't make sense.  Why would you walk down the centre of a frozen lake, where the ice is thinner and you're further away from safety?  And why is Keira Knightley wearing next to nothing when there's snow falling?  Well, apart from the obvious reasons.

So much for the movie.  The packaging proclaims that this is ""The Untold True Story That Inspired the Legend.""  That's a logical fallacy, of course-if it was untold in the fifth century, how can it have come to light now?  But is it a plausible piece of historical fiction?  The answer, unfortunately, is No.

I don't want to be accused of being an encyclopedia freak or anything like that; but equally, I don't think that knowing something about history and legend should disqualify a person from holding and defending an opinion about a work of art that purports to be historically accurate.

The screenwriter and director of this movie have attempted a snow-job on the movie-going public.  They profess to tell the ""true story"" of King Arthur, and that is simply not what they do.  And it doesn't matter how many times Keira Knightley says in interviews ""This is historically accurate.""  It isn't.  I don't mind movies that are historically inaccurate.  But movies that are marketed on one assumption and then deliver something else is simply a lie.  And that's what this film is--a lie.

The rest of my comments address the more serious historical blunders of David Franzoni and Atoine Fuqua.  If you're not interested in the historical background, son't read any further.

The film's prologue states that ""Historians agree that the classical 15th century tale of King Arthur and his knights rose from a real hero who lived a thousand years earlier in a period called the Dark Ages.  Recently discovered archaeological evidence sheds light on his true identity.""  Of course, anyone baldly stating that ""historians agree"" on anything from the results of Agincourt to the colour of an orange obviously doesn't know historians.  They disagree wildly about whether there ever was any original of King Arthur.  David Dumville, for example, claims there was not; Leslie Alcock (an archaeologist, not historian) is an agnostic; Geoffrey Ashe has argued in favour of an historical Arthur, but changed his identification in the 1980s; many historians don't care.  And the legend of King Arthur is not 15th century.  The earliest legendary accounts (as opposed to historical accounts) of Arthur date to perhaps the ninth century, perhaps the tenth.  Sir Thomas Malory wrote his highly influential book Le Morte d'Arthur in the fifteenth century, of course-but that's not what the moviemakers say.

The movie seems to be based on a book by Linda Malcor and Scott Littleton called From Scythia to Camelot, in which it is argued that the legends were inspired by Lucius Artorius Castus, a commander of Sarmatian auxiliary cavalry stationed on Hadrian's Wall in the third century.  This is possible-some Sarmatian legends do show a similarity to, for example, the story of the Grail.  But the legend of these cavalry auxiliaries bears very little resemblance to the story of Arthur, so screenwriter David Franzoni took the Sarmatian Cavalry idea and transported it anachronistically into the fifth century.  Unfortunately, it doesn't fit there.

The film is set in the year 452, and in one scene Bishop Germanus talks about the imminent withdrawal of Roman troops from Britain.  The Romans withdrew from Britain in 410.  It is possible, perhaps, as a number of historians have suggested, that native British soldiers stayed behind and organized a defence against the incursions of the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes from Germany, the Picts from Scotland and the Scotti from Ireland.  But after 410, neither of the emperors nor the Pope had any right or ability to recall these legions, if there were any.  The highly-organized Roman system we see in the film is therefore hugely anachronistic, especially the garrison on the Wall itself, which, as the northernmost extreme of the Empire, was the first part to be abandoned.

The barbarian raids, incidentally, were hardly the full-scale and well-organized (and financed, according to one line in the movie) invasion imagined in the movie.  They began (according to tradition) in 449, were brought to a full but temporary halt in about 500 (perhaps by Arthur at the battle of Badon Hill), then resumed throughout the latter part of the sixth century until the Britons had been driven back into Cornwall, Wales, Cumbria, and Brittany.  The idea that the Saxons were thoroughly and decisively trounced once is absurd, especially since the movie's time scheme suggests that all the events depicted occurred within a few weeks.  That's the kind of telescoping of historical events that Shakespeare indulged in, to great artistic achievement, but that's not what the moviemakers promised with this film.  They promised the ""true story.""

Some of the characters are historical-Pelagius and Germanus, for example.  Lancelot could never have been a real person-he was invented by a Swiss poet called Ulrich von Zatzikhoven in the late twelfth century.  Gawain's name, of course, is anachronistic-his name in the earliest Arthurian stories is Gwalchmei.  Similarly for Guinevere, whose earliest recorded name is Gwenhwyfar.  That Galahad should be a historical character is ridiculous-he was invented by an anonymous author in the early thirteenth century specifically as a knight on a quest for the Holy Grail.  Merlin may have been a real historical character, a bard of the sixth century (not fifth, and not contemporary with Arthur) whose name, in reality, would have been Myrddin.  it was changed to Merlin by Geoffrey of Monmouth in about 1138 to avoid the unpleasant associations with the French word merde.  So half the characters don't belong in the particular historical milieu that the moviemakers tried to portray.

Then there are things that are just uncomfortable.  All the harping on freedom, for example-a concept that was meaningless in most pre-American Revolution societies.  They had, instead, an idea of the rightness of one's role in life-to them, freedom didn't mean living without the dominion of overlord, or voting rights, or whatever the screenwriter meant.  Freedom in the Dark and Middle Ages meant living one's proper and assigned role in life.  When the characters speak of freedom in this movie, they just look like their costumes don't fit properly.

All of this would be forgivable if the film was self-proclaimed as a fantasy, or if it were not incompetently directed, written and, in many cases, acted.  Unfortunately, it is garbage from the opening moment to the closing.  The movie absorbed two hours of my life, that I'd really very much like to get back and do something useful with.

Incidentally, the narration at the beginning and the end of the movie is by Lancelot.  How?  He dies at the end.  Or is it perhaps just a wannabe Lancelot, like the wannabe-director Antoine Fuqua and the wannabe-scriptwriter?  This is absolutely the worst Arthurian film I've ever seen; and I've seen ""Sword of the Valiant.""",1104451200,27,8452,5.145894428152492
2146038,4,B0002YLCFQ,"I still enjoyed watching this movie. King Arthur is generally considered a legend, but all legends have some basis in fact. This version has just as much legitimacy as any other. Thought it was an interesting concept. Mixing fact and fiction is always a tricky bit of business, and I thought they did well in this film. Not an Oscar candidate but still worth watching.

The battle scenes were very good, the scenery of Ireland, of course, has no compare, and I didn't find many things that were not believable. All in all, I thought this was a good film, and will watch it again.",1104451200,2,579,4.514285714285714
2146039,3,B0002YLCFQ,"MOVIE: A film that could have been a lot more interesting if the approach was better.  Here we have the true story of King Arthur who fought for Rome and Britian, a man who wanted nothing more than freedom for his men.  Sound familiar?  It should, because the whole freedom thing has been done too many times, but that's not what makes this potential epic a dud.  Also this claims to be thr true untold story of King Arthur, when in reality the historical accuracy is rather poor.  The movie doesn't go into detail about what the heck is going on during these such as Braveheart did. I found the acting and the set design to hurt this movie the most.  The battle scenes were incredible in my opinion, and I thought they were well done.  The ice scene is nice, and the ending battle through the smoke was incredible, but it was the acting and the sets that hurt the movie the most.  Clive Owen and Kiera Nightley did fine jobs, but the rest of the cast was horrible.  The acting was so stiff and wooden, it just felt too tense.  I found myself wanting the actors to stop trying to act and just let it flow, but that didn't happen.  Then comes the set design, everything looked so fake and that brought down the effect.  The armour looked like plastic, and some of the costumes looked like something out of a high school play.  Even the wall that was built to keep the woads and saxons out looked cheaply done.  The colors on some of the costumes were way too bright, and that was in contrast to the dreary, foggy, green landscape of the location.  By having these bright shiny knights riding through the foggy green fields it makes the costumes and landscape look fake.  Everything had the look of something brand new and not gritty, rusty, or blood soaked.  Otherwise this movie could have been amazing, but now it's just enjoyable.  If Hans Zimmer didn't compose the score I probably would have not found this movie so exciting, but his thrilling score is what makes it enjoyable.

VIDEO: The unrated disc comes in a 2.35:1 widescreen transfer and it is decent.  The colors come out nicely even though that is the downside of the movie.  But the snow scenes are a visual feast for HDTV owners.

AUDIO:  The Dolby 5.1 mix is clear and crisp but rather weak in my opinion.  Nothing exceptional except for the ice battle and the smoke battle at the end.

PACKAGING / EXTRAS:  The single unrated disc comes in an armary case with snap latches on the side identical to many Universal releases (We get rid of WB snapper cases, now we get these, ugh).  The case also has a cardboard slipcase, which has no purpose whatsoever except to attract attention of the consumer as they wander through the DVD aisles of their local stores. This unrated edition has 13 minutes of added footage, which basically makes the battle scenes more violent. The extras are pretty basic.  You get a 17 minute making of featurette, and I was happy to see that they gave Hans Zimmer a little screen time in discussing the score, unlike in Tears of the Sun, where he got none.  Then there is a 15 minute discussion that includes Bruckheimer, Fuqua, Owen, Knightley, and some other actors.  I thought it was pretty good, but it also seemed like fluff.  There is an alternate ending that was cut due it not being recieved with open arms from test screenings.  For XBOX owners you have a playable demo of the King Arthur game, and to top it off there is a feature that pops up fun facts of the production as you watch the movie.  Pretty basic, but better than most discs.",1104364800,2,3538,4.461059190031152
2146040,3,B0002YLCFQ,"Ok, I'll avoid, for the most part, the historical debate and try to just focus on the movie first...

My main problem with the film was that a lot of the characters didn't feel very developed.  Yes, they were quite good at conveying the emotions surrounding being indentured for years, ready for freedom, and then having that freedom snapped away.  Brilliant even.  But when there was no brooding on their freedom, something was just missing.  It's one of those situations where the actors either nail the characters dead on, or they don't.  Although truthfully, I cannot blame the actors entirely, as the script was pretty mediocre.

The action was the saving grace of this film.  The action scenes were realistic, well-paced and in the case of the ice-floe fight, quite creative.  Sadly, when there was no fighting, things dragged just a bit.  Again, script issues.

Many things were eliminated from the ""legends"".  No love triangle, no Merlin hurling spells, no plate armour or a Lady of the Lake with a magical sword, and no part fey villianess striving to have her son get the throne.  Truthfully, I didn't really miss it.  I would have liked to have seen the Merlin character fleshed out a bit more, but that's about all I can complain about in terms of the legend.  The beef is the script; we got a small piece of what could have been a month in the life of Arthur, but I got to the end of the film and said ""so what?""  I just didn't care about what happened in the film.

There just wasn't enough meat to the film, and that's the problem.  True, it killed a couple of hours, and isn't terrible, but there was enough missing where I was disappointed.",1104364800,,1657,4.559322033898305
2146041,2,B0002YLCFQ,"There are some directors who have made gritty, visceral films about modern times like Martin Scorsese who can also travel to the past and produce something noteworthy. But then there are some like ""King Arthur"" helmer Antoine Fuqua who should stick to their turf. His ""realistic"" re-telling of the King Arthur myth is a jumbled, dragging mess that features some stunning cinematography and atmospheric music but never feels focused or intense. If we are to believe this movie, then Arthur and his knights emerged from Samaria during the Roman era and served the empire as a sort of ancient wild bunch. The screenplay by David Franzoni (one of the writers on the superior ""Gladiator"") tries to give us a myth, human story, history lesson and action adventure all rolled into one. Which isn't bad, it's the way the movie is executed that sucks. Fuqua made his name with gritty crime pictures like ""The Replacement Killers"" and the superb ""Training Day"" which showed great promise. Here Fuqua suffers from bad scripting and lack of passion. The movie has some wonderful images and rich photography, the use of mountains, green fields and snow creates mood and sometimes you're tempted to forgive the movie because it LOOKS so good. But eventually it feels too long and empty because the characters are not fleshed-out, the story is simplistic as well as the dialogue (which makes ""Alexander"" sound like a classic work of theater) and the story doesn't have a lot of meat. We like what we are seeing in terms of visuals and colors, but we don't care much for anything that's actually happening with these people. Hans Zimmer should be commended for doing a good job with the movie's score with has a touch of ancient European lore in it's etheral vocals and moody strings. But even the music doesn't help a movie that just feels cold, you almost get the sense Fuqua wasn't having fun making this film. Indeed, the original theatrical version was a PG-13 cut that was reportedly argued by Fuqua who wanted an R version and here gets his wish with the DVD release of the ""Director's Cut."" Anyone expecting an improvement won't find it. The movie essentially feels the same, all that is added is more blood and a few more slices and kicks during action sequences which is meaningless because more blood and gore doesn't exactly advance what is a weak storyline. ""King Arthur"" chugs along trying to tell the ""real story"" behind a legend that feels more entertaining in movies like ""Excalibur"" and the masterful TV miniseries ""Merlin."" Fuqua is a gifted director who knows how to make movies, but this is not his best area of expertise and it's a shame his next movie, an epic crime drama titled ""American Gangster"" has been cancelled. Skip the original cut, skip the Director's Cut, even the most feverent fans of Dead Can Dance won't like this film.",1104278400,,2842,4.802040816326531

Sometimes the difference between those and the theatrical versions is simply one of taste and judgment.  Here it is the difference between a poor movie and a good one.  The added film and different cutting is transforming.  While a large fan of the Arthur legend and tales of knights and daring, I was disappointed to the point of boredom with the theatrical version.  With the Director's Cut, I frankly lost track of the time and was absorded through to the end.  This is not a great movie but it is very much a good one.  The acting is quite acceptable, the story line has an interesting twist and the cinematography and music are quite well done.  The action scenes are most impressive, especially given they were largely done without CGI.  The costumes and battle gear are equally impressive and contribute to the overall visual impact.  Yes it has some historical and logical flaws that are most evident in the hacked up editing of the theatrical version.  In the Director's Cut, they are easily overlooked in the much improved flow of the character interaction and the scene transistions.

2146043,4,B0002YLCFQ,"First off, despite what the box says, this is not the ""true"" story behind the Arthurian legends.  All that the best medieval scholars really know is that someone named Arturius led the Britons to victory against the Saxons at the battle of Baden Hill sometime around 450 A.D.  They have no way of knowing whether this person in fact bears any resemblance to the King Arthur of legend, or whether any of the other characters (Lancelot, Genevere, etc,) ever really existed.

Marketing gimmics aside, this is quite an enjoyable movie.  The fight scenes were well choregraphed, and they're much better in the unrated version.  The performances were all very good, and the story kept me interested.  I may be mistaken, but I believe this is the first time the ancient Picts of Scottland were ever potrayed in a film.

Another reson to see it is Keira Knightly.  She's so insanely beautiful,  I could probably watch her read from a phonebook for two hours without losing interest.

2146066,5,B0002YLCFQ,"Forget the Arthurian legends you have grown up with, just take them and put them aside, along with all your clean and proper kingly court ideas, and get ready for an epic medieval battle film that will leave you breathless from its stunningly flamboyant proportions.

Following a myth of different origins, this tale of King Arthur tells of a Briton who serves the Roman Empire's army for 15 years, something that they were required to do while under Roman control for God and Country.  Arthur, or Artorius Castus, (played expertly by Clive Owen) and his six Knights have carved a name for themselves in the Roman armies, a legend of being an unbeaten force.

At the end of their 15 years of service, they are summoned by Bishop Germanius (played by talented Ivano Marescotti) to receive their freedom from service.  But the Bishop tells them they are not to be freed until performing one last task for Rome, freeing a loyal Roman family from invasion by the Saxon's to the north, in particular, the son of the family, Alecto.

Arthur and his six Knights, Gawain, Lancelot, Tristin, Galahad, Bors, and Dagonet set off for the north, grumbling at Rome's betrayal.  They must travel through the lands that the Woads occupy, strange barbaric foes led by a wise man named Merlin.  Once past the Woads, Arthur finds the Roman family taking the power of their God and Country and using it to create serfs and slaves, torturing those who they deem heretics.  One of the heretics Arthur frees from the prisons is Guinevere, a Woad.

With the Roman family unwilling to go submissively with them, and Saxon drums beating on their heels, the seven Knights flee into the mountains in a desperate attempt to fulfill their last obligation to the empire and gain their freedom.

Does this movie follow any Arthurian legend?  Not remotely.  Does this movie have any historical value?  None whatsoever.  Is this a good movie?  Yes, indeed!  Put down those history books and King Arthur fantasies and get ready for a stunningly filmed epic, a medieval battle movie far superior to any of the bad ""Arthur"" movies (except Excalibur).  This is a medieval fantasy, and a very grand one at that.  The photography is spectacular, the acting is superior to many of the ""bigger names"".  The dialogue is interesting, funny, and intriguing, capturing a closer bond to the feelings of the Knights of their time with the humped up society of today.

These are not the shiny Knights of Boorman's `Excalibur', but a rough and dirty bunch, still keeping nobility about them and Honor above all else.  Special mention goes to Ray Winstone, who plays Bors, Joel Edgerton who plays Gawain, Ioan Gruffuddand who plays Lancelot, and Keira Knightly who plays Guinevere, along with Clive Owen, who I can see as the next Mel Gibson.  Owen fits the part to a Tee, and Knightly plays Guinevere the way she should have been played, both soft and tough.  Knightly was good in Pirates Of The Caribbean, but she is great as Guinevere.

Still, the real attraction to this movie is the striking photography of the battles.  Take particular notice of the fight on the ice, the way the arrows fly through the air, and tip your hat to the costume designer for some spectacular outfits and gear that truly bring this epic to life.  This movie is pure eye candy for those who love a good medieval fight, tossed with realistic characters and a touch of romance.

My only negative thought would be that it needed a little more blood, but since King Arthur was headed towards the PG-13 crowd like LOTR, some decapitation scenes didn't occur that I thought may have enhanced the battles.

2146071,4,B0002YLCFQ,"To really enjoy this movie, you have move beyond the obvious.

Within in the first 10 mins, I was disappointed. The chronology is a joke. And the set up of the major characters is laughable.

Since when are Arthur and Lancelot the same age? And the 15yrs later thing would make Arthur around 25, 27 at the very most (given the approx age of the kid in the beginning). Clive Owen is young looking for his age (I guess), but c'mon.!!! And didn't Romans require 20-25 years of service?

Needless to say, as a retelling of the Arthurian myth, this movie is substandard.

This has nothing to do with Arthur as Roman. It's about trying to mesh that early 5th century myth with the Medieval French details. ""Lancelot"", ""Dagonet"", etc...Those names just scream medieval French.

Guinevere's character came across as an after-thought and frankly, could have been left out completely. Especially given Knightley's lack of chemistry with the two male leads.

HOWEVER....

If you look at this movie as telling a story of men caught between honor, duty, loyalty, friendship and the longing to be ""free"" and finding their place, this is a great movie.

Others have described the main performances as wooden and lacking

emotion. But given that these are men who have spent 15+ years killing other men up close and personal, as their duty - Men taken from their homes as children and taught to kill - How much emotion can we expect?

I saw this lack of emotion as men who had grown used to distancing themselves from the world around them. And who had become just plain tired of the killing (obvious in their longing to be free).

Clive Owen played this brilliantly. Every so often there's a glimpse of the turmoil beneath and we watch as he struggles to bring it under control.

Watch the actors and their faces. It is the subtleties of their

performances that provide the passion and make this movie. Moreover, even these ""good guys"" aren't so black and white. And that makes them all the more believable.

2146072,3,B0002YLCFQ,"""King Arthur"" is the first film to attempt to place the legend of King Arthur in its proper historical timeframe. Although King Arthur's legend gained popularity in the late Middle Ages, it refers to the exploits of an unknown warrior-king in Britain of late antiquity. In ""King Arthur"", screenwriter David Franzoni makes Arthur out to be a Roman-Briton Commander of a group of Sarmatian knights who act as a sort of special forces unit to protect Roman interests in 5th century Britain. As the Roman Empire plans to pull out of Britain, leaving the native population and invading Saxons to fight it out, the visiting Bishop Germanius (Ivano Marescotti) gives Arthur (Clive Owen) a final order. He and his 6 knights are to escort a Roman family to safety whose estate is in the path of the Saxon General Cerdic's (Stellan Skarsgard) ruthless advance. The Woads (normally called Picts), a Celtic people whose relentless attacks have Rome on the run, share Arthur's disdain for the Saxons. So politics makes strange bedfellows, then as it does now.

Contrary to the film's hype, ""King Arthur"" isn't attempting to be historically accurate. Although it is generally accepted that the source of Arthurian legend was a king and/or military leader of late antiquity, the identity of this person is hotly disputed. To my knowledge, there are 3 major schools of thought on the subject and some minor ones. King Arthur is thought to have been either: Lucius Artorius Castus, a 2nd century Roman stationed at Hadrian's wall who commanded a group of Sarmatian cavalry, as King Arthur does in this movie. Or, Ambrosius Aurelianus, who led the pivotal defeat of the Saxons at Badon Hill circa 500 A.D., as Arthur does here. Or, Riothamus, a 5th century British king. King Arthur is an amalgamated legend, in the way that the legends of Robin Hood or Black Beard started with one person and were amended with the exploits of others as the centuries passed. The fact that Sarmatians were cavalry and their tradition of being buried with their swords at the head of the grave leads one to believe that these warriors were, indeed, the inspiration for much of the mythology surrounding knights of the realm. The legendary King Arthur won 12 battles, including the Battle of Badon Hill, as Ambrosius Aurelianus did. These 2 men, who lived 3 centuries apart, are both Arthur. But the story, itself, that is presented in ""King Arthur"" is fiction.

As for the movie, ""King Arthur"" may be the murkiest film I have ever seen. Many scenes take place at night., but those in daylight aren't much brighter. I might have wondered how it is possible to make a snowscape dark, if I had not learned from the bonus features that it was done with CGI. It's unfortunate that so much detail is hidden in shadow, but it does create an oppressive effect. Britain looks very cold and very dark in every frame. The blue body dye that the Picts traditionally donned in battle is one of those little pieces of history that just begs to be filmed. But it would have had more visual impact had the lighting been more realistic. The Picts actually didn't wear clothes with their paint, and why they are called ""Woads"" in this film is a mystery to me.

""King Arthur""'s performances are fine but unremarkable. The knights are probably the most interesting characters, but they are usually in the periphery. Acclaimed character actor Ray Winstone entertains with a nice over-the-top performance of Bors, the loudest knight. Some fine European actors were corralled for foreign roles, but they are given little to do. The fabulous Stellan Skarsgard is the Saxon General Cerdic. I've always thought that Skarsgard could make any character believable, and maybe he does as much with Cerdic's few lines as is possible. Somehow he gives the man weight by whispering all the time. But Cerdic still comes across as a one-dimensional villain -although a scary one.

There is a lot of very modern talk of ""freedom"". As is common in period pieces, these are conspicuously contemporary characters in an ancient drama. So ""King Arthur"" is not intended to be a historical document. Its grittiness and modern ideals turn the shiny Arthurian legend on its end and attempt to create an interpretation of the myth that strikes a chord in the 21st century. I don't think it succeeds in that. The script just isn't very good, the characters poorly drawn, their actions incomprehensible, the situations implausible, and the whole thing is drab and overprocessed. But ""King Arthur"" is an  action film, even if it isn't anything more, and I enjoyed it at that level.

The DVD: Bonus features include a making-of documentary, a roundtable discussion with cast and crew, an alternate ending, an optional trivia track while viewing the film, a photo gallery, and an audio commentary by director Antoine Fuqua. In ""Blood on the Land: Forging King Arthur"" (18 minutes) the cast, principle crew, director Antoine Fuqua, and a historical consultant comment on the origins of the King Arthur legend, the film's characters, and the sets. ""Cast & Filmmaker Roundtable"" (16 minutes) is a discussion of Arthurian legend, the movie, and filming by screenwriter David Fanzoni, Keira Knightley, Clive Owen, director Antoine Fuqua, producer Jerry Bruckheimer, Ioan Gruffudd (Lancelot), and Hugh Dancy (Galahad). The ""Alternate Ending: Badon Hill"" (4 minutes) puts a slightly different philosophical spin on the death of the knights in battle. It's too contrived, even for a fairy tale. Skip it. ""Knight Vision"" allows you to enable an optional track of subtitles that provide production and historical trivia during the movie. The ""Producer's Photo Gallery"" includes color and black-and-white stills. If you insert th DVD into your XBox, you can view a ""King Arthur XBox Game Demo"".

Could this be how the Arthurian Legend started, one never knows.  Don't listen to all the critics about how bad this is.  Just view it for what it is - entertainment,does anyone really care if the type of weapons or armor is correct. In the Adv. of Robin Hood w/Errol Flynn does anyone really believe they ran around in the forest and castles w/all the colorful costumes - not - but it still is my all time favorite movie.

 Clive Owen does a outstanding job as Arthur and I'm glad they didn't have the famous love triangle going on w/Lancelot.

2146091,4,B0002YLCFQ,"The latest retelling of the ""King Arthur"" legend directed by Antoine Fuqua is the first major film production that puts Arthur into his appropriate time-frame and costume. The 1981 film ""Excalibur"" has the Arthurian knights in 14th Century plate armor. The wardrobe people for ""Excalibur"" only missed by 1,000 years. But the knights in ""Excalibur"" looked really neat. What is a thousand years among average movie goers? If Arthur existed at all, he likely ruled shortly after the Romans left the British Isles in the 5th century A.D. In ""King Arthur"" the characters are dressed in costumes and armament that closely resemble those in use during this period. Some accommodation must be given to the swords and bows the characters use in this film. The weakness in the historical context is yet another filmmaker's addiction to Eastern ""martial arts"" weapons and fighting style.

Another accolade for the filmmaker-""King Arthur"" does not attempt the chew up and swallow the whole Arthurian legend in a 90 minute movie. Short flashbacks are used to present the ""sword in the stone"" and other Arthurian myths. The film's main story-line encompasses a period of a few weeks and not Arthur's lifetime. The earliest reference to King Arthur is a recounting of the Battle of Mount Badon by the Welch monk Gildas about 550 A.D. If you want to see this battle, you will have to go to the alternative ending of ""King Arthur.""

There are no dragons or omnipotent wizards in ""King Arthur."" Be prepared for a radically unique Guinevere well acted by Keira Knightley. Merlin's wizardry is only briefly mentioned as this character is portrayed (Ioan Gruffudd) as a leader of the peoples north of Hadrian's Wall.  Lancelot is a minor character and narrator. The legendary love affair between he and Guinevere is not broached in this film.

Be prepared for several brutal combat scenes. Combat was gory when you bludgeoned or hacked your opponent to death at close range. The special effects are very good and the film shows excellent scenes of how Roman forts might have existed along Hadrian's Wall.

2146092,4,B0002YLCFQ,"I just finished watching the Director's Cut, (did not see the movie in the theater), and if you are looking for a break from reality for 2+ hours, you could watch this movie (or any of thousands available).  Some people complain that it doesn't follow history, or is not factually based etc....honestly, I don't often get all that hung up on whether a movie is fact-based or not.  That is not why I watch 99% of the movies I watch.  I watch a movie to be entertained -- to take a short break from reality.  This was a suitable break from reality.  Sure, some parts here and there were slow, and we can all say we've seen certain aspects of this film in others -- but it's very rare to find a film today that doesn't ""copy"" aspects of past movies, isn't it?

I've seen many of the ""King Arthur"" movies and read many of the stories -- at least this one was ""different"".  Some people did not like the changes (strange how they complain about lack of originality, and then also complain that the story was told ""wrong""), I had no problem with it.  I did not mind missing out on the ""love-triangle"", and I found this telling an interesting change of pace.  I also liked that though the female was ""rescued"" she wasn't a helpless damsel, and was quite capable of taking care of herself.  More female roles should be like that. (and this is from a guy's perspective)

If you are looking for more of the same old fairy tale, or are expecting to have a history lesson based on fact, or expecting amazing dialogue, then perhaps you would be disappointed in this movie, and should find something else -- but if you're looking to be entertained by something a little different then perhaps you'll enjoy this movie.

2146094,3,B0002YLCFQ,"I wince whenever I see a film described as a ""TRUE"" story, especially when it involves the existence of 'King Arthur' and his knights, over 1500 years ago. While there are a wealth of theories that 'Arthur' was, as the film implies, a Roman military commander who remained after the legions departed, equally 'valid' claims can be made that he was a Welsh, Scot, or Briton chieftain, a Celtic warlord, or, most likely, an amalgamation of several powerful early warrior/generals, combined by French troubadours of the 11th - 13th centuries into a single 'King of England' to promote the concept of Chivalry, and thus link together a collection of popular heroic ballads. As the characters of Guinevere, Lancelot, and a majority of the famed knights and deeds of Arturian folklore were inventions of this later period, the only 'fact' that can be proved is that Britain, after the Romans departed, was a bloody battleground between Britons and the swarming Saxons, as well as Vikings, Picts, and other tribes from the north and across the English Channel.

Within this 'battleground' concept, ""King Arthur"" still might have worked...except that the director insisted on using the 'classic' names for the story's characters, with Guinevere portrayed as a Celtic girl with a habit of fighting nearly naked, Merlin as a Celt chieftain with engineering talents equal to the Romans, and Lancelot, Tristan, Gawain, Galahad, and the other 'Knights of the Round Table' portrayed as Eastern European 'indentured soldiers' of Rome. With the possible exceptions of long-time folk heroes Merlin and Tristan (whose legendary doomed love of Isolde was, likely, an inspiration for the tragedy of Arthur, Guinevere, and Lancelot), not even the NAMES were in common usage prior the the eleventh century!

Dropping the 'Names' and 'Is it True, or is it Bruckheimer?' complaints, there are some good points to the film; Ireland, substituting for England, has a raw beauty in keeping with the time period; Stellan Skarsgrd (complete with an American accent!) plays the Saxon 'king' with a bloodthirsty
yet stoic quality that certainly captures your attention; the battle scenes (in the Director's Cut) are brutal and believable; and the conflict on the ice (with a resolution familiar to anyone who has seen the Russian classic, ""Aleksandr Nevsky"") provides a tension often lacking through much of the rest of the film.

As for the leads...Clive Owen makes a strong, sincere Arthur (although, by the sixth century, even the Romans had taken up wearing beards; being beardless was seen, mostly, in clerics); Ioan Gruffudd, as Lancelot, does his best with a role that begins promisingly, as a 'Devil's Advocate' advisor to Arthur, then fades into little more than a series of complaints and knowing 'looks' (without the legendary dalliance with the Queen, I guess the writers ran out of ideas); Keira Knightley (Guinevere), at 18, is developing into quite an actress, showing great enthusiasm in action sequences, and great promise in her romantic scenes with Owen. Ultimately, Ray Winstone, as the surly but likable Sir Bors, steals the film, providing most of the humor, and spirit, on screen.

I know that many will find my criticism of ""King Arthur"" far too picky, but if you love a medieval battlefield epic, ""Braveheart"" is still the movie to see...and if you love Chivalry, and the King Arthur of lore, buy ""Excalibur"", and cherish the legends!

Sadly, ""King Arthur"" is a pale shadow of both!",1103846400,,3475,5.110915492957746

This version of the King Arthur myth reaches into archaeological discoveries and historical theories about the nature of King Arthur. The recepie for this film takes in several ingredients:
(1) Experts concede that if Arthur lived, he would likely have been a military leader.
(2)Writings from Roman invaders in Britan described the fierceness of Celtic/Pictish warriors who would paint themselves blue, go naked into battle and run toward their enemies with a war cry to shake the sky.  Add to that the increasing awareness that women probably fought alongside the men and you have a pretty good base for a story.
(3)The writers of this film took all of this, managed to liken King Arthur and his knights to an ancient Special Forces team, and added in the very contemporary ""girls kicking [...]"" mentality of popular entertainment in the mold of Buffy and Sydney Bristow from ""Alias"".

Director Antoine Fuqua (""Training Day"", ""Tears of the Sun"") has restudied the King Arthur and the Knights of the Roundtable legend and found the origins in 5th Century Rome vs Briton occupation. The result is less a visit to the Camelot of Arthur, Lancelot and Guinevere of the 15th Century than it is a heyday for the violence that conquering Rome imposed on the 'colonies' of its empire.

Given the odd transplant, Fuqua has created a film that is over two hours long and is basically a series of seemingly endless fighting on the bloody battlefields of Briton.  The settings are dark yet magnificent (Ireland at its greenest) and the film is carried by the strong performances of Clive Owen as Arthur, Ioan Gruffudd (please change that name!) as Lancelot, Keira Knightly as Guinevere, Stellan Skarsgard as Cerdic the evil Saxon, and the famous Knights as played by Joel Edgerton, Hugh Dancy, Ray Winstone, Ray Stevenson, and Mads Mikkelson (though trying to identify  any of these actors under all the hair and grime is a task!).

So it is a battle film and for that genre it is very fine - a good  popcorn movie for the cold nights ahead.  The featurettes on the DVD are not too additive, but the 'alternative ending' shows that Fuqua could have had a tighter film had that been chosen over the sappy one in the released version.

2146100,2,B0002YLCFQ,"""King Arthur is a bit of history. It's what we all grew up with,"" says its 38-year-old director, Antoine Fuqua.

History it is Not!  If you watch the film from a historical prospective you will be disappointed.  The movie King Arthur is more akin to that feature in the comics,"" What's wrong with this picture,"" than it is to history.

In a creative move to shift away from the mystical legend, Arthur was moved ahead about 400 years in history to a time when there were no knights and Britons were under onslaught from the Saxons.

Historically, only a couple of things were right.  Saint Germanius did visit Britain and Saxons disrupted his visit.  Time tables locations and settings in the film were all wrong.

In fact, it has been said of Britain:  ""It was highly valued, badly threatened, and strongly defended."" Roman forces in the area of Britain were numbered at fifty thousand during the fourth century.  The collapse of the Roman government occurred in the early fifth century.  The breakdown of Roman law and civilization was fairly swift after the Roman army departed in 410 AD.

The Hadrian Wall was but 15 feet tall, not the Great wall of China transplant protrayed in the film, it had watch towers that rose another six feet and the Romans did build forts along the wall.  These forts were abandoned in 383 A.D.

To counter attacks from Vikings, Scots, and Picts, the first Germanic warband arrived in Britain in the mid fifth century to serve as mercenary troops at the invitation of the British sub-Roman government. When the government failed in their agreement to supply them, these troops revolted. This revolt touched a significant part of the country.

Then, the first settlers invited their relatives from overseas to join them. The new Anglo Saxon invaders were not organized centrally.  They slowly colonised northwards and westwards, pushing the native Celts to the fringes of Britain.

 At the beginning of the sixth century, the Germanic peoples spread through the country was checked for a time by the British, but by the mid sixth century they started to expand again., and began to colonize, pushing the Celts into the areas of Cornwall, Wales and Scotland.

The Britain invasion by the Great Army didn't occur until 865 AD and was a Viking force.  It made wide territorial gains, and by 875 the kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria had succumbed. Only Wessex remained as Anglo Saxon.

The Britain of the film King Arthur is portrayed as desolute and impoverished.  As Saint Germanius described: ""He speaks of it as a land of wealth. There is treasure; there are flocks and herds; food is abundant; institutions, civil and religious, function; the country is prosperous, but at war.""

Religion played little role in the post Roman conflict.  The first waves of Christianity in Britain were brought to the Island by Irish monks in the fourth and fifth century.  Celtic Christianity was different from Roman Christianity.  A centralized church in England didn't occur until 850 AD.  In Rome, the first Bishop who could be called a Pope wasn't until Leo (440-461AD)

Sarmatia, where the ""knights"" originated was not ""Rus,""  but a ancient district between the Vistula River and the Caspian Sea, populated not by Russians, but by Indo-Iraqi Caucasians.  Skilled horsemen, They came into conflict with the Romans but later allied themselves with Rome, acting as buffers against the Germans. They were scattered or assimilated with the Germans by the 3d cent. A.D.

The Rus were Viking settlements in Eastern Europe established by traders.  No Viking kingdom was founded with the sword in that area.

And knights didn't even exist. The earliest meaning of knight, or more accurately cniht, in English is servant or boy.  Indeed, most early knights were not much more than hired ""boys"" who offered military service and loyalty to whatever well-to-do nobleman or warlord that offered the most promise of money or war booty.

In the chaos and danger of post-Roman Western Europe, the population had very little organized governmental protection from brigands and conquering warbands. Knowing there was safety in numbers, local lords (who could afford it) gathered around them young, fighting-age men to fend off rebellious vassals or conquering neighbors. These men, in turn, were rewarded with war booty for their service and loyalty. Soon, grants of land were made so the young soldiers could receive an income from those lands and afford the high cost of outfitting themselves with the accoutrements of war, such as horses, armor, and weapons. The era of the medieval knight had begun.

This trend was reinforced by the appearance in the 8th century of the stirrup, which made mounted men much more powerful and turned cavalry into the most important element of medieval armies.

I won't even trouble you with the problems with the Arthur ledgend.

This movie is a grade ""b"" plot with a blockbuster budget.  It would be even more camp if it didn't have the special battle effects.  It's a film that is suitable for a six pack and a lot of sarcastic comments. The only thing missing was Waldo hidden in the background of a scene.

The vehicle doesn't work, unless you can suspend disbelief.  It's a shame they had to link it to the Arthur legend.  It might have been a good story if the characters had been given a clean slate. This should have been a story about th cnihts, not the knights of the roundtable.",1103760000,5,5431,4.8960612691466086

Most Arthurian Legends come from the faerytales of Camelot written in the Middle Ages, by an author who dressed the knights and ladies according to that period.

As there are only three written references to Arthur, and all were made over a century after he lived, and none of which mention the ROMANS, I fail to see how believes that this film, a piece of pure fantasy, sets the record straight. The English (who he disdains) could never claim Arthur as their own, as the Angles (origin of the name English) were, together with the Saxons, the enemy. The first reference to Arthur merely describes him as a ""War Leader"" (never a King), and the second mentions that Arthur joined with the Christians to fight the Saxons at Baden Hill-the whereabouts of which has never been established. In passing, the third reference merely states that Arthur died at the battle of Camran, location also unknown. I also fail to understand Mr Harrison's assertion on how a Roman general who fought in northern Britain against the Saxons could have been praised in 1066 by French peasants as their protector.

At any rate, I couldn't find much point in this reworking of the Arthurian legend into a down-and-dirty, almost squalor-laden thing. Was it aimed at having some redeeming feature, that would in the end redeem the legend while giving it a supposedly more realistic biting edge along the way? Well, I failed to find any such redemption. What started out as a pointless debunking of romance remained noting more or less that that for me. Nor was it the kind or irreverent spoof of the story like Monty Python would have made. Without going either for laughs or ultimate redemption, it seems more like what BAD SANTA would have been if developed as drama rather than comedy. I don't think there would be any positive purpose to such a serious dragging of the Santa Claus legend through the mud. And this film finds similarly little purpose for such a take on the legend of King Arthur. And if the intent was realism, what is with some of the scenery?

2146125,5,B0002YLCFQ,"I had wanted to see this movie in the movie theater last summer, but never quite made it. Having watched the extended directors cut last night I am kicking myself for not making it to the local multiplex to catch this grand scale epic on the big screen.

I really cannot understand all the negative press this movie has received. Historical evidence (as presented in a quite excellent History channel documentary recently) proves that King Arthur was most likely a Roman general who did band together with the native Britons in fighting off the invading Saxons.

The traditional story that Hollywood has brainwashed the movie-going public into believing is total drivel. Arthur was not a figure of the middle ages, he was not an Anglo-Saxon and there was no magical sword in the stone. For years I have felt disdain for the manner in which the English have claimed King Arthur as their own - here at last is a movie that goes some way to setting the record straight. One really should not forget that the warriors from Brittany who sailed with Norman the Conqueror sang and celebrated King Arthur as their hero, someone who had fought to protect the Britons from the invading Saxon hordes.

Another criticism leveled at this movie is the presentation of Guinevere as a warrior woman. However this is also historically accurate as explained by actress Keira Knightley in both the ""Making of..."" documentary  and the roundtable discussion (included as part of this impressive DVD set). Women often were quite capable warriors and it was not until about five centuries later that they faded into historical obscurity. Was it not after all a Briton warrior queen who caused Rome so much concern in the earlier centuries of the first millennium?

What we have here is a thoroughly entertaining, informative and dramatic recounting of the inspiration for the Arthur legend. Arthur himself is a half Briton, half Roman who takes command of a group of Samatian (sp?) cavalrymen guarding Hadrians Wall (historical evidence also points to this being an accurate account). With news of an invasion to the north by the Saxons Arthur and his men are sent to retrieve a Roman family and transport them back to safety. What follows is an epic struggle to survive and a growing awareness by Arthur as to his Briton heritage.

I really enjoyed this movie and I also think the DVD is exceptionally well done. The highlight of the special features in my opinion is the roundtable discussion which includes the major actors as well as the writer, director and producer. They discuss the historical accuracy of the movie as well as the challenges in bringing it to the screen. There is also a (rather fluffy) making of documentary, an audio commentary and a (rather lame) trivia track. Overall though this movie is an impressive achievement.

NOTE TO MR. GEORGE: Most of the evidence quoted comes from the aforementioned History Channel documentary on King Arthur as well as material covered in the DVD for which this is a review.  I am also at a loss to understand where your assertion that I have a disdain for the English comes from - since I am part English myself.",1103673600,207,3148,4.816666666666666
2146126,5,B0002YLCFQ,"For action fans this is a very well done movie under the direction of Antoine Fuqua.  Nothing is missed and the stunts are great!  The time period in which this movie takes place is not a ""Disney"", fantasy, make believe, magical time.  The period is one of the darkest in European history where plague wiped out entire cities and towns so the subject matter is hearty, believable and robust quite in keeping with the times.  A declining Roman empire streached to the limits and Britania and the area(s) to the west often ruled by cruel, merciless kings and tyrants.  The story is a difficult one to tell given the dire times of that age and I believe that Jerry Breckenhiemer and Antoine Fuqua took license here but so do our so called historians and archeologists in the telling of this tale.  This is not your grandmother's ""Excalibur"" which allthough entertaining and amusing, just is not reality.  Arthur is driven by demons and events from his past like men today are, no big deal because we all are just human and so was Lancelot and Geneviere.  The actors kept you involved without too much made up legend about who they were or could have been and the action was fantastic and gory at the same time.  After all, war is not a picnic but men, women and children die sometimes horrible and needless deaths for no better reason than they are there at the time.

Enjoy ""King Arthur"" for what it was meant for a good tale of betrayal, regret, greed, love, mercy and conquest, which is an old tale that has been happening since the dawn of time.  Oh, and by the way Merlin was not a magician who pulled rabbits out of a hat, if he also existed just as Arthur and the others during this very dark and troubled time in history then he was either a pagan or a christian just like everyone else.

Two hours and fifteen minutes of ""Gladiator"" style action and adventure!",1103673600,3,1866,4.488165680473373
2146127,3,B0002YLCFQ,"King Arthur and his knights of the Round table are some of the most legendary figures in, well Legends.  But were they real?  Did Arthur really become King of Britain with knights, was there a Round table, did Excalibur exist as did Guenivere and Merlin?  This movie says that they did but not in the way we all remember.

The story here is that Arthur is a Roman Knight who is defending Britain from the Celts.  His knights consist of only five men, most from a country to the East.  The knights have never been defeated in battle and their 15 years of serving the Roman Empire are almost up.  However Rome wants them to complete a nearly suicidal task in going into the Northern Britain (where the Celts rule) and rescuing this rich Roman Family before they are killed.  Arthur and his men have no choice but to obey or be labled deserters and face death.  They leave for this quest and in the process witness the atrocities that the Romans can do as well as face a new threat of the Spartans.

This movie is supposed to be a Historical retelling of the legend but many aspects that most people know of are not even touched or ignored all together, such as the Love Triangle between Arthur, Gueinver, and Lancalot.  Also the battle sequences, while good, end up copying from other movies such as Braveheart and the Patriot.  In the end though this is an entertaining movie, and is worth checking out.

2146128,5,B0002YLCFQ,"After reading all of these negative reviews I have to say this movie suprised me how good it actually was.  I disagree with one of the reviewers below saying there needed to be comic relief to ease the tension of this movie's theme.  I hate comic relief when it is only there to relieve tension, that is what upset me most about the LOTR films.  We can handle serious themes and situations without a silly cheap laugh thrown in so we won't feel so depressed.  I loved this movie because it was serious, and man does this director's cut have some good battles.  The look of the movie was very cold, dark and brutle.  Finally a movie that does not throw in forced comedy skits and sunny day happy moments just to make you feel good, let's stick to realism folks.  The time in which this movie was dipicted were hard unhappy times, thanks Mr. Fuqua for keeping it real. Although the ending ended up being one of those near-cheesy moments of happily ever after.  I prefer more the alternate ending that you can see in the extras.

  I like to see happy films and comedy's as much as the next person, I just don't like it forced at the expense of the audience's intelligence.  This movie was very well done and very well executed, most of all highly underrated.  I don't care if this movie doesn't dipict Arthur's tale in the way that most of us expected or read. This is a movie, entertainment, it is not a history lesson.  The producers of this movie tell you it is based on a true story, we and they know it is not. There was a true King Arthur but most if not all records of his existance are embellished into the land of myth.  I tell you this even though this movie is fiction it would definatly be closer to fact than the actual Arthur tale of magic and wizards. Fact as being the actual situations that revolved around a future king at that time.  I wen't into this wanting to be entertained with a serious movie based in the older days. I received that and much more.  If you go into this movie in the right state of mind you will not be dissapointed.  And the battle at Baden Hill is worth the purchase alone.

I kept thinking there is something missing, perhaps a better movie lurks underneath.  A little long, but still it does have some moments.  It is beautifully filmed.  The locations are spectacular, and you get to know more about the other knights.  Quite frankly they were more interesting than Arthur.  Takes itself way to serious and has no comic relief to ease the tension.  Maybe there will be a director's cut one day and I can see what was missing.

I knew going into it that I would hate it. I hated watching it and now I am hating reviewing it. With that said, the movie could have been a lot worse - anyone remember the Richard Gere ""First Knight"" horror movie. The movie, from director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day and Tears of the Sun), has a stupid plot supposedly lifted from history, if history was written by Monty Python, which deals with a Roman general Artuos and his rag tag band of ""knights"" defending a failing and retreating Roman empire from invading Saxons and the Woads (who are lead by Elmer Fudd and look like rejects from Braveheart). Along the way, Arthur (played by Owen) decides the Roman empire is evil (there's a shocker didn't he see Gladiator) and joins the Woads to stop the Saxons. Ok, I really can't go into the plot any more than that. It isn't that I don't want to give any secrets away, but if I try to say more of the plot my head could explode. Instead, I will just tell you of how the ""historic"" take on the Arthur legend screwed up the Arthur legend. It is easy to do because there is not one thing in the movie that is historic or true to legend.

2146142,4,B0002YLCFQ,"KING ARTHUR Unrated Director's Cut (Touchstone) is better than the theatrical version.  When I saw ""King Arthur"" on the big screen, I was expecting a movie filled with myth, mystery, magic and mayhem.  In the director's cut, at least the mayhem has been considerably enhanced and it appears other moments and elements have been added that create a more satisfying movie experience.

Publicity for ""King Arthur"" said it's the untold story of the real man who became the Arthur of legend. But in fact this is merely screenwriter David Franzoni's politically correct take on snippets of loosely interpreted fifth century history.

Clive Owen is a forceful screen presence as Arturus and Stellen Skarsgrd is very effective as his Saxon nemesis Cedric.  A game Keira Knightly goes ballistic as warrior Guinevere in her skimpy leather battle gear and face paint.

But even with a terrific set piece battle on a frozen lake and the extended, bloody confrontation at Badon Hill, this film does not do justice to the extreme religious and political forces -- primitive Christianity, paganism, Roman occupation and of course Pict, Saxon and Celtic concerns and claims -- that warred for control and in some cases survival in fifth century Briton.

The extras include an all too brief round table discussion with cast and crew.  It's interesting to see and hear producer Jerry Bruckheimer, director Antoine Fuqua, stars Clive Owen and Keira Knightly share their insights and anecdotes about the film-making process and their characters.  There's an OK making-of featurette and better than average commentary by an articulate Fuqua.",1103500800,8,1620,5.2
2146143,3,B0002YLCFQ,"A film by Antoine Fuqua

While the myth and legend of King Arthur and His Knights of the Round Table have been around in one form or another for centuries, there is little solid historical evidence that there was an actual King named Arthur or what his exploits may or may not have been, or even what century he may or may not have lived in.  The title cards at the start of the movie makes a new claim of accuracy with historical basis, but from watching documentaries on the History Channel before ""King Arthur"" was released theatrically, it seems that this movie offers one of many possible interpretations on the Arthur Legend.  No retelling of the legend is going to be completely accurate, assuming there was an Arthur, so take this movie with a grain of salt and as entertainment.

Many of the other movies about Arthur deal with a magic sword being pulled out of a stone, and powerful magic being wielded by Merlin (John Boorman's ""Exaclibur""), and there is even a musical ""Camelot"", not to mention the rather bad but strangely enjoyable ""First Knight"".  Forget every other Arthurian movie that you have seen thus far because ""King Arthur"" is nothing like those movies.  There is no magic, no knights bursting into song, and no Richard Gere.  This is a darker, more realistic movie from the director of ""Training Day"".

""King Arthur"" is set in the fifth century.  Rome is the de facto ruler of Britain, though via proxy.  Roman Knights hold sway in Britain, enforcing the law for Citizens and keeping the ""barbarians"" away.  In this movie, the Knights that are in Britain were originally from Sarmatia, a tribe far to the East.  These Sarmatians, having lost their battle against Rome have accepted as a term of their surrender that all of their male children will serve in the Roman Army.  These men are serving under Lucius Artorius Castus, or Arthur (Clive Owen).  Along with Arthur are the other ""legendary"" knights and Sarmatians Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd), Gawain (Joel Edgerton), Galahad (Hugh Dancy), and Bors (Ray Winstone).  Together, with other unnamed knights, the Sarmatians protect their corner of Britain and their tour of duty will be over with the arrival of the Bishop Germanius (Ivano Marescotti).  The Bishop has other ideas.  He will only release the knights after they fulfill one more task.  They must ride north, into territory occupied by the Woads (native Britons) where there is a Saxon Army on the brink of invasion, and rescue a young man whom the Pope in Rome is grooming as his successor.  Only then with Arthur and his men be free to return to Sarmatia.  They argue, the grumble, the get angry, and they submit.

On the way they encounter Merlin (Stephen Dillane), no longer a sorcerer, but a leader of a tribe of Woads.  Upon rescuing the boy, Arthur also rescues a young woman named Guinevere (Keira Knightley).  Guinevere is not the refined princess who's beauty ruined Camelot, but a Woad prisoner who is starving and abused.  She is freed by Arthur, befriended even though she is a barbarian, and through their discussions Arthur begins to question his place as a Roman.  Arthur is part Briton, part Sarmatian, so his world is not the same as that of Bors or Lancelot.  Guinevere also is a warrior, able to shoot her bow with great skill and once, late in the movie, she charges into battle with sword drawn (her scenes with the swords are the least convincing when she tries to match power and strength with men.  Keira Knightley is a small woman).

The battle scenes are done more in the style of ""Braveheart"", though with a surprisingly lack of blood and visible brutality.  Clive Owen's Arthur is a solid leader, though one lacking in charisma.  He seems the leader who has earned the trust of his men over a long period of time by being a strong warrior, brave, intelligent, and always faithful, but not with this force of his personality.  That is good for a leader, bad for a leading man.  Owen was fantastic in ""Closer"", but his powerful personality is pushed to the side here.  Everybody else in the movie is acceptable and believable in their roles, and Keira Knightley was just fine as a different sort of Guinevere right up until the part where she parried a sword swung by a much larger man.  She was best when using the bow and when using her agility in battle.  She lost me when she used strength to win in battle.

This Director's Cut Edition restored scenes that needed to be cut from the theatrical release and reportedly adds a bit more brutality to the battles.  This was evident near the end, but not so much early on in the movie.  Not having seen the theatrical release, I am not able to comment on the differences between the two versions of ""King Arthur"".

This isn't a bad movie.  It is ""Braveheart"" light with some of the actors from ""Braveheart"".  After ""Training Day"" I honestly expected something more from Antoine Fuqua, but it was nice that he did not provide a conventional Arthur movie.  If reports of his struggle with the studio to make ""his"" movie are to believed, ""King Arthur"" had the potential to be something better than it turned out to be, even with a Director's Cut.  While not a bad movie, ""King Arthur"" should not get a grade of much above a C+.  It is decent enough, but nothing special.

2146144,3,B0002YLCFQ,"It seems that in recent time historians have decided to correct the tale of King Arthur and unfortunately turn it from a romantic, magical and heroic tale, into one of a 5th century soldier of Rome, serving Roman-Imperial England against the savage battle-driven Saxons with the aid of a warrior version of Guinevere. Although this version is supposedly more historically accurate of King Arthur and is backed up by archaeological proof, I personally prefer the glorified romantic version. That's not to say that this isn't a good movie, because it still is. It may have its faults, but it definitely has its good points as well.

While many of the actors were believable in their roles, and while Clive Owen is a great actor, I didn't think that he had the screen presence to really make me believe that he could demand the loyalty and dedication of his followers that he supposedly did. I think he might be more suited to a non-leading role than the role of a `King' such as Arthur. Keira Knightly played Guinevere great considering the limitations of the script. My only gripe with her is actually unrelated to her acting, and once again script related. This version of Guinevere is a strong, battle-adept warrior of a woman initially fighting against the Romans, and yet she so easily succumbs to the charm of Arthur, someone wholly dedicated to what she hates with a passion. This weakness just wasn't in character even knowing that her cause took a back seat in light of the invading Saxons.

Regardless of criticism of the film script, the detail to historical accuracy of the time and location with respect to the costumes and settings is extremely impressive. The surroundings and somber lighting really pull you into the Era and create a highly believable world. And although the battle scenes never really brought anything new to the table, the battle on the frozen river in the mountains gave of a realism that had me shivering with the chill of the surroundings and the anxiety of the battle. With the 13 minutes of additional battle footage in this `Director's Cut', the battle's include that little bit more action, blood and gore that add to the realism and have you cringing at the sight of torn flesh.",1103068800,3,2219,4.7911227154047
2146145,3,B0002YLCFQ,"The tag line for this movie proclaims it as ""The untold true story that inspired the legend.""  Forget everything you've ever heard about Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table, as this is a completely different story.  Half-Roman, half-British Arturius, or Arthur, leads a band of young men who have been promised by their fathers to serve the Roman empire for 15 years.  On what was to be the last day of their servitude, a Roman bishop sends them on one final, possibly doomed quest to rescue the pope's favorite Godson while holding back an entire army of Saxons.  Will the ""knights"" continue to stand with Arthur?  Will they prevail?

As Arthur, Clive Owen is morose and distant, failing to crack a smile the entire movie.  The most famous knight, Lancelot, is vaguely spotlighted at times, but overall, his role is minimal.  In fact, although most of the actors give decent performances--most notably Stellan Skarsgrd as the villainous leader of the Saxons--this movie is about neither the characters nor the plot.  No, the main feature of the film is the gruesome, bloody battle scenes.  Courtesy of the ""director's cut,"" the battles are replete with beheadings, amputations, and plenty of blood flying.  Although at times reminiscent of Braveheart, these scenes unfortunately seem to go on forever, with a level of violence that feels complete unnecessary.  Only in two instances--a unique battle waged on ice mid-movie and the early moments of the final conflict between the British and the Saxons at the very end--are the fight scenes more subtle and effective.

Fans of the traditional Arthur legend, beware:  this is not the movie for you.  But if you are open to alternate interpretations, prefer your heroes to be sullen, and never really liked Lancelot anyway, by all means, see this film.",1102896000,2,1806,4.973333333333334
2146146,3,B0002YLCFQ,"KING ARTHUR attempts to do what very few Arthur movies have done before.  The movie attempts to take the legend out of the Arthur story and place in within a semi-historical context.  The story the movie tells takes place towards the end of the Roman Empire (in fact, just about 25 years prior to Rome's actual fall) and just prior to the beginning of the Dark Ages that will sweep over most of Europe. Artorious Castus (Clive Owen), otherwise known as Arthur, is the leader of a special group of knights taken from their homeland by Rome and sent to the Empire's farthest realm, Brittain to defend the border along Hadrian's Wall for 15 years.

Arthur has become a living legend in Brittain over the past 15 years and tales of his deeds have been told to the Pope in Rome. Arthur espouses a spirit of democracy, giving all a chance to speak, making plans together sitting around a round table. His methods are unorthodox, but successful and his men will follow him anywhere.  Lancelot, Galahad, Tristan, Gawain, and Bors are all that remain of the many who first sat at the table 15 years before.

On the eve that Arthur and his knights are to be discharged, the Bishop gives them one last assignment.  Rome is abandoning Brittain to the Saxons. However, the Pope's favorite ""son"" and assumed heir, Alecto, are in danger of being killed by the invading Saxons. Arthur and his men are ordered to rescue the boy and his family and deliver them safe through Hadrian's Wall. It's a dangerous journey. Not only are the Saxon's a problem, but so are the natives--people Arthur have been fighting and killing for the past 15 years. But the times are changing and the land and people yearn to be united and to be free.

KING ARTHUR has several things going for it.  First there is the acting. Clive Owen gives a great performance as Arthur, presented the legendary hero in a way not seen on screen before. There are several other good secondary performances (including Ray Winstone as Bors), but Keira Knightley is particularly interesting to watch as the pagan princess Guinevere.  The battles in the movie are quite action packed and enjoyable to watch. There's also a lot of great scenery. Then there's the concept, placing the Arthur story in a real historical context is something that really hasn't been done before.

However, with all that KING ARTHUR has going for it, it suffers terribly from the one thing that ruins otherwise great movies more than any other, a bad script. The mission Arthur and his knights go on isn't all that cheesy and seems realistic.  The great battle literally on ice is a wonderful idea that was used to it's potential. However, it's all ruined by cheesy dialogue and copy-catism.  The last 20 minutes of KING ARTHUR (not including the final wedding scene) is a cheap rip-off right out of BRAVEHEART. Almost everything from Arthur's speech, to a sword in the ground, to the swelling score, and certain battle formations are copies that look almost identical to scenes from BRAVEHEART. Except, in KING ARTHUR the scenes come off as being comical (instead of a teeming army of poor Scotsman, Arthur delivers a passionate speech about not taking away our freedom to 4 knights). So much effort, wasted on one major scene and a few bad lines of dialogue and instead of getting a moving masterpiece on the possible historical King Arthur, we're left with an average movie that gives us an aftertaste of having seen this before in a much better way.

This special edition of the DVD includes several features including an alternate ending, several featurettes, the usual director commentary, a knight trivia game, photo galleries, and an X-Box game demo.  I liked the trivia thing the most.",1102723200,3,3713,4.7542768273716955

To me, Jerry Bruckheimer represents everything wrong with most big budgeted films in Hollywood, all action and no substance. I didn't have much interest in seeing ""King Arthur"" over the summer but when I had the opportunity to review the unedited version on dvd, I thought to give ""King Arthur"" a chance. I'm glad I did. I found myself loving the film from the moment I saw a young Lancelot to the last scene.

I didn't go into this film expecting the the film to be the truth but to be entertained instead so I wasn't expecting a history lesson. I definitely was entertained. The film begins with a young Lancelot being recruited by the Roman empire to serve in its military for fifteen years which was a common practice for British men during the era (at least in the film). Speed ahead fifteen years, Arthur and his fellow knights are just about to complete their indentured servitude to the Roman empire when they are given one last mission to rescue a young man destined to be a pop from the invading Saxon army. This final mission (which was not by choice) causes minor conflict for Arthur and the knights of the Round Table. During the course of the mission, Arthur encounters Guinevere and her brother and rescuses them along with the Romans before the Saxons could reach the castle.

I enjoyed the performances by all the actors involved but I really thought Clive Owen as Arthur and Kiera Knightley as Guinevere really stood out for me. I liked the fact that Guinevere was by no means your atypical damsel in distress. She was just as much as a warrior as she was as a young woman. The battle scenes with the Saxons were visually spectacular. The costumes were great, especially King Arthur's armor which reminded me of Russell Crowe in ""Gladiator"". What really made this film enjoyable for me is Hans Zimmer's gorgeous film score and the gorgeous vocals of Moira Brennan. I loved the music.

My only fault I could find ""King Arthur"" is that this film reminded me too much of either ""Braveheart"" or ""Gladiator"". I felt that this film was trying to be the big, epic dramas those films were. I thought the speech Clive Owen gives before he and his fellow knights go into their final battle with the Saxons was cheesy and sounded too much like the cheesy speech that Mel Gibson gives in ""Braveheart"". As wonderfully choreographed as the battle scenes were, I thought the choreography was a bit too polished and I thought I was watching a ballet, not a movie, like in ""Gladiator"". Overall, I enjoyed ""King Arthur"" immensely for all its flaws and gaffes. The bonus dvd features were very entertaining to watch as well.",1102723200,3,2709,4.604554865424431

2146149,4,B0002YLCFQ,"This film is a more realistic, less mythical retelling of the legend of King Arthur, set at the end of the Roman occupation of Britain in the 400s AD. In this version, Arthur is a half-Roman commander; and his knights are men forced to fight for the Empire. They are on one last mission before the men will gain their freedom and Arthur will return to Rome. Guinevere is a young warrior woman fighting for her homeland whom they rescue during their mission. When the Romans plan to abandon Britain to the invading Saxons, Arthur must decide where his home really is, and if he will fight to defend Britain.

I can't really commend on the historical accuracy of this movie, because I am not that familiar with this era. However, it is an enjoyable action-adventure movie, and I imagine what innacuracies there are would not be noticed by most people. I never saw the original theatrical version, but I am guessing most of the added material was in the battle scenes. The additions made it more realistic (I'm assuming most of the gore was not in the theatrical version) but at the same time the battle scenes were a bit overly long. The story is very different from traditional version of the legend, with basically all the mystical elements removed, as well as the characters being quite different. I personally enjoyed the changes to Guinevere's character, since she is not always portrayed so favorably in many versions of the story. I liked seeing her as a strong warrior rather than a damsel in distress. Anyway, the film is pretty much an imagining of what could have really happened if the legends of King Arthur were based on real happenings. I'd recommend giving this film a try if you're looking for an action-adventure movie to pass a couple of hours.

If, however, you are open to seeing new interpretations of the tale then I would recommend watching this movie.  This movie does a good job of combining the legend with history and a little bit of fantasy/epic-heroism.  In doing this it becomes a movie that tells the story of the ""real"" Arthur and yet has enough elements of the legend to imply how the real story could have developed into the legend after years of retelling and exageration.  One thing that I personally liked(others may disagree) is that they sidelined the love triangle between Arthur, Lancelot, and Guinevere.  There were interactions that can be seen as the origins of the legend, but the love/betrayal plotline did not overwhelm the more engaging central plot.

2146175,3,B0002YLCFQ,"Imagine King Arthur with no romance, chivalry or magic and in their place bad attitudes, muddy faces, and decapitations.  This grittier, nastier, supposedly ""more real"" King Arthur is the one presented in this film.  And no amount of good acting, special effects and exciting battles can make up for that difference.  Your enjoyment of this film will greatly depend on which version of the classic story excites you most.

Regardless, there is much to be appreciated here.  There is a very exciting action sequence on a frozen river in the mountains where you can practically feel the cold and tension.  Numerous shots stand out and draw you into the word the filmmakers have created.  The amount of detail in costumes and sets is quite stunning.  But what the film really needs are characters that we can care about.  I always felt an arms distance from everyone in this film.  Rarely did I care what happened to anyone.  I place blame on the script more than the actors who all turn in very strong performances with what they are given to work with.  Clive Owen in particular makes Arhtur a very believable anti-hero.

This Director's Cut adds about 13 minutes to the theatrical version.  I'm assuming all the added scenes are battle scenes since the battles do tend to go on and on.  Watching the battle scenes was exciting at first and then I just got worn out by them.  I found myself thinking of The Lord of the Rings films and how engaging those battles were.  King Arthur tries very hard to hit the same highs but it falls short.

While there is some great work on display here it comes off feeling hollow.  Whether or not a more romantic version of this story is more accurate than the gritty version presented here, I would bet that most would prefer the romanticized version.",1102377600,5,1786,4.6485623003194885
2146176,4,B0002YLCFQ,"I, for one, am glad that someone tried to make a more believable and plausable movie version of the Arthurian Saga than Disney. No magic swords and talking owls here - great! I also think a few people should read a little history before attacking the percieved ""historical inaccuracies"" in this film. Most historians agree that if there was an Arthur, he was probably Roman. Certainly the ideals of the Round Table are more Roman than contemperary British of the time, as was the use of heavy calvery and formation fighting. As for Hadrian's Wall, it was built by the Romans to keep out the Saxons. Saxons being anybody that wasn't Roman - including Angles, Jutes, Frissians, Gauls, Irish, Scots, Scandanavians and native Britons. The term basically meant barbarian. Of course they would attack over Hadrian's Wall, to do otherwise would be like attacking Rhode Island by way of New York City. Why attack thru the most populated part of the country? Land in the north, consolidate and attack to the south, which is exactly what they did - many times. Of course, no movie is going to be perfect and this one ceratinly has it's flaws. However, it's a refreshing change from the Dungeons and Dragons versions that we have been treated to previously.",1102377600,4,1246,4.8
2146177,5,B0002YLCFQ,"Clive Owen and Ioan Gruffudd fans you will not be disappointed.  This version of a tale many times told - is finally the one I think people with a romantic sense of honour will revel in.  Or to put it bluntly the way I always wished it to be shared.  In the past this beautiful story has been shaded by the affair between Lancelot and Gwenivere.  As a child growing up on the heroics of Arthur, the magic of Merlin and the unwavering loyalty of the men of the round table - I found it hard to believe that Lancelot would betray Arthur in such a way or that Gwenivere would cheat on a man whos ideals so many people sacrificed thier lives for.  It just didn't click.  In this remake though Lancelot seems to have a roaming eye for the fair maid it is indeed his love for Arthur that prevails.  In fact Gwenivere is the push Arthur needs to fulfill his destiny.  For as we do know behind every great man there is a greater woman.  Hans Zimmers music is hauntingly beautiful as per usual and simply ads depth to scenes that initially seemed dark but push the story at an exciting pace. I particulary liked the fact that when mounted on horseback all characters seemed comfortable and added a greater sense of wholeness to their roles-they became knights.  There is nothing worse than seeing a hero go to dash off on his faithful steed and then be flopping around like some amatuer making it totally unbelievable-its all about the details.  I also liked the fact that Antoine Fuqua and guru producer extrodinare Jerry Bruckheimer made sure that setting and costuming were just as important as casting-it was a pleasure to watch.  On a side note Keira Knightly whos part was relatively small in this picture was a good fit for this character-she is a tangible beauty.  Bow weilding and mudd encrusted you believe in her.  This movie brought to me a sense of hope that good really does exist or did once- there is right and wrong and in the not so distant past someone sacrificed everything for the greater good and for that will be remebered for all time.  I recommend this film for those who believe that actions speak louder than words.
NOTE: People it's a movie-one that will take you away on an adventure-when you disect any movie ie. historical blunders you take away from the magic.

The movie is GOOD.  Not great, but very good.  The acting by the entire main cast is superb (the only really bad scene was when the young Lancelot runs to his father at the very beginning - the kid should have at least been told to put more passion in the delivery of the few lines he had!)  I thoroughly fell for each of the characters, (particularly Bors, who plays not only the comedic relief at times, but also manages to display a tender side as well)  Granted, character development could have been fleshed out a bit, especially on why exactly the Saxons were in Britain (I'm no history buff, so forgive me if that should be common knowledge - but it shouldn't be assumed that the entire audience will have this knowledge), and the development of Arthur from child to adult (as well as that of his knights), but overall the movie was not 'stupid' and felt like something that could really have taken place.

It had great action, well-thought-out sequences and a tangible sense of camaraderie among the ""knights.""

Come on!  If all stories were told the same way the world would be a boring place!  I, too, was very familiar with the traditional King Arthur story, and was pleasantly surprised to see a different take on it.  Who knows what really happened?  Nobody does, and that's why it's fun to see what people do with the story.  I had to laugh when some expressed their displeasure at Merlin not being portrayed as a wizard.  In that case, it couldn't have been an accurate protrayal of Merlin, right?  Please!  Since when are wizards anything but fantasy characters!

How can be that Arthur falls in love for a girl that he only meet 2 minutes ago???? I don't know if he is stupid or complex. Of course that here Lancelot character doesnt have any purpose, since there are no love triangles, no egolatrism that lead to defeat, nothing. The character of Merlin is so stupidly develope here that actually it doesnt have any develope. Only taks 2 minutes and say the most obvius (therefore stupid) word ever said on screen. In the previews talked about him as a great politician. Here he seems a great desilution.

In order to destroy completely the legend of Arthur, here he is show as a mercenary, that help the opresors to fullfil his benefits. How can be that he punish a roman for being cruel, but licks the ass of the most important Romans?? This show him also as no sence of morality, only a common mercenary that sell his ass to the best offer.

So, there are no heroics, no good dialogs (only a bunch of bad words), no real characters (the ""evil"" guy actually is so weak that gets killed in the first fight he involves, and his son is so ridiculos that seems more a character for Jackass!), and a story that put you to sleep before you can leave the cinema.",1100649600,3,1375,4.405511811023622
2146186,5,B0002YLCFQ,"Hi - John Matthews here - I was the Historical Advisor on the film. I just want to weigh in with my own take on some the nonsense which has been written about the historical innacuracies in the film. There were some inevitably - but not many, and mostly so small as to pass unnoticed. After all, we were telling a story, not writing a documentary. That said, I can promise you that the story of Arthur as told in the movie, is about as close as you'll ever get to the truth about Arthur. There really was an historical Lucius Artorius Castus and he really did lead a band of Sarmatian warriors from a land roughly between the Black and Red seas today (and no,that's not Russia -which didn't even exist at the time). These men were posted to Britain  - about 5500 of them - and they left an indelible stamp on the memory of the British people. Their stories, and the myths they knew and lived by, were the seeds from which later, Celtic stories of Arthur grew. So we are not saying Arthur wasn't a Celt any more than we are saying he was a Sarmatian for that matter - just that as a Roman officer, stationed on Hadrian's Wall, here in the UK - his deeds and valor paved the way for all the later Arthurs. The problem has been that the Arthurian industry, which began in the 11th century, established itself so firmly in our hearts and minds that we can now only think of that Arthur. The reality, as you will see in the film,  is very different. So,if you want to know how the story of Arthr really got under way - before the magic and the fantasy got in there - see this film - the best Dark Age movie ever to come out of Hollywood! And if you still want to know more read C Scott-Littleton and Linda Malcor's book 'From Scythia to Camelot' (Linda was my collegue in backing up the history for the movie)or watch out for books by each of us in the pipeline,",1100649600,419,1857,4.1988795518207285
2146187,2,B0002YLCFQ,"I already knew from the History Channel and some BBC documentary that King Arthur's legend originated from a Roman-trained Briton in the Dark Ages who united his people and fought against the Anglo-Saxons.  His legendary heroics were passed down through generations by word of mouth until his tales were finally written down in the Middle Ages in the more mythical version we're familiar with today.

I was interested in Antoine Fuqua's Dark Ages take of the original Arthurian archetype.  You were almost expecting it to be nearly historically accurate and thought-provoking the way Braveheart was.  Not convincing at all. The script was complete crap.  Predictable soldier comraderie talk.  Predictable lover's lines.  Predictable idealistic speeches on freedom.  I thought I was watching a soap opera. What a waste of brilliant  talent.  Background facts were confusing:  is Arthur a Briton, a Roman, a Sarmatian...an anything? What were his knights supposed to be doing anyway? And weren't there supposed to be 12 knights?

Guinevere gets introduced to the story in an interesting way.  How did Arthur know she was there?  What made him decide to automatically look in that spot?  The story is not very tight either. Arthur doesn't seem so wise and all-knowing as we know him to be. He doesn't stand out from the rest of the knights in anyway other than the fact the he is their commander.

The Anglo Saxon leader played by Stellan Skaarsgard was the only character I liked.  He didn't talk much or say much, but when he did, it was short and to the point.

2146189,2,B0002YLCFQ,"Antoine Fuqua's ""King Arthur"" manages to suck all of the magic, valor, and mystery out of the much-loved Arthurian legends.  What is left is a dull, dreary, generic action flick in which King Arthur's noble Knights of the Round Table curse, drink, crack crude jokes, and sex-it up.  Being that ""King Arthur"" has touted itself as ""the untold true story that inspired the legend"", I was left with the impression that King Arthur's knights were crude, dirty bums that sat around all day; drinking and complaining.  Merlin makes an appearance too as part of a face-painted tribe of barbarians living in the woods.  Can you feel the magic here, folks?

This ""true story"" is bogged down with stilted speeches about how every man is born free and equal and frantic, confusing battle sequences.  And the script?  Here's a sampling of some of the cinematic masterpieces that await you:

Lancelot: There is a large number of lonely men out there.

Guinevere: Don't worry; I won't let them rape you.

Arthur: O merciful God, I have such need of Your mercy now...

Lancelot: Why do you always talk to God and not to me?

Gawain: The gifts the gods gave me I use in battle or in bed.

Galahad: Imagine what a lovely, quiet place the world would be if everyone had their throats slit.

Horton: God help us. What are they?

Bors: Blue demons that eat Christians alive. You're not a Christian, are you?

The acting just don't cut it either.  From previous experience, I realized that Clive Owen's King Arthur and Keira Knightley's Guinevere (who is now a painted pagan prison inhabitant) are supposed to be falling in love, but it is never apparent to the audience until they, predictably, jump in bed together.

Yes, there are historical accounts of a real Arthur, and they mention that he has Roman ties or of Roman lineage.  This movie is pure Hollywood....taking a concept, portraying it as ""the real take"" and then take the concept that could have been accurate and totally distort it out of all recognition.  Despite the innacuracies, I was glad to see a movie that showed Arthur in this light,  I have been an avid amateur Roman historian/reenactor for quite a long time now and it was nice to see something in a movie dealing with this great time of upheaval.

One thing I was very surprised about was that Pelagius was brought up in the movie, now for me....someone who is interested in Roman and early Christian history it was exciting and very interesting too see this in a movie.  But for the average person they will know absolutely nothing about Pelagius and the ideas and concepts are not given in great enough depth to truly educate anyone about this very interesting person, they will just look around in confusion and ask what that nonsense was all about.  On the other hand, the stuff you would think they would focus on such as battles and the withdrawl of Rome from Britain is barely visible, one major battle and a few scenes of Romans marching away...come on.......

As for wanting a better more in depth view of who the historical Arthur might really have been, and get a very real and believable explanation for many of the mystical aspects of the Arthurian legend I highly recommend the Camulod Chronicles by Jack Whyte.",1099094400,6,1653,4.675862068965517
2146191,2,B0002YLCFQ,"This isn't a critique of `King Arthur' but a response to David Franzoni's claims about the historicity of the movie.

I've been an Arthurian buff for years; I'm not really familiar with John Matthews's theories but I can draw on others, particularly John Morris's `The Age of Arthur'. Whatever source you use, the consensus is that the basis for the `historical' Arthur rests on two Welsh documents:

First: Nennius in the 9th Century, who tells us of `Arthur the Soldier', a Briton who fought the Saxons c. 500; he defeated the Saxons 12 times, the last being at Mount Badon.

Second: `The Annales Cambrai' from the 10th Century, which tells us how Arthur defeated the Saxons at Mount Badon in 516 A.D.

We know from an earlier British text - Gildas in the 6th Century - that Mount Badon was a real battle.

'King Arthur's screenplay links a historical personage - Lucius Artorius Castus-  with a real event - the battle of Mount Badon. The problem is: these events are 300 years apart!

Sure there was a real Lucius Artorius Castus who commanded Sarmatian knights around 175 A.D. - but what's he got to do with the other Arthur who fought at Mount Badon? All that links them is a name. It's like saying that because there was an American President called George, who defeated the British in 1783, he has to be the same guy who invaded Iraq! Or because we know of a British royal called Charles, who got his head chopped off in 1649, he has to be the same man who married Princess Diana in 1981! What Mr Franzoni seem to be saying is that Lucius Artorius Castus lived twice - first in the 2nd and then in the 5th Century.

Because the film shoe-horns two different eras together - 175 A.D. and 500 A.D. - `King Arthur' is full of anachronisms.

The film is set in 467 A.D. According to King Arthur' Britain then is still part of the Roman empire - although Rome is just about to pull out. All accounts show Britain was separated from Rome about 410 - 60 years earlier! That makes the movie prologue - set in 452 - totally unhistorical. How could Rome send Sarmatian knights from Sarmatia to Britain when neither Sarmatia nor Britain were part of Rome then?

We're told Pelagius had just died in 467 - actually he'd been dead for 50 years. Similarly how come Germanus is pottering around Britain in 467 when he'd been dead for 20 years?

The biggest howler in the movie, however, seems to be an anachronism of Mr Franzoni's own invention. We're told the Romans are busy putting down the Woads. Now I've read many books over many years on Roman and Dark Age Britain and I've yet to come across any mention of the Woads.  Who are these guys? As well as adding a fictitious race to the population of 5th Century Britain, the film seem to ignore one - where are the Britons? The Celtic-speaking ancestors of the Welsh, the main people of Britain at the time, seem to be AWOL. `King Arthur' ignores the Celtic tradition behind much of the Arthurian legend, reflected in sources like `The Mabinogion'. Why no mention of characters mentioned in those sources, like Arthur's sidekicks Kei and Bedwyr?

Instead of these, `King Arthur' includes characters that are literary inventions - both Lancelot and Bors first appear in French medieval tales - and others - Merlin and Tristan- not directly connected to Arthur in the earliest accounts. We know Tristan existed - a plinth marking his grave has been discovered - but this locates him in Cornwall around 560 A.D.

Two semi-historical character in the film are Cerdic and his son Cynric, but they seem to be the in the wrong time and place. Cerdic claims to be pure-blooded Saxon but his name is British, leading authorities to speculate he was a British traitor who joined with the Saxons. The only source for Cerdic is the `Anglo Saxon Chronicle' which dates him between 495 and 534, two generations after the film. It also locates him on the south coast of England, near Southampton.

Which brings us to my final beef with `King Arthur' - the geography. Arthur's sent to rescue some Romans trapped in their villa north of Hadrian's Wall. Except there weren't any villas north of Hadrian's wall! This whole area had been abandoned by Rome by the early 5th Century - probably the wall too. Also all the evidence - texts, archaeology, place names- locates the Saxons at this time in the east and south-east of England - a long way from where `King Arthur' is set.

The consensus is that Arthur - if he existed- was a Briton fighting Saxons in central and southern England c. 500. At this time most of Britain was under the control of Celtic-speaking Britons; Britain had been separated from Rome since about 410 and Roman civilisation was a fading memory. I recommend anyone interested in discovering a real historical Arthur to read Rosemary Sutcliff's `Sword At Sunset' for a superb fictionalisation of that story - no Woads in her novel!",1098576000,31,4882,4.6200923787528865
2146192,4,B0002YLCFQ,"As a student of Classical History (Greece & Rome) this movie inspired me to learn more about the people north of Hadrons Wall. In other words the people that the film was portraying that Guinevere & Merlin came from.  These people were the Pictish people of 5th century Scotland, or the area North of Hadrons Wall.

What the film inspired me to learn was that Pictland, as the Pictish homeland was called, was made up of a large area of what is now modern day Scotland, mainly in the low-lying coastal areas of Eastern Scotland where they sustained themselves through fishing and farming. The Picts weren't any one particular race or culture per se, but a military alliance which was formed around 100 AD to defend against the Roman invaders. The name Pict itself is believed to be derived from the Latin word Picti, ""the painted men"". In fact, the Pictish nation out-lasted the would-be conquerors and predated the formal organization of both the Scots and Irish. Historical and archaeological records also show that they were also quite fierce warriors, judging by accounts of those (like the Scots and the Irish) whom they defeated in battle. They were the dominant military power in that area for almost 500 years.

The language which they spoke is believed to have been similar to the modern day Welsh language, fitting into a category which linguists call the P Celtic Languages while modern Gaelic and Irish are considered ""Q-Celtic"". Not much is actually known about their dialect because the Picts didn't keep written records, but even today many Pictish place names still exist in Scotland.

Almost all of what is now known about them is from accounts of others and the few artifacts the Picts themselves left behind. Chief among these were ornate carved stones which represent some of the high points of Celtic art. There are inscriptions on the stones written in an alphabet called Ogham, variations of which were also used by the Scots and Irish. Although the inscriptions of their Celtic counterparts have been translated, there has yet to be any successful translation of the Pictish Ogham.

Despite their lack of written records, the Picts were quite advanced culturally and artistically. Between the 5th and 7th centuries AD most of them were converted to Christianity and this was reflected in the sculptures of the period. Their art retained most of its traditional elements, but they also began to add crosses and other Christian symbolism.

The Picts shared much in common with their fellow Celts, such as geography, similar language, and similar art, among other things. There were some differences however, the main one being that descent for the Picts was defined in terms of the mother rather than the father ie. matrilineal rather than patrilineal. Historical records suggest that this is what led to their disappearance, or rather their assimilation by the Scots. Because of the way in which Picts handled descent, the Scots were able to gradually absorb them through marriage. After some time, it is believed, all distinction between them had become so blurred that they were essentially indistinguishable.

Although it is generally accepted by historians and archaeologists that the Picts merged with the Scots, exact details aren't known. And with the exception of second hand accounts, there is almost no information about the Picts themselves. Because of their unique social and historical characteristics, the Picts have continued to be one of history's most intriguing mysteries.

Arthur and his men had been promised to be allowed to retire from ""military"" life are called back for one more mission.  They need to rescue a nobel held captive.  Though none of them want to do it, the knights loyal to Arthur will do it just to stand by him one more time.

The battle scenes are epic, reminicient of some of the battles from the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  The forest people are incredibly interesting and I wish the movie could have expanded on them more.

  The film opens with a young boy going off to war with other youths from his home in Sarmatia.  We learn this boy is Lancelot and he vows to his proud cheering family, that he will return.  The film jumps ahead fifteen years or so, and we see the grown Lancelot and other knights ridding across the hills.

  It then unfolds into a story of betrayal from Rome, stuggle between good friends, and a man coming to grips with the shattering thoughts that all he held dear was just an illusion.  The knight Tristan is the most interestingly portrayed and most underused in the movie.  Lancelot does come across a bit Skywalker-whiney at times, and the love scene could have been left out, but it also could have been worse. Arthur himself took the character and showed him in the most realistic un-Camelot way.  Though he stuck to his beliefs, he wasn't a cardborad ninny.  A great film, the knights were awsome, Guinevere was beautiful, as was the scenery, and the baddies were good and bad.  Watch it, enjoy it, don't over analize it, its a movie!

  Other reviewers have misquoted this movie, taken events out of context, and just looked for things to be negative about.  For one, Lancelot doesn't tell the unhindered priest, ""Your God doesn't live here."" Bors does.  Guinever is never shown to be the mother of the young boy, and she is not a vile manipulator.

  And probably one of the most emotional scenes in the movie, does involve a  bit of singing.  A very haunting song Bors' wife sings about home.

  Yes it is a violent movie, but it is a violent story.  I would much rather believe in a King Arthur that was a real person, in a real world, than the alway idealic crusader from ""First Knight,"" or the plate-mail clad knights of ""Excalibur.""  And people please stop refering to every period movie with a sword, a princess, and a tyranical king as another Braveheart, all that shows is your inablity to describe something useing your own thoughts.",1097798400,14,2239,4.497512437810945

This movie was well directed, beautiful cinematography. Suggested improvements would be if there was more romatic tension between the three.....and yes I hated to see Lancelot die.

2146206,3,B0002YLCFQ,"King Arthur is a movie that was built on sound concept but flawed in delivery and mediocre in quality. Trying to follow the lead of ""Troy"" King Arthur attempts to recreate the ""reality"" of a classic legend/myth. The plot for the movie follows along a story-line that doesnt have any wizards, dragons or magic of any sort. If you're looking for Lord of the Rings seek elsewhere. The story however is the strongest point of the movie.

As the western Roman Empire in disintegrating and babarian tribes flood the frontiers everywhere, the decision is made for Rome to withdraw from it's most far flung province - the Island of Britain. A huge wall built by the Emperor Hadrian, seperated the southern roman controlled section of the island from the barbaric north - still controlled by various celtic tribes. As the roman legions pull out of Britania, an army of barbarian invaders from northern europe - the saxons - has landed in Northumbria, and is visciously conqueroring the natives moving towards the wall. The saxons wish to use the Roman pull out as an oppritunity to take over britain for their own gain.

In all this turmoil a Roman commander on Hadrians wall rises to become the first real leader of non-roman britain. He and his knights are sent to rescue an aristocrat who is north of the wall. This is the stage for our adventure which culminates in Arthur's ultimate decision - does he go back to his homeland of Parthia which he barely remembers? or Does he stay in this new land he now calls home, and attempt to lead the people he has come to feel as ""his"" people through this dark chapter in history?

It all sounds great doesnt it? The problem is this doesnt work well at all. The acting throughout the movie is acceptable at best, and sometimes quite bad. There is little effective humor in the movie except for one particularly likeable character. The action is not very well done at all and the battles are just poorly coreographed. The only exception is the climactic battle at the end of the movie with arthur leading the britons against the saxons. This battle is semi well done but falls way short of anything in braveheart, troy, or other such films.

The characters are poorly developed and you never really care about any of them. This has exceptions but nothing in the movie feels dramatic and there are no scenes that are at all moving. The entire movie feels uninspired and generic - as though it were a very well done made-for-TV movie. Adding to this is the fact that it's a PG-13 movie, so brutal hand to hand combat actually comes off as pretty tame. Entire battles can be fought without bloodying a sword.

Visually the movie is extreamly poorly done, the effects are terrible. The one little visual gimmick they come up with is following an arrow through the air - and they use it SEVERAL times in the movie! So played out! There is a scene where the saxon army falls into a frozen river which is kind of cool, but it doesnt make up for the terrible job on the rest of arthur. The scenery is dull and the movie makes it all too obvious they used fake snow!

Uninspired and mediocre define this movie pretty well. Had I seen it on A&E or USA I might have a different reaction. But I must say that ""Attila"" (which WAS a TV-Movie) was better than this, and this is a major release! There'sno dodging it - King Arthur was an all-around disapointment and could have been a truly great movie. The fact that the setting and geo-political plot had so much potential and was so intriguing is the only thing tipping the scales to get that 3rd star.",1097539200,3,3574,4.533333333333333

The idea of protraying the historic root of the King Arthur legend was a grand idea to make a move about - how many other late Roman Empire movies have we seen set in Britain? Not many that I can think of. However, this movie simply did not deliver.

For one thing, character development was seriously lacking. Arthur, his knights, and gweneviere's characters are not deep enough. We see hints of things that could have been developed further - lancelot's ""slavery"" into the army, arthur's divided loyalties, the motivation behind the barbaric British tribe against the Celts, but none of this is fully explored. This is the depth this movie needed.

The actions scenes are okay - but the PG-13 rating hurt this film. Much of the ""realism"" we saw in gladiator, which really adds the extra spice, was edited. In this case, that extra spice may have helped this painfully scripted movie.

The middle half hour or so was also very slow and the movie dragged.

2146241,2,B0002YLCFQ,"Being a die-hard fan of the myth of King Arthur as well as Hallmark's ""Merlin"" and T.S White's ""The Once and Future King"", I found this version of King Arthur nothing else but a big mistake and a dissapointment. It was even slightly insulting that a few Roman soldiers rescuing a family would actually inspire such a complicated and beautiful legend as Arthurian scholars know by heart. It was too simple to inspire anything as glorius as the Legend of King Arthur...it wasn't close.

 In fact, it seems like like the director was trying to get rid of the original myth. There was no sword in the stone that no man could pull, there wasn't a single mention of Uther Pendragon and how he lustfully took another man's wife which resulted in Arthur, no love triangle between Lancelot, Guinevere, and Arthur, no Elaine that died of a broken heart because of Lancelot's love for Arthur's Queen, no Mordred, no Grail...the list could go on forever.

 One of the dissapointments was Arthur's origins. He was protrayed as a half-Brit half-Roman child who seems to be nothing more than a simple peasant. Where was his father who bore him from lust? Where's Ygraine, Arthur's mother? And his half-sister, Morgana le Fay? Here, he stands, as a simple peasant taken in as an indentured servant to serve Rome for fifteen years.

 The rest of the movie circles around these indentured servants which are made up of the knights in the myth - Galahad, Lancelot, and a few others. They proceed to rescue a Roman family from the Saxons, and after a few climatic action scenes, a few that were actually well done, the story ends happily. The legend didn't have anything close to a happy ending, and it's not suppose to.

 Kiera Knightly does get her acting down quite well - even though her character (Guinevere) is suddenly protrayed as a (...) Woad. Yes, she is a Celt and Celt women did fight in battle wearing little and painted their bodies blue - but since when was Guinevere and (...) Celt?

 This movie would have been better if it was a stand-alone story not related to King Arthur - because this movie does give us the ""true story"". It just degrades the entire myth.",1093305600,3,2157,4.637795275590551

2146252,3,B0002YLCFQ,"**Spoilers ahead**

Let me start by saying that I am not very familiar with Arthurian legend. I know that there was a King named Arthur, a sword named Excalibur, a Queen named Guinevere, a round table where the knights sit, and the wizard Merlin. However I don't know too much beyond that. Still, I think that King Arthur could have benefited more from the ""magic"" of the legends because it doesn't do much to set itself apart from other movie epics.

Clive Owen does an adequate job of portraying a dark, brooding Arthur, a former Roman soldier. He cares about his fellow knights, and deplores the fact that he has to take them on a final journey that could have them killed, because Rome had previously promised that they could go free. Bors is great comic relief in this movie, especially when he made comment about one of his children named ""number 3"". The costume designs were well done. I loved the look of Arthur's Roman armour. And, of course, the battles scenes were of grand, sweeping scale, with hundreds of soldiers duking it out in choreographed fight scenes.

So what's my problem with King Arthur? First off Guinevere, played by Keira Knightley, is a fairly one-dimensional character. We learn next to nothing about her other than that she is good with a bow. In this movie Knightley is nothing more than eye candy (albeit very nice eye candy). The character of Merlin is also just another military leader, and not a wizard. And just like Guinevere, we get to know nothing much about Merlin himself.

Also, despite the fact that this movie strives for ""authenticity"", the heroes are given seemingly superhuman abilities. For example, in a battle across a frozen lake when Arthur and his knights confront a Saxon army, the Saxons try and shoot arrows against the knights but are out of range. But of course the knights are never out of range, and kill dozens of Saxons. One knight is also able to crack the entire frozen lake with his axe, with the crack encompassing a large part of the lake, with most of the Saxons standing on it. Is that authentic? Give me a break.

The Saxon leader Cerdic is unimpressive as a villain. He does not inspire any real sense of fear or dread. In one scene, he says to kill everyone him and his armies encounter. One would think that he could take prisoners and use them as slave labour, but nope, the movie has make him want to kill everybody, which is frankly a cheap ploy in the movie's plot to make the audience hate him.

Lastly, King Arthur borrows much from previous epics. So much so that it's as if they were working of some sort of ""How to Make an Epic Movie Cookbook"". Let's see, take one part brooding hero, add in a cheap love story, big battle scenes, evil-for-no-purpose villain, and a final scene where the hero MUST kill the villain on the battlefield, and you got yourself movie.

Overall, King Arthur is not a bad movie, just an average one. Had I've not seen movies like The Lord of the Rings, Braveheart, Gladiator, The Last Samurai, Ran, etc., I might have been more impressed. But for a movie that strives for historical accuracy as a selling point (which is in itself stupid considering we have no hard evidence Arthur even existed), this movie falls flat.

I give King Arthur 6 out of 10.",1092700800,,3261,4.571917808219178

Antoine Fuqua did an excellent job of creating the gritty atmosphere of what was a very...well...gritty time.  For all the critics who have written reviews on this site: this movie was not made with the intention of continuing the same classic Arthurian tale(how many ways can we actually tell the same story over and over).  It was a movie rooted more in actual history then in Legend.  I too enjoyed many of the classic tellings of King Arthur and his Knights--but I also loved this movie as well, because it was different and not the same tired story.  Clive Owen was perfectly cast as King Arthur, he has the look and feel of a Roman soldier who is torn between his homeland and his duties for Rome.

2146255,4,B0002YLCFQ,"This is a very good swashbuckler, with a bit more reality than the typical Arthur. To tell the truth, I like seeing a bit less magic and a bit more that makes sense. For example, this movie retells the ""sword in the stone."" That retelling loses the hocus-pocus and prophecy, but gains a lot in personal, human meaning. The movie demotes Merlin from some mystical being to a pagan priest/leader. On the other hand, he is also promoted to powerful political figure, prepared to weigh the relative threats of different enemies and shift alliances as needed.

The battle scenes show some real creativity. The fight on the iced lake, even when you know the outcome well in advance, still builds well. The excitement of the final battle was not just due to the sheer mass of its mayhem, it also had a tempo and some scripting to keep the viewer watching.

Of course, Knightley's Guinevere kept people watching, too. The babe appeal was there, especially in that combat uniform. If you haven't seen it yet - well, there are some outfits that really require a figure as slim as hers. More than that, though, I enjoyed the role of Guinevere as battle-maid and woman who gets what she wants. Oh, and the ""sword upheld"" at the end was a nice touch, too.

This movie offers a lot, just not the King Arthur of myth. If you want the chivalry, questing, and pining of the standard story, you just won't find what you want. This movie really has to be taken as a mideval action flick of its own, not a retelling of the familiar story. If you can take it in that spirit, there's a lot to enjoy.

 Antoine Fuqua should have his green-card revoked and never be allowed to work in the US again. Any man who can cause Keira Knightly to look un-hot should be sued and his money distributed to worthy filmmakers who have something to say.

 Now on to specific points:

 1. Arthur, a follower of Pelagius, really? Come on. First off, does anyone who worked on the film actually know who Pelagius was, or what he stood for? If they did, Arthur wouldn't have been such a strident Christian.

 2. Arthur as a one-final-mission-before-your-retirement flick? Gads, I cannot think of a worse premise for a Knights of the Round Table movie.

 3. Was it Gawain or Galahad who was apparently raised by Mongol warriors before becoming Saramatian on his way to Britain?

 4. And the entire myth of a relationship between Lancelot and Guinevere (sic) is found in a series of ridiculous side-long glances? Gag.

2146276,3,B0002YLCFQ,"After watching Troy, I figured King Arthur would be much of the same - a semi-historical retelling of a legend, minus the fantastical elements. I was half right.

 This is the King Arthur as historians imagine him to be. Not a thoroughly medieval knight, but a Roman military leader, struggling to retain control of Britain after the fall of Rome. Abandoned by his allies and surrounded on all sides by barbarians, Arthur must rally his infamous horsemen and apply Roman law to a lawless land.

 Well, at least that's what the History Channel told me. There's more to the plot. However, the plot was difficult to understand because of the extremely poor sound quality of the film. The audio crew obviously had some challenges, since the majority of the action takes place outdoors. Everyone mumbles every line, such that important points are lost.

 To wit, Artorius Castus (King Arthur, played by Clive Owen) is looking forward to releasing his Sarmatian foederati (his knights) from service after a long campaign of battling the natives. It's impossible to name who the natives are, because nobody ever pronounced their names clearly - research finally uncovered ""woads,"" but for a long time I thought it was ""vulgs"" or ""wolves"" or ""wrothes.""

 In addition, the Saxons lurk north of a great wall that divides the civilized Roman world in Britain from the barbarian-types. The Saxons are ill defined, looking a bit like Norse Vikings but not actually called Vikings. Which is odd, given that every other character tied to the Arthurian legend IS given his ""proper"" name, even when it makes no sense for said character to have said name.

 Cerdric (Stellan Skarsgard) leads the Saxons, a Really Bad Guy . Or at least, he's supposed to be a bad guy. Instead, he settles for whispering every line in a gravelly voice that's supposed to convince us Cerdric, and indeed all the Saxons, are awful, wicked people who deserve to die.

 With the Saxons on the move and the Woads getting bolder every day, Artorius just wants to go home. If this plot sounds familiar, it's because every semi-historical movie has been trying to capture the success of Gladiator, including mimicking the plot. It doesn't work here.

 Unfortunately, a badly accented Italian bishop comes to deliver news that the knights have one more mission before they will be released back to Rome. It's a rescue mission to a governor's son, who is right in the path of the rampaging Saxons.

 The Saxons are such bad guys that even the Woads, led by Merlin (Stephen Dillane), figure they have a better chance at uniting with the foreign occupation, so they decide to make peace with Arthur against a common enemy. It doesn't hurt that Guinevere (played by a wild-eyed Keira Knightley) improves Roman/Woad relations by sleeping with Arthur. Knightley plays Guinevere with wild-eyed abandon, a supposedly ferocious hellcat who can take out Saxons half-naked and with a thin sword. She simply doesn't have the physical presence to pull it off.

 After rescuing the boy, Arthur and his knights are faced with a difficult choice: leave the land they now call home for a homeland they can barely remember, or fight and probably die to defend their new home.

 There are so many knights who are all scruffy and dark-haired that they blur together. To help distinguish each character, they are given a fighting style and a weapon - none of which strive for even a smidgen of historical accuracy. One knight fights with spiked knuckles, another with two long swords, a third in a rapier style, another with a saber, one with a club, etc. None of this would be a problem if it weren't for the long text intro (and advertising) that proclaims this movie is based on historical fact.

 For reasons that only the writers can explain, Sir Bors (Ray Winstone) is by far the most charismatic character and has the most lines - even more than Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd). Bors was a relatively minor character in Arthurian legend, but apparently his comic relief was sorely needed in a film that takes itself far too seriously.

 Lancelot exchanges glances with Guinevere and there's plenty of jokes implying he's a womanizer, but no romance. Bors talks a lot about his own prowess in bed, his family, and his home. Galahad (Hugh Dancy) and Gawain (Joel Edgerton) argue with each other a lot (and since they're brothers, it often seems like one actor arguing with himself).

 Throughout the story, we discover Arthur is a Christian and his knights are not. But even Arthur thinks a little differently - he follows the teachings of Pelagius, a Celtic monk who believed in free will. When Pelagius is banished excommunicated, Arthur seriously rethinks returning to Rome.

 There's a lot of talk about religion and ethics in the treatment of the Woads, of prisoners, and the knights, but none of it is portrayed with any real emotion. The combat scenes are disjointed, probably to keep the movie to a PG-13 rating. At least Troy had the guts to go for an R rating and show combat in all its gory detail.

 King Arthur has all the horrible attributes of First Knight, barely resembling the myth from which its characters are named. And yet it hides behind the accuracy of supposed historical research, which quickly falls apart upon examination (and watching the History Channel).

 In the end, the most exciting scene is a battle against the Saxons on an ice-covered lake. Good stuff, certainly enough to be entertaining. But it could have been so much more.

 King Arthur is like Troy without Brad Pitt. It has all the will and none of the acting ability, directorial talent, or plot to back it up.",1091059200,8,5636,4.824324324324325
2146277,3,B0002YLCFQ,"I was hoping for better than this.  Set in the fifth century as the Romans were withdrawing from England, Antoine Fugua attempts to set the Arthurian legend in historical context showing Arthur as a Roman knight who fights to save the native Britons from the invading Saxons.

But in doing do, Fugua abandons the powerful archetypes that made King Arthur great and the characters become shallow and the great drama of the Arthurian tale with the love triangle between Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot is only vaguely hinted at.  But most of all, the tale of King Arthur is the story of the triumph of Christianity (as represented by Arthur) over paganism (as represented by Merlin).  In Fuguas Arthur, we find the opposite.  Although Arthur is represented as a conscientious Christian, every other Christian in the movie is presented as a raving lunatic.  And to add insult to injury, Fugua seems to show the triumph of paganism over Christianity, as Arthur and Guinevere are married in a pagan ceremony.

As a history buff, I have a few bones to pick with the movie.  The native Britons are shown as wild savages with blue painted faces.  The fact is that the native Britons had been civilized and Christianized by nearly 400 years of Roman occupation.  The Arthurian legend probably has its genesis in the fact that when Rome withdrew from Britain, they left the native population unarmed and untrained for war.  History seems to point out that perhaps a Roman officer helped these native Britons stem the invading Saxon advance for a short time.  The blue-faced wild men were in fact the Scottish Pics for whom the Roman Emperor Hadrian built his famous wall to prevent them from raiding Roman territory.

I kept wondering why, in the winter battle scenes (by the way, the battle on the frozen lake was pretty good), that the men dressed in full battle armor while Guinevere barely wore anything at all.  By the way, how does a 110 lb woman fight and kill so many 200 lb Saxon warriors?  The obligatory sex scene was over done.  I would be embarrassed to take teenage kids to watch the movie for me.  It added nothing to the movie.

I loved the soundtrack that accompanied the movie also. Clive Owen is unbelievably hot as were the other male actors. Keira Knightley is gorgeous, talented and sensual. She has this amazing smoulder in her eyes. She is one lucky young woman! Great cast! Great cinematography! Of all the movies done on King Arthur this one I will keep on my DVD shelf...the rest will have to go except for maybe ""Mists of Avalon"".",1090972800,9,736,4.713178294573644
2146279,4,B0002YLCFQ,"As I said I would do, due to negative feedback from a past review, I watched the film again, listened to the soundtrack, and am reading the novelization (I also happened to catch an MSN Video interview from Jerry Bruckheimer in regard to the film).

 I have to say, now that I fully understand the context of the film and researching behind the actual Arthurian legend used (the 5th Century, first-account of the legend my a monk whose name I cannot think of now). This was the first account of King Arthur...a King Arthur who at that time had no (full) alliegence to Christianity, since 15th Century re-writing of the legend incorporated Christianity, despite Arthur's alliegence to Rome in the 5th Century

 With that all said and done, I can see where the film is coming from. The film does not have anything to do with the very culturally familiar fiction of ""Sword And The Stone"" or ""Merlin"" feating Sam Niell, which would cause most of us to scold the film...when we were probably told in our childhood something fictitous and he hold that as the fact. King Arthur has no fiction, no magic, no nothing...it's all the raw legend of the 5th Century...the ORIGINAL story (stilghtly adapted to 21st Century in terms of dialogue et al), since each century had their own version of the story.

 This film centers on a period of time when King Arthur, being born in Britian yet showing allegience to Rome, paves the path for his future, and what is now the legend; standing up for what he beleives despite ridicule. The events in the film just happen to be about this one point specifically, and not a whole epic life story as would be expected by the vague title King Arthur.

 The music, performed by the brilliant Hans Zimmer, saves some points of the movie I still have issues with. The vivid use of color, lighting, and scene staging helps as well. I still enjoy Keira Kinghtley's acting, and am growing onto Clive Owen a little more, however he still seemed a bit stale for my liking, however it could be all in the part if one considers Arthur is somewhat in dismay and doesn't have true confidence throughout most of the film.

 All in all, weighing everything again, I was able to get more out of the film and appreciate it much more and like it much better now that I know the context of the story. However, I suggest that all people in my situation at first watch the MSN Video interview with Jerry Bruckheimer since it helps sort things out and actually brings more to the film which ended up being quite good, however it has a bumpy path toward getting great reviews from people unless they do some research into the film's origins.",1090800000,9,2644,4.559071729957806

This is not your typical King Arthur movie. It doesn't focus heavily on Excalibur, Merlin, Guinevere, the Knights, or the relationships amongst them. You'll see the round table but they don't spend time there. It is a story about Arthur and his knights defending its English colony against the invading Saxons and awaiting their freedom from Rome. 'The true story that inspired the legend'.

The characters were interesting, particularly the Saxon leader (Skarsgard) who was cruel and sadistic. Keira Knightley as Guinevere reminded me a lot of Natalie Portman although I never really noticed the resemblance before. I would've liked to see more character development on Lancelot though, as well as Merlin and Arthur.

The dialog at the beginning of the movie is important to your understanding of what is going on. So make sure you don't miss the beginning, or get distracted by the person sitting next to you spilling bubble tea on herself.

2146281,3,B0002YLCFQ,"King Arthur as Roman warlord?  It's possible, but as that plot device is handled in this movie, it doesn't necessarily make for the best story.  Gone are the courtly, courteous knights of Malory and Tennyson, replaced by a troop of surly, pagan horsemen with little to admire in them save their great fighting prowess and their unifying loyalty to Arthur.  Arthur himself is far and away the most charismatic figure, as it should be, and at least he is a Christian (though at times it seems he places as much faith in humanism as he does in God). Guinevere is introduced as a barbarian warrior-woman (and not a particularly likeable one either) and Merlin is reduced to a primitive shaman, but at least we still get Excalibur and the Round Table.  The chilly scenery and cinematography are breathtaking and the combat scenes are powerful, but this is not the legend's best version. Like MISTS OF AVALON and some other modern retellings, this movie succumbs to revisionist agendas that almost always fail (neo-paganism, feminism, etc) and while the result is by no means a failure, it is nonetheless highly disappointing.  Even the argument that this film's departures from legend are justified because this is *the way it really was* doesn't hold water because it's just not true.  For example, Lancelot is featured prominently in the movie (though there is no illicit romance between he and Guenevere) but Lancelot is one of the Arthurian characters who is not based on a real person--he is the fictional creation of French author Chretien de Troyes.  Be that as it may, the problem is not that changes in the legend are made (every storyteller will change the tale to reflect his own vision) but rather how those changes are handled.  Would it have been so hard to make the knights more likeable?  Or to portray Christians as something other than oppressive tyrants (except Arthur, who usually comes across very well)?  I don't think so.  In any event, the core of the legend remains more or less intact, and as an inspirational action movie about fighting for your freedom and never giving up on your ideals KING ARTHUR succeeds more often than it fails.  For Athurian fans I definitely think this film is worth seeing--just don't expect too much.  EXCALIBUR or CAMELOT this is not...",1090800000,27,2287,4.848329048843188
2146292,3,B0002YLCFQ,"As it is the film produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, who gave us Armageddon, Con Air, and Pearl Harbor, you know what you see in King Arther. Historical accuracy? Not a chance. The Round Table? Excalibur? You see them, but not in the way you read or heard. For it is based on a newer, revised idea, which means you get lots of actions, sword fighting, and love. In short, just another over-the-top blockbuster film, and as such King Arther is not bad.

 Now, the surprisingly non-Ameircan cast include Olive Owen as Arther; Keira Knightley as Guinevere; Ioan Gruffudd as Lancelot; Stephen Dillane as Merlin; Stellan Skarsgaard as baddie Cerdic; Ray Winstone as Bors; Hugh Dancy as Galahad; Joel Edgerton as Gawain; Mads Mikkelson as Tristan; and Ray Stevenson as Dagonet.

 The story is nothing you ever have heard in many versions of King Arthur legends. The new story is set against the background of the Roman occupation of Britain in 415 AD. King Arthur is under the command of a Roman priest, who gives Arthur and other knights another and last order to bring back a Roman aristocrartic family safe back from the enemy territory, where the Saxons led by cold-blooded Cerdic are invading.

 Of course, it's a suicide mission, but it sounds a bit familiar, isn't it? Well, the director of this film is Antoine Faqua, who did Tears of the Sun last year, and that's no wonder. Oh, and by the way, the screenwriter of King Auther happens to be David Franzoni, one of the co-writers of Gladiator of which huge success, critically or commercially, must have spawned the new craze for the Ben-Hur type big-scale epic actions, including Troy and a forthcoming one about Alexander.

 To be fair, the actions are done with enough power and convincing fight scenes, without splashing too much blood. At the same time, after watching Gladiator this one may look very tame. And some of the actions cannot help making us feel like, I have seen it before, and if its doesn't, well, you haven't seen Braveheart or Rob Roy.

 I do not complain of the historical things -- anyway, it's legend -- but King Arther challenges our concept about this famous story so gratingly that you may be offended with it. You see no Camelot; Merlin does not use magic; and Guenevere takes us a weapon and shoots arrows, at times with her skins painted blue like one character in X-Men. Some say it's campy, and with good reasons. And as the illicit love with Lancelot is totally gone (hey, it's a family picture), so Gruffudd soon starts to look just like a shadow following her and Arthur.

 If you are not surprised to see the newness of the story, you will be entertained with the actions, or the fights between the good and the evil. But as you know. you can see John Boorman-directed Excalibur which would be a better choice for some.",1090800000,9,2805,4.667342799188641
2146293,4,B0002YLCFQ,"The King Arthur legend, burgeoning from Geoffrey of Monmouth's HISTORY OF THE KINGS OF BRITAIN (12th century) and Thomas Malory's LE MORT DE ARTHUR (15th century), has taken on a life of it own so embellished as to obscure the meager facts known about the 5th century Briton that made an enduring name for himself ostensibly battling the invasion of Germanic tribes. Historians don't even know what part of Britain Arthur hailed from, being variously assigned to Cornwall, Wales, and Scotland. And there's no contemporary historical evidence that he was a king at all. King Arthur has been, and will remain, a conveniently blank page on which Hollywood scriptwriters can pen just about any story they want so long as it includes lots of swordplay, male bonding between noble knights, and a Hot Babe (Guinevere).

In this screen version, Clive Owen plays Arthur, a half-Roman, half-British cavalry commander stationed on Hadrian's Wall at the time the Big House back in Italy decides to abandon the province to the barbarians. The traditional knights of Arthur's Round Table - Lancelot, Bors, Gawain, et al - are Sarmatian warriors at the end of a 15-year conscription into the Roman occupation army. (Sarmatia was an ancient territory way over by the Caspian Sea.) Before gaining possession of their demob papers after years of fighting local Briton insurgents, the knights must accompany Arthur on one last mission, i.e., to rescue a patrician Roman family living north of the Wall whose villa is about to be overrun by an inconvenient horde of Saxon invaders.

This KING ARTHUR is refreshing in that it abandons the silliness of the otherwise excellent EXCALIBUR (1981) which played along with the traditional misconceptions regarding elaborate castle architecture and personal fighting armor that actually didn't arrive in the British Isles for centuries. Here, Arthur isn't even a king, at least until the conclusion. And Guinevere (Keira Knightley) is a pagan Druid found chained-up by Arthur in the cellar torture chamber of the Roman aristocrat, a Christian, that Arthur is sent to rescue. The film's creators take this opportunity to take a swipe at the infant Roman (Catholic) Church by making Guinevere's jailers mad monks. Once released, Knightley's character is either muddy or daubed with Druidic war paint, and dressed in shoulder or midriff-baring costumes totally unsuitable for the cold, snowy weather. No frumpy animal skins for her!

The generally cheesy dialogue and standard battle sequences make this a three-star film, but which I'm elevating to four in consideration of the costuming, however unrealistic, the gorgeous Irish exterior sets, and the occasionally engaging performances of Ioan Gruffudd and Ray Winstone as Lancelot and Bors respectively. Owen is suitably dark and rugged as the driven, charismatic Arthur. And he cuts a fine figure against the skyline mounted on his steed with breastplate, plumed helmet, and streaming cavalry standard. Keira's Guinevere isn't much more than eye candy, though she wields a mean bow and arrow.

If I had to choose between KING ARTHUR and the previously mentioned EXCALIBUR, I'd have to go with the latter, a visually stunning piece of filmmaking up in the five-star category that features superb performances by Nigel Terry as Arthur, Nicole Williamson as Merlin, and Helen Mirren as Morgana, plus a soundtrack to knock your socks off.",1090713600,24,3407,5.223034734917733
2146294,5,B0002YLCFQ,"I really loved this film on so many levels.  First, I for one am glad that the filmmakers decided to get past most of the romanticized chivalry related crap that has been tacked onto Arthurian legend over the centuries, in order to get to the roots of the story of Arthur (well, mostly).  For those who found this confusing, its probably because they are used to the glittery, knightly, courtly stuff they see in most Arthurian related films like First Knight, Excalibur, etc.  But scholars who study Arthur in order to find who the real man might have been would say that most of that was added on by later bards and storytellers to bring Arthur to more relevance in their own time.  Now, granted, the filmmakers who made this movie do the same thing.  King Arthur does try to appeal to modern audiences with wisecracking heroes and Braveheart like action.

But at the center of the film is the core story of who Arthur probably was.  Most Arthurian scholars now believe that King Arthur was a Roman general, possibly of Britanic heritage, who commanded forces in Roman Britain around the time of the fall of the western Roman Empire in 476 A.D.  When the Romans began to pull out of Britain to defend their own home city from Barbarian invasions, the Saxons (a group from another part of Europe) invaded.  Arthur and those forces who remained loyal to him joined forces with the Britons to drive off the Saxon invasion.  Arthur became King, and a time of peace and prosperity came to Britain.  That's the core story.

Now, what about the round table and Camelot and Lancelot and Guinevere?  Most scholars think most of these characters were added by later storytellers, along with Merlin the wizard and Excalibur and the mists of avalon.  Its like telling a fish story.  The fish gets bigger and bigger every time you tell the tale.

What is so brilliant about this film is that it correctly places Arthur in terms of time and place, but at the same time preserves some of the characters and situations of later Athurian myth in such a way that it makes a nice mesh of historical facts (as far as can be determined) and folklore.  This creates a wonderful texture of a time and place in our distant past, and one that is filled with fictional characters that are very interesting and exciting.  The fictional characters themselves are created in such a way that they also belong in that time and place.  Arthur's knights in the film, for example, are Samanian warriors from another part of Europe conquered by the Romans.  They were drafted into the Roman Army for a certain term of service in Rome's provinicial forces, in this case their Britain garrison.  This conscription really did occur in the later Roman imperial period.  What you are really seeing on the screen in a historical context is the death of the Roman world (and the ancient western world along with it) and the birth of the Middle Ages.

Beyond the historical stuff, this is a great action/adventure picture, filled with excellent sword play and medieval archery.  Its very reminiscent of Braveheart in this respect.  I highly recommend this film to everyone.  The reviewers who panned this film are just plain wrong, in my humble opinion.",1090627200,8,3212,4.701252236135957

This non-myth take on the character has Arthur as a Roman Soldier played dully by Clive Owen, who usually seems more alive, who leads a group of men enslaved to Rome until after thir final mission. It is a waste to talk about the characters, as they are not developed and serve no purpose other than to fight. Keira Knightley does well in her small role, but not enough to save this film. The action scenes, outside of a great fight scene on ice that is about to break, is watered down and boring. The characters are boring and it is obvious by the tacked on ending and flow of the film, that they cut out the gritty scenes in favor of a PG-13 action epic- which onlyn Lord Of The Rings can accomplish. The director's cut won't be perfect, but it may make this film pass for good or at least almost good, instead of entertaining crap.",1090627200,3,937,4.329545454545454

2146300,3,B0002YLCFQ,"What would the summer season be without another action-packed adventure flick from Jerry Bruckheimer? Since Top Gun officially deemed him one of the leading producers in the summer of 1986 (though, to his credit, it was Beverly Hills Cop that really kicked his career into high gear), he has revved up the careers of such current super-stars as Tom Cruise (Top Gun and Days of Thunder), Will Smith (Bad Boys and Enemy of the State), Nicholas Cage (The Rock, Con-Air, and Gone in 60 Seconds), and Josh Hartnett (Pearl Harbor) as well as director Michael Bay, with whom he has worked with on five feature films over the years. And don?t think that time has had effect on his ability to keep turning out hits, not only in the theaters but television as well, or his ability to make stars of his films into leading actors and actresses. He hopes to add Clive Owen onto his already extensive list of accomplishments in Hollywood with the historical take on the Arthurian legend.

The story for this telling of the adventures of King Arthur takes away the mythological aspect and place emphasis more on the historical roots that led to the creation of the legend centuries later. Arthur is the leader of a group of loyal knights in the service of the Roman Empire and one who only wishes to finally fulfill his obligation to the Empire and return to the city of Rome to live out the rest of his life in peace. But times have changed; the once great empire that was Rome has become dangerously corrupt and now faces the threat from Barbarian tribes like the Saxons who kill anything and anyone in their way. Those Saxon tribes now have their eyes set on Britannia and Arthur, along with his knights, are sent on one last mission for Rome, which is to bring the favorite godson of the Pope of the Catholic Church to safety. But while accomplishing his final task for the Romans, the realization that the once great center of civilization is gone sets in and Arthur comes to decision that he must take up arms with his former enemies in order to unite the people of Britannia and repel the Saxon force that has invaded their homeland. The story for King Arthur seems rather lifeless and bland when one compares it to the legend on which it is based but taking it for what it is, a historically tweaked version of the story, it is at least a noble effort, if not one that comes off more mediocre then the filmmakers would want. The problem is that Hollywood is devoting too much time and effort into grand historical epics, referring to the lack-luster Troy earlier this year, when they should be putting more thought into bringing the legends to life, not through historical context but through the full-realization of the myths themselves and what they stood for those who heard them.

The feature?s lack of star power is not its primary draw-backs, in fact it?s one of the its better assets, but rather the blame can be transfixed on the script?s undeveloped and, at times, meaningless characters. Clive Owen takes his first leap onto the main stage as the historical equivalent to the legendary King Arthur, known as Arturius, and produces one of the film?s best performances. Despite an exhilarating performance given by Owen, the audience is often left confused as to the just end Arthur is seeking. At one point, he fights for the Romans, but with the empire crumbling and the realization that his utopia doesn?t exist, he shifts course ? if only the filmmakers informed us what that is. Obviously at the end, everything comes together and the goal Arthur was seeking becomes, but unfortunately it comes too late for us to put too much emotional investment in the film?s climatic battle sequence to care all that much. Keira Knightley?s role as Guinevere is another in which there is confusion placed on the movie-goers as to certain actions that are placed around her. For example, what is her exact relationship with the tribal leader Merlin? In one scene she leads Arthur into a clearing in which the tribal leaders comes out to speak to him about the invading Saxons ? Is she his daughter or just a loyal tribal follower? And what was the sole purpose of Ioan Gruffudd?s Lancelot? He?s suppose to be Arthur?s most devoted follower but often he comes off as whiny and too much of annoyance. And is the whole Lancelot glancing at Guinvere every now and again the best the filmmakers could do into incorporating the Guinvere and Lancelot adultery aspect of the myth into this story? It?s not romantic but rather creepy and flat.

Overall, for those who had grown up reading about the legendary King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table, the Jerry Bruckheimer spectacular may come as disappointment, not so much as to the point of echoing Warner Brothers? Troy, but rather for its less attractive approach to the legend. For the less informed individuals of this society not willing to venture to Spider-Man 2 for the twentieth time in a week, King Arthur at least offers itself as a reasonable, if not an inferior, alternative. When Jerry Bruckheimer originally envisioned the film, he had planned on a no-holds barred blood, sweat and tears aspect of the Arthurian legend but unfortunately producers must bend to the whims of their studio masters, in this case Disney (can someone just dump Eisner already?), and so the wonderfully choreographed battle sequences are toned down to the level of PG-13 audiences in order to reap in more box office coin. As one can probably guess, the film, namely its action sequences, suffer severely because of this ? perhaps if they had left out a ?love scene? between Guinvere and Arthur, which, considering their ages (Knightly ? 19, Owen ? 39), comes off as more disturbing then anything else, and the language had been toned down a bit, certain sequences could have been saved. Don?t get the idea that the film?s an utter mess; it?s actually quite decent if one understands the historical context in which the film is placed and isn?t expecting something on the level of Gladiator but more along the lines of the usual Bruckheimer diversion. It?s definitely a disappointment considering the amount of marketing blitz Arthur has been given and Bruckheimer?s 2003 summer hit, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, but if one goes in looking for a simple diversion for the summer, then you won?t come out demanding your money back at least.",1090454400,2,6398,4.741472172351885
2146301,3,B0002YLCFQ,"Being a huge Arthurian nerd, I was really excited about the prospect of a new feature length Arthur movie. However, as is normally the case with Arthurian films, I was disappointed. Not that this one didn't have it's good points, it just lacked in so many other areas. I think the realm of Arthurian literature is too daunting of a task to be done well in a mere two hours.

This one dealt with the new historical assumption that Arthur was actually Arturias (something Like that), a Roman legionnaire assigned to the defense of Britain against the Picts (Scots) to the north. Ultimately Rome collapses and Arturias is left with the decision of whether or not to go home to Germania, or stay with his fellow Legionnaires and defend Britain from an impending Saxon invasion. This might have some basis in historical fact, as there is a 7th century document that refers to Arturias, as well as some achealogical evidence. However, this in of itself does not give credence to the legendary figure of Arthur. Regardless, these inconsistencies are acceptable because it is Hollywood, and therefor expected to tweak things for entertainment purposes.

What I can not accept, however, were the glaring holes within the script, as well as the plot and character development. While there are several Knights, only Lancelot and Bors were adequately developed, the other were elluded to, but left without much more. The script was inconsistent, and could have used a great deal of rewriting. There were parts that dragged, when they could have been simplified and given mroe time to other parts of the movie. Even the battle sequences were uninspired, as they attempted to do too much with the whole, rather than master the parts. I guess I'm spoiled by what we've seen in Braveheart and Gladiator when it comes to epic medieval violence.

This was an entertaining movie, but it just wasn't a must see. It felt like they rushed the production, I can't explain it better than that. I'd say go check out Spiderman 2 and be happy you spent the money, rather than this one.",1090281600,3,2058,4.807909604519774
2146312,4,B0002YLCFQ,"A good movie, if you check your sense of history at the door. This movie takes the premise that the Arthur legend is based on a Roman general, and builds its own story from scratch. Its an engaging story, and the movie is well made, but it should be seen as pure fiction.

 Some quibbles: It has Lancelot in it!. The movie takes place in the 5th century. We know for a fact that Lancelot was added to the legend by the French in the 15th century.

 The movie calls the Northern people ""Woads."" It could just as well have called them Lipsticks or Mascaras. Woad is a blue dye, (or the plant from which it's derived) beleived to have been used as a war paint. I could have swallowed the Northerners being called Picts, but naming them for their cosmetic choice half spoiled the movie for me.

 OK, I can grit my teeth and accept the heros being called ""knights"", although the concept of the knight is several centuries in the future.

 Boadicea nonwithstanding, I'm a little bothered by Guenivere being portayed as a sort of Amazon. (However, being a male with a pulse, I did enjoy her sexy battle armor.)

 All in all, the movie is worth seeing as an action/adventure film, but please don't believe the hype that this is the True Story.",1090281600,17,1235,4.424778761061947

2146314,3,B0002YLCFQ,"Coming off of last year's ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", Disney's hopes had to be high for Jerry Bruckheimer's supposed factual retelling of the Arthur legend in ""King Arthur"".  Instead, they get something that is hit and miss, no doubt in part to a studio mandated editing that turned a n R-rated violent and bloody movie into a PG-13 family affair.
Arthur (Owen), is presented as Arturius, a commander for the Roman empire.  On the brink of gaining freedom for himself and his knights, he rescues Guenivere (Knightley), turns on Rome, and alighns with the Guenivere's people, the Woads.  Eventually, this turn will lead to him becoming the ruler of all the Britons.
This movie is filled with action and fighting, but as I mentioned earlier, it has been toned down and sometimes feels choppy.  Clive Owen does not have enough screen presence or noteriety to carry the role of Arthur.  Kiera Knightley is most likely the only recognizable name in the cast to Americans, and she does not show up until almost halfway through the film.  She also seems to be a little too small to be wielding the swords that she does, especially against some very large men.  I like the idea of Guenivere being a warrior, but perhaps they should have chosen someone that fits the part.
Perhaps I nitpick too much, but this movie for the most part did little for me.  That fault does not lie on any one person's head, and perhaps I will have a different opinion when the R-rated version comes out on DVD, probably this fall.",1090195200,3,1501,4.659090909090909
2146315,4,B0002YLCFQ,"I am open to reinterpreting classic myths and legends in different settings.  For example, it their ""Elseworld"" stories DC comics has retold the familiar origins of Superman and Batman in different time periods: e.g., Superman arrives in the England of the Dark Ages or Batman in the London of Victorian England.  For that matter, ""Camelot 3000"" has Arthur and the knights of his roundtable reincarnated in the year 3000 in time to save England from an alien invasion.  So when ""King Arthur"" wants to locate the ""true story"" of Arthur in the last days of the Roman occupation of Brittania I find that to be an intriguing idea.
The Romans had always found this last outpost of the Empire a problematic area: Hadrian's Wall essentially separates the north (Scotland) from the south (England), trying to keep the Woads (Huh?  We would get the wrong idea if you called these people the Celts?) on the other side of the barrier.  Adding to the incentive to abandon the land is the arrival of the Saxons on the scene who are set on killing everyone and pillaging everything.  In such a land, a man who could become a rallying point against the onslaught of barbarism would be worth remembering.
In David Franzoni's script Arthur (Clive Owen) is the son of a Roman officer and a Briton woman.  Sent to Rome to be educated he returned as Arturius, commander of a garrison on Hadrian's well.  His knights, in a subplot that does come across as a bit forced, are from the land of Sarmatia, far to the west.  When their land was defeated the Romans spared their lives, but bound the knights and their male descendants to 15 years of military service.  Now that period is up and awaiting their honorable discharges (and safe passage throughout the empire) are the last six of the Sarmatia knights who ride with Arthur: Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd), Tristan (Mads Mikkelsen), Gawain (Joel Edgerton), Galahad (Hugh Dancy), Bors (Ray Winstone) and Dagonet (Ray Stevenson).  They just want to go home, but a bishop (Ivano Marescotti) shows up from Rome with one last mission.
The knights go, but it is not for the bishop, because they are all pagans, or for Rome, because they care little for an empire that is abandoning the land their friends died defending, but for Arthur.  The only one who does not seem to know that he is a living legend is Arthur himself; or, if he knows, he neither cares nor believes in the stories.  But Merlin (Stephen Dillane), the holy man  of the Woads respects Arthur as the warrior who can lead men in battle, Cerdic (Stellan Skarsgrd) the leader of the Saxons hears Arthur's name everywhere he goes and finds him the rare man worth killing, and young Guinevere (Keira Knightley) has been raised on fairy tales about Arthur and his knights.  This film is not about King Arthur as much as it is about how Arthur became king in this reimagining of the tale.
Given the context of this telling of the Arthur story it makes sense that the epic love triangle between Arthur, Guenivere and Lancelot is jettisoned.  In many ways that story, which remains the greatest love triangle since it is the husband's wife and best friend, has taken over the Arthurian legend.  Director Antoine Fuqua is really going back to the basics, although in a way that will make most Arthurian scholars cringe.  In this context I like not only turning Guenivere into a Celtic warrior but also that she advocates Arthur's destiny and is not merely a landed lady worthy of marriage.  Besides, there is the nice contrast between Knightley's stately beauty as she fires her arrows and her ferocity as she gets to race across a battle field and win a bunch of sword fights.  You get the feeling she was having the most fun of anyone in this film (I waited patiently for Ioan Gruffudd to do something really impressive with his two swords but they never really came up with anything).
What is interesting given the idea that the Knights of the Round Table were the personification of Christian warriors is how the Church is blamed in the film for the downfall of Rome.  Arthur is a true believer who has taken the teachings of Christianity to the level of the equality of all human beings, while the only other Christians we see in the film are engaging in torture and slavery.  Arthur embodies the best of both Roman and Christian virtues, which makes him a most unique individual, but this film really does some serious retroactive Church bashing.
Yes, there are some problematic elements in this film.  No Roman family, let along one with the Pope's favorite godson, is going to be living beyond Hadrian's Wall in Caledonia (Scotland), and I the ending of the sword fight between Arthur and Cerdic is so trite by this point in movie history it is rather insulting to the audience.  But on balance this is ambitious effort to tell the ""real"" story and there the situation is reasonably well thought out (plus working in bits from classic films like ""The Seven Samurai"" and ""Alexander Nevsky"").  Most importantly, the actors make it believable, even when they have to proclaim rather pretentious dialogue.  The climactic battle scene offers a nice blend of Roman technology and Celtic bravery (I thought the charge of the Woads was a nice representation of the speed of the Celtic attack since they do not bother with armor), and the result, while not a great film, is certainly interesting enough to warrant a look.",1090195200,3,5397,4.714893617021277

2146318,4,B0002YLCFQ,"The best way to watch this film is to not have ANY expectations at all. This movie is memorable, however, is beautifully shot (good cinematography,) has a very realistic feel, and a cast that works very well together.
This is a movie surely worth seeing. It has a very realistic, dark, and medieval feel to it (like it should) and the concept of having the legend of King Arthur become rooted in actual history is both encouraging and believable. It's interesting to see a different spin on the lives of the Arthur and his Knights of the Roundtable...not nearly so glamorous and revered as the popular legend dictates. This is an entirely new way of looking at the whole King Arthur story...other movies in the past have only related to the legend aspect of it.
Another good point about this film is the cast and the acting. The acting is believable. I really hate it when bad actors are placed in roles the director thinks they might be good in, but only puts them in the film because of how popular of an actor he/she is. Thank God for the actors in this movie...nothing is over-dramatized or over-acted. Everything is done very realistically, as if these men/women truly are whom they are portraying. The cast was well chosen and while many of the actors are not well enough known, I do feel this movie should promote their careers.
Now to the few bad points of this movie. It's tough to go and watch films like this because after you've seen movies within this genre you are always comparing it against the others. While this movie does have some intense battle action and good old-fashioned violence, viewers may feel disappointed if they were expecting something more. This really isn't the film's fault, however, it's just that there have been better films of this type already done.
Also, some reviewers have mentioned the directing as being a downfall of this movie. I would have to agree...this movie had a lot more potential by way of detailing the characters a bit more...like focusing on the emotional aspects of each character and really allowing the great cast to get into their character. There were hints of that here and there, but I sat there feeling like I needed more from them sometimes...I think that alone would have made entertainment critics like this film a lot more.
Do not have any expectations with this film and take it as its own. I feel bad that it has not been given enough trailer time on television, and I think part of the reason many people may not go to see this film is because of all the other summer hits that are coming out at the same time. I've also read some bad reviews about this film, and while some of them have good points, only you can really decide whether or not this movie is worth seeing. My advice is to pay for a matinee show if you can...the regular show time prices are a bit steep for me considering this movie isn't of epic quality...you may be disappointed if you paid a lot, expected more, and left feeling a bit empty.
Final thoughts: Good movie, worth seeing at a matinee price, and just remember not to expect anything and to let this movie be what it is on its own...don't compare it to others! : )",1090022400,,3166,4.536713286713287

The movie proves to be very entertaining, action packed and amazingly for a movie of this type, well acted. The pace is pretty even and there's a good story to the film, story of courage, loyalty and honor; three virtues on which this movie ultimately rest its soul on.
The movie don't do well if you really have to think deep. The fine story wasn't supported by a fine script, that much must be made clear. Some of the other reviewers have already pointed out some of the major flaws of the movie, biggest one I thought was that dumbo Roman family in distress plot. What was Antoine Fuqua thinking when he okay this??
But I thought the negatives were outweight by the positives. The actor who played that Saxon leader proves to be very good. I wish there were more scenes with him in it. Clive Owen held his own, Keira Knightley went from helpless girl in muck to Amazon bow-woman. Actually, she wasn't bad at all.  I think these ""Woad"" were nothing more then Picts of ancient Britain. Merlin seem to be more of a druid leader type but his role in this movie is very limited.
If any of you out there who read this, be warn that there is no Camelot, no knights in shinning armor and no love triangle in this movie. Its your basic sword and armor movie based during the period when the Western Roman Empire was disappearing from history.",1089936000,2,1493,4.468864468864469
2146331,1,B0002YLCFQ,"This movie actually saddened and sickened me with its blatant anti-Christianity.
The Sarmatian information was interesting, but ""slightly"" (snort) inaccurate (since the Saramatian troops were settled in Lancashire in Ribchester during the reign of Marcus Aurelius much earlier than the 426-450 ad or thereabouts that this would have taken place.....and that there were about 5,500 of them.  Genetic studies show that their DNA is still floating about Britain... as is some Roman DNA from around Hadrian's Wall).
However, what got me was the shabby treatment Christianity got.  Having Arthur as a Pelagian Heretic who knew Pelagius (a British monk who spent most of his time in the Mediterannean)was disturbing, but not necessarily inaccurate.  It's possible since Bishop Germanus was actually sent to Britain from Gaul (not Rome...he was Gaulish not Italian the way the movie seemed to imply...hence he was at least part Celt himself) to stamp out (by argument and persuassion)the Pelagian heresy which was rampant in the British Church at the time.  Bishop Germanus was St. Germain (Germanus) of Auxerre.  He was the mentor of St. Patrick of Ireland (remember him?). St. Germanus was not responsible for the death of Pelagius.  Pelagius was not executed at all. His ideas were condemned by the Church(actually Pelagius teching was not as bad as the ""Pelagians"" who followed him).  Here is an example from the Venerable Bede as to the character of St. Germanus:  When a joint Pictish (woads?  Possible since they were from North of Hadrian's wall.) and Saxon army (wait a minute, they were allies then?) were attacking the Britons in Wales, a newly baptised (still wet behind the ears:))army asked St. Germain to lead them.  He agreed.  He and his brother bishops set themselves up in an ambush, and since it was Easter began to chant Alleluia loudly.  Soon the whole army took up this chant.  Their voices resounded so greatly (it was a Welsh Choir after all) that it seemed that the rocks and trees and hills were singing too.  The Saxons and Picts were so terrified that they fled, dropping armor and weapons as they went so as to lighten their load.  This bloodless victory is known in Welsh History as the Alleluia Victory.  Wouldn't it have been really beautiful to have had that as part of this story?  No, they had to make a peaceful Saint into a conniving disdainful puppet of Rome.
To those who have pointed out the many sins of the various Christians who were acting almost 1000 years later (and who besmirched the record of St. Constantine who was earlier), the conversion of Britain was relatively peaceful.  The period we are talking about did not have the kinds of persecutions that occurred later.  Why bring in the treatment of Native Americans... over 1000 years later.  It's a non sequiter here.  This movie was just anti-Christian.  And so are some of the reviewers, it appears.",1089936000,19,2898,4.956521739130435
2146332,4,B0002YLCFQ,"From what I read in the papers, this movie cost Disney something like $150 mil to make (correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that more than the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy?), (and has been losing money) - but you'd never guess that from seeing the movie.  There are no epic battles, no exotic locales, no breath-taking scenery - Antoine Fuqua is no Peter Jackson.  It makes me wonder where the lion's share of the money went - perhaps into the pockets of the Producer and Director?
This movie is merely Very Good, but it's not an epic - which is sad considering the money spent.  I still recommend King Arthur - the sets (what few there are) are excellent, as are the acting, makeup and costumes - just don't expect The Lord of the Rings.",1089936000,,741,4.355072463768116
2146333,1,B0002YLCFQ,"I truly love the King Arthur legends, and different takes on them do not really bother me...they're legends after all, they're supposed to be interpreted.  I've always pictured the Aurthur legends set in the dark ages (perhaps from reading Mary Stwart and The Mists of Avalon) and it seems more likely that if such a person as Arthur existed, it would have been then.  Loose interpretation of a myth, however, does not excuse this movie.
Good heavans, where do I start?  The plot is jumbled, apparently the knights whose names, at least, are recognizable, come from Samaria and follow a half Briton named Arthur, whose status as a half-Briton seems to be added about two thirds of the way through the movie as an afterthought.  The film opens with a lot of reading about how this movie is historically accurate and them some voice overs and then some lovely shots of knights riding, one of the few things that is well done about this movie.  Apparently Arthur and his knights need to escort some Bishop to Hadrian's Wall (don't ask me why)who sends them on one last mision.  Of course, no one bothers to explain why this Roman aristocrat that they're sent to escort to safety is living beyond Hadrian's wall in so called Woad territory.
Have I forgot to mention the Woads?  Apparently the woads are the British natives, lead by Merlin, a blond hippie with a dirty blue face who has about thirty seconds of screen time.  Every so often they attack good Arthur for no reason, and later try to guilt trip him into saving them from the Saxons who for some reason are invading from the North.  Along the way, we find out that Rome is corrupt, Christians suck, and that the Saxon leader played by Stellan Skarsgard is really having a good time whispering cheesy badguy lines like ""Burn everything...kill everybody.""
Oh yeah, and Arthur finds Guinevere.  Why is it that whenever Hollywood wants to make a 'strong female character' they turn her into a man?  While Arthur is muttering his hollow, twentieth century Braveheart lines about 'freedom' Guinevere is berating him because her people (the Woads) need a leader and he who is half Briton himself fights against them.  The two have utterly no chemistry and for some reason they decided to utterly ditch the love triangle, one of the most important themes of the story...there's no possibility for it either, if you watch the movie you'll see why...but back to Guinevere...if her being an obnoxious shrew isn't enough, they have to turn her into a 'warrior' as well.  And give her some Hollywood feminist lines that wind up completaly out of tune with the supposedly period movie.  And don't even get me started on her final battle costume...my only question is...what would happen if she...well...popped out?
I enjoyed the interactions between the knights, and unlike many, I did not find them particularly interchangable.  Arthur, however, was another matter.  He was dull, boring, and so completaly lacking charisma that it was simply impossible to understand why, exactly, everyone was so devoted to him.  I especially liked the scene where he hollored up at the sky to god...or the director...""Why?  It was supposed to be me!""  At which point one is thinking...""good heavans, I wish it were...""  Give me Braveheart, give me Gladiator, give me Monty Python for goodness sake...anything but this.",1089849600,15,3346,4.867724867724868

The action scenes weren't too great, and apart from the scene on the frozen lake I didn't enjoy them too much. I thought the movie would tell the true tale of King Arthur, but it didn't. Lancelot and Guinevere weren't lovers, Arthur and Guinevere got married(what?! aren't they supposed to be siblings?). Merlin didn't play a very big part in the movie either.

2146336,1,B0002YLCFQ,"NOTE: This movie is NOT based on the Arthurian legends.  So, if you're looking for a movie that is based on the legends, watch ""Excalibur.""

In all fairness, the opening credits do state that the movie is based on historical belief, rather than the legends, of who ""Arthur"" really was -- a British chieftain who lived in the 500's A.D.  What's troubling is that if the movie is based on ""history"" -- why then does the movie still incorporate characters found in the legends (Merlin, Guinevere, Lancelot, Tristan, Bors, and even the Round Table)????

The acting?  Well, it's average.  Clive Owen (Arthur) does the job, as does Keira Knightley (Guinevere) -- though the fact that she weighs about 90 pounds yet we're expected to believe, historically, that she's a fierce British warrior fighting alongside the men is very hard to swallow.

The screenplay? Could have (nay, MUST have!) been written by a child.  There are constantly corny lines like: ""Burn all the villages, kill everyone"" that caused many in the movie theatre to laugh out loud.

The only enjoyable aspect of the film is Stellan Skarsgard, a very underrated, Swedish-born actor who plays the Saxon chief.  However, the audience is distracted by the childish screenplay in which Saxons are the clear villains while the Britons are the good guys, with no gray in between.  Very elementary.  There is nothing in history attesting to Saxons being the ""bad"" guys but... seeing as how they are German and Hollywood NEVER passes up the chance to rip into Germans, it wasn't surprising that the audience is subjected to a ""Saxons are evil"" screenplay.

The battle scenes are short, confusing and lack enough dramatic action, while the plot development is puzzling and the film ending abrupt.

Another aspect of the movie that will bother many audience members is its shockingly anti-Christian theme.  This is particularly ironic in a movie that draws elements from the intensely-Christian Arthurian legends (legends where knights attend mass daily, carry crosses on their shields, and seek the Holy Grail).  Here are a few examples of anti-Christian scenes from the film:

1) The first priest we encounter in the film is blatantly homosexual (looks and mannerisms), perpetuating the stereotype that all priests are; 2) The next 'man of the cloth' we meet is a bishop sent from Rome who is a cruel, cunning liar; 3) The only two other holy men in the film are murderers. We meet these two lovely lads in a scene where Arthur breaks down a sealed doorway at a Roman nobleman's home, only to discover several corpses of tortured men, women, and children who have been tortured by two priests for refusal to renounce their pagan beliefs;  4) The Roman nobleman defends the two holy men's actions, telling Arthur: ""You're a Christian!  You should understand!""  Again, people laughed out loud in the theatre at this line.  So now Christianity means torturing and starving to death children who don't convert?  Nice job, Hollywood.  Apparently, producers can't get enough of bashing Christianity;  5) Arthur is the only Christian of the knights (bizarre in a film that incorporates characters from the legends, like Lancelot, while omitting these characters' intensely Christian beliefs).  Even Arthur is wobbly on Christianity.  He later learns that his hero, Pelagius, a philosopher, ""has been burned in Rome as a heretic for preaching that all men are free.""  Now, Arthur's already-shaky beliefs in the Church are shattered.  What a joke.  Actually, a ""Pelagius"" did exist but he was never burned as a heretic by the Church nor did he ever preach men were born free.  In the end of the film, Arthur indirectly renounces Christianity and marries ""pagan"" Guinevere in a ""pagan"" ceremony.  (Sir Thomas Mallory must be rolling in his grave!);  6) Sir Bors -- the most ""likeable"" character because he serves as the film's comic relief -- grabs the priest's crucifix and mocks it in an opening scene.  He jokingly holds the crucifix, looks up to the sky, and asks for rain.  When none comes, he berates the priest, telling him that a crucifix means nothing.  Such mocking of ANY religion in a film MIGHT be acceptable if Sir Bors were to later retract his sentiments or the film somehow showed another side but, of course, this never happens.  The scene, a testament to Hollywood's prejudice against Christianity, stands on its own, unretracted.

I do not recommend this film on any account.  Even if the anti-Christian propaganda and prejudice does not bother you, you will be gravely disappointed with the screenplay and plot development.  It is an utter waste of two hours.",1089849600,33,4624,4.971354166666667
2146337,3,B0002YLCFQ,"And it should be on video pretty quick.  I know how historically inaccurate this attempt was, and if you have read any of the reviews here, so do you.  What makes this so mediocre is the fact that no one in the cast distinguishes themselves until well into the film.  I got Arthur and Lancelot confused the first few times I saw them.  Neither of the main actors for Arthur and Lancelot are household names.  Sometimes this tactic of using unknown actors works and feels fresh, like the young kids who were so great in That Thing You Do!, Tom Hanks' directorial debut.  Here, however, it would have been a good decision to have a bigger name than Keira Knightley as the main star.  The story is okay, but nothing you haven't seen before.  The battle scenes are well done, but pretty much all war movies these days have great effects.  This is the age of great computer effects.  So the war scenes won't blow anyone away.  In short, this is a moderately entertaining two hours plus that had it never been made, would never have been missed.",1089763200,2,1039,4.473404255319149
2146338,1,B0002YLCFQ,"As a student working on my MA in English Litertature (specializing in early medieval), I've trained myself not to worry too much about historical innacuracies in film as long as the movie is entertaining. However, the fact that the film makers claim that this is the ""real"" story of Arthur makes its signifigant inaccuracies unforgivable. The inaccuracy that I have the biggest problem with is setting the battle of Badon Hill at Hadrian's Wall. Even though the exact location of the battle is still debated, it's certainly much further south than Hadrian's Wall, otherwise it would have been called ""The Battle of Hadrian's Wall."" Arthur is the only character who has any sort of historical counterpart; to claim other characters, some of which not appearing in the legends until centuries later, is not in the least part of the ""true"" story. Also, the Saxons never made any signifigant incursions into Scotland, they were originally invited over as mercenaries by the native Britons to help fight the Romans and each other. Eventually they turned on their employers and took what is now England for themselves. There are so many more major issues I could go into, but I only have so much space, so on to the movie itself.
I could look past most of the innacuracies if this movie was entertaining. However, ""King Arthur"" stinks! All the ""knights"" (there were no knights in the technical sense until the late 11th century) save Bors are practically indistinguishable. They look the same and they all have the same personality. Arthur has zero charisma. We are never given any reason to care about any of these characters. They merely go from point A to B to C because they have to in order to enact the plot.
Speaking of the plot, it is disjointed in the sense that this movie lacks a coherent narrative structure, and it is flat-- there are no convincing emotional highs or lows. I could have left the theatre any time during this movie and not have worried about what I missed.
There is also a lack of emotional complexity in the film. Everything is either good or evil. The Saxons are portrayed as a mob of men who just like being evil. Athur is good just for good's sake. All the talk about freedom is lifted straight from ""Braveheart.""
Overall, ""King Arthur"" makes ""Excalibur"" look like ""Citizen Cane"" in comparison.
If you want to see a good Arthurian flick, here is my list of suggestions:
1. Perceval
2. Lancelot du Lac
3. The Knights of the Round Table

4. Monty Python and the Holy Grail

2146339,5,B0002YLCFQ,"But one I still loved.  I guess you have to be a huge fan of the arthur mythos to like all the different books and movies about it, with different take and different perspective and such.  I am and I also read horrible review for this movie.  But I love thios subject and hate reviewers and critics, so I went and saw it anways.  I loved this new version.  Arthur and his knights being forced to work with the romans.  Merlin being the leader of the Woads (the group of tribal outcast people) and whoever the actor was that lead the Saxon army was very well done.  The battle on the lake was really good and pretty intense, with the ice threatening to break with every step and the huge battle at the end with the alliance of the Romans and the Woads leaving a very confused and evenutally dead saxon army.  Plus Arthur's Marriage to a very young and attractive (especially in her war paint!) Guineverre.  This is actually the very first version of Arthur's legend where I don't despise Guinevere.  I loved her in this movie, although I thought Lancelot took her place as the nagging wimp.  But the other knights were great, especially Gawain.
If you're a huge fan of these myths and want to welcome a change and a less myth-based version, see it.  If you are not a fan, don't bother.  Try reading Le Morte Darthur or The Mists of Avalon if you want more myth-based stuff.  Fun movie!",1089676800,4,1384,4.397637795275591
2146340,2,B0002YLCFQ,"Whatever this movie is about (and I'm not quite sure, it is very confusing), it is not about King Arthur. If you have even the remotest notion of what the Arthurian legends are about, please dismiss them before watching this movie, because you will otherwise spend the entire time saying things like ""No WAY!"" and ""Wha?"" and other rude things.
Let's get to the point: There is no Excalibur, no Morgan Le Fey, no Camelot. Arthur, who is broodingly played by Clive Owen, eminently forgettable in the role, has no visible means of income, but has a Round Table that could be the pride of any hip New York decorator. The Knights reminded me of nothing so much as Robin Hood's Merry Men, from their looks to their ribald jousting--I kept forgetting what movie I was watching.
And then there is Guinevere. I adore Keira Knightley, and she did look so pretty, and so very fierce--but excuse me: She fights in battle beside her man (a nod to modern-day political correctness, one assumes), even when no other woman fights. While her comrades in arms dress appropriately for battle in animal skins and armor and heavy protective garb, she fights in two strategically placed straps over her (ahem) chest. And while nobody else is painted blue, she has taken the time in the forest before this pivotal battle to paint blue and interesting symbols all over herself (drawing attention to key assets).
The leader of the Saxons looks exactly like Willie Nelson, complete with gray braided hair, and his son, who inexplicably has a brush cut (but did braid his beard), looks like Beckham.
OK, go see if it you must. The battle scenes, especially the one on the cracking ice, are great. The acting is strangely uninspired, to match the brooding monochromatic camerawork. Keira does her energetic and enthusiastic best as a warrior, and she is too likeable to diss, even in a movie this bad.",1089676800,6,1873,4.748466257668712

Troy was a good appetizer for Braveheart fans who wanted more, but this movie may make some feel like they should have skipped dessert. King Arthur doesn't just lack emotion of past epics, but also finds itself being far too political and too cliche. I'm sure I wasn't the only one who noticed the unsubtle pokes at religon and prisoner abuse.
King Arthur is worth a look. Stellan Skarsgaard does an amazing job as the evil Saxon leader, but one person can't save an entire movie. Mature movie fans might leave the theater feeling that their intelligence was just insulted. I wouldn't disagree...

2146353,2,B0002YLCFQ,"Clive Owen plays the title role in KING ARTHUR, and the King here is the leader of a group of knights patrolling 5th century Britain on behalf of an increasingly decadent Roman Empire. Arthur feels loyalty Rome, but there's been quite a bit of fiddling going on during Arthur's 15 years of servitude, and Rome is not the same city he left behind. The rest of the knights, including Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd) and Bors (Ray Winstone), just want to get the heck out of Britain and go home.
The action of KING ARTHUR occurs just at the handover, if you will, as Romans prepare to vacate Britain. The Saxons (led by Stellan Skarsgard) are invading from the North, with a sort of destroy-this-country-in-order-to-save-it philosophy of warfare. The native Britons are led by Merlin (Stephen Dillane, underused) and Guinevere (a strident Keira Knightley) -- they live in the forest, have lots of cool weapons, great skin, and really enjoy the music of Phish. The Brits are Arthur's enemies at first, but they soon ally against the Saxons in a overlong and bloody final battle. There's one great action scene on a frozen lake, but much of this movie is very heavy going, with lots of debates about religion, duty, nationalism, etc.
As for the acting, Owen can't defeat dull writing, Knightley is appealing although humorless, Skarsgard looks bored, and the rest of the overqualified cast is underused. The Arthur-Guinevere-Lancelot triangle is completely discarded. Overall, a bit on the disappointing side.",1089590400,5,1497,5.016064257028113
2146354,4,B0002YLCFQ,"We as a culture tend to become so enamored with The Legend of King Arthur that we lose sight of one crucial word:  Legend.  First penned a thousand years after the real King Arthur supposedly lived, the legend--with its sweeping depictions of Camelot, wizards, the Lady of the Lake, a forbidden love--has transcended reality.  So, when a new interpretation of Arthur is presented that has none of the above, it's a bit jarring, and forces the viewer into somewhat of a discomfort zone.  Which, to me, is the beauty of Jerry Bruckheimer's new epic, KING ARTHUR, a handsome film that usurps the legend to tell the story of a man who was able to unite an island under siege.
The producers of this film make the case that the original Arthur was a Sarmatian warrior with an allegiance for Rome, a man by the name of Lucius Artorius Castus.  In the sixth century, as Rome was preparing to abandon the Isle of Briton and leave its native tribes defenseless against the invading Saxons, Artorius--also known as Arthur--is given one more task to perform before Rome will grant him and his knights freedom from military service:  rescue a Roman noble family trapped behind Saxon lines.  The quest is daunting--almost suicidal--yet the prospect of freedom is alluring to a group of seven knights weary of battle, even though they are uncertain what to do once freedom is obtained (go back to their ancestral homeland, or remain in Briton?).  The subsequent story is riveting, as Arthur and his dwindling band of knights forge an uneasy alliance with the native Woads (led by Merlin and Guinevere) to take on the ruthless and bloodthirsty Saxons.
Clive Owen is believable and sincere in the title role; the supporting cast, including Ray Winstone, Stellan Skarsgard, and Ioan Gruffudd, gives stellar performances.  The four-star rating, unfortunately, has to do with the film's one glaring weakness:  the character Guinevere (Keira Knightly).  Depicting this character as a scantily-clad, green-painted, fierce Xena clone is absolutely laughable, and seriously undermined the credibility of the rest of the story.  Yet this irritant is easily forgiven, based on the overall scope and feel of this epic--an epic that explores the origins of a legend.

Plot was minimal. Dialogue tended to feel contrived. Cinematography was so-so. This was more or less a hack-and-slash quasi-histo-drama that failed to produce a significant amount of emotion for me personally.
I thought Clive Owen was very well cast as the lead character, but beyond that the roles became fairly 2-dimensional pretty quickly.
All the same, this was an 'interesting' film, as I've seen noted often in other reviews, if for no other reason than its fresh take (with or without a shred of evidence to support it) on the very popular legend in question. More so than the questionable take on the Arthurian material, I found the treatise on the decline of Roman civilization to be very rewarding and thought-provoking.
Perhaps the strongest element of the film was the sound track, for those who enjoy 'new age,' celtic-influenced music such as that performed by Enya and Clannad. Hope to pick up a copy soon and perhaps explore more work by Moya Brennan.",1089590400,3,1150,4.902564102564103

2146358,5,B0002YLCFQ,"I thoroughly enjoyed this new version of ""King Arthur,"" a rousing adventure based on Arturius Castus whom most historians believe is the basis of the legendary King Arthur.  The film received mixed reviews from critics and yet I and the audience that I saw it with obviously enjoyed it.  I will think twice before giving critics' reviews my notice after they've showered an incredibly boring and torpid ""Lost in Translation"" with rave reviews and yet panned this enormously entertaining film.  It is definitely a much better film than the critics are giving it credit for.
Don't expect to see this film and find a movie reminiscent of ""Mists of Avalon"" or ""Excalibur."" After all, this story doesn't take place in medieval times but instead the last days of the Roman rule of England (456 AD).  It is based more on the historical Arthur than the stuff of myth and legend.  This film has more in common with ""Gladiator"" and the rousing warfare and swordplay found in films like ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Braveheart.""  If you leave the baggage of your Arthurian preconceptions at home (no Lady of the Lake, Avalon or sorcery) then you will find an entertaining film full of wit, grit, action and grandeur.
The film has many highlights which is to say that it doesn't have some minor flaws.  The flaws - to me - have more to do with editing than anything else.  One gets a sense that some bits and pieces were cut to give this film a PG-13 rating and even director Antoine Fuqua has already mentioned that we will see more intense fighting on the dvd. And as much as I like Stellan Skarsgard (Cedric), he makes for a lukewarm villain.
Any flaws, however, are overshadowed by the many highlights of this film: the fine and attractive cast, beautiful cinematography, gritty realism, fantastic action set pieces, intelligent and often witty dialogue and Hans Zimmer's haunting score.  Even though the actors are made to look like well-worn soldiers with longish hair and sometimes bearded faces, it is hard not to notice the good looks and charisma of actors like Croupier's Clive Owen (Arthur), Horatio Hornblower's Ioan Gruffudd (Lancelot), Daniel Deronda's Hugh Dancy (Galahad), Ray Stevenson (Dagonet) and Pirate of the Caribbean's Keira Knightley (Guinevere).  Add to this the fine performances and great swordsmanship and you are - whether male or female - in for a treat.  There are some lighthearted moments and clever wordplay courtesy of characters like Gawain (Joel Edgerton from ""Star Wars: Attack of the Clones"")and Bors (the prolific Ray Winstone), the most rough and tumble of the knights.  An audience favorite, Bors reminds me of LOTR's Gimli, a tough and cantankerous warrior with a warm heart and a killer sense of humor.  I had initial reservations about Clive Owen carrying such a high-profile role but he does his job wonderfully.  He is honorable and heroic, charismatic and noble.  Keira Knightley shines in yet another star-making role, proving once and for all that she is a gifted actress who succesfully blends femininity with physical strength.
In short, ""King Arthur"" is a much better film than it is being given credit for.  The battle scenes are some of the best ever filmed and there are some light, funny moments and also moments that move you to tears.

The action is great except for the ice battle, which is definetly not the best part of the movie because its too short and all that happens is they shoot some arrows and then one of the knights runs out and breaks the ice and they fall in.  The last battle is very impressive though, much better, with great choreography.  The performances are good and deserve a few nominations, mainly clive owen.  The drama is affective but we could use a little more info on some of the characters, arthur mainly.  I would nominate the movie for best picture, but i think troy might win, unless alexander is good.  I give it a 9 out of a 10.

2146360,4,B0002YLCFQ,"Was it really King Arthur that fascinated so? His charisma, born from a purity and goodness of spirit seldom seen, and his loyalty to both friend and cause was admirable. But, perhaps, too perfect as to be unreasonable? In this adaptation of Arthur and his Knights, that is certainly so. Because you feel nothing for him and all for his Knights.
It usually does not bode well for a film when the title character can't carry his role. Clive Owen seemed vaguely familiar to me in the trailers, but I couldn't place where I had ever seen him before. Knowing the legend since a very young age and growing up with an ideal of Arthur, I must say that Owen did not fulfill any of my criteria for the great King. The charisma mentioned above was lacking. I was struck by the frequency with which Owen displayed a blank face. He was being told that his Knights, men who had fought for a nation in which they did not believe for 15 long years, would not earn their freedom until they risked one further impossible mission, and he sat there, staring off into space. It was like he was rather dull or, I hate to say it, dumb. There was no spark. Not even when Guinevere, her dress slipping from her shoulder, offered herself to him. King Arthur was an emotional being, but there was very little in Owen's bearing to show that. The most compelling characters for me were Lancelot and Tristan. I was thrilled to see Ioan Gruffud's name brought up when this project was filming and I was even happier to note that he had been given a central role. Wonderfully expressive, Gruffud's Lancelot brought the emotion and depth in his character to the fore. And the charisma that was lacking in Arthur was evident in the quiet Tristan who, from the moment he steps down from his horse in the first of the battles, catches your attention.
Perhaps what got under my skin the most was that those responsible for the film and script took it for granted that you would know the legend and therefore not care about what they no doubt considered exposition. Snippets of Arthur's history are woven into the narrative and shown briefly in flashback. It's a far more realistic take on his origin and, though appreciated, it isn't nearly enough. And what's worse, we are to understand the strength and breadth of the friendship and brotherhood that was forged between the Knights on face value alone. How awful. A bond such as theirs deserves so much more. I am fully aware of the legend, but that doesn't mean that I don't want to see it, that it isn't just as moving the hundredth time it's told or shown. Every time Arthur said to Lancelot, ""You who knows me best,"" I couldn't help but sigh in frustration. The audience could barely get to know any of them on any kind of level, so how could we buy that they knew each other so well? Aside from the humor shared between the men, where was the evidence? It really gyps someone who isn't as knowledgeable and who wasn't raised on the story. Another very minor complaint I had was in regards to the presentation of history. If someone, like my companion, didn't have a fairly solid grip on history or a sense of place as it was years upon years ago, the Saxons, Romans and Merlin's men may start to blur together. By no means do they need to hold the audience's hand, and, to a point, they deserve some credit for not believing us stupid, but still. There were a lot of younger viewers there and it would have been nice to put a bit more history in with the battle. (And battles abounded. They took up nearly all of the movie. In fact, they seemed to favor action over historical politics and the subtleties of human interaction and emotion.)
I suppose after all that it would seem as though I didn't enjoy the movie. But that's far from the truth. Though I am sure that I could have felt much more involved in the story if other elements had been involved, the time passed by quickly and I left smiling. I would recommend it, but tack on an advisement: Don't expect too much, especially if you're a fan of the legend in any form.",1089504000,,4047,4.4481830417227455

But call it ""King Arthur"" and everyone expects to find magical wizards, and love triangles... maybe even fantastic gumdrop trees. But you know what, King Arthur is kind of like Sasquatch; there's not much, if any, historical proof of who or what he was.  Mostly, he's a story handed down through the centuries.  What proof we DO have is that he was pretty much the kind of guy depicted in this movie.

2146363,3,B0002YLCFQ,"Much like Troy tried to do Greek myth without the gods, so does KING ARTHUR do the Arthurian legends without all the magic. The only trouble with taking the magic and myth out of these stories is the magic and myth is what makes them so appealing! However, KING ARTHUR does a much better ""real"" portrayal than TROY ever did.
A good way to put the film KING ARTHUR in perspective is with another period film, GLADIATOR. Many people are familiar with this epic film and the stunning opening scene where the Roman army, led by Russel Crowe, wages war on Germanic tribes. Fiery arrows fly. Mud soaked savages battle Roman legions. Well, KING ARTHUR is an entire movie of that; it's a movie of that opening scene from GLADIATOR. But with hot chicks.
Now, this isn't a slight at KING ARTHUR at all. That opening scene of GLADIATOR was truly great. However, KING ARTHUR tries to be truly great, but falls a bit short. For one there are no ""big stars"" like Russel Crowe in KING ARTHUR. Lancelot and Arthur are unknowns and these key rolls lack that extra umph better known actors could have brought to such well known characters. In fact, as any one who has seen the movie posters already knows, the only ""star"" in the movie is Guinevere, played by up-and-coming ingenue Kiera Knightley.
Knightley steals the movie as Guinevere. In fact, you think KING ARTHUR's uber-producer Jerry Bruckheimer probably would've changed the name of the movie to GUINEVERE if he could have.
Bottom line is KING ARTHUR is a pretty good period action movie. It's an interesting interpretation of who King Arthur might've ""really"" been. But lackluster casting, no real character development, and straying from what makes the Arthurian legends, well, legend, keep KING ARTHUR from being a great movie like Braveheart or Gladiator. KING ARTHUR is a decent popcorn movie worthy of your theater dollars on a rainy afternoon. Just don't go expecting magic.",1089504000,2,1922,4.809667673716012
2146364,4,B0002YLCFQ,"I didn't expect much from this film, as many of the reviews were so-so, (though Roger Ebert gave it a ""B"" grade on Yahoo!) but I was pleasantly surprised! And it wasn't just me...our audience actually applauded in appreciation at the end of the film. I live in the San Francisco Bay area, and so it was a somewhat sophisticated audience that doesn't react that way very often.
The film is not as dark as portrayed in the professional reviews that I have read--they all say that it's gloomy. Well, frankly, the latest Harry Potter movie was a lot more gloomy (and I am a HP fan). This film had some issues but within it's premise was fairly consistant...very few of those moments when things got so bad that I felt like saying something like, ""you've got to be kidding me!"" to the director and writers. That is seldom true for me these days in films. It did have a few moments with bad dialogue-- and unfortunately most of the time with Ms. Knightley's lines (and problems about her costumes!). But the characters and actors were engaging, you cared what happened to them, and I really liked the fact that all of the knights had their own distinct personalities. The battles were involving enough to sustain the story for me, and I am not a big action fan and can get bored with such things, so that was a surprise. I liked this movie, and unlike several (including Troy) that I have seen this summer, I didn't feel like a had just paid to waste 2 hours of my life. Clive Owen and all of the cast were very watchable.
Not a fabulous film, but *much better* than the reviewers said. Give it a try.",1089504000,8,1595,4.410169491525424
2146365,3,B0002YLCFQ,"This movie was yet another retelling of the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table.  It had an unusual angle to the familiar story, and a lot of potential that I believe it just didn't live up to.  But wait, isn't this a kind of foolproof, proven winner?  Well...
What I liked:
it was a grittier, more historically plausible interpretation of the King Arthur legend than anything filmed before.  The chaos of the battle scenes was nicely done.  There was nothing mystical or magical mixed up in there.  The main characters were very flawed humans with their own stories:  Merlin was a prominent leader, perhaps a Druid, but not a wizard; Arthur was a conflicted half-British, half-Roman noble who learned egalitarian values and cared deeply for his pagan comrades; and all the knights of the Round Table were foreign men eager to leave the service of the Roman Empire once their 15 year tour of duty was up.  I was able to appreciate the care that went into researching the likely historical setup for the tale of these renowned ""heroes"".
What I disliked:
First, there were logistical flaws like wimpy people pulling bows that had 120 lb draw weights, weapons from inconsistent historical periods and countries, the overly done ""tough Amazon warrior princess"" typing done with Guinevere (it was laughably implausible).  That's enough to bother some people, but I can get over that sort of thing if the rest of a movie is pulled off well.
Sadly, King Arthur wasn't pulled off that well overall, and I think it was a problem with the basic story being a bit underwhelming.  The biggest (meaning, what took up most of the screenplay) task that these men faced involved not the fate of the nation nor the defeat of great evil, but protecting a small village from a band of marauding Saxons.  I just had a hard time caring.  You know a film is in trouble when the director has to rely so heavily on the music to convince the audience that there's deep emotion to a scene.  Yes, that score was swelling heavily and often, but somehow, I just didn't connect on the visceral level with the dilemmas of Arthur and his knights, or the plight of the oppressed common folk that they were shepherding to Hadrian's Wall. The Arthur/Guinivere/Lancelot romance was halfhearted.  Even the ""sad"" parts involving deaths of good guys didn't grab me, and I normally choke up.  I kept wondering, what's missing -- why can't I lose myself in this story?
So this is a valuable lesson to all future filmmakers that may wish to tackle this subject. Perhaps the Arthurian legend does need magic and mystery to carry it successfully on the big screen - after all, if you're going to take on a larger-than-life tradition, your scope had better be larger than life.  Otherwise, why bother?  You could any number of other documented military campaigns instead.  Too much petty realism combined with a too-small plot focus may have been the death of this King Arthur movie.

2146368,4,B0002YLCFQ,"""King Arthur"" wants to be all things to all people. Fortunately, the stylish direction, sharp performances and flavor of the time saves this film from falling into ""TV movie"" territory. In this retelling of the Arthur legend, we're given a more ""realistic"" take on Arthur. Based on evidence that Arthur may have been a Roman soldier serving in Britian, we meet a man who values honor, democracy and always remains true to his knights.
Arthur and his knights are indentured servants forced to serve in the military for Rome. They've done their time and expect the new Bishop to provide them with papers giving them their freedom. The Bishop has other plans, however, and asks Arthur and his knights to go on what amounts to a suicide mission. They're charged with saving a Roman family surrounded by invading Saxons. To do this Arthur must travel through hostile territory where native Brits led by Merlin ambush and attack the Romans with regularity.
Arthur agrees because of his duty to Rome but also so he can see Lancelot, Gwain and the rest of his surviving knights (there are only six now)return to the homes they gave up when forced to serve Rome.
Well directed by Antoine Fuque, ""King Arthur"" follows in the wake of John Boorman's early 80's retelling ""Excalibur"". Beyond the basic characters, there's little in common between the two films. That's to the former films advantage. The splendid action sequences and beautiful cinematography as well as the strong performances save ""King Arthur"" from becoming ""Robin Hood Price of Thieves"". ""King Arthur"" compares well with other films looking at the same themes although the characters are sketchy at best and we're never given any background on any character except for Arthur and Lancelot. The other knights kind of melt into the background because of this.
""King Arthur"" provides an enjoyable evening of entertainment but it isn't without some severe flaws. Luckily, the talent of the director, cast and the production values overcome any shortcomings in the bold, imaginative but underwritten script.",1089417600,2,2059,5.0588235294117645

2146370,4,B0002YLCFQ,"King Arthur is definitely an action film.  An action film with a bit of romance, a smattering of comedy, and a whole lot of drama, yes, but an action film nonetheless.  I wasn't quite expecting that, but came out liking it: from the moment the movie starts until the credit rolls, there is barely a break in the battle scenes or the intense moments where characters are running or fighting for their lives and their ""respective"" countries.  Reminiscent of Braveheart in many ways, this film is worth the watch, if only to consider the story of King Arthur from a new angle: with a realistic slant, rather than as a mystical ""fairy tale"" legend.
In the early Dark Ages, a band of Sarmatian knights led by half British, half Roman Lucius Artorius Castus or ""Arthur"" (Clive Owen) meet with Roman Bishop Germanius to receive their release papers after 15 years of forced service in the Roman army.  They are (understandably) upset to discover that they must forego their freedom awhile longer: Rome has decided to pull out of defeating/defending the island, leaving the country and its natives vulnerable to an invasion by the Saxons.  Arthur and his knights are sent on one last ""most dangerous of all"" suicide mission: to rescue a Roman family from the bloodthirsty Saxons by crossing through the perilous Woad's territory (enemy natives led by mystical woodsman Merlin) and bringing them back to safety.  Only when they succeed in this trial, will Arthur and his knights be given their papers and allowed to return home as free men.
The honorable Arthur must do a little convincing to get his knights to agree to this last most perilous mission: after all this band of real men is weary of fighting and ready to return home.  Soon his loyal yet rough-and-tumble knights agree, and Arthur and his band (including Lancelot played by Ioan Gruffud and Galahad played by Hugh Dancy) begin their perilous journey across Britain.  Along the way they encounter Merlin and his crew, who for some unknown reason, let them live and pass through the ""haunted"" forest alive.  After rescuing the Roman family (along with some natives who were in dire need), Arthur and his knights are forced to turn and fight the Saxons (who outnumber them by the handful!).  They are helped by a native warrior woman Guinevere  (Kiera Knightley), who ends up forcing a confrontation between Merlin and Arthur.  And when Arthur is finally faced with the choice to return to Rome or stay and fight for Britain alongside Merlin and the lovely Guinevere...
The overall tone and feel of this film is dark, with lots of smoke and fog used in the battle scenes: although this film centers around battles and fight scenes, there is an underlying storyline that makes this film entrancing and interesting. The knights are not ""larger-than-life"" heroes, chivalrous and pure legend not reality: these knights are real men. You can't help but cheer for Arthur and his men as they fight against the odds to defeat the enemies of Britain and gain their own release: but when the time comes for this band of men to go home, will they go or will they stay? For those of you thinking of taking young children, I'd say don't.  Although the storyline is well done and there is little language, he entire film is basically one big bloody battlefield: a few years ago, this film may have acquired an ""R"" rating, but with some editing of the worst fight scenes, the studio managed a PG-13 rating.
There is a lot of violence (what do you expect from a film about war?), very little language (I recall about 2 d*mn's, a few uses of bastard, and a few references to God, although most of those done either in a discussion or by calling out to Him); there is a coarse joke about a man's penis, and an instance of a man trying to rape a woman (he is stopped only after throwing her to the ground and falling on top of her). One character is portrayed as having a bunch of children outside of wedlock. There's also one scene where a man and woman end up having premarital sex (foreplay is intimated with a fair amount of skin, but no clear nudity that I can recall, before the camera pans out). There is one point at the beginning where prayer is mocked a bit, and ""the Roman church"" and its leaders are doubted some throughout, but Arthur does have a strong faith in God, which comes across very well, although his knights are mostly portrayed as atheists.
Regardless of what any of the critics say, if you are ok with a PG-13 rating for ""intense battle sequences, a scene of sensuality and some language,"" then you probably will really like this film: I did!  In fact, I will probably go to see it again in the theatre: the new setting for the King Arthur story and the realism made for a great story. Clive Owen did a phenomenal job as King Arthur and has gained respect in my eyes: Kiera Knightley was great, as always, as the ""Britain-warrior-woman"" Guinevere (although a completely different aspect of this legendary character, it never was so over the top as to annoy me), and Ioan Gruffud as Lancelot and Hugh Dancy as Galahad were wonderful as well: in fact, I think all the actors did a good job in this film.  If you like the story of King Arthur, you will like this film: from the beginning to the end, you are taken on a real-life adventure with ""King"" Arthur and the knights of the round table.",1089331200,6,5350,4.610935856992639
2146381,3,B0002YLCFQ,"The requisite ""leader on horseback exhorting the troops"" somehow works better when the troops number in the thousands, rather in single digits.  And Artorius's knights had already made the hard right turn to join the battle, so it wasn't like they needed encouragement.  But the battle scenes were all pretty spiffy, and the Sarmatian Knights had good band-of-brothers chemistry.  Unfortunately, Guinevere had no chemistry with Arthur, or Lancelot for that matter. She was best as a feisty contributor to the spiffy battle scenes.
The misty countryside had the right primeval look. And Clive Owens made a strong, if rather dour, Artorius.  The other Knights made a reasonable attempt at humor and camaraderie, especially Bors and Lancelot, although my favorites were Gawain and Tristan, who are less hearty and more believable.
A little more backstory would have helped. The combination of names from Mallory's La Morte D'Arthur with the Dark Age historical elements was jarring. And, hmmm.... how is it that the lone American accent came from the bad guy???  Who was played by a Dane?

 The first flaw in this poorly pieced together film is how each character is given a foundation and introduced with unique characteristics, but they never pan out. Specifically Lancelot whose prominent introduction seems like it will relate to some event later in the film, but alas it leaves loose ends. Many things are unclear including: who were the people of Merlin's and Guinevere's tribe and if Arthur's round table was supposed to be at Camelot, why was it located in a compound the seemed to be a part of Hadrian's Wall?
  There are several aspects and scenes of the film which appear to be taken from Mel Gibson's `Braveheart' including Arthur's message that the knights' cause is the freedom of the people.
  The battle scenes were entertaining...for a time, until my mind began to wander and I began to think about how my backside was aching from sitting through this 130 minute escapade. The acting was wooden except when there was the occasional chivalrous deed performed by Arthur (Clive Owen) or a heated outburst from Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd). The script was lacking save for the intermittent one-liners given to the knights who executed them quite well.

2146383,4,B0002YLCFQ,"I really wanted to love this film.  I have always been a fan of the Arthurian legends and stories; I've been a Clive Owen fan for years, and I've enjoyed many Jerry Bruckheimer films.  So what's not to love?
The film tries to be historical, but not really, sort of in the manner of 'Gladiator'.  But it isn't 'Gladiator'.  It tries to be 'Braveheart' in tone and message.  But it isn't 'Braveheart'.  It tries to be a triumphant tale of the king.  But it isn't 'The Return of the King'.  True, the viewer will see elements of each of these films in the plot, the characters, the cinematography, the choreography - but it falls short of each of these other films in significant ways.
One film this is deliberately not trying to be is 'Excalibur'. This is a demystified Arthur.  There is a Merlin, but his character is a Druid leader, devoid of any real supernatural powers; he is a shamanic figure, called a Dark Magician, but there's no magic here beyond the blue paint and mysteries-hiding-in-the-forest ways.  Arthur is a half-breed, Roman and British; this corresponds with what historians believe about early possible Arthurian figures - that he was a Romano-British leader at the time of the collapse of the Empire.  The knights in this tale are a complete invention - supposed conscripts from the Asian plains transplanted into Britain, they are under the leadership of Arthur along Hadrian's Wall (the northern border of England).  Fault number one occurs here - in a film trying hard to establish its this-really-happened credentials, Arthur should not be in the north.  Nor should the Saxons be invading in the north.  Nor should a principle Roman family be located on the undefended side of the wall.  Willing suspension of disbelief is one thing, but these are too many in a row.
I would give this picture three-and-one-half stars, but as whole numbers are required here, I will bump it up to a four-star-out-of-five picture on the whole.  The plot was plodding at times, but picks up near the end; too much reliance on battle scenes and not enough character development is done, particularly as the characters deviate from standard legends so much.  We care for Arthur, Guinevere and his knights, but somehow are left wondering why we do.  There's something missing here, and that's too bad.
The round table is effective but only vaguely explained.  The knights' relationship to each other and to Arthur is very clear from the outset, but apart from the most general of relationships with the legendary figures, they bear little resemblance in terms of actual deeds.  Arthur is an idealistic Roman Christian who becomes disillusioned by the failures of people far away - one should look up the historical figure of Pelagius prior to attending the film, as the early Christian heretical controversies play a rather unexpected role here.  The sword-in-the-stone legend is explained in a very innovative fashion.
The battle scenes are interesting if not entirely original.  The effects would be quite at home in films such as 'Gladiator' and 'Braveheart', right down to the armour and the blue paint.  The sword play is very good in some parts, although 'Troy' had better choreography in this regard.  The one very effective battle scene was the battle on the ice lake, which is quite ingenious, if not entirely believable.
One thing that is believable here are the character developments - not all the good guys live to see the end; not all the bad guys die or get their come-uppence, much like real life.  There is a happy ending of sorts, but of course history dictates that the Saxons would not in the end be held back; indeed, various invasions would continue until the time of the Normans.  Arthur's ideal in the film is one people united, ostensibly for liberty; of course, Arthur is declare king - at a time when constitutional monarchies did not exist, so much for the hope of liberty...
The juxtaposition of church and empire on the one side and the locals on the other is a bit of a problem - the Saxons are invading, so that is bad; the Romans and the church institution are foreign implants into the land also, and they are bad (neither live up to their ideals in practice).  The message here is a rather xenophobic one, not too thinly veiled.
Clive Owen puts in a very solid performance here, one of his best. Stellan Skarsgrd as the Saxon king is a bit overdone, but appropriate to the character.  Guinevere, portrayed by Keira Knightley, is a unique character, a native (Woad) who becomes the conscience of Arthur.  The love interest/affair between Guinevere  and Lancelot (portrayed by Ioan Gruffudd) is given a new and interesting twist, taking place entirely before the marriage of Arthur and Guinevere, with Merlin as the officiant of the ceremony.  Merlin (Stephen Dillane) is a shadowy figure who fights the Romans until the Saxons become an even worse enemy - then, the enemy of my enemy...; Dillane carries this role out admirably, largely by his presence more than by performance.
The film was set on location in Ireland for the most part - undisturbed rolling hills are seen everywhere; primeval forests that make one think of Druid/Celtic/mystic influences.
One thing I did love was the sound - I think I was more aware of the sound in this film than any other for quite some time.  From the arrows flying through the air, the horses pounding the ground, the swords clanking and the ice cracking, the sound really stood out as full and crisp, moreso than in similar films.  The music by Hans Zimmer is appropriate, but also somewhat derivative of other films like 'Gladiator' - the songs by Moya Brennan are (not surprisingly) hauntingly Celtic in tone.",1089331200,7,5689,4.813977389516958
2146384,4,B0002YLCFQ,"MikeonAlpha got it wrong to all of us out there who are Arthur fans.  Arthur in this story has a father that was Roman and a mother that was BRITON, not Anglo!  Britons are the nature god-worshiping, celtic language speaking peoples that inhabited Britain from ancient times.  Anglos, along with the Saxons and Normans, were warrior god-worshiping, germanic language speaking peoples from what is today northern Europe.
Regarding the movie, it has great historical detail, but a very different story than most of us know.  If you go into the movie knowing this, then you can settle down and enjoy the speculative story that bears little resemblence to traditional story lines.
If you are a true Arthur fan, you may get a little mad, but you will enjoy the period clothing, swords, languages and adaptations of some Arthurian legend to this movie.
I, for one, would have preferred that this movie have been released as an R rating version because the fight scenes during this bloody, ferocious time period left something to be desired.  The battle frenzy that celtic peoples and nordics were known for is surprisingly lacking, excepting Kira Knightly who makes a 3/4 hearted attempt.
The historic battle of Badon Hill (the first of historical Arthur's nine battles for Britain) is presented nicely, but once again could have had more blood and gore (more historicity).

the main focus. Was a great movie.",1089244800,2,217,4.317073170731708
2146386,3,B0002YLCFQ,"Apparently someone decided that the story of the great King Arthur needed a facelift.  At the beginning of the movie, a reference is made to some new archeological evidence that tells what really happened and who Arthur really was. WHO CARES!!  I wanted to see the famous story. You know, the one with the lady of the lake, and Merlin the great magician. The one with the powerful sword Excalibur and all the wonder of the Knights of the Round Table.
  Instead, Merlin is just some old guy, Arthur is just some commander of a small group of warriors of various nationalities and Guinevere is just some girl that Arthur rescues.
  I was very disappointed with the slow pace, and the lack of action.  On top of that, none of the ""Knights"" ever really demonstrated any real swordsmanship that would have justified the reverance everyone kept demonstrating throughout the flick.
  I gave this movie 3 stars because there were a couple of things I did like here. Keira Knightly's acting was pretty good and when the final fight scene finally came , she hit hard and fast with a fire in her eye and bad intentions for her enemies. I also really liked the performance of Stellen Skarsgard who played the leader of the Saxon hoard.  He spoke softly, but his words were serious.  He commanded every scene he was in.  Lastly, I have to say that Ray Winstone was great.  He was funny, loving and valiant all at the same time. He made all the long boring scenes bearable.
  I recommend you see the film, but wait for the DVD and spend your 8 1/2 bucks on Spiderman2.",1089244800,,1554,4.519713261648746

2146388,2,B0002YLCFQ,"I was excited to see this movie originally.  I wanted it to be a darker and more complex version of the intriguing myth of Arthur and his knights.  After Camelot the musical, King Arthur and his story needed a bit of darkness and complexity.  But this movie feeds off that want to merely give a sketch of something that could have been unique.
The script doesn't allow its characters to do much of anything other than fight with one another and their enemies.  The main point of the movie is lost because the audience has no real reason to care for these men.  We all know the main story of Arthur and Camelot, but if you're trying to give a new feeling/edge to an old story you should start by redescribing your characters to the audience, which is what the writers try to do but ultimately fail.  And in this film all we're left to see is a ragtag team of soldiers who only talk to going home.  If only the writers could have taken a little more time to explore who these characters are the film may have meant more.
I feel bad for the excellent actors who were used in this film.  Clive Owen is a great actor of independent films, who should be famous by now.  Ioan Gruffudd is wonderful in Horatio Hornblower.  And Keira Knightley has shown her blooming talent in Bruckheimer's Pirates of the Carribbean.  They all try to lift this film to a higher level but the script leaves very little for them to do other than show their spectacularly staged fighting skills. Even the love triangle, one of the most famous aspects of the legend, feels strained, overly simplified, and not that interesting.",1089244800,24,1598,4.475862068965517
2146389,3,B0002YLCFQ,"I just got back from seeing this highly anticipated summer action picture. To be quite honest, it was a huge letdown. It was still semi entertaining (hence the 3 stars), but it took itself way too seriously. Keira Knightly is as hot as ever and is the standout as the sexy yet tough Guinevere. Clive Owen was okay as King Arthur, but my biggest complaint is that annoying Lancelot and the absense of Merlin (save for a couple of short scenes). If you aren't going to have Merlin be a larger part of the film, don't have him in it at all. And please don't go in this film expecting the true history on Arthur, this film is just more theories strung together to make stupid audience members say ""I didn't know that."" Some of the action scenes were well done (Ice Battle), but I would wait to see this one on Dvd. Save your money and catch ""The Village"" and ""Alien vs. Predator"" which will both be out within the next month.",1089158400,4,921,4.329479768786127
2146390,4,B0002YLCFQ,"If you are a fan of the Bernard Cornwell Series, ""Enemy of God"" you will enjoy this movie.  It is not the mythical/legendary version of his tale but the historical possibility of how his legend may have come about.  It depicts a very small time frame when the Romans were abandoning Briton and the Saxons were taking advantage of that fact and engaging the Britons/Celts that were left behind and Arthur's deeds in becoming their king.
-Excellent battle scenes that are not too graphic for younger folks.
-Kiesha Knight is darn sexy as Guinevere
-Battle and key scenes are dramatized ala Armageddon which corny as it may be, I liked very much
-Clive Owen, is well cast as Arthur.
-Cinematography is well done.",1089158400,3,709,4.7560975609756095

8034802,1,B0002YLCFQ,TIL The historical Arthur wasn't a King of the Britons or even a knight but rather a Yugoslavian horseman whose knights of the round table  battle the Saxon invaders under order of Roman clergy to rescue a Roman youth bound for the clergy. I also learn that the historical Arthur is a dark brooding character more like Mordred than is usually portrayed.,1518825600,,353,4.693548387096774
