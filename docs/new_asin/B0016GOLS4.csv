8262423,5,B0016GOLS4,"Bollywood fans enjoy films like this one because they feature beautiful people in beautiful costumes and singing beautiful songs set agasint spectacular scenery.  Chori Chori has all that and more.  Ajay Devgan is taken aback when his marriage proposal to Sonali Bendre is turned down.  The house he was buidling for their life together is abandonded - until Rani Mukerjee needs a place to live and makes her way to it after a chance meeting with Ajay.  Rani uses the cover story of an impending marriage, which delights Ajay's extended family ... and seems to renew Sonali's interest in him.  Ajay and Rani begin to ""pretend to be in love"" which leads to real love, but will either of them admit it?  There are hints of Hollywood films here, but this is so much more enjoyable and satisfying.  A great love story and a wonderful intro to Bollywood movies.",1346889600,3,856,4.704697986577181
