8227433,4,B000X9WXD0,"I've bought about 100 Dvds from Justplanes, and, although this one covers an interesting airline and a very modern airliner, it was not one of the best Justplanes Dvds, but I recommend it for all people interested in this kind of video.",1233360000,,236,4.642857142857143
8227434,4,B000X9WXD0,"This DVD is somewhat disappointing yet at the same time it has some cool stuff in it. You begin with the flight preparations followed by a flight from vienna (switzerland) to kuala lampur (malaysia). I have bought over 20 DVD's from Just Planes and World Air Routes. Based on my observations and experiences, this video is not as good as its supposed to be. However, since the captain presented to us a powerpoint presentation of how to check the exterior side of the B777-200 aircraft I am rating it as 4/5. Overall it is a good DVD to have but clearly not the best. The best DVD so far in my opinion is the OASIS hong kong airlines DVD.",1216339200,2,638,4.369747899159663
8227435,5,B000X9WXD0,"Very cool video of several days in the life of a crew, including cockpit time. This is the first of this type of video that I've purchased, and after watching it I might buy  another one.",1200096000,3,187,4.194444444444445
