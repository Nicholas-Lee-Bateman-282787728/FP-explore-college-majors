8534574,5,B00925TBUO,"This is a tragic and somewhat static opera. Even Verdi himself called it a ""prolonged funeral"". Even so, it contains wonderful arias, ensembles and choruses. The set and the costumes work very well together, and are designed by the same person, William Orlandi. The stage director, Josesph Franconi Lee, could perhaps injected some more life into the performance, but on the other hand, it is better not to overdo. The leading vocal trio Leo Nucci (Francesco), Roberto De Biasio (Jacopo) and Tatiana Serjan (Lucrezia) is a joy to the ear. At times though, I find that too much power is used, and a more subtler approach could have been used. It may be the conductor, Donato Renzetti, who have chosen this ""powerful"" approach. As a whole, a very enjoyable performance. Picture and sound are as usual above praise.

8534575,4,B00925TBUO,"Composed in 1844 during the composer's 'galley years', I Due Foscari has very little dramatic drive and is largely tied to the conventions of the number opera, but somehow Verdi still manages to overcome those limitations. In some ways the structure and lack of drama makes this an untypical Verdi opera, but at the same time it demonstrates his characteristic attention to detail and his unerring ability to find exactly the right tone that best meets the dramatic requirements of the work. It might take you right until the end of Act III to realise just how masterfully that has been achieved, but this fine 2009 production from the Teatro Regio di Parma gives the work its best possible presentation.

Based on a work by Lord Byron, 'The Two Foscari', there's very little dramatic development in a story that is little more than a murder trial where we get to see neither the murder nor the trial. The accused however is the son of the Doge, so there's a great deal of conflict between family and duty (not an uncommon situation in a Verdi opera) where the Doge, Francesco Foscari finds that even as the ruler of Venice, his powers are limited. Dramatic developments might be few then and the sentiments are conventional expressions of patriotism, pleas to God, arias of despair and calls for vengeance but Verdi is nonetheless able to create a compelling drama out of this, allowing the intensity to build through the first two acts before hitting you with a powerful Act II finale and then following it with a showpiece for the Doge in Act III.

It helps if you have great singers to play these roles and, fortunately, the casting for this production in Parma is of the highest order. Some of the names might be unfamiliar, but Roberto De Biasio and Tatiana Serjan as Jacopo and Lucrezia make the first two acts rivetting. De Biasio sings with clarity and purpose, even if the sentiments expressed in prison are fairly standard, as he awaits ""a fate worse than death"" in exile from his country and his family. Tatiana Serjan however is even more impressive. She has the largest role in the first two acts and gives a flawless singing and dramatic performance. Act III however belongs to the Doge, and this role is in the experienced hands of Leo Nucci. His grave intonations are perfect for expressing the weight of his character's personal conflict, so great this time that it drives him to his death.

Visually, it's not an exciting production, but it is staged with a sense of understated grandeur that reflects its 15th century Venetian setting as well as suiting Verdi's intentions for the work and its sombre musical tone.  The sets are minimal representations of the wooden panels of the Ducal Palace and the prison, but shrouded in darkness they create an appropriately oppressive atmosphere with strong colour schemes and effective lighting that serves the historical context, the dramatic function and the musical tone very well. Well staged, superbly sung, this then is as good an account of this rare Verdi work as you could possibly expect.",1376697600,5,3059,4.809885931558935
8534576,5,B00925TBUO,"A sad, sad unrelievedly sad story, no lovely love duet, no comic relief, just unrelenting sadness ending in death. But music saves the day; it is magnificent! This opera came out in November 1844 just a few months after Ernani premiered in March 1844. (The first and second libretto by Piave) To be followed by Giavanna D'Arco in February 1845. These were the ""Galley Slave"" years of rapid productions as Verdi referred to them in later life. He was writing several operas a year. That would have been a regular experience to Rossini or Donizetti but Verdi treated each of his ""children"" as an individual entity  and would never think of reusing old musical material in new works as the other composers often did.
Even more so than in Ernani, Verdi is writing solid dramatic scores. His harmonies are richer and more unexpected. The orchestral sound is full with solo riffs by woodwinds or brass where appropriate. It follows the sound of the language being sung yet increases the understanding of the scene that language alone cannot fulfill. Gone are the days where the orchestra is simply to lend accompaniment to the vocal line. He is creating an artistic entity not just an entertainment.
Yes this is a sad story but it is a great work of art that happens to be sad. The story by Lord Byron (The Two Foscaris - a verse play) tells of the events of the overthrow of the crowned Doge by the Decemvies (The Ten: the ruling Patricians) At the time, 1457, Venice was a repressive oligarchy with a Doge (Prince) chosen by all parties of the state and crowned for life. Piave's libretto takes Byron's five act play and makes a short sweet opera of barely over one hundred minutes.
The overwhelming character of this opera is the Doge; steadfast in upholding the law of the land even if it means exile of his one remaining son. In this recording Leo Nucci is every inch the Doge and is among the greatest characterizations  of any role I've seen in opera. I have only seen this opera live once before; Dec 1972 at Lyric Opera of Chicago(six performances; I was an usher) done with the great Piero Cappuccili as the Doge. I was deeply moved then and I'm deeply moved by this performance.
The Jacopo Foscari son of the Doge and sentenced to exile is Robert de Biasio. He has a substantial lyric tenor voice and handled his music very well. He spends most of his time bemoaning his fate and could be a portrait of Lord Byron himself exiled as he was from his peers in England.
The strongest character in the opera is Jacopo's wife and mother of his two sons; Lucrezia Contarini. This role was played with dramatic intensity by Tatania Serjan. She has a big, well rounded, well controlled voice of exceptional quality. She sang the bereaved wife beautifully. I look forward to hearing her in more Verdi roles. She has the voice and the guts for serious Verdi.
The rest of the cast did well also as did the chorus and conductor Donato Renzetti. The sets, costumes and choreography  were all of exceptional quality. Highly recommended.",1374537600,4,3026,4.631284916201118
8534577,5,B00925TBUO,"My main concern is that in this series of Customer Reviews only one (1) really applies to this performance, the other nine (9) are written for an entirely different performance. This is entirely Amazon's fault and none of the quotations, correct or false really apply.
The one review that applies is by a gentleman named J.Gleason Sr. and I agree with him. I am not going to duplicate him.
Just would like to emphasize that this is the latest DVD version of this neglected Verdi opus. It's stupendously produced, directed and performed with authenticity, excellence and love worthy of the 200th birthday of the great Italian master whose worst opera is better than many composers' best.",1361059200,7,686,4.922413793103448
8534578,5,B00925TBUO,"Much has been written about the plot of I Due Foscari: ""Nothing actually happens. There is no moment of decision, no moral dilemma ... When we first see the main characters, they are sad. Then they are sadder. Then they're dead. Slow curtain. The end."" (Berger, Verdi With A Vengeance) But the same writers note that the music is fantastic: the baritone part (Francesco Foscari, the Doge of Venice) is ""...a tour de force for a great baritone""; the tenor role of Jacopo is ""  easily one of the most lyrical and least strident Verdi ever wrote"".(id)

What I experienced, gentle reader, was one of the most electrifying performance of ANY opera I have ever seen. The intensity of the performers was maintained in chorus and orchestra from start to finish. As far as the individual singers are concerned ...

I think that I will buy any recording in which Roberto De Biasio sings; he was absolutely ""on"" from his first note to his last. Comments I have heard about how well he did at the Met last season in Ernani were proven to be spot on in this opera. Bravo.

I had never heard Tatania Serjan before, and when she started to sing, I was concerned that she would not be able to maintain her intensity, both vocally and dramatically, until the end. She did. She will sing Luisa Miller in this C major series and it has just become a ""must buy"" Brava!

I was a bit concerned about how Leo Nucci would do, considering his age. He hit it right out of the park!! He never let up, and the voice sounded as good at the end as it did when he first sang. Bravo!!

Maestro Renzetti was superb in the pit. I can't praise his pacing enough. Wow and Bravo!!

Disc quality was good, but the house was not well miked, so the applause, of which there was a lot, was muted. I got a sense of imbalance from the orchestra once or twice, but that may be my aging hearing.

If you like Verdi, you must experience this disc; it's as simple as that.",1352419200,15,1925,4.342618384401114
