4440873,5,B004OSVTRW,"This was a birthday gift from my girlfriend. I have watched most of the movies but missed a couple. I am excited to sit down and watch the ones I missed. So far my favorite is probably ""The Two Escobars"". I am still amazed with some of the footage and interviews ESPN was able to get for some of these films. Looks like I have about 30 things to do this summer.",1305763200,49,361,4.027777777777778
4440874,5,B004OSVTRW,"30 for 30 is easliy the best movie set collection ever.  It has a variety of different topics with different topics.  And not all the topics are purely sports. For example, one movie is about Tupac and Mike Tyson. 30 for 30 has great movies, plus it is at a reasonable price.",1299542400,16,275,4.269230769230769

4440877,2,B004OSVTRW,"Not all discs work. I tried using different blu ray players and some discs are ""not recognized"". I loved watching the first 2 discs which worked but got very disappointed once I got to the ones that can't be read. Am I getting a refund? or getting a new product? I should have read the bad reviews before purchasing :(",1512950400,,318,4.316666666666666
4440878,3,B004OSVTRW,"While my rating has nothing to do with the context of the series, because I love the 30 for 30 series, it is more about what I purchased. I purchased the full season to stream through my amazon video account, and I paid for 3 entire seasons, because for some reason I couldn't purchase the 3rd season is split into a 3rd and 4th season, and the 3rd season cant be bought all at once so I cherry picked through the ones I liked, yet there are a bunch of episodes from season 1 missing: the legend of jimmy the Greek, one night in Vegas, & straight outta LA. Whats up with this? I really wanted to watch The Legend of Jimmy the Greek, and was extremely upset that it was not included with my purchase of the FULL season 1 set. Can this please be rectified because I would like to own the series in its entirety. TLOJTG is also not even available for a separate stream purchase. This is extremely disheartening.",1512691200,4,908,4.254335260115607

4440880,1,B004OSVTRW,"So, I've bought this product twice, once used, and the second time it was brand new. In both sets, the second disc, disc two, films 7 through 10, doesn't work. I returned the first set, thinking it was because it was used. Now I feel it is a manufacturing problem.

I've put the disc into a blu-ray player, and three separate Xbox one systems. We also tried a computer. Nothing worked, it simply told us to eject the disc and insure it was the proper format.

At this point I'm not even sure if I'd bother returning it. I love 30 for 30, and disc two has some of my favorite films on it, including Guru of Go and The U. This is incredibly disappointing. Is the product not inspected before being packaged and sold? Is there anything that can be done to fix this for me?",1510099200,,769,4.224489795918367

From a foreigner's point-of-view the films were highly informative as I gained valuable insights on a number of sports I knew little about like American Football. The stories of the USFL, Jimmy the Greek, the Baltimore Colts Marching Band and many others were new topics for me, and I found all the films to be great sporting education.

How do I put it? It's just downright terrible. It's no surprise that sports fans keep praising this show; most of them aren't very bright or intellectual. The shows seem like they're made by film students who are trying their hardest to recreate better shows, like Real Sports. Unfortunately, this is not as compelling. The shows have no focus. They don't really share any information with the viewers that wasn't known before. It's an amateurishly made show. Every episode comes off like some term paper a student wrote the night before and finished just to get done.

I think most of the people praising this show are likely turning it on while they're doing something else, pay attention to a few scenes, then conclude the show is genius. That's my only explanation. I can't recommend this.",1440979200,,962,4.726190476190476

An embarrassment to College Football as many of these players had criminal records and the three coaches - Schellenberger, Jimmy Johnson and Dennis Erickson should be ashamed of themselves. All the Wins and National Championships should be 'vacated"" as Student Athletes should actually go to class and meet some kind of minimum standard academically. Most of these players were great athletes - but should have gone straight from the Hood to the NFL (after serving their jail sentences).

4441007,5,B004OSVTRW,"""30 for 30 Season 1"" is twenty-seven sports-related documentaries from the past 30 years of ESPN's existence (i.e. going back to the earlier 80's).  Frankly, it's somewhat hard to believe that they could make so many excellent, well researched and well-made documentaries in a short amount of time.  If you're like me (i.e. were around going back to the early 80's) it will fondly bring back many memories of sports in the 80's and 90's, and you'll debate with your friends which doc was the best.

I haven't watched quite all 27, but have seen all or parts of most.  My personal favorite is ""Once Brothers,"" and one could absolutely appreciate it if you're not an NBA or even sports fan.  It tells how several future NBA players who played for the Yogoslavic national team became torn apart during their time in the NBA when Yugoslavia broke apart and suffered civil war.  It primarily centers around Vladi Divac and his alienation from the NBA Croat players (primarily Drazen Petrovic...and also covers his tragic death), who were once Divac's ""Slav"" brethren.

Beyond that I'm an NFL, College Football, and Soccer fan so I completely enjoyed 1) the USFL episode (brought back a lot of nostalgia from that time); 2) Jimmy the Greek  episode (very sad, and could also be a candidate for my favorite); 3) ""The Band that Wouldn't Die"" about the Colts departure from Baltimore to Indy; 4) ""the two Escobars"" (a great soccer related doc) and 5) Run Ricky Run (a cerebral and interesting look at Ricky William's career).  The three college football related ones were probably my most favorites other than ""Once Brothers,"" and possibly the Jimmy the Greek and USFL episodes - ""The U,"" ""The Best that Never Was,"" and ""Pony Excess"" (I think one of the first bowl games I recall watching as a kid was the Pitt-SMU Cotton Bowl, and I definitely recall SMU getting caught twice for violations that led to ""the Death Penalty"").

Others of my favorites are ""Little Big Men"" (I'm from WA state and so recall the Kirkland, WA little league champs and how hyped the pitcher was), ""the 16th man"" (a must-watch if you're interested in Mr. Mandella's legacy), and ""Jordan rides the Bus"" (an interesting re-examination of Jordan's minor league baseball career that reopens whether Jordan truly quit due to his lack of baseball skill).

All the ones mentioned above are superb and none of the others I've watched,  or watched part of, are bad.  The only one that I thought was just okay was ""the House of Steinbrenner.

From the ones I've watched of season 2, the quality of the documentaries has continued!",1420329600,,2587,4.784269662921348

At first glance, some of these films may not appeal to all because they cover so many sports, but I found,  even with the subjects  I wasn't particularly interested in, the programs were so well made and had such human interest in them, that they became compulsive viewing. Being a baseball nut I was naturally drawn to the five baseball stories especially ""Four Days in October"" (a must for  Red Sox fans) and ""Little Big Men"", a superb documentary on the Kirkland, Washington Little League team of 1982.  But there are so many fine films with an amazing range of sports and sports people covered in this collection that you will never get bored with this essential set of  twelve discs in a neat and attractive compact boxed set.

4441069,5,B004OSVTRW,"Outside of the Pistons Bad Boys documentary, this was my favorite, even without Chris Webber. That is what surprised me most is that Webber was the best player on the team, and a gregarious person but refused to participate so you wondered going in how they could do this without him. Well, Jalen Rose made that a reality.

Rose, Juwan Howard, Jimmy King and Ray Jackson offered extraordinarily candid insight and bluntly honest answers about Michigan making a fortune off them, their plain blue shirt protest, the first game Coach Steve Fisher announced Ray Jackson would start with Rose, Howard, King and Webber, their fashion impact that is felt to this day, Webber's timeout, and, the alleged payments to Webber that tainted their Final Four and back to back championship game appearances.

What was impressive is what I mentioned earlier, the candid, honest answers they gave, in particular about Webber. They showed love, immense respect, and didn't bash him, but they answered incredibly well without making him look bad, but not hiding what they knew.",1399161600,,1059,5.045714285714285

One of the things that makes it so great is the high quality programming available through it; like 30 for 30.  The stories are compelling and presented in an entertaining and interesting fashion.

You were kind enough to exchange it for a new copy... with two defective disks (the same ones, no less.) Now, I'm not bothering to return it yet again, because I assume you'll just do the same thing as before (!) So please, pretty please could you check your product batch before you send it out? I enjoy ordering from amazon (love it, in fact) and it's beyond disappointing when you don't feel like you got what you paid for (and yeah, I got this set on discount, but still; If I was only supposed to get 20 documentaries out of the thirty, well knowing in advance would have been wonderful.)

My faves were the segments titled, The Band that Wouldn't Die, The U, The Best that Never Was and The Trial of Allen Iverson, Fernando Nation and Pony Excess.

On the other hand, the stories make those who don't follow sports able to appreciate what so many of us love about the games we love.  It's not just about the sports; it's about the people who play the sports, the fans who follow the sports, and everyone else who is directly or indirectly affected.

4441266,5,B004OSVTRW,"I have been overly impressed with the ESPN 30 for 30 documentary series since I watched The U about a year ago.  The series is extremely diverse, ranging from the big 4 (football, baseball, basketball and hockey), to covering other areas such as tennis, soccer, boxing and overall human interest stories related to sports stories.

One of my favorite features of the series is the raw human emotion shared within each of the episodes.  You can share in the joy, elation, sadness and heartbreak expressed by those in the stories.  I have also enjoyed many of the areas that I have not previously been intested in (specifically, the story of the two Escobars since I am not a big fan of soccer) and it is bringing me a whole new perspective on the impact of these sports on many different areas of life.

These were brave lads to even take the pitch. This documentary, linking the rise of Colombian soccer and Andres Escobar to the rise of the Colombian drug cartels and Juan Pablo Escobar (no relation) is brilliantly told. The interviews with family members, politicians, and former drug cartel leaders interspersed with exciting footage from Colombian soccer's heyday is put together in a way that not only tells the story of those two people and their families but also of how Colombia came to be conflicted in its own views of the drug lords and the lasting fallout from those tragic days.",1349395200,,793,4.925373134328358

Jimmy Johnson belongs in the NFL Hall of fame because he transcended college and the pro game and won on both levels.  Coach Howard Schnellenberger was a visionary, an architect, Coach Johnson was the master craftsman, and Coach Erickson and Cooke undderstood how to utilize the tools they were handed.

The background stories and highlights reminded me how great Pat, Starks, Jackson, Davis boys, and, of course, the one and only, Reggie Miller. I am a Bruin fan and I remember the 'Cheryl' cheers and I always laughed when Reggie would then light up the score board and then stare down our rivals.

A bonus is seeing the great Cheryl Miller. It's a shame that Cheryl never got to play in the WNBA. At her best, she was the Michael Jordon of women's basketball.",1346112000,,654,4.5423728813559325

I loved watching the Knicks and Pacers face-off, no matter the outcome (I can say that now because I appreciate what I saw, lol).  Hearing the players and coaches being able to talk about it now that they aren't as directly involved is awesome, on both sides.  Love it.

I know it was on TV for awhile and I always missed at least a 1/4 of the show so it is great to have this series on Amazon.",1345593600,2,450,4.079545454545454
4441372,5,B004OSVTRW,"I was a teenager in the 70s and was riveted by the rivalry between Martina and Chris. They were such a contrast, both in temperament and playing style. I remember being totally awed by the power and aggressiveness of Martina's game, and at the same time impressed by Chris's steely determination and passing shots. It always surprised me to hear that they were friends off court, because the media liked to play up personality issues and the extremes of their competition.

This documentary is a wonderful inside look at their careers and lives in respect to each other, both on and off the court. I had an overwhelming sense of nostalgia as I watched, reliving the excitement I experienced watching them play all those years ago. And it was heartwarming to see how these two great women relate to each other as they talked about their shared past.

Both women come across as very open and willing to discuss almost anything. They share a lot of interesting insights about themselves, and each other. They also cover a few interesting tidbits about how women's tennis has changed between then and now. I like the format chosen, where most of the time they are simply in conversation with each other. It came across as relaxed, natural, and very real. These scenes are interspersed with tennis footage and individual interviews.

My only complaint, if you can call it that, is that I would have loved it even more if Unmatched were twice as long and included a lot more tennis footage. The tennis clips that are included are quite brief, and I think I was expecting a little more in that regard.

I highly recommend Unmatched to anyone who fondly remembers the greatest tennis rivalry of all time, or to anyone interested in the history of women's tennis. I own a copy on DVD.",1345593600,2,1775,4.697749196141479

From his prep career & college recruitment to his college success and his reaction to that success - the Marcus Dupree story has it all.  But the story doesn't end there - it's just getting started.

I mean I almost never sit down and watch any kind of game on TV, or go to a sporting event, or know what other guys are talking about when the subject of baseball, football, or basketball comes up.  I could name a couple of players in every sport, the ones that everyone else knows, but that is it.  So that said, I think this set is nothing short of great.  I love documentaries that are well made and take you into a world that you don't know about in a way that makes it fascinating.  I've watched documentaries on scrabble, spelling bees, or competitive crossword puzzles and loved them.  Most stories have taken an aspect of some sport and told a story that has drawn me in almost immediately.  Usually it is an interesting part of a much larger picture.  For instance, I know who Wayne Gretzky, the hockey player, is and I have a vague recollection of him coming to the US, but I never knew the story of how it affected the people of Edmonton and all of the drama behind it.  Also very interesting to hear him talk about it now.  So in summary, I would recommend this set to anyone, man or woman, in the knowledge that they would enjoy it as much as me once they got started.

I recommend the collection to anyone who is a sports fan who wants greater insight to some of the enigmatic sports personalities of the last 30 years.,1315526400,2,465,4.614457831325301
4441478,5,B004OSVTRW,Bought this for my boyfriend as a birthday present and it was a big hit. The films are fantastic and I've had to resist watching some without him because I like them so much. It's definitely worth it to get the blue ray.,1314921600,,220,4.1395348837209305

4441480,5,B004OSVTRW,"Brilliant short films on all kinds of different sports-related topics. The platitudes written about this set all have real merit: Contained within is some of the best filmmaking of any kind that ever has been produced, and I don't know that another series like this one ever has been released. The included hat is a bit of a throwaway but it's doubtful that anyone would spend this kind of money just to get the hat anyway.",1314403200,3,423,4.578947368421052

4441482,5,B004OSVTRW,"I am a HUGE sports fanatic so as soon as I had the chance to purchase the ESPN FIlms 30 for 30 set, I didn't hesitate to pull the trigger. I had watched a few of these films on TV prior to purchasing and all of them were done amazingly well. Within a lot of the films you are exposed to many previously unseen footages and untold stories (For example, the ""Two Escobars"" tells the story of Pablo Escobar and his connection to the rise of Colombian soccer. How ESPN got hand on some of these footages, I do not know). Even if you aren't a big sports fan, I would highly recommend this series because most of the films tells a great story. And in the end isn't that what we all want from watching films?",1313193600,,701,4.124087591240876
4441483,5,B004OSVTRW,I caught several of the 30 for 30 episodes when they aired on ESPN. Having the full set and getting a great deal on the price was a no brainer.

4441486,5,B004OSVTRW,"I had seen a few of the docos on ESPN and wondered what is this? 60 minutes or something?
But from the first 5 minutes, I was mesmerised. I am not a hugh sports fan BUT I was captured by the human stories behind the great (or worst) moments in sport.

The behind the scenes - the true stories - were what I was interested in.

The reason I bought this box set was becaiuse of the packaging - slim boxes!! I hate it when box sets take up too much room on my shelf, but not this one. Plus you get an ESPN hat as a thrown in bonus!!
You get volumes 1 and 2 and there are 2 to 3 documentaries per disc. There are also plenty of extras.
This was a great buy - I would recommend it to everyone",1312070400,,687,3.797202797202797

This is a purchase you won't regret",1310688000,,351,4.484375
4441493,5,B004OSVTRW,"Simply put, this set is amazing. I caught close to half the movies on television and loved them all. Then I watched the others (still not completely done, but mostly) and they, too, are all brilliantly done. There's really not much more I can say without gushing or possibly spoiling; but know that this set is a must for any sports fan or any fan of movie making at its finest.

Oh, and it comes with a hat. The hat is pretty sweet. Can't go wrong with a nice hat.",1310688000,,465,4.166666666666667

This is a great collection of movies that spans several sports and generations, and you're guaranteed to find a number of these that you're sure to enjoy.

Would highly recommend for the sports fan in your life.",1308960000,,468,4.35632183908046
4441522,5,B004OSVTRW,"Picked up this Collector's set when Amazon had a One-day sale.  The price was right but I had never heard of the ESPN Films so I decided to do some research.  Came on this site and saw nothing but 5 Star reviews, checked out a few trailers and decided to bite.  So far I've only watched 2 Films(Once Brothers & The Best that Never was) and if this is any indication of how the rest of the Films are going to be than I made a great purchase.  Even with the stories taking place 20+ years ago, I felt that I was right there with them.  That's how well these films are directed.

As for the Box Set itself, it's basically the 2 individual volumes and a hat packaged in a neat black 8x10 box.  I'd be proud to display it in my shelf.

All in all, great product for any sports fan or even someone that likes watching documentaries.",1308787200,,826,4.11875
4441523,5,B004OSVTRW,"Alright, just a quick bit of background as to why I purchased this. Long story short: I was seeking the perfect Father's Day gift. This was it! Actually, I had been eyeing this set for quite some time, but then when I discovered it came packaged with a hat, it was a ""no brainer."" For those of you wondering, yes, the hat is of nice quality and it is comprised of a rich black color, with the ""ESPN"" logo in vibrant red color. It is excellent to wear around at sporting events, bars, or anywhere to be quite honest.

As for the documentaries offered in the set, both volumes are included here (films 1-30) and packaged quite nicely I might add. Naturally I haven't been able to watch them all yet, but my father and I have sat down and looked at a good deal of them, and all I have to say is that each-and-every film is extremely well done. Now, I might add, I hadn't seen any of these when they aired on television before purchasing this, but I knew of them, and many of my friends swore they were amazing. Well they were absolutely right, because these videos are filled to the brim with both entertainment and informative learning.  There were many times where I found myself stunned at just how much unseen and/or rare footage was used within a great deal of the films (and I still have plenty more to look through). Also, for the older generation, a sense of nostalgia or ""I remember when that happened,"" can definitely be felt when viewing these. It's nice to know that one can easily tell some form of ""thought"" was put into the production, research, and presentation of these documentaries, and because of that, they truly stand out.

Let's say you were on the fence about purchasing this set though due to consideration of the Blu-Ray set (like I was). Now in case you don't know, these films (all 30) are bundled up in a single volume in Blu-Ray format at Best Buy, and at a cheaper price I might add (which actually shocked me somewhat). I put in quite some thought as to whether to purchase that over this, but two key components led me to this DVD set. First off, the fact that not everyone has a Blu-Ray player these days, and if I wanted to show one of these films at a friend's house or something of that nature, I would be better off not taking the gamble and simply sticking with the DVD format. Also, my laptop doesn't have a Blu-Ray drive (though if yours does, as many do these days, feel free to reconsider), and so I wouldn't be able to watch these films ""on the go"" on my laptop. The other reason was the hat! I couldn't resist the wonders of the hat! Well in all honesty, while the hat is very nice, in my particular case my father needed a hat, so the inclusion of this was like ""two birds with one stone.""

Anyway, if you haven't seen these films (like I had not) prior to purchasing, and just don't know if it's worth the cash to invest in this set, I would strongly urge that you just ""cave in"" and buy this! Any person who considers themselves to be a sports fan will truly appreciate this, and I guarantee you will not be disappointed! :)",1308700800,52,3069,4.322916666666667
4441524,5,B004OSVTRW,"I'd been waiting for what seemed like an age for this series to come to dvd and this boxset is exactly what I was after. The series covers a wide range of moments spanning multiple sports in a set that's sure to suck you in. I don't think even being a die hard sports fan is necessary because the way the moments are presented they're a story in themselves. I can't recommend the series or this set highly enough.

A perfect gift for the sports lover in your family or for yourself, you can't go wrong with these.

Update: Now that I've watched more of the series, it's amazing how far in-depth some of the stories go. As a Baltimore Ravens fan I knew the story of the Colts leaving in the middle of the night and the band, but exactly how the band was able to keep their uniforms and the details of the story are amazing.
