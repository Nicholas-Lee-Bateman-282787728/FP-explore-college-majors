1901878,4,B0000A4GDT,"These two films may not be the best in the effects department, but they're great fun the whole family can enjoy. Plenty of adventure without the gory violence of some other versions of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's story. John Rhys-Davies and David Warner are always fun to watch. The players really seem to be into their parts and bring the story to life. The films are done very much in the tradition of the family adventure films of the 60's with great success. If your children love dinosaurs, but you'd rather not subject them to something as intense as the Jurassic Park films, then this is a wonderful alternative.",1141344000,32,616,4.660550458715596
1901879,2,B0000A4GDT,"The only reason I could give this film as many as 2 stars is due to the (over?)acting of John Rhys-Davies.  I just like the guy.  The story was growing whiskers when your grandfather read the book. You know the drill - professor discovers an isolated plateau in deepest, darkest Africa and sees (gasp) dinosaurs therein.  His expedition is diverted from going further by an attack perpetrated by his guide.  He returns to London having lost his pictures, notes and everything and when he tells his colleagues about his discovery, they laugh him out of the Royal Zoological Society or whatever.  (Dinosaurs? You've been hitting the sherry again, old chap) But by a clever ruse, he gets his most vocal opponent to agree to mount an expedition to go back to the ""lost world"" thus proving the prof's wild story.

So far, so good.  This is where things begin to go downhill.  The expedition is joined by a London journalist and a wealthy American photographer who for some reason agrees to fund the entire trip.  She sort of adds the love interest, if there actually is any.  When the expedition does reach the ""lost world,"" the flick hits rock bottom.  There are ""man eating"" dinosaurs, a local tribe that worships them, characters falling into pterodactyl caves, attacks by hostile tribes, friendly tribes that must be saved and even more hackneyed devices that have cluttered up genre movies since before King Kong and right up to the present.  The special effects are 1)pterodactyls soaring seen from a great distance (probably stock footage), 2)tyrannosaur heads popping up out of the foliage, 3) dinosaur eggs, 4)cute muppet-type hatchling dinosaurs 5)and so forth.  ""Jurassic Park"" it is NOT!

At the final scene in the Royal Zoological Society meeting to honor the prof, there were still naysayers that said pictures and eyewinesses meant nothing, the ""lost world"" was still a hoax.  The group then produced a basket out of which the ever-so-cute baby dino pokes its lovable head.  Everyone present in the hall gasped with surprise and seemed satisfied with this living proof of the prof's ""lost world.""  I wanted to shout out ""It's a puppet, you fools.""",1117843200,5,2157,4.898071625344353
1901880,4,B0000A4GDT,"Several attempts have been made to adapt Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's novel, THE LOST WORLD, to the silver screen.  The first was back in the days of silent film.  A later rendition was so short of funding that iguanas were used for all the dinosaurs (I hadn't known that tyrannosaurs walked on all fours or that a brontosaurus had a short neck).  The latest rendition stars John Rhys-Davies, as Professor Challenger, and David Warner, as Professor Summerlee.  I found this particular adaptation to be amusing and well done.  The script was close to the novel but had a number of interesting changes.
A young reporter is out to make a name for himself and his publisher points him in the direction of Professor Challenger.  After some fighting the two become friends.  Challenger then challenges the Royal Zoological Society to mount an expedition to verify or disprove his claims regarding the Lost World.  A team is put together and the expedition sets out.
After experiencing the treachery of a guide, the group find themselves atop a plateau inhabited by prehistoric animals and two tribes of natives.  One tribe worships the plant-eating dinosaurs and the other the carnivorous ones.  Unfortunately the plant-eaters are all getting sick while the carnivores are healthy.  Professor Summerlee deduces that a certain plant has medicinal qualities and is necessary for the dinosaurs' health.  This would explain why they still exist on the plateau.  Then the tribes are united and the intrepid explorers are guided through some caves that lead off of the plateau.  Just before leaving the adventurers vow to return to the Lost World.
John Rhys-Davies does an excellent job as the gruff and pompous Challenger.  The rest of the cast has been changed a little from the book to appeal to a greater audience.  The tribesmen on the plateau have also been changed.  No longer are they the equivalent of Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon but more resemble contemporary African tribes.  The dinosaur illness that was added as a thin explanation for the dinosaurs' survival was a little more in keeping with current thought than the original idea in the novel.  But other than these changes the movie really does capture the spirit of Doyle's novel if not the actual plot.  Dinosaur fans may find this movie a little lacking in that little was spent on the special effects.  The few dinosaurs seen are limited to feet and heads.  This does not detract from the movie but it is a major change from movies such as Jurassic Park.
So, all in all, this is a very enjoyable movie and one of the best movie adaptations of Professor Challenger that I have seen.  There is, of course, the excellent audio portrayal from Alien Voices.  So if you are looking for a bit of fun then The Lost World just might be your cup of tea.",1087344000,4,2797,4.815513626834382

1901899,4,B0000A4GDT,"Reporter Edward Malone talked professor Challenger into gloating Professor Summerlee in to proving that there is no lost world. Thus with a few other companions the adventure begins. Watch out for nefarious plots.

There have been several versions of Lost world based on the classic book by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. I doubt that this 1992 version with John Rhys-Davies as Professor Challenger is one of the best versions. There have been TV series after this and bound to be more.

In fact you can have the same people in Return to the Lost World (1992)",1509148800,,552,4.739583333333333

1901918,4,B0000A4GDT,"In THE LOST WORLD (1992), a reporter named Edward Malone (Eric McCormack) is assigned to write about Professor George Edward Challenger (John Rhys-Davies- RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK), a noted, though quite eccentric, scientist. After hearing Challenger's fantastic story of possible living dinosaurs, Malone joins an expedition to the location of the title. Leading the team, is Professor Summerlee (David Warner- THE OMEN, TIME AFTER TIME, TIME BANDITS), a well-known skeptic of all things Challenger! Also, photographer Jenny Nielson (Tamara Gorski) is along to chronicle everything w/ pictures. Rounding out the group is an eager 13 year old boy, named Jim (Darren Peter Mercer) and a beautiful -no, really, this is one of the most breath-taking women ever filmed!- interpreter named Malu (Nathania Stanford). Challenger himself meets up w/ them later. The adventure begins w/ an arduous journey up river, leading through the deep jungles of Africa (Zimbabwe). Next stop, a huge mesa, and a pterodactyl sighting! Climbing a sheer rock face gets the party to the top. The first dino-encounter proves harmless, but the next is a bit more... problematic. Other, toothier dangers arise. And then, there's the dinosaur-worshiping tribe, that sees Challenger and company as snacks for their hungry gods! This Movie is a nice, family-friendly update of the silent original (1925). Rhys-Davies is his usual, awesome self. Oh, and Malu has many scenes!... P.S.- Be sure to see RETURN TO THE LOST WORLD, w/ the very same cast! Oh yes, Malu returns as well!...",1503187200,2,1549,5.275303643724697

1901931,4,B0000A4GDT,"The lost world isn't as lost as one would think, since they manage to find it and almost explore it.  A lot of the movie is wasted on the setup, getting everyone involved in the expedition, getting them to the mysterious plateau, becoming stranded thanks to the duplicitous Gomez.  Once topside they realize they're not alone, other people live there.  And then there are the sad rubber-looking dinosaurs (they look like they were designed by Sid and Marty Krofft!).  I realize this was probably a project meant for children but still, these are dinosaurs, not H.R. Pufnstuf!  Making them cute didn't help.  As for part two, Return to the Lost World, they put two children in jeopardy, as the team reassembles to save the lost world from an evil scientist bent on discovering oil.  They also have to contend with the mostly absent villain from the first film, killer Gomez.  Location shooting almost helps the situation of dealing with stock situations and characters.  These two films are helped immeasurably by the performances of John Rhys-Davies as Professor Challenger and David Warner as Professor Summerlee.  Eric McCormack is almost adequate as the gung-ho reporter Edward Malone.  The rest of the cast more or less manage to make their roles work as intended.",1495324800,,1268,4.962085308056872

1902018,4,B0000A4GDT,"Review # 40: THIS REVIEW IS RATED PG-13!
I guess I'll mention a few things NOT in the other 39...

1.)===> I have the single-disc double feature.
2.)===> The openning and closing credits of BOTH films---filmed back-to-back, in 1992---are the same,
except the title card.
3.)===> A comment about how the boy had grown up was, well, ridiculous as the films were shot on Afri-
can location the same week!
4.)===> The second feature [RETURN TO THE LOST WORLD] has a nude scene---as seen from the rear,
so to speak. Perhaps my version is ""European""[?].
5.)===> These ARE feel-good family films, however---like I said---one of the film's ""hotties"" drops her sarong
and jumps in the lagoon naked...as seen from the rear. And a nice REAR it IS!
6.)===> There are NO complete dinosaurs seen except a pterodactyl seen from a distance---that I could just,
barely, see on MY 55"" TV. You see dinosaur FEET and heads... rubber, all. Acting is great, the SFX, rubbery.

1902077,4,B0000A4GDT,"Made over 20 years ago, this is the retelling of a classic and has a bonus - the sequel that came after it is included.

Starring some acting legends - John-Ryse Davies (Indiana Jones 1 & 3, Sliders), David Warner (Star Trek V & VI, Time After Time, Time Bandits) and the then unknown but always working Eric McCormack (Will and Grace) the adventure takes them on a journey to prove the lost world exists. Eric is quite good and funny in the role as the reporter looking for the scoop!

Harmony Gold is the production company and the special effects are a little trite, but the chemistry of the characters is fun and the story is basically true to the original. There are a few additions that they need to give license to so the story could be more timely.

Filled with action, suspense, drama and humor - it is a 90 minute romp through Africa to find the most artificial looking Dinosaurs I have ever seen. But ignoreing the technology of the late 80's..it is is fun.

The three disc set includes the sequal which furthers the adventure sof the six travelers complete with their idiosyncracies and issues and an even more glorious threat - man will destroy the Dinosaurs in the lost world!

The third disc is an only early 80's movie ""The Mummy's Revenge"" - A very bad B type film with gory effects and artificial mummy's . I laughed a lot but it was fun to see the 80's wardrobe and haircuts.

1902079,3,B0000A4GDT,"This 1992 adaptation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's fantastic book, ""The Lost World,"" is good but falls shy of being great. John Rhys-Davies is perfect for the role of Professor Challenger and David Warner is equally matched to the role of Professor Summerlee, but this story really calls for a much larger budget and a director that can handle the humor, and more importantly, the intense dramatic elements of Doyle's work with an eye for realism and believability.",1231200000,2,463,4.948717948717949
1902080,3,B0000A4GDT,"Conan Doyle's famous adventure story has been filmed many times before. The most notable version is, of course, the silent version made in 1925 and its stop-motion animation of dinosaurs (by Willis H. O'Brien). Now if you're looking for something like a huge dinosaur walking in the jungle, you should avoid this one. Though this was released only one year before ""Jurassic Park,"" the best special effects of this low-budget film is rubber puppets someone holding from under.

That does not mean `The Lost World"" (1992) is a joyless ride. Actually this is a pretty good, old-fashioned adventure film that you might have seen in the 1960s and thanks to the capable cast who knows what they are doing and the beautiful scenery, this film is a pretty enjoyable one. Prolific Welsh actor John Rhys-Davies is cast as Professor Challenger, and his credible portrait of the delightfully boisterous and pompous professor virtually carries the film.

David Warner is proud Professor Summerlee who is equally believable and amusing, and so is Eric McCormack (later known as Will of the popular TV series ""Will and Grace"") as Edward Malone. The original book's Lord John Roxton is replaced by American millionaire Jenny Nielson (Tamara Gorski), but sadly she has little to do in this tightly-written story which is fairly faithful to Doyle's book except they changed the location to Africa (the film is shot on location in Zimbabwe).

Again I say you should not expect the eye-popping special effects of Spielberg (or Stuart Orme-directed `The Lost World' made in 2001 f or that matter). This is an old-fashioned adventure film, and it works as such.",1170547200,7,1639,5.018382352941177
7995822,3,B0000A4GDT,"NOTE:  As of May 13, 2018, THE LOST WORLD and RETURN TO THE LOST WORLD are available for free streaming as two separate movies via Amazon Prime.  Amazon also lists the same shows as a pay for view TV series.

I recently re-read Doyle's LOST WORLD, so with that fresh in mind I streamed this movie via Amazon Prime.  I was pleasantly surprised at how closely the early part of the movie adhered to the book.  However, as the movie unfolded there were changes that I don't understand.  Lord John Roxton, one of the more interesting characters in the book, is dropped completely.  Three characters are added, Jenny Nielson, Malu and Jim.  Nielson is a wealthy American wildlife photographer who is added to the expedition because she agreed to finance it.  I'm not sure why she was added to the movie.  I thought that perhaps she was there to add a romantic  interest but if that was the intent, those scenes must have ended on the cutting room floor.  Malu, in her sarong, is primarily decorative, though she learns languages with astonishing rapidity.  Jim, all thirteen years of him, stows away on the ship carrying the expedition to Africa for ""adventure"".  I suppose the adults kept him around to run errands intead of leaving him with authorities at the port of call.  The inclusion of none of these characters added appreciably to Arthur Conan Doyle's story.

Of course deleting and adding characters is child's play for these movie makers.  They moved the entire Lost World from South America to Africa.  They then filmed in Zimbabwe.  The African geography around the Lost World is peculiar.  The expedition goes up river to the river village of  Kalemie.  They then depart down river into ""unsettled regions"", to search for the Lost World.  I would have to see a map.  The script is a little silly in places.  For example, professor Summerlee falls into a hole.  Malone runs to the edge and asks him if he is there.  Our 10 year old yelled, ""Where else would he be?"". Not long after this and having seen some very poor dinosaur special effects, she left me to it.  Those first hand puppet dinosaurs the expedition met were plant eaters, ""completely harmless"" according to one of the professors. The daughter snorted as she left the room.  She has heard of cape buffalo, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and elephants.  She has also heard the story of my cousin being stomped by a cow.  At the end we learn that in the Lost World dinosaur taxology has but two classifications - good ones  and bad ones.  The classification being based entirely upon diet.  Though pterodactyls seem to be classed as good ones even though they are carnivores.

If you are looking for dinosaur mayhem, look in another movie.  In this one there is a lot of talk about dinosaurs but only a few glimpses of parts of dinosaurs.  I don't remember seeing a whole animal except for distance shots of flying pterodactyls and, of course, Percy who must have used up the whole special effects budget.

These actors, particularly John Rhys-Davies, deserved a better script in a better movie.  Still, for a low budget sci-fi movie made before JURASSIC PARK, it is better than average.",1526083200,,3150,4.720588235294118
7995823,5,B0000A4GDT,"We thoroughly enjoyed The Lost World; however, if you are looking for the megabudget CGI spectaculars of the 21st century, your mileage may vary.

Released the year before Jurassic Park came out and caused a revolution in CGI rendering of dinosaurs, The Lost World depends mostly on puppets and superlative actors to deliver the story originally written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  It definitely does not disappoint.

John Rhys-Davies is his usual A-list boisterous best, combining humor with determination in the type of role where he excels.  David Warner's presentation of Professor Summerlee's character transition from nasty curmudgeon to supportive True Believer, at least when it comes to Prof. Challenger's dinosaurs, makes the story leap right off the page.

Alas for Gladys Hungerton; she plays a key role in the book as the motivation for Edward Malone to want to go off on an adventure and ""prove himself,"" but she does not appear in the movie.  Fans of Doyle's written work will see her presence implied by Malone's desire for such an adventure, but the film does not show the motivation for this peculiar goal.  We do, however, get remarkably beautiful Tamara Gorski's brilliant portrayal of Jenny Nielson, the wildlife photographer whose daddy ends up funding the whole expedition to The Lost World.",1524873600,,1314,5.140845070422535

7995827,1,B0000A4GDT,"Yet ANOTHER failed attempt to adapt Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's adventure yarn for the big screen.  What IS it about this story that makes it so cinematically cursed?

Despite a swift pace and a surprisingly great cast (with John Rhys-Davies, David Warner and Eric McCormack in the lead roles), the plot and visuals soon come unravelled when they reach their African destination, fairly early in the film.  The ""feminist"" and ""animal rights"" touches only erode the story further.

But the one thing that seemingly hobbles EVERY attempt to adapt this story to film are the dinosaurs.  The fantastic creatures of ""The Lost World"" have been rendered over the years through bad stop-motion animation, prosthetics-laden lizards and alligators, and outright puppetry...and, yes, this movie AGAIN gets it dreadfully wrong with rubber hand puppets.

I mean, Doyle's story is ALL ABOUT a great dinosaur reveal, but no theatrical version of his ""Lost World"" has EVER placed the proper emphasis on getting the bloody DINOSAURS right.

7995830,3,B0000A4GDT,"This film was released in 1992 and is actually a remake of a remake. This is not the blockbuster film based on Michael Crichton's novel. It is the based on the first novel by the name ""The Lost World"" that was written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in 1912. The first film based on this novel was released in 1925 and the second in 1960. The second was directed by the master of disaster, Irwin Allen, and had a cast that included Michael Rennie and Claude Rains. This third try was made at a time before CGI was a regular accouterment to motion pictures, so the special effects are not all that special. Done on a limited budget, the only sights of actual dinosaurs that you see are animatronic heads and a few isolated wings and claws. The rest is centered on the relations that the group of explorers end up making with a native tribe that populate the high plateau of prehistoric animals.
Set in 1912, it is told from the point of view of a young journalist who wants an adventure to make his career take off. He has been appointed to get an interview with the recalcitrant Dr. Challenger, a scientist and explorer who is given to fits of violent temper. Upon winning the doctor over, the journalist finds himself volunteering for an expedition to Africa to explore Challenger's ""lost world."" Along with them comes a stodgy fellow scientist who is bent on proving Challenger a fool, a female photographer whose family is financing the expedition, and a young boy who stows away so he can be with his friend, the journalist. What follows is about 90 minutes of African scenery (the filming was done in Zimbabwe) and lackluster adventure. The cast responsible for carrying this attempt at scientific adventure includes John Rhys-Davies, known for playing the dwarf Gimli in the Lord of the Rings movies, and David Warner, whose movie roles include a Klingon chancellor in ""Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country."" Along with them are Eric McCormack (Will & Grace) and Tamara Gorski (Hercules: The Legendary Journeys).

I had to walk to the single screen Mom & Pop owed theater in the snow two miles uphill both ways.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.
