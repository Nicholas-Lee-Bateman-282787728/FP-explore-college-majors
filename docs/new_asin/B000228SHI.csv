8020913,3,B000228SHI,"Never did I think that a man who could shoot bullets out of every part of his body could be so boring but The Occultist has proved me wrong. It's an interesting movie in the sense that they must've seen Blade Runner or read Neuromancer and suddenly thought lets combine that with our footage from a voodoo movie we couldn't complete. It's a Charles Band production. So, it's not too far from accurate most likely.

They certainly make the most of it. It's part Sandista conspiracy thriller, part voodoo horror, part William Gibson corporate nightmare world, and it's all touched up with Charles Band goofiness. It allows them to have a hero who looks like he walked in off the street, which he most likely did, and it not look completely out of place but definitely out of place.

It seems like it can't be boring but it somehow is. Sure there's tons of gratuitous sex and even a scene where a man pees bullets rapid fire to save himself (no joke). It's still a film that somehow manages to drag. Thankfully it's quick and there's at least a few memorable moments.

In a lot of ways, I'd rather see a documentary on how this movie got made rather than actually watching it. Something tells me it was a struggle to complete.",1487030400,4,1223,4.5
8020914,2,B000228SHI,"WARNING: SPOILERS - Tim Kincaid, famous director of adult films (both straight and gay) using the name ""Joe Gage"", took the last half of the 80's off from adult films to direct/write and sometimes produce a series of wacky and weird straight-to-DTV films (usually with Cynthia DePaula as the Producer [who just up and disappeared when these films ended, which makes me believe it was a pseudonym] and Charles Band as uncredited Executive Producer), ranging from action (RIOT ON 42ND ST. - 1985; ENEMY TERRITORY - 1987 [Producer only; received a theatrical release]), Women In Prison (BAD GIRLS DORMITORY - 1984; this one actually got a theatrical release), science fiction (ROBOT HOLOCAUST - 1986; MUTANT HUNT - 1987), horror (the infamous BREEDERS - 1986; NECROPOLIS - 1987 [Producer only]), comedy (SHE'S BACK - 1989) and this film, which is a strange mixture of detective/supernatural/science fiction genres. All of Kincaid's straight directorial efforts weren't your normal DTV crap. They were crap in their own special way, but that's not to say that some of them couldn't be enjoyable. Unfortunately, this movie can't be considered one of those films. It's more like an endurance test. We see a voodoo ritual where people (both black and white) are gyrating to native music (some women even go topless), while two men in tuxedos are begged to stop the voodoo ritual by a girl (she ends up garroted with a wire by one of the men). We then witness a man lying on a table at the voodoo ritual, his chest cut open with a huge knife by voodoo priestess Mama Dora (Betty Vaughn) and having his skin removed from his body while he screams. Soon-to-be groom Barney Sanford (Joe Reddig) has inherited a security firm from his deceased father and Barney is unintentionally running the company to the ground. We then see cyborg investigator Waldo Warren (Rick Gianisi) saving a girl from a kidnapping he was paid to protect. Also watching him are four mysterious men who want him dead. Barney can get a security contract from the country of San Caribe, a small (fictional) Caribbean island, but he is going to have to get Waldo Warren's help as protection (There is no explanation on why Waldo Warren is a cyborg. He just is.). Barney and Waldo meet in a bar and then go outside to talk, where Waldo must save Barney's life from a man & woman hit team. Another woman (Luz Vargas) explodes when Mama Dora puts a strange-looking bomb on her back. Barney and company executive Harold (Richard Mooney) go to San Caribe with female assistant Jane (Kate Goldsborough) and meet the island's President Davalos (Anibal Lleras) and his uptight, snotty wife Marianna (Mizan Nunes) at a party at the consulate. Those same four men are also there. One of the men is the head of a competing security firm named Ciprian Lane (Doug Delaughter) and his company has no scruples. They'll take jobs from known U.S. enemies if the price is right. Waldo is also at the party protecting the President's daughter Anjanette (Jennifer Kanter), when three black-hooded assassins with automatic weapons open fire, killing the President and nearly all the other people at the party. It looks like Barney's company is not doing such a great job securing the people, or is he purposely being sabotaged by Ciprian Lane, who wants the San Caribe account? Or is Marianna working in conjunction with the evil Colonel Esteves (Matt Mitler) for more nefarious means? As the camera pans across all the bloody dead bodies at the party, it gives the viewer enough time to figure out that the film has yet to make any sense. And where are Waldo's cyborg powers? Marianna is now in charge of San Caribe. Waldo informs anyone that is still alive (Barney, Harold and Jane made it) that the guard manning the security cameras was the first to die, his throat slit before he could set off the alarm. This means it must be an inside job. Colonel Esteves says it could only be Anjanette (That came out of his mouth a little too quickly and easily). Marianna tells Waldo that there are some people on her island who still believe in the ""Dumbala"" (voodoo) and will use any means possible to get rid of her. Seems like she is not involved in the assassination at all (at least not in the way it went off). Barney and Harold are attacked by the same male/female hit team we have seen throughout the film, but Barney and Harold fight them off (They are one of the worst hit teams in film history and are eventually killed later in the film. We never learn who hired them.). Marianne and Anjanette take Waldo to a voodoo ceremony, while Ciprian Lane and his men watch from above. Marianne walks through hot coals while Lane's men open fire. Waldo kills one of them and they run away. Turns out Marianne and Colonel Esteves were in on it, but Marianne swears it was never meant to go this far. Her husband was only meant to get injured. But it turns out the President is actually still alive, but Colonel Esteves deep-fries his face and kills him. The Colonel kills two voodoo men with a weird silver-chained object with a metal spiked skull on the end. It seems to be attached to a briefcase containing $17 million, stolen from the country's bank. The voodoo gang capture one of Ciprian Lane's men and Mama Dora kills both him and Marianne by stabbing them in the stomach, but Barney throws Mama Dora on the burning embers, she catches on fire and dies horribly. The voodoo group disappears into the darkness and Anjanette becomes the ruler of San Caribe, but first they have to escape the vengeful Colonel Esteves. Waldo makes his thumb and index and middle fingers into the shape of a gun and shoots the Colonel from below and the bullet exits out of the top of the Colonel's head. While Anjanette gives a press conference, Harold informs Barney that his bride-to-be has cancelled the wedding. All Barney can do is shrug his shoulders and try to make his business better.  This is one of Tim Kincaid's worst non-porn films, although there are a few funny scenes, such as when Waldo guns-down a couple of people in a Mens Room with his groin area (He tells Barney, ""This is going to cost you extra.""), which is actually an automatic weapon, or killing someone with a bullet that fires out of his foot (""I just had that installed.""). The screenplay, by Kincaid, is all over the place and leaves more unanswered questions than answered ones (The biggest ones being: What the heck happened to Ciprian Lane? Who created Waldo Warren?), the acting is worse than terrible (Rick Gianisi appeared in most of Kincaid's straight films, as well as ESCAPE FROM SAFEHAVEN - 1988; POSED FOR MURDER - 1989 and played the lead in Troma's SGT. KABUKIMAN N.Y.P.D - 1990. He hasn't appeared in anything since 2000.) and, even at 82 minutes, the film seems much too long. The only saving graces are a bit of nudity and the grisly makeup effects by Ed French, who gives us a skinning, Mama Dora's fiery death, the face-frying and multiple bloody bullet hits. Otherwise, I really fail to see what type of audience this film was made for. It's just a bunch of unrelated ideas strung together. Listen for music cues from CREEPOZOIDS (1987), SLAVE GIRLS FROM BEYOND INFINITY (1987) and CELLAR DWELLER (1987). Filmed entirely in New York City, most of it indoors so we don't have to see any tropical scenery. Also known as WALDO WARREN: PRIVATE DICK WITHOUT A BRAIN and MAXIMUM THRUST. Also starring Kevin Schmidt, Paul Mulder, Don Christopher Burke, Brent T. Whitney and the single-monickered Daphne, the last two as the terrible hit team. Originally released on VHS by Unicorn Home Video and later on fullscreen DVD by Full Moon Features. Charles Band has begun numbering the spines of all his releases and this one is Number 64. Tim Kincaid went back ""Joe Gage"" to make adult films, most of them of the all-male kind, right up until the time this review was written (2015). Unrated.",1450656000,,7902,4.709537572254336
8020915,2,B000228SHI,"This is the fourth and last of the direct to video efforts that Tim Kincaid wrote and directed for Charles Band between 1985 and 1987. As with ""Mutant Hunt,"" ""Breeders"" and ""Robot Holocaust"", this movie, originally called ""Maximum Thrust"", was shot in 10 days for around $100,000 and like those films it has production values and locations only a notch above the late 1960s, early 1970s work of NYC exploitation filmmakers like Doris Wishman and is far less enjoyable.

The story is kooky and somewhat ambitious given the budget. The lead character is a Six Million Dollar Man-like cyborg with replacement parts above and below the waistline, hence the original title.  He is protecting a visiting Caribbean president and his wife from various assasination attempts. The wife is played completely over the top and seems intended to resemble Imelda Marcos. Kincaid tries to inject a bit of social content by having the president's very serious daughter lament her parent's exploitation of the her poor countrymen. Meanwhile a group of former islanders with a surprising connection to the first family dance in a Brooklyn warehouse and skin various folks (cue some impressive Ed French make up effects).

Unfortunately, the direction is completely wooden. The camera remains locked down throughout and everything plays out in a master shot or a two shot, even the fight scenes. It feels like some of Andy Milligan's work in California from around the same time and probably could have benefited from shooting in 16 mm rather than 35 mm. Charles Band's post-production people probably spent less than a day editing the thing together and slapping on some canned music.

Two low-wattage highlights: the garroting of pre-""Rent"" Tony nominee Daphine Rubin-Vega in the opening few minutes and a subsequent scene in which a woman is blown up by a bomb implanted in her back and is clearly replaced by a cardboard cut-out just before the explosion.",1137024000,4,1939,5.068965517241379
8020916,2,B000228SHI,"This film might have worked if the budget was larger than a teenagers allowance. The ingredients for this movie stew include cyborgs, voodoo, political assasination and human sacrifice; all languidly mixed together and under-cooked.

I got about halfway through this grainy-filmed opus before I fell asleep. Do yourself a favor and skip this movie.",1136851200,,348,5.444444444444445
