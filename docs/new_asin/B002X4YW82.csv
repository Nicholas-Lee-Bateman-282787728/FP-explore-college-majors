8474741,5,B002X4YW82,"Petenera captures the essence of Flamenco. The artistic performance and cinematography makes the viewer feel as if watching the performance live. It is a jewel of flamenco, truly a rare find put on video. The extra material provides essential background of Petenera and insight into the artistic and intellectual excellence of the artists. Enjoyable for both aficionado and novice of Flamenco.",1275350400,,393,5.459016393442623
