6033789,4,B00FWMVVJ0,was awesome seeing that car I remember as a kid. would still love to have that car today with the flashing light,1401840000,,112,4.136363636363637
6033790,5,B00FWMVVJ0,"Ordered it as a gift for stroke guy -he is totally into 80's themed tv series and loves it. Ordered also magnum pi, A-team, dukes of hazards, Charlie's angels and he loves them all.",1399852800,,181,4.352941176470588
6033791,5,B00FWMVVJ0,"This is the first season of Knight Rider, and its great to see how Mike Knight and get develop their relationship. The dvd is great quality and the box set is good.",1399334400,,164,4.15625
6033792,5,B00FWMVVJ0,Everything was as I anticipated it to be. Good quality and sound. It was just like watching it on t.v. the way it used to be in the good old days.,1399161600,,146,3.7419354838709675
6033793,4,B00FWMVVJ0,"The dvds are good, but the volume sucks, have turn turn it up one minute and turn it down the next. In some scenes, look close up use a little noise in the background, like a snowy picture but other then the volume, it's good.",1398816000,,226,4.044444444444444
6033794,4,B00FWMVVJ0,"Honestly I bought this season for the special feature Knight Rider 2000, (It was one of my favorite movies as a kid).  The TV show itself is interesting, mostly for spotting some of the actors who made one time roles on the show.  The first season by itself is decent enough.  I am considering getting the other seasons, but price will determine when that happens.",1397779200,2,364,4.569230769230769
6033835,5,B00FWMVVJ0,Got it for a friend.,1491091200,,20,3.2
6033836,1,B00FWMVVJ0,Second disc will not play,1490832000,,25,4.2
6033837,5,B00FWMVVJ0,Great movie series. Purchased this for a friend for a gift and he loved it! Came in fast and packaged neatly,1490659200,,108,4.190476190476191
6033838,5,B00FWMVVJ0,"OK, so you feel you have a hard time finding things to watch that are clean enough.  If you are having a hard time finding something to watch and are looking for the next one this will work just fine.  This one is good for that.  That's the point.  And it's not too violent and not really sexual at all.  It has action, yet it is relaxing.  This goes for all of the seasons.

The show kind of reminds me of the original Star Trek in that the creator uses foils, or people with opposite personalities, that play off each other to make the show feel like you have more interesting company in your living room.  Mind you, that's a loose comparison and I don't have many other ones or I might use them, but it's an easy example to get and the creator is known for using formulas that people like.  They could have been serious like other shows have been and been boring and tedious, but they chose to go this route instead.  There is no stressful interaction between the characters, so you won't be getting off work only to have more stress.  The professional critic who reviewed the season I was reading about said that the dialogue was horribly written and I think he is way off base.  He should stick to reviewing edgy shows if that's the only kind of show that he thinks is up to his standards.  The show's characters are likeable.  We like following David Hasselhoff around and seeing him make a difference being a hero and we feel good about it in the last scene rather than wrung out.  We like his car and we like that his car talks and we like the friendship between the two.  Whether talking machines are a current thing or not may be an interesting point, but the real point is that the personality the car has is good.  The characters in all of the seasons are good and likeable and well crafted and mesh just fine.  I won't spoil it by going into it more than that, but for the people I am writing this review for, this show will work fine.  There's nothing in it that I can remember that would be unfit for some viewers.  When I was a kid the show was on and that's my perspective too.  It's an innocent show versus shows that have come after that feel they have to try to shock you to entertain.  This show grabs you at the beginning, but if you want a show that is edgy and shocks you, I would recommend against it.  For those of whom want these things in it I mention in it to chill out with, it will be fine.",1487808000,,2421,4.192640692640692

6033858,5,B00FWMVVJ0,This version is better because 1. One-Sided as opposed to the previous version that was Double-Sided 2. A better case. This version has a wrap around cover art that fits in the outer part of case between the case and the clear outer sleeve. I like to replace the cases so I like these kind of cases.,1463875200,,299,4.2631578947368425

6033860,5,B00FWMVVJ0,"In 1983 I was captivated by the show and used to enjoy watching it, that was when I was 17 years old, now being over 50 and a bit more selective about my taste I was not sure about watching this show again and if it had aged nicely considering the advances in Computers, self-driving and parking cars, cameras and GPS and talking Devices and Assistants. To my Surprise, the Hoff and KITT and the whole show was as captivating and entertaining as it was when I first saw it. The action, dialog and KITTs sarcasm makes the show alive and enjoyable. The guest stars and stories are intriguing and thrilling, few techno-babble rubbish as in some of todays goofy shows, good music and good action (real action  with no overdone CGI).  Its Fun, your kids or grand kids may join you and see what it was like to be back in the 80s. I have ordered the 3 remaining seasons and looking forward to watching the whole series over the coming month.",1457568000,,934,4.393063583815029

6033863,5,B00FWMVVJ0,"Michael Long is a policeman, while investigating someone, he was shot and left for dead. But a millionaire, Wilton Knight finds him and saves him and gives him a new face. It seems that Knight wants to wage a war against criminals who operate above the law. And Michael is the man he has chosen to wage that war. He has created the ultimate car, the Knight Industries Two Thousand or KITT, which is laced with a virtually indestructible alloy, and is also capable of moving on its own and also talks. He gives the car to Michael, and gives him the new identity of Michael Knight. Michael is assisted by one of Knight's associates, Devon Miles. Bonnie is the mechanic who takes care of KITT. During the second season Bonnie was replaced by April, as the new mechanic. The following season she left and Bonnie returned. The next season they acquired a new member, Reginald Cornelius III or RC3.",1455580800,,892,4.58125

6033914,2,B00FWMVVJ0,"Don't get me wrong i Love Knight rider, one of my favourite 80'S tv series
the first release of seasons 1,2,3,4, that universal released was back in 2004
with all new making of featurettes about 15mins each featurette
about 1 hours worth of new interviews with David Hasslehoff, Glen a Larson,
composer stu Phillips who did the Theme song for Knight rider
Patricia McPherson wasn't interviewed for some reason
and David Mulhare passed away many years ago

and now i find out that Universal have re-released/re-issued all 4 seasons again
so i did some research before i might've bought it
i found out that all universal has done has repackaged all the Discs with new cover art in
clamshell cases with Disc trays that's all
there are no new extras, no new interviews at all,
there's no new Audio mix, it's the same Audio quality as the 2004 version
it is exactly the same as the previous seasons released on DVD years ago
season 2,3 and 4 re-issues are exactly the same as the 2004 releases
so i believe whether you buy the original 2004 dvd releases or these new 2014 re-issues of all 4 seasons
it make's no difference at all
except the packaging and cover art is different for the 2014 versions that's all
cause the 2004 release was a foldout Digi pack packaging,

very very pathetic effort by universal, why do another dvd re-issue of a classic 80's tv series
when all seasons can be re-issued on blu-ray with all new clearer picture and new Master audio quality
it makes no sense to me at all,
i know there's only been one 80'S tv series that has been released on blu-ray is AIRWOLF
Knight rider, Miami vice have yet to be released on Blu-ray if it ever happens

So if you buy this new 2014 version of Knight rider your just buying the repackaging that's all
new clamshell cases with Disc trays
and it's the same thing with season 2,3 and 4 they've been repackaged in clamshell cases
so i just gave this season one 2 stars,",1405900800,,1925,4.494285714285715
8618912,5,B00FWMVVJ0,Knight Rider Season 1 very wisely has the pilot first episode on how Michael Knight and KITT came to be. The beginning of the series you get to ride along with Michael and KITT and get to see how the friendship/partnership just improved. KITT (Knight Industry Two Thousand) is an extraordinary car that has the ability to function on his own and assist Michael in solving the problems above the law that can't be fought any other way. (William Daniels) is KITT's voice and David Hasselhoff are a perfect combination. If you like Richard Basehart (Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea) is Wilton Knight who is dying and wants to make a difference in the world. Edward Mulhare(Devon MIles) is the assistant in the foundation to help with cases that Michael and KITT will work on. Patricia McPherson(mechanic) for KITT also joins the cast. The series is a truly gifted show from the classic tv of 1980's. Glen Larson's creation(Battlestar Galactica series) continues his rich gifts of creating a show that you want to watch over and over again.,1528675200,,1036,4.761111111111111
