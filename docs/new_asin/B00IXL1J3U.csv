6303791,3,B00IXL1J3U,Love the anime but I don't know why on the amazon site it says dubbed when it's only in Japanese. Besides that if you don't mind reading your animes it's great.,1405900800,7,160,4.193548387096774
6303792,5,B00IXL1J3U,"I already loved this anim before I even bought the series. I had originally watched it on Hulu, several times, I might add. It's definitely been one of my favorites since I first watched it. :3",1476144000,,193,4.388888888888889

6303795,5,B00IXL1J3U,"Beautiful animation, and the behind the scenes are great. I absolutely loved this series.
It is very stylized and has a rather old-timey feel to it. The themes are adult, so I wouldn't reccomend it for someone really young.",1464048000,,223,4.743589743589744
6303796,1,B00IXL1J3U,"I purchased this DVD specifically because it is listed as dubbed in English. I received it today and discovered a weak bootleg copy of an anime with only Japanese audio and English subtitles. This product is not as listed and I am strongly disappointed. I love this series and was looking forward to watching it with a friend that suffers from dyslexia. Now, obviously, I cannot.",1462752000,17,379,4.757575757575758

6303798,5,B00IXL1J3U,It reminds me of the Kabuki theater. I am glad they kept the original sound track and not replaced the Japanese language with English. I love the graphics and anime. It seems classical as I am not an anime follower. I have purchased two episodes. So far I enjoyed the storyline. I just wish Amazon offer to purchase the whole season rather than each episode.,1457481600,,358,4.523076923076923

6303802,5,B00IXL1J3U,"This is so beautiful, the stories are amazing and it makes me feel ALL the feels. It does have a horror theme, but there are no jumpscares. It has humor and seriousness. The medicine man is pretty badass. This show satisfies me so much. Definitely worth the purchase. Will watch again and again.",1454284800,,295,4.584905660377358
6303803,5,B00IXL1J3U,"Let us first establish that I am a scaredy cat, a big one, but I can put that aside for great stories. I adored all of the stories Mononoke had to tell and after binge watching it on Crunchyroll, I knew I had to have it.

If you are a fan of the occult detective genre, stuff like Mushi-shi for example, this should be a no brainer. If you love a good historical anime and lots of color like me, it also fits the bill very nicely. This anime isn't for everyone as it is gory and confusing at times but it has its humor and heartwarming moments as well. Final verdict is that Mononoke is an underrated anime that was well worth the $8 I paid for it and I encourage you to check it out.",1452643200,,684,3.9927007299270074

I had bought if for my wife as soon as I saw ""dubbed: English"" in the description as we loved the original episodes in the Ayakashi series. I should have checked the reviews as what I thought was too good to be true was indeed not true.",1445126400,,303,3.9836065573770494
6303810,5,B00IXL1J3U,Beautiful anime! Definitely needs more appreciation! I'm glad this finally got a DVD release in the US.,1441670400,,103,5.117647058823529
6303811,5,B00IXL1J3U,"I fell in love with the character and art style of the ""bakeneko"" story in Ayakashi - Samurai Horror Tales. So when they let the medicine seller have his own series I was thrilled. I was very surprised that it was released on dvd outside of Japan. I had to have it and I'm very pleased!",1441411200,,286,4.125
6303812,1,B00IXL1J3U,"I picked this up because it looks interesting.
I could not stomach more than 20 minutes before it put it back in the dvd case.  Though ""artistic"" the animation is awful.  The artsy nature wears off quickly when trying to follow the story and you get cuts of abstract gabage as filler.
 I might try it again one day when i cant think of anything else to watch.",1438905600,,359,4.25
6303813,3,B00IXL1J3U,"This show is fantastic. I bought the DVD because I'm a big fan of it, but unfortunately, the translation and visual fidelity on this DVD printing fail to live up to other treatments of the show, such as from Shinsen and Crunchyroll, that can be seen online in a number of places. It's not very important, but in speaking to the quality of the DVD release, it looks like the writing on the back of the case was never proofread, either.",1435881600,5,434,4.37037037037037

6303815,5,B00IXL1J3U,"This is by far one of my favorite animes of all time! I love the art style and the different topics that this anime goes into, it does a great job of portraying the madness and evil that lies in everyone and the reasoning behind it. It's a little graphic, but no where near as graphic as other animes that are out there. It was well worth the money!",1432166400,,349,4.072463768115942
6303816,1,B00IXL1J3U,I'm not really happy with it. It was advertised on amazon as having English Dubbing ~ that wasn't the case.,1431648000,3,107,4.4
6303817,5,B00IXL1J3U,EXCELLENT!  GREAT ANIME.  DOES NOT INSULT MY INTELLIGENT.,1430438400,,57,6.0
6303818,5,B00IXL1J3U,"Mononoke consists of twelve episodes that feature five stories that span two to three episodes each. There is no English dubbing; it is all in the Japanese language with English subtitling.

Mononoke features a man called the Medicine Seller, who seeks out supernatural beings called Mononoke that effect the mortal world in dubious ways. He must ascertain their true form, the truth of their nature, and the reason for their being before he can destroy them. The show beautifully captures traditional Japanese art and is a treat for the eyes. Each story is a well written, heart-breaking piece that delves into the dark aspects of human nature. It is often hard to see the Mononoke as dangerous monsters when the things that humans inflict upon one another is so often worse or is the cause of the Mononoke's existence and its torment.",1428883200,8,836,4.887323943661972
6303819,5,B00IXL1J3U,"I love this anime! I've waited a long time for it to come to the US. It's a bit of a disappointment that there's no dub though (don't know why Amazon advertised it as dub). My favorite story is actually the Goblin Cat from its prequel-ish Samurai Horror Tales, but this series is pretty memorable on its own. It's truly 1 of the most beautiful anime I've seen, and I don't just mean its unique animation and colors.
5 stars for the series
3 1/2 stars for no dub",1424908800,4,461,4.191011235955056
6303820,5,B00IXL1J3U,"Truth be told, as like many others, I am a fan of the medicine peddler character. While my favorite story with the medicine peddler is Goblin Cat from the Samurai Horror Tales series, the collection here has some great stories as well. I enjoyed all the stories but I didn't love all of them. I found one or two stories a little slow. The animation is brilliant and different than what one might expect from traditional animation. Get this for the gorgeous animation and the medicine peddler.",1423958400,,492,4.666666666666667

6303823,4,B00IXL1J3U,"This is a series with a very different art style that takes a little getting used to. The first few episodes aren't bad, but they weren't great, either; I stopped watching after I finished the first disk but came back a week later and finished the last five episodes in an afternoon. Those last five episodes are worth the price of admission alone and will bring me back to the series again at some point in the future. If you're a fan of slower-paced anime with mysteries that need to be solved (similar to Mushishi), consider taking a look at this one.",1420156800,,554,4.4411764705882355
6303824,5,B00IXL1J3U,"I waited a while for this to be released in the States. Really enjoyed the 'Goblin Cat' and followed Anime Network and other on-line anime sites to keep track of when 'Mononoke' would be released. Although the stories are more sad and about regret than scary, the art, script and voice acting make this a keeper. Thanks Amazon for offering it at the lowest price and delivering it as promised even on a holiday.",1418256000,,411,4.5675675675675675
6303825,5,B00IXL1J3U,"Some of the stories are slightly confusing, even with prior knowledge of Japanese folklore. The animation style is absolutely gorgeous. I wish the series ran longer. Pretty weird/creepy stuff! Mushishi for adults.",1417219200,,213,5.6875
6303826,4,B00IXL1J3U,"Horror anime is a really weird genre, and this fits in that group really well. its creepy and its art is GORGEOUS. the translation is kind of meh and if you don't know some of the contextual background you can get lost. also heavy in the symbolism. but still, I  Love this anime",1415059200,,278,4.245283018867925

6303828,5,B00IXL1J3U,"First, do not confuse this Mononoke anime series with Hayao Miyazaki's ""Princess Mononoke"" anime movie, as this one is entirely different.
Nevertheless, this is definitely an anime worth watching.  A series of supernatural mystery stories that is a refreshing change of pace apart from the usual reused anime style and plot-line that we see coming out of Japan lately.  The animation style is very intricate and colorful, and the episodes are directed as it was a play in a stage theater.  The main character himself maintains an enigmatic aura about him that captivates you, as much as he does to the other characters in the story.
If you like anime for the artform, then this is one title you must add to your collection.",1414540800,,723,4.814516129032258
6303829,5,B00IXL1J3U,"Other than the false advertising on this page that says it has an English audio track, I highly reccomended this anime. Its vivid and beautiful drawing a long with the mysterious and ominous stories make it must see for art buffs and anime fans alike. Great anime!",1410652800,4,264,4.638297872340425
6303830,5,B00IXL1J3U,"Mononoke is an extraordinary anime series, memorable not only for its breathtaking and unique art but also for its look into the dark depths of human nature.

Mononoke is a spinoff series based on the third story of Ayakashi: Samurai Horror Tales, also known as the Bakeneko (Goblin Cat) Arc. This 12-episode series features the hero of the Bakeneko Arc, the mysterious Medicine Seller.

Set in the Edo Period, the Medicine Seller travels around Japan exorcizing ""mononoke,"" or spirits left behind in the material world, usually because of an unsolved crime.

As can be seen just from the DVD box set cover - the art in Mononoke is simply amazing. Taking traditional Japanese aesthetics and expanding on them with a profusion of colors, overlays of western themes, and fantastical imagery, the visuals in Mononoke create a universe unto itself.

The visual color riot rivets one's gaze, while the stories break your heart. Mononoke is comprised of short stories, each 2-3 episodes long, and each taking the viewer into the darkest parts of the human heart. Occasionally there is redemption, but most of the stories leave you with a quiet sadness about the suffering that humans wreak upon each other.

If you're new to anime, you may want to watch other more popular anime series before trying Mononoke. Mononoke's storytelling style is different and not easy to understand at first. Also, I would say Mononoke probably shouldn't be watched by anyone under 14 years old. These are horror stories with adult themes.",1409702400,24,1514,5.01593625498008
6303831,5,B00IXL1J3U,"I LOVE the twists in this anime! It will keep you interested although the art style and storytelling form takes some getting used to if you're not familiar with it. Also, it IS horror based and NOT for children or faint of heart. I have been waiting 7 years for an English translation to be available even if it is only subbed and not dubbed. I also hope the manga gets translated soon too and that it eventually does get an English dub.",1405987200,13,437,4.27710843373494

8646024,5,B00IXL1J3U,A solid show and the DVD was of good quality.,1509667200,,45,3.6
8646025,5,B00IXL1J3U,"This is truly a special 'moving painting' of a show- it's MORE than an anime. The stories are fascinating, the main character: Kusriuri ('Medicine Seller'); enigmatic. As my High Schooler calls it:, more 'animation', than 'anime'. 'Ayakashi's (#3) & 'Mononoke's art is done on rice paper & scenes within the story use the old theater style where scenes are divided by closing/opening sliding doors.
This show is a spinoff of the 3rd story from the 'Ayakashi: Samurai Horror Tales' disc, entitled 'Bake Neko' (demon cat). The reception of the 'Bake Neko' story was SO POPULAR, they created this show from it.

NOTE: there is a 'Bake Neko' on THIS disc as well, but in a different time period, & has a different storyline. Seeing the 'Ayakashi'-pilot HELPS in understanding a LOT about the show & reveals SOME of the mysterious main character's backstory & what he has in his 'arsenal' of tools. The stories, themselves are based on historic Japanese tales, as 'Ayaksahi' is, but a little more loosely. I LOVE the Japanese Horror genre, & THIS is THE BEST in the genre & in my Top 3 favorites, OVER ALL. Even if you aren't into 'horror', there is a 'mystery', 'historical' & even a 'deadpan humor' component to the stories, in the same way as 'Requiem from the Darkness', does. The soundtrack is beautiful & accentuates the sadness or anger of the 'Mononoke' (='sick spirit') that is 'formed by' negativity & regret. Kusuriuri finds them once a Mononoke obtains a form to 'step-over into our plane'. 'Ayakashi's' 'Bake Neko' should be seen FIRST, which is probably WHY this disc is so inexpensive & the 'Ayakashi' disc IS expensive.
The three aforementioned shows are NOT like the HORRO/FOLKTALES currently showing. They're still-drawings, with a narrator. 'Ayakashi', 'Mononoke' & 'Requiem' are fully animated.
Snatch this disc up & if there isn't a reasonably price 'Ayakashi' (pilot); just wait. You'll find one!
WHOEVER OWNS the RIGHTS to the TWO SHOULD COMBINE THEM AS A SET. (The ONLY complaints I have are the need to make the set 'whole' & it would be wonderful to have MORE stories. -I would BUY A BOX-SET IN A HEARTBEAT!)
THIS is one of the few anime that have emotionally 'moved me'. Art or anime fan; YOU WILL NOT be sorry to obtain the TWO.

8646026,5,B00IXL1J3U,"This is one of my top anime series of all time.

It is a continuation of the ""medicine seller"" stories that began as the final arc of Ayakashi Samurai Horror Tales called ""Bake Neko.""

I just came by here to observe that the entire series streams on Crunchyroll without per-episode payments.

8646029,5,B00IXL1J3U,"A visual, mental, and emotional rollercoaster that shocks just as much as it amazes. The Moving Plaid art style is pretty rare among anime, and the rich colors and patterns are used in complimentary, contrasting, and eyecatching ways that will have you rewatching even small blink-and-you'll miss it scenes over and over. Plotwise, Mononoke could be summarized as a supernatural mystical detective story so you can explain it to anyone just passing by, but the fundamentals that move each of the story arcs makes it far more complex. Paired with superb voice acting, musical and sound effect accompaniment [you'll never get tired of the wood block clapping], Mononoke is a standout example of what kind of stories and experiences anime can express.

Each of the five arcs covers a different encounter with a Mononke, and the Medicine Seller's quest to slay it. It may seem obvious from the start what must be done, or who the true culprit is, but what is shown is not always as it seems. If you watch them in order, by the time you get to Nue, you will probably be untrustworthy of even the most passive characters, waiting for the gruesome or tragic ends to unfold. While the endings can be dark, none are particularly depressing, but can be very ambiguous. Even years later I've watched this series again and again and still change my mind on how things ended up.

I also personally find Medicine Seller's transformation sequences to be some of the most beautiful not just in similar genres of magical girls [and now magical boys], but in animation in general. The aforementioned Moving Plaid makes the unearthly, divine aspects of Medicine Seller's person more prominent, and even the briefest scenes of that form in action are worth waiting for the buildup of the rest of the episodes.

I can't recommend the series enough.",1480982400,4,1827,4.8493589743589745
8646030,5,B00IXL1J3U,"I like to call anime like this ""moral horror"" since each story has a moral to it where the villain gets slapped with karma. It's also beautifully animated. I actually saw this long before it came to the US but once it did, I bought it was quickly as possible. It's definitely an anime series you should check out. I believe it's subs only but to me, that doesn't matter.",1478304000,,370,4.3
