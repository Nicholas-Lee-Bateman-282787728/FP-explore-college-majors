8459227,4,B005650M7U,"This set was the only way I could get Mission Bloody Mary. It is a fine collection of movies. All are fun and two I have already reviewed.
Mission Bloody Mary is a fun and exciting movie full of great action and standard sixties spy movie hijinks. Ken Clark makes for a likeable hero who manages to thwart the villan and of course get the girl. These are some of the many Eurospy films that came out in competion with the Bond movies. These three movies are some of the best made at that time and are worth a viewing. I recommend this set for those into sixties spy or Dick Mallory fans.",1322611200,2,587,4.20353982300885
8459228,4,B005650M7U,"Remembered the Italian secret agent films of the sixties when aired on TV decades ago and started to do some research last week and that is when I first became familiar with Ken Clark as CIA Agent 077, catching some trailers on You Tube.

Thoroughly enjoyed the 077 trilogy.  Ken Clark was great as a suave secret agent and there was plenty of action in each of the three.  I think he would have made a great Bond for he resembles Roger Moore yet is as physical in the abundant amount of fight scenes as Connery, Lazenby or Craig.  Plenty of shooting too. The music isn't bad either and the opening titles are quite good. Yes, there is a lot of imitation of 007 in these films but there is also originality in them too.  The producers made the most of their low budgets.

For low budget films more than 45 years old, the transfers are quite good.  One disappointment is that the enhanced wide screen transfer is actually stretched to fit a 16x9 screen thus everything appears thinner than natural.  One way to resolve this is to change the settings of your DVD player to output at 480p,change the TV monitor to 4x3 and use the letterbox format.  The zoom mode then fills the screen properly.

So if you're a fan of 007, then 077 won't disappoint.",1316995200,6,1246,4.425438596491228
