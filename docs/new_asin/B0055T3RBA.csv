4581117,5,B0055T3RBA,"One of the best documentaries I've seen. Whether Afghanistan, Iraq, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, or any number of countless basket-case countries, the villagers always have the true take on what is happening and who the ultimate victor will be. They always have the certainty of knowing they will be the loser, no matter what government arises to trample them. We go in with the best intentions, always thinking we know best; we always leave disappointed in the natives, having imagined that we knew best. The more jaded of us knew immediately when we saw the little dwarf-like villager in Marjah interacting with the Marines early in the film -- we knew what his ultimate fate would be, without doubt. Thanks to the film's makers for being honest enough to tell us at the conclusion.",1318636800,6,780,4.87218045112782
4581118,5,B0055T3RBA,"This is an amazing piece of work. I can't believe someone had the balls to film this. It's honest, shot really well. A great documentary with material as live and raw as you can get.
Really worth watching!
If you have watched generation kill it's the really life version !",1315094400,17,272,4.46
4581119,5,B0055T3RBA,"If you're not bound to the ever optimistic US rhetoric of War and would prefer something a little more insightful and impartial than the Oscar nominated Restrepo, I highly recommend The Battle for Marjah.

An honest attempt to assess operation Moshtarak in Afghanistan, focusing on the seemingly endless struggles that both local people and US Marines are faced with on a daily basis. It is a story we have seen throughout the 20th century, futile attempts by a government determined to leave a war zone with some evidence of 'success' to justify lives lost.

The film at least is refreshingly thoughtful, and perhaps as objective as one could possibly be when faced with the hard hitting reality of what happens in a faraway land when orders are made in Washington or Westminster.",1311897600,3,781,4.909090909090909
4581120,4,B0055T3RBA,"IN YOUR FACE WAR COMBAT. Not a glitzy documentary of a battle, but camera within the troops as they attempt to change the are in Afghanistan, specifically the Marjah Taliban stronghold town. Expect war and all it entails. Language, death, injury and frustration. If you have never been in combat, here is an opportunity to witness it first-hand, almost. The British reporter, Ben Anderson, goes in alongside Bravo Company with his camera. Anderson is producer, writer, and film photographer of this event to show the WHO-HOW-WHAT-WHERE of an actual offensive began on February 13, 2010. The WHY is left open for the viewer to answer. Who gains? You may have a problem with your own answer after seeing this feature-length footage that covers one US Marine unit that was supposedly a part of a coalition force. Ha!

These are real Marines, tough in action and language, and the action is real. Even the cameraman risks life as shown in the footage. Throughout the footage of events there is occasional text notes added to explain what is happening, or why. All of the filmed warfare, foxhole interviews, etc comes with SUBTITLES. Adult due to very strong language, disturbing images, war violence, and war graphic scenes. It's the REAL McCoy!

Not a wise choice for ladies with children stationed in Afghanistan. Hopefully this DVD will get some comments/reviews from former Afghanistan deployed American soldiers. What you see is an ongoing result of 9/11. Will it ever end? This is a difficult DVD set to rank. It is top notch in presenting truth without bias worthy of 5-stars. But the constant grind of disturbing footage and events can't really be called entertaining. Enlightening-perhaps! Compelling-YES! FACT: war documentary footage is no ""Mary Poppins.""

Bonus includes a viewer's guide with added info. ""America's Longest War"" time log. Text bios of Anderson and the photographer who shot the cover art.

This set is 2 discs. One is regular DVD, the other id Blu-ray. Both for one money. I found this company's earlier war release set ""WEAPONS RACES"" much more educational and less emotional in nature. But it's all war.",1310860800,41,2130,5.025495750708215
4581151,5,B0055T3RBA,"While the documentary is about Bravo 1/6, my fianc&eacute; continues to serve with Lima 3/6. They were with 1/6 during the assault into Marjah. The film makers must have done something right in order for him to simply get up and go outside in the middle of it. I don't know what it must have been like, but seeing something in his eyes when I went outside to be near him it has to get to you after 4 deployments.",1445990400,,412,4.1625

This documentary is as real as they come, showing the true side of war. From our insert to our take over of the ""pork chop"" and so forth, this is one of the best war documentaries i have ever seen. I would recommend this to anyone looking to get a true insite into war and those that want to watch it from the safety of their homes. I lost alot of Brothers in this battle and it depicts 1/6 B CO pretty well. This is a must own. AND FOR MY 1/6 BROTHERS, Semper Fi on our 4 year anniv. I hope you all are doing well.

4581168,3,B0055T3RBA,"... But its the *score* that causes one to do so.

Real life documentaries, told from this immediate perspective, should do without the emotional prods of a musical score. It does a disservice to the reality to assume that the reality itself is somehow insufficient. Because of that, this bit of coverage of a tactical team`s operations in the field is less-than.

The scope of the show also does not dare to explore the underpinning philosophies supposedly at play here... which is absurdly silly given it is War: we should always be exploring the Whys of War. Real people die. We must question such necessities.

This show does absolutely none of that. It is only what it is.",1363046400,,677,4.720338983050848
4581169,3,B0055T3RBA,"As the story of B Company, 1/6 Marines, ""The Battle for Marjah"" does a reasonable job of showing what the soldiers went through.

That said, I note some of the marketing messaging saying ""Follow Bravo Company, 1st Battalion, 6th Marines into the heart of the war in Afghanistan"".  If this was REALLY the point of the film, why was so much time spent on ANOTHER company's civilian casualties and the aftermath of that tragic mistake?

It certainly leaves the film-makers open to an accusation of bias - ""hey, this group didn't kill any civilians, let's show this OTHER group doing that!""",1357084800,,586,4.782178217821782

4581185,1,B0055T3RBA,"Where to begin... having seen much better documentaries on Afghanistan (e.g. ""Armadillo"") I suppose I am somewhat biased (and FYI I'm deployed in Afghanistan right now), but expected much more from HBO.  The main thing that annoyed me about this film was that it was too fast paced for the length of the film and the amount of info it was trying to cover.  The editing is very shotty throughout and the director seems like he doesn't really have a message he's trying to convey, other than America is screwing up Afghanistan merely by it's presence- which is BS because the country has only made progress since we began our mission there.

There are many more negatives than positives in the film (even the occasional music is dreary), especially when it comes to US casualties vs Taliban killed. The director does not attempt to follow up on any of the battles but just moves on, focusing on American and civilian casualties.  The translation scenes and long shots of locals attempt to make the viewer feel like we are just messing everything up, everyone is always repulsed, angry, frowning, etc.  They didn't put in any shots of the kids joking and playing around, or any grateful locals... just the bad stuff.  I know first hand many locals are happy to see us and work with us.  I see kids playing around the base and adults playing soccer all the time.  The point is this is just another negative outlook on the war in Afghanistan and it's nothing you can't read for yourself from a Liberal news source.

Definitely no need for Blue-Ray quality as there's nothing noteworthy for style, imagery, or action in this film.  Just a jumbled compilation that doesn't give nearly enough details of a 6+month long Marine operation.  This was definitely a one-timer and I will be giving it away.",1325289600,42,1791,4.708333333333333

4581187,3,B0055T3RBA,I don't think this documentary even began to explain the entire situation over there.  The view given is kind of one sided and potentially quite misleading.,1322438400,2,156,5.0
4581188,5,B0055T3RBA,"My two sons are featured in this documentary.  Cpl. George Godwin provides his personal perspective as a new father engaging the Taliban in an effort to take control of Marjah in the Helmand Province of Afghanistan.  These are not actors.  These are young men being helicoptered into a war zone (at night) armed only with what they can carry.  This is real and the footage is raw. Regardless of personal opinion about war and middle eastern issues, Americans owe these men a debt of gratitude. They are America's finest, American heroes.

4581190,5,B0055T3RBA,"Ben Anderson truly captures the hearts and minds of the Marines he embedded with in Afghanistan. It is an outstanding first-hand account of U.S. Marine operations in early 2010 during the Afghan conflict.  His inarguable footage of Operation Moshtarak illustrates the largest offensive push since the beginning of the war and his insightful and touching interviews with Capt. Ryan Sparks and his Marines are a rare and genuine portrayal of their experiences.  This operation changed the strategy and conduct of the Afghan war, and future operations from this point forward would always be compared to it.

Anderson's interviews with the local Afghan population are not be missed, as they demonstrate the lives and emotions of the citizens directly impacted and the complicated relationships they have with the forces working for their cause. Anderson's interviews humanize aspects of the war that are generally told in statistics and shocking headlines, and prompt viewers to question their own understanding of the war in Afghanistan.

Veterans of Operation Moshtarak look back on their time in Marjah as their ""D-Day"", and the direct coverage allowed for the media during this operation is a testament to the lengths we can go to in order to help the public better understand what deployed men and women are faced with, and the intricacies of the Afghan conflict faced by all of the countries involved.

Ben Anderson's professionalism and intuition truly helped make this documentary what it was.  It is obvious that he was trusted so well in order to form the relationships that he did with these men, and to serve alongside them in such a way to document their emotions and experiences to such an extent.  I can only hope that he continues to document the experiences of conflicts that are rarely seen.

I highly recommend this film to anyone who has an interest in the war in Afghanistan and U.S. Marines, or war from the perspective of the individual man on the ground. A great film overall.",1319068800,11,1997,5.0120845921450154
