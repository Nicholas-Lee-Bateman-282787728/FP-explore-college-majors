3714562,5,B000I6AHP4,I thought this film conveyed a sence of happiness between boys not even touched on here in America and that this film had tender moments  that are shared with a wider audience that hasn't come out yet. With the prolifewration of gay-based issues and love between boys and with it now in the forefront of the media I hope this movie can inpire not midigate the homosexual agenda in america but that this film can teach heterosexual poeple that Gay boys are great people and that they have  a wealth of value to offer the world. I was  touch by the movie not the film quality A++++++,1299110400,5,581,4.411214953271028

That moment made me wonder.  How it ended might seem extreme and unlikely to some, I am not sure.  It is about the depth of emotion teenaged boys can enter at this vulnerable time in their lives.",1285804800,10,364,4.084507042253521

3714566,5,B000I6AHP4,"If I had to pick my favorite film of the thousands I have seen this would be the one. French cinema has always been, if not the most profound and analytic in the world, indeed, the one that sets the benchmark in my mind and it is all the more clear when one sees this film. Considering this film was made in 1963 it is rather shocking to realize it was so ahead of it's time in 1963 that even in America in the 21st century film addressing same sex love stories only exist for individuals over 18 under ""gay cinema"" but any suggestion that boys of say 12 or 13 years old could fall in love with each other is still so taboo no such film has ever been made in Hollywood. In this beautifully shot film, Delanoy tackles a difficult subject matter -the idea that kids like adults are capable of having and falling in love with a person of their same gender. When I saw Les Amities Particulieres for the first time in the 1990's, I simply couldn't realise how important it was. Now, after many years, I find it much more interesting as I have seen several failed attempted remakes like The Fire that Burns and many other films . Many others have already written about the story. I will delve into a different approach: today's reality, at the beginning of the 21st Century.

The strength of our mediated world has increased exponentially and it will keep on growing. The way we look at our world today is consistently chiseled by the way information is provided, dissected, manipulated and delivered. We just consume it. With it, the apocalyptic view on pedophilia that, by the way, means affinity, love, for boys has been transformed completely.

Maybe we're more than insane today than in the 40's or the 70's, but by then people were not scared at all by this kind of love, even when it was clearly seen as sin if sexuality was involved. Since the late 1990's however,it seems that a film like this really scares people in the early 21st century in a way that is a little odd. The idea that kids-yours and mine have a sex life is to sort of forget our own childhoods and forget the first person you fell in love with-how old were you?-Chances are,if you are like me I was 12 too as in this film so I could totally identify with Alexandra.

It's a good idea to watch this film with an open mind. What happens has happened for centuries and will happen I am rather sure centuries after all of us are dust as the Victorians who sent Oscar Wilde to prison are a century or more ago are now dust. Is this sort of love between kids a good and natural thing? that is certaintly open for debate but it is undeniably a part of all places and times among about 4% of human beings. Times change and issues regarding sexuality among kids from 11 to 14 years old seems as charged now as anytime in history but times do change-Certainly a century ago the nation of England considered it completely normal to send the very gay Oscar Wilde to prison for his homosexuality and yet today most people would like to have sent those who sent Wilde to prison to have sent them there and seen Wilde freed-what will a century from now hold in verdict of todays current views on childhood sexuality?...Certainly there is a level of danger when adults allow their kids to explore relationships without some monitoring but to crush the natural bent of a child and something as beautiful as what one sees between George and Alexandra is truly tragic. What is undeniable in this story is that love exist as a fact beyond all doubt- Georges loves Alexandre and Alexandre is absolutely in love with him, despite the age gap that Georges is almost 15 and Alexandra is 12. Alexandre makes Georges swear his love for ever, his ""special friendship"", and writes him touching letters that only lovers can write. They simply can't help not loving each other, despite of the many obstacles in their way.

In today's perspective, Georges even at 15 having a relationship with a boy of 12 would not be seen as being gay but as a pedophile, a stalker, a child molester since a age gap of 3 years exist between Alexandre and himself. Historically that would have not been the case and in this film one sees that ""sin"" and not crime is the issue. Sadly,it appears that this view was actually more sane than our modern view as If the courts were involved Georges he would be in need of ""treatment""...as would Alexandre who would be refered to a ""good child psychologist"" as obviously such love is abnormal...Pending review of the next DSM V...This raises some interesting ideas if there is actually anything abnormal going on here in the film. Just over a century ago most of England was screaming for the head of Oscar Wilde and wanting to send him to prison or worse,today,most people would like to have sent those who sentenced Oscar Wilde to prison themselves for crimes against humanity and here is what this film boils down to-a crime against love and humanity.

What would the media say about something like this TODAY???? We all know the answer.

This film can teach, too, a lot in cinematographic techniques. The use of the camera is unusual for its time and the B&w effect is beautiful that takes one back to another place and time. Maybe one of the most daring movements is when Georges arrives in one of the first scenes of the film. The unique way of depicting the corridors in the cloister is another ""first"", when the steadycam wasn't even in a dream.

And, story-wise, we have to credit this film with one of the most powerful endings in cinema: after the ""Fin"" frames we discover the very last testament of Georges unread letter to Alexandre, which ends with the word ""amour"". All in all, a must-see.

If you liked this film I recommend watching ""Wild Tigers I Have Known"", a 2006 film made by Cam Archer. It draws a similar scenario but set in the 1990's. Note the film is listed as being unavaliable but I know for a fact it is for sale from Azov Films in Canada so if you can't get it here go to Azov Films.",1265414400,18,5980,4.459780621572212

(France, 1963) Director: Jean Dellanoy. Cast: Didier Haudepin, Francis Lacombrade, and Dominique Maurin.  Black and white. Running time: 99 minutes. Unrated. (In French with English subtitles.)

Roger Peyrefitte's shocking novel first came to the screen in 1963, and its impact remains rock-solid after more than forty years. THIS SPECIAL FRIENDSHIP tells of the tender relationship between a twelve-year-old boy and the upperclassman who is the object of his desire. All set in the rigid atmosphere of a Jesuit run school, this is a film of unparalled beauty and integrity, and it raises important issues that modern society is sadly still avoiding.",1157155200,3,675,5.471153846153846

8325199,5,B000I6AHP4,"This Special Friendship is such a deeply moving film. I stumbled upon it on YouTube and cannot get it out of my mind and thankfully it is available to purchase in DVD-R! I cannot recommend this film highly enough for everyone of every age, gay or straight. This film is not about being gay, it is about the very special bond of true friendship, a friendship that is viewed as highly suspect and wrong in the harsh eyes of the priests and the time. Though one priest does understand and his heart and compassion are clear to see at the end. I am also ordering the novel on which this excellent film is based. This Special Friendship is an excellent film which I will watch countless times over.",1495756800,,693,4.421875

8325201,4,B000I6AHP4,"It is hard to believe today that homophobia was once so vicious in western Europe as this film reports. Never the less, we all know it is true. This film was made at a time that nothing approximating sexual activity could be shown between boys and young men. One jarring aspect is that the story is told with so much simplicity and innocence that the viewer is left wondering if the actions  shown here of merely meeting in secret or writing a note could result in such draconian punishment. Very likely this was the case. Any suspicion assumed the worst, if only intent. Beautifully filmed, but profoundly depressing, this film should serve as a reminder that these conditions still exist today in many places worldwide.",1467244800,4,721,4.768
8325202,5,B000I6AHP4,"An excellent excellent film portraying what I perceived as the ideal friendship. We all need somebody  to lean our head upon at times and the friendship between these two was indeed idyllic.  The film makers also did an excellent job of finding the right actors that did a superb job in carrying out the film's objectives. .But unfortunately being at a boarding school with authoritative figures and like our governments and other agencies wielding that same power it seems they enjoy destroying that which is best. In my opinion there was absolutely nothing wrong with this ""special friendship."" but decisions were made and as proven in the film some of these decisions turned devastating even though they, like all other powers, deny their wrongdoing. Again an excellent film but if they can changed the ending (the only part of the film I didn't like) it would have been much much better.",1390780800,2,891,4.894039735099338

8325204,5,B000I6AHP4,"This DVD is priceless in its content because it provides a true-to-life commentary about the need to change a parochial system of education of the Victorian
Era.  At the beginning of the film, the introduction states in very clear terms the structure of education in the parochial school systems have changed
dramatically.  In the former system, there was a lower school of young boys, and the academy for older boys. Naturally, such a setting was going to foster
sexual tensions as younger boys enter puberty.  George was a nave 16-year-old, who was understandably stunned his peer was involved in a sexual affair with a
boy in the lower school?! In the French culture of that time during the turn of the 20th Century, a blood ceremony of eternal friendship was a very serious
ritual.  The suicide incident over the rejection or violation of this particular ritual was the cause of more suicides in the French culture of that time: I suspect it was the basis the author of the novel on which this movie was scripted, wrote it into his literary work. Notice the Jesuit Priesthood strived to
maintain standards of decency, not deviancy! Today, parochial systems are different and more humane - with co-ed classes and boarding included in their operations.  It must be emphasized, both in the DVD and parochial boarding schools today, were intended as special institutions of preparation for above-average students to be educated for professions of excellence (not cloaked reform schools).  Didier Haudepin as the actor for the role of a 12-year old is really gifted as his counterpart George for the sensitive and controversial subject matter as presented. Suicide among the young, even in the 21st Century is a tragic subject and does occur.  I would recommend this DVD because it provides good incite to controversial matters which are not restricted to any specific period of time, as illustrated by another DVD titled ""Logan.""",1374537600,3,1929,5.009375
8325205,5,B000I6AHP4,"I remember when I was very young this story was a big controversy in my small hometown. Homophobia was real in those days and narrow minded people, the majority at that time, felt this was about pedophilia. It is not. The story is about a loving friendship and the corrupt guilt ridden phobia of the priesthood and their false interpretation of what real friendship is and their overpowering influence of the innocent. A wonderful, yet sad movie, that should be  required viewing for all young boys, especially those forced to give religious zealots respect.",1371513600,3,558,4.9361702127659575
8325206,4,B000I6AHP4,"This is the film adapatation of Roger Peyrefitte's novel telling the deeply moving love story of brilliant 16 year-old aristocrat Georges de Sarre and beautiful 12 year-old Alexandre Motier at St. Claude's, a French, Catholic boarding-school in the 1920s.  Though chaste, their love is passionately expressed through poems, gazes and the odd kiss, and there is no mistaking the sensuality underpinning it.

Whether consummated or not, for many centuries such intense love affairs between younger and older boys were a feature of boarding-school life that brought joy and relief to some of the more feeling and less hung-up sort of adolescents, as well as grief and catastrophe to the minority whose liaisons were discovered and crushed by the Christian authorities. They were essentially pederastic, satisfying different emotional needs in the younger and older participants, though the disparity in age lent them special intensity for both.

This ancient tradition more or less died a generation or so ago; the boys who would once have partaken or at least have approved of romantic friendships nowadays either never see their appeal, brought up as they are in a society so antagonistic to them, or shun them through terror of being misunderstood and branded as gay.  Indeed, the number of reviews of this film implying gayness is proof they are right to fear it is now practically impossible to escape being judged according to the new dogma insisting on a fixed sexual orientation for even early teens.

It is salutary to remember that however responsible the priests at St. Claude's were for the tragedy of Alexandre and Georges and however misguided the abhorrence of sin that drove them to act as they did, they acted as gentle lambs compared to the savagery with which their post-Christian successors today would crush an affair that any older and younger boy had the temerity to get embroiled in. Our new moral dictators would of course destroy Alexandre to save him from an unequal relationship rather than from the sin of homosexuality, but that would make no difference to either the cruel outcome or the monstrous bigotry behind it.  Ironically it would actually increase the perverse injustice of such interference: Alexandre is typical of the younger boy in a special friendship in that his emotional need for it is evidently greater and so it is even more vital to his happiness than to Georges's that it should not be broken up.

Considering special friendships at boarding-school seem to have disappeared from our emotional landscape and are now so badly misunderstood, we must be forever thankful that in the short space of time when they were still fairly widely understood and it had also become possible to write candidly about such delicate matters, not only did such a talented writer as Peyrefitte preserve their character for us so evocatively, but that a film was made of it before the moral panic about teenage sexuality which arose in the 80s made such an undertaking unthinkable.

Unsurprisingly, the film is not as outstanding as the novel, though mostly faithful to it.  The most significant change is that, in the novel, Georges was only fourteen, but as he seemed a little improbably sophisticated for even a French patrician of that age, this was actually an improvement.  The problem with the adaptation to film is largely the common one of condensation. Because we do not get to know the protagonists quite so well, it is harder to be so deeply moved by their plight. Mostly gone too is the richly elaborated conflict in the boys' minds between the influences of puritanical Christian doctrine and the boy-admiring Graeco-Roman attitudes it drove into hiding. Nevertheless, the film is well acted, atmospheric and near the end soars towards the heights of aching pathos achieved in the novel.

Peyrefitte was much involved in the making of the adaptation to film, which makes for a fascinating footnote:  he was rewarded by meeting on the set the love of his life, 12-year-old Alain-Philippe Malagnac, who had a minor role in the film as a choirboy and introduced himself to the author as a fan of the novel, a story Peyrefitte recounted in Notre amour (1967).
