8322381,2,B001MY6U5W,"Awkward, slow, poor production value.  Did not enjoy this.  My baby liked doing some of the exercises but theres not much variation or structure to the video and no music or soundtrack.  Camera work could use some help too.",1516665600,,223,4.666666666666667
8322382,5,B001MY6U5W,"I am a yoga and barre teacher. I am currently teaching a mom & baby yoga class. I was very curious to see how an exercise class could be done with a busy toddler. I am really impressed with this video. My youngest is 13 months and I was able to do most of it with her. I look forward to doing more as she gets older. There's a lot of value in this video between the yoga, Pilates, signing and sign language. And it's really nicely produced.",1390348800,,440,4.011363636363637
8322383,1,B001MY6U5W,I was expecting something upbeat that would keep my toddler and I interested.  This was very cheesy and overall not a good workout.,1377820800,,131,4.695652173913044
8322384,4,B001MY6U5W,"I have a 14 month old that I do this with.  I like that all the exercises are brief to hold both our interests.  I also like that there is a good mix of different types of aerobic, strengthening, and yoga exercises.  Some we skip through now, but I can see us doing more of the yoga ones as she gets older.  My daughter thought it was a lot of fun, so now I have no excuse not to exercise at least 15 minutes each day.  We also have Mom and Toddler Fitness - Tone, Strenghten, and Play and we love that one even more.",1359331200,,517,3.8857142857142857
8322385,5,B001MY6U5W,"I have a very active toddler, and we love to do this video together.  There are 2 workouts that alternate between yoga poses for the child, for the adult, pilates moves, and cardio activities.  There are also songs and sign language throughout.  You can also choose from 4 10-minute workouts that focus on only one type of activity.  This video is best for adults with yoga and pilates experience as the poses are not described in depth, and very little instruction is given. That being said, it is still very accessible and a lot of fun!  The child is not truly engaged in every activity, there are times when they are allowed to play as the adult performs poses and moves near them and can interact with them minimally - this might not work for some parents and children, but it is perfect for us!  It allows my active munchkin to come and go as she pleases while I break a sweat, get my heart-rate up and have fun playing and interacting with her - great for a stay-at-home parent like myself!",1268524800,5,996,4.445054945054945
8322386,1,B001MY6U5W,"I was looking for a family yoga session and instead of it being like a class with beginner warm up poses, and then progressing through a whole session, it is a series of examples of what you could do with your child but it jumps all over from very complicated advanced poses for someone who has practiced yoga a long time to something simple. It is not a class with a clearly defined set of poses for various length workouts. That is what I was looking for. The people are moms but don't seem to think about attention spans of various age children. The DVD is professionally made with appropriate studio quality.",1266192000,6,612,4.473214285714286
