Having said there is so much positive inforamtion to presented here that I couldn't help but to enjoy it thoroughly. Highly recommended.",1358380800,,248,5.073170731707317
8253877,4,B00141381C,"Hamish Miller is a really likable guy and he infuses The Parallel Community with a down home sincerity of personal awareness of what is truely important in our brief but wonderous time here on our glorious planet. If your one who doesn't find any real living, joy, or purpose in the rat race, our rabid materialism, or the lack of consciousness that is cultivated by the worlds global puppeters - than this DVD's oraganic reminder of ways of existing will be most welcomed. Hamish covers alot of ground including other realites, Earth energies, dowsing, community, and his near death experience to mention a few. We are reminded that we are all apart of nature and not seperate from it, which is getting harder and harder for the masses to remember as we live in concrete jungles possessed by technology that has no real spiritual consciouness to guide it. Filmed mostly outdoors in the British countyside (I believe mostly in Cornwall), The Parallel Community succeeds in delievering a much needed dose of the magickal that resides in so called ""mundane"".",1266710400,,1056,4.905027932960894
8253878,3,B00141381C,"Do you want to live in peace and harmony with your community?  I sure do and if you buy into these theories presented in this DVD, it is not only possible but probable.  By all people who want a peaceful way of life grouping together, Hamish believes that we can change the direction the world is in and headed towards.  This is his description of a one world community.  His plan is interesting but not plausible in my opinion.  That does not make this DVD and less interesting though.  His life-changing event took him on another path and it is entertaining to hear his passion for peace.",1214352000,,590,4.4672897196261685
8253879,3,B00141381C,"Hamish Miller had already begun to question his competitive and stressful lifestyle, but a near-death experience at 53 convinced him to drop out of the rat race and tune in to nature and humanity as a ""simple servant."" He explains the new direction of his life and inspiration in this interview from his home in Cornwall.",1213833600,2,321,4.75
