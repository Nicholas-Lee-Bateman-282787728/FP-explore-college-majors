2059641,4,B00023P4H4,"In the tradition of ""Airheads"" and ""That Thing You Do"" comes this against-genre film from the director of the dark fantasy adaptation of ""The Crow"" and sci-fi classic ""Dark City"" (as well as this summer's would-be box office hit ""I, Robot"") Alex Proyas.  It's another in a line of interestingly quirky Australian movies (and in fact not terribly dissimilar from the late Michael Hutchence's acting debut ""Dogs In Space"", though certainly far more light-hearted) that adds to that nation's reputation as a producer of fine cinema that pound-for-pound can go round-for-round with the heavyweights of the industry in Hollywood without breaking a sweat.

The film was obviously a labor of love, and even though the band at the center of the movie was definitely low-fi, the movie itself was shot using first-class editing and production values.  The scenes of introspection when characters are given to voiceover monologue are particularly effective, to say nothing of the ""Fun With Drugs"" sequences.  And even though there is a shortage of original music (how do you go about writing a song that you DON'T want to sound good?), the music used on the soundtrack itself is a terrific sampling of classic rock and alternative music that have been genre standards for ages, used to good effect (especially AC/DC and the Cure).

The actors are certain to be unknown to most American audiences, and not all characters are developed as evenly as they should be (this is particularly true of the band's bassist Tanya, who starts out as the frontman's girlfriend and then almost disappears from the plot entirely, instead being relegated to a position player; the fact that the characters are introduced at the beginning of the movie by the instrument they play in the band rather than their respective character names is not likely an accident).  It is true that all of the classic rock-&-roll lifestyle cliche's are represented; there are problems with relationships, problems with drugs, and even problems with maintaining a grip on reality.  There are sleazy managers, sexually manipulative diva wanna-bes, and has-beens who just don't know when to cut the mullet and get a real job.  We've seen these issues play out across the pages of Billboard and Rolling Stone magazines with megaplatinum acts like the Beatles, Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd, and of course the Rolling Stones.  This is a movie that is dedicated to all the bands (a few of which I have been a member of) that never made it far enough to implode in such public surroundings.

As the case of the DVD asks:  ""What if you finally got your big break...and you just plain sucked?""  See this movie and find out.",1091923200,6,2663,4.946188340807175
2059642,4,B00023P4H4,"""Garage Days"" is a comedy from director Alex Proyas made in between ""Dark City"" and ""I, Robot,"" that asks the musical question, ""What if you finally got your big break and you just plain sucked?"" The setting is Sydney, Australia, or more specifically the suburb of Newton, although that fact is probably lost on anybody who does not live Down Under. Freddy (Kick Gurry) is the lead singer of a band, the name of which I do not think we ever get to hear, which makes sense because we never really get to hear their music that much either. This is because the band has trouble getting a gig.

 Besides Freddy the band consists of Joe (Brett Siller) on lead guitar, Tanya (Pia Miranda) on bass, and Lucy (Chris Sadrinna) on drums. Bruno (Russell Dykstra) is the less than competent manager and Kate (Maya Stange) is Joe's girlfriend and apparentlty the group's sole groupie. What becomes key here is not the group's music (they play ""rock"") but the fact that they are about to go through the whole ""Rumours"" phase of Fleetwood Mac, but without the hit album. Freddy and Tanya are living together, but when Joe ignores Kate to run off on his own a conversation sparks a kiss between Freddy and Kate. The next thing we know Joe is trying to rip Freddy's head off, Tanya has moved out, Karen discovers she is pregnant with Joe's child, Lucy continues his question to find the perfect ""10"" in terms of pharmacological high, and I can still hear you saying that you will never break, never break, the chain.

 Freddy and the band need a break, and they might have found one with Shad Kern (Marton Csokas), who is a big shot in the music industry (or at least he acts like one). The band just needs a break, one opportunity to play their music for a crowd and change their destinies. They are about at the point of giving up on the dream, but as Kate points out to Freddy, a dream only becomes something stupid when you stop believing in it and while the notion of having a date with destiny drives the film, it eventually dawns on Freddy that he is dreaming about more than being a rock star. After all, there is the example of former Seventies rocker, Kevin (Andy Anderson), who is as much a cautionary tale as he is an indirect glimpse at the glory days possible as a rock star.

 Although the fact that Joe is deeply troubled in a way that goes beyond what the band members experience when Lucy gives them a bit of ecstasy to help mellow them out, this is essentially a feel good comedy. You will get the best sense of this during the final credits when the cast taken their curtain calls dancing to the Tom Jones hit ""Help Yourself."" Maybe the good feeling I picked up on is more than is actually justified by the comedy, but Freddy is a decent bloke and the story is not exactly following the familiar formula of a musical rags-to-riches story, which also helps. A happy ending is a safe assumption, but what it might take is not a foregone conclusion. Proyas spices up the story with some cute tricks and the result is that ""Garage Days"" is a fun little movie without aspirations to be much more.",1091664000,,3094,4.438380281690141
2059643,5,B00023P4H4,"I saw this film well over a year ago at the Sundance Film Festival. It was very funny and often visually stunning. Proyas brings his intense and imaginative style to a simple romantic comedy about a garage band, resulting in a unique experience. The romantic aspect is not very strong, but I still give the film 5 stars (rounding up from 4.5).  I plan to buy the DVD when it is released...",1086566400,,389,4.402777777777778
8021453,5,B00023P4H4,"This sprightly film follows the story of a small time band going through the proverbial ups and downs of life trying desperately to hold together long enough to get gigs, record deals and oodles of filthy lucre. They face their own internal squabbles, romantic dalliances, drug issues, health issues and all while trying to wend their way into the good graces of a top flight management firm via which they believe they'll be able to get a record deal and thence, onwards and upwards.

There is a lot to like here from the indi-vibe of the film, the fresh faced status of many of the actors and the small town feel of the piece. Direction is light, the actors seem to have been able to divine their roles quite nicely and their performances are so upbeat and uninhibited that it becomes positively disarming. A fun and well judged soundtrack helps bring out a certain sense of youthful exuberance in the film and the support cast all slot in admirably. There are some moments where things get a touch too indulgent or just plain silly but thankfully they are few and far between. There are some dark subjects dealt with here such as mental health but it all fits the overall theme.

Character development is handled well and the pacing is fast. The film is nicely shot and the ending is not clich,  but still quite satisfying. The playfully fractured style of certain elements of the film such as some of the drug use montages are nicely done and add to the allure, rather than become unwanted intrusions.

As an added bonus, if you grew up in Australia a lot of the vibe of the urban scenery will be familiar to you, and hopefully make you hate poker machine more than you already do! (you have to watch the movie to fully get that).

This movie shows what can be done with a good cast throwing themselves at the task at hand and while the budget must have been limited it never feels so, it just doesn't matter at all. A good movie for anyone who loves their rock 'n' roll.",1487289600,,1975,4.475
8021454,5,B00023P4H4,Crazy ass movie. One of my favorite imports.  Funny and a great story with top notch acting. Lucy steals the show....,1419984000,,117,4.571428571428571
8021455,4,B00023P4H4,"i thought this movie was funny, don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it, it talks about a group of kids in a band trying to make it big, and how what goes around comes around as well as lifes responsibilities and a few hints about growing up, mostly though the story is about a bunch of kids in a band. give it a shot its a good movie. Can't say the music is stunning but its not too bad.",1370995200,,401,3.8433734939759034
8021456,5,B00023P4H4,I totally bought this movie just because Chris Sadrinna was so hot as a punk rocker!,1246838400,,84,4.3125
8021457,4,B00023P4H4,"Having been in many bands I could easily identify with the group this film centers around. The film is quickly paced and pretty engaging, but I did find it a little uneven in tone at times. I don't want to give anything away, but I am rarely surprised when watching a film and this film  does drop a bomb or two that I wasn't expecting.

It's a fun film with some insight on the rough road of ""Rock'N'Roll"". It's no joke and even though I have had moderate success in the business, it's not easy being in a band no matter how successful you are! An interesting soundtrack and an honest look at band life even if it is pretty light at times, it does have it's dark moments.",1243209600,,672,4.2015503875969
8021458,2,B00023P4H4,"Garage Days (Alex Proyas, 2002)

There is something deeply, desperately wrong with a movie's marketing when the very tag line seen on posters around the world gives away the film's major plot twist. That doesn't stop this from being an amusing little film, however. It involves an Australian garage rock band fronted by Freddy (Spartan's Kick Gurry) who are trying to find a place to play. Freddy's girlfriend Tanya (Queen of the Damned's Pia Miranda) plays bass. Guitarist Joe (Brett Stiller) is predictably moody, and is in tenuous ground with girlfriend Kate (XX/XY's Maya Stange). Manager Bruno (Russell Dykstra, from the BlackJack franchise) is something of a lovable foulup who seems congenitally incapable of getting the band gigs, but a chance encounter at a bar between Freddy and the manager of Sprimp, Australia's hottest act, gives the band hope. Meanwhile, with the various relationships on the rocks, Freddy finds himself more and more attracted to Kate; will internal pressures kill the band off before they can even make it to their first gig?

As much as I hate to say it, the weak link in this chain is director Alex Proyas. When Proyas is in his element, I have endless respect for the man; The Crow and Dark City are well on their way to becoming bona fide classics, and he even managed to make something halfway watchable out of I, Robot. The common thread, of course, is that all of these films are dark, moody pieces punctuated with frenetic action scenes. Garage Days, on the other hand, is a light comedy piece. Not the kind of thing one would expect from a guy who normally does dark fantasy action pictures, and it shows. Imagine if David Fincher tried to do a remake of, say, Sunday in the Park with George. The general raucousness of the film feels forced at times, artificially subdued at others. The upside to it, though, is that the comedy tends to be more understated than one would expect from a movie of this type, which leads to some subtle (and some disturbing) gags that might have otherwise come off as silly and/or tasteless.

It could have been a better film, to be sure, but it's not a bad one as it stands. Worth checking out, at least. ** ",1199318400,4,2183,4.691906005221932
8021459,4,B00023P4H4,"If you liked TRAINSPOTTING and SLC PUNK you'll like GARAGE DAYS. Also has elements of REQUIEM FOR A DREAM and SALTON SEA. ""You don't have to be a rock star to feel like one"" is the saying for this group who have the drive but is Australia ready for them? With the growing trend of pretty boy djs live music has become the sign of the past.

There are valuable lessons to be learned:

FUN WITH DRUGS PART 1
The visual and physical effects of taking drugs. Create a world of your own if the world around you sucks!

FUN WITH DRUGS PART 2
Here's to bleeding your parents dry. Drug taking at its best when you invite your parents over for dinner. Heads will burn! Then ask them for money.

Then there's the sexual interaction among the 4 group members. Freddy and Tanya are an item but Freddy loves Kate who's involved with Joe Papa who's not faithful to her. But when Joe Papa realizes his loyality towards Kate he creates a fruity baby by the name of Millie Melon (an actual melon) caring for it as if a real baby. Is this confusing yet? Well, Tanya never was satisfied with Freddy to begin with and ends up with Lucy who has the most bizzare sexual habits to tickle her fancy. The group gets a real break when Freddy finds the wallet of a successful band promotor. Do they have what it takes? Watch GARAGE DAYS and find out for yourself.",1184803200,,1336,4.2896825396825395
8021460,5,B00023P4H4,"You know the story of the band that has everything against it, but manages - through determination, luck, camradery and musical skill - to break into the big time and then lives happily ever after?

This is that story except the band has no musical skill.

Garage Days is the story of five friends who come to learn that their love of music transcends making a living as a band or even being very good at playing. What they do succeed at is finding out what it means to have friends and lovers and that relationships that will last a lifetime can come upon you at the most strange times and circumstances...and often with the person you least suspect.

The film has the humorous rough edge found in many Australian productions, an earthy good-humour driven as much by the culture as the screenplay. The cast of relative newcomers are convincing in their roles, even if the characterizations are a bit thin.

Sit back and enjoy the humour and joyfullness of this well-made film.",1177977600,,977,4.630057803468208
8021461,4,B00023P4H4,"Plot: A not so talented band struggles with drugs sex and rock and roll.  Yup that sums it up!! The acting and character development is very well done.  You have the singer/guitar writer who dreams of being a star who has a girlfriend, the bass player, who is into someone else. The lead guitarist is having strange fantasies of sex and adopts a melon as a child meanwhile abandoning his girl who the singer digs, the drummer experiments with too many drugs while the manager is just plain crazy!!! Sound Interesting?  Pacing of the movie reminds me a lot like Trainspotting.  Better than i expected!!",1137974400,,601,4.695238095238095
8021462,3,B00023P4H4,"After seeing The Crow I had much loved respect for Proyas and then he did Dark City and I still did, but I was pretty mad at him for doing I, Robot because I hated that movie with a passion. Then I saw this one on the video shelves and I rented it and I liked it, to some extent. Rock stardom is always interesting, especially when they play.  Some good performances (one in mind being Kick Gurry), but some come off as bland. Brett Stiller?? Any relation to Ben Stiller? Maybe? Who knows. Anyway, the slow motion stuff was interesting and kept me from steering away. Marton Csokas (costarred with Vin Diesel in Triple X) also stars as the head manager to Sprimp (nice band name). Highlight would be the dinner scene when their all hallucinating..funny s**t. Proyas pulls off another enjoyable movie...for the most part. This made up for I, Robot. My suggestion is don't go see the crappy I, Robot...rent this one.",1093219200,2,914,4.539393939393939
