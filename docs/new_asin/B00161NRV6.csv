8260688,3,B00161NRV6,Movies were ok.  Not terrible but not really great.,1468627200,,51,4.666666666666667
8260689,2,B00161NRV6,"I bought this for Class Reunion, which is a real hoot. Had it on VHS and wanted to get it on DVD. I hoped that the other 2 movies would be as good since they were also National Lampoon movies but I was absolutely wrong. Dorm Daze was watchable and had some funny parts. Going the distance was sort of a waste of time. All in all not much of a National Lampoon triple play. Seems they lost the magic after Animal House, Class Reunion and Vacation.  If you really like Class Reunion, don't waste your money on this 3 pack and buy it by itself. I'll never watch the other 2 again.",1428451200,,577,4.106194690265487
8260690,3,B00161NRV6,"Several decent films in this triple feature. I originally purchased for CLASS REUNION but discovered that the other two films here ain't too bad.

If your a comedy fan and haven't seen these, all three are worth a view or two.",1407542400,,226,4.512195121951219
8260691,3,B00161NRV6,"Good movies, all are hard to find, so to get all 3 in one pack is awesome. The best of the 3 is Class Reunion.",1393804800,,110,3.44
8260692,5,B00161NRV6,I love the film it was great. all parts of it was good. it was good and i loved it,1378252800,,82,3.15
8260693,5,B00161NRV6,I got this DVD for one movie only but was pleasantly surprized with the other movies. I LOL all night long,1360195200,,106,4.095238095238095
8260694,4,B00161NRV6,"since i seen, the only review was a negetive one saying crap times 3, figured id write a quick review saying its actually only crap times 1 or whatever the only film not so great on here is class reunion i ordered this cause if your a lampoon fan 3 for the price of one is great and Dorm Daze and Going the Distance are great

Dorm daze stars Danielle Fishell from Boy meets world and Tatyana Ali from Fresh prince of bel air,,,,,Styles,hires a prostitute named Dominique for his brother, Booker, to lose his virginity. But Booker prefers to lose his virginity to his girlfriend Rachel just down the hall. Meanwhile, another student, named Wang, awaits the arrival of a French foreign exchange student, who speaks little English, also named Dominique.

Going the Distance Reminds me of Road trip - but in a Winnibego, and it has just about the same storyline,, going going across the country to see current gf for some reason but meets another women and falls in love with Her in the process,, with funny things happeneing along the way...",1336176000,,1039,4.610810810810811
8260695,1,B00161NRV6,I thought these would be much funnier...maybe I'm too old (50) so I'm passing them on to some teen - twenties nephews/cousins.  I thought it was garbage times three and a waste of money.,1295827200,,186,4.470588235294118
