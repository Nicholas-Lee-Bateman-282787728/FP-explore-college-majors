7921318,5,B00004RF69,although recorded in the 90s penn and teller serve as engaging teachers of visual arts education. The artists chosen for this series are well known and highly skilled. The video is engaging for K-5th grade and all students love the exploration of the arts along with the humourous animations and hands-on relevance.,1368144000,,315,5.076923076923077
7921319,4,B00004RF69,"This is a GREAT DEAL!  These DVD's usually go for $40 EACH in education catalogs so I'm thrilled to find them all at such a low price... partially because I feel I can use only parts of the videos.  I had a few of these years ago and I showed them to my elem students, but I found the kids lost interest part of the way through.  Penn and Teller do an amazing job of ""acting out"" some important art concepts.  One part I remeber is when they are holding up a large foam board tree. Teller cuts out a tiny tree (about 2 inches) from the large foam board tree.  Penn then drives his motorcycle with the tiny tree in hand, down a long hill until the large tree in the distance appears to be the same size as the tiny tree in Penn's hand.  While I was going to use this to illustrate size and distance, Pen and Teller use it to illustrate color and distance. (The tiny tree is still bright green while the tree in the distance appears light blue/green.) Either way, it's a great visual for the kids.  Now as great as those portions are, there are also portions I can't show at all.  For example in the video with the artist for The Simpsons, he draws a cartoon in which (if I remember correctly, it's been several years) Bart says somehting about a bomb or blowing up the school or something along those lines.  That kind of thing just can't be shown today... so beware if you do order the videos, I'd definitely preview them all before showing them to the students.",1314662400,3,1462,4.23021582733813
