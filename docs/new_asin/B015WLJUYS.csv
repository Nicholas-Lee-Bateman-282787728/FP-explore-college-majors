7452397,5,B015WLJUYS,"Season 3 of Hannibal was every bit as good as Seasons 1 and 2 -- just very different. In fact it was so different that I think that is why some fannibals were taken aback. I found Season 3 to have equally profound writing, cinematography, acting, and music, but it was much darker and more moody. Additionally, the character development and the relationship between Will and Hannibal got even deeper.

Season 3 contained so many scenes I watched over and over because they were just that good. There was one 4 minute scene where the Red Dragon goes after Molly and Wally that I must have watched 20 times. The directing, editing, and the music were incredible. It is worth the price of this DVD for that scene alone. It was like a mini-horror movie on quality growth hormones.

Before Hannibal, my favorite television series was either Breaking Bad or Six Feet Under. As much as I loved those shows, I loved Hannibal even more. I find it hard to imagine anything better. In fact, when the new Fall television shows came out after Season 3 of Hannibal, everything seemed boring, even on Showtime and HBO. I feel like Hannibal spoiled me. Now I cant stop praying for a Season 4. Please, God, oh please! she screamed.",1444089600,15,1214,4.589861751152074

7452400,2,B015WLJUYS,"WARNING:  THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS

Hannibal Season 1 was successful in establishing the back-story of the life of Dr. Hannibal Lecter as an adult before he was incarcerated; breathing life to the characters in law enforcement, academia, and the media who are trying to find the Chesapeake Ripper (some for very personal reasons); developing these characters so we grow to love them  or love to hate them; and showing us how the gifted but tortured Will Graham is manipulated by Dr. Lecter, culminating in a final episode that sees Graham institutionalized and accused of four murders actually committed by Dr. Lecter.

Season 2 was successful in showing us how Will Graham took control of his seemingly out-of-control predicament, evolving the co-dependent relationship between Dr. Lecter and Graham, breaking our hearts by killing off FBI Special Agent Beverly Katz, showing Dr. Lecter and Dr. Bloom becoming romantically involved (and Dr. Blooms struggle to determine who Dr. Lecter really is), introducing us to the manifestation of pure cruelty that is Mason Verger, and knitting a complicated web of intrigue leading up to the final episode that showcases betrayal, brutality, and a shocking revelation or two.

In the case of both seasons, all the stories were well-written and well-executed.  Even the sidebar episodes that show the day-to-day work of the FBI Behavioral Science Unit dealing with killers other than the Chesapeake Ripper/Hannibal were compelling.  So I had high hopes going into the third season that this one was going to be the best yet.  The producers intimated that Season 3 was going to dig into Hannibals past and further develop the relationship between Dr. Lecter and Dr. Du Maurier.  There was even a rumor that David Bowie might make an appearance as Dr. Lecters Uncle Robertas.  And, of course, the cliffhanger final episode of Season 2 left us with so many questions:  Who survived the bloodbath at Dr. Lecters home?  What was Dr. Du Maurier doing on the plane with the now-fugitive Dr. Lecter?  How much of the chronicles of Dr. Lecter as written by Thomas Harris would be addressed in Season 3?

So I watchedand oh boy, was I disappointed.

Instead of seeing more of what impressed me in the first two seasons, I saw a disjointed attempt to cram much of what happened in Red Dragon and Hannibal (the movie that came after The Silence of the Lambs) into one season.  But beyond that, the series devolved into a hot mess that was often very confusing  even for someone who has read all the Thomas Harris books and has seen all the Hannibal Lecter movies.  The stories didn't make sense, the actions of the characters made even less sense, and much of what happened was so farfetched that it ventured into the ridiculous.

To give you an idea of how Season 3 didn't work, lets take a look from the perspective of some of the characters:

ABIGAIL HOBBS:  She appears again in Season 3, and were actually teased into believing she survived.  Unfortunately, we find out later that she didn't make it and now only lives in the mind of Will Graham.  She would have been one of the success stories of Season 3 were it not for an episode that explores what happened from the time she was supposedly killed by Dr. Lecter in her family home up to the time of the major conflict in the last episode of Season 2.  We see Abigail basically going along with Dr. Lecters schemes without any context to indicate why she was a participant  or whether she was a willing participant.  She seems cold and distant in one scene, then she appears clearly disturbed the next.  Was she motivated by fear?  Did her survival instinct kick in?  Did Dr. Lecter sheep-dip her to such a degree that she became his automaton?  We don't know because were not told or shown, and the story suffers for it.

ALANA BLOOM:  Dr. Bloom miraculously survived being pushed out a second-floor window by Abigail without any permanent injury, but she makes the statement I got a lot of bone marrow in my blood, so my doctors say I may start thinking differently early on in the season.  This sets the stage for Dr. Bloom to (a) conspire with Mason Verger to catch Dr. Lecter  knowing full well Mason intends to torture and kill Dr. Lecter, (b) become a lesbian, (c) have a seizure-inducing kaleidoscopic lesbian tryst with Margot Verger, (d) become the surrogate mother for Mason Vergers baby, thereby becoming heir apparent to the Verger fortune, and  most outrageously of all (e) later trust Dr. Lecter to free Will Graham when the two are captured and held at Vergers Muskrat Farm.  Come onreally?  What doesnt fly is the dispassionate way she handles her betrayal by Dr. Lecter, especially after she comes to him later and asks him to rescue Graham.  It was largely her fault that Graham ended up in the hands of Mason Verger, and now she turns to the man who betrayed her and pulled the wool over her eyes for so long for help?!?!!  Sorry; none of what happened with Dr. Bloom is credible.

BEDELIA DU MAURIER:  Just as I was thinking the one person who knew Hannibal and what he was capable of better than anyone else had something up her sleeveWe learn that she finds Dr. Lecter in her house, cleaning up after leaving Abigail, Alana, Jack and Will for dead, and she decides to confront him  with a loaded gun.  Instead of destroying the monster once and for all or calling the police, she ends up going to Europe with him for reasons that are not clear by any stretch of the imagination.  She appears to give clues to those who are looking for Dr. Lecter, such as sitting on a bench in a train station in full view of the security cameras and making the same purchase of Batard-Montrachet and tartuffi bianchi (white truffles) from the same place the same day every week.  She also tells Hannibal repeatedly they're coming for him (DUH!), he will be caught (she should know better), and that she has some type of exit strategy planned so shell come out clean.  What was her great exit strategy, you ask?  She brought along her own little stash of psychotropic drugs and then told the Questura di Firenze that she was drugged and manipulated by her husband into believing she was someone else.  Jack Crawford didn't buy it, Will Graham didn't buy it, and neither did I.  That was the best that a seasoned psychiatrist with first-hand knowledge of the real Hannibal Lecter could come up with?!?!!  What the hell possessed her to go trotting off with him in the first place?  She had no reason to go  she could have simply turned around and left when she found Hannibal in her home.  To make matters worse, we find out the patient that was referred to her by Dr. Lecter really did die because he swallowed his tongue, so the whole mystique about Dr. Du Maurier somehow killing this patient ends up being a lot of smoke and mirrors.  MAJOR opportunity missed here as well.

CHIYOH:  Chiyoh is established as a woman who, as a girl, grew up as the attendant of Dr. Lecters aunt, the Lady Murasaki.  She is found at the Lecter Estate in Lithuania, guarding a man who allegedly murdered Dr. Lecters sister Mischa.  Chiyoh herself is imprisoned there with this man because she refused to kill him, so Hannibal left her there to keep him alive  and locked up.  She states that she is opposed to taking the life of a human being; however, after she is forced to kill Mischas alleged murderer when he attacks her, she departs the estate and engages in at least two acts of violence that could easily bring about death.  On one hand, she tells Dr. Du Maurier that she wants to see Hannibal caged, but she later implies to Hannibal she does not want him to have his freedom taken away.  Her presence in the story is one confusing contradiction after another.  The writers should have left her out of the story altogether.

FRANCIS DOLARHYDE (A.K.A. THE RED DRAGON):  I feel badly for Richard Armitage because he never got a chance.  Hes an exceptional actor, and he did what he could with this character  did it very well, in fact.  The problem is he was given so little to work with.  His part in the story was so condensed that it felt like watching the movie Red Dragon on fast-forward.  All we know about this guy is that hes got some psychological issues that motivate him to kill so he can become the Red Dragon.  They didn't dig anywhere near deeply enough into his past and what drove him.

FREDDIE LOUNDS:  Once again, Lara Jean Chorostecki portrays the obnoxious, ends-justify-the-means tabloid reporter to a T.  The problem is we see so little of her in Season 3, just as we started to get the sense toward the end of Season 2 that she was a lot more perceptive than we thought and that she actually has a heart.  The other downside here is we never find out how she was resurrected after a violent death was staged for her in Season 2.  A ten-second explanation would have sufficed.  We get nothing.

FREDERICK CHILTON:  Yes, we find out Dr. Chilton wasn't killed.  We learn that the bullet fired by FBI Agent Miriam Lass missed his brain by millimeters and that he is considerably disfigured as a result (we even get to see the nature and extent of the damage).  Raul Esparza also portrays the sniveling, self-serving, Uber-psychiatrist-wanna-be to a T, and as usual, he is thwarted at every turn.  But again, the writers ruined it by doing a cut-and-paste of what happened to Freddie Lounds in the book Red Dragon and applying it to Chilton.  Talk about taking the easy way out

HANNIBAL LECTER:  The mad monster was the biggest disappointment of all; and again, I have to say I feel badly for Mads Mikkelsen, who has done such a masterful job of putting his own decidedly creepy, twisted spin on Dr. Hannibal Lecter.  We begin the season NOT seeing him doing what he does best  killing a husband and wife so he can assume the husbands identity.  Not seeing all the murders actually works well because it becomes so much more shocking when you see Hannibal commit a spur-of-the-moment murder (as you will later on in the season).  We see more of his Chesapeake Ripper-esque handiwork later, we see him taking what appear to be unnecessary risks in terms of doing away with the wrong people, and it starts to venture into the unbelievable until you realize Hannibal is doing what hes doing to draw the hunters to him.  So why am I coming down so hard on Hannibal, you ask?  The answer is simple:  After escaping his home in Baltimore and getting to Europe, after committing numerous atrocities that weve come to expect from the worlds most well-known serial killer and not leaving so much as a scrap of evidence, after escaping from Muskrat Farm and a certain long, painful death, his days of freedom finally come to an end because HE TURNS HIMSELF IN!!!  Are you freaking kidding me?!?!!  The one man who is best-equipped to run and never get caught seeks out his hunters, throws his hands in the air and simply gives up?!??!!??!?!?!?!?  We don't want to see the villain surrender, we want to see him CAUGHT!!!  We want to see the ingenuity of the FBI and experience the tension of executing a meticulously formulated plan to take him down; never knowing if they can pull it off.  Yes, we are told repeatedly that Hannibal surrendered so Jack Crawford and Will Graham would always know where he is.  It just doesnt wash.  There is no way Dr. Hannibal Lecter would so lightly give up his freedom, knowing he would be deprived of his tastes and subjected to indignity.  The capture of Hannibal the Cannibal was the ultimate anti-climax.  It never should have been allowed to happen that way.

The end of Season 3 was so laughably predictable its sad.  They decide they need Hannibal to capture the Red Dragon so they stage Hannibals escape, which, of course, goes so dismally wrong  does anyone really believe Francis Dolarhyde could have found out the details about Hannibals release into Federal custody and then singlehandedly take out the FBI guards surrounding Lecter?  This leads to a final scene where Hannibal and Will go into the final conflict with Dolarhyde, destroy the Dragon, and plummet off a cliff together to almost certain death in the Atlantic.  The final scene shows a pressed-and-dressed Dr. DuMaurier sitting at a dining table with what appears to be a sumptuous roasted leg on beautiful display, and then we see that one of her legs has been amputated.  No sign of Hannibal though, but that older-than-Hollywood teaser leaves the door open for the series to be continued.  Well, after enduring all the confusion, contradictions, omissions about Hannibals past and all the simply implausible events in Season 3, Im glad to hear that NBC didn't renew and both Amazon and Netflix passed on this story that took 2 seasons to build and only 1 season to completely destroy.

The writing may have been on the wall after the first two seasons posted dismal ratings.  The principal characters all signed three-year contracts, and there must have been a palpable sense that NBC was not going to renew Hannibal for a fourth season.  This may go a long way to explain why Season 3 simply did not have the cohesiveness, the energy, and the dark magic that made the first two seasons work.  To their credit, the actors performances were still spot-on, and the music and cinematography (overblown symbolism and camera tricks notwithstanding) were still first-rate.  It just seemed as though the producers knew the series was coming to an end and they tried to wrap everything up; knowing they were biting off more than they could chew and not really caring.  They could have done so much more with Season 3.  Instead, we get a total cluster f**k.  Shame on you, Di Laurentiis Productions!  This is the third time youve tried to tell the story of the Red Dragon, and you haven't gotten it right yet.  Do us all a favor and hang it up.",1444003200,15,13845,4.66570367313248

7452431,5,B015WLJUYS,"Nothing bothers me more than a great tv show that outlives it's welcome and then ends abruptly because the creators didn't have the decency to write a solid ending before the show got boring.  Hannibal manages to completely defy that.  I did hear that the show was intended to have another two or three seasons (which I would have loved) but since the creators could not secure the rights to Clarice Starling and 'Buffalo Bill' they were forced to end the story after the third season.  Even though they may not have intended to end it here, they took the time to craft a solid ending that wraps up the storylines presented and leaves just enough questions to make the viewer wish there were more, but not enough to frustrate.

Side note, I've heard that there is still a possibility that we'll get a movie to end cap the whole series.  Don't know if it's true or not, but I'd love to see it happen.",1484179200,,899,4.424242424242424

7452434,3,B015WLJUYS,"Shaky in its attempt to balance both the continuation of season 2's finale and the adaptation of ""Red Dragon""'s plot line, Hannibal Season 3 is a definite step down from its predecessors. The entire season feels like you see less of all of the characters, but somehow still manage to watch the plot slowly progress. The plot's events are tied together with shallow and unexplained transitions. By the conclusion, you can definitely feel the writers felt pressed to tie together the series very quickly and sloppily before it ended.

Altogether, still a big fan of the series and the characters. I hope a future network will pick up Season 4 and continue their journey (and bring some redemption to this season along with it!)

Visuals are amazing, dialogue is always worthy of a second listen and the interplay of characters was top notch. It was a show that featured gore, but was not gory. It was, for it's duration, one of the most cerebral, visual and adult shows on television.

I loved the whole first part where they are out of USA. I thought the RD part was good but there was some serious deviations from the book plot that I found difficult to accept. That's true of the whole series for me though. One of my chief beefs with Hannibal is what this series does to Will Graham. This season it's even a bit more brutal in terms of that. It's very hard to watch. At points I feel it just verges on outright sadism. I'm fascinated but I'm a bit repelled too sometimes. Mads Mikkelsen is so good though as Hannibal he's just amazing. I will miss this series but I'm not too sure I like where it was going and I'm almost relieved it's over. I seldom buy DVD's anymore but I did make room for all 3 seasons on my shelf.

There are die hard fans all over the world that were in an uproar about losing their favorite team. As brutal as it can be, it is also one of the most beautiful and elegant show ever. Every episode was a full movie in it's own right, with such great care, hard work, blood, sweat and tears from all the cast and crew and it shows. We can only hope at some time that Bryan Fuller can bring it back in the near future. It is

7452498,3,B015WLJUYS,"I'm never quite sure if I'm reviewing the product I received or the content on the DVDs. So I'm just going to be honest. I love Hannibal, mostly for season 2. Season 1 was awkward because it was figuring itself out, but season 2 was great. Season 3 was pretty much just a mess. They didn't have enough plot for a whole Season 3, so they shortened it and included Red Dragon as the second half because they suspected they were going to be cancelled, which they were. So, to summarize, in Season 3 (in 13 episodes) they do a version of the entire book of Hannibal, albeit out of order, they resolve a lingering situation from Season 2, and then they do the entire book Red Dragon. So it's kind of a mess; it feels rushed and disjointed a lot of the time, in my opinion. There are just a lot of details that, if they authors gave it a little more time, would have made a lot more sense, especially once you hear the commentary. And maybe there are some scenes that I haven't watched yet that still don't make sense even with commentary. :) I agree they did not have enough material with where they started to draw that plot out into a whole season, but that doesn't mean you then rush through 2 books. It was just not as good, in my opinion, as their other season.

And in terms of the quality of the product I received, the case has a piece in the center that turns to hold 2 discs. Mine arrived broken in one place, with one of the DVDs loose in the case. It appears that the DVD is not scratched badly enough that it cannot play, so I didn't bother with the hassle of returning it. But I just thought I'd share. :)",1461888000,3,1614,4.173076923076923

I enjoyed the ongoing portrayal of Dr Lecter as the brilliant historian of antiquities, and the special dinners hosted in the beautiful settings.
 The too-great emphasis on the final threat, the Red Dragon, which culminates the story in the final episode was just too slow to develop and lost a lot of momentum in its development from episode to episode.

The time skip was a little jarring after the intensity of Digestivo but it was awesome to jump into the Red Dragon storyline. Richard Armitage was amazing- terrifying in this killer dragon mode, but also awkwardly vulnerable when being just Frances. And our regular cast was enjoyable as always. The finale is nearly as crazy intense as Mizumono and almost takes the sting of cancellation away. But only ALMOST.

7452571,1,B015WLJUYS,"After I saw Season 1 and 2 I was really blown away. I did binge view both seasons after a ten day horrorfilm festival and I saw more blood and deviant stuff than in the ten days before. So I ordered all three seasons in good faith, that the third one will meet the same high standards story wise like it's predecessors. I couldn't have been more wrong about that. Instead of following the same gruesome and innovative path like the first two seasons did, it was just a lame and very uninteresting regurgitation of the stuff that was done better in the Motion Pictures ""Hannibal"" and  ""Red Dragon"". I don't know what forced a genius like Bryan Fuller to do this. Like Caroline Dhavernas said herself in the special features of season two that Hannibal was something knew in every kind of respect (and I can only agree with every word). Every dish served up until season three was very tasty and good. Unfortunately the last one left a very bitter aftertaste. The series would have deserved a better way to end than this.",1455062400,2,1019,4.508108108108108

But, as they knew it was to be the finale, you see, sense, feel, production and cast dipped heavy into their last hurrah. They do dream sequence-style, mind-f---ing, to near absurdity. But, for those of us drooling for this installment it works. Once again, acting, art, food styling, drama, creepiness...it has been delivered upon a sterling silver room service cart by a super production ensemble, the likes of which, will be hard to assemble again <- sad for we viewers who have now been spoiled with craftsmen and women tweaking, caring, and meticulously shaping every part of their presentation for us...",1454025600,,944,4.869565217391305

He still did it in a way that set the bar almost impossibly high for American network TV. And that's an indictment of network TV, not Bryan Fuller.

7452612,5,B015WLJUYS,"I am mourning the loss of the best show on television. Hannibal was too good of a show to be on network tv. It should have been on HBO or Netflix. With that said, NBC was amazing for allowing what they did and letting Bryan Fuller's vision play out on screen.
Mads Mikkelsen is Hannibal for me now. That doesn't take away from Anthony Hopkins in the least. His version was incredible, and should be honored for what it was. But this was Hannibal in action, with his person suit still on. Hannibal before he was caught, and it was glorious.
Hugh Dancy was just as amazing as Will Graham. He was damaged, overly empathetic, awkward in social situations, and brilliant. The friendship that unfolded between him and Hannibal was a beautiful thing to watch. There were lots of people 'shipping' for more than a bromance, but I saw their relationship was purer than that.
Whenever I see a show like this, that's intelligent and strange, and in this case gory as well, I know it will be canceled. I am grateful we got three seasons out of it, and that Bryan Fuller had a chance to wrap it up, even if it was mashed together. This season should have been two seasons, but they made it work. All in all, I am very happy with how it ended as well, which is more than I can say for most shows that have captured my heart the way this one did. Mads and Hugh should have won accolades and awards galore, but they were ignored. Their acting was a beautiful thing to behold, as was the cinematography, writing, directing and everything else about this show. I doubt there will ever be another like it, but it was beautiful while it lasted.",1452124800,7,1624,4.398671096345515

7452637,5,B015WLJUYS,"+++Warning, This will contain spoilers from season 2, but no major giveaways from season 3.+++

Season 3 would ultimately be the final season of the show.  Bryan Fuller, who has a knack for making critically acclaimed shows that get a major cult following, like Pushing Daisies and Wonderfalls, but never get good ratings, had another one with his adaptation of the Hannibal Lector stories.  The third season is told in two parts.  The first being an adaptation of the Mason Verger/Hannibal on the run in Italy storyline from the book Hannibal (which is actually post Silence of the Lambs) with a little Hannibal Rising mixed in, and the second being their telling of the Red Dragon story.  The third season picks up in Italy telling in flashbacks for the first few episodes what happened post Hannibal and Bedelia getting on a plane after Hannibal basically left all the other characters for dead in his house at the end of season 2.  Then it picks up with the story of the bounty that Mason Verger places on Hannibal's head, while Will and Jack are in Italy trying to track him down.

The tie in to Hannibal Rising is interesting in that we see Will travel to Hannibal's family home where his sister died, which ultimately turned Hannibal into what he is.  Instead of casting his aunt (which would not have worked for this story) his aunt's servant basically becomes Hannibal's protector.  After those events play out, the show then gets into the Red Dragon story with Richard Armitage (most recently known for his role in the Hobbit trilogy) playing the Francis Dolarhyde role.  Rutena Wesley from True Blood plays his romantic interest in this adaptation, and both do a great job with their characters.  Again we get the twists on the story with some of the same iconic scenes being played out but with a slightly different bent.  The show ends with an almost literal cliffhanger which I will not spoil.  It set up to be either a season or series finale, and ends up working very well and leaving you wonder about where they would have taken the story had a fourth season materialized.

Ultimately you have to look at the show as its own thing.  While the first season could be looked at as being a set up to the movies that existed, once they started incorporating more of the novels in the second and third season, it really became its own entity.  Of course some characters were added or changed significantly (like Freddie being a woman, Alan Bloom becoming Alanah Bloom, and Dr Chilton and to some extent Will Graham taking on much more expanded roles), it stayed true to the base stories told in the novels, but adapted it to a modern day setting.  Hugh Dancy and Mads Mikkelson took the characters that ended up being written much differently than the novels portrayed them, and certainly much different than Anthony Hopkins or Edward Norton portrayed them, and made them their own.  The show ultimately ended up being about their bromance and not being able to live with or without the other.

For those who get the blu ray set, the show looks and sounds great.  There are a ton of extra features including commentary on many episodes, usually Bryan Fuller and one of the cast members, deleted scenes, a gag reel, several postmortem shorts which were basically cast and show runner interviews, a short feature on the show's fan base, and a 2 hr behind the scenes set of features about their adaptation of the Red Dragon story.  A ton of material for those who like going through the extras.  If you are in any way a fan of the show it is a must have.",1450483200,4,3562,4.629570747217806

I advise the reader to watch the movie ""Adam's Apples"" with Mikkelsen, quite the contrast with this role, but equally enjoyable.

7452664,5,B015WLJUYS,"I just finished watching Season 3, or as it is now known, the final season of Hannibal, and I have to say it's a little bit heartbreaking. I've been a huge fan of this show since its first few episodes, and though it was hanging on by a thread in the ratings after Seasons 1 and 2, I was hopeful that its critical acclaim and rabid fanbase would be enough to keep it around until everybody else caught on. Unfortunately, that won't be the case and we'll never get to find out how amazing things could have been had the show been allowed to adapt The Silence of the Lambs. This season is divided into two halves, the first of which finishes off the adaptation of the book Hannibal, and the second that focuses solely on the novel Red Dragon. Accordingly, the first half of the season is pure gothic horror, bizarre, surreal, and disturbing. While several character outcomes are distorted or rearranged, it's more faithful to events in the book than the first two seasons while expertly substituting both Will Graham and Alana Bloom for Clarice Starling's parts. Then, the show becomes truly greater than it's ever been with the addition of Richard Armitage (The Hobbit's Thorin Oakenshield) as Francis Dolarhyde. The entire Red Dragon arc is by far the closest the show has followed its source material, but the first two seasons have served to breathe new life into a story that has already been adapted to film twice before. The backstory and relationships between all of the principle characters give this story so much more vitality than it's ever had, it crushes me even more that they won't be able to do Silence of the Lambs. Sadly, the show never had the rights to that novel, but had hopes that they'd be attainable somewhere along the line. Since it never happened, they use Graham and Bloom in place of Starling in the first half of the season, then Bloom again in the final episode. While only a brief nod to ""Lambs,"" Bloom comes to Hannibal with an offer from the FBI, one that facilitates his escape from prison. Although the reason for the offer and its outcome are far different from ""Lambs,"" it's an obvious allusion to Thomas Harris's most famous story. Instead, knowing that the show would not be resurrected by another platform, the last episode offers finality to both main characters, and closes the door on any future attempt to revive the series. Make no mistake, it's a beautifully tragic way to finish off the connection between Will and Hannibal, but it's bitterly disappointing to see it all come to an end. Thanks are in order to Bryan Fuller, the writers, and the enthralling actors that made this show such a masterpiece. The only consolation is knowing that Will and Hannibal will not only be together forever, but will both provide one last meal before they depart. And in that regard, they will always have a leg up on poor, shattered Bedelia.

*Edit- After the finale, Bryan Fuller stated in an interview that Martha Stewart of all people was trying to get financing to back a Hannibal feature film, likely as a TV mini-series, but that was afterward retracterd as a ""mistatement."" He seems very enthusiastic to finish off his vision of Hannibal and Will, suggesting that they somehow survive the final episode. While I'm hopeful, I just don't see it happening, but he mentioned Bedelia hiding her fork at the end of the finale, a possible clue that Hannibal is still alive. Only time will tell.",1444867200,3,3429,4.696013289036545
7452665,5,B015WLJUYS,"Poor Bryan Fuller. He just can't ever seem to get a big break. Being the creative mind behind extremely fun and quirky shows like WONDERFALLS and PUSHING DAISIES and the showrunner of this show, network television doesn't seem to be his venue. Despite nearly universal critical acclaim and a fanatical fan base, NBC just couldn't foresee a future with HANNIBAL; so much so that after they had announced that they would be cancelling this show, they pretty much stopped caring about even showing ads for the show after about the seventh episode.
This didn't stop this final season from going out with one hell of a bang, though.
The season concentrates very specifically on two things: the first of which is adapting Thomas Harris' novel ""Hannibal"" within the confines of the universe this show had created. It initially shows Hannibal (Mads Mikkelsen) and his therapist/lover/hostage/enabler/participant Bedelia Du Maurier (Gillian Anderson), after leaving almost every single protagonist on the show for dead in the previous season finale, including Will Graham (Hugh Dancy), Jack Crawford (Laurence Fishburne) and Alana Bloom (Caroline Dhavernas), inject themselves into the upper-class intelligentsia of Rome, where Hannibal is pretending to be at least two other people, one of which is a brilliant professor. He doesn't seem to take too long to go back to his cannibalistic ways, but there seems to be a recklessness to it. And after the convalescence of Will and Alana and Jack, they are soon back in the hunt in their own ways. But there are a few more players that are in the fray as well. Mason Verger (now played by Joe Anderson) is hideously deformed after Hannibal (and Will, kind of) made him eat his own face, is putting out a bounty on Dr. Lecter that certain Italian cops would like to collect and is also being helped by his sister Margot (Katharine Isabelle), who Alana is in a relationship with now. Possibly amongst those is Rinaldo Pazzi (Fortunato Cerlino), an investigator who had a run-in with Lecter in his youth. Pazzi had dubbed him Il Mostro not just for the monstrous ways he murdered people, but for the people he was murdering. Will decides rather than staying in Italy, he must go to the one place Hannibal can never go back to: his family home in Lithuania. It is there that he discovers a mysterious and beautiful woman named Chiyoh (Tak Okamoto) who had worked as maid to Hannibals aunt, and is keeping the man who may be responsible for Hannibals sisters death. Chiyoh ends up being manipulated by Will (or does she?) into helping him find Hannibal, but doesnt quite help him in the way he wanted. It is at this point that Hannibal confronts Pazzi in his role as a headhunter for Verger, but almost immediately after is confronted by Jack who has also come to Rome. Hannibal escapes that confrontation in the nick of time, but is soon captured along with Jack and Will by Vergers thugs. Brought back stateside, things of course go wrong for Verger, but instead of escaping, Hannibal turns himself in to the FBI, primarily out of his undeniable love for Will.

Its at this point that the show brings out the second part of the season which is the story its been wanting to do since nearly the beginning; the adaptation of the Harriss first Lecter/Will novel Red Dragon. Now this is a story that has appeared on film twice in the last 29 years: first as Michael Manns brilliant MANHUNTER (which really downplayed Lecter to focus more on Will), and Brett Ratners barely palatable RED DRAGON (which really played up Lecter since this is after Anthony Hopkins had made the role iconic after his Oscar win for SILENCE OF THE LAMBS). But clearly Fuller wants to have his cake and eat it too, so he splits his time somewhat evenly on Hannibal, Will, but gives the most time to the new player, Francis Dolarhyde aka The Tooth Fairy aka The Great Red Dragon (played by Richard Armitage). It has been two years since the events that ended the previous arc of the season and Will is dragged back by Jack into the life he was trying to get away from by solving the case of two families that were murdered in the exact same way in two different states and with seemingly no connection. Naturally, Will must align with Hannibal once again, who is now in the state hospital run by Alana and assisted by Dr. Frederick Chilton (Raul Esparza). Will is now married to Molly (Nina Arianda), and was trying to live the simple life with her and her son until Jack brings him back into the fold. Dolarhyde is tortured in his life by both his impulses to kill and the love he feels for his coworker Reba (Rutina Wesley), but is also obsessed with Lecter who he finds a way of communicating with that ends up putting Wills family in danger. Of course this leads to a collision of our three main characters in the finale of the series that, while being very different from the ending of the book as well as the two other film adaptations, is possibly the most impactful.

Now, I have not read any of the books, but whatever creative liberties that Fuller and Co. have taken with this show are, from what I know and what I can tell, justified in order to tell the type of story that he wanted to tell. In just the Red Dragon arc, I know that there were several changes from page to screen, but it really doesnt matter since there are already two other adaptations out there. This is Fullers design from beginning to end.

The season, though, is problematic from the start. I never felt too strongly connected to the first arc until the end, and while the film is beautifully acted and has such lush settings and strong themes, it still felt a little too sterile. But once the Red Dragon arc kicks into gear, the show just starts giving off the same vibe it did from the first two seasons. While there aren't nearly enough scenes between Hannibal and Will, that seems to be a conscious choice to leave their reunion until the very end when it made the most sense and had the most impact. The murders are still masterpieces of gore and beauty that work within the themes laid out for the characters.

At the shows heart, though, it is a love story of two men. Romantic, platonic, familial; its all up for interpretation by the viewer. Throughout the first two seasons of the show, it was already firmly established that Hannibal and Will are symbiotic. One simply cannot really exist without the other, and that has always been the shows greatest strength. And of course, Mikkelsen and Dancy are more than equal to the task of making that work without it being overt. And of course, every cast member is pretty brilliant as well, with maybe the exception of Anderson taking over for Michael Pitt as Verger who seems to be doing not much more than an impression of what Gary Oldman did with the same character in Ridley Scotts film adaptation of Hannibal. Even Rutina Wesley who I absolutely loathed in TRUE BLOOD does career-high work here. But if theres one standout this season, its Armitage. He plays Dolarhyde so perfectly that it eclipses the previous work of Tom Noonan in MANHUNTER and even the great Ralph Fiennes in RED DRAGON.

Most of the first arcs episodes were directed by Vincenzo Natali (who is perhaps best known for his cult film CUBE), who has been working on the show for a while and has done such a great job. Once the Red Dragon arc started up, the directors started rotating pretty heavily, with such names as Guillermo Navarro (primarily a cinematographer who has worked with Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino and Guillermo Del Toro), John Dahl (director of films like THE LAST SEDUCTION, RED ROCK WEST and ROUNDERS as well as episodes of shows such as THE AMERICANS and JUSTIFIED), and Neil Marshall (the director of films like CENTURION, DOG SOLDIERS, THE DESCENT and has worked on episodes of GAME OF THRONES). Despite this rotation, the visual components that the show has displayed and its consistent level of technical mastery remain uniform.

The last, best thing that I can say about HANNIBAL is that, to be honest, it was miraculous that it lasted as long as it did. I thought for certain that it was going to be cancelled after its first season, but then it got picked up for a second one, and even then, I was sure that the second season would be its last. So to get three seasons of what has certainly been the best show on network television we were lucky to have them. Of course, after the cancellation was announced, Fuller seemed to fight tooth and nail to get an agreement with some other channel, or with a streaming service with original programming like Netflix or Amazon. Alas, those were not meant to be.

And after the finale, I pray they never will. After you see it, youll understand why that was the perfect ending to a pretty much perfect show.",1444521600,51,8803,4.646341463414634
