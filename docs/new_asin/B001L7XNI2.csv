8317511,3,B001L7XNI2,"Overall, I felt the same about the TV series as I did about the books in that the characters start to seem less interesting and the plots just sort of slog around in Season 4. Again, this happens in the books so maybe it is just the nature of the series and characters. There are a few bright spots but it is probably a good thing that there are only 4 entries for this season.",1526601600,,377,4.04
8317512,5,B001L7XNI2,Terrific UK detective duo series. One of the best. The episodes are set all over England making for variety.,1505001600,,108,4.7368421052631575
8317513,4,B001L7XNI2,"Did not dissapoint!  Enjoy the mystery of this series as well as the secondary story - the relationship between Inspector Lynley and and Sargeant Havers.  Oh!  And the episode where his wife dies.  I'll ignore the fact that the character had to be written out for one reason or another and just take the plot as is - dramatic.  I'm intrigued by the ""high brow"" Lynley choosing police work and the working relationship with the Sargeant that no one else wanted to work with as well as the personal dynamics between the two - which there is something very good about these two together despite their differences.",1429920000,,610,4.663551401869159
