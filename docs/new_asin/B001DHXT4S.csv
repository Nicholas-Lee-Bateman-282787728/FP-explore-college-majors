3530557,5,B001DHXT4S,"""Hawaii Five-O"" is one of the most entertaining and iconic detective shows in the history of television. It follows the exploits of Detective Captain Steve McGarrett, who serves as the head of the Hawaiian State Police Special Task Force known as Hawaii Five-O. Jack Lord delivers a perennially outstanding performance portraying the unflappable and intrepid Captain Steve McGarrett, in his mission to vanquish the criminal element in Hawaii. Although ""Hawaii Five-O"" now comes across as being somewhat comical, because its initial episodes are almost fifty-years-old, most viewers still find it to be enjoyable, especially because of the spectacular Hawaiian scenery. Therefore, I give ""Hawaii Five-O"" a five-star rating, along with my highest recommendation.",1485561600,,760,5.734513274336283

3530587,5,B001DHXT4S,"For being as old as it is, this is a fast paced action-cop series that lasted twelve years. The episodes fall into the adult category of the time, similar to the way The Untouchables fell into that role. Each show demands absolute attention, and the pacing is incredibly fast. There is little wasted time spent on mediocre scenes. If there is any complaint, it is that the show lacks the personality of the new series (also highly rated). McGarrett is a tough cop who approaches his role of head of Hawaii's State Police (Five-0) in the same manner that Jack Webb approached his role in Dragnet. There is no voice over, so the two shows bear little resemblance to each other. However, the series is television drama at its best for the 1960s.",1453334400,,742,4.586466165413534

3530610,4,B001DHXT4S,"Sometimes old shows are enjoyable not for their writing, acting, plot lines, or even its premise. Sometimes its the music, the visual effects, iconic language or phrases. So it is with this series, introducing an up and coming new (island of) Hawaii, in this series Hawaii Five O (50th state). It was still an obscure destination by most viewers,
It's a series about the Main (island) of city reality, as hard as any, with all the trouble. Its opening scenes offered bold, exciting music and visuals of exciting modern island life, with visuals of the still old, then, green landscape, nature, beautiful clear water, warm climate, sunshine forever and more to offer, on the smaller (outer islands).  It enticed city folk to go to a warm climate that stayed mostly the same all year. Not long after its beginning, it put Hawaii on the larger map, drawing tourists and viewers alike. But even earthly paradises have enticements of their own, and law and order must finally push in.

This show revealed both sides of the coin, the modern with its typical modern city issues of crime, lawlessness of every kind, poverty, the older-the breakdown of traditional family, and ""growing"" problems equal to all others, and came as a shock to many viewers.
It enticed with a slice of heaven, on a green patch of land-called tourism. And it worked...as well as keeping viewers coming back to the show itself with its theme music, car chases around the island to get the (island) bad guy, sunshine glaring, which is easy to watch. And of course the handsome Jack Lord as McGarrett, Island native, Kono, and James MacArthur as Book'em Danno!
This show is fun to watch, as I continue on toward its ended series.",1437782400,,1695,4.7815699658703075

3530634,5,B001DHXT4S,"I noticed one ""review"" complain about ""complete"" collection.  It never makes that claim.  It just says ""First Season"".

I was just a child when I watched this originally (even there, I'm dating myself) and always enjoyed it.

I strongly disagree with the tone of the Amazon.com ""review"" that seems to indicate you're either a nostalgia nut or crazy if you like these shows (if not both).  Besides -- what's wrong with nostalgia.

I enjoy the early days of this series.  The flashing light during the ending credits is just as hard to watch now as it was years ago but there is just no replacing the quality of this series.

I had purchased the FULL series but had problems with a few disks and returned it.  Both disks that I found bad for the first season in that set were fine in this set.  It's hard to watch when the last 10 - 15 minutes skips and freezes on you!

I'm very pleased and it brought back a lot of memories from WAY back in 1968!

I'm working towards getting the whole series one season at a time!

3530636,5,B001DHXT4S,"Until 1968, most television series aired on the three major networks were largely Hollywood products. Hawaii Five-O was done entirely on location in the Hawaiian islands where millions of fans were exposed to its tropical scenery and Hawaiian life.

The first season is all here on seven discs. The seventh disc features a Hawaiian retrospective in 1996 behind the scenes with Leonard Freeman's widow and Jack Lord's wife. Unfortunately, Jack Lord was too ill to appear in the special. The retrospective paid a lovely tribute to Jack Lord while he was still living.

The first series featured guest performances by Ricardo Montalban, Nancy Malone, Gavin McLeod, Farley Granger, Jeannette Nolan, Sally Kellerman, Joanne Linville and others as well.

I have yet to see the updates series of the same name. I enjoyed the first season of the original series with Jack Lord who was 48 years old at the time. This series was more character driven than action driven and I prefer that in a crime drama series.",1414886400,,1002,4.9523809523809526

3530658,4,B001DHXT4S,"Mistake #1: The title of this series is, was and always will be ""Hawaii Five-0"" with a zero, not a letter.  The title was derived from the fact that Hawaii is the 50th state.  You can't write the number 50 with a letter.  CBS gets it wrong, Amazon gets it wrong and reviewers get it wrong. The new series also is ""Hawaii Five-0"" although for a different reason, but it is still based on the number 50.  There is no need to differentiate between the titles of the two series.  There have been three series of ""The Twilight Zone"" (so far) and all three used the same title.

Mistake #2:  The liner notes state ""All 24 action-packed Season One Episodes plus the original TV pilot movie.""
This is incorrect.  There were only 23 episodes in the first season.  The notes should indicate ""All 23 episodes plus the pilot"" OR ""All 24 episodes INCLUDING the pilot.""",1397347200,,855,4.464516129032258

3530668,1,B001DHXT4S,"Hawaii Five-O is the quintessence of 'inarticulate cop shows'. It features a party of specially appointed fascist cops who ""clean up the city"". I can't imagine any kid actually liking these goof balls since they take all the boisterous action out of life.

Jack Lord plays an overtly self righteous cop who probably drinks peach juice for fun. He's a lead face, wooden megalomaniac with a stiff dead squirrel hairdo on his head, who barks out orders to some of the dumbest cops on TV. Most are wooden as well. But, they always have more brains than the dirty low down scum that they bust. Jack Lord fights guys thrice his size and comes out on top, the team suddenly cracks the case using absurd generalities, and Hawaii is shown in the crummy 60's. There's never any women that aren't wearing mini skirts or having any brains.

The show lacks any real intelligence, going from point A to point B rather quickly and the crime is always solved so the drama is sorely lacking. If you see one episode, don't worry, 300 more are just like it.",1387411200,,1038,4.545454545454546

The very first episode knocked my socks off. Some old TV shows don't age very well and end up not being as good as I remembered. But Hawaii Five-O didn't disappoint and I enjoyed every episode of season 1.

3530672,5,B001DHXT4S,"I became dissatisfied with TV fifteen or twenty years ago when prime-time viewing began featuring unfunny sitcoms, unreal reality shows and melodramatic dramas. Then they started producing DVDs of old shows, so I decided to collect the best of them to watch anytime .
 So far Ive bought DVDs of forty shows. Ive found some fine shows, such as Matlock and Trapper John, which I missed the first time around.
One of the most pleasant surprises to me was the rediscovery of Hawaii Five-0 starring Jack Lord as state police Chief Steve McGarrett. If you watched the first five minutes of that show, you were hooked by immediate, intense drama. It was much more than just, Book em, Danno. This was a truly excellent show, probably the best mystery-suspense thriller of all-time.
It was an extraordinary cop show, even though some members of the cast were inexperienced actors recruited locally in the Honolulu area to give the show a more authentic sense of place.
Jack Lord was terrific as the relentless McGarrett. The show even had a super villain in the Chinese Red commandant Wo Fat (Khigh Dhiegh). The friction between the clever Dhiegh and the relentless McGarrett remained unresolved at the close of the shows twelve seasons.
Here are the ten shows I watch most often in a delightful fare of prime-time DVD viewing: 1. Little House on the Prairie; 2. Touched by an Angel; 3. The Closer; 4. Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman; 5. Bonanza; 6. Hawaii Five-0 (the original show with Jack Lord); 7. The Dick Van Dyke Show; 8. Highway to Heaven; 9. Wings; 10.

Having said that, it was a pleasure seeing the old Five-O shows.  I enjoyed seeing Hawaii as it was at the time the show was made.  Part of the episode ""Six Kilos"" was shot in Hilo and the park on the bay is much like it is today.

The cars for the season were provided by Ford Motor company.  All of Five-O officers drive Ford products.  It one of the episodes the villain is driving a Cadillac with the big fins.  I thought it was by far the best looking car on the show.",1378944000,,683,4.0

3530699,5,B001DHXT4S,"In the title of my review, what I'm trying to say is that the original Hawaii Five-0 was the type of television we (the United States) used to export to the rest of the world. And it were characters like Steve McGarrett that epitomized the American ideal in regard to ethical law enforcement and strict dealings with the criminal element. This realization was the big take-away I had after watching the first season of this classic show, that and the fact that I wanted to watch more. I guess what I'm saying is that we no longer export this kind of entertainment to the rest of the world and because of that, we suffer for it.

This first season, originally broadcast in 1968, is interesting, quirky, and entertaining. Steve McGarrett, the head of Hawaii's Five 0 division, is of course the main focus with his no-nonsense approach to police detective work. He's willing to go to any length to catch the crooks. This includes some undercover work that sometimes borders on the ridiculous, yet succeeds because of McGarrett's boyishly honest sacrifice to put himself on the line. Check out the episode, ""Six Kilos"", where McGarrett teams up with the bad guys on a Mission Impossible-like heist to steal heroin for an unknown crime boss.

The scenery is of course beautiful, the Hawaiian settings, whether on the beach or in the city and suburbs, are lush with blowing palm trees and Southern Pacific skies. Its so very interesting to view the world of the late 1960's, with the cars, the clothing and the hairstyles. In particular, I found the female of this time period to be very alluring, despite or in fact because of the fact that the dress styles were more modest and appealing, more womanly I would say. McGarrett is obviously attractive to the ladies, but he doesn't mix police work with pleasure, unless he's putting on the act.

There are some strange moments in this season as well, such as Ricardo Montalbon playing a Japanese guy with very odd/fake looking eyes. They must have realized how silly it looked right? The depiction of the 1960's hippies was also quite amusing, such as in the episode ""Up Tight"", which includes some psychedelic drug scenes that are truly spaced out man. This counter culture topic was better handled in the episode ""Not That Much Different"" where a murder upsets the politics of a group of hippies running ""Peace"" magazine.

Overall, I had a fun time watching this show. Jack Lord as McGarrett and the supporting cast, were all very good. The Hawaii flavor and the 1960's time period were so cool, just like McGarrett, not the ugly American at all, rather the type of man that used to be the America hero.",1373414400,,2648,4.725108225108225

Bought it because i lived in Hawaii during the late sixties / early seventies, and I enjoy seeing the familiar places again.

Quality of tape was good. The acting, and overacting, of some of the extras and ""Guests"" is occasionally less than great,but it is not really a problem, as their selling point is scenery.

The good part is that you get to see some of the most photogenic locations in Hawaii, including the pineapple fields, Iolani Palace (home of the old kings) along with some of the ""high end"" beach houses along the coast, as well as some of the grungiest (unfortunately) areas, such as ""Hotel Street"" in the old China Town area, along with a lot of cluttered docks, and rusty ships.

But be prepared - as the episodes were ordered for us, it seems the pilot episode came at the end of the season. Danny was gone... the governor, gone. Who were these folks? Its funny now :-) looking back at it.

But if you like most of the opening sequence shots you'll find most of them came from that one episode.

TV drama today is so well produced that each episode is like a mini-movie. Since I am a big fan of the new Hawaii Five-0, I thought I might find the original dated and lacking in production quality. I was pleasently suprised and really enjoyed watching these original episodes. It was a bit like catching up with an old friend after being separated for a few decades. Dated? Yes? Lower budget production? Of course. But really great, well written stories kicking off with the pilot premeir which introduced that ultimate Five-0 baddy, Wo Fat! Another surprise was the video quality, which is excellent with vibrant colors and fairly sharp rendition.

From time to time, a minor character may be played poorly, but the mainstays are strong and work well together from week to week.  Watching in HD is phenomenal!  These were produced in the late 60's but the digital process has allowed the production to have some pop and color that makes them appear crisp and new.  The scenery of Hawaii has the charm and beauty that makes the state a popular tourist destination.  This is greatly enhanced by the digitization.

Clever and amusing storylines and some pretty cool camera-work are elements that I didn't appreciate when I was younger but obviously registered with many viewers given the show's long-running success.  Even some of the 60s and 70s low-budget stuff is campy and really fun to watch.

I also have always been infatuated with the Hawaian Islands so I thought what better way to see Hawaii (besides going there) than to watch the TV series that put Hawaii on the map. Known for its stunning visual effects of Hawaii, its sometimes campy yet enjoyable scripts and Jack Lord's perfect hair, ""Hawaii Five O"" has cemented itself as a TV classic that has never gone out of style.

 Season 1 features the series' full 24 episodes, come uncut and look breathtakingly beautiful as CBS has done a remarkable job in restoring the shows. The series' pilot episode called ""Cocoon"" is included and is produced like a big-feature film with action scenes, a great villin and surpises that will put you on the edge of your seat.

They are just *gorgeous* - spectacular color, high resolution, and nearly total freedom from noise/glitches/specks.  Those who are used to the garbage that passes for TV entertainment today will be stunned by the sheer scale (and expense) of these productions.  There's no one-set, two-camera canned-laughter, chroma-keyed sitcom drivel here.

Give them a try, especially if you're ready to take a trip back to the 60s for 50 minutes.  You won't be disappointed.

Brief followup:  There is a clear difference in the appearance of these (and several others I've compared) videos when delivered online to a computer and when played on my Roku boxes.

3530777,4,B001DHXT4S,"Jack Lord was a well known actor before Hawaii Five-O, in fact he was offered the job of Captain Kirk, but the sides couldn't agree to terms when he demanded a piece of ownership in the show and the role of Co-Producer. While I think Jack would have made a fine Captain Kirk, we can all be thankful that he was free to play the role of Steve McGarret in this show, which had a long and distinguished run.

I'm sure the ""re-imagined"" version of the show now in its second season (and a fine show in its own right) has probably rekindled interest in the original. Joining Jack Lord were James MacArthur (son of Helen Hayes) as ""Dano"", Zulu as Kono, and Kam Fong as Chin Ho (I always wondered why they bothered with different screen names for the last two actors LOL). McGarret was a tough investigator and a tough boss. In the first episode Danny Williams complains about a policewoman going undercover on a dangerous assignment. McGarret dismisses him abruptly by essentially saying ""Not your decision, now go do your job"". Dano wasn't happy. That kind of tension between the leads wouldn't be maintained, but viewers would have plenty of tension in the resolution of the crimes to replace it.

The crimes were always interesting and different from other cop shows of the day. They were a bit like Columbo in that you normally knew ""who done it"" right at the start, and then watched as Five-O unearthed and apprehended the bad guys. Jack Lord played McGarret with just the right amount of hard edge, and the other roles meshed perfectly with his.

The Amazon streaming video of this series is supposed to be in HD, but it doesn't look all that good. There is a lot of grain and film damage evident that was not remastered to improve, and for that reason I hold back one star from this presentation of the series. The sound is good however, and I'm sure it sounds better than in the original broadcasts.

However, this series has not been in syndication for quite some time, so it is worth watching this version if you are a fan, and the picture is certainly no worse than the years old tape that been used for re-runs. I will say that the stories are captivating enough that the poor picture quality will quickly become lost to your senses.

If you are an Amazon Prime Member, this series is free to stream to either your computer or any of the myriad internet enabled TVs, Blu ray players, or other boxes that do that trick.

3530778,5,B001DHXT4S,"Note: I have not yet seen the special feature included on disc 7.

Two months before a relative of mine bought me the first season of the ORIGINAL Hawaii Five-O, I saw the season finale of the reboot Hawaii Five-0. I have vague memories of watching the opening credits of this series with my grandfather (who enjoyed classic shows like this one, ""The Incredible Hulk,"" ""Cannon,"" ""Barnaby Jones,"" ""Quincey,""
""Matlock,"" and ""The Streets Of San Fransisco""), but now, I get to experience this series in its entireity.

This first (and most famous) incarnation has solid storylines that maintain your interest throughout. Very little drama, action or suspense, though. Aside from the obvious fact that the title of this series ends with the letter O and the reboot uses the number 0, this one emphasizes story and dialogue over anything else. The reboot emphasizes action, drama, suspense and even some romance. To each his own, but I personally like both series' and can't wait for the second season of Hawaii Five-0. I'm also interested in the second season of Hawaii Five-O. The guest stars are very good in their roles, and of course, McGarrett utters his famous catchphrase ""Book 'em, Danno,"" which a security guard in the middle school I went to always said to me whenever he saw me, though I never understood why until I got interested in this series and the reboot.

My recommendation is, buy BOTH series'. You won't regret it. Both have the same theme music and the famous catchphrase.",1314748800,,1489,4.854330708661418
3530779,4,B001DHXT4S,"Hawaii Five-O, First Season

This long-running series was famous for its high-energy theme song. Some said it symbolized the energy and excitement of surfing (invented in Hawaii). It was filmed entirely on location in Hawaii, a pioneering event for television. The first show had different actors for the ""Governor"" and ""Danny Williams"". In this series ""Steve McGarrett"" is the head of the State Police, called ""Five-O"", and now a code word. You would think a high-level official would spend time on administration duties (paper work) and politics. Instead he is involved with low-level activities like a small town police chief. But Hollywood provides entertainment and drama, not realistic history. I noticed a range of quality in these stories from different writers. Many of these stories could have been located in Los Angeles or Las Vega. This series went on for twelve seasons with much of the original cast. McGarrett is often shows with anger-management problems.

The ""Pilot"" was a two-hour television movie. The idea of Red Chinese agents spying in Hawaii was often used until the mid 1970s. A form of political brainwashing? Wasn't that ""cocoon"" invented at a US university from federal funding in the 1960s? The villains are stymied or caught in the end.
""Full Fathom Five"" involves a scheme to marry and kill wealthy widows for their money. This story about a blue-beard ends in a shoot-out.
""Strangers in Our Own Land"" is about the land development that harms people. The story about an assassination recorded on a movie camera and the death of a `patsy' recalls the 1960s.
""Tiger by the Tail"" is about the kidnapping of a singer in a nightclub. Will they collect a big reward? Was this based on a true crime from the 1960s?
""Samurai"" involves organized crime and an assassination. A sniper on a grassy knoll shoots. Do some scenes recall a Hitchcock movie? Could a WW II Japanese naval officer live in Hawaii for many years?
""And They Painted Daisies On His Coffin"" involves stolen auto parts that are traded for drugs. The investigation clears Danny Williams from a shooting charge.

""Twenty-Four Karat Kill"" is about smuggling gold into Hawaii. McGarrett ends this racket. [Owning gold was illegal at this time.]
""The Ways of Love"" is about burglary where a portable X-ray machine is used to detect the lock combination on a safe. McGarrett solves the crime.
""No Blue Skies"" is about smuggling that involves a singer. Does a young woman know too much and has to be silenced?
""By the Numbers"" involves soldiers from Vietnam who go to Hawaii to meet their wives. There is gambling and crime here.
""Yesterday Died and Tomorrow Won't Be Born"" is a message movie that argues for the 1968 Gun Control law. A discharged veteran seeks revenge on those who helped to convict him.
""Deathwatch"" involves the assassination of a prosecutor and the theft of evidence from his safe. If the thief is murdered how will they track the man who ordered this crime?

""Pray Love Remember"" involves a Cultural Institution that aids small nations. A young woman was strangled. Was it her boyfriend or a thief who left no witnesses?
""King of the Hill"" is about a wounded veteran who imagines he is back in combat. Can Danny be saved through a peaceful solution?
""Up-Tight"" involves a professor who encourages students to use mind-altering drugs. One student's father seeks poetic justice. Then we see the same location as in the beginning.
""Face of the Dragon"" has the unusual story of an outbreak of bubonic plague! Was it caused by a Red Chinese spy? Can McGarrett catch this agent and end ""Asian flu""?
""The Box"" tells about a prison revolt that captures hostages. McGarrett convinces them to get their demands printed in the newspaper. This ends the revolt.
""One for the Money"" is about murders committed for an inheritance. McGarrett figures it out and catches the murderer.

""Along Came Joey"" is about a boxing match that may be fixed. McGarrett solves the crime. [Does it remind you of ""On The Waterfront""?]
""Once Upon a Time"" has two parts. It involves medical treatments that are not scientifically proven. Can this quack be stopped and jailed? There are emotional involvements for McGarrett. There is a very dramatic courtroom scene that exposes the fraud. [Remember diathermy machines?]
""Not That Much Different"" is about a shooting at a peace demonstration. Who did it? And why? McGarrett says arms are needed for protection. McGarrett gets a confession from the murderer.
""Six Kilos"" is about a team organized to burglarize a safe that is guarded on a yacht. It succeeds, then fails. McGarrett catches the secret organizer for a surprise ending.
""The Big Kahuna"" involves an attempt to inherit valuable property by creating an hallucination for a wealthy old man. Can McGarrett arrive in time to save Sam. [Was this story unintentionally funny?]

3530782,5,B001DHXT4S,"This is a super show that lasted 12 seasons, 11 with James MacArthur(Danno), and that was not just a great hit drama series, but was also filmed on location- a rarity in those days.

This is a nice collection.  Even though, I grew up watching these as a kid- making sure to get to the tv before it started, so I could see that fantastic intro- so far, I can't remember if stuff is left out from the original series.  Some of the other reviewers mention previews or a scene or two missing, I can't tell.  But I do enjoy them.

The late 60's had issues- Vietnam war, protest, antiestablisment, assassinations, student discontent, 'sex, drugs and rock and roll, baby', hippie generation, odd colors and clothes, big cruisers for cars.  One can sense it in the filming of this series and how the various stories are presented.  We definitely needed solid heroes, and the likes of McGarrett and Matt Dillon and others helped.

This is not family fare.  The tales are pretty violent; although; they don't show too much and there's no language or sex seen.  One might see blood stains on the shirt.  Most things are implied with a cutaway.

They use a lot of locals in the production; however, I always found it odd that they prefer TV regulars like John Morley playing an Hawaian or Ricardo Montalban starring as a Japenese gangster- OK.  That's just what they did in those days, I guess.  And these guys would rotate through all the TV shows making guest appearances.  Unless they got their own series.

My favorite episodes involve Wo Fat- McGarrett's sinister, international, antagonist.  It's a bit of James Bondish type stuff and it runs off and on through the series starting with the pilot.  Otherwise, it's murder and mayhem in paradise as usual.

Compared to 21st century shows, the color, filming, music(except for the theme), stories and acting are dated to some extent. I'm fine with that and enjoy the shows and mysteries for what they are.  Hawai'i still looks the same to me, and it's a great place to escape to even to just watch Jack Lord put the bad guys away.",1298505600,,2072,4.624657534246575

I distinctly remember, from old 80`s prints, McGarrett pushing around then hitting Gavin MacLeod at the beginning of the second-last scene. Yet here, the scene opens with MacLeod`s mouth already bleeding, but the scuffle is missing. Also, the previous scene should have ended with the usual climactic tidal wave signalling a commercial break. This print has no wave after we see teenager Anne crying ""I loved him!""

As much as I loved looking at him, and marvelling at his acting, I admire and respect him even more so now.

I happened to come upon this amazing series when it had a marathon on cable tv this past summer.  It brought back a floodgate of wonderful memories and made me realize why I loved this show so many years ago.

I then got on a ""Hawaii Five-0"" mission to find all the seasons that I could on DVD.  I am happy to report that I am about to purchase Season 9!!  It truly proves to me why this show was on the air for 12 years!!  That does not happen unless a show is deserving of it, and this show deserved that distinction in spades!!  Superb writing!  Jack Lord was born to play Steve McGarrett.  There is no show on the air today that can even come remotely close to the intrigue of this incredible series.

Season 1 will propel viewers to purchase every other season as quickly as they can get their hands on them!!

Only until I heard of the new series and saw reruns on tv,it started me in collecting the series. Starting with 1 and 2 and eventually collecting all is my goal.

However, the next time you sit down to watch McGarrett and his boys, look for these things:

-Dan-o, Chin, Duke, Tank and all the others apparently do nothing but mill around at crime scenes until Steve shows up and begins issuing a string of amazingly obvious instructions to them.  ""See if anyone around here saw anything.""  ""Get that gun down to the lab"" ""Look around and see if there are any other witnesses,"" etc.

McGarrett apparently owns five or six thousand expensive suits, since he wears anywhere from three to five different ones in most shows.  He must have some clothing allowance, because he treats them like garbage; wading in the surf, crawling through bushes, leaning against dirty cars, etc.

The radio system in Hawaii is phenomenal, with patches going through in a matter of seconds, and McGarrett is never more than a step or two away from the radio when a call comes in for him.

Watching this show would make you wonder if everyone in Hawaii reports to McGarrett, as he regularly orders the Honolulu Police department, the Coast Guard and even the Navy around.  Doesn't anyone ever tell him to get lost?

McGarrett and all his minions apparently know nothing about preservation of evidence, almost always compromising crime scenes by picking up guns, using the phones, pawing over vehicles, etc.

Many people have said that this show was almost totally devoid of humor.  It's full of humor, you just have to look for it.",1267574400,,1538,4.7622641509433965

It amazes me when I remember hearing at the time Hawaii 5-O was on the air how it was the most violent show on T.V.

Jack Lord played the Head of 5-O, Steve McGarrett, beautifully.  He made the role believable and likable.  You couldn't wait to see how he led his team to solve crimes every week.  It took work, logic and a team effort to catch the criminals.  No computers or scientific wizardry.  It is a gritty crime drama that entertains.

3530797,5,B001DHXT4S,"Why it took so very long for Hawaii Five-0 to come out on DVD still mystifies me.  The show was a classic while it was still running, and it's remained a classic ever since.

One thing I want to clear up -- the show's title is Hawaii Five-0 -- that ""0"" is correctly a ZERO, not a letter.  The show was named after the USA's 50th state.

Many people -- Amazon.com included -- incorrectly assume the title is Hawaii Five-O [""O"" being the letter, not a zero], which makes searching for other seasons of the show difficult, because the only way what you're going to find what you want is to search using the ""O"" letter -- which annoys Five-0 buffs big time.  I hope Amazon takes note.

One other item:  during the entire 12 years that Five-0 ran on television, there was only ONE star:  Jack Lord.  All the other members of Five-0 were billed as ""feature"" players.  No matter who showed up as a guest actor or actress, NOBODY was ever billed as ""starring with"" -- Five-0 meant Jack Lord.  HE was the star.  The ONLY star.

The best thing about the DVDs -- and I've got all of them that are currently available -- is that they take us back to the actual time when the series was being filmed.  If a specific ""issue"" is treated in one particular episode, that issue was very specific when it comes to the history of the late 1960s and all of the 1970s.  Many episodes were considered daring at the time they aired -- Five-0 tackles Vietnam, organized crime, the Soviet threat [and of course, that of Red China], and struggle for the Hawaiian people who were -- and still are -- trying to maintain their Polynesian identity, and the show sometimes got downright daring AT THE TIME THE EPISODE FIRST RAN ON TV.

Five-0 tackled such stuff as venereal disease, political corruption, drug use which was so very prevalent at that time, and aired one two-part episode focusing on the US military and its secrecy about trying to create our own weapons of mass destruction.  Jack Lord was the first person in television history who ever uttered the word ""bastard"" on television.

Most folks who are new to the series do not understand what it was like to live in the late 60s and 70s, and not many know that much about the history of the period.  What seems ""tame"" to us now created all kinds of furor when viewed on television during those years.  Five-0 was forced to reinvent itself in the later years of its run, because of the nationwide furor about violence on television -- and if you've seen the show in recent years -- shows that have been badly chopped up, often to the point where the shows don't make a great deal of sense -- the DVDs will give you every single moment of what ran on television when commercial time was FAR less that what we put up with today.  When
Five-0 was forced to tone down the violence [and there's lots of violence in the first 6 or 7 years] and to keep the show running and maintain viewer interest, it turned to character study as a way of filling that gap.  Specifically, it became more cerebral -- but it worked.

So when you watch the first set of DVDs [and the later DVDs as well], keep in mind what life was like when leisure suits were ""HOT"" [they now look quite ghastly to me], disco music was sweeping the country [thanks to John Travolta] -- yep, McGarrett ends up in a disco himself, more than once -- and all kinds of other social matters were highly important, probably more important than they are today.

To watch Hawaii Five-0 [remember that zero!] is to remember history.  And now, as in the first place, the show managed to do that in great style.",1239148800,,3589,4.401515151515151

He's a lead face, wooden megalomaniac with a stiff dead squirrel hairdo on his head, who barks out orders to some of the dumbest cops on TV.  Most are wooden as well.

Jack Lord fights guys thrice his size and comes out on top, the team suddenly cracks the case using absurd generalities, and Hawaii is shown in the crummy 60's.

3530803,5,B001DHXT4S,"Hawaii Five-O is an American television series that starred Jack Lord and James MacArthur as detectives for a fictional Hawaii state police department. The show ran for 12 seasons, from 1968 to 1980, making it the longest running crime show on American television until the police drama Law & Order surpassed it in 2003. The twelfth season was repackaged into syndication under the title McGarrett.

The CBS television network produced the program from September 20, 1968 to April 5, 1980. Currently, the program is broadcast in syndication throughout the world and on-demand streaming media via CBS Interactive.[1] Created by Leonard Freeman, Hawaii Five-O was shot on location in Honolulu, Hawaii, and throughout the island of Oahu -- with occasional filming in other locales like Los Angeles, Singapore and Hong Kong as well as other Hawaiian islands.

Hawaii Five-O centers on a fictional state police force (named in honor of Hawaii's status as the 50th State)[2] led by former Navy officer Steve McGarrett (Jack Lord), who was appointed by the Governor Paul Jameson (Richard Denning). McGarrett was assisted regularly by State Police officers -- a young officer, Danny Williams (played with intensity by Tim O'Kelley in the show's pilot, but replaced in the regular series by James MacArthur), Chin Ho Kelly (Kam Fong) and Kono Kalakaua (Zulu). Later, Honolulu Police Department Officer Duke Lukela (Herman Wedemeyer) joined the team as a regular, as did Ben Kokua (Al Harrington) who replaced Kono. Occasionally, they were assisted by other officers on an ""as-needed"" basis. During the course of the show, the team was also assisted regularly by: medical examiner Doc Bergman (Al Eben), forensic specialist Che Fong (Harry Endo) and a secretary. The first secretary was May (Maggi Parker), then Jenny (Peggy Ryan) and later Luana (Laura Sode-Matteson).

For twelve seasons, McGarrett and his team hounded international secret agents, criminals, and Mafia syndicates plaguing the Hawaiian Islands. With the aid of District Attorney and later Hawaii's Attorney General John Manicote (Glenn Cannon), McGarrett was successful in sending most of his enemies to prison. One such Mafia syndicate was led by crime family patriarch Honore Vashon (Harold Gould), a character introduced in the fifth season. Blaming McGarrett for the death of his son, Vashon swore vengeance using all of the resources available to him. Most episodes of Hawaii Five-O ended with the arrest of criminals with McGarrett's catch phrase to Williams, ""Book 'em, Danno!"", with the offense occasionally added after this phrase, such as ""-Murder one!"". Other criminals and organized crime bosses on the islands were played by actors such as Ricardo Montalban, Gavin MacLeod, and Ross Martin as Tony Alika. For the 12th and final season, series regular James MacArthur had left the show (in 1996, he admitted he had got tired and wanted to do other things), as did Kam Fong after season 10. New characters Jim 'Kimo' Carew (William Smith), Lori Wilson (Sharon Farrell), and Truck (Moe Keale) were introduced in season 12 alongside returning regular Duke Lukela.

The Five-O team consisted of four to five members (small for a real state police unit) and was portrayed as occupying a suite of offices in the Iolani Palace. (The office interiors were a soundstage set.) Curiously, it lacked its own radio network, necessitating frequent requests by McGarrett to the Honolulu Police Department dispatchers to ""Patch me through to Danno"". McGarrett's tousled yet immovable hairstyle and proclivity for wearing a dark suit and tie on all possible occasions rapidly entered popular culture.

In many episodes (including the pilot), McGarrett was drawn into the world of international espionage and national intelligence. McGarrett's archnemesis was an intelligence officer of the People's Republic of China, Wo Fat. The Communist rogue agent was played by veteran actor Khigh Dheigh.

The show's action and straightforward story-telling left little time for personal stories such as wives and girlfriends, though a two-part story in the first season dealt with the loss of McGarrett's sister's baby. Occasionally, a show would flash back to McGarrett's younger years or to a romantic figure. The viewer is left with the impression that McGarrett, like Dragnet's Joe Friday, is wedded to the police force and to crime-fighting at this point in his life.

Hawaii Five-O survived long enough to see reruns of early episodes enter syndication while new episodes were still being produced. The 12th season was repackaged into syndication under the title McGarrett.
The show was the longest running crime show on American TV until the police drama Law & Order surpassed it in 2003. The popularity of the Hawaii Five-O format spawned various police dramas on all the major television networks since its debut. Another legacy is the popularity of the Hawaii Five-O theme song, composed by Morton Stevens and later covered by surf music band The Ventures and by Radio Birdman, a punk-era band from Sydney. A short cover can be seen at the end of the Massacre Palestina's song, ""Madamme X"". The song is particularly popular with college and high school marching bands, especially at the University of Hawai'i, where it has become the unofficial fight song. It also made a brief appearance in the animated film Shrek 2, when a trumpeter enthusiastically follows a fanfare with the first few bars of the theme song, and in the Australian film The Dish, about the Apollo XI moon landing, when a teenage Australian band mistakenly played it thinking it was the American national anthem.

While the location, theme song, and esemble cast made ""Hawaii Five-O"" one of the longest running police dramas in television history, the show is also noted for it's liberal use of exterior locations as ""sets"" throughout the entire 12 seasons, breaking the tradition of filming indoors as with the case for a typical TV series. A typical episode, on average, would have at least two-thirds of all footage shot outdoors.

The term ""Five-O"" was adopted by American youth culture as a street slang term for the police.

The television show Magnum P.I. was created after Hawaii Five-O ended its run in order to make further use of the production equipment left there. The first few episodes made direct references to Five-O, suggesting that it takes place in the same ""universe"" as the earlier show.

Criticism of the show pointed out that the vast majority of characters were Caucasian, while only 40% of the population of the state identify themselves as non-Hispanic Caucasian. However, many local people were used to play parts in the show. The first run and syndication was seen by an estimated 400,000,000 people around the world. Jack Lord was the only actor to appear in all episodes of Five-O and was the only original cast member remaining when its last episode aired in May 1980. He and Herman Wedemeyer were the only actors to appear in the first episode (excluding the pilot) and the last episode of the series.
MacArthur has said on talk show appearances that he calculates the Five-O team would have accounted for all major crime and criminals on the islands several times over.
The show continues to be seen in Hawaii since it left the air, thus making it the longest-running show to continue airing in the state after it ceased production. It is currently seen on Honolulu independent outlet KWHE.
At least 3 episodes were centered around Danno. One episode took us to his apartment, and a second one probed into his love life a bit. He was engaged to a woman whose death was the plot line of the episode. A third episode in 1976 has Danny dating an actress, Anne Waring (Meg Foster), who becomes a target of criminals.
In a 1st season episode, a two-parter ""Once Upon A Time"", we learn that McGarrett has a sister and a brother-in-law. The story line has McGarrett going to California to visit his sister and brother-in-law after learning that their infant son has cancer. A doctor is treating the baby with unethical methods to cure him, but the baby dies anyway. McGarrett seeks out the truth about the doctor and her unethical methods on patients.
Chin Ho Kelly had 8 kids, as we learned in a second season Five-O episode, Cry Lie. This seems to have been a family trait, as his many relatives were apparently involved in all facets of life in Hawaii, from laborers in the sugar cane fields to Honolulu policemen, bartenders, tour bus drivers, etc. -- and Kelly knew them all by name. This is actually authentic, as descendants of the early Chinese cane field laborers diversified throughout Hawaiian society, while maintaining family ties.
In the TV-movie pilot, McGarrett drove a Mercury 2-door hardtop, apparently a 1967 Marquis (1967 was the first year for the Marquis, and it was only available as a 2-door hardtop). This car had a black body, black vinyl roof, and a red interior. In the series, McGarrett's trademark vehicle, often seen squealing tires throughout Honolulu, was a triple-black 1968 Mercury Park Lane Brougham 4-door hardtop. In a recurring continuity error, footage of the 2-door hardtop appeared in many episodes of the series. Around the 1973/74 season, his Park Lane was replaced by a 1973 Mercury Marquis Brougham 4-door, used until the end of the series. In a new recurring continuity error, footage of the 1968 Mercury appears in many episodes after the Mercury Marquis Brougham replaced it. After the show, Jack Lord gave the 1974 Mercury car he drove on the show to his stunt man, Jack Nordlum.
The phone numbers that were dialed from various Honolulu-area phone booths throughout the run of the series were actual household numbers, which caused some ""invasion of privacy"" concerns for residents, even after the series ended; hence in the middle of the series run, the Honolulu phone prefix ""(808) 555-xxxx"" was to be used on every episode from then on.
James MacArthur was the son of stage and film legend Helen Hayes; Hayes guest starred on a 1975 episode of Hawaii Five-0, ""Retire to Sunny Hawaii"", playing Danny Williams' aunt.[8]
After their short-lived NBC series The Quest in 1976, Kurt Russell and Tim Matheson appeared together in the 1977 ""Deadly Doubles"" episode of Hawaii Five-O.[Jack Lord was the only actor to appear in all episodes of Five-O and was the only original cast member remaining when its last episode aired in May 1980. He and Herman Wedemeyer were the only actors to appear in the first episode (excluding the pilot) and the last episode of the series.

The show continues to be seen in Hawaii since it left the air, thus making it the longest-running show to continue airing in the state after it ceased production. It is currently seen on Honolulu independent outlet KWHE.
At least 3 episodes were centered around Danno. One episode took us to his apartment, and a second one probed into his love life a bit. He was engaged to a woman whose death was the plot line of the episode. A third episode in 1976 has Danny dating an actress, Anne Waring (Meg Foster), who becomes a target of criminals.
In a 1st season episode, a two-parter ""Once Upon A Time"", we learn that McGarrett has a sister and a brother-in-law. The story line has McGarrett going to California to visit his sister and brother-in-law after learning that their infant son has cancer. A doctor is treating the baby with unethical methods to cure him, but the baby dies anyway. McGarrett seeks out the truth about the doctor and her unethical methods on patients.
Chin Ho Kelly had 8 kids, as we learned in a second season Five-O episode, Cry Lie. This seems to have been a family trait, as his many relatives were apparently involved in all facets of life in Hawaii, from laborers in the sugar cane fields to Honolulu policemen, bartenders, tour bus drivers, etc. -- and Kelly knew them all by name. This is actually authentic, as descendants of the early Chinese cane field laborers diversified throughout Hawaiian society, while maintaining family ties.
In the TV-movie pilot, McGarrett drove a Mercury 2-door hardtop, apparently a 1967 Marquis (1967 was the first year for the Marquis, and it was only available as a 2-door hardtop). This car had a black body, black vinyl roof, and a red interior. In the series, McGarrett's trademark vehicle, often seen squealing tires throughout Honolulu, was a triple-black 1968 Mercury Park Lane Brougham 4-door hardtop. In a recurring continuity error, footage of the 2-door hardtop appeared in many episodes of the series. Around the 1973/74 season, his Park Lane was replaced by a 1973 Mercury Marquis Brougham 4-door, used until the end of the series. In a new recurring continuity error, footage of the 1968 Mercury appears in many episodes after the Mercury Marquis Brougham replaced it. After the show, Jack Lord gave the 1974 Mercury car he drove on the show to his stunt man, Jack Nordlum.
The phone numbers that were dialed from various Honolulu-area phone booths throughout the run of the series were actual household numbers, which caused some ""invasion of privacy"" concerns for residents, even after the series ended; hence in the middle of the series run, the Honolulu phone prefix ""(808) 555-xxxx"" was to be used on every episode from then on.
James MacArthur was the son of stage and film legend Helen Hayes; Hayes guest starred on a 1975 episode of Hawaii Five-0, ""Retire to Sunny Hawaii"", playing Danny Williams' aunt.[8]

And it's because of my high regard and respect for those who crafted it, and my own disappointment w/ OMITTED EPISODES, UNSPECIFIED EDITING, [disclaimer-ed on the boxes for all but the 1st Season] and somewhat poor quality (compared to better remastered DVDs from the same era & even some of my own Five-O recordings, which happens with low bandwidth digital conversions), that I am writing this poor review.  These look no sharper than some late 60's Cartoon sets I've purchased (which aren't bad - didn't mind for them & low prices).  It looks to me that they just converted these without any picture quality improvements (no ""HQ"", ""HIGH RES"", etc.); which they don't claim anyway.  I wish I had known (esp. about the missing ep & editing - I've found several cut scenes - see comments) before I enthusiastically emptied my wallet.  I could have saved the $36/set for the inevitable less $$$ Boxed Set with all that's missing here.

That's $36 x 12 Seasons, carry the one, = $432!!  ~1/2 a Grand for an INCOMPLETE, EDITED, NOT-SO-SHARPLY REMASTERED ""COLLECTION"".  For my money, if I like a series enough to own it and to pay for better quality than I can get from broadcasts, I want EVERY episode, unedited, and at least as clear as my own recordings.  You may consider waiting ~2 years (@ ~4 Seasons / year released) for the Boxed Set, which we've all seen in stores at Christmas for even much less popular series.  And Boxed Sets always have features to make them more attractive, such as ""high resolution digitally remastered"", ""previously unreleased episodes"", and ""un-edited original broadcasts"", the very things they haven't included in these, along with something like a Steve McGarrett replica badge or 1/25th scale Mercury.

These dvds were made in MEXICO. They're NOT a quality product. They're an insult to JACK LORD's years of dedication and work on the series.

3530810,5,B001DHXT4S,"Until I purchased this, I had never seen the pilot episode of ""Hawaii Five-O"".  Nor do I remember any of the other episodes featured in this set.  The show premiered just two years before I was born, and by the time that started watching it, it was already getting long in the tooth.

That being said, ""Hawaii Five-O"" was one of my favorite shows growing up, and to see how well the boys at CBS DVD and CBS Paramount Television pulled off the transfer to DVD is just touching.  It's a trip back in time to see not only the original Five-O gang (which included an actor named Tim O'Kelley as the first Danno and veteran actors Philip Ahn and Lew Ayers as the attorney general and governor, respectively), but to also see others who are now known as stars.  That includes Leslie Nielsen, Gavin McLeod and the late Ed Flanders, who appears in an episode in which art virtually imitated his tragic end in real life.

Back to ""Cocoon"", the pilot episode--virtually every iconic image associated with ""Hawaii Five-O"" appears in the original opening, which is preserved here.  That includes the famed wave, the 707 passing over the light towers on final approach to Honolulu International Airport, the hula dancer (whose face is seen in the pilot), and Lady Columbia, the statue at the National Cemetery in Punchbowl Crater.  Of course, the post-pilot episodes include the better known opening sequence and the original closing sequence, riding the back of a Honolulu police motorcycle down the street with the blue light flashing.

This was a treat for me to be able to see many of these episodes for the first time.

3530816,5,B001DHXT4S,"When Hawaii Five-O debuted, I was FIVE (5) years old. I was already in Kindergarten when the show started and it went off the air just before I graduated High school in 1981.

  Five-O was ""hot stuff"" when I was a lad, and tag lines like ""Book 'em, Danno"" were standard fare amongst us kids until we were hitting the 6th grade. This show introduced some interesting film shooting that carried over to other shows like it that followed, like ""Kojack"" and ""Baretta"" and set up the cinematography we enjoyed during ""Miami Vice"". That Hawaii Five-O looks dated to some isn't surprising, but, overall, I think the show holds up well even with some dated dialog and obviously wooden acting.

  Actually, I didn't quite understand Hawaii Five-O until I began watching reruns of the show on a local network run in the early 1980's. The first three seasons were possibly the best; things seemed much more relaxed; the Five-O team worked in shirt sleeves in many episodes, and there was a noticable light humor in the show not there in later seasons. Zulu, who played Kono, was not a consummate actor, but the Kono character had a certain presence in the show it lacked later on with Al Harrington and Herman Wedemeyer. Herman Wedemeyer certainly fits the bill about the acting being ""wooden"". I'm surprised he didn't break in half when he bent over.

  To me, the best three episodes of the Show were ""V For Vashon, Pt. 1 The Son"", Pt. 2 ""The Father"" and Pt. 3 ""The Grandfather"", which came much later in the show's run. Of course, I still enjoy any episode containing Wo Fat.

  Until I bought this set, I had NEVER seen the Pilot Episode.

That pilot, by the time I got through with it, was 97 minutes well spent, at least as far as pilot films go. All the other episodes (from ""Full Fathom Five"" all the way through ""The Big Kahuna"")  also held my complete and undivided interest all the way through. The color in this first season of ""Five-O"" is superb-- there aren't any dropouts, no pixelation, nada. It's just smooth sailing all the way through to the checkered flag. The menus (when I want to get to a specific outing) are easily navigable and are very well-designed to boot. The opening and closing themes of season 1 (matter-of-factly, of the series as a whole) stand as some of television's greatest music (this can be said of the pilot as well, and also the music within the stories). The opening and closing titles are some of television's greatest (the closing credits even included a longer version of the strobing police light from the opening). The season's 7 discs are superbly packaged as well. I even enjoyed seeing the 1996 documentary w/Emme Tomimbang and James MacArthur. Finally, the characters (from McGarrett through to Chin Ho and the weekly guest stars), the settings (the Iolani Palace and the entire state of Hawaii), and the stories (straight-up crime dramas of the late-'60's)-- all combine to make the first season's worth of ""Hawaii Five-O"" a must-buy.

I remember as a very young man that the shows were running on TV and that we loved the famous Theme song of this Tv show.

I was not even born when the show started but i have bought the DVD set and i am watching the shows.

Here i will summarize what i want to say...

Pros: extremely good dvd packaging, your dvd's will not get easily damage if you handle them properly, the packaging is not flimsy like most TV series are.

Image and sound are crystal clear and without any artifacts due to age.

CBS has done a great job with this series at least on this DVD set...

I love the cast and all, the shows ending are not really predictable like more cop tv shows or films are today.

There is always twist and turns that keep you guessing until the end. The Ending of the show is usually not sold in the first 2 minutes of the show which makes you wanna sit thru to the very end to know what happens.

Love the setting, it is not overly violent or gory.

It is intelligently written and brilliantly acted.

I like Steve MacGarret a lot. He does not take no for an answer and it's fun to watch him in the show.

Love Dan o' and Chin Ho and Kono too.

Worth every dollar i spent on it.

Highly recommended!!!!!

Cons: nothing....

Folks if you are looking for a good cop show, this is it, even if it is older than some of us it is still relevant to modern day policework and fun to watch!

To praise the first season is easy. These mini movies were complete and complex stories, not like some of the items on TV today.

The stories of the first season were good story telling. It also used one other character, its location..Hawaii. It was not a studio type of production, it was filmed in the 50th state fully. The cast did not dumb down the dialog nor the action and not the location. Note Hawaii may be the back drop, but it was not a sightseeing tour..meaning you saw Hawaii, but the audience was not made as a look at the sites. Hawaii's unique landscape is what made this interesting.

Jack Lord was no Columbo. He was hard as nails team leader. He showed strenghth and conviction is every action and his team backed him. He was nononsense but he also had a heart and you can see it

The first 28 were well due. Bless CBS video for not releasing half sets or best of. Just good Television to enjoy

3530842,5,B001DHXT4S,This is a GREAT set for any Hawaii 5-0 afficianado.  I purchased this as a gift for a colleague who is a big fan!  My father was one of the original cast members so my friend was thrilled to receive an autographed copy of the set!,1181260800,,230,3.9782608695652173
3530843,5,B001DHXT4S,"From 1969 to 1983 I had the delightful opportunity to grow up in Honolulu, even though my permanent home was in Wisconsin.  It was a magic place for me, and a great place to be a kid.  Sometimes we would see a street blockaded for filming Hawaii Five-O, and we'd strain our eyes to see if we could spot Jack Lord or a big black Five-O car.  Now I'm so appreciative that the show was made.  It so beautifully showcases an era of post-war Hawaii that just doesn't exist in the same way anymore, starting in the late 60's and lasting (incredibly) until the earliest 80's.  Admittedly, it's the setting that makes the show so special for me, but even if you have no particular interest in Hawaii, it is a very entertaining show full of endless retro moments.  See McGarret pat his secretary and send her off to make coffee.  Thrill to Steve's use of cutting edge lingo like ""cool, man"" and ""bad trip"".  Delight in Kono's wooden delivery of simple lines.  When I was a kid I assumed it only took one sharp kick to knock down any door; that's all it took for McGarret!  If your interested in police shows from this time period, I don't think you'll be disappointed with Hawaii Five-O.  Just don't expect it to be CSI.",1180915200,,1211,4.385650224215246
3530844,5,B001DHXT4S,"I watched this show religiously with my family when I was a child/teenager (I was 9 when the show premiered).  It's just as good today as it was then.  They don't make TV as good anymore.  I don't know if the producers restored the videos, but the color quality is just awesome.  The Hawaii scenery is magnificent.  The stories, while a bit dated, are still good.  McGarrett is the number one cop in my book.  I can see how Miami Vice was inspired by this show.  I can't wait until the season two DVD's come out in July.",1180656000,,520,4.23469387755102
3530845,5,B001DHXT4S,"OK!  I won't beat a dead horse--we all LOVE Hawaii Five-O!  So here's an actual review of this SET!  Technically well prepared, with generally high quality video and audio.  Only one episode (Twenty-Four Karat Kill)  showed some audio degradation.  I run my audio through my stereo and you can crank up the theme song loud enough to wake the neighbors and it still sounds crisp and clean (except that one episode which is kind of ""muddy"" sounding overall).  Episodes run a full 51 minutes each, not the 42 of todays shows!

The special feature EMME'S ISLAND MOMENTS--Memories of Hawaii Five-O has lots of interviews with cast members and others who worked on Hawaii Five-O.  It runs 42 minutes (appx) and you'll learn lots about the making of the show!

Well packaged in four ""slim-line"" plastic cases in a slip case box, which keep the discs well protected.  Not chintzy like some other multi-disc sets.

FUN things to look for during the episodes???  McGarrett's ""magical morphing Mercury"" that sometimes sprouts (or loses) a couple of doors enroute to crime scenes!  Watch for Herman Wedemeyer and Al Harrington (who in later seasons become regular members of the Five-O team) appearing as a criminal or different police officer!  See several different Che Fong's in the lab (Harry Endo doesn't appear as Che yet!).  Watch for Richard Denning (the Governer) doing double duty as a U.S. Treasury agent with a different name!  Plus check out the cool Pontiac ambulances from back when ambulances had STYLE, but not that much medical care!

Only thing missing (pay attention producers!) was those great ""THIS IS JACK LORD....BE THERE, ALOHA!"" previews for the next weeks episode.  I'm guessing they're ""lost to the ravages of time"", but if they still exist I'd be willing to bet we'd ALL want them included in the later seasons sets!

All in all, FIVE STARS FOR FIVE-O!  GREAT TV, well produced set, worthwhile extras.

3530846,5,B001DHXT4S,I missed 4 years of Hawaii 5-0 when I was in the Navy.  When I got out I enjoyed watching the show every Thursday night at 9 PM until it ended.  For a few years I was able to catch a couple of re runs of the show.  Having this DVD collection is wonderful.  It is nostalgic to watch when ever I wish.  I can't wait to buy the other years series as they become available.  The quality of the DVD's is very good.  Thank you for the opportunity to watch my all time favorite TV show.,1179446400,,479,3.8762886597938144

3530848,4,B001DHXT4S,"Hawaii Five-O was a TV hit in the 60's and it's great fun to revisit.  Police Dramas of this era were simple good guy vs. bad guy(s).  The end was never is doubt, but that didn't spoil the fun.  Well worth the price!",1179014400,,216,3.9767441860465116

3530854,4,B001DHXT4S,Great set of DVD's if you like Hawaii Five-0. Was able to find out Kono's last name. The initial pilot is interesting how Chin Ho was used. Nice extra episode from DanO and Emme that was done by Hawaiian Public TV as a review on how influential the series was on tourism for the state. Can't wait to start watching season 2.,1178928000,,324,4.241935483870968
3530855,5,B001DHXT4S,This DVD set is one of the best of the TV shows that I have purchased.  It's so good to watch a complete episode.  (What I've seen on the TV cable channels might as well be called a Reader's Digest Condensed version because it has been edited and chopped up so badly.) Each episode is approximately 50 minutes versus the 42 or so minutes of today's hour-long TV shows.  The visual and audio quality is excellent and so much better than what I see on TV.  If you are a Hawaii Five-0 fan this is the only way to enjoy the show.  I look forward to buying the next season.,1178668800,,568,4.127272727272727
3530856,5,B001DHXT4S,"One of the greatest of the late 70's/80's cop shows returns to DVD in all its glory.  Great location shooting, over-the-top performances and period guest stars make this one always entertaining.  The first season set is a little shy of extras, but don't let that stop you from reliving the wonderful world of Kono, Wo Fat and Big Chicken.",1178582400,,338,4.711864406779661
3530857,5,B001DHXT4S,"I have been waiting as many others for years for the release of this series.  Even when I contacted the TV stations airing the show, they didn't know when if at all Paramount would release it.  I then wrote a letter directly to them.  No reply, but I'd like to think it helped. Yes Law & Order and Gunsmoke have lasted longer than Hawaii Five-O, but this show has a lot to be proud of.  It is late 60's early '70s TV but it doesn't get old.  The topics and drama then are applicable now, it's presently however that we tolerate frank violence on TV. Five-O did it with ""class and style"" in part due to act-based segments and scored music. Much of it is a stretch from reality but the plots involving crime are mostly true and unfortunate human conditions of greed, revenge, drug use., etc. All you young folks out there give this one a try.
One last thing.  It remains unclear why Paramount waited 39 years to release the series to the public (a generation or so later!)It is the equivalent of releasing Law & Order in 2029--where will you be then?",1178150400,,1048,4.348717948717948
3530858,5,B001DHXT4S,"First off, ""Hawaii 5-0"" was like nothing that had preceded it!

Although the show was filmed in glorious color, showing Hawaiian locales at their most appealing, the story lines were truly shaded in black and white.  Unlike today's fare, one could distinguish between the good guys and the bad ones.

Chief among the former is Steve McGarrett, played with a hard-hitting, take-no-prisoners swagger by the great Jack Lord.  The fact that Lord never won an Emmy for his fine performance is another one of the industry's injustices.

In the first season, we learn that McGarrett is a former Naval officer, leading an elite team of investigators in the fictional police unit known as ""Hawaii 5-0.""  So influential was the show during its twelve-year run, many a visitor to the state actually thought that such an enforcement agency existed.

This is a testament to the brilliant cast (including James McArthur, Kam Fong, Zulu, and Richard Denning as ""The Governor""), expert writing, exciting guest stars, eye-catching camerawork, exotic locations, and the best durn theme song ever created for television.

The first season of the show didn't just delve into typical cop fare.  Stories dealt with quack doctors, the controversial Viet Nam war, the social revolution and the hippie movement, along with international espionage.

As far as the latter is concerned, the pilot episode (included on this compilation) introduces McGarrett's chief nemesis, the sinister Chinese agent ""Wo Fat,"" memorably played by Khigh Dhiegh.  The actor would appear frequently throughout the show's tenure.

Guest stars included such familiar faces as singer Tommy Sands, Andrew Duggan, Sally Kellerman, Sal Mineo, Harold J. Stone,  Leslie Nielsen, Farley Granger, Jeanette Nolan, Gavin MacLeod, Nancy Malone, Nancy Kovack, and Kevin McCarthy.  Emmy-worthy turns are also delivered by Yaphet Kotto as a tortured war veteran (""King of the Hill""), Ron Feinberg as a mentally-challenged murderer (""Pray Love Remember, Pray Love Remember"") and Joanne Linville as a fraudulent doctor in the two-parter ""Once Upon a Time.""

As was common during the era, Caucasian actors were allowed to play ""ethnic"" roles, thus one can forgive the casting of the aforementioned Feinberg, Simon Oakland, David Opatoshu, and John Marley, respectively, as native Hawaiians.  Even Hispanic actor Ricardo Montalban gets to don slanted eyes as a Japanese crime lord.

Hey, it was the 60's and ""political correctness"" was not quite in the vernacular.

The quality of the compilation is superb, with sound and picture of the highest.  Each disc is easily navigable, allowing the viewer to play all episodes back to back or shift to each individually.  The bonus feature, an eleven-year-old documentary, is very informative, suitably paying homage to star Lord and creator Leonard Freeman.

It is obvious that the producers of the set respect the fond memories of the show and the fans that will flock to purchase each season.",1177632000,,2971,5.292110874200427
3530859,5,B001DHXT4S,"I don't know why, but I didn't like this show as a kid.  Now, I love it.  It's a great show to watch with the family. It's wonderful to see cop cars with real lights and real sirens, manual typewriters, and dial telephones.  The sound effects do crack us up - no car ever pulls up to or away from the curb without screeching the tires.  The stories are really the best part.  They click along, are interesting, and there is no question about who the good guys and who the bad guys are.

ofs",1177459200,,490,4.105263157894737
3530860,5,B001DHXT4S,"Sure this DVD set has great nostalgia value for anyone who grew up in the 60s and early 70s, but it's also just plain great entertainment. With the great actors, characters and writing that made up the Hawaii Five-0 series, there was no need to rely on ""shock"" or ""viewer discretion"" warnings like a lot of today's overwrought television dramas.

Nobody played the ""tough cop"" better than Jack Lord and Steve McGarrett was the consummate tough cop character. It's great watching him order around Danny, Kono and Chin, who invariably dig up important information on the case, but ultimately it's McGarrett who figures it all out.

A lot of reviewers have already commented on the great opening theme song (this is definitely one TV DVD where you will NOT skip the intro), but the closing credits are just as compelling with the closeup of the blue flashing light on top of the police car as it speeds through a Honolulu street at night. Great stuff. Highly recommended!",1177113600,,968,4.790419161676646
3530861,4,B001DHXT4S,"Watching this show as a child, i was very excited to see this show finally come on dvd.  The episodes are very entertaining, but some are very topical.  This is no big deal though.  It is always nice to see how things were treated or portrayed in a different era.  ""King of the Hill,"" ""The Box,"" and ""Yesterday Died and Tomorrow Won't Be Born"" are among my favorite episodes from the first season. I am left wondering why the 5 - 8 second opening with the picture of the ocean and the show title looping to the front of the screen was left out.  This was on most of the first season episodes with the exception of ""Twenty Four Karat Kill,"" which actually had the familiar tidal wave intro with different music.  Please have more updated extras.  Maybe have an extra feature on ""Previews from the next episode,"" where Jack Lord says at the end of the preview, ""Be There Aloha.""

3530863,5,B001DHXT4S,"I enjoyed Hawaii Five-O  as a schoolboy decades ago on a black and white TV, and it is a real pleasure to see it in a crisp clear colour version on DVD. One thing that made this series so good (as I now see) was that, apart from being set in 'Paradise', as its worthy successor Magnum P.I. would be, there was no set formula for the stories; the variety is constantly surprising. The two-part story of how McGarrett deals with a person claiming to cure cancer by an electronic gadget is one I remember from childhood.
The series (and DVD) have been so well made that it's easy to forget that what we see on screen was filmed over three decades ago. I suppose 'Paradise' never ages or gets dull. Highly recommended.",1176595200,,714,4.368421052631579

3530879,5,B001DHXT4S,"This first season of Hawaii Five-0 features the original lineup of McGarrett, Danno, Kono, and Chin Ho - in my opinion the best lineup.

The digital clean up and transfer of the episodes to DVD is crystal clear and outstanding!

Stand out episodes are Cocoon (The pilot), ...And They Painted Daises On His Coffin, Samurai, Face Of The Dragon, Deathwatch, Yesterday Died And Tomorrow Won't Be Born, King of the Hill, and The Box.

The pilot movie ""Cocoon"" is in it's original movie version and probably hasn't been shown this way since 1968; however, there is one scene that is missing. This missing scene is when McGarrett has been in the cocoon for 6 hours 30 minutes. He yells at Wo Fat through the air tubes, ""Soundproof cocoon, boloney! You've goofed Mr. Wo Fat! You hear me? You've goofed Fatso!"" Then Miller claims McGarrett is hallucinating. Wo Fat replies that McGarrett can indeed hear, and these sounds McGarrett hears are sounds few men have ever heard - the sounds are from being in the deprevation chamber for so long. ""We have something very special this time in our little goldfish bowl"" says Wo Fat at the end of this scene. However, it may be best this scene was left out. This particular sequence of ""Cocoon"" is supposed to show how cool McGarrett can be under pressure. It sort of seems out of place when he blows his cool and yells at Fatso (Wo Fat).

All of the other scenes that were cut out in syndication appear to be intact. No more confusing dialogue!

I hadn't seen an episode in many years - and I was a baby when it first aired. But I remembered the re-runs.  Watching Season One, I was not only reminded what a fantastic drama this was, but am surprised at how compelling it still is and how the writing and story lines are just as relevant today as they were 40 years ago.

I was also struck by the diversity in the casting, both in the regular and guest casts (though Ricardo Montelban playing an Asian was a bit of a stretch...especially with that smooth Latin accent).

3530889,5,B001DHXT4S,Jack Lord was always under-rated as an actor. Don't miss the chance to catch up with 5-0 as they battle crime in the 50th State.  Well done transfer to Disc also includes a nice documentary hosted by James MacArthur.  There was a wide variety of stories presented just during the first year. Very entertaining show still has holds up today. We can hope that sales are good enough to continue releases of later seasons. Highly recommended,1175385600,,437,4.7368421052631575
3530890,5,B001DHXT4S,"Hello there,

First and foremost, thank you for releasing this video for all the Hawaii 50 fans! And don't stop, I will buy all 12 seasons guaranteed!

Now for the show:

This show is a landmark, a work of art really.

The directing, superb cast, beautiful shots of Hawaii, original and very distinctive musical score, really turned what should have been a simple TV cop show on remote islands into an international multi-cultural phenomenon. This show is part of the ""Holly Grail"" of American TV!

There is a high chance I will visit Hawaii one of these days, and I have Hawaii 50 to thank for.

I watch at least one episode a day; this is no longer just a show for me, it's a religion!

Aloha,

3530891,5,B001DHXT4S,"Nothing lasts 12 years without having something going for it. In the case of Hawaii Five-O, it easy to dismiss it as a typically television crime drama that got lucky by finding its audience and keeping it. The same could be said for Law and Order. Except, in television years, luck usually runs out after two or three years. Gimmicks get old, the formula is figured out, and sharks are jumped so often they don't even complain.

But shows that last five years, much less 12, have to have something besides luck, gimmicks, and great scheduling. Hawaii Five-O had a number of things going for it. First of all, let's be honest. The setting was, and still is so lush and exotic that it is easily intoxicating. Hawaii is beautiful, and most people either live there or want to live there. Filming on location has always been a blessing when it's been done, and probably no more so than on this series.

Next, Jack Lord, playing Five-O chief Steve McGarrett, was one of a long line of no-nonsense law enforcement figures. The strength, integrity, and dedication of these kinds of characters cannot be overstated, and these characters will always have lots of fans rooting them on, not unlike Law and Order's Jack McCoy.

Finally, watching shows like this is always a treat because you see so many stars that were either big stars enjoying a working Hawaiian vacation, or lots of up and coming stars before they got their big break. Hawaii Five-O was a natural draw for both categories, and it's fun to watch them and remember when.

It's also fun to remember when you could look forward to hearing one of the best and most recognizable theme songs in television history. Not a small thing when you add it with the other factors. Hawaii Five-O had a lot going for it then, and it has a lot going for it now.",1175126400,,1802,4.569659442724459
3530892,5,B001DHXT4S,"What out for McGarrett's squealing tires! He's back in action! The saying ""book em' Danno"" may be what most people remember,  but I remember the squealing tires in every episode!

I started watching this series when I was a kid, but I was hooked. The tropical scenery, the cool 60's jargon, and those garish 1960's styles! How could I ever forget? This is one of the few cult shows that I've always watched if it showed up in reruns.

I have really enjoyed watching this series again. Sometimes by today's standards of television shows, it's pretty cheesey, however, what makes this show so compelling besides the scenery is the characters. McGarrett, head of the state police, takes every case personally and is very hands-on, to the point of obsession. But, he is a formidable character who NEVER backs down and always survives and ends up on top. I think this is what draws me into to this show. The good guy wins!

I also like his supporting cast. The big teddy bear Hawaiian ""Kono,"" who is always cool under fire. Danno, the second in command, is there because he's the token cute blonde, but that's okay with me. Chin Ho, the stable family man is smart and has ""connections"" all over the Islands. Together, these guys help the big kahuna solve the toughest crimes in Hawaii. What a team.

If you are a true Hawaii Five-O fan, you need this series. They don't show up on reruns anymore and even if they do, there are too many commercials. It's awesome to time travel back into Hawaii of the 60s/70s again. And it's great to see McGarrett back in charge.

I enjoy watching a show where you can cheer for the good guys.

The only item that may be missing is at the end of the show when Jack Lord gives us a preview of next week's episode.  I'm not sure if the previews were done the first season or not when the series was on network television.

3530904,5,B001DHXT4S,"I was very pleased with the treatment this show has finally been given on DVD and recommend it highly to all fans.  The picture quality is good though some shots are grainy and even out of focus. I imagine some of these are just foul-ups we have to live with due to the fact there were a lot of inexperienced people behind the scenes. In an ironic touch, with the improved sound, the background music that kicks in at crucial moments is sometimes annoying and just plain corny(in the episode ""And they painted daisies....,"" where Dano is accused of murdering an 18 year old kid, the strings that kick each time things get bad for him are almost laughable). Yet when that wave starts rolling and the theme music kicks in, it is still as dramatic as ever.

Okay, so the stories are dated and over the top but what still comes through is the man himself - McGarrett. In going thru these episodes it really hits home that Jack Lord was this show. His presence on the small screen is right up there with the presence a DeNiro or Nicholson bring to the big screen. I once had a police office as a neighbor and he used to laugh at the show because in every episode McGarrett would either violate the constitution  or end up with such flimsy of evidence that, in real life, no arrest of his would ever hold up in court!  Ah but who cares, it is still fun even after all these years.

The one main ""extra"" is the inclusion of a 1996 television special paying homage to the show, co-hosted by James MacArthur. Of course, many of the cast members are no longer with us but it is still a fun history lesson to view.  Sadly, Jack Lord was too ill with Alzheimer's disease to take part but his presence is felt vividly in the way the cast recalls him. I mean the guy sounded like an egotistical jerk but at the same time, the show succeeded because of him.

As of this review, the price of the DVD set is $33.99 and I can say I am not sure what else can provide me with so much enjoyment and fond memories for the same money.",1174262400,,2011,4.2486910994764395

3530906,5,B001DHXT4S,"Hawaii Five-0 is the name of a special police task force under the command of Det. Steve McGarrett and he answers directly to the governor of Hawaii. Even though Five-O is a separate agency, they do work together from time to time with the Honolulu Police Department when they're in need of resources or extra man power. Under McGarretts leadership Five-0 investigates everything from murder and kidnapping to terrorism and international espionage. Dan Williams is McGarretts right hand man and second in command. Chin Ho Kelly and Kono, round out the team.

Whether it's the memorable theme song; the catch phrase ""Book'em Danno-Murder One"" or the lavish Island scenes, season one of ""Hawaii Five-O"" is a welcomed addition to any DVD collection. This amazing 7 disc set contains the original series pilot ""Cocoon"" and the remaining 24 season one episodes digitally re-mastered in spectacular color. This set consists of seven discs stored in 4 slim cases. Paramount / CBS studios went the distance with the disc packaging and artwork. Other than some minor speckling here and there, the episodes look amazing. The video transfer is crisp and the colors are sharp and vibrant. The episodes are presented in full screen format with mono sound. The sound is clean and crisp, but it's too bad that Paramount didn't re-master the sound like they did with ""Mission Impossible"" season one.

I had never seen the original pilot episode ""Cocoon"" until I purchased this set, so it was definitely a treat for me to watch and well worth the purchase of this set. Season one of ""Hawaii Five-O"" with its great writing, memorable characters, theme music and great dialogue is 60's television at its finest. This show was ground-breaking entertainment and it set the standard for other police shows to follow. They don't make shows like this anymore and probably never will again. The only bonus features included are found on the last disc. I thought the bonus material was fun to watch and informative. I look forward to season two of ""Hawaii Five-O"" and hope that Paramount continues with the same DVD quality as season one. Thanks Paramount!

3530908,5,B001DHXT4S,"Finally, one of my all time favorite television shows makes it to DVD.  While I was a kid throughout the seventies, I recall Hawaii Five-0 as a constant staple in television entertainment.  As I grew older, I always looked forward to Five-0 reruns and came to really enjoy the character of Steve McGarrett.  To this day, McGarrett remains my favorite TV cop (my favorite movie cop being Steve McQueen as Bullitt).

Whether it was the scriptwriters or Jack Lord, the portrayal McGarrett's character, while gruff and authoritative, demonstrated a fair treatment of the people he encountered.  McGarrett saw good in people and, despite his overt conventionality, seemed to have a soft spot and sympathy for a variety of citizens, such as counter culture hippies who seemed truly dedicated to their principals; quite a statement to those who view McGarrett as wooden and above the law.  If anything, he was devoted to the protection of all people.

Anyhow, I am glad to have Hawaii Five-0 back at ready to watch anytime I want it.  Let's hope season two will follow soon.",1174089600,,1067,4.888888888888889

The special feature is really wonderful--one of the best things about it is that the people who shared their memories of the show didn't sugarcoat anything.  They obviously loved Jack Lord, but they are telling it like it is.  James MacArthur is also very forthright about why he left.  There's no E True Hollywood Story feeling to this special from the 1990s, thank goodness!  It really helps you see what the show meant to the islands and to the people involved.

The transfer is fantastic for such an old show--it looks really, really good.  The theme music and opening credits are just classics.  Some of the reviewers write about wooden acting in this show--but if that's true, they must be referring to later seasons, because everyone is on their A game in season one--Lord, MacArthur, and the rest do a great job here.",1173571200,,1055,4.690217391304348
3530916,5,B001DHXT4S,"Like many, I'm so happy to have the Hawaii Five-O DVDs in hand.  Our family watches a few episodes all at once.  We don't tire of the predictability.  And we certainly enjoy the music.  That theme song has got to go down as one of the best songs ever recorded.

I can understand people thinking the show was trite and stiff and badly written.  But I'm sure those statements are made in comparison to TV shows of today.  Totally unfair comparison.  We're talking about a ground-breaking crime show from 40 years ago.  Hawaii Five-O can't be compared to a CSI, Law & Order or anything that's on today.  In fact, I would venture to say that those crime dramas should thank H50 for laying the foundation.

One of the things I don't think many people are realizing with Hawaii Five-0: it's something the entire family can get into.  It was like that back in 1968.  And it's that way today.  You can't say that for many crime shows that air today.  Would you let your kids watch The Sopranos?  NYPD Blue?  I would hope not.

I grew up in Hawaii and am fortunate to call Hawaii home.  When I was a kid, it was cool to catch Hawaii Five-0 filming.  We do the same with ""Lost"" today.  I can say from personal experience that Jack Lord was a gracious TV star.  He loved Hawaii.  He lived just 10 minutes away from my house.  We shopped at the same grocery store.  On one occasion I saw him shopping at Times Supermarket in Kahala.  He had on his trademark white, wide-brimmed hat, white slacks and Aloha shirt.  I got up enough courage to ask him for his autograph.  He stopped his shopping, looked down at this 12 year old kid and asked, ""what's your name?""  With a big smile he signed a piece of paper I had with me.  I carry that memory with me till today, 30+ years later.

At long last, the TV show that set the bar for Hawaii television production.  The show that built our film industry.  The show that solidified our tourism market for the last 40 years.  It's now on DVD.  Yes!",1173571200,,1976,4.306010928961749
3530917,5,B001DHXT4S,"Well, finally!! I was not even born when Hawaii five o debuted and was only 1 year old when the season finale went out in 1980! I've come accustomed to this show through re-runs that have been shown on UK television.

Hawaii five o was and is essential tv viewing, from the beautiful locations to the cracking storylines.

The one and only gripe I have about the show is that although it is one of the longest running detective tv shows in history, it was possibly too long, most fans will agree that from perhaps the last few seasons the show had run out of steam, plots were thin and Jack Lord was getting too old. However that doesn't matter overall as collectivley, this was a great show! So please don't let that put you off as 85% of the series was fantastic!

 There have been a lot of the 'older' tv shows released on dvd by studios but they  have not got the kind of respect they deserve (e.g re-remastering and special features), but I must say, hats off to paramount, they have released a fantastic set, each episode has been remastered and looks great for a show nearly 40 years old. And have even included a special feature on disc 7, so (and I don't say this very often, as most studios are clueless when its comes to releasing a dvd set that both the fans and show deserve!) paramount have exceeded themselves, so thanks and keep this up when producing further seasons. Which reminds me, from what I can gather the dvd set itself is sold out hawaii, and many internet sites are sold out and have them on backorder. Its sounds daft, but this is good news as it proves the set is selling well which will almost surely guarentee a second season release and hopefully if sales continue to be strong the whole series on dvd eventually.

So those who do not have the set, even if you haven't seen it before and like a good cop show, get it ordered now!",1173484800,,1861,4.348703170028818

After watching my almost 20 year old VHS tapes made from tv I can say these dvd's blow me away with the clean crisp prints and excellent sound.  This show was groundbreaking in that it was shot comepletely on location in Hawaii, something that was very expensive to do, and who can ever forget that theme music.

Season 1 has several great episodes and the pilot episode a 96 minute one called ""Cocoon"" is very chilling.  Some of the standout episodes from this season are the pilot one, And They Painted Daisies On His Coffin, By The Numbers, Yesterday Died and Tomorrow Won't Be Born, King Of The Hill, and The Box.  Two of these have Gavin McLeod playing the role of drug kingpin ""Big Chicken"" and he does it very well.

The only extra is a nice one.  It is a special from 1996 filmed in Hawaii with James MacArthur as co-host.  Sadly most of the stars of H5O have passed on since this was taped but it is a very interesting and informative special with a nice tribute to Jack Lord.  My biggest wish is that James MacArthur had done some commentary for a few episodes, mostly King Of The Hill and And They Painted Daisies On His Coffin, as these were very piviotal episodes based on his character Danno.

If you are a fan of this show (or 1960's cop shows in general) be sure to pick it up you will not be dissapointed.  Hopefully we won't have to wait twelve years to have all twelve seasons on dvd.

The mastering and sound seems better than new on this set, cool artwork one sided discs, extras, and the way cool two hour pilot called -Cocoon and contains the villain of the WO-FAT charactor played to perfection by Khigh Dhiegh who would return in later episodes  , also another actor named Tim O' Kelley plays Danno, and nice performances from actors Leslie Nielson.

3530924,5,B001DHXT4S,"One of the greatest and longest-running shows of all time, Hawaii Five-0 has been long-ignored by TV-DVD makers for years, forcing fans to wear out their videotape copies of the grainy, washed-out, cut-for-syndication episodes that have aired continuously around the world since the show left network TV in 1980.  Fortunately, the folks at CBS-Paramount decided the time had come to make this show available to DVD fans, and they have knocked this one out of the park!

The episodes in this set look fantastic in all their digitally-remastered and uncut glory. These shows have never appeared so clear and vibrant, with nary a speck of dirt or grit appearing on the prints. The only episode that appears to not have gotten the remastering treatment is ""Six Kilos"", which still looks better than it ever has in syndication (where it was curiously hard to find in rotation).  The episodes, with a great range of guest stars including Leslie Nielsen, Gavin MacLeod (as a vicious drug dealer), Yaphet Kotto and Ricardo Montalban, appear every bit as modern and relevant as any current network television show airing today, despite the fact that it is almost 40 years old. The packaging and menus also get high marks, some of the best I've ever seen among older shows on DVD. This set was clearly put together by a group of people at Paramount who have genuine love for the show.

In the meantime, I just finished viewing the Emme's Island Memories documentary on disc 7, and it was wonderful that they were able to get so many of the cast and crew on camera recounting their memories of the show. It's especially touching knowing that so many of them have passed away since, and that their thoughts on the show will be preserved for all to enjoy for many years to come. I defy any true fan of the show not to get a lump in their throat when they get to the Jack Lord tribute in the show.

This is a set that deserves a place in anyone's home who is a fan of great TV cop shows, or just quality programs in general.  Based on the Amazon rankings and sell-out status in stores, here's hoping Season 2 is not far away!",1173225600,,2111,4.571428571428571

Now I can watch one of my long-time favorite shows in perfect clarity, color and great sound quality.  If you loved this show like I did, you won't go wrong buying this series.

But I had forgotten how GREAT this show was! And I mean right from the opening segment of the pilot, ""Cocoon,"" which features one of the most startling moments I've seen on TV, ever. And then the lead-in to that classic theme song. It was all there from the very first second. Jack Lord was perfectly McGarrett from the first moment, sort of like Joe Friday with a sense of humor. A SMALL sense of humor, but still. The only thing missing in the pilot was James MacArthur as Danno, but that was quickly rectified with the first proper show, aired a week after the pilot.

This show is incredibly exciting, the dialogue is crackling and not hokey like I was afraid it would be after all this time, the police-procedural element is realistic, the scenery is wonderful and there's plenty of it for Jack Lord to chew on. The clothes and cars and type of villians (Commies, hippies, Japanese mafia, even Gavin MacLeod as a pimp) may have dated a bit, but for me that makes it all the more fun, it's a great window into American history, and you don't even need a textbook! ""Hawaii Five-O"" is still one of the great television shows, well worth owning and watching over and over.

I echo the praise others have given to CBS/Paramount for starting to release this show on DVD, BUT, I have one complaint.  A HUGE disappointment.  Apparently, Paramount did not include the Jack Lord narrated preview(s) for the next episode which originally aired at the end of each show.  ""This is Jack Lord inviting you to join us next for (fill in episode title)"", and, at the conclusion of the preview, ""(episode title); Be there...Aloha!""  This was/is as iconic as the show itself, and I'd be very interested to know why it was excluded from the set!  The release of the original Star Trek series has every one of the ""next episode"" previews intact...why not the same for Hawaii Five-O?  I've randomly watched only one episode so far, on the third disc, and saw this glaring omission.  I haven't checked out the rest of the set, but I assume if the preview wasn't included on one episode, it isn't there for any of the others.  Why was this done?  I only hope subsequent season releases correct this.  It really detracts from the overall package, and qualifies it as an incomplete release in my mind.",1173225600,,1234,4.6192660550458715

3530929,5,B001DHXT4S,"I loved this show as a kid in the 70s, and still do when I've seen the reruns. Beyond the theme song, actors and plots, Five-O did some groundbreaking things, like quick scene cuts, that were later used in shows like ""Miami Vice"" and are very common today.

Another way a show has a great impact is when catch-phrases and tag lines from the episodes creep into the vernacular, such as ""Book 'em Danno"" from Five-O and ""Beam me up"" from the original Star Trek series. Five-O successfully manufactured a lot of these back in it's day.

Any show that lasts as long as this one did is going to have a few uneven moments or rocky episodes/seasons. Five-O is no different, but I'm going to enjoy this release and watch McGarrett take on Wo-Fat and other baddies again as the season releases proceed. A must-have for any cop-show fan.",1172966400,,827,4.506666666666667
3530930,4,B001DHXT4S,"Jack Lord's classic series finally arrives on DVD. It looks great! Colors are bright and vibrant and we actually get a solid extra. ""Hawaii Five-O"" ran from 1968 to 1980 and was a fixture on CBS' schedule pulling in solid ratings throughout that time. Lord played former Navy officer Steve McGarrett who dealt with all manner of scum in the 50th State. As someone else pointed out, this is the granddaddy of the modern procedural show (along with some of Jack Webb's series)and, no doubt, inspired such shows as the ""CSI"" franchise.

This set has the original uncut 90+ minute pilot (which was cut into two episodes during syndication)as well as the entire uncut first season of the series. We also get ""Emme's Island Moments: Memories of ""Hawaii Five-O"" a locally but professionally produced behind-the-scenes glimpse into the making of the show which features interviews with cast and crew members.

3530932,5,B001DHXT4S,"At long last one of the ""holy grails"" of televison series is going to be released on DVD! All things considered this is the probably best cop show ever produced as far as pure entertainment value goes. It had everything you look for in a classic TV series . . .great scenery, great music, solid plots, and pretty decent acting by both the cast and the many wonderful guest stars.

I watched the show when they were first broadcast on CBS and made sure that I had a small portable TV on my desk at work so I could catch the reruns when they were shown locally every weekday afternoon at 4:00 back in the 80's.

The Steve McGarrett character was a little wooden perhaps but in the end he was the coolest cop in TV history. For him there was never any questioning between right and wrong . . .good and evil. He always did things by the book no matter what. And how satisfing was it to see those smug bad guys always get theres in the end?

For what ultimately was a formula cop show you will find that there were many excellent and memorable storylines over it's 11 season run. Five-O was also a very cleverly structured program with it's opening teaser segment, boom-into the pounding theme music, the plot, the big ending and then Jack Lord's preview of next week's episode (""Next on Hawaii Five-O . . . .be there aloha""). It was the only show that we actually sat through the commericals at the end of the program to see what waa on next week!

It was also responsible for bringing millions upon millions of tourists to visit Hawaii from around the world after viewing the spectacular scenery on the show (including myself who would visit there 13 times). To this end the people of the state are pretty grateful to the producers.

I have all the episodes on VHS and look forward to picking them up at long last on DVD. In the end the show may look a little bit dated here in the 21st century but; the spectacular scenery, the cool music (which is as listenable today as it was 35 years ago), the exciting/fast paced scripts, memorable (and admirable)characters and utlimately the concept of good overcoming evil will never get old.

And just think, before dvr recording I did all that with a vcr. All for my love of my favorite tv show. Was it worth it? You bet. Jack Lord as Steve McGarrett has got to be the coolest guy on tv ever. You could respect his character, honesty, hard work, and steadfast determination to keep the honest folk safe. As a kid when the series aired it was easy for me to stay on the right side of the law when I had so much respect for that character. I admired him then and still do today. watching the series now takes me back to that slightly more innocent time we once lived in especially with all the ""hippie"" era music and lingo.

Hawaii Five-0 is easily one of the best TV shows of the late 60's-early 70's era, along with Mission:Impossible and Star Trek.  This show is awesome.  If you want to watch the cops outsmart the bad guys nine times out of ten and consistently kick some [...] in front of gorgeous scenery and cool music, then you'll enjoy this.

It wasn't complicated and didn't require you to analyze or ponder anything; it was just good old-fashioned t.v.

I watched dozens of televsion series while growing up in the 60's and 70's. Today, there are only five I can recall the theme song to, without watching reruns or home video. Those are Bonanza, The Andy Griffith Show, Star Trek, All in the Family, and Hawaii Five-O. I'll wager most of you can do the same. That should speak volumes as to the quality of all these series.

You might think that's just because they had the catchiest tunes. However, we would not have memorized those tunes if we hadn't been watching the series every week!

My order is in - enough said!",1169251200,,662,4.5
3530941,4,B001DHXT4S,"With one of the most recognizable theme songs in television history, Hawaii Five-O literally burst onto the television screen with its rapid fire montage of opening credits and a brisk pace to its action that was unusual at the time.  It served as a counter punch to the lazy images of Hawaiians basking in the sun, by revealing a complex world of crime that swirled around Honolulu like a cyclone.  It was up to Steve McGarrett and his boys to rid the island of these unwanted elements, with Wo Fat being his most memorable nemesis.  The show may not have been the first to showcase local talent, but it had a strong cast made up of Americans and Asians that presaged the multi-ethnic crime dramas of the late 70s and 80s.  It goes without saying that it was the inspiration for Miami Vice, but this was no pastel color version of Honolulu.  You can forget Don Ho singing Tiny Bubbles.  McGarret looked more like a hardnosed FBI agent than he did the chief detective, running his crew like drill sergeant.  James MacArthur may have seemed a little soft but he provided the necessary relief to Lord's hardboiled command.  Kam Fong played the memorable Chin Ho through most of the series, which lasted 12 years.  An incredible run!",1168819200,,1230,4.631336405529954

For a short time the Hallmark Channel showed it on Sundays but often preempted it for Columbo. This is the single best program ever produced for TV. It was a terrific police drama and made me and my wife take several trips to Hawaii. It is just too bad Jack Lord didn't live long enough to benefit by its certain success. I always dreamt of a collaberation between the casts of Hawaii Five-O and Magnum PI. I could just see Steve dealing with Thomas.

The way to tell if it's uncut is the scene in which McGarrett is searching an apartment and an assassin is waiting for him. When he sees the killer's reflection in a shiny knob he whirls and shoots him three times (in the original pilot movie). In the cut version the last two shots have been deleted and he only shoots once.

The First Season is perhaps my favorite, it seemed gritter and had a more daring edge to it, as the characters, Jack Lord included, were finding their niche in their roles.  The scenes shot on location were breathtaking, that alone worth the price of admission!

3530945,5,B001DHXT4S,"The 1st Season is set to be released just about spring cleaning time. What a great break from putting back the screens and sorting the attic. But this DVD version promises to be more than a diversion, as was the original TV series. For those of you who are too young to have watched it, Hawaii Five-0 remains the longest running cop show (1968-80)--and for good reason. It combined crisp script-writing that followed ""The Formula"" with some of the first on-locale shooting, superb production elements from Leonard Freeman and his seasoned crew, and the consistent professionalism of its star, Jack Lord. As noted elsewhere here, the opening sequence (a montage of Polynesian enticement intermingled with modern Honolulu, to the tune of The Ventura's big instrumental hit) itself is a stirring sequence and indeed won an Emmy for its editing.

To be sure, the acting is at times wooden, stiff to the point of making caricatures of the actors, but as the series developed, so too did the characters, endearing themselves to loyal viewers. Much has been made of the scenery, or rather the local setting, and how it enhanced the plot line. (The DVD format will no doubt bring a richer texture and sharper definition to the setting which the VHS format could never do). And it is worth noting that Freeman insisted on filming this on-location in Hawaii, an initially costly calculation that introduced the Aloha State to countless millions of viewers, and literally loaded the state coffers with tourist dollars.

Still uncertain as to whether to buy? Then consider the fact that Hawaii Five-0 has been in syndication for decades and shows no signs of waning interest. The number of fan websites devoted to the series is testament enough. In Germany and elsewhere, it has an almost cult following rivaling the Bond films and in Paradise itself it is almost a rite of passage for many locals. Sure, much has been made of how the locals were used in this TV series but considering when it ran it was far ahead of its time. The series also gave a start to many local acting careers and its cast frequently sponsored or otherwise underwrote many local dramatic productions. A genuine man of principles like the character he portrayed--he was quietly active in local philanthropy--Jack Lord himself loved the islands and its people, which actually reveals itself with poignancy in some of scenes.

The show was not afraid to confront issues of the day head-on. Of course many of those concerns might seem trite from today's vantage point but others remain pressing: a soldier returning from war (in this case Vietnam), another soldier unable to shake the bitterness of another war (with Japan), environmental protectionism, the usurpation of Hawaiian culture and the destructive power of youth drug culture, and crime in general.

I look forward to reliving a portion of my adolescence when viewing this DVD. It will also be refreshing to hear dialogue that in unabashedly candid if at times a little corny and stilted, and written without the need to circumvent the censor. For despite being a cop show, it is unrated and therefore appropriate for older children to watch. It has little in the way of gratuitious or graphic violence and the language isn't a torrent of expletives. Sure, there was never a special state police force, but it bears mentioning that HPD headquarters actually includes a small museum as a lasting tribute to the show.

Now, if you happen to know the show well, you don't need my exhortations. And you won't think me odd to admit that on occasion when I stroll past Iolani Palace or the Ilikai Hotel, I make an upward glance, to see if McGarrett is looking through the blinds or leaning over the balcony rail with that trademark grin of his.",1166918400,,3759,4.8671875

From the scenes of Diamondhead and Honolulu to the views of beautiful island girls to the dramatic zoom to a closeup of Jack Lord standing atop the Ilikai Hotel, the credits sequence always got the show off to a rousing start a la the gunbarrel openings in the James Bond films.

However, it is awesome seeing these first season episodes uncut and remastered. Talk about pristine; the colors and picture quality are jaw droppingly good. This may sound silly, but one aspect of the first season I always enjoyed was the Five-O squad in their offices without their suit jackets on. It made the characters seem more real, if that makes any sense. McGarrett was especially cool in these office scenes because he had the shoulder holster. I was never struck by the characters' wardrobe until I viewed later seasons, possibly from the fourth season on, where the characters were dressed in their full ensembles, even when sitting at their desks! It just looked uncomfortable.

Anyway...

My favorite first season episodes include: ""Cocoon"" (the 2 hour pilot), ""Full Fathom Five,"" ""And They Painted Daises on His Coffin,"" ""Tiger By the Tail,"" ""Yesterday Died and Tomorrow Won't Be Born"" and ""The Box"" . This DVD  also has  ""Six Kilos"" which was rarely shown in syndication.

8293425,5,B001DHXT4S,"Although the original series can be criticized ,I still prefer the original to the now modern version, with actors of small stature they look wrong as compared to  the previous Jack Lord & Danno.",1521763200,,195,4.735294117647059
8293426,4,B001DHXT4S,"Full set of 7 discs as promised and also packaged well. However, they appear to be lightly used, as I have spotted a few small scratches. The cover they came in also appears to be lightly worn/softened in the corners. I am not unhappy with my purchase, I just thought that for the price I paid I would receive brand new discs. Other than that, amazing!",1512604800,,352,4.348484848484849

8293430,5,B001DHXT4S,"What is not to love about classic H5O. I use to live in Honolulu so it is kind of cool to see what it looked like in 1969. Jack Lord is classic and some of of the one liners are hilarious. I averaged it out and anywhere from 3-5 people get killed per episode; McGarret is responsible for good percentage of those. Great show, if it doesn't come back to Netflix, I will probably buy a few more seasons.",1503705600,,401,4.0886075949367084
