8064796,2,B0009PLLKY,"The stories are good and for the most part not annoying. (Some kids' videos are very annoying; these aren't.) My complaint is after the Bob part, there are commercials and cartoon shorts from other shows that are horribly annoying and long, and my son hates them as much as I do. It takes for.ev.er to fast forward through them. You can select to watch by chapters on one of them, but the menu to get through that is annoying, too. The other one does Not have that option. The commercials come on automatically. It's very, very annoying. My son doesn't want to watch stupid cartoon shorts about girl mice, and I don't want him to be advertised to for toys and other shows.",1458518400,,672,4.471544715447155

8064800,5,B0009PLLKY,"Yep, Amazon brought big smiles to my darling grandson's face
when Bob thr Builder arrived.  It's his favorite version of ""Bob""
and he watches it again and again.  I ordered it from Amazon.com because
past experience has shown me that my orders always arrive on time and
in the great condition that I have come to expect from them.
Thank you for always being dependable.",1297036800,,369,4.661538461538462
8064801,5,B0009PLLKY,I bought this for my 3 year old grandson. He is an avid fan of Bob The Builder. I viewed this video with him over the holidays - it is excellent! The content held his interest (and that is hard to do with 3 year olds)was educational and taught a lesson regarding caring for others and team work. I highly recommend it.,1168300800,3,318,4.145161290322581
