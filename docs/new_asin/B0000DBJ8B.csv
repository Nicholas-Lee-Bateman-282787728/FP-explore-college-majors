8000300,5,B0000DBJ8B,"Occasionally, surfing through the late night flicks, you run across an indie gemstone that grabs you by the pajama lapels and shakes you awake until you've finished reading the credits: such was my reaction to The Photographer. It brings home a reality many of us take a lifetime to learn: that one can never anticipate how unexpected turns in our lives will contribute to our personal growth.

The entire film circulates around the central character, Max, who eventually overcomes a form of creative paralysis and re-discovers himself, and his art, through chance encounters with complete strangers. Shot in New York City's seedy back streets (lower East Side? Old meat market district?) the collective odyssey of Max and his new-found pals (the supporting cast are very very good) embeds a bar scene that represents archetypal moments when we have chance encounters with strangers and past friends we've lost touch with but whom we have so much in common we reconsider who we are most comfortable keeping company with, and why we've made the choices we've made in our lives and careers, while raising the larger issue of why the hell we make ANY of the choices we make.

There's a kind of magic in this film (the search for Violet) that is important to tying together the micro events of a search for answers to the  questions each of the characters seek. The conclusion finds Max realizing that what he thought was so critical to his success meant very little after all.  The wonderful musical score (Andrew Hollander), and the artful cinematography (Vanja Cernjul), sustain the disruptive but ultimately satisfying mood throughout. If you don't come away feeling better about life's prospects after seeing The Photographer, you've missed it.

You would be wise to ignore comments here that dismiss The Photographer.  Judge it for yourself.  It is well worth the cost of the DVD!  Jeremy Stein, who wrote and directed it, is very talented indeed.  As I said in my opening, it's a gemstone.  You'll want this film in your film library.",1447113600,,2037,4.947214076246334

8000303,5,B0000DBJ8B,"I love films with voice over & I love films that take place in NYC, this film has both. The film opens with very nice shots of Manhattan with the protagonist doing voice over. Their is a Zen motif that runs through the film, a morality & self examination throughout the narrative. The hero goes through a metamorphosis as in most tales. The antagonist is his current girl who has no morals, almost Machiavellian, not Macbeth since there seems to be an absence of dead victims. Basically the film affected me since I miss living in NYC. I just really love this piece and that is why I suggest seeing ""The Photographer"" and if you are a New Yorker who is displaced and is sick of every other character holding a Glock, I love Glocks but this is a cool but non violent film.",1381449600,2,771,4.361111111111111
8000304,2,B0000DBJ8B,"A blend of fantasy and sci-fi give this little indie what little lift it has. The theme is a search for the meaning of life. There's a bargain with the devil, of course, and that comprises most of the movie. The acting is pretty bad throughout, and many of the scenes were shot on the same streets in Manhattan's meatpacking district before it became gentrified. This is a pre-9/11 film, so we also see the World Trade towers. I found the whole thing a bit tedious.",1314576000,,465,4.4186046511627906

8000306,4,B0000DBJ8B,"Although The Photographer has received many poor ratings and reviews (especially at such places as IMDb), this film is a true gem. In order to appreciate this film to its full potential, one must first open his/her mind. Beginning this story with the expectation of a wealthily produced Hollywood film will only set someone up for disappointment.

As for a small budget, less known film; The Photographer is one of, if not, the best. Granted the story is a bit far-fetched, along with a few characters, the film itself portrays the story excellently. This is a film where there are only a few actors, but only a few are needed to portray what is intended.

The Serendipity Factor: This film includes a few, subtle relations to itself which I call The Serendipity Factor. During the film there are times when things are set up to relate to one another and to give the viewer that little tinkling feeling when knowing that they've 'figured something out' or that they know a bit more than the characters in the film. However 'immature' these things may be in some films, Jeremy Stein does an excellent job of incorporately only a few, subtle ones that give the story an extra punch.

Filming location and lighting do a great job influencing the dark light under which this story is told. Camera movements add to a viewers continuous pondering as to what exactly is going on or what will next happen.

Overall the actors do a great job, namely Reg Rogers who plays the main character Max Martin. This is definitely a great film to watch on a weekend when you're feeling independent and want to boost your own morale a few points.",1090368000,17,1626,4.655052264808362
