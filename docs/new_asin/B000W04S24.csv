2958951,5,B000W04S24,"Don Rickles made me so uncomfortable when I was young. All that insulting--what was so funny? I didn't get it. So I watched this documentary with some trepidation... and guess what? It turned me into a fan. John Landis teases warm, funny stories out of everyone in this film and reveals something I never saw before: that Rickles' ubiquitous insults serve to reveal all the ugly hidden biases we have, and, at the same time, allow the audience to feel superior to this guy who hates everyone. It's so brilliant. I'm recommending this film to everyone who grew up, as I did, seeing Don Rickles everywhere and not appreciating his schtick. Landis shows that Rickles is a generous, hilarious man who knows how to squeeze a laugh out of even the most uptight Gen Xer.",1207699200,,763,4.659259259259259
2958952,2,B000W04S24,Rickles is an 82 yr old comedy legend and we have very little footage of his standup routine on film. I suppose we never will now. :(,1203638400,,133,3.962962962962963
2958953,3,B000W04S24,While this is a great tribute to Don Rickles and I think he's great this DVD should have came as a double disk set. One disk for the tribute and the other with an uncensored version of his stage show. Now that would have been something to buy not to mention historical.,1203465600,2,269,4.1923076923076925
2958954,5,B000W04S24,"Don Rickles is a king of comedy. His style of humor will be lost when he is gone. He does not tell stories, he insults and audiences have loved him for over 40 years. There are very few who can do what Rickles does and get away with it! His nickname Mr Warmth is known everywhere if you know comedy

However he is also an actor with many TV and film appearances to his credit, everything from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-The-Man-with-the-X-Ray-Eyes/dp/B00005AUK1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X - The Man with the X-Ray Eyes</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beach-Party-Bikini-Beach/dp/B0007R4TQW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beach Party/Bikini Beach</a>to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Toy-Story-Toy-Story-2-2-Pack/dp/B00004U9WQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Toy Story & Toy Story 2 (2 Pack)</a>. This actor did everything from drama to comedy and made you believe.

So the question is Who is the real Don Rickles?

this  special film is part of discovering Rickles. The man, the comic , the actor and human being.  You see him, before he goes out into show and some of his stage act. Note this is not a concert film of his act, it shows highlights of his act. Other comedians from Richard Lewis to Chris Rock discuss in interviews what makes Rickles a comedian they admire.

 You see in film clips from the Tonight Show appearances  and Dean Martin roasts, you see  the classic insult comic at his best in a medium that showcases his talents. My favorite piece is the Tonight Show's Johnny Carson miffed at Rickles breaking his cigarette box on the previous Tonight Show where he guest hosted, going over Rickles's show which was taping next door  and reaming the insult comic out.

Also You see Rickles the actor with interviews from Filmmaker Roger Corman and others. You see interviews and clips showing how he and Ernest Borgnine & Rickles did the Odd Couple on stage to how the comic became the  voice of Mr. Potato Head

After all is said and done, you have a little more depth of Rickles the man and performer. It is good this was done now. He seems old and frail for 82. This film showcases a major bit player and a major comic legend. In most documentaries you are bored to tears when it is over, I wished this tribute would have lasted longer...I just feel we scratched the surface of the man

2958955,5,B000W04S24,"As a kid growing up in the 70s, I loved Don Rickles.  I always tried to stay up to see him on The Tonight Show, and I caught his act several times in Vegas and on Miami Beach.  I even had a ""Cracked"" magazine devoted to him, which came out around the time of CPO Sharkey.

This is a loving tribute by steady hand John Landis, and places Don's humor, love, and affection in context by taking the viewer through the times in which Rickles worked.  Vegas, Miami Beach, the mob, Frankie, Johnny, great interview segments with close friend Bob Newhart and many others, this is a heartwarming and very affectionate tribute to a great comic and great show biz legend.",1200960000,19,660,4.429752066115703
2958956,5,B000W04S24,"I saw Mr. Warmth on HBO and I loved it. It is a great documentary on one of the all time great comedians - Don Rickles. Hilarious highlights of his stage show, his appearances on the Dean Martin comedy roasts and appearances on the Johnny Carson show. Also, many do not realize that Don Rickles is a good actor - some scenes from some of his movies such as Kelly's heroes and Run Silent, Run Deep. I found this to be very entertaining and enjoyable.",1200528000,,449,4.294117647058823

2958958,2,B000W04S24,"I watched this program on HBO. While there were some funny moments, I felt director John Landis lost the documentary's focus. The program became less a tribute to Don Rickles and his impact on comedy and more a history of Las Vegas and a tribute to the way gangsters ran the city.

I also thought there were some glaring omissions in the choice of film clips that were shown: There was no footage from the special, expanded segment of Mr. Rickles' appearance on ""The Dean Martin Show,"" in which a star-studded audience was assembled for him to insult; there were no clips from ""CPO Sharkey,"" the only TV series Don Rickles starred in that made it to a 2nd season; and there was no clip of the famous segment from ""The Tonight Show"" in which Mr. Rickles walked onto the program while Johnny Carson was in a Japanese bath.",1198022400,9,820,4.503355704697986
2958959,3,B000W04S24,"I wanted those who are considering to buy this to know this is a documentary and not one of his stage shows. With help from a whole host of celebrities, including Mr. Rickles himself, his career is told in a very heart warming way.
I must admit I was taken back at the stark change Rickles goes through. Offstage he is a very timid, mild man I hardly recognized, but as soon as he hits the stage a whole new persona emerges. Again, it's only very short clips of a show in Vegas. Lots of commentary by all and back history of his television and movie accomplishments. Kind of a ""This Is Your Life""
I found it mildly amusing. I couldn't imagine watching this more than once.",1197072000,10,672,4.299212598425197
2958960,5,B000W04S24,"I saw Mr. Rickles show on HBO and it is absolutely wonderful and very heart warming.  I had read Rickles Book and knew some of his story already but this is icing on the cake.  He did an excellent job of gathering all his family and friends together to make this story and their side, as well as his side, is such a tribute to a lifetime of someone who has made the world a better place to live.  At first, I thought it might be a bit too vulgar to watch with my parents but then I thought, ""He's THEIR generation!"", and I was right, they laughed their socks off and have told everyone to look for this show on HBO.  When I saw that there is a DVD coming out too, I couldn't wait to order that to go with my Dad's huge collection of Don Rickles movies and Dean Martin Roasts.  Thanks to Mr. Rickles for putting such a great effort into this project.  It shows and it's worth it.  He's called ""Mr. Warmth"", as a sarcastic way of how he reacts to people during his shows.  But, to us who have read his book and watched this show, he is a warm-hearted soul just doing what he does best...entertaining!  Love him!",1196812800,14,1109,4.120930232558139

I must have not understood what I was getting as I though it would be live performances of his act with small components of his life and comments from others. There was really very, very little of his classic shows and thats what I wanted. The rest was mostly dull to me but had some interesting parts. I hoped at least disc 2 would be some of his shows but its just snippets from other people and alot of the time really wasn't about him in my opinion.

kinds of people an equal share of his special venom!

You will notice no one is safe when Don Tickles is on stage from Presidents to blue collar workers. He is a part of history of Las Vegas the last of the Rat pack. I remember one episode on the tonight show when Frank Sinatra was hosting. Not a peep was made by anyone on the coach, it was like ducking the plight of being caught doing something wrong. Don Rickles"" said Frank I noticed you wife Barbra was in the audience and say she is the one with all the jewelry, at that point comic timing kicked in and Don took a nose dive tumble to the floor. I was laughing so hard.

You cannot get mad at Don Rickles it is useless he is still this little boy who looks for ways to get under people's kin. He is true life is a warm heater person I highly recommend this DVD pack 10 stars.

2959110,4,B000W04S24,"In a politically correct world, Don Rickles is an uncouth relic who still spits out vitriol and still gets away with it. To see this gent perform, especially back in the day, is to see something visceral and almost dangerous. It's really hard to do what Don Rickles does so well, has been doing so well for so many decades. Don Rickles is a fearless insult comic and he's got such a way about him that celebrities - let alone the audiences - flock to his gigs just to get a chance to be made fun of by him, because you haven't made it until Mr. Warmth has tossed some venom your way. And he does it to everyone, doesn't matter the color or gender or religious faith or political leanings or whatever. You show up, and he'll bag on you just for being a miserable human being. As someone appropriately comments in this thing: ""Don has never lost his disdain for sensitivity.""

In his Vegas act he wades into the audience like an old pugilist and barks at an old woman, ""I spoke to the Home, you're going back."" He ejects a man off his seat and then hits on the guy's woman companion. He looks at an Asian guy and tells him, ""Three years in the jungle looking for your father."" And they all laugh and don't feel stung. Don Rickles gets his just due in MR. WARMTH: THE DON RICKLES PROJECT, and maybe in this documentary we can figure out why Rickles elicits such generous laughter. This HBO homage, directed by John Landis, explores Rickles's backstory, including how he came up sharing time with stripper acts and how he broke thru at the Slate Brothers Club and how he stayed on top. We get a peek at his several flirtations with cinema, and I'm still waiting for a DVD release of CPO SHARKEY.

Archival footage provides classic clips of his guest spots on the Johnny Carson show (including when he broke Johnny's cherished cigarette box), and Johnny would never ever prepare anything; he'd just go with whatever Rickles came up with. Also here is one very memorable moment in which he made fun of Ronald Reagan in his 1985 presidential inauguration gala. But, perhaps, nothing showcases Rickles' brilliance as much as his spectacular stints on the Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts. In these roasts he raked Hollywood luminaries over the coals - mega-stars like Sinatra, Dean Martin, Hope, etc. - and the crazy thing was that they all loved it.

Heck, there's even an interesting aside as celebrities reflect on how effective the Mob actually was in running Las Vegas, before the corporate mentality swooped in. All the ""This Is Your Life"" stuff is intercut with segments from a live performance Rickles did in (I think) Vegas' Golden Nugget Hotel & Casino on March 23, 2007. Old as he is, shaky nowadays and not as sure footed under the bright lights, Mr. Warmth, the Merchant of Venom, still demonstrates that he has lost neither wit nor edge.

The man is revered by some of today's most outspoken and controversial comedians (Chris Rock, Sarah Silverman, Penn Jillette, Dave Attell, Bob Newhart... okay Newhart's not that controversial or that current), and most of them marvel at how funny Rickles is and, yeah, how he gets away with his material. Along the way, the show flirts with dissecting the nature of humor, but only a bit. People do try to break down just what it is about Rickles, with his vicious act, that make people give him a pass. I do agree that the key to Don Rickles' success and longevity is that he doesn't ever discriminate. He picks on everyone, and nothing but nothing is sacred. And there's probably something cathartic about his routine, a release. But even more than that, it's one of the worst-kept secrets in the entertainment biz that Don Rickles is genuinely a nice guy, a soft touch. You won't see it much here, but he usually ends his vicious rants with some genuine sentiment, because sweets at the end make the beatings go down easier. It's kind of like when you rag on someone but then cap it off with ""...but he's a nice guy."" Except I do think Don Rickles actually means the nice stuff he says to close out his show. But we the audience could probably do without all the singing...",1278979200,,4117,4.566982408660352

So popular is this man that people are actually willing to be insulted by him and be happy with it. There are also loving tributes from the likes of Bob Newhart, Whoopi Goldberg and John Landis. It's a fine testament to the longevity of this gifted funny man.",1277683200,,579,4.631067961165049
2959112,4,B000W04S24,"Mr. Warmth: The Don Rickles Project (2007) is a documentary by director John Landis (Animal House), about the entertainment legend, whose career has spanned over five decades.  The comedian's nickname ""Mr. Warmth"", is an ironic reference to his abrasive put down style of comedy.  While some may find him offensive, most realize that Rickles isn't a bigot, or preacher of hate, and that his unique shtick, had its genesis in a different time, when racial relations, and tolerance and acceptance for certain ideas, are not as enlightened as they are now.

In the last fifty years, the world has undergone wide sweeping changes, that are so immense, and easy to take for granted.  For those of a certain age, Don Rickles provides a window to the past.  How we may see the past will vary, but in remembering how things were, we can reflect on where we have come from, and hopefully enjoy a laugh.  Many things in life however, have not changed, and Rickles remains relevant today, although his appeal may mostly be to those over forty.

For director John Landis, this is a very personal project.  As a young man breaking into the business, Landis, worked on the production staff of the film Kelly Heroes (1969), which was shot on location in Yugoslavia.  The WW II adventure starred Clint Eastwood, Telly Savalas, Donald Sutherland, and one Don Rickles.  Rickles' acting career is unrated, and largely forgotten or unknown to many, but as is pointed out in the documentary, he was quite active in the 1960's as a guest star, and as a regular on the Dean Martin Celebrity Roast, where he absolutely killed.

Landis's 90 minute documentary features interviews with old friends and contemporaries, members of Rickles staff, younger comedians he has inspired, and other various admirers.  Among those featured are Bob Newhart, Debbie Reynolds, Clint Eastwood, Robert DeNiro, Jack Carter, Steve Lawrence, Penn Jillette, Martin Scorsese, Sara Silverman, Robin Williams, Jimmy Kimmel, and Joan Rivers.  Unfortunately, so many of Don's contemporaries are no longer with us.  In addition to these testimonials and remembrances, there is plenty from Rickles himself, including clips from his many appearances on The Tonight Show, and other talk shows.

There are also segments of Rickles performing stand up live at the Stardust and various other venues.  Rickles never engages in profanity, but unleashed live, like a playful attack dog, he will pick on various members of the audience, usually based on their ethnic background or physical appearance.  Few are safe from his barbs, as he works various religious, racial, and cultural stereotypes, into his act.  Rickles no doubt offends some people, but he has done a variation of the same act so long, that he kind of gets a pass, because people know what to expect.  As something of a relic from the past, delivering an older style of humor, Rickles is still hilarious.  Even in his 80's, the man's mind is sharp, and his insults can cut like a dagger.

Mr. Warmth, is more of a testimonial to the man, rather than a biography.  You get an idea of his personality, and affect on others in the industry, rather than a recounting of what he has done through the years.  The gruff exterior and mean spiritedness, is an act, as Rickles is actually a humble man, who works his butt off as a performer.  As many of those that knew Rickles very well, like Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., and Johnny Carson, are no longer with us, the emphasis is generally on the second half of his career, which makes the film slightly more relevant to a younger audience.

The DVD contains two discs.  The first contains the main feature, and the second has short clips of interviews with various personalities, who may or may not be discussing Rickles.  There are some interesting conversations, but most of the content on Disc 2 is extraneous, and could have been included on the first disc.

The legendary Mr. Warmth is still performing, although his live appearances are limited, and generally geared toward resort areas.  If Don Rickles is coming to your area, you may want to take the opportunity to see this comic legend, as who knows when you may have another chance to see him again.  It would also be very cool, if the series CPO Sharkey (1976-78), were released on DVD.",1275955200,,4311,4.857729138166895

As I grew older, I realized some were off the cuff silly. But others were just leveling jabs to bring down people to the same playing field. What he says in his act was just what he explains at the end, which is, everybody, everything is fair game. We are all human and life is too short without laughter so he makes fun of himself and others regardless of the taboos he undertakes. this video opens that all up and if you pay attention it will make you , maybe, refect on your ownlife. Don's great and when the time comes for his passing, we will be losing one of the last giants of that golden age of comedy. You really muct see this video!

2959115,3,B000W04S24,Growing up i loved it when Don Rickles would be scheduled on the Tonight Show lineup. He had a quick wit that surpassed those around him and when he went off into his wild mental/verbal assualts he was in a zone all his own. No one could lovingly cut people to shreds like Rickles. He seemed hateful and yet funny at the same time but there was always something special that came through from him that made you love him. He forced you to laugh at your own self no matter what background you came from and taught us all that humor and laughter is universal and the truth may hurt but laughter doeth good like a medicine. His gift was unique and only Robin Williams can hang with him when it comes to the art of fast verbal and mental connection and still be outrageous. This DVD captures some of that gift that he had but i would loved to have seen more of his Vegas show act and more clips of the classic Rickles on different talk shows of yesteryear but overall worth buying. NO one can do this kind of comedy like Rickles. This DVD makes you long for the good ole days of Johhny Carson and Las Vegas before it became a special effect freak show of trick-lighted counterfeit cardboard cutouts (see Eiffel Tower or not).

By the time the end credits roll, your face will ache from smiling and laughing - yet you'll be hard-pressed to explain just exactly what was so funny.  That's the genius of Don Rickles - his hysterical insult riffs come so fast and furious that it's impossible to explain what exactly makes the magic.  But why dissect it?

He has made guest appearances on various talk and variety shows, but rarely do these formats do him justice.  He seems most at home in recent years on Late Show with David Letterman, but as funny as Don can be with Dave, nothing compares to seeing him live.  This documentary is the closest we'll ever come to seeing one of the funniest men on the planet in his element.  We see his outrageous antics onstage, and we are privileged to see his life offstage.  I can watch this over and over (as I have), and never stop laughing.  If you haven't seen Don Rickles live, you have to - you'll never forget it.  And if you have, you probably already own this dvd.

As a document of the enduring hilarity of a classic vitriolic comedian - who still breaks me up - this DVD set (2 discs that could've been combined into one) feels like feeding pablum to a doddering old fossil. Don Rickles still has it, but the only evidence on this tribute are several clips from his live show, where he runs around the audience repeating the same line, with a few scattered mild putdowns & insults. The additional interviews with Rickles-era comedians is nice but superfluous, since most of them only talk about their times at comedy clubs back in the day, not about Rickles. This collection really should be entitled, ""Memories of Don Rickles & Friends.""
  Maybe there's another version out there, because I bought this based on a review of it by Jimmy Kimmel, who said that he hosted it. There was one clip of Jimmy Kimmel reminiscing about growing up in Las Vegas with Don Rickles headlining at one of the casinos. That was it.
  Caveat emptor: this is a nice collection of (mostly) old & new comedians, but no Rickles-palooza. There are some classic bits in it, such as Landis directing DeNiro on how to deliver a line for what seems like 20 minutes, and Sidney Poitier's recollections, and James Caan's revelation that Rickles was his inspiration for Sonny Corleone.

3193451,5,B000W04S24,"Don Rickles is a king of comedy. His style of humor will be lost when he is gone. He does not tell stories, he insults and audiences have loved him for over 40 years. There are very few who can do what Rickles does and get away with it! His nickname Mr Warmth is known everywhere if you know comedy

However he is also an actor with many TV and film appearances to his credit, everything from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-The-Man-with-the-X-Ray-Eyes/dp/B00005AUK1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X - The Man with the X-Ray Eyes</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beach-Party-Bikini-Beach/dp/B0007R4TQW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beach Party/Bikini Beach</a>to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Toy-Story-Toy-Story-2-2-Pack/dp/B00004U9WQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Toy Story & Toy Story 2 (2 Pack)</a>. This actor did everything from drama to comedy and made you believe.

So the question is Who is the real Don Rickles?

this  special film is part of discovering Rickles. The man, the comic , the actor and human being.  You see him, before he goes out into show and some of his stage act. Note this is not a concert film of his act, it shows highlights of his act. Other comedians from Richard Lewis to Chris Rock discuss in interviews what makes Rickles a comedian they admire.

 You see in film clips from the Tonight Show appearances  and Dean Martin roasts, you see  the classic insult comic at his best in a medium that showcases his talents. My favorite piece is the Tonight Show's Johnny Carson miffed at Rickles breaking his cigarette box on the previous Tonight Show where he guest hosted, going over Rickles's show which was taping next door  and reaming the insult comic out.

Also You see Rickles the actor with interviews from Filmmaker Roger Corman and others. You see interviews and clips showing how he and Ernest Borgnine & Rickles did the Odd Couple on stage to how the comic became the  voice of Mr. Potato Head

After all is said and done, you have a little more depth of Rickles the man and performer. It is good this was done now. He seems old and frail for 82. This film showcases a major bit player and a major comic legend. In most documentaries you are bored to tears when it is over, I wished this tribute would have lasted longer...I just feel we scratched the surface of the man

3193452,5,B000W04S24,"As a kid growing up in the 70s, I loved Don Rickles.  I always tried to stay up to see him on The Tonight Show, and I caught his act several times in Vegas and on Miami Beach.  I even had a ""Cracked"" magazine devoted to him, which came out around the time of CPO Sharkey.

This is a loving tribute by steady hand John Landis, and places Don's humor, love, and affection in context by taking the viewer through the times in which Rickles worked.  Vegas, Miami Beach, the mob, Frankie, Johnny, great interview segments with close friend Bob Newhart and many others, this is a heartwarming and very affectionate tribute to a great comic and great show biz legend.",1200960000,19,660,4.429752066115703
3193453,5,B000W04S24,"I saw Mr. Warmth on HBO and I loved it. It is a great documentary on one of the all time great comedians - Don Rickles. Hilarious highlights of his stage show, his appearances on the Dean Martin comedy roasts and appearances on the Johnny Carson show. Also, many do not realize that Don Rickles is a good actor - some scenes from some of his movies such as Kelly's heroes and Run Silent, Run Deep. I found this to be very entertaining and enjoyable.",1200528000,,449,4.294117647058823

3193455,2,B000W04S24,"I watched this program on HBO. While there were some funny moments, I felt director John Landis lost the documentary's focus. The program became less a tribute to Don Rickles and his impact on comedy and more a history of Las Vegas and a tribute to the way gangsters ran the city.

I also thought there were some glaring omissions in the choice of film clips that were shown: There was no footage from the special, expanded segment of Mr. Rickles' appearance on ""The Dean Martin Show,"" in which a star-studded audience was assembled for him to insult; there were no clips from ""CPO Sharkey,"" the only TV series Don Rickles starred in that made it to a 2nd season; and there was no clip of the famous segment from ""The Tonight Show"" in which Mr. Rickles walked onto the program while Johnny Carson was in a Japanese bath.",1198022400,9,820,4.503355704697986

I must admit I was taken back at the stark change Rickles goes through. Offstage he is a very timid, mild man I hardly recognized, but as soon as he hits the stage a whole new persona emerges. Again, it's only very short clips of a show in Vegas. Lots of commentary by all and back history of his television and movie accomplishments. Kind of a ""This Is Your Life""
I found it mildly amusing. I couldn't imagine watching this more than once.",1197072000,10,672,4.299212598425197

He did an excellent job of gathering all his family and friends together to make this story and their side, as well as his side, is such a tribute to a lifetime of someone who has made the world a better place to live.  At first, I thought it might be a bit too vulgar to watch with my parents but then I thought, ""He's THEIR generation!"", and I was right, they laughed their socks off and have told everyone to look for this show on HBO.  When I saw that there is a DVD coming out too, I couldn't wait to order that to go with my Dad's huge collection of Don Rickles movies and Dean Martin Roasts.  Thanks to Mr. Rickles for putting such a great effort into this project.  It shows and it's worth it.  He's called ""Mr. Warmth"", as a sarcastic way of how he reacts to people during his shows.  But, to us who have read his book and watched this show, he is a warm-hearted soul just doing what he does best...entertaining!  Love him!",1196812800,14,1109,4.120930232558139

There were comments from the Old School: Steve Lawrence, Clint Eastwood, Keely Smith and more...and the New School: Chris Rock, Kathy Griffin, Richard Lewis and more.  It had a touch of his personal and family life, and of course, greater elaboration on his career.

kinds of people an equal share of his special venom!

You will notice no one is safe when Don Tickles is on stage from Presidents to blue collar workers. He is a part of history of Las Vegas the last of the Rat pack. I remember one episode on the tonight show when Frank Sinatra was hosting. Not a peep was made by anyone on the coach, it was like ducking the plight of being caught doing something wrong. Don Rickles"" said Frank I noticed you wife Barbra was in the audience and say she is the one with all the jewelry, at that point comic timing kicked in and Don took a nose dive tumble to the floor. I was laughing so hard.

You cannot get mad at Don Rickles it is useless he is still this little boy who looks for ways to get under people's kin. He is true life is a warm heater person I highly recommend this DVD pack 10 stars.
I love you Don.

3193607,4,B000W04S24,"In a politically correct world, Don Rickles is an uncouth relic who still spits out vitriol and still gets away with it. To see this gent perform, especially back in the day, is to see something visceral and almost dangerous. It's really hard to do what Don Rickles does so well, has been doing so well for so many decades. Don Rickles is a fearless insult comic and he's got such a way about him that celebrities - let alone the audiences - flock to his gigs just to get a chance to be made fun of by him, because you haven't made it until Mr. Warmth has tossed some venom your way. And he does it to everyone, doesn't matter the color or gender or religious faith or political leanings or whatever. You show up, and he'll bag on you just for being a miserable human being. As someone appropriately comments in this thing: ""Don has never lost his disdain for sensitivity.""

In his Vegas act he wades into the audience like an old pugilist and barks at an old woman, ""I spoke to the Home, you're going back."" He ejects a man off his seat and then hits on the guy's woman companion. He looks at an Asian guy and tells him, ""Three years in the jungle looking for your father."" And they all laugh and don't feel stung. Don Rickles gets his just due in MR. WARMTH: THE DON RICKLES PROJECT, and maybe in this documentary we can figure out why Rickles elicits such generous laughter. This HBO homage, directed by John Landis, explores Rickles's backstory, including how he came up sharing time with stripper acts and how he broke thru at the Slate Brothers Club and how he stayed on top. We get a peek at his several flirtations with cinema, and I'm still waiting for a DVD release of CPO SHARKEY.

Archival footage provides classic clips of his guest spots on the Johnny Carson show (including when he broke Johnny's cherished cigarette box), and Johnny would never ever prepare anything; he'd just go with whatever Rickles came up with. Also here is one very memorable moment in which he made fun of Ronald Reagan in his 1985 presidential inauguration gala. But, perhaps, nothing showcases Rickles' brilliance as much as his spectacular stints on the Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts. In these roasts he raked Hollywood luminaries over the coals - mega-stars like Sinatra, Dean Martin, Hope, etc. - and the crazy thing was that they all loved it.

Heck, there's even an interesting aside as celebrities reflect on how effective the Mob actually was in running Las Vegas, before the corporate mentality swooped in. All the ""This Is Your Life"" stuff is intercut with segments from a live performance Rickles did in (I think) Vegas' Golden Nugget Hotel & Casino on March 23, 2007. Old as he is, shaky nowadays and not as sure footed under the bright lights, Mr. Warmth, the Merchant of Venom, still demonstrates that he has lost neither wit nor edge.

The man is revered by some of today's most outspoken and controversial comedians (Chris Rock, Sarah Silverman, Penn Jillette, Dave Attell, Bob Newhart... okay Newhart's not that controversial or that current), and most of them marvel at how funny Rickles is and, yeah, how he gets away with his material. Along the way, the show flirts with dissecting the nature of humor, but only a bit. People do try to break down just what it is about Rickles, with his vicious act, that make people give him a pass. I do agree that the key to Don Rickles' success and longevity is that he doesn't ever discriminate. He picks on everyone, and nothing but nothing is sacred. And there's probably something cathartic about his routine, a release. But even more than that, it's one of the worst-kept secrets in the entertainment biz that Don Rickles is genuinely a nice guy, a soft touch. You won't see it much here, but he usually ends his vicious rants with some genuine sentiment, because sweets at the end make the beatings go down easier. It's kind of like when you rag on someone but then cap it off with ""...but he's a nice guy."" Except I do think Don Rickles actually means the nice stuff he says to close out his show. But we the audience could probably do without all the singing...",1278979200,,4117,4.566982408660352

So popular is this man that people are actually willing to be insulted by him and be happy with it. There are also loving tributes from the likes of Bob Newhart, Whoopi Goldberg and John Landis. It's a fine testament to the longevity of this gifted funny man.",1277683200,,579,4.631067961165049
3193609,4,B000W04S24,"Mr. Warmth: The Don Rickles Project (2007) is a documentary by director John Landis (Animal House), about the entertainment legend, whose career has spanned over five decades.  The comedian's nickname ""Mr. Warmth"", is an ironic reference to his abrasive put down style of comedy.  While some may find him offensive, most realize that Rickles isn't a bigot, or preacher of hate, and that his unique shtick, had its genesis in a different time, when racial relations, and tolerance and acceptance for certain ideas, are not as enlightened as they are now.

In the last fifty years, the world has undergone wide sweeping changes, that are so immense, and easy to take for granted.  For those of a certain age, Don Rickles provides a window to the past.  How we may see the past will vary, but in remembering how things were, we can reflect on where we have come from, and hopefully enjoy a laugh.  Many things in life however, have not changed, and Rickles remains relevant today, although his appeal may mostly be to those over forty.

For director John Landis, this is a very personal project.  As a young man breaking into the business, Landis, worked on the production staff of the film Kelly Heroes (1969), which was shot on location in Yugoslavia.  The WW II adventure starred Clint Eastwood, Telly Savalas, Donald Sutherland, and one Don Rickles.  Rickles' acting career is unrated, and largely forgotten or unknown to many, but as is pointed out in the documentary, he was quite active in the 1960's as a guest star, and as a regular on the Dean Martin Celebrity Roast, where he absolutely killed.

Landis's 90 minute documentary features interviews with old friends and contemporaries, members of Rickles staff, younger comedians he has inspired, and other various admirers.  Among those featured are Bob Newhart, Debbie Reynolds, Clint Eastwood, Robert DeNiro, Jack Carter, Steve Lawrence, Penn Jillette, Martin Scorsese, Sara Silverman, Robin Williams, Jimmy Kimmel, and Joan Rivers.  Unfortunately, so many of Don's contemporaries are no longer with us.  In addition to these testimonials and remembrances, there is plenty from Rickles himself, including clips from his many appearances on The Tonight Show, and other talk shows.

There are also segments of Rickles performing stand up live at the Stardust and various other venues.  Rickles never engages in profanity, but unleashed live, like a playful attack dog, he will pick on various members of the audience, usually based on their ethnic background or physical appearance.  Few are safe from his barbs, as he works various religious, racial, and cultural stereotypes, into his act.  Rickles no doubt offends some people, but he has done a variation of the same act so long, that he kind of gets a pass, because people know what to expect.  As something of a relic from the past, delivering an older style of humor, Rickles is still hilarious.  Even in his 80's, the man's mind is sharp, and his insults can cut like a dagger.

Mr. Warmth, is more of a testimonial to the man, rather than a biography.  You get an idea of his personality, and affect on others in the industry, rather than a recounting of what he has done through the years.  The gruff exterior and mean spiritedness, is an act, as Rickles is actually a humble man, who works his butt off as a performer.  As many of those that knew Rickles very well, like Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., and Johnny Carson, are no longer with us, the emphasis is generally on the second half of his career, which makes the film slightly more relevant to a younger audience.

The DVD contains two discs.  The first contains the main feature, and the second has short clips of interviews with various personalities, who may or may not be discussing Rickles.  There are some interesting conversations, but most of the content on Disc 2 is extraneous, and could have been included on the first disc.

The legendary Mr. Warmth is still performing, although his live appearances are limited, and generally geared toward resort areas.  If Don Rickles is coming to your area, you may want to take the opportunity to see this comic legend, as who knows when you may have another chance to see him again.  It would also be very cool, if the series CPO Sharkey (1976-78), were released on DVD.",1275955200,,4311,4.857729138166895
3193610,4,B000W04S24,"I throughly enjoyed the insight into Don Rickles and life. I grew up watching my parents in awe of his comic quips and back then, I never got it. As I grew older, I realized some were off the cuff silly. But others were just leveling jabs to bring down people to the same playing field. What he says in his act was just what he explains at the end, which is, everybody, everything is fair game. We are all human and life is too short without laughter so he makes fun of himself and others regardless of the taboos he undertakes. this video opens that all up and if you pay attention it will make you , maybe, refect on your ownlife. Don's great and when the time comes for his passing, we will be losing one of the last giants of that golden age of comedy. You really muct see this video!

3193612,3,B000W04S24,Growing up i loved it when Don Rickles would be scheduled on the Tonight Show lineup. He had a quick wit that surpassed those around him and when he went off into his wild mental/verbal assualts he was in a zone all his own. No one could lovingly cut people to shreds like Rickles. He seemed hateful and yet funny at the same time but there was always something special that came through from him that made you love him. He forced you to laugh at your own self no matter what background you came from and taught us all that humor and laughter is universal and the truth may hurt but laughter doeth good like a medicine. His gift was unique and only Robin Williams can hang with him when it comes to the art of fast verbal and mental connection and still be outrageous. This DVD captures some of that gift that he had but i would loved to have seen more of his Vegas show act and more clips of the classic Rickles on different talk shows of yesteryear but overall worth buying. NO one can do this kind of comedy like Rickles. This DVD makes you long for the good ole days of Johhny Carson and Las Vegas before it became a special effect freak show of trick-lighted counterfeit cardboard cutouts (see Eiffel Tower or not). Bring back the real Vegas where it was all about talented entertainers without the tricks.,1263168000,7,1311,4.355102040816327

At 82 years old, I think he should be cleaning up his act a little.  He was HILARIOUS in many TV specials including the Dean Martin Roasts, and countless varitey shows.

If this is a sample of how he conducts himself in modern ""live"" shows, then I want no part of it.  I wish they WOULD release a compilation of his older (and much cleaner) performances.",1257465600,12,496,4.358695652173913

A unique talent deserves a unique showcase, and Landis has created a film which not only appropriately honors Rickles' extraordinary talent, humor and intelligence, but also provides a solid hour-and-a-half of near non-stop hilarity.  By the time the end credits roll, your face will ache from smiling and laughing - yet you'll be hard-pressed to explain just exactly what was so funny.  That's the genius of Don Rickles - his hysterical insult riffs come so fast and furious that it's impossible to explain what exactly makes the magic.  But why dissect it?  Just sit back and enjoy the highly-crafted work of one of the greatest comics of all time - captured in a feel-good movie by a thoughtful (if unconvnetional) documentarian...I guarantee you'll laugh your head off!",1243382400,6,1008,5.121951219512195

He has made guest appearances on various talk and variety shows, but rarely do these formats do him justice.  He seems most at home in recent years on Late Show with David Letterman, but as funny as Don can be with Dave, nothing compares to seeing him live.  This documentary is the closest we'll ever come to seeing one of the funniest men on the planet in his element.  We see his outrageous antics onstage, and we are privileged to see his life offstage.  I can watch this over and over (as I have), and never stop laughing.  If you haven't seen Don Rickles live, you have to - you'll never forget it.  And if you have, you probably already own this dvd.

As a document of the enduring hilarity of a classic vitriolic comedian - who still breaks me up - this DVD set (2 discs that could've been combined into one) feels like feeding pablum to a doddering old fossil. Don Rickles still has it, but the only evidence on this tribute are several clips from his live show, where he runs around the audience repeating the same line, with a few scattered mild putdowns & insults. The additional interviews with Rickles-era comedians is nice but superfluous, since most of them only talk about their times at comedy clubs back in the day, not about Rickles. This collection really should be entitled, ""Memories of Don Rickles & Friends.""
  Maybe there's another version out there, because I bought this based on a review of it by Jimmy Kimmel, who said that he hosted it. There was one clip of Jimmy Kimmel reminiscing about growing up in Las Vegas with Don Rickles headlining at one of the casinos. That was it.
  Caveat emptor: this is a nice collection of (mostly) old & new comedians, but no Rickles-palooza. There are some classic bits in it, such as Landis directing DeNiro on how to deliver a line for what seems like 20 minutes, and Sidney Poitier's recollections, and James Caan's revelation that Rickles was his inspiration for Sonny Corleone.
