On another note, the two main acting people play the main parts in all of the programs. This may or may not have been the best casting decision.

Finally, this presentation has the very insulting feature of canned laughter injected here and there. I would like the BBC and ITC to send the people who are responsible for this into being desert hermit monks",1174003200,5,601,4.607476635514018
7993717,5,B00009WNVM,"I have not reviewed the DVD; however, I watched the Code of the Mulliners so many times on PBS in the 70s that I had the dialog pretty well memorized.  Cecil Mulliner's mother was going mad.  Since we all know that madness is hereditary, Cecil had to get disengaged from the girl he loved but breaking an engagement is against the Code of the Mulliners.  However, there were some quite brilliant chaps at the Drones Club to advise him.  The solution was to employ a melodrama queen past her prime(Collins) to break things up.  At a Savoy luncheon with his mother and fiance, Collins confronted him:  ""You swine!""...He:  ""Waiter some wine""...  Collins:  ""You have treated me shabbily""...He:  "" Waiter!  Chablis"".  To everyone's utter surprise, all turns out right for everyone in the end.  Do not miss it.",1061856000,8,804,4.781021897810219
