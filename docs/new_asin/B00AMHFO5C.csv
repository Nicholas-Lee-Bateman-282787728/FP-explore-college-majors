8553760,3,B00AMHFO5C,"Most of this documentary is fascinating, especially the interviews with ordinary East Germans talking about their difficult circumstances and how they coped. But for reasons only known to the filmmakers, it was decided to also include clips from an American academic who appears to belong in an entirely different movie. Nothing she says relates to the Germans interviewees. She offers only obvious and belabored general points. It seems as if some producer said, ""We have to include an American to help make the movie relevant to US viewers."" The film would have been much stronger staying just with the Germans.",1501372800,,613,5.14

8553762,5,B00AMHFO5C,"A fascinating look at East Germany in general and the Berlin Wall in particular. The story of the Wall from its first erection to the post-fall and reunification period is explored, with commentary from a wide spectrum of people. Former leaders are among those commenting, but also many in other professions. The psychological impact of the Wall, the jubilation of November 1989, and the aftermath are on display throughout, and both positive and negative effects from reunification are examined. The end result is compelling and humanizing, and essential viewing in regards to the Cold War.",1369699200,11,591,5.231578947368421
