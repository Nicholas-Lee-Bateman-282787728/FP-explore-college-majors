6680200,4,B00NU30YF0,"Made as a co production with the BBC and Polish TV this was shown during the remembrance of the 100th anniversary of `the war to end all wars'. The synopsis is that this is the full five years of that terrible and pointless conflict seen through the eyes of two ordinary soldiers. One is English - called Tommy (predictable I know but still a great name) the other Michael is German. It is through their `ordinary' experiences that we are taken on a tour of World War I.

Now we do have a number of issues dealt with, the lying about your age to be allowed to walk slowly towards slaughter for King and country is covered. The gas attacks, the not wanting to be a coward (no mention of the nasty white feathers though), the food shortages, lice, playing footie in no man's land and the `affairs of the heart'. The uniforms are good though as are the guns, and the musical score is excellent.

Now the bad bits, first off everyone speaks English with a Home Counties accent - even the Germans. The only attempt at an accent is from the Polish nurse. So it is a good job they have good uniforms or you forget which side is which. There are six half hour episodes and on the DVD they have left in all the previews of the next episode and then when it finally starts you have a montage of what previously happened. This could and should have been edited out.

Then the coincidence and plot contrivances and the sheer unbelivability of some of the antics are just a bit insulting on the intelligence. There is also an amazing lack of blood and gore which was done for a certain audience I know, but war should never be sanitised it is the first step to making it acceptable and as such is the lowest form of propaganda. Then the bits that have been `borrowed' from `All Quiet on the Western Front' and even the ending shot is a straight lift from the excellent master piece of French cinema `Wooden Crosses'. If you are going to tackle such a subject matter then do it realistically and do it justice, this was a mish mash of seen before, could have done better and over sentimentality in lieu of having anything really valid or original to say.

Having said all of the above this was clearly aimed at an early evening younger audience and so a lot of the criticisms - though still valid - are somewhat mitigated, I would rank at 7/10 but I am regrading to 4 stars from my original 3.",1432512000,5,2379,4.3393258426966295
6680201,3,B00NU30YF0,"An interesting series, but I had trouble following who was who, as the leads looked so similar.  German soldiers really should have just had subtitles, as them all speaking English, as also the similarities in their appearances made it hard to follow.",1528848000,2,251,4.976190476190476
6680202,2,B00NU30YF0,"Horribly disappointing. The BBC is routinely pushing out these romanticized thinly written, marginally acted productions with beautiful lighting and swelling music instead of the quality groundbreaking programs it used to do. I did not watch all episodes, couldn't put myself through it. That the two mirror image boys both die is predictable; though with some of the chance meetings and cut-away looks they could have easily ended up in bed with each other.",1528675200,,458,5.287671232876712
6680203,2,B00NU30YF0,"Incredibly disappointing. Good writers talk about ""show me, don't tell me"" in storytelling. The directing and camera work in this miniseries could have benefited from that old chestnut. The director knew what he wanted, but not how to achieve it. The story progression seemed to go ""Ok, this where we have the boys come home for the first time amidst lots of emotion but it will be the understated kind of emotion, this is the scene where the love interest develops behind the lines against all odds, we'll put the loss-of-innocence-at the-front Part IV here.""  As a result, the story mostly felt pantomimed. Lots of tiresome, barely coherent scenes that failed to build the world the character inhabited, let along to inspire you to care about them.

Expect plenty of the familiar threadbare cinematic shorthand for ""young boys growing up before their time at the front"" along with overused wartime emotional cues. Bad things happened, it was hard to care.

Character development was dull. Most scenes meant to have a character making an emotional connection is met with a thud. The short episode length probably didn't help, but can't take all the blame.

The acting was nothing exceptional: it took half the first episode to realize these were boys from two different countries.

It made me upset that this subject was so mistreated. This conflict crushed empires, brutally took away a generation of young men from Europe, and birthed the modern era. It deserves better than this series. The subject is worthy of tears, not this movie.

Alternatively, other WWI movies worth recommending (many of which are on Prime) are My Boy Jack with Daniel Radcliffe, All the Kings Men with Maggie Smith, Beneath Hill 60, or The Trench with Daniel Craig. Also, BBC's Our World War is a very well handled miniseries recreating the true accounts of actual soldiers.

This gets the extra star for good costuming and scenery on what was clearly a tight budget.",1528675200,3,1947,4.935779816513762
6680204,5,B00NU30YF0,"The 5 star rating is termed ""I loved it"" but that's not it.  It's all 5 stars because it tore my heart out and reminded me of being human.  So much waste and agony and dismay to know what's in store in a mere 20 years.",1527465600,2,218,3.717391304347826
6680205,1,B00NU30YF0,"I'll be a spoiler, at the end the two main characters of this movie dead after fours years of war, on the last day of the war!",1527206400,,126,3.7037037037037037
6680206,5,B00NU30YF0,Spellbinding account including civilians and soldiers. The basic commonality on both sides really stands out. Senseless slaughter for no real purpose. Sad.,1526515200,2,155,6.090909090909091
6680207,5,B00NU30YF0,Innocence dies in war.  Soldiers honor soldiers.  Very good movie and recommend to all,1526083200,,86,5.071428571428571
6680208,4,B00NU30YF0,"I have watched a lot of war movies. For some reason I really got involved with the characters in this one. Other viewers have mentioned that the ending is contrived as are several other scenes. I also have to admit that I was confused, at first, about who was who. The two lead actors look very similar and it took me awhile to tell them apart. I like that there was not a lot of blood and gore. Don't think it's necessary just because someone is hurt or been killed.

Thought the battle scenes were well done. The battle at the end of the third episode is especially nerve wracking. I felt I was in the middle of the battle with the characters and yet looking at it from afar. There are some typical hand wringing moments when you're hoping for a good outcome but know that all is probably not going to go well.

I think this might be a good movie to see with teens and young adults. Many times the realities of war get lost in all the politics and nation bashing. It would do us all good, especially for the people who send us out to fight, to think about those fighting and those waiting for them to come home. Could lead to some good discussion.",1525737600,5,1149,4.218181818181818
6680209,5,B00NU30YF0,"Exciting but overly dramatic.  The ending was somewhat silly.  Overall worthwhile though, and highly recommended.",1517270400,3,113,6.466666666666667
6680210,3,B00NU30YF0,"This was a reasonably realistic portrayal of British and German soldiers.  However, it could have done without that corny ending which I won't describe here because I don't want o be a spoiler.",1461196800,2,193,4.848484848484849
8680244,4,B00NU30YF0,"The title of this miniseries comes from the first line of Wilfred Owen's 1917 poem, 'Anthem for Doomed Youth': ""What passing-bells for these who die as cattle?"" It attempts to show the innocence and misguided bravery of the extremely youthful soldiers who enlisted in World War I from the outset, having no idea what they were in for or even why.

The two leads play a German youth and a British youth who sign up that way, and the film follows their separate experiences of the interminable and increasingly meaningless war. (They do cross paths now and then, which adds further meaning to the film.) The acting of both leads is fine.

The main issue with the miniseries is that it was deliberately aimed at a younger audience and family viewing, so it is slightly sanitized, and slightly one-dimensional, and adults may find it  somewhat unfulfilling. There is a certain eloquence about it, however, especially as it concludes. And it can certainly be very educational for younger viewers.

One issue that seems inevitable is that it is initially hard to tell apart the British and German regiments, since British actors were used for both and their uniforms are not terribly distinctive. Although it's clear in the beginning which is which because German soldiers were still wearing ornate pointed helmets, the Germans had soon dispensed with them and so the viewer has to pay very close attention from the very beginning. Theoretically the BBC could have found young Germans to play all of those roles (speaking English with German accents), but I'm fairly certain that would have been way out of their budget for this relatively minor project which was one of dozens of WWI productions commissioned for the centenary of the war.

I'm not sure who I would recommend this for, but it does have a certain slow-moving eloquence, and is suitable for young viewers, young history or war fans, and family viewing.",1533945600,,1911,4.904024767801857
8680245,3,B00NU30YF0,"The actors did a good job, but it would have been better, in my opinion, to have a clear definition between the young, sweet, fair-haired boys with english accents on the British side, and the young, sweet, fair-haired boys with english accents on the German side. The ending was a bit much, a what-are-the-odds type of thing, but there you go.",1532908800,,344,4.655737704918033

8680247,3,B00NU30YF0,I've just started watching but the one thing that I wish they would have done in the casting is use english speaking German actors for those parts. It was difficult in the beginning to figure out which one was the Brit and which one was the German.,1531094400,,248,4.297872340425532
8680248,2,B00NU30YF0,"Typical British great War stuff.  The British characters are believable, but the German ones are not.  They come across as public school Englishmen, not Germans.",1531008000,,161,5.4
8680249,5,B00NU30YF0,"Many subtle messages that many of the critics missed. Having both sides speak English just emphasised how similar the boys and families on both sides were, a strength not a weakness. Also, the ending reinforced the message of the impact of war on so many normal people. I don't write many reviews and I am far from a pacifist, but I was really moved by the series and how it captured these aspects of war.",1530921600,,405,4.413333333333333

8680252,5,B00NU30YF0,"War! As a VietNam combat vet, USMC, this was so real and so sad. Politicians sit in polished offices, while our young men and women die on the battlefield.
