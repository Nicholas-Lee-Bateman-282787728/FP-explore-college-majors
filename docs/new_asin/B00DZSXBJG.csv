8599525,1,B00DZSXBJG,"I agree with the first posting here. This is a terrible video transfer, foggy and indistinct. The sound is awful, barely heard unless you really crank up the volume. And, most fatally, the image is cropped to a square old-style TV format. You're not seeing the whole picture. In short, AVOID. There is no reason to get this when copies of the complete, authentic version are available on the Image / Ruscico  DVD release. What this film deserves, of course, is a full restoration in Blu Ray. But the Image DVD is fine for now.",1438473600,5,526,4.536842105263158
8599526,1,B00DZSXBJG,Rotten transfer - not widescreen. Poor color.  I have now obtained a better dvd version which shows up just how bad this lamentable technical botched transfer is.  Great movie - actually a masterpiece from an immortal novel - but not served well in this DVD transfer.,1385337600,12,267,4.782608695652174
