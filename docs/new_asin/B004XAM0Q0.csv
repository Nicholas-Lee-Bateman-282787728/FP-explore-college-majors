4493316,5,B004XAM0Q0,"I watched this when they were showing it as a part of a limited theater release, and I've been aching for it's blu-ray release since! There are few words that can describe how awesome this movie is. The animation is beyond top-notch, with an art style that pops with every frame and keeps your eyes watering from not blinking.

The best way I can describe this film is that its like taking the visual flourish and high-adrenaline action of the live action&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Speed-Racer/dp/B003M5AXN4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Speed Racer</a>&nbsp;film, smashing it against the entirety of what made&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gurren-Lagann/dp/B003P3PQNA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gurren Lagann</a>&nbsp;one of the most beloved Japanese anime series of the past decade, mixing the two together and cranking all of that up to 11, and then condensing it into an hour and a half experience of visual and aural orgasmica with all of the goodness, none of the filler.

Plus, there's a cute love story in it for those so inclined.",1326758400,37,1130,6.1455696202531644
4493317,5,B004XAM0Q0,"This should be required viewing for anyone who appreciates animation as an art.  The hand-drawn work put into this would be astounding in any age, and is more so in our age of over-hyped 3D spectaculars.  Add to that a very well choreographed sound track.  Some critics fault the lack of plot development and character development, but I feel it is just fine the way it is.  In the end its all about the race to the finish.  The rest can be left to one's imagination to determine what motivates them / why they are there.

The main reason I posted this review is to recommend that my fellow english speakers NEED to see the dubbed version.  Many english-speaking anime fans I know can be very purist with their attitude toward sub-titled versus dubbed viewing.  I must agree I've heard some awful dubbed work, and some can be down-right painful to listen too.  Also the differences between subs and dubs can be quite funny.  That said, the dub of Red Line is well done in my opinion.  I'm not the quickest reader in the world, but I was amazed after watching the dub how much detail I had missed the first time viewing the sub because I was too busy reading.  This movie is a visual feast.  Some might find it a stretch of a comparison, but I was reminded of the first time I saw Heavy Metal.

So get it, pop some popcorn, kick back, shut your brain off and enjoy. :)",1326758400,2,1367,4.351778656126482
4493318,5,B004XAM0Q0,ABSOLUTLYYYYY FFF%&&^%$#%^^&*&^%$#$%^&*(*&^%$ AAWWWWSSOOOOMMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!! this movie i jst breathtaking to look at. a visual treat. gave me goosebumps even at the beggining.,1326758400,,189,8.047619047619047
4493319,5,B004XAM0Q0,this is so cool i hate racing and don't like long movies. this is the coolest thing ever i love it with all my heart you must get if you are interested in any anime!,1325462400,,165,3.742857142857143
4493320,5,B004XAM0Q0,"Look. I understand. ""Anime"" isn't a cool thing to most people, not even most self-described ""geeks."" These days, ""anime"" is commonly used as shorthand for a particular type of storytelling, characterization, or visualization...and the people who do so NEVER mean it as a compliment. Maybe you're one of these people yourself.

Or maybe you used to watch anime and no longer really do because you've got music, videogames, and regular movies/TV to watch instead. Maybe you used to watch stuff like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cowboy-Bebop/dp/B00102FF7U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cowboy Bebop</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/FLCL/dp/B004DMIISM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">FLCL</a>&nbsp;on the Cartoon Network, but never really saw anything else that you liked as much. Maybe you end up spotting some anime that is on Netflix or Hulu, but you don't feel like watching them all the way through.

Does any of that sound like you or someone you know? Then watch this movie.

There's no TV show or comicbook with hundreds of episodes you have to know about first. There's nothing ""Final Fantasy"" or ""Kingdom Hearts""-like about the story or characters. There's no harem of girls surrounding some loser guy. There are no ""jokes"" involving giant sweatdrops or accidentally copping a feel. This is different from all of that.

Redline is visually astonishing with a soundtrack to match, but contrary to what is often said Redline's strong points aren't JUST those. This movie has great characters, each of whom is memorable in their own way. There's a lot of humor, and the film's comic timing (and restraint!) is spot-on. The story isn't shallow or even minimal. By the time everything ends, you'll know all that needs to be known about who these racers are and why they're doing what they do.

I don't care about racing or cars. But I totally dig Redline. I think you will too.",1325203200,282,1970,5.641891891891892
4493321,5,B004XAM0Q0,"Spectacular visual and music make this a must buy.
Story is rather lacking, but you will forget about story after 5 seconds into the anime.",1324944000,5,139,4.6
4493322,4,B004XAM0Q0,"`Redline' is a rare film in today's Japanese animation film industry because it is wholly hand drawn (rather than CG) and the stunning visuals on screen justify this audacious decision.

Redline is a racing tournament where anything goes as long as you reach the finishing line.  JP is one of the drivers who guides his classic Trans-Am through the pitfalls of the course and tries to avoid the guided weapons coming his way.  Sonoshee is another driver who JP is in love with and they both try to survive the onslaught coming from the leaders of Roboworld, where the final race is to take place.  With corrupt gambling and ruthless opponents the race (and film) is set up for thrills and spills.

The animation is very impressive, although not as soft as the Ghibli films I particularly enjoy and this is an animation aimed squarely at an adult audience.  The racing scenes are particularly well animated and once you realise this is hand drawn the backgrounds and small details stand out all the more.

There is also a `making of' documentary on the disc which sheds some light in the creative process.

I have many, many Japanese anime films in my film collection and this is a worthy addition to that collection.  The attention to detail is staggering, the animation is very impressive, the story is pretty decent and the sound effects and dubbing are good as well.  All in all if you are a fan of Japanese animation then this is well worth a look, it may be grittier than some films you may have already seen, but it is just as accomplished and well produced.

Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.",1324684800,7,1635,4.565068493150685
4493323,5,B004XAM0Q0,"Going against modern conventions of animation, Redline was created using hand-drawn sketches - over 100,000 of them - rather than computer graphics. The result is a film of gorgeous style, setting, colour and visual complexity. The extraordinary level of detail isn't restricted to the visuals; every sound has been painstakingly mapped onto the film, while the backing soundtrack (which sounds like a Japanese version of Ministry's 'Psalm 69') was custom-created for the scenes, ensuring that the music always fits the action.

The story centres around Redline, a once-every-five-years racing event with no rules except the winner being first one across the finish line. Most vehicles are heavily armed ( la Mad Max or Death Race 2000), but the main protagonist - an adrenaline-junkie racer named JP - refuses to carry weapons, instead insisting that he has the talent to win on speed alone. JP's pacifist attitude has earned him the outstanding nickname of the Very Sweet Weaponless Prince. Visually, JP is a likeable anime hybrid of John Travolta in Grease crossed with James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause. His friendship with (wonderfully named) fellow racer Cherry Boy Hunter Sonoshee McLaren, develops into a love interest which runs parallel to the main story of the race. On the surface, Redline is a high-octane, heavily stylised mixture of the movies Death Race 2000 and Mad Max, the cartoon Wacky Races, and the computer games Total Wipeout and Unreal Tournament. Look deeper than the high-speed races across sweeping vistas and rocky mesas, however, and you'll find more going on. There's a backdrop of military tyranny that parallels our modern world, with corrupt forces masquerading as the 'good guys' while attempting to silence the voices of freedom. Additionally, a Cinderella story develops between Sonoshee and JP. When Sonoshee drops an earring, JP mounts his supersonic motorcycle and goes for a midnight ride, just to leave the earring and some flowers on Sonoshee's doorstep. The futuristic race is simply the context against which the plot is set. The real theme of the film is a timeless one: love and friendship can conquer all.

Redline is a meticulously crafted work of art. It has both style and substance. Rich in allegorical elements and moral themes, the film is a masterwork of anime.

Viewers can have additional fun by comparing the English voice-over with the subtitles (which seem to be direct translations of the original Japanese). The differences are sometimes considerable and often amusing.",1324252800,15,2533,5.203431372549019
4493324,5,B004XAM0Q0,"This is one of the most important anime to come along in years. Not only is it visually stunning, but the music and sounds make it truly brilliant. The styling of it makes it so appealing to watch that you won't want it to end. Combine that with an amazing soundtrack, and you will be glad you own it. If you have a home theater system, it will shake your walls.

This is one of those movies that even if you aren't an anime fan, you will love it. All I can say is if you are uncertain about buying it, don't be. Here is the official story synopsis since Amazon doesn't have anything up yet.

REDLINE is about the biggest and most deadly racing tournament in the universe. Only held once every five years, everyone wants to stake their claim to fame, including JP, a reckless dare-devil driver oblivious to speed limits with his ultra-customized car - all the while, organized crime and militaristic governments want to leverage the race to their own ends. Amongst the other elite rival drivers in the tournament, JP falls for the alluring Sonoshee - but will she prove his undoing, or can a high speed romance survive a mass destruction race?",1318982400,49,1143,4.490384615384615
4493325,5,B004XAM0Q0,"If you enjoy quality animation and are interested in anything the likes of the F-zero videogames, then you'll probably enjoy this.  It doesn't have your stereotypical cookie cutter anime faces, and I kind of found some parts funny just the way they show the level of speed they're going at.  This very much has the feel of some of your wipeout or similar old school futuristic racing games with speed and combat as a focus.  It has had ok rewatch value for me, and is certainly worth at least one watch through.  Just don't get too overhyped about it, it is a great movie, but you can ruin any film by getting your hopes too high.",1523232000,,630,4.405172413793103
4493326,5,B004XAM0Q0,"This movie is an incredible ride. The quality of the animation is top-tier and perfectly captures the impossible speed and power of the machines they're racing in. I can't stop myself from smiling the entire Yellow Line race in the beginning, no matter how many times I watch it. It's not a perfect movie, there are weird bits and many plot threads that don't get tied up, but it's a must-see experience.",1522800000,,404,4.625

4493331,3,B004XAM0Q0,"I feel this move is a bit over-rated... Yes the animation is superb, and it's definitely worth a 1 time watch, but the story just isn't there. For the cost of the Blu Ray, it's worth it, BUT, I don't feel like this is a movie I would ever feel the need to watch more than once. This would be a great pick to watch with a few friends over beers, because you don't really have to pay attention, but if you are looking for an anime that offers something other than eye candy, this will disappoint you. I sold my copy on eBay immediately after watching.",1520899200,,549,4.140186915887851

It has amazing animation, it has lots of characters, it has a futuristic feel of racing....Almost reminds me of ""F-Zero"" maybe that's why i love it so much. I wished they made more of this style of animation but considering it took them a few years to create I don't see no one following their footsteps. This might not be for some people but for me it was.  Give it a chance and support them if you like it",1517097600,,483,4.193548387096774

4493342,5,B004XAM0Q0,"Redline is one of the most visually stunning and stimulating experiences I will ever have in my life, nothing prepares you for the heart pounding intensity presented here. After seven years of blood and sweat Redline emerges from Madhouse as a masterpiece of action and frame by frame animation unparalleled in cinema. Redline's story and characters take a backseat to the absurd action and soundtrack creating the most furious, heated and downright incredible sequences of action entertainment that are sure leave you in a state of shock. The waves of sadness and joy that flow once the credits roll are immeasurable and the desire to re watch this movie could never be higher. I give Redline a 5/5 and praise Takeshi Koike for gracing the planet with such a work of art.",1514764800,,772,4.856060606060606

4493364,5,B004XAM0Q0,"Seriously one of my favorite movies ever. It's slick, stylish, weird, funny, and exciting. A big obvious draw to the movie is the impeccable art style. High contrast shadows with strong color choices, all made beautiful in motion with incredible hand-drawn animation. It's an absolutely gorgeous movie with a flavor of its own in every way. Every shot is well-done and could serve as a standalone piece. It's seriously something to behold. The story is fun and simple. There's a big intergalactic race held every 5 years to find out who's the best. The characters and their designs are are really fun and distinct, with the main lead JP having a special place in my heart mostly taken up by his reality-defying pompadour. The soundtrack makes me think of things like Jet Set Radio or something, it's a quirky and unique sound that really compliments the rest of the movie's oddball style. All in all, this movie is incredible. The races are a lot of fun to watch and the characters are really enjoyable to see. It easily hits one of my favorites of all time and I would recommend this movie to anyone who is into animation, art, or unique styles.",1499904000,4,1146,4.678217821782178

4493385,4,B004XAM0Q0,"**No Spoilers**

Mix Mad Max Fury Road with NASCAR and you got Redline. This is a insane racing Anime Movie that has its charm. The character development is good and the art is very well done. If you don't like those types of movies that create a world that it takes place in and then starts with little explanation of the said world, its not for you. The gist is good versus evil, not a new concept for any movie but it has done it in a unique way.

If you like racing, Anime, and action, give this movie a shot as it has its appeal but is easily over looked.",1488931200,,560,4.036036036036036

  Telling a story of a racer JP and his mechanic Frisbee chasing the dream of winning the redline cup while also fixing the races they participate in order to please the mafia bosses they owe money to. The story is full of amazing racing segments and some good drama thrown in for good measure. The story also follows JP's love interest with fellow racer Sonoshi and a corrupt government that doesn't want races held in its territory.
  Red line is a beautiful story with amazing visuals and endearing characters that will be full of surprises throughout the movie, most definitely a great to watch when you have the taste for some adrenaline filled film.",1487030400,,868,4.65359477124183

4493389,5,B004XAM0Q0,"The original film Redline was released in 2007. This is a review of the Anime version of RedLine which was released in2012. I saw this on Amazon Prime Video as a streamed movie and so can't comment about the DVD, Blu-Ray or their respective packaging.
I've seen both the live-action and animated version of this film. They have some character names in common and they're both vaguely about racing but if you were expecting the Anime to follow the 2007 original movie you'd be wrong. The anime does have some of the same plot elementsbut really let's rip as a visual feast.
This is modern Anime! The faces and expressions of the characters remind me of the animations in the original animated Aeonflux stories. The colour paleete and action sequences come from the very best modern Japanese studios. NEver mind the plot feel the emotions through dramatic visualisation and feel the speed though the color. You don't have to have synesthesia to admire and enjoy this film (but it just might help).",1486252800,2,995,4.790697674418604

4493411,4,B004XAM0Q0,"Redline is definitely for a older audience and it really represents everything anime is. It is visually unique, sounds great and doesn't take itself too serious, but because of that it is some what lacking in the plot dept and it wasn't funny enough to cover that weakness up. To be fair this anime film does not consider itself to be a comedy, but a science fiction auto racing.

Regardless, I can't excuse it for that because the characters were interesting, but the romance seemed weirdly forced. Btw, there is a topless nudity scene, but there is nothing to whine about. This anime is for adults.

I recommend renting it 1st before buying. I don't have this feeling of wanting to watch it again unless it is with someone who hasn't seen it yet or I want to share my blu ray copy with them. Which you definitely have to buy the blu ray copy to enjoy the visuals. Don't get me wrong, this is something you should definitely watch once before resting in peace.",1478217600,,961,4.485714285714286

The races are balls out psychedelic with no rules other than winning.

And really, when it comes down to it, that's all you really need to know. Who cares that it the main guy, Sweet JP, who went to prison for his best friend. His best friend put his soul up for sale so  that JP could race. Who cares that you get to see how interplanetary travel works in coach.

They were right!

Man, this movie is slick, cool, amazingly animated (Ghibli has amazing animation, but could learn from this!), and only somewhat lacking in story (a kinda flat ending, but whatever!).  Imagine a crazy space race with diverse set of characters that are sometimes tropes of other anime, incredible speeds, a planet that doesn't want the race to take place, and racers who just DGAF for anything except speed and winning.

I really think you should watch this.  I'm going to be watching it again soon to catch things I missed the first time!

It does that thing where there is this huge unexplored universe that seems so alive and interesting but it just sort of sits just below the surface. It leaves a lot of room for interpretation in that regard.

4493476,4,B004XAM0Q0,"Every five years an illegal inter-galactic race called the Redline takes place, and the location for the race is always revealed at the last minute. The race features super-powered cars with drivers who will do anything to win, and that includes blowing away all competition... Literally. The preliminary race called Yellowline has taken place, and despite a malfunction, Sweet JP still managed to qualify for the Redline. He must race against the toughest competition, plus race against a girl by the name of Sonoshee he has grown a liking to under very hostile conditions. -summary

It's sad when you think about it. Redline had been in development for a few years, and for reasons I don't remember had been constantly pushed back. There were rumors that it was eventually being scrapped. It's very unfortunate this gem almost didn't see the light of day, when one takes under consideration the usual unimaginative tripe that for some reason not only finds an actual release but also numerous re-releases. Thankfully, there are production companies out there such as Studio Madhouse that still kick out decent to above average anime titles once in awhile. Redline directed by Takeshi Koike, is a sci-fi racer that for the most part is style over substance, but it's actually done right in delivering a high-octane, fast paced, and exhilarating anime experience. Titles like these make being an anime fan worthwhile.

 Koike has indeed been around the block, most notably working around Yoshiaki Kawajiri (Wicked City,Cyber City) and it does show. Redline bares many different influences but it has its own unique flair to it. I really don't like using this line, but I really haven't seen anything quite like it before. This anime is indeed something different in terms of style. It doesn't even feel like traditional anime, and for some of the more well rounded fans that will be a bad thing, but I doubt the fans who go ga-ga over everything anime will even notice it.

 The production values are the talk here for sure; the animation which appears to be hand-drawn and completely free from CG has a very beautiful, yet zany look that kind of reminds me of Dead Leaves. The character designs possess a detailed variety you don't normally see in anime. There are literally thousands of different species from aliens to anthropomorphic animals, with very little reuse of character designs and they are well integrated into the backgrounds with a good amount of movements. The only human looking characters would be the two leads, Sweet JP and Sonoshee. JP's retro look is also one of the cooler features as his beefed up Trans-Am reflects his personality. The animation can probably best be described as chaotic-awesomeness. The races and battle scenes are so incredible and they're moving at a break neck speed with great fluidity. It's like watching a cross between F-Zero and Wipeout. This anime is exploding with so much style I can't even think of anymore words to describe it. The techno-dance soundtrack compliments the madness perfectly, and I was gripped from the very beginning when these super-powered monstrosities for cars were first introduced. I also have to give credit to the voice acting for the English cast which I enjoyed the most. The small amount of profanity tossed out there meshed very well with the personality of the anime.

 I found the initial story that sets off the chain of events to be interesting in regards to the brazen sponsors of the Redline race. Completely without permission, they're broadcasting the race on the authoritarian military planet of Roboworld, despite the President's promise that if they race there he's going to blow them away. The plot is rather thin but not as bare-bones as some would have you believe. It seems to focus a lot more on character development, and Koike tries to develop too many characters in which I think he does succeed; along the way, he also fits in the usual government conspiracy in regards to Roboworlds president whom is hiding a weapon of mass destruction. The character interactions, development, a couple of brief fights, and superb visuals makes the plot fairly easy to digest in preparation for the next race. The movie only has two real races, and when looking at the length and just how good they are, I believe two was enough. The only real issue I can think of is this being kind of predictable.

 Redline has its share of fan-service that never gets out of hand. It manages to maintain a consistent tone, which isn't the least bit serious. This anime was put together to be exciting and fun, and in that regard it doesn't fail. The years of experience gained working around other heavyweights indeed worked to Koike's benefit. I hope to see more from him later on.

4493519,4,B004XAM0Q0,"Redline does not suffer from being over ambitious.  I mean that in a good way.  The story telling is tight and kept to something that can be managed in a hundred minutes.  The story primarily revolves around the racer JP, who while talented has been crooked and surrounds himself with some questionable friends.  I will not say much because beyond that it would be a spoiler.  Sonoshee is given a fair amount of time as well, she plays into the plot as well.  The other drivers who have advanced to Redline are given enough screen time to establish themselves and be interesting but not sidetrack the film.  The director, Takeshi Koike, struck a perfect balance.

The plot slows down a tad in the middle as the racers prepare for Redline, it is not bad but it maybe goes on a bit too long.  However once the big race starts... hold on for dear life because it moves towards a conclusion at an astonishing pace.

What surprised me the most was the various anime styles within Redline.  Each racing team has its own animated style which is married into the film very well.  I saw callbacks to Gatchaman (Battle of the Planets), Cobra and 90's mecha anime... but also more contemporary styling.

What this is is pure adrenaline fueled, after-burning, tongue-in-cheek, jump off your seat, head bopping kick in your ass memorable fun. You will hate it, you will love it, you will not be able to forget it. I can remember how disappointed and disgusted I felt the first time I tried to watch this, a loop-sided sneer on my face as I put it away without finishing it.

Only to keep thinking about it over and over for days and days, the after-images playing behind my eyelids incessantly, as if something had in fact awakened in me.

One the second screening, I got it. It clicked in. Whatever this diabolical piece of animation genius had seeded in my mind had somehow irradiated my brain with it's wicked whisper of blissful perdition. I was trapped. I helplessly watched myself bouncing on my seat to the opening tune, repeating memorable lines, replaying a part here, another later.

You have been warned. This will turn on the Saturday morning cartoon watching kid in you. This will become your new guilty pleasure, right there with Toni Basil's Hey Mickey, and Vive Le Rock. You will wrap this cover so that when your friends come over all they'll see is a documentary on the economics of thirteenth century Estonia instead of your precious little secret, not out of shame, but because they wouldn't understand and their questions will inevitably lead to showing them and that will make you feel like a filthy betrayer of secrets.

They should make an entire movie just about pod-racing!"" then this is the movie for you. As for me, after the 3rd time watching ""Menace"", I just fast-forward through that bit.

In the future, ground cars have become obsolete as a mode of travel, but they are still raced for entertainment.  JP is a racer who gets paid by organized crime to put on a good show, but deliberately lose races.  He has just thrown the Yellowline race, which is the qualifying event for the Redline race.  The native cyborgs object to the Redline being held on their planet, and have stated they will kill the racers, during the race.  Several of the competitors choose to drop out, bumping JP back up into the competition.  Will he survive, win, or just throw this one, too?

Visually, the animation is top-notch. I've rarely seen better, and for those of you who hate CGI, it doesn't have any. It's fun, thrilling, exciting yadda yadda yadda. The English voice acting is decent. Where the movie fails for me is lack of an interesting plot, clever dialogue, or characters you care about. But hey, if brainless fun floats your boat, have at it. The 3 stars are strictly for the eye-candy alone.

Technical difficulties: I had problems with the menu on my blu-ray player. Perhaps I need a software update.

Parental guidance: the movie has lots of swearing, some brief gratuitous nudity, and violence, so I'd rate it about an R.

This is not high artistic filmmaking.well, maybe it is, but while other artistic films are all about making you think, this is truly a style over substance film. But unlike say a Micheal Bay movie, the extreme explosions and special effects are thought out, careful, and elegant. Its like watching the fireworks display at Disneyland if the fireworks were coordinated by your favorite director.

Beneath the bombast and explosions you do get sincere enough characters. No one is complicated, but none of the characters are exploitative or pandering with the audience (topless scene not withstanding). It will not ruin your palate if you are a story man and it will catch the attention of your friends that do not want to watch Ponyo or Tokyo Godfathers.  Sometimes a film can be art and make you reflect and understand life and your own emotions towards life better. But sometimes a film can be entertainment. A circus rather than a shakespeare in the park. In which case, this circus has all of the elephants yodeling while on giant unicycles while juggling the clowns. It may be insane, it may seem predictable once you get the gist of it, but your eyes are locked on the spectacle..and by god it is hard to make animation a spectacle.",1405123200,11,1388,4.731404958677686

4493579,5,B004XAM0Q0,"IM my life I'm addicted to many many things. (Jesus mainly lol) two of them, are Big American Muscle, and the other Anime. Now these vehicles aren't exactly American muscle, but they are still crazy big A** car things and i love it. Now when it comes to anime, Seinen, romantic comedy, and sic-fi are my thing, its my niche. This anime is heavy on the awesome and the sci-fi, it has its moment for comedy, not much for Seinen but i think its there in a few places, and it does have romance, so ultimately this is 99% of what i want in a movie. (Just add Jesus)

Now as an anime fan I am loyal to subs, very rarely do my friends find me watching a dub. I loved Sword Art Online, Attack on Titan, Guilty Crown, The World God only Knows, Psycho Pass, and Darker than Black. I refuse to watch their english dubbed versions. Now there are a few special cases were the english dubs were better than the subtitled versions, kinda like Drangon Ball Z, Full Metal Alchemist, Hellsing, Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, and you might be able to fit Clannad, Samuria Champloo and baka and test into that column, maybe even Akira if you're a Bosh Fan (I happen to be) but i still liked the subs for Akira.

What does this all mean? Well since an anime is usually made for the Japanese dialect/language, and since japan has about 10x more voice actors and bands than America probably has, it allows the directors and the Original Authors to get their work into the exact form they want it, were as in america we're kinda out of luck and have to interpret things (it doesn't always work.) In this case I feel Redline was very well interpreted, I also feel like the directors wanted this Anime Movie to be dubbed as well. Again I love subs , but with the orgasmic bliss you receive from just the sheer artwork, I think you will get my attitude and decide you want to see the pretty pictures rather than read stupid words.

Redline was very well handled in terms of dubs just like a Miyazaki movie. I think even a Subb fan will be impressed by what went into this movie. So if you haven't guessed yet I prefer the english dubbed version of this movie. The movie Redline astonishingly took about 8 years to make and you can feel it as you watch, this was an anime were they draw the frames like the old stuff from the 90's (true animation). Yet remarkably its in 1080p and rolls at about 60-65fps. Crazy! All of it was drawn, it really shows what people can do, rather than drawing a frame and having the computer move it for you, everything was done by hand and it is nothing less than extremely beautiful. I can't say enough about this move, other than it is fantastic and i hope you love it too.

There is a lot of heart and soul in this move and whether you're an anime fan or not I think you will enjoy this movie. There is a bit of nudity but only for a few seconds, the rest of the movie is just you drooling. Thanks for reading, and get it while you can!",1400630400,,2933,4.241502683363149

The animation is superb; stylized and at times bizarre; heavy lines and bright colors, unusual characters. Just a sci-fi story about some people who love racing cars and the no-holds-barred, balls-to-the-wall, lawless racing event called Redline. I'm not into racing cars, at all. It gave just enough about the cars themselves to be interesting, but not enough to be about racing cars, if that makes any sense. You get just a little bit of back story about the main characters, which adds some depth to already charismatic leads. It's a simple and predicable story, it's true, but there's plenty of action and it moves right along without stopping too long on any one element. A bit of detail here and there add a bit of intrigue. I'm not really sure why you would dislike this movie unless maybe the animation style is too weird for you, or you just had the wrong idea about it.

Side characters have there own (apparently untold) stories that make for funny side plots.

Now I am not saying it's bad, it's just you have to go in with your mind turned off and you will enjoy it. Especially, the mind blowing color spectrum that this movie is offering is just unreal. The Universe that ""REDLINE"" is offering to show audience is also very interesting and weirdly awesome to watch, I mean there is alien K9 bikers, humanoid android, and other wildly imaginative aliens of all sort. So all in all what I am trying to saying is that I really enjoyed the movie and I would recommend it to all. Thanks for the read.",1389398400,,724,4.215827338129497

Hand drawn over multiple years of hard work and labor from the studio culminates in an eyegasm of lustful and rich imagery that would make any fan of anime and/or racing movies pleased.

My only - and I mean ONLY complaint about the movie is the male lead's English dubbed voice. From a purely nitpicky character design standpoint, his English voice does't seem to match the character's look. But, that's not reason to avoid experiencing and sharing this film.

4493639,5,B004XAM0Q0,"(WARNING: SPOILER ALERT)Only read the first bit if you haven't seen the movie yet.

I like this movie, and I'm surprised that people don't like it or are even bashing it like it's the worst anime in the world. Everyone is different...hell I have a friend who is in love with High School Musical...I honestly don't care because she's her own person. Not every anime is for everyone I'm going to buy this movie because I'm a sucker for good animation. This movie is really impressive in that aspect. Along with the animation I just have to say that the plot is not nearly as bad as people are suggesting.
I guess what I'm trying to say is...this move isn't for everyone so go borrow it from Netflix or watch it on Youtube before you buy it.

This movie had characters that a person could seriously relate to, Sonoshee's dream is to race in Redline...since most people missed it I'll explain how this is really relateable. If you participate in any sport and take it very seriously than you can understand the longing to reach the top, espcially in individual sports. This is the relateability that I'm getting at. As for JP's story...I understand the disappointment. He's basically a buffoon chasing a girl around and trying to prove himself by racing along side her. Though this may be pretty lame...people in the real world do it all the time and it really humanizes the character...Sure you have a main character who is a love struck punk with an added passion for his sport, but I think that's really what adds to his character. He's basically just your average Joe...just like almost every male on this planet, he's just a guy. As for the futuristic setting and lack of back story regarding it's existence, I like the way you have to pay close attention and figure things out on your own. Your brain has got to think fast in order to truly understand the setting in it's entirety. The more you pay attention the more you will understand. I think any good movie should have that aspect. A good example (Feeding of the remark made by D. Thomas) I'm pretty sure the cars have some sort of futuristic four wheel steering (But it's only an assumption). These are futuristic cars, who's to say they can't make 90 degree turns? I mean hell, Sonoshee's car didn't even have wheels.",1374796800,,2276,4.58968058968059

I follow Takeshi Koike pretty well, and his directing is one of a kind. What also makes this video stand out is the amazing English voice-overs. Normally, I dislike or even hate them, but this has to be one of the better dubs out there in the entire anime market. This movie definitely deserves more attention then what it currently gets.

The animation style is a bit different from your standard 'anime' movie, but that just adds to the uniqueness of this masterpiece.

To top it all off, the english voice cast is actually pretty good. I watched it with both subs and dubs. The Japanese voice cast is great of course, but it's nice to watch this movie in English as well.

4493663,4,B004XAM0Q0,"Redline is most easily defined as a Sci-fi racing movie, but there are many more elements to it than just that.

The Redline is a race where the best drivers go to show their skills and win fame and fortune.  The story follows one of these racers, J.P., through his quest to become the champion.  The plot is simplistic, yet engaging.  J.P. is a likeable main character but is nowhere near the only character a viewer may want to root for.  From the lead up to the race, through until the end, the movie gives insight into each team in the race and their motivations for winning.

The characters in the movie are varied and unique:  Aliens, criminals, robots, and beautiful women are examples of the people gunning to win the Redline.  Each team's vehicle has its own strengths and weaknesses and the race has somewhat of a Hanna-Barbera's Wacky Races feel to it, although without the accompanying comedy.  This movie is not for children.

The movie's greatest strength is its animation.  The cels are all hand drawn (over 100,000 of them) and are stunning.  This movie is as much a vehicle to showcase the slick animation as it is to forward the plot.  If you are a fan of hand drawn animation, you will be excited to see this movie.  Some of the character designs are far from normal, but they are compelling and rather unique.  This movie took seven years to make and you can see why in the detail of the animations.

The soundtrack is, for the most part, a collection of upbeat dance music tracks that complement the fast, adrenaline fueled racing that pervades this movie.  I've watched this movie both with the original Japanese voice acting track with subtitles and the English language dub.  While I think that the voice acting in the Japanese language track is better (specifically the main character's voice which was much less subdued than the English counterpart), fans who enjoy watching movies with the English dub won't be disappointed in the voice acting.

If you are a fan of beautiful animation, high octane race movies, or science fiction in general, I don't think you will be disappointed by Redline.  It gives the viewer all of these things and more.  If you're the kind of movie watcher that needs a complex plot to enjoy, this might not be to your liking.",1364428800,2,2278,4.645
4493664,5,B004XAM0Q0,"This is one of my favorite anime movies. It's about race cars. Honestly, I thought it was completely weird before watching it. It reminded me of Speed Racer.

After watching it, I have only but good things to say. The plot was fast, quick, and really simple. The characters were vibrant, and the animation was absolutely amazing.

If you like anime, watch this one! It's a work of art!

(Pro)
All hand drawn.  No CG.  (CG is not necessarily bad, but there is something different about hand-drawn pictures)
Took 7 yrs to complete (thought I should mention it)
Pretty good sound track
A VERY simple, but charming storyline
Lovable (or unforgettable) characters.
Extremely individualistic (distinctive) drawings.

(Con)
Some people may find the drawings repulsive.
Not complex. This is no Dark Knight.

(In Sum)
Surprisingly good. I am from Japan and tired of those mass produced animes that feel like cheap clones of the originals (how many Gundam animes have there been?  Or how often do you see those girls with huge eyes fighting monsters? )  Redline was a challenge to the today's Japanese anime culture that produced those cheap clones.  They succeeded.

4493673,5,B004XAM0Q0,"Speed Racer ain't got nuthin' on this one! Animatrix director Takeshi Koike spent a good seven freakin' years putting this movie together, which was done entirely in hand-drawn animation using over 100,000 drawings in its production. It was a staggeringly dedicated task put forth in today's totally digital world using mostly CGI animation.

Set way in the future, JP is an underdog racer in the highly dangerous world of intergalactic car races. After crashing in the preliminary Yellowline race, he luckily gets into the prestige Redline race which is the Indy 500 of the universe. This race is taking place on Roboworld run by a fascist government of cyborg pricks. They don't want these Wacky Racers rejects on their planet, mostly because it might reveal a lot of their military secrets exposed to the public. JP hopes to woo fellow racer Sonoshee, who is someone he's admired since he was a kid, but this keeps him distracted from his double-dealing mechanic Frisbee who is making deals with the mob to rig the race. The big race finally happens, and the big contender, Machinehead, leads the pack, along with several other colorful racers(most of which they only briefly touch on as far as their backstories). Roboworld's military pulls out all the stops(aside from a freakin' blockade!), including particle beam satellites and a giant bioweapon named Funky Boy, that is like an out of control pure energy version of Tetsuo from Akira when he got all bloated. It takes one of the Roboworld's generals to merge with another bioweapon to try and stop Funky Boy, but the movie just leaves off as their big kaiju fight begins. Without giving away the ending, the winner(s) is/are pretty obvious, but the final stretch to the end is nailbiting!

What this movie lacks a little in as far as story is concerned(specifically the unresolved characters' story arcs), it completely makes up for in style and animation. Madhouse comes through again with a real trailblazer. There was a short ""pilot"" movie that came out about four years prior that was just a excellent, and available on the American release as a bonus.

4493674,5,B004XAM0Q0,"Many other reviews have done a great job of explaining just why Redline is something of a must-see, so I'll just throw in a few words on the matter myself. Every once in a few years an animated movie comes along that's sheer originality, energy, and sense of immersion serves as a reminder of how great the medium can be, including to people who usually aren't especially into animated films. Redline is one of these. Redline is one of the most thoroughly enjoyable and exciting movies I've seen in long time. It's the sort of movie the appeal of which is hard to explain; ""Racing cars on an alien world with explosions and colors"" isn't likely to get to many people willing to watch it with you. Really, it's one of those films that you have to say to your friends ""just trust me,"" and stick the disc in. This is what I've done every time I've shown Redline, and whatever skepticism people have tends to disappear in seconds as the adrenaline-cranking wildly creative first race bursts on to the screen with it's pulsating techno beat, full of insane and inventive alien characters. And the attention never wanes. One of the best things about the entire movie, and the reason why the ridiculous action is so effecting, is that each and every character in the huge cast is unique and strangely lovable. They each get their moments to shine in their own peculiarities, and while Redline is far from deep in a very self-aware way, the characters shine through like a beacon. The result of the  crazy inventive animation, literally edge of your seat racing, and strangely lovable characters really is one incredible film that I frankly don't see myself getting tired of watching anytime soon.
Do yourself a favor, and watch Redline.",1358380800,2,1729,4.706270627062707

4493683,5,B004XAM0Q0,"[POSSIBLE SPOILERS FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET!!]

The first thing that you'll notice when you start watching this movie is the eye catching visuals. It is beyond what words can define. At first it might look like it was made on computer. But its not. Yes, the whole thing took over 7 years to draw with artists drawing each frame individually. Considering the amount of things happening on the screen at any given moment, its beyond my belief that how in the world they actually managed to do that. I mean this looks even better than Akira and even now by today's standards, Akira is no slouch when it comes to hand drawn Animation.

But it seems like they put so much effort into the animation that they forgot to put a decent coherent story to assist the gorgeous visuals. I mean its not bad, its just could have been better and the characters could have been more developed. The story revolves around the titular RedLine, a dangerous winner takes all Race that is held every five years. The main character, JP, a happy go lucky with one strange strange hairstyle ends up qualifying for the race, despite failing to finish the qualifying race for the Redline. There's a possible love interest in the form of Sonoshee, who JP knows from his early years but she for some strange reasons doesn't remember him at all. There's your usual bunch of anime archetype characters, the gruff with a heart of gold mechanic, the evil scheming government officials, the tough but respectable rival racer and the list goes on and on.

But that's not the point. The point is the race itself and boy its something. Its Twisted Metal on Steroids. The car designs are very original and downright strange. From a female transformer-esque robot/car to bug shaped vehicles, its pretty wild. Only the main character's car actually resembles a car.

Another aspect of the story that gives the movie so many opportunities of mayhem is the fact that the race is being held on a planet ruled by a military government and they don't want their secrets to be revealed. So they basically throw their entire might to stop these racers. From planes to biker robots to another Akira-esque monster. Heck, there's even a scene where a giant orbital laser beam is used to destroy the aforementioned monster. (Wait, am I reviewing Akira or Redline?)

I've seen it both on Blu-Ray and on DVD and if you're thinking of buying it, go with the Blu-Ray option if you can. The visual fidelity is far superior than to that of the DVD and well, it just looks really really good. There aren't much in terms of special features, besides an hour long making of. Which isn't as interesting as you might think. Its basically the writer and the director talking to each other about how the movie came out to be and what took so long. I mean its nice but you wish you could see more, like the animation process, how the voice dubbing worked etc. But that's just me.

So that's about it really. Its a very simple to watch and understand movie with some of the best visuals you'll see for a long time and i'll say this, American animation studios should really take a look at this and see where they are going and where Japan is going in terms of sheer visual style. Amazon has it for $14.99 which isn't a very bad price if you were skimping out on it due to the price. A well worth movie to showcase that new HD TV that you just bought on Black Friday :D.",1354320000,,3410,4.509708737864078

Redline is a futuristic film about a group of racers competing in the Redline race, a highly dangerous event held only once every five years. By the end, you get to know  JP, Sonoshee, and each of others in the eclectic cast of characters and why they are racing. No questions are left unanswered. The end is satisfying (if cliched). The animation is astounding, especially when you realize this movie has absolutely no CG images in it's entirety.

In all honesty, the only thing that left me hanging was where the hell the giant, mutant love-child between a caterpillar and a millipede came from.

Anyway Redline is a very mediocre movie. the voice acting isn't great and the story is kinda lame it felt to bare bones I felt like there was something I missed like this movie was a sequel to something which obviously meant piss poor character development.

You have girls, you have racing, gratuitous and totaly unnecessary violence and crazy stuns that are done for sheer craziness.  I liked it a lot.

I am no expert, but I have seen enough anime to be able to tell you that this is one of the finest animations to be produced so far, in the technical sense.

Now....the storyline/plot/character designs were, in my opinion, not up to par with the animation skills shown.  The character designs were very weird looking and kind of disgusting.  The storyline tended to the action-comedy type, which I do not favor per se.  (I was expecting something more akin to action-sci fi-dark humor, instead).

----------------------------------------

**Brief Review Of Anime**

Bought this from FYE for 9.99, marked down from 22.95!!!  Quite a deal.  I have been wanting to watch this for some time and now I finally have.

Do you have to like racing to like this Anime?  No, in fact I HATE racing.  I have never watched Nascar in my life.  And I live in West Virginia, where Nascar and beer are almost prerequisites to live here, that and 'Dukes of Hazard'.  No, my reader you do not have to like racing to like this movie.  You do though have to be a fan of Anime, as this is one of the more stranger ones...

**Some Spoilers Ahead**

The film centers around ""Sweat JP"", a human racecar driver.  He is one of the few humans in the movie.  The rest of the characters are aliens, cyborgs, etc.  While all other racers drive weird things, like rocket cars, hover-crafts, and robots, Sweat JP drives a trans-am.  Wow those things really hold up... It's actually neat to see one normal looking vehicle in the movie.

The racing in the movie is like watching 'Death Race' meets 'Speed Racer', while droping acid.  When Sweat JP starts to go really fast the screen will stretch and distort.  This movie is quite a trip to watch, and I was sober when I watched it.  I can only imagine what watching it drunk would be like.  I'll try that on my 2nd watch of it.

Anyway, by a stroke of luck JP is eligable to enter the Redline, the most ruthless race in the galaxy.  Taking place on Roboworld, the race is practically suicide, Roboworld vows to kill all racers who come to the planet.

Sweat JP has more problems than this though.  He and his partner are in debt to the mafia and JP routinely throws races in order that the mob can place fixed bets and win big.  So not only does he have the cyborgs of Roboworld riding his ass, he also has the space mafia on his back like a monkey as well.

The film only gets stranger from here.  Funkyboy, a toxic weapon of some kind breaks out causing havoc.  This coupled with many other things make the race quite an edge on your seat experience.

--Pros--

Good animation.  Racing is actually exciting to watch, not dull at all.  Some fan service for the guys.  Sonoshee, a female racer, is topless for like 5 minutes, tee-hee...

--Cons--

Fan service.  While I like a naked lady as much as the next guy, this scene was totally out of place.  No reason why she's watching tv naked, she's just doing it.  This kind of knocks a film/movie down a peg when this stuff happens.

Weird factor.  Funkyboy, the cosplay racers, machinehead, the list goes on of weird things in this movie.  Eventually you just have to accept you are watching one of those weird Animes and quit trying to figure things out.

I personally thought Sweat JP's hair looked stupid.  He looks like Brad Pitt from 'Johnny Suede'.  That's not a good look.

--In Conclusion--

Really good Anime.  I plan to give this a 2nd view very soon.  While this Anime is weird at times, it does stay on track and delivers quite a thrilling ride for us the viewers.

Is it worth buying?  Yes, I say it is.  But this is a hardcore Anime, so if you are not into Anime, or have just dabeled in it, you make not like it.  This film is going for a decent price on Amazon right now.  If your near an FYE, check there, it could still be on sale for 9.99 new!!!

Well, that's my thoughts.  Now if you'll excuse me I am going to go buy myself a trans-am and start street racing.  On second thought I'll just watch 'Redline' again...",1340150400,2,3794,4.4273255813953485
4493705,5,B004XAM0Q0,"it comes in a simple case that only has the movie, but what else where you buying? its simplistic packaging takes nothing away from how epic of a movie this is. on blu-ray it looks amazing and buying any less would put all the efforts to draw each cell of this movie to waste. this movie is good and worth the price.",1338854400,,316,4.112903225806452

4493708,5,B004XAM0Q0,"I love me some anime. I have since I was a teen. My love and appreciation for the genre has only grown and as much as I love it, I'm often disappointed by the lack of feature films that come out. Don't get me wrong, I love a good series, but sometimes I don't want to commit months to watching something. Sometimes I just want a quick fix. Anchor Bay and Manga Entertainment have provided me a much need anime injection of goodness with ""Redline."" It is an amazing film and a testament to dedication. Taking seven years to complete and 100, 000 hand made drawings, in the age of computer animation, director Takeshi Koike brings us the insane, over the top, and completely awesome ""Redline""

With fun characters, breakneck speed, and music that will get your head nodding, this film is just plain awesome. I mean it's rare that I'm completely blown away by something but this did it. When you see it the fact that it was hand drawn will not be wasted. It looks beautiful. This was a really fun and good anime, with lots of cool charatcers, and just has a very cool vibe about it. The music is catchy and will have youtapping your toe to the beat as you sit on the edge of your seat watching the insane races. I really don't have anything bad to say except I wish there were more races within the film, but hey I'll take what i can get. It's a crazy fun ride I intend to take again an again.

The art is fantastic!  It makes the look of the show raw and energetic and is very much befitting the topic of racing; it's awesome eye candy here.  The story was pretty good too; I would say the story follows the pacing of a summer block buster movie, it's fast paced, not really any slow moments in the story telling.  I mean that as a compliment. The dubbing of this was great, I had no problems with accepting the voice actors to the characters.

Before watching this I read several articles saying that this entire movie was hand drawn without using the aid of computers and is likely to be one of the last films ever to do that. I also read that because it is hand drawn, it took 5+ years for it to come out. It definitely shows.

The characters are NOT original, and though they feel familiar when compared to most anime archetypes the movie does offer some hidden character dimensions that later unveil as the story progresses.  It is a racer movie - simple and plain.  But the beauty of this ride lies in the method with which the story is given - completely imaginative, not just in style but in technical delivery.

Man, you are a damn lie. Just read your review and it's so wrong it's not funny. Right off the bat I could tell you who did it without even knowing his name, the director who did Kawajiri's World Record on the Animatrix DVD, only this movie, which did have a hell of a lot of color, had almost zero plot and the art, to tell you the truth, wasn't as good as World Record.

To compare this to the live action Speed Racer is a nuclear overstatement to say the least. I will give this movie an official review of my own when I watch it again. This will be my third time watching it btw, not because it's all that but because the first time I fell asleep on it and the second time I didn't know what the hell was going on, besides the fact that some Spike Spiegel ripoff (Spike is the main character in Cowboy Bebop) with an Elvis 'do is on papers (probation) and is racing to stay out of jail. Of course he drops the F-bomb repeatedly and in between he's combing his retarded looking bouffant, like that's supposed to be ""cool"" or something or make me not feel so bad for plunking down 24 bucks for it. There's even a little fan service courtesy of a tit shot in the middle and a really empty could-have-seen-it-coming-a-mile-away throw in boy/girl romance rivalry.

To compare this to Akira is shamelessly promoting this little ignorant anime. Honestly, I didn't think Akira had the best writing or story. The writing, particularly the dialogue, was downright ugly. But what made Akira so great for me was the density, the information packed in each scene and its overall consistency throughout.

Artwise, Redline starts off with a bang and in the middle scenes there's a very noticeable dropoff, like off a cliff, in the quality and detail of the art. This is a decent anime at best, mediocre when compared to the likes of Ghost in the Shell, Paprika, Patlabor, Akira, Ninja Scroll, Wings of Honneamise, etc. A better comparison to this film is Dead Leaves, both hyper and very very loud. Imo, this director did a better job with World Record this may be due to the fact that he didn't write it.

What I think now:

I guess the 3rd time's a charm because this anime is great. All the comparisons to Akira had me comparing it to that film; the 3rd time I saw Redline enabled me to judge it on its own and I agree with the hype: this anime is all that and much much more.

It's refreshing to see an anime that revels in being what it is, animation. Nowadays, almost no animator, with the exception of an endangered few, have the guts to keep humans in the loop, to actually hand-draw animation instead of jumping on the CGI 3D bandwagon. It's all mixed up: cartoons use CGI to look more real and live action films use it to make real actors look cartoonish. By deliberately eschewing these gimmicks, Redline goes back to the essence of why, as a 44 year old, I still enjoy these films as I did as a kid: they're just fun to look at. Pure escapism. In animation, I'm not looking for ""real life."" I'm not looking for a cartoon that ""looks real"" as much as I'm not looking for a live action film that make actors look and behave like cartoon characters. Redline is as close to reading a comic book as you can get, only it's a moving, living comic book alive and vibrating with the wildest palette this side of Akira and when I say animation I mean ANIMATION; everything in this film is moving, everything, even little creatures and details in the background you can barely see.

There is a decent plot here, not great, but this isn't what I expect from such a title nor will I describe what's described here many times over. It's fun. It's very detailed. Most of all, it's a comeback for Japanese anime imo. Like Akira, blood, sweat, and tears drip off of every shot of this film. Nothing compares to hand-drawn animation when it's done right like this film does. Animation's at its best when it acts as a supercharger instead of a copycat to reality. This anime reminds me of the type of old school animation made by the likes of Yoshiaki Kawajiri, particularly his short film ""Running Man.""

Like I said, changed my mind. Instant classic!",1330300800,,4155,4.428010471204188
4493719,1,B004XAM0Q0,"Such a bad movie, can't believe I had so much hype for that. Everything in this movie was terrible from the beginning to the end, only the animation was worth watching, I could put this movie in Russian with Vietnamese subtitle and it wouldn't change a thing because the story is so bad that it isn't even worth trying to understand wtf you are watching. I wish I could put -5 Stars.",1329609600,5,383,4.333333333333333
4493720,5,B004XAM0Q0,"This movie is one of my new favorites as far as over the top action goes.  The animation is of the highest quality and full of great color and detail, pretty much the reason why I own a blu ray player in the first place.  The movie makes me think of a mashup of the game F-Zero with the animes FLCL and Gurren Lagann, except it was produced by Madhouse and not Gainax.  Imaginative, fast paced, even hilarious at times, and an explosive intensity that you can nearly feel through the cars and in the characters' expressions as they hit the nitro (even more if you have  surround sound).  The English dub is very well done and I thought the actors fit their characters' roles and energy perfectly.  Full of alot of recognizable voices from the industry for those who are familiar with it.  Does have some R rated language throughout, which I love seeing in an animation as long as it fits the mood (which it does in this movie...like a glove).  It's movies like this one that got me into watching animation in the first place with its vivid and quirky sci-fi style.  If you're like me, just watching the trailer will give you an idea if you'll like it or not.  I'm glad that my expectations were met on this one.",1329523200,2,1211,4.366071428571429
4493721,5,B004XAM0Q0,"I'm not going to write a review about this movie that talks about how sheer video quality and the degree of animation make this movie 5 stars, sure they are great, but I am going to write about why I think people should watch this movie. I think anyone who is a fellow racer like myself can enjoy this movie. It truly capture the feelings that go through you mind just before a race and shows how after a race begins everything is unpredictable and that the racer must learn to compensate for those events. I'm not saying that this film a summary of a real race...no it is a movie and it never tries not to be, but it truly shows you what racing is and how every person is involved in racing for a different reason.

So if you want to see an awesome movie about racing complemented with non-stop action and a bunch of explosions in a crazy mechanized future watch this movie  .",1329350400,,877,4.245508982035928
4493722,5,B004XAM0Q0,"I can't believe it took this long to get to America but thank god it actually got here, and in Blu-Ray. This movie is such an amazing, breathtaking accomplishment of modern Japanese animation that it makes it a must-see for anyone looking to see something new and exciting.

The animation style is a seriously stylish mix of Samurai Champloo (the director was an animator for it), Heavy Metal, Speed Racer, J-pop neon color, F-Zero. This is the first anime I think I've seen that has a clear homage to American animation influences like Heavy Metal and Speed Racer, also to American Rock music (JP's hair is clearly Elvis-style). But what it does is mix all of this together with the Japanese style in such a cool and, ultimately, unique and visually captivating way.

Since the movie has the advantage of being released in the digital, blu-ray age, we are given a COMPLETE SOURCE transfer. That means absolutely no specs, grains, washed-out colors, etc... This is the cleanest a hand-drawn animation can look without being done on a computer. That's why this movie is such a success. The sheer imagination and heart that went into the artwork makes a greatly convincing argument for the beauty and potential of hand-drawn artwork that has completely been absent from American animation.

The music is the next best part. It starts out with the main anthem, ""Yellow Line"" and gets into the action right away with about an 8-minute race opening that right away captures the awesome feel that the rest of the movie will throw at you.  It captivates the tone and emotions at the right points and even gets a little touching at some points as there is a small amount of melodrama to keep this movie from being without any depth, not that it's totally needed but it's a nice touch. The music captures that Redline has this soulful heart to it that you just latch on to.

The story itself is not complex, but that's good because is if it got TOO convoluted in talking then we couldn't really enjoy the limits of animation that this movie pushes so well. The melodrama with JP and with himself and Sonoshee it makes the movie come together in the end that brings out the heart of the creators and staffers on the project that just makes this film special. I'm so happy this movie came out because I was really starting to mourn the end of Japanese animation, especially with the loss of Satoshi Kon. This movie has a soul and that makes it so much more necessary to witness.

That brings me to my only complaint. The dubbing in English was done by Manga Entertainment. That means the dub was given a ""typical anime"" dub in English. While JP, Sonoshee, and Frisbee's voices are all fine there are other voices that are awkward and too anime that distracts from the universality of the animation. In Japanese, the voices are less cartoonish and more realistic, which makes the movie much better and more in line with the creator's vision. Thankfully, the English and Japanese tracks are both True HD so you can choose which one you like.

Bottom Line: Get Redline. It's beautiful. It's inspirational. It's great. These animators deserve the money for making such an amazing work of art. It doesn't matter whether or not you like anime, this isn't an ""anime"" it's a Japanese animation and appeals to a wider swatch of people. It's exciting and the movie just goes by so quick because of how awesome it is. BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!",1328918400,2,3419,4.678868552412646
4493723,4,B004XAM0Q0,"The beginning moments of this snime and I was only impressed by the high definition source as the rest just wasn't registering or they simply hadnt showed the wow factor yet, this was because my brian or taste hadnt adjusted to the viewtiful joe style cel shading.. Once it all processed in my brain and the story and action started in full effect it clicked and I was hooked and more then happy to fniish the anime. This anime has moments that are jaw dropping and the visual style quickly works its way into your heart. But do me one favor..Please for the love of god stop making AKIRA comparisions..Very misleading in every sense of the word... Only thing that might have been AKIRA-esque would be some of the BIO weapons in a breif portion of the film.

This anime takes you on one Hell of an ADRENALIN ride from begin to end. The style in which it is drawn reminds Me of a lot of anime's like Aeon Flux, Heavy Metal, Akira. The storyline is amazing how it unfolds and is not just thrust right into your face with no time for all the individual characters stories like a lot of anime's these day's.

4493726,5,B004XAM0Q0,"If Amazon would let me just put a one word review, I'd leave this as ""Perfect"".

Every few years there is a critical point at which an Anime is released that just blows your mind or serves as the gateway drug for a whole new generation of Anime fans. Red Line is that movie now.

I cannot find a single flaw with this film. Everything from the first scene all the way to the dang credits is Epic. I read that it took 7 years to make this film and it shows... in the good way. It's as if the creators looked at every minute detail and finely honed them to perfection. The animation is gorgeous, fresh, and unique. The English voice acting is dead on and engrossing. The sound track and effects are mind blowing. The characters are deep and interesting. You get the point... it's that kind of movie that you never want to end and all the way to that end you're left with that last bit of suspense and excitement that drives you nuts... again, in the good way.

If you like Anime at all, or think in the slightest bit that you could like Anime, or even if you are just a Sci-Fi or Action fan: Then there is nothing more to say. Buy this movie NOW and watch it.",1328054400,2,1157,4.133333333333334
4493727,5,B004XAM0Q0,"The plot to this movie isn't terribly complicated.  It's your basic grandprix storyline.  You have the hero, some villains, other drivers, and the mob trying to fix the results.  What sets it apart is its execution. This film took seven painstaking years to make, and it can be seen in every frame. I cannot overstress the beauty of the animation.

The characters were all likable. I even found myself cheering for the other drivers at certain points. The best performance came from Liam O'Brien portraying Frisby. This role really shows his range. He can go from a sociopathic killer (Gaara from Naruto) to the lovable Nightcrawler in Wolverine and the X-men. He was surprisingly nuanced for a movie that's basically an R-rated Speed Racer in the future.

The world that it set up was very imaginative. Unlike most SciFi futuristic films, humans are not the majority species. In fact there was no single majority species. This left a lot of room for the animators to be creative with aliens that appear on-screen and in the background.  In all the art style was hat Heavy Metal wanted to be and more.

In short, just watch this film. You will not be sorry.",1327881600,,1157,4.72636815920398
4493728,3,B004XAM0Q0,"I can't say I swallowed the kool-aid on this one.  The animation was like an old comic come to life or like pencil sketches filled in with water color or chalk in a notebook.  It felt purposefully incomplete and/or flat.  I think the animation will appeal to anyone who loved The Animatrix.  The plot/story, what there is of one, is car racing and all that entails from betting, crashes, to fixed races. Enter race.  Win race.  That's it.  Not too taxing or hard to understand.  The race scenes were fun to watch.  There are a lot of ""nationalities"" in Redline which I appreciate.  They were interesting to look at not unlike the bar in Star Wars.  The voice acting led by the fantastic Takuya Kimura is great.  As a fan of anime (and Taku), I'm glad I watched this, but I'd never recommend it to anyone.",1327622400,2,804,4.431506849315069

4493730,5,B004XAM0Q0,"The movie is amazing, nothing I say about it will matter or be incredibly original. There's nothing and I mean nothing out there that looks anything like this. Over 100,000 hand-drawings make up this movie and the fluidity on display surpasses anything the legends at Production IG (Ghost in the Shell, Sky Crawlers), Studio Ghibli (Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away), and even Disney have done. Takeshi Koike and Studio Madhouse went for an all out attack on the senses with this one and the achieve that, and then some. The first 10 minutes of the movie will probably go down as the most action-packed and bat-$%^& intro in all of film. The story is good, but it obviously takes a back-seat because the visuals are what's really impressive.

Moving onto the disc itself, this is the movie that I will be showing off from now on in my home-theater. Anchor Bay and Manga Entertainment spared no expense on this Blu-ray. This is a direct-to-digital transfer of the highest caliber. The black level is deep, no macroblocking, aliasing, or any other abnormality. The AVC encode stays rock solid throughout the presentation and handles the material like a champ. On the audio side, the Japanese and English versions get lossless Dolby TrueHD 5.1 tracks, and like the visuals they don't fail to impress. This whole disc is an amazing demo-disc that will push your home theater to it's limit. And even more impressive is that it's anime and it stands up to Pixar and Criterion discs.

The extras include a trailer from 2006 (and the whole trailer is different animation that never shows up in the movie, but still impresses), a ""Perfect Guide To Redline"" and a ""Quick Guide To Redline"". The guides make-up a good hour and half to two hours of behind the scenes footage. There's some overlap but it's hard to complain when there's so much and it's in HD. The trailer, is sadly not in HD, which to me is a missed opportunity since the animation is still very fluid.

This is a must-have in any animation (not necessarily anime) fan, and if you're on the fence just buy it. Trust me, you won't go wrong with this.",1327622400,,2103,4.693766937669377

The 5 star rating is for how refreshing it was.  I appreciate some greats of anime, but I can admit just the word anime makes me uneasy because its has too many cliche pitfalls...this movie looks and feels so good you don't even care its anime.

If you never liked the feel of speed racer you might not be interested, but give it a test drive just in case... because the art and energy of this film is undeniable.  Yes, it has plenty of crazy and wonderfully japanese themes: like intergalactic war in the future, massive Gojira-like monster fights, and even a sappy love story. At its core though is racing.  This is the craziest over-the-top racing movie, I have ever seen. Its overflowing with mind-numbing colors, art, and sound. Crazy Beautiful.",1327449600,,935,4.782608695652174

The story is great, even though you most likely be paying attention to it during your first watch because the visuals are so stunning. The colors are amazing, the art is gritty yet fluid, and the characters are just plain fun.

The worst part about the movie, is thinking that there most likely won't be another one quite of this magnitude just because hand-drawn animation is so expensive and everyone wants to use computers for everything.

Whether you like American comics, or Japanese comics, or no comics at all, I honestly believe Redline can be enjoyed by anyone and is certainly one of the best films ever made.",1327190400,,860,4.607843137254902
