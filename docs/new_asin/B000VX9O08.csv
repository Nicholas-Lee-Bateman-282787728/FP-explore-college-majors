Good to have these films in one collection. Speaking of leeches, I can't say much about supply and demand, as others have, but the going price is way out of line. Glad I got it in time; I got the last copy at our Best Buy in Milwaukee. Also, DR CYCLOPS is a classic, made in 1940, in color, and the only one in the collection nominated for an Oscar for Special Effects. Indeed, the effects are fine.",1192492800,,551,4.2075471698113205
8220421,5,B000VX9O08,"A message to Michael Chiaro of Lodi,New Jersey who wrote a scathing review on the availability of these box sets. Don't blame Best Buy or the ""vultures"" who are buying these DVD's up to sell at a higher price. Blame Universal for putting out such limited quantities to very popular movies that hundreds of thousands of us across America enjoyed as a child. Can you imagine if Paramount put out 5000 copies of The Godfather? Would that be fair to the hordes of people who love that movie? Absolutley not. So why would Universal put out first 5 incredible Sci-Fi movies like The Mole People, Incredible Shrinking Man, Tarantula in such limited quantities, and now movies like Deadly Mantis and Land Unknown and Dr. Cyclops knowing these movies would sell whether or not they were limited. I understand Michael's anger, however I think it's misguided. It should be aimed at Universal Studios for not making these widely available.",1191456000,3,927,4.8734177215189876

8220423,5,B000VX9O08,"Best Buy stores are sold out because of vampires who have bought these up and then charge 2,3,and even 4 times the price!!! Go directly online to Best Buy or call their 800 number. The SKU number is 8402622. The postage is $1.99; they have it in stock. Then these rip -off dealers can stick their copies where the sun don't shine.",1190678400,7,330,4.338709677419355
