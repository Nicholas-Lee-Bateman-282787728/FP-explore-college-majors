7848951,5,6303499937,"This tape is of a live broadcast from September 14, 1955, by the Theater Guild, of a wonderful play written for the small screen by James Costigan.
Directed by Daniel Petrie, and set in Ireland, the story centers on a day in the life of Shivawn, a 30 year old innocent dreamer, who is domineered by her innkeeper brother (Michael Higgins).
Donald Woods, in a marvelous performance, plays a man with a troubled marriage (Haila Stoddard is excellent as the wife), who gives Shivawn's life new meaning.
As Shivawn, the great Julie Harris is radiant, and as one always expects from Ms. Harris, it's another of her magical performances. She is truly God's gift to the stage.
The video/audio quality is a little fuzzy, but this is an exceptional example of live television, and could be thought of as a historical document of the early days of this medium, and what it was capable of. It's a real play, in our living rooms...it's terrific theater.
The tape is just under one hour, and includes a 9 minute introduction, from 1982, with interviews of Harris (looking gorgeous !), Woods, Costigan, and Merv Griffin, who sings the theme song in the play.",1027728000,2,1144,4.725
