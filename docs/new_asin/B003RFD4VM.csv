4185491,5,B003RFD4VM,"First of all, let me say that the Creature From the Black Lagoon is barely in this.  He comes out near the end of Abbott & Costello's skit.  You see more of Frankenstein than the Gillman.  The good stuff is that the DVD menu has options to watch the whole Colgate Comedy Hour or just the Abbott & Costello segment.  Plus it still has the old commercials in it, which I find interesting.  Abbott & Costello are still funny and had my wife and I cracking up.  I feel like my Abbott & Costello Meet *insert Universal Monster name here* collection is more complete now, other than just having the full length movies.

4185494,2,B003RFD4VM,"The DVD packaging is very misleading, especially to those who don't know that Abbott and Costello never made a full length movie with the Creature From The Black Lagoon. I knew what it probably was since I remember that a company called Sinister Cinema once offered a tape featuring the sketch  and movie trailers with an identical title back in the '90's. On the other hand, it is fascinating  as a history lesson in what was considered a comedy show back in 1954. Besides not understanding the then contemporary references, younger viewers may wonder why so much time is spent on a straight ice skating performance. Will Gene Wesson and his pal make you forget modern comedians? A&C and the Creature ARE on the show, as well as the Frankenstein monster, so that alone may compel you to buy this.",1507852800,,797,4.685714285714286

4185497,1,B003RFD4VM,I love Abbott and Costello a lot!!!! But this is false advertising!! I got my hopes up that there was an Abbott and Costello movie I hadnt seen only to get what I feel as ripped off!! I would have paid $30 if it was a real movie and not a 5 min skit! Beware.... if your looking for a full length movie this is not it!  this is all my disk says......Please eject disk.... playback feature may not be available on this disk.....

4185544,1,B003RFD4VM,"Just a heads up for you: THIS IS NOT A MOVIE!!!

If you're expecting a feature film about Abbott and Costello running into the Creature from the Black Lagoon like they did with The Invisible Man, The Mummy, and Frankenstein...then you're in for a disappointment, This is not that at all.

This is an episode of a variety show called The Colgate Comedy Hour. It features various sketches and they're funny enough on their own, but they're not billed as such. This packaging is VERY deceptive and isn't worth the disc it's burnt on.

TL;DR - They ""meet"" the Creature in the last 30-60 seconds of a 15 minute skit. Lou faints into Bud's arms, and then the curtain closes.

You're better off just watching it on YouTube (yes, it's available to see there).",1503705600,25,751,4.582089552238806

4185547,3,B003RFD4VM,"Be aware that this isn't really a movie but a short skit at the end of a 50s variety show, the Colgate Comedy Hour. The skit is funny, typical Abbott and Costello. The problem with this video is when the name-sake monster finally appears on the screen, you get a bad section of the film just showing black streaks on the screen for about 20 seconds. This would be more interesting for people who enjoy ice skating as they dedicate about half of the show to Sonja Henie. The comedy is dated, will be lost on some. This is an interesting artifact for fans of Abbott and Costello but shouldn't be played up like it is a movie similar to the ...meets Frankenstein, ...meets the Wolfman, etc.",1501718400,11,687,4.417322834645669
8403747,2,B003RFD4VM,"I agree with some of the other reviews. I was so excited about the title that I didn't read the reviews and I should have. The advertising is totally deceptive. This is not a movie featuring a monster. When the menu opens up it reads ""Abbott and Costello Meet the Creature from the Black Lagoon"" on the top but you cannot click on that title to play. It's just words. Below is the Colgate Comedy Hour and Trailers. There is no movie. This experience has taught me to carefully read reviews before ordering. I am very, very disappointed!!

Did people actually think this was going to be a complete show of THE BLACK LAGOON?  The problem  may be with the advertising but buyers should be aware that this is extremely rare and a chance to see Bud and Lou near the end of their career.  Don't buy expecting this to be a monster show.....TV back in those days were not well enough done that they would have time to spend hours in make up for a show that was never intended to be seen again.  Yes, it was a Universal promotion for their newest monster film but more important it was a chance to see two classic comics perform where they did so best....before a life audience.  If you are not a true fan of Abbott and Costello, have to tolerance for viewing a TV show the way I did during the early days of television, unable to laugh at the antics of one of America's greatest comic teams...then don't buy.
