8441602,5,B004UJ3FP4,I absolutely love this movie! It tells the story of a Turkish family coming to Germany during the 60s. The story is told with lots of humor and is just so fun to watch.,1449619200,,168,3.9705882352941178
8441603,5,B004UJ3FP4,"I watched this movie at a college campus at their annual Foreign Language Festival.  Everyone loved this movie, and people remembered it a year later.  We could not find this movie anywhere even though, we tried.  When I came across the movie on Amazon, I wanted to purchase it right away, but worried if I could see it on my DVD.
Fortunately, I have a Blue-ray player which played the movie just fine. Unfortunately, it does not have English subtitles.  It only plays in Turkish or German.

Great movie, shows different cultures with love and understanding.",1396051200,2,558,4.770833333333333
8441604,5,B004UJ3FP4,"I love this movie, so charming and funny and tragic at the same time, perfect comment on the multigenerational immigrant experience - Saw it on a flight with English subtitles, here in America, it's only in Italian, Turkish or German - if you speak any of these languages, go for it - lovely",1381104000,4,291,4.509433962264151
