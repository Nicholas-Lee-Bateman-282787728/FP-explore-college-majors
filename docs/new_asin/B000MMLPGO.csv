2737080,5,B000MMLPGO,"Maburaho is a very enjoyable anime to watch. The animation is very fresh looking and colorful.

By the way this show is NOT for the little ones. (But then again most anime is not.)

Maburaho's storyline is very different and it's cool to see what will happen next.

Very good dub cast IMO.

And the designs of the charcthers are pleasing to the eyes I personally think Kazuki and Yuna are some of the cutest anime charcthers around!(I mean cute in a AWWWWW baby way.)

Overall I'm proud to call myself a Maburaho fan! ^_^",1178496000,,521,4.442105263157894
2737081,5,B000MMLPGO,"I just picked up the complete series collection of Maburaho, and I have to say I am impressed.  Yes, it is another harem anim in the same category as Tenchi Muyo, Love Hina, etc.  But, is that really so bad?

Here is a quick run-down of the plot, in case this review happens to be the first thing you have ever read about Maburaho.  You can skip this paragraph if you already know the plot ^_-  It is a story about a world where EVERYONE can use magic.  Worth and value are placed on people with strong magic.  Even more worth and value is placed on people who can use their magic lots of times (they can tell how many times one has left to use, by using a special magic meter).  Once a person has used up their limit of magic uses, they they turn into ash and (generally) die.  Kazuki, the hero of the show, just so happens to have the strongest magic on the planet.  His ancestors were all ridiculously powerful magicians, and his genes are worth a LOT to some of the most powerful families in Japan.  This leads to most of the girls initial contact with him, they are told by their families to either marry him and breed, or to just breed (depending on the family).  The major problem with all of this, is that Kazuki only has 8 magic uses left before he turns to ash, at the start of the show, and he seems to be burning through them pretty quickly...

So, the story has a lot of heart, and it has characters you can really get behind, and cheer for.  My favorite is Rin, she is just so loveable, you just want to hug her.  Especially when she is being sad because nobody wants to see what her biology club is up to.

I could make strong comparisons to any harem anim with Maburaho, but I will use Tenchi Muyo (because that is another of my favorites).  The main character, Kazuki, is a wuss -- just like Tenchi.  He is shy around women, and will instantly cave to anything to ask of him -- just like Tenchi.  He also has a mysteriously strong inner power (in this case, his magic, and not the power of Jurai) which can overcome darn near anything -- just like Tenchi.  He also has a lot of trouble using his power -- just like Tenchi -- although in his case it is not a matter of learning to make Light Hawk Wings on his own, but instead it is due to the severely limited number of times he can use his magic.  He also has a bad case of ""Knight-on-a-white-horse"" syndrome, and he is constantly trying to save every female around him, who gets into any sort of trouble -- just like Tenchi.

The 3 main girls in the show are Yuna, who behaves a lot like a combination of Aeka and Sasami from Tenchi Muyo.  Rin, who behaves a lot like Ryouko from Tenchi Muyo.  And Kuriko, who behaves a lot like Washu and borrows Mihoshi's busty blond look.

The girls are in no way clones to the girls in Tenchi Muyo.  They all have their own personality quirks, and they all have character aspects that set them apart as their own characters.  Also, overall, once the show really begins to move, the girls are a lot NICER to each other, than the girls in Tenchi Muyo.

I like this show because of the pretty Shonen artwork, the interesting magic aspect, and the heart and personality given to all of the characters, and the amount of comedy and general silliness in the stories.  Yes, it is another harem anim, but I don't see that as a bad thing.",1177977600,49,3335,4.22432859399684
2737082,5,B000MMLPGO,"The premise of the series has been stated elsewhere so I will not go into that. If you like/collect romance comedies then you should find this a decent watch. I purchased this because I found it on sale and reasonable for 24 epsodes but still happy with the purchase. Other reviewers have mentioned ""Love Hina"" plus other titles which may be even better but collectors should get those too! There is no mech, magic is a plot device and Rin is the ony one with a Katana. Maburaho will make you laugh which works for me. All I'm saying is that if you like these type of Anime and skip this, you've missed out.

Spoilers

This series was originally set to be 6 episodes ending with Kazuki's death saving Yuna (ep 12). Kazuki ""the ghost"" was created when the producer decided to expand the series. I wished there were more than 24 but not everything can be ""Ah! My Goddess""

DVD

The collection box only contains the 24 episodes and no other clips.

Happy viewing!",1177804800,4,960,4.462857142857143
2737083,5,B000MMLPGO,"The series revolves Kazuki Shikimori, a kid who is basically a loser, yet in a world where magic reigns supreme, his lineage gives him the genes to give birth to the greatest magician in the world. Word of this gets around to 3 girls inparticular, one adopted to western society, another a business tycoon heir, and the third a traditional japanese family. It's gonna be a ride for Shikimori as all the girls want his genes...

The series I thought had a good story line, even at 24 episodes (600+ minutes), the series could have gone on longer. The animation is extremely well as far as magic designs go and the actual characters themselves, which are very detailed. The series has alot of humor and I found myself laughing through every episode. Music choice for the series also wasn't a bad choice at all. The ending of the series (and I'm putting this cause some think it can affect the entire series) left me hanging to a degree because another question was raised, so to speak, but I was satisfied none the less because it ended the way I hoped it would for the most part.

Although overall I gave the series the 5 star, there are some things that might bother others that didn't bother me. The series does contain alot, and I mean alot, of girls in there underwear, alot of sexual instances, and 2 episodes that contained a brief amount of nudity. Again, this didn't bother me in that, I myself, thought it fit with getting the message across, such as giving in to temptation and showing that Shikimori has the mind of an average 17 year old that likes girls (I think most of us guys can relate).

Overall, I wouldn't get this series for anyone under 14 (as the rating suggest). The language is actually pretty clean, and with the exception of the brief nudity, everything else worked out fine for the series. Overall animation was great, story was excellent, humor is priceless, and I'd watch it all over again. It was money well spent and I'm glad to have it as part of my new collection.",1176076800,9,1997,4.511049723756906
2737084,3,B000MMLPGO,"Where to begin. This is a decent series that would be best viewed by those just getting into this subgenre of anime. It is good as an introduction but it does not really excel. If you find this series to be interesting then I would point you to Tenchi Muyo and Love Hina as those two anime series pull off this genre far better than Maburaho.

Now to the series itself. It is about a loser boy (as in the majority of harem girl animes) who ends up being pursued by a flock of very attractive women (also a staple of the genre). What sets this story apart from all the others is the fact that the girls are after the boy's DNA.

oh yes, the series is set in a world in which everyone is capable of magic and have a certain amount of times they can use it. the higher a person's magical count the higher class they are. The boy only has 8, hence he is a loser. but what sets him apart is that his ancestors were all very powerful magic users. Hence the pursuit of his DNA by the gorgeous women.

This proves to be a very bad thing in my opinion as it gives the impression that the women do not truly care for the boy himself, they just act kind to get what they want. this is a cynical view but it is one that the series presents as an underlying theme even though on the surface the girls seem to show affection for the boy after a while (as is the case with most harem girl animes).

also the series follows the same formula of episodes, meaning you will find the hot spring episode, and other episodes where the boy is pitted with one girl at a time so they can plead their case, and you will come across episodes where the girls all fight with each other. Also there is a lot of fan service in this series. The fan service feels as if it is tacked on just to keep viewers watching instead of being put in as part of the story.

unfortunately, this anime is very much a cookie cutter series from the subgenre. there is nothing that truly stands out to set it apart from all the rest. It doesn't do a fantastic job but at the same time it doesn't completely fall flat on its face like others in the genre (like Girls Bravo, DearS, and Eiken) The series could have been a lot better and achieved some recognition by being truly different by having the boy having more of a backbone as well as realizing that the girls did not truly care about him.

If you want to get into this series then this box set would be the way to go but if you want to get into the genre as a whole, I would highly recomend the Tenchi muyo OAV and Love Hina as the series to collect.",1175817600,5,2558,4.065476190476191
2737093,5,B000MMLPGO,The characters are comedic and easy to give a good laugh.  The plot is a little out there but story is funny and overall enjoyable to watch.,1358208000,,140,4.185185185185185
2737094,4,B000MMLPGO,"Kazuki is wizard, but he can only use his magic 8 times before it kills him. Some of the most powerful magic families in the country find out about his dormant power and send their daughters to get his genes. That's pretty much the story.

This anime isn't very deep, but it's got some really neat characters and good animation. The soundtrack is all right too. Even though the story is pretty regular there are a few touching moments, it also delivers plenty of comedy too. I'm not gonna lie and say it's one of the best animes I've seen; but I'm glad I did see it. It's pretty enjoyable. Maybe check it out on youtube or netflix to see what you think.",1350345600,,653,4.308943089430894

youll enjoy this series and re-watch it time and time again.",1335312000,,468,4.2

2737097,5,B000MMLPGO,"Maburaho is your typical magical-girl anime with the typical loser hero, but the story has a bit of charm to it.

Kazuki Shikimori, a second year magic school attendee is a bit below average, only being able to use magic eight times before he turns to ash and disappears. This alone should not have qualified him to attend the prestigious Aoi Academy, but his lineage, and sheer magical power, more than make up for his shortcomings. Unknown to Shikimori, he has the lineage of some of the most powerful witches and wizards in history, which makes his ""genes"" very desirable.

Yuna Miyama appears one day, claming to be Kazuki's wife, and that's when the crazy starts. The same day, Kuriko Kazetsubaki and Rin Kamishiro appear and begin their quest to either get Kazuki's genes, much to Yuna's dismay, or kill him trying. Yuna claimes to purely love Kazuki while Kuriko and Rin are just following their head family's orders. Throughout the series, All three girls fall in love with Kazuki and are torn when he dies mid-series and becomes a ghost. The antics pick up where they left off when the girls decide to try and find a way to get his body back. The secret could potentially have them leave him a ghost.

The series is one of realization, a degree of growing up and coming of age. It is a charming series with a plethera of fan service to varying degrees. Overall, I give it a stamp of approval. The storyline is a common one, but the delivery and artistic style drew me in and has kept me spellbound to the series. I would recomend it to anyone over sixteen because of the fan service and some of the situations that help move the story foreward.",1290729600,,1653,4.540268456375839
2737098,5,B000MMLPGO,This is a cool awesome anime seris I loved it the Boy comes from a strong family of wizards and magicians but the flip side is he can only use magic five times before its over for him. Yet he is strong with magic powers and whoever has kids with him their offspring will be very powerful magicians. I really loved how all the girls in his school are fighting to be the one to have a child with its touching emotional and sweet how the main charater go out of his way to give those he know and care about their wish and to make them happy the story line gets better as it moves on he throws his life away for others he cares about its well worth buying I truly fell in love with this one forget renting it buy it everything is perfect in this the ending is so sweet and it works well as a whole. BUY THIS ONE you won't regret it,1286064000,,827,3.9285714285714284
2737099,5,B000MMLPGO,Great series and interesting story. I love it. A guy with ultimate power but he can only use it 8 times and 3 beauties after him xD. The character designs are good as well as the artwork in the series. I feel there should be more xD.,1272412800,,233,3.978723404255319
2737100,2,B000MMLPGO,"Maburaho is well drawn. The story is sub par and boring at times. The humor isn't that funny, unless maybe if you're a highschool girl who hasn't been ""around the block"" a few times. Just to establish what I think of as a funny anime so you know where I'm coming from--- GTO is funny. This is, at most, cute. It may be that I'm not in to ""Harem"" comedies. I find animes with shy, sexually repressed male protagonists who get smacked around by their female counterpoints annoying. If you're a masochistic guy or a girl who likes to dress up in cosplay costumes, you'll love this. If you have any self esteem, you should take a pass.",1272153600,,631,4.3559322033898304
2737101,5,B000MMLPGO,"This is a very cute anime. It is a story of a world full of magicians where everyone has magic, but they can only use thier powers a certin number of times. The story's main character Kazuki, is considered a loser because he can only use his magic 8 time in his life. If he uses all his magic he will turn to dust. However his entire life changes when he discovers he is from a long line of powerful magicians, and three beautiful girls begin chasing him for his ""genes"". Yuuna, Kuriko and Rin begin a competition for his superior DNA, and constantly throw themselves at the reluctant Kazuki. Together this group gets into all sorts of crazy situations forcing Kazuki to use his limited magic. This anime is very funny and oh so cute.

It is the complete collection containing all 24 episodes. The audio options are English or Japanese with subtitles for either. There is not much in the way of special features except trailers for other animes. Overall I think if you enjoyed animes like ""Love Hina"" or ""Negima"" you will like this anime.",1243123200,,1038,4.5212765957446805
2737102,3,B000MMLPGO,This anime is really funny up until midway through the series.  Then it feels as if an entire new team of writers took over to finish it.  Still worth watching though.,1225929600,,167,4.354838709677419
2737103,4,B000MMLPGO,I was gonna rate this 1 star but it is a great series. But i have no idea why this is being re-released at the exact same price as the 1st release? The whole point of a 2nd re-release is to make the price cheaper then the original. So what was the point again? Anyways overall it is a great series.,1212969600,5,298,3.901639344262295

2737105,4,B000MMLPGO,"Anime titles these days do little to keep my interest. Nothing compares to Sailor Moon and the mystery factor that they have in each episode. I also enjoy Dragon Ball Z but one fight scene can drag across 6 episodes & it also contains a lot of characters just starring at one another waiting 4 something to happen.

Anyways this is a great series & resembles Harry Potter somewhat as they are all male warlocks & female witches with special powers so to speak & they go to an academy dedicated to people with magic powers. The main male character can only use his powers like 8 times and 3 girls want to be with him for his DNA but only 1 truly loves him. Anyways it's a fun show & lots of fun laughs with great dubbing as usual from the folks at ADV. Price tag was a big hefty but wait till it drops before you get it. Other then that i really enjoyed this title. It didn't have the ADDICTIVE factor like Sailor Moon but it had enough of it to keep me watching the next episode. Overall i liked it but the animation can seem a bit sloppy or amateurish at times as if the artist were 1st time animators as oppose to artist that have been in the industry for 10 years & have done tons of anime series.",1211414400,,1200,4.128205128205129
2737106,5,B000MMLPGO,"I won't repeat the story line. This is a light-hearted comedy romance with great writing and translation (both subtitles and dubbing). I've seen it compared to Harry Potter series. There are some obvious similarities, but there are considerable differences as well, so don't pass it up thinking it's nothing more than a cheap knock-off. The similarities pretty much end at kids in a school who can use magic. There is no actual antagonist in this series, only conflicting goals and interpersonal frictions, much like in real life. It still manages to keep a good pace and stay interesting throughout the series. It is a comedy-romance mostly, but one even us guys can find entertaining. :P  It has become one of my favorites in a very short time. I highly recommend it.",1202860800,,769,4.870229007633588
2737107,4,B000MMLPGO,"This was a collection that was great but it fell in the parts that matter most: the beginning, middle, and end mainly the end. There is probably not enough here to recommend it to those who generally avoid harem comedies, or more accurately there is enough to turn them away, however those who do enjoy harem comedies, or is an true anime lover like me would probably do well to check this show out.",1193616000,,399,4.405405405405405

2737109,4,B000MMLPGO,"It's easy to dismiss Maburaho as simply another fanservice riddled, harem anime but Maburaho differs in that it actually has some heart to back up the troves of gratuitous fanservice it forces upon its viewers and that for heaven's sake, it doesn't take itself seriously. It is deliberately over the top, (just look at the size of some of those jiggling spheres...could anyone draw those with a straight face?) silly, touching and effectively hilarious. Each character retains enough emotional depth and uniqueness to remain interesting and endearing throughout. (although, admittedly, I couldn't help but feel that Rin felt somehow incongruous most of the time)Anyone who approaches this anime expecting to see the pinochle of dramatic achievement is missing the point (and, quite frankly, is the biggest boob involved in this whole thing) Despite all of its assets, Maburaho does have some substantial flaws-the story REALLY loses its steam about halfway through the series and resorts to some pretty dull filler episodes before regaining its momentum towards the end, which brings up another problem...the ending is way too convenient...it certainly doesn't ruin the series, though and may even put a smile on your face. All in all, Maburaho is simply an anime to be laughed at-it was written, directed and animated as such, so why not just sit back and do just that? Who knows? If you're the sentimental type, it just might even touch your heart. It's at least worth a try, don't you think?",1183852800,4,1494,5.1020408163265305

The virtues of selflessness are explored in this one. The main character is lovable and has more value than is apparent by just looking at him.

The fun part of this is that the women who want him are not deceitful about the reasons why they want him. This has 2 affects. One it is refreshing and two, it makes the humor believable when women are throwing them selves at him (you understand why they will go out of their way to hook up with the lucky fellow).

In the end the virtues of friendship, the payoff of self sacrifice and a good love story are all there.

2737112,3,B000MMLPGO,"I see a lot of 5-star reviews for Maburaho. Now this is a good show, but nowhere near the best that anime has to offer. Whether you are looking for fan-service, storyline, nice graphics, or comedy, everything about this anime is only so-so.

Yes Maburaho is funny at times, but nowhere near as funny as Shinobu or Azumanga.

Yes Maburaho has some pretty girls, but they are nowhere near as flashy as shows like Divergence Eve or Eiken.

Yes Maburaho has an interesting storyline, but it is only touched in the first and last episode. Every episode in between is pure filler.

Maburaho was a fun watch for me, but not particularly memorable for me in any way. So if you've run out of other great anime's to watch, then go ahead and buy Maburaho. Otherwise keep looking.",1179100800,10,768,4.543478260869565

8170083,3,B000MMLPGO,"Maburaho was one of my first harem series besides Tenchi Muyo. Many people like to compare it to Tenchi Muyo because the girls have personalities and that there is a plot in comparison to other harem series that are slow (Love Hina usually comes to mind when I think of the opposite end of harems).

The story sets place where magic users all have a set number of magic they can use before they die. The more magic you have, the chances are for you to live longer...

But enter the protagonist Kazuki who only can use magic 8 times and he's made fun of for it. Of course, because he has so few magic spells, he can pull off the most incredible abilities such as changing the weather or stopping time.

Enter the three main girls Yuna, Kuriko and Rin who go after Kazuki for his genes for different reasons that are spilled out in the very episode. And from there Kazuki starts using his magic to help the girls (thus they really start to fall for him instead of just wanting him for his genes to help their family out one way or another).

Of course the series likes to lean toward the main girl Yuna and while that was fine at the beginning because she was the one that cared for Kazuki's wellbeing more so than wanting his genes, halfway through the series, they thought it would be a good idea to just make her a yandere/clingy jealous girl that pretty much ruined Yuna's character because what started out as Yuna being a caring individual makes her very selfish and only thinks about herself even more than Kazuki. That was Kuriko's role to be the mean one and its hard to sympathize with Yuna once her personality goes 180 and is still treated as the good one of the three.

Personally my favorite of the three girls is Rin (the girl with blue hair). She's such a dork and generally has the most important reason to wanting Kazuki's genes. It takes her the longest to even crush on Kazuki and when she does, her affection comes off as genuine in contrast to Kuriko who I felt was faking it for most of the series (plus her double standard line about how nobody would care if a man was sexually assaulted rubbed me the wrong way) and Yuna after her personality changed for the worse.

I think another thing that angered me is how the magic world is never explained. Shuffles has the same problem in which they introduce a magical world but focus more on the harem rather than the setting. The fact that Kazuki's magic is shown to constantly be shown to be powerful and could have evolved into a magical action series like Negima or Rozario Vampire is a huge disappointment when you re-watch it. Plus Kazuki is specifically hated in his class for no real reason at the beginning. Yes the girls liking him only fuels the fire but beside Kazuki saying he's a loser, we never actually see anything else on why he deserves the hate in the first place. It just seems to be there for the sole reason of Kazuki not being able to rely on anybody else except the three stalkers.

Overall looking back it was a fun ride originally but when you re-watch it, there are so many things that could have been better. 70/100.",1401321600,,3112,4.392361111111111
