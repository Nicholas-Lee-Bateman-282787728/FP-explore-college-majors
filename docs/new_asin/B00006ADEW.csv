1736407,5,B00006ADEW,"Topless chicks dancing around to a narrator's voice that is the funniest thing I've ever heard.  Imagine the voice of a 1940s newsreel, now make it loud and agressive, now imagine him saying phrases like:

""She's skilled in the art of the topless!""

""But enough of this palaver""

Now multiply the funny level of what you imagined by 10x.  Words don't do it justice, you've got to see this movie for yourself.  Fantastic.",1154563200,,420,4.684931506849315

1736409,4,B00006ADEW,"A lively, bouncy, kaleidoscopic view on the topless dance girls of the late 60's.
The most memorable short scene, is that of a ridiculously proportioned girl, Darlene Grey, doing a topless boogie in the desert. Otherwise petite, she almost falls over on several occasions, because of the weight of her swinging breasts!
Unlikely to be forgotten in a hurry.",1036454400,,356,5.0508474576271185
7966144,5,B00006ADEW,"Russ Meyer's best movie, despite what the snotty critics say.  Just pure, plain and simple stacked beauties Russ brings together doing what babes did in the 1960s, dance, cavort and show off their figures!  (Especially the OUTSTANDING DARLENE GREY, alone, worth the price of admission!).
NOT for those hung up on plot.",1501027200,,318,5.096153846153846
7966145,3,B00006ADEW,An entertaining romp through a campy bygone era but the DVD suffers from a lackluster film transfer. It also suffers from the sky high price of all Russ Meyer movies. This should be on Blu-ray for half the price by now!,1482883200,,219,4.365853658536586

7966148,3,B00006ADEW,"This is an old classic with some pretty decent scenes. However, the ""dancing"" is quite spastic compared to the style of dance that has evolved since the 60's.",1410998400,,158,4.678571428571429
7966149,3,B00006ADEW,"Journey with us on a tour of San Francisco, with its tall buildings, the Golden Gate Bridge, its churches and temples and its cable-cars carrying the citizens around its busy streets. All in the company of a naked woman driving her car along the roads as she surveys the city's sights. And why are we here in San Francisco? Because it is home to a very important innovation in entertainment, that's why. Yes, this city is where the craze for topless dancing began, a craze that has caught on throughout the world and will be examined in this film.

There is really noy much more that can be said about Russ Meyer's mockumentary on topless dancing. The hour long film is not much more than an excuse for Meyer to put his favorite subject, large breasts, on view. Sure there is a running commentary from the dancers as we go along but what is said by them is hardly the most important part of the film. The point here is to put as many naked breasts on display and Meyer succeeds brilliantly. Is it great film making? Hardly, but it can be an interesting film to watch if only to see how much times have changed. These are dancers that we are watching not the strippers of today.

The presentation of the ladies is mostly to feature them outdoors, gyrating wildly to the nearby radio or tape player or simply running through forests and countryside, all in the typical fashion of a healthy lifestyle, back to nature nudist film. As this is a mondo movie, there's a nod to the international scene with footage from Meyer's own ""documentary"" Europe in the Raw, basically various strippers on a stage performing their act, and as the narrator tells us, hailing from all over the Europe, from France to Belgium and Germany, just to illustrate how far the phenomenon has grown.
The disc does feature one interesting extra feature, an episode of Jonathan Ross' The Incredibly Strange Film Show that is worth checking out as it gives us some insight into the career of Meyer including a visit to Meyer's home which has become a shrine to his films.

While not the greatest Meyer film it is worth its short hour viewing time.",1336694400,,2115,4.560526315789474
7966150,4,B00006ADEW,"Mondo Topless is a raunchy Russ Meyer 1960s film that features topless dancers (a little history for non-Boomers - sometimes called ""go-go girls"") from that era. The whole movie is underscored by over-the-top narration and crappy rock'n roll from that period. It's fun for a while but wears a little thin.",1244246400,,305,5.0
7966151,1,B00006ADEW,"Why is it that these lucky guys who get to make films with these lovely women never get it right?  Clearly the most beautiful woman in the entire movie is Darlene Grey, the only reason why I purchased the movie.  Russ did not do justice to her.  In fact he blew it.  We see a 1 minute dance of her from a distance, clearly not a good enough view to really appreaciate her humogous breasts.  The other shots of her were only for a few seconds spaced throughout the movie.  Again in one 3 second clip she is half submerged in water, unable again to view her wonderful assets.  Yet Russ spends ample time on less attractive smaller brested women.  Clearly Russ got it all wrong.  This is one of the very few vidoes of Darlene Grey, left for posterity as an historical document, and it leaves the viewer very disappointed and frustrated.",1238630400,,833,4.392156862745098
