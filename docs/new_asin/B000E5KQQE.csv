2493615,3,B000E5KQQE,"If this third season is not released with closed captioning, like the first two seasons weren't, then I won't be purchasing this. They can be recorded off TV Land with Closed captioning!!

Far too much swearing in some episodes for my taste so I need closed Captioning for the TV Guardian to work.

otherwise an excellent series.",1142899200,8,329,4.754385964912281
2493616,5,B000E5KQQE,"Highway to Heaven to me is comfort TV. I remember being in grade school when these episodes originally aired, looking forward to every Wednesday night. This series is perfect family programming and it aired at a time when NBC was certainly the place to be. Cosby, Family Ties, Cheers, Night Court was where it was at in the 80s. Come home again to Highway to Heaven and Come home to the good old NBC.

Season Three of Highway to Heaven is filled with many guest stars including: James Earl Jones, Ned Beatty, Eddy Albert, Josh Brolin, James Earl Jones, Rosalind Cash, Brian Austin Green,  Leslie Nielsen and most notably Dick Van Dyke.

Dick Van Dyke plays a homeless man with a heart in ""Wally.""

Jonathan and Mark tag along with an elderly street puppeteer who's also an angel - but doesn't know it. It is often considered one of the top ten best of the series and it is one of my favorites. The ending is moving, as Wally, gives of himself unselfishly and gives his life so others can live.

James Earl Jones plays Gabe Wilson, an old friend of Mark's and down-and-out jazz pianist who tries to re-build his life after suffering a heart attack. It is interesting to see the conflict between mother and daughter brought together with helpp of Jonathan and Gabe.

One of my favorite episodes featured  Leslie Nielsen as a wealthy man out of touch with the world. Jonathan and Marc are his bodygaurds. He is murdered. He is then given a second chance to live the last few days over, he's still going to expire, but the boss gave him one last chance to make a diifference. This is Highway at it's finest.

For the Love of Larry is a gem, a father and son are in an auto accident. Larry their dog finds a way to save their lives. Some would call it sappy,I remember tearing up at the surprise ending.

There are a few episodes this season that are not my favorite to watch, but you get the good with the bad. I believe any episode of Highway is better than most of what today's programmers call TV today.

Good clean fun. World class television. Twenty five Hour Long Episodes, it's a heavenly good deal!",1142294400,42,2102,4.450520833333333
2493617,5,B000E5KQQE,"If there was one Highway To Heaven episode that many viewers remembered from season three the most, I Was A Middle-Aged Werewolf have to be the one. A spoof on the 1957 cult classic, ""I Was A Teenage Werewolf"" (Which lunched Michael Landon to stardom), it's what many to be concerised as THE most remembered Highway To Heaven episode ever!

Thanks to A&E, we now relived to see this, and all the other season three episodes.",1138752000,28,424,4.578947368421052

2493672,4,B000E5KQQE,"I bought this season specifically for the Christmas episode.  I originally taped it onto a VHS tape from the tv.  The picture quality was never that good, but it was all I had and I would watch it every Christmas for years.  I decided to buy it on dvd.  I thought the quality of the picture on dvd would be better than my vhs tape.  Lo and behold, it wasn't.  The picture quality on the commercial dvd is, sadly, no better than on my vhs tape.  What a disappointment.

But on the plus side, the story line is terrific.  I haven't watched any of the other stories on this dvd, but I imagine they are all good too.  I used to watch this show when it was on tv and liked it.",1432252800,,671,4.015151515151516

2493677,3,B000E5KQQE,"""Highway to Heaven"" is my favorite television series from the 1980's.
Michael Landon and Victor French had such magical on-screen chemistry together.
""Highway to Heaven"" had such a huge amount of heartwarming, emotional and powerful episodes throughout its five season run on NBC.
Television shows certainly aren't made quite like this anymore.

Here are the run times of the three obvious syndicated episodes.
""Love and Marriage - Part 1"" runs for 45:01, ""Love and Marriage - Part 2"" runs for 45:12 and ""Parents' Day"" runs for 44:17.

Now to two episodes that might be uncut,
""For the Love of Larry"" runs for 47:19 and ""Normal People"" runs for 47:51.

The other 20 episodes all run for 48 minutes and change.

Very sadly, the old 2006 DVD release of Season Three by A&E only included syndicated episodes.
Thanks to Mill Creek Entertainment for being the only DVD distributor to bring us any uncut episodes from Season Three.

The third season of this brilliant, inspiring, inspirational and unique TV Series originally aired on NBC from September 24, 1986 to May 6, 1987.

Notable guest stars from the third season of ""Highway to Heaven"" were Barbara Stuart, Bill Erwin, Brian Austin Green, Dick Van Dyke,
Didi Conn, Eddie Albert, Eli Wallach, Ernest Borgnine, Ernie Reyes Jr., Eugene Roche, Jack Ging, James Earl Jones, James Troesh, Josh Brolin,
Leslie Nielsen, Margie Impert, Martha Scott, Nana Visitor, Ned Beatty, Paul Walker, Richard Mulligan, Robert Culp, Roy Thinnes and Shannon Tweed.

I'm rating this 5-disc set just three stars because of the dreadful packaging and the inclusion of the three obvious syndicated episodes.
Disc #1 is stacked directly on top of Discs #2, #3, #4 and #5.
I totally hate this type of packaging.",1427328000,2,1735,5.003472222222222

I haven't had the time to watched the other 3 yet.  I think the problem is with the way you package it.  5 discs all on top of one another.  I never have seen any other DVD's packaged this way.  They are hard to get out and it's probably why they skip.  I love the series,  but not happy with the episodes that skip.",1411603200,,456,3.923076923076923

2493881,5,B000E5KQQE,"Although my wife and I have not even finished Season 1 - I can certainly see why so many people around the world feel so strongly about this wonderful heartwarming show and it's stars Michael Landon and Victor French. Everything about the show and each episode's meaning and message to us all leaves one with a wonderful feeling that events in real life can't match. The on screen chemistry between Michael and Victor hits you like a thunderbolt from heaven and both their performances are just fantastic and always give the viewer much more that one could ever hope for. The writing, directing and music are absolutely first rate and always leave you excited about what the next episode will bring. We all know about Michael's wonderful work in his other shows but who could forget the very special ""spark"" that Victor French gave ""Get Smart"" with his zany and wonderful portrayal of Agent 44! Yes, he looked different over the years but that sensitive comic warmth of his character as well as his person - always seems to shine through.
It was very sad to hear that both Michael and Victor died shortly after the completion of this wonderful show, both at the young age of 54, but I strongly feel it was Michael's and God's plan for all of us to put together this very meaningful and inspiring show for all of us to enjoy and help with our own lives forever and ever. THANK YOU Michael and Victor!",1349049600,9,1399,4.577689243027889

2493883,5,B000E5KQQE,"I am so happy to have these DVDs.  I really wish they would release the rest of the Highway to Heaven DVDs.  Michael Landon and Victor French and the whole crew I applaud you.  Great Job!  When I watch these DVDs I can't help but to feel uplifted.  The acts of kindness, and compassion, etc.  If anyone is reading this and has the power to help release the rest of the Highway to Heaven seasons please help with that.  The world needs more programming like this.  There are very few like this anymore.

Wayne Dyer says ""Choosing to be kind is also a choice to make the Power of Intention active in your life. The beneficial effects of kindness on the immune system and the increased production of serotonin have been proven. Conversely, unkindness weakens the body and puts us into a state of dissonance. So extend acts of kindness; ask for nothing in return.""  If you would like to make your life more positive check out this website  just google this: healyourlife",1331251200,,966,4.526011560693641

The Lawyer of this couple has physical disabilities (a quadriplegic) and fights for custody of the boy from a family who cared right from the beginning but have not shown love to the boy. There are many family oriented similar to first episode named ""For the Love of Larry"" where a homeless retarded boy makes a wish that someone could love him and unknowingly helps, with the help of Jonathan and Mark a sick boy reunite him his parents and gets a home. Another great episode is ""That your dad"" where a couple orphan (girl & boy) unrelated children, who try to find there perfect father and episode named ""Code name freak"" where a twelve year-old prodigy is boy who is trying to fit in at the college fraternity.

In the 21st Century you cannot turn on the TV with kids in the room since explicit and sexual content is now the ""norm"" on many channels with information not meant for children to watch.

2493917,5,B000E5KQQE,"Highway to Heaven is one of the best shows ever produced, and this is probably the deepest season.  There are only a handful of episodes that are not classics, and the rest are great stories filled with different emotions, suitable for the whole family.  Amongst my favorites are ""Wally"", which I think is one of the best shows in any series ever produced, along with Leslie Nielsen's RR Benson and James Earl Jones as a convincing Gabe.  We also have a return of Scotty opening the season, the inspirational ""For the Love of Larry"", sure to tear up any dog owner, and the conflicted Ernest Borgnine and Eugene Roche in an episode that somewhat reflects ""Dust Child"" from season one.  From Dick Van Dyke to Shannon Tweed, these episodes provide a myriad of cast members and emotional stories guaranteed to keep you watching them over and over again like my family does.  I recommend this for anyone who is fed up with the state of TV shows today, and who enjoys emotional stories with a central underlying theme.",1144627200,24,1012,4.662921348314606
