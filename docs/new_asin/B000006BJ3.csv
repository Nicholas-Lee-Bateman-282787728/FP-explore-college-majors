8158628,3,B000006BJ3,"In the early 70's, Charles Bronson developed a respectable career in Europe, starring in international co-productions, generally italian and french ones. Among these films, it's worth seeing two of very different kinds, ""Cold Sweat"" and ""Lola"". The first one, called ""De la part des copains"" in France, tells about an ex criminal living in France who is forced by a gang of smugglers, led by James Mason (impressive as almways), to get even with his secret past. Intrigue, violence and treachery blows up all over the film, in a typical Bronson's vehicle.  A total change of pace occurs in ""Lola"" (called ""Twinky"" in Great Britain""), when Mr. Bronson plays a middle-aged man who falls in love with a teenage girl, the lovely and talented Susan George (she would later appear in the most thrilling Sam Peckimpah's film, ""Straw Dogs""). This duo provides a touching love-story, a perfect mix between experience and lively action.",974419200,,926,5.052287581699346
