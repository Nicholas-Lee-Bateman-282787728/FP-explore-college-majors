Thats okay though, the good thing is that you can pretty much tell what everyone is saying if you use your imagination. Besides you don't need subtitles to watch a fun fight. Always remember two things though when buying any region dvd. Make sure you have the right all region dvd player & check the language/subtitles out first. You should be good if you do.",1395792000,,471,4.552941176470588
