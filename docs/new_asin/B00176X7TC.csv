3169201,5,B00176X7TC,W.C. Fields is an original.  There will never be anything like him again.  The Dentist is a pre code sound short comedy film.  Fields is unleashed without any of the usual Hollywood varnish.,1383350400,,190,4.696969696969697
3169202,5,B00176X7TC,"They just do not make comedies like this anymore,W.C. fields was the ultimate showman. This is a must see for any W.C Fields fan.",1379116800,,129,4.416666666666667
3169203,5,B00176X7TC,I enjoy this short every time I see it; and I've seen it a hundred times. The scene with WC pulling the Lady's tooth was the raciest scene on film up until that time.,1376956800,,166,3.911764705882353
3169204,4,B00176X7TC,"Not the funniest I've seen, but the movie is worth a 4 star rating. The golfing charade was W. C. at his best. Bodacious and bawdy. He's everything you wouldn't want your neighbor or dentist to be. Or maybe, that wouldn't be so bad. Will continue to watch Fields when I come across his short comedies on the Prime.",1374883200,,314,4.338983050847458
3169205,5,B00176X7TC,"There is nothing like watching W.C. Fields in his mad-cap adventures.  You have to really appreciate his comedic style.  Actually, I gave this short video to my (then) student dentist.  He graduated this past May 2013, and I couldn't think of anything better, because although he was a serious student and did well by me, he was light-hearted.

Hope he is enjoying the video and becoming a licensed, bona fide dentist.  He was better than any one I have been to in the last 40 or so years!
