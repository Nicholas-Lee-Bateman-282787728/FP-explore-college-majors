8471924,1,B005GP7EYY,"I had high hopes for this promotion. The commercials on TV made it sound like a funny, stereotype-promoting alternative to the mainstream wrestling organizations. But this pay per view is simply not watchable. From the opening match, which looks like it was cut together by a 3-year-old, the pay per view is just low budget and bad. They seem to mask a lot of botches with jump cuts. The camera guys are seldom in the right spots to capture the action. The audio is often inaudible. It's just bad all around. To make things worse, the commentary guys aren't that good at it.

It says a lot when the preview video included on the disc is better than the PPV itself. That's actually a worthwhile watch.",1361836800,2,700,4.555555555555555
