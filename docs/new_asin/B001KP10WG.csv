8315698,4,B001KP10WG,"This is peppy and fun.  However, there was no promised toning band included.  How do I get it?",1519948800,,94,4.166666666666667
8315699,5,B001KP10WG,I love this workout. I gives me a lot of steps on my fitbit. Would highly recommend!!,1493769600,,85,4.0588235294117645
8315700,5,B001KP10WG,"I need to be able to exercise indoors, but have found I won't use a gym (always plan to go but never do).  I have been using this and a few other of her videos and have lost 7 lbs in 1 1/2 months and I know I am also gaining stamina.",1458432000,,233,3.480769230769231
8315701,5,B001KP10WG,A fast fun walk! The miles are all different and fly by. Leslie is encouraging and fun to listen to as usual.,1447977600,,109,4.0
8315702,5,B001KP10WG,Great workout!,1445817600,,14,6.5
8315703,1,B001KP10WG,I would have liked it if it was all shipped I only received 1 dvd because this was falsly advertised. Now I will probably never find this again for the price. So dissapointed,1381795200,2,174,4.303030303030303
8315704,1,B001KP10WG,"I've ordered this twice and have only received 4 Really ""Big"" Miles. This is not the set, just a single DVD of the set. :( I'm sure the set is great though! Hopefully this listing will be fixed to reflect what is actually being offered.",1356912000,8,236,4.266666666666667
8315705,1,B001KP10WG,"The picture for the DVD's shows 3 or 4 dvd's.  But when you actually get the dvd's, there are only two, plus the stretch band.  What's up with that.  I paid $22.00 for what I thought was going to be a larger quantity.  You can be sure I won't ever do that again, be forewarned on this one!!",1333238400,10,290,3.9482758620689653
8315706,5,B001KP10WG,"I actually ordered this from her site. It's 19.95 for the entire set and about 10 dollars for shipping. Anyway, she is fast and fun in this one. I love the background (her older ones had goofy props and windows), the walkers are new and not just her instructors. This one has walking and ""boosted walking"" otherwise known as jogging. I absolutely love it hands down! I am 5'8 and 217 pounds and I can jog. If I can, you can! This system has helped me go down 4 sizes (but only 2 pounds) and go from 9 injections a day for diabetes down to just a pill once a day. This is pretty fast paced so I would definitely work my way up to this one. The miles are about 12 minutes each. Her usual mile is 15 minutes. I would recommend this highly. I'd buy it for you if I could but I'm poor :)",1287360000,15,782,3.9872611464968153
