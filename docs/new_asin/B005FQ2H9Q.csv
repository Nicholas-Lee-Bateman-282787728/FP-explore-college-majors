A few scenes have been cut slightly & the widescreen is bogus chopped up & down it seems, we don't get to see very much of W.O.W.'s good parts.",1450051200,3,288,4.254545454545455

4684324,4,B005FQ2H9Q,"Bought this as a gift for my daughter. She was thrilled to get it. She loves Wendy O. Williams. While the movie seems dated by today's standards, it was amazingly well done for the time period. And you couldn't have cast a better to play Edna than Pat Ast. Considering all of the girls in prison films of this era, this is one of the better ones. If you have an evening to kill, this is a good movie for that. It is not meant to become a masterpiece or classic, just good, mindless fun.",1443398400,,486,4.126315789473685
4684325,4,B005FQ2H9Q,"I didn't see Faternity Vacation yet, but Reform School Girls was well-written. It gives you an idea of what a juvenile facility is like. I didn't like Edna, but Sybil Fanning played her role in the movie well.",1436745600,,209,4.526315789473684

4684327,3,B005FQ2H9Q,"Fraternity Vacation has a couple topless women scenes. It also has one scene with a woman fully nude. From the front they only show her topless. From the rear they show her whole body. OK movie, nothing to brag about. Reform School Girls is the better movie by a lot. Two different women shower scenes with topless and multiple full frontal. One of the scenes you have to slow the playing speed to see all the women. One woman has fake breasts, but all the other women have real breasts and are not bald. There also are a couple other topless scenes and fully nude women shown from behind.",1432512000,5,589,4.412844036697248
4684328,3,B005FQ2H9Q,"i'm not sure if it works or not but it is going to be a gift for my dad on his birthday, so, I will update on June 2, 2015 (Three stars for now)",1432252800,,144,3.264705882352941

4684331,4,B005FQ2H9Q,"This is a cool pair to have on DVD.  Fraternity Vacation is hilarious and fun to watch for seeing such youthful versions of a few favorite actors in the 80s (very, very 80s in fact) and of course for the setting.  Reform School Girls is, you know, funny and really silly, but features a large amount of girls in those high-hipped panties, and a lot of full frontal nudity (mostly with 80s style furry bush, but WOW is shaved and I caught one brief shot of her labia that you can probably see a lot better if it were on Blu-ray) and girl violence, if you're into that sort of thing.

Both of these movies are on the same disc so I'm not sure how good the transfer could have been if it had been 2-disc.  It mostly looks pretty crisp but definitely not quite as good as the film these two were shot on.  Great value for having these two in your collection though.",1424131200,5,861,4.193939393939394

4684345,3,B005FQ2H9Q,"A nerd gains the friendship of two of his frat brothers when his dad offers them his condo for the week in Palm Springs, and also offers the fraternity a hot tub and Jacuzzi if they can help his son find a girl. They meet two guys from a rival fraternity, and make a bet on who can nail the Designated Babe first.",1390089600,,313,3.984126984126984
4684346,4,B005FQ2H9Q,"I had seen RSG on HBO back in the 80's, but recalled only fragments of it. Was curious decades later to see it again... Too many laughable moments with this 2nd rate, medial-budget film. Not to mention Wendy O'Williams' name misspelled in the opening credits.
O'Williams' 80's career was an alternate metal-head band, with a few very good songs. She is actually quite believable here as Charlie. Much of the flow is decent, with the exception of Pat Ast's horrible over-acting as matron Edna. Other than this the movie is completely watchable and entertaining.

Fraternity Vacation is absolutely awesome. Fans will most-closely recognize Stephen Geoffreys as ""Evil Ed"" from the iconic Fright Night franchise. Geoffrey's  has always played an adorable nerd (almost surpassing that of Anthony Michael Hall). He truly outdoes himself, and his nerd-comic abilities in this iconic, however slightly lesser-known 80's classic. Tim Robbins and Cameron Dye also are quite notable figures here as 'Mother' and 'Joe"", Wendell's (Geoffreys) Fraternity pledge bros. The rest of the supportive cast, including Sheree Wilson is brilliantly cast. This film represents an archaic look at fitting in in the abundant sex-driven college years while maintaining one's dignity.",1372032000,7,1256,5.435897435897436

8470424,5,B005FQ2H9Q,"Both of the movies in this two-pack are excellent.

Fraternity Vacation is one of many teenage-hijinks movies from the early 80's. Risky Business set an early high-standard for visual style, writing, and acting. FV follows in that tradition and compares favorably to the more famous RB. You'll recognize Tim Robbins, John Vernon, Stephen Geoffreys, Amanda Bearse, Barbara Crampton, and probably a few others I can't remember. The central plot line focuses around two studs who bet on who can score first with an elegant blonde beauty. That premise should be offensive but it's not because director and writer ridicule these two frat boys more than anyone else. FV's point is that adolescent values are, well, adolescent and ephemeral in contrast with the age-old virtues of kindness, generosity, and friendship--adult values that keep you strong over the long term.

Reform School Girls might be the more innovative film. It's also mostly an all-girl cast. Pat Ast is most impressive and hilarious in her role as the girls' supervisor, though Wendy Williams is a close second as the prison's most incorrigible inmate. Shari Stoner is effective as the weepy wallflower who can't live without her stuffed bunny wabbit. Neither exploitation flick nor flat-out parody, RSG manages to navigate a middle course between the two. Its most miraculous accomplishment is that it never seems offensive or tasteless no matter how crude its subject material.",1515283200,,1444,5.246753246753247
