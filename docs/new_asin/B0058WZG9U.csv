8599770,5,B0058WZG9U,"I do remember Space or Dream of Life Album with the first CD surround sound deput album and single Dream of Life, which was released at about the same time as Oxygene album and single Oxygene Part IV by Jean Michel Jarre.
Like Jarre Alexander and their electronic techno type music has some similarities with Donner Summer, Geogio Morroder and maybe David Bowie with influences from Detroit Techno like Kevin Saunderson and Derrik May.
Dream of Life itself is the standout track for me, it is instrumental and while some other tracks can appear almost hynotic, they are at the same time mostly melodic, this has some real treasures to enjoy.
This Album have been as rare as hen's teeth for nearly 10 years, but now, thanks to this magnificent 7.1 blu-ray compilation, this music can now rightfully be placed up there with the likes of Giorgio Moroder, acknowledging them as techno pioneers. Dram of Life is naturally here, alongside String, Earth Rise, an erotic epic that swings from inventing intergalactic dubstep into a laser-drenched drama fest.",1318032000,3,1050,4.937853107344632
