1974058,3,B00016113I,"I had been searching for this title for a while, and was pleased to find  available, although only as R1 disc as this has always primarily been a VERY British production. I was therefore somewhat surprised to find that a majority of the characters voices had been redubbed using american actors, so it was quite an odd mix of American /English through each episode, for example Tom kittens mother has an impeccable British accent, Tom Kitten - American redub voice ?!  I can only assume that it must be due to copyright or actors not giving permission. So  UK R2 customers take note of this strange version, as it did remove some of the original magic I remember .",1147219200,29,664,4.563025210084033
1974059,4,B00016113I,"I bought this set because my 3 year old is a huge fan of Samuel Whiskers.  I was delighted to find that the series is very true to Beatrix Potter.  The stories maintain her sophisticated use of language, and the darker side of her characters.  The animation is wonderful.  Patricia Routledge as the voice of Cousin Ribby is a real highlight.

I would have given this DVD five stars, except that the live action sequence is too long.  You can't easily skip ahead because there is no chapter break between the live action part and the animated part.  Some simple re-authoring of the dvd would have made all the difference.

In summary:  For content, I give it 6 stars, for technical I give it two.  Overall 4 stars!",1143072000,17,713,4.5
1974060,5,B00016113I,"I've always enjoyed Beatrix Potter's stories, and was thrilled to see they were put in animated form. My boys, ages 4 years and nearly 2, both adore the DVDs. They evidently prefer them over most Disney fare, and will watch them repeatedly.

They have a magical calming effect over the children, which is amazing. Both of my hyperactive boys will sit quietly through each DVD, eagerly pushing play each time the menu pops up. They even behave better afterwards, with less fighting and more sharing. It doesn't appear to set out to teach them to behave better, it's just the result of them seeing and mimicking the behaviors and mores of a more polite society. My 4 year old regularly expounds on Peter Rabbit's bad behavior and its results. They've even picked up the vocabulary, which is impressive since the stories haven't been ""dumbed down"" for today's children. It assumes they understand - or will shortly - the meaning of such words as ""commenced"" and ""mischief"".

Another unexpected delight is the enjoyment I get out of them. The music, the voices (the likes of Niahm Cusack, Ian Holm & Derek Jacobi), the animated drawings and the live action sequences all blend together with a calm, soothing charm that gives an ""all's right with the world"" feeling. I can be having a horrible day, and if I put one of these DVDs to play in the background, the trouble just melts away.

The only drawback of these DVDs is that you must select each story from the menu. You can't just select ""play all"" and watch them consecutively.",1138752000,22,1526,4.707865168539326
1974061,5,B00016113I,"Really well done.  Seeing Potter's beloved, famous characters MOVE & TALK was amazing.  The live-action start to each story was (sometimes) a little long but also very well done.  High production values.  Quality all the way through.  I showed one to my class of 1st/2nd grade students and they DEMANDED we watch all of them.",1121126400,10,325,4.836363636363636
1974062,5,B00016113I,"Our family loves the Beatrix Potter videos.  They are beautiful.  They are such a breath of fresh air when compared to the typical children's video.  Entertaining and beautiful but not giddy or harsh.  The artwork is my favorite--stays true to Beatrix Potter's work--but the voices are wonderful too--no one can forget Ms. Tittlemouse's, ""I see the marks of little dirty feet!""  We quote from the stories often and my daughter, at 3, was adept at ""talking Bwitish"".  You will not go wrong with these children's videos.  They are beautiful, classy, lovely and good for your kids.",1120262400,29,578,4.958333333333333
1974063,5,B00016113I,"I was so thrilled to see these stories on DVD!  I had the videos when my children were little, and always enjoyed watching them as much as they did.  The music is lovely and wistful, and the animation of the Beatrix Potter watercolor illustrations is so well done. (I don't know how they managed it, but they kept the light touch of her originals and somehow just put them into motion.) The live-action sequences tie in beautifully with the stories, bringing the artist to life and showing how her stories might have come to be written.  I would highly recommend these as a gentle antidote to some of frenetic fare that is out there for little ones these days!  The DVD's and companion books would make a great baby gift!",1110931200,69,721,4.523076923076923
1974064,5,B00016113I,"The two discs here contain nine episodes: 5 on the first disc, 4 on the second (see my run-down below).  Each episode is comprised of a short, live-action framing sequence, the story itself in pleasing animation, and another live-action scene to tie up the tale.  Recall that this series was produced for television, thus each episode is approximately 26 minutes long.  Also, despite being produced for TV, overall I must say that everything is very well done.

The live-action sequences are detailed (costumes, scenery, etc.) and tie in nicely with the story itself.  The animated sequences are detailed and visually pleasant.  One of the directors, Dianne Jackson, had directed The Snowman, and another, Dave Unwin, directed the 1995 version of The Wind in the Willows, so if you enjoy ""old-school"" animation that is more evocative of watercolor than CGI, the visuals will be right up your alley.

If you are looking for a way to introduce your kids to classic stories, are a fan of Beatrix Potter, or just enjoy a nicely produced bit of animation, then I would highly recommend these DVDs.  I enjoyed them, my wife enjoyed them, my kids enjoyed them, and (I suspect even) my cat enjoyed one or two.

In terms of the episodes contained, here is the list by disc:

Vol 1:

- The Tale of Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny

- The Tale of Mr. Tod

- The Tale of Two Bad Mice and Johnny Town-Mouse

- The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle and Mr. Jeremy Fisher

- The Tailor of Gloucester

Vol 2:

- The Tale of Samuel Whiskers of the Roly-Poly Pudding

- The Tale of Tom Kitten and Jemima Puddle-Duck

- The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies and Mrs. Tittlemouse

- The Tale of Pigling Bland",1108252800,332,1672,4.603389830508474

A word to the wise, some little ones watching for the first time may be a little frightened by a few of the tales, like ""The Tale of Samuel Whiskers or The Roly-Poly Pudding"" so maybe familiarizing them with the stories in book form first might be the way to go. ""Peter Rabbit"" is the highlight of the DVD.",1438992000,,426,4.405063291139241

1974091,5,B00016113I,"I bought the collection for my granddaughter. She comes from a very literate family and is very familiar with the stories. She (and all the rest of the family) was absolutely enchanted with the delightful animated stories.
This collection is so far above most of the dribble that passes for children's entertainment today. The live action introduction to each cartoon is beautifully done and the cartoons themselves are full of sophisticated diction and beautifully reproduced Potter illustrations. Every character has such unique personality traits and remains true to the intent of the author.
There is no hyped up inane music, no bathroom humor, no inappropriate sexual undertones.
Timeless stories told in words that inspire ""smarting up"" rather than ""dumbing down.""
Pricey? Yes, but I'll take one collection of this caliber over 20 of the cheap and trashy videos that make up most of the modern child's library.",1433635200,4,916,5.238095238095238

The music is lovely and they are perfect to put in when you want the kids watching something that is relaxing and not too stimulating or loud. These classic stories will never lose their charm or appeal!,1427587200,,323,4.491525423728813
1974095,5,B00016113I,"This series kept my kids enthralled for years.  When those little moments come that seem like the kids escaped the bounds of reality, these would bring calm and serene back into the house.  Thank God for Beatrix Potter!",1425168000,,219,4.7368421052631575

1974097,5,B00016113I,"I got the collection mainly for the Christmas story, the Tailor of Gloucester, just a beautiful animated story, and the same as what used to be available separately on VHS.  I don't know why BBC doesn't offer the episode separately on DVD.  But the other Potter episodes are fun also with colorful and smooth animation, although a couple are a little on the dark side.

1974101,5,B00016113I,I read a lot of reviews before purchasing and everyone suggested the BBC edition! I was so impressed with the color and remastering they did.

Loved the music ""A Perfect Day"" which was the background.  Because some of those lyrics were not clear, it took some research to find the words to the song.",1405814400,,399,4.438356164383562
1974107,5,B00016113I,"High quality, artful and true to the original rendering in animation. Gorgeous and also true to the actual stories. I cannot recommend this entire series highly enough.

I love that they're faithful to the books; relatively quiet; and not flashy (they don't change the picture on the screen every few seconds). The artwork is beautiful and very close to the books. I even think that some of the longer stories (like Pigling Bland) make a lot more sense when told in this format. We even love the song that plays over the credits!

Since I have watched the series a couple of times since buying it, I decided to go ahead and buy this BBC version.  Being British, I didn't like the dubbing of some of the original voices on the Good Times version.  So, if you intend to play this series alot, pay the extra money and get the BBC 2008 version - The Beatrix Potter Collection.",1350604800,5,614,4.407079646017699

1974143,5,B00016113I,"How I love the darling stories by Beatrix Potter! I've treasured the stories since my own childhood and have since shared them with my own daughter who is as ardent a fan as I am. We have had this DVD for several years and keep revisiting the stories every now and then as watching these shows has such a calming influence on us. These stories bring joy to the soul, warm one's heart, and makes me yearn for a simpler time.

This collection is the one to get if you're looking for the nine episodes from 1992's BBC The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends. Here is a listing of the episodes:
Disc One
The Tale of Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny
The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies and Mrs. Tittlemouse
The Tale of Tom Kitten and Jemima Puddle Duck
Disc One runs 77 minutes, the aspect ratio is 4:3, is in color, and there are English subtitles for the hearing impaired.

Disc Two
The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy Winkle and Mr. Jeremy Fisher
The Tale of Mr. Tod
The Tale of Two Bad Mice and Johnny Town Mouse
Disc Two runs 77 minutes, the aspect ratio is 4:3, is in color, and there are English subtitles for the hearing impaired.

Disc Three
The Tale of Pigling Bland
The Tale of Samuel Whiskers or The Roly-Poly Pudding
The Tailor of Gloucester
Disc Three runs 77 minutes, the aspect ratio is 4:3, is in color, and there are English subtitles for the hearing impaired.

From the opening sequences, where an actress portraying the author Beatrix Potter is seen painting amidst the bucolic setting of the English countryside, the viewer knows he/she is in for a treat. The score is hauntingly beautiful and uplifting, and I find myself humming it at times when I'm in need of some cheer.

Much love and attention went into this production - the animation remains faithful to Beatrix Potter's lush watercolor paintings, and watching these animated tales is like having Ms. Potter's characters step out of the books, they seem so real!

There are no extra features, though the option of English subtitles is included. The track is in English.",1334102400,21,2022,4.541208791208791

1974147,5,B00016113I,"I'm so very glad I stumbled across this series. I'm a fan of Beatrix Potter's stories, and I enjoy this series tremendously. I bought this set as a quiet activity for my toddler when I am trying to get her to settle down for a nap. However, I think I love it as much as she does! The animations are really very good, very much in the style of Beatrix Potter's original illustrations. Many of the episodes are combinations of 2 stories, and the producers did a good job of mixing them in those instances. Of course, being an animation, there is a lot of dialogue and action that is not in the original books, but again I feel the producers did very well at filling in. The episodes are charming and interesting. My 7 year old son even enjoys some of the episodes (especially Samuel Whiskers--which is very exciting and dramatic). I also enjoy the opening and end segments, which feature Niamh Cusak as Beatrix Potter, showing her painting or running errands or pouring tea while discussing her letters and their recipients with her pet rabbit, Peter. I would definitely recommend this set.",1322611200,6,1088,4.61340206185567

One of my older daughters (who was a toddler back then) was absolutely entranced by them so I videotaped a couple of them for her at the time.  She watched the videotapes over and over until they were nearly worn out.  Now that I have a new little one, I looked for the same cartoons and am delighted they are available as a set of DVDs.  I'm looking forward to watching them all over again!  The music, scenery, narration - everything - in this series is so lovely and peaceful I could almost fall asleep watching them.

We purchased this collection for our two-year-old's birthday, and as we predicted, the rest of the family enjoy it, as well. We have a ""no commercial TV"" policy in our house, so these make great rainy day movies.

The animation stays true to Potter's illustrations and the stories are told in accordance to the words in the books (no paraphrasing). The animated characters fill in the story where the narrator leaves off. We enjoyed the blending of real life actors in the introduction and the animation. It made for a more engaging experience.",1308268800,2,702,4.899159663865547

Based on her illustrations, these tales come to life on the screen. Each episode begins with live action of 'Beatrix Potter' and her animal friends, penning the story that is about to be told, and leads into an animated story based on her books.
The music and sound quality are lovely. As it's an older production, it's not crisp on a large HD tv screen, but still beautiful to watch. Children and adults will love watching Peter Rabbit, Samuel Whiskers, Benjamin Bunny, Jemima Puddle-Duck, Mr. Tod, Tom Kitten, Jeremy Fisher and many more characters come alive!",1304294400,3,674,4.921052631578948

The music, the photography, the scenery is just stunning in the beginning of the show and the end of the show.  It just takes you to the rolling hills of England over 100 years ago.  Just stunning visuals and the cartoons are just beautifully done and just precious to watch.  My boys are older now but reluctantly they sat and watched a few episodes with me and it took them back to when they were little and they loved it.  The best product for a DVD your money will buy.

These stories are so colorful that when I just need to relax and sit back, I put these on and relax I do. There are scenes of the Lake District between the stories that is quite beautiful. If you are a Beatrix Potter fan, you will enjoy. I will no doubt view these with my grandchildren but I will also enjoy them at times by myself. Enjoy!!!",1269043200,2,551,4.149532710280374
1974165,4,B00016113I,"A writer and illustrator of children's books, Beatrix Potter provided the world with such memorable characters as Peter Rabbit and his three sisters Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail.  Nine of her stories were made into short films (about a half-hour each) and these comprise this boxed set.

Animated ... with live-action intros and exits ... these nine movie shorts capture the heart of Beatrix.  Rabiits, mice, birds, cats, and other animals are given human personalities, voices, and ... troubles.  Mr. McGregor's garden is, for example, a big trouble spot.

The quality does vary from film to film ... both in their production and Beatrix's writing ... with the adventures of Peter Rabbit (a very naughty bunny), Benjamin Bunny, Mrs. Tittlemouse, and Jemima Puddle-Duck being, I think, the best ones.

But if you want to watch charm and innocence in film, these Beatrix Potter stories are for you.",1268006400,4,898,5.116438356164384

Each video has two stories entertwined in a way that I do think reflects Ms. Potter's storytelling.
My six- year old loves the way it makes the story of Johnny Town Mouse and the Two Bad Mice take place in the same house, which I think may be referred to in one of the books.",1262908800,,530,4.205882352941177

She then sits at a desk and writes the tale that enfolds through animation. The delicate and subtly-rendered animation is faithful to the style and spirit of Potter's original watercolors. As if that weren't enough, the soundtrack is first-rate. Don't be surprised when you find yourself humming the main track ""Perfect Day"" throughout your not-so-perfect day. I was impressed with how Potter and these contemporary animators imbued such drama to everyday country life. As a father, I am heartened that there still are animated stories that create suspense and humor without having to resort to the mindless slugging and vapid dialogue that too often passes for children's entertainment.

Niamh Cusack is great as Beatrix Potter. You meet her at the beginning of the stories, & see how she got her inspiration for the stories as she's out painting in the Lake District. Lovely, haunting music adds to the pleasure of the viewing.",1208563200,8,541,4.880434782608695

1974194,5,B00016113I,"With the resurgence of interest in the art and tales of Beatrix Potter, there should be great interest in this fine compilation of nine 30-minute episodes from the BBC animated series. As the credits suggest, extraordinary care was taken to preserve Miss Potter's original art down to brushstrokes and washes. The animation is gentle, and invokes the author's characters - for the most part - with great charm and humor, Each episode opens and closes with photographed vignettes from the author's life in the Lake Country, and some are quite moving. The musical score, which sounds like an adaptation of Vaughan Williams, evokes Miss Potter's pastoral existence, and the closing credits feature ""Perfect Day,"" a bewitching song performed by Miriam Stockley, the lead singer of Adiemus.

As I grow older, these stories, animated or not, acquire a mythic quality they did not have when I was young.
In addition, since these animated versions of Potter's most familiar stories bring the eye closer to the art than most readings provide, one can appreciate the color sense, character and innovation in her art.

I am not ashamed to say that I am 55 years old and enjoy watching a tale or two before I go to sleep. Now, as then, Beatrix Potter's stories, her colors and lines and reverence for nature have a way of removing me from the chaos of the present,

This slipcased gift set will make an affordable gift for a child, or for an adult who has not relinquished the child within.

Warmly recommended.",1204156800,203,1499,4.84375

The artwork is as close to Miss Potter's as if she animated it herself!

My daughter discovered that Hugh Laurie (House MD) does some of the major voices!

1974199,5,B00016113I,"We received these DVDs a few weeks ago and we have loved all of the stories.  Whether or not you have been a Beatrix Potter fan and have read her stories, these DVDs are a real treat.  The two DVD collection has 14 of Beatrix Potter's favorite stories.  I read that Walt Disney, years ago, wanted to put these stories to film. However, Beatrix Potter did not think the essence of her work would be truly represented. Now, after so long, her work has been captured on DVD and the animation seems to be just what she would have done had it been available in her time.  It looks so much like her drawings.  After watching it many times, all of my children (from 14 down to 4)have been inspired to sketch, paint and make their own ""little stories"". Modern stories just don't do this!  I love to watch the stories right along with them.  And one of our unexpectedly favorite parts is the beginnings and endings to each story. These are not animated, but a reenactment of Beatrix Potter painting in the Lake District, walking in the rain, watching real animals (hedgehogs, rabbits, badgers, frogs, etc.), and writing her letters (stories) to children. We love getting a glimpse of what her life might have been like. It's filmed in her real home of Hill Top and so much of the furniture is sketched in her stories (Samuel Whiskers).
You will not be disappointed with this DVD Collection - you'll just wish you had purchased it long ago.",1195257600,5,1430,4.51937984496124

They start out with live action, real people recreating scenes of Victorian England, how Miss Potter sat to write her letters ""to the children"" then posted them. That segues into the animated story which looks very like the illustrations in the books, but the drawings come to life with actors' voices. It's really charming. the only irritating thing is that with the live action beginning and ending to each story, there are only 3 or 4 variations of it and after a while it wears on one. But my daughter is quite happy and it's for her anyway. This series is from an old BBC miniseries. It's very sweet.",1188777600,3,641,4.5344827586206895

My girl got very upset and I had to repeatedly tell her that the kitten would escape and be fine in the end.  She's OK with the story now because she knows that the kitten will get away.

Magical symphonic theme music wraps this experience in childhood morality tales and natural fantasy world like ribbons of silver and gold.

The twins are not TV watchers, but I had to do something or I was going to fall apart.  After desperately trying to stomach what PBS has for children now (horrible horrible programming) I ran to the library and found this DVD.  I had NO idea if it would be any better than the obnoxious stuff I found on PBS, but WOW was I surprised.

Beautiful!  Intriguing!  My twins were captured by the tales (they haven't read them yet) and the illustrations.  The pace and music AND live action were true to the ambiance of the tales.  The twins laughed and wanted to watch them all a second time (I only borrowed the first DVD).
