8406219,5,B003UV93J0,The quality of the product was good and it was just what I was looking for.  I also received the product in a short period of time.  Help me gain a good understanding of the 3-5-3 defense.,1357257600,,188,4.054054054054054
8406220,3,B003UV93J0,"I regularly use a 3-3 Cover I Defense as an alternate way to face a one back double twins set on the high school level. I wanted to get a quick look at 3-5 variant to see how similar my system is to the standard 3-5, which is a defense that we will face at least twice this year.
The presenter makes no misrepresentation and clearly states that this is s basic introduction to the defense. If you coach on the high school level you will find this DVD rather limited for your needs.
If you are a Little Loop coach this DVD may offer you another way to defend a very popular offense and it could give you a real edge if the 4-2 Cover I or 4-3 Cover 0 is the main way to defend no TE sets in your league.",1283644800,,701,3.909090909090909
