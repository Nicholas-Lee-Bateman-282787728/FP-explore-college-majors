5669822,5,B004FV4R86,"Season 9 of Waking the Dead is an amazing finale for this wonderful series. I'm going to miss Trevor Eve and his team, but they go out with some explosive episodes. I'm not sure they would have topped them had the series continued, but I would have loved to see them try.

Harbinger, Care, and Waterloo are very dark and definitely not for the squeamish. In Solidarity, we get a look into Grace's younger, more radical days. And in Conviction, the team encounters superstitions and misunderstandings that lead to tragic consequences.

Waking the Dead definitely exits on a very high note. I just wish there were more seasons to come. If you follow this series, don't miss season 9; and if you don't, I envy you having all 9 seasons ahead of you.",1403913600,6,745,4.593984962406015

5669825,5,B004FV4R86,Really hate to see this series end. One of the best that the BBC has produced and they certainly rank very high with their productions.  The acting is outstanding by all headed by Trevor Eve whose portrayal is superb!,1402531200,,217,4.564102564102564
5669826,5,B004FV4R86,"I love all the waking dead series but I'll admit I miss some of the old characters, like Frankie. I enjoy the idea of using modern technology to solve old crimes that have sat unsolved because that very technology wasn't available. I also like how there is a theme present in the unsolved murder that relates back to issues in the lives of the team. It is dark, and it's filmed in low light in an office that feels like it's underground. Many of the episodes uncover some devious acts committed by now high-ranking police officials who create road blocks to prevent the team from being successful and taking them down. There's always a psychological aspect and a picture of the perpetrator comes to light. It's highly enjoyable if a little gruesome too.",1401753600,4,753,4.669172932330827

5669828,5,B004FV4R86,"This final season has 3 discs containing 5 stories, each in two-part episodes. Here are the episode summaries (maybe spoilers):
HARBINGER, Part one- Boyd breaks in a new team member of equal rank, DSI Sarah Cavendish, a high-flyer recently grounded by a hushed-up failed operation. The team investigate the mystery of a missing banker to help the man's seemingly-cursed family find closure.
HARBINGER, Part two- Boyd is convinced that the missing banker is not a murderer, and pushes his team to make sense of the vague connections in the case and eventually confront the unfathomable evil lurking within the heart of this sad, unfortunate family.

CARE, Part one- A woman is discovered stabbed in the eyes and incinerated in her car. She is identified as a neglected child who was taken into care, then later kidnapped in 1986 at the age of seven.
CARE, Part two- The investigation into Claire Somers' death has seemingly unleashed a predator straight from the darkest childhood nightmare. But are they looking for a monstrous child-stealer, or misguided saviours?

SOLIDARITY, Part one- When the squad look into the case of an army activist discovered in London's sewer system they find the case has police connections.
SOLIDARITY, Part two-As the case continues, the squad investigate Murray using Grace as bait. However, when one member is shot and another is arrested, the case spirals, then reveals a connection.

CONVICTION, Part one- Boyd suspects a cover-up when a missing student's DNA matches with an unidentified corpse.
CONVICTION, Part two- Boyd needs Sarah's expertise to help expose the state's involvement in Barclay's death.

WATERLOO, Part one- Boyd investigates the disappearance of 16 homeless boys from Waterloo Bridge in the 1980s.
WATERLOO, Part two- Time is running out for Boyd as he fights for justice against a powerful adversary.",1400803200,9,1858,5.2040133779264215

5669832,5,B004FV4R86,We were hooked on Waking the Dead from the first episode.  A forensic drama with lots of suspense and drama and a team of investigators who function more like a family.,1426377600,,168,4.419354838709677

5669835,5,B004FV4R86,Intriguing series.  Brilliant detective work in all the nine series.  My favourite series to watch when I cannot find anything to watch on tv.,1424736000,,142,4.875
5669836,4,B004FV4R86,"I love this series but I'll admit that some episodes are hit or miss. A big part of the draw for this series is the team. Boyd and his gruff attitude can get on one's nerves but that's often countered by Grace's reasoning and calm. Eve brings about the geek side of forensic science beautifully while Spence is always that bulldog just looking to do the right thing. Cavendish, the newest addition from last season, comes around but one of my complaints with series is that relatively high turn over of that fifth slot on the team.

I mean, I can't really speak to that much since every series has it's turnover. But, after the loss of Mel, who I thought along with Frankie in the early seasons, made the perfect team. Once they started swapping them out (and Tara Fitzgerald's Eve eventually grew on me though I'm still a fan of Frankie), it made other aspects of the series stand out.

Sometimes a case (one over two episodes) can just drag on. The writing is still good but it sometimes feels like they just ran out of ideas at points and just have to follow false leads to keep things moving.

That said, the exception to that rule is the last case of the season. I wish they were all like that. It was just so well done.

If you've followed the series this far, there's no reason to stop. It's the last season they made and while IMDB seems to be optimistic (they show it as running from ""2000-"" rather than ""2000-2011""), I seriously doubt they'll put together another season. Maybe if we're lucky, they'll do a ""movie"" here and there but with everyone moving on, I wouldn't place any bets on it.",1416700800,2,1601,4.416949152542373

5669839,5,B004FV4R86,"The final season of one of my favorite BBC productions. Here, the CSIs put on paper outer garments to avoid contaminating the scene, and don't show up at crime scenes in stiletto heels, mini skirts, and full makeup. If you enjoy an intelligent mystery, these (along with Midsomer Murders, Inspector Lynley, Morse, and Lewis) will tickle your brain cells. If your favorite crime show was CSI Miami, look elsewhere.",1409270400,3,413,5.0

5669848,5,B004FV4R86,"An exceedingly well-done series.  The final episode was just perfect.  The last scene was particularly clever, with the Team  who no longer had a home, together gathering under one of London's most famous bridges.  I am distressed, however, that the Cold Case division has been disbanded.  I do wish that additional seasons could be in the offing and available.
I also wish that some of the former characters who either left for another job--Frankie to research; and other characters; or who were killed off--Melanie and Stella, could have remained with the Team.
Despite Boyd's sometimes overbearing, bullying, and erratic behavior, the Series was excellent.  The rest of the Team were all superb, ethical characters.",1405296000,2,718,5.254385964912281

5669850,5,B004FV4R86,"I love this show - it is a cross between Cold Case and CSI. I would recommend that you start with Season 1 so you can see the characters grow - several have left and been replaced with new ones but on occasion there are still references to them. This is a British show so the actors may not be familiar to you but they are excellent and it doesn't take long for you to feel like you know them. The writing is quick and sharp. The episodes start like Cold Case you see the crime and then go to the present and the squad starts to investigate. Give it a try - if you like British tv drama you will certainly enjoy this one.

8573272,5,B004FV4R86,"This show stayed strong right up to it's finish.  Partly because of the excellent actors who had 11 years to perfect them. In fact it wasn't a wise decision to end this one probably.  The last story is perhaps one of the shows most unrealistic and flat out over the top. But it's still good entertainment.  The rest of the episodes were just like any other from this show. The cast said they would continue , this was the core cast of course.  three main leads were killed off and two quit.  but the other three kept going for all of the 92 episodes.  The ratings were still high , but the British often do dumb things when it comes to tv shows.  Like cancelling successful ones to make room for new ones.  This was always a gritty show and it maintains that right up to the end.  One mistake that is in the show is where grace says "" nine years and we end up under a bridge' that's waterloo bridge, made famous by the 1967 kinks song.  Only they were on the air for 11 years from 2001 -2011.  no that's not ten years.  it includes 2001. although during that time there were only nine seasons.  still , what a shame to see this show go.  we didn't get the final dvd set until 2014. and this looks good , as it was filmed on film.  Before the early 90's , most british shows were done on tape.  So,  we get  a nice picture here from a great show.  If they are smart they can do a miniseries of this.  Strangely bbc America refused to show this or the great 'silent witness' which has been on since 1996 or so.  At least you can now see the end of this great show on your telly.",1451606400,,1576,4.068403908794788

8573279,5,B004FV4R86,"Season nine (9)  of Waking the Dead brings this very fine series to  an end and does so without sentiment but with five (5), in two (2) parts each, episodes that are brilliantly acted, produced and directed with plenty of nail biting suspense .  Superintendent Detective Boyd (stupendously acted by Trevor Eve) is still cranky but greatly  leads his British Cold Case team that consists of the psychiatrist Grace (marvelously acted by Sue Johnston), sexy Detective Spence (wonderfully acted by Will Johnson), pathologist Eve (a real but brilliant nerd greatly acted by Tara Fitzgerald) and new detective Cavendish with her past issues.  Boyd leads his team to solve cases that have gone cold but usually having tie-ins with current cases.

The cases solved in Season Nine (9) are centered around so-called radical politics, the Islamic religion verses Christianity, Pedophilia, crooked cops, etcall are solved, per usual, most brilliantly with a death of a team member and Boyd being terminated (not a spoiler but a known fact in this season but how and why is the real question)

Season nine (9) intently but sadly, for me, brings Waking the Dead to an endI will miss it!",1426982400,2,1172,4.97948717948718
