2158481,1,B000621358,"Lucky for me, I did not spend any money on this...thing - for lack of a better word.  From one non-Bushy to another: Do yourself a favor and save your money.  If you're gonna dump ten bucks, at least give it to your favorite charity, not the pranksters who have thus managed to trick people into buying this lemon of a DVD.

Why is it a lemon?  The video quality is terrible, but at least I never expected much in that area in the first place.  The only redeeming quality is the 10 minute intro the Bush twins gave at the GOP convention, which was terribly dull and a waste of time.  At least I thought it was until I got to the W clips.  After about 5 minutes I went into convulsions.  Overdubbed dummy questions, the same 4 clips of W just standing there saying nothing repeated ad nauseum, the questions are then repeated, as are the W clips.  I fastforwarded past the last 3/4 of it, which was also an honest waste of my time.

Heaven help me if I ever meet the people who made this tripe, not just for wasting my time (and other's money), but for dummying down political discourse even worse than it already was.  If it ever does come to burning books and movies, I'll gladly throw this one on the pile.",1120780800,12,1208,4.2314410480349345
2158482,1,B000621358,"This film is HORRIBLE. The only factual part of the entire movie is the Bush daugthers speech at the Republican National Convetion.

The only reason for including that speech is to make the running time reach 30 minutes. The remaining 20 minutes of the film are deidcated to looping 3 continous scenes of Bush shaking his head, and muttering.

On the back of the cover it says it pokes fun at the presidents lack of Wit and wisdom as he discusses WMD's, His driving record, his thoughts on teh draft and his daughters. The truth is, he doesnt discuss anything. He doesnt even SAY anything. All that happens, is he walks up to a podium, and the creators of this film add in questions, like ""Can you spell CIA?"" or ""Are you high?"" and George W. Bush's response is 3 motions looped together. The film is not worth a dollar. A teenager with any type of computer knowledge could create a film about the gaffe's of bush that would be infinetly better.

What is sad, is that their is so many mishaps that ACTUALLY happened. It would have been nice if they had actually gotten REAL dirt on Bush. Real clips of him messing up. Instead they created this piece of filth. Under no circumstances would i recommend ANYONE to get this film. It is HORRIBLE. in fact, that is an understatement.

When they say this DVD is a one-of-a kind, they aren't lying",1099785600,24,1339,4.475409836065574
2158483,1,B000621358,"Burn him!!! It's not 'wisdom' it's 'with doom'. Not even smarter than his father (who was so limited he could not go downstairs and chew gum at the same time) since he could not even think of a new war to enhance his (so-called) presidency, only to resume the one started by his father. And why, when there is no interesting alternative, there seems to be no way of getting rid of both candidates and starting afresh.",1099612800,3,417,4.428571428571429
2158484,1,B000621358,"This is a most disgusting trashing of our reigning president.  I fear that our young people will lose all respect for the highest office in our land - especially in light of Bill Clinton's immoral lifestyle & this type of ""trashing"" of a godly man who has led our country so honestly & wisely.  America is becoming a less dignified nation through works (?) like this DVD.",1098403200,8,371,4.522388059701493
2158485,1,B000621358,"Do not buy this under any circumstances. It's nothing but 3, 10 minute loops of the same thing. George Bush standing at a podium saying absolutely nothing. It's one of those videos where overdub a dumb question to make him look ignorant, such as, ""How do you spell C.I.A."", then it will show Bush standing there and act like he's thinking.

Here's what Bush says, and I mean this is the WHOLE DVD's audio.

""Uh""

""Did you have a question April, or did I call on you cold?""

There you go. That's what you get for your money. Absolutely worthless DVD. I'm already in the phase of trying to get my money back. I work for a major market leader that supplies audio to radio stations around the country and I thought I get some great ""Bushisms"" from this, even had it next day aired so I'd have it for the debates. Joke. Tune into Letterman or Leno any day of the week and you'll get 10x better Bush jokes. It shows Melee Entertainment as the company that released it. No more will I ever buy another one of their DVD. Trust me, STAY AWAY. You've been warned.",1097107200,40,1053,4.303030303030303
8036692,1,B000621358,"Same clips of W over and over again... The only thing more painful than the editing in this film is the first several minutes listening to his daughters attempt to be funny... If you want to waste your money on this DVD, I will sell you mine...otherwise it is destined to be a coaster.",1314144000,,285,4.296296296296297
8036693,1,B000621358,This was the most rediculous film ever made. Don't waste a penny on this awful film. Your pennies will be better off in a donation jar at a fast food joint. There is absolutley no plot what so ever.. it's just a long clip of nobody saying anything actually. DO NOT GET THIS MOVIE,1268524800,,279,4.185185185185185
8036694,1,B000621358,"This was a one minute tape that was someone's sick representation of ""Wit"". Misleading title, not worth the $14.98 paid, charged $7.49 for 'restocking', even though sent DVD back w/o harm. More respect is due a President of the US, whether one likes them or not. Where has America gone wrong when its Citizens (and we hope they are?) can do or say anything and especially be so disrepectful of our Highest Office. This Freedom, sacrificed by so many to have, was greatly abused in the production of this tape.  Review of DVD should have stated questions were asked of the President and then the tape kept repeating the President saying,""Uh"".  Should never have been made and shame on the producers.",1234915200,,698,4.760330578512397
8036695,1,B000621358,"As I watched this I grew angrier with every passing moment. Whether you are pro-Bush, anti-, or nuetral, this DVD is an insult to your intelligence.
Some butt-heads with poor video-editing software simply patched together a string of Bush hesitations, overdubbed five phony questions using their schmaltzy fake ""reporter voices"" and looped the entire thing over and over for 20 minutes. Since any of us could do the exact same thing with ANY video of ANY public figure, it makes no statement about Bush at all. It only tells me that the makers of this piece of carp (Melee Home Entertainment) deserve to be at the bottom of the entertainment barrel.",1230768000,2,649,4.8558558558558556
8036696,1,B000621358,"This only proves that the people who put this DVD together have no ""wit or wisdom"".  This is a waste of 30 minutes of your life.  It is a series of looped video of Bush saying, ""Uh..."", and a voice-over of three ignorant questions obviously dubbed by the video's creator(s)....for 30 MINUTES!  YIKES!
Don't waste your time or money.  Amazon should remove this product!",1208304000,,368,4.703125
8036697,1,B000621358,This must be a Karl Rove ploy to separate money from those who laugh (albeit with sadness) at the President's mishaps with the English language. This is as bad as the other reviewers have stated. The same few seconds of Bush reactions repeated for 20 minutes as responses to very lame fake questions. A scale of 1 - 5 stars does not allow a truly representative rating. I am thankful I only wasted a couple of dollars on EBay. Amazon site says more on the way. Return to sender.,1181520000,,478,4.382022471910112
8036698,1,B000621358,"I borrowed this DVD from the library. Having watched it for free, I still feel ripped off. This is an explotation product. It lacks content and humor. Sadly, there is not a law against creating this kind of tripe and selling it. It recycles the same shots of Bush with the same fake questions over and over again. The only worthwhile moments are the Bush daughters' speech, which shows inanity swims in their gene pool.",1171411200,3,419,4.6
8036699,1,B000621358,"At first I was confused about this DVD; is it pro Bush or con?  I've been interested in finding all the documentaries I could find lately.  Now that I've received it, I realize this disc is facetiously entitled ""The Wit and Wisdom of George W. Bush"" as I had suspected.  So, if I believed that George W. Bush is an idiot--I do--I would like this disc, right?  Wrong.  Just because I think Bush is an idiot does not mean this disc has helped me in my cause.  For one thing, I'm not as anti Bush as I am anti neo-conservative.  Note, the entire purpose of this disc is to get a neo-conservative to feel pride in ordering this DVD thinking he will receive something that makes Bush look smart, put it on, then realize he'd been had.  Again, the idea of pulling a joke on people looking for DVDs of Bush being smart will be had by this disc.

I don't understand the logic of this.  If neo-conservatives who want to support Bush by buying documentaries supporting him, this one doesn't really say anything about neo-conservatism, which is, to me, the real evil here.  Bush might look like an idiot and, with this DVD, betray a few neo-conservative idiots who think they are actually supporting Bush by buying documentaries that side with him, but Bush is not the issue that worries me and compels me to act.  Just because Bush is an easy target and because some harder neo-conservatives are abandoning Bush does not mean this movie is addressing any issues.  Bush being an idiot is only one issue, but it is an issue that doesn't relate to how neo conservatives will lie, cheat, steal, harass, and slander anyone who disagrees with them.  Bush is only after the fact.  He is just one idiot in line of several thieves; others are more secluded from easy targeting, and they too often escape.

If anyone wants to publish a DVD against Bush having real controversy, he should publish one that attacks neo-conservative principles of its fascism in selfish government.  Hit them where it hurts and take no prisoners.  This disc is merely a goofy joke doing almost nothing.  However, should I act alone in rating this disc two stars instead of the one star everyone else has given it, I would only do so because Bush is just another embedded tyrant.  But, this is not an excuse.  If I accept this as anything, it has to be in the likes of Dada or Pop Arts.  I'd have to be a retard to give this disc the unthinkable five stars.  I could give it to a friend who likes neo-conservatism, which would be my attempt to play a joke on someone else, but Bush is already an easy target.  Targeting Bush is to vent at neo-conservatives that Bush is the problem with neo-conservatism!",1167868800,2,2663,4.5
