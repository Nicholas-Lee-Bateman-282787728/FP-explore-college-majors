7870290,4,6304413432,"This 1987 production of Bellini's ""Il pirata,"" originally distributed by the Bel Canto Society (and now found on Premire Opera), is a remarkable find.  Produced by Italo Nunziata for the Festival della Valle d'Itria, and conducted by Alberto Zedda, it features Giorgio Surjan, Lucia Aliberti, Giuseppe Morino, Michele Farrugia, Pietro Spagnoli, and Adriana Molino.

There are two questionable elements to this presentation, however:  The picture is not clear, and no subtitles are available.  Nevertheless, the staging is simple and transparent, and the costuming has the ambiance of certain of Pier Paolo Pasolini's films.  A distinct advantage is, unlike their counterpoints in America, the cameras do not rely on multitudinous close-ups, which ruin the poetry, which rend the veil of theatrical mystery.

The casting is also felicitous.  Aliberti is a fascinating soprano.  Parts of her voice indeed sound like that of Maria Callas, particularly in the upper middle of her instrument, especially in descending scales.  But it is the voice of Callas in ""La sonnambula,"" not ""Mde"" or ""La Gioconda.""  She does not possess the ""scatto,"" the forceful attack, of the elder soprano.  If Callas had been a pushed-up mezzo-soprano, Aliberti is nothing of the sort, and has great ease on high.  Her pianissimi resemble, not those of Callas, but of Leyla Gencer.  She is wand-thin, moves well on stage, and is happily somewhat stylized.  The year following this production, Miss Aliberti debuted at the Metropolitan Opera in ""Lucia di Lammermoor,"" opposite Alfredo Kraus.

Morino is one of the great, underrated bel canto tenors of our time, and masterfully surmounts the difficult role of the pirate of the title.  Surjan also has a major voice, and Spagnoli (as the hermit Goffredo) is excellent.  Zedda conducts with welcomed energy, but allows the tired interpolated acuti at the end of almost every set piece.",1513728000,,1906,5.27906976744186
7870291,5,6304413432,"Aliberti owns this role.  She is wonderful throughout.  Morino is, as always, an acquired taste, but sings musically and with taste.  Zedda is one of the greatest conductors with total command of the material, perfect balances and lots of fire!  So what if the production is cheap....what an absurd criticism.  There is nothing wooden about the musical aspect of this production.",1454630400,,379,5.147540983606557
7870292,1,6304413432,"I couldn't play it. You should have known the PAL was unplayable in this country. The music played, but there was no picture.",1380672000,,125,4.478260869565218
7870293,1,6304413432,"Bellini's beautiful opera deserves much better. This production feels like a junior-high-school performance  that has had just one rehearsal. No sense of action, passion, drama. Much better to listen to Caballe sing it on a recording and imagine the stage. Tip-off:Audience sits on little fold-up chairs.",1122854400,5,304,5.608695652173913
