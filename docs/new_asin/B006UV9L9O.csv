5020333,2,B006UV9L9O,i bought this thinking it was genuine japanese erotica but its relatively ordinary r rated sexy movie.  a watered down version of the xxx rated version.  not recommend.,1360540800,,168,4.964285714285714
5020334,3,B006UV9L9O,"I lived in Japan for a few year and was exposed...even delighted in those days at the way Japanese sexploitation movies work.  First one must accept that no pubic hair (which was still in fashion when many of these movies were made) is to be seen nor are male...how shall we say?  members.  But everything else,  from the technical quality of the films to the attraciveness of the actresses (the actors are mostly props to keep the action moving)  to the types of sex portrayed.(e.g  usually a violent rape per movie) are arousing....at leat to me. In the scheme of things the Toyko train series  is typical  but not exceptional. For me  one should see  classics like ""Debauchery""  or even ""Female TEacher....(Dirty Afteroon) to see what I'd consider to be 4 or even 5 star examples of this genre.\",1359849600,11,798,4.669064748201439
5020335,3,B006UV9L9O,This video is more of a documentary of what not to do on a train than anything else.  Not at all what I thought it may be.,1353715200,,122,3.5185185185185186
5020336,1,B006UV9L9O,"Yes, I own multiple Japanese DVD and this one right on the bottom of everything. It tries to repeat Pink Eiga movies but most important part--imagination is missing. I can recommend The glamorous life of Sachiko Hanai if you are in the mood for real imagination or stick to internet where multiple web sites give everything for free.",1350000000,3,333,4.758620689655173
5020337,4,B006UV9L9O,"Carrying on the time honored  'tradition' of the 'Groper Train' franchise of Japanerotica based on the fantasy of 'guys molesting gurlz' on the ultra crowded Japanese commuter trains during rush hour - Tokyo Erotique Video has rolled out (to date) 4 new titles that feature this 'rude' premise as part of their plot line.  Having enjoyed a couple of the 'old school' versions, ie: ""Groper Train: Search for the Black Pearl"" I ordered the first two flix in this 'new' series to check them out.

These DVDs (at least the 2 I watched) both start off w/ the lead actress of the piece introducing the video w/ a sweetly self effacing disclaimer about their 'acting skills' and the ernest declaration that they ""gave their 'all', and did their best"" to entertain us!  One really has to appreciate this general 'attitude' by Japanese Pink actresses - especially when the 'action' in the flik gets into some rigorous bondage scenes (which, BTW, this flik doesn't) - their ""I'll do anything to please you"" approach is decidedly endearing and part of what creates the 'mystique' of the Asian woman that has fascinated Western men over the years.

All that aside - I found ""Tokyo Train Girls: 2 - Super Vixen""  to be a fun, if pretty light weight, viewing experience.  The stand-out feature is definitely the attractiveness of the starring actress ( Risa Kasumi ) in this one - she is a knock-out!  The plot revolves around young wife 'Ayumi's' growing misgivings about her marriage to a 'depraved' husband who likes to spice up their sex life with kinky sexual scenarios.  These include the titular 'public'  train based fondling, some 'soft' ""9 1/2 Weeks"" style bondage games at home, and even an  'orchestrated rape' of his own wife by another guy so he can video-tape the event, as well as a lot of fooling around with other women (including his wife's best GF!).

The original release date on this DVD was 2008 and the current technique of 'filming' directly onto hi def digital media is employed - which gives the product more of a 'video' than 'film' quality. This presents a very sharp image but some of the atmospheric ambience that actual film provides is lost.  There is a 'low budget' feel to the overall piece and not a lot of interesting 'plot' elements to lift it above a rather mundane feeling soft core sex flik (the 'older' Groper Train flix had some cleverness & comedic elements within their prurient plots).  The 'sex' is, as noted, soft core - lotsa heaving bosoms and groping over pantyhose & panty covered pussies - but no full nudity or anything truly hard-core - but also no annoying 'fogging' censoring. Perhaps because of their strict censorship laws the Japanese ero-directors have become masters at the art of 'inferred' kink and so, even without full XXX action, they manage to provide a very titillating viewing experience.

In the final analysis, I found ""Tokyo Train Girls-2...""  to be OK - but a little sparse in production values -  most of the appeal rested on the attractiveness of its' actresses - which was considerable (Ayumi's shower sequence was a stand-out!) - the play time is a typically short 75 min. - the only 'extras' on the disc are a few 'stills' from the show and an 'illustrated list' of other DVDs offered by the distributors.",1341360000,14,3270,4.75929203539823
5020338,5,B006UV9L9O,"Apparently, this is the express train, 'cause 30 seconds into this gem and our lovely heroine is being feverishly fondled in a heavily populated train car. The guy lifts her skirt, gropes her ample attributes, even unzips his trousers and slides her hand inside so she can get him off while unknowing passengers pay no mind. We later find out it's her husband, a deviant whose degeneracy know no bounds.

So starts 'Tokyo Train Girls 2 - Supervixen', a hopped-up soft-core-on-steroids extravaganza that's a must-see/own for gluttonous fans of the perverse. The female lead (Risa Kasumi) is an adorable looker with a killer all-natural figure and watching her is a joy to behold. She's sexy, not cute, like a lot of Asian leads, and exudes all things erotic. This flick (along w/ the first volume - there are four - read my reviews) is far better than any release on the Pink Eiga label...

Light on dialogue and long on lewdness, it's one sex scene after another, well-shot and from the proper POV for this genre of film. It's not one of those flicks you cringe sitting through waiting for the naughty bits, here you're treated to more train-molestation, shower scenes, a bondage scene w/an ice cube from '9 1/2 Weeks'(only better), some S+M, more train-groping, public restroom sex, various infidelities and a rape scene petitioned by her sleazoid hubby caught on video.

After he rapes her, the 'delivery man' states ""You need to keep your door secure"" as he walks out. Now that's cold. Vengeance comes swiftly (no pun intended) during the last few minutes of this filth-fest, and the final scene on the train is priceless. If you ever visit Japan, be certain to take public transportation... All Aboard!",1333238400,30,1706,4.855670103092783

8504819,5,B006UV9L9O,"If you like cute Japanese girls that don't really have acting skills but look great on camera then this is the movie for you.  If you have the ""yellow fever"" or worse ""plaque"" then super great movie also.  However, although it kind of comes across as a skin flick it's not really porn.  It's more along the lines of what you would see on ""showtime"" or ""hbo"" late at night.  A little different plot of course because of the culture and the running theme through all of this series is that these are women that you would see on a train going to work and of course the Japanese men are all creeps copping feels and throwing these girls into a horrible dilemma trying to figure out whether to go along with it or not.  Regardless, the story line is sub-par at best and as stated before the acting is by no means moving, but it's entertaining if you're just looking for something to do...er watch.",1365638400,3,892,4.349397590361446
