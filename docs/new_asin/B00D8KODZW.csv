8590605,3,B00D8KODZW,"Bought this DVD and another Pete Morrison movie for my Dad and he enjoyed them.  If you know a man in his 90's he will probably remember Pete as one of the earliest cowboy heroes from the silent movie era.  Another bonus:  You don't have to worry about closed captioning for an elderly viewer.  Since it is a silent film, it comes with its own closed captioning.  This is one of the later silent films featuring concerns about railroads and oil drilling instead of cowboy, villains and rancher themes.  A word of caution though--These films are racist in their depiction of Asian and African Americans or, in other words, welcome to America in the 1920's and 30's.  Historically, I found them very interesting.  The racial ""humor"" in these movies doesn't even register initially as an attempt at humor today.  However imperfect our society is now, it does illustrate how far we've come in the last 100 years.",1403222400,,908,4.732484076433121
