3829682,5,B001YMDCE4,"A movie recounting a newly diagnosed cancer, with a new timeframe for Ben's lifespan. What transpires is what some find irresponsible, or selfish. However to Ben it gives his life the meaning whose discovery, up until now,  he has been postponing.

I watched it once, and the let my teen watch it with me the second time. It has a 'Into the Wild"" movie flavor to it.",1248566400,3,366,4.447761194029851
3829683,5,B001YMDCE4,"I am not Canadian, nor is my store in Canada, but I still thought this was a great Canadian travel film. This was one of the more realistic cancer films I have seen in a bit, and (I feel) not worthy of the hate club that campaigns against it.

Simply put, it is a film about a man who travels across his country after being diagnosed with a terminal illness. Like other good travel films, we see a sampling of the beautiful country that Canada has to offer, we encounter every-day personalities of people along the way and we learn a few lessons about ourselves and what life might be about. The difference here is that we get a insightful narration by Campbell Scott (most recognized of late with his role in Phoebe in Wonderland), which in itself provided some nice laugh-out-loud moments.

I laughed at unexpected moments, saw some incredible Canadian scenery, and did not feel anything was contrived or cardboard (as most complainants have stipulated). The special features give this four-star film a five. The low-def ""Making-of"" contained just the right amount of logistical material on production, the commentary and interviews provide plenty of information for the followers and the remaining HD gallery, after party and trailer add just the right amount of extras to show the fun side of this film.

The Blu quality is slightly better than the DVD, but there is still plenty of grain and and (very minute) random artifact. The grandiose panoramas could have been a bit clearer, the DTS was never fully utilized, even with the plethora of songs, but the presentation was still adequate. Not a reference Blu, but the film and special features make this a higher rating.",1245974400,40,1676,4.8125

3829685,1,B001YMDCE4,I did not realize it was a European version since it was combined with the US usable versions. Not pleased. I've seen the movie on Netflix and enjoyed it very much but not pleased with this purchase.,1485216000,,199,4.405405405405405
3829686,5,B001YMDCE4,"The film wastes no time.  It opens with Ben Tyler; a teacher being told by his doctor that he has a particularly aggressive form of cancer.  It has spread and immediate treatment is required.  However, even then, his chances will be 1 in 10 and the maximum survival will probably be 2 years.

Interestingly, a few people made note about the next scene which shows Bens fantasy reaction to this news.  Some found this scene disturbing.  I think it is a realistic immediate ""come to mind"" thought reaction to the news and what he faces.

On the way home, he meets a man who is selling his Norton motorcycle and, on impulse, Ben buys the motorcycle.  He wants to take a two-day trip, and then return for treatment.  At home, his fianc (he is to be married in 3 months) objects to his waiting to begin treatment.  But Ben begins to realize that he has lived a safe life, mostly based on the opinions of others.  (Back to his fianc:  she loves Ben and, though she objects to a trip given his diagnosis, she does not give Ben more of a hard time than to be expected with the sudden news.

Ben wants answers.  He starts out by looking for a Grumps which is a character from a story his father used to tell him.  Finding a Grumps will bring good fortune.  He also checks the Tim Hortons coffee cup for his fortune.  Ben is grasping at straws and it was a Tim Horton coffee cup that told him go West.

His trip takes him from Toronto to Vancouver Island.  Along the way, he meets various people.  The trip is not without some difficulties.  His bike won't start at one point, but a woman whose dog he found, helps him get the bike back to her farm where a minor fix gets him back on his way.  Ben is trying things he has never done before to live the life he thinks he has missed out on.

At one point Ben decides its time to return but a chance encounter with two young men who are biking tells him that his trip should continue.  He has centered his trip West around the visits to towns that boast of having the biggest hockey stick or fire hydrant and other tourist attractions.

As he nears the Pacific, Samantha flies out to see him.  But he has stayed out all night to be with a woman he has just met.  Samantha is less angry than expected to discover Ben has been with someone, mostly because she is truly more concerned about his returning for treatments than about his cheating.  She loves Ben and his coming home is more important, for the present, than his cheating on her.  It can wait -- the treatment cannot.

Ben makes it to Vancouver Island where his bike is mangled by a truck which ran it over in a parking lot.  Ben is becoming symptomatic.  With no bike, he decides to go surfing but instead of surfing he takes the board out as far as he can paddle.  He believes he has seen his Grumps.  Ben returns home where he and his fianc agree to cancel the wedding, and Ben goes home to his parents and sister.

These encounters with strangers during the trip have helped Ben in his quest to make every day a lifetime.  However, what is less obvious is how Bens being has brought good fortune to others.  Since he did not start his treatment the first day, the medical professional with whom he had his appointment for a first treatment got to leave early that day.  She took the earlier train home, missing a tragic derailment in which she would have been killed had she not been able to take the early train.  The rancher who helps Ben fix his bike has not had much contact with her son in several years. Her conversations with Ben about her son and grandchild make her decide to see her son that next weekend where she meets the true love of her life.

My one disagreement with the story is about settling. Ben has spent his life settling for less  a job teaching uninspired students and is unfulfilling.  His belief he could not sing, and giving up.  He gave up his writing to teach.  That is also implied in his relationship with Samantha.  And here I think the character was written as unrealistic about love and marriage and what constitutes settling.  No relationship stays the same all throughout.  As Ben said he would have been content to sit in a diner with Samantha reading newspapers with her forever.  That is not settling.  There is the grass is always greener fallacy.  However, for the purposes of the story, it is presented that Samantha truly loves Ben  more than he loved her.

Some have described the movie as ""sad.""  After the obvious sadness over a man being given a grim diagnosis, I found this to be an uplifting movie about the courage to change.  To leave off what is comfortable and safe.  In the face of his adversity, he became the man he was meant to be all the time.  A life well lived.

Credit must be given to the music and the Canadian scenery.

Last, the film is heavily narrated, though the film is also played out by the characters.  The end reveals the narrator.

I would have given this movie more than 5 stars.  Its easy to miss the nuances of Bens personal journey without seeing it again.",1484611200,2,5035,4.343716433941998

3829717,5,B001YMDCE4,"One of my favorites.  A movie about motorcycle travel across beautiful country dealing with a number of human conditions that center around one man facing the end of his life.  If you're looking for action, sex, lots of drama, vulgarity (you know, the stuff 99% of movies are made of these days), well, you won't find it here. This is more like a slice of life and reality while the lead actor deals with his imminent death.  As far as the comments here by Christian reviewers, as a Christian myself, I didn't find if offensive. It wasn't meant to be a Christian film so get over it (I'm sure Jesus would have understood the feelings the lead character was dealing with).  I found it real, earthy, and inspiring.",1413676800,,712,4.5390625
3829718,5,B001YMDCE4,"This was a serendipitous film for 2 expat Canadians to stumble upon while looking for a way to celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday. It brought tears to my eyes on a couple different levels.

It's a true homage. The beautiful vistas and Canadian references provoked many warm smiles. Joshua Jackson shines as an uncertain, repressed, yet yearning protagonist. The strong contradiction of being raised in a content, conservative culture, but also in a country that allows for so much freedom and potential, is something to which many Canadians can relate.

It could even be seen as a subtle political statement: a portrait of a maturing country unsure of its current direction, too timid/apathetic to realize its ideals. I only hope we as a country can be strong in identity and path before things get dire and we end up hurting others... amoung other unintended consequences. Canada has the capacity to be extraordinary, it is apparent to most anyone. But also to be selfish and indulgent. One only hopes enough Canadians kissing the Stanley Cup is enough for the cancers to be kept at bay and, perhaps more importantly, that our explorers don't shrink from rejection.

So the film was great food for thought this Thanksgiving. Both superficial and deep ways to appreciate the country. Much gratitude to makers of this film, it really is a beautiful piece of art.",1413331200,,1361,4.9605263157894735

3829721,5,B001YMDCE4,"Poignant and memorable.  Great performance by Joshua Jackson who plays a man who just discovers he has terminal cancer and, rather than starting treatment, decides to go on a motorcycle ride across Canada to discover himself.  Considering the dark material, it's a beautiful film that's a celebration of life.  This movie probably does need need a warning for the people who might be in a vulnerable mental state, but for the rest of us, it should give us pause to consider maybe doing just one adventure to discover who we are and what our life means to us, and to the rest of the world.  I also loved the scene with the Mighty Ducks player who got to take the Stanley Cup home that Jackson runs into along the way.

3829725,3,B001YMDCE4,"I suppose Im not being a loyal Canadian when I observe that the camera makes Joshua Jackson, all 6-2 of him, look jowly and dowdy in a motorcycle helmet. I realize the movie wasn't about trying to make Pacey look hunky or sexy but the camera did him no favours. He tends more toward double chin than jutting jawline and high cheekbones. Hes an everyman hero.

Has anyone ever sat through an entire directors commentary? Id like to hear about the location of some of those over-sized monuments but Im not prepared to listen to him drone on for 90 minutes to find out. In my travels Ive seen more than a few of them. A pity the film editor couldn't have used a map to make sure they appeared in geographical order. The country is big enough without having the traveler drive 300 miles out of his way to stop at a motel in another province hes already passed.

I was dozing when the Mighty Ducks won the Stanley Cup. I drove by Terry Fox just a few miles before he ended his run in Thunderbay. I turned off the highway to visit Ouimet Canyon and followed a Harley Davidson Goldwing along the dirt woods road that then led to the site. I camped that night in Port Arthur and it rained on my tent.",1400803200,,1192,4.269911504424779

This is not a short attention span movie, like so many are these days, there are no explosions, no nudity etc.. it doesn't need them.  Those things would cheapen it.

3829772,4,B001YMDCE4,"I stumbled onto this little film completely by accident -- and it was a happy accident indeed, because it's far more entertaining & thought-provoking than most big-budget films. While it begins with a familiar premise -- its protagonist discovers he has cancer & very little chance of survival, so he hits the road on a motorcycle to sort it all out -- the film has a deadpan, self-deflating sense of humor that lends it a different, fresher tone. The narration by Campbell Scott is a wonderful counterpoint to what we see onscreen, adding dimension to this journey of self-discovery.

Joshua Jackson is very good as the seemingly doomed Ben Tyler, avoiding bathos while offering moments of genuine emotion. Also enjoyable are the moments which tell us how his momentary presence in other people's lives along the road change them forever, reminding us that we all have the potential to affect our world, often without ever realizing what we've done for others. While we've seem some of this in other films, it still works well.

Jackson's true co-star is Canada itself. I've never been there, and of course I missed a lot of cultural references ... but the film makes me want to visit such beautiful country someday. It may not be a great film, but I found much to admire & even love while watching it.

The story has got a good premise, something that could resound with anyone. (It's the what-if situation where something unexpected happens and turns your life upside down. Which is then followed by the inevitable journey of self discovery and what's the meaning of life.) It wasn't a horrible movie, just different. The narrator's voice is a bit jarring at times compared to the slow, gradual pace of the movie. I know it was shot in Canada, but you don't have to be a Canadian to appreciate the landscape and scenery. If you're looking to watch it, I would try and rent it first if you can.

It has as much to say about how we live... How we settle or compromise to the point that we may not even really be living our own lives after all.

My two main issues with this movie (because there were more) is lack of chemistry between Ben and his girlfriend and then there's the narrator... who talks to much. Not good. Had there been some interesting people he met along the way I could have forgiven the gf issue, but that didn't happen. And had Joshua Jackson been able to get a word in edgewise maybe we would have felt more for the characters, but I'm pretty sure he couldn't even save this film.",1353888000,,664,4.588235294117647

3829790,5,B001YMDCE4,"Those fateful words changed our lives.  My husband had experienced death, about 5 minutes, the week before at the hands of a local medical team when they flushed his electrolytes too low using IV Lasix.  Instead of coming clean and helping us move forward, the SSM staff seemingly teamed up in unison trying to persuade us it was his heart while trying to manipulate and coerce us into further medical ""intervention"" while cajoling us with their Fear Factor. When I was fighting to get him released, the electro physiologist assured me that I ""did not understand this is a matter of life and death"" then proceeded to inform me my husband ""will be dead within 2 weeks, probably a few days.""

Instead I took my husband home, learned how to strengthen his heart naturally via following the supplement protocols in Sinatra Solution and we overhauled our lifestyle, together. Importantly we realized we only live once, we never know when the final day will be, so we began living in the moment. We also decided to remove ourselves from toxic people and organizations. We fired his doctors and medical staff.

That incident was nearly FIVE years ago in MARCH 2008. I write this review as we are watching One Week, together, in August 2012. Not only have we reversed his heart disease, we cured his type 2 diabetes. All while living for the moment and NOT depriving him of his favorite meals.  We found the truth of the medical mafia and realized there are plenty of other options than what mainstream medicine has to offer.

As the movie states, living in the moment , pursuing your dreams and doing what is right for the individual is what matters.  Following doctors with their toxic protocols that have a *guarantee* of serious adverse side effects is not for everyone.

The question ""what would you do if you have one week to live?"" Is something we all should ask of ourselves - each and every week. Search for the moments.

What WOULD you do if you have one week to live?

Does treatment truly make sense?

Does doing what everyone else wants- to be a patient- instead of fighting for life make sense?

My friend is dieing of cancer; she's chosen mainstream medicine... and is miserable, is having complications from treatment of the complications of the treatment and overall is very miserable. It pains me greatly watching her daily blog of the trauma she is enduring to her body- even after the doctors have told her they do NOT have any treatment to cure her cancer nor to even extend her life.
As the movie implies, simply.... Life IS the moments... live life for the moments. ;-)

What would you do if you knew you only had a week to live? Based on the taglines alone I was worried about viewing this movie. I was quite pleasantly surprised. One Week is a beautiful simple film about discovering what's really important in life. Ben Tyler, portrayed with depth & grace by Joshua Jackson, has been diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. His reaction to this life altering news is not to jump immediately into treatment, instead he chooses to purchase a (beautiful) vintage motorcycle & head out across Canada. He takes a trek of self discovery from Toronto in the East all the way West to Tofino on Vancouver Island. This surprisingly uplifting film is both a study on the human condition & a love letter to Canada itself. The breathtaking scenery is a character all its own & the soundtrack of wonderful Canadian talent flows elegantly throughout. The ending is just ambiguous enough for you to draw your own conclusions.

I didn't find the narrator intrusive at all, as some have felt. I'm normally one of those guys who find it really hard to sit still for a whole movie and most lose me less than 10 minutes in.

The narration ties up nicely at the end. Wonderful photography. Not a ""tissue"" movie, no tearjerking moments, for me at least. Quite satisfied with the time spent.

I would DEFINITELY recommend this to people who are into film that is made to question the things we not only take for granted, but also just assume we want due too society's standards.

I'm not from Canada, nor have I ever been there, but after watching this movie, I really hope to some day get to experience all the scenic beauty of it. I would even myself like to do it by motorcycle.

I read most of the critiques people had AGAINST this film, and I'm not sure any of them actually held the merit of the film accountable. So far, the majority of complaints have been about the fact that some American actors were used. If that type of thing bothers you, then you must not understand the actual concept of acting and probably should just quit watching movies altogether. Another complaint has been that their was too much narration. I personally found that the narration added a unique dimension of flat humor and brought a quality of storytelling that allowed me to help relate more to Joshua Jackson's portrayal of the main character.

As I stated in the beginning, the only real deficit to this film was the hipster/indie feel. They tried to sometimes fit in poorer quality handheld shots and rough transitions to give it a bit more of an edgy touch, but it wasn't necessary as it drew away, in my opinion, from the emotional experience.

In all, I would keep this on my shelf next to other selections, like ""The Lucky Ones"", ""Into The Wild"" and ""The Motorcycle Diaries""... I liked that much!

Hope this was helpful.

3829817,5,B001YMDCE4,"People actually hate this movie? I find it charming, touching, filled with moments of introspection and wondering about the world around us. A closer reexamination of all we thought about ourselves and how life shaped us to think wrongly in a negative way about ourselves. I love how it shows the 4th grade teacher tearing up his musical gift because she had an ax to grind. And how the nurse just made the train because she power-walked and got on the train just before the one that was going to derail if she'd dawdled. We never know how our choices affect others in these ways.

I love how the woman with the horse ranch is stirred by Ben's visit and it prompts her to go visit her son, which leads her to cross paths with the love of her life. There's a lot of ""good karma"" in this movie. I wish there really was a book because I'd surely read it.

I've watched this movie again and again (Thank you, Netflix!) I love it and never grow tired of it. The soundtrack is perfect and it's just such a wonderful story of a young man faced with choices that would be next to impossible for anyone of his age to bear. He chose to take a drive, after reading ""Go west, young man"" on a coffee cup.

I love even that detail of the film. He's a ""nihilist"" or agnostic but all through the film, you can see God's hand in his life. Leading him and causing him to stir things up in others who are also in His care.

Don't listen to the bad reviews. I love this movie and I'll keep watching it. When it's no longer available on Netflix, I'll go ahead and buy it on Amazon or something. It really helped me to see how little difference there is between Americans and Canadians.

Thank you, those who made the film, did such a great job acting in it, and those who performed the soundtrack. It's entirely a lovely film and I hope many others view and experience it. It's well worth the time.",1323907200,4,1877,4.246498599439776

3829819,5,B001YMDCE4,"I just finished watching the movie on Netflix and have added it to my wishlist here on Amazon.  Although at times I thought Campbell Scott's narration was a little tedious by the end it became very clear how important it was to the movie and I got over it.

I won one battle with cancer about 15 years ago and I am now waging my second.  I completely understand the main character's need to go on the run for awhile.  There are certain events in a person's life where the need to be alone is is often a person's best course.  A terminal cancer diagnosis, a divorce, a death in the family are all times when a person needs to have time to evaluate what it all means and to try to make decisions about his or her future.  Does the person go on a bender and stay drunk for awhile?  Does he or she seek counsel from friends, family, clergy, shrink?  Does the person go on a quest to complete their bucket list?  In the movie his choice was to take a motorcycle trip to help him decide his next move.  The decision to get treatment was his and his alone.  His diagnosis was terminal.  All of the sympathy in the world from family and friends was not going to make the situation go away.  Some of the reviewers thought he was being selfish.  His fiance and family were the selfish ones.  It was his life and he had to face it in his own way.  This was also a trip of discovery wherein he found that he didn't really love his fiance and to continue with her would have led to a life of misery.  She was very regimented in her life, clinging to routine.  He wasn't and didn't.  She would have loved him to the end but, as was pointed out in the movie, his love for her was waning, something he discovered during his travels.  There would have been no happily ever after ending here.

We don't know if kissing the Stanley Cup or finally seeing the (his) Grump led to a miraculous recovery nor do we know if he got treatment.  We know he lived long enough to write his book.

I took no offense to Christ giving him the finger.  He had no relationship with the church and, later after he had received his diagnosis, I'm sure he felt that God and his surrogate had given him the finger.  I know I felt that way when I had my first cancer diagnosis and I still feel that way the second time around.

Overall I thought the movie was excellent and I will watch it again.",1323388800,,2355,4.1662971175166295

3829827,5,B001YMDCE4,"Despite complaints about the depiction of Jesus, I found myself very drawn to the guy, who bravely seemed to know what he needed to do, once he finally had a reason to have to face his truth--there's nothing like having a terminal condition to force one to re-evaluate their reality, their relationships, etc.
I understand people who have come to blame God for their misfortunes-the bible says that a fool perverts his own way, but his heart frets against the Lord. So, it's human nature--when he actually meets Jesus, he'll finally find out that He is the kindest, most loving friend anyone could ever have.
So, I appreciated the process we witnessed of his resoluteness to go his own way in the face of extreme family/fiance' pressure, and of how he seemed to be able to give himself permission to live for himself for once in his life--I wonder how that feels....
And, in the end,this turned out to be the best thing for his fiance', who needed to face her own truth and learn his truth.
I myself am slowing learning that when I do what's right for me, it turns out to be what was right for the other person involved as well. It's still hard to do!

I liked the acting of the main character. I think he did a great job, of making it all seem believable. Whoever wrote the story, didn't go crazy with what the guy did in his actions. He made it all seem in the realm of possibility.

If I could go back and undo my watching of this? Get back my time, would I? No I would not. It was worth the time and money.

I'm curious about the ending though, because their is a lot of foreshadowing through out the movie. . . And the fact, something came out that you didn't see the main guy work on while he was on his journey.

3829839,4,B001YMDCE4,"I've always liked Joshua Jackson as an actor, but most movies he's done have been pretty much total crap. One Week is an exception.

This is a ""subtle"" film, the type you might watch and go ""What was the point of that?"" before it hits you later. (Sort of like a Canadian Elizabethtown.) It's also quintessentially Canadian, which likely means you'll either love it or hate it (Tim Hortons, hockey folklore, breathtaking scenery, whales and all).

Much of the cinematography has a documentary feel. Most of the film appears to have been shot handheld, but it fits the story nicely without being obtrusive (in other words, you don't come away feeling like it was just shot handheld because the filmmakers couldn't afford a tripod). The folksy soundtrack and score are also very well-done.

This isn't a blockbuster by any means, but it's a solid movie. Jackson is excellent, but Liane Balaban's supporting performance as Jackson's fiancee was a little week, IMHO. She wasn't really bad, she just didn't bring much life to her character whereas Jackson's character was easy to connect with.

The film is sentimental, to be sure, yet evades mawkishness through the quality of its writing (particularly the often witty narration perfectly voiced by Campbell Scott), its restrained performances (notably by lead Joshua Jackson who manages to give stoic blandness a quality both quietly heroic and quite appealing), and the magnificent beauty of the Canadian landscape. This is not a film that could have been churned out in the U.S. where pretension is often mistaken for art and imitation is the sincerest form of greed. Its artless humanity and understated touchingness (a step above pathos) have a distinctly Canadian flavor. It's the sort of film to enjoy in solitude on a 'hooky' day, a lazy weekday morning when you shirk your responsibilities for a couple of hours and succumb to your stifled emotions - not a guilty pleasure, just a very personal one.

3829852,5,B001YMDCE4,"Ben Tyler discovers at the beginning of the film that he has a short time to live and despite the urgings of his fiancee and family to enter treatment immediately, he heads out on the road on a motorcycle. He takes photos of himself at man-made and natural landmarks, he meets people along the way who give him insights such as ""if you need to ask if you are really in love, you aren't,"" and ""I work the ranch without making enough money because there are other kinds of payments.""

The other kinds of payments are hard to put into words. Things like being in contact with the wide open beauty of the land, or surfing, or enjoying the company of others.

It is a complex film that captures the feeling of settling for second best, of believing what people tell you about yourself, and then discovering they were wrong.

As a Canadian I identified strongly with Ben's journey. He has a romantic core, wants to instill some passion in his bored students -- but fails; he is unassuming and undemanding and states that if he could read the paper and drink coffee with his fiancee at their favorite coffee shop for the rest of his life, that would be enough; and Ben's journey is realistic -- the most danger he encounters is getting drowsy and skidding out of control on a squashed skunk. He wakes in the ditch with nothing broken and tries to dance and celebrate, but that is not his style. He is uncomfortable with too much outward exuberance. The real story is going on inside.

Ben is perhaps not a typical Canadian, but he is ""my"" kind of Canadian, and so I was cheering for him - quietly, in my head, while I sipped tea and though of having a Tim Horton's donut. You see there is a kind of rebellious streak in Ben that I like, he is finding his identity after all, but his rebellion leads towards insight, not violence or crime or block busting. He takes the world as it is, noticing, accepting. Even if the giant chair or moose or giant ""whatever"" is less than wonderful -- he smiles at them.

There is a self deprecating humour about all this, a kind of ""lets not get too excited -- or too disappointed"" attitude that sounds boring when you say it, but works so well in the film -- and in life really. Life is what it is, after all, even with cancer. So in good Canadian style Ben wakes up (literally and metaphorically) and goes home to his family.
