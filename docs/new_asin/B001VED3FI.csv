3821376,5,B001VED3FI,"I have bought just about every MMA dvd out there, and this one is by far the best. Unlike many DVDs, the techniques and footwork Lyoto shares are the ones he actually uses in his fights. Funny, I bought this DVD before his fight with Rashad Evans, and I saw him use the exact techniques that he showed on the DVDs. To top it off, the DVDs were done in high definition, have multiple camera angles, and they very high production quality. A must for anyone who wants to improve their game.",1243382400,8,487,4.304347826086956
3821377,5,B001VED3FI,I have studied Shotokan Karate for over 20+ years and I purchased this box set right away.  I was not for a minute disappointed.  It has absolutely everything for you to learn new techniques never seen before in another other Shotokan/MMA or Martial Arts DVD.  The action sequences are in real-time and you get a real sense of how to develop sen training using a vareity of applications.  By far the best tape is the third tape where they get into interseption and sennosen training.  It really brings karate back into the original jujitsu.,1243296000,9,540,4.702127659574468

8346110,3,B001VED3FI,"There is some wonderful content in this comprehensive 4-DVD set; however, there are also a lot of impractical techniques.

Machida offers some higly valuable information on basic, yet often-overlooked, elements of the MMA game: stance, balance, footwork and linear, non-telegraphed striking.  As another reviewer has mentioned, these are the very techniques and attributes that he's used to become a champion.

However, on the first two discs he also offers a whole slew of techniques and combinations that are rarely used in MMA competition.

The 4th disc on the ground game is a VERY elementary primer on Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.  Anyone with any kind of jiu-jitsu experience will find nothing new.  Although, it must be said that most of the techniques on this disc have at least proven their value in actual MMA competition.

The best disc in the set from front to back is the 3rd disc on intercepting attacks, distance, timing, the clinch game and takedowns.  Here Machida really shows the viewer what has made him a champion, as the entire disc is packed with techniques that are slightly unorthodox, yet simple and practical.

This 4-DVD set would be much improved by being cut down to 2 discs - the price could also comfortably be halved.  Yet if you are a true MMA nut like I am, you will be very satisfied with the many gems of wisdom this set offers, even if you wish you didn't have to pick through quite so much roughage to find them.",1261785600,9,1443,4.782258064516129
8346111,5,B001VED3FI,"This DVD is well worth getting. Lyoto Machida is a world class fighter so learn from the best!

8346113,5,B001VED3FI,"This is a very good DVD set that you won't regret buying. When I saw it was on sale I bought it through Amazon via Iphone just before getting on an airplane. I didn't want to delay getting my hands on it for an instant.

If you do Shotokan or ITF TKD you will be surprised by how much of the traditional footwork is part of Machida's game. He will remind you how important the basics are in the first DVD.

Footwork and combo DVDs are very good and he holds nothing back. Then he shows the sweeps that he has used very effectively in his MMA career. The footwork and sweeps were probably my favorite part.

He also does some groundwork, but that is the weakest part of the DVD set. It is basically a bunch of techniques thrown together. That being said they are good techniques (I've actually used one of his triangle escapes and he used it to escape from Ortiz's triangle in their match). But because it isn't put forth in a lesson plan the techniques are not too useful unless you have some groundwork as a foundation. He did a much better job at organizing the other stuff he covers in previous DVDs.

I am very happy with this set and I think it is a steal at the current price. I have many other instructionals that I loan out...but not the Machida set. Those stay in my library! :)",1252022400,2,1287,4.240816326530612

Volume 1
Movement and Fundamental Strikes
 Marc Wickert May 8, 2009
w[...]

One thing that makes Lyoto Machida so unique in the world of mixed martial arts is that he has risen to the top whilst using a traditionally-based martial arts system.

Lyoto commences Volume 1with basic stretching exercises before using his brother Chinzo Machida to demonstrate the below techniques.  `The Dragon' also spars with Chinzo at the end of each strike segment to illustrate how he puts it all together in free-flowing combos.

As with all Victory Belt books, all techniques are displayed from a variety of angles for more clarity.

* Movement: Shows the viewer how to develop a practical base, to make the movements flow freely, and how to close the gap when attacking.  Being able to switch stance from orthodox to southpaw and to launch strikes from both stances is recommended.  Pivoting whilst attacking, defending and counterattacking is demonstrated.

* Kicks:  A wide variety of kicking weapons are illustrated.  Lyoto shows how to use one's legs for defense by keeping opponents at a distance through powerful kicks and the use of evasive pivoting and cutting angles.  He showcases kicks on mitts, focus pads, Thai pads and whilst sparring, and explains the best method to set up decoy strikes before landing devastating kicks.  This section also reveals how to set up sweeps when one's opponent is most vulnerable.

* Punches: Lyoto possesses an extensive arsenal of punches and he shows  what part of the hand to impact with in order to maximize damage delivered whilst minimizing damage to one's hand.  Other techniques include: maintaining an effective guard, faking strikes to set up bigger punches, correct posture when delivering punches, and punch and kick combos.  Machida then demonstrates how to deliver explosive finishing punches.

* Elbows: A wide variety of elbow techniques are illustrated from an even wider variety of angles.  The viewer is shown the best methods for unleashing long-range and close-range elbow strikes, juicy targets to zone in on, how to set up spinning elbows, as well as employing elbows for attacking, defending, counterattacking, and countering kicks with elbows.

* Knees: Machida explains the difference between good and bad knees, then reveals how to set up knee strikes, tactics to close the gap before delivering the strikes, and the best ways to combine other strikes with knees.  Flying knees and clinching to unload knees are also demonstrated before Lyoto mixes it up in a sparring session with Chinzo while incorporating all of the above techniques.

* Katas: Machida performs four katas that are both strenuous workouts and include powerhouse strikes and blocks.  The last two katas are more complex and are shown at both normal speed and in slow motion.

And this is all on the first disc!

LYOTO MACHIDA
Volume 2
Striking Attacks and Takedowns
 Marc Wickert May 15, 2009
[...]

In Volume 1 Lyoto Machida began fusing his wide variety of strikes together to create destructive combos, and in Volume 2 he weaves together more powerhouse combos that are suitable for both MMA competition and street defense.

Again, as with all Victory Belt books, all techniques on this DVD are displayed from a variety of angles for complete clarity.

* Break and Enter: Lyoto shows how to break an opponent's guard and provide a corridor for unloading strikes.  He then demonstrates the use of decoy tactics to set up primary hits, the use of low and high kicks, and combos incorporating all weapons earlier employed.

* Combos:  Machida serves up more combos here than a Chinese chow mein restaurant, including attacks to the body and head, fighting same-stance opponents, fighting opposite-stance opponents, and correct positioning of shoulders to avoid telegraphing one's strikes.

* Mixed Bag: Lyoto reveals a variety of offensive sequences whilst altering the speed of strikes and the height of the targets he zones in on to keep his opponent on edge and guessing.  Other areas covered are attacking off centerline and the use of closing distance with combos, which are particularly effective against adversaries with a reach advantage.

* Mind Game Techniques: Here Machida unlocks a vault of sneaky tactics to disrupt an opponent's focus and unsettle his balance.  He also incorporates blinding decoy strikes to set up heavier shots and maneuvers that distract and confuse the enemy before punishing them with power blows.

* Pad Drills: Lyoto works with his brother, Chinzo, to illustrate 10 focus-pad drills and 11 Thai-pad drills for the viewer to practice.  The pair also covers hand-trapping sweeps, and scoop sweeps against same-stance opponents and opposite-stance opponents.

* Machida Medley: Lyoto and Chinzo perform a medley of all of the above techniques to showcase their unique methods of combining devastating firepower with debilitating takedowns.

Although this DVD represents one disc from the 4 DVD Box Set, all four volumes are interrelated and blend perfectly to reveal the secrets of one of MMA's most destructive gladiators.

LYOTO MACHIDA
Volume 3
Intercepting Attacks, Takedown Defense, & The Clinch
 Marc Wickert May 20, 2009
[...]

In Volumes 1and 2 Lyoto Machida focuses a lot on the dynamics involved in delivering crushing strikes.  Volume 3 flows on from the previous DVDs, explaining how to use timing and distance to deliver those blows with maximum impact to your opponent and minimum risk to oneself.

Also covered on this disc are launching counterattacks, defending against takedowns, and fighting from the clinch.

During the introduction to Volume 3, Lyoto states: ""In addition to learning the basic techniques, it is also very important that you focus on timing.  As you will soon see, timing is very, very important.  If your timing is off, utilizing one of the countering measures I lay out could be hazardous: instead of evading your opponent's attack and landing one of your own, you suffer the hit.

""Along these same lines, it is very important to develop a keen sense of distance.  If you attempt to throw a kick and there's not adequate distance between you and your opponent, again you will suffer rather than your opponent,"" says Machida.

* Intercepting Attacks: Lyoto reveals how to base your counter responses on your opponent's movements, and how to fight at long range in order to read those movements.  Other techniques covered include closing range with strikes, and combining blocking with footwork.

Lyoto incorporates the above techniques in a sparring session with Chinzo before illustrating how to intercept round kicks, jabs, rear hooks and looping punches.

* Countering Takedowns: Machida demonstrates takedown defense through sprawling and redirecting your opponent's energy, fist and knee intercepts, and Thai clinching and counter attacks.  He also focuses on counters to single- and double-leg takedowns before applying all of the above tactics in a spar with his brother.

* Clinching: This section deals with establishing the Thai clinch and delivering knee strikes, use of Thai clinches to off balance your opponent, and elbow strikes from the clinch.

* Basic Overhook-Underhook Positioning: Lyoto demonstrates striking from over-under, inside knee blocks and leg trips from the clinch, double underhook takedowns, and basic clinch defense.

As the rear cover states, ""If your goal is to steer the direction of a fight and inflict damage without taking abuse, this DVD is for you.""

LYOTO MACHIDA
Volume 4
The Ground Game
 Marc Wickert May 23, 2009
[...]

As with the three previous volumes, Lyoto commences this disc with appropriate stretching exercises to prepare practitioners for his upcoming techniques.

* Attacking the Downed Opponent: Lyoto reveals a variety of weapons at one's disposal, and methods for delivering them whilst avoiding up-kicks.  He also demonstrates how to apply a nasty foot-lock submission.

* G'N'P from Full Guard: Machida shows how to keep your hands free to ground and pound while pinning your opponent down.  He then illustrates ways to strike an adversary from the guard and employ optimal dynamics, and tactics to pass the guard and move to side control or the mount.

* G'N'P from Half Guard: Lyoto covers positioning to avoid counter submissions, and the strategy of varying the targets you select in order to confuse your opponent.  Other techniques shown include: submissions from half guard, passing half guard, leg locks from half guard, and ways to escape your opponent's kimura attempts before submitting him with an arm bar.

* G'N'P from Side Control: `The Dragon' runs through straight g'n'p, knee-on-belly positioning, arm traps, immobilizing one's opponent to apply submissions, and side control to mount transitions.

* G'N'P from Mount: Techniques covered include stabilizing your mount position, pinning your opponent whilst unloading g'n'p, and setting up submissions from the mount.

* Taking Opponent's Back: Machida explains how to create openings and to submit adversaries through rear naked chokes, arm bars and katagatames.

* Defending from the Ground: Lyoto demonstrates ways to avoid a prolonged closed guard, how to use your feet and knees to hamper your opponent's attack, and methods to control his hands and arms.  Sweeps and submissions from below are also illustrated.

* Ground Escapes: Machida  finishes off this section with tactics for escaping some of grappling's and MMA's most basic submissions, including arm bars, triangle chokes, guillotines and rear naked chokes.

It's no coincidence Lyoto Machida shot straight to the top of MMA whilst notching up a perfect 15-0-0 record and earning the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship Title.  This 4 DVD Box Set provides a golden opportunity for ultimate fighting enthusiasts to train alongside one of the very best in the business.",1249344000,18,9880,5.2253968253968255
