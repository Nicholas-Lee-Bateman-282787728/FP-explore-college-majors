8728759,5,B013TOR5KQ,"After the DVD release of Turn A Gundam, RightStuf decided to release the two movies as well. This two-disc set covers Movie I: Earth Light and Movie II: Moonlight Butterfly. While extremely fast-paced, these movies summarize the Turn A Gundam series. There is minimal new footage and some of the story is changed slightly but otherwise it's merely a summary. While not a necessary release to get, it's a good way to have and watch Turn A Gundam if you want to see it but it's not exactly your style of Gundam show.",1466553600,4,514,4.537634408602151
8728760,5,B013TOR5KQ,I cannot believe the bad reviews this is getting. Rightstuf inc. announced that the Turn A Gundam releases would be sub only. The actual product itself is great. The two featured movies are a retelling of the series at a faster pace. If you are a fan of Turn A Gundam this collection is a great way to complete the series.,1451520000,6,322,4.295081967213115
