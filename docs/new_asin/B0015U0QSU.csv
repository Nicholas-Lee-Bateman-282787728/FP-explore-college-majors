8259946,1,B0015U0QSU,"Very poor movie quality.  Every movie on this collection is bad, from the picture to the sound.  I was very disappointed that they would actually sell an item as bad as this.  The sound fades out to nothing, and when the sound returns, it is impossible to hear it, even with the volume up all the way.  The picture is grainy........don't waste your money like I did.",1242604800,12,366,4.417910447761194
