I loved the story, the characters especially Nano. It was refreshing to see Ms. Basu portraying someone other than an object of desire. She was actually good. And Madhavan, as usual, turned in a good performance. Even though the story was predictable, I enjoyed this film. I have a feeling that the critics ""creamed"" Madhavan in this one because of his weight, of which I could care less, and because of the plot. Make up your own mind, watch it.",1477008000,,618,4.2905982905982905
8510624,1,B0075NNWPU,"Formula Bollywood script of romance fantasies. Poorly acted; poor English subtitling; mass produced and stereotypic western influenced music. Had ads running across the top of the screen to buy their music - tacky. If there was a story, I forgot it two days later.",1346284800,,264,5.0227272727272725
