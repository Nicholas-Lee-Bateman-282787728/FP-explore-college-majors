1891838,2,B00009W0UB,"Most people feared WWE Bad Blood as being the first show presented exclusively by what is felt to be the weaker of the two WWE brands, Raw.  While by no means the worst show ever, Bad Blood isn't one that you'd want to run right out and get.
1. Ivory vs. Molly Holly -- This was on Sunday Night Heat, but will probably make the DVD as an extra.  Not bad, but they should have gone with Ivory vs. Jazz since that's what they were building towards anyway.
2. Dudley Boyz vs. Rodney Mack / Christopher Nowinski -- Decent opener, but the Dudleys are becoming stale as a team.  Nowinski has great potential and Mack is in desperate need of honing his in ring skills.
3. Scott Steiner vs. Test -- Steiner taints the match from the get-go by slipping off the ring apron.  Still, this was 1,000 times better than it should have been as it wasn't totally unwatchable.
4. Christian vs. Booker T -- Christian has got to be Raw's next breakout superstar, but he didn't showcase it here.  A disapointing finish to a subpar match.  Maybe they both drank some funny Kool-Aid before the match.
5. Kane / Rob Van Dam vs. La R&eacute;sistance -- The Frenchies are still very green, but SOMETHING had to be done with the Tag Team Titles and Kane & RVD were going nowhere as a team.
6. Chris Jericho vs. Goldberg -- My pick for best match of the night, as Y2J works a miracle and actually gets the crowd very much behind him.  Puzzling finish as Goldberg has a nearly separated shoulder but still musters up the strength to pick up a 230 pound Jericho with that same arm for the Jackhammer.  Still, Jericho is at the peak of his career as far as in-ring work goes and this match proves it.
7. Shawn Michaels vs. Ric Flair -- A shoe-in to be a top contender for best match of the year wasn't.  The match went very short and was ruined by a run-in from Randy Orton.  It was still good, just very disapointing.  Hopefully there will be a rematch.
8. Hell in a Cell: Triple H vs. Kevin Nash (Referee: Mick Foley) -- The build-up made me want to see HHH vs. Foley more, personally.  Nash doesn't belong in the main event and WWE knows it.  A decent enough match, although the cell itself wasn't utilized much.  Lesnar/Taker (the last HIAC match) was a lot better than this one.
Plus the Redneck Triathalon took place throughout the night.  If you want to see fake burps, Eric Bischoff in pig slop, and an 80-year-old Mae Young in a thong, then you'd love it.
This PPV was more of an extended Raw that you have to pay for.  Purchasing it wouldn't be the worst thing you could ever do as all of the matches are watchable to fairly good.  Nothing is a classic, match-wise.  What really drags it down from being a mediocre show into ""Thumbs Down"" territory is the Redneck Triathalon, which was unfunny and had no place on a show that people paid good money for.
It's probably in your best interest to avoid Bad Blood and use your twenty bucks for another show.  If you want a good Hell in a Cell on DVD, get the Undertaker or Shawn Michaels comps as well as No Mercy 2002.",1055808000,3,3043,4.31634446397188
1891839,4,B00009W0UB,"This ppv was very good from top to bottom and the best of the year so far.  Every match had some entertaining moments.  The show kicked off with a decent tag match between the Dudleyz and the team of Rodney Mack and Christopher Nowinski.  Nothing special in this match, but some good chemistry between the young team of Mack and Nowinski.  A lot of heat on the Harvard grad from the very vocal crowd.  Test versus Scott Steiner wasn't exactly a five-star classic, but it had some entertaining moments involving Stacie and Test whacking himself with a chair by accident.  It was good to see Test finally show some perosnality and develop as a heel.  The IC title match was a good match between Booker T and Christian, but ended poorly with some confusing decisions by the referee.  Rob Van Dam and Kane faced La Resistance for the Tag belts.  I was truly disappointed that Kane did not turn on RVD this night, but I guess they figured they would save it for a Raw (which is dumb because we dish out 35 bucks to see these things and they hold back so much for TV). The Godberg-Jericho match was very good. Y2J was unbelievable and Goldberg was surprisingly very good. HBK and The Nature Boy put on an excellent match that incorporated tables and a nasty chair shot from Randy Orton. Finally, Hell in a Cell was great.  Nash and The Game used some unusual weapons and Mick Foley played the role of the biggest fan favorite. Glad to see Triple H win and hold the belt. Also glad to see Nash out of the title picture.  What do people see in this guy... he only gets main-events when the industry is down.  Overall, an excellent ppv with great entertainment value in the Redneck Triathlon.",1055721600,,1683,4.4640522875816995
1891840,5,B00009W0UB,"CHRIS JERICHO vs. GOLDBERG
Goldberg's recent return to the world of sports entertainment hasn't sat well with Chris Jericho. According to Y2J, nobody wants Goldberg in WWE. His claims stem from a long-running rivalry the two have been engaged in since their days together in the old WCW. Will Jericho finally prove that he is of the caliber of Goldberg? Or will Jericho be Goldberg's next victim? Find out at Bad Blood on pay-per-view.

1891856,5,B00009W0UB,"This was an awesome dvd.  Especially if you're a Triple H fan.  He is a dirty wrestler, which of course, is good!!!",1180828800,,115,4.181818181818182
1891857,3,B00009W0UB,"1. The Dudley Boyz vs. Christaphor Nowitski and Monty Brown- This was an okay way to kickoff the ppv. It seemed more like a filler to me. It had an okay pace and everything but was about only 7 minutes long which gave me the feeling that this was a raw match. A few near falls but not more than a filler. Winners Christaphor Nowitski and Monty Brown. Match Rating 5/10.

2. Test vs. Scott Stiner winner gets Stacy's services- This was probably my favorite match of there series. One of there matches on there own would be hard to get into but stacy was right there to help the match move. It had a good storyline and some solid wrestling and was kept at the right pace about 9 minutes long. I really liked stiners style lots of technical wrestling and power moves. Some nice near falls with Stiner kicking out of test boot to the face. A solid match. Winner  Scott Stiner. Match Rating 6/10.

3. Christian vs. Booker T for the itc title- This was another solid match it helped with it being bookers hometown. I really liked the matches back than with this mid card it was very solid. Christian played his hell role well here but there were quite a few peeps in the crowd, Mostly solid wrestling throughout and quite a few near falls but the ending sucked as it ended in a dq. Winner by DQ Booker T. Match Rating 7/10.

4. Rvd and Kane vs. LA Resistance for the world tag team titles- This was an okay tag match but nothing special. It almost seemed like a filler and could have been a lot better. The kane storyline was interesting in this but just a solid 8 minute match. A ncie high risk move at the end that cost rvd and kane the tag team titles. Winners and new woeld tag team champs La Resistance. Match Rating 6/10.

5. Goldberg vs. Chris Jerico- This was a pretty good one on one match but was not as good as it could have been. I really believe this could have been a match of the year candidate. It had the storyline buildup and two good wrestlers. It was okay to start but a sick spear by Goldberg missed and he went crashing into the crowd which busted him open. A lot of the match was slowed down by jerico as he controlled most of it and Goldberg hits a spear out of knowere and a jackahmmer and pins jerico kind of reminded me of hulk Hogan the ending sucked and believe it or not there were a lot of Goldberg haters and jerico fans. Winner Goldberg. Macth Rating 6.5/10.

6. Rick Flair vs. Shawn Michales- This was a nice match. IT ahd a good storyline and two great wrestlers. A lot of the beginning was solid wrestling from these two which was fine but the pace picked up as michales went out and got a table and orton came out of know were and got nailed with a sweet chin music. Than michales got on the top rope and did an amazing splash onto flair through a table while turning himself in mid air.  Match came in the ring with some near falls but than orton screws michales with a sick shot to the head with a steel chair. Winner Rick Flair. Match Rating 8/10.

7. HHH vs. Kevin Nash in a hell and a cell match for the WHT- As much as people though this match was going to suck and be the worst hell in a cell match ever it did not and was pretty solid. It could have been longer as it was only a 19 minute main event and the ppv ended a half hour early. It started off great with some sick chair shots to the HHH. It broke down on the outside with lots of itmes including a 2 by 4 in barb wire steel steps and a screw driver. Tons of blood in this match including foley getting busted open. Tons of near falls including one were I thought nash was accualty going to win the title not a bad match like everyone says. Winner and still WHC HHH. Match Rating 8.5/10.

Well that raps up another. I would give Bad Blood 2003 a grade of 46/70 which is a 66% which means this is a good ppv. I would recommend this to pick it up at half price like I did not a bad ppv but ended early not not to many match of the year to remember. If u can tell me if my review was helpful or not I would appreciate that. Thanks for your time.",1165536000,,4039,4.0896464646464645
1891858,3,B00009W0UB,"Really the main matches to watch are

1. Goldberg vs. Chris Jericho-Overall its a pretty slow match but there are so high spots like where goldberg spears threw the baracade.

2. Shawn Micheals vs. Ric Flair-This match was actually better than i thought once again having some high spots like the splash through the table to ric flair for the top rope but the ending was gay when orton hit micheals with the chair will the referee is out i think it should have been a better ending.

3. HELL IN A CELL HHH VS. KEVIN NASH-In my opionion one of the best hell in a cells in my book it could have been better like if they had of got out of the cell and used a annoucers table or used a table in the cell but anyways they used a lot of weapons like barbedwire baseball bat, steps, chair, sledgehammer,a wooden crat,a screwdriver, the cell and a shot from a hammer that questions if nash used blading during the match it is sick and its good how mick foley gets involved during the match. Overall, the match i would give it a 9/10

The whole paper view i give a 7.5/10 really the last three matches is the only thing to watch unless u get bored",1155513600,,1138,4.206422018348624
1891859,4,B00009W0UB,"This was Raw's first exclusive pay-per-view, and it wasn't a bad event.

1. Dudley Boyz vs. Rodney Mack and Chris Nowinski

This was a very solid opener. I really don't get why Chris Nowinski is hanging around with Teddy Long,Rodney Mack and Jazz because they are very ""black power"" but o.k. The match was a pretty decent considering that Mack and Nowinski have two contrasting styles. 6 out of 10.

2. Test vs. Scott Steiner(Winner receives Stacy Keibler's managerial services)

I quite enjoyed this match considering that these are two big men. The match was solid and these two have decent matches together. 7 out of 10.

3. Christian vs. Booker T(WWE Intercontinental Championship)

The whole match overall was good but the ending took away from the match. These two are pretty underrated and I would like to see Booker win a big championship. Christian went to TNA and now I officially don't care about him. 7 out of 10.

4. Rob Van Dam and Kane vs. La Resistance(World Tag Team Championship)

This was a good tag team match. La Resistance did show a little inexperience but RVD and Kane carry them. This match also led to RVD and Kane's match at Summerslam. 7 out of 10.

5. Goldberg vs. Chris Jericho

This was one of few Goldberg matches that were actually very good in WWE.The missed spear through the barricade shifted momentum in the match and Jericho put on another great match. 9 out of 10.

6. Shawn Michaels vs. Ric Flair

This match really surprised me. I loved this match. The performence put on by these two men was great and Ric Flair got splashed through a table which cut his back open. The ending kinda took away but the match was still great. 9 out of 10.

7. Redneck Triathlon

Stone Cold vs. Eric Bischoff

This wasn't even a match;just a bunch of contests that took place throughout the show. It was pretty funny,but it was also kind of a waste of time. 7 out of 10.

8. Hell in a Cell

Triple H vs. Kevin Nash(World Heavyweight Championship)

I don't care what anybody else says,this was a great match. Mick Foley was the referee and did a great job as usual. He even was bleeding. There were a variety of weapons used including steel steps,steel chair,sledgehammer,wooden crate,toolbox and screwdriver. 9 out of 10.",1138406400,,2243,4.607052896725441

1891862,4,B00009W0UB,"Hello and welcome to my review on Summerslam 2002. I use a grading system and each match receives a grade. Then to determine how the show ranks the total of the matches scores are divided by the number of matches giving the grade and a comment about whether you should buy it or not. The grading system is as follows.

Grading E- = 0 - 8.33%-Waste of time and money.

  E  = 8.33 - 16.66%-Waste of time and money.

  E+ = 16.66 - 24.99%-Waste of time and money.

  D- = 24.99 - 33.32%-Very poor event maybe read about it.

  D  = 33.32 - 41.65%-Poor event with a little something standing out.

  D+ = 41.65 - 50%-Not a very good event but it just below passing.

  C- = 50 - 55.55%-Just below average worth a watch.

  C  = 55.55 - 61%-An average event worth a renting.

  C+ = 61 - 66.65%-Above average worth a purchase if you can find it for cheap.

  B- = 66.65 - 72.20%-Good event with a lot of good stuff. Purchase if you're a collector or interested.

  B  = 72.20 - 77.75%-Good quality event which is worth purchase and should be collected.

  B+ = 77.75 - 83.30%-Very high quality event with awesome matches. Must have for anyone.

  A- = 83.30 - 88.85%-Excellent event, must have for anyone. Lock this one away.

  A  = 88.85 - 94.40%-Extremely spectacular event with lots of great stuff. Lock this away.

  A+ = 94.40 - 100%-DVD of the century, must buy and keep in a very safe place.

Match One-Rodney Mack & Christopher Nowinski Vs D-Von & Bubba Ray Dudley-This match was a decent opener with some nice action and an alright ending to it. The amount of PPV's the Dudleys have opened is enormous, The Dudleys should be up the top of the card in matches more suited for their style. As for Nowinski and Mack,its weird Nowinksi trying to be""down with the brown"" when he's white but they can continue trying. My rating 6.31/10.

Match Two-Scott Steiner Vs Test-This match was actually quite decent which surprised me. The winner of this match received Stacy Keibler for managerial duties. This was a back and forth battle of the power moves. This wasn't a great match but at least it was a good effort from both men allowing this match to pass. My rating 5.81/10.

Match Three-Intercontinental Championship-Christian(C)Vs Booker T-In his home state of Houston Texas,Booker T one of the most over men on the Raw roster guns for the IC Title against the charismatic IC Champ who is Christian. This match was a good solid quality match with some back and forth action. Hopefully these two continue to feud as they put on some fairly decent matches. My rating 7.28/10.

Match Four-World Tag Team Championships-Kane & RVD(C)Vs La Resistance-This was back when there was actually some competition on the main show for these titles unlike now. On to the match, this match was with the unorthodox style of RVD,the power of Kane versing the tag team who was still fairly new and green(meaning inexperienced). This match was a lot to short for my liking but it still was very good. Hopefully Kane & RVD get pushes for the World Title as those two men deserve it and hopefully La Resistance will continue to team for a long time to come. My rating 6.66/10.

Match Five-Goldberg Vs""Y2J""Chris Jericho-This match was a kind of confusing. On one hand I was pleased to see that Goldberg remembered to sell his injuries and put in a good perfomance but on the other hand I wasn't completely satisfied how the match went, it was a little bit to short for my likings but its understandable with Goldberg. Y2J was doing his heart out in this match trying to get some heat for the man they call Goldberg. This match was the best match on the card up until this point. My rating 7.40/10.

Match Six-""HBK""Shawn Michaels Vs""The Nature Boy""Ric Flair-This was Icon Vs Legend and as Ric Flair says ""to be the man you have to beat the man"" and HBK poured his heart out in this match and it was great to watch two of the best ever wrestlers ever going at it in an all out good match. There was some unneccessary interference from Randy Orton but hopefully its leading on to something good. Hopefully these two have some more matches down the track as they are really good. My rating 8.30/10.

Match Seven-Main Event-Hell In A Cell-World Heavyweight Championship-HHH(C)Vs Kevin Nash-The Special Referree Mick Foley!!! The man HHH retired in Hell In The Cell back at No Way Out 2000! This match was a bloody brutal brawl, it had many weapons used,stairs,sledgehammer,screwdriver,wood box and a lot more. Both men were gushing blood and it was good fun to watch. It wasn't the best match and it definetly wasn't the most rememberable match to end a feud with in terms of quality but they put on a good showing. Its about the same goodness as HBK Vs Ric Flair. My rating 8.35/10.

Overall this show was a bit lackluster for Raws first ever single brand PPV but it was still good. The best matches were Goldberg Vs Y2J,HBK Vs Flair And The Cell involving HHH and Nash. The overall score for this show was 50.11/70, which is equal to 71.58%. This score is equal to a B Minus meaning its a Good event with a lot of good stuff.

1891876,2,B00009W0UB,"Bad Blood 2003 was the type of underwhelming pay-per-view that the WWE has come to be known by. ""Bad Blood"" was headlined by a Hell In A Cell match between Kevin Nash and Triple-H. Since neither man is known for risk-taking moves, this one was average. Goldberg vs. Chris Jericho had a nice build-up which led to the eventual Goldberg squash. Shawn Michaels vs. Ric Flair was a ""dream match"" of sorts but didn't exactly play out like one. With no title involved and Flair more or less playing a Helmsley lackey, these days, this match really didn't have the emotion it deserved. The rest of the card was nothing you couldn't and don't see on a weekly basis on RAW.

CHRISTOPHER NOWINSKI & RODNEY MACK defeated THE DUDLEY BOYZ: Decent enough opener, which was pretty much similar to a Raw match. It did serve it's purpose however, in getting the crowd going. The Dudleyz are often the most popular wrestlers at house shows for involving the crowd, and the Houston audience was in good form here. Nowinski & Mack are going to be hard for any team to wrestle. This was sufficient, if nothing more. Strange to see The Dudleyz lose if they're going to be the next title contenders. Match Rating...5

SCOTT STEINER defeated TEST to Win the managerial services of Stacy Keibler: Let's get it out the way quickly; Scott Steiner's bellyflop off the apron was just hilarious, but these things happen to everyone. I'm sure many people would have hated this match, and while I didn't think it was crash hot, I thought it was passable. Sure, I wasn't expecting very much, but I thought the 2 did the best they possibly could do, especially with such a boring & long feud. More surprisingly, was that real heel heat that Test was getting? Match Rating...5

BOOKER T defeated CHRISTIAN by Disqualification in a match for the InterContinental Title: Just forgetting about the ending of this match for a moment, I actually enjoyed this title bout. It started out at a decent pace, but really consistently gathered momentum as it went along. I also didn't mind the touch of Christian attempting to get himself counted out, BUT not only was the DQ ending not the appropriate way to go, but it occurred almost instantaneously after the count-out shenanigans. This resulted in the match lasting 8 minutes, which was approximately how long the 2 openers lasted. Come on WWE, this is the InterContinental Title we're talking about here. Match Rating...6

LA RESISTANCE defeated KANE & ROB VAN DAM to Win the World Tag-Team Titles: This was by far the worst of Kane & RVD's matches since they became champions. There was no excitement, no momentum & nothing great about the whole match at all. It was as if the 4 men were all trying to be careful to not make a mistake. Not a great start to La Resistance's title reign (see Raw review for more opinion though), and the Kane & RVD break-up continues to get closer. Match Rating...5

BILL GOLDBERG defeated CHRIS JERICHO: Boy, I hate it when a crowd boos the face. By all means, cheer the heel, but don't boo the face. I could go on forever about that topic, but back to the match. It was actually a fair bit better than I expected. The intensity was great, the psychological aspect was there & there were enough exciting moments spread throughout the bout. Goldberg unfortunately oversold the arm injury way too much, but that's just him. I'm not going to allow whatever is going on backstage to influence my opinion of a wrestling match. This was good. Match Rating...7

RIC FLAIR defeated SHAWN MICHAELS: Like the InterContinental Title match, I really liked the way this bout progressed. It started slowly with each man sharing domination of minutes on end. But when the 2 started to mix it up, it was great; Exactly the way a match should play out. HBK threw in his usual 2-3 aerial moves which proves that he still has something left in the tank, and then Orton interferes & it's over. Don't get me wrong, I did not want to see the 35 minute marathon that Michaels wanted to. Not just yet anyway. But (again like the IC title match), to have a match progressing well & seemingly building up to what could have been a great finish, and then to have an abrupt interference-caused ending is just silly. I'm not always against interference ending a match, but when it cuts it short abruptly, I don't like it. Match Rating...7

STEVE AUSTIN defeated ERIC BISCHOFF 2-1 in a Redneck Triathlon: Obviously, this segment took up enough time to warrant a rating. Now, I don't usually like segments on pay-per-views, but I knew something like this one had to happen. Extremely inconsistent, I found parts of this good & parts of it bad. The burping contest was just stupid. The segment involving Mae Young was great (mainly due to Bischoff & Mae), but was ruined by Austin giving the stunner to Mae. What exactly did that prove!?!?!? The singing contest could have been really good, but Austin threw a Sosa & cheated (sorry, I couldn't resist), and changed the rules. The remainder was all a waste of time. When all was said & done, it was ok, BUT wasted way too much time. I didn't time the cumulative amount the segments went for, but it was at least 5 minutes too long. Segment Rating...4

TRIPLE H defeated KEVIN NASH in a Hell In A Cell match to Retain the World HeavyWeight Title: Pretty much what I expected. The HIAC gimmick & Mick Foley being in there as the special referee made this bout better than last months. Anyone could have predicted that there was going to be blood everywhere. In fact, the whole match panned out exactly as I thought it would. Watchable. Match Rating...6

PPV RATING (45/80) = 56

Looking at the key, I have given Bad Blood a 'C' grade & have said that it was 'Average'. That pretty much sums it up well, in my opinion. Anyone who states that this pay-per-view was the worst that the WWE have put on this year, is actually looking more at how much better it could have been, rather than how good it was. It is also a back-handed compliment to the WWE for setting this ppv up well. There is no doubt in my mind that Bad Blood was better than last months Judgment Day. No matches were awful & the sports-entertainment segment was watchable. Unfortunately, there was once more, no clear-cut 'great' matches.

1891880,4,B00009W0UB,"Christopher Nowinksi & Rodney Mack (with Theodore Long) defeated The Dudley Boyz. They showed clips from Heat earlier in which Nowinski got in D-Von's ear about his brother always ordering him around. D-Von and Nowinksi started off with D-Von taking control and later tagging in Bubba who also controlled. Mack tried to interfere but got whipped into the corner where Nowinksi already was and Bubba splashed them both. Later in the match, the Dudleyz hit the ""Whassup"" headbutt on Mack and Bubba called for the tables but D-Von had some second thoughts as Long was up on the apron yelling at D-Von. Finally, D-Von went after Long and Mack clotheslined D-Von to the outside while Nowinksi took his steel facemask and clocked Bubba with it for the win.

JR and The King then talked about the Redneck Triathlon and how the first event was picked on last week's Raw. Footage from Heat is shown of Bischoff and Austin spinning the wheel (with Terri on hand) and it landed on a Burping Contest.

Ross and Lawler then sent it backstage to Steve Austin, Eric Bischoff and the host of the triathlon, Terri. The first event ended up being the burping contest and the two took their turns at delivering the biggest belch for the win. The burps weren't real, just sound effects. Anyway, with the help of some beer, Austin won the burping contest.

Scott Steiner defeated Test to win the managerial services of Stacy Keibler. During Stacy's ass flaunting entrance into the ring, Test grabbed her and pulled her to the floor and started yelling at her. Steiner went to jump off the apron but he tripped and did a dive to the floor and I almost choked on my drink laughing. In the ring, Steiner took control but Test soon rolled to the outside and got Stacy involved which allowed him to get a shot in on Steiner. Early in the match, Test threw on a sleeperhold but only momentarily as Steiner soon broke out and hit an overhead belly to belly suplex. The two traded some more moves and near falls as Stacy was cheering on Steiner. Finally, Test got fed up and grabbed a chair but Steiner ducked it and the chair bounced off the ropes and hit Test in the face. Steiner then hit his finisher for the win.

Backstage, Bischoff and Austin were talking about the pie eating contest which was coming up next. They stepped into a locker room where Bischoff showed off his ""research"" and had four lovely ladies waiting for them as the ""pie."" Bischoff said he wanted to go first and Austin agreed just as long as he got to pick the ""flavor"" of pie Bischoff was going to eat.

Christian defeated Booker T to retain the Intercontinental Title. Booker controlled early on and hit a nice spinebuster. Christian relied on the usual heel tactics (a thumb to the eye) to take advantage and scored a near fall after tossing Booker into the steps on the outside. Christian locked on a chinlock to slow things down but Booker rebounded and caught Christain coming off the second rope with a flapjack. Booker took control from there and hit a sidewalk slam and tried the rollup out of the corner but Christian reversed it and got a two count while holding the ropes. Christian then showed props to The Rock and hit Book with a Rock Bottom for another near fall. Booker then came back and hit the ax kick and then came off the top with the missile dropkick. Booker did the Spinaroonie to a huge pop for his hometown crowd as Christian slid out of the ring, grabbed his belt and made his way up the ramp. Referee Jack Doan refused to count out Christian, he grabbed a mic and told Christian if he didn't get back in the ring before ten, he'd forfeit the title. Christian reluctantly ran back in but slid right back out which led to Booker chasing him around the ring. Christian then jumped back in and nailed Booker with the belt causing a disqualification.

Next up was the second part of the Redneck Triathlon. Lawler was in the ring to host the pie eating contest. Eric Bischoff made his entrance, soon followed by Steve Austin who received the biggest pop of the night at that point. Austin made some funny cracks on Bischoff before showing the four girls in the back. Austin said Bischoff would not get a chance to eat thier pie and then brought up how Bischoff said he liked mature women. Cue the music as Mae Young came out, dragging The Fabulous Moolah behind her. Mae got in the ring and started chasing Bischoff around. Bischoff refused and said he wouldn't do it. Austin made the point that if Bischoff didn't do it, then Austin would win. Finally, Bischoff broke down and planted a kiss on Mae and then told Austin to ""top that."" Austin said it was a pie eating contest, not a kissing contest. Mae then kicked Bischoff in the junk and he slumped down in the corner. Ah, for the love of God, Mae took off her skirt revealing a thong and hit somewhat of a Bronco Buster on Bischoff. Poor Bischoff got up and told Austin it was his turn. Austin decided to forego this event and opted to hit a Stunner on Mae, which didn't get all that good of a reaction. The score was then tied at one apiece.

Backstage, Jonathan Coachman had a word with La Rsistance who said they were looking forward to winning the tag team titles, but hated to do so in a state like Texas. They took a shot at Texas by mentioning it as the state that George W. Bush came from. They then dedicated their match to France and its president, Jacques Chirac.

La Rsistance defeated Rob Van Dam & Kane to win the World Tag Team Titles. Van Dam started off and was fired up as he took control early. Van Dam went for the monkeyflip on Dupre but Grenier interfered which led to Dupre taking control with a DDT. The two worked over Van Dam for a bit before he rebounded and made the hot tag to Kane who cleaned house. Kane caught Dupre coming off the top with a two handed choke. Kane then hit the top rope clothesline on Grenier for two. The heels then tried a double team but Kane countered with a clothesline. Kane and La Rsistance then went to the outside and brawled. Van Dam then came flying over the top with a dive but Grenier and Dupre moved and RVD took out Kane. In the ring, Grenier and Dupre hit RVD with the double flapjack for the win.

Goldberg defeated Chris Jericho. Goldberg tore tight into Jericho and tossed him around the ring for a bit. He then pressed Jericho up over his head and dropped him crotch-first on the top rope. They headed outside where Goldberg dropped Jericho onto the security rail. Goldberg then got ready for a spear as Jericho got to his feet. Goldberg charged but Jericho dodged it and Goldberg went into the security rail and tore right through it, injuring his shoulder. Jericho took advantage of that and worked over Goldberg's arm and shoulder for the next few minutes. Goldberg tried to fight back with one arm but Jericho remainded in control as he hit a bulldog and then a Lionsault (right on Goldberg's face, actually) for a near fall. Jericho hit another bulldog and went for another Lionsault but Goldberg was on his feet to counter it. Goldberg then nailed the spear with his injured shoulder which (of course) prevented him from making a pin attempt. Around this point, a small ""Goldberg Sucks!"" chant was heard, followed by a ""Y2J!"" chant. Goldberg attempted the Jackhammer but couldn't lift Jericho with his injured arm. Jericho hit a lowblow and then locked on the Walls of Jericho which surprisingly received a good reaction. Goldberg struggled for the ropes but Jericho dragged him back towards the center. Goldberg then countered out of the hold and soon after he hit the spear and the Jackhammer for the win.

Ric Flair defeated Shawn Michaels. Michaels gave Flair a little bit of his own medicine early on, hitting a big chop and then putting him down on the mat and doing the Flair strut on his back. HBK kept on the offensive with a crossbody to the outside and continued to dominate. Back in the ring, Flair managed a couple of chops but Michaels was still in control. Finally, Flair hit a chop block with Michaels' back turned and worked over HBK's knee for a little bit before locking on the Figure Four. After two near falls, Michaels finally broke the hold. Flair went after the knee again but Michaels countered with an enziguri. Flair regained momentum for a minute and went up top and as usual, got thrown off. Michaels tuned up the band but his superkick was blocked so he turned the tables on Flair and locked on his own Figure Four. Flair got out of it with a thumb to the eye. Flair then rolled up Michaels and held the tights but only scored a two count. HBK then set up Flair on the top and nailed a superplex. Michaels then headed outside and set up a table. In the ring, Flair tried to suplex Michaels over the top and onto the table but HBK countered and the two went to the outside where Michaels introduced Flair to the ringpost and then set him up on the table. Randy Orton then ran in from the crowd but got absolutely floored with a superkick from Michaels. HBK went up top and hit a nice crossbody, changing direction in mid-air and colliding with Flair to destroy the table. Flair and Michaels slowly made it to their feet and headed back in the ring where we could see that Flair's back was bleeding. In the ring, Michaels had Flair in the corner but he hit a mule kick between the legs which also took out referee Earl Hebner. Michaels was still in control however and hit the elbow drop off the top and then clocked Flair with Sweet Chin Music. However, Randy Orton had recovered and jumped in the ring to plaster HBK with a chair. Orton then took a bloodied Flair and laid him over Michaels just as Hebner came around to make the three count.

Backstage, Austin and Bischoff spun the wheel for their last event and it ended up on a Sing-Off. Austin seemed a little worried and said he sucked at singing, as Bischoff seemed confident, saying he had a set of pipes.

Bischoff then made his way out and decided to sing his theme music. They fire up the theme song and Bischoff lip-synched along to it until Austin appeared on the TitanTron and called Bischoff Milli Vanilli and told him to do it for real. Bischoff did a horrible rendition of his theme music so Austin suggested they spin the wheel again. Austin planted the pointer on ""Pig Pen Fun"" as we got a look at a pig pen set up to the side of the stage. Austin said the first man to toss the other one into the mud and pig crap was the winner. Austin's music started up and he came out as Bischoff tried to escape through the crowd. Austin took Bischoff in the ring and nailed him with a Stunner and then marched him up to the stage and tossed him off into the pig pen. Bischoff got caked in mud as the pigs huddled in the corner. Austin headed back to the ring and celebrated his victory with a few beers. Austin then took some beer up onto the stage and saluted the fans from there as well.

Triple H defeated Kevin Nash in a Hell in a Cel match to retain the World Heavyweight Title with Mick Foley as the special guest referee. Nash and H did a little bit of brawling to begin with before the cell got involved. On the floor, Nash threw Triple H into the cell a few times and then H took a backdrop bump on the floor before the two headed back in the ring where Nash scored a near fall. Back to the floor, Nash hurled H into the ring steps and then picked them up and threw them at him but H dove out of the way and then found a toolbox under the ring. H dumped over the box and grabbed a hammer and clocked Nash in the knee with it. H then nailed Nash in the head with the hammer before Foley stepped in and took it away. Nash was busted open as H tried to further the damage by scraping Nash's face into the steel mesh. Nash got thrown back into the ring as H grabbed a screwdriver and went after him but Nash blocked it, only to have H throw a knee to his gut and tear at him with the screwdriver. H tossed the screwdriver aside in favor of the 2x4 wrapped in barbed wire. H hit Nash in the gut with it and went for a headshot but Nash blocked it, grabbed the 2x4 and clocked H in the head with it. H was then wearing the crimson mask as Nash took the 2x4 and set it up on the top turnbuckle. Snake eyes into the 2x4 is then hit and Nash scored a near fall. The ring steps then made their way into the ring as H bailed and smashed a wooden crate over Nash's head. H brought out the sledgehammer next but Foley took it away which led to H punching him out. Triple H grabbed the ring steps and went after Nash but Nash countered with a drop toehold and H went face-first into the steps. H was bleeding pretty heavily here. H brought in a chair, plastered Nash and then turned around and swung for the fences upside Foley's head. Foley then pulled out Mr. Socko and locked on the Madible Claw on H. Nash had the ring steps and went to hit Triple H but ended up taking out both Foley and H. Foley was on the apron as Nash and H brawled and Nash got shoved into Foley, sending him flying into the cell. Triple H then took another dive into the 2x4 thanks to a Nash slingshot. Jackknife powerbomb was then hit but it only managed a two count. H then grabbed the sledgehammer, drilled Nash, hit the Pedigree and retained his title. Afterwards, Orton and Flair came out to help the bloodied champ to his feet as the show went off the air.",1114128000,,13322,4.3561368209255535

Not extremely enjoyable mind you, but still alright.

I won't go into all the matches, just the ones that were worth mentioning.

Intercontinental Championship: Christian vs. Booker T

Christian had won the IC Title a month earlier, but had cheated by being eliminated in the Battle Royal by Booker, than coming back in while the ref was down and eliminating Booker by cracking his skull with the belt and tossing his carcass over. So of course, a feud started.

The match itself? Decent, yet Christian retains in a lame self DQ way... Booker handles himself quite well, although having to suffer from being shifted from the mainevent spotlight in March, to dissolving down to a mid-carder. Although Booker would go on to win the title back from Christian on an episode of RAW instead of his hometown, Booker never got his due in the WWE and would eventually get drafted to SD!. Watch for the  reception Booker gets when the crowd realised he used his old, old, incredibly old finisher, the missile dropkick, from his WCW days.

World Tag Team Championship match: RVD & Kane vs. La Resistance

Pretty Good! ...for a RAW match. As I just stated, this is basically your ol' RAW tag team title match which ends in a title change. Kane would go on to lose his mask and involve himself in ridiculous storylines, and RVD's WWE career would linger in the toilet. La Resistance however would hold the titles, lose them, regain them and reign as champs for a heckuva time. The End.

Of course, that bald-headed moron STEALS a win from Y2J, although eventually at WrestleMania XX Goldberg would be disgraced and as you are reading this, wrestling in Japan and making 5 times more money than he did in the WWE.

***

Shawn Michaels vs. Ric Flair

Before I get onto the part about the interference: Great match. Great, great, great ring psychology and an all-round entertaining match. A lot of guys think that the match was completely ruined by HBK setting up the table and Orton interfering, but when HBK and Flair really shine, it's in the ring for the most part of the match. When many people expected a dream match with a clean ending, they basically got a dream match cut short by interference. Although, however, most people just took it as the whole match being shot down to a burning pile. Guys, take it or leave it. Although the interference, undoubtedly ruined these guys from taking this match to great heights, it still was worth watching these two legends get together in the match of the night.

Hell in a Cell for the World Heavyweight Championship- Triple H vs. Kevin Nash (Special referee Mick Foley)

As we know, Nash could never wrestle to what he could back in the day, and all 3 men in the ring had seen better days, the match still promises what it was meant to live up to. Many people here are saying that HIAC means guys getting thrown off the top of the cell, and people going through it, and people escaping it etc., but quite frankly, who said so? Of course all those stunts are great, but in Hardcore matches and Street Fights do people get thrown off of a big cage? No! And did you even expect any of these men to fall so many feet and through a table? No freakin' way! As Undertaker commented on his No Mercy 2002 HIAC match with Lesnar, ""the match we put on proves that HIAC doesn't have to be about guys falling off cells, it proved tha HIAC is meant to be two guys fighting eachother inside a cell, and we made that concept work.""

Of course, this match does have its flaws, such as its slow pace and the sloppy ending, but to not be satisfied AT ALL with this match is crazy, and all you people who think this match was just too poor to be seen are in denial. Of course we all know that the HIAC match is used merely as a ticket-selling concept nowadays, so of course if Bad Blood was a PPV which was known for selling tickets and buyrates (which it definitely is not) a HIAC match wouldn't have been necessary, but rather a normal singles match, or a street fight. But all in all, the match, which is definitely not one of the finest, is still worth a look.

1. Dudley Boys vs. Chris Nowinski & Rodney Mack

This match wasn't put together until Heat.  It was not that bad of a match.  It could have been a lot worse.  Good effort by all involved.  I think this may have been Nowinski's last match in the WWE, to date.  (7.5/10)

2. Scott Steiner vs. Test (Winner Gets Stacy's Managerial Services)

This was just the beginning of these two competitors fued.  It wasn't that great of a match.  At the beginning, Steiner went to jump off the apron, but slipped.  It was hilarious and everyone started laughing at him, but it is cut out on the DVD.  The ending of this match is pretty cool.  (7/10)

By the way look for the two kids in the front row dressed up in Pooh and Tigger costumes.  It is kind of funny.

3. Booker T vs. Christian (Intercontinental Title)

This match was going along very well and looked like it would end up being a very good match.  Unfortunately, the match stops at a horrible spot, very early in the match. I don't know about this decision.  It would have been a good match.  (7.5/10)

This PPV featured the Redneck Competition between Austin and Bischoff.  It is kind of stupid.

4. Rob Van Dam & Kane vs. La Resistance (World Tag Titles)

This was the last PPV match Kane would wrestle with his mask on.  It marked the beginning of the end of Kane and RVD.  The match was not very good, but it was needed for the Kane angle.  (6/10)

5. Goldberg vs. Chris Jericho

The two had developed a really good fued going into this match.  It was a good match, but not as good as it could have been.  Y2J actually carried Goldberg in the match, who seemed to be hurt.  The crowd started cheering for Jericho and booing Goldberg.  Decent match.  (7.5/10)

6. Shawn Michaels vs. Ric Flair

This ended up being a really good match.  It is a technical classic between two legends.  If you think about it, this is really a dream match up.  Crazy spot when Michaels puts Flair on a table one the floor and climbs up to the top rope and jumps onto Flair, crashing both men through the table.  Flair actually cuts the back of his head by mistake in the match.  Randy Orton makes an appearance in the match.  (9/10)

7. Triple H vs. Kevin Nash (World Heavyweight Title w/ Mick Foley as Guest Referee/Hell In A Cell)

A lot of people were billing this as the worst Hell In A Cell ever.  I thought it was far from that and was very entertained by it.  There was one stupid part with the use of a screwdriver, other than that, it is very good.  This is a very bloody, brutal match.  Good use of the chair and the two by four wrapped in barbed wire.  Foley takes a sick bump in this match after getting hit with a steel chair.  The ending is very good, with a lot of close falls.

A lot of people didn't like this PPV, but I was impressed.  It is not a must have for your DVD collection, but it is not a bad pick up.

Mack/Nowidski v. The Dudley's  4/10- Nothing to get excited about.. a typical Dudley Boyz Match that's meant to do nothing but get the crowd going. Served it's purpose.

Scott Steiner v. Test 5/10- This is a match that gets a horrible knock and doesn't deserve it. Now their match at Unforgiven was dog crap, but this one wasn't all that bad. The storyline was probobly the worst of 2003 and ranks up there with Katie Vick and the Hardy/Lita/Kane wedding/baby/love triangle... however this match wasn't all that bad.

Booker T v. Christian 5.5/10- Again, minus the terrible ending, this wasn't a bad match. Would've been nice to have seen Booker T walk out of his hometown with a title, but you can't always get what you want.

RVD/Kane v. La Resistance 6.5/10-- I enjoyed this match but it was eclipsed by the Kane/RVD saga which in a way, took away from it all a bit. Nonetheless, a solid tag team match.

Goldberg v. Chris Jericho 4/10-- Perhaps Jericho's worst performance to date, but look at who he was facing. It amazes me that some guys like Goldberg can get so popular with a bad gimmick and no wrestling skills. This is the only match that deserves to be bashed. Goldberg has the charisma of a butter knife to me.

Shawn Michaels v. Ric Flair 8/10-- People can say as much as they want about Ric Flair being in the twilight of his career, but let's face it. Flair can still put on a hell of a match when asked to. This match was very good with even better psychology. I don't get why the Orton interference got to everyone so much. I don't think it took anything away from the match. Good effort by both.

Redneck Triathalon- I'm sorry, but Austin just bored me to tears the last three years he was with the company and this is another example of why i'm not sorry he's not in the company anymore. No wrestling here, just entertainment... I will say though.. Mae Young showing up was clutch. I always mark out for her she's so damn funny!

WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP- Hell in a Cell

Triple H v. Kevin Nash 8/10-- I think people have to be on drugs not to have enjoyed this match. Was it slow? Yes. But they really put on a brutal brutal match and kept me entertained even though the pace wasn't all that exciting. Foley is always great, but he was out of place in this one. I think if anything the focus shifted to him insted of Nash and Triple H. THat took away from the psychology of it all. Nonetheless though, I loved and can appreciate the match for what it was.

Overall, Badd Blood was about a  6/10 for me. Nothing spectacular, nothing too bad though. This one is def. worth a rent if you ask me. Two very good matches and a few so so's... I'd suggest you check this out and make your own opinion.",1094256000,,2915,4.357933579335794
1891908,1,B00009W0UB,"How do I write a review for this Pay-Per-View without sounding too negative? Really, that just isn't possible because this PPV was just horrible and it would pain me to actually say that this was good. I'm just going to make a few comments on each match and give my overall rating (so expect some spoilers).

Rodney Mack and Christopher Nowinski def. The Dudley Boyz: This teaming between Mack and Nowinski makes absolutely no sense at all. Mack's character is supposed to be somewhat of a black power character and believes that the white man is keeping him down. So the best possible logic is to pair him with a white guy, right? (/end of sarcasm). Anyway, this whole fued wasn't even really well built up, in my opinion. Nowinski has promising talent, but this match did absolutely nothing for him, Mack, or The Dudleyz, and I doubt that anyone even remembered this match at the end of the night. It certainly wasn't the worst match of the night, but it wasn't the best either. 4/10

I should add for those that haven't watched this show or know anything about it, there was a ""Redneck Triathlon"" between Stone Cold Steve Austin and Eric Bischoff that lasted three rounds throughout the night during this PPV. It didn't include any matches or anything noteworthy or interesting, but I've decided to recap and add my 2 cents to them anyway.

Round 1 of the Redneck Triathlon- Burping Contest: Yes, you read that right. They are actually wasting our time on a PPV that many ordered for $30 on a burping contest. Really, what is wrong with Vince McMahon and this awful booking? A series of pre-recorded burps take place, as Austin is declared the winner. Lame.

Winner gets Stacy- Scott Steiner def. Test: I know that many of you have already written this off as a 0/10 rating, but I'm being nice since I don't exactly expect a Benoit classic Technical match. 3/10

Intercontinental Championship Match- Booker T def. Christian (c) By DQ; Christian retains the title: Screwjob finish here (What did you expect from a Pay-Per-View that I like to call ""Bad Idea""?). A really stupid decision to not have Booker win the title in his hometown, seeing as how he won the title two weeks later on Raw with absolutely no hype behind that match. 4/10

Redneck Triathlon Round 2- Pie-eating Contest: Where do I even begin with this segment? There's a fine line between a bad segment and pure crap (Or should I say WrestleCrap?). For the people who didn't see it, Mae Young comes out and gives him the bronco-buster. This whole thing was even worse to think about after it was reported that Mae Young put an anchovie down her underwear as a rib. No man deserves this kind of punishment happen to them and it's obvious that McMahon still holds a grudge against Bisch after all these years.

Raw Tag Team Championship- La Resistance def. Kane and Rob Van Dam (C) to win the titles: How many times have we had to see the whole ""Anti-American"" gimmick done? The only time it has ever been succesful was in 1997 with the whole Hart Foundation storyline. Can't the WWE get the hint? Yeah, it's nice to see young up-and-commers get a a nice push, but La Resistance are very green in the ring and need more training. 1/10

Goldberg def. Chris Jericho: Poor Jericho. When will the burying stop? This match wasn't so bad, and NOT because of Goldberg, but because Jericho shows just what an amazing performer he is by actually pulling a good match out of Goldberg. 6/10

Ric Flair def. Shawn Michaels: A battle of the old hasbeens (well, Flair is still all-right as long as he puts over younger talent, but I just plain don't like Shawn Michaels). As much as I hate Shawn Michaels, I can't deny that he is an excellent wrestler and puts on lots of good matches, but he should retire though. 6/10

Redneck Triathlon Round 3- Singing contest: WHY?? It's not even really clear who wins this (and does it really matter?). Thankfully, this is the last of these stupid segments, but it ended up taking 30 minutes out of the whole PPV. Honestly, is there anyone that actually enjoyed these segments?

Hell In A Cell for the Raw Championship (with special referee Mick Foley)- Triple H def. Kevin Nash: This has to be the worst Hell In A Cell match ever. They didn't even go outside of the Cell or go on top of it. What the hell is with that. Basically, when people think of Hell I A Cell, they think of big bumps off of the top of the Cell, this obviously didn't happen in this match. Why most HHH not only ruin other wrestler's overness (like Jericho), but he also ruins the legacy of the Hell In A Cell with this match. Mick Foley proves himself to be a sell-out and tarnishes his legacy by reffing this match. 0.5/10 (The only reason it got this rating instead of a 0/10 is because of Mick Foley).

Bad Blood was the very first split-brand PPV, and if all of the split-brand events will be this bad, then don't be suprised if the WWE goes out of business in two months.

Strongest recommendation to avoid, unless you actually enjoy seeing 80 year old women in thongs.",1093219200,9,5039,4.536343612334802

1891910,4,B00009W0UB,"This is a pretty damn good Pay-Per-View. I bought this around the time of Bad Blood 2004, thinking it would be good, and I made no mistake. The opening match has Chris Nowinski & Rodney Mack against the Dudley Boyz in tag team competition, in an alright match with an interesting backstory, with Teddy Long kind of pressuring D-Von Dudley to leave his white brother Bubba Ray and join Teddy's group of African-Americans. Then, why is Nowinski in there with Teddy and his gang? Weird. And what happened to Nowinski and Mack? And why did Nowinski wear that stupid Phantom of the Opera mask?
Other matches include Booker T vs. Christian for the Intercontinental Title, a pretty good match. I would've liked to see the Booker Man win out in the end, though. After his World Title shot against Triple H at WrestleMania, the loss cost him a lot, and here he is against a mid-carder like Christian.
Kane & Rob Van Dam against La Resistance for the Tag Titles is a mediocre match, not one of the two teams' best bouts. Kane & RVD seem to be in the process of breaking up. When Kane came down to the ring, they went back to his old music. What happened to Slow Chemical by Finger Eleven? Weird.
The highlights are Shawn Michaels vs. Ric Flair, one of the best matches of 2003 in my opinion. If not for fellow Evolution member Randy Orton's interference, it would've been an even better match-up.
Goldberg faces off against Chris Jericho in an overhyped bout that had good build-up and a great story going in, but just didn't seem to cut it in the ring. I hate how they made Goldberg win. Jericho should've won that match.
Scott Steiner battles Test for Stacy Keibler's managerial services in a fued that would mid-card several PPVs during 2003. An alright match-up, and Stacy ends up being with the bigger-armed of the two men.
The Redneck Triathalon was stupid and disgusting. Burping contests? Mae Young in a thong? C'mon, Vince. This is terrible.
The main event World Title match, Hell in a Cell with Mick Foley as referee pits Triple H, the champion, against former friend Kevin Nash in a pretty good bout that goes back to the ECW roots. Unfortunately, Nash and HHH don't go on top of the cage, which no one seems to want to do anymore. A solid main event with a great storyline.
Overall, a pretty good DVD and a pretty good Pay-Per-View. Good theme song for it too (""Headstrong"" by Trapt).",1089590400,,2386,4.551162790697674

Steiner vs Test-Wasnt a good match. Test and Steiner are just plain old boring they couldn't put on a good match together if they tried. Atleast we got to see Stacy out in the ring. Scott Steiner beats Test after Stacys destractions. 6/10
Booker T vs the CLB-Christian is a wimp,he got himself disqualifyed so he didn't have to fight Booker T.A stupid ending with Christian hitting Booker T with the championchip belt. Too short aswell would have been a good match if it wasn't for the CLB getting disqualifyed. Christian retains. 5/10
Kane/RVD vs La Resistance-I like the team of Dupree and Gronjae or what ever their names are. They put on a great show in this match and ended up with the tag team gold. This match caused the end of the partnership between RVD and Kane when Van Dam hit kane with his moonsault costing them the match and the titles. Pretty good match after what we've seen so far. 8/10
Goldberg vs Jericho(king of the world)-After everything these two have been through the match wasn't good or long enough. Goldberg is a boring wrestler to watch in all his performances including Wrestlemania 20. I expected this match to be better,it was very disappointing. Jericho should have won but Goldberg wins again with the spear and Jackhammer. 6/10
HBK vs Ric Flair-Woooooooooooooo great match between 2 icons. My favourite part was when Flair got elbowed through the table by a high flying Shawn Michaels. I like both of these guys so I didn't care who wins. Ric Flair does it again with the help of Randy Orton and a steel chair. SPECTACULAR MATCH!!! 9.5/10
Red Neck Triathlon-An entertaining contest throughout the night with some weird events. Stone cold wins the burping contest,Biscoff wins the pie eating contest and Stone Cold wins it by throwing Biscoff in the smelly pig pen. Great contest 8/10

Test vs Steiner 7/10- was very suprised. expected boredom. was much better than their insurrextion match. having Stacy as incentive for the winner was a great angle. Test looked good& Steiner is improving a little. Is this the same Steiner that once did some of the best aerial moves or an imposter?

Flair vs Michaels 7.5/10- battle of the legends. too bad this match couldn't have happened 10 years ago. was pretty good but should have had more time. it is a shame that Flair at 53 yrs old is still better than half of the Raw roster. screw job ending should have been left out.
Bischoff vs Austin(Redneck Triathlon) 5/10- burping contest was hilarious, but it went downhill after that. pie eating contest was disgusting with Mae Young. sing off & pig pen was alright. Austin has great comedy potential. very funny in spots.
Triple HHH vs Nash(Hell In A Cell for World Title) 5.5/10- not a great hell in a cell. having Mick Foley as referee was a great idea. at times looked like an ECW match with all the blood and weapons used. 1st 10 min. was boring & crowd was dead.

-Christopher Nowinski & Rodney Mack vs The Dudley Boys
I really like Nowsinski in this match. He was pulling off some excellent moves. The only problem is that his teammate, Rodney Mack, isn't the right partner for him. Nothing against Mack, but they have different styles and very few tag teams can have different styles and be good. OK match to start us off.
**/*****
-Scott Steiner vs Test
The winner gets Stacy Keibler in their corner. Scott had gotten a little better in the conditioning department by this PPV, but still had a little to work on. His moves improved vastly since his return to the WWE around late 2002. He could pick the pace up a little, which is always a good thing for big men.
**/*****
-Christian (c) vs Booker T
For the Intercontinental Championship. Good matchup between these two. Christian has some great tools to make it big time later in his career, and Booker was pulling off some nice moves as well. These two guys can work a good match with each other, but the ending was trash.
***/*****
-RVD and Kane (c) vs La Resistance
For the World Tag Team Championship. Pretty good match overall, but there wasn't enough action in it for me. RVD's unusual style with Kane's powerhouse style makes for an exciting team that you really don't know what you're going to get out of.
***/*****
-Goldberg vs Chris Jericho
Good solid match between the two. Jericho, as always, was impressive. This was really my first time seeing Goldberg, as I didn't watch WCW, and to be honest, I didn't really see what the big deal was. The jackhammer was good though. The one thing I'll remember about this PPV was the guy in the front row in the Tigger outfit, holding a ""I'm a Jerichoholic"" sign, and trying to start a ""Goldberg Sucks"" chant.

HBK isn't what he used to be, and it shows a little. However, he can still put on a match, and then you add in the world's greatest (pro) wrestler Ric Flair, and that sums it up.

Guest Referee: Mick Foley
Triple H vs Kevin Nash--Everyone knocks Triple H in general but he actually becomes ""hardcore"" in this match. Screwdrivers, chairs, tool box, barbed wired two-by-four with a strap to actually put on the post, etc. Not the usual swinging that goes with the barbed wire two-by-four. Bloody match, everyone bleeds. Hunter, Nash, Foley and MR. SOCKO! When you see the match, you can tell that Foley doesn't want Triple H to win. But I won't give away much of the match. 10/10
Shawn Michaels vs Ric Flair--Personally, I thought it was a little overhyped. But it was even rumored to be the MAIN EVENT, over the World Championship/Hell in a Cell match. But when you see this match, it was defiently worth the hype. A true match of legends and HBK was really holding his own even with the cross body drop on a table landing on Flair and thought it was going to get better until Randy Orton saws up and ruins the fun. I can't wait till HBK gives Orton some ""Sweet Chin Music"". 10/10
Goldberg vs Chris Jericho--Started off kind of slow but as it went on you can tell that Jericho was fading and fading fast. Goldberg gets injuried in the match and continues, showing why he is ""Da Man"". 9/10
World Tag Team Titles
Kane & Rob Van Dam vs La Resistance--If it wasn't for RVD, this match would had been more boring then Lance Storm. Kane and RVD put up a good fight until they lost to the upstart La Resistance. Sadly, this would be the last time RVD and Kane would be a tag team. 3/10
Intercontinetal Title
Christian vs Booker T--I don't know. I really don't think having Christian as the I-C champ is good. Always walking out and getting counted out. Thankfully, Jack Doan (referee) tells Christain he must return or he will lose the I-C title and then breezes through and continues his reign as the ""Greatest Intercontinetal Champion"". 5/10
Test vs Scott Steiner Winner has (Stacy Keibler as there Manager)Oh man!!! I think every guy in the arena wishes he could had been in the match but I'll keep my love for Stacy a little low-key. Actually thought this was the ""unsung match winner"". Good overall match and you couldn't get the smile off of Stacy afterwards. 7/10
Rodney Mack & Chris Nowinski vs Dudley Boyz--Whats Chris Nowinski, the Havard grad, doing with Rodney Mack and Teddy Long. Skip this one, not a good opening match, zzzZZZzzz. 1/10
Redneck Triathlon
Stone Cold Steve Austin vs Eric Bischoff--I thought it was hysterical. Burping contest, oh man I really felt bad for Terri Runnels. She was there right in the middle of the ""gas"". Pie Eating Contest, I'm not going to tell you what happend. All I'll say is: Mae Young, World's Oldest Thong, Bronco Buster, OH LORD! Singing Contest, Stone Cold busts Bischoff for lip-singing.

The Dudleyz vs. Rodney Mack & Christopher Nowinski-very bad match, The Dudleyz looks like they are rookie when they are here since almost 5 years. That match was bad from the beginning to the end. 0/5

1891931,2,B00009W0UB,"For its first independent PPV offering, RAW submitted every big name on its roster but came up with a PPV that was far less than the sum of its parts.
1. Dudleys vs. Rodney Mack & Chris Nowinski
This match received virtually no background on the Raw televised shows whatsoever - Nowinski jumps Bubba Ray to give Mack the win on the Raw before Bad Blood, and thus we're forced to suffer through this match. Nowinski is a top-class athlete and could be a big star one day, but the Dudleys are stale and Mack needs to learn some moves before justifying his one-loss record to date.
2. Scott Steiner vs. Test (Winner gets Stacey Keibler)
A fairly good match with a long, storied background. It's a good thing the WWE loves dangling women as the prize for winning a match (they did it before, in 1997, when they dangled Terri between Goldust and the late Brian Pillman). Steiner slips off the apron to open the match but recovers gracefully and turns it into a chop-block. Ended the only way it could, which was OK with me.
3. Intercontinental Championship: Christian vs. Booker T
These guys have had excellent matches together over the last few months, but this one was unspectacular. Christian's IC reign has been the ugliest in the belt's history, and this match only served to further taint his already dubious legacy. Book deserves better and, thankfully, he'd get it a few weeks later.
4. World Tag Team Championship
Kane & RVD vs. La Resistance
Blah. La Resistance are not nearly impressive enough in the ring to justify beating two stars like Kane and Rob Van Dam under any circumstances, but the upside of their win is that the breakup of Kane and RVD set the great Kane unmasking storyline in motion. The match itself? Nothing, nothing to write home about. Raw needs new tag teams to justify the belts.
5. Goldberg vs. Chris Jericho
It couldn't have been more obvious going in that Goldberg was going to win, deflating what was otherwise an interesting feud. The problem is that Goldberg is ripping through the Raw roster so quickly that he'll soon run out of adversaries to beat upon. The match was OK - Goldberg's never been good in the ring, but Jericho carries him the whole way. Predictable ending.
6. Shawn Michaels vs. Ric Flair
A fairly good match, but Flair is just much too slow at this point to put on a quality show. His moves were never very varied or spectacular, but now he can't even pull off his limited schtick (he actually managed to botch his famous flip over the turnbuckle bit). It's rather sad to watch, actually. People may point to Michaels' one big spot to justify things, but it's too short, too stunted, and tainted by much too stupid an ending to stand as the great match it could have been....ten years ago.
7. World Heavyweight Championship Hell in the Cell Match
Triple H vs. Kevin Nash
Better than one would expect, but still a relative snore-fest. Watching two behemoths like this pound away on each other recalls the days of Hulk Hogan vs. King Kong Bundy as a WrestleMania main event...and that's not a good thing. HHH and Nash break out all the token Hell in a Cell weapons and tricks, but it's not enough to save a scatterbrained feud that no one cared about.
Overall, a decent show, but as you can see, no match really stands out as a winner, and the overall quality suffers. If you're looking for a 2003 WWE DVD to buy, you're better off with WrestleMania XIX, the Royal Rumble, or No Way Out.",1059609600,2,3438,4.555735056542811

The two ferocious combatants tore into each other, using steel chairs, ring steps, a hammer, a sledgehammer, a screw driver, and even the infamous 2x4 wrapped in barbed wire!!! The result is a bloodbath, and Mick Foley even serves as the special guest referee.
Shawn Micheals takes on Ric Flair in a matchup that I expected to be a classic. Unfortunately, it wasn't that much of a classic, but still fairly good. I like the part where Shawn frog-splashes Ric Flair through a wooden table at ringside.
The match between Booker T and Christian was doing pretty good until Christian chickened out and got himself disqualified. That stinks!!!
Scott Steiner takes on Test to determine who gets Stacy Keabler for manager. Test did a good job getting heat from the crowd. Steiner does his job and teaches Test a lesson. Not too bad of a match.
The redneck contest between Eric Bischoff and Steve Austin is absolutely hilarious and quite interesting. Austin humiliates Eric by beating him in a burping contest, and finally throwing him in a muddy pig pen. Oh, and the ""poon-tang pie scene"" involving 70 year old Mae Young is outrageously funny.

7993478,2,B00009W0UB,"RAW's Badd Blood was the first brand exclusive event after the brands became separate entities in 2002, and it wasn't a good sign for things to come as the event was a worthless undercard topped by a handful of interesting matches featuring top superstars. Thankfully, the WWE would rectify this by the next event, Vengeance 2003.

The major problem with this show is that the first half is filled with dull, unimportant matches that didn't seem to matter in the long run. If you see old events from he early 80's, this show had a similar feel with all of the early matches just being there as a prelude for the stuff fans actually wanted to see. Some of the matches were okay, such as the Tag Titles Match between La Resistance and RVD/Kane and an passable IC Title match with Christian and Booker T. Sadly, the rest of the undercard mostly involves superstars like Rodney Mack and Scott Steiner.

The final three matches are the ones people wanted to see: Goldberg vs. Jericho, Ric Flair vs. Shawn Michaels and Triple H vs. Nash in the Hell in a Cell. None of these matches are classic encounters or must watch matches, but all three deliver strong contests. My personal favorite was the Jericho/Goldberg match as both men made it seem like a personal grudge match, a feeling that most wrestling matches lack.

There's some extra-curricular nonsense involving Steve Austin and Eric Bischoff, but, for the most part, Badd Blood's appeal is dependent on how much you like the top three matches.

7993480,2,B00009W0UB,"The Dudley Boyz vs. Christopher Nowinski & Rodney Mack w/ Theodore Long

This match was somewhat slow. Before the match, Nowinski, Mack and Theodore Long confronted D-Von Dudley and asked why his ""white brother was always making him get the tables."" Which had somewhat of an impact on the match.
The match itself was relatively slow, didn't feel much like a pay-per-view match. I do have to say that it is a crying shame that Chris Nowinski's in-ring career was ended so prematurely, I think he had the confidence, ego and the skills to become a top heel on Raw.
But anyway, match was rather average, The Dudleyz cleared the ring, then Bubba of course shoved D-Von and told him to get the tables. But then Theodore Long had an altercation with D-Von, making enough of a distraction for Nowinski to hit Bubba with his metal face mask and get the pinfall.

1.5/5 - Needed to be a bit faster paced. I didn't overly care about Rodney Mack, and Teddy Long could've made more of an impact and brought more heat for the team.

Test vs. Scott Steiner
{Winner Gets Stacy Keibler's Managerial Services}

Scott Steiner has put on some pretty awkward and horrible matches in the WWE. He was immeditately throw in the main event against Triple H when he debuted on Raw, but after some terrible matches, was dropped down to midcard. I think this was a good move for him. Steiner's far from the best in the ring, he seems a bit clumsy at times, however, this was one of his better matches. There were a few rough spots, but overall it was entertaining, and Test makes a great heel.
Test tried bringing a chair into the ring, but Steiner ducked it then hit with a reverse STO to get the win.

3/5

{WWE Intercontinental Championship}
Christian (c) vs. Booker T

This was a really decent match, which was to be expected. Both Christian and Booker T are great wrestlers who both should be at the main event level.
Crowd popped pretty loud for Booker T, being the hometown favourite in Houston. Booker T gained a lot of momentum and went for the Scissor Kick, but Christian ducked it, then got himself disqualified by hitting Booker T with the title belt.

3.5/5 (could've been match of the night if they were given more time, but as it was, it was just a bit too short)

{World Tag Team Championship}
Rob Van Dam & Kane (c) vs. La Resistance

I'm someone that's against two main eventers being given the tag team titles, but I have to admit that I did catch on to RVD and Kane. Their promos were entertaining, and they did have a somewhat mismatched yet enjoyable chemistry in the ring.
La Resistance also make good heels, the crowd hate them and so that means they're doing their job.
The end came when RVD went for a somersult plancha over the top rope to La Resistance,  but missed and hit Kane instead. La Resistance then gave him a two-man spinebuster in the ring to pick up the win and become the new tag champs, paving the way for the RVD/Kane feud.
Overall the match was alright, Van Dam was the most entertaining part, but it was still a pretty short match. Nothing to write home about.
This match is also noteworthy as being the last pay-per-view that Kane appeared on with his mask.

2.5/5 (needed to be longer)

Chris Jericho vs. Goldberg

This was actually a very good match. To me, most Goldberg matches are very hit and miss. He needs the right opponent to bring a good match out of him, and Chris Jericho brought the best out of him I think. It had a good build up and psychology to it, with Goldberg obsessed with getting his hands on Chris Jericho.
Early in the match, Goldberg tried spearing Y2J at ringside, but missed and sent himself through the ring barricade injuring his shoulder. The rest of the match was spent focussing on Goldberg selling his shoulder and Jericho capitalizing.
But of course it ended with a spear and a jackhammer. Still it was a great match, one of the best of the night.

4/5 (it didn't drag, it was never boring. The ending was predictable, but still entertaining.)

Ric Flair vs. Shawn Michaels

This was a solid match. Could have possibly been better, it felt like something was missing, but it was still entertaining. We still got to see it all, vintage Flair and vintage Michaels, we even got to see HBK splash Flair through a table at ringside. The ending was kind of cheap though, Randy Orton interfered and hit Shawn Michaels with a chairshot, allowing Ric Flair to win by pinfall.

3.5/5

{World Heavyweight Championship}
{Hell In A Cell}
Triple H (c) vs. Kevin Nash
Special Guest Referee: Mick Foley

This was an okay main event, better than their match at Judgement Day, still it won't be remembered as one of the best Hell in a Cell matches. It was plenty violent and brutal, and had a lot of use of steel steps, chairs, a toolbox and a barbed wire 2x4 which seems to be a tradition with Hell In A Cell these days. Foley got involved in the match here and there and ended up giving Triple H the manible claw, but by the end of it, all three men were bloodied and beaten down. Triple H hit with a Pedigree to get the win and retain the belt.
All up it was an okay match, but Kevin Nash just isn't all that amazing to watch in the ring, and there isn't much Triple H can do without making either himself or Nash look weak in the process.

3.5/5

Overall, Bad Blood is an okay pay-per-view. Far from great, and felt much more like a three hour edition of Raw to me, with a Hell In A Cell main event. It had the Red Neck Triathlon happening through the PPV, which on one hand was very entertaining and reminded me of how much fun it was to watch Bischoff and Stone Cold's back and forths as co-general managers. But on the other hand, it took up a lot of time which could have been used for an eighth match, or could have even made the Intercontinental and Tag Team title matches longer and more entertaining.

Highlights:

*Chris Jericho vs. Goldberg - probably the match of the night in my view, with Flair vs. HBK and Hell In A Cell tying for second.
*Eric Bischoff getting hurled into a pig pen full of manure at the end of the Red Neck Triathlon.
*Mick Foley's return to Hell In A Cell, even if it was in a referee capacity.
*Shawn Michaels putting Ric Flair through a table.

Critcisms:

*A lot matches were too short to make room for the Austin/ Bischoff contest. RVD and Kane could have put on a better match against La Resistance if they were given a few more minutes.
*Booker T and Christian, while good, had a disappointing ending. It needed to be longer and have a different ending worked out. Nobody wants to spend $25 on a pay-per-view to see the Intercontinental title match end in a disqualification, and I'm sure the Houston crowd didn't want to spend all that money on their tickets to see the hometown favourite get beaten with a belt shot.
*Card could have been bigger and better. But like I said, it felt much more like an extended episode of Raw. There were only seven matches, there were no diva matches whatsoever, and the matches that had potential were ended prematurely.

Overall, the only things that are really to be enjoyed by getting this DVD are the Jericho vs. Goldberg match, Flair vs. HBK and the Red Neck Triathlon for it's comedic value. Hell In A Cell would also be a big selling point for most people, but there are better Cell matches out there (i.e. every Hell In A Cell match with The Undertaker). But this show also suffered from a limited roster. This was the first single brand PPV, and back then Raw was really known more for being entertainment based, and with less wrestling than SmackDown. Hell In A Cell was the main event here to draw in more viewers and to distract from what is a relatively weak undercard. The first SmackDown only PPV was much better than this, I'd recommend seeing Vengeance over Bad Blood.

7993481,4,B00009W0UB,"I remember watching this PPV live and nearly died laughing watching the redneck triathlon which is the main reason for purchasing this. I borrowed Stone Cold Truth from a friend, which showed this as being listed in the extras of that DVD but it wasn't, which was disappointing! There was a certain magic about the feud between Austin & Eric Bischoff, maybe it worked so well due to Eric firing Austin from WCW. Austin is not only a hall of famer and a true legend but I believe Eric, was very good for the WWE at this time. If you haven't seen these two perform hire this for some great laughs. Other matches of note are - Goldberg V Jericho - a very good match 8/10. Shawn Michaels V Ric Flair - you can't lose here with two of the very best going at it, and the cage match between Triple H & Kevin Nash with Mick Foley special guest referee was very good but I'd watch the Triple H/Kevin Nash Promo's & Hell in a Cell Comes Early, in the extras first as they build the storyline up for this match. Other matches on this DVD I haven't watched as the Redneck Triathlon & the matches mentioned make this a DVD well worth the purchase price! Definitely worth a look for any wrestling fan!",1262044800,,1187,4.28
7993482,2,B00009W0UB,"This was WWE's attempt in trying to bring back one of their old In Your House ppv events. I don't say this is the worst event of 2003. I still think that goes to Judgment Day (which was the ppv before this one). But I do say this is the second worst ppv of the year. This event hosted the ""Redneck Triathlon"" between RAW's Co-GM's, Stone Cold Steve Austin & Eric Bischoff. Meaning Bischoff & Austin throughout the night competed in three different Redneck events. The first event was a Burping Contest, second was a ""Pie"" Eating contest, and the last event was Pig Pin Fun. Those events are entertaining to a degree but overall this event is bad to the core. I'll say it now, I don't recommend this event to anyone.

Dudley Boyz vs. Rodney Mack & Christopher Norwinski
Bad opener. The match flowed for a little bit but quickly turned into complete garbage. 1.5/5

Winner gets the Managerable Services of Stacy Keibler
Scott Steiner vs. Test
On paper this looks like a complete dud but Steiner looked to be he was actually trying his hardest to put on a good match for everybody. A few good wrestling and this turned out to be a decent match up. 3/5

Intercontinental Championship
Christian vs. Booker T
This feud started at Judgment Day where in all reality Booker T won the battle royal. But Christian cheated and won the IC title at Judgment Day. The match started slow but picked up. It became a disappointment when it ended so suddenly. 3.25/5

World Tag Team Championship
La Resistance vs. Kane & RVD
This match was only here to end whatever was left of the team of Kane & RVD. Nothing really worth noting here. Just a match to put over Kane into becoming a heel again. And for the trivia buffs out there, this is the last ppv match where Kane wrestles with his mask on. 2.75/5

Goldberg vs. Chris Jericho
I enjoyed this match. Goldberg goes for his spear early on and hurts his shoulder after crashing through the barricade wall. Jericho then trys to work on the injured shoulder. It could have been better but still one of the high notes of the night. 3.5/5

Ric Flair vs. Shawn Michaels
With all due respect to all of the reviewers out there. This match is not bad at all. I feel this match is defiantley one of the most under-rated matches ever. It was very entertaining and a good first back and forth encounter between these two legends. A table even makes an appearence in this match. The only problem I have though is that the match is way too short. But I loved the ending and overall I enjoy this match a great deal. Match of the night for me. 4.25/5

Hell in a Cell Match for the World Heavyweight Championship
Triple H vs. Kevin Nash w/ Mick Foley as the Special Referee
I'm not going to crap on this match. I felt it was very brutal for being a HIAC match. A lot of sick spots involving a 2x4 wrapped in barbed wire and a screw driver. Foley even takes some shots too. This isn't a bad contest at all. It just didn't feel like all of the puzzle pieces fit together. 4/5

As I said, this event is not recommended. I'll pass on this event if I was you.",1232755200,2,3068,4.351398601398602
7993483,2,B00009W0UB,"I recently bought this PPV for..well i honestly cant remember why I bought this. The matches were quick and seemed to be rushed together. Jericho-Goldberg had a good story line but didn't really deliver. I don't know why Goldberg had a problem with the WWE. He said they made him look stupid. Did he forget about his stint in WCW? Hell in the Cell was a good match but short. It started off as a match then got into a street fight. The hammer shots by Triple H on Nash's leg were brutal. The head shot faded away, so I don't know how he pulled that off. The rest of the match lagged; I laughed at the fan at ringside that had the sign Big Lazy. The PPV isn't really worth the money unless your making that picture that all 2003 dvds make.",1181520000,,738,4.1678321678321675
