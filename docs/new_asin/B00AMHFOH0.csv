8553738,2,B00AMHFOH0,Incredibly cheesy with lousy acting. I like campy movies and cheesy sci-if but this is a bit over the top,1511395200,,105,4.3
8553739,1,B00AMHFOH0,"Maybe 13 yr old boys would find this entertaining, but I did NOT.  Very juvenile and gross.",1449878400,,91,4.352941176470588
8553740,1,B00AMHFOH0,"IT WAS A GOOD IDEA TO START OFF WITH. BUT THERE IS SO MUCH THEY COULD HAVE DONE WITH IT, MAYBE A COUPLE OF BREASTS MAY HAVE IMPROVED IT.",1373587200,3,136,3.7241379310344827
8553741,1,B00AMHFOH0,Sex sells. this is true with this flick but surprisingly no bewbs. Its shot entirely at some dude's lake house. The creature costume can be bought on Amazon for $300. I bought it for the Campy but its failed to deliver except the budget. They need to go to the school of Troma and figure out how camp is properly done.,1373414400,2,318,4.229508196721311
8553742,2,B00AMHFOH0,Acting was terrible with no sex and very outrageous stupid goons.  Save your money and don't buy this particular film.,1370217600,3,118,4.9
8553743,5,B00AMHFOH0,"Sexsquatch is the funniest movie I've seen in a while. It's also the stupidest, but I laughed so much I didn't care. It packs in enough poop jokes, fart jokes, and sex jokes to fill ten movies. There is no nudity, however. You should definitely buy this if you are a fan of Troma movies or stuff like Bikini Bloodbath.",1367193600,3,318,4.316666666666666
8553744,5,B00AMHFOH0,Another great Chris Seaver movie!!! One of his best for sure. If you like his movies then this is a must have!! Cant beat it for the price also.,1364342400,2,144,4.0
