1843557,2,B00008G8BH,If you are a fan of Diane Franklin then this movie is definitely a must have.  Other than that there is not much to recommend this movie.  Robert Morley is in this movie but is under-utilized.  The movie does not age well & it is obvious that this is a 1980s pulp movie.,1163030400,9,270,4.056603773584905
1843558,1,B00008G8BH,"Sometimes, you can get a good quality DVD in this one's price range.  Not in this case.  This looks like a VHS dubbed to DVD, by some company called Platinum.  Disk appears burned, not pressed.",1152144000,13,193,4.457142857142857
1843559,3,B00008G8BH,"This movie doesn't have the best writing or production quality, but it's a cute concept and Diane Franklin does extensive (artistically done) nude scenes in the Garden of Eden sequence where she _bares_ it all (what is our educational system coming to?) as Eve.",1095638400,12,261,4.954545454545454

7982767,4,B00008G8BH,"I'll start off by saying that this movie is not ""Gone With the Wind,"" but it never tries to be.  It's a campy 80's comedy that runs with a very creative concept and doesn't take itself too seriously.  As a history buff, I enjoyed the different time periods depicted in the movie and how the characters changed with the times.  I found Roger Wilson's acting competent, albeit a bit stilted, but it's Diane Franklin who makes this movie.  She adapts to each of her different roles with an impressive versatility.  It's clear that she threw herself into each part with an intention of making it genuine.  Yes, she's a stunningly beautiful woman, and seeing her naked was not exactly hard on my eyes.  But there is actual talent there, even if it's not being displayed in a movie that would earn an Academy Award.  I believe that fans of '80's movies will enjoy this charming and winsome film.  For fans of the lovely and talented Diane Franklin....fasten your seat belt.",1468886400,,967,4.641176470588236

7982769,3,B00008G8BH,this movie would be under the cinamaxs after dark movie so you know there be boobs and a bad story,1419811200,,98,3.95
7982770,4,B00008G8BH,"The quality of the picture is pretty good, and probably as good as it will ever get.  I had never heard of this movie, but stumbled across it one way or another, and was very pleasantly entertained by it.  The story is fun, and a little baffling at times, but to me, the folks involved in this movie put a lot of heart into it.  The lead actors really give it a good go, and both are very attractive, without being too obvious about it.  Diane Franklin has such a beautiful smile, and while there are ample opportunities to see her naked, the shots of her lovey face breaking into a smile are what stayed with me.

Overall, I was happy with the quality of the dvd, and very happy with the film itself.  And even though saying it puts me in the category of a typically shallow male, I must say that I'm quite happy that so many minutes of film were dedicated to capturing Ms. Franklin's naked form.  Those moments might never have happened, and the world would be a dimmer place without them.",1393200000,5,991,4.295698924731183
7982771,5,B00008G8BH,"I don't want to be the second time lucky, I want to be Two Times Lucky!  The story is about a wager betweem God and the Devil, using Diane and Roger Wilson (of Porky's I & 2) as human pawns to prove right over wrong and true love.  The begin (again) in the Garden of Eden.  Unfortunateely, with the same results.  They keep moving on until guess who wins?  I first saw this flick in 1984 when it was new, and I was just getting my heart back in solid shape until I bought this video and Diane smiled at me again.  I may never be the same again.  Other than a bit of nudity (Thank Youuuu), it's a fun movie!",1369699200,2,606,3.958677685950413
7982772,5,B00008G8BH,"The idea is nothing new, and yet it is outrageously outrageous.  The screenplay is so bad that it comes out pretty well.  The casting topped by Robert Morley and Diane Franklin is uneven at best.  The direction seems almost hit-or-miss-but give-it-a-shot!  The whole thing is a haphazard, slapdash affair, but I do like it.  I like it a lot!",1366848000,3,341,4.711864406779661
7982773,5,B00008G8BH,"Don't go to this for script, Adult audience,very revealing, campy but surprisingly captivating. Diane Franklin tour de force, sexy, and beautiful!",1366156800,,146,6.0
7982774,5,B00008G8BH,"This is the best movie I have ever been in, I was lucky enough to act along side Diane Franklin.",1359590400,,96,3.85
7982775,2,B00008G8BH,"The film was originally released on Video, and the DVD is of excellent sound and image quality. Unfortunately, the DVD has an entire episode missing, namely the scene in The Garden, in which Satan talks with EVE.Uncertain if this is because the Master has it missing or if it has been censored in the States.",1257379200,8,308,4.618181818181818
