8041054,5,B0006B97JS,"After Kira recieves his new Gundam from Lacus, he takes off in search of the Archangel.(The new Gundam is awesome!) With completely new intentions, Kira decides to quit the Earth forces and fight on his own. Meanwhile, the Archangel desperatly fights to survive over at Alaska. This is where Kira stops feeling pain and becomes solid on where he belongs. Gundam Seed is a must see for all Gundam fans. It has suspense, action and cool music. You may think that it sounds stupid to have yet ANOTHER Gundam series but this one IS good. All the reviews that have five stars are not a joke, it is good. Gundam Seed is one of my favorite series besides Full Metal Alchemist. It puts a new thought of the future and of the current stage of technology into place. TWO THUMBS WAY UP!",1115683200,,775,4.464788732394366
8041055,5,B0006B97JS,"I Have been watching gundam since Gundam Wing came on Cartoon Network and I have to say if you do not like episode 35 on this disc you are not a Gundam fan. The One scene where Kira pops up in the freedom, WOW! You have to see it to believe it!",1107993600,,244,3.7115384615384617
8041056,5,B0006B97JS,"I really like the show.  It is one of the more emotionally involved Gundam series yet.  Even though the story is almost identical to the original Gundam, the contemperary issues are hard to miss. Things like the morality of genetic enhancement and also a sort of racism or ethinicentrism are prominent in the show. Though Coordinators(genetically enhanced) are humans some believe that they are superior to their Natural counterparts.  The Naturals question the morals behind the genetic inhancement of the Coordinators.

My favorite part of ""Suspicious Motives"" was the emotional growth of the gundam pilots and those around them. For instance, Dearka, the ZAFT(military alliance of Coordinators) pilot of the Buster Gundam, becomes more understanding of Naturals, through his encounters with Mirialla(Mir)who is a volunteer with the Archangel battleship.  Athrun becomes more fond of Cagalli, who helps him recover his wounds.  Kira finally becomes himself again after he heals, in the care of Lacus.

Lacus and Cagalli are quickly becoming my two favorite characters.  The two are like mirror images of each other. Cagalli is fierce and combative, while Lacus is sweet and respectful to everybody.  They both influence the decisions of Kira and Athrun, though Lacus seems to have more focus than Cagalli. I suspect that the girls don't fully realize the impact that they have on others that they meet.

All in all the animation is great, the music is cool and the story is getting darker by the moment. ""Suspicious Motives"" is an excellent climax to and already good story.  The English voice acting also improved as well.  Can't wait for the next round!",1106092800,,1657,5.164794007490637
8041057,5,B0006B97JS,"At the end of the the previous disc, we were left with a shocking turn of events, as the Strike Gundam was destroyed and main protagonist Kira Yamato was apparently killed by his childhood friend Athrun Zala. While we unsurprisingly discover that Kira somehow escaped certain death, he's been taken away to an old friend, far from the field of battle. Meanwhile, the Archangel finally arrives safely at Alaska, Miriallia takes out her grief on capture ZAFT pilot Dearka Elsman, and Athrun is transferred to a special forces unit back in space. Then ZAFT launches a massive assault on the Alaska base, but a sinister secret is buried deep beneath, one that will destroy ZAFT and Alliance forces alike. Can Kira arrive in his stolen Freedom Gundam in time to save the Archangel?",1102377600,2,776,4.842105263157895
8041058,5,B0006B97JS,"Well, Volume Seven, And with the series coninuing its run, I'm willing to bet that the fans were getting somewhat tired of seeing the same old Strike, so like many series before it, the show saw an introduction of Five brand spanking new  MS. They are as follows:
ZGMF-X10A Freedom Gundam
ZGMF-X09A Justice Gundam
GAT-X252 Forbidden Gundam
GAT-X131 Calamity Gundam
GAT-X370 Raider  Gundam
