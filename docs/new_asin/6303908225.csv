The plot has an interesting foundation but lost some  of it when it was translated to the screen.  For a movie released only 5 or  so years ago, their vision of 1999 is far-out (a metal arm?  hello! ) and  loses some effect since 1999 has come and gone.  Although Denzel Washington  does a good job with what he has, I think Russell Crowe had a lot of fun  with his role, but it somehow didn't fit into the movie.  Save your money.  Go see Gladiator.

723002,5,6303908225,"To teach young police officers how to profile serial killers, a software company creates a virtual reality program. The program contains the psych profiles of hundreds of known serial killers and is adaptable, able to learn and evolve, creating ever tougher challenges for the officers.

Things soon starts going badly wrong and officers linked to the virtual reality start to die. A new serial killer containing the characteristics and trades of all of the serial killers starts to materialize: Sid 6.7 played by Russell Crowe. And Sid 6.7 isn't satisfied just killing in V.R. He want's to kill for real.

So the powers that be reinstate disgraced police officer and prisoner Parker Barnes (Denzel Washington), hoping that since he once succeeded in stopping one of the dominant characters in Sid 6.7's personality, he might also be able to stop Sid 6.7.

Meanwhile Sid 6.7 has escaped his V.R. prison and taken over a silicon based robot with amazing regenerative powers, making him virtually unstoppable.....

723119,2,6303908225,"Never feel guilty about a pleasure even if the film is as bad as ""Virtuosity""; the cheese factor due to Russell Crowe's stand out, truly looney performance makes this Denzel Washington vehicle a worthwhile watch.

Brett Leonard's 1995 science fiction thriller isn't particularly well written and falls into every cliche one could imagine but it's what members of the game cast make of the material that elevates this film from one of those ""guilty"" pleasures.

SPOILERS:

Former Police officer and current prisoner Parker Barnes(Denzel Washington) makes himself useful as a test subject for a new virtual training program that allows police officers to practice saving people and taking out bad guys in realistic situations without any collateral damage.

Barnes' former CO (William Forsythe)put in a good word to get Barnes involved. Barnes accidently killed a news cre while hunting the serial killer that had kidnapped his wife and daugher. The main bad guy named Sid 6.0 (Russell Crowe) is an amalgamation of various serial killers all programmed into one deranged baddie.

Using an experimental program that allows downloading programs into android bodies, Sid's creator Darrel Lindenmeyer (Stephen Spinnella) unleashes his monster baby on the world and the only person who can stop him from his symphony (quite literally)of terror is Barnes. There are conditions for his release and that includes partnering him with criminal psychologist Dr. Madison Carter (Kelly Lynch who continue to underwhelm me with her performances).

END OF SPOILERS:

The problems with ""Virtuosity"" are multiple and include a rare issue for an effects driven film--the exposition is too involved and back story has to be crammed into a film that wants to be a dazzling chase movie. Unlike ""The Martix"" which would follow five years later, ""Virtuosity"" has no interest in the computer world where Sid is confined but wants to find out what he would do in the real world (much the same as any crazy killer).

There is the core of a good idea in ""Virtuosity"" but, unfortunately, it gets buried by all the dirt kicked up as disgraced officer Barnes must redeem himself in a series of confrontations with Sid. Director Brett Leonard stages scenes adequately most of the time but there are a number of set pieces that cry out for a more confident, visual storyteller like Michael Mann or James Cameron to step in.

There is a clever parody reference to ""Saturday Night Fever"" that demonstrates what this film could have been if Leonard had just embraced his gonzo inner self rather than make a safe science fiction chase film. Still, Crowe's over-the-top performance brings much needed life to the film and he along with supporting actor Kevin J. O'Connor (who plays a creepy hardware designer who has a thing for a simulated woman) make the film an entertaining bad movie.

Produced during the early years of CGI, the visuals are, in retrospect, barely adequate and look almost cartoony at times. Luckily, they are kept to a minimum where possible.

For those interested in the recent Blu-ray from Warner (releasing the film on home video for Paramount), the film looks pretty good with the cool colors looking solid throughout and nice detail. The film is presented on a 50gb disc which allows the colors to pop (particularly when Crowe's Sid wear some of his ""bright"" clothing). The film is presented with a healthy 33.97 Mbps average presentation.

Audio sounds quite nice as well.

Sadly there aren't any extras for the film. I would imagine there must be something for the film in the vaults at Paramount but we don't get anything. The mainscreen features the badly photoshopped cover art. Subtitles are available in English.

I have to wonder WHY Paramount is releasing this film when there are other classics that just haven't appeared yet on BD. I can only surmise that a hi def transfer was prepared for the film for Netflix, Amazon and other streaming services and, as a result, Warner elected to release it because it was ready to go.

""Virtuosity"" isn't a particularly good film with cliched characters and an interesting premise that predated ""The Matrix"" that had potential that remains underdeveloped. Russell Crowe blows everyone off the screen including Denzel Washington with his quirky, looney tunes performance as Sid and THAT makes the film worth watching.",1436313600,2,4354,5.052998605299861

723121,1,6303908225,"This movie basically fails in every way in which it is possible to fail. The only thing of slightest interest is that the Russell Crowe character loosely reminds me of Max Headroom. Otherwise this is a complete waste of time. The plot is non-existent and such as it is, not in the least realistic. Nothing of interest happens, the lead character (Washington) is ambiguous and disposable.

The nightclub scene which is supposed to be one of the big rushes kind of says it all. Nightclub scenes are usually easy money for actors and directors with the opportunity to gratuitously show all sorts of weird and captivating lookers. But we don't get any at all. The DJ chick in black who is supposed to be goddess-like barely catches your attention. Some people think Crowe's over-the-top character is cool. I don't think so and any child could do that. Crowe over-plays his role, Washington under-plays his role and everyone else is an also ran. Bad mix.

It is a bad script, horrible direction and competent acting. Not worth the time.",1435795200,,1031,4.786516853932584

723219,2,6303908225,"I am a HUGE Russell Crowe fan, and as a young teen Virtuosity was one of those mindless movies I allowed myself to consume regularly BECAUSE it starred Russell Crowe.  I knew that it was stupid, but at thirteen, stupid doesnt matter.  Watching this as an adult, my feelings are vastly different.  While this film does have two very capable stars at the helm, and both of them do try their best to carry the film, Virtuosity is a mess.  The concept has so many holes that it becomes annoying and the construction of the film, overall, is careless.  Thankfully Crowe knows how to milk a scene and a performance, and his creation of SID 6.7 kind of makes this nonsense remotely enjoyable (his sly wit, undeniable sex appeal and savage gusto deserved a far better movie).  Still, despite the strong asset, the core of this movie is so bad that he cant save it entirely.  But, movies like this were not uncommon in the 90s.",1392076800,,918,4.493975903614458

Underneath all the  pseudo-modernistic veneer lies confusion, poor  character development, illogical actions in terms of the premises established by the script, and, worst of all, forcing talented performers to look ridiculous. Even the basic premise of the roles played being part of a stage show which doesn't exist in the real world was not new; borrowing is quite forgivable, but a viewer who has not seen the same thing done in other productions, would have little idea what was going on. For the rest, it was fantasy action scenes and trite tearjerker.
I would recommend that Washington fans give it a pass unless they are determined to see everything he has done.  Pure senseless action fans may enjoy it since it does offer a  number of sequences which are pretty good on that score. To the general viewer, I would recommend not buying it; if you want to see what its all about, take the cheapest way  available to  you.",1373846400,,1046,4.71978021978022

Having no one else to turn to, they turn to a famous cop, in prison, to catch him. The deal, catch Sid 6.7, get your freedom.

Both Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe are 'A-list' actors who have been in some top-notch pictures during their careers. But even big stars are not immune from taking the attitude that they always must be working in order to make a buck. That's basically what happened here with their decision to be a part of this hopeless enterprise known as 'Virtuosity'.

Set in a futuristic Los Angeles, Denzel Washington plays former police Lt. Parker Barnes, imprisoned for life after murdering a terrorist who kidnapped his wife and child. It seems during his failed attempt to rescue his family, not only does he kill Grimes and his associates but a pair of newsmen covering the story. Barnes is called upon (along with another inmate), to test out the Law Enforcement Technology Advancement Center's (LETAC) new virtual reality program, designed to improve officer's tracking skills by hunting down SID 6.7 (played by a one-note Russell Crowe), a virtual reality entity whose personality is a composite of the 200 worst criminals in history. During the test, SID figures out how to raise the sensitivity calibrations in the virtual reality program, which ends up killing one of the inmates who's been participating in the program test.

As a result, the Commissioner in charge of the program wants to shut it down but the program's originator tricks his brainy co-worker into turning SID into a real-world regenerating android (similar to the android in Terminator II). SID then escapes and is determined to murder as many people as possible in the real world. Barnes, who proved his mettle during his virtual reality encounter with SID, is now given a chance to earn his freedom by tracking the sadistic criminal down and eliminating him. He's joined by Dr. Madison Carter, a psychiatrist, who acts as a consultant to LETAC.

The bulk of the movie involves Barnes chasing SID in various venues in Los Angeles. In contrast to Terminator II, where Arnold Schwarznegger used a high powered shotgun to create large bullet holes in the android he's trying to subdue, Barnes shoots SID with an ordinary handgun, resulting in less dramatic smaller holes that regenerate every time SID is shot. I guess Virtuosity's budget wasn't as big as Terminator II.

It appears that SID can really kill Barnes anytime he feels like it and at one point he frees him from a locked armored car as Barnes is being transported back to prison. We're told that SID does this because he simply enjoys the sport of Barnes chasing him. But if Barnes is SID's main impediment to creating more mayhem in the city, why doesn't SID dispatch Barnes right away? Obviously, you wouldn't have much of a movie left if Barnes is eliminated too soon.

Finally, Dr. Carter leaves her daughter 'home alone' which allows SID to conveniently kidnap her and threaten to kill the child on national TV. Barnes tracks SID down at the TV station and continues to fire bullets at him that only temporarily impede his movements. Eventually, Barnes has a face-to-face fistfight with SID on top of a high-rise. Despite the fact that SID has superhuman strength and could probably kill Barnes with one blow, their confrontation lasts a couple of minutes, eventually leading to SID's demise as he falls through a glass ceiling and is impaled on shards of glass. As he is about to regenerate, Barnes takes the crystal software program from the back of SID's head which effectively shuts him down. Using the crystal, Barnes tricks SID into revealing the location of Dr. Madison's kidnapped daughter inside the virtual reality world, and then saves the little girl. End of movie.

What could have been a fascinating journey through a virtual reality dream-like world, turns into an ordinary cop-criminal encounter featuring a series of dull chase scenes, once SID becomes a real-life android. The similarities between Virtuosity and Terminator II are obvious but the latter movie has much more class. Yes, Virtuosity does have a 'plot' but it's much more laughable than suspenseful. Denzel and Russell Crowe do collect their paychecks but really should be embarrassed to have been part of this vapid, cheesy production.",1278720000,,4197,4.9957081545064375

But instead, this film is a fairly solid, not bad, but not great film, where special effects and an overwrought screenplay almost upend two of the best actors of our generation.

In Virtuosity, a world of the future has developed a novel way to train police officers. They take a computer program and imbue it with the personalities of over 100 serial killers, and put officers into virtual reality training using the model, known as SID 6.7. As these things tend to go in science fiction films, artificial intelligence runs amok, and Sid 6.7 implants himself in an android and goes on a rampage.

The only solution to thwart SID 6.7 is using an ex-cop, Parker Barnes, who been in jail for a while to catch. The rest of the film is a cat-and-mouse chase between SID, played by still largely unknown Crowe and Barnes, played by Washington.

The film has cool special effects, an interesting plot, and two great actors anchoring the movie. But the script weighs things down, and the ending confrontation seems to go on forever. This film is not bad, but it could have been a lot better.",1176249600,2,1218,4.682242990654205

723372,4,6303908225,"Give a good actor a juicy role, no matter how tacky the vehicle is, and watch him go! Russell Crowe, who here gives Rutger Hauer some stiff competition in the psycho department, (think Roy Batty from ""Blade Runner"" and ""The Hitcher"",) stars as SID 6.7 in this sci-fi adventure set SEVEN YEARS AGO. SID is a virtual reality program that the Los Angeles PD wants to use to train its officers in the ways of sociopathic perps. However, in the beginning of the movie, when we're getting all the tech exposition, SID manages, through the dastardly ministrations of his programmer, to work his neural net into an actual self-regenerating android, able to wreak havoc on the city. SID, standing for ""Sadistic, Intelligent and Dangerous"", is a compendium of hundreds of serial killers and sociopathic personalities, which makes him formidable, indeed! One of those personalities is the man who killed the wife and daughter of Parker Barnes, an ex-cop serving time for manslaughter after killing a civilian by mistake on duty. What follows is a non-stop, roller coaster cat and mouse game the minute the killer inside SID recognizes Barnes and begins to taunt him, just like the actual person did when he was alive. Because of SID's morbid attachment to Barnes, the LAPD tech dept., that created SID, LETAC, recruits Barnes to go after him after he starts to wreak havoc on the city.

Russel Crowe chews the scenery like a barracuda on uppers as he relishes every saidstic, evil deed SID performs in this movie. Washington's performance is phoned in, but he still acquits himself nicely, getting the job done. The ending is tense as all get-out, with you not knowing exactly what's real and what isn't in the film, and there are a few twists taken with this premise, but I guarantee you, you will be on the edge of your seat with this flick, a flick that seemed to jumpstart Crowe's career and was a bit of slumming for Denzel Washington, who had already won an Oscar for his work in ""Glory"" and was well on his way to becoming a latter day legend. I can't help thinking that this movie started a competition between the two actors, who seem to have been in a status race SINCE this movie, as if Parker and SID are still chasing each other!

Denzel plays such a convict, an ex-cop in prison for murdering a man responcible for the death of his family.  Denzel, one of my favorite actors, really really tanks here.  Crowe, while not his best film, always carries himself so well in a role.  He stands out as charming yet deadly in this film as a test program incarnated in a cylicone body and now has to be tracked down and killed by none other than Denzel.

723451,3,6303908225,"""Virtuosity"" is by no means a great movie.  Simply put, it is a typical late-summer, action-thriller, popcorn flick.  But, it's a case where the performance of the lead actors transcends the quality of the story.  The story itself involves a cop named Parker Barnes who has fallen on hard times after being unable to stop his wife and daughter from being murdered and accidentally killing innocent civilians in pursuit of the man who committed the crime.  His attempt at redemption comes at the hands a computer program that is the composite of profiles of several hundred serial killers and mass criminals (including the one who murdered Barnes' family) called Syd 6.7.  Syd 6.7 somehow managed to break free of his computer-generated environment and is wrecking havoc on the general populace.  Only Barnes seems to have the ability to defeat him.  It's an interesting premise, but its execution is pedestrian at best.  What keeps the movie afloat is the perfomances of Denzel Washington as Barnes and Russell Crowe as Syd 6.7.  Washington effectively portrays Barnes as a man who's struggling with the demons of his failure years earlier and who wants desperately to defeat Syd as a kind of salvation for himself.  Crowe, who was a relative unknown at this point, plays Syd with as a bit of an over-the-top psychopath (which is to be expected given the characters psychological makeup), but also manages to do so with a bit of wit and charm that makes Syd seem like an almost likeable anti-hero.
Denzel Washington's credentials as one of the best actors in the business were well known prior to the making of ""Virtuosity"".  He had won an Best Support Actor Oscar for ""Glory"" and should have won the Best Actor Oscar for ""Malcolm X"".  His known strengths allowed him to transcend less-than-stellar material to make this movie enjoyable.  Afterwards, he went on to memorable roles in ""Courage Under Fire"" (for which he should have been nominated for an Oscar, but wasn't), ""The Hurricane"" (for which he should have WON the Oscar, but didn't), and ""Training Day"" (where he finally got his due with a Best Actor Oscar, ironically by defeating Russell Crowe).
Russell Crowe was practically unknown the public's eye at the time of this movie.  He had made a memorable impression as a Neo-Nazi skinhead in ""Romper Stomper"", but few had seen this flick.  His handling of the Syd 6.7 character demonstrated an acting ability that hinted at the promise of a long movie career.  He subsequently followed ""Virtuosity"" with his first truly star-making role as tough-as-nails cop Bud White in ""L.A. Confidential"".  His acting range continued to show itself in roles such as corporate whistle-blower, Jeffrey Wigand, in ""The Insider"", and as Roman warrior, Maximus, in the Oscar-winner ""Gladiator"" (for which Crowe, himself, won a Best Actor Oscar).
While nothing more than summertime confection, ""Virtuosity"" is a fun watch if for no other reason than you get to see two of the best actors around perform their craft well together to help a mediocre movie become a entertaining one.",1023408000,52,3070,4.97651663405088
723544,3,6303908225,"2001's Academy Award Winner for Best Actor, Denzel Washington really picks up his heels in pursuit of his predecessor in receiving that honor in his role as a futuristic cop out to avenge the murders of his wife and daughter at the hands of a computer-generated serial killer.
 As Parker Barnes, a cop who has also done jail time for unintentional killings in the line of duty, Washington's sloe-eyed intensity is plausible as he convinces the authorities to let him redeem himself by catching the demented and demonic Sid 6.7. The camera treats him with a lot of reverence and sympathy in the scene where he is stripped of his clothes and dignity while on his way to get a computerized implant during incarceration, and while flashing back to the deaths of his family. His tatooed body is somehow, a rather pityable sight.
 But bad boys in the movies have more fun, and when Russell Crowe's lead villian hatches into his current and more evil incarnation, he gives a full revelation of his heavy-set triangular frame, dancing about his creator's laboratory in a gracefully choreographed ritual just before mutilating himself to test his ability to regenerate. Much of the time, he speaks in halting, brief sentances, and has an appropriate coldness, as do his normally more expressive pale aquamarine eyes. One did have to agree with the self-analysis made upon seeing himself in the screen in the discoteque. He was beautiful, and he even looked much better in the purple suit he stole than the victim from whom he took it. Occassionally, he fails to keep a straight face while taunting his victims, especially in the discoteque.
 When the two leads interact, it's hard to focus on anything or anyone else. The horror of Sid's crimes can be overshadowed by his taunting of Barnes, especially during the chase scenes, during which both come across as two naughty children who need to sit down, be quiet, and take their Ritalin. Washington's marked determination in the face of Crowe's taunting adds to this effect. But it also reveals the two actors'apparent real-life amusement with each other, and a lot about Crowe's prankish nature.
 Kelly Lynch rendered an assertive performance as Madison, Barnes'partner. Intelligent young Kayley Cuoco was well cast as Lynch's daughter, the last of Sid's victims.
 Louise Fletcher had the other outstanding female lead as the commissioner.
 As they close in on Sid, his taunting becomes more annoying than outright infuriating. Crowe breaks into that wry, Cupid's-Bow-Mouthed smile of his, which while attractive, is so smug and arrogant we feel glad that Denzel gives him few good smacks at some point before the story comes to its conclusion. But it wasn't a dull chase, and we feel glad that in the virtual world, a cop is given some opportunity to correct a few past mistakes and bring down a killer. The line between the virtual and real worlds becomes blurred. But ultimately, this ode to the hazards of modern technology gone amuck(and the icky blue slime that purportedly comes with the territory) makes us glad that to the best of anyone's knowledge,computerized monsters like Sid aren't that big a problem, as we have enough flesh-and-blood ones to deal with in real life.",1022284800,6,3224,4.9500924214417745

It's not a blockbuster, true. However, it's far from ""yawn-inducing spawn of Lawnmover2"" and other futuristic crap about nano-technology and cyberspace. There are plot-holes, but show me similar movie without any.  Indeed, the plot is not mind-wracking: an omnipotent killer (RC) from cyber-space, created for cops' training by some secret government organization, breaks loose, and only an imprisoned ex-cop (DW) whose family has perished in an explosion from another terrorist, can stop him.  There is also a girl, Madison, some type of psychologist helping him in his quest (or rather getting on your nerves by providing such statements of great importance ""He likes to show off!"", or ""Oh, my God!"", with aplomb of K Jung.) She also serves as appendix to her daughter, who'll be playing an important role in the end of the movie.
DW has been much blamed by other reviewers for giving ""wooden"" and ""flat"" performance, which is rather unjust. He delivers what's expected of him: a positive hero, tortured by memories and own guilt, being used by the government that promises him freedom if he stops their creation - Sid 6.7
That leaves us with the villain. I thought that after Gladiator and other movies R Crowe will not impress me with anything any more. Wrong again. His Sid 6.7 is so murderously vital and dazzlingly gleeful that it makes the screen pulsate with energy and malice. There is a scene when Sid 6.7 strolls into a supermarket with Bee Gees' ""Staying Alive"" in the background - he exuberates malevolent mischief and overwhelming self-enjoyment (and he really scares you). Wow, I started to miss his presence the moment he's been terminated (oh, sad fate of all bad guys in the movies...). Only J Travolta managed to create a similar palpable nearly orgasmic pleasure of being entirely wicked in ""Face Off"".
Sid 6.7 keeps the plot together, he overweighs DW performance by tons, by mere charisma, having no character development at all. However, his mindless killing takes place showing his vision of us: screaming and sweating crowds around boxing arena, line of leather-clad weirdos at the disco, TV-audience boosting evening ratings at the sight of violence on TV. ""You created me"" he says, ""Killing is your natural instinct"". True, we create more and more things that reflect our God-like ambitions and creative genius. Watch this movie, and you'll have a glimpse to what uncontrollable results it can lead.

Why, for example, does the good head cop have to tell the other cops IN PERSON not to try to kill Denzel Washington's character?  We've got technology enough to create a being from nanobots, but we can't even pick up a phone or a radio.  Sheesh.

Overall, I'd recommend renting this one instead of buying--save your money for Matrix, a much better movie.",973900800,4,1164,4.814070351758794
723605,5,6303908225,"No less than the Lanwmower man again, but far more funny and powerful due to the perfect team Washington/Crowe. Even if the plot is thin ice, the story is so entertaining you must forget the basic idea (an android unleashed from from a computer strikes !)is not that well used. These 2 wonderful actors just seem to have a big time and so are you. Buy it and you'll never get Sid 6.7 out of your mind.",972777600,,401,4.220779220779221
723606,3,6303908225,"The movies premise is that Virtual reality is used to train cops in the future, but the bugs aren't out yet.
A programmer in his attempt to provide bad guys for the cops to catch, creates a super bad guy to train the cops.  This super bad guy, somehow has the ability to exceed his programming and then the brilliant programmer (under this bad guy's influence) decides it would be a great idea to make him ""real"".  Real meaning embodied in the read world via nano-technology.
Denzel Washington is a jailed cop that has been done wrong via the system.  Of course he is the convict that volunteers to try out these VR programs and when this super bad guy gets out, he's the one they call.
Russell Crowe is magnificent as the oozing bad guy, he has the face and the body language that can inspire your dislike.  A younger Kevin Spacey in that sense.
The violence in this movie though it is not the blood and guts of other movies, was upsetting.  Of course I have a weak stomach, but maybe it was the suddeness or ""realness"" of it.
At the end, the good guy gets the bad guy, but in a cool way.
It wasn't a bad movie,  the premise was okay.  You can see the ""Robocop"" influence where an industry centered around using technology to provide law enforcement is sometimes society's worst enemy.  Not so much because the concept is bad, but the human aspect of misusing that concept is so likely.
Denzel Washington does a decent job as the good guy, though this role does not stretch him at all.  It was an okay movie, I would not watch it twice though.",970012800,6,1544,4.351916376306621
723607,5,6303908225,WELL THE REASON I BOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS BECAUSE I LOVE RUSSELL CROWE. THEN AFTER I WATCHED THE MOVIE I LOVED HIM EVEN MORE. IT IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN.,964310400,,170,3.8857142857142857
723608,5,6303908225,"this movie is terrific, in so many aspects of the word. first of all, this movie made Russell Crowe one of my favorite actors, up there with Kevin Spacey and Edward Norton. in this movie Russell Crowe plays this video game  character who gets himself into the real word, and hes one sedistic guy. he  has all the greatest lines in the movie, and when he laughs (which he does  all the time) it's so fantastic it makes me laugh.
next, the soundtrack  is a great one. im not exactly sure what the hell Peter Gabriel is doing on  it, but ok. he's a good artist, but doesnt mold well with the techno music.  it has juno reactor, lords of acid, william orbit... some of my favorite  artists.
the action sequences are great. don't get me wrong, that one at  the end was sort of stupid (on the tv station roof when denzel just keeps  shooting crowe, and their fight had lots of matrix-like aspects to it.  maybe the directors of matrix took some ideas and made them better.) all  the other ones were great. in the beginning at the chinese resturant, that  wasn't bad. and at the techno rave, teeheehee.
finally, this is a movie i  have on vhs, but i bought on DVD just a while back from Suncoast just  because i like it so much. back before i had it on dvd, i would be bored  just waiting to do something, and i'd put in virtuosity, mainly for that  beginning sequence. literally, no kidding either, i would be sitting there  watching the prision fight scene and the next conscious thing my brain  tells me about the movie is that it's the rooftop fight already. thats how  this movie goes. some might make say that makes it a no-brainer, but i  liked it and i recommend it. one of my favorites, just be warned that a LOT  of people probably hate it or will hate it. its more of a cult movie, only  its not, you know?",963878400,6,1810,4.277286135693215

723610,3,6303908225,"I rented this movie at the video store and the kid behind the counter said ""Ahwsome.... one of my favorite movies"". Oh.... videoheads.
Russell Crowe was just fun to watch, unleashed and just going for it.  It looked like he probably hadn't had this much fun on screen since  ""Romper Stomper"". Just able to tear things up a bit.
Downside  no one else had as much fun as he did. Isn't that the point of acting, you  enjoy what you're doing more than anything else, why won't they let us see  that?",961286400,3,495,4.336956521739131
723611,2,6303908225,"I thought the premise of this movie was amazing, however, with the one noteable exception of Russell Crowe, the acting was extremely overdone, and in some scenes, plain bad.  The plot started out well, but deteriorated  into a sappy psuedo-romance with no point.  Denzel Washington, normally an  enormously talented actor, struck me as bored throughout most of the film.  I would highly recommend this movie to any Russell Crowe fans, but I  suggest avoiding it otherwise.",959644800,,472,5.144736842105263
723612,3,6303908225,Russell Crowe's gleefully demonic Sid 6.7 is the only thing about this film that makes it worth seeing.  Everything else about it is a disappointment.
