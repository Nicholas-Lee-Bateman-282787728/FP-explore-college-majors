3833078,3,B0021L8UPS,"There's something wrong with Esther!

In the great tradition of movies from THE BAD SEED to THE RING, ORPHAN gives us a terrifyingly dangerous child named Esther...an orphan from Russia adopted by a loving American family...who soon have deep cause to regret their decision.

It's an old, old cinematic story.  A child who is incredibly intelligent and somehow twisted into a cold-blooded killer.  A brilliant manipulator of adults.  A feared peer.  And for the audience, sometimes a source of discomfort.

It is the level of discomfort that such a film child creates that mostly determines whether this sort of movie works or not.  And I will say, Esther is one of the better child prodigy serial killers I've seen in awhile.  Creepy doesn't quite begin to describe it.

Isabelle Fuhrmann plays this little Russian 9-year-old with an efficiency of movement and a coldness of purpose that is chilling.  When she is first spotted at the Catholic Orphanage by her prospective parents (Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard), she appears to be a shy but very intelligent girl with a charming Russian accent.  But almost immediately upon her arrival at home, she begins to manipulate the family and remove those who stand in her way...for reasons we don't learn until near the end of the film.

Turns out, this seemingly happy family has a few unhappy moments.  Farmiga is a recovering alcoholic, who still feels the urge.  She's wracked with guilt for nearly costing the life of her young daughter Max, an adorable (and crucially, deaf) young girl...because of her drunken inattentiveness.  Sarsgaard has a lapse of faithfulness in his past.  And the whole family mourns the death of sister Jessica, who died in the womb and whose lost has deeply scarred Farmiga.  Only the older brother seems ""normal"" and of course he spots the weirdness in Esther right away.

The psychology of the family is critical to Esther's schemes...but they are fairly incidental in a film of this kind.  It's the creepiness and preternatural ""talents"" of the young girl in manipulating, hurting and dispatching her rivals that draws us in.  There are no moments of supernatural occurrences in the film...but it plays like an old-school horror film.  For its two hour running time, you'll be well entertained.

Having ""classy"" actors like Farmiga and Sarsgaard on  hand gives ORPHAN a sheen of respectability, as does the always welcome presence of CCH Pounder as the head of the orphanage.  But as is so often the case, any post-viewing scrutiny of such a film leaves us finding ""hard to believe"" moments.  In ORPHAN, we're expected to believe that Sarsgaard is UTTERLY blind to what his new daughter is really like.  We're expected to accept that young Max (aged 5...beautifully played by newcomer Aryana Engineer...best name EVER!) is so thoroughly and completely under Esther's thrall that she would help commit some horrific crimes.  And the final few minutes of the film feature some very clich&eacute;d moments, including key characters deciding to run into a dark, snow covered forest for no good reason except to set up a climactic confrontation.

But again, to its credit, ORPHAN is adeptly handled to the degree where we don't think about a lot of these things until AFTER the movie.  It has built up enough goodwill (by creeping us out) that moments that might make us groan in disbelief in a lesser film will skate by here.

To its detriment, the film opens with a dream sequence...just to give us a jolt to start things off.  Jolts from dream sequences are not earned fairly, in my opinion...especially if you start a film with one.  And the sequence itself is a bit unpleasant to watch...there's nothing really nice about childbirth's gone bloodily wrong.

Vera Farmiga is an arresting film presence, and gives a decent performance here.  Sarsgaard, a real favorite of mine, is not quite so convincing here...I think it's the worst I've seen  him.  The oldest brother is played by young Jimmy Bennett (recently the young James T. Kirk in STAR TREK)...and he is quite good.  He's a typical obnoxious 12 year old boy...but when its up to him to help members of his family, he steps up even when he's utterly terrified.  But the film belongs (as it must) to young Fuhrmann...and even if the content & structure of the film fades into the memory with great speed...Esther will stick with you just a little bit longer.

3.5 stars for this solid, scary genre piece.  Rounded down to 3 due to the sordid opening sequence and uninspired final sequence.",1248652800,3,4528,4.905263157894737
3833079,5,B0021L8UPS,"I LOVED it! It's such a skillfully done thriller and one of the best in the evil kid sub-genre period. I loved the set-up. It doesn't take long and you find yourself really caring about this family. There's a wonderful scene early on when Farmiga's character is tucking her daughter into bed.

Not only is this entirely successful as a creepy suspense film and even a drama, but it's also downright hilarious. And yes, it's intentional. I loved its sense of humor. The things Esther would say and the way she would say them had me cracking up. She's delightfully evil. Even the murder scenes had me laughing. Just seeing this little girl being so cold and vicious provided a great thrill. And not in a sick way. It was just funny.

The performances are great. I found both Vera Farmiga and newcomer Isabelle Fuhrman as Esther to be fantastic.

I'd heard so much about the twist before seeing this movie without actually finding out what it was. Despite everyone saying how laughable it was I didn't want to find out until I saw the movie myself. I'm really glad I didn't. I don't think it would have been as enjoyable had I known the whole time. I never saw it coming either. That could be because it's so out there that it's nearly impossible to see it coming. Yet at the same time it wasn't nearly as outrageous as I was fearing judging by the way it was talked about. Thankfully I didn't find it hard to swallow and was able to go along with it. Is it realistic? Not exactly, but it worked fine. It only helps that everything before it was so great. The whole time I was scared that this supposedly horrible twist was going to ruin the movie for me. I'm so glad that wasn't the case.

This is a really wicked good time. At a hair over 2 hours it never felt too long. I was having too much fun with this gleefully twisted thrill-ride.

The snowy setting was a nice bonus.

9/10 (A)",1248652800,17,1883,4.365714285714286
3833080,4,B0021L8UPS,"It's been a while since we've had a movie where a child played the bad guy, or in this case, the bad girl. This movie really exceeded my expectations as I was expecting another predictable and corny horror flick. ""Orphan"" is billed as a horror movie, but in actuality it is a psychological thriller. Any way you slice it (no pun intended), this turned out to be a very good movie.

The first thing that comes to mind while watching this movie is ""The Good Son"" (1993), but ""Orphan"" has a better plot, more twists & turns, a more deranged child, and more surprises than you'd expect. Actually, Esther (the Orphan) is so evil and mentally disturbed that she makes ""The Good Son"" seem like a choir boy. Like other movies with this theme, the mother becomes suspicious early-on that something isn't quite right about the child, while the father plays the head-in-the-sand do-do who just doesn't get it until it's too late.

This flick is not about the supernatural or demons and such; it's just about one conniving, creepy, crazy a** kid who was adopted from an orphanage and who terrorized the hell out of a somewhat ordinary family struggling to overcome some tragic life events. This is one of those movies that you can't say too much about without giving away the entire plot, but I can say that ""Orphan"" is quite entertaining and is definitely worth seeing. It has great acting, a good plot, a great lead character, a little humor, numerous twists & turns, good suspense and a surprise ending. In fact, I'm anticipating a possible ""Orphan II"".",1248480000,7,1544,4.672794117647059
3833081,5,B0021L8UPS,"Move over Samara, Wednesday Addams and all you juvenile miscreants.  There's a new pint-size queen of evil and her name is Esther.  Brilliant, charming and oh-so-talented, she harbors a host of dark secrets behind her
innocent, smiling face.  But when you finally learn what they are it'll probably be too late.

Anyone who has read my prior movie reviews knows that I love good horror
and suspense films.  Unfortunately, nowadays most offerings in the genre are long on gore and short on story and character development.  That's not so with this time around, though.  Heavy on atmosphere and with very little blood, the movie relies more on suggestion, dark sets and outstanding acting to create its air of malevolence and all pervading evil.

The story concerns a tightly knit, loving family that is nonetheless marred by tragic events in its past, including the father's adultery and the mother's tumultuous recovery from alcoholism.  But the most heart wrenching nightmare they have endured is the loss of their third child, who was stillborn.  It weighs especially heavy on the mother, who struggles daily to cope with her depression and crushing sense of loss.

Seeking to make some good come of the horrific event, they adopt a highly intelligent, articulate and artistically gifted young girl from eastern Europe.  Her name is Esther, and at first she brings happiness and healing into their lives.  But soon they find out that she is not what she seems, no, not at all.

In my opinion the film's strongest asset is the brilliant performance by 12 year old actress Isabelle Fuhrman, who plays the title character.  She portrays Esther as a complex, multi-leveled character who possesses both admirable qualities and pathologically wicked desires.

During the movie my feelings for her went from affection, to pity, then to uneasiness and horror as her deepest, most twisted secret was revealed in a climactic moment that had me on the edge of my seat.

Set in Connecticut during a bleak winter, the icy scenery is the perfect backdrop for the tension that mounts throughout the movie.  Esther first takes revenge on a girl at school who mocks her for her unusual clothing and quiet, studious demeanor.  Then she turns on those who threaten to reveal her past.  Finally the family that has taken her into their home feels her wrath.  The mother alone suspects the truth, but finds herself outwitted by her psychopathic opponent at every turn.

The final 20 minutes or so were filled with twists that kept me befuddled as to how it would all end, and I am very good at figuring out hidden plot elements.  For example, I suffered the misfortune of figuring out the secret to ""The Sixth Sense"" very early in that film.

That was not the case this time.  The producers clearly took great pains to avoid the worn out devices used in one cheesy horror movie after another.  In their place they devised a story line so uniquely insidious that it hit me like a wall of bricks when it was finally revealed.

Haunting, disturbing, terrifying and unforgettable - all these words and more describe this outstanding film.  I strongly recommend you shell out the money for the tickets and popcorn and see this one on the big screen.  It's worth every penny.",1248480000,10,3250,4.847549909255898
3833082,4,B0021L8UPS,"I didn't want to see the Orphan until I read a spoiler review that gave away the ending. I would normally never read such a thing, but I had no intention of seeing this flick until it hit DVD. The concept behind the twist intrigued me enough to shell out some money and see this movie at matinee price. I wish I hadn't known the secret while watching the film, but I still was entertained thanks to some fine acting from both leads and a great performance from the little girl who played the evil Esther. Isabelle Fuhrman was only 11 or so at the time this was filmed, but as far as child actors go, she was the best I've seen in a very long time.

I have a couple of gripes. I hated all the times the music built up and the camera zoomed in behind a character only to find there was nothing there in the first place. I know it's a horror movie, but they managed to avoid most other cliches, so why keep throwing this one around? The film is also about 15 minutes too long and I thought the last 1/4 or so dragged a little bit.

The weird and unique twist ending, along with the acting, elevated the Orphan from 2 and 1/2 to a 4 star rating from me. The movie reminded me of The Good Son with Macualay Culkin at times, but this one has a much more serious mean streak, most of which involving young kids. This is rated R for a reason. It's way more brutal than I thought it was going to be, especially in the murder scenes commited by the child.

Overall, Orphan was worth the five bucks I paid to see it and it definitely should be a rental for any horror or suspense fan in the near future.",1248480000,5,1592,4.079872204472843
3833083,5,B0021L8UPS,"""There's something wrong with Esther,"" say the ads for ""Orphan,"" and indeed, there is. I could just end the review with that, as it does pretty much tell you everything you need to know about the main character, an adopted girl who promises heaven and delivers hell. But then I'd miss out on the opportunity to tell you about all the other great things it has to offer. This is a truly great horror movie, ambitious enough to be frightening and absorbing, confident enough to toy with the conventions we know all too well, mature enough to rely on the talents of actors instead of the sex appeal of teenagers. Its greatest achievement is transcending the clich that is the precocious yet evil child, and while I'd like to elaborate on that, I'm afraid the nature of the plot doesn't allow for such details. Regardless, what happens is most likely not what you think will happen, which is to say that you'll actually be surprised.

Esther is played by Isabelle Furhman, a twelve-year-old playing a nine-year-old, although age doesn't count much here. She speaks with a flawless Russian accent and masterfully runs the emotional gamut between sweet and sadistic. Esther is a consummate manipulator, able to advertise herself as the nicest girl you'd ever want to raise as your own before switching gears and making those who stand in her way suffer. We first see her sitting all alone in the classroom of an orphanage, painting a colorful and happy picture that tells a story. Her dress is nice, if a little old fashioned, and the ribbons she has tied around her neck and wrists make her look like a princess. When she smiles, it's not the toothy perfection of a mouthwash commercial but a real girl's smile--so cute and innocent and loveable. Her words are eloquent, and she definitely possesses a wisdom beyond her years. Maybe the trauma of losing her parents back in Russia has forced her to grow up a little too fast.

For these very reasons, she immediately attracts the attention of a couple looking to adopt after a miscarriage claims the life of their third baby. Here enters Kate and John Coleman (Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard), who both carry a lot of baggage. Kate, once a successful piano teacher, is a recovering alcoholic who feels nothing but guilt. John, an architect, is a nice enough guy but takes everything at face value, a character flaw that ultimately proves disastrous.

Esther is adopted. Now things start to get tense. At school, she's made fun of for her clothing and her old, dilapidated Bible, and she screams bloody murder when someone goes to touch the ribbon on her neck. At home, she's hated by the Coleman's son, Daniel (Jimmy Bennett), who rightfully feels ignored by his parents. She soon forms an unhealthy bond with the Coleman's deaf young daughter, Max (Aryana Engineer), who eventually sees things that no little girl should ever have to see. As for the relationship between Esther and Kate, it gets progressively worse while the relationship with John gets progressively better. But Kate knows that there's something wrong with Esther, and it has nothing to do with the little things like dropping an F-bomb; it has to do with serious things, like Esther being present when her mean schoolmate falls from the top of a playground set and breaks her ankle.

One of the nuns from the orphanage, Sister Abigail (CCH Pounder), seems to think Kate is on to something: ""Trouble has a way of finding her,"" she says of Esther, believing that a mistake might have been made in the adoption process. But what if they were nothing more than accidents? What if Kate is wrong? Is it possible that she's venting her resentments on a girl who has been through a lot? Is it possible that she should be back in rehab? Kate's therapist, Dr. Browning (Margo Martindale), seems to think so, and apparently, so does John. But what about their children? Let's just say they know more than care to admit. Think of it in terms of one of Esther's paintings; when you look it in a different light, you'll find that a completely different story is being told.

""Can you keep a secret?"" the ads ask us ominously, if not altogether unexpectedly. Indeed, you should keep the film's big revelation to yourself, even if you found it unconvincing. Suspension of disbelief is required of you, yes, but fortunately, this is one of the few recent horror films that earns it. Why? Because the story doesn't resort to cheap gimmicks--it's a thriller that actually thrills. There are moments that seem to be leading up to a tired horror clich, only to throw us off guard with ... nothing. When a door or a medicine cabinet is opened, blocking the camera's view, what do you expect to see in the shot when the door closes? In this movie, you're never sure whether or not someone will suddenly appear out of nowhere. If it does happen, chances are it's for reasons other than a quick scare.

The more lasting scares involve Esther, who at one point or another makes use of a hammer, a gun, a vice, a knife, a pillow, a retractable blade, and a match with a bottle of lighter fluid. Even a car rolling backwards down a hill in neutral finds its way into the story. As has been repeatedly said, there's something wrong with Esther, a girl who makes little Rhoda from ""The Bad Seed"" seem like an amateur. ""Orphan"" is a first class shocker that begins with a nervous whisper before building to a cry and ending with a scream. Director Jaume Collet-Serra and writers Alex Mace and David Leslie Johnson actually made an effort; yes, their film is scary, and yes, their film is disturbing, but more to the point, their film is engaging.",1248393600,46,5632,4.68958543983822
3833084,5,B0021L8UPS,"""Orphan"" is without a doubt one of the most silly and over-the-top suspense movies that I have seen in ages. It has everything. A couple (Peter Sarsgaard & Vera Farmiga) who are getting over a recent tragedy, a busy-body nun (CCH Pounder) who simply won't keep her nose out of other people's affairs, a deaf child (Aryana Engineer) who can probably communicate better than most people and then there's Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman). There are some scenes where you may even route for Esther because at first she comes off as the ultimate victim and who doesn't like a victim? Esther gets her revenge, but good. I thought it was hysterical how Kate got all up in arms when Esther nonchalantly said the F-curse. Umm, lady you were busy doing it in the middle of your kitchen, yet you get all disturbed because your newly adopted child who walks in on you says a naughty word. But, lemme just say if Esther  were my adopted child I would send her to the Leona Helmsley school for bad girls and she'd learn really quickly how to behave. Esther is actually hiding a dark and very shocking secret which will amaze you and cause you to gasp in horror (trust me, it's a biggie). But this movie is so much more than a suspense or a thriller. It's the ultimate game of cat and mouse. The question is, who is the cat and who is the mouse? Remember, don't repeat the surprise shock ending...",1247875200,,1375,4.47808764940239

3834014,3,B0021L8UPS,"There's good reason why family plays well into horror movies--Amityville, The Shining, even Mama. Yes, there is good pathos to watching familial bonds be strained and broken by forces inside and out, but literature has always found rich material in family drama because families are complicated and, of course scary. When a couple lose their third child to a miscarriage, they decide to adopt a child instead <cue ominous music>. Of course their choice, Esther, proves to be the horror catalyst of the movie, but the subtext of her horror, at least at first, plays into the dual culture found within families, where parents and kids live in the same house but exist in different realities, and Esther knows how to play both sides. The ending unfortunately falls into Hand That Rocks the Cradle/Fatal Attraction area, with an unforgivable Seven-ripoff title sequence, which deflates pretty much everything the movie had built up, probably as some studio suit crunched the numbers on what would sell DVDs. But I do wonder when Vera Farmiga gets her props for bringing such talent to horror movie acting. She might not offer the kind of genre archetype Sigourney Weaver constructed, but she's definitely raised the bar on the kinds of performances we can expect.",1477094400,,1259,5.028708133971292

I was not necessarily impressed with the adult rolls played as much as the roll played by Farmiga. She was very convincing, and disturbing to watch at times.

3834079,5,B0021L8UPS,"More than met my expectations. My review is to criticize those reviewers who thought the film at just over 2 hrs too long and boring. It is anything but. Check the rating on IMDB if you don't believe me - it's 7 plus which ain't bad at all for this genre where two stars is the norm. If you like serious disturbing thrillers - and many of us do - you will enjoy this movie. Of startling importance is the remarkable stunning acting of the title character played to perfection by a 12 year old Isabelle Furhman who I hope has a robust future in her craft. She possesses this role and it is she primarily supported by a cast of great stars doing a stellar job also that will keep you squirming in your seat. I hope you don't read too many reviews here, especially the long ones as I noticed many of them giving up valuable secrets from the film. That is not the role of a review to me but rather the review is meant to give you reasons why you should enjoy a film or not without being too wordy and uselessly revealing.

3834230,5,B0021L8UPS,"This was one of the best and most frightening horror movies that I have seen in a long time. I used to love scary movies but hadn't watched one in quite some time, the more they frightened me the better. This one really was very surprising and actually made me jump off the couch. It was not predictable as many others and kept me on the edge of the couch , even my husband jumped a couple times and he doesn't frighten easily.
This was all because of a little girl that was adopted into a family from a Catholic orphanage , her name was Esther. A seemingly smart , sweet, innocent , pretty little girl but looks can be deceiving as the family soon came to find out. Esther seems to get very close (wanting to be too close) to the Father and the little sister named ""Max"" but doesn't quite want to connect with the brother or her adopted mother. It's freaky right from the beginning to the end and there is a twist in the movie that I was not at all
expecting that really blew me away. If you want to see a real good scary movie - not some low budget crap this is awesome. I didn't or couldn't move during the whole movie. I wanted ice cream but was too afraid to choke eating it ! My chest was pounding so hard. Be ready for some real surprises that you would never expect.
I am in no hurry to ever meet any little girls named Esther for a long while. This young girl should have won an award for
her role in this movie and the little girl that played the little sister (she was deaf) if she was not in real life should win one too. You will not stop for popcorn once you start this movie , it's that good. I'm still a little afraid to go to bed !  It's dark in there...",1467504000,,1671,4.033132530120482

It scares you, makes you angry, and gives you a twist at the end! I found myself yelling at the TV screen lol. Sometimes, that ruins a movie for me if I get too angry with a character and it gives me anxiety, but this was worth the little bit of anxiety I had and let's just say I wasn't angry in the end!

Synopsis: Kate and John Coleman are rebuilding their troubled marriage. Kate had a drinking problem, but is in therapy and is doing well. She has been sober for one year. The couple decide to adopt a child. When they meet the nine-year-old Russian girl, Esther, at the St. Marina Orphanage, they immediately fall in love with the well-educated orphan. Their young son, Daniel, is hostile to his new sister; but their deaf daughter, little Max, is enchanted with her - at first. Eventually, Kate begins to feel that Esther is manipulative and possibly even psychologically disturbed. John refuses to listen to his wife's misgivings, and the wounds in their marriage reopen. Kate calls Sister Abigail at the orphanage, and the nun informs her that Esther has a troubled and mysterious history. Kate delves further into Esther's past and discovers she is not all she pretends to be.",1460937600,8,1314,4.639484978540772

3834337,3,B0021L8UPS,"Careful adopting Slavic-sounding orphans, they might just turn out to be Chuckey dolls with pigtails. Yep, THAT went over well with the European orphanage circle, let me tell you.

Minus the problematic subtext, this is pretty standard for a horror movie, nothing vastly impressive save for Isabelle Fuhrman's talent, which carries the film. She manages to go from sympathetic to terrifying and right back with surprising ease for her age, and when the twist about her comes out, you almost forget that she is eleven years old in this complex role. It's worth it entirely for the glee of watching her decimate an otherwise forgettable and cliche yuppie family. And she is ALARMINGLY good. I've watched it a few times and her bits at the start are so good I almost want to believe that it will stay that way.

As far as characters go, Esther and the little one--a lovely little deaf girl with tons of charm--are the only likeable types. Vera Farmiga's character's attempts to be deep and sympathetic just render her tired and mildly annoying, and she looks rougher and rougher the longer the movie goes on, to the point of distraction. Which is realistic enough, actual people don't continue to look nice when their lives fall apart. But it's still a bit distracting. The father's character is literally broken down to four words: ""have sex with me."" And MAN does he try to get it, too. (There is a review on the internet somewhere in which his actor jokingly says he didn't notice anything was wrong, he was too busy trying to get Vera Farmiga to sleep with him.) The son is forgettable. Basically it's the Esther Show, and that's all it should be.",1460160000,,1648,4.71875

3834935,2,B0021L8UPS,"It's very difficult for me to watch a modern horror movie, as it is there are so few good horror movies to the amount of bad ones that are made. Anything made today is almost 100% an obvious homage, remake or 'reinterpretation' of something previously made. I see something like 'Orphan' and the first thing that comes to my mind of course is The Omen. The quintessential 'evil child' horror movie. For better or worse The Omen has become a yard stick for movies like this.

While Orphan did have it's own little twist, for most of the movie it was trying to follow the formula of the 'evil child' flick popularized by, yes you guessed it. Nothing particularly stood out to me about this one, but it is possible that I am just completely jaded by this tired old storyline (and the twist wasn't big enough to change that).

Unfortunately, I went into the movie already knowing about the twist, so that element of surprise was ruined for me - if you haven't been spoiled, do yourself a favor and just plunge into the movie without reading up about it!

3835331,4,B0021L8UPS,"What can I say about  Orphan? I went into this expecting very little since Ive seen this done so many times before, at times, with preposterous results (anyone remember the film Mikey?). This one manages to work and surpass expectations. It lays on the suspense, the nail-biting scenes that only the best of the genre are capable of providing. Kudos to the cast for the great performances, although Peter Sarsgaard may come across as a bit stiff (it doesnt help that his character is a bit of a jerk- don't blame the actor) his co-stars steal the spotlight with the stand-out being Isabelle Fuhrman, who plays that conniving little tyrant, that orphan gracing the DVD-Bluray cover who is surprisingly named Esther  such a benign name, Satan would be far more fitting.

The Colemans are a young, couple- the boring, arrogant John (Sarsgaard) and his recovering alcoholic wife, Kate (Vera Farmiga) who recently suffered a miscarriage. They adopt a charming little Russian girl, Esther (Fuhrnman) who appears mature for her age, speaks with a delightful accent (so cute) and can play a mean Tchaikovsky on the Colemens grand piano. She is received with welcoming arms by the couple's hearing impaired daughter, the adorable Maxine Max (Aryana Engineer) and with some hesitation from her brother Daniel (Jimmy Bennett).  Esther tries to fit in at home and school but she becomes the brunt of some cruel jokes and suspicions that begin to fuel her pent-up anger. Kate is the first to notice that there is something seriously wrong with Esther (understatement of the year). Trouble seems to follow her around, but Kates suspicions are met with skepticism and denial from her disbelieving husband. As Esthers malicious ways escalates, it becomes clear that no one is safe. Esther is conniving, she is cruel, she is evil and shes not what she appears to be. Mwahahahahahaha!!!

Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, Orphan is a solid, well-made, well-acted thriller that is in my opinion, grossly under-rated. Despite a been-there-done-that scenario, Orphan fits right in alongside other child monster movies and manages to stand out as one of the better efforts. It works rather well, introducing us to the many characters; some we end up caring for, others- not so much; even the nasty little monster provides us with moments of sweet sentimentality and this is just confirmation of a competently told story. The film is also funny in a good horror movie kind of way (intentionally and unintentionally) and has many surprises up its sleeve. Although the film is violent, it is not gory and director Collet-Serra piles on the suspense by placing so many of the main characters in mortal danger while the main antagonist is so conniving, so bold in her quest for vengeance, she becomes all the more frightening as the film progresses. The situations we are presented with here are not that unbelievable where our suspension of disbelief has to work in over-drive (this is where the film Mikey lost it) and the final twist  yes, there is a twist, makes the situations even more plausible. The actors do their jobs well and all characters are believably played out. Although John Coleman is rather obnoxious and not very likable, he is played just right by Sarsgaard. Farmiga fares better as her character is more fleshed out and far more sympathetic- the recovering alcoholic who also falls prey to the sinister plans of Esther, and if there is one person in this film you are rooting for, it is Kate. However Isabelle Fuhrman steals the show. Her performance is so convincing, so bone-chillingly real, I am surprised she has not done more horror films. Her face oozes innocence and sheer wickedness  a deadly combination that is a treat to watch in a horror film. You can tell a great actor just by their facial expressions. The best ones do not even have to say one word to get their point and their intent across. Fuhrmans many scenes, where we see her character's sinister soul emanating through her eyes and smile, is played to perfection. She is sweet, oh-so-charming in one instant and a rabid, blood-thirsty pit-bull the next.

The film is not perfect. Many scenes were shot too dark to see any of the action clearly and despite its disturbing subject matter, it may not be as scary as one would expect. However, the film remains absorbing and as it moves a long, it grabs hold of your attention, never letting go until the final show-down. Definitely not what I expected. Admittedly, it was better and despite her nasty habit of killing people, this little orphan is worthy of your time especially if you're in the mood for a good, dark, twisted little horror movie.",1434672000,,4660,4.882427307206068

Esther came from the Saarne institute in Russia which is a mental Hospital for Mentally Disturbed patients
Kate gets a call from A Doctor at the Mental Hospital and finds out
that Esther is a Disturbed mental Patient who has DWARFISM which means

and that her Birth certificate and other personal details are false

Kate then tries to rescue her husband but gets killed by Esther
Esther changes her appearance from looking like a 10 year child to her true age of 30 in the last 15mins of the film

just when Esther seemed to have drowned esther attacks kate again as she tries to crawl out of the water
Kate then kicks her head and breaks Esther's neck and then the credits roll.
after i watched the film i immediately thought Esther is Female child version of Michael myers
or has similar traits to Michael myers who Damien from the Omen films
but with speaking Dialogue who loves to charm her way in to a family with Manipulation

i did enjoy watching it
Great storyline with inspiration from films like the Omen II Damien, Halloween's Michael myers
Great Directing throughout the whole film really Good thriller
the ending was terrible thou pathetic ending to the film
Esther should have been shot down or arrested and committed to the Mental Hospital
not to have her neck broken by Kate, pretty s*** ending i thought
there's an alternate ending in special features section on this blu-ray
which has Esther being arrested by the Police which i thought was better
but you don't actually see her get arrested
the scene is after Peter's character gets killed
she puts on her make up walks down the stairs to the group of police, that's it.

besides the Alternate ending & Deleted scenes in the special features
there's also 15mins featurette with interviews with the Dark castle ent' team, Director Jaume serra
and interviews with Vera Farmiga, Peter sarsgaard & Isabelle Fuhrman
who talk about the ORPHAN
i gave this film and the blu-ray 4 stars if that, i do like the film, but i don't love it.",1418083200,,2723,4.645228215767635

3836031,4,B0021L8UPS,"Orphan is splendidly watchable, but not due to any particular intensity in the scares, or any particularly creepy atmosphere (most of it takes place in a suburban home) or even any particularly riveting performance, although the cast is way better than your usual horror thriller and they go over the top selling this material. Maybe it's because the movie is so deliriously committed to its preposterous plot. You can't help but admire an unwavering commitment like that. This is like a Lifetime movie on steroids. The story begins with a fairly well-off family deciding to adopt a child after the loss of their infant. They bring home Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman) and the child ain't right. What seems at first like eccentricities turns out to be far more sinister. Gradually it becomes clear to the mother (Vera Farmiga) that Esther is a danger to others, but nobody believes her. How deep the rabbit hole goes is the real fun of watching this movie. Some of the later scenes deserve some kind of WTF award.

3836530,5,B0021L8UPS,"this is really vera farmiga's film. she carries it every step of the way with her expressive and believable acting. by comparison her husband, therapist and the orphanage counselor occupy less nuanced roles. that clears the decks for a full exploration of the tension between this loving and damaged mother and her new adopted daughter. her *strange* adopted daughter.

what's up with that child? you can't put your finger on it. yes, you soon get the evidence that the family is in serious trouble. the script brings in the usual thriller subplots that require the child's schoolyard tormenter to get what she doesn't deserve, or the mother to dig into the child's obscure past, or the bland and clueless father to get his shocking realization. but none of this is to the question: what is the child's motivation, why does she do what she does?

well, there are clues along the way that don't quite fit in but that, at the end, make perfect sense. such as: why is this child afraid to go to the dentist? and why can she play the piano like a virtuoso?

there are some witty turns here and there -- this is perhaps the first film to cast a playground as a haunted house -- but there are some resonant touches of psychology as well -- the tensions in an adulterous marriage, the mother's grief and guilt, the sibling rivalries, the secrets. but what's up with that child? the final disclosure makes her plausible in an unexpected way, and the final battle between mother and daughter is kept roaring with one twist after another. a distinctive and engrossing thriller.",1396396800,4,1567,4.6909090909090905

The phenomenal acting (particularly Vera and all the children), casting, and filming leave hardly any room for critique..  I highly suggest stop reading this review and simply watch the movie for yourself!

Please, please, please take the negative reviews of this film, both by professionals and consumers, with a grain of salt since such reviewers more often than not are not true fans of the genre, hence are in no capacity to adequately judge a piece like this.  That being said,for those who are easily swayed by mainstream reviews,  Roger Ebert gave this film 3.5 out of 4 stars which is a score hard to come by.",1384300800,,759,4.592592592592593

for me. I hope in time I forget what I saw, some things just need to be left alone.
  In what I just said may make you wonder what did she see, you control you and you purchased this dvd so of course you can look

The cons are it's not scary, the movie seems to drag on and it's fairly predictable. Despite these cons, I simply could not stop watching it. I was very intrigued by the 9 year old orphan. She was so unusual for a little girl yet there is something eerie and mysterious about her. Now I know I said the movie is predictable and for the most part this is true. I figured out the ending before it was revealed but that didn't stop me from being totally surprised by it. I only guessed the ending because I know someone who has a daughter with the same problem. Though she's nothing like the orphan in the movie. Any way, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and if you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it.

The thing that makes this such a good movie is the twist at the end. Now I don't know who decides what scenes to leave in and which ones to delete but they were wrong. I'm glad I was able to find this DVD it not only has the deleted scenes but also has an alternate ending.

I had literally no interest in seeing this movie, but over time you kind of run out of movies so I finally gave it a shot. Sooooo glad I did. This movie was a riot. I was cracking up the whole time. The little girl (Fuhrman) was absolutely amazing. Although the story has been used before, trust me, this one is completely different. It used the crazy orphan story and just twisted and twisted until they forced it to be something new. And this one really twists it. Some ridiculously memorable scenes in this black sheep tale. Look for the scenes where the orphan is playing with her fishtank and when the father starts investigating her room. Classic! Tough call on this one, but I gave it four instead of five stars.

I kept staring at the image of this girl in pigtails and choker and thought to my self ""something tells me this is going to be a really good movie"", and boy was I right. Good creepy shocks and many memorable moments. Isabelle Fuhrman, a 13 year old american actress has recieved critical acclaim for her performance in this film as Esther, an Orphan child born in Russia who now lives in an orphanage in the United states. Vera Farmiga(The Departed)and Peter Sarsgaard(Flight plan) play a couple looking to adopt a child. They meet Esther and find her compelling, bright, intelligent, and well mannered, so they decide to adopt her and she lives with them and their 2 other children. Their youngest daughter is nearly completely deaf and the family engages conversation with her via sign language. Esther at first appeals to every member of the family accept their son who finds her very odd, and he is embarrased by her strange personality and style of dress around his school pals, so he begins to resent her. But Esther easily connects with the rest of the family, especially their deaf youngest child. But Soon horrifying secrets are revieled as strange and sometimes deadly events take place. Esther shows how evil and twisted she really is. Both Farmiga and Sarsgaard make the perfect parents with strong performances, but most of what makes this film truly memorable and effective is the superb performance by Isabelle Fuhrman, who brings Esther to terrifying life. If this young actress can make a few right choices and be lucky enough to get a few more juicy roles over the next few years, she might very well become a superstar. I was very impressed by her performance. Pretty incredible work from an actress who was all of 12 years old when this film was shot. I eagerly look forward to seeing her again in other films in the future.",1367971200,4,1963,4.6275071633237825

I really didn't think I'd like this movie, but I loved it. Isabelle Fuhrman is amazing in this film. If the performance wasn't in the context of a messed up girl in a horror movie, she would have gotten academy notice, she was THAT good. Jimmy Bennett was also really good playing her adoptive brother, he even did his own stunts. Every time I see this kid he gets better and better, and I think you'll be seeing his name in films for the next fifty years.

3836946,3,B0021L8UPS,"A family of four is torn apart after adopting a seemingly sweet and intelligent Russian girl. Her mysterious past catches up with them as a series of accidents befall the family members and anyone else that crosses Esther's path. ORPHAN was a big hit upon its release in 2009, despite its many setbacks that keep it from becoming a classic in the killer kids genre. The character of Esther is written and played far too menacingly for her to remain unnoticed. There is no ambiguity in her actions, as she is clearly portrayed as being evil from the very start. As a result, much of the film relies on the shock of her actions rather than the build up or suspense leading up to them. It does, however, manage to maintain the mystery behind her shady background long enough to give the audience one final surprise! Esther's adopted parents are easily the most frustrating parents in recent Horror. Her crackpot mother is irritating and irresponsible, while her idiot father stands completely oblivious to her evil ways in light of the horrible tragedies that are affecting his family. They gain no sympathy or support as a result. If films were graded solely on their twist endings, ORPHAN would rate at the top of its class, but the carelessness of the writing cannot be overcome by the clean cinematography or Isabelle Fuhrman's creepy performance as Esther.

3837087,3,B0021L8UPS,"If you're thinking of adopting an older child, you might want to think twice, then a few more times, because some kids come with more luggage than you bargained for. The orphan in this movie, a nine-year-old girl from Russia named Esther, is very bad. And that's part of the problem. She's too bad too quick; a fact that, even given the big revelation at the end, strains the believability of the plot, which is otherwise both engaging and plausible.

My favorite character is the little deaf girl, Ester's new ""sister"". She's just cute. But I also like the parents, particularly the father Ester plays the role of daddy's little girl to while former alcoholic ""Mommy"" raises her eyebrows in dreadful suspicion. It's a silly story in the sense that not enough reason is given for all the extreme things Ester does when she does them. But it works well for what it is; essentially just another psycho killer thriller.

After the death of a young child, a couple has been debating for a while whether to adopt another child to be a part of their family, they visit an orphanage and the wife Kate (Vera Farminga, ""The Departed"") sees a young girl named Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman, ""Hounddog""). Kate and her husband John (Peter Sarsgaard, ""Green Lantern"") learn that Esther is from Russia, her last adopted family was killed in a house fire and she barely survived. Initially Esther while timid blends in well with the family even taking to playing with Kate and Peter's daughter Max (Aryana Engineer, in her debut role) who is deaf but quite smart. Their son however seems to think Esther is weird, which does come into play later in the film.

What follows is a slow reveal of Esther being perhaps just a little more than a normal little girl, as she pushes a girl off a slide who made fun of her at school, then she kills an badly injured bird right in front of the son and Max. This does sound like a pretty basic story of a disturbed orphaned kid, but the story by Alex Mace, David Leslie Johnson's screenplay and Jaume Collet-Serra's directing do lend some very good dark tones to this and they keep the chills and terror coming, even if the viewer can figure out whats gonna happen long before it does.

""Orphan"" is actually a very well done movie, it has a feeling of dread everytime Esther is on screen as you're just waiting for something to happen, there's also the underlying storyline of troubles between Kate and John from things that happened in their recent past. The daughter's deafness does come into play during key parts of the movie and while most everyone does well in their roles Isabelle really breaks out as Esther as its easily one of the most layered characters from the thriller/horror genre in recent memory.

Its better to be watched and enjoyed, course if you've read other reviews you know the twist already which I did catch before it was totally revealed however the revelation in the movie was well done and seeing the terror on Vera's face was pretty tense and cool to see. **** out of 4 stars.",1346025600,,2127,4.574803149606299

The plot is not anything original. If you've seen The Good son, The Bad Seed, The Omen you have an idea of how the movie is going to go for at least the first half of the movie just by looking at the movie poster.
I saw the movie with other people and they seemed to enjoy it more than I did. For me it was mostly a ""been there, done that or seen it before"" type of thing mixed with an inability to suspend my disbelief.

3837152,5,B0021L8UPS,"I was honestly floored when I saw critics call this film ""unrealistic"" due to the fact that everyone seems to trust Esther (the psychopath homicidal girl) over her truth-telling but seemingly paranoid mother and a typical ""It's always the parents' fault, not the child's"" incompetent but far-from-uncommon therapist. Most horror films suffer from intense unbelievability, but this is definitely not one of them. It's only because *we* see the truth do we wonder how everyone can believe Esther over her mother. What no one seems to grasp is that they *WANT* to believe what they say, and the motivations every character has are definitely not unreasonable--if they took the mother's word, they'd be jumping into blaming the child for such horrific things, and it would almost invariably end in a downward spiral that would tear an already-salvaged family apart.

I was impressed with the realism of every character. They even use the pathology ""antisocial personality disorder"" properly, and a totally believable family therapist who, like many other incompetent therapists, immediately blames the parents, not the children, for their problems. A therapist blaming the mother for her child's behavior is par for the course for many of these therapists, despite any and all evidence that the child is simply unruly, even with events that happen because of Esther.

The two biological family members, Max and Daniel, have been criticized for being unrealistic, for not talking after seeing Esther do such horrific things. This is a mistake by critics. These are young children we're talking about who are, naturally, terrified of Esther, who threatens them with such intimidation that they don't care about anything except keeping her away from them, which means keeping quiet under any and all circumstances. Such young children can't understand that type of situation and the seriousness of it, and I really don't think it's such a stretch to say they would do the simplest thing and avoid Esther entirely so they don't get hurt, rather than tell someone and risk Esther doing the terrifying things she says she'll do if they talk. If she said the same things to adults, their thinking would be more adult-like, but they're very small children not even in puberty.

Esther is also not an unbelievable character, and everyone's unwillingness to blame her despite that she *probably* had something to do with all of the happenings around her is perfectly natural. And the reason for that is because there's really no *actual* evidence that she was involved, and it would be unfair to blame an otherwise well-behaved child, and an orphan with a troubled past, at that. No one would be comfortable going against the quick consensus that the mother is just transferring her own guilt onto Esther. Not even her husband would be able to get past that in the real world. In terms of credibility, Esther simply wins by a landside. The mother is a recovering alcoholic and has periods of mental instability. Esther is a well-behaved, intelligent, and creative orphan who simply knows how to manipulate others behind their backs. She knows that they'll blame the mother the more she complains about Esther for things she can't find real evidence for. Esther is smart. The mother has no chance of winning the credibility war with no real evidence against Esther.

Anyway, people who are complaining about how there's no way Esther could do the things she does and also that other kids would cover for her out of fear are mistaken. None of that is unrealistic given the context. The mother already starts off as someone to be watched for instability, and already lacks credibility before they even take Esther in. When her mother insists Esther is responsible for the bizarre happenings going on, we're talking about a not-so-perfect unstable mother against a well-behaved, creative child who knows exactly how to cover her own tracks, and in fact likes that her mother is so enraged about it, which only helps her own stability come off as credible.

This is really an excellent thriller, one of my favorites. Esther is a true psychopath to the letter, and the way the film treats the nature of psychopathy is exceptional. It's a believable story, and the two hours rocket by while we watch Esther's psychopathy manifest more and more, and the suspense never lets up. Extremely highly recommended for horror and thriller fans.",1342656000,,4414,5.032831737346101

Man, this film is as a about white knuckled & high tensioned as you can get. It's a thrill ride to end all thrill rides for movies about evil kids! This film is every parents with their own children, who adopts an outside older child worse nightmare, & then some! It's a hair raising back of you neck horror film, yes, horror film, & has a ending that is just as explosive as it's mind blowing. You get some clues along the way, but even so, it blows your mind!

Actress, Isabelle Fuhrman, as the adopted child, ""Esther, is the personification of a twisted sick mind. Pure unadulterated evil! Soulless black doll eyes, that penetrates you to your bone marrow, & makes you realize with crystal clear horror, that a child can be a very dangerous creature! She should've got an Oscar nomination for her portrayal as Esther! She is this film! She works her character like a spider spinning a web, a web of deciet, ready to ensnare her victims in a deadly embrace of cold as ice, evil brutality!

Many critics dismissed this film as just anothe ""Bad Seed"" clone, & not a great one at that. I don't know what film they were watching, but surely not this one! If you like sitting on the edge of your seat, with your hands clenched hard, wondering what is going to happen next, than ""Orphan,"" is your ticket to parent's hell.

3837207,4,B0021L8UPS,"*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*
Yes, this is another ""Bad Seed"" movie, as I've noticed critics of the movie have complained. But I liked it. I thought it had enough twists to set itself apart. Make sure, however, that you don't miss the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bad-Seed/dp/B00027JYNK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bad Seed</a>&nbsp;from 1956. That one's the best.

Parts of the movie were predictable, of course. It's obvious from the beginning that the bad things happening are probably because of Esther, the orphan, even though we don't actually SEE her doing anything at first. After all, doesn't it say ""There's something wrong with Esther"" right on the cover of the movie?! Then of course, there's the wife who suspects something and the husband who rationalizes away all her fears. And everyone who gets too close to knowing gets hurt. Very typical.

What we don't know is WHY Esther is this way. And actually, that never really becomes clear. You would think if Esther could finally just find a family to stick with, maybe she could have somewhat of a normal life. After all, this family cared about her, and if people hadn't been dropping like flies, no one would have investigated. Anyway, we find out that Esther is really a grown woman with dwarfism. It was a plot twist I was not expecting, but it explained everything. And it was sad. Like I said, it didn't really explain why Esther was the way she was. She couldn't change her past, but no one was looking for her. She could have moved on.

The best part about the movie was the acting. I was beyond impressed with Isabelle Fuhrman as Esther. When a 12-year-old can pull off a part like that... well, that's just natural talent. She sure has not had much time for training. Too many young actors and actresses these days seem to get parts just because they're in the right place at the right time, or they're related to someone. And then their talent involves taking their clothes off. (We will hope she doesn't go that way.)

The only bummer was the end. While it was well-acted, I was thrown off by her being such an old hag! She was seriously ugly. They cannot expect us to believe she turned that face into a sweet 9-year-old girl with a little bit of make-up every morning. They probably needed 3 hours of make-up just to age Isabelle in the opposite direction! Geez, most women can barely make themselves look 5 years younger with makeup. I think a making-of featurette would have been nice, but there were no special features at all. Maybe they realized they overdid the makeup and didn't want to draw attention to it?",1334016000,,2656,4.869469026548672
3837208,5,B0021L8UPS,this movie is one of the best horror movies i've watched in a long time! the ending was something i didn't see coming at all! the newer horror movies are poorly budgeted remakes or nothing but a blood bath with no storyline. not this one.,1333929600,,238,4.311111111111111
3837209,2,B0021L8UPS,"Sometimes a film will impress the heck out of me upon a first viewing, but then when I view it again later, it seems to fall flat and I find myself questioning what ever made me like it in the first place.

I just rewatched this last night, and I must say that I am so surprised that I ever liked it. Ok, sure, it is well acted, well lit, and well shot, but the story is so preposterous it isn't even funny. Plus, it's edited very poorly, and has an entirely wrong feel for the story that is being told here.

Yes, everything good about it, like the good lighting, color schemes, acting, etc etc, all work against the mere simplistic evil child storyline here. And nothing is ever really established as to any of the main character's motives. Yes, it shows that the mother suffered a miscarriage (in the over the top gory opening scene), but that doesn't really explain to me why they would want to adopt a child (who is almost fully grown, mind you), when they already have children. ?

I could understand if they were childless, but they already have two children. Plus, if they really wanted another child, why not adopt a newborn baby? ? Anyways, enough about that lapse in logic.

And, as for things not ever been really clearly established, well, that also goes for a lot of other scenes in the film. Namely, it is never explained (or fully explored) why the children react the way they do around Esther at school. Plus, the early scenes of little orphan Esther at school had me rooting for her, because it was the other children that came across as the bad seeds, and she was just some innocent outsider. And the whole scene in the playground, I found myself way too distracted wondering why the little girl was so afraid of the orphan girl, that it robbed the film of any form of suspense that it was trying to build in the moment.

And the entire ""bad seed"" plot is kind of well forgotten by the third act, because the tone of the entire picture has shifted so dramatically that it in no way no longer really resembles what it was when it started. Plus, this was such a confused story. I don't mean confusing, but confused, in that it didn't really know what it wanted to be: Was it a thriller, or a horror movie, or was it an erotic thriller that happened to have the ""good child is really evil"" subplot? (Oh, yes, did I mention that this had way too many over-the-top erotic scenes in it that served absolutely no purpose what-so-ever.)

And the entire thing was so way way way over the top it isn't even funny. Ok, well, maybe it is, but not in the way the filmmaker would want it to be. I found myself laughing at the movie so many times I lost count. And I was laughing at them, not with them!

Everything is handled in such a heavy handed way, it robs the film of any genuine thrills it should have. There were some scenes that were shot so well, and so well lit, I could watch them over and over, if they were in another film. This may have been better serviced if maybe shot on a lower budget. ? But, as it is, there are way too many well crafted shots wasted on this kind of story.

And don't even get me started on the father in this. He is possibly the most irritatingly stupidest character in all horror film history. And especially when he actually broke down and cried in front of the orphan girl, LMAO, how pathetic was that! I wanted to kill him myself!

And that leads me to yet another problem I have with this movie (matter of fact, I had this problem the first time I saw it): The extremely over-the-top, gory, gruesome murder of his character. The way it was filmed made me feel like I was inside a snuff film, because it was just too gritty, and again, completely out of tone with the rest of the film.

Plus, I almost felt like by that time in the movie, no more characters really needed to be killed off. It was such a blatantly bad decision in plotting in my opinion. And, then, this leads me to the extremely bad, over the top (notice a theme here, lol) ending. Wow, could ""Halloween's"" ending be ripped off anymore??? You know, the thing that would not die, no matter what you do to it, you know, like, stab it, set it on fire, stab it some more, shoot it, drown it, stab it some more, and IT STILL KEEPS COMING BACK FOR MORE!

This is definitely a ""shut your brain off at the start"" kind of movie, and even kind of good for a first time viewing, if all you're out for is some kind of cheap, dumbed down quick thrill, but if you're like me, and like your movies to be a little bit more cerebral and challenging, then you may wanna skip this one.

3837260,4,B0021L8UPS,"Pretty much any way you look at this movie, it's ""The Bad Seed"" again, which has been done numerous times to better effect.  However, ""Orphan"" maintains a very creepy and intense atmosphere throughout, which is primarily what I look for in a good horror movie.  Of course, the young sociopathic girl engaging in murder and mayhem is supposed to be the main shocker, but that's been done already.  However, certain sexual overtones creep into this film which I found unsettling and very disturbing, and that aspect of this film was pulled off very well.  That is, until they ruin it with a ham-fisted and entirely unnecessary twist near the end that negates everything.

If you've never seen or heard of ""The Bad Seed,"" or even ""The Good Son,' then definitely see this movie!  If you're old enough to have seen those films, ""Orphan"" is still worth a watch because of its intensely creepy atmosphere.  In most respects, this is a very good horror film.

3837315,5,B0021L8UPS,"A lot of horror movies this past decade were extremely formulaic, boring, and don't break any mold whatsoever, but ""Orphan"" is surprisingly a break from all of those forgettable horror films. It has a great setting along with a great atmosphere (winter is a great time to shoot a horror film), and the cinematography is also amazing. The plot line seems like something that's been done before, but it was used in a great way.
  ""Orphan"" has great acting and amazing drama that makes the film hard to forget, because it is one of the standout films of 2009. For anybody who doesn't know what it's about, ""Orphan"" is about a mother who's looking to adopt after a miscarriage and adopts an orphan, who is obviously a psycho. I like how the film was about 2 hours long. It has more of a backbone story with it, more than a lot of other horror films. There's something about the movie that's really creepy, and the ending will most likely keep you on the edge of your seat. The film wasn't entirely scary to me, as I wasn't really scared from it (although some scenes were shocking, creepy, and unexpected). There is a great amount of border-line neurotic melodrama that actually works for this film. This film also isn't all about the killing, it's more psychological, actually.
  All the scenes in the film were put together wonderfully, as it resembles the ""creepy kid"" type of horror movies really well, but it doesn't fall into much cliche, either. I bet if this film were in Spanish, American critics would have liked it better, but who cares about what they say, because this is a uniquely crafted and brilliant thrill ride of a horror movie.",1301443200,3,1644,4.61986301369863

3837317,4,B0021L8UPS,"Simply put, Isabelle Fuhrman dominates the screen as Esther, a cute 9-year-old Russian girl adopted by a loving family that wishes to fill the void of a recent pregnancy that resulted in a stillborn.  Adopted by John and Kate (Peter Sarsgaard and Vera Farmiga, respectively), Esther soon ratchets up the mystery and tension in this suspense thriller.  At odds are the family's two children; innocent Max (Aryana Engineer), who forms a quick bond with Esther, and surly Daniel (Jimmy Bennett), who irritated me and Esther from the very moment the camera began rolling.

Esther appears to be a great addition to the family, what with her old-fashioned appearance, ribbons and dress like a Little Bo Peep story, but soon enough Kate becomes more curious and suspicious of the talented little girl's background.  Meanwhile, John plays the role of doormat, making bad decisions and letting his somewhat abrasive wife dominate screen time.  Rather than pimping their children out for reality show riches, this John and Kate bicker weakly about their new daughter and the effect she is having on their family.

What unfolds is an exercise in tension and patience.  While Kate slowly unravels the mystery, Esther shows wisdom by manipulating everyone towards her side.  Those against her?  Not so lucky.

The most compelling part of Orphan, and what saved the film's slow pace, was the performance of Fuhrman.  At 11-years old she possesses the acting chops to pull off a flawless Russian accent while displaying emotional range of which most adults are incapable.  With a flick of the emotional switch, she changes from innocent to sadistic, friendly to evil.  A very convincing performance.

For once it seems Hollywood was capable of making a movie that didn't rely on the one-second shock scares.  Dark to light.  Quiet to loud.  This pleased me quite a bit while watching this movie.  Director Jaume Collet-Serra and screenplay writer David Johnson have created an ambitious film that doesn't fit into the mold of most current horror or suspense thrillers; what they have made is almost old-fashioned.  There is very little in the way of ambiguity; what's evil is evil, what's good is good.  It's up to the viewer to follow a path.  Regardless of choice, the ending is quite a surprise.

From ""The Bad Seed"" to ""The Good Son"" to ""Daddy's Girl (1996)""; yet somehow director Jaume manages to squeeze out something more from the genre. I watched this movie with low expectations, which it then, turned out to be the best thriller movie I've ever seen!!  Orphan not only has great acting, but very touching moments too!  This is one of the few horror/thriller movies that actually has  characters that you CARE about!  The actors were perfect for their roles and each has character depth too.  The best part about this movie is the TWIST AT THE END!  That completely caught me off guard and surprised me!  It was very realistic and made me think ""wow, that could actually happen!""

3837321,5,B0021L8UPS,"I love the pro-adoption commentary before this movie. It's a PSA of sorts telling you that all orphans are not bad kids and the following movie is not based in fact. I don't see why that was necessary, but it is humorous to think that anyone would believe this film is non-fiction.

The children in this movie are believable and they carry much of the films weight. Isabelle Fuhrman is spectacular in her performance. She is nothing like a young, wooden MacCauley Calkin who often seemed to be reading directly from a cue card (see Home Alone). Dad thinks she is innocent and sweet, but she secretly trys to destroy the dynamics of the family. As her character evolves and we learn more and more about her, she loses that sweet exterior and we see her for the murderous little heathen that she really is. Her language is very graphic at times, but not without purpose.

The entire cast were fine in their roles. The parents, and their need of another child seemed very convincing. The flow of the film from beginning to end makes for a great thriller that I highly recommend to all. It's not the same old typical slasher film with the same typical ending... and the acting is superb!

I have been a horror film buff for many years and over this period seen hundreds of horror films. A few have been great but many of them are afflicted with the same disease i.e. they start promising but end up being run of the mill. Orphan suffers from the same malaise but is saved by the acting of the child star. Portraying children as demons is nothing new but few movies have managed to send chills down spines but Isabelle Fuhrman is a revelation as the evil Esther. I thought her acting was great.
The plot in Orphan is about the child as evil causing this already fragile to implode. The first half lays the ground work, the middle is weak but the ending is shocking. Orphan is a horror film in which the horror is without the gore, with decent acting and a revelation at the ending that can be chilling for many.

3837423,2,B0021L8UPS,"This movie has a spooky ambiance, a promising creepy, dark feel. It has great acting on Isabelle Fuhrman's part but after that it all goes downhill. The movie had good potential but the so called ""twist"" at the end I have big problems with. It isn't believable or realistic. Let's start with the beginning: Couple adopts a 9 year old girl that is mature, smart and dresses really creepy and old fashioned like an antique doll. The movie is slow and tries hard to be suspenseful but it isn't...it's just slow.

Ester is insane, inhumanly strong and evil yet we learn SPOILER ALLERT=

Ester is a dwarf in her 30's pretending to be a NINE year old girl...um...yeah...believable? NO! Why? Here are my reasons:

1) Even the kind of dwarfism where the person has a body proportioned like a full size human, they still have different facial proportions. An adult dwarf and a normal size child would not have the same facial structure. The reason dwarf actors don't play children's roles in movies is because YOU CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE VERY EASILY! This is why the character had to be played by a child actor because it would have been impossible for a dwarf to look convincing in this role.

2) The skin of a dwarf would still just like a full size woman. She is supposed to be in HER 30'S? How many thirty something women have skin like a 9 year old girl? NOT POSSIBLE! Women have Botox and facelifts and still don't look like they are 18, let alone 9! Even a 9 year old and a 20 year old woman clearly have DIFFERENT skin! I have seen dwarfs up close and their skin ages like every other human. Wouldn't the mom notice that her ""9 year old"" has as many crow's feet as she does?

3) Fat deposits. People gain and lose fat as they age and as we know, this isn't always in the best or most flattering of places. A woman in her 30's would have body fat in places where women gain it as we age. Even if women are thin they will usually lose some fat in the face, gain some in the jawline etc.

4) Hair. Hair can thin and turn gray with age. Adult hair also has a different texture. So this 30 something woman has perfect skin like a 9 year old, a body that can pass as a kid AND no gray hair or hair loss?

5) Hands. Anyone with kids knows that the hands of a child are very smooth...like it or not there is no hand treatment in the world that will make your hands look like your 9 year old kid! If there was, it would make millions! Even models and celebrities who spend tons of money on their looks still have hands that for the most part, match their age range.

6) Voice. An adult, even a dwarf would probably not be able to sound like a 9 year old. Just like a dwarf and a child don't look alike, they usually don't sound alike either.

Apart from the plot twist not being realistic the movie isn't really scary...unless you are afraid of insane and inhumanly strong knife wielding dwarfs wearing silly schoolgirl outfits! It fails at delivering the scare but it delivers the creepy. Once scene in particular where Ester puts on a much-too-grown-up looking black dress and tries to seduce an adult man, is just GROSS and CREEPY and not in a good way! The movie tried hard to be original and it tried hard to be scary and it failed on both attempts. It had blood, gore and violence but it wasn't scary enough to be a horror flick and it wasn't thrilling enough to be a thriller. After a while, blood and gore isn't really scary especially if it doesn't have a plot to carry it.

This movie made me wish for the good old days...when creepy children and scary music meant that they were possessed by Satan, cursed by some witch, in an evil mind control cult, or turned into zombies...or something that made sense! A knife wielding 30 something dwarf pretending to be a 9 year old so she can kill entire families for no good reason DOESN'T make sense! I give it two stars instead of one because of Isabelle Fuhrman. The other actors were forgettable (the parents were especially bad and wooden acting) but I thought she gave this role 100%. The character of Ester was great, it's too bad the script, the plot twist, the other actors and pace of the film had to suck.

This could have been a better movie with some tweaking. If she was a 25 year old masquerading as a 13 year old girl that MIGHT have been a little more realistic. 9 and 30 is just too much of a stretch. They might have also wanted to PICK A DIRECTION with the script. If it's a thriller, it needs better suspense, better plot and less gore...If it's a horror movie it should have crazier gore and a more sinister, scary plot twist with some really dark evil stuff thrown in for good measure. A 4'0 tall psychotic adult just isn't that scary. Also, gore is only scary if it's SHOCKING! It isn't shocking when it is overused, especially when the pace and the plot isn't there to back it up. The person who came up with this story was either really stupid, has never met a real dwarf or just didn't think of all the HUGE HOLES in the script that make no sense at all!",1286150400,4,5023,4.293558606124604

I kept rooting for ""the orphan"", waiting for her to do away with the son first, then some of those rotten school kids.  The husband got more and more gay with each scene, and went overboard in the climactic scenes.  Speaking of climactic scenes -- whoa there, who thunk up that one?  All in all, it's a terrific film if you want some real guffaws.  Poor CCH Pounder, not only does she get messed up in the plot, but the fact that she even did the picture is sad.

I mean something noone will see thier first time watching. When I found out it was no questioning that this would be one of my top ten favorite movies this decade. I did have some problems though. These weren't necessarilly problems with the movie, but more of problems with the characters.

For one I thought the father was stupid. Seriously. He got what he deserved. I also found it a bit overboard how depressed the mother was.

3837458,4,B0021L8UPS,"If nothing else the disparate viewer reactions to ""The Orphan"" make for interesting reading on these comment pages. My advice for potential viewers is to disregard the most extreme love-hate stuff; the film is neither as good nor as bad as a lot of people are saying.

  It is basically a slightly more bent and graphic version of Julia Stiles' 1998 film ""Wicked"". Both films revolve around ruthless jockeying for household supremacy, both have an erotic subtext that people seem to be afraid to discuss, and both push the envelope of the ""Bad Seed"" (1956) genre-reflecting the more extreme attitudes of current fans of the psychological horror genre.

  ""Orphan"" had a much bigger budget than the earlier films which it quite skillfully utilized in useful areas like production design and cinematography. It is very creative in these areas and Esther (the latest ""demon seed""- nicely overplayed by Isabelle Fuhrman) gets a nice dimensionality from the regular showcasing of her art. The painting of the burning orphanage is especially well done and extremely effective; being as creepy as any visual image I have ever seen.

  I would certainly recommend the film to fans of ""Wicked"" (and vice versa) and to even causal fans of the horror genre. I think it is too extreme for crossover fans, who would be wise to avoid the film or at least to be prepared to bail at some point because it gets increasingly twisted as it progresses. Unless you are willing to suspend disbelief during a number of plot developments you won't enjoy the viewing. It is a bit like ""May"" (2002) in this regard, where a lot of viewers enjoy the premise and the set-up but lose interest when the characters get too extreme or too stupid for audience identification.

  It is a long film (slightly over two hours), which would not be a problem if they had focused more on solving the mystery of Esther's background. Because the film offers viewers minimal cerebral exercises like this, their attention wonders to plot holes and the film begins to get a bit tedious.

  Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1281571200,,2089,4.79608938547486
3837459,5,B0021L8UPS,"I was totally not expecting Orphan to be *this* awesome.

The little girl who plays the orphan from Russia that an American family adopts is REALLY evil.  Her character is just fantastic.  She is believable in all aspects of the storyline.

All the violent and twisted things the girl does to her new brothers and sisters (along with their parents) will have you feeling a ton of suspense.  You will be totally shocked that such a young girl is saying and acting out all those horrible things she does.

She seriously deserves a bunch of awards for her role in Orphan.  I hope she received some.

I absolutely love how the storyline develops too.  The parents initially believe they are adopting a sweet and innocent little girl because of how polite she acts towards them.  They soon discover that the girl has a ton of mental problems and is totally sick in the head.

People like to compare this film to the Good Son, but let me tell ya- *nothing* in the Good Son is as evil as this girl, haha.  She goes straight to stabbing people, shooting people, murdering, pretending she's older than she really is in an attempt to hit on people, hurting herself in an attempt to make her new parents feel sorry for her, hurting other kids on the playground, burning people alive, and even threatening her family that if they reveal her dirty little secrets she will find a way to kill them, etc.

Every line she delivers is really mature and perfectly executed.  It really surprises me that someone this young can put on such a performance.

This next paragraph I'm about to write is apparently a crucial storyline element for some people (and therefore a spoiler) so if you don't want to know about something minor that happens later on, skip this next paragraph and read the last one-

I like how later on we find out that she's actually 33 years old and only pretending to be a child.  I actually had to look that up online to see if Isabelle Fuhrman really IS 33 years old.  Nah, that's just part of the storyline.  She was born in 1997.  I kind of assumed that, but hey, you never know.

Points to the writers for trying to add some depth to the story, but sadly, the execution was lost in translation.

The dramatic narration work out as a well deserved homage to the great Dario Argento and Mario Bava  two magisterial Italian directors during the sixties and seventies respectively.

Suspenseful and terrifying movie. Not recommended for squeamish.",1278374400,2,445,5.328571428571428
3837495,5,B0021L8UPS,"I had absolutely no intention of ever seeing this movie when I saw the previews last year - that little girl looked too creepy, and thanks to my love of supernatural books and movies (I'm looking at you, Stephen King), I find it hard to sleep without a light on (I know, I know - during the daylight everything is perfectly rational, but come nighttime, things start to get a little hazy, like anything could happen.)  Anyway, now that I am older (blah) and smarter (I think), I try to avoid this type of movie (except for anything by Mr. King - I'm still a fool for you, S.K.).  But last week, I had the opportunity to see this DVD and imagine my surprise when I found myself actually LIKING it very much!  I think it has to do with the fact that this is NOT a supernatural blood-fest and they took time to create a sympathetic family who wants to adopt a child after they lose an unborn, very-much-wanted child.  Also, the little girl, who is played to perfection by Isabelle Fuhrman, does not look creepy like she does on the poster or DVD cover.  Oh, you just know there's a story about those velvet ribbons around her neck and wrists, and it reminds you of that old scary joke we used to tell as kids-the one where the woman takes off the ribbons and her head falls off.  Well, here, that's not it at all, but the gimmick does create suspense and curiosity.  This kid is such a good actress, I ended up liking her despite what she ends up doing.

Now, I'm not much of a talk-back-to-the-characters kind of gal, but I found myself doing it here (in the privacy of my own home) and it was fun. I'm sorry, but if your wife - the woman you love and have known for a long time - and your children - those little folks you love and have known since they were born - tell you that something is wrong with Esther and they are all afraid of her, wouldn't you - the stupid husband and father - wouldn't you, oh, I don't know, BELIEVE THEM? Well, not if you're this guy (Peter Sarsgaard).  And if you are the woman (Vera Farmiga) who knows something bad is going on and your dumb husband won't listen, why don't you just take your kids and go?  But that's the fun of movies like this.  And when you learn why Esther does what she does and who she is, it makes the pay-off at the end that much better.  In all, a good, enjoyable suspense film that will not keep you up at night.",1278201600,3,2371,4.1982378854625555

Even though I dislike movies where people do unbelievably stupid things, the fact is that real people do unbelievably stupid things in real life.

Now, I can't deny that it caught my full attention that I simply couldn't take my eyes off the screen to the end of it....the end is a way too exciting. I would recommend you pay attention from the beginning as it gets more attractive especially when Ether (Isabelle Furgham) starts getting more violent, more evil and simply outrageous and the good thing is that you can't tell why is she acting that way?!!! I thought that it could be because of her schoolmates teasing her for being different, but it was much more than what I thought.

The actors were perfect for their roles, especially Isabelle F, she was outstanding; she will make you feel sorry for the ones that you thought were cruel/mean to her then she will make you sorry for everybody just for being around her.

I'm usually a sucker for the movies about orphans or abused children, and usually these things go hand-in-hand.

From the hype, I knew that this child would be one of those with mental health issues.  From the descriptions on the sites, I suspected some kind of psychosis or deep antisocial disorder.  But what was revealed as the film leads us down this path of suspense was something I hadn't suspected.  Not once.

The ending was so chilling that I literally couldn't sleep afterwards.  Warning!  Do not watch if you want to sleep.

Vera Farmiga is compelling as Kate, the mother, who has suffered depression and a bout with alcoholism after their third child is stillborn.  Peter Sarsgaard portrays John, the husband, whom we soon learn has some fidelity issues, thus creating tension between the spouses.

Isabelle Fuhrman, as Esther, steals the spotlight as the disturbed adopted daughter.  The other children are very compelling as well, and the movie creates the typical conspiracy of silence between them all, as Esther inspires fear and obedience from them.

When Kate begins to suspect something is very wrong with Esther, she can't get her husband to even give credence to her concerns.  He brushes her off as if she's nothing.  I began to despise him early on for his cluelessness and his inability to see what was staring him in the face.

In the end, though, everyone is a believer.  And not to give away the surprises, just be sure to watch closely as the layers of this secret begin to unfold.

I probably would have given this one 4.5 stars, if I could.  I deducted a star because, despite the compelling nature of this film, it isn't one I'll ever watch again.",1277164800,2,1874,5.105263157894737

3837503,5,B0021L8UPS,"This is the third time this movie has been remade.  The original was made in 1956 called The Bad Seed.  It was about this 11-year-old girl who, although looked cute and innocent with those blonde pigtails, was really in fact evil.  I watched snippets of the film and didn't find it scary at all.  Then in 1993 there was ""The Good Son"", starring Macaulay Culkin and Elijah Wood.  Henry (played by Culkin) appears to be the good son, but Mark (Wood) sees his true colours.  This movie scared me.  Macaulay Culkin's performance is phenomenal; a 10, no question.  Now Orphan (2009) takes a different approach.  Here you have a 9-year-old girl named Esther.  Esther is orphaned because her adopted parents were killed and the house was burned down.  Again, Esther seems sweet and innocent, but evil lurks behind.  The end of the movie shocked me, and probably a few other people too.  I was not expecting it.  Isabelle Fuhrman plays Esther, and she does a remarkable job in the role.

The movie was on TV (free) so I decided to give it a chance.  The first time I watched it, I fell asleep after 20 minutes or so.  Okay, maybe it was just late and I was tired.  The next day, my wife and I saw that it was on again and my wife (not a horror buff) was interested to see it.  As we watched the movie, we began to easily predict what would happen next and it quickly became laughable.  I know that a movie is bad when I start to get up off the couch and do chores around the house...  After predicting just about everything that was happening, I began doing chores around the house...  UNFORTUNATELY, I made it back for the big ending.  Can you say worst freaking ending EVER!!!!!  I came in just as the bad guy from Quantum of Solace was saying ""She is a Keeler (killer) Dwaaarf (midget), get out of da house!"".  My wife and I literally erupted in laughter. I commented to my wife that we just invested 90 minutes of our time that we will NEVER get back, just to find out that this chick is a freakin killer dwarf....  Now I have seen it all.  I was waiting for Chucky to come running in to help her at the end (UGH!).  Please do not see this movie!!!!  Here is a super quick summary if you really want to know:
1. They adopt a little creepy girl who dresses weird and says she is from Russia
2. All kinds of bad things start happening  (Think Omen 4...)
3. 1 parent is basically being set up and framed to be the bad guy and the other parent is the clichd moron who is complete denial of any wrong doing. Here is the type of thing to expect.
""Honey, the neighbor was found dead with an axe buried in his back!!!"".  ""Oh come on, dear he probably just backed into the wall where the axe was hanging and it accidentally got stuck in his back and killed him.  Crazy things happen like this all the time...""
4. 1 parent starts an investigation into the ""child's past"" and discovers that she is ""a keeler dwaarf"".
5. There is the typical cheesy fight scene in a dark house where the villain seems to have super strength and cannot seem to die. (You could hit her with a baseball bat, drop an anvil on her head, spray her with a flame thrower and she still keeps coming)
6. Villain goes down, the end.

3837549,4,B0021L8UPS,"When I saw the trailer for this film many months ago, I thought it looked like a rip off of The Bad Seed and The Good Son. Orphan is a well made thriller with a very creepy and amazing performance by Isabelle Fuhrman. In fact all of the kids in this film are so good they out shine the adults in every way.

The film starts slowly, but always keeps you interested. I know others have stated that the film is boring, but I really have to disagree as I was never bored in its almost two hour running length. The film has some minor flaws, but it is still a very good thriller and way above average for this type of film. If the script had a few tweaks, this could have been one of the best thrillers of all time. It has so much potential because of the performances of Isabelle and her new siblings.

The flaws....well, there are some plot holes and for a film that wants to simmer, they just don't give us a clear picture of the problems with the wife and loss of a child, sure we get the facts, but I think if you're going to slowly build a thriller like this, there is certainly room to give a detailed back story. It would have added a lot of weight later in the film. Of course the adoption is very quick and I find it hard to believe a woman with these issues would have been granted the child so quickly, but that is a minor detail and I'm sure the director was trying to move the film along. The ending is a little too Hollywood for me, but I sure didn't see the plot twist coming and that is saying something in itself!

There are so few good thriller these days that I have to be forgiving with this film. I appreciate no CGI and believe me when this film gets going this kid is creepy as.... H E L L ! This film took me completely by surprise and came very close to greatness. It is destine to become a cult classic!",1271030400,,1825,4.049861495844875
3837550,3,B0021L8UPS,"Honestly, this had more of a psychological thriller feel to it, for me.

There's some blood, a little vulgarity (and a little nuding up), but there isn't anything especially graphic OR intensely interesting about this flick. It's the same tired plot we've heard of the little orphan who gets adopted into a loving family and then all hell breaks loose. The problems are: A) It really isn't that loving of a family, in the first place, as they show. B) Some of the problems the parents are shown to have would most DEFINITELY be frowned upon by adoption agencies. None of this really matters, though, once Esther shows up. I must say, a magnificent performance by Isabelle Fuhrman. She is creepy and demented and the flick wraps itself around her. Unfortunately, some of the dialogue written for the other characters is poor, there are many plot holes, and the film is entirely too predictable. All the suspenseful moments AREN'T suspenseful! You know, the fridge door is open and when they go to close it, she should be standing there, staring? Yeah, but she isn't. It's trickery suspense and it's poorly done.

Let me explain to you how a movie is good or not. a movie has to have some type of drive and character to it where you can get your mind to stay focused and really care about the dialouge and the actors and etc...if the films boring or drags you find yourself losing interest in the characters, the script etc...then when someone ask you how was the film?? You say ""ahh it was alright, or terrible, or whatever"" becuase the movie gave you nothing to feed off of you lost focus. Orphan doesn't do that. This movie was unpredictable, Isabelle Fuhrman acting was superb to the fullest. She did a excellent job. This whole movie was just refreshing seeing so many bad movies and remakes come out lately. I actually had my eyes glued to the screen for once the entire time, and the ending just made my day. Every so often a movie comes out like this and I can't wait to own the Dvd and this was one. I think I've watched the Orphan over 50 times. I hope they never make a remake. If you don't own this get it. I'm a movie critic, and I've seen 100's of movies old and new, so it takes a lot to really make me watch it more then once, or reccomend it to someone else......but that's just my opinion...I'd give it 10 stars if they had 10 stars to give",1269734400,3,1394,4.166666666666667

The Blu-ray Disc comes with some deleted scenes and an alternate ending which is creepier than the original ending.

3837599,4,B0021L8UPS,"Evil kid movies are inherently creepy. Kids are supposed to be victims in movies not the other way around, so when you do see it it makes your skin crawl. This is a good entry into the genre.

A couple adopts a girl from an orphanage. Things seem to be OK in the beginning but deteriorate at a rapid pace.

The strength here is in the way the story unfolds. We meet a seemingly happy, loving couple, but as things progress we see their dark sides and weaknesses. The viewer gets glimpses of infidelity, alcoholism, mental instability, et al. Same with their adopted girl. Certain flags pop up right away, but they get larger and larger with each passing scene.

There are weaknesses as well. I like Peter Skarsgaard, but he's weak here and I can't say it's in the script. He just isn't all there. Vera Farmiga, on the other hand, does a great job. Her realization of what is happening and the subsequent trying to impart it to those around her is an uphill battle, particularly given her less than stable past. But she really sinks her teeth into it and displays the whole ""deep love of a mother"" thing with resounding aplomb.

The other major weakness is the climax/ending. The storyline is laid out very well until then. And outside of the really creepy transformation of the orphan, it's like the writer(s) got stupid all of the sudden and put this unbelievably heavy handed machine into motion. I won't spoil things here but this part of the movie needed to be much smarter and way more clever. It's bad to the point of nearly negating all the cool stuff that came before. Maybe the producers listened too closely to their test audiences.

This is a generally good movie with good work in front of and behind the camera. Ending not withstanding, it's well worth the viewer's time investment.",1267747200,,1795,4.579439252336448

When Kate (Farmiga) loses her third child during birth, it sends her marriage into a nose dive and drives her to therapy. She has a great husband - John (Sarsgaard) - two lovely kids, and a beautiful house, but the loss has left a void that needs to be filled. Kate and John decide that the best way to do this is to adopt a child. They visit the local Orphanage and are almost instantly drawn to a young girl called Esther (Fuhrman). Esther is from Russia, she is polite and intelligent, and with an old fashioned dress sense and way about her that sets her apart from the other children. Three weeks after their visit to the Orphanage, Kate and John return to collect Esther and take her back home to become part of the family; and that's when things really take a turn for the worse, as they realise that Esther's sweet little eccentricity's are the least of their worries.

The cast are all excellent, especially the increasingly desperate Farmiga, but the movie would not be half as effective without the ice cold turn from Fuhrman. Furhrman creates one of the very best screen villains of recent years, cold, calculating and utterly terrifying. After the slow burn of the first two thirds, Collet-Sera pulls out all the stops and goes for broke in the fantastic climax, things do veer a little close to the suspense flick formula, but by the time the credits are rolling you'll just be glad it's all over...and I mean that in a good way.",1267488000,6,1463,4.537878787878788

I'm glad there are executives in in L.A. who are willing to try something and absolutely fail at their efforts. With so many hands involved in movies these days, there's less and less of a chance for films like this to be made - films so bad that every turn creates a camp experience that truly wows.

3837636,4,B0021L8UPS,"Sigh. I tell you people that Seers usually bend over backwards in order to please the ladies in our lives. Case in point: Sondra the Seerest (Metamorpho's long time main squeeze) and I were relaxing at my castle, having crackers, cheese and wine, when all of a sudden she said, ""You know what Metamorpho? We really should consider adopting a child, not a baby mind you, but one a little older who will add spice and happiness to the castle."" To be perfectly frank people, I was taken aback at the suggestion. Certainly I possess enough spice for the whole world, but, despite my hurt small (!) ego, I gave in, always willing to please to avoid total aggravation.

So Sondra and Seer sauntered (yes, I am alliterate) down to the local orphange to see if there were any good prospects. Sister Abagail greeted us and in the process I met Esther. She was sitting all alone by herself creating pictures. I was astounded that they were so good for such a young child. And people, I know good art. I did give Picasso lessons after all. Soon Sondra joined us and she was equally as impressed. Esther was remarkable. Creative, well-mannered, attentive, respectful, intelligent and, well, everything every child should be in this mad, a go-go crazy world we all know. At that point I should have been suspicious, however I wasn't (Seers do have lapses you know. One of the very few faults they have I might add). So, it was decided that Sondra and I would go home to think about it and get back to Sister Abigail the next day.

Unfortunately (or fortunately) we missed our chance. Sister Abigail called us the next day to tell us that a couple, Kate and John Coleman, decided they wanted her and papers were being drawn up at that very moment. I wasn't too disappointed, but, to play it safe, I told Sondra after sharing 2 bottles of Pinot Grichio. It went better than expected. She only ripped apart 2 of the 50 Rembrandt originals I had hanging in the castle. I caught her on a good day I suppose.

Anyway, that brings us to the story of the Colemans. It seems Kate lost a child in pregnancy and needed a child to make her life complete. They already had two children, a small deaf daughter Max, and a scrappy 7 year old boy Daniel. Why anyone would want another child in this economy is a mystery. Then again, the Coleman's had a modern day castle of their own. So John must be doing very well indeed.

It must be stated here that Esther was very weird, and certainly not accepted too well by the children. Daniel didn't like her right off the bat. And who ever said children aren't smarter than adults? But, she was weird people. First off, she wore ridiculous dresses to school, the kids taunted her, and plus she had this Russian accent that took getting used to. Oh yes, I almost forgot, Esther had this temper which would make her scream and bash in bathroom walls. Attention getting for sure, but at home she would be a polite young thing.

Now, all young couples have their problems. Kate and John were no different, but they had moved beyond the issues of alcoholism and infidelity before Esther arrived. However, we learn that Esther is a master at manipulation and using people's psychological weaknesses to her advantage. So, she became a virtual wedge between the family and exploited their fears and insecurities against each other.
Not only that, but strange things were starting to happen. Unfortunate things. Her behaviour started to concern Kate a lot, but John felt that Kate was out on an imagination limb. Kate was in contact with Sister Abagail and when Sister Abigail came for a visit, Mother Superior not only jumped the gun, but jumped the icy curb as well.

More and more Kate suspected something wrong with Esther and did reserach over the internet to find out what. Esther, upon psychological investigation,was found to be totally normal and Kate was perceived as a paranoid nut case. So much for experts. However, John perceived the same as the psychologist and saw Esther as a victimized and unfairly treated child, that is, until...

Now people, I have given you part of the tasty tidbits here, but not all of them. There is a MAJOR twist here, but I'm not going to tell you. Why? Because I can see the headlines on all the tabloids now. RENOWNED SEER GIVES REVIEW SPOILERS AWAY!!!
My fine reputation will suffer and you'll never read my incisive, astute reviews ever again. Reputation is ALL to me (with money a close second). Thus, you will have to see this for yourself. I believe it to be an above-average thriller, and one that, although it takes some while to evolve, will leave you with a feeling as sharp as an icicle - snow pun intended.

At first, I thought this movie would be lame. I was most surprised. Although formulaic at times, it was interesting to see the plot unravel. It's definitely worth seeing, especially if you are a suspense-horror-puzzle junkie. With Esther, it's hard to best her, and she proves this time and time again. Somewhat decent story, somewhat decent wondering what's next, but not a classic in the general sense. You know what Esther's about early on. It's waiting for everyone else to catch up to you which is the enjoyment of this movie.

After viewing this, Sondra the Seerest has given up the idea of adoption. Good. More time to devote to me! I give it 4 stars, an interesting ride. And, speaking of that, no young ones invited to this. Nothing totally graphic, but enough adult content to keep young eyes away. Besides, do you really want them to grow up like Esther?

So many Hollywood movies have crappy ratings here. And some of them definitely deserve them.

But this movie was goooood.

Twisted. Evil. Exciting. Funny. Kept you on the edge at times.

It's also suspenseful.

I can't really say much without giving the whole movie away but I'll just say it's about an orphan girl who gets adopted by a decent, if slightly damaged family. Typical really. She's very smart and seemingly well-mannered. But soon enough they find out she has some issues. And she does some things.

Okay, so an artsy alcoholic wife (Vera Farmiga)and painfully naive, emasculated husband (Peter Sarsgaard) decide to adopt a child after already having two.  One is a deaf little girl.  The other is a boy who likes to shoot paintballs at pigeons.  Don't they have their hands full already?

Another great actress, CCH Pounder, does her best to redeem this mess as a Catholic nun who without apparently knowing much about a girl named Esther who has been in her orphanage for four or five years decides to give her to the family.  Voila.  The stage is set for an absurd series of events so ridiculous and beyond belief that Roger Corman might have blushed.

How the hell could two people with functioning cerebellums not know that a 9 year old who can paint detailed pictures a la Matisse and NEVER TAKES OFF HER VICTORIAN STYLE MINIATURE SACHE is not a nine year old girl?

The gullability of the parents is simply amusing.  It stops being frustrating and starts to get drop dead hilarious.  Maybe Esther learned to play Tchaikovsky when she was 2.  Maybe Esther didn't throw the kid off the playground slide and break his arm even though they had a problem the day before.  Maybe she didn't kill the nun with a hammer even though she disappeared right before leaving their home.  Maybe she didn't try to set the little boy on fire and then run right into the hospital room to finish the job even though the doctor on call noticed the IV was missing and she just left to get a soda.  Even the last line, ""I'm not your Mommy, b*tch!"" was plagiarized from another terrible horror movie: The Ring 2.

3837750,3,B0021L8UPS,"Vera Farmiga, Peter Sarsgaard, and CCH Pounder give excellent performances, but it's the kiddies who steal the show in ""Orphan.""

Farmiga and Sarsgaard star as Kate and John Coleman, a successful and loving (or so it seems at first) couple with two children and the desire to adopt another when Kate's third child is stillborn.  They believe that they've found the perfect child in Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman), a nine-year-old Russian orphan who is sugary sweet, highly intelligent, and very artistic.

Once Esther arrives at the Coleman home, she is immediately met with resistance by the Coleman's son, Daniel (Jimmy Bennett), and takes their deaf daughter, Max (Aryana Engineer) under her protective wing.  She is also teased at school for her dresses and the Bible she carries with her.

Slowly the viewer sees sweet Esther turn into a very dark and sinister little girl.  Not only does she seek out revenge on those who pick at her, but she begins to manipulate Max and force her to help out with her dirty work.

Esther also opens old wounds from Kate and John's past and drives a wedge between them.  Kate becomes suspicious of Esther and seeks out more information on her newly adopted daughter.  The head mistress of the orphanage, Sister Abigail (CCH Pounder), tries to help Kate and becomes a target for Esther as well.

As Esther's dark past is revealed, her actions become more wicked and, in some cases, fatal.  It is at this point that the film begins to rely on well-worn cliches that have been trod out in a number of other films about evil children, particularly ""The Good Son"" and ""The Omen.""

Naturally there is a twist thrown in near the film's climax in order to give a motive to Esther's madness, and while it is rather sickening, it's not that big of a surprise.

Overall, the film isn't that bad.  However, clocking in at a very slow moving 120-plus minutes makes for a somewhat boring experience.  I'm assuming that director Jaume Collet-Serra was trying to build suspense by drawing out the film, but it makes for a lackluster thriller in the end.  Even the climactic battle near the end of the film is drawn out and rather unbelievable.  It's almost as if the film is attempting to be a psychological thriller and a slasher flick at the same time.

Again, the film really isn't that bad, just too long and a bit boring at times.  The children all shine in their roles, particularly little Aryana Engineer, whom I believe does an excellent job as Max.  Her performance is overshadowed somewhat by Fuhrman's turn as Esther, but she still shines on her own.

So is this film worthy of purchase?  If you enjoy psychological thrillers involving young children then, yes, I say go out and buy it.  However, I do recommend to everyone else that you rent this film first.  It's good, but I have no plans to add it to my permanent collection any time soon.",1260230400,16,2873,4.688622754491018

I just finished watching Orphan and I tell you what, I half expect to see that ""child's"" evil face staring at me from the top of the stairs.  Wow, what a job Isabelle Fuhrman did as the ""child"".  I agree her performance is oscar worthy.

Ok, so the pace was slow (especially at first!) but this is a psychological suspense thriller and watching this actress portray a child that was one side articulate, intelligent, and caring and the other side pure sadistic, manipulative, and violent evil was fascinating.  Also, the movie was meant to be slow but with the increasing notion of impending doom and terror coming at the climax, which is what happened.  For those who favor movies with a lot of action and gore and constant slam bang terror, this isn't the movie for you.

I perhaps though feel a bit idiotic as it seems many saw coming the twist at the end coming.  I didn't and I like it when a movie gives me a surprise.  That's an instant star and this one didn't dissapoint.  I did though think wow when the evil Esther threatened her sibling in a very concise, absolutely no doubt what was on her mind, expressed evil thought. It did make me stop for a moment and wonder... Then I let it go and the twist came and it was a big OKAY, I GET IT!!

The actors in this movie were all great, even the naive as I'll get out father/husband portrayed convincingly by Peter Sarsgaard.  If anyone was going to get it, I could see it coming for him in the end.  Yikes, wake up man!  It was wrenching seeing no one believing the mother character played by Vera Farmiga.  That role must have been draining for her-the anguish is so well executed.  In the end though, atleast in this case, mother knows best and don't mess with the children! The child actors and CCH Pounder also were great.

I am not a horror movie fan but something about this film intrigued me...""there's something wrong with Esther""...that made me get up and go see it in the theaters.  I absolutely loved this film.  I thought each of the actors played their role perfectly in this film, particularly our leading star whose name I cannot recall as I'm writing this.  Vera Farmiga also does a particularly fine job and I wish she was in more leading roles, herself as I think she's quite talented.  This particular DVD comes with footage of an alternate ending which I somewhat liked better than that shown in the final cut, along with some deleted scenes which I suppose are worth watching once.

When violent events began taking place that are connected to Esther, the parents began to suspect that there is more to the little girl than appears.

  Fuhrman definitely was the right choice for the role of Esther; she has an attractive face and her youth doesn't strain her acting abilities which were very convincing. I won't lie though; the movie was very grisly, and even I had to turn away from the screen a few times. Even the twist ending really shocked me, and I'm not easily shocked.

3837782,2,B0021L8UPS,"This is another variant of ""The Bad Seed"", which was a far better film. The problem here can be laid on the Director. He fails to build any suspense whatsoever. Every attack is telegraphed far in advance, and they are rushed. So any suspense is nullified in favor of jumping right into the attack. The editing is another problem. Jump cuts make it difficult at times to really see what's going on.

The main problem with this film is that it is so predictable. Even the ""twist ending"" is easy to see coming. Anyone who has ever seen ""The Bad Seed"", ""The Good Son"" or ""The Omen, can see where this film is heading. There are very few surprises. The girl, played by Isabelle Fuhrman, is supposed to be from Russia, but has a Scottish accent. Where did that come from?

I also had a big problem with the Standard DVD itself. It begins with a commercial for some soft drink, then goes on to subject you to a public service announcement about adoption, and a string (a long string) of previews. This wouldn't be so bad if you could access the main menu or ""skip"" through them. However, played on my Blu-Ray player, I was unable to do so. By the time I finally got to the main menu, I was very frustrated. This may not be a problem on a standard DVD Player or with the blu-Ray version.

If you haven't seen any of the above mentioned films, you may enjoy this. However, I found this to be mostly a cliche ridden, pale imitation of those films.",1258070400,3,1437,4.33457249070632

The ""Russian"" orphan character is just plain stupid. Its predictable. The movie is not scarey.  The twist at the end is so dumb I started laughing.  The girl who played this character tried to look mean, but just came off as pathetic. A little girl walking into an intensive care unit and doing what she did, undetected...c'mon.

STARRING: Vera Farmiga, Peter Sarsgaard, Isabelle Fuhrman, Jimmy Bennett, Aryana Engineer and CCH Pounder

WRITTEN BY: David Johnson and Alex Mace

DIRECTED BY: Jaume Collette-Serra

Rated: R
Genre: Horror / Thriller
Release Date: 24 July 2009

I'd be lying if I said that Orphan didn't have all the little moments you have seen a thousand times in horror flicks and thrillers. You know the ones I mean; the loud noises, the fast camera jerks and the annoying false-alarm-scares. It has them all. So why did I give it such a high rating you might ask?

Because although it has all of those little tidbits that feel like fillers and has a premise that's been recycled countless times, it has much more than any of the films you are thinking of. It makes movies like The Omen and Rosemary's Baby look like Disney films in comparison. Orphan is beyond disturbing.

We feel like a silent guest in the home of Kate (Vera Farmiga) and John (Peter Sarsgaard) Coleman. We feel their love for one another and the love for their children, Max and Daniel but we also sense dark secrets and an essence of mistrust as well. The family is holding it together but there have been some issues, for sure.

Kate is a recovering alcoholic and has miss-carried their third child in a very late stage of pregnancy. She had a name picked out and everything. She even dedicated a patch of rare flowers that she grows indoors to the unborn child.

This is obviously why things are a bit off with the family, so she and John agree to look into adopting. They've done a pretty decent job raising the two kids they already have, so it's no wonder they are fond of nine-year-old Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman) when they meet her at an orphanage. It's almost hard to believe she can be just nine. She is a very talented artist, plays the piano effortlessly and insists on dressing elegantly all the time. Despite all of this, she is without a doubt creepy.

As you may have guessed, at first everything is great. She gets along with the other kids, the parents love and adore her and all is well. Then things start happening. There is a close call here and a questioning concern there and then things get nasty.

What sets Orphan apart from similar films of its genre, is that things don't just get bad, they get really, really bad. This kid is one disturbed little individual.

Perhaps what made kids scary in movies in the past, was that they were just kids doing bad things. What makes Esther so terrifying is that she acts like an adult when she does them. She's too mature and smart for her own good and that's more horrifying.

At times it's almost like she is more aware of things than the parents. I think another factor that works is the way she dresses. They could have very easily tried to make her look eerie with dark clothes and Goth makeup and have her not say anything. Instead they chose to dress her up like a little church girl, complete with ribbons in her hair and dress shoes and they gave her a huge vocabulary and a grown up sense to know things that no child should know.

Another element it has that most horror films lack, is good acting. Every character is portrayed so well, it's insane.

Vera Farmiga makes us feel her pain in every scene. She is an extraordinary actress and is severely underrated. It was nice to finally see her in a lead role.

Peter Sarsgaard may very well be one of the best actors out there. I have seen several of his films and he has so much diversity between his characters. Here he plays denial that anything is wrong with Esther to a T and his chemistry with Farmiga is always believable.

Even the other two child actors who play Max, (Aryana Engineer) and Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) did amazing jobs. They both are so convincing that they're horribly scared, you can't help but wonder if they will need therapy after making this movie.

The director, (Jaume Collette-Serra) clearly has a knack for horror films, a previous film being 2005's House of Wax, which was also done very well. He keeps you on the edge of your seat and rips amazing performances out of all the actors.

The third act of the film was by far the most interesting. All bets are off for predicting anything that will happen. I was shocked repeatedly and amazed by the ending. This was easily the most original ending I have seen in any film since The Sixth Sense.

It's good to see that there can still be some decent horror films made. And it's reassuring as an avid horror fan, to know that good solid actors like Farmiga and Sarsgaard are interested in the material and that talented directors like Collette- Serra are behind the reins. Even mainstream icons like Michael Bay, Peter Jackson, Sam Raimi, and Martin Scorsese have been conjuring up new horror films.

It will probably take several years, if ever, for anyone to see Isabelle Fuhrman as not creepy. She does for scary little kids what Anthony Hopkins did for deranged serial killers. I wonder how this role has affected her because she conveys such evil in her performance, that you are impressed and repulsed simultaneously. And I also wonder if her parents will have any trouble finding a babysitter after this.",1257724800,,5179,4.5652642934196335
3837829,4,B0021L8UPS,Where to begin?  This is in some ways your standard late 20th Century horror flick but it was also refreshing to see some creativity here in a very sick and scary twist of plot.  Like The Excorcist (though not as terrifying) you have a young female in a leading role acting inappropriately on many levels and in some way that evokes a certain level of terror and uncertainty with the viewer.  That said while this does make the film creepy I have to question the affect on the young actress. You'll know what I mean after watching this.  But that aside this is entertaining and it is scary.  The 4 star average rating here is dead on.  Just do not watch this if you are about to adopt or work for Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.,1257638400,2,726,4.301470588235294
3837830,4,B0021L8UPS,"The poster and trailers make Orphan look like a horror movie, but it's not. I won't spoil the surprise except to say it's a suspense/thriller. As such it's a pretty good way to spend movie night if you don't expect too much or think too hard. Twist endings are de rigueur for the horror/suspense genre, with some directors thinking the more ludicrous and outlandish, the better. Thankfully, Orphan doesn't insult the audience's intelligence with a cheap surprise ending just for the sake of twist endings (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Village/dp/B00064LJVE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Village</a>). All the characters in here act naturally and do things that are logical for who they are, unlike some movies where the director shows characters doing things to intentionally mislead the audience or other red herrings, even when they are alone, like in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wild-Things/dp/B0001GF2D8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wild Things</a>. The revelation at the end is credible and logical, though it shouldn't be a big shock unless you've totally switched off your brain before pushing the play button. The ending does not require a huge suspension of disbelief, and while you may not have guessed it, it won't leave you thinking you've been conned. I commend director Jaume Collet-Serra for taking us on a little side road along this well-traveled path (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Child-s-Play/dp/079284131X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Child's Play</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Omen-Blu-ray/dp/B000ICLRH0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Omen [Blu-ray</a>],&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bad-Seed/dp/B00027JYNK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bad Seed</a>).

The film is mostly devoid of the usual cheap tricks that characterize horror/thriller films, like sudden loud music when a door opens, things popping out, or the slow, closely-framed behind the shoulder shot that suddenly cuts to a scary person behind the victim or a face in the mirror (accompanied by loud music). ""There's something wrong with Esther"", as the tagline says, and I didn't find any spots where I jumped in my seat. The Orphan does not produce an intense feeling of tension or fear, and instead, settles for a slow, hovering mood of creepiness before leading to the explosive final confrontation.

Of note are Isabelle Fuhrman (Esther), 12, and Aryana Engineer, 8, who plays Max the hearing impaired and mute little sister (she is hearing impaired in real life). Fuhrman's fake Russian accent is distracting at times, but her acting abilities are apparent. Sure, her orphan character is a cliche, but Furhman's performance is perfectly creepy and cold. While not ground-breaking, the Orphan is a worthwhile flick to enjoy on a dark evening.",1257638400,4,2967,6.452261306532663
3837831,5,B0021L8UPS,"In this fine suspense/psychological horror film, an affluent couple in Connecticut decides to adopt a new child (she already has two children, one deaf, and has just lose her third in a miscarriage) and settles in an orphanage for a seemingly charming and very precocious nine year old Russian girl named Esther. Soon, though, the new member of the family shows a maturity well beyond her years and starts making terrible mischief with an escalating maliciousness that knows no boundaries, manipulating every member of the family to turn against each other and soon involving herself in real (as opposed to merely psychological) violence. Her adopted mother starts to suspect a terrible secret lies behind her. Eventually, things will escalate to murder. Well filmed (though there are too many false suspense moments) and especially well scripted, this movie has a final twist that I will not discuss here as not to spoil it to future viewers, but let me say that it is very nifty, it makes a lot of sense of what we just see before and puts this movie well above other run of the mill demon child stories. 12 year old's Isabelle Fuhmann performance as Esther is just mind blowing. Vera Farmiga, as the troubled mother seeing with impotence how this girl from hell is breaking her family is also fine.",1257552000,3,1301,4.838565022421525
3837832,5,B0021L8UPS,"When I saw the first trailer for this movie it reminded me of The Good Son, which was an excellent movie. There is just something about demented children that creeps the heck out of me. I went into this movie with a little reservation expecting it to be a poor entry into the psycho-kid genre, but thankfully I was wrong.  This movie exceeded my expectations in every way and gave me hope that they can actually make a great thriller with a little bit horror mixed in. My only beef with the movie is the first twenty to thirty minutes which could have easily been condensed, but once Isabelle Fuhrman's Esther is introduced the rollercoaster begins and keeps you enthralled and sweaty-palmed all the way to the end. Isabelle Fuhrman came way out of left field with her performance as Esther. Her Russian accent is top notch (I actually thought she was Russian in real life). Fuhrman is extremely convincing as she switches personas from the kind, sweet Esther and the evil, sadistic Esther. She plays it well, almost too well. I haven't seen her in anything else, but she seems more experienced that all of the child actors out there.

The TWIST at the end will leave you speechless. Buy it. Rent it. Just see it any way you can. You really won't be disappointed unless you have REALLY high expectations. If nothing else simpy see it for Isabelle Fuhrman's performance.",1257552000,8,1369,4.652892561983471
3837833,5,B0021L8UPS,"This was a very creepy, well-done movie. The characters were very convincing and the concept was quite clever. Thoroughly entertaining.",1257552000,,135,5.8
3837884,3,B0021L8UPS,"Yep, the father in this film really has the blinders on.  He does not want to see what is right in front of him.  He takes the orphan's side over that of his wife and kids.  Also, there is a weird scene with him and Esther on the couch when he's been drinking wine but seems to be drugged.  And I find it hard to believe that the little sister would have the physical strength to help lug a body around, or even to knock Esther down.  Also, why didn't the orphanage know more info about where Esther came from in the first place? Big plot hole.

However, there is a real, creepy factor at work in the film. Esther is just too advanced, too good to be true, highly manipulative, and well played by the young actor.  Nice locations too, and CCH Pounder is always good in just about any role she takes on.

It's worth a rental, if not a purchase.",1257465600,,843,4.128834355828221
3837885,5,B0021L8UPS,"Many people find that describing the movie to give a movie review is the way to go. Usually, I refrain, but on this occasion, I will include the plot. A husband and wife, already with two children of their own (one who is deaf) lose their third child during labor. They resort to adopting an orphan--a 9-year-old, seemingly intelligent and kind-hearted, little Russian girl. Much to their dismay, what seems to be the perfect adoption turns into anything but. The movie moves at a slow but determined pace for the first 45 minutes or so, but then the rockin' starts to rollin' as the story spirals into a cacophony of strangeness accompanied with mountains of vindictive mayhem. Many reviews I have read had a problem with the twist; I thought it to be VERY COOL, and something that could become reality in the realm of possibility, which makes it all the more founded, thus being all the more horrific. Just before the twist; however, something happened that made me think, ""Okay, here we go...right back into the silly Hollywood horror film crap that has been bombarding us throughout the beginning of the new century."" But when the twist hits and everything finally makes sense, I was thankfully pulled from that train of thought and taken back into a bizarre and wonderful story. Dark Castle Entertainment has done a LOT of movies that I simply love (Gothika, Ghost Ship, and Thirteen Ghosts.) This one will have to go into that group of five-star movies. Don't miss it!

3837889,5,B0021L8UPS,"I saw this movie the night before Halloween and realized what an impact it had one me when I saw the kids in costumes on Halloween night. They key to really enjoying this movie is not knowing ahead of time what the twist is. How many movies have their been about the demon child? Well, this takes it a step further. Isabelle Fuhrman is truly remarkable as the 9 year old Russian child who is adopted by a well to do couple suffering from the stillbirth of their third child. Esther is the ""older"" child adopted to complete the family. She starts out as the dream child until she begins terrorizing her new brother and sister. I can't give away too much more but if you like suspense, ORPHAN is a great movie. It shows how a good story and a good cast is more important than pricey special effects.
I had to do some research and found out Fuhrman was only 10 when this movie was filmed. Here is a fine young actress with a bright future.",1257120000,3,936,4.264044943820225
3837890,4,B0021L8UPS,"ORPHAN could be one of the biggest surprises of the year. Although, you may second guess yourself if you're planning on adopting a little Russian girl that speaks really good english and plays a really good tchaikovsky.

Everybody does a tremenous job of delivering high-calibur performances including Vera Farmiga who gives a look into her soul as the movie plays out. At first, she's a woman who is desperate to ease the torment of losing her last child and eventually a woman who has to face the reality that the Orphan she thought would ease her pain becomes more and more of a mystery.

Yet, it's hard to believe, as good as Farmiga was, that she could be overshadowed. Isabelle Furhman plays ESTHER, the orphan in question. She is gifted with emotions and timing that reminded me of Kirsten Dunst in INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE, and she's only twelve. It is always risky to cast children in such important roles, but when you find a good one like this, it certainly pays off.

I would also like to acknowledge the even younger child actor, Aryana Engineer, who plays a deaf child that has to get a lot of emotions across without a word. Which is an even tougher challenge and she was a master. Maybe it's because she's used to getting emotions across with her eyes and face, because she is actually deaf in real life too.

My only complaint about ORPHAN was that many times during the movie, the director went for the cheap empty thrill of cranking the music when somebody closes a fridge door or looks out a window to see nothing. Something that didn't need to happen in Orphan. The emotions that were trying to be achieved were don't perfectly by the actors and the cheap thrills stuff cheapened the movie.",1257120000,2,1711,4.6

3837892,2,B0021L8UPS,"The Orphan is not a fast paced film, and the acting is not the best.  The real problem is that adoption procedure is not followed. The husband is to quick not to believe his wife when she says there is a problem (cliche).  When one child is threatened and terrified, he says nothing to his parents and continues to sleep under the same roof as the psycho.  Any child would talk rather than live with someone who puts a razor to his or her throat.  There are other holes as well.  It seems that wine sends people on an LSD trip in this movie.  The director did not research adoption or child psychology to make this film.  The movie is not believable. The viewer must look past all of the holes and simply be satisfied with a surprise ending (that really is not worth the price of this movie). The payoff does not save the film.

We had it figured out about half way through at least to a point; unfortunately that was the most entertaining part of the movie.
It was very predictable and in some cases just lazy in its attempt in being cunning, the Dad was a complete moron, the psychologist needed to be killed, why didn't anyone kill her?
This movie could have been so much better if they would have just spent a little more time making the orphan a bit more believable in her manipulations. I mean who wouldn't guess that as soon as the mother told her Mother in-law to make sure Isabelle stays put, the Mother in-law gives her a dollar for a soda around the corner.
If you liked the (Good son, bad seed) and so on, this will not disappoint and Isabelle Fuhrman plays the part very well. The twist is good, but the finish is very predictable...",1256860800,2,986,4.335135135135135
3837917,3,B0021L8UPS,"You just can't take ""Orphan"" too seriously. From the lengthy (and ""bloody"") opening sequence to the jaw-dropping finale, the story of this ""bad seed"" horror film directed Jaume Collet-Serra (remake version of ""House of Wax"") remains preposterous. That doesn't mean ""Orphan"" is not worth watching, however. The film is fairly entertaining as long as you can ignore the obvious plot holes, graphic violence and, well, the ""twist"" that will leave most viewers speechless.

Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman) is a 9-year-old orphaned Russian girl. Sociable and charming, Esther is adopted by John Coleman (Peter Sarsgaard) and his wife Kate Coleman (Vera Farmiga) who has lost her baby recently. At first everything goes well and John and Kate are both very happy until one day Kate starts to feel that something is not quite right about Esther, a girl with a serene smile.

""Orphan"" is largely well-acted (Isabelle Fuhrman as enigmatic Esther is quite impressive), but it takes too much time for the film to get things moving. Also, several episodes make the characters look very stupid - if someone claims that his child, severely wounded, is ""pushed"" by my child, I would take the matter much seriously than the Colemans.

But what is most disappointing is that Jaume Collet-Serra has missed so many chances to make the film a better thriller. There is a scene where Esther shows her sexual side, but that aspect of the storyline is not fully explored. John and Kate Coleman have two children, 12-year-old Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) and very adorable Max (Aryana Engineer), but their presence in the story as unprotected family member doesn't really enhance the suspense. Maybe I am wrong, but somehow the Spanish-born director Jaume Collet-Serra is forced to pull punches where he knows he shouldn't.",1256774400,3,1787,5.113013698630137

3837923,4,B0021L8UPS,"I saw this film when it opened on July 24, 2009. Mixed reviews from fans and critics were the usual flair upon its release, but something struck me about this movie. The film went on to gross $37 million at the box-office despite the thrashing it took from critics, but everyone couldn't help but notice the Oscar-nomination worthy performance of its 12-year-old star Isabelle Fuhrman. I just viewed the film on DVD for the first time since its theaterical run and I'm still seeing just how riveting and engaging this movie really is.

""Orphan"" is NOT a horror film. It's more along the lines of a SUSPENSE THRILLER. When I think of horror films, I think of sex-crazed teenagers being sliced up one-by-one by a machete-wielding maniac (Jason Voorhies, Freddy Krueger, Micheal Myers, etc.). The only real weapons wielded here is just a hammer, a knife, and a .38-caliber pistol. You think scary when it comes to horror films and ""Orphan"" isn't scary. Has some frightful moments, yes, but scary? Wishful thinking!

Set in the winter-bound parts of Conneticut & Canada, the story centers on the Coleman family: Kate (Vera Farmiga), a Yale University music teacher recovering from alcoholism and bouts of depression after having a stillborn from her third pregnancy; John (Peter Sarsgaard), an architech whose nice guy persona overshadows his increasing issues with Kate that led to past affairs; Max (Aryana Engineer), their deaf 5-year-old daughter who communicates through sign language and their oldest son Daniel (Jimmy Bennett), who feels bitterly neglected & increasingly isolated from his parents. As a way of coping with the loss of their would-be 2nd daughter, Jessica, and to amend their existence as a family, Kate & John make a fateful decision to adopt a young girl at the local orphanage.

It is here where they meet Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman), a sweet-looking 9-year-old Russian girl harboring some deep-seeded issues of her own despite her angelic smile and sympathetic mannerisms. Upon arriving home with new stepdaughter in tow, a series of events unravel to make everyone question the background and sincerity of this little girl. Daniel dislikes her immediately, Max forms an unhealthy bond with her new stepsister, Kate begins to seek out further information about Esther's background, & John just plays Devil's Advocate with all that occurs involving Esther. What's wrong with Esther? Is it true that behind the smile of this little angel beats the heart of a psycho killer?

The answer, and the big secret about who she really is, lies within the confines of this 123-minute thriller. I agree with everyone here that it moves at a near-torturous snail's pace, that being the film's major fatal flaw. But the story itself is so entralling and engaging, you can't help but to excuse that misfire. Fuhrman's performance alone keeps you involved in the twists and turns entrenched here. Only a young, superbly talented actress like Fuhrman was able to pull off a psychological undertaking of switching from sympathetic manipulator to disturbed sadist and it's why I feel she should've gotten an Oscar nod. But due to the overall dislike of the film itself from most critics and for her young age, she didn't get anywhere near sniffing distance of the balloting.

Nonetheless, I was so inspired by this film and became such a fan that I created my own 20-song, hard-rock CD Mix (liner notes & all) of songs inspired by the movie (my own psuedo-soundtrack, if you will, but John Ottman's score was cool). Seemingly destined to go down as a cult favorite, if not a classic, ""Orphan"" was a solid & enjoyable thrill ride that's essentially ""The Hand That Rocks The Cradle"", ""The Good Son"", ""The Crush"", and a more mean-spirited version of ""Problem Child"" all rolled into one. That's why this movie isn't a horror despite being classified as one. This film has a depth, substance, and intuitiveness to it that Jason, Micheal, & Freddy couldn't touch with a bloddy axe. Just take sweet, little Esther home and let her hold you, thrill you, kiss you, .... kill you!!! Can someone out there please say ""CULT CLASSIC""? - DEM -",1256688000,68,4131,4.963872832369942

3837965,4,B0021L8UPS,"Obviously a very split crowd out there regarding the content of this film and the messy arguments it has created. Aside from all of that, they made an interesting little twist of a film that moves along at a painfully slow pace. The Blu quality is great in a variety of ways, but they really sunk this with the supplements.

The picture quality is excellent throughout, and there are plenty of chances for mistakes with the snow sequences, dark clothing, naturally lit interior spaces and night footage. Plenty of contrast testings so if you have a slow refresh rate display this BD might not be a good investment for you. The sound is TrueHD and gets used once or twice in creating a reference (mainly the basketball against the wall while she is playing the piano). The best color test was right at the get-go with that WB symbol illuminating with the fluorescent pigments against the black. The paint ball/snow scene with the bird is the only other palette mix that shows much.

The supplements are a farce, including:
* A Bad Seeds and Evil Children documentary. Lasts less than 15 minutes and shows the cast talking about ""Notable Child Psychopaths in Movie History"". If you are looking for insight into the filmmaking for this movie skip it.
* Deleted scenes. 4 minutes of low-def forgettable short clips. The ""Chilling Alternate Ending"" (lasts 20 seconds) has no context as to how it could have gotten to that point, so you have to assume. Obviously different than the ""happy"" ending of who lives and dies - but there needed to be some extra help as to how they came up with that.
* BD Live extras. I did the WB registration (took 5 minutes, including logging into my email and entering the sent code) and was rewarded with nothing extra for the film - (maybe they have not put anything on there yet).
* WB Insider Rewards. BD case has a code for entering number(s) - one of five needed films to get a sixth one free.

The Blu has some decent reference points (not a ton overall) on what has become a very mixed popularity film, and the supplements - they are not a selling point at all. Four for the film and quality, zero for the extras.",1256428800,3,2146,4.525773195876289

I have mixed feelings about ""Orphan.""  On the one hand, it meanders along at such a pedestrian pace in the beginning that I experienced a strong urge to leave the theater when I saw it.  On the other hand, I enjoyed the twist ending.  It's an  eye-opener.  But the payoff destination is not quite worth the jejune journey getting there.  In other words, I liked ""Orphan"" with strong reservations.

A thriller needs to move along at a certain brisk pace, but this movie waited far too long to switch into high gear for it to generate many thrills before the final act.

3837968,1,B0021L8UPS,"The only reason I watched this was people said it had a crazy twist ending, on the contrary, it was adequate at best and all I kept doing throughout the movie was trying to guess what it was.
Could it be that Esther was really the baby from the first scene - that was my first guess.
Could it be that the mother wakes up in the insane asylum - too easy.
Could it be that Esther was a schizophrenic part of the mother due to her drinking and the fact that she was artistic as well (like the mother) - sadly no.
Could it be that Esther was the reincarnate angel of Jessica sent down to smite the sinners - that would be cool, but no.
It's sad that there are serious issues in this film that don't really get discussed (developed), the death of Jessica, the fact that mom has a serious drinking issue but it's OK for the dad to down a whole bottle of wine and (almost) sleep with his daughter*
This movie had very little character development if any at all. Seriously I felt this film was all over the place. Some people got hurt of killed and no one shows any real emotion to it whatsoever.
Besides the Dad part right before the end... that was pretty chilling in my opinion, that was the only positive this movie had, that's sad.",1256342400,6,1228,4.185654008438819

Yes, it has some cliche scenes, but to compare it to Omen, and the Good Son-as I did originally) is an unfair observation, oh no, this girl has Mac Culkin beat. A friend and I saw this on its premeire night and really enjoyed it. We saw some cliches, but the twist was completely unexpected! Even watching the trailer won't tell you everything this time. You won't see it coming, even if you're looking for it.

I've just read some reviews from other websites trying to boycott this film-which failed poorly. I've heard it so many times, its almost become a mantra-it's only a movie, lighten up! The one parental organization trying to boycott it is so contradictive, not to mention hypocritical(check out Wikipedia, you'll see what I mean.) No one complained about so many other excessively violent movies in the past few years, so, until you watch the movie for yourself, you really shouldn't judge it so harshly. On this website however, despite the contraversy, I'm impressed with the overall praise it's received, so obviously most viewers saw it in its proper context. I'm not a parent myself by choice, but I know this a work of well-crafted fiction and wouldn't stop me from adopting, if I wanted to.",1255392000,4,1993,4.5515320334261835
3837971,4,B0021L8UPS,"This nifty old-school thriller pulled extremely mixed reviews when it landed in theaters last summer.  Because my two most trusted critics liked it (Ebert and Owen Gleiberman from EW), I went to see it and enjoyed it immensely.

Now that the film is on DVD (and now that I know the twist), I can appreciate the movie again from a fresh perspective, and I still think it's a first-class piece of suspense, as well as one of the best ""evil child"" movies I've ever seen.  (It also beats ""Joshua"" hands-down, despite what the critic Amazon cites above says.)

Really, the script is tight, the direction is fine, and most of all, the performances are excellent.  Except for the fact that thrillers rarely get their due at Oscar time, Farmiga and Fuhrman both give Oscar-worthy performances, and CCH Pounder makes a memorable impression as well.

But I must note two major caveats: the pace is slow and deliberate; folks with ADD will never make it all the way through the film, or they'll be fiddling with their Blackberries halfway through the first reel.  Those who like a well-crafted piece of suspense will settle in and enjoy the ride, however.

The second caveat: under NO circumstance should children under 10 see this film!!!  In fact, I have to assume that the producers had counselors on the movie set to explain ""this is just a story"" to the child actors; little Esther really terrorizes her adopted siblings, as well as one unfortunate classmate!

The only reason I have deducted one star is the lack of special features on the DVD.  There are some brief extra scenes plus an alternate ending (which is creepy but not as exciting as the regular ending), but that's it.  NO ""making of"" featurette, NO commentary.  In particular, I would have liked to have heard what Fuhrman and the other kids thought of the movie, whether they had nightmares, etc.

So Warner Brothers, like the critics, did this chilling thriller a significant disservice.  Judging from the majority of favorable reviews here at Amazon, I have to believe that this film's reputation will improve over the years, and perhaps after a decade or two, WB will release a ""Special Edition"" with the extra features such a fine effort deserves.

3837994,4,B0021L8UPS,"I originally skipped this movie because a) the trailer made it look AWFUL, b) killer kid movies are usually pretty tame and lame and c) the last Vera Farmiga killer kid movie I saw, which was indeed Joshua, sucked. Usually the kids never really do anything that awful... you know, push a few people into traffic here, knock someone out of a treehouse there... kid stuff. Not so Orphan! The blood starts flowing early, and doesn't let up! So let's get down yeah baby let's get down!

We begin in blur-o-vision with Vera as Kate being wheeled into a hospital to have a baby. She starts bleeding profusely. The nurse says sorry, the baby's dead as a rock, but Kate says no, I can feel it kicking, then they present her with a nasty bloody infant--and she wakes! Actually you could totally tell it was a dream from all the blurriness and surreality. She's having issues because her last pregnancy was a stillbirth, which might have something to do with her former alcoholism, and the fact that she's going to start shopping for replacement kids that weekend, because she feels like she needs to because the stillbirth let down her husband, John.

Actually this family is a hotbed of issues. They have a young daughter, Max, who is deaf because of something involving the pond out back of their de rigueur fabulous home, which is Kate's fault because she was hitting the booze when she should have been minding the kids. There are other issues, which get doled out later, but I'll just dump it all now. Her husband, John, had affairs back when. Anything else? Seems like there's more... Anyway, Kate obviously still has some serious issues, because she nearly has a car accident with little Max in the car. I read a review that said it's better when evil kids are placed in good families, but here it's important that Kate be a mess with a poor history of child care so it will make it plausible later that SHE is having issues and the new adoptee they get is an innocent cherub.

The movie is a little worried that its audience won't be able to sustain their attention, so there are a few absolutely pointless jump scares up front. Does ANYONE enjoy these? Join me in starting a petition to ban the inclusion of pointless jump scares in modern crap horror. Together, we can move mountains.

So they go to the orphanage where they barely look at the other girls before they meet creepy Esther upstairs painting eerily accomplished pictures. If you know the twist of the movie, which I knew going in, a lot of the stuff up here makes sense later. Her picture is about a mommy lion who lost her kids, but turns out they were alive and she found them--so there's some thematic resonance with Kate and John. They're both charmed by her maturity and poise, and decide to wrap her up and take her home. Sister Abigail, the kindly nun at the orphanage, tells them she came from Russia [listen for her on-again off-again accent] and that the family that brought her over died in a fire. She also tells them that Esther never gives them any trouble--except when they try to remove the ribbons that she wears around her neck and wrists. John and Kate think it's just a Russian thing, and there's no more about it. If you're familiar with the classic ghost story ""The Velvet Ribbon,"" you know there's something going on under there, but, well, I guess John and Kate aren't up on their classic ghost stories.

So they bring her home, where Max takes an immediate shine to her, but she's not liked by their older son, Daniel. Also present is Grandma Barbara, John's mother, who has quite a few sharp insinuations to make about Kate's mothering skills. I took one look at her and thought ""Well, guess who's fated to die?"" But of course I can't reveal what actually transpires. I need to also mention at some point that Kate has really annoying hair, and it stays annoying throughout the whole movie.

Now there's just a bunch of development stuff. There's a snotty future-victim girl at school that makes fun of Esther. Kate shows Esther a rose bush where she put the ashes of her stillborn daughter, and ""as long as it keeps growing"" she'll know the girl is in heaven or whatever. Obviously that bush is another future victim! Esther has a bizarre thick Russian bible she keeps hidden, but wussy Kate, who is afraid to set boundaries, doesn't look at it. There's a hot divorcee in town putting the moves on John. Then there's a funny sequence in which the snotty girl from school walks around this wooden playset while all these horror music cues play. It's the most terrifying playground equipment in movie history! Esther shows up out of nowhere and shoves her, but unfortunately the girl lives. Snore. Luckily Esther is about to up the savagery big time.

SPOILERS > > >
So then Sister Abigail comes to call, saying they have to do a factory recall on Esther. The little monster overhears and enlists Max, who is her little confidante, to break into John's safe, where she finds a gun! She holds the gun to little six-year-old Max's head--whoa!--then grabs a hammer and they head out by the snowy bridge. This is all in the dead of winter, by the way. As Abigail is driving away, Esther shoves Max into her way, she swerves, wrecks the car, and gets out to blubber over her, at which point Esther bludgeons her with the hammer! Innocent Max is all weepy, when Esther says ""Stop crying! Grab a foot and help me get her off the road!"" They do, and since she's still moaning, Esther repeatedly bashes her skull in, getting all bloody in the process. This is no tame kinda-mean kid movie! Esther implies all sorts of badness that might happen to Max and or mommy and daddy if Max tells. Soon she's holding a box cutter to Daniel's throat and extorting his silence as well. We also see that Esther's paintings have whole layers of violent content that only appears under black light--neat trick!

By now Kate is starting to have her suspicions, but John is telling her that she's nuts and has always been a psycho with serious issues anyway. Esther has been sweetening up to daddy big time, and when he tells her Kate might love it if she did something nice for her, Esther brings her flowers--remember the rose bush we knew wasn't long for this world? Kate freaks and jerks Esther around by the arm, but John defends the little girl. Then Esther goes into the workroom, and breaks her own arm in the vice! This girl is hardcore. She tells daddy, and he tells Kate to sleep downstairs.

Kate high-tails it to the liquor store, and while I don't mean to be callous about alcoholism, it's always a blast in movies when recovering alcoholics give up and hit the booze! Kate brings the booze back home [uh, IDIOT?] and pours one bottle out without opening the other. Then Esther puts the car in neutral with Max in it, making it look like Kate is endangering the kids again, and when she gets back home, Esther has of course pointed out the empty wine bottle. John tells her if she's not in rehab within a week, he's leaving and taking the kids. You in the audience are sitting there thinking ""He is going to owe her the world's biggest apology...""

By this time it's full-on war between Kate and Esther, although Kate is still being a wuss and won't go full-on with it. For example, WHY does the idiot do her research into Esther's background while right there in the house with Esther and the snotty grandmother? They HAVE internet cafes, you know. You can get wireless at any Starbucks. Anyway, while this is going on, Daniel is out trying to get the evidence of Abigail's death out of the treehouse, when Esther locks him in there and sets it on fire. He ends up falling and having to be taken to the hospital, where Esther loses no time in trying to finally off him for good. This is partly the fault of smug moron grandma, who I can now reveal lives to the end, although if there was anyone I wanted to die... Anyway, Kate freaks and attacks Esther, and now KATE is stuck in the hospital. Geeze, and RIGHT when that crucial call comes in from the mysterious Russian orphanage with the answers to Esther's past! Sure hope Kate checks her voice mail in timely fashion.

Well, now it's John that's hitting the booze and cigarettes. Esther comes downstairs in a sexy black dress and makeup, and puts the moves on dad. He suddenly has a big breakdown, which kind of comes out of the blue since he seemed at best slightly irritated by the whole situation, but finally tells her no. Meanwhile, at his hospital, Kate finally gets that important call! And the secret twist is...

It's no Russian orphanage--it's an Estonian mental institution! And guess what? Esther is no nine-year-old. She has a chromosomal imbalance and is actually 33 YEARS OLD! She moves into families, splits the mom and dad up, and tries to seduce the dad. When he refuses, she kills them all!

This, of course, happens during a driving snowstorm. Now, there's no way I'm going to spoil the awesome ending for you, as it's just too wild, but I will make a few observations. First, Kate becomes a serious offender of distracted driving. John finds some secret paintings of him and Esther doing the hokey-pokey, but you'll notice that in then Esther is full-sized, because there is NO WAY any movie is going to show, you know, THAT. Next, I don't know how I might react in such a situation, but if I were to find a bloody corpse in my house with the murderer still at large on the premises, I doubt I would waste precious survival time blubbering over the corpse. Maybe I'm just cold. We again learn that if the psychopathic murderer is just knocked down and unconscious, do not leave them alone until you have put a bullet in their head! And finally, looks like Kate's never gonna get that apology...

Before we get out of the spoilers, I want to point out that the reason most killer kid movies are so lame is precisely that the evil ones ARE kids, and as such can't really be too bad without peeving parent's associations and outraging religious groups. Therefore, the whole reason Esther CAN be so bad is precisely that she's NOT a kid. Which is part of what makes this movie so uncomfortable for so long--you can't BELIEVE this kid is pushing six-year-olds into traffic and bludgeoning old nuns, and it definitely takes you out of the comfort zone... which is part of why I believe this movie is considered ""bad."" But we'll pick this up after we invite the non-spoiler folks back in.
< < < SPOILERS END

In retrospect, I wouldn't say this movie is really that ""bad,"" I would just say that it is so discomfiting for so long--she's just a KID!--that it makes you feel a little funny. And then, this twist is SUCH a leap--although a fairly ingenious one, I think--that it maybe jars the audience a little too much. And it comes a little late in the movie, too, for such a big re-arrangement of everything you thought you understood. And as you know, when people are uncomfortable and don't understand a movie, they usually decide that it's bad. Why, even look at me: I started this review thinking this was a bad movie in the vein of Knowing, but now, after a little processing [and a day's time] I kind of think it's pretty clever.

Which is not to say it's not still a hoot. The movie has a fair amount of setup--most of which is relevant, so I don't begrudge the two hour-plus running time. I was snickering throughout, and the whole thing is a great deal of evil fun. Furthermore, it seems to know it, and has tongue planted in cheek. Nevertheless, I think one would be better prepared if one didn't go in expecting a GOOD movie.

Anyway, yeah, tons of fun! Yay, Orphan! Yay, killer kids! Go in expecting a big silly potboiler and Esther'll show you a good time.",1254268800,6,11765,4.528941176470588

I went to see Orphan after a friend told me it was a great film and had a great story and a great twist in the end.

I have to say it has been awhile since I had been on the edge of my seat and this one did a good job at it.
I give this movie 5 stars because even though it is advertised as a horror movie, it's really a strong thriller and a good suspense drama rolled into one.

See for yourself and buy Orphan on DVD October 27th!!",1254268800,2,529,3.7567567567567566
3837996,2,B0021L8UPS,"Orphan is a film based on a mother who's just had a miscarriage. She already has kids but feels quite haunted by the fact that she had a miscarriage. Played by Vera Farmiga. She decides to adopt and her adoption turns out to be quite a bad decision and things start going wrong. Wait, I think I'm making it sound interesting cause the acting is really bad but what's worse is the direction. There is bad character logic and one feels the characters are acting especially Vera Farmiga who is usually one of my favourite actresses. I have seen all her films and have really liked most of them (Running Scared, The boy with stripes pajyamas, Never Forever...) I mention this because the sole reason I picked this film to watch is because of Vera Farmiga. I don't think Peter S. could have been any worse but I've seen his acting skills so again I blame the direction and the story writer.

Please skip the Orphan cause it's nothing special. It is a really bad date film and it ruins everything. If you wish to watch something scary wait for more movies to come out and then see. Or if you're looking for more scary films from the comfort of home (DVD) then I would recommend ""1408"" and ""The Strangers"" ... the latter is under-rated.",1254182400,2,1229,4.4622222222222225

3837998,5,B0021L8UPS,"It is very difficult to form any objective impression of this film's quality by reading reviews because opinion is so divided. Some reviewers call it a highly skilled work while others deride it. In particular, it is the stunning plot twist with about 15 minutes left that split opinion.

Before I watched it, the divisiveness and controversy intrigued me, together with the whole premise of inviting an evil female child into your home.

My review seeks to bring some ""objectivity"" into the discussion.

Nine-year old Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman) is adopted by Kate (Vera Farmiga) and John (Peter Sarsgaard), a couple who are struggling to come to terms with the loss of their third child, who was stillborn. Their first two children are still very young, and they look to adopt another child in search of healing, not only for the loss of their child, but for a rift in their marriage.

Esther charms them at the orphanage, and they fall in love with her. After they take her home, there are increasing signs that ""there's something wrong with Esther"". She moves about strangely at night and displays a shocking vindictiveness towards other children. Layer after layer of her mysterious past is expertly unravelled by the film's makers as violent act by violent act plays itself out, culminating in the most stunning revelation near the end.

In order to enjoy this film, you must be open-minded and imaginative. You must be willing to suspend your disbelief more than usual in a work of fiction. Some things in this film will stretch your belief to the limit, but if you're open-minded and remind yourself that this world can be bizarre and confounding, you will better enjoy the intense, wicked ride this movie takes you on.

What did I love about the film? Firstly, the character of Esther is distinctly different from the evil figure in other horror films; she is a more human character than, say, the Antichrist in 'Omen'. This film is a psychological, not supernatural, horror and Esther actually draws some sympathy for being victimised at school for being ""different"". Many of us are familiar with this feeling. The film portrays Esther as a deeply disturbed, yet gifted, person wrestling fiercely with her demons, and makes it deeply challenging for the viewer to judge her as merely ""evil"". Many in the audience even relate to her, which makes 'Orphan' that much more intriguing and a moral challenge.

The film is more likely to interest you if you have an interest in psychology, including mental illness and marital relationship issues.

Secondly, it is visually stunning, incredibly artistic and compelling - a true work of art. Many of the most disturbing images are also the most creative and evocative, often even beautiful in a twisted kind of way. The director is brilliant with camera angles and movements to create a persistent, clinging sense of unease in the story.

That leads me to my third praise: it builds tension right from the start, and absolutely refuses to let up. Through camera movements that constantly create a sinister feeling, through music that ever so subtly creeps under your skin, through a succession of troubling omens leading up to Esther's adoption, the film's creators keep you on the edge from start to finish, which is what a horror film should do but very few actually manage to.

Isabelle Fuhrman puts in a riveting performance as Esther. Farmiga and Sarsgaard are also very impressive, and the issues in their marriage add to the rich psychological depth of this film. Innocent little Maxine, played by the adorable Aryana Engineer, is a brilliant foil to the malevolent Esther.",1253145600,4,3630,4.936065573770492
3837999,5,B0021L8UPS,"In this age of computer graphics and special effects came this little gem, which needed not rely on either. As well, it is only right that I mention that for a horror thriller, the performances were fantastic. The plot keeps the audience interested throughout the film.
There are similarities between this and a few other films. The Good Son starring Macaulay Culkin at first came to mind.
From the atmosphere all the way through to the plot...this movie truly delivers!
I have viewed this film twice at the theatre and it was just as good the second time around as it was for the first.
The young actors in this film are as good as the adults and it's the acting that brings this film out of pure mediocrity!
The Orphan is a welcome edition to the horror/thriller genre and is not a film that you are likely to forget once you see it!
Compared to many of the horrible horror films that make it to theatrical release...this film was worthy of being released theatrically!
The film's character is more sadistic than 'The Good Son' and more evil than 'The Bad Seed.'
This is not Damien from The Omen series...but Esther can hold her own in the world of evil movie children.
Sure, there have been many, from The Children of the Damned all the way through to The Children of the Corn.
Whatever the case may be...there's something very special about Esther!
I can't recommend this movie enough to fans of the genre!
The family's home is beautiful, as well as the Canadian scenery used to add another special quality to this film which would otherwise be lacking!
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I felt that most everything that was included in the film was needed to further the plot along.
There were no elements of it that weren't necessary.
Whether it was meant to establish the relationship between the husband and the wife...and their issues, or the parents' relationship with their children...it was all NECESSARY!
In the end, all the elements come together and we are presented with a film that amazes us, surprises us and maybe even frightens us a bit!
There are funny moments throughout that provide us with a sense of dark humor, but when it comes down to it, this is not a funny film, but a deeply disturbing movie!
It kept me on the edge of my seat throughout it's 2 hour running time. In fact, I hated to see it end.
I will revisit this little treasure again, as well as adding it to my personal movie collection!
There are a few surprises thrown into this film that might surprise you.
It will keep you on edge and you WILL genuinely care about the characters in the movie.
Having seen numerous horror thrillers, I believe that this added something special to the genre that we don't see very much: a talented cast of actors giving it all they've got in order to make a believable movie for the audience to enjoy!
Great acting in a horror thriller is few and far between!
This film is definitely NOT for children and although this is not a gory picture...it is still very disturbing!
I am particularly fond of movies that can touch us emotionally, and yet, disturb us as well!
You feel the love of the parents for their children and vice versa.
As well, the relationship between the parents is very well written and it adds a dynamic to the new developing relationship between Esther and her new dad!
At the same time that mom and dad are drifting apart...it is helping to bring the developing father/daughter relationship closer together!
Being that Esther is so manipulative...she had dad playing right into her hands...or so she thinks. At the same time...she makes it look as if mom's prior alcohol problem is beginning to resurface again!
The young actors in this film are very convincing and as they are threatened, scared and concerned for their lives...we see it in their faces and they portray their roles with much accuracy!
The role of Esther was brilliantly portrayed by Isabelle Fuhrman.
It is probably the best single performance of a child actress in the history of this genre!
However, I truly hope that this role does not come back to haunt her...as her acting is very versatile...so Hollywood should take notice of this up and coming STAR!
All in all, you will be impressed by the acting skills of the entire family in this movie!
They all gave 110% to their roles!
The Orphan is a disturbing film guaranteed to keep you entertained the entire time you sit in front of the screen.
The movie is guaranteed to throw a surprise at you before it's over and I doubt very much that you figure out what it is!
The characters are very well developed and the character of Esther was brilliantly portrayed. There is a sense of innocence present...but beneath the facade lies a very dangerous, manipulative and sadistic personality!
Isabelle shows great ability in her portrayal of this complex character!
The movie offers much sentiment early on and this helps us later to care for the film's characters more than we would if they hadn't been so well developed!
It seems that this little girl is intent on tearing her new family apart.
She does her best to fit in...but it's difficult for a disturbed child like Esther to make friends...much less to keep them.
Mom and brother suspect that things are not as they seem and over the course of the movie, we realize this as well.
The intriguing thing is that the audience cannot wait to see what will happen next...and that's how I knew that I was witnessing a great film!
I was truly surprised as the movie went along with many of the twists thrown into the mix.
This is a five star thriller with fantastic actors and a fantastic script.
As the movie's tagline says, ""There's Something Wrong With Esther.""
As well, there is something wrong with you if you don't see this movie!
Enjoy! Highly Recommended!",1250899200,6,5773,4.622200584225901
3838000,5,B0021L8UPS,"I have seen quite a few of these ""evil children"" thriller/horror movies, such as ""the bad seed"", ""the good son"" and ""the Omen"". Of these movies, Orphan most reminds me of ""the good son"", but for a more adult audience.

 In a ""careful what you wish for plot"", a depressed mother tries to fill the void by adopting a child. Unfortunately she chooses Esther, the extremely talented, cute and quiet Orphan, with a hidden past of terror. Isabelle Furhman plays the part of Esther, and does a spectacular job. The movie is full of unique characters, but it's Isabelle Furhman who really steals the show (no wonder she is the star of the movie).

I will certainly add this movie to my DVD collection when it becomes available. Do yourself a favor. Go out, have fun and watch one of the better movies of the year.",1249603200,4,805,4.5

I didn't know what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised. See this movie!",1249171200,7,390,4.924242424242424
3838002,4,B0021L8UPS,"ISABELLE FUHRMAN, VERA FARMIGA and PETER SARSGAARD are hardly household names to me but they do a superb job of carrying the main suspense ingredients of ORPHAN--as does the atmospheric photography filmed among snowy Canadian landscapes.

So do all the other members of the cast--all very convincing in their roles, especially the little deaf girl ARYANA ENGINEER. She's adorable and becomes a pawn in the manipulations of Esther (Fuhrman), the orphan adopted into the household before a background check can reveal the truth about her past.

Of course, anyone familiar with the pattern of most horror films of this ilk can spot some of the usual set-ups: a husband who is clueless about seriously suspecting the orphan can be evil, the wife whom nobody believes because she has a drinking problem, the little brother who resents the intrusion of a ""different"" kind of girl, the well meaning nun whose social worker instincts will lead to her downfall.

But many other aspects of the plot come as a surprise and are, to say the least, unexpected and shockingly gruesome.

And some threads of the plot can be suspected pretty early on. Still, the final twist at the end is shocking and satisfying, thanks to the performance Fuhrman has so convincingly given. She plays the role with such sweet and sometimes sinister maturity that the final revelation is acceptable.

ORPHAN delivers the chills, all staged brilliantly and turns into a horror film that is just as chilly as the ever snowy weather, with frozen ponds and feathery flakes making the indoor sets of a rustic cabin look most inviting.

Good direction and superior art decoration, as well as strong performances, makes this an above average thriller.",1249171200,4,1710,5.003521126760563
3838003,3,B0021L8UPS,"Orphan (Jaume Collet-Serra, 2009)

To Orphan's credit, I will say that the assertion made in the trailer is accurate: I never saw the Big Reveal coming. The flipside of that is that I didn't see it coming because it's a huge cop-out, as it is with most films of this type. This is a problem, because in order to explain what's wrong with this movie, I'd have to give away the big reveal, and I do try not to do spoilers in a review--especially when I'm going to end up telling you to see the movie, as I probably will with this one. There are a number of good things about this movie, and the fact that they're each balanced with a bad aspect doesn't make the good parts any less rewarding. But it's the Big Reveal that was the killer here; I'd have unhesitatingly recommended the movie, warts and all, were it not for that.

Orphan is the story of a family who adopt a nine-year-old girl named Esther, played quite creepily by Hounddog's Isabelle Fuhrman in her first big-budget flick. Previous to Esther's arrival, the family--mother Kate (The Manchurian Candidate's Vera Farmiga), father John (The Mysteries of Pittsburgh's Peter Sarsgaard), son Daniel (Star Trek's Jimmy Bennett), and Daughter Max (Aryanna Engineer in her first screen role)--is your basic family, though they have recently (it's never explicitly stated, but is seems to have been roughly six months before this) had a devastating event. The couple's third child, Jessica, was stillborn, and they're looking for a child to whom they can give the love, in Kate's words, they had for Jessica. When they first meet Esther, at the St. Mary's Home for Girls, she seems bright, open, and friendly, and Sister Abigail (the wonderful CCH Pounder) is actually kind of impressed that the usually reserved Esther has opened up to them. When they get her home, though, things start going wrong. While John is convinced it's all in her head, Kate thinks that perhaps Esther is not the innocent she passes herself off as (and thanks to the way the story unfolds, we know that Kate is right, and that the big thing here is Kate needing to convince John that she's not crazy).

I think a lot of the problem Orphan has had with early reviewers has to do with its marketing; this is not a horror film in any way, it's a bad-kid movie along the lines of The Good Son or Godsend, a psychological thriller rather than a horror flick. It doesn't help that Dark Castle's name is attached to it, but somewhere along the way, Dark Castle has graduated from being a purveyor of crappy remakes to a distributor of movies that are actually trying, and the first few scenes here definitely try. Check out the shot at the beginning of the third scene in, where Vera Farmiga is walking across a schoolyard. The optical illusion as she walks just along the tree branch's path is just great. Not at all the kind of thing I'd have expected from Collet-Serra (House of Wax). Looked at as a thriller, it's not as much of a disconnect. And the acting here is top-notch from everyone involved, which makes it a great deal stronger than other movies of this type. There's quite a bit to like here.

Balancing that, though, are the movie's problems, all of which come from a screenplay by first-time write David Johnson, formerly a production assistant to Frank Darabont. For a movie that essentially revolves around this family's dynamic and how it changes in Esther's presence, we don't actually get to see much of that family dynamic; it suffers from the American problem of thinking that too much character development is a bad thing, and so we get told a lot of things we should be shown, and a lot of things that would probably have helped make this a great movie (one of the biggest is the character of John's mother, who we see as nothing more than a way to advance the plot; there's a scene she has with Vera Farmiga that tells us, though, she could have been so much more). And, of course, there's a Big Reveal, which seems to exist as a way for the screenwriter to assuage his conscience about making a bad-kid movie (compare, for example, to Godsend, where the cop-out wasn't so much in the Big Reveal as it was scattered throughout the movie). More subtly, though, I think the bond formed between Esther and Max would have been a lot more believable if Esther's personality hadn't been so simplistic. We know from the opening scenes that Esther is capable of acting friendly; wouldn't it have been obvious to have Esther build a strong friendship with Max in order to secure her trust, instead of doing what she does? (It got so bad I really thought the Big Reveal was going to be that she was a pint-sized hitman for the Russian Mob.) Contrasted with all this is the script's willingness to allow us to get to know these characters, which is something of a contradiction in terms; I wonder if a lot of the problems with this didn't happen in the editing room rather than in the script. Perhaps they cut it because they thought it was too long (the theatrical cut runs just over two hours); I'd have been more than willing to sit through another thirty or forty-five minutes of the slow, but wonderful, setup here in order to see more of the family and the way it changes before we get to the nasty stuff. And for the record, the nasty stuff isn't all that nasty (the movie's opening scene is actually its most gruesome).

This movie stirred up controversy months before it opened, which telegraphs to me that, obviously, those stirring didn't actually see the movie. I don't think I'll be wrong in my prediction that few of them, if any, will ever actually see it; movie protesters rarely do (I quizzed protesters outside movies from The Last Temptation of Christ to Kinsey, and have yet to find one who actually saw the movie they were complaining about). Ignore them. While Orphan has its share of problems, as far as bad-kid movies go, it's the best I've come across. At this rate, we should finally get the definitive bad-kid psychological thriller in about ten years. I'll be waiting. ** ",1248739200,3,6038,4.6016713091922
