2712866,5,B00006423P,"Pity this DVD isn't available in the U.S.  I saw this movie awhile back on Turner Classic Movies.  Terry-Thomas plays a businessman engaged in shady tax dodging schemes who comes to the attention of a gang of Britain's dumbest criminals.  First, they try to burglarize his safe but he chases them off like school boys on a lark.  Then, they try to kidnap his daughter  only they kidnap his wife by mistake.  When they proceed  to blackmail him with threats to kill her and cut her into little pieces, he tells them that they can do as they like, he won't pay them any money.  The crooks are shocked by his ""inhumanity.""  They are dumbfounded at this turn of events.

When the wife finds out that he is dating and bestowing furs and jewels on his secretary, she decides not only to join the gang, but take it over  and turn the tables on her husband.  The fortunes of the gang improve and her husband falls into a trail of misfortune.

The action comedy is superb in this movie especially the scenes with the hearse and the top hats as the gang abducts the wife.

The actors are great. Terry-Thomas gives a --- smashing --- performance in this movie.

Another great Mario Zampi movie from this era.",1206230400,9,1197,4.451612903225806
2712867,5,B00006423P,"This is absolutely my favorite comedy. It left me laughing so hard, my gales have drowned out most of the other great comedies that have followed.

It was one of the British Rank Studio comedies that came out in the late 50's and early 60's. These films featured a revolving repertory cast that included Terry-Thomas, Peter Sellers, Ian Carmichael, and Alastair Sim. In this movie, Terry-Thomas is the sole male lead, turning in his peak performance.

It's about a group of retirees living in a London boarding house. They are all feeling a bit over the hill - when a mink stole turns up in their midst. Assuming (falsely as it turns out) that the young woman employed as their housekeeper has reverted to her old ways as a petty thief - the retirees decide to protect her by returning the stole to its rightful owners before the housekeeper can be accused.

Terry-Thomas organizes the elderly women in the boarding house according to military principles and launches a derring-do campaign. Everyone is so revivified by the hectic danger of returning the stole, they hate to break off the fun once it's done. They decide on a new mission in life. Henceforward, instead of returning fur coats, they will STEAL them. They of course pledge to donate all proceeds to worthy charities - so everything is alright. And the game's afoot.

This unlikely band of brigands range zanily through London, donning ludicrous disguises, assuming strange accents, accoutering themselves with bizarre appendages, such as the huge false bosoms the thinnest of them sprouts in order to pose as a Duchess at a local fur shop. So successful and yet so fundamentally inept is this troup, the police couldn't possibly suspect any of them as being behind the rash of fur robberies that plagues London.

Perhaps the funniest scene ever captured on film is the one that plays out when the inspector arrives to question these retirees. Their orchestrated attempt at deflecting what they fear may be police suspicions - brings new meaning to the phrase ""playing dumb.""

All the actors are superb in their parts. Billy Whitlaw as the housekeeper is the perfect straight woman for this lunacy. She doesn't have a clue what the seniors are up to, but fears for their sanity as she sees them traipsing back to their rooms day after day, in underwear, sporting large blonde wigs, or otherwise in some unrecognizable dishevelment.

Another hilarious scene revolves around Terry-Thomas' efforts to make use of the housekeeper's mildly criminal past, by pumping her for information on where he could find a fence - a fence for stolen goods. As pretext, he tells her that he's thinking of writing a book entitled, ""I was a Teen-Age Delinquent.""

This movie is incomparable. I was sorry when it ended and I had to leave the company of this madcap quartet. I would have liked to frolic through London with them forever, making common cause with their Robin Hood heisting. It is comforting though that the group maintained an indomitable spirit. When I'm depressed and the world seems thoroughly bleak, I project myself out of this place by picturing Terry-Thomas, still out there leading his merry band. And I'm out there with them, perhaps in a Groucho Marx mustache, casing some fur shop joint.

If only Americans weren't so averse to vehicles starring older people - this would be the perfect premise for a sit-com. Maybe if I get rich, I'll make the pilot myself. These characters are too much sheer delight to be forgotten.",1145923200,2,3487,4.866779089376054

2712870,4,B00006423P,"A gem from a golden age of British comedy. This carefree romp from the era of Peter Sellers, Terry Thomas, Alastair Sim, and Ian Carmichael tears into bungled capers and slippery rascals without stopping to catch its breath. It may not be prize-winning but is a very good evening's entertainment.",1443139200,,296,4.94
2712871,4,B00006423P,"Terry-Thomas fans must NOT miss this one! What a genius. Also, the clever writing exemplifies that point when there was enough freedom for sexy, adult humor, without resorting to vulgarity. The plot may have inspired the 1986 movie Outrageous People (Danny Devito, Bette Midler, and Judge Reinhold), but is different enough that this is no spoiler. All in all a little-known gem that I'll look forward to catching again some time.",1431475200,,430,5.070422535211268

2712874,5,B00006423P,"love terry-thomas, so i had to watch this movie.  such fun!  in fact it was so good, i'll probably watch it again.

""too many crooks"" has garnered some excellent summaries from other reviewers, so i won't do that.  instead, i'll point out something strange i noticed.  i have a habit of reading opening credits.  i do it to see the names of the actors who portray the minor characters and (this is kind of embarrassing) to see if any of the westmore brothers did the makeup.  i've been doing this since i was a kid.  don't judge me.

while doing that, i noticed ""furs by arpad-tico.""  this meant nothing to me until the first scene when the gang bungled an attempted burglary at the very beginning of the movie.  the store in front of which the young lady is standing is called ""arpad-tico mink of mayfair.""  i blinked and had to look at the credits again.

i have no idea if this is or was a real business, but felt a burning need to point it out to anyone who might find it intriguing.

yes, i have too much time on my hands.  again, don't judge me.  >wink<",1427587200,,1059,4.2727272727272725
2712875,4,B00006423P,"A gem.  It seems to be the source for at least three Monty Python skits.  Timing and polish not the same as a modern comedy,  If you have time to watch it, you won't waste your time.",1427328000,,182,3.864864864864865

2712883,5,B00006423P,This movie reminded me of the reason why Terry-Thomas was one of my favourite comedic actors when I was a teenager. The scenes at the house fire and in the courtroom was to me the funniest parts of the movie. Too bad that there are no comedians of his or Bob Hope's caliber around these days.,1401062400,3,292,4.232142857142857

2712887,5,B00006423P,"This is a terrific piece of comedy, satisfying on every level. Another great late '50's or 60's black and white Terry-Thomas film featuring the most inept of crooks. Suitable for the entire family. Don't miss it!",1378512000,3,212,4.916666666666667
8163722,4,B00006423P,"As I watched this pleasant little Brit comedy, I came to realize that it must have served as the inspiration for the 1986 Zucker Bros. film Ruthless People. If you've seen that film, you'll find the original less venal and more genteel, as befits an English film from the 1950s (for example, unlike Danny Devito's character in Ruthless, Terry Thomas' character doesn't actually want the kidnappers to murder his wife, he's just calling their bluff). Another difference from the later film is that here the kidnappers don't have a personal axe to grind, they're simply professional (albeit incompetent) crooks. Whether or not you're familiar with Ruthless People, you should find this an enjoyable, chuckle-filled little comedy.",1474761600,,727,5.275862068965517
