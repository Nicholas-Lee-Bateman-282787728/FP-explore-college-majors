8581014,5,B00CENU4MA,"I was vaguely aware of Curtis Harrington because I'd come across his campy, offbeat What's The Matter With Helen? when I was researching the career of Agnes Moorehead. This dvd, however, gave me lots more insight into the early work of this influential filmmaker.

The dvd includes Fragment of Seeing (1946), Picnic (1948), and On the Edge (1949), The Assignation (1953), The Wormwood Star (1955), along with bonus features.

Fragment of Seeing feels and looks like a student film which it should since it was made when Harrington was only twenty. Still, it shows Harrington has already developed an artist's eye and has an Expressionist tone. Harrington, who stars in this short, clearly demonstrates the frightening alienation of a young man unsure of his sexuality.

Picnic, made two years later, features his parents at a windy Malibu Beach. The most memorable scene for me was the first one, when the family members, one by one, get out of the vehicle. This film has a fresher style, more of a French New Wave style than Expressionistic. It features a strong male point of view, and, again, alienation is a major theme. On the Edge, made in 1949, is set at the Salton Sea and continues the theme of alienation and dissatisfaction.

The Assignation, made in Venice 1953, is a much more professionally-made film. It has a NIght Gallery look to it and is in color and features quicker edits. It's even darker than the earlier stuff as it takes on the theme of death and decay.

The Wormwood Star (1955) is an homage to Marjorie Cameron. Saturated color and her disturbing paintings help create a film that could have easily been produced in the 1960s. The occult and religious symbolism are featured.

Usher, made in 2002, is Harrington's final film and continues his lifelong obsession with Edgar Allan Poe. He'd originally made an earlier version of the Poe story in high school. In this one, he stars along with members of the Church of Satan. Like Harrington's later work, it's campy, creepy, and highly entertaining.

The bonus features the original film, The Fall of the House of Usher, that he made in 1942. Again, in this early work, you can see the influence of Expressionism on him.

Included also is The Four Elements (1966), an industrial film made for the United States Information Agency. The documentary has a modern tone and is loaded with striking images and forms. By this point in his career, Harrington had become a capable director.

Finally, the dvd includes two interviews where Harrington talks about his childhood, influences, Poe, horror films, Maye Deren, surrealism, spirituality, his time in Europe, Josef von Sternberg, David Lynch, Hollywood, and more. Although the second interview is repetitive, there's interesting information in both.

Flicker Alley has done an excellent job putting together this dvd. A short but engrossing booklet includes an essay by Lisa Janssen and film notes by Mark Toscano.

NOTE: I received a copy of the dvd in exchange for an honest and fair review.",1392681600,2,3015,4.938735177865612
8581015,5,B00CENU4MA,"Curtis Harrington had a very interesting career -- he started as an experimental filmmaker working the underground fringes of California and Europe (milieus he shared with a contemporary of his, Kenneth Anger), worked for a while as a director of some very interesting and imaginative thrillers such as Night Tide and Games, worked in television for a short time, and then ended his career with another underground short which appears on this disk.

This collection includes all of his early short films, Fragment of Seeing (a kind of gentler run through the same orbit as the aforementioned Kenneth Anger's Fireworks), Picnic (a disquieting short that could almost be a dry run for some of the horror films Harrington would make later in his career), On The Edge (equally unnerving), The Assignation (beating Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now to the punch by exploiting the creepy side of Venice), The Wormwood Star (a brief, abstract look at the occult icon Cameron) and Usher, the last film Harrington made, starring himself in the title role(s?) that playfully tweaks Poe's tale.

This is worth the price to anyone interested in experimental film or who has somewhat adventurous tastes.  The picture quality, considering the age of the elements, is first rate and sitting down and watching all of the films in one swoop could make for a very entertaining afternoon.",1379635200,,1365,5.057777777777778
8581016,5,B00CENU4MA,"This is a marvelous collection of short films by director Curtis Harrington, which spans a 60 year period between his two adaptations of Poe's FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER.  Dipping into the waters of the avant-garde, the 2002 version of USHER features members of the Church of Satan in the cast, along with Harrington himself.  There are also a couple of vintage interviews with Harrington included as supplements.

The Blu-ray/DVD set makes a perfect companion to Harrington's recently released autobiography NICE GUYS DON'T WORK IN HOLLYWOOD.  Harrington's major opus NIGHT TIDE (1961) is expected to be released on Blu-ray in October of 2013, remastered in high definition.",1379376000,,675,5.222222222222222
