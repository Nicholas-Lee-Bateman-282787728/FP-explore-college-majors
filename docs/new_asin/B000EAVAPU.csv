8107960,5,B000EAVAPU,"This is a very unique and enjoyable ballet DVD of pure abstract dance.  Many unusual steps that you probably have never seen before.  It consists of 20 minute portions of 3 of Bach's cello suites.  (I generally don't like the unaccompanied cello, but this matches the dancing very nicely.)  I recommend it highly, but don't watch it all of it in one sitting; intersperse each suite with something light, like a Coppelia or a Cinderella, but not a Giselle for God's sake.  Note: The best Swan Lake by far is that of Peter Wright with the Royal Swedish Ballet.",1447200000,,558,4.595959595959596

8107963,5,B000EAVAPU,"This abstract ballet is set to J. S. Bach's Suites No. 2,3,&6 for unaccompanied cello(the cellist is Claudius Herrmann).  The choreography, by Heinz Spoerli, is extremely challenging and interesting.  It includes many adagios and grand and petite allegros, both solo and group dances, partnered and unpartnered, in accord with the music tempi.  The dancing is mostly classical in style, the women dance on pointe, the men in the usual ballet slippers.  Spoerli's style is very lyrical and smooth, demonstrating the limits of each of the dancers abilities.  The costumes are mostly simple, but attractive leotards.  There is essentially only a black background most of the time, with a simple hoop in the back of the space.  The hoop gives of colored vapors at times.  The floor is lit with very bright and colorful lights with some simple textures.  The image(widescreen) and sound(Dolby digital 5.1) are perfect.  As a special feature, there is a 22 minute interview with Heinz Spoerli, explaining his thoughts on the work, including clips from the ballet to illustrate his points.  There is also included a 32 page booklet in French, English, and German, with lots of colorful photos.  This is highly recommended for lovers of modern ballet and dance.",1153353600,19,1253,5.1182266009852215
