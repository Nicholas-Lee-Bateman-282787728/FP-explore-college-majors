7010982,1,B00TJ57TBA,"this comes off as an adult version of ""Scooby-Doo""; although ""adult"" is open to interpretation in this case.

This movie is garbage with everybody running around like chickens without heads and lots of yelling and screaming.

These are a bunch of morons making an alleged documentary about the Holodomor, which is also known as the ""Terror-Famine in Ukraine"" and ""Famine-Genocide in Ukraine"" in which millions of people died and many succumbed to cannibalism; this horrific episode in human history brought to you by Josef Stalin.

This movie is an insult to those millions.",1436313600,6,574,5.150537634408602
7010983,1,B00TJ57TBA,"Painful to watch. A few of my favorite highpoints in this film: Wind as seen on night vision, upside down boots and mist as seen on night vision!",1436140800,2,145,4.214285714285714
7010984,3,B00TJ57TBA,Creepy ! I did not like the ending.,1435968000,,35,3.5
7010985,5,B00TJ57TBA,"this i thought was going in the direction of blair witch project but so much better then the blair witch  project
i never liked that movie in the 1st place
but ghoul  is  great for their scares",1435881600,,193,4.162162162162162
7010986,2,B00TJ57TBA,Super crappy. There was one actress who wasn't too bad. Don't waste your time.,1435795200,3,78,4.642857142857143
7010987,4,B00TJ57TBA,"I truly have to disagree with the other reviews here.  it seems that when the 'found footage' oeuvre began, anybody and everybody compares movies to the Blair Witch debacle.  I have to say that Ghoul was indeed a departure as we see the culmination of the time spent as opposed to scrambling websites and asking friends what it was we just witnessed.  This film had some valleys but it was far outweighed by its peaks and for the impressive amount of tension, cinematography and scares included. I will state that the lead could have toned down the valley girl shtick, but the lion's share of this movie is well worth a viewing and surprisingly satisfying.  All in all, time spent well.",1435708800,2,686,4.644628099173554
7010988,3,B00TJ57TBA,"Worth a watch. The atmosphere was good. The story was grim and morbid. A few creepy scenes. The one thing that ruins a movie for me is extremely unlikable characters. The characters in this movie were not very likable, therefore,  i lose interest because i stop caring what happens to them. A watch once kinda movie.",1435622400,2,316,4.642857142857143
7010989,2,B00TJ57TBA,Another crazy movie.  Not sure I'd recommend.,1435363200,,45,5.428571428571429
7010990,1,B00TJ57TBA,"I just watched Ghoul last night: it really sucked. Why?  It is basically a copy of the Blair Witch's ""shaky camera"" filming style, as the Americans are filming a documentary in Ukraine. But where Blair Witch was  very successful at building suspense and character development, this movie totally falls flat. If you copy another movie's technique to such an extreme and shameless degree as Ghoul does Blair Witch, it betrays a common failing of today's movie makers in Hollywood: laziness, total lack of imagination, and the glaring inability to create something original. IMDB rates this 4.5/10 stars, but that is way too generous. This movie is a FLOP.  Period.",1435363200,3,662,5.055045871559633
7010991,3,B00TJ57TBA,Average found-footage type film with pretty good acting & interesting story but kind of lost me at times.,1435104000,,105,4.888888888888889
7010992,2,B00TJ57TBA,"Actually, a 1.5 star. We've seen it before, in the ""Found-footage"" sub-genre, except this is more yelling and jerky visuals than most. What did it in for me, though, was the closed captions, which for some reason were delayed by a WHOLE FREAKING HOUR!!!! Not that missing the dialog detracted much, but still.",1437436800,2,309,4.849056603773585
7010993,5,B00TJ57TBA,Great found footage horror,1437436800,,26,5.75
7010994,5,B00TJ57TBA,Very cool film,1437350400,,14,4.0
7010995,1,B00TJ57TBA,"I have a pretty strong stomach/tolerance for low-budget horror films, but this was, far and away, the worst movie I have ever seen. It starts with an interesting premise, but the story becomes so convoluted, the actors are so bad, the characters are so unlikeable, it makes almost zero senseI had to shut it off just past the hour mark, and I doubt anything could have redeemed it.",1437177600,3,381,4.617647058823529
7010996,2,B00TJ57TBA,"A group of young film makers travel to a remote Ukrainian village to document twentieth century cannibalism. They film in a farm house where Boris Glaskov lived and claimed he was forced by a spirit to eat people. A little historical background is provided by the Holodomor, when the Ukrainians were forced into starvation and some resorted to cannibalism. The group includes a spiritualist who knows how to use a Ouija board.

This is another hand held camera film. It includes the ""Okay it's off"" scene, some minor ground cam, the green screen cam and nighttime shaky cam.  No inside tent ""what was that noise?"" cam. Almost all the film shooting was done on the farm, and most in one particular room. Much of the film was spent translating what the spiritualist was spouting. Includes the typical scary gags and has to introduce a new character to finish up the tale.

Guide: F-bomb. distant sex. brief distant computer mutilation nudity.",1436745600,,940,4.8625
7010997,1,B00TJ57TBA,Aweful.,1436745600,2,7,7.0
7010998,2,B00TJ57TBA,"Well, I really really wanted to like this one. I like the setting, the storyline, and there were even a few scares to be had here, but the bottom line is the 3 leads were so unforgivably unlikable that it ruined any tension or suspense. Without exaggeration, after the first 10 minutes, they spend the film screaming and yelling and blaming each other for even the slightest little things; even before the actual scary scenes begin, they're dramatically arguing and making mountains out of molehills. I did not care for these people at all; they reminded me of all the d-bag hipster ""too cool"" college kids in my town, and it was a relief when they'd get the chop. Also, was there a script? If there was, this movie would win awards for the use of the ""f"" word. I've watched Tarantino films where the characters used it less. If you watch this, play a drinking game -- any time someone says the ""f"" word or screams histrionically, take a drink. You'll be so hammered by the mid-point of the film, you'll black out and be spared the rest of this wasted opportunity. Picture each average scene in the movie going like this --
Girl (screaming): WHAT THE F*** IS THAT F*** IN THAT F****?!?!?!
Guy (screaming): SHUT UP YOU F****!
And that's the whole movie. There's worse out there, but this is nothing more than a time-waster.",1436659200,5,1322,4.5588235294117645
7010999,1,B00TJ57TBA,"Predictable fare with foul-mouthed idiot American kids off to the wilds of what is purported to be Ukraine to make a documentary on 20th century cannibals. Wow. Where did they get the idea for that? So it's off to the absolute middle of nowhere - where they can still get internet, btw - to meet the sole remaining survivor of the starvation diet imposed by Stalin on the Ukrainians in the 30's. Somehow, we go from this guy to Andrei Chikatilo. Serial killer he might have been but not a cannibal. I still fail to see the connection. Oh yes, they pass through the town he was born in. It had some cows. Hopeless mess goes from one clich to another without batting an eyelid and quickly collapses in on its own weight, such as it is. Finale time is the usual running around in the dark, cursing and swearing.
What has left me in the dark, cursing and swearing, is why I paid $4 for this garbage. If I crowd-sourced my own project, you'd get change out of $4, no matter how many subscribers I had. Also, I wouldn't make you read subtitles to lend my film credibility.",1436572800,3,1066,4.36180904522613
7011000,1,B00TJ57TBA,"I enjoy a toothy misogynistic Ukrainian cannibal as much as the next gal, so imagine my disappointment as I discovered this was just another shaky-cam-running-aimlessly-and-shrieking flick. Sigh. Waste of a good premise.",1436400000,5,220,5.90625
7011001,4,B00TJ57TBA,"Surprisingly very well done found footage film shot in Europe with some serious Hollywod weight behind it. Good story based in facr, great talent and kept me interested throughout. The ending was a bit of a let down but not enough to make me dislike the rest of the movie.",1436400000,,272,4.46
8701995,2,B00TJ57TBA,"A waste of money on this FF movie. It started out pretty good , but after the first 10-15 minutes it went downhill from there. Bad acting, a lot of screaming, yelling and fighting with the Americans supposedly making a documentary about Ukraine's historical siege under Stalin when all the citizens were forced to starve and then resorted to cannibalism. The American students were very immature, unprofessional and dissed any of the help they were receiving which of course didn't fare well for them. The rest of the film consisted of shaky and bouncing camera footage with lights going on and off and screaming and yelling (at each other mostly) and running around in the deep woods at night. I didn't really care for it at all. I am not happy that I actually paid to rent it.",1449964800,,778,4.644927536231884
8701996,5,B00TJ57TBA,Keeps you pulled along in the madness til the very end. and then you realize how bad things really are. Good twist on what could have been another 'found footage' movie that kept it above the rest.,1449014400,,197,4.351351351351352
8701997,1,B00TJ57TBA,This movie was terrible especially if you're looking for a good scary movie.  Acting is not good and is just a long boring movie. I don't recommend seeing it.  You would be better off watching a good old classic - The Ring,1446768000,,222,4.261904761904762
8701998,2,B00TJ57TBA,"Pretty bad and cheesy but we knew that when we watched it so, for a bad movie it was ok. Lol.",1445299200,,93,3.4761904761904763
8701999,2,B00TJ57TBA,Wasn't too impressed. Found footage type scenario. Interesting historical basis however.,1444867200,,88,7.090909090909091
8702000,3,B00TJ57TBA,I would have thought that this movie would have been much more thrilling but it was not.  I did enjoy it a bit but I don't think I could watch it again.,1440547200,2,152,3.75
8702001,3,B00TJ57TBA,"Decent found footage horror... gets pretty lame by the end, but worth a rental for FF fans.",1439510400,,91,4.411764705882353
8702002,5,B00TJ57TBA,"Loved this movie! Made me scream out loud which I don't do! The fact that they intertwined  both truth and fiction made it so much better for me. I love a good horror movie and this one reminds me of blair witch, so get ready for a little shakiness! Great story, good scary fun!",1437955200,,278,4.148148148148148
8702003,1,B00TJ57TBA,"Found footage horror can be entertaining when it's well done, but this isn't. It's very forrmula driven. You always know what's coming next. There is no originality here. I will say one good thing, though, which is that the acting was professional. Very believable. It's the director that was just not up to the job of this film.",1437955200,,329,4.689655172413793
8702004,5,B00TJ57TBA,Started out slow but became very engrossing. The setting really boosted the 'creepy' factor. Kudos to the actors all of them did really believable work. My only complaint? They could have made a movie about Chickatelo (sp) or left him out completely. Seemed kind of forced to bring him in. besides the cannibalism under Stalin was horrifying in and of itself. That being said I give it 5 stars,1437696000,,393,4.7101449275362315
