7833345,3,6302999022,"This is not a workout dvd, but it does give a nice, easy, simple demonstration of the basic stretching exercsisees before, basic punching, kicks, blocks, stances, etc. It also shows some free form gentle fighting between the 1 girl & 2 guys demonstrating in a basic wooden large room with a guy annoucing off camera to the student what to demonstrate & a narrator telling you the name & what is it used for.
Easy to watch, unfortunately they only demonstrate it 1-2x.",1180915200,2,467,4.63855421686747
7833346,5,6302999022,"When I was a beginner in karate I often felt lost in class.  This video is  an excellent backup to training in the dojo.  The tape is clear and easy to  understand.  Furthermore, demonstrations are slow, easy to follow and  explained.",965260800,7,234,4.585365853658536
7833347,5,6302999022,"I like this video because Chris Thompson's movements are fluid and there is some internal quality.  Many Karate practitioners are stiff and awkward.  This video shows basic exercise training, punching, blocking, sparring,  stance training, free fighting and five basic kata.  Also a short history  of Karate.  It is a great introduction to Karate.",956016000,12,347,5.452830188679245
