507658,4,6302760089,"This great comedy is about two modern-day hard-luck cowboys who are always getting into a bind, and when they do, their boss is always there to bail them out of their trouble ... and into his debt (hence the name ""Rounders""). As a result, they always owe him money, and to pay him back, they have to do the jobs no one else will. Particularly funny are the scenes with the two air-head women they encounter toward the end.

I received this DVD as a gift and learned to my disappointment that it is not in the original wide-screen aspect ratio but has been reformatted to fit a standard TV screen, hence my downgrade to 4 stars. So beware you will not get the full picture.",1131840000,,672,4.333333333333333

Video Release Date: June 30, 1993

Cast:

Glenn Ford

Henry Fonda

Chill Wills

This is a wonderful comedy about two old cowboys (Fonda and Ford) who whoop off their money in town, and then are forced by necessity to go back to work for the winter working for a niggardly rancher (Chill Wills), 'topping off' (breaking) wild cayuses and rounding up wild cattle.  Then, in the Spring, the cycle is repeated with the same result.

On the ranch there is as a roan horse that is strongly reminiscent of the strawberry roan of Marty Robbins' song, which the boys view with a love/hate relationship.  They end up owning him, in lieu of payment for some of their work.

The two meet two airheaded girls, with predictable results, and the story develops from there.

I found the movie entertaining, hilarious, and I hope you do too.

507661,4,6302760089,"Henry Fonda and Glenn Ford co-star as a pair of almost-over-the-hill cowpunchers whose love of the free life, and plain lack of horse sense, have kept them pinned to the same lousy job year after years, and also from settling down with any of the gals that moon over them when they come down from the hills long enough to spend their dough.  These guys are loveable foul-ups, roustabouts who haven't quite figured out how to get ahead, but sure like doing things the hard way.  Plenty of light comedy (including some of the most charming early '60s sexist jokes you're ever likely to see) and a funny love-hate relationship between Ford and the one horse he simply cannot break.  It's nice to see Ford and Fonda play characters who just ain't that bright, each in their own typical understated style.  Cute film -- recommended!",1052611200,15,827,4.682758620689655
507662,5,6302760089,"The inspired, superb teaming of Glenn Ford and Henry Fonda help raise this laid back film from almost certain obscurity.  Based on the novel by Max Evans 'The Rounders' emerged as a sleeper hit when released in '65 and after all this time continues to defy the odds and remain a real audience pleaser today.  Told with all too rare simplicity and filmed on alternately stark locations and colorful vistas, screenwriter and director Burt Kennedy crafts another one of his long series of winning films.  Ford and Fonda play the aging bronc-busters (or 'cowboys with their brains kicked out' as Ford says) Ben Jones and Howdy Lewis just trying to earn enough money for a boat so they can live on the ocean...or a desert isle...or...well anywhere ""where there ain't no grass and there ain't no horses!"" as Ben firmly explains it to Howdy.  Two factors stand in the way of their dreams: working for a stingy rancher who tries to pinch the duo for what he can and their own penchant for wasting every dime they earn in a matter of days when they make the annual journey into Sedona.
As the movie opens it is early autumn; Ben and Howdy reluctantly accept work from Jim Ed Love, a rancher they both love to hate.  Part of their duties includes attempting to tame a furious and ornery young mustang properly named ""Ol' Fooler"".  The horse quickly becomes their arch nemesis as it continually defies their attempts at bronc-busting; wily old veterans they refuse to be done-in by the stubborn animal and will eventually talk Love into letting them keep it as part of their pay.  Ben and Howdy brainstorm that they can make a mint and leave their hard-luck days behind at the annual rodeo in Sedona by betting that no one can ride their varmint of a horse for longer than eight seconds.  The plan goes fairly well but they encounter an unexpected twist of events that threatens to ruin the guys' enterprise and sink their dreams fast.
It shouldn't amount to much - but it does.  One of the very best supporting casts ever assembled helps out tremendously providing endless appeal and colorful characterizations.  Chill Wills, Edgar Buchanan, and both Kathleen & Joan Freeman show up as the story progresses and have fairly expanded roles.  Barton MacLane, Denver Pyle and Doodles Weaver appear in cameo roles that seem tailored perfectly to their talents.  An uncredited Warren Oates plays a bumbling gun-crazy wrangler that runs afoul of Jones and Lewis.  The best surprise of all though is Sue Ann Langdon and Hope Holiday as two attractive and voluptuous ladies that Ben and Howdy happen upon when they make the late spring journey into Sedona.  This sequence of the film supplies us with it's funniest and most memorable moments.
Made at a time when films could be both sparse of activity and routinely but unabashedly sentimental 'The Rounders' is living proof that comedies don't have to be big, bold and brassy to be enjoyed.  For a refreshing change of pace and an opportunity to see Ford and Fonda at their most likeable I heartily recommend you set aside some time for this flick.",1045958400,46,3080,4.741573033707865
507663,5,6302760089,"THE ROUNDERS is a not much of a movie plot.  It's just a good movie.  Unlike those wonderful B Westerns from the 1930s, these cowboys--Glenn Ford and Henry Fonda--got to drink hard ""hotch"" and also kiss the girls as well as the horse. It is a film that defines great countryside, solid friendship, how dreams keep yuh going, how great a movie can be without much of a plot, and how yuh learn to love your enemy.  In this case, the enemy is that cagey Roan roping, bucking horse that slo-witted Ford tried his dangdest to break and couldn't.  He wants to run down the horse with a pickup, shoot it,send it to the glue factory [soap product in this case] or sell it to some sucker willing to buy it.  In the end bronco-busters Ford and Fonda don't bust the cantankerous Roan, but they prove that you can make an endearing story into a movie without getting maudlin about it.

What do you call a cowboy with his brains kicked out, a bronco rider. Ben Jones and Howdy Lewis, heaven help them, are bronc riders. Glenn Ford and Henry Fonda portray a pair who is cowboy enough to do just about any job, except for the one at hand. That job: Saddle a clever, ornery, blaze-faced horse named Old Fooler and makes him as gentle as a milk-pen calf, which can't be done and that gets the cowpokes to thinking. Maybe they can make a dollar or two by wagering that no one at the rodeo can stay atop him either. Place your bets as filmmaker Burt Kennedy matches the warmth of his two stars with an unadorned ease that makes this modern Western as welcome as a get-together with old friends at a Sunday social. THE ROUNDERS is a light-hearted 1965 western film directed by Burt Kennedy. It is based on the 1960 novel of the same name by Max Evans.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Once upon a time films like THE ROUNDERS [1965] would have been classified by movie industry insiders as a ""sleeper."" In other words, a film that had no expectations attached to it but surprised everyone by being an unheralded little gem. Unfortunately, studios rarely knew how to market these films and as a result, they got stuck on the bottom of double bills with negligible companion features. THE ROUNDERS is a perfect example of this. Nevertheless, it is now regarded as one of Henry Fonda's most popular films from the 1960s era.

The premise is simple but slightly cockeyed. Two aging cowpokes Ben Jones [Glenn Ford] and Marion 'Howdy' Lewis [Henry Fonda] hit on a scheme to get rich taming wild broncos and then retire to Tahiti with their savings. Never mind that they are hopeless at saving money, squander every penny on loose women and booze, and aren't even very good at picking champion horses. Henry Fonda and Glenn Ford play the none-too-bright cowhands in question and part of the film's pleasure comes in watching these two pros have fun with these bewildered characters as things go from bad to worse, especially when you see Glenn Ford at the start of the film falls off the bucking bronco horse at regular intervals and each time you wince as he lands hard on the ground. For the record, a rounder is a wastrel or dissolute person but you won't see a more whimsical treatment anywhere of two complete losers of the actors Henry Fonda and Glenn Ford.

Vince Moore [Edgar Buchanan] excels as a moonshiner with, ahem, eligible daughters. Sometimes the comedy gets a bit low, especially when Henry Fonda and Glenn Ford meet up with some seriously dumb blondes, which of course would not be allowed these days. One thing we can also say: as a dancer, Glenn Ford is not at all a good twister. Henry Fonda doesnt even try, much wiser. There is a nod to The Duke [John Wayne] when Henry Fonda is asked the origin of his name Howdy, and John Wayne says he was christened Marion so he changed it to something more Western.

It is an amusing little film and well worth the occasional watch. Glenn Ford and Henry Fonda were both supreme Westerners and here they are frankly great as cowboys going nowhere. There is rather a poignant part where Glenn Ford tells his girl that he might settle down one day, and as he is 50 years old, by just looking at him in this film, we realise that is never going to happen. On top of all that, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer mishandled it badly and released it on a double bill with some rubbishy college comedy. It was only later that it became the favourite of aficionados that it is today.

THE ROUNDERS was filmed on location in the Coconino Forest in Arizona and was produced by Richard E. Lyons who was also responsible for another excellent western in an entirely different vein a few years earlier, the film Ride the High Country, and was directed by Sam Peckinpah. That film also suffered the same fate as THE ROUNDERS, because it was buried in double bill at drive-ins and second-run theatres because the studio brass at M-G-M didn't know what to do with it.

Off-screen, during the making of THE ROUNDERS, Henry Fonda and his son Peter Fonda were going through a very turbulent time in their relationship, something attributed by the counterculture movements of the sixties. In the book The Fondas: A Hollywood Dynasty (G. P. Putnam's Sons), author Peter Collier relates an incident that happened on the set of THE ROUNDERS, ""When Peter Fonda went to the Arizona location of THE ROUNDERS, to visit the son of Henry Fonda's co-star Glenn Ford, he discovered that the cast was planning a surprise birthday party for his father. When he was not invited, he sent Henry Fonda a nasty and illogical note of blame, and he would have left in a huff had the director Burt Kennedy, did not stop him and pointed out the obvious: Since it was a surprise party, Henry Fonda could not have been the one who excluded him.""

The Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer release is solidly flavoured throughout with excellent, unobtrusive Metrocolor photography and some wonderfully persuasive dialogue. It also bucks a pretentious scenario, especially with the musical background that is pure Hollywood. And there are such contrivances, as the heroes' droll dalliance with two curvy showgirls, but also see them both with a slightly drawn-out and wedged between the splashy rodeo finales that almost tilt the entire film off balance. Still, THE ROUNDERS, is a good all-round small Western genre, but far from perfect but beautifully personified by two wise, winning veteran actors.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Warner Archive Collection brings you this cowboy film in a 1080p [Metrocolor] and also in a 2.35:1 [Anamorphic Panavision] aspect ratio, that really shows of the awesome landscape of Arizona's Coconino National Forest and especially the equally spectacular cinematography by Paul Vogel, A.S.C. (Director of Photography), which is on par with the landscape you would see in a John Ford film. Warner Archive Collection have recently manufactured interpositive and was scanned at 2K by Warner's Motion Picture Imaging facility, followed by necessary colour-correction and clean-up. Sharpness and detail are excellent in close-ups and medium shots, but they fall off slightly in many long shots, which probably reflect its limitations of the source. But because it is in Metrocolor [poor mans Technicolor] it seems to give off a strange palette contrasts that is not too rich and the earth tones with a bright blue sky is not too blue. But stand out colour is the blacks that are solid, and the film's grain patterns are well-resolved and free of any digital manipulation. Despite this slight down grading of the colours, it is still a good effort, but I have seen Metrocolor in other films that were much nearer to Technicolor standard.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Warner Archive Collection brings you a nice and pleasant 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio experience that has been taken from the original magnetic master, cleaned up of any age-related interference or distortion, to give you a moderate audio experience, and when the guns go off, it is all very solid sound. The emphasis of this film is of course the dialogue, which is clear and sonic rendered, and on the jaunty music film score by Jeff Alexander, which plays with good fidelity and acceptable dynamic range. So all in all a good effort all round.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Theatrical Trailer [1965] [1080p] [2.35:1] [2:43] This is the Original Theatrical trailer for the film THE ROUNDERS, and luckily this trailer shows off its full potential and the announcer informs us that this film is for ""The New West."" It also informs us on the screen with the words Nowadays its the gals who . . . make the West WILD! And nobody knows it better than Glenn Ford and Henry Fonda.

Finally, THE ROUNDERS is where we find two ageing bronc-busters cowboys who try to make their meagre money by breaking in wild horses. They dream of better days and possibly retiring to some island paradise, but they never put any money in the bank because they spend it all on booze and girls. They think their no-dough days are done until they acquire a wild drunkard horse which they enter in a bucking bronco contest and no one can ride the wild, hiccupping nag. This is a delightful light-hearted Western in which Glenn Ford and Henry Fonda shine as two down-on-their-luck rodeo riders, who are none too bright cowboys who always end up working for the sharp rancher Chill Wills. Ben Jones [Glenn Ford] says, It comes to me that we aint the smartest cowboys ever lived and Marion 'Howdy' Lewis [Henry Fonda] replies, You could say that. This is a pretty funny 1960s western-style comedy. Highly Recommended!

The running gag throughout the movie is what Glenn Ford wants to do to one particular horse that won't be tamed (shoot it, run it over with a truck, turn it into glue or soap).  Two-thirds of the way through the movie Fonda and Ford meet two blonde airheads.  They go for a swim near sundown then get chased by the police.  That's over quickly.  Then there's a silly barroom brawl that mercifully doesn't last too long.  Best part: the scenery.  I really like Glenn Ford in some other movies but this one is a bust.

a funny movie, this is one of my favorites of all times.  Teaming Henry Fonda & Glenn Ford was brilliant for this movie.

As a horse breeder I always avoided Red Roans as much of what you see in this movie can be true with some of the red roans.
Even as a child I avoided riding them as tales from the old cowboys were pretty much like what you see in this movie.

The antics they used with this horse are hilarious.  Any cowboy at heart will love this one.  Definite 5 stars!!",1432166400,3,607,4.101694915254237

Warner Brothers, MGM and Universal are all using these cheap cases to sell you their archived classics.

When you open the case you're immediately hit by a strong, sweet, pungent and (more than likely) brain damaging odor.  Then, after you set the movie aside for a week or more, the case begins to warp and expand opening up and releasing that brain-cell killing odor into your home.  Luckily, I had some extra old empty DVD cases lying around so I was able to replace it.

507989,5,6302760089,"I'm not very big on Westerns, but this is a most unusual one as this takes place during the early sixties and is a comedy to boot, starring two first rate actors, Glen Ford and Henry Fonda. as Ben and Howdy, two itinerant cowboys working for a persuasive rancher named Jim Ed Love. During their latest job of working out a string of broncs, they discover one that definitely has a mind of its own as it resists practically every effort to tame it. In fact, he becomes the one animal that exasperates Ben to no end and proves to be a thorn in his side, no matter what he does. He traded him for whisky only to have the man come and demand his whisky back after the horse  literally tore up his farm. Another attempt to get rid of him only saw the horse return on its own bearing a pair of boots still stuck to the rope stirrups by the spurs. And it isn't just the horse that provides the comedy as Ben and Howdy find two strippers with a car broken down and what happens when they try their hands at a bit of romance only to end up trying to help them out when they lose their clothing after a night of skinny dipping, thanks again to a mischievous horse. If this isn't a classic, it should be. Chill Wills, Edgar Buchanan, Denver Pyle round out some of the cast, and of course, there is that horse....................",1396483200,4,1317,4.226190476190476

This is a damn good movie! I've seen Henry Fonda & Glenn Ford in tons of movies but I don't think I'd ever laughed so hard and enjoyed them so much as I had in The Rounders. They're portrayal of burned-out ol' cowhands locked in a life pattern is spot on with too many actual characters I've grown up with here in Wyoming. Despite being made in the 60's it is remarkable how well it holds up 50 years later. Glenn Ford's Hate/love relationship with that truly evil horse is one of the funniest things ever. I laugh out loud just thinking about it.

Since seeing it last summer I picked up several copies to give out at Christmas and our copy gets a spin at least once a week and it just never gets old. This is one of the few movies I try to get everyone I know to watch, because unfortunately they really don't make em' like that anymore.",1361491200,4,1107,4.096774193548387

508137,5,6302760089,"I had seen this movie years ago having the VCR version of it, I was eager to get the DVD. It is a fun movie.

It takes place in the late 50's  two Arizona cowboys work for a rancher breaking horses. He makes a deal with them to take a rank roan. The story is about all the trouble they get into with this horse trying to get rid of him.

This movie is a delight for anyone who loves horses, the west and a good fun movie!! Too bad these two guys aren't around to make their western's anymore. I really miss them!!",1358035200,2,513,3.9134615384615383
508138,4,6302760089,I first saw this movie in 1964 and enjoyed it very much. At that time we seemed to be able to enjoy more simple things. We seemed to be less sophisticated. We did not require as many explicit vulgar terms to express feelings and actions as now. Everything is in your face. I enjoyed it again but times and society has changed and when you are constantly exposed to situations and language of the present it changes your appreciation for routine things.,1357084800,2,452,4.524390243902439

508151,5,6302760089,"I purchased this DVD after rewatching it on the Encore Western channel. I had watched parts of the movie years before and enjoyed it, but my parents had never seen it. So, I ordered it as the horse reminded us of several of the horses we had many years ago.
As I thought, the movie was a hit, gathering laughs from both parents and myself. Both parents enjoyed the movie so much that both stayed up until nearly ten thirty at night to watch the whole movie. It was a refreshing change of pace from many of the modern movies where more gunplay and swearing would probably be included just as the course of normal events, but we enjoyed the movie as it was. As it stands, I think we have a movie that will be enjoyed by others in the family and shared as needed.

508155,5,6302760089,"GREAT movie.  Has been one of my favorites for a long time.  Nice to have a ""real"" copy now.  This movie is from 1964 so cussing and nudity is implied but not allowed.  Which leads to an interesting fact.  In the movie Henry & Glenn help two girls, Sue Ane Langdon and Hope Holiday, who have car trouble.  After a late night swim they are chased away by the game warden and the girls end up with no clothes.  Glenn gets them two aprons from the coffe shop to wear.  But the backside is not there.  As they twirl to show their new outfits, in the oginal 1964 version, there is a big CENSORED across their bottoms.  Nowadays when it shows on TV the censored is not there and you get to see their backside.  THIS is the original version.

I highly recommend this movie as a fun - no real plot - movie with some very good actors!!!",1325462400,,827,4.132075471698113
508156,5,6302760089,"I first caught this old movie on cable years ago and was surprised how funny it was. Sadly since then, despite having hundreds of channels to surf through, it has been hard to find it playing anywhere again. So I was thrilled to see it available now on DVD. Henry Fonda and Glenn Ford are at the top of their game and hilarious in this as two hard working yet perpetually broke cowboys. One reason they can't get ahead is the cheapskate they work for Jim Ed Love, played by the great character actor Chill Wills. The scenes involving an ornery roan horse that is virtually unbreakable are funny as hell. Just a simple, funny, character driven movie of the sort you rarely see made anymore; at least not with actors of this caliber. Highly recommend.",1311552000,,749,4.514705882352941
508157,5,6302760089,The Rounders is the movie for every cowboy and want-to-be cowboy.  Everywhere I go in West Texas and New Mexico the bronc riders and day riders all talk of the great Glenn Ford/Henry Fonda epic of the 1960's.  These are true to life bronc riders and their tales of life during one year of trying every event to break the mold they have been following in the $7.00 a bronc world only to fine its a world they were made for and love.  This gives the viewer a true to life view of a world few know about and many of us would not change even if we could.,1303862400,,550,4.027522935779817

As for the film itself, it is mainly destined for North American audiences - I guess taming wild horses mustn't be a popular sport outside the US - but what makes this movie a little gem is the presence of two Hollywood legends at their best.

508174,5,6302760089,"Finally .... 'The Rounders', starring Glenn Ford and Henry Fonda, is out on DVD.

This is a gentle, funny, movie. The plot is simple and the characters endearing.

Two middle-aged cowboys who, either by intent or accident, seem locked into a life outdoors of hard work and not much money. The scenery is beautiful and their pickup is ancient.

When I was a kid growing up in central Texas there was a popular cartoonist, Ace Reid (in Kerrville), who drew 'Cow Pokes'. It was about some lean ranch people living on the edge of subsistence. A lot of banks would feature 'Cow Pokes' on their give-away calendars each year. 'The Rounders' portrays a lifestyle very similar to 'Cow Pokes' with much the same humor based on people eking out a living from a dry land.

508177,4,6302760089,"This amiable modern Western benefits enormously from the casting of the great genre veterans Henry Fonda and Glenn Ford as two veteran cowboys ,forever on the verge of abandoning their nomadic lifestyle and settling down ,but never quite making it. The movie revolves around their attempts to tame an especially recalitrant bronco named Ol Fooler-who it is suggested is a little like the two men in being stubborn ,hard to tame and determined to go his own way but likeable and  who eventually will be coerced back into the mainstream

There is not a tightly constructed plot as such ,more a series of incidents heavy on the humour which -be aware ,is often slightly risque (there is a shot of bare bottoms for example which may bother the more prudish ).

Ford and Fonda are wonderful as you might expect from two actors who always looked at home in the saddle and they bring  authority and unforced pathos to the roles .Sue Ann Langdon and Hope Holliday as the two women who waylay them along the road ,are equally fine and Burt Kennedy directs with assurance and a relaxed authority .The photography is warm and mellow -just like the rest of this always funny ,often tender and frequently hilarious gem of a movie",1202515200,,1216,4.694835680751174
