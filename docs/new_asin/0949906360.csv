Dr. Sarfati has a PhD in Chemistry and while things are clearly explained, you may have to watch it more than once to fully absorb some of the information. The presenter is engaging enough to keep your interest.

Overall, I would say that unless you have a built in bias towards the topic, it will likely shed new light on the issue based on recent scientific discoveries within the inner workings of the cell. Unless evolutionists can empirically demonstrate how programmed, digital information and the systems of transcription and translation can arise by themselves within the cell to make use of the digital programs the information presented in this DVD poses a strong, empirically based challenge to that claim.",1387152000,6,839,5.169117647058823
