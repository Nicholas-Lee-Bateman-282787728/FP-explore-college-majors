Near the beginning, the work says Celts sometimes fought nude, possibly for spiritual reasons.  Then they show a drawing of a man naked, but painted Smurfy blue, with his meat covered.  Then the subject never comes up again.  You see or experience more war-based nudity in ""Braveheart.""  This is just about the Celts.  Much of the work focuses on the differences between the Romans and the Celts.  The Romans loved cities; the Celts preferred rural villages.  Rome was more united, but Celts lived in small duches, far flung but not united in any way.  The Romans thought Celtic art was primitive or silly, but the experts say Celtic art was just more abstract.  The Celts may have had gods that were less human-appearing.  We hear about greats like Vercingetorix and Boudicca.  One expert said Gaelic is the closest language to what the Celts spoke, but this work didn't see centered on the Emerald Isle in the slightest.  Folk who like drinking spirits may love when it's mentioned twice that Celts like getting plastered when drinking alcohol.  I'm guessing people of Celtic ancestry would really get a kick out of this program.",1427932800,,1233,4.8
