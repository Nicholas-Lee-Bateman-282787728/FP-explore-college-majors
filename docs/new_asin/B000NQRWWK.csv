This DVD finally shows how to get them right. Considering there is very little video material on Alias tutorials I must recommend this one to every alias user. I wish Dustin Brown will release another DVD on advanced modeling techniques in Studio Tools, it's badly needed. great work.",1219190400,,470,5.28
8181021,5,B000NQRWWK,"With the depth of Alias software, there is always some new tweak or trick to learn.  This DVD is an absolute must if just learning to utilize alias, and - if for a more experienced user like myself - a great tool for clarifying some adjustments I never quite understood and learning quite a bit extra as well.  Much of the set-up basics were, well, basic, but then the author starts to get into the areas I never quite understood for both rendering globals and shader adjustments.  Far beyond the offerings direct from Alias, this is the bag of tricks I needed to bring my presentations to the next level - and cut down some rendering time!",1193011200,,640,4.452991452991453
