4080620,4,B0037A4IL2,"I have been a long time follower of Christian Contemporary, Rock, Metal, etc.  I was around when DC Talk broke up, and Kevin Max kind of went out on his own.  I remember buying his first solo cd and saying to myself ""this guy has lost his edge and his ability to minister"".  It was one of the craziest cds that I had ever bought, and this is saying alot since I have over 500 to 600 of them.  I don't know if you all remember but when DC Talk broke up alot of the blame fell on Kevin Max.  Rumors of him drinking and rumors of him wanting more spotlight were the common stories going around as to why DC Talk broke up.  I also have spent alot of time with various Christian bands, and they all told me that Kevin Max basically gave up his faith.  This is why I watched this movie.  I wanted to see why Kevin Max was in the same movie as Jeff Deyo.  Jeff Deyo (as far as I know) as had a great track record in his solo career and also as the lead singer of Sonicflood.  So I wanted to see why these two teamed up for the movie.

Now to the movie, Kevin Max plays the role of a Christian singer who is backsliding (I know some people don't like that term).  He would go on stage and sing songs which possibly could have been about Jesus (the movie makes it clear that you don't know because Jesus's name is not mentioned), and after the concert, he would be out drinking, cheating on his wife, etc.  Personally, I wondered if Kevin Max did not play this role so well because he lived the role.  I was really pleased with Kevin Max's performance.  I think that he showed that the road to redemption is rough, and sometimes Christians are the hardest people to get forgiveness from.  Also, this movie showed that once you do straighten your life out that not everything is back to being rosie.  It is a process, and you have to rebuild a life with trust from the very beginning up.  Honestly if all the rumors were true about Kevin Max, I hope he has really found his way back to true redemption.

Now to the music, the majority of the music was catchy for a younger crowd.  My parents (who are in their 50's) hated the music.  Sometimes there were places in the movie where music was played that I believe was really not necessary.  I would have liked to have heard stronger Christian lyrics; however, I understand alot of the music in the movie was to show a straying from this.  One song that I really did not like though was carry on thy wayward son.  I really felt Kevin Max butchered this song.  I feel that the best version of this song was done by a girl christian rock group called Rachel Rachel.  They rocked that song.

Would I recommend this film?  I would definitely recommend it to people under about 35.  Anyone over that, might really be irritated by the music.

I wish the ending would have been a little more in depth; however, I understand that they were trying to make it more realistic.  In real life, not everything is wrapped up nicely.  This is about all I have to say about this movie.  God bless.",1274572800,10,3018,4.211169284467714
4080621,5,B0037A4IL2,"I agree with another reviewer , this is a very good movie. Also I agree with his assement of the acting skills of Kerry Livgren and Kevin Max. Although he is not in front of the camera as much as Kevin Max, Kerry Livgren shows he can work right up with the best of them. The story is right on the mark as well. I wish though there could have been more in the way of music(maybe even Kerry Livgren playing). By the way the monster group Kansas' DVD "" Know Place Like Home "" is awesome. Again while Kerry is not onstage as much as I would like it is a very well recorded DVD.

I also agree that this is an awesome movie for smaller groups of youth or even adults as a discussion starter/message. I love how the central message is presented through the life of a rock star or used to be rock star. But I think the thing that I like most about the movie is the ending.(SPOILER ALERT)I how while he is trying to get his life back it probably be a long process and one that is greatly intouch with the way real life is.",1270080000,4,1013,4.014851485148514
4080622,4,B0037A4IL2,"""The Imposter"" is better than most Christian produced films.  On a whole, it's pretty well written, with excellent performances by Kerry Livgren and Kevin Max, who have both proved themselves great rockers and successful performers in the real world.  The film offers great insight into the practical teaching of the prodigal son, with the character of Frank presenting one of the best examples of the hypocritical fundamentalist who literally sings a song in church about forgiveness, grace, and accepting the repentant sinner while completely doing the opposite when Johnny C comes back as the proverbial prodigal (later in the *same* scene!).  Johnny C's wife is willing to allow him the opportunity to accept acceptance and forgiveness, even if their marriage still fails as a consequence of his earlier sins.  So why Frank, who espouses the Gospel message through his music, would hold a bigger grudge than his sister, who was the recipient/victim of the Johnny C's transgressions, creates a great opportunity for discussion about judging others, and the motives behind it.  I've personally been burned by more Franks in the world than Johnny C's, and sadly, there are Franks in every church pushing people away from God...

The film's biggest weaknesses are Tom Wright's crazy homeless man, who is the ""Jar Jar Binks"" of the film, and the writer's need to state and remind the audience multiple times through Johnny C's narration that this film is not following the formula that most Christian films have used for years.  Firstly, there's no need to sell that point because we're *already* watching it.  Secondly, the constant reminders that we should not expect the usual treatment on the subject basically told us what was going to happen, thus robbing the film of its suspense.  Lastly, the best stories are the ones that show rather than tell.  If you want this film to be different from the typical Christian movie, then make it different than the typical Christian movie and let the movie's treatment, characters, and story speak for itself rather than insulting the audience's intelligence by telling us just in case we didn't notice.  Believe me, most of us Christians who have suffered through Christian produced movies will notice!

The film is well done, and it's a great opportunity for many to revisit Kerry Livgren's genius and a terrific chance for others to be introduced to Kevin Max's music.  I think Kevin's performance is very good, but I think it's unfortunate that this film wasn't made ten years earlier when Kevin was a little younger for this role.  It's not ""Citizen Kane,"" but it's not the ""Omega Code"" or ""Left Behind"" either!  I recommend it for personal viewing or for use in small group discussions.",1268179200,14,2736,5.022123893805309
4080623,4,B0037A4IL2,"Just when you think you've hit bottom, sometimes you find the bottom is a little deeper. You keep expecting that moment when everything comes together in a feel good movie. Don't expect it here. Here you get a more realistic look at the struggle with addiction and sin which are not always so easily overcome. Even at the end of the movie there are no promises, and no ""they all lived happily ever after"". That is what makes this film worth watching. It is a faith based film, it is just that in real life sometimes change doesn't come easy. While others seem to have taken offense at the idea, I say good for the makers of this film not to make the average run of the mill everything always comes up sunshine, roses, and lollipops movie. Because in real life, sometimes they don't.",1376611200,,782,4.4375
4080624,2,B0037A4IL2,I was very disappointed in this DVD and even though I watched it to the end I cannot recommend to others.,1368057600,,105,4.0476190476190474
4080625,1,B0037A4IL2,"I am a huge supporter of Christian and family films however this one was so bad, we shut it off before it was halfway done.

The acting was terrible and so cheesy, we just couldn't take it anymore.

Do not waste your money buying this - find it at a local library and watch it for free if it interests you that much.",1367280000,,316,4.0
4080626,3,B0037A4IL2,I enjoyed this film. It is a low budget project and the acting is a bit predictable but the story line is good.,1359244800,,111,3.869565217391304
4080627,4,B0037A4IL2,"I agree with what the other reviewers stated. I was impressed by the fact that this movie doesn't have your typical Christian film ending. Being a Christian is not an automatic ""wonderful life"" card. We all have to deal with the after effects of decisions we made before we were saved. We also know that after we are saved there are consequences when we sin. It was great to watch a film that didn't ""sugar coat"" that aspect.

My teenage boys are in a Christian rock band. They said that they got a glimpse of how easily you can go from all about God to all about yourself. It really made them think about keeping their motives and lyrics in check.

I would highly recommend this movie to teens and adults alike. It is a great example of the advancements in Christian film making.",1298592000,2,780,4.409722222222222
4080628,4,B0037A4IL2,"This was a great movie with a great cast. I think Kevin Max was amazing in this story. He also hit it right on the head with the struggles that christians have to face,no dancing around the subject.",1294704000,2,198,4.2368421052631575
4080629,3,B0037A4IL2,"What do you get when you get musicians as actors of a movie? Great music and average acting!

The movie talks about the lead singer of a popular Christian band who lives a double life. His wife decides to leave him, and his life crashes out without and money to live on. He goes through a phase of being humbled, and the movie has an open ending, which I like, and without them concluding what happened or try to make things all dandy and nice.

This is better than a lot of Christian movies I've watched, and I would recommend this based on the message it communicates.",1291852800,,570,4.317757009345795
4080630,3,B0037A4IL2,"The DVD came within a few days in new condition and I would order again from the same. As far as the movie, it has a good idea for a movie but the script falls short. There was some good ""spots"" but lackluster as a whole. Amazing, I really don't have anything bad to say about the acting. Everyone really fitted the parts well. I feel that the movie left the Lord Jesus completely out, which is exactly what contemporary christian music does best.",1279411200,,447,4.333333333333333
4080631,1,B0037A4IL2,"I bought this movie for my father for Father's Day. He watched it, but did not really enjoy it. He liked the music, but the story was not well-shaped. Really, this is not worth the money.",1278374400,,187,4.222222222222222
4080632,5,B0037A4IL2,especially good for those who aren't looking for a movie that is like all the others about Christianity.  This movie is accurate but sometimes painful.,1275091200,2,151,5.04
8390388,5,B0037A4IL2,"Kevin Max of DC Talk and 12, almost 13, solo albums; does as he does everything, all or nothing. Great job for his 1 and only starring acting roll. Heart warming, spiritual pick yourself up from the bootstraps movie.  He is the singer of our time and a damn good actor to boot. Needs to do more acting.",1515456000,,302,4.206896551724138
8390389,4,B0037A4IL2,"The movie is decent.  Buy it to watch it once.  But the music in bonus section - buy it to listen to it many times.  In particular, ""Carry On My Wayward Son"" played by the musician from KANSAS who wrote it (and stars in the move) and sung by KEVIN MAX from DCTalk (who also stars in the move).  One of the other commenters said the music made the movie worth watching.  It was pretty good - but when I hit the BONUS SECTION and started this song - WOW!  Turn up the volume and enjoy it in a brand new way!",1508284800,,505,3.9019607843137254
8390390,3,B0037A4IL2,"I liked the story.  The acting was subpar, much like many Christian films.  This movie doesn't pretend to be A-list though and it's good for what it is.  What I REALLY liked, being a pastor, was it did not go the  fairy-tale endings of movies like Facing the Giants where everything ends perfectly for the Christian star of the movie.  Let's be honest, things don't always work out the way we want.

SPOILER ALERT-  This movie shows that sometimes God's will isn't what we thought it would be and it doesn't all end up rosey for the main character, but he's okay with that he still follows the Lord.",1468627200,,599,4.440366972477064

8390392,1,B0037A4IL2,The most of the acting in this film is so unbelievable that it does not even deserve to reviewed. It was painful to watch. Why do Christian movies have to be poorly done?,1431129600,,170,4.181818181818182
8390393,4,B0037A4IL2,"I loved the way he narrated some parts, of course Kevin's singing is perfect.  Storyline true to life.",1419033600,,102,4.666666666666667

8390396,5,B0037A4IL2,My family really enjoyed this movie. It really brings to life the issues that fame(or popularity)can produce in one's life if we lose our focus on God. Imposter teaches a valuable lesson in humility and being real.,1379376000,,214,4.8108108108108105
