4655281,5,B005D0TERW,"Of all the Ed Sullivan DVDs released in the past few years, this is probably the best of them.  Its hard to argue with over 2 hours of live Motown performances, and under $20 too.  And this is quality stuff, the picture is sharp and the audio is crisp and clear, which considering the age of the video is mighty impressive.  All of the songs that the Jackson 5 performed on Sullivan are here, including a cover of Sly & The Family Stone's STAND with Michael and Jermaine trading lead vocals.  My favorite though might be Gladys Knight's ""If I Were Your Woman"", a really jaw-droppingly good performance.  There's lots of the Supremes and Temptations, the 4 Tops sing some medleys, Smokey shows up, its all great!",1316995200,14,711,4.566929133858268
4655282,5,B005D0TERW,Just got this in the mail today and on this rainy day it was the best thing for me! It brought the sunshine right back today.  Even on a sunny day it would be great.

The younger generations can see where much of today's music got its birth.  Priceless.  It is to bad that such variety shows have dissappeared.

Though we all liked the Supremes, there is just too much of them in comparison to the other Motown artists.  Would have preferred a better ratio of performance time for all the artists (i.e. Smokey Robinson)!  Overall, it was good to see Ed's show again and his demeanor as a sophisticated show host.",1421193600,,406,4.45945945945946

The raw talent is evident in some of the performances and I will never tire of seeing little Michael Jackson doing his thing. This is good material to teach the younger generation where it all started, if they would be interested in learning about old school entertainment.",1398470400,,746,4.492647058823529

It will bring back so many nice memories and great sounds from Motown.

For people, under age 60 who like music ---you would also enjoy it.
Before the age of music videos, musical groups  often began their
rise to stardom on the Ed Sullivan Show in New York City. Appearing
on this show was the equivalent of being on America's Got Talent
today. Except the group rose or boomed based on the public's
opinion who were viewing.",1376006400,,496,4.43956043956044

4655379,5,B005D0TERW,"Motown cornered the market on the immaculate presentation of Black recording artists of the 1960s-70s, and this double DVD delivers the audio/visual evidence.  The performances here are nothing short of golden.  Wow!  Just wow!  This is entertainment! There are so many standout and moments that make you smile with both memory and pride...  this ranges from witnessing a young Michael Jackson singing ""Who's Loving You"" to The Supremes delivering that patented primped and polished sedate sexuality, along with the simmering sophistication other girl groups were to follow in the future. The Temptations, as always, give great vocals and choreography with a smoothness that has long become legendary.

I only wish there were more performances by Marvin Gaye (only one), but apparently he didn't make very many Sullivan appearances... likewise with Stevie Wonder (only two). Odd that.

But this is a wonderful piece of history, wrapped up in a Soul and R &B musical package.  It would make a wonderful gift to yourself, any fan or a curious youngster in need of an education.

4655381,5,B005D0TERW,"I haven't purchased this DVD yet, but I'd like to know if the first Supremes' ""Love Child"" performance includes their delay on Ed Sullivan's show.  After first introducing them, Ed finds out they were delayed, then jokingly said, ""The Supremes will be fired for this!""  The reason for the delay was because all the Supremes had ""Love Child"" sewn on their sweatshirts, then Diane demanded that only hers have ""Love Child"" on it.  The delay was the removal of ""Love Child"" from Mary and Cindy's sweatshirts.  Ed always had such a dry sense of humor and it was always fun when he let a good one out.",1359417600,,596,4.542056074766355

4655393,5,B005D0TERW,This collection pretty much captures The Motown Sound. I use portions of it in my middle school music classes to show examples of artists who influenced many of today's modern R&B and hip-hop performers.,1357689600,,203,5.0
4655394,5,B005D0TERW,"Since I was a small child when all these performances were film it's nice to have them on DVD. The main reason why I bought this was to see Gladys Knight & The Pips!  I hope they release a DVD of them like they did for the Supremes, Temptations and Four Tops. Some of these performance were on a previous released DVD Ed Sullivan The Soul of The Motor City but I kind of like this one better EVEN though they were both good!",1357603200,,424,4.0476190476190474

4655398,5,B005D0TERW,Seeing Michael and his brothers on the Ed Sullivan show again was the most wonderful reliving of my childhood because it brought me back to when I was 8 years old and seeing them for the first time and the day I became a fan.  Long time ago a must have if you remember the day and saw that day so long ago.  Now I have it for my collection to relive it any time I want.,1354320000,,369,3.779220779220779

4655402,5,B005D0TERW,"I was only three and a half years old when Ed Sullivans show ended in June of 1971, but almost all of my favorite comedians and impressionist had a bit in their act where they did an Ed Sullivan impersonation saying, "" We are going to have a rearly rearly good show tonight!"" Combine that withe the soulful sounds of Motown and you are in for a treat. One of the most important contributions Ed Sullivan will always be remembered for is how he was daring enough to embrace R&B performers in an era when the music and culture was appreciated but the performers weren't. Any lover of of nostalgia in the form of TV hosts that rpredated Johnny Carson, Jay Leno, Dave Letterman and Conan, please pick up this two disc DVD and relive this portion of Americana with your kids like I did and explain how far we have came in a nation dealing with race, music and culture.

4655406,5,B005D0TERW,"I viewed this video and allowed my mind and emotions to travel back through the years to enjoy the groups, music and times of yesterday. I grew up with the Motown sound and although it's been many years, since the groups were established, the video will return you to a more entertaining, casual, fun time.
  Whether young or old you will enjoy spending this time with Motown and I am so grateful to Ed Sullivan who  gave our music a chance to be heard nationwide.",1320278400,5,464,4.435294117647059
4655407,1,B005D0TERW,"Please don't buy this DVD, most of these songs are available on discount DVDs that have been out for a long time now. The biggest reason I call it garbage is because MOTOWN could have made the sound much better than it is. Its quiet and not brought up to date for a listeners ears. In fact, its so bad that I just gave it away and chalked it up to a bad decision to buy. The picture is shrunk down smaller than it was originally made and the sound is terrible. MOTOWN, you should be ashamed of yourselves. I bought the British Invasion and many of the performances were from Ed Sullivan, and the sound was remastered to be great. They were clear, louder, and perfect to listen to.  Dont buy the MOTOWN stuff cause you will be sorry.",1318723200,5,732,4.228571428571429

4655409,5,B005D0TERW,"Jackson 5, Marvin Gaye, The Supremes...Best of Motown on DVD can only offer a wonderful time delenate TV. Highly recommended, a classic indispensable.",1318636800,,150,5.565217391304348
4655410,5,B005D0TERW,"This two-disc set contains over 35 performances from 1963-71 featuring all the Motown greats from Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye to The Supremes, Temptations and Jackson Five. The video and audio quality is great (NOTE- see the screen grabs I posted in the Images section of this product).

All the performances allow one to relive a magical time in music history with fabulous colorful '60s sets, talented vocalists performing layered, well-written material accompanied by cute choreography. Everything today is so overblown with elaborate sets, lights and trampy-looking backup dancers to disguise the fact that the songs are little more than repetitive hip-hop chants and the ""artists"" virtually play no instruments. You won't find any distracting, flashy theatrics or head-spinning, hyperactive editing on these shows--just good, old-fashioned, classy entertainment. Yes, some of the costumes are dated and unfortunate (like the Pips in green Keebler-Elf uniforms, or the Temps high-waisted powder blue Peter-Pan suits), and Diana Ross looks like she's sporting four pair of eyelashes during ""Love Child"" and ""I'm Livin' In Shame"" but that only adds to the nostalgia and fun.

Sofa Entertainment has also released separate volumes featuring the Temptations and the Supremes, but I think this set is more bang for your buck if you're not a completist. The Temptations set itself only contains two different performances (medleys) not found here. The Supremes set contains six numbers that are on this set and six that are not (four are standards, one is a medley and the other is a post-Diana appearance with Jean Terrell).

Though it's not complete, this is probably the best Motown set currently on the market.

This collection also really makes you appreciate how good The Ed Sullivan Show was when they were running out plate spinners and wacky puppets.
