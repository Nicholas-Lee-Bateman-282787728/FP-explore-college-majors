7922153,5,B00004SZZS,"I love this movie and use it in my 9th grade Art class. Most of my students enjoyed it also, because it is better than a documentary.
The movie told a great story on the 19th Century American artist, Winslow Homer and his style of art of that period . It explained the emotional scars Homer was dealing with after working for Harper's Weekly during the American Civil War.
I have had the video since 2001, but it was beginning to show some wear and I needed to replace it. I am glad I was able to find the dvd version on Amazon to show to my class this year.",1455148800,,558,4.081818181818182
7922154,5,B00004SZZS,"My kids and I really enjoyed this movie. It's become one of our favorites in the artists series and will be watched again and again and again here. It's sad to see that another reviewer only made it 24 minutes into the movie because that means they missed out on the story and the way the movie came together. Sometimes it's worth it to give something a chance as characters are developed and a beautiful story comes out of it.

I thought this was well written. It prompted enough of an interest in Winslow Homer in our household that we started looking up museums in our area that might have some of his work. Thanks to this movie, we've visited the museum several times since and have loved it each and every time.... even though none of Winslow Homer's works are currently on display. We purchased a book of his paintings so that we could continue to enjoy his works together.

I think the movie also did a good job of showing what war does to people and families from different angles. The writers did a good job of pulling together the stories of the artist and the two kids who welcomed themselves into his life when he thought he just wanted to be alone. In the end, they all needed each other and had all been affected by the war in their own way. Watching this together prompted a lot of discussion in our home about war and how it affects even those who aren't directly involved, and my 9 year old son has spent a good bit of his summer learning more on his own about the Civil War.

I wish that Nest was still producing more movies in the artists series. They've been some of our very favorites over the years.",1437955200,2,1621,4.3256578947368425

7922156,1,B00004SZZS,"I could only get through about twenty-four minutes of this movie- it was so badly written.  The two children/teenagers in the film were incredibly rude and obnoxious.  They spoke and behaved nothing like what one would expect of a nineteenth century child, even a rude one.  Shooting Winslow Homer with a slingshot, insulting and making fun of him, barging into his home without permission and in his presence-  I guess it was supposed to be funny but it was just annoying and absurd. I couldn't keep watching. There was very little of the artist working on his art from what I saw, other than a moment or two of him sketching before he was harassed by the boy with the slingshot.  On the bright side the sets were great and the scenery looked much like his paintings.  It's just too bad the characters were straight out of a bad contemporary sitcom.",1335916800,5,850,4.596026490066225
7922157,4,B00004SZZS,"I ordered this DVD for a group of fifth graders to whom I teach Art History.  We had already read a short biography of Homer prior to viewing and has observed many of his paintings. I have to say, that after viewing part of the film at home, I wasn't sure if it would hold their interest (I found it a bit bland) but it did! Their background knowledge, helped bring many of the films themes to life: his independent character, work as an illustrator, as well as his involvement as an illustrator during the Civil War.  They enjoyed it very much. It was perfect for their age group.",1318809600,3,581,4.321100917431193
7922158,1,B00004SZZS,"My 8th graders hated it.  As an art teacher I support what the producers are trying to do, however, this video has a weak script, uninspired performances and is simply boring.  The basic dramatic conflict of the story is too internalized  for middle school and too childish for high school. The performances are so underplayed and amateur-ish that there's nothing to hold students' attention.  There are really very few insights into Homer the man, the artist, his techniques or his life beyond the fact that he was an illustrator during the Civil War. Save your money for a documentary video on Homer.",1064707200,5,602,4.872549019607843
7922159,5,B00004SZZS,"Super family video that is interesting, historically accurate and educational. Subtle story and paintings are woven together well. Makes the viewer believe it's really 1874 in New York. Creativity balances the theme of the horrors of war. Found it engrossing and entertaining. ""It was funny and sad, interesting and about war."" ""The way the artist worked was great, how he saw things and painted them."" ""I liked the kids messing with the man, and the boy and girl being sweet on each other."" Ages 8-12.",1000339200,4,502,4.91764705882353
