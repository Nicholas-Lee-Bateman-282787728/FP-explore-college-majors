7912018,2,B00000JGHA,"After seeing NOVA: the day the earth shook, this is a real bummer. That's why I recommended the nova tape INSTEAD of this, read my NOVA review to know why.

This video only contains news footage of the AFTERMATH of a Californian quake. No actual earthquake footage, just footage of the damages, for only a short 30 minutes. Interesting here and there, (so called earthquake safe highways, weren't earthquake resistent after all) but not worth the money, in my opinion.",1103673600,,468,4.85
