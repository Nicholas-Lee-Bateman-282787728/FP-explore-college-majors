1905310,4,B0000AGQ2H,"US Championship Tournament Final
Eddie Guerrero vs. Chris Benoit
I was a bit surpirsed to see this be the first match of the night, but it didn't fail. some awesome displays by both wrestlers. at the end, rhyno came out and gored his then friend benoit, which helped eddie come out victorious. easily one of the best matches of the night. 4.5/5
Jamie Noble vs. Billy Gunn
this match was alright, but it was a bit short. it was pretty easy to predict who was going to win. if jamie won, he got a chance to sleep with torrie wilson. and he did win. nothing i'd wanna watch over again 2.5/5
APA Invataional
superstars in this match included APA, Matt Hardy, Shannon Moore, Spanky, Kanyon, Basham Brothers, Sean O'Haire, Dionk The Clown, The Easter Bunny(yes, The Easter Bunny) and Brother Love
This match was here purely for one reason. comedy. the easter bunny going through the window, hilaious! good for a laugh.  3.5/5
WWE Tag Team Championship
Rey Mysterio & Billy Kidman vs. Worlds Greatest Tag Team(Champions)
this match was good. awesome moves mysterios. watch out for the shooting star press kidman does from the middle of the top rope to the outside of the ring. brilliant. the champions retained their title 4/5
Sable vs Stephanie McMahon
i wouldnt say this was a good match, but it was surprisingly good for a womens match. 2/5
Undertaker vs. John Cena
this match was one of the best of the night. undertaker won, but was the one who left the arena a bloody mess. 4/5
Zach Gowen vs. Vince McMahon
zach gowen fights really well for a guy with one leg. i liked this match, but i didn't REALLY like it. vince wins, but zach manages the bust him open with a chair shot that gave vince 16 stiches. just looked at the blood. gruesome! 3.5/5
Triple Threat Match WWE Championship
Big Show vs. Kurt Angle vs. Brock Lesnar (Champion)
the best match of the night. brilliant triple threat action. this was also a no DQ match. so many great displays. kurt angles slams big show the spanish announcers table. angle wins my pinning brock after an angle slam. awesome 5/5",1059868800,,2064,4.59349593495935
1905311,4,B0000AGQ2H,"just note that i was at the actual payperview and when you're at the actual event it usually makes you think that the things better than video evidence might show.
Guerrero VS Benoit- Starts out slow and boring as hell but got faster as it went on.  The end is funny with Guerrero.  The ref gets knocked down a couple times in this one.
Noble VS Billy Gunn- Good match, I don't remember much about it except everyone slapping and kissing everyone at the end.  I'm hoping Noble and Gunn are a tag team now cuz Billy Gunn will never be a good singles wrestler.
APA Barroom Brawl- This one was hard to see from my seat but what I saw on the titantron was good.  It's basically just mindless everyone hitting everyone with random stuff the whole match.  Alot like the hardcore championship matches in 2000 where they just went all over the arena hitting eachother with stuff that wouldnt even hurt. I happen to be a big fan of this stuff.  Hilarious when the Easter Bunny gets thrown through that window/panel thing.
Worlds...Tag Team VS Billy Kidman and Rey Mysterio
Possibly best match of the night.  Kidman does a shooting star press off the top rope to the floor which is awesome and Mysterio pulls out all the crazy moves he does on a nightly basis.  It was predictable but the match was still awesome.
Sable VS Stephanie
Why does Sable's clothes get ripped off on Smackdown and it only gets censored by two little lines but then on a PAYPERVIEW shes completely covered?  The only person whose shirt gets ripped off in this match is the refs.  As far as the actual wrestling goes in the match its about par for a womens match these days (not that anyone cares about that anyways.)
Gowen VS Mcmahon
Zach just gets beat up the whole time basically.  He only does about 6 different moves the whole matchs but their still fun to watch considering he only has one leg.  This match is really awesome.  The angle leading up to it was way overdone and probably got more TV time than the main event did but the actual wrestling ripped.
Undertaker VS Cena
Good match, not very fast but the moves they do hurt a lot or atleast look painful I wouldnt really know.  Why did Taker have a yellow and orange motorcycle?
Brock Lesner VS Big Show VS Kurt Angle
Sweet main event.  If you look at the Smackdown main events for every payperview since Survivor Series 2002 you'll see that two of these guys are almost always fighting eachother.  This couldve easily been a Summer Slam match or Wrestlemania if the timing was right.  It was basically the culmination of their feud.  The wrestling was awesome too.  When I was watching it I couldn't believe when it was over, it felt like that match had just started,  Apparently it was like half an hour though.  Time just went by fast for me when i was watchin this one.  And a title change too which is always cool.  They would never let the title change hands on RAW for a payperview as small as Vengeance.  Come to think of it, is RAW EVVVVVVVEEEERRRR going to drop the belt to someone new?
I'd say overall this is a really awesome one and I'm buying the DVD the day it comes out.  I suggest you do too.  I'd say anyone can enjoy atleast something in this payperview.  Its really spread out.  Its got a little type of wrestling for all preferences.",1059782400,,3280,4.421666666666667

1905316,5,B0000AGQ2H,"By far, this was the greatest PPV I have ever seen! The best of the year so far and perhaps had some of the greatest matches ever to grace a PPV. Smackdowns very first PPV and Vengeance was so hyped up and the event truly lived up to its name.
PPV kicked off with a hot and very loud Denver crowd exploding w3ith excitment and anticipation
Ultimo Dragon v Kanyon
Very good opener! Fast paced, high flying and Dragon's WWE PPV debut. Plenty of action to get the crowd rolling and many high spots (Dragon's inspirational finisher)
US Championship Finals
Chris Benoit v Eddie Guerrero
This was a classic display of techinal wrestling. One of the best matches I have ever seen and perhaps the match of the year so far! This was a huge diaplay of 100% wrestling and offense and these two great superstars put on one hell of a match. One for the ages. Many great spots and a very shocking ending! Benoit and Eddie are the best their is right now and whenever these two former best friends collide in the ring, you are guaranteed a great fight
Indecent Proposal Match
Jamie Noble v Mr Ass
Okay match to keep the crowd buzzing. The PPV return of Billy Gunn and he proved that he still the the baddest dog. Great ending with a very funny outcome. Torrie looked great!!!
Ist Ever Invitational Barroom Brawl APA
Barbaric Brawl and one hell of a sloober knocker. Fun to see all these Smackdown superstars get it on inside a bar ran by the ever so great APA. Fun to watch with plenty of hight spots (Matt Hardy's leg drop from the top of the stage) One to see!
WWE Tag Team Championship
Worlds Greatest Tag Team v Rey Mysterio & Billy Kidman
The best ever Tag Match I have ever seen. Fast and furious action from start to finish loads of breathtaking moves and high flying techinques. Everything you would expect from a tag match. Smackdown has the best stars and this match proves it. Mysterio is a wrestling dream and what he does in the ring is inspirational. Got to see this match, fantastic!
Undertaker v John Cena
Very good match and better then I thought. Cena has made his name after giving one hell of a performance. Taker is still the baddest dog in the yard but the New Skool proved that even he could go one on one with the deadman. Another classic match!
Stephanie McMahon v Sable
Good match. Great ending.
Mr McMahon v Zach Gowan
Bloody, brutal and one hell of a fight. I knew this match would be good and Gowan is excellent. What a match! The second best of the night. Venegance was truly upon both these two. Bloody and a nasty chair shot at the end.

SHOW STEALER! Other than Backlash, this is the best main event I have seen this year. It turned out to be more like a street fight and their were so many high spots and great moments in this match. very bloody and loads of great moves, (Angle slams Show onto the announce table) (Lesner Powerbombs Show) What a main event should be. Very nerve shredding and breathtaking with a very, very good ending (I am an Angle fan) Great battle for the gold and a very good end to a fantastic PPV!",1059350400,,3094,4.363951473136915

This DVD could be great as they could include a second disc including Smackdown! Us Title tournament but unfortunately the WWE are likely to make another mistake and make all the special features Triple H matches and build-ups (joking) but seriously judging on the other DVDs the special features will include Post Match and Pre-Match Interviews, Velocity Matches and Segments and maybe a special US Title match or something maybe the first title defense Harley Race vs. Johnny Valentine and probably some highlights of the US Tournament or they'll just put that in the build-up and they'll have PPV promos and ads which are pretty pointless but nice to have.
Looks like a good PPV with good possibilites but some things will slow the PPV down like A-Train, Big Show, Doink, Brawler, Easter Bunny (?), Gowen, Gunn, Taker (my favourite wrestler), women's match but besides that the tag match will be speedy and the main event minus Show will be technical as will Eddie vs. Benoit :D.",1059264000,,1524,4.910852713178294
1905320,4,B0000AGQ2H,"Vengeance was Smackdown's first PPV back in 2003. I usually find the single brand PPVs rather weak, but this outing was very good, with every match having something to get excited about.

Rundown:

Finals of the US Championship Tournament
Chris Benoit vs Eddie Guerrero
It's so sad to watch this match and think neither of these men are longer with us. This match was for the newly revived US Championship, and it was a good opening match. Eddie got the crowd into it with his antics - a funny moment occured when he hit the referee with the title belt and then tried to blame it on Chris Benoit. You had to laugh at him, since it was so typically Eddie. A great technical wrestling match, and Eddie stole the victory. A great fast paced opener. (4/5)

Indecent Proposal Match
Billy Gunn (w/ Torrie Wilson) vs Jamie Noble
This match had an interesting stipulation - if Jamie won the match, he'd get a night with Torrie. The wrestling on display was fine and both Torrie and Jamie's girlfriend Nidia both provided interference at ringside. A fine match, that saw Jamie winning his night with Torrie - Torrie's facial expressions were classic. (3/5)

The APA Invitational
This was absolutely hilarious. It began with Funaki conducting an interview with Bradshaw & Farooq where they invited him to the invitational. This wasn't really wrestling, it was more of a brawl with guys smacking each other over the head with bottles and stuff. But it was so entertaining, especially when the Easter Bunny got beaten up. Brother Love was annoying though. Funaki was amusing too, he sat at the bar and drunk for the whole match, then eliminated himself by falling off his barstool. Bradshaw won the match, by being the last man drinking. (4/5)

WWE Tag Team Championship Match
The World Greatest Tag Team (Shelton Benjamin & Charlie Haas) vs Billy Kidman & Rey Mysterio
Back in the day every PPV had a tag team title match somewhere on the card - this was SD's tag match. And it was exciting! Rey and Billy kept things fast paced, and WGTT were pretty good too. The moment when everybody thought Rey had won the match was so exhiliarating, the whole crowd was on their feet and shrieking. A great tag team match. (4/5)

Stephanie McMahon vs Sable
The women's match of the card - this pitted the Smackdown GM against Vince McMahon's current lady of choice. It was basically a catfight, but it was a good one. I love Stephanie, she's awesome. Sable looked amazing though. Some funny moments were included, especially when the referee gave Sable his shirt and Tazz and Michael Cole said he'd been to the gym lately. The match ended when A-Train came out and attacked Stephanie, allowing Sable to get the pin. (3.5/5)

Undertaker vs John Cena
This was back when John was a heel and you were supposed to hate him. But this was a great match, because John showed off why he could run with the top superstars of the WWE, by almost beating Taker a couple of times. Taker showed why he's so popular, and the match was just fun to watch. Taker pulls the victory out, but I don't think John would have been disappointed with his performance here. (4/5)

Zach Gowen vs Mr McMahon
This is Vince at his evil best here, as he's so mean to Zach Gowen, who only has one leg. But man, can the boy wrestle! It was so amazing to watch him pull out all these moves with only one leg - he wrestled better with one leg then some wrestlers did with two. Vince mostly slapped Zach around for most of the match, but Zach did get in some offence, which had the crowd shouting for him. At one point, he almost won but Vince was too close to the ropes. In the end, Vince pulled out a victory after Zach missed with the moonsault. (3/5)

Triple Threat Match for the WWE Championship
Brock Lesnar vs Big Show vs Kurt Angle
For some reason, I thought this match would be boring, but triple threats are always fun. Kurt Angle was the big fan favourite going into this match, but all three men showed off what they've got. Brock & Kurt worked together to attack Big Show so they could take on each other. It worked for awhile as Big Show went through the Spanish announce table. In the end, Kurt hit an Angle Slam on Brock Lesnar and pinned him to win the title. A great main event. (4/5)

Overall, this show has gained mostly 3 and 4 out of 5 ratings, which is spectacular. The DVD doesn't have any extras though, which is not good, you think they could have included a couple of extras at least.

But definitely check this PPV out, as Smackdown put on a superb show here.",1245024000,,4527,4.481796116504855

1905322,5,B0000AGQ2H,"That's right, this was the best PPV that the WWE had produced in 2005. This was one of those events that was stacked from top to bottom & even the weakest match on the card was watchable making this a quality show to the point that you would think that this was WrestleMania instead of just another PPV event.

Intercontinental Champion Carlito vs Shelton Benjamin. Great opening contest & one of Carlito's best ""wrestling"" matches as he was able to hold his own & showcase his ability instead of being a comedy act while we all know that Benjamin rarely disappoints in the ring to the point that it makes you wonder why WWE doesn't push him enough.

Victoria vs Christy Hemme. This was the weakest match on the card as it was more watchable than Christy's WrestleMania match with Trish but nothing special came from it.

Kane vs Edge w/Lita. It's interesting to point out that in real life, Lita left Matt Hardy for Edge where in this storyline, Kane was the one who replaced Hardy. Anyways, this was a much better match that anyone anticipated & it even tops their previous encounters as both men brought a strong effort here along with a cameo appearance from Snitsky with Lita being quite the sight to look at.

Shawn Michaels vs Kurt Angle. This WrestleMania rematch was just sort of thrown together at the last minute but that's not a bad thing, that's a good thing (Thanks, DDP). This didn't top their WrestleMania encounter but these two put on an awesome performance with the story being that Kurt was more dominate here than their first match that allowed HBK to fight from behind more than he is used to doing.

WWE Champion John Cena vs Christian vs Chris Jericho. Awesome match between these three as we all know that you can never go wrong with Jericho & Christian being involved in the same match while Cena surprised everyone by actually holding his own along with the usual non stop action that you would expect in this type of match & Tomko getting involved from time to time.

Hell In A Cell: World Heavyweight Champion Batista vs Triple H. Their third, last & best encounter as these two beat the living hell out of each other to the point that both men were heavily busted open & used various weapons like barbed wire steel chairs steel chains, steel steps, & sledgehammers. Batista gets his third straight PPV victory over Triple H as well as one of the best matches of his whole career.

DVD extras include the Vengeance Press Conference, an interview with Lillian Garcia, Triple H getting a well-deserved standing ovation after the match along with a shocking Hell In A Cell post match footage, an aftermath that involved Jericho, Tomko & Christian that lead to Eric Bischoff making the main event for the next night on RAW, which is a bonus match on the set & that match is Jericho, Christian & Tomko against John Cena, Shawn Michaels & Hulk Hogan.

Overall, this was the WWE's best event of 2005 along with this being the second best DVD (behind WrestleMania) of the year to get because not only do you get a quality show but the DVD is stacked with extras making this DVD worthing going out of your way to get.",1230249600,,3137,4.559502664298401

I hope you find this review helpful; remember to vote helpful or not helpful.(Note-Each DVD I review has a ""Match of the DVD"" award somewhere in it.)

WWE Vengeance 2003
This is one of the most solid wrestling events I've ever seen. This was Smackdown's first brand exclusive PPV and it did not dissatisfy. Sadly, there are no extras, but if you are just buying this for the show then you will be happy. Buy this DVD if you love wrestling.

Finals of the U.S. Championship Tournament (Match of the DVD Award)
Chris Benoit VS Eddie Guerrero
This was an insane way to kick off the PPV. This match is given plenty of time and it took off well. The added fact that this match was going to declare the first U.S. Champion made this match really special. The ref gets tore up in this match.
RATING-9.5/10

Indecent Proposal Match
Billy Gunn w/ Torrie Wilson VS Jamie Noble w/ Nidia
The story behind this match was that if Noble won, he would get to sleep with Playboy cover girl Torrie Wilson. This is all much to Nidia's distain. I've always been a fan of Gunn's offence; he has a wide variety of power moves he uses. Noble is always entertaining and pulls a great top-rope DDT in this match. The story is stupid but the match is solid.
RATING- 7/10

The APA Invitational- Bar Room Brawl
APA sent out invitations to a bunch of wrestlers (and non-wrestlers) to compete in a bar room brawl. This is a huge, entertaining spot-fest. Basically spot after spot and no time is wasted. You'll enjoy this one.
RATING- 8/10

WWE Tag Team Championship
World's Greatest Tag Team(c) VS Billy Kidman & Rey Mysterio
This is a decent tag match but it's nothing special. A few good spots including a spring board Shooting Star Press to a Kidman-Mysterio special.
RATING- 7.5/10

Stephanie McMahon VS Sable
Okay, this is the only dark spot on the show. Stephanie plays her part well and Sable does okay. Screwjob ending and it's over.
RATING- 3.5/10

Undertaker VS John Cena
I love this match. Cena as a heel was a great thing. This is your basic Undertaker brawl, but there is nothing wrong with that. Great match.
RATING- 8.5/10

Zach Gowen VS Mr. McMahon
This match is great for two reasons: Zach has one leg and wrestles great, and McMahon gets one of the sickest gashes on the top of his head. A one-legged man doing a moonsault is enough to entertain me.
RATING- 7.5/10

Brock Lesnar(c) VS Big Show VS Kurt Angle
This match was a great way to end out the show, a solid match-up with no screwjob endings. Angle hitting the angle slam on Big Show is pretty nice.

1905325,5,B0000AGQ2H,"I recently got in the mood to watch wrestling from a few years back and this ppv looked pretty good. I admit no extra features does hurt the dvd but not too much. The most annoying thing about the whole thing is how the announcers kept on saying they were in Colorado and since the air was different, it was going effect some matches.

Chris Benoit vs. Eddie Guerrero: Great match. Too bad these two wrestlers are no longer with us. Guerrero's performance in this match is funny and the announcers loved it.

Billy Gunn vs. Jamie Noble: Two great wrestlers who never really got much notice. Well Gunn was half of the New Age Outlaws but afterwards he could have been a top star, it never happened. Noble is getting there.
The match is alright but nothing speical.

World's Greatest Tag Team vs. Billy Kidman & Rey Mysterio: Four of the greatest wrestlers in the world. Of course this match was going be classic.

Stephanie McMahon vs. Sable: Yawn

APA Invitational: Comedy affair that had a few cool spots.

Undertaker vs. John Cena: Really good match. This match wasn't a hardcore match but still very intense.

Zach Gowen vs. Vince McMahon: I'll admit that I skipped this one.

Brock Lesnar vs. Big Show vs. Kurt Angle: A great triple threat match with Angle winning the world title.

Overall, it was amazing how much talent Smackdown had in 2003. Lesnar, Angle, Mysterio, Benoit, Undertaker, Kidman and so much more talent on its roster. It should have beat Raw in the ratings but I don't think it ever did. The roster basically reflects TNA of today. Many talented stars but for some reason, no one cares.",1195862400,4,1609,4.617543859649123

The addition of the United States title on Smackdown was a great idea.  Although this match was very strong, I am still left a little disappointed with the men's performance.  For Beniot and Guerrero's standards, the match is not as good as it may have had the potential to be.  The pace of the match is quick, and Guerrero pleases the Denver crowd with some comedic antics that we expected from him.  Rhyno makes an appearance to sway the outcome.  But overall, the match was a great choice of an opener.

Billy Gunn w/ Torrie Wilson vs. Jamie Noble:
In the intro, I spoke about being able to get passed stupid little reasons to put matches on a PPV, this is one of the matches I was referring to.  It was supposed to be an indecent proposal match.. the proposal being that Jamie would be able to get with Torrie Wilson if he was able to defeat Billy Gunn.  First off, the two men have a major size difference, which was a little distracting, but all in all, this was a very solid match.  The little extra Torrie adds from the side with her facial expressions is actually.. well, funny.  Nidia was also a good addition to the mix up.  Noble and Gunn work well together in matches, and I was pleasantly surprised by the way this turned out.

APA Invitational:
I don't know whether or not this was an official match, but it was a fun little addition to the show.  Pretty much, there were a bunch of superstars who fought in a ""bar room"" down on the floor next to the stage.  There were a lot of comedic spots in the fight as well.  As entitled, it is the APA Invitational, so that may be a little foreboding for the outcome.  I don't think anyone was taking themselves, or the match for that matter, seriously, so in that light, we can let loose and enjoy this lighter segment of the show.  With WWE's more family friendly audience nowadays, it is unlikely that we will get something like this again, so I suggest you give this one a look.

WWE Tag Titles:
Shelton Benjamin & Charlie Haas vs. Rey Meysterio & Billy Kidman
One thing that I do like about this time in the WWE is that they put more of a focus on its preliminary level titles, especially the tag titles.  This fast paced contest is really fun to watch.  Benjamin and Haas are always reliable with their technical backgrounds, and the popularity of Meysterio and Kidman was well perceived by the crowd.  The match is one of the best tag title contests of the year.  I don't think that talent involved was capable of doing any less anyway.  The show manages to give us a great opening contest, a couple of silly little additions, and now comes back and gives a pure wrestling showcase that we can all appreciate.

Stephanie McMahon vs. Sable:
I was genuinely interested in the chemistry Sable and Steph had going before the match.  I may sound naive saying this, but whenever the chairman is involved with the festivities, the match always seems to take on a little more importance.  The match was advertised on preview shows as well as on Smackdown broadcasts.  It was a catfight, so I was not really expecting much out of it, and sadly, I didn't ever get much out of it.  The fight was lengthy, and had a surprising end to it.  Some people may be inclined to not give this one a look, but I can't say that I blame them.

Undertaker vs. John Cena:
This match took place back when I actually liked Cena.  The Undertaker's role here was that he was going to shutup the arrogant, disrespectful, heel in Cena.  Cena actually manages to put on a good show, brawling with Taker in his own style.  Also, this was the first time that Cena began to work with some of the bigger names in the company.  The match is a little longer than I would have liked, but nonetheless is a solid match where Cena stands his ground in the ring.  You are excited to see Taker pick up the win by the end.

Zach Gowen vs. Mr. McMahon:
I know I won't be the most popular person with this call, but I am not really sold by the whole Zach Gowen thing.  I can respect him for making the best of his handicap, and actually performing successfully here against the chairman, but it overall seems like a bit of an insult.  I am not implying that they are making fun of Gowen, but let's be real with ourselves here.  Vince's addition to the match with all of the teasing and cowardly acts of violence toward Gowen makes it a little more bearable, but watching McMahon wrestle a man with one leg is a little degrading.  Take a look at this once just to get your curiosities put to rest.

WWE Title Triple Threat:
Kurt Angle vs. Big Show vs. Brock Lesnar
Superb main event to tie up the show here.  Three distinct styles going at it for the top prize on Smackdown.  Each of these had singles matches against one another, each of which were great as well, systematically setting up this 3-way title encounter.  Another great thing about this match is that there are no hangups.  The three men just put on a fast paced, technical, brutal, and crafty main event for the fans in Denver.  By the time this match ends, I found myself very pleased with the main event, as well at the whole card in general.

Like I said before, the DVD does not have any extras, which is a little disappointing.  The main thing that excited me about this event was its great display of pure talent, and its ability to entertain the fans with some ""sports entertainment"" aspects as well.  Luckily for the buyer, you should be able to get this classic for a pretty cheap amount.  Enjoy!",1184716800,,5841,4.376044568245125

Great 1st Ever PPV for SMACKDOWN!

1. Finals for the United States Championship
Chris Benoit vs. Eddie Guerrero
This was a great way to start off Smackdown's 1st PPV. It starts out slow but gets very fun to watch. Benoit and Eddie are both great wrestlers and this was a great match.
Winner: Eddie Guerrero 4.5/5

2. Jamie Noble vs. Billy Gunn w/ Torrie Wilson
This match was over Noble's obsessionabout Torrie being in Playboy. This was an alright match but Billy Gunn have had way better matches in the old WWF.
Winner: Jamie Noble 3/5

3. APA Invitational
This was an all out brawl a,d lots or current and old wrestlers are in this match. The APA are both left standing but Bradshaw is declared the winner.
Winner: Bradshaw 2/5

4. Tag Team Championship
Rey Mysterio & Billy Kidman vs. World's Greatest Tag Team (C)
Great match to follow up two not so great matches. Lots of high flying action and very fast paced. Great tag team match.
Winner: Haas & Benjamin 4/10

5. Cat Fight
Sable vs. Stephanie McMahon
Ok cat fight but Steph is certainly not a wrestler at all but Sable keeps this match watchable. A-Train comes out and help Sable to win.
Winner: Sable 2/5

6. Old School vs. New School
Undertaker vs. John Cena
This was actually a good and fought match and Taker really helps Cena look good in this match. Everything you expect from Taker in this match ther even is some blood from taker in this match but he comes back and win it.
Winner: Undertaker 4/5

7. Mr. McMahon vs. Zach Gowan
This match surprised me it was very entertaining and fun to watch. Zach pulls off a few nice moves and drop kicks a chair into Vince's face and then gets busted open. Fun to watch. ending was kinda predictable though.
Winner: Mr. McMahon 3/5

8. WWE Championship
Big Show vs. Brock Lesnar (C) vs. Kurt Angle
This was an awesome triple threat match wasn't the best but still great. Some trash cans come into play and Big Show gets Angle Slamed through the table. Big Show comes back chokeslams both Angle and Lesnar but Kurt comes back and delivers an Angle Slam on Brock to become a 4 time champion.

Intercontinental Champion Carlito Vs. Shelton Benjamin - This is a fantastic opener. Carlito has just won the IC Title from Benjamin on the past RAW. The match was very good and having fast paced action all the way through. Very strong opener and the ending was pulled off very cleanly. 4/5

Christy Hemme Vs. Victoria - This was an average women's match and the only weak part of the ppv. Just little things here and there to look out for. 2.5/5

Kane Vs. Edge w/Lita - Very good match between these two. Kane really shows his technical skills in this match. He really did look very good in this match. I really enjoyed this match but I still prefer their cage match from RAW as their best match during their feud here. Very good match. 4.25/5

Shawn Michaels Vs. Kurt Angle - This rematch was just awesome. And it defiantely lived up to their match from WM 21. But the match is very different though. You see different spots in this match that you didn't see from their Mania match like when Angle suplexes HBK onto the table and powerbombing HBK into the turnbuckle. I loved the ending and it worked in very good. Phenomenal rematch from two of the greatest of all time. 5/5

Chris Jericho Vs. WWE Champion John Cena Vs. Christian - A very good but not great Triple Threat match. Some good wrestling from all three men. This match is also Cena's 1st RAW PPV and it's also the  first time since Vengeance 2001 where the WWE Title and the World Heavyweight Title were both defended on a same brand PPV. Cena wins with the FU on Christian. 4/5

World Heavyweight Champion Batista Vs. Triple H (Hell In A Cell Match) - This was an incredible Hell In A Cell match. Everything you expect in a HIAC match & more. Very sickening spots in this one that involves both Batista & HHH using a chair wrapped in barbed wire on each other & beating each other with a steel chain. This is one of the best HIAC matches I have ever seen. Tremendous finsh to an outstanding event. 5/5

Shawn Michaels and Kurt Angle much like Wrestlemania 21 steal the show hands down in one of the greatest matches in wrestling history period. John Cena like him or not fends off both Christian and Chris Jericho in one of the best triple threat matches out there. Interesting part during this match as Jericho rolls up both and nearly gets a pin on both at the same time!

4th Match Kurt Angle vs Shawn Michaels

Lack of real build up may have hurt this match because the match was basically based from the WM21 match. WM21 was better mainly because Shawn delieved a better show in that match.

Great way to open the show. I feel that these two could be two of the best superstars in WWE in a few years,and this match will help to improve both of their young careers. Didn't like the ending,but the rest of the match was good. 8 out of 10.

2. Christy Hemme vs. Victoria
This match had a few good moves, but it was really just another average women's match. Nobody even hit their finisher. 5 out of 10.

3. Kane vs. Edge
I liked it when Kane said ""I'm Baaack!"";just too bad it lasted for about a week. This was a good matchup with some domination in the beginning from Kane,then domination by Edge in the middle. I liked the ending and i liked the spear on the outside. 8 out of 10.

4. Shawn Michaels vs. Kurt Angle
Wow! This match was excellent. Their Wrestlemania match was better,but this match is no pushover. They probably solidified their spot in the Hall Of Fame with their two matches. I cringed when Michaels got German Suplexed on the Announcer's Table. Great action and reversals throughout. 10 out of 10.

5. Triple Threat Match
John Cena vs. Christian vs. Chris Jericho(WWE Championship)
I knew that this match would be good,but I didn't know that it would be this good. Great action and near falls throughout,and there were a lot of big moves throughout,such as a DDT on the title belt and a powerbomb/suplex off the top rope. I liked the ending too. 10 out of 10.

6. Hell In A Cell Match
Triple H vs. Batista(World Heavyweight Championship)
Brutal Match! I personally like the barbed-wire steel chair better than the barbed-wire 2 x 4. Two sick shots to the back with it. Definitely the best match out of their three. 10 out of 10.

This is definitely a must buy.",1141257600,,1848,4.482142857142857

1905344,4,B0000AGQ2H,"Victoria vs Christy Hemme

This match was pretty good i didn't like how the ending went though Victoria shouldve hit the Widows Peak. Also, i though Trish shouldve returned at this point and make it a Triple Threat for the Womens Title",1140912000,,235,4.595238095238095
1905345,5,B0000AGQ2H,"Ever since it's introduction in 2002, I have NEVER been a fan of the WWE's brand extension (I hope they end it once and for all). But as it relates to this Raw PPV, it is the BEST RAW PPV and the best overall brand PPV ever, and that's saying a lot. You'll truly see why in my review of this event:

Carlito vs. Shelton Benjamin - Intercontinental Title, ***(A good way to start off the show and get the crowd hyped, Carlito picks up the victory in this one)

Christy Hemme vs. Victoria, *1/2 (standard women's match here, nothing special about this one)

Kane vs. Edge, ** (Man, these two feuding 1 year prior to this event, with the storyline here being as weird as this one in 04, an average match to be sure, but the EXCELLENCE begins from here)

By the way, before I get to the final three matches, please skip the crappy segment with Viscera, Lilian, and the Godfather. Don't even bother with those.

Shawn Michaels vs. Kurt Angle, ****3/4 (I'm actually torn on the rating for this one. For the Wrestlemania 21 match, I gave it 5 stars, as this one is close to that rating too. This was another CLASSIC match in their series. Not better than the original, but it's STILL excellent.)

John Cena vs. Christian vs. Chris Jericho - WWE Title, **** (Yes, this deserves 4 stars. This was another excellent match. It's too bad that Christian left for TNA. Other than that, each star delivered great performances here.)

Batista vs. Triple H - World Title Hell-in-a-Cell, ****1/4 (Wow. What a GREAT match this was. Batista had already defeated HHH twice. But in this match, HHH REALLY put Batista over as something special.)

Overall, I truly recommend the DVD to any fan. You won't regret this purchase. You have Michaels vs. Angle II, Batista vs. HHH in the Hell In A Cell, and Christian in first match for the WWE title. What more can you ask for!!!",1139184000,,1850,4.4851190476190474
1905346,5,B0000AGQ2H,"Benjamin vs. Carlito

A very good match despite an undesirable ending. It had plentiful athleticism and high flying moves from Shelton. Very good open to the night

RATING: 82/100

Kane vs. Edge

A nice match that had quite a few interferences at the end which didn't really hurt the match because I suppose it was all necessary. Another good match

RATING: 76/100

Christy vs. Victoria

A very unsuccessful match that served its purpose by promoting the woman's division, but failed to have any form of match quality. Very short with not much wrestling

RATING: 57/100

HBK vs. Angle

Another outstanding match from these competitors. It had intensity and psychology and the usual gripping counters and reversals of a classic. The only problem here is that there were none of either mans high-flying antics which also adds excitement. Still, a terrific match to set off the 2 major title matches.

RATING: 95/100

Cena vs. Y2J vs. Christian

Very good triple threat match that had many close nearfalls and many exhilarating moments. It only lacked a successful ending, as the ending here was more for perhaps an IC Title match and not WWE Title.

RATING: 86/100

HHH vs. Batista

A great HIAC match that had many nail biting nearfalls. However, there seemed to be too many non-high-impact weapon moves that took away from the brutality factor. A few of the bumps were very good. 5 minutes more and a bit more use of regular wrestling would have helped to add to intensity. Great main event to a spectacular show

RATING: 93/100

487 - 20 (because of ridiculous segment with Viscera)

78% - Excellent PPV containing 2 outstanding matches, and none that destroyed anything about the PPV.

TREMENDOUS WWE PPV!!!",1138320000,,1709,4.888501742160279
1905347,5,B0000AGQ2H,"Intercontinental Championship

Carlito vs. Shelton Benjamin

Pretty ""cool"" opener. Very nice back and forth action from these two. Shelton went for the splash in the corner and hits the exposed turnbuckle (guess who did that.) Carlito capitalizes, cradles up Shelton with a little help from the ropes. Carlito retains.

Victoria vs. Christy Hemme

The one waste of time on this DVD.

Kane vs. Edge w/Lita

Very good match! The only down-side was that Lita and Snitsky interfere. But even that could not help Mr. Money-in-the-Bank against the Big Red Machine! Kane wins with the Chokeslam.

Shawn Michaels vs. Kurt Angle

Instant classic! The only reason that this match was better than their first encounter at Wrestlemania 21 is that Shawn Michaels won. Angle jumped into Sweet Chin Music.

WWE Championship

John Cena vs. Chris Jericho vs. Christian

Great match-up. I am not a big fan of Christian, but he held his own in this match. In the end, Cena would hit the FU on Christian to retain the WWE title.

Hell In A Cell Match for the World Heavyweight Title

Batista vs. Triple H

Match of the night, Hands down! Brutal match. Chairs wrapped in barb wire, Steel stairs and tons of blood. Batista proves that he is the man. Triple H finally loses a One on One Hell in a Cell match! And who better to do it then Batista?",1137715200,,1323,4.670995670995671
1905348,5,B0000AGQ2H,"Yeah I said it, this was the best WWE PPV of the year...MAYBE the best PPV of the year period.  This PPV was proof that WWE can put out the best product when they are motivated.  The story is that two weeks earlier, ECW One Night Stand happened and Stephanie McMahon & Triple H (who both didn't want to do the ECW PPV) along with the rest of the creative team didn't want a PPV based off another promotion to do better buyrates & overshadow their own product.  Anyways, whatever the motivation was...it worked because this again was the best WWE PPV of the year.

Intercontinental Champion Carlito vs. Shelton Benjamin - Great opening match & the best match in Carlito's career up to this point since he was actually more worried about putting on a good match than being a comedy character.  Carlito won & Shelton continued to be buried for the rest of his WWE career for some reason that I'll never be able to figure out.

Victoria vs. Christy Hemme - Well, nothing much to say here except it was better than her WrestleMania match against Trish Stratus.

Kane vs. Edge w/Lita - This was almost like art imitiating life as in real life, Lita left Matt Hardy to get with Edge but in WWE...Kane played the role of Hardy.  This was a much better match than their previous ones.

Lilian Garcia calls Viscera out to sing to him & propose before The Godfather returns for one night & offers the Ho-Train to Big Vis who chooses the girls over Lilian.

HBK vs. Kurt Angle - They threw this match together at the last minute but thank god, they did.  This doesn't touch their WrestleMania match but it comes very VERY close.  Another modern day classic encounter.

WWE Champion John Cena vs. Chris Jericho vs. Christian - Awesome triple threat match with, of course, Tomko tryin' to get his shots in as well.  We all know whenever you involve Jericho & Christian in the same match...you'll get something worth watching.

Hell In A Cell: World Champion Batista vs. Triple H - Another awesome match that tops their WrestleMania match  by so many points (I didn't see the Backlash rematch).  You could see the ECW influence in this match as so many hardcore weapons (barbed wire chairs for example) were used.  Triple H bleeds buckets once again and is one of this best matches of the night period.  Batista wins with a spinebuster on top of the ring steps (the same ending you saw at SummerSlam with JBL.)

DVD extras included the press conference where you heard various ECW chants & references towards Bischoff & Angle along with a Hardy...I mean ""party"" chant towards Lita & Edge.  There's also footage of Triple H leaving the ring after the match to a standing ovation, a backstage confrontation between Triple H, Flair & Batista and an interview with with Lilian Garcia. There's also a backstage segment with Jericho & Christian & Tomko that sets up the match from RAW the next night which is a bonus match on this DVD: Jericho, Tomko, and Christian vs. Cena, HBK and HULK HOGAN!

Winner:Kane

Match #4 HBK V.S Kurt Angle
A great match no doubt about it,but its VERY hard to top their Wrestle Mania 21 Classic and they just couldn't do it. But they were about 3/4 of the way there and then they slowed down the match a bit. Some highlights included when Kurt Angle German Suplexed HBK through the announce table and when Kurt Angle Went off the Top Rope and was greeted with Some Sweet Chin Music. Kurt Angle Was Dissapointed and it even looked like he was crying at one point,But In My View,Kurt Angle Has Nothing to be Ashamed of. Great Match!
90/100 (I would give the WM one a 96/100)

Match #5 John Cena (C) V.S Christain V.S Chris Jerico
WOW!Another outstanding match. If you all think John Cena Doesn't Deserve to be the WWE Champ you all must be on Crack. Hes Beatin The like of Chris Jerico,Christain,Chris Masters,Kurt Angle,And even HBK.Look i know i would rather have HBK Be the WWE champ than John Cena but the kid cant help it if he's a great wrestlers. Anyway the match itself was great Coach Was going for Christain,Jerry Lawler was going for Y2J Chris Jerico and J.R Was going for Cena. John Cena won When he got Christain up for an F-U and Chris Jerico tried to stop him but he basicly used Christain As a Weapon to Knock over Chris Jerico And hit the F-U to Christain to Retain the WWE title
92/100

Winner:And still the WWE Champion,John Cena

The Main Event:HIAC Batista (c) V.S HHH
WOW!Again another great match and match of the night! and thats saying a lot when all the matches were ausome. They Used A Steel Chain,A Steel Chair wrapped in Barbed Wire,A Sledge Hammer,The Steel Steps,and the Cell It self. Batista even Spine bustered The Game on the Steel Steps. But Batista Got a Wicked DDT on the Steel Chair Wrapped in Barbed Wire. And when Triple H Went off the Top Rope,He was met with a Sledge Hammer Right in the mouth and Triple H Began Coughing up Blood. This Was a Great Match!!!!!
Batista did something only few in history have ever done,kiked out of the peddigree and he did something NO ONE had EVER done. He Beat HHH In Hell,Hell in a Cell.
96/100

Christy vs. Victoria- It's a normal Divas match. NEXT

Kane vs. Edge- Wow, this turned out better then I thought. It had a good story to it. But not as good as Matt Hardy vs. Edge.

HBK vs. Angle ""The Rematch""- This was a good match but not nearly as good as WM21, but this time HBK wins.

John Cena vs. Chris Jericho vs. Christain Cage(TNA)- Great match. This was Cena's first PPV, then his first Smackdown PPV now his first RAW PPV. Cena once again faced Chris Jerihco at Vengeance, but back then, Y2J was a Psycho. This time he wasn't as crazy. I always enjoy 3 way matches.

Batista vs. HHH ""Hell in a Cell""- MATCH OF THE NIGHT. First they had a great match at WM21. Now it Hell in the Cell. This one kinda reminds me of Undertaker vs. Brock Lesner at No Mercy 2002.

2. Victoria vs. Christy Hemme (1/2*)

Not the worst womens match I have seen but not that good either. Victoria is better than this. Hemme is just not meant to be a wrestler.

3. Kane vs. Edge (**)

Chapter 256 in the Kane/Edge feud and boy am I ready for it to end. Better than I expected with a really fun final 3-4 minutes.

Lita looks really hot in this match as well.

John Cena gives one the worst promos that I've ever heard. This guy is ten times worse than JBL ever was as champ. Not only is he a terrible wrestler, his mic skills suck as well.

4. Shawn Michaels vs. Kurt Angle (****)

Not much else to say except that these guys are two of the greatest ever. Not as good as their WM classic but still an excellent 25 minute match.

Next is the terrible Lillian/Viscera/Godfather skit. Skip unless you like this kind of time-wasting crap. And to think, Carlito/Benjamin could have used this time to have a meaningful match. That's WWE for ya.

Victoria vs. Christy Hemme

This was actually decent for a diva match. Victoria is one of the few women who can actually wrestle in WWE and makes this match watchable. Victoria cheats her way to a pin.

Kane vs. Edge

I honestly don't know why people are praising this match on here. It was not a very good match at all. Snitsky tries to get involved and ends up costing Edge the match.

Shawn Michaels vs. Kurt Angle

A rematch from WrestleMania 21. If you saw that match and liked it, you should enjoy this one as well. Excellent match and would have been match of the night if Hell in a Cell weren't involved tonight.

1905366,5,B0000AGQ2H,"WWE Vengeance 2005 was one of the best Vengeance's and one of the best WWE Pay Per View's of 2005. I found that this Pay Per View was awesome. I thought that one match could have used some improving, but the rest of the matches were awesome. The ""Hell In A Cell"" match was the first one and the best one that I have seen or have heard about (even though they never went on top of the cell). Here are the matches and the ratings to them:

1) WWE Intercontinental Championship

Carlito vs. Shelton Benjamin

This match was a pretty good opener. I didn't find it one of Shelton Benjamin's and Carlito's matches. Shelton didn't fight too good in this match and neither did Carlito. There were a few good moves in the match though. Cheap way for Carlito to retain the Intercontinental Title. 3.5/5

2) Victoria vs. Christy Hemme

This was probably the worst match of the night in my opinion because it never really lasted long and I didn't really find it interesting. Christy Hemme looked nice in her wrestling attire. This was more of a catfight than a wrestling match. 2/5

3) Kane vs. Edge w/ Lita

This was a really great match and I also think that it is a really great rivalry. This match showed a lot of revenge and a lot of action. This storyline between Kane, Lita and Edge is very exciting to watch. I have seen many other matches with these two superstars and they have been great. This match was awesome though and the best one. 4/5

4) Wrestlemania 21 Rematch

Shawn Michaels vs. Kurt Angle

This was an awesome match. I didn't find it as good as the Wrestlemania 21 one, but I found it good. There was a lot of fighting and there was a huge rivalry between these two superstars. Kurt Angle got some nice moves on Shawn Michaels, but Shawn Michaels got the win with two Sweet Chin Music's. Great match. 4.5/5

5) WWE Championship

Triple Threat Match

John Cena vs. Chris Jericho vs. Christian

An amazing Triple Threat Match because you had John Cena in it and John Cena is the best wrestler to date. This match had lots of extreme action and there were some good finishers in the match. When John Cena got the F-U on Christian and swung Christian's feet into Jericho and knocked him out was awesome and got him a pretty amazing win. An amazing match. 5/5

6) World Heavyweight Championship

Hell In A Cell

Batista vs. Triple H

This was an amazing Hell In A Cell match because I saw lots of weapons in the match and lots of good fighting in the match. These two men beat the hell out of eachother and it was a great match for the viewers to watch. Batista and Triple H had an excellent rivalry. When Batista left for Smackdown though, you never hear of Triple H anymore and that sucks because Triple H is an amazing fighter and so is Batista. 5/5

The total of this comes out to 24/30 which equals to an 80%. An excellent Pay Per View and one of the best ones of 2005.",1125014400,,2879,4.327746741154562
1905367,5,B0000AGQ2H,"This is w/o a doubt the most AWESOME VENGEANCE since 2002 and this was the best RAW PPV of the summer of 2005.

I mean this event was in Vegas Baby, you had 6 matches, 2 World Title Matches, and of course the Hell in a Cell and it was much better than the ones @ RAW's Bad Blood from '03 & '04.

Shelton Benjamin vs. Carlito-Rematch for the Intercontinental Championship
It was a good match, but @ the end Shelton hurt himself and lost, I feel bad for Shelton, but thank goodness he was OK.

Victoria vs. Christy Hemme-A Battle of Vengeance
1st off, All Women's Matches are not pointless, but I got to admit, neither was this match, but this match should've been longer and it awesome effort from both ladies and I was surprised to see Christy do a DDT on Victoria, but it would've been better if Victoria pulled a Widow's Peak, but she's still the winner & is 2-0 @ Vengeance, but I later found out that she was sick, but thankfully she's better, and Victoria once teamed w/Christy and they were a pretty good team, I'm just glad that Christy and Victoria are still close to this day, but I'm glad that Christy and Christian are now in TNA, I just wish that Victoria, Lita, and Jillian would join the frey if TNA DOES get their Women's Division back and make it stronger and better than what the WWE is doing nowadays, plua I would LOVE to see Beth Phoenix in TNA also.

Kane vs. Edge
AWESOME Match, I was glad when Kane got his Vengeance on Edge Lita was scared to death, I don't blame her, but she should've known not to mess w/the Big Red Monster.

Kurt Angle/HBK II-The WM21 Rematch
Another Awesome Match, HBK evening up the score against Angle w/Sweet Chin Music. GREAT MATCH!

Triple Threat Match for the WWE Championship-John Cena vs. Christian (Cage) vs. Y2J-for the 3rd @ Vengeance the WWE Championship was defended in Triple Threat Style, this was a great match, John Cena using his Death Valley Driver to pick up the win, Good Match!

and now the 4th @ final Main Event Match-Triple H/Batista III Hell in a Cell for the World Heavyweight Championship
An Awesome Match and both men have bleed, but it was The Animal @ the end using the Batista Bomb and picking up a fianl win over Triple H, Batista has defeated Triple H 3 times, and this was much better than their match @ WM21 and Backlash '05. AWESOME MATCH!

Plus a surprise appearance from The Godfather.

Also the extras were nice and awesome.
The 15 minute Press Conference w/Vinnie Mac, Bischoff, Triple H, Edge & Lita, Kurt Angle, Christy Hemme, John Cena, and Batista, but it was so funny when Triple H psyched Kurt Angle out saying ""Look, behind you it's Tazz"", also the interview w/Lilian conducted by Maria was emotional, I mean Lilian was upset when Viscera went out w/The Godfather's Escorts, also the one w/Jericho, Christian, and Tomko was hilarious, and there were a couple of them w/Triple H including when Batista and Triple H showed tremendous sportsmanship and said this is Evolution, that was a heart warming moment, and there's an extra w/Jericho, Christian, and Tomko against HBK, John Cena, and Hulk Hogan from the night after Vengeance, it was an awesome match.

This is a must have Vengeance for everyone and this was even better than the last 2 from 2003 & 2004, also I was glad to see Christian and Christy jump ship to TNA, after everthing that has been going down as of late in the WWE, I feel bad that both of them didn't get their chance to shine and win the BIG GOLD (WWE/World Title and Women's Title).

Also this was the most awesome match since the Caged Heat Match from TBS Thunder from Vegas when Sid Vicious def. Kevin Nash to regain the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, and Carlito, Kane, HBK, Cena, Batista, and Victoria have all hit the JACKPOT by winning matches, and Victoria got a HUGE pop from the fans as well, even a year later on Las Vegas Edition of Heat when she faced Cheerleader Melissa Anderson.

Also Backlash, Vengeance, Unforgiven, and Taboo Tuesday are the best RAW PPV's of 2005, and those were better than New Year's Revolution 2005.

Also that was on the week after Raven WON the NWA World Heavyweight Championship for the very 1st time.",1124582400,,4164,4.5212765957446805
1905368,5,B0000AGQ2H,"1.) Carlito vs Shelton Benjamin-Intercontinental Title
7/10- It was alright, not exactly the opening match i was expecting from 2 great wrestlers like Shelton and Carlito but it could have been worse.
2) Christy Hemme vs Victoria
3/10- Ok, I love Victoria, i think she is probably one of the best women wrestlers i've ever seen, but Christe Hemme is the exact opposite. You see, i didn't mind that she was a little slow on her first match with Trish, i mean it was her first time wrestling and was expected to be slow, but it seems like Christy has learned nothing from the matches she has wrestled.

3)Kane vs Edge
8/10- Very good match, a lot better then i was expecting. Whether you like Edge or not, you have to admit, he can wrestle, and gives pretty good matches. Same for Kane, for a big man, he can do more then most wrestlers.

4) Shawn Michaels vs Kurt Angle
10/10- This match was perfect, Shawn Michaels and Kurt Angle are just errorless when it comes to their in-ring performances.

5) John Cena vs Christian vs Chris Jericho- Triple Threat For WWE Title
9/10- When you have three very fast atheletes, you are going to get a pretty good match. John Cena is not a great wrestler, but is a great performer, which saves him. This match was set at a good length, i'm a little disappointed with the outcome of the match but still very good.

7) Batista vs Triple H- Hell In The Cell- World Title
100/10- Just the effort from both men makes this match a true classic. The chains, the sledgehammer, the steel steps, or and lets not forget, The Hell In The Cell, unforgettable. It didn't last as long as i thought it would, but really, how much more can we ask for from the two of them.

This was the best Vengeance to date. With its cons of course, but its pros makes up for it very well. WWE has done well with its ppv's so far this year.",1124496000,,1844,4.333333333333333
1905369,4,B0000AGQ2H,"WWE Intercontinental Championship

Carlito vs Shelton Benjamin 6/10- this was an average match. Raw type quality. putting the title on Carlito is a joke. he shows a little bit of wrestling ability in this match. he needs more work. Benjamin looks like he's not 100% or he's been told to dumb it down for Carlito. surprised by the length of this one. almost 20 minutes.

Victoria vs Christy Hemme 0/10- DUD! a total waste of time. Victoria as a bad girl works good if you have someone who knows how to fight. Hemme is terrible in the ring.

Edge(w/Lita) vs Kane 8.5/10- this one was much better than i anticipated. they went at it full force. a great storyline with reality mixed in. best i've seen these 2 perform. Gene Snitsky appears in this one.

Kurt Angle vs Shawn Michaels 9.5/10- an excellent match. not as good as Wrestlemania but nothing can compare to that. this match is different & stands on its own merit. is about 30 minutes long.

great interview with Batista that is interrupted by Triple H.

great in ring segment with Lilian Garcia & Viscera. very entertaining. Garcia is the best of the WWE women. surprise appearance by Godfather & Ho Train.

Triple Threat Match

John Cena vs Christian vs Chris Jericho 9/10- weird having both champions on the same program. these 3 take it to the max. Cena works well with those 2. Christian is becoming a great wrestler & Jericho can make anyone look good including Cena. great back & forth action. Cena fits better with Raw than Smackdown because of the excellent talent level. Tyson Tomko appears in this one.

Batista vs Triple H 10/10- one of the best Cell matches ever. i  thought this would be the worst one & very boring. Batista has arrived in the big time. Ttiple H shows he's still got it. this one goes almost 25 minutes. edge of your seat action with a surprise ending.

excellent extras on this DVD. several must sees! includes a match from the next night's Raw.

Shelton Benjamin vs. Carlito Caribbean Cool

This match was better than their two previous matches that they had on Raw but still failed to deliver due to Shelton's lack of charisma and the fact Carlito still looks a little too green. Shelton tried to carry this match with a couple of high flying moves here and there but to no prevail. Match Rating 7/10

Christy Hemme vs. Victoria

Wow this match was a little too.....how should I say it? Intense. But not that kind of intensity that you would expect in a Chris Benoit match. No this was the kind of ""I'll Kill You and Cut You Up Into Little Pieces!!!!"" type of intensity. Good effort but still sloppy and there were no high spots at all. Match Rating 6/10

Edge vs. Kane

At this point I was tired of seeing these two together in the same ring but they were however able to pull of a good match here tonight in Las Vegas. The last five minutes is what makes the whole match. Match Rating 8/10

Kurt Angle vs. Shawn Michaels

In my opinion...this match wasn't as good as their first match at WrestleMania. But that's not to say that this was not one hell of a match. This match once again had everything you could ask for in it just like their WrestleMania match with Angle dominating most of the match. After delivering a german suplex into the announcers table the danm table didn't break again! My Gawd! As J.R. would say. Anyway, the finish was pretty good considering that it was predictable who would go over and the finish was predictable as well but these two once again gave it their all to the fans and they once again earned my respect. Match rating 10/10

WWE Championship

Triple - Threat Match

Chris Jericho vs. Christian vs. John Cena

Praise the Lord Jericho and Christian are in a main event match! John Cena is no where near these two guys in terms of wrestling but in terms of entertainment he can hang with them. This match was entertaining and unpredictable as well which added a lot to this match. Nice turnbuckle spot with the powerbomb and superplex. Like I said before, John Cena is not that great of a wrestler but when you're in the ring with both Christian and Chris Jericho you're going to look good which john Cena did and it didn't hurt the match at all. Match Rating 10/10

World Heavyweight Championship

Hell In A Cell

Triple - H vs. Batista

Triple - H and Batista had been in two Main Event PPV matches before this and to decide a winner once and for all their last match would take place inside of Hell In A Cell. And what a battle it was! Steel Chain, Steel Steps, Sledge Hammer, The Cell Itself, and a steel chair WRAPPED IN BARBED WIRE were all weapons used in this match. This was one bloody, brutal, amazing match which saw both men give amazing performances. This is a match that cannot be missed if you're a fan of either superstar. Match Rating 10/10

WWE Vengeance 2005 scored a 51/60 which is a 85 B- (A Good PPV). I would have to agree with this score (Even though some people may not agree). Shelto/Carlito and the Women's match hurt this PPV from getting a better score. This PPV is totally worth your money if you want to buy it. Trust Me you won't be disappointed.",1123545600,2,3693,4.198863636363637
1905371,3,B0000AGQ2H,"Vengeance 2005 may be one of the best single-brand pay per views the WWE has ever put on. Done in the middle of the draft, the WWE managed to maximize its drawing power having John Cena and Batista wrestle on the same card outside of the big four pay per views.

This was certainly a solid show, although I wouldn't go too over the top.

WWE Intercontinental Championship

Carlito v. Shelton Benjamin

This was a better match then the two had on Raw a week or so prior to this show, but the match still proved to be very flat. Shelton tried very hard to carry the match but lacks the charisma to really draw the crowd into a match. Carlito at this point, is just far too green. Certainly not BAD, but very very flat indeed.

Rating: **

Victoria v. Christy

There's not much that needs to really be said about this. You won't miss anything. Poor match.

Rating: 1/4 *

Edge v. Kane

No matter how tired WWE fans were of seeing these two in the ring together, they certainly seemed to be into every bit of it in Las Vegas. Again, these two have faced each other so many times that it's become very formulaic by now, and this match was just that. Kane wins in a suprise, seeing as Edge is looking, as of the writing of this review, like he may be in the running for a WWE title reign in the near future. Fun match, but by no means good technically.

Rating: **1/4

Kurt Angle v. Shawn Michaels

Their Wrestlemania 21 match may be the best match in the WWE in the last 10 years. The psychology was there and beyond a little overselling in the end, the match is a runaway match of the year winner so far. No spectacular bumps or suicide dives came in their previous match, and this one proved no different.

The match built off of a lot of stuff that went on in the WM 21 match. Michaels not being able to straight up wrestle with Kurt and obviously trying to stay as far away from the center of the ring as he possibly could. The psychology was probobly better than the WM 21 match but there were a few problems with what I felt to be an over done ending. This comes VERY close to the Wrestlemania match, but not quite.

Rating: ***3/4

WWE Championship

John Cena (c) v. Christian v. Chris Jericho

Why Chris Jericho, who's done NOTHING but job the last two years in the WWE, was in this main event is beyond me. The WWE just doesn't seem to have any confidence in Christian's ability to headline.

Shotty booking aside, this was a very fun match. Triple threat matches are often very problematic, but this one came off fairly well. Cena looked VERY solid in this one and has proved, that although his television work leaves much to be desired, he turns it up for pay per view. There were a couple of very cool spots which make this a fun watch. Cena retains, pinning Christian after an FU.

Rating: ***

World Heavyweight Championship-- Hell in a Cell

Batista (c) v. Triple H

This is the third match in the Batista-Triple H trilogy, and in my opinion, was by far the best. Batista worked a suprsingly passable main event match with the Game at Wrestlemania 21 but looked very poor at Backlash a month later. Batista had something to prove and the hell in a cell environment is the ideal place for a green wrestler to do so.

Triple H may have put in the most gutsy performance of his career, selling for Batista and taking bumps that most wouldn't be willing to take. Barbed wire chairs, power bombs on steel steps, sledge hammer shots, chains, you name it, they used it.

I'm a big fan of wrestlers NOT leaving the cell. It defeats the purpose of the match. These two stayed in the cell. Thank god. Again, hats off to Triple H for going the extra mile in this one and making Batista look very solid. Batista also put in his fair share, but the onus lays on Triple H in this one for putting on a solid match.

Technically this is about as good as these two could do, but quite obviously was geered more towards big spots. A fun, fun match.

Rating: ***1/2

Again, this is probobly one of the top three single brand pay per views of all time next to Vengeance 2003, Backlash 2004, and maybe even No Mercy 2003. THis pay per view CERTAINLY had the attitude atmosphere with the crowd popping for pretty much everything thrown in front of them. A suprise return from the Godfather amongst other things gave this pay per view a great, great feel. Three very good matches make this pay per view certainly worth a RENT but quite possibly a BUY as well. You decide.

The detractors were certainly the early matches. This isn't a good card top to bottom like Vengeance 2003 or Backlash 2004. What it is though, is a fun pay per view. Check it out.",1123372800,2,4639,4.318339100346021

That Christy's a feisty little lady. Not much here similar to her match against Trish at Wrestlemania and yet again Christy loses. 5/10

Match 4 Kurt Angle vs Shawn Michaels

Now as much as I love Shawn Michaels I really do sometimes get bored of his matches. This however was not one of those matches! High paced and hard hitting action for most of this 20+ mins. The end saw Shawn hit Kurt with a bit of Sweet Chin Music. 9/10

Lilian Garcia, Viscera and Godfather segement.

Being about 15 minutes long this needed to be in my review. Firstly Lilian and Viscera come out and then Lilian sings to Vis a special song. Then Lilian proposes and suddeny THE GODFATHER appeared with lots of HOS. They danced around a bit and eventually Viscera chooses the HOS over Lilian and he and Godfather rode the HO TRAIN out of the arena. 6/10

Match 5 John Cena vs Y2J vs Christian WWE Title.

Ahh its good to have Cena on Raw. I hope he starts battle raps again, I'd love to see Jim Ross Rap!! Great match my personal favourite of the evening and Earl Hebners last PPV referreing!

John Cena gets the win when he picks Christian up for the FU and kicks Jericho in the face. 10/10

Match 6 HHH vs Batista Hell in a cell World Heavyweight belt

Another great match although I miss the old days when superstars would go outside the cell and fight on top of it! Better than there other encounters and a nice use of a barbed wire wrapped chair.

Match One-Intercontinental Championship-Carlito(C)Vs Shelton Benjamin-This was the rematch from Raw when Carlito got drafted and cheated to win after Benjamin injured himself during that match to gain the IC Title. This match was a great way to start this show with some quick action,some good spots and a few good near falls. The length was vey good and it was a great match all round, not a classic but still really good. My rating 8.71/10.

Match Two-Victoria Vs Christy Hemme-This was better then most womens matches and was very good by the previous matches of Christy. It was fairly good start to finish and it was rather good to watch. My rating 7.61/10.

Match Three-Kane Vs Edge-This was a lot better then I expected. I was hoping this was the big blow off to this feud but I guess I was wrong as they have had quite a few matches since. There was some interference at just the right times except it wasn't the best interference there has been before. My rating 8.01/10.

Match Four-Kurt Angle Vs ""HBK""Shawn Michaels-This was in my opinion a little bit better then their Wrestlemania classic. There was so many great spots including the ending,the table spot and many more. They worked so hard and they gave us what we wanted. These two are great wrestlers and I can't wait for their rubber match. My rating 9.81/10.

Match Five-Triple Threat-WWE Championship-John Cena(C)Vs Christian Vs Chris""Y2J""Jericho-This was a fairly good triple threat match with some great moves down and some great chemistry between these three men. There was a nice enjoyable feeling while watching this match. The ending of it is a little weak but its still a nice way to end this very good match. My rating 9.08/10.

Match Six-Main Event-Hell In A Cell-World Heavyweight Championship-Batista(C)Vs HHH-This was an awesome match with lots of great moves done with lots of weapons. They put their bodies on the line and it certainly showed in the best match these two have had. They did everything perfect from start to finish and it was a great way to end this good quality show. My rating 9.77/10.

Overall Vengeance was very good with every match being of a good quality with the last three making it to my best matches page. The score for this show was 52.99/60 which is equal to 88.31% which is an A- Excellent event, must have for anyone. Lock this one away. I definetly reccomend purchasing this great DVD, as it has great matches with some great extras. Must have for any wrestling fan.

1905377,5,B0000AGQ2H,"Once in a while, the WWE puts on a card that is damn near perfect! WWE Vengeance 2005 is one of those cards.

Carlito Vs. Shelton Benjamin - Good opener. Not really that impressed with Carlito but he plays his heel role pretty good. Shelton just didn't seem like himself in this match but still put on a good show. Match ends with Carlito baiting Benjamin into a ""Stinger Splash"" into the exposed turnbuckle. Carlito quickly pins Shelton to retain.

Christy Hemme Vs. Victoria - Worst match on the card but it was better than I thought it would be. I am glad Victoria won because Christy is pushed way too much (though that isn't totally her fault/blame the WWE management for that one)! DID like the mean streak they are trying to give her (Christy) though. If they let her grow at her own pace, she could be the one to step in one day should Trish Stratus go away. Trish, interesting enough, traveled a similar road as Christy (only she didn't strip for PLAYBOY) so she could almost be a good mentor to Christy. They ought to consider putting Trish/Christy together as a duo (kind of like Gail Kim/Molly Holly was at one point). Anyway, getting off point here! Just a random thought.

Kane Vs. Edge - Better than expected! Crowd is merciless on Lita (who admittedly was looking sexy/never had a great face but the body is on point) and deservedly so though neither man in the ring was a choir boy! Last 5 minutes makes the whole match! Kane wins with his chokeslam after surviving interference from Gene Snitzky.

Shawn Michaels Vs. Kurt Angle - I've read many that said this was better than their match at WrestleMania 21. I don't know about that as I think both matches were great but in different ways. The first time was more stalemated. It went back and forth until Angle finally took the match with the anklelock submission. This time, Angle actually controlled most of the match which included a sick German Suplex on Michaels into the announcer table which didn't break! OUCH!

Michaels had to fight from behind moreso in this one than in the first encounter. Ending mirrored the RAW classic between Michaels/Shelton Benjamin just weeks before this match! Didn't look as devestating but it was a good way to end it. Great match by both men.

John Cena Vs. Christian Vs. Chris Jericho - In the first WWE title match on a RAW PPV (and the first one called by Jim Ross & Jerry Lawler in years), Cena came out looking great. Of course, when you have the talented Christian and Y2J working the match with you, you are going to look decent! Nice looking triple slam near the end of the match! Cena wins after great back and forth action.

Batisa Vs. HHH - I have seen nearly every Hell In The Cell on PPV since the match was introduced in 1997. This match has to be in the top 5! I'd stop short of calling it the best HITC ever but its definitely in the top 5.

What I like most about this match is that it was settled inside the Cell. Not that I didn't like them fighting on top of the Cell but most guys can't/won't do what Mick Foley did in his HITC encounters with The Undertaker and HHH nor should they be expected to do so.

I also liked the strategic use of weapons. It wasn't a weapon-fest but they used it at very logical times! The match is a long one but its worth every minute to watch! Great main event!

Extras include Triple H being helped from the ring to a near standing ovation. Not a ""Game"" fan but he deserved the appalause. Also shows an interview with Flair and HHH afterwards were Batista makes an unexpected appearance! What happens there may shock you!

Also has the press conference that took place the week of Vengeance and as a bonus match, it has John Cena, Shawn Michaels & Hulk Hogan Vs. Chris Jericho, Christian and Tyson Tomko!

Great card and pretty good DVD!",1122681600,5,3797,4.439655172413793

A pretty good match. Carlito did his same old cheating routine and Benjamin did his same old extreme moves. Pretty entertaining, but had some slumps. The ending could have been better.

Pretty average woman's match. Victoria is still good at playing the crazy chick, but Christy over-acted most of the match.

Intercontinental Championship
Carlito (champion) vs. Shelton Benjamin
---This is the rematch from 6 days prior when Carlito mirrored his ""SmackDown"" debut (cheating to win the U.S. title from John Cena).  This match reaffirms my theory that Carlito is following the tradition of heels like The Honky-Tonk Man.  He's a great character and villain, but his ring-work needs a lot of improvement.  What's very shocking is that Benjamin isn't very exhilerating ere, either.  There were good spots, but too much time was spent on Benjamin's injured head.  This match is merely okay.
""6.0 out of 10""
________________________________________________

Victoria vs. Christy Hemme
---Here's a shocker...the WWE women are hot and gorgeous, but very few, if any, can wrestle.  I sincerely hope this isn't the future of women's wrestling.  Hemme hasn't been good since winning the Diva Contest, but Victoria deserves better.  This is a ferocious catfight that isn't as bad as I thought it would be, but it's still a waste of time.
""3.0 out of 10""
________________________________________________

Edge vs. Kane
---This feud had gone on too long, but here it would finally end.  A very solid grudge match, but the ending is great fun.  Interference and chaos ensued throughout the final 4 minutes!  I didn't have much faith in this one, but Edge and Kane didn't disappoint me.
""7.0 out of 10""
________________________________________________

Kurt Angle vs. Shawn Michaels
---I have a confession...even though the ""WrestleMania 21"" match between these two has grown on me, I didn't think it was the classic everyone made it out to be.  Though not as good as their first matchup, this is a very good rematch.  It has a good pace and features some sweet spots.  Jim Ross informed us that we were going to see ""a very strategic contest,"" which helped me better appreciate the slower-paced fight HBK and Angle were going to give us.  The slow moments are entertaining in the way that only Shawn Michaels can sell to an audience, and Kurt Angle is still the greatest technical wrestler since Bret Hart.  I do think the finish is totally telegraphed, but otherwise, a very good match.
""7.5 out of 10""
________________________________________________

WWE Championship
Chris Jericho vs. Christian vs. John Cena (champion)
---I do not like John Cena as much as everybody else does.  Yes, he's a very charismatic performer who has great microphone skills.  But his wrestling seems to be Goldberg-style, where no matter how badly he does, everybody will cheer for him because his finishing moves are so cool-looking.  However, this was a great match!  This is one of the best Triple Threat matches ever!  I haven't seen 3-Way action this good since SummerSlam 1999 (excluding Triangle Tag Team matches).  It's fast-paced, is filled with those great long two-counts, and made each of these guys possible winners.  I was cheering for Christian in this one, but I'll let you watch and enjoy the suspense.  What a surprisingly terrific match!
""9.0 out of 10""
________________________________________________

Hell-In-A-Cell Match for the World Championship
Triple H vs. Batista (champion)
---For once, this rivarly was going to end!  The ""Backlash 2005"" rematch I didn't mind because it was better than the ""WrestleMania 21"" main event between these two.  But Hell-In-A-Cell, how good could it be?  Excellent match, actually, and the best Hell-In-A-Cell match since ""Judgment Day 2002"".  Yes, the ones in between were good, but this one is brutal.  The staircase, the Cell wall, a barbed-wire chair, and a sledgehammer are a few of the toys that these men beat each other with.  This one is non-stop brutality.  It doesn't have those memorable moments like Mick Foley's Cell matches, or any shocking plot twists.  But two men enter this vile structure and constantly birage each other with fierce hatred.  My only complaint is that the blood seems obligatory, and not realistically shed.  But who cares?  This is a great finale to a rivalry that desperately needed to end.  I am left with applause and admiration for these two!

well, raw has better talent, i.e. kurt, hhh, hbk, and defentialy not john cena, he sucks. shelton is great and they have a better gm. although smackdown has better potential, such as christian, batista(not ready for world champ quite yet) orton, rey, i think he will be getting a push soon, and as soon as JBL becomes champ again, smackdown will be better. smackdown should go over the top more and try to put on a better show like raw dose. if smackdown would stop booking all big guy matches and have somthing like chiristian vs. orton. that would be cool if it was a street fight or somthing of that nature. bottom line is smackdown has all the potential to be the better show, they just don't know how to use it.

by the way. vengeance 2005 was great. hes a review of the matches that matter

kane vs. edge- 9/10. fairly fast paced concidering kane was in it. this was a great match and did a fantastic job of telling the story. i jus wish lita would have gotten her throte crushed.

hbk(god) vs. kurt(god) in the best match of all time. 10000/10

this match was better than the wrestlemania match becuause it seemed to have a faster pace, and hbk won, although hbk vs. kurt at mania is the 2ed best match of all time, this is the very best match you will ever see. to hell with rock vs. hogan. that match sucked. both of them did. the triple threat at wrestlemania 20, sucked terribaly. this match and there first one at wrestle mania 21 are the only matches u need, except hbk/jericho at WM19 and hhh/cactus streetfight/hell in a cell.

hell in a cell. Big Dave vs. HHH(god) 9/10

wow, this match surprised me, i thought it was gunna be the same as big daddy cool / hhh hell in a cell, don't get me wrong, i like that match. it was a little slow paced though. this match was a decent pace and my god it was brutal as all hell. some new weapons were used such as a barbed wire steel chair. this was a very inovative HIAC, although i like batista, i like triple h waaaaaayyyy more and he shouldnt have lost hell in a cell, and if he had to, at least make him lose to someone better than batista. anyways, this match was awesom and was brutal as hell. buy this dvd.",1121731200,2,3312,4.34789644012945

So much back and forth technical action, it was crazy! Benoit is about to have the match won until Rhyno shows up, turns on him and gores the crap out of him. Guererro capitalizes and gets the win and becomes the new United States Champion! Benoit should have won...10/10

Match #2 Jamie Noble vs. Billy Gunn for the opportunity to sleep with Torrie Wilson on Smackdown!: Crap...that's all I can say about this. Jamie Noble wins by rolling up Gunn after he bumped into Torrie on the apron...2/10

Match #3 APA Bar Room Brawl: More CRAP! This was nothing but a cluster (ya know)! I don't know how people were eliminated and how Bradshaw ended up winning but he did! Sean O'haire should have won...4/10

Match #4 WGTT vs. Mysterio and Kidman: WOW! This got the show back where it needed to be! Kidman and Rey almost had it so many times but WGTT kept kicking out! WGTT finally wins with the Dooms Day Device on Rey to retain the gold...GREAT MATCH! 9/10

Match #5 Sable vs. Stephanie McMahon in a Cat Fight: zzzZZZzzz...bathroom break...zzzZZZZZzzz...oh wait it's..A-Train..zzzZZZzz...Sable wins cuz of A-Train, crap! 0/10

Match #6 John Cena vs. The Undertaker: SPECTACULAR! One of Cena's best wrestling matches to date! This back when he was a heel and he was AWESOME! He needs to revisit these days and fast! Cena almost has Taker numerous times and he busts his ribs making him bleed from the mouth...but Taker hits the Last Ride for the win after Cena makes the mistake that everyone makes while trying to beat Taker's face against the turnbuckle but ends up getting power bombed! 9.5/10

Match #7 Zach Gowen vs. Vince McMahon: UGH! Why on Earth was Zach Gowen ever brought into the WWE??? Oh yeah cuz he was a novelty act, DUH! A ""decent"" match and I'm somewhat exaggerating...Vince bleeds like crazy but still ends up getting the pin...6/10

Match #8 Kurt Angle vs. Big Show vs. Brock Lesnar (c) for the WWE Championship: This was good but I can't say it was great. I think it was obvious Brock was going to lose and go heel after this. I still think Kurt should have stepped aside here and let someone else beat Brock. And the ending wasn't even climactic, it just ended. Kurt hits Brock with an Angle Slam and pins him for the win! 8/10

It got a 48.5/100 which is an F! The matches that got an 8 or higher are definitely worth viewing though if you get a chance but overall this was def a sucky PPV! CIAO!",1121644800,,2638,4.560253699788584

Heath Match: Hurrican and Rosey (c) vs. The Heartthrobs for the World Tag Team Championship: This of course was on Heat, but was a great start to get the crowd going! Stacy is so HOTT!!!

Match #1 Carlito (c) vs. Shelton Benjamin for the IC Title: I still think it sucks Carlito is champ cuz he is not that good of a wrestler. If he was gonna win it should have been here and not on RAW! Anyways Shelton pummels Carlito all over the place and totally carried the match. Carlito takes the padding off the turnbuckle, Shelton nails it, then Carlito rolls him up with a fist full of tights to retain! Not bad...7/10

Match #2 Christy Hemme vs. Victoria: This was a beer and bathroom break for me! I was disappointed though cuz right when I got back Victoria's music plays showing she won the match, dangit! She rolled Christy up with her hands on the ropes for the pin...the right person won here! 5/10 for Victoria!

Match #3 Edge vs. Kane: This was surprisingly better then I thought it would be. Kane's entrance is HOT literally!!! Snitsky interferred constantly! And when Lita had her head put in between the steel chair, you know that someone would come break it up. Edge accidently hits Snitsky with the briefcase and then gets chokeslammed to hell by Kane...1...2...3! Lita runs up the ramp watching Kane celebrate over Edge and Snitsky's lifeless corpses, good ending! 9/10

Match #4 Kurt Angle vs. Shawn Michaels in a WM21 rematch: YES, YES, YES!!! When this was announced to be on the card, I went flippin' CRAZY!!! Their match at WM21 was one of the best ever and I knew this would be the same if not better! These two definitely did not disappoint and put on a hell of a wrestling match with plenty of nice spots included!! Match was just as long as their mania match. You knew HBK would win but it got to the point where you thought he was gonna tap over and over! Kurt goes to the top turnbuckle only to jump right into HBK's superkick!!! What a finish, what a match!!! 10/10

Lillian Garcia and Viscera in the ring: This was quite humorous! First Lillian serenades Big Vis and then gets on one knee and asks him to marry her!!! You just knew someone was gonna come out! I seriously thought Trish would make her return here and bring out the Masterpiece to challenge Vis...but instead we got the GODFATHER and his fine hos!!! the crowd was yelling for Big Vis to not marry Lillian, it was hilarious! Big Vis decides to ride the Ho Train thus breaking Lillian's heart...poor Lillian! 8/10 it was FUNNY!

Match #5 Chris Jericho vs. Christian vs. John Cena (c) for the WWE Championship: When was the last time two world titles were on the line in a single brand PPV...how about NEVER! This match surprised the hell out of me because it was actually quite good! Christian and Jericho carried the match and made Cena look a lot better then he really is! A nice spot in the match came when Jericho was gonna superplex Christian, and at the same time Cena powerbomb Jericho...it was SICK!!! Cena retains after giving Christian the FU! Note: When the DVD comes out watch this match and look for a guy in the crowd with a yellow sign that reads ""Captain Charisma is Goin' Gold!"" That is me! 9/10

Match #6 Batista (c) vs. HHH in a Hell in a Cell match for the World Heavyweight Championship: This was an AMAZING main event!!! Anyone who is not a mark for Batista seriously needs to watch this match because they will be afterwards! So many weapons were used here like a chain, steel steps, the damn sledgehammer, and a steel chair wrapped in barbed wire!!! batista pretty much dominated most of the match, and the only time I slightly doubted he would win was when HHH hit the Pedigree. Batista spine busted HHH on the steel steps and went for a Batista Bomb. HHH was up in the air about to hit Batista with the sledgehammer when all of a sudden WHAMMY! BATISTA BOMB to retain the title! After Batista had celebrated his victory and walked to the back, HHH recieved a standing ovation as Ric Flair helped to the back! AWESOME MATCH! 10/10!!!

Vengeance 2005 got a 67/80 giving it a B! Well I still give it an A+++ cuz when the good matches were on, they were on!!! I can't wait for the DVD to come out to remind me of how great a time I had! I STRONGLY recommend this PPV!",1121644800,,4708,4.408515535097814

The Hell In A Cell match was even more brutal than you will expect it to be. The WWE title match was suprisingly a good match.  Kane v.s Edge was pritty good.  The only filler match was victoria v.s christy. The godfather even came back and saved the vicera segment. This ppv was awesome!!!,1121558400,2,395,4.472222222222222

1905396,5,B0000AGQ2H,"Vengeance 2005 was one of the best ppvs of the year. With the second match of the HBK/Kurt Angle fued, and the end of the HHH/Batista fued, the atmoshpere was at an all time high.

Intercontinental Championship

Carlito [Champion] vs. Shelton Benjamin:

Nice way to start off the show. Carlito and Benjamin have what it takes to be the future of this business. Back and forth action, with Carlito even trying to leave in the middle of the match. In the end Shelton tries to do a big splash in the corner but Carlito moves and dropkicks Benjamin to make him go face first into the top turnbuckle. Carlito wins. 8/10

Christy Hemme vs. Victoria:

Not very good of a match, the women's division is at an all time low. Anyway there was a lot of hair pulling and kicking by both women. The crowd itself actually booed Christy. In the end Victoria wins with the help of the ring ropes.

Kane vs. Edge:

A lot of power moves by Kane, and a lot of ""You screwed Matt!"" chants by the crowd at Edge and Lita. It wasn't the fastest paced matches, but the crowd was into the match. Kane even almost takes out Lita after putting a chair around her neck, then Snitsky interferes, but then Edge takes Snitsky out with the briefcase by accident. Kane chokeslams Edge for the win. 7/10

HBK/Angle 2:

Another great match between these two guys. It was so intense at the last 10 minutes. Angle suplexing HBK all over the ring, then HBK giving Angle chops and attempting the superkick, great stuff. Angle even suplexes HBK onto the announce table. In the end HBK gives the superkick to Angle when Angle goes off the top rope for the win. 10/10

WWE Championship

Triple Threat Match

John Cena [Champion] vs. Chris Jericho vs. Christain:

Fast paced action at its finest. All three men worked very well together. The fought all over the arena and around the ring. Highlights include Cena giving Jericho a powerbomb as Jericho gave Christain a superplex at the same time. Cena wins a great match after giving Christain the FU for the win. 10/10

World Heavyweight Championship

Hell in a Cell

Batista [champion] vs. HHH:

What a way to end a rivalry. Both men get cut open and bleed heavily. HHH pulls out a chair wrapped in barb wire, and both men manage to get to use it on each other. Steel steps, a sledghammer, and a steel chain all make appearances in the match, and both men took a lot of punishment.

Other highlights include HHH using the cage against Batista and choking him with the steel chain, then Batista gives a huge spinebuster on the steel steps to HHH. The end has Batista giving the Batista Bomb to HHH to retain the title. 10/10

Vengeance is definatley worth it. Just remember, July 26, see the madness firsthand.",1121126400,3,2715,4.515337423312883
1905397,5,B0000AGQ2H,"Last years Vengeance sucked. I wasn't even going to get Vengeance 2005 until they had Kane vs Edge and Shawn Michaels vs Kurt Angle 2. The whole stage was sweet and all the wrestlers seemed like they really wanted to wrestle which made it even better and not just out there for there match. Some had personal reasons for being out there like...

Christy vs Victoria

Which was stupid typical girls match would have been better if Stacy was in it so atleast we have someone hot!!! im getting real sick of Christy. Then

Carlito vs Shelton Benjamin

Which was a good match with Carlito winning why he's a complete loser.

Kane vs Edge

One of the matches I wanted to really see. Last year at Backlash I think it was Backlash Kane and Edge squared off in a return match for Edge so I knew what was going to happen with Edge winning but diffrent story this year these two have been building up rage forever and obviously Kanes got more. I think Edge got 2 moves in on this one Kane just exploded over Edge which I thought was going to be the other way around. Gene Snitsky came out and Kane beat the hell out of him to then Lita came in so it was those three on Kane which Kane very quickly overpowered all of them. Ended with a massive chokeslam on Edge. bad thing about match was that Kane had Lita by the throat and couldn't do anything to her but he setteled that the next night on Raw anways. Probaly best match of the night but overseen by the Hell In A Cell match.

Shawn Michaels vs Kurt Angle

This was 10 times better then there Wrestlemania 21 match with Shawn picking up a huge win over Kurt even though this is Kurt Angles first Raw PPV since the draft.

John Cena vs CLB vs Y2J

Great match with the Smackdown champion picking up a big win over both superstars by doing a great FU.

Batista Vs HHH

Best Hell In A Cell match that I have ever seen and i've seen alot. HHH had Batista in several spots which got me real nervous but in the end Batista did the sit down powerbomb for the win. Great match 3 in a row Batista ending HHH's Hell In A Cell winning streak.",1121040000,,2073,4.180904522613066
1905399,4,B0000AGQ2H,"The Heat Match was for the RAW Tag Team Championship
--Hurricane and Rosey vs. Heart Throbs
----The superchamps won when Hurricane pinned someone. ***

The First Match of the PPV was for the IC Championship
--Carlito vs. Shelton Benjamin
----Now I am NO Benjamin fan, however Carlito is the worst character ever even more so than Savio Vega. Carlito pinned Benjamin after Benjamin hit the exposed turn buckle, that Carlito exposed, to retain his dirtily won title and forever tarnishing the IC Championship. ***

Christy Hemmi vs Victoria
--Snooze Fest big time Hemmi is fun to look at, that is it she is not a wrestler and will never be one so she just needs to stay on the mic and in the back looking good. Victoria pinned Christy, using the ropes for an unclean win, as if Victoria could not win clean. ***

WM21 Rematch
--Kurt Angle vs HBK
----HBK pins Angle after hitting the Sweet Chin Music as Angle was coming off the top rope. This was a real great match, these two can work together and they can work real well together. *****

WWE Championship Triple Threat Match
--John Cena vs Christian vs Y2J
----This was one of the best matches since the creation of the Triple Threat Match. When Cena gave Jericho a powerbomb while Jericho gave Christian a suplex at the same time that was just a great spot. The end had John Cena giving the FU to Christian and taking out Jericho at the same time. Cena pins the CLB Christian. *****

Kane vs Edge
--Real entertain match, Kane has gotten so good at storytelling in the ring and bell to bell, Snizkey tried to interfere, no dice Gene, Kane was all over it. Kane pins Edge after a chokeslam right to hell. ****

World Heavyweight Championship Hell in the Cell Match
--Big Dave Batista vs Paul HHH Levesque
----Batista just beat the hell out of HHH. HHH got some good ones in on Dave but when Dave Spinebusted HHH on the steel steps that was cool. Batista gave me a lot of WWE Fantasy points on this night. Batista beats HHH and ends his undefeated streak. With Batista now working on Tuesday Nights, HHH may now be able to win the WWE Title on Monday Nights. *****",1120867200,,2112,4.486979166666667

1905401,3,B0000AGQ2H,"WOW! Vengeance has got to be the best Raw brand ppv ever.

The matches are

1. Carlito vs Shelton Benjamin- I.C title

 This was a surprisingly good match with loads of near falls and the crowd was actually cheering for Carlito which was strange. Benjamin was impressive as always and it was Carlito's best match yet in the wwe. 7.5/10

2. Victoria vs Christy Hemme

 Not that good of a womens match,it was more of a cat fight mixed with some wrestling. Christy just isn't ready to wrestle yet. It is definately watchable though with some decent offense by Victoria. 5/10

3. Kane vs Edge

 I wasn't really looking forward to this match as there past encounters have been average at best but this was a Very entertaining match. Good effort by both men and easily there best match together. The overbooking really made the end more exciting. This was Edge's 1st loss on ppv this year which made me happy. 7/10

4. Shawn Michaels vs Kurt Angle

 One of the best matches in the history of wrestling. Absolutely

brilliant, i don't know how shawn and kurt do it but this match shows just how talented they really are. Theres brawling, technical wresling and some great spots including a german suplex onto the annouance table which didn't budge at all and a wicked powerbomb into the top turnbuckle. I could go on and on but all you need to know is that this is an almost perfect match. The only thing i can think of against it is that there Wrestlemania match was slightly more special to me. 10/10

We then get a segment with Lillian asking Viscera to marry him. A waste of time but it was really just used to give us a break from the action as we did just watch the best match we may ever see so it does serve its purpose...i suppose.

5. John cena vs Chris Jericho vs Christian - WWE Championship

Great match and effort by all 3 men. Soo much better than i expected. Probably in the top 5 best triple threat matches ever in the WWE.John cena suits this match very well and he gives his best performance yet. Lots of false finishes and some great moves such as the powerbomb superplex keep this mach feeling fresh and exciting.  8.5/10

6. Batista vs HHH - Hell in a cell Worldheavyweight Championship

I was shocked at just how good this match was, a brutal hardcore hell in a cell match with chains, barb wire steel chairs and the steel steps were all brought into use, the cell wasn't actually used that much due to the other weapons being used. Highlights include a spine buster into the steel steps  and Batista actually kicked out of a pedigree. Easily the match of Batista's life and a great effort by HHH. 9/10

overall 9/10

Shelton Benjamen vs. Carlito.

Great opener. They put on a solid performance. Lot of Carlito chants and anti Benjamen chants. I was cheering for Benjamen. Very exiting with around six close falls. Carlito won. 8/10

Victora vs. Christy

This match was a dud. Christy can't wrestle for beans. The match on heat was better. The women's division is garbage. I give it a 3/10

Edge vs. Kane.

This match was cool! Everyone was chanting you screwed Matt the whole time. Kane avoided every obsticle by snitsky and Edge. When Kane chokeslamed edge my seat rumbled. It was exicting. I give it a 9/10

Shawn Michaels vs. Kurt Angle.

This match wasn't better than there match at Wrestlemania but this one didn't disappoint . A lot of near falls. HBK won. A lot of bumps. I give it a 9/10

John Cena vs. Chris Jericho vs. Christain

Not a slow moment in this match. Cena won. A great moves by the three. I give it a 9/10

Batista vs. Triple H. Hell in a Cell.

Best match of the night. Brutal with all the objects. Batista won. Ending Triple H's Winning streak. I give it a 10/10

Match One-US Championship-Chris Benoit Vs Eddie Guerrero-This was for the recently reinstated US Championship. This was a great match and I was really surprised to see this open the show. It was an absolute awesome display of wrestling and it showed what these two men are about. Rhyno interferes at the end of this match which knocks it down a bit but still a great match and a good start to this show. My rating 8.38/10.

Match Two-Jamie Noble Vs Bily Gunn-This was an alright match except if Jamie Noble won he would get to sleep with Billy Gunns Valet Torrie Wilson. This was good except Billy hasn't done much since returning. I believe he should change his gimmick back to ""badass"" Billy Gunn and bring back Road Dogg and have the New Age Outlaws running wild over smackdown. My rating 6.46/10.

Match Three-APA Barroom Brawl-There were lots of competitors in this short five minute brawl. Most of these people were midcarders or people who have no direction. It wasn't much of wrestling but it was still a good laugh and enjoyable. My rating 6.14/10.

Match Four-WWE Tag Team Championship-Charlie Haas & Shelton Benjamin(C)Vs Rey Mysterio & Billy Kidman-This was a nice match. This was the first time Kidman & Mysterio have teamed in WWE and they did a great job. They also used to team in WCW which would have been a great addition if they were in the Invasion angle. This match was absolutely awesome until a bit of a cheap ending. My rating 8.16/10.

Match Five-Sable Vs Stephanie McMahon-This was pood like most womens matches with two non wrestlers going against each other. It was fairly short at least which was a good thing. To make this mess of a match more confusing and messed up they had A-Train intefering which was absolutely confusing. Get this off the great card we've witnessed so far. My rating 0/10.

Match Six-Undertaker Vs John Cena-Thia was a good match it had the right length and it told  the story which they'd been trying to get to everyone the story of ""respect"". This match taught Cena to respect and he started getting pops for it from the crowd. This match had a lot of brawling and the ending had been used a bit to much now. The ending was good the first time but now its overused heaps. My rating 7.53/10.

Match Seven-Vince McMahon Vs Zach Gowen-This was a brutal match considering Gowen only has one leg. They did everything they could and Vince was a bloody mess which is always good to see. My rating 6.49/10.

Match Eight-Main Event-Triple Threat-WWE Championship-Kurt Angle Vs Brock Lesnar(C)Vs Big Show-This was awesome with lots of weapons and finishers used. The right man won and i believe Lesnar should turn heel now as he's done everything he could as a face. Good solid match to end this fairly good PPV on. My rating 7.85.

This was a good PPV and it scored 510.10/800 which is 63.76% which is a good score and it is equal to a B-. This was a good PPV and it deserved its rating. I would definetly purchase this DVD and just skip the womens match.",1119571200,,3503,4.658456486042693

1905405,3,B0000AGQ2H,"EDDIE GUERRERO defeated CHRIS BENOIT in the Final of the U.S Title Tournament: The first 10 minutes of this 22 minute bout was very methodical & had the dual purposes of establishing Eddie's 'Lie, Cheat & Steal' heel character, while showing how well these 2 know each other's style. It was storytelling at it's best, although it was probably a little too methodically paced for my liking. But when that timeframe included some great counters & reversals, while being excellently performed, who's going to complain? The pace picked up from there, as did the variety of moves. However, it all resulted in an overbooked finish which included a ho-hum Rhyno heel turn. Could have been better, but still very good. Match Rating...8

JAMIE NOBLE defeated BILLY GUNN in an Indecent Proposal Match: As stupid as the feud was (Noble got to sleep with Torrie Wilson if he won), this match was more than watchable. It was only 5 minutes in length, but that sort of worked in its favor. During that time, the pace never let up, the intensity was good, and the 2 styles complemented each other surprisingly well. Hell, Noble actually made Gunn look strong by selling his offense superbly. And Gunn's offense thankfully included some new moves here. Probably a little kind on the rating, but I thought it was good. Match Rating...7

BRADSHAW Won The A.P.A Invitational Bar-Room Brawl: This one is very hard to explain. A little bar set had been built near the entrance ramp & basically wrestlers from the past & present (plus the Easter Bunny) fought there. Totally stupid, but all in good fun. A few cool spots, but nothing too noteworthy. 7 minutes to interview & introduce. 4 minutes to complete. Match Rating...4

CHARLIE HAAS & SHELTON BENJAMIN defeated BILLY KIDMAN & REY MYSTERIO to retain the WWE Tag-Team Championships: Absolutely superb match which is the way I want to see tag-team wrestling; Great & innovative double-teaming, good psychology & a spot or 2 as the cherry on top. This 15 minute bout also summed up SmackDown at the time (& what it still could be now, some 2 years later), as you had the cruiserweights on one side & the modernized amateurs on the other. Everything clicked & all 4 men performed very well. Top notch stuff. Match Rating...9

SABLE defeated STEPHANIE McMAHON in a No Count-Out Catfight: I remember that this feud took up way too much tv time leading into this PPV, and even worse, it took up too much time on this night as well. 7 minutes was just way too long for the skills that these 2 non-wrestlers possessed. The intensity was there to some extent, but not much else. To top it all off, A-Train (who wasn't even involved in the feud at the time) ran in to cost Steph the bout. Match Rating...3

THE UNDERTAKER defeated JOHN CENA: Cena was the heel here, but he was already starting to get a cheer here & there. This feud was based upon respect, with the veteran 'Taker suggesting that the rookie didn't show enough of it. Badly booked to begin with, as 'Taker literally controlled the entire first 6 minutes, until he pulled Cena up from a 2 count. From there, Cena found some much needed intensity (which can be one of his main strengths when he is on top of his game) & targetted the ribs of The Undertaker (even causing some so-called internal bleeding). The bout just meandered along after that. It seemed awkward in pacing, psychology & it's fluidity. 'Taker kicked out of the FU (yes, it has happened before) & won the bout at the 16 minute mark with his Last Ride Powerbomb. You can see what was attempted here, but it didn't really work. While 'Taker sold a lot in the middle portions of the match, he controlled the beginning & kicked out of his opponent's finisher, while bleeding internally, at the end... Hmmmm! Nothing terrible though. Match Rating...6

VINCE McMAHON defeated ZACH GOWEN: As can be expected, a great introductory video preceded this bout. The story was very much there with Vince playing himself & Zach playing the one-legged man. The feud really does write itself. Unfortunately, so did the match; Vince shows his greater strength at the start. Then, in the best part of the match, Zack brings his offense (including a great Asai moonsault). Vince then targets the leg, until a tired Zach makes the comeback. Unfortunately, 14 minutes may have been too long for Gowen, as his final comeback was very sloppy. This included a chairshot to Vince to make him literally gush blood out of his forehead like never before. Not terrible, but not Vince vs Hogan either. Match Rating...5

KURT ANGLE defeated BROCK LESNAR & THE BIG SHOW in a No Disqualification Triple Threat Match to Win the WWE Championship: Strange match due to a combination of the triple threat stipulations & indifferent crowd reactions. It actually possibly put over the triple threat side of things more than any other similar bout, but I'm unsure that's a good thing. As for the crowd, TBS was the only real heel in the bout, but you could hardly tell. However, all in all, hard work by the 3 combatants made this match a resounding success. A little too spotty, but when the spots include a Lesnar running powerbomb on TBS & an Angle Slam on TBS into the Spanish commentary desk, then how can we complain? Lesnar was phenomenal here. Match Rating...8

PPV RATING (50/80) = 63

Looking at the key, I have basically given 'Vengeance' 2003 a 'C+' grade & said that it was 'Worth a Watch'. I would say that rating is probably a little harsh & is dragged down by 2 non-wrestling matches, plus another wrestling match that was predominantly storyline based. There are 3 tremendous bouts on this ppv (rating 8 out of 10 or above), plus 2 pretty good ones. So all in all, this event is most definitely worth a watch. I wouldn't go as far as agreeing with some people that this was the 2003 ppv of the year. But in an ordinary year, it wasn't too far from it.",1114732800,,5882,4.648076923076923

((Not on a card in Vengeance)) were there,I'll tell you my favorite spots here. ***Spoilers..I guess*** 1. Easter Bunny getting shoved in that panel thingy. 2. V-1AAAAHH!! Legdrop on a table with the Bashams on it. 3. Shannon Moore Doin' a Somersoult(sp?) from the top onto Sean'OHaire! 8/10.

4. WWE Tag Team Championship,Billy Kidman & Rey Mysterio Vs. Worlds Greatest Tag-Team.

Thought it was over after Rey hit that Frankensteiner off the the top rope on Haas,Great finish With the WGTT Retaining. 10/10.

5. Sable Vs. Steph.

Nice match,Stephanie shows her rage on Sable,Not alot of moves were done here,and it was pretty short. Sure the Women don't know how to sell the moves but...anyway Nice looking Spear by Steph. A-Train comes into this match and Costs Steph the match. This sets up Steph Vs. Vinny Mac & 'Taker Vs. A-Train. 8/10.

What a way to kick off the show.  Best opening match of a PPV for 2003.  This is a back and forth, technical classic between the two.  Good pace throughout the match.  There are a lot of near falls.  The finish is exciting, but a bit disappointing.  Rhyno makes an appearance in the match.  One of the top ten matches of the year in my opinion.  (9/10)

Jaime Noble vs. Billy Gunn - This was the worst match of the night and only last a few minutes. Jaime Noble wins and gets the chance to sleep with torrie, which never in a million years would happen anyway. 6/10

APA Barroom Brawl - This was more of a comedy than an actual fight. Too many people in my opinion, but it was a great idea for all the less known talent to get a chance to be on the card. The easter bunny is involved in a very funny moment near the end. Bradshaw wins the Brawl. 8/10 for the comedy instead of the fight.

WGTT vs. Billy Kidman and Rey Mysterio - best match of the night and I was very shocked to see that it wasn't even a match of the year candidate. Lots of action and near falls, fast paced and exciting. WGTT gets the pinfall after an exciting double team maneuver. Come back WGTT!! 10/10

Undertaker vs. John Cena - A great fight between these two, this match should have a little shorter, but was still great. Third best match of the night. The undertaker wins after the last ride. 8.5/10

Undetaker vs. Zack Gowen - Oh boy, Zack, Zack, Zack, you were here for less than a year yet still it seems like so much longer, and I don't mean that in a good way. I knew this was a bad idea about having a one legged kid in the wwe. And when he fought Mr. McMahon I instantly knew who was going to win. It was cool though when Vince got busted wide open. Mr. McMahon wins. 7.5/10

Stephanie vs. Sable - A true catfight with no countouts in it. Stephanie looked really nice in her wrestling gear and sable was okay also {I'm not exactly her number one fan} A-Train comes out of nowhere and crushes Stephanie which allowed Sable the win. 7/10, this was just for Stephanies wrestling gear, hot, hot, hot!

Triple Threat No Disqualification match: Brock Lesnar vs. Kurt Angle vs. Big Show - The No Disqualification stipulaion saved it in my opinion. A great match, the second best of the night. Trash can lids, chairs, and announce tables were all used in this match. Best moments were when Kurt gave the Angle Slam to the Big show through the announce table, and when Brock powerbombed Big Show off the top rope. Kurt wins after giving another Angle Slam to Brock Lesnar. 9.5/10

Outstanding chemistry and psychology with these two. Neither one are anything close to mat masters, but IMO, didn't really need it. The build up to the match was great and Gowen held his own. The chair spot at the end is pretty wicked! Good match overall.

The Undertaker v. John Cena ****1/2

I loved this match. These guys really put a lot into it, and both did a brilliant job playing into their storyline. Really good in ring work with the two as well. The ending was even appropriate... I really do prefer a heel cena... works much better then his dopey character nowadays.

WWE Championship Triple Threat Match

Brock Lesnar (c) v. Kurt Angle v. The Big Show ****1/2

Another great match. Triple Threats usually aren't anything to be excited about, but these guys had the timeing right, their spots worked well, and it wasn't a total finisher-fest. Great moment with Angle winning the title in the end. Even Big Show, who's usually slow and plodding, really held up his end of the bargain in this match. Great show finisher.

Overall, this is an excellent ppv. Even the matches I rated low, were very entertaining.

Matches:
Finals of the United States Championship Tournament:
Eddie Guerrero vs. Chris Benoit
Great Match.  Almost 25 minutes long!!! Main event material.  Slighlty dissapointing ending with Rhyno goring benoit giving Guerrero the win brings this match down to a ****8/10
Jamie Noble vs. Billy Gunn (w/ Torrie Wilson)
Torrie Wilson looked hot on the outside.  Couldn't really pay attention to the dull 3 minute match with torrie on the outside.  The match was ok, but I don't really like either of these men, just torrie, lol.  Just because torrie was there, i give this ***.  If torrie wasn't there, it would be about *1/2

TWGTT vs. Rey Mysterio & Billy Kidman
Very fast paced exciting match.  However, it was missing something.  I am not sure what, but the match never had a turning point.  Amazing shooting star press on TWGTT by Kidman.  ****7/10
Zach Gowen vs. Mr. McMahon
Very bloody match.  Much better than I expected.  Zach Gowen isn't half bad.  McMahon almost lost, but it was obvious he would win in the end.  pretty good match ***
Stephanie McMahon vs. Sable
One of the best women matches ever! They actually wrestled.  Both women were almost topless, and A-Train interfered. Very good match except the ending. Sable wins.  ***
New School vs. Old School
John Cena vs. Undertaker
Great match.  The right man went down.  Great wrestling, one of Cena's best matches.  Although this match was awesome, it was a little slow. Undertaker wins.  ****7/10
Triple Threat for the WWE Championship:
Big Show vs. Kurt Angle vs. Brock Lesnar
Wonderful match.  Best of the night. Finally, a worthy main event.  Great Hardcore match with mostly only lesnar and angle involved.  Show was the only thing that slowed it down a bit, but luckily he was not involved too much. The ending happened to fast with hardly any finishers.  Angle becomes the new WWE Champion.  Big Show brings this down to a ****9/10
I give this PPV *****, but the dvd ****1/2
i saw this ppv on t.v. and i loved it, but when i bought it, i realized there were no extras!  This ppv was amazing but the dvd was a little dissapointing.  I was expecting there to be United States Tournament matches. No extras was indeed a setback, but the matches make up for it. This PPV might have been better than Wrestlemania XIX!  Despite the lack of extras, this is still a must own for the dedicated WWE FAn.  No Matches slowed this PPV down, it was all fast paced action wrestling.

-Vengeance Intro
-Eddie Guerrero v. Chris Benoit (US Title Tourney Final) I loved this match but the ending kind of blew it.
-Jamie Noble v. Billy gunn w/ Torrie Wilson: quite entertaining but really short.
-APA Barroom Brawl : if you just like scientific technical wrestling you will probably hate this but most people love entertaining segments.
-WWE Tag Title Match : good match , execellent Smackdown! quality
-Steph v. Sable : at first I thought this would be so bad but it was above expectations
-Zach Gowen v. Vinnie Mac: wow bloody , very inspirational
-Taker v. Cena : ok match I guess, still pretty good

2. Jamie Noble vs Billy Gunn - Good match. Torrie looked HOT! Jamie winning the match w/ the briefcase was cool. The skit w/ Jamie ""sleeping"" with Torrie on SmackDown! that week was hilarious! **
3. APA Bar Room Brawl - Great brawl! Seeing Doink the Clown was great! I haven't seen him since WM X-SEVEN. Bradshaw winning the brawl kinda sucked. **

Billy Gunn vs. Jamie Noble - Indecent Proposal Match (***)
A short match but very entertaining always loved billy gunn in the mr. ass kinda thing and I like Noble's wrestling to. Great match could have been longer though.

The third best match on the card after Angle vs Big Show vs Lesnar and Eddie vs Benoit. Much of the Mysterio thing and great match with many near falls that you thought it would be over.
Entertaining and hard-fought match - respect to the 4 guys.
APA Barroom Brawl Invitatational (***)
Very entertaining and it was good to see some mid-carders on a ppv again. Like O'Haire and stuff. Nice spots in the match like the really career threatning Shannon Moore stage dive summersault to the concrete (very nice spot).
Sable Vs. Stephanie McMahon - Catfight (***)
Nice to see both in the ring altough it could have been better. But we shouldn't forget that Steph isn't into really wrestling anymore and Sable is in WWE for man entertainment not for wrestling either. So that's why I give it 3 stars , for a good match from both women.
Undertaker vs. John Cena (****)
Very good match Taker is finally ''back'' after some injuries.
Good ending because of the rise of Taker ones again. 4 stars for these match because it should have last a little longer.

Finals of the U.S. Championship Tournament - Eddie Guerrero vs. Chris Benoit.  This match was awesome, better than their match at Armageddon 02.  These guys put on a hell of an opener, and really showed in this match that the title they were fighting for meant something.  **** out of 5 stars(it gets 4 only cause Benoit didn't win)
Indecent Proposal Match - Billy Gunn vs. Jamie Noble.  This match only lasted about 4 minutes, but still a good match by both men.  Both men haven't been on a ppv for a while, but they put on an ok match.  **1/2
The APA Invitational.  This wasn't a match, it was a brawl, and not only that, it was a barroom brawl.  This was basically made for all the SD wrestlers who didn't have a match for the ppv, and this match had some pretty funny stuff in it.  ***
SD Tag Titles - World's Greatest Tag Team vs. Kidman and Mysterio.  This match was a great match, all four men pulled off some amazing stuff in this match, and the crowd was really into it.  The crowd really thought Kidman and Rey would win, but in the end, they came up a little too short.  But still an amazing match.  *****
Stephanie vs. Sable.  I'm not rating this match, because I didn't watch it, and quite frankly, I may never watch it.
The Undertaker vs. John Cena.  Great match by both men.  I don't really take Cena too serious as a competitor, but if your the same way, this match will change your mind on that, because Cena put up a great fight in this match and Taker did the same.  Both men put up a great match and it was better than I thought it would be.  ***1/2
Zac Gowen vs. Mr. McMahon.  What a match!  I'm sure you wouldn't expect a real good match from a 50 something year old man and a one legged wrestler, but these guys did great.  McMahon showed his ruthlessness in this match, trying to injure Zac's only leg, and Zac kept coming back and showed us his never give up attitude and pulled off some impressive moves.  Zac Gowen deserves a push for his great abilities in the ring.  ****
No DQ WWE Championship Match - Brock Lesner vs. Big Show vs. Kurt Angle.  Well it became no DQ later on in the ppv, so you know this was going to be a great match.  I expected this match to be real good, esepcially since it had no DQ, and boy was it ever.  They did some amazing stuff in that match, like an Angle Slam on big show thru the announce table, a double chokeslam by Brock and Kurt on Big Show, etc.  I really didn't expect Kurt to win, but when he did, I wasn't complaining, cause Kurt is a great wrestler, probably the best, and he deserves to hold that title. *****
There are no extras on this DVD.  I have heard some ppl say that this DVD sucks mainly because it has no extras, don't listen to them.  Sure this dvd had no extras, but the ppv itself made up for it completely, because it's the greatest ppv I've seen this year, and it probably will be the greatest when this year ends.

There are ZERO extras, which is weird because if you think about it, they had two months worth of build-up before this event. If you remember, Smackdown! didn't have a PPV after Judgement Day. So one would think some extras would have the U.S. Title Tournament highlights and the Confidential story on Zack Gowen. But nope. None. Zero. Nothing.
And for some reason, the UPC code isn't anywhere to be found. So if you were collecting all of the PPV DVD's of this year trying to get that box-set cover...guess what? You won't be able to get it without the UPC.

Eddie Guerrero vs. Chris Benoit

-Awesome match, match of the year in my opinion. Outdid their Armageddon match big time.
2. WWE Tag Team Championship:
World's Great Tag Team[c] vs. Billy Kidman & Rey Mysterio
*****
-Another awesome match, this might be the greatest tag-team match......ever! Big ups to both teams for a sweet match.
3. No Disqualification Match for the WWE Championship:
Brock Lesnar[c] vs. Kurt Angle vs. Big Show
*****
-Yet another great match (there are a lot of these). It was No Diqualification too, meaning trash can lids, chairs,  everything you can imagine used in this match. Plus, a new WWE Champion is crowned!
4. Undertaker vs. John Cena
****1/2
-Brutal match. Blood was spilled and 'Taker was nearly beat to a bloody pulp. I loved every second of this match. Just goes to show, Undertaker's in better shape than he's ever been in.
5. Zach Gowen vs. Vince McMahon
****
-Good way to push Zach, right Vince? No, despite Zach's first loss---to Vince of all people, both still delivered a solid contest. Zach did asai moonsaults and risked life and limb to deliver a top-quality performance at Vengeance. Unfortunately, Vince didn't follow suit and Zach had to carry him almost the entire match.
6. APA Invitational Brawl
***1/2
-A stupid concept, but this match wasn't too bad. Bradshaw, Faarooq, Sean O' Haire, Matt Hardy, Spanky, and the Easter Bunny (yes, the Easter Bunny) were all involved. Plus, many others. It was basically just a match with people hitting eachother over the head with whatever they could find. Not a bad match though.
7. Indecent Proposal:
Billy Gunn w/ Torrie vs. Jamie Knoble w/ Nidia
***1/2
-Not too bad of a match. Gunn gave forth a solid performance. Knoble did the same. Nothing special here. Very predictable ending.
8. Catfight:
Stephanie McMahon vs. Sable
***1/2
-Great hype, okay match. As far as catfights go, this one wasn't bad. But defenitley didn't come close to the hype.

Chris Benoit vs. Eddie Guerrero (U.S. Title) - Great Match, but what else would you expect from these two? The Finish is a little silly though.
Jamie Noble vs. Billy Gunn - Not good but not bad. Billy Gunn let's all face it, is not that good. But he did alright here, considering that it wasn't a long match.
APA Invitational - I was expecting guys randomly walking around punching each other and that's just what I got. But it was kind of funny.
The World's Greatest Tag Team (Benjamin & Haas) vs. Rey Mysterio & Billy Kidman (Tag Team Titles) - Awesome Match. High Flying action and technical wrestling, what more could you ask for? Match was Awsome. -
Stephanie vs. Sable - The only downside of the show. Terrible. Just Terrible. Not even a bit decent. At least Stephanie vs. Trish from 2001 had some energy. - DUD
John Cena vs. Undertaker - Nothing bad to say, other than Cena should have gone over as the winner. Great match for Undertaker
Zack Gowan vs. Vince McMahon - Just as good as an Old Guy vs. a Cripple was going to be. Zack Gowan is going to fade away fast though so this match doesn't really matter anyway.
Brock Lesnar vs. Big Show vs. Kurt Angle (WWE Title) - Great Match. Angle and Lesnar have the best matches together. Big Show wasn't in it enough to bug me.

7996903,4,B0000AGQ2H,"When looking back at the brand extension experiment by the WWE, it's difficult to say whether it was a success of not. I guess it would have to be considered a failure since it is no longer in use, and it never seemed to create the internal competition the WWE hoped for. Nevertheless, the brand extension allowed certain stars to shine, and, on occasion, events like Vengeance 2003 would be produced that blew most of the Big Four events out of the water.

Like most shows, there are a few featured matches that make or break the event. In this case, the four matches this show hangs it's hat on all deliver; Eddie Guerrero/Chris Benoit was an excellent opener, The Undertaker and John Cena had a strong brawling match, and the main event triple threat ranks right up there with the best three man matches in WWE history.

Rey Mysterio, Billy Kidman and the World's Greatest Tag Team put on the match of the night and, possibly, the match of the year with their explosion of innovative offensive and seemless, break-neck pacing.

The rest of the card was filled with short, mostly inoffensive matches. The one match that brings down the event is an ego-trip by Vince McMahon as he goes against one-legged Zack Gowen that falls flat; it's devoid of the drama and tension McMahon created with his matches against Steve Austin, Hogan and his son, Shane McMahon. Even with this hiccup, this remains a runner-up for event of the year behind WrestleMania. Recommended.",1410220800,,1463,4.729411764705882

You should probably fix that guys, or a lot of newer fans are going to be confused about which DVD they're buying.))

**THE STORY**
Anyway, down to business! This was the first Smackdown exclusive pay-per-view since the brand split in spring 2002, and boy did it ever blow RAW's Bad Blood out of the water and use it for skeet shooting. Just when WWE had totally failed to give me a satisfying show since Mania XIX and I was having doubts, Smackdown came to the rescue. All the ingredients were there: a hot crowd, a great card, and wrestlers working their asses off to make this thing memorable. Did they succeed? As Stone Cold would say, ""hell yeah!""

**THE SHOW**
Chris Benoit vs. Eddie Guerrero for the U.S. Title: awesome opener. These guys had a special chemistry in the ring no matter what promotion they were in, and it shows here. In one of their best matches together in WWE, Benoit is determined to win the tournament for the title (resurrected from WCW), but don't forget Latino Heat's motto: lie, cheat, and steal. Jamie Noble/Billy Gunn, the First (and only) APA Barroom Brawl Invitational, and Stephanie vs. Sable were gimmicky matches that served their purpose but were kept mercifully short. Mysterio and Kidman tore the house down with The World's Greatest Tag Team, and the next match gave up-and-comer John Cena a great chance to shine against Undertaker.

The only match that hurt the show even a little bit, both because of the guys in there and how long it lasted, was Zach Gowen vs. Vince McMahon. For some reason Vince thought people would pay to see a blown-up non-wrestler CEO against a one-legged kid in an ass kicking contest. But as always, Vince is willing to suffer for the spotlight--he sells Gowen's limited offense like crazy and bleeds like a stuck pig.

Vengeance follows that up with the main event of Big Show vs. Kurt Angle vs. Brock Lesnar, no DQ for the WWE Championship, in one of the greatest triple threat matches in WWE history. It was creatively booked, all three guys looked amazing, and for once I really had no idea who was going to win. Neither did the crowd, as they were pretty stunned (in a good way) at who eventually came out on top.

**THE VERDICT**
WWE's ""post-Attitude Era"" (2003-2007) was a mixed bag with a lot of great shows and a lot of mediocre ones. This PPV was one of the best of that time. Longtime fans probably already own this DVD because they know how great the show was, and new fans should check it out to see a young John Cena, Brock Lesnar, and Rey Mysterio in action--and to see that Guerrero, Benoit, and Angle really were as good as they're cracked up to be.",1397520000,2,2800,4.580838323353293
7996905,5,B0000AGQ2H,"This event could possibly be the best single brand pay-per-view, ever. You had a World Heavyweight and WWE Championship match. A WrestleMania 21 re-match and several other match ups.

HELL IN A CELL MATCH for the World Heavyweight Championship: Batista(c) vs. Triple H  -4.5/5 stars.
In what was one of the best matches of 2005 and of both men's careers, Batista defeated Triple H for the third sttaight time in a championship match. Which is an accomplishment in of its self. Who else has done that? Anyways, this match was brutal and bloody. Great Hell in a Cell match here.

TRIPLE THREAT MACTH for the WWE Championship: John Cena(c) vs. Christian vs. Chris Jericho  -3.5/5 stars.
Cena was just drafted to RAW and he was the WWE Champion, which is what makes the PPV so unique. It had both major titles. But, this match was entertaining. You had a rising star in Cena, a former world champion in Jericho, and a hell of a competitor in Christian. Lots of cool moves in this one. Cena pins Christian after a FU. Still WWE Champion.

WRESTLEMANIA RE-MATCH: Shawn Michaels vs. Kurt Angle  -4.4/5 stars
In what was a great match here, HBK evened the score 1 to 1 with a victory over Kurt. Maybe not as good as the first one, but these two had a series of fantastic matches in 2005. And this one did not disapoint. How could they? Two of the best ever. HBK wins after an absolute awesome Superkick to Angle.

INTERCONTIENTAL TITLE MATCH: Carlito(c) vs. Shelton Benjamin  -3.3/5 stars.
Fun opener here. Two young guys at the time and great matches, could of been better. But it was still passable. Carlito retains the Intercontiental championship.

Edge vs. Kane  -3/5 stars.
A decent match here in what was an alright storyline. Not even interference from Snitsky would stop Kane, as he went one to win.

Victoria vs. Christy Hemme  -2/5.

The worst matches were the VKM-Zack Gowen bout which was slow,pointless and a lame way to get the media's attention & the APA Invitational Bar Room Brawl which was as the Nostalgia Critic would call it a ""Big-Lipped Alligator Moment"" The rest were ok.

Chris Benoit vs. Eddie Guerrero

This was the final of the US Championship tournament to reinstate the US title on SmackDown. In my eyes, this match stole the show. At first, it might be difficult to watch these days after the untimely death of Eddie Guerrero and the horrible fiasco surrounding Benoit's death. So some people, especially passioniate Eddie Guerrero and Chris Benoit fans (which makes up a lot of wrestling fans) may find it difficult to swallow at first. But if you can get your head around that, then you will thoroughly enjoy the show that these two put on.
What more is there to say really? They're two hard working, experienced, dedicated guys going at it. They're given a decent time limit so it's not rushed, and really, this match could have gone either way, and I don't think the fans really cared who walked away with the title as both were very deserving.
After some good acting by Eddie towards the end, and the referee taking an inadvertent beating (at one point Tazz remarks: ""Mike Chioda is getting his ass kicked in there!""), Rhyno interferes, seemingly to help his friend Benoit, but ends up taking out Chris Benoit with a Gore instead. This allowed Eddie to capitalize and land a frog splash to retain the title.
Excellent match, and possibly stole the show. The only problem at this point is would the rest of the SmackDown roster be able to deliver to the standard that Eddie and Benoit already set?

5/5 (Quite possiby the match of the night)

{Indecent Proposal Match}
Billy Gunn w/ Torrie Wilson vs. Jamie Noble

The background behind this match was pretty amusing. Torrie Wilson had just modeled for the cover of Playboy, gaining the unwanted attention of Jamie Noble. A match was then made where if Jamie Noble was able to defeat Billy Gunn, then he'd get to have Torrie to himself for a full night.
The match was short and sweet, which is good as a match like this probably wouldn't have been great if it dragged on longer than a few minutes.
Billy Gunn had the upperhand for most of the match using a lot of major power moves, but then Noble hit with a top rope DDT. Nidia then added to the mix by coming out to ringside and putting Billy Gunn's foot on the rope, not wanting Jamie to win.
Finally, after a few more back and forths, Jamie scored a roll up for the quick victory. The expression on Torrie's face was priceless.

3/5 (Not amazing but not bad either. Short and sweet.)

{APA Bar Room Brawl Invitational}

I wouldn't really count this as a match, it was basically just a massive brawl with a load of obscure gimmick wrestlers, but it was a fun way to get most of the SmackDown roster that wasn't already booked on the card onto the PPV.
It was held in an old style saloon type setting next to the stage and had a lot of the SmackDown roster including The APA, Matt Hardy, Shannon Moore, Sean O'Haire, Spanky, The Basham Brothers among others. It also had a lot of obscure characters like Brother Love, Doink the Clown, The Brooklyn Brawler and the Easter Bunny.
Some highlights were Sean O'Haire cracking pool cues over people, Funaki drinking himself unconscious, the Easter Bunny getting thrown head first through a window and Matt Hardy leg dropping two opponents on a table.
Bradshaw ended up getting the win.

2.5/5 (It was pretty jumbled and confusing, but entertaining nonetheless.)

{WWE Tag Team Championship}
The World's Greatest Tag Team (c) vs. Rey Mysterio & Billy Kidman

Out of all the wasted potential and over looked talent that the WWE has underused and ignored over the years, I have to say that Billy Kidman is the most upsetting. While he may not have had the best mic skills or heaps of charisma, he was amazing in the ring and could put on a hell of a match with any opponent.
Both teams brough their A game to this, and the crowd could not have been any more into it. It was a fantastic match and followed the standard that Eddie and Benoit had set at the start of the night.
There were a lot of amazing highflying moves including a shooting star press from the top rope to the outside of the ring by Billy Kidman, and Rey Mysterio was his usual exhausting highflying self.
Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin managed to get the win after a doomsday device kind of move on Rey Mysterio, much to the fans disappointment.

4.5/5 (amazing match.)

Stephanie McMahon vs. Sable

This match kind of slowed down the event a fair bit. The crowd were into it, and it was cool seeing Stephanie get fired up as much as she did against Sable. The match had no count outs and had a lot of ringside brawling, which was mostly one sided with Stephanie getting most of the advantage. It looked as though she was about to get the win, but then A-Train interfered and tackled Stephanie, then left the ring while Sable had the referee distracted. Sable then got the pinfall.
I've seen worse diva matches, but this was still the weakest match of the night. While it is interesting to see someone like Stephanie, who is generally a non-wrestling character, get into the ring, it gets boring quickly, so the match should've gone faster.

2/5 (here's the weak link of the PPV)

Undertaker vs. John Cena

This was a great match that picked up after Stephanie and Sable's catfight. This was back when Cena was a heel and only just starting to get a push towards being an upper card/ main event type wrestler.
The Undertaker came out and pretty much destroyed Cena in the first few minutes of the match, hitting all his big moves, including a chokeslam, but then instead of pinning Cena, went for a Last Ride, which was countered.
This was an interesting flowing match, once Cena gained control, he maintained it, and Taker actually made Cena look very strong and like a very real competitor who could defeat the Undertaker.
He worked on Undertaker's ribs and midsection for the whole match, causing him to bleed from the mouth. But Cena got cocky and finally ended up taking a Last Ride resulting the Undertaker winning.

4/5 (excellent match, it made Cena look like an excellent and stronger heel but still made Taker look strong.)

Vince McMahon vs. Zach Gowen

Hmm... I'm very heads or tails about this match. There is entertainment to be found here, and you will most likely find yourself rooting heavily for Zach who could not be any more of an underdog, to come back and beat Vince McMahon. Zach Gowen is a one-legged wrestler who you just have to get behind, but I do feel bad for him, the WWE pretty much used him up as a new gimmick, then spat him back out after they ran out of storylines to put him in.
This match was relatively slow, and most of it was just Vince McMahon beating down a one-legged kid which almost starts to border on becoming painful to watch, but Zach gets some momentum going with some bigger moves like an asai moonsault and a dropkick. Vince even brings a chair into the match but ends up having it kicked into his face busting him open. Eventually Zach goes for a moonsault, but misses, costing him the match.

2.5/5 (it dragged on a little too much, and felt too gimicky)

{WWE Championship}
{No DQ Triple Threat}
Brock Lesnar (c) vs. Kurt Angle vs. Big Show

Triple threats are usually pretty hit or miss, sometimes they're great, but quite often they're bad and repetetive. But this was a pleasantly surprising exception.
I thought that Big Show might be the weak link in this match, but he was actually very spot on and brought a lot to the table making it a very interesting and entertaining triple threat. The no disqualification stipulation played a big part with trash can lids and steel chairs entering the match, and Big Show being Angle Slammed through an announce table.
The match really could have gone anyway, but finally Angle took home the win pinning Lesnar after an Angle Slam.

4.5/5 (Great main event to a great pay-per-view.)

---

Highlights:

* Chris Benoit vs. Eddie Guerrero - amazing opening match
* Billy Kidman and Rey Mysterio's performance
* The main event

Criticisms:

* Both of the McMahon's matches could have been a bit shorter, or not have happened at all.
* Some might find that Vince's match against Zach was tasteless

Overall, Vengeance is an excellent wrestling DVD. The three championship matches are amazing with outstanding performances by everyone involved. Although Stephanie vs. Sable and Vince vs. Zach aren't great, they're still entertaining in their own right.
For SmackDown's first ever PPV, this is excellent, and better than Raw's first PPV. If you can find then I strongly recommend getting it.",1272585600,,8569,4.619078947368421
