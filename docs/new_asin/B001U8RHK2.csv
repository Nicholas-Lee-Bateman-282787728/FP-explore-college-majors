8343144,5,B001U8RHK2,"This film is also known as  Teacher and Three Children or ""ishiuchi jinjo koto shogakko: hana wa chiredomo"". It is an excellent drama about the caring between a sixth-grade school teacher and his students in a small Japanese village. Writer and director Kaneto Shindo made this film in 2008 at the age of 96. The film takes place between 1923 and about 1960. In Japan at that time, public-school teachers were valued and respected. I found the film touching and thought-provoking. I recommend it. At the time of this writing, the film can also be found on YouTube.",1427155200,,564,4.755102040816326
