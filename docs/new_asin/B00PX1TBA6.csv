6824855,4,B00PX1TBA6,"An intriguing, surprising horror-drama which shows both sides of witchcraft - the light and dark. Really well made considering the low budget and as mentioned in other reviews, full of great locations and moody cinematography. The engrossing story is worth the time and effort.",1419120000,,277,5.318181818181818
6824856,5,B00PX1TBA6,A great independent movie in the genre of fictional horror with a totally unexpected ending. A must see.,1419120000,,104,4.833333333333333
6824857,5,B00PX1TBA6,"I really enjoyed this film. Ok, it isn't not have the highest production values but for a independent film I thought it was great and it is well worth watching.",1419033600,2,160,4.366666666666666
6824858,5,B00PX1TBA6,"What a fantastic film, filmed in some lovely places. It gave, spice, mystery and shock value to few hours of brilliant entertainment.",1419033600,2,133,5.090909090909091

6824860,1,B00PX1TBA6,"Yet another media mess up with inaccurate material. Did they even consulate a Pagan before writting this movie? In movies where a Christian or a Jew are portrayed they at least get movie parts concerning instilling deep values in our children, strengthening community, facing death with dignity. These same Christian or Jewish roles surround morality and ethics with modern day problems of abortion, gay marriage, and the environment. And what do Pagans get as roles? Weird and unusual rites that most often include killing a child or animal or sacrificing another human.",1416960000,5,571,5.217391304347826

8689604,5,B00PX1TBA6,"Great movie - disturbing in places, thought provoking in others. Some of the cinematography (eg shots of Crosby beach) are stunning. Jacqueline who wrote, filmed, directed and starred in the movie is obviously very talented. If you enjoy movies about witchcraft (similar to the 'wicker man') or like movies that make you feel a bit 'uneasy' like 'Rosemary's baby' you will enjoy this movie. As I live in Liverpool I also enjoyed seeing that it was filmed in locations around Crosby etc",1470009600,,485,4.926829268292683

8689606,1,B00PX1TBA6,"Again, paganism/wicca is mixed up with Satanism. Satanism worships the Christian Fallen Angel, and has zip to do with Paganism or Wicca,  both are earth based faiths. Ancient Goddesses and Gods were demonized or demoted by the Church. It is not to say that there are not variants that have a darker, not evil, aspects of these scientists. Again, Pagans and such faiths are misrepresented because either the writers did bad research or they deliberately did it. If a priest inquired about my faith, and kept pressing I would have shown him the door.",1441756800,7,548,4.829787234042553
8689607,1,B00PX1TBA6,"Wasted my time watching this. No research, bad acting. I watched the entire thing hoping it would get better. Don't waste one minute",1439769600,,132,4.782608695652174
8689608,2,B00PX1TBA6,"I thought it gave a very poor portrayal of wicca, witchcraft, paganism and the occult in general.",1437436800,3,97,4.764705882352941
8689609,3,B00PX1TBA6,for an INDIE film with not much of a budget it was quite good. The plot was very good and the actors were not the best. If this film had a bigger budget I'm sure this would be a big hit in the USA.,1433808000,,197,3.5

8689611,5,B00PX1TBA6,"Had this film sent over from the UK to Australia. We were all looking forward to seeing Ms Kirkhams talents come alive on the screen and we were not disappointed. I thought it was engaging, well shot, imaginative, spooky and above all worth the wait. Well done to Ms Kirkham and all her team.

8689612,5,B00PX1TBA6,"Blimey - this was a surprise movie. The niceness of the main characters and pleasantness of the sleepy setting means that when the twists come, they are very unsettling. It has a reality to it that means the scenes in the woods are giving me flashbacks a day after watching it . Beautifully shot too on a low budget - great watch",1423612800,,329,4.32258064516129
