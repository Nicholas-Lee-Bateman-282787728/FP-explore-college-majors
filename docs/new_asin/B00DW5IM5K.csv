5860117,1,B00DW5IM5K,This is the most pathetic movie I have seen in years. All that is missing is Barney Fife! Lousey acting...just stupid. If I could I'd return it.,1384905600,6,144,4.37037037037037
5860118,1,B00DW5IM5K,"This isn't a movie, it's a way to steal your money. They should be ashamed to sell something like this. Doesn't deserve a star.",1384646400,4,127,4.333333333333333
5860119,1,B00DW5IM5K,I think it was filmed on a 100 dollor budget/ sorry to say the horses did a better job acting/ don't watch if you like watching good movies or watch if you enjoy bad movies,1384646400,4,172,3.942857142857143
5860120,1,B00DW5IM5K,"Story sounded great, but the acting is so horrible it makes a Lifetime movie look like an Academy Award winner.  The people didn't even know their lines at times.  Not even exaggerating. I've seen better acting in middle school plays.  If you want to turn it on a leave it with your kids to watch, I'm sure it's a sweet story (although it may bore them to death too). We gave up and quit watching.",1383955200,,397,4.266666666666667
5860121,2,B00DW5IM5K,"I have no issue with the predictability of the plot. The countryside is beautiful, If it only had some folks who could act.",1383955200,5,123,4.391304347826087
5860122,1,B00DW5IM5K,"I was looking forward to a new Christmas movie.  What a disappointment!  Acting was bad, script was ridiculous, no point to the story.  I viewed it once [barely] and gave it the nearest Rescue Mission.  I have never reviewed an item and been so disappointed with the product.",1383782400,6,275,4.666666666666667
5860171,5,B00DW5IM5K,Movie for the whole family!!!,1420675200,,29,5.0
5860172,1,B00DW5IM5K,Absolute trash. Poorest acting ever. Should be paid to watch that crap.,1419465600,,71,5.0
5860173,5,B00DW5IM5K,"Arrived without any damages and packed well.  A cute story and
my grandson enjoyed it. Great gift for him.",1416700800,,106,4.578947368421052
5860174,3,B00DW5IM5K,"I didn't watch it, but my 7 year old who loves and will watch every horse movie possible, wasn't very impressed.",1411516800,,112,4.380952380952381
5860175,1,B00DW5IM5K,"Poor plot, amateur acting - just plain bad.........forced plot. The only good
thing  about it was the little girl - she showed potential.",1395273600,,137,4.956521739130435
5860176,2,B00DW5IM5K,Very disappointing The acting was terrible. The. two bumbling horse thieves were weird. There was no Christmas to this movie,1394236800,,124,5.25
5860177,5,B00DW5IM5K,Its so adorable. Me and my children love this movie. Best movie to sit and relax and enjoy. Humor is added. Perfect for little kids.,1389225600,,132,4.32
5860178,3,B00DW5IM5K,"Was a little slow in starting a low end movie...have seen better, would of liked more of a story, but liked the ending the best!!",1389052800,4,129,4.2
5860179,5,B00DW5IM5K,"The DVD arrived on time and in excellent condition
  I liked the movie.  Initially, I wasn't sure I would, but I'm glad I hung in there and watchedit through.  It is a good family story, and I may pass it on to family members with children.",1388620800,,240,4.1521739130434785
5860180,5,B00DW5IM5K,The main character can only be described as if Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt had a baby. Stupendous. I was never so worried about crying in front my wife and kids more after some of the horse was stolen. The emotional attachment you have to the horse is unreal. Miraculous. If there was a reason to me to own multiple copies of this movie I would. 100/100,1387843200,,357,4.343283582089552
5860211,4,B00DW5IM5K,"Very sweet film. Beautifully photographed. Great for the family to watch together! Kids in it are great, loved the 'trick' horse.",1387670400,,129,5.190476190476191
5860212,1,B00DW5IM5K,"It was very poorly done, and a waste of money. I feel mislead, because it surely was not a good movie like you said.",1387152000,2,116,3.875
5860213,1,B00DW5IM5K,"This is one of the worst movies i have ever seen.  The story line, the acting, the characters everything is awful about it.
Absolutely NOT worth the money or time.  Sad i bought it for my grandchildren and could not stand to watch it.  Could not wait till it was over!",1387152000,3,268,4.215686274509804
5860214,2,B00DW5IM5K,"Ok, horses, a colt born on Christmas, spoiled kids this movie had it all and I really wanted to like it. Not enough horses (the best is the gal with the trick horse), some comedy, the colt doesn't show up until the last 10 minutes of the movie for all of 2 minutes and the acting was really bad. Didn't keep kids or adults entertained.",1386979200,,335,4.1692307692307695
5860215,1,B00DW5IM5K,WAY boring !!  Super slow and not at all what I thought it would be.  All the time thinking this was going to be real heart warming but really for children..,1386892800,2,157,4.032258064516129
5860216,1,B00DW5IM5K,"I was so excited for this movie, Christmas and horses what could be a better combo.  Wrong.  It barely held the interest of my children.  My 13 year old looked at me and said, ""Am I being punked?, I can act better than this"".  The characters Bones and Tank did the best acting by far just because their characters were just utterly ridiculous and unrealistic...they gave at least a little bit of humor to the movie.  I am not one to just be negative, or bash things, just because, in fact I would love to support a small production company.  I think with some nice equipment, I could have made this movie with no experience.  This really is a very boring, slow movie with very stale acting that almost seems so super forced that it is painful..not only for the actors but for the audience as well.  I actually bought mine at Sam's Club for $10.98.  Too bad I can't return a movie after it is opened...",1386806400,2,901,4.347305389221557
5860217,5,B00DW5IM5K,I haven't watch the movie since purchasing it but I'm absolutely positive for someone who loves Christmas and horses that this will be a great movie.,1386115200,,149,4.769230769230769
5860218,4,B00DW5IM5K,I bought this movie for my kids and we enjoyed it.  It was a nice family story with some talented up and coming actors.,1385856000,,119,3.9583333333333335
5860219,1,B00DW5IM5K,Acting was poor and the story line not very interesting.  Maybe someone else might enjoy this cd--just not for me.,1385856000,6,114,4.7
5860220,1,B00DW5IM5K,"Don't waste your time or money.  The so called acting was the worst I have ever seen.  They weren't actors.  They must have read the script from a distance as there was no feeling in the words.  Just blah blah blah.  Very disappointed.  These ""actors"" should not have been paid.  No one could act.  They should get another job and move away from Hollywood.  This could have been a cute movie with the right actors.  These were not the right ""actors"".  They couldn't even read the script well.  Blah, Blah, Blah, VERY BAD ACTING.",1385596800,10,528,4.5
8598519,1,B00DW5IM5K,"I am a horse lover so I usually love corny horse love movies. This one was the teath grindingly awful. The editing was probably the worst part. Long awkward pauses between scenes.
The best part ...maybe their is one but I had to change it.",1513555200,,239,4.333333333333333
8598520,5,B00DW5IM5K,Love this,1476662400,,9,4.0
8598521,5,B00DW5IM5K,Very satisfied,1458864000,,14,6.5
8598522,1,B00DW5IM5K,Awful movie - hope it would be a good movie for all but left much to be desired. Only giving one star as you can't give none.,1454544000,,125,3.6666666666666665
8598523,1,B00DW5IM5K,"Wow, this movie would have to try to be any worse than it is!  An American dad and his two brats are driving through northern California on the way to Grandma's house.  Inexplicably, only the son has an Australian accent, why is that?  Dad decides to pull over for a break and turns right into someone's driveway and all the way up to their barn.  Why would he do this?  The kids/brats then meander into the barn and are greated by the owner who then gives them a Coke from a loaded cooler that just happened to be sitting there full of Cokes and ice - riiiight!  The brats are unappreciative and unable to open a bottle with a metal bottle cap because they're from the civilized world and have never seen a bottle opener.  What crap.  They then continue on and suddenly dad's brand new BMW SUV just stops for no reason in the middle of the road.  Dad does nothing, says nothing other then ""that's odd"" and then they decide to just sleep there.  This utter waste of time descends from here and has the look and feel of a (bad) high school video project.  My advice?  Go clean the bathroom, you'll have more fun.",1449792000,,1111,4.314009661835748

8598525,4,B00DW5IM5K,"Loved the premise of the movie, but the acting left much to be desired.",1441238400,,71,4.142857142857143
8598526,1,B00DW5IM5K,"Not an adult viewing movie.  Horrible acting, bad story lines, son should be put in his place, dad is a pushover and has no authority over his own kids.  Awful.  Don't waste your money like I did.",1437868800,,196,4.243243243243243
8598527,5,B00DW5IM5K,great,1432944000,,5,5.0
8598528,1,B00DW5IM5K,Insanely awful movie. Only saving grace of this was the colt.,1423008000,,61,4.636363636363637
