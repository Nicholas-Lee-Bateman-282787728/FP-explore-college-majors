I actually learned some things that helped me ""brush up"" on my firefighting skills, etc.  It's a great video and if you like action packed DVD's, or your a firefighter, or even want to be a firefighter,  you want this DVD!",1050969600,4,364,4.013888888888889
8110437,1,B00006409F,The amazon page say 8 hours only 88 minutes of content misrepresented the content that is on the dvd is a great watch but its not what is advertised.,1520812800,,149,4.172413793103448
8110438,3,B00006409F,By today's standards this show was alright but far from great. Back when it came originally aired it was awesome. The DVD lacks a lot of the content that was seen on TV. Makes you wonder where the rest of the content and footage went.,1496620800,,234,4.222222222222222

8110440,4,B00006409F,"This is one of the most amazing reality shows i have ever seen, its gets right to the heart of life, if you never had respect for firefighters,watch this ,it will change your mind (these guys are closer than most families will ever be)its a pity there is only one DVD released, i, as would many other people, would like to see more of the real life elements of this show, so producers if you`re reading this, get the finger out and release some more... well worth having in your DVD collection.....Chris Shelley..Dublin..Ireland.",1168473600,,529,4.698924731182796
8110441,5,B00006409F,"It was the most real,life like vidoe I have seen. I think everyone outside of the fire service should see it.",1142380800,2,109,4.238095238095238
8110442,5,B00006409F,"Only a few episodes on this DVD, but that is the ONLY thing I can say badly about it. It brings you right onto the scene with everything from fires to rescuing a 600 pound man and a guy that was hit by a train. And as an added bonus, if you have read ""The Last Men Out"" but Tom Downey, you will see man of the names and people and stories in this DVD from Rescue 2 in Brooklyn. I think that was the best part of it. Almost getting to know the men for Rescue 2, and then actually seeing them in action in several of the scenes in this DVD. I would HIGHLY recommend the book to anyone interested. Its pretty neat to see how firefighters like Bob Galione, who found a cargo net and kept in on the Rescue truck just incase, uses it in the recuse of the obese man.

Overall, great DVD for the money, Highly recommended!",1120953600,4,814,3.9938650306748467
8110443,5,B00006409F,"Wonderful, but too short. If the tv show went on for years, I should like to see other episodes and dvd. I love to watch real fire action, and I don't care if it is not spectacular as a commercial movie.",1096416000,3,203,3.975609756097561
8110444,3,B00006409F,"I watched the show religiously each night it was on.  Here in Seattle that was at 0000 on Saturday night/morning.  Unfortunately the show was short lived.  Which did make me wonder after buying the DVD...Where is the rest of the series????

Even the bonus features showed some runs with Jersey City Fire Department (FDJC) in the promo that didn't make it onto the final copy.  Along with countless other departments that didn't make it to the shelf (LA City, DC and more!)

Overall it was good, especially the memorial portion.  Whole thing left me wanting more though.....

maybe some additional volumes?",1091404800,7,605,4.920792079207921
8110445,3,B00006409F,"I bought The Bravest and watched it the other day and thought there was some sort of tehnical glitch when, after only the second segment, it was OVER!!  What footage they had was great, especially the FDNY Rescue footage.  The other segment shot while at San Fran was pretty boring and at times laughable.  I watched the episodes that aired during the original series and wondered after I watched the DVD - where are the other episodes?",1090195200,3,436,4.636363636363637
8110446,5,B00006409F,This is one of my favorite DVD's in my collection. I loved the show when it was on tv. It contains two episodes on it and is a nice tribute to those brothers lost on 9/11. Too bad they did not release the entire series on DVD. The title says it all...,1088208000,8,251,3.8461538461538463
