1861196,5,B00008SCHS,My 2 year old just loves this DVD.. She already knew how to count but hearing dora and boots count through their travels is reinforcing her skills. The songs and colors keep their attentions while the repetition helps them learn. All the episodes are cute and they teach the same concepts.,1066176000,,289,4.686274509803922
1861197,4,B00008SCHS,"Dora and her friend Boots are visiting the place where lost toys are gathered. It is not clear why those toys are there. The plot is a little vacuous as opposed to other Dora's episodes. In this episode, more and new characters are stuffed, maybe to cover also little boys. Anyway, the formula that shapes Dora's and friends' adventures is still a success for children, especially girls, between 2 and 4. However, with this episode I have the impression that whatever Dora's story is, my daughter is going to follow her with vivid interest anyway. Also the second episode in this VHS does not shine as those in other videos. I hope next Dora's episodes on VHS are going to lift the bar a little bit upper.
Her striking resemblance with the French heroine Madeline is impressing. However, Dora has something fresher and wilder that my daughter of 3 love unconditionally. Maybe because there is no Madame Clavel around?",1060300800,4,917,4.773584905660377
1861198,5,B00008SCHS,"For children 1 to 5 Dora the Explore has to be one of the best educational shows.  This DVD includes 4 episodes, so it is a very good deal.",1059696000,2,139,3.793103448275862
1861199,5,B00008SCHS,"I just bought this video for my almost 3 year old son.  We're big fans of Bear in the Big House, The Wiggles, Kipper, Clifford, Sesame Street, etc.  I had never seen Dora before and was not sure if he would like it.  This is a fantastic video!  It is very interactive.  Dora encourages children to get involved to look for stars, pop bubbles, jump up and down, etc.  There is some Spanish in the video, though not as much as I hoped.  Still, what little there is can be easily expanded upon (i.e. counting stars).  This is a great video for kids and their parents!  I will definitely buy more Dora videos!",1059264000,3,605,4.283185840707965
1861230,5,B00008SCHS,I purchased the City of Lost Toys DVD because my 3-year old daughter and I will soon be attending the City of Lost Toys Live Show.  My daughter has viewed this DVD many times and loves it.  She (and I) are huge Dora fans.,1247529600,,221,4.0
1861231,5,B00008SCHS,"This is a great video, my grandchildren really like it. It came in time for Christmas, so the service was great.",1231632000,,112,4.380952380952381
1861232,5,B00008SCHS,"I am so happy I bought this dvd for my 2 year old daughter. Not only does it teach you how to count, it also throws in some addition, and other math skills. It is wonderful! I have been looking for this dvd since I saw it on Nick Jr. Also, for the price you cannot beat it! Everywhere else wants $14.99+ for this dvd. I also read that people cannot find the bonus episodes, which I don't understand why, because in the main menu it gives you choices. Overall, I think it is the best dvd Dora has come out with. My daughter is not even a huge Dora fan, but still enjoys the dvd, and learns from it. I highly recommend this product!",1210377600,,630,4.048
1861233,5,B00008SCHS,"My 3 year old daughter loved this dvd, I was able to get a few things around the house well she watched dora.  Dora also helped her with her counting. Dora rocks:)",1179705600,,163,4.09375
1861234,5,B00008SCHS,My train-obsessed two year old loves this video with the trains & toys.  He enjoys counting along too.  This is his favorite of all the Dora videos we own.,1125360000,,155,4.310344827586207
1861235,5,B00008SCHS,"We bought this Dora DVD for our granddaughter,Kiersten. She loves ANYTHING that has to do with Dora. I(Grandma)babysits Kiersten three days a week and we seldom miss a Dora episode. Although we had seen all 4 episodes on this DVD on the Dora series they were not frequent ones. We have watched this DVD so many times already,but she never tires of it. Dora is not annoying to watch and does teach colors,numbers,shapes,etc. We just bought another Dora DVD today and I'm sure she'll love this one,too. We also plan to buy her several more for her second birthday in September.",1123200000,,575,4.702970297029703
1861236,5,B00008SCHS,"All four of these stories are very cute, especially the first one which teaches counting and addition in a fun, creative way. The music is quite impressive. My daughter loves the Dora videos and this one is my favorite.",1099612800,2,219,4.641025641025641
1861237,3,B00008SCHS,"We rented Dora the Expl on dvd at Hollywood Videos (thats the one my 2 & a half yr old picked out all by himself), well we were thrilled because we love dora (quite educational!).. the ease of playing that dvd was GRREAT! insert then play all.
we then went to barnes & nobles & bought this one Dora Lost City dvd- my husband thought it was more educational then the egg one~ well, this one is good but the function ""play all"" stinks!! very dissapointed in how ""play all"" means play the first 2 then you have to literally HUNT around for the other 2 bonus episodes.. at first we thought the dvd we purchased was defective because ""play all"" would only play 2 & it stated on the box there were 4 episodes total 90+ minutes but would cut off at 50 minutes after the second episode & closing. PLAY ALL should mean play all right?? well one would assume.
ive ordered Dora Map Adventures & Dora Rhymes And Riddles dvds so we'll see if the makers have figured it out, maybe it was just a mistake for this particular one *crossing my fingers*.. an irony that dora is educational yet the makers cant get the fundamental ""play all"" to work correctly on the menu.",1088553600,3,1152,4.313364055299539
1861238,5,B00008SCHS,"I have a 2 y/o and 4 y/o and they love this video!!!!  I would definetly recommend this to anyone with little ones.  It is not one of the shows they have played a million times on TV as well, which helps keep it special for them.  It is well worth the $, and I have had no problems with the picture quality at all.",1076198400,,314,3.8
1861239,5,B00008SCHS,"I think this is a great DVD for Dora fans because the episodes are very good, and they are ones that we have not seen on TV before.  The City of Lost Toys is beautiful, with really nice color and design.
My daughter would watch this DVD all day if we let her.",1069804800,3,259,3.8867924528301887

7986696,4,B00008SCHS,Dora gets on my nerves but I think this is really much better than the newer Dora The Explorer. Yep.,1391385600,,100,4.05
7986697,5,B00008SCHS,Dora and her pal boots get along together and they find all the toys and the grandkids enjoyed it so did I,1379462400,,106,3.8636363636363638
7986698,3,B00008SCHS,This DVD does not automatically go onto the next movie. I don't get it. Most parents only get these things to occupuy the lil ones while we are busy. But its only 23min and then I have to return to dvd player :(,1356048000,,211,3.9302325581395348
7986699,5,B00008SCHS,Dora the explorer is truly a show your grandchildren or children will love watching.  Its educational for learning Spanish and English.  I have purchased many dvds of Dora!,1354492800,,172,5.107142857142857
7986700,5,B00008SCHS,I ordered Dora The Explorer for my little girl & she loved it. Its way to expensive to buy brand new DVD's from the store when you can get slightly used DVD's from Amazon.com & in VERY GOOD CONDITION for a cheaper price. I will continue to buy products from Amazon.com,1334880000,2,268,4.2745098039215685
