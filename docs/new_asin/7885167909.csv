7900571,4,7885167909,My twins really love this dvd. I look all over but couldn't find them at the stores. When I found them here online I order it immediately and its was very good. The only thing is that you have to change the subtitle and  you have to figure it out because it all written in chinese.,1370390400,,281,4.017857142857143
7900572,5,7885167909,"My daughter loves Peppa Pig, but the merchandise is hard to find in the US. I am so glad we found these. While the case is totally in mandarin chinese the DVD's have an option for English. Now my daughter can watch the show she loves whever she wants. Well worth the price for us. Shipping was lightning fast too.",1342828800,,313,4.233333333333333
7900573,5,7885167909,"I highly recommend this product.  Yes it plays in United States.  I am not going to lie, it is sort of a pain to figure out how to get disks to play in English, but once you know where to press it is great.  Also you can turn off subtitles.  There is a review on where to press on Chinese disks, it took some figuring out but we are good to go!  I used express shipping, and it was here in 4 business days!",1337817600,,406,3.7857142857142856
7900574,5,7885167909,The video works in my car DVD system which is exactly what I wanted. The box is written entirely in Chinese so I was scared it wouldn't be in English or would be dubbed in chinese with English subtitles but it is in English with English subtitles. Very pleased with purchase--kids love it. Seller was nice and superfast!,1330905600,,320,4.5344827586206895
7900575,5,7885167909,"My order came within one week of ordering! Even though it is a Chinese import it plays in English on a USA format DVD. You just have to go into ""menu"" and select English. My 4 year old is so happy!",1329177600,2,197,3.8292682926829267
7900576,5,7885167909,"I received these DVDs within a week of ordering, and they work great! I looked online forever to find Peppa Pig DVDs that would play in our player, finally took a chance with this one, and I'm very satisfied with it. The first disk shows you the option (in English writing) to have English audio, but the disks 2-6 are all in Chinese writing, so it's a little harder to find where to switch from Chinese to English audio, but once you know where to click, it's no problem. On the menu screen on disks 2-6, click the option on the furthest right, and on the next screen, just click the second option. Use your controller to go back to the main screen, push play, and you're set! I highly recommend this product for all the Peppa lovers who can't find region 1 compatible DVDs (I know I couldn't).",1329091200,5,795,4.342281879194631
7900577,5,7885167909,"I got my product in 5 days from the seller. Great service and communication! The DVD set contains 6 DVDs and to answer your question: YES IT DOES play in an US DVD player! You can choose either to listen to Peppa in Chinese or English and choose if you want subtitles in Chinese, English or none at all as well. I think it would be a great way to learn Chinese if you would want to! I don't understand why they make it difficult for us that live in the United States to get more Peppa Pig but this is a great option! Great price and great service. Can't beat that.",1328745600,,564,4.044642857142857
7900578,5,7885167909,This 6 DVD set is an awesome buy at $35.00! The seller does not state in the product description that this is a region free dvd so it plays on all dvd players. There are a total of 62 episodes in this set. And to think there is actually a seller out of Florida selling one disc for $350.00!!!! This item was shipped from China and i received it within a week.,1326672000,12,359,4.0
