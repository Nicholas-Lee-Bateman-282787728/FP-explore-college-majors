8532838,5,B008YYSEK2,"I bought this for the weight loss workout, which I did to get back into shape after having my kids several years ago but I seem to have misplaced my original.  I appreciate the moderate pace and the duration which, together, make for a challenging workout without killing my lungs.  It seems that so many of the more recent videos want to cram all the results into a 20 minute window which is way too hard for me. The weight loss workout is really long but it's done at pace that let's me keep up.",1423872000,,497,4.221052631578948
8532839,5,B008YYSEK2,"I just bought this for the weight loss workout because I used to have it, but it's so much better now because you can just straight to the workout instead of having to fast forward through talking. yay!",1413763200,,202,4.342105263157895
8532840,5,B008YYSEK2,"Seriously, the ab workout gives such great advice that you will take that information with you for years!  I had this workout in video and so glad to have it in dvd.  Also, the leg workout is really good and suits my bad knee . . . I am a total Kathy Smith fan. After all these years and all the workouts I have done, she is so far ahead of everyone. Period.",1412467200,2,358,3.8904109589041096
