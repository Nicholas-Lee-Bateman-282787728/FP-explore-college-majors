8747509,3,B01AIX1PX4,"I got this because I really enjoyed ""Cheerleader Camp 2 The Death"" by this same Director. It wasn't what I expected by the trailer, I thought it was more found footage, but that's just at the end. It's actually a really neat Mondo Cane style documentary about ghosts, cults and other supernatural stuff. It had lots of stock footage and narration, but the whole movie felt like an older flick which I thought was cool. A couple interview parts felt a little long, but overall it was a good watch and had me pretty spooked during some parts. Killer artwork too.",1459814400,,560,4.554455445544554
