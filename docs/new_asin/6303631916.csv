711149,5,6303631916,"Simply put, this is one of the finest examples of Doctor Who ever made. The parallel universe Earth is disturbing - the worst parts of Orwellian and Nazi visions combined - and the parallel characters are equally  distrubing.  Only the obsessed Professor Stahlman is the same in both  worlds, both coming to loggerheads with the Doctor.
Jon Pertwee's Doctor  gets a full work out in this story, running from scythingly rude put downs  through saving the world to convincing the unwilling to help him.
At 7  episodes the pacing seems a little long, but that aside this is one of the  finest Doctor Who stories ever made and a worthy addition to any video  collection.",949449600,2,666,4.730434782608696
711150,5,6303631916,"This episode has the third doctor(Jon Pertwee) and his companion Liz Shaw trying to stop the powerful forces of the Inferno project. The UNIT personall also help in this story. The docotr gets sent accidently to a  another world where it's the same people , just differnt problems. This  world shows a nazi like world and the effects of the project here! The  doctor finally realizes he must save both earth from being destroyed! He  also must deal with a gas which changes people to a apelike creature! The  only thing I forgot when I bought it was it Liz Shaw's last episode in the  series! It also has tension, suspense, horror and the third docotors  action sequences!",949363200,,672,4.6440677966101696
711151,5,6303631916,"This could possibly be the best Dr Who story ever made. It's a compelling, disturbing and very human tale that, although 7 episodes long, never drags  (in fact, it seems very rushed). The performances are all topline, the  direction by Douglas Camfield superb and the music and sound effects very  jarring. The parallel Earth scenes, in which England is run by a fascist  government (a ""what if the Nazis won"" scenario), have a  depressing, sterile, Orwellian feel; all the central characters have two  roles, their ""normal"" selves and their parallel personas give  them all added depth. Top marks to the Nicholas Courtney as the Brigade  Leader. Small touches, such as certain pieces of conversational dialogue  played out twice, once in the normal Earth and once in the parallel world,  make a substantial impact on the viewer. The Doctor being placed in a  situation where he cannot save the Earth (or one Earth) is quite haunting  when you consider that ""saving the day"" becomes predictable to  the point of cliche. At the end of the story you can't help feeling  emotionally drained; the deaths of well defined characters and their  parallel selves surviving plays with your feelings, making you both mourn  and rejoice. Like the case with much of Dr Who, the monsters are not often  well realised. The Primords have their moments, but just try not to think  of the Bee Gees when they start rampaging in the later episodes! Best  moments - the cliff hanger to episode 4 and the ""doomsday""  sequences at the end of episode 6. This is must own Dr Who!",947721600,11,1554,4.7924528301886795

711299,4,6303631916,"The story -- a seven-parter from 1970 -- is much too long for modern viewers, but the concept of an alternate universe with different versions of Doctor Who's supporting characters is a great one, and the extras are comprehensive. In addition to exploring the making of the episode, there are half-hour pieces on the history of UNIT, the stunt group that worked on many of the episodes, and a modern documentary on what was done with Doctor Who between its cancellation in the early 90s and the return in 2005, all of which kept my attention. I also enjoyed the production notes subtitle track and the commentary with several key players in the episode.

The plot involves an attempt to drill through the earth's crust, which finds a substance that makes people monsters when they touch it. (Not great visuals -- the monsters have the usual fangs, hairy hands, and a fright wig.) The Doctor, trying to repair his TARDIS, winds up in another version of the Earth where the same experiment is further along, and the totalitarian regime there won't listen to the Doctor's warnings. The best part is seeing more militaristic versions of the Brigadier and Doctor Liz Shaw (in Caroline John's last story).",1456531200,,1199,4.820388349514563

this story is also the farewell to Caroline John ( Liz Shaw) for two reasons. one at the end of this story she was four months pregnant. the second is that producers didn't believe the she was the right type of companion for the doctor.",1439510400,,933,4.212290502793296

711303,5,6303631916,"A little more than forty-five years ago, Doctor Who aired one of the most unique stories in its history. Coming at the end of Season Seven, Jon Pertwee's first year as the Third Doctor, Inferno in many ways is that season's ultimate triumph. Not only that, it is perhaps not only amongst the best stories in all of Doctor Who but the best story of the entire Pertwee era.

Perhaps the big question to ask about this special edition DVD release of the story is if it's worth purchasing given that it was already released several years ago. As the owner of both editions, my answer is a definite yes. The Restoration Team went back and took another crack at restoring the story and their efforts are plainly visible. Watching the story with this release was akin to watching the story again for the first time with huge improvements in the picture quality especially that made the colors more vivid and the picture far smoother. While the original DVD release looked good under the circumstances, this release is well worth the price tag just for these improvements.

Then there's the special features. As well as keeping the various features from the original DVD release including an excellent audio commentary and the nicely assembled making of documentary Can You Hear the Earth Scream?, there's some new features added for this release. The most notable is Hadoke versus HAVOC, in which the man behind the excellent Moths Ate My Doctor Who Scarf meets up with the members of the Pertwee era stunt team and reunites them to demonstrate one of the stunts they frequently used on the show with Mr. Hadoke performing the stunt in question. The other notable addition is an entry in the Doctor Forever series focusing on the aborted 1993 special Lost In The Dark Dimension which features interviews with a number of people involved with it as well as looking at some of the other aborted attempts to get the show off the ground during the Wilderness Years. The combination of improved restoration work and these new special features makes the potentially double dipping well worth it.

What about the story itself though? Well at its heart perhaps, Inferno follows the formula established in earlier stories such as Silurians and The Ambassadors Of Death. UNIT and the Doctor are yet again at a government funded scientific project that is attempting to drill through the Earth's crust to penetrate pockets of Stahlman's Gas, which is theorized to be able to provide nearly cheap endless energy. The project, nicknamed the Inferno by the technicians working upon it, is headed by a brilliant but egotistical Professor Stahlman who views virtually everyone around him with suspicion due to his belief they are trying to slow or stop him and the project.

While the Doctor and Liz are there working on the TARDIS console in an attempt to get in working, the Brigadier and UNIT are investigating  a series of strange events and deaths. Despite growing concerns,  the project proceeds on even when a mysterious green substance begins to ooze out of one of  the drill's output pipers from deep within the Earth itself. Unable to stop the project and becoming increasingly confrontational with  Stahlman, the Doctor's attempts to fix the TARDIS land him in a parallel universe where the project not only exists in a Fascist Britain  along with familiar faces, but is actually considerably ahead of the one he left behind.

It's when the story reaches the parallel Fascist Britain that the story really picks up. Like the Star Trek episode Mirror, Mirror (which had yet to air in the UK at the time), the story takes familiar characters and settings and gives them a delightful twist. Everyone but the Doctor is represented here raging from an even more egotistical Professor Stahlman, Sergeant Benton as a despicable thug and Liz not as a brilliant scientist but the assistant to the worst one of all: the Brigadier (known in this world as the Brigade Leader). It is a world stripped of morality and these seemingly familiar characters embody that fact.

It's in the parallel world as well that we see some of the best work out of the regular cast. Pertwee's Doctor is often noted for being assertive and authoritative but, in an interesting precursor to what would happen to Tennant's Tenth Doctor in Midnight decades later, he seems unable to convince anyone to believe him upon his arrival. Indeed, part of what makes the middle episodes of the story so interesting is watching the Doctor try and deal with the situation, often struggling to do so as his usual combination of charm and authority fails miserably. All of  which leads to some great moments both serious and comedic from Pertwee.

The real star of the story though might be Nicholas Courtney. Up until his passing in 2011, he would always cite this story as his favorite and it isn't hard to see why. While he's legendary to Doctor Who fans for playing the Brigadier, it's really here that we get to see the man's acting chops. The Brigade Leader might look like the Brigadier but he certainly isn't him: behind the eye-patch is a bully who is really nothing more then a coward at heart who struggles to deal with the situation once things go wrong and his troops all but desert him. As the Brigade Leader, Courtney loses all the charm and dry humor he brought to the Brigadier and plays a thoroughly nasty and likeable piece of work which helped to make the story all the more iconic.

The story also benefits from its extra episodes in other ways. The story has time to unfold and remains tense thanks to Don Houghton's script and the combined direction of Douglas Camfield and Barry Letts. Houghton's script uses the extra episodes to its advantage, throwing the parallel universe plot into the middle of the story (something that, as Letts and Dicks admit elsewhere on the DVD, was initially meant to bring the story up to length) and actually being better for it since it allows us to see the consequences of the project in a parallel world which hightens the tension once the story shifts back to the normal universe. The story's direction both from Camfield (who did the first two episodes and all the exterior film sequences before becoming ill) and Letts (who directed all the interior scenes in the rest of the story) give the story an almost filmic quality despite it being set largely within a couple of buildings though it's perhaps the filmed sequences which standout the best.

The production values of the story are strong as well. There's some excellent excellent set design to the costumes, especially when the story shifts over to the fascist parallel world. The Primords, the monsters of the story, prove the old saying that less is more as the designers go for a simpler approach to them, using the fact that they're played by actors in make-up to their advantage. Last but not least is the music which isn't much a score as a collection of stock music, some of which was composed by Delia Derbyshire. The music though was well picked as it adds tension and atmosphere when it's used, which is sparingly used. All of which makes Inferno one of the best looking and least dated Doctor Who stories of its time.

All told, Inferno's Special Edition release is well worth the price. The new restoration work and added documentaries more than make the potential double dip purchase worth it, the former especially improves on the original release. Then there's the story itself which stands as one of the most unique stories in all of Doctor Who but also as the best story of the Pertwee era. For those who have seen and does who haven't, this is a must have for any serious Doctor Who fan.",1435968000,5,7665,4.760542168674699

711382,5,6303631916,"This story was a real treat. I had never seen it before, but I have seen most of the 3rd Doctor's stories, so I have a pretty good idea of how the series developed during the early 70's. This one just might be my favorite so far. The acting is very strong, with distinctive personality differences between the characters in our Earth, as well as the parallel Earth featured in the story. You can tell Nicholas Courtney (The Brigadier) had fun making this, as he plays a hilariously rascally villain on the alternate Earth. One of the strongest performances, however, was by Derek Newark for the character of Greg Sutton, an engineer who had been called in to assist with the drilling project. The intensity and dynamism of his delivery really took you into the story.

I won't go into the special features here, because other reviewers have probably done that already, and they're easy to look up for anyone curious. However, I will mention that the overall quality of this release was most excellent.

I can't really find anything to complain about on this one. Easy 5 stars.",1400803200,4,1076,4.6878306878306875
711383,5,6303631916,"This serial was the last of the Doctor's seventh series which was was the first color series starring Jon Pertwee. This series was set when the Doctor was stranded on Earth and is working for UNIT.

A driven scientist, Professor Stallman has gotten the British government to go along with a project to drill to the Earth's core. The Doctor is one of several advisers called in by Sir Keith Gold to provide expert advice. However, Stallman ignores the Doctor as he does everyone else that contradicts his message of, ""Faster.""

The story gets interesting when mysterious motiveless murders rock the project. The story reaches its central point when at the Episode 2, the Doctor disappears with the Tardis council into another dimension where he encounters alternate versions of his friends who live in and reflect the values of a totalitarian militaristic state. They're also working on the same project and heading towards a cataclysm.

This serial was amazing. The seven episodes built great tension and has a lot of great twists. This is the best alternate universe story I've ever seen. While there's plenty of action, monsters, suspense, and typical Doctor Who fare, this one really works on a dramatic level. The situation on the alternate Earth changes leading each character to facing a fate and it's fascinating to watch how they develop and respond in the midst of the crisis. It's a fantastic character study as Caroline John and Nicholas Courtney turn in great performances as alternate versions of their normal characters. In addition, the story deals with arrogance, mortality, and the dangers of bureaucracy and unquestioned authority.

The only downside is that there are transfer issues on the sixth and seventh episodes of this series on the 2006 DVDs leading to some video quality issues on a few outdoor scenes. This may be a case where the newer DVD might produce better results.

Regardless of how you watch it, this is a must watch for any science fiction fan.",1393545600,,1982,4.957831325301205

Of course this wouldn't destroy the world but you might cause a volcano at least!  This features a great cast and engaging story. Jon pertwee's action doctor is here to battle the disaster as well!  He's a dashing swashbuckler and that's a change for sure. In the immortal words of the rock group kiss ,  this episode is 'hotter than hell""!  and They did a good job of restoring this episode. The effects are from 1970 of course so anyone who can't handle old sci fi , won't be as thrilled as audiences were back then.  IT has special features on this one , as most doctor stories do as well.",1388707200,,776,4.422535211267606
711385,5,6303631916,"Hailing from Jon Pertwee's amazing first season, Inferno is a true classic.  As a governmental instillation seeks to dig through the Earth's crust, a green goo bubbles forth turing men into beasts.  When a crucial experiment fails, The Third Doctor is transported to an alternate universe, one where the project is far more advanced and a doomed world is about to die screaming.

Even at 7 episodes, the story doesn't feel that padded.  It is partially directed by Douglas Camfield, the best of Who's early directors.

While most special editions offer extra special features, this one is worth buying for the improved picture quality. Compared to the 2006 release it is like night and day, thanks to advances in restoration techniques.

Some Doctor Who special editions seem like a double dip, but this is well worth the upgrade",1388275200,2,829,4.971014492753623
711386,5,6303631916,"There is no denying that season 7, Jon Pertwee's first season, was amazing in almost every single way. ""Spearhead from Space"" was a very good opener, ""Doctor Who and the Silurians"" was an excellent story, if a bit too long, and ""The Ambassadors of Death"" was brilliant. ""Inferno"" not only ranks as the best of that season, but in my opinion, as the best of the era.

The story has an incredibly dark feel to it, and the script by Don Houghton is marvelous. Pertwee is at his very best, and I actually happen to like Liz Shaw, played by the late Caroline John. Nicholas Courtney does a wonderful job playing both the Brigadier and the Brigade Leader in the parallel universe. The entirety of the supporting cast is just excellent. The story itself conveys a powerful message, and it is impossible to not be compelled while watching. In fact, I had tears welling up in my eyes by the end of episode 6. This story is a masterpiece.

Being a special edition release, this DVD is packed with special features. There's a commentary by Nicholas Courtney, John Levene, Barry Letts, and Terrance Dicks. There is also a really fascinating documentary on the making of the story called ""Can You Hear the Earth Scream?"" And many other assorted documentaries and special features, including a coming soon trailer for ""The Mind of Evil"".

711466,5,6303631916,"This series is a 7-parter with a lot going on, so it's hard to make a brief synopsis. It starts with Harry Slocum, cheerful mechanic, arriving at a bunker control room. He reports to Sir Keith Gold, Executive Director of the government-funded project, nicknamed ""Inferno"", to drill through the Earth's crust. The No. 2 coolant pipe for the drill-head in the next room needs servicing, and Slocum gets to work. The sarcastic Professor Stahlman.arrives, and takes Sir Keith to task for taking No. 2 off-line. This project is his baby and nothing, and he means nothing, should slow its progress.

In the meanwhile, poor Slocum is at No. 2 when green goo starts bubbling up through the grid. When he touches it, it burns. Then his whole hand turns green. The next we see Slocum, walking with unfocused gaze and stilted gait, he makes his way unnoticed out of the bunker. To kill the first man he meets.

Fortunately, Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart and Sergeant Benton are there, as UNIT is in charge of project security. Even more fortunately, the Doctor and Liz Shaw have just arrived as a consultants, though the real reason the Doctor has finagled his position is so he can tap into the drill's dedicated nuclear reactor to fix his TARDIS console.

By the time they catch up with Slocum, his fingers have turned to hairy claws, his whole skin is green and he's sprouted wild hair and fangs. Two bullets to the heart slow him down, but it's a fire extinguisher which kills finally kills him. The Doctor tells the Brigadier that he recognizes the sounds Slocum was making, ""Krakatoa... the volcanic eruption of 1883.""  What happened to Slocum's body, as he turned into a Primord, was ""retrogression of the body cells"".

Now it gets really interesting. The Doctor starts the TARDIS and he and the console disappear. From then on, we see alternating scenes of Liz et al trying to stop Stalhman's drilling in the real world (Warp 1), and the Doctor trying to survive in a parallel world where England is a fascist state (Warp 2).

Curiously, they are also drilling through the crust in Warp 2, though they are hours ahead of the drilling back home. Twelve seconds from breakthrough in Warp 2 the earth starts to shake and a terrible sound comes from the drilling rig. ""Listen to that!"", the Doctor cries, ""It's the sound of this planet screaming out its rage.""

Can planet Earth be saved in either universe?

""Inferno"" first aired  in May/June 1970. This review is for the 2006 2-disc DVD release. A Special Edition DVD will be released in June, 2013.

For a 7 part series, there is little down time in the plot, and the action keeps going. There's lots of varied characters, all well-drawn, and it is a hoot to see the Warp 2 Brigadier with a dashing scar and eyepatch, not to mention a sneer.

Though I like this episode, the main plot-point is not resolved to my satisfaction. That is, if drilling down through the crust lets loose a green goo,  then if they stop drilling, the green goo is still there - and it's unexplained. Is it alien?  Is it Mother Earth? Is it destroyed at the same time as the planet when the crust bursts open and lava flows over all man has made? Or, after the surface is cleansed by the lava, does the goo start all over again in creating life on this planet? Perhaps the inconclusiveness is deliberate.

Extras for the 2006 2-disc set:

Disc 1 Extras:
1. Information Text. As usual, I enjoyed the extra tidbits given in the Info Text. Such as, in episode 2, the Doctor climbs up on high towers, and this was problematic, because Pertwee was afraid of heights.
Another comment: "" `Inferno' was partially inspired by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's short story, `When the World Screamed' (1928), in which... Professor Challenger tunnels through the crust of the Earth.... His theory is that Earth is a living organism, with a protective outer shell, the crust.""
2. Commentary Track. Commentators are Barry Letts (producer), Nicholas Courtney (plays Brigadier), Terrance Dicks (script editor) and John Levene (plays Benton).
Courtney calls ""Inferno"" a ""cracking good story"". He's said many times before that it's his favorite serial because it was such fun playing a bad guy. ""I love curling a lip.""
Levene, who has a lovely velvety voice and is a notoriously nice person, says, ""Trying to look tough when you're not is actually quite a stretch."" He was trying to limit his smoking, and, regarding the scenes where he's in Primord make-up, ""I told my children that's what would happen to them if they smoked cigarettes.""

711467,5,6303631916,"""Inferno"" is a 7-parter with a lot of great action, so it's hard to make a brief synopsis. It starts with Harry Slocum, cheerful mechanic, arriving at a bunker control room. He reports to Sir Keith Gold, Executive Director of the government-funded project, nicknamed ""Inferno"", to drill through the Earth's crust. The No. 2 coolant pipe for the drill-head needs servicing, and Slocum gets to work. The sarcastic Professor Stahlman arrives, and takes Sir Keith to task for taking No. 2 off-line. This project is his baby and nothing, and he means nothing, should slow its progress.

In the meanwhile, poor Slocum is at No. 2 when green goo starts bubbling up through the grid. When he touches it, it burns. Then his whole hand turns green. The next we see Slocum, walking with unfocused gaze and stilted gait, he makes his way unnoticed out of the bunker. To kill the first man he meets.

Fortunately, Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart and Sergeant Benton are there, because UNIT is in charge of project security. Even more fortunately, the Doctor and Liz Shaw have just arrived as a consultants, though the real reason the Doctor has finagled his position is so that he can tap into the drill's dedicated nuclear reactor to fix his TARDIS console.

By the time they catch up with Slocum, his fingers have turned to hairy claws, his whole skin is green and he's sprouted wild hair and fangs. Two bullets to the heart slow him down, but it's a fire extinguisher which finally kills him. The Doctor tells the Brigadier that he recognizes the sounds Slocum was making, ""Krakatoa... the volcanic eruption of 1883.""  The Doctor explains that what happened to Slocum's body, as he turned into a Primord, was ""retrogression of the body cells"".

Now it gets really interesting. The Doctor starts the TARDIS and he and the console disappear. From then on, we see alternating scenes of Liz et al trying to stop Stalhman's drilling in the real world (Warp 1), and the Doctor trying to survive in a parallel world where England is a fascist state (Warp 2).

Curiously, they are also drilling through the crust in Warp 2, though they are hours ahead of the drilling back home. Twelve seconds from breakthrough in Warp 2, the earth starts to shake and a terrible sound comes from the drilling rig. ""Listen to that!"" the Doctor cries, ""It's the sound of this planet screaming out its rage.""

Can planet Earth be saved in either universe?

""Inferno"" first aired in May/June 1970. This review is for the 2013 Special Edition DVD release. ""Inferno"" has already been released on DVD on a 2-disc set in 2006. Both sound and picture have been digitally remastered for the Special Edition. An upgrade in sound will be welcome. Lots of the action takes place in the bunker with the drilling, and the background noise, though appropriate, does sometimes interfere with the dialogue.

For a 7 part series, there is little down time in the plot, and the action and humor, too, keeps going. There's lots of varied characters, all well-drawn, and it is a hoot to see the Warp 2 Brigadier with a dashing scar and eyepatch, not to mention a sneer.

Though I do like this series, the main plot-point is not resolved to my satisfaction. That is, if drilling down through the crust lets loose a green goo,  then if they stop drilling, the green goo is still there - and it's unexplained. Is it alien?  Is it Mother Earth? Is it destroyed at the same time as the planet when the crust bursts open and lava flows over all that man has made? Or, after the surface is cleansed by the lava, does the goo start all over again in creating life on this planet? Perhaps the inconclusiveness is deliberate.

Extras for the 2013 2-disc set, some of which carry forward from the 2006 DVD release:

1. Commentary Track (2006) Commentators are Barry Letts (producer), Nicholas Courtney (plays Brigadier), Terrance Dicks (script editor) and John Levene (plays Benton).
Courtney calls ""Inferno"" a ""cracking good story"". He's said many times before that it's his favorite serial because it was such fun playing a bad guy. ""I love curling a lip.""
Levene, who has a lovely velvety voice and is a notoriously nice person, says, ""Trying to look tough when you're not is actually quite a stretch."" At the time, he was trying to limit his smoking, and, regarding the scenes where he's in Primord make-up, ""I told my children that's what would happen to them if they smoked cigarettes.""
2. ""Can You Hear the Earth Scream?"" (2006, 45 minutes) This is a Making-Of featurette, narrated by David Harley. Commentators include Terrance Dicks, Barry Letts, Caroline John (plays Liz Shaw), John Levene, Nicholas Courtney, Derek Ware (plays private Wyatt, and is a founder of Havoc, the stuntman company used), Ian Fairbairn (plays Bromley) and Alan Chuntz (stuntman, from a 1970 feature).
Terrance Dicks says, ""Derek was a very good stunt man. He had a very good team working for him. So we just quite ruthlessly, with the writer, put in all kinds of things on the assumption they'd be able to cope.""
3. ""Hadoke versus HAVOC"" (new, 27 minutes) Toby Hadoke, who has moderated several commentaries on Dr. Who DVD releases, gets together with Derek Ware, Roy Scammell, Derek Martin and Stuart Fell. They were all members of HAVOC, the stunt company that worked on ""Inferno"". These experts try to train Hadoke so he can perform a stunt himself. That will make him an honorary HAVOC-er.
4. ""Doctor Forever! Lost in the Dark Dimension"" (new, 27 minutes) Fourth of a the five-part ""Doctor Forever!"" documentary. This part look at how the spirit of Doctor Who was kept alive in the years between the end of the classic series and the beginning of the new. In this episode, they look at several attempts to bring the show back during that period. Commentators include Tom Spilsbury, John Freeman & Gary Russell (current and former Doctor Who Magazine editors), Steve Cole (former BBC range editor), David Burton (actor), Adrian Rigelsford (writer), Graeme Harper (director) and new series executive producer Russell T Davies. Narration by Zeb Soanes.
[In a comment to this review, I've added where you can find the other parts of the Doctor Forever series.]
5. ""The UNIT Family - Part 1"" (2006) Commentators include Terrance Dicks, Derrick Sherwin (script editor/producer 1967-69), Nicholas Courtney, Derek Ware, John Levene, Caroline John and Barry Letts. This feature looks at the now Earthbound Doctor's 'family' during his exile to Earth.
Levene's first job on Dr. Who was an extra playing a Yeti!

8. Production Notes Subtitles (2006) Sometimes called information Text. I enjoy the tidbits of information, such as how, in episode 2, it was problematic when the Doctor climbs up on high towers. Pertwee was afraid of heights.
More notes: "" `Inferno' was partially inspired by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's short story, `When the World Screamed' (1928), in which... Professor Challenger tunnels through the crust of the Earth.... His theory is that Earth is a living organism, with a protective outer shell, the crust.""

As for WHY is the BBC doing a Special Edition, I read this on a blog: ""Inferno was one of the stories that had Reverse Standard Conversion applied to the existing NTSC version. This remastering can now be done much more successfully and the quality of the episodes will be much better than the original.""

711468,4,6303631916,"Hadn't seen this one before! That's a new one for any available Who on the market or indeed broadcast recently, what a fantastic gem of a story to not have seen from this period, I always love alternate reality sci-fi stories (mirror universe Trek) and it was fantastic to see the evil Lethbridge-Stewart,  but have to say that the character of Greg Sutton was quite the same and acted as the cross Scientist for voice volume control throughout! Despite the effects looking dated, was an absolute treat!",1356825600,,503,4.781609195402299
711469,5,6303631916,If you are a Doctor Who fan you will like this DVD story is great but special effects are ok.,1356393600,,93,3.7
711470,5,6303631916,"I used to think that Tom Baker was the ultimate Doctor Who for a lot of reasons but ""Inferno"" made me really take notice of his predecessor, Jon Pertwee and now I consider it a tie between them, at least in terms of my screen viewing affection.  There are indeed many other fine stories from the Pertwee Era (along with a few stinkers) but this 7-Part Story just has everything I look for in a Doctor Who Story.

I don't even bother to get hung up on the poor special effects.  The Brits are simply the best storytellers around and this one abounds with great character development in the supporting cast.  The arrogant Professor Stahlman with his sense of urgency to fuel his oversized ego which is continually deflated by the good doctor is one of the ongoing interractions that make this one memorable.  Recurring character, UNIT Leader Brigadeer Lethbridge Stuart (Nicholas Courtney)gets to shine in a dual-role (with the second role a nazi-like commander counterpart) thanks to this being a parallel universe story.

Other than the parallel universe theme, it is a story of scientific arrogance and messing around with things not fully understood in terms of the periolous implications (penetration of the earth's crust) despite all the warning signs of green slime which is messing up the works.  As usual, it is the doctor that has to come to the rescue via his intelligence and talents, all the while dealing with human emotions/tensions and internal backstabbing swirling all around him.  Another notable guest featured in this story is Christopher Benjamin, who later created the enduring character of ""Jago"" in ""The Talons of Weng Chiang"" during the Tom Baker Era.  Benjamin plays a rival scientist/facility administrator to Professor Stahlman who is a reasonable man trying to slow down the erratic impulses of the latter but is outmatched at every turn.

The thing about the Jon Pertwee Era is of course, that it is based on UNIT Stories set on earth which does have its limitations sometimes in Science Fiction.  However, this one shines above many, not only in the Pertwee Era but across the entire Doctor Who Serials in general. This setting does allow for the character interractions and subsequent development as the most essential elements in the stories which is what I like and ""Inferno"" maximizes this inherent potential.",1355184000,,2343,4.966751918158568
711564,5,6303631916,"""Inferno"" takes a relatively ho-hum story about drilling through the earth's crust and makes it pop with a clever subplot about a parallel Earth in which a fascist government rules Britain. This was a seminal serial for the Third Doctor and is a must-have for any Doctor Who DVD collection.

The parallel-Earth scenes were needed to stretch an otherwise routine four-parter to seven parts: The Doctor and UNIT are keeping tabs on a scientific project to drill through the earth's crust to harness a new energy source. The drilling releases a hot green goo resembling Pert shampoo that turns whomever it touches (and whomever they touch) into werewolf-like ""Primords"" that run amok, killing anyone who crosses their path. To make things interesting, the Doctor is transported while trying to repair the TARDIS console to an alternate Earth inhabited by parallel, villainous versions of the usual UNIT characters (Lethbridge-Stewart with a wicked facial scar and eyepatch, a dark-haired Liz Shaw as a soldier instead of a scientist, Sgt. Benton as a cruel bully, etc.). The implication is, Germany won the Second World War and Britain now lives under the heel of the jackboot, although the origins of this alternative, fascist future are never fully explained.

Cleverly, however, the story does not include a parallel Doctor because, quite rightly, the Doctor exists ""outside"" of time. Parallel Earth is also drilling through the earth's crust (at an even faster, more dangerous rate), so the Doctor must escape before Earth 2 is destroyed and return to Earth 1 in time to stop the drilling project there. The intricately plotted script by Don Houghton is first-rate, so it's a shame he would write only one other serial for Doctor Who, ""The Mind of Evil,"" before moving on to several other TV series, including Sapphire & Steel. (He died in 1991.) Director Douglas Camfield took seriously ill with a heart condition after only the first two episodes of ""Inferno"" were in the can, so producer Barry Letts had to take over directing duties while Camfield's wife, actress Sheila Dunn, soldiered on as Dr. Petra Williams while her hubby was in hospital.

This two-disc set adds a generous helping of Special Features, including ""The UNIT Family: Part 1,"" a history of the global troubleshooting organization (Part 2 comes with ""Day of the Daleks""), as well as an above-average making-of documentary, ""Can You Hear the Earth Scream?"" A promo reel on the BBC's special-effects department comes across as a bit self-important if not downright silly, with spaceships that are obviously models hanging on wires tottering through space.",1323043200,,2626,5.116550116550116
711565,5,6303631916,"Meddling in the unknown tends to be a deadly practice in the Dr. Who stories, and ""Doctor Who: Inferno (Story 54)"" brings on a fresh disaster from below the Earth's crust. The sci-fi threat is never really explained, but the rest of the serial is absolutely brilliant -- harrowing, intense, and featuring a brief glimpse of an alternate reality.

UNIT is overseeing security for a special drilling project, which is planning to release energy-rich Stahlman's Gas from under the Earth's crust. But then a strange green goop oozes out of the pipes, causing anyone who touches it to turn into a savage greeny-gray creature -- and anyone who touches THEM will also be infected.

The project's leader, Professor Stahlman, refuses to acknowledge that anything might be wrong, claiming that everybody is conspiring to stop the drilling -- and even sabotaging the computer when it predicts failure. And the Doctor may be the only person who can stop the disaster.

Unfortunately, the Doctor's attempts to fix the Tardis have transported him into a parallel universe, where Britain is a fascist state and the Brigadier is a controlling little tyrant. Unfortunately, the drilling project is going on in this world as well -- and though the Doctor soon learns that it spells doom for the Earth, he may not be able to get back in time to save our reality.

The biggest problem with ""Inferno"" is the green goop, which is... never really explained. I would have preferred a little more explanation for why it turns people into manged gray-skinned freaks. B

ut aside from that quibble, this particular serial is a powerful, intense sci-fi story, especially since the Doctor is rendered helpless through most of it. In fact, it's kind of nightmarish when he's trapped in the fascist Other-Britain, unable to get home, stop the drilling, or do much of anything.

And the most terrifying part of the story is that the exact same events are unfurling in our own world, only slightly more slowly (probably due to that pesky free speech). The Other-Britain is swarmed by gray ape-people and faced with... well, the whole planet blowing up due to improbable science, and the Doctor can't really deal with it.

Jon Pertwee gives his best Dr. Who performance thus far, mostly relying on the Third Doctor's sharp-eyed, acerbic charm and short temper, but also showing his more charismatic side. Nicholas Courtney also has a wonderful turn as both the usual Brigadier and the cruel, power-hungry Brigade Leader, which gives a glimpse of what the stuffy, bossy soldier would have turned into in a different world.

 ""Doctor Who: Inferno (Story 54)"" is a strong, lean story with lots of suspense -- and a particularly good subplot set in a parallel world. Definitely a must-see for fans of Who.",1305504000,,2767,4.920600858369099
711566,5,6303631916,"I have a funny relationship with the ""Doctor Who"" TV show.  As much as I love it, I have to admit that there are certain patches that I'm very unfamiliar with.  For example, with Jon Pertwee's 5-year turn in the role, I've only really seen his last two years as The Doctor.  Imagine my surprise when I watched the 7-part epic ""Inferno"".  If this Pertwee Year #1 finale was any indication, he was always terrific in the role with some terrific help from his co-stars and the production team.

Like many ""Doctor Who"" stories, ""Inferno"" doesn't like very much on the surface.  A team of scientists are drilling to the Earth's core, hoping to harness its energy for the good of mankind.  Unfortunately, drilling exposes green ooze that (Part 2 Spoiler) infects people into terrible creatures who need heat to survive.  But like the best ""Doctor Who"" stories, you shouldn't judge this one by its cover.
The Doctor is always a great character, and Brigadier Stewart is the pompous/dutiful straight man, as always.  I've only seen Liz Shaw in this particular serial, but she's already a companion that fascinates me.  But ""Inferno"" does a very good job of making its particular supporting characters interesting.  There's the obsessed Dr. Stahlman, whose passion for completing the drilling project leads to some dangerous turn-of-events.  His loyal assistant Petra from start to finish shows a conflict to remain loyal to Stahlman, even when he's clearly behaving irrationally.  Sir Keith Gordon and Sutton are the good-natured Ministry advisor and oil-rig specialist, respectively, who Stahlman sees as enemies to his cause, even though both are desperately trying to help him.  It's this clash of wills between Stahlman and everyone else that gives ""Inferno"" its charge when the sci-fi plot is taking a little while to pick up, because everyone wants to achieve the same admirable goal with different ethical & moral boundaries.  Then again, when The Doctor's advice is refused, perhaps he is just as selfish and impossible as the strong-ego Stahlman.

I may kick myself for giving away this awesome surprise for Part 3, but I feel that it's necessary to share since the early Green Ooze hook might not convince any skeptics out there.  For reasons I won't give away, The Doctor's work on the TARDIS inadvertently sends him to a parallel universe where everyone The Doctor knows has a completely different personality, history, & agenda.  UNIT is now a Nazi-like ""Republic"", and the stakes on the drilling project are even deadlier.  The Doctor must now juggle the obstacles for two parallel universes!  I won't give anymore except to say that ""Inferno"" handles this fine-line scenario with very intelligent writing and mostly-reasonable suspense.  I say ""mostly-reasonable"" because this 7-part story has a lot of moments where people continuously doubt The Doctor's logical conclusions, even after repeatedly proving himself in the face of danger.  Thankfully, the performances are so good that you won't care as much as you'd think.  The infected creatures, however, lead to some silly action scenes.  The science and concept behind them is great, but the TV show's low budget probably didn't allow them to deliver more convincing violence than today's audiences might crave.  The worst offense is a brief fistfight where the landed punches have no sound effects.

As with a good number of ""Dotor Who"" stories, ""Inferno"" is probably a little too long.  Its 7-part structure (roughly 3 hours) could've been condensed down to six episodes, in my opinion.  But if you remember that ""Doctor Who"" sometimes works better when you watch complete serials in small doses, rather than all in one sitting, than that's a forgivable misstep too.  Besides, the quality of the writing and acting in ""Inferno"" is so intelligent and sharp, it's hard to complain about some of these nitpicks.  I continue to give this advice for my favorite ""Doctor Who"" stories: If you're a longtime fan, don't hesitate to buy this terrific story.  And if you're a new ""Doctor Who"" fan, worry not.  ""Inferno"" is one of the best from its era, and you'll catch on before you know it.",1299628800,2,4145,5.014619883040936
711567,5,6303631916,"The eternal question for any Dr. Who fan- What is your favorite episode of all time?  Harder to answer than the same question being asked about other shows.  There have been so many unique actors inhabiting this role, and so many different eras, how do you narrow it down?

For me, Inferno makes it to top of the heap fairly easily.  A bit of padding at 7 episodes?  Yes, Perhaps.  A plot that makes very little sense?  Again, admittedly, guilty as charged (What exactly turns everyone into green werewolves, and what does that have to do with the rest of the plot?).  And could they spend any more time demonstrating, essentially, the use of a garage door opener?  However, for some odd reason, all of this is entirely forgivable!

Great story, lot of action, fantastic performance by my favorite Doctor (Pertwee), and incredibly strong performances by all of the supporting characters.

Great DVD package here as well.  Lot's of good extras.  I also thought this one had one of the better audio commentaries.  Terrance Dicks is always a pleasure because, while he has humor, he obviously really took what he did seriously and his pride in the show comes through.  John Levene was a revelation.  His ""normal"" voice was very different than his character voice as Sgt. Bentoon.  Mr. Levene did very little acting before or after his run on Dr. Who, and it is endearing the way he still regards his turn on the show as a highlight of his life.

It sounded like a very good story, but then again I had my doubts about it since it is a seven-parter. Even the good stories are usually ruined by having more than 4 parts in them causing them to drag on forever. But this one was amazing. It's so exciting and has so many ideas in it, it went by so fast that it didn't even seem like seven parts. All of the acting and directing was great. Most of the special effects were pretty good (like when the Earth is engulfed by lava). It has great cliffhangers, and a lot of action in it.

In this story, a research team is attempting to drill to the center of the Earth. But the research director is so obsessed with getting it done fast that he neglects to take any kind of safety measures. A strange green substance has started linking out of the earth's crust causing humans to mutate into dangerous zombie/werewolf-like creatures, the Doctor is thrown into a parallel universe during a time experiment where all his friends are like Nazis, and both worlds will soon be destroyed in a massive flood of molton lava.

Not so here. At least with the alternate world. As Terrance Dicks points out in the commentary, it's the one time that the writers got to ""blow up the world"" Inferno is a doom-laden, serious story, and, unusual for seven parts, just flies by. Project Inferno is trying to drill below the earth to unlock a new type of energy, which has been named ""Stahlman's gas.""

Doesn't sound like enough plot? Add in that the Doctor's trying to work his TARDIS with just the console, and when a result of too much energy occurs, he's forced into the alternate world. Same people, except he can't trust these new versions. Stahlman's as up himself in this world, Liz is more of an anti-hero, and the Brigadier (sorry, Brigade Leader) is the one trying to stop the Doctor.

I anticipated either liking it or hating it after one episode. This was to be my last Jon Pertwee story I purchased if I didn't like it. To my surprise, I enjoyed this adventure. The character interactions were entertaining and the alternate timeline characters added to the story. Growing up watching the Tom Baker Doctor Who, it was entertaining to see familiar characters such as Sgt. Benton and the Brigadier. If you never tried the Jon Pertwee series but liked the Tom Baker, you might like this one.",1179360000,2,628,4.666666666666667
711701,4,6303631916,"Apparently, Inferno began life as a much simpler story involving some kind of emergency at a drilling installation, with the Doctor trying to stave off disaster.  But the story wouldn't stretch to the required seven episodes, so the creative team decided to add a subplot about a parallel world with an even bigger drilling catastrophe going on at a parallel drilling facility.  BUT...the story still wouldn't stretch to seven episodes, so the creative team went off and came up with some monsters to terrorize both worlds during the parallel, though slightly different, doomsday scenarios, with still only one Doctor flitting back and forth between parallel realities, trying to please all of the people--even the evil versions of his friends and associates in the alternate world--all of the time.

The result of all this slapping of ideas together is a very exciting Third Doctor story, with some monsters that are never fully accounted for even while they are quite frightening, and a scenario whereby we are to believe that just a teeny bit of careless drilling into the Earth's crust can obliterate the entire planet.

The best part of Inferno is the clever use of the parallel-worlds angle.  Having the Doctor get flung violently into a world where not only is the drilling disaster that much more perilous, but where Britain has become some kind of fascist state that disposed of its Monarchy the hard way, is brilliant.  The alternate versions of the Doctor's old friends--Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart and Liz Shaw--are puppets of the paranoid, oppressive government, pegging the Doctor for a spy and not believing a word of his story about being from some parallel universe.  And it doesn't matter what universe the Doctor is in--no one seems to want to halt the drilling for Stahlman's Gas (a potential new energy source of great value, just ask the rude, arrogant, reckless, overbearing Dr. Stahlman of either universe--with the green goo on his hands that will probably turn him into a monster in either universe, by the way)--meaning the Doctor is hard-pressed to save any of these stubborn dunderheads.  A nerdy Government-type named Sir Keith, and some kind of security expert named Sutton try to assist the Doctor in shutting things down before it's too late (depending on which universe we're talking about, since Sir Keith isn't alive in both, and both Suttons are distracted by Petra, Stahlmans' much put-upon assistant(s)), but everything just keeps getting worse.  Twice.

I wish there had been some kind of pseudo-scientific gibberish nonsense-explanation spouted by someone--anyone!--for the green goo that occasionally sprays around and hits a scientist, or other poor sod, and begins turning him into a murderous furred killer.  In a show known for its technobabble, the technobabble on these Primord beasties is sadly lacking.  I don't even think they get called Primords during the show proper; you have to watch the credits if you're going to do alright with that particular future trivia question.  And while we're discussing these Primords, they are much scarier in their semi-human form, than later on, when the final transformation produces some rather wonky werewolves with cute noses and teeth that look like they're just going to drop right out of the actors' mouths at any second.  The Primords are also more frightening during the eerie location shoots--like when they are fighting the Doctor on top of high towers and catwalks--than lumbering around the main room of the drilling complex.  In fact, all the location shooting around the drilling installation has a creepy look to it, whereas some of the studio sets are, of course, a bit tacky (welcome to 70's Who).

So the Primords are genuinely scary much of the time, the parallel world is chillingly effective, and the suspense created by the impending apocalypse, twiceover, make this quite a memorable bit of Doctor Who slapdashery.  It shouldn't really work as well as it does, especially since there is so much bickering to fill in the gaps--between two sets of the same pig-headed characters!--but I got hooked on this one as soon as the Doctor found himself in a parallel world that could well prove beyond saving.",1175126400,2,4213,5.0914368650217705
711702,5,6303631916,"No Daleks, no Cybermen, and ""Inferno"" is still a prime example of ""Doctor Who"" at its best, combining an intelligently speculative science-fiction storyline with suspense, action, and a bit of horror. The storyline itself succeeds admirably at the daunting task of interweaving three rather different concepts: the drilling deep through the Earth's crust in search of cheap energy sources, driven by shortsightedness and scientific hubris and ultimately threatening the stability of the planet; accidental displacement into an alternate, parallel timeline, one in which history has run along a recognizably similar but ultimately different track (one in which England is a fascist, 1984-like society); and the retrogressive mutation of people into green, super-strong, savage monsters (admittedly the weakest link of the three, but serving a role to the story as a tangible threat, in any case). And underlying these disparate strands and unifying them is a timely ecological theme handled with judicious, understated subtlety.

Everything else falls into place, too. There are some thrilling action sequences (something we hadn't seen a lot of in ""Doctor Who"" before), with Jon Pertwee doing many of his own stunts a la Jackie Chan and a fine, professional stunt team handling much of the rough stuff. Jon Pertwee is in top form anyway as the swashbuckling, anti-authoritarian third Doctor, and the acting by the rest of the cast is absolutely top-notch--with some of the series regulars playing their alternate, fascist selves very convincingly. There are inspired bits of dialogue throughout, too. The Primords look a bit funny in their wolfish final form, but the special effects have for the most part held up pretty well (which is saying a lot for a 1970 BBC production). Plus we're treated to fine demonstrations of Venusian karate. What more could you ask for from an earth-shattering classic?",1171411200,5,1901,5.357859531772576
711703,3,6303631916,"Not exactly sure why so many rate this as a ""classic"" or ""one of the best Dr. Who's ever"". The whole green ooze turning people into green skinned werewolves who like heat and can be repeled with fire extinguishers, has got to be one of the dumbest plot devices ever thought up for Dr. Who. And while interesting, what the heck does a parallel universe have to do with the main drilling through the earth's crust story? If you watch the DVD extras, they explain the werewolves and parallel dimension were added to stretch it out to 7 episodes, but maybe they should have just picked another story in the first place when they realized the story wasn't long enough for a 7 parter.",1168732800,4,678,4.475806451612903
711704,5,6303631916,"""Inferno"" has always been one of my top ten ""Doctor Who"" stories.  It's got UNIT and Jon Pertwee.  It's got primordial green slime that turns scientists into screeching ape-men.  And it's got the end of the world.  It's got a funny script punctuated by moments of Pertwee's righteous outrage, a guest cast without any misfires (a very rare thing for any ""Doctor Who"" story), and it's long.  All right, I'm admitting my bias for long stories here, but if you've got a good setup going, why not run it out for seven weeks?

Which is why it's astounding to learn, on the DVD release, that the alternate-Earth scenario dominating the middle four episodes of ""Inferno"", wasn't even part of the original story outline!  The script works so perfectly with the parallel world that it's hard to imagine how empty this story would be without it.  Think of all of the seemingly standard lines of dialogue that only pay off because all of our main characters have evil counterparts in the mirror universe.  When Professor Stahlman, the repressed mad scientist trying to drill through the Earth's core, calls our friend Sergeant Benton an ""ape-like minion"", it works because we've just seen alternate Benton turn into an ape a few minutes ago.  When mutinous oil rig foreman Greg Sutton says an idea's so crazy that it might actually work, we laugh because that same idea did work -- when he thought of it in the other universe three episodes ago.  And, of course, the Doctor's joke about the Brigadier's mustache pays off when we finally meet the alternate Brigadier without one -- and he's a cold, evil bully.

Where would this story be if the Earth itself (the alternate one, that is), didn't actually perish at the conclusion of Episode 6?  The long montage of earthquakes, volcanoes, and cliffhanger-inducing lava flows is meant to be the end of a planet.  After seven seasons of menacing Earth, the ""Doctor Who"" production team was actually able to destroy it.  Compare that with the pair of 2006 Cybermen two-parters, which used an alternate earth as a vehicle for a mix of bittersweet and happy endings.  This is pretty daring stuff for 1970!

As always, the deluxe Restoration Team treatment adds much to this release.  As much as I'd always loved Episodes 5 and 6, showing how alternate Stahlman's penetration of the Earth's crust dooms the planet, the DVD text commentary tells us how much better it could have been.  Had the director not fallen ill, and had producer Barry Letts (a relative novice behind the camera) not stepped in, we'd have had reduced lighting and more shadows in those scenes.  The unleashing of the inferno might have been more terrifying than 2006's ""The Impossible Planet"", which recently surpassed ""Inferno"" as DW's best story-set-in-hell.

There's a rule that three-man audio commentary booths usually don't work, because you'll have two geezers talking to each other and the third one left out in the cold.  The ""Inferno"" commentary solves that problem by putting Letts, script editor Terrance Dicks, and Nicholas ""The Brigadier"" Courtney all together.  The three veterans discuss the flaws of the story at hand, praise Christopher Eccleston's turn as the Doctor in the 2005 season, and relate some good anecdotes from the set (even though anyone who's ever been to a DW convention does not need to hear the eyepatch story again).  Their stories only rarely diverge from what the text commentary tells us underneath.  I also loved learning that director Douglas Camfield cast his wife in a pivotal role, but not as his first choice!

Unfortunately, there was a fourth man in the booth and that's what detracts from the set: John ""Sergeant Benton"" Levene somehow got two episodes' worth of commentary almost entirely to himself.  Thus, rote descriptions of what we're watching (""It looks as if the Doctor's going to open that door now, and wasn't Jon Pertwee so wonderful at turning  door handles?"") are alternated with pointless anecdotes about the cast and crew (""Doesn't he look like a chauffeur?"", Levene coos endlessly about a small role in Episode 5).  To be fair, it was interesting to hear more about Camfield and how he motivated Levene's acting career... then again, had Camfield survived to hear this commentary track, he might not have bothered in the first place.

The twin documentaries on the extra disc are, as always, worth a look.  The making-of feature is a bit more standard than we've seen lately -- lots of call sheets superimposed over still photographs, and lots of dates we really don't need to know (""And then it was April 23 so time for the mounting of Episodes 3, 4 and half of 6"").  Better is ""The UNIT Family"", a look at the making of the first six UNIT stories.  Here we see a face new to DW DVDs, former producer Derrick Sherwin, who expounds upon how UNIT came to be in 1968.  Good heavens, he must have been young back then, because he looks barely 60 now.  Also a nice touch is composer Mark Ayres' take on the harpsichord-heavy UNIT theme, which added a touch of class to all those filmed inserts of soldier-laden convoys back in 1971.

A great story, a great DVD presentation.  The worst thing you can say about the disc is that, if there are any easter eggs, they're harder to find than usual... and that, please, please, please don't let John Levene back in the booth by himself!",1168214400,5,5343,4.793668122270742

This was the first Jon Pertwee adventure I saw, and remains my favorite until this day. It is also in my top 10 favorite DOCTOR WHO Series 1 adventures. No, no Daleks, Cybermen or renegade Time Lords.

711796,3,6303631916,"That's the crux of it.  Title says the basic points.

INFERNO was the first view of previous Doctors, pre-Baker, the USA got after the Doctor's rise to popularity in 1979.  Sadly, this story dates even more now, and the restoration team didn't do enough restoration to the sad quality of color on the old tapes or film they worked from.  But, better something then nothing.  They could have chosen much better then INFERNO when digging from the Pertwee era, and alternately they could have chosen worse.

It is 7 episodes, and lags as such.  Every 2 episodes could have been compressed into one.  Pertwee's first season was notorious for a few rooms per story, and then 7 episodes of travelling between rooms and talking, fighting, or running like crazy to escape something.  INFERNO does it best of the others, but it still seems like a way to fill space.  Basic idea is that a scientist is being funded by the UK to drill deep below the crust to discover/create a new and limitless form of energy.  Instead he unleshed a jelly from below that turns people into green werewolves that like heat, and just when things are heating up the Doctor thrusts himself into a sideways dimension, a parallel earth, which is ruled by fascist Britons!(presumably Nazi)  As he attempts to convince them he isn't a spy to the project, he witnesses the world go into werewolf doomsday and returns in the nick of time to save OUR earth from disaster.

Sure, fun for the kiddies, but the magical science fiction and obtuse idea of the lava werewolves is pretty goofy. It is reminiscent of much of Pertwee's era, and the modern Who, where sci-fi is merely a vehicle to be a post modern and magical contrivance instead of a play of perceptions by extrapolating popular science to meet a zeitgeist.  Even funnier is the obviously socialist-British underlying message that only PRUDENT GOVERNMENT can properly control and understand science... what silly bunk.  No wonder no one smiled in EITHER world - socialist dentistry.",1157932800,3,2002,4.795918367346939
711797,5,6303631916,"I saw this a long time ago, and it always has been a favorite.  It has some of the greatest dialogue ever in a Doctor Who adventure, and it has great, intense performances as well.  Keep in mind, everyone (except the Doctor) is playing a dual role here.  The TARDIS slipped sideways in time, and the Doctor ended up in a parallel world ruled by a totalitarian government.  It's fascinating to see the same characters play evil versions of themselves (especially Sgt. Benton, who was always kind of a dullard, and the Brigadeer).  The other performances are superb, especially the character of Sutton, portrayed brilliantly by Derek Newark (who was in the first ever Doctor Who episode An Unearthly Child) who is especially powerful as the drilling expert that thinks the project is going to lead to disaster (which it does, at least in one of the worlds).  Pertwee is superb as well, and has some of the best one liners in Doctor Who history.  A note...I actually saw this in colour on WTTW, Channel 11 in Chicago.  I actually have a VHS copy of it.  Unfortunately, VHS is not known for its high quality, so it's a little worn.  It is possible that WTTW might still have a colour version of it lying around somewhere.  Thankfully, the BBC did transfer this to black and white film, or no one would ever see it again.",1157673600,4,1316,4.5574468085106385
711798,5,6303631916,"Another two adventures with the intrepid Time Lord Doctor Who join the ever expanding library of DVD releases, this time focusing on two earlier eras from the original BBC series featuring Doctor's number one and three - William Hartnell and Jon Pertwee. The Web Planet and Inferno are both lengthy stories which have achieved iconic status in the show's history, albeit for very different reasons.

The earlier story, The Web Planet, a six-part epic from the show's second season, broadcast in the late Winter of 1965 was at the time the most expensive and indeed the most popular story the series had produced. In a very daring move for its era, the story is set in a completely alien world featuring no humanoid characters at all, save for the four regular cast members. The inhabitants of the planet Zarbi are in fact all insect based life forms and the budget for creating all of the required costumes, special effects and unworldly scenes was far higher than the show's normal allowance. Unfortunately, nothing ages faster than special effects and alas, forty-one years later, the cutting edge and innovative design of the show is now somewhat risible. In addition, it has to be said that the storyline itself is somewhat lacking. Early Doctor Who was so much slower than the fast paced drama we expect from modern TV, but even taking that into account The Web Planet certainly drags along somewhat tediously. Yet despite this, viewers at the time lapped it up and it achieved the highest ratings ever recorded for the show until 1975 and indeed only three Doctor Who stories have ever out-stripped it in the audience figures.

Inferno, the fourth and closing story from Jon Pertwee's first season as the Doctor, originally broadcast in the UK in the Spring of 1970, is also hampered by length, stretching to an even longer seven episode count. But somehow, despite the misgivings of the production team, the longer format does in fact work particularly well for this story. Set on present day Earth, the Doctor is worried by a deranged scientist's plans to bore through the Earth's crust to un-tap a new energy source. Inadvertently slipping sideways into a fascist run parallel Earth, the Doctor meets all the same characters in their Nazi-like alter-egos and witnesses the end of the world. Thankfully he gets back to the real Earth in time to stop the project. This split storyline works incredibly well and it's clear that the regular cast completely relish the opportunity to play what are in effect two completely different characters in one story. It does drag, there's no getting away from that, but the separate story strands do keep the pace going and although the ratings took a big dip while it was on air, the audience appreciation figures were the highest for the entire season.

It's usually the extras that are included with each Doctor Who DVD that make the discs so worthwhile, including the stunning restoration work for the original tapes. Both stories have indeed been restored to their original broadcast quality and are very impressive prints as a result. Alas, I was somewhat disappointed with the other extras that were included. For The Web Planet, there's a commentary track featuring the show's original Producer Verity Lambert along with the story's Director Richard Martin. They are joined by one of the regular cast, William Russell Enoch, and guest actor Martin Jarvis. They all contribute elsewhere, along with the other surviving member of the regular cast, Maureen O'Brien, with a 37 minute documentary on the making of the show. Alas, there is so much duplication in this documentary and the commentary, that it almost makes it redundant. Everything else included in the DVD are either sound or picture files, including a 56 minute audio story featuring the Zarbi and an alternate Spanish soundtrack for episode six. For Inferno, all the extras are bundled onto a second disc and include two 35 minute documentaries, one on the making of the show and one on the early days of the UNIT team that supported the Doctor during his exile on Earth. The commentary for the story is provided in the main by Producer Barry Letts, Script Editor Terrance Dicks and actor Nicholas Courtney who played the regular supporting role of The Brigadier. For two episodes, the commentary is given over to John Levene, who played the role of Sergeant Benton regularly from 1968 to 1975 and makes his biggest appearance in a story to date in Inferno. Letts, Dicks and Courtney always provide an interesting commentary and they work so well together, but I do feel they are being a bit overused. I was particularly disappointed that Caroline John, who played the Doctor's assistant Liz Shaw, was not part of the commentary team as she was the leading lady for this entire season, but only featured in four stories. Not utilizing her seems a missed opportunity to me, particularly as Courtney makes many, many more appearances in the show so there is enormous scope for him to be used on future soundtracks. As this was her fourth and last story, Ms. John should have had a lot to contribute and indeed she is featured in both documentaries. The remaining extras are mainly again pictorial files and it has to be said that they are somewhat lackluster. The focus on this release is clearly the story itself - and that's nothing to complain about.

Inferno is often cited as one of the fan's favorite stories from the Pertwee era and I certainly agree with that line. Producer Letts makes it fairly clear he's not in that particular camp, but he admits at the end of the final episode that it's perhaps not as bad as he thought! The Web Planet team is also very proud of their work and given what they had to work with at the time, this seems fairly justified. Both are welcome additions to the Doctor Who DVD library and make entertaining viewing for sure.",1157587200,4,5875,4.831181727904667
711799,4,6303631916,"Season 7 of Doctor Who was a an important one for the future of the programme. Not only had the new production team got the task of introducing a new actor as the Doctor, but also the task of improving a programme whose ratings had steadily declined throughout Patrick Troughton's tenure as the Doctor.  The addition of colour improved their chances, as did the novelty of having the Doctor exiled to Earth and seconded as UNIT's scientific advisor. As the Pertwee era wore on these narrative restrictions would become a burden, as writers strived with mixed results to squeeze originality out of the format. But in Season 7, it works perfectly. In fact this remains one of the programmes best sequence of episodes. INFERNO was a fitting finale to an extremely pessimistic and dark season in which mankind was as villainous as any alien invader.

 INFERNO has more substance than most Doctor Who stories. Surprisingly this is the first time the narrative device of a parallel Earth has been used in the programme, undoubtedly the reason was to  pad out what was essentially a 4 part story to 7 episodes. But the result is an intelligently handled fascist allegory in which the regulars other than Pertwee get to play their villainous and evil counterparts. Buckled onto this is a tale of an environmental catastrophe of epochal proportions. Natures reaction to meddling in the world of Doctor who is often destructive, this is a somewhat conservative stance for a programme advocating scientific practice and reasoning. But this is one of the many contradictions that make Doctor who such interesting viewing in the modern age. The story also has a wonderful sense of claustrophobia, but this is somewhat undermined by the inclusion of a rather pointless monster in the shape of the Primord. Doctor Who's willingness to take risks and innovate could only go so far and the inclusion of a monster in INFERNO does detract somewhat from a tale in which the curiosity and ego of man is the most damaging and monstrous enemy the planet faces.

 This 2 disc DVD is impressive and of special note is the picture restoration. Although still a little blotchy and fuzzy in places, generally the story looks great. The supplementary documentaries are likewise good value for money, the standard for Doctor Who DVD's continues to increase as the months go by.",1151884800,6,2347,4.899244332493703
711800,5,6303631916,"UNLESS WE ACT NOW THERE'S GOING TO BE THE MOST TERRIBLE DISASTER IMAGINABLE...I'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN!

JUMPING JEHOSOPHAT! Imagine a sci-fi story with twice the potential for world armageddon, and that's what you have in INFERNO, a 7 part Dr. Who serial from Jon Pertwee's run as the interfering Timelord. Usually the story arcs longer than 4 parts, suffer from attempts to stretch out the episodes with padding and material that neither advances the story nor does it serve any real purpose. INFERNO, I'm happy to say is not one of those stories.

The top-secret drilling project called ""Inferno"", is intended to penetrate the Earth's crust and release limitless energy for the world. Hungry for success the ""powers that be "" ignore warnings about the possible dangers of the project, some warnings coming from the Doctor,  currently in his 3rd incarnation and exiled by his people, the Timelords,to Earth of the 20th century. While the Doctor still hopes to escape the confines of one planet, one time, by borrowing some of the power from the ""Inferno"" project. As unpaid scientific adviser to the paramilitary organization UNIT, or the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce, he is frequently in the position to help them save the human race, most often from themselves. Although this is one time he only half-succeeds in averting world destruction. While the project proceeds in its attempt to drill over 20 miles through the Earth's crust, to tap the gas beneath it, a series of events begin leading to the end of the world, maybe two. A technician's contact with an enigmatic subterranean ooze, followed by a motiveless murder and a madman on the loose are mere opening clues for the Doctor,  his brilliant assistant Liz Shaw and the project's head of security and UNIT's CO the Brigadier, to solve the unfolding mystery. But the Doctor's own agenda has him distracted: he is testing the console from the TARDIS (his immobilized time/space ship).

More attacks occur involving the altered technician, through some ""retrogressive mutation"" he and anyone he's touched suffer a transformation into animal-things. More of the ooze is discovered from the drilling outpipe, at first the substance defies analysis, while the project head, Prof. Stahlman conceals that he has touched it. He continues to ignore all warnings to stop drilling, those from both the Doctor and the computer, the later which he sabotages himself. Becoming increasingly obsessive as he regresses further, he orders the Doctor's power supply cut-off at a critical juncture in his experiments with the TARDIS console. This caused the Doctor to travel ""sideways in the time/space continuum"" to a parallel universe. He's on earth right when and where he was but things are a bit askew, UNIT is not longer managing security, replaced by RSF (the Republican Security Forces), the Brigadier is now the eye-patched and mustacheless  Brigade-Leader (scars and facial hair are always major factors in reality shifts), Liz is now Section Leader Shaw. As it happens the project is marginally more advanced than the Doctor's universe, Prof. Stalman is just as dangerously obsessed and infected, but the Doctor never existed, so he is promptly thought a spy, a saboteur, arrested and tossed in a cell with an infected technician. After the Doctor escapes, he tries again to stop the countdown, but it is too late Prof. Stalman is to far gone and others don't believe him until it is too late, as the Doctor puts it, ""Listen to that, it's the sound of this planet screaming out its rage!...Compared to the forces you've unleashed, an Atomic blast would be like a summer breeze!""

What is always Dr. Who at it's most frightening is when the Doctor, the ever-present voice of optimism and internal hope ...when the Doctor gives up. That is when Dr. Who is just plain spooky. The Doctor says: ""Sorry, we're past the point of no return, you've uncorked the genie from the bottle and there's nothing I can do."" The parallel players consign themselves to try to help the Doctor to escape. Seriously, that's it, they begin hoping against hope that they just might be able to send him off alone on the off chance that his Earth might avoid the same catastrophic blunder (except for the Brigadier's counterpart, who hopes to force the Doctor into using the TARDIS as a interdimensional lifeboat).

INFERNO really is one of the best that Jon Pertwee's era has to offer. Thankfully BBC video has taken this opportunity to really clean up the footage (most color originals of Inferno were listed among the BBC fire causualties, the American reruns most of us saw in the 80's were all shaky BLACK & WHITE back-up reels, AND WE WERE THANKFUL FOR IT!).

INFERNO'S length allow for a greater development of character and relationships that serve the dual roles of the major and minor players, while confirming their natures by contrasting them (like the hot/cold between the crass but brave, in any universe, Drilling Consultant SUTTON and the all-business Assistant Director Dr. PETRA WILLIAMS.

Like the Doctor says, ""Fascinating, so many similarities, yet so many differences.""

The Liz Shaw and the Brigadier of ""Universe B"" are really just versions of themselves behaving as they would in a world dominated by fascism, but no one is ""evil"" in this story. Even Project Director Prof. Stahlman, the man whom which this disaster(s) would not be possible without, is merely obsessive and arrogant, then out of his mind, but even the monsters aren't evil, just kind of ""hot & bothered.""

Robert A. Heinlein author of ""STRANGER in a STRANGE LAND"" and the universe-shifting novel ""JOB: A COMEDY OF JUSTICE"" cites H.G. WELLS as having invented all of the basic fantasy themes, including the parallel universe, specifically: MEN LIKE GODS. Of course, the Sci-Fi channels loaded with them, including spoofs in Futurama, and just this year (probably the BBC's real motivation behind this release) the brilliant second season of the new Dr. Who features the 2 parter ""AGE of STEEL/RISE of the CYBERMEN"" in which the Cybermen are reborn (or rebuilt) on an alternate Earth. My point is INFERNO is a good story in good company, but not without it's clich&eacute;s & faults.

The monsters in this one are alittle on the poor side of Lon Chaney and the Doctor, literially defeats the same ones over and over again, but I recommend adding this DVD to your Dr. Who collection.

One of my favorite experiences linked w/ DW is gathering w/ friends to watch, debate & other nefarious purposes.... So here is some INFERNO clich&eacute;s for drinking games. Drink when:

--Someone is accused of traitorous talk/ behavior or sabotage

--The Doctor drives ""Bessie"" seemingly w/out purpose

--You see possible stock footage (of molten materials)

--The universe changes P.O.V. to an alternate one

--The Doctor calls authoritarian figures rude names

--You experience any feeling of D&eacute;j&agrave; vu (in any universe)",1150588800,11,6940,5.0287456445993035
711801,5,6303631916,"It's been a while since I saw this, but I thought it would be blasphemous if I didn't have a review on this amazing story!!!

It's such a chilling story about an insane (not mad!) scientest at a lab drilling the earths crust to supply more energy resources for the country. And something starts going horribly wrong when the green slime reaches the surface in one of the rooms of the lab headquarters when one of the easy-going technicians touches (yuck!) the green slime -- and turn into a extremely vicious and wild creature -- very similar in appearnace to the Incredible Hulk -- except in this story this heaps of them!

While, in a shed at the complex, the doctor experiments with his tardis consul, and in he experiments and then instructs Liz to put the power on, gets zapped and has quite a mind-splitting experience until Liz turns the power off! To cut it short, he ends up in the parrallel universe where they encounter similar problems with men also turning into ""hulk men"" and bad tempered pompous, stuburn (to say the least) scientest like Stahlman -- I am happy I still remember his name. :) But it's all quite scary as Britain is a republic and is controlled in a nazi-style resume much similar to the 3rd Reich! I can't tell you much more because it would spoil this quite superb story that is so original, inspiring, scary to watch! I was at the end of my seat with this story, with a great cast of actors. The Brigadier did a marvellous job as pseudo-Hitler, Olaf Pooley (Stahlman) is so hated in this real -- you really want to punch him in the face, but is very realistic quite reminiscent of real life with how demanding bosses are in the workplace getting you to do impossible things -- even if what you are doing is destroying the earth! Caroline John (Liz Shaw) was great -- she should have won the award for her 2 part role. Very likely actor as she has to put with everybody and won't listen to her because of her association with the so-called insane ""Doctor."" She really does look quite an intelligent woman and this is her best story. This would more than likely be the best Doctor Who story I've seen!

I would recommend this story to anyone who loves the show. Even to Tom Baker-only people as well and beg and plead to them to watch this insanely brillant 7-part epic! If you could tell those people to watch one story that's not Tom's -- this is the way to go. But in reality, Tom Baker was somewhat similar to Jon. The only major difference was Tom was brought the jokey, humorous role to the show.

711802,5,6303631916,"This story answers that question with the Doctor's journey into the parallel world, only to find his friends' doppelgangers turn against him and try to kill him.  Inferno is one of the Top 3 Doctor Who stories of all time, definitely the best of the Pertwee era. The doom-laden atmosphere of the parallel world is very depressing.  The last minute of episode 6 may be the best last minute of any Doctor Who episode, with its red tint to suggest a dying, burning world and people running around in a daze.  Then the closing shot of the red-hot lava creeping into the barrack.

Incidentally, I agree with a previous reviewer about the quality of the tapes.  Inferno is a double-cassette release.  Tape 1 has virtually no problems, but tape 2 suffers horribly in spots.  I have two copies of Inferno, and the quality deteriorates at exactly the same spots on both tape 2s.  Therefore, the problem is with the master tape used in the studio, not with each individual tape.",1123372800,,968,4.652941176470589
711893,5,6303631916,"I am in complete agreement with your reviewers who see this adventure as being one of the best of the Pertwee years.
One of the things for me which makes this interesting is not just the parallel world notion, which surprisingly has not been used too much, but the limits to that notion.
For instance the Doctor finds himself in an alternate universe which is slightly different from the one he begins from. Not only is it different but he, qua the Doctor is not in it, nor has he been. Also the concept that one parallel universe can be destroyed without destroying the others is a novel idea too.
This adventure has almost everything you could want to find in a show geared towards adults and young adults alike. The typical villain and mad scientist are found together in one mean man along with a devoted follower who is intelligent but too uncertain to question his authority. There are the Primords, who are the unfortunate by-products of the scientific process and then there are the populates of the alternative earth...
These neo-fascists clearly intended to resemble to gestapo/SS of the Third Reich and accurately portray an authoritarian regime. There is another aspect to this too which was controversial in England upon the show's broadcast and that was the appearance in uniform of Caroline Shaw. Adult viewing increased considerably.
The adventure is rather long, unecessarily so, and could have done with a better editing. Even so there is a good story here with much to consider for some time. The action scenes and outdoor shots as well as make up and costume have much to commend them. A very good concept which is pretty well executed. No pun intended.
The loss of the character Liz from the series was a hard blow. The Doctor clearly needed a companion who had at least half a brain but instead the third Doctor was portrayed as a well meaning but chauvinistic person rather than the enlightened man of reason he had set out being.
Hopefully this will make it ot DVD sooner rather than later.",1034121600,,2014,4.724431818181818
711894,5,6303631916,"The one and only sideways time story of Dr. Who.  Inferno is probably the best DW story period.  A very strong story about the alternate Universe and is detailed in the background of characters in that Universe.  Liz kinda wanted to be a scientist but decided not to, sort of thing.  The show stopper for me was the Brigade Leader.  A kind of coward/bully/tyrant of lawful order on an obsessive-compulsive level.  Very scary.  Greg Sutton(Derek Newark) was in an Unearthly child the first DW story.  Greg Sutton was also a very strong character in Inferno.  What would've been really interesting(though not nessecary) would be an alternate Doctor Who, probably a pathetic anxious fearfull man; the compete opposite of Dr. Who, Jon Pertwee's character.  But that wasn't really nessecary for this story. It would've been interesting though.",1025049600,,838,5.095588235294118
711895,5,6303631916,"The last story of the Doctor's seventh season is the 7-part Inferno, one the best in the show's history.  At a research facility, the Doctor is observing the efforts of the arrogant and unpleasant Professor Stahlman as he attempts to penetrate the Earth's crust in order to gain alternative energy source known as Stahlman's gas.  The problem is, his efforts might lead to the destruction of the Earth, but it's all about him and forget the others, including Sir Keith Gold, the administrator in charge.  Then there's a greenish ooze that when touched, causes people to turn green and into murderous ape-like Primords, and radiate such intense heat that whatever they touch feels as if it came from a furnace.  That is what the Brigadier and UNIT are here for.  All this time, penetration zero is hours away from happening, and to make matters worse, Stahlman is infected with the ooze and also sabotages the computer so he cannot be opposed by the Doctor, UNIT, or Sir Keith.
During an experiment, the Doctor is propelled into a parallel Earth where Britain is ruled by a bureaucratic and fascist dictatorship:  ""Proper bureaucrat, aren't you?  Can't shoot me unless you fill in all the forms?""  He is horrified to see his friends Liz, Benton, and the Brigadier in Nazi-type uniforms, and far from the pleasant people he knew on his Earth.  The most striking effect is the Brigadier, here the Brigade Leader, sans mustache, with a black patch over his left eye, a scar running down his left cheek.  The Stahlman of that world succeeds in penetrating the Earth's crust, which eventually causes the planet's destruction.  It is up to the Doctor to return to his Earth to avert such a disaster from happening.  As he tells the parallel Earthlings, ""compared to the forces that you've unleashed, an atomic blast would be like a summer breeze.""
Episode 5 is the most sobering one.  The facility starts blowing up, green stuff oozes from the output pipe like a sore, and the fully metamorphosed Primords appear.  They are frightening at times, goofy-looking the next, but when they touch someone, that someone becomes one of them, like the parallel Benton
The chaos near the end of Episode 6 are also sobering.  The atmosphere is tinted red, people are fleeing in terror or are dazed.  And the rivers of molten lava starts flowing.  Inferno indeed!
Some of the cliffhangers are effective here.  The one for Episode 4 has Stahlman pointing a gun at the Doctor while the countdown voice goes ""5, 4, 3, 2, 1..."" and then, end credits.  The music is eerie and weirdly space-like, and that gives the story its ominous and gripping edge.
All the regulars are terrific here, but Nicholas Courtney gets extra applause for playing the level-headed Brigadier and the vicious and cowardly Brigade Leader.  Derek Newark as the authority-flouting Aussie consultant Sutton is particularly splendid, and Olaf Pooley pulls an extra-effective effort at making Professor Stahlman so petty, crazed, and dangerous.  Incidentally, Sheila Dunn, who plays Petra Williams, is the wife of Douglas Camfield, who directed this masterpiece.
7-part episodes were abandoned because of their overlength, but it works for Inferno, mainly because of the story.  Inferno warns of the dangerously obsessive egomaniacs like Stahlman and also of the terror of nuclear power, of abusing Mother Earth itself.  But the story brings hope.  When the Doctor learns that Sir Keith survived an auto crash instead of being killed like he was in the fascist Earth, he realizes, ""so not everything runs parallel.  An infinity of universes, ergo an infinite number of choices.  So, free will is not an illusion after all.  The pattern can be changed.""  I'm hoping that's what Nostradamus' prophecies of World War III are-a prediction for a parallel Earth that foolishly and tragically destroyed itself.  Well, I hope it's not the fate of this Earth.  With our free will, we can prevent that from happening.",1003536000,22,3952,4.962006079027356
711896,5,6303631916,"INFERNO is probably Jon Pertwee's best adventure in his run in DOCTOR WHO. One of the finest storylines ever, INFERNO focuses on The Doctor's attempts on stopping the penetration of the Earth's crust by Prof. Stahlman in his attempts to discover a new, inexpensive enrgy source. In his quest, The Doctor inadvertently travels sideways in his makeshift TARDIS & arrives in a parallel dimension of Earth where everything & everyone who he has contacted in the REAL Earth is different. WAY DIFFERENT! In that parallel Earth, The Doctor witnesses in horror the destruction of Earth from the penetration of the Earth's crust. His only hope is to travel back to the REAL Earth to try tosave that world. But will The Doctor arrive in time?
Jon Pertwee's performance as The Doctor is superb. The supporting cast, particularly Nicholas Courtney in his dual role as Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart & his evil counterpart was excellent. The actor who played Greg Sutton gave a scene-stealing performance as the tough-as-nails drill engineer was noteworthy. When I saw this episode originally in the early 70s, I had hoped that they would keep the character of Greg Sutton as a regular. Sadly, this was to be the last appearance of the character of Liz Shaw in the series as she left the show after this episode.

711898,4,6303631916,"Jon Pertwee's first season as the Doctor harked back to older days.  After a brief four parter (Spearhead from Space), there were three seven part stories.  Inferno concluded the season, and is one of the, if not the, best Pertwee stories.
In this season the Doctor was earth-bound, exiled by the Time Lords.  Working as a special adviser for the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce (UNIT) Pertwee's Doctor was presented with a wonderful cast of support characters - from Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, very much a military man, to loyal Sergeant Benton.  His principal companion of the season was Dr Liz Shaw, a scientist - intended to portray a wiser, more emancipated companion.  Despite, Caroline Shaw's subtle portrayal scriptwriters had little idea what to do with the character, and Liz Shaw, appearing in only four stories, is very much a footnote in Doctor Who history.
This is Liz Shaw's final story, and while - unlike other companions - she is not given a farewell, the story gives Caroline John more to do than other stories in the season, and lets fans wonder how the character could be developed.
The plot is set in a refinery around a project to drill to the core of the earth, and release untold energy.  However, some disappearances and murders are taking place in the drilling works around the refinery - and UNIT's involvement coincides with the appearance of mutants (primords).  Despite the Doctor's concerns the work progresses, the earth-bound Doctor making use of some of the energy from the project for experiments with his TARDIS (time and space travelling machine).
The Doctor is flung into a parallel Earth where work on the project is also progressing.  However, despite the appearance of some familiar faces, this is a fascist regime.
The Doctor is left watching two worlds race towards disaster.  Can he save either, or both?
Inferno is scripted by Don Houghton, later to write the engaging Mind of Evil.  Houghton's scipt is probably one episode too long (there are several unnecessary sequences).  It also relies on several cliches of the genre, e.g. the mad scientist, the practical man pointing out the inadequacies of the project.  But, Pertwee's cynical Doctor (more downbeat here than in some of his more hystrionic eye-rolling performances) counterbalances some of the worst excesses.
The story is well-directed, and despite some longeurs, is generally fast paced.  It is good low budget television, where the script makes up for a paucity of special effects.
Acting is generally of a good quality - although there is some overacting from those condemned to life as ""primords"".
The central cast members, Nicholas Courtney (the Brigadier); Caroline John (Liz); and John Levene (Benton) are given more to do than normal - and their performances in the parallel Earth scenes justify acquisition of the story for Doctor Who fans.
Doctor Who obsessives will note two footnotes to the story.  Firstly, the opening credits to each episode are unusual in that they run over scenes of fire and furnace.  Secondly, this is the last appearance for the original TARDIS console, first created for the story ""100,000BC"" (aka An Unearthly Child) in 1963.
This is a good introduction to Doctor Who for non-fans, but the impact of the story is all the greater if the viewer has some familiarity with previous UNIT stories from the first Pertwee season (at least Spearhead from Space, and arguably The Silurians).
If you enjoy this you might want to try Mind of Evil, or The Daemons.",973209600,5,3506,5.020689655172414

7853401,5,6303631916,"One of my favorites from the Pertwee & I liked most of his adventures. This time the Doctor moves sideways in time. To a dark alternate where the UK is the Republic of Briton. The Royal family were ""executed all of them!"" Brigade-Leader Lethbridge-Stewart to the Doctor ""John Smith"". Because of the ""Defense of the Republic Act of 1943"" the RSF was formed. Republican Security Force, there is no UNIT. We are told nothing about the rest of the world. We can guess however. In both universes and probably more, the Mohole Project to ""penetrate the Earth's crust"" is happening. The Dr. has been exiled on Earth by the Time Lords. He has taken out the command console (original used since 1963) from his TARDIS. Drawing power from the nuclear reactor used for the drill, he accidentally sends himself, his yellow roadster ""Bessie"" and the console to the same shed. Or is it?

Things are neatly stacked and items missing, books etc. When he opens the door he finds it painted black with an odd symbol on it. In a white disc are three black arrows--one up and two on each side moving outward like some military maneuver...

The picture is very clear, a well written story, though it is 7 episodes, a left over from the previous regime and they had to fill it so they made the story into a parallel world one. In this case the negative, dark version like Star Trek's ""Mirror Mirror"" only here people are minus facial hair. And this is actor Nicholas Cortney's favorite since he gets to play a bad guy version of his own Brigadier of UNIT character. The Brigade-Leader is clean shaven, has a dueling scar running down his face and a black eye-patch. And in 1970's British fascist uniform. For the US it is Spock with a beard, in the UK it is clean shaven with a scar and eye patch! The print in color looks wonderful no obvious flaws in it.

His urging is justified when the TARDIS control panel throws the Doctor into a parallel dimension where Inferno is nearing completion and things are not turning out well at all.

The story is interesting and doesn't seem dragged out even though it lasts seven episodes (166 minutes). The alternate dimension has a fascist England with the UNIT people acting as government enforcers rather than benevolent peacekeepers. The twist is fun and I'm sure the actors enjoyed a chance to do something different with their characters. Pertwee is his usual gruff self--a bit overbearing and a bit too serious.

There's just something special about this story, whether it's the tightly-knit plot, or the alternate universe concept, Inferno is near perfection. But this review isn't going to be all about the story, as there are a million other reviewers who do just that.

Can You Hear the Earth Scream? (35 mins) - A nice making of documentary featuring what's left of the cast and crew. They fill you in on some pretty interesting things, such as the alternate universe plot being added in fairly late into the script, and Douglas Camfield falling ill, Barry Letts taking his place as director for what was left of the shoot.

Hadoke versus HAVOC (27 mins) - This feature, obviously hosted by Toby Hadoke, brings back the remaining members of the HAVOC stunt team, who were formed to help perform some more complicated stunts that were to be attempted with the new decade. While the first half does leave you thinking, ""when will we get to the stunts?"" But when it does, its glorious! Hadoke proves his fatigue other any sort of exercise when an 80 year old man does a stunt just to prove to Hadoke that it's possible. And when Hadoke does it, you'll be rolling on the floor with laughter.

Doctor Forever! Lost in the Dark Dimension (27 mins) - The fourth installment of the Doctor Forever series is good enough. While it does feel a bit dumbed-down compared to its predecessors, it's still a nice look at the overall feel of that it was like to be a Doctor Who fan from 1990-2004. The most interesting part about this feature is that there was actually a new Doctor cast, and several episodes filmed... (and it's not Paul McGann)

The UNIT Family - Part One (35 mins) - The cast and crew who worked for the UNIT team come together to discuss the first 6 stories that a form of UNIT appeared in, from the Web of Fear to Inferno. While it's nice, I do wish that they could of made it a bit more, well, interesting, because I didn't really care all that much for this one.

Other Smaller Features - Visual Effects Promo Film (6 mins): Yeah, it's alright, I suppose. Deleted Scene (2 mins): Basically just Pertwee doing a very bad impression of a newscaster and the Doctor, Brigade Leader and Section Leader Shaw listening to it. Nothing to see here, folks. The Pertwee Years Intro (3 mins): I actually really like this one. Pertwee still had the charisma he had back in the 70's, and, well, I don't know, it's just quite a nice feature! Photo Gallery (6 mins): Again, it's an alright photo gallery, a feature I'm not generally too keen on. I haven't acsessed the PDF materials, or done the production subtitles, so I won't give you my thoughts on those.

Commentary - This a an amazing commentary. We've got Nick Courtney, John Levene, Barry Letts, and Terrance Dicks, who have some very fascinating conversations about the impact of the story, tiny little background details on how the scenes were filmed, and just generally how fantastic the story is!

My local PBS station reran Tom Baker and Peter Davison repeatedly when I was child before they went back to the third Doctor. The alternate/Evil versions of UNIT standout as well as the opening credits with the volcano footage. Having seen this only once on TV, it's unlikely that I would have remembered the title of this if not for the lava footage mixed with the credits. I have all of the third Doctor  DVD's now(although none of them are Special Edition reissue) and I recommend this one, ""Terror of the Autons""(first appearance of the Master) and ""The Three Doctors"". I borrowed a copy of the Special Edition to watch the new bonus features and here is my impression; I prefer the art on the original DVD case.(I always thought that the man/Primord on the cover looks like Nicholas Cage!) I do not notice any difference in picture/sound quality. There are 2 new featurettes, one reuniting the members of HAVOC and one called ""Doctor Forever!"" which chronicles bringing the Doctor back to TV after the original series was cancelled. These new featurettes are good, but they would not be enough to make me double-dip.
  I love the Sarah Jane Smith and she is credited as being the first capable, Feminist companion. I also love the Liz Shaw companion. It seems to me that she was more capable(scientific background and the Doctors equal intellectually) than Sarah Jane and that was why she was fired. I guess the BBC wasn't ready for Pretty and Smart.
