3543326,5,B001DXC3EE,"Although I wasn't born yet, I just adore Mister Peepers. I love any classic TV from the 50s, but this is one of my favorites. It was such a harmless family show anyone would enjoy watching it today. In this box we see Mister Peepers getting the nerve to date Miss Remington, (the wedding comes in the following season), and get to go out with Mr Weskitt and his wife. Sis Peepers make an appearance and is as bookish as he is! I love it when she is complaining that she has so much work to do ""with nebulae"" (she's a scientist too) and Ma Peepers looks so confused, then tells Sis if she needs any help to let her know. This is my mother on law to a T. For anyone looking for wholesome family programs don't pass this up. They aren't necessarily knee-slap funny, but still funny and a great slice of the 50s. I can't wait for Set 3, which is supposed to be released but I don't know when.",1256342400,8,888,4.138728323699422
3543327,5,B001DXC3EE,"Following up on its 2005 release of the first 26 episodes of the early 1950s live situation comedy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mister-Peepers-The-TV-Series/dp/B000JJSL6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mister Peepers - The TV Series</a>, S'more Entertainment delivers its second volume of the next 26 episodes, taking us to about the halfway point of surviving episodes in the series.  This second group of episodes chronologically begins where the first set leaves off, from the Spring of 1953 to November 1953.  Like the previous group of episodes, the show focuses on the humorous adventures of junior high school science teacher Robinson Peepers (Wally Cox) and his closest friends Harvey Weskit (Tony Randall), Nancy Remington (Patricia Benoit) and Mrs. Gurney (Marion Lorne).  One of the highlights is the marriage of Harvey Weskit to his beloved Marge Bellows (Georgiann Johnson).  While most of the cast members of ""Mister Peepers"" are deceased, it is interesting to note that Johnson had active television credits as late as 2007 (an episode of the crime series ""Cold Case"").  The supporting roles include many long forgotten actors, but there are a few recognizable guest stars like Martin Balsam, Reta Shaw, and Jack Warden, who is introduced as a new coach at Jefferson Junior High in the final episode in this set.

For me, the keys to ""Mister Peepers'"" success boil down to three elements.  First, unlike the ""in your face"" crass nonsense that's passed off as ""writing"" in many modern sitcoms, ""Mister Peepers"" employs a much more subtle approach that forces the viewer to actively listen to the dialog.  Second, while Wally Cox is engaging in the lead role, the producers have wisely surrounded him with a terrific ensemble cast.  Whether it be a seasoned pro like Marion Lorne or a young up-and-comer like Tony Randall, the casting is perfect.  Finally, one might take the technical direction for granted given decades of television watching, but there are a surprising number of multiple camera setups used in ""Mister Peepers"" that were fairly complicated for their time, especially in front of live audiences.  While there's the occasional slip-up, most of the time the production works wonderfully.

Classic/vintage television fans eagerly awaited the first volume of ""Mister Peepers"" on DVD and the challenge for S'more Entertainment was to deliver a second volume that was at least as good as the first volume.  S'more has risen to the challenge admirably.  First, viewers familiar with the first set will notice improved visual quality with this set.  Though sourced from 16-millimeter kinescopes of live broadcasts, these episodes look and sound very good for the most part, and those familiar with the episodes from the previous volume will notice the absence of the UCLA Film & Television Archive logo this time around (UCLA is the custodian of the ""Mister Peepers"" kinescopes donated by series creator David Swift).  Second, the extras in this set are better than those found in the first volume and include an archive interview with Tony Randall (that gets a little salty), a short promotional film demonstrating the kinescope recording process, as well as a 1952 Peabody Awards show that includes Wally Cox, in his ""Robinson Peepers"" character, accepting an award for the show.  The extras are rounded out with a full episode from the live series ""Suspense"" featuring Wally Cox in a supporting role that was broadcast before he went on to greater fame in ""Mister Peepers.""  Sharp-eyed viewers will notice Rex Marshall as the announcer for the Autolite ads in ""Suspense.""  Marshall was also the announcer for ""Mister Peepers"" and his commercials for the Reynolds Aluminum Company (along with those of Helen Wagner and Helen Lewis) that were missing from the first volume are here in their entirety.

One hopes that sales of this second volume of ""Mister Peepers"" are strong enough to warrant further releases of the series.  This is a very easy recommendation to fans of classic/vintage sitcoms and, with ""Mister Peepers,"" we are treated to one of the best.",1231459200,15,4126,5.287901990811639
3543328,5,B001DXC3EE,"The long wait after the release of Season 1 was agonizing and punctuated with prayer for the release of Season 2, but it was worth it when I received the Season 2 boxed set.  This set is even superior to Season 1, both in cinematic quality and in plot development and humor.  I have watched all but the final two episodes on the set, and I am utterly delighted.  Everything that made the first set wonderful is still here--the adorable Mrs. Gurney (Marion Lorne), Wally Cox's hilariously understated comedic talent as Robinson J. Peepers, Nancy Remington's growing affection for Robinson Peepers, and Tony Randall's over-the-top portrayal of Harvey Weskit.  This season adds new settings and characters, a raft of new predicaments, and perfected interaction of the cast members with each other, as they become a finely tuned team.  The bonus material is good too, particularly the interview with the late Tony Randall.  Every episode includes the original commercials for Reynolds aluminum, too--an extra treat.

My only disappointment with this set was that I thought Peepers' and Nancy's wedding would be on it, but this was not the case.  Where I am in viewing the set right now, they are not even engaged yet.  This means that Season 3 is a must-have, as their wedding was the very first nationally televised wedding on a regular TV program, and it stopped the entire nation in its tracks.  I can't wait to see it!  I have not heard any plans for releasing Season 3, but if there is a strong positive response from us the viewers, I am sure there will be a Season 3 release.  This would be a good time to give Seasons 1 and 2 as Christmas gifts to the Peepersphiles and the uninitiated and send a letter to the inimitable Arny Schorr, who is responsible for bringing us te first two boxed sets.

These episodes are so nostalgic if you were around in the fifties, and if not, they'll acquaint you with the better-natured humor of the day and all the little cultural motifs that were prevalent then--haircuts at the barber shop, men bidding on ladies' boxed lunches, sweet and gentle courtship where the couple actually gets to know each other, and the kinds of characters that you can fall in love with and never forget.  The fifties were an entirely different world, and a far better one in many respects.  You can experience them with the Mr. Peepers episodes and enjoy many a laugh that will stay with you each time you remember your favorite scenes.  I highly recommend this series!

3543329,5,B001DXC3EE,"After waiting three long years for more MISTER PEEPERS, our wishes are granted!  This set is superior to the first set, not only in quality reproduction of the original kinescopes held in UCLA's archive, but in the entertainment value of each script.  If you're a fan of THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW, then you'll love this collection of 26 episodes written by Jim Fritzell and Everett Greenbaum, whose expertise made GRIFFITH a 1960s hit.  While gentler and simpler than the Griffith show, MISTER PEEPERS blossomed under the care of this great writing team.  The accent is on character development, not slapstick, as with most early TV sitcoms.

The acting is topnotch, and each segment is filled with priceless interactions between the characters.  Wally Cox is sublime as Robinson Peepers, meek and mild science teacher.  Tony Randall is convincingly blustery as know-it-all Harvey Weskit, the history teacher.  Pat Benoit is the most natural of anyone in the cast, very calm, quiet, sincere.  Her performances are truly ones to watch.  And the inimitable Marion Lorne, forever emblazoned on our memories as Aunt Clara in BEWITCHED, shines brighter here as Mrs. Bernice Gurney, the befuddled English teacher.  If you are a BEWITCHED fan, you must buy this set.  Lorne is at her best; she's far funnier as Gurney than Clara.  You won't be disappointed in her every stammer and falter.  And Lorne had to work hard to perfect this.  Some critics say she was forgetful of her lines and thus created the stuttering effect...not so!  Lorne learned her part and then injected the delays, second-takes, and giggles.  What a pro!  An Emmy-worthy actress long before BEWITCHED!

And the semi-regulars shine just as brightly.  Two episodes in this batch include the divine Reta Shaw as Peepers's beloved Aunt Lil.  In the October 18 episode, Shaw is given some of the best material of her career.  She's neither bombastic or domineering as her later film parts dictated.  She's quite earthy--just a pleasure to watch her every little nuance of movement and intonation.  In this episode, she delivers a rousing piano rendition of the 1929 hit ""Button Up Your Overcoat,"" accompanied by Lorne who tries her best to get the lyrics right!  It is priceless !!  Throw in pros like Ruth McDevitt (another charmer as Cox's nerdy mom), Jenny Egan as Peepers's spinster sister-astronomer (remember her as Agnes Moorehead's daughter in Disney's Pollyanna?), Gage Clarke (remember the mortician in POLLYANNA?), Jack Warden (as a tough-talking coach), charming husband/wife team Ernest Truex and Sylvia Field as Benoit's parents, and the gorgeous Georgiann Johnson as Randall's girlfriend, and you've got the best ingredients for delightful viewings.

The package description is slightly misleading, however.  This is not the full second season.  PEEPERS began as a summer replacement series in 1952.  When it became so popular, it returned to the airwaves in late October of that same year to replace a floundering new sitcom named DOC CORKLE.  The first DVD set contained the 1952 summer episodes as well as those from October 1952 to March 1953.  This set picks up where the first left off, but it contains episodes from the remainder of the first full season and part of the second full season, from March 1953 to November 1953.  Let's hope a deal can be worked to get ALL Mister Peepers eps on DVD, because I've viewed some of the later ones at the UCLA FILM AND TELEVISION ARCHIVE---and there are some great ones yet to be released!

Thanks to Arny Shorr at S'MORE ENTERTAINMENT for his diligence in getting these released finally...and thanks to UCLA for permitting thousands of PEEPERS fans to finally see these classic episodes!",1227916800,34,3708,5.0444078947368425
3543330,5,B001DXC3EE,"Can not believe that season 2 finally arrived, it is one of the best early 50's TV shows I have seen, I am already looking forward for season 3. Wally Cox is excellent in this role as a High School science teacher, a role made for him only. I encourage anyone who loves the simplicity of the early 50's and their brand of humor to immediately purchase this DVD, almost 800 minutes of total fun. The supporting cast was  also very good, especially Tony Randall and Marion Lorne. Buy now and have fun. If any of you love going back to the 50s and relieve our childhood and youth, this is the perfect DVD for you, the simple and fun times and the fun and not so fun days at High School. The stories are short and simple but very fun and it depicts the teachers back then very well. This is a must for everyone, buy it and have hours of fun with it on a rainy day, or any day.
