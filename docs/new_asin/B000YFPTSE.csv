3028601,4,B000YFPTSE,"The first disc of this three DVD collection is fine for what it is, but a 'straight' documentary of the band, leaves out so much of what The Who was about, and why the fans get so bonkers over all this. I didn't learn anything new about Pete, Roger, John and Keith from this, so for the new folks that are sticking their toes into Who waters, this is fine as it is well produced and informative. A lot more DVD's are needed to tell this story in a proper fashion.

The second disc of this set is my favorite of the bunch. ""Six Quick Ones"" is amazing all the way. The four band member segments are more in the spirit of what The Who were really about. Keith's segment has what we want to see...the crazy master getting down to business with the world's largest drumkit. To see on film just what he is doing on stage and up-close, is Rock at it's very finest. Every listener of music, needs to witness this footage, the energy and power of The Who {as well as the humor} is right here for all to see!

The art segment; ""Who Art You?"" is well produced and shows the band as pop art and a visual movement, as well as a audio force, this is both informative and fun to view. The Scrapbook: appears to be segments filmed for the documentary that were omitted to bring down the running time of the original film. I suggest that a deluxe edition of this set be produced on the lines of The Beatles: ""Anthology"" series to expand the segments with more of what is found here in the scrapbook, as this is fine entertaining stuff.

The High Numbers at the Railway Hotel is a peek into the world of:""The Faces"" and: ""The Godfathers"" and this is the true meaning of: ""Teenage Wasteland"" as the audience and band themselves are all equal parts of the show here. It is too bad that more footage of this movie-to-be wasn't discovered. The ""Who's Back"" film was shot at Pete's studio on the river Thames in 2003 with Greg Lake, Zak and Rabbit, working on: ""Real Good Looking Boy"" and it shows that the magic of The Who is indeed alive & well. Pete's bits are great, and Rabbit has his moment as a key player here to really bring up the spirit of the song with his amazing piano work. Magic, is alive and well in Whoville, and this short film is the proof of that.

Disc Three could have been the best disc of the set...
But, the problem is that the best part of the Chicago show is NOT included here, as the fantastic and crazed encore is missing before the ""How Can You Do It Alone"" segment is seen here. This December 1979 show from Chicago is the stuff of legends and I feel cheated to not get to enjoy the encore in it's full form. Look, I understand that some of this show was considered sloppy and lost it's flow in spots. But to bait us with Chicago 79, and NOT present the entire show is a crime! The energy here is way above what 80's Who, will always get a bad rap about. The spirit and drive is here in spades, and they cut the guts right out of it, WHY?

Yes, this is a good package...but the ultimate DVD collection of The Who, still at this point can be found on the ""Deluxe"" version of: ""The Kids Are Alright"" where the chaos and energy drives the bus in the proper fashion. This is fine for what it is, but the ultimate Who story still has not been put together yet. The Who is all about heart and noise, use those two elements and the ultimate tale will unfold and astound your eyes and ears!

3028603,5,B000YFPTSE,"I can't add anything to what has been written about the 2 DVD set of Amazing Journey: the Story of The Who, but I think it's cool to have concert footage of Kenney Jones' first American tour with the Who in 1979. The concert is from Chicago, only a week after the tragedy in Cincinnati. Roger's voice and energy are ace, but Pete kind of looks and plays like he's been drinking all week long - the grief must've been overwhelming them all. But still the band rocks hard and Kenny, Rabbit, and the horn section are around to help push along the ""new"" Who. Recommended.",1202342400,8,567,4.3584905660377355

8232561,4,B000YFPTSE,"This review is for THE STORY OF THE WHO 3-DVD EDITION.THE THIRD DISC INCLUDES OVER 90 MINUTES OF THE WHO LIVE IN CHICAGO PERFORMANCE IN 1979. The Who expanded their setlist during the Kenny Jones years, mainly 1979-1981, and played an encore for this 1979 Chicago concert that included some R&B covers such as ""Dancing In The Street"" by Martha and the Vandellas. For whatever reason, they omitted most of the encore and also the extended ""My Generation"".  If you get a chance, check out Pete Townshend and Kenny Jones on ""My Generation"" from their Concert For Kampuchea from the same year.",1442880000,,589,4.7745098039215685

8232563,5,B000YFPTSE,"I've owned this in the past.  Had to buy a new copy.

GREAT documentary, covering in depth the birth of the band, the relationships, through the breakups, the deaths, and reunions.  Interviews with Roger & Pete, posthumous clips from John & Keith, as well as input from Eddie Vedder, Sting, and other members of The Who group - managers, etc.

If you're a Who fan this is A MUST HAVE.

Comes with bonus dvds of a concert, clips profiling each band member, and the making of the song ""Real Good Looking Boy"".",1434240000,,507,4.467391304347826
8232564,4,B000YFPTSE,"Though I still think that The Kids Are Alright or 30 Years Of Maximum R&B are more important releases, this is also a nice one to own.  Especially if you get the version with the bonus 1979 concert on disc #3.",1368921600,,209,4.097560975609756
8232565,5,B000YFPTSE,"The product came as described, in great condition, and at a great price.  I saw this on Netflix, and had to have it.  It also comes with 2 bonus discs: Quick takes, and the Who live in Chicago.  (I JUST missed that concert...when I was in Chicago...)  This is a great band, with a long, brilliant, and sad history.  I will enjoy watching this over & over again.  I want Keith Moon back, to reach his full potential! :'(  Such a sad thing, because he truly was one of rock's greatest drummers, and he knew it too. Listen to almost any Who track, and you can hear how brilliant he is, and you don't have to be a musician to recognize it.",1350864000,,635,4.155737704918033
8232566,5,B000YFPTSE,"If you love The Who, this is the one to get.  1st DVD tells the best story of The Who.  My favorite group of all time.",1335657600,,118,3.5
8232567,5,B000YFPTSE,"I first saw this documentary on VH1 in 2007. Due to the conflicting interests of my friends I only saw bits of it. Even so, I was mesmerized by the rare footage previously only seen by The Who inner circle. So recently I decided to go all out and buy the ""3-DVD Exclusive Edition."" I was not disappointed. The main feature is a wonderfully produced documentary. It features interviews with all the people you would want to hear from (family members, managers, musical peers). Surprisingly, Noel Gallagher (Oasis) had me cracking up with his hilarious (and possibly drunken) comments. The documentary goes in chronological order which is a nice way of introducing people to the band. My favorite part is all the rare footage packed in. Every time I watch this I savor all the great performances. The only frustrating thing is that they only last about 25 seconds tops. Also, the footage is in excellent quality which tells you the powers that be could release those in their entirety.

Roger and Pete offer some new insights not heard in films like ""The Kids Are Alright."" These two documentaries complement each other well I think. ""Kids"" is performance driven, while ""Amazing Journey"" is story driven. Even things such as subtitles and video effects are handled artfully and tastefully. This film was not slopped together. Contrast this with the interesting but dated ""30 Years of Maximum R&B Live.""

The second disc is also wonderful. Among other things it features spotlights on the individual talents of The Who members. I feel this was really needed since Pete and Roger sometimes get overlooked as musicians. I wish they had gotten more in-depth with Keith's feature. His technique was so eclectic and genius. Interviews with his contemporaries would've been great (Ringo, Neil Peart). As a former bassist, I ate up John's feature. But again, would've loved more in-depth stuff. Also featured is the earliest footage of the band playing soul numbers. Fascinating but also hilarious.

Disc three of this edition has The Chicago 1979 concert. Apparently, the songs not included were not of the same good quality. However, I think they should have featured them anyway (a la Coliseum 1969) since it is like half of the concert. However, it is a fine performance and video/audio quality is superb. It's probably in the top 5 of the post-Keith shows I've watched.

I highly recommend this DVD!",1274745600,5,2394,4.947761194029851
