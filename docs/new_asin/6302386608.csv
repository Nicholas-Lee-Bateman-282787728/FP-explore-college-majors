456314,4,6302386608,"A demonic black maginc curse centuries old, turns the world's most beautiful doll into thw world's most sacage killer.
Now, this ""dolly"" has her deranged eyes aimed at a little girl named Jessica, and will do anything to possess her. Bizarre events explode into a ferocious frenzy of madness. A housekeeper is torn apart. A nightwatchman is hacked to pieces. As the body count rises and the carnage continues, Jessica loses her sould to her new ""playmate"".
To save his daughter, Jessica's father must enter a nightmarish world where dark powers of evil have reigned supreme...until now!
This movie is pretty good if you are into the psychotic killer doll thing, so if you like chucky or magic this movie is for you!",1083974400,9,715,4.821138211382114
456315,4,6302386608,"Although in some ways it ripps off Child's Play, it turned out to be a pretty entertaining movie. The special effects are a mixture of good and bad. The first killing scene was great but others are just plain laughable, sometimes even scary! It's some what creative. It sets out to do everything it's meant to and so I give it a four out of five star rating. Like i said, It's so bad, It's GOOOOD!",1075248000,7,397,4.2368421052631575
456316,2,6302386608,"this is like chucky, but just a girl doll that really is the devil and tried to kill this little girl. Corny and stupid effects on killing and i could ask for better.

456318,4,6302386608,If you are in to the Chucky movies you will like this movie.  It is so funny!  The little possesed dolls are hilarious! It has some scares and a lot of laughes. Rent it with some friends so you guys can laugh and make  fun of it. Enjoy!,926899200,2,236,3.875

456450,3,6302386608,"This movie kept my interest but it's not as good as Child's Play. Chucky is funny and has a great personality (Even though he kills people for fun), his character really draws you in. If you like creepy doll movies it's worth watching! It's really not scary and there are no pop up scares (in my opinion anyways). If you're like me and just like watching B rated horror movies for the heck of it, this one should be on your list.",1479168000,,429,4.2439024390243905

456932,5,6302386608,"The Wade family moves from Los Angeles into a Mexican home sight-unseen after buying a Mexican doll factory sight-unseen.  Already, this plot sounds like something that would only feasibly happen in a bad horror movienobody does that!  But this is their lucky day, because some ancient Mayan ruins are nearby and an anthropologist accidently unleashed a ball of red glowing energy--errrr, I mean, an evil spirit!

After being given a doll from the factory, their young daughter begins acting strangely.  Her mother Marylin (Denise Crosby; Pet Sematary) has caught her talking to ""Dolly"" frequently, she draws violent depictions of animals, hisses at priests and rosaries, and speaks in the ancient Sanzian language to their devout housekeeper.

What's more is that we (the audience) see the Dolly move on her own and it's implied that she scampers about the house at night very early in the film.  And once her murderous intentions are known, we see Dolly's creepy little doll hands locking doors and picking up sharp objects, sneaking, hiding and stabbing!  It's straight out of the Child's Play (1988) playbook staged in a Mexican Poltergeist (1982) scenario.

The jump scares are tedious but Dolly is sufficiently creepy (even scary) enough to make it workand well!  As the story progresses, so too does the little girl's weirdness.  She becomes increasingly attached to Dolly and disengaged from her familyeven hostile to them.

This may not be a good film, but it's a solid B-horror.  It's greatest gift is its pacing.  Most B-horror takes 40-60 minutes for anything at all interesting to happen.  Whereas we find eerie goings on with Dolly nearly from the start, ambulatory murderous Dolly within about 30 minutes, and after an hour things continue to escalate into bonkersville.  There are no great effects, but the walking talking creepy dolls are every bit as effective as we need for his to be a lot of fun.

Speaking of this being a B-movie, Rip Torn (The Man Who Fell to Earth, RoboCop 3) plays an archaeologist and seemingly shows up for no other reason than to explain that Sanzia means ""Satan on Earth,"" reveal the ancient burial grounds entomb a Devil child with a goat head, and to blurt out an occasional displaced Spanish phrase even though everyone is always speaking English.  He is movie exposition personified, walking and talking and explaining everything.

By the way, the dolls follow suit behind Child's Play (1988) pretty hard.  They utter similar lines like ""now we'll be together forever"" and ""time to play"" and their faces become more and more evil-looking as we approach the finale as if they were slowly sapping the soul and humanity from the little girl to transmute Dolly into a living entity of flesh.  Then you have Rip Torn filling the Zelda Rubenstein's Poltergeist (1982) role and the ancient burial ground unleashing spirits that want the youngest child, a little girl whose parents have moved for the father's job, just like Caroll Anne and her family--plus the slightly older boy who discovers the evil, just like Caroll Anne's brother.

After this film, writer/director Maria Lease went on to do a few episodes of the sultry Silk Stalkings show and then backed off from direction entirely.  I'm not sure why she didn't do more horror.  Not only did this movie surprisingly not suck, it was pretty solidly entertaining.  I had been procrastinating seeing this for over a decade (some of the poster/cover art is not very promising LOL) and now I find myself recommending it to fans of evil doll movies and 80s-90s B-movie horroras this was more of a B+ movie (the same can be said for Pumpkinhead and Subspecies 1-2).

The poster art makes this movie look like something you'd want to skip.  But trust me, DON'T SKIP IT. This is solid gold B+ horror and a decent evil doll movie!",1460246400,2,3821,4.903576982892691

The acting was excellent, it was enjoyable, but i wish they would have focused a bit more on the sub-plot. The subplot is about the son who isn't extremely interesting but the lore and legends he finds out are!
It's basically a movie about a family who moves to a factory in the desert, where the husband makes dolls, and has a mine nearby (?! ). They have two kids, a daughter and a son. The daughter finds a doll her dad is making and immediately claims one as her own. That's about all i can say before i delve too deep into the plot.

I had to check the date of the movie and was surprised that it was after The Exorcist and Child's Play (the first Chucky movie).  It was sort of the Brady Bunch meets Chucky.  Totally embarrassing.  I was even embarrassed for Rip Torn, who appeared in this movie.  The parents seemed straight out of The Brady Bunch, the kids were annoying, the acting was terrible and the plot even worse.  Really stupid.  Only good thing were the special effects of the dolls' faces at the end.  I would give this no stars if I could.  Watch at your own risk.",1452556800,,809,4.256578947368421

457253,2,6302386608,"Dolly Dearest is a victim of being a poor imitation of a better horror film series- that being Child's Play of course!  Chucky is 100% scarier than these adorable angry dolls.  While Dolly Dearest does have its moments, the clichd writing severely damages it.  I mean of *course* the doll is going to attach itself to the little girl of the family, and of *course* the child is going to be the only one who can communicate with the doll.  The writing continues to be clichd in other areas too, such as whenever the mother enters the girls bedroom or outside dollhouse suddenly the doll stops moving/talking then so to not raise suspicion.  Of course!  This has been done a thousand times.

Predictable writing aside, luckily the story isn't completely about a doll gradually turning a little girl evil.  There's also a portion of the film that focuses on an archaeologist who discovers a nearby cave with carvings inside of it.  Turns out this cave is responsible for the dolls turning evil because they've been awakened by a satanic presence.  Yeah we figured that much.  This is also the part of the movie where the older brother becomes a bigger character due to his curiosity in discovering the mysteries of this cave (by eventually sneaking around and dodging Dobermans in his attempt to assist the loner archaeologist).  The brother is actually a more memorable character than anyone else in the movie interestingly enough.

While the dolls move rather realistically which is awesome for such an older movie, unfortunately they were given hideous voice acting.  They don't sound frightening at all.  They sound like Smurfs or something you'd associate with a cartoon instead.  They don't have the proper voice, memorable dialogue or personality that Chucky does for example.

And yes, there's more than one doll roaming the house/nearby factory.  There's at least two, maybe even a third.  I wish these dolls did more horrific things to people besides just locking doors all the time.  Like the Spanish lady for example.  They locked her out of the home before they inevitably killed her (arguably the best death scene in the entire film) and in other situations they lock people inside rooms after slamming the doors shut.  I feel the writing should have focused more on the killings.  The movie tries for suspense, but the clichd nature of the writing and obvious similarities to the Child's Play series sort of hamper this one I'm afraid.

I think the dollhouse outside wasn't utilized completely either.  That was one fascinating and enormous dollhouse that little girl was living in!  It should have played a bigger part I think.  Also the girl should have been more disrespectful towards her mother.  She came across more like a brat who didn't want to listen to authority figures instead of a girl who's gradually becoming possessed.  Overall a 3-star rating for the cheap laughs and the decent doll movements/facial expressions, but no higher than a 3.",1424044800,,2966,4.9114688128772634

457350,2,6302386608,"During the 80's/early 90's, when the doll trend was big and going strong, this little movie reared its ugly head to try and make a fast buck. With Chucky we had a pretty cool subplot, a goofy but catchy sense of humor, some cruel kills, blood and a definite character. Stuart Gordon's classic Dolls in the late 80's will forever remain a keeper in my eyes, and Demonic Toys -- while foul mouthed and seemingly low on budget -- was unique enough to make it work. No matter how much money this one did make (which probably wasn't too much) all it did was put me to sleep and induce a small headache.

 The Reed family moves near a doll factory (not running) that is built on top of an ancient Indian burial ground (how original). Evil little Mayan spirits come to possess the bodies of large, creepy, identical female dolls with long strait orange/red hair and freckles. One of these captures the fancy of the little girl and after she brings the piece of demonic plastic home, things go seriously bad in the Reed house.

 The daughter in question (Candace Hutson) gets on my last nerve as she quickly and predictably becomes obsessed. She changes almost overnight to curly hair and too-cute-for-word dresses as well as a ""glare"" that is supposed to make you stop dead in your tracks, but the only way I would pause when staring into a face like that is because I would be laughing too hard to move. The maid acted scared, though, too much -- the overdrama made me chuckle even more. Oooh, how freaky. And what are these glares supposed to mean? Seriously, if an adult sees a child shoot a dirty look they'll think ""Bratty child"", not ""evil force lurking beneath the youngster's spirit"".

 Her brother (Chris Demetral) is a little better in acting but doesn't as much in the way of characterization. The lead woman (mother, wife) Denise Crosby (Pet Semetary) performed well but I could never get into the roles I've seen her play. I don't know why, she's not a bad actress (although I don't find her that good either), there's just something about her that appears phony to me and makes it difficult to get into. The hubby (Sam Bottoms) was good but the final draw is that no one in this movie was remotely interesting and I couldn't have cared less if the doll killed them all.

 The main roles seem to be the mother and female child. A cool part of the film centered on a large dollhouse I would have loved to have as a kid. The girl is pretty bratty and rebellious as she's changing but learns how to work the mother by using false charms. The servants all know legends of the lands and have their religious practices to try and keep evil spirits away. As we see from the maid, having the house blessed is not the way to get on the dolls good side. The little boy likes going exploring in the mines and doing stuff he's really not supposed to do but it's all subplot.

 Most of the murders are that offscreen- while -on -screen implied dribble. The body count is good and some of the deaths inventive enough (it's bad to be a servant in these parts) but nothing could save this flick. The maid's death was particularly brutal, but again, nothing shown in detail. At least it was slightly drawn out and they attempted to build a little suspense.

 The dolls animate well and by themselves are sort of freaky but nothing stands out about them like...well, pretty much like a personality. They all act the same. Even when their faces are plain and they're trying to pass for simply toys, they're not that cuddly or appealing. When their faces scrunch up in scowls they're eerie enough and I'd hate to be chased by one of the creepy buggers in the middle of a late, dark night but here they aren't killed off too hard.

 Do yourself a favor -- if ever in the mood for a killer doll movie pop in Child's Play, Dolls, or even Demonic Toys. Never this little piece of Valium competition.",1379635200,,3881,4.455571227080395

Yes, it steals a lot from Child's Play, but what makes it interesting is that: 1) The doll is possessed by a demon, not a serial killer (thus making her a bit more powerful), and 2) it's basically like a girl-version of child's play (which I find pretty cool). It's not entirely scary or anything, but you do see the doll walk, talk, and kill quite a lot throughout the movie (unlike some killer doll films that barely show the doll doing anything).

457355,3,6302386608,"It took me almost ten minutes into the movie to realize that I had seen it before but had forgotten.  That made me wonder if it was that bad.  Well, that wasn't it.  It also wasn't because it was that good, either.  It was a middle of the road horror film.  Enjoyable, but if you watch a lot of movies you may forget the best parts of this.

I don't want to add spoilers, so I'll say what I did not like about this movie.  A few times I became impatient because the story dragged a bit, but to be fair it never dragged on too long.  It did keep my interest.

Some of the lines were very cheesy, cringingly so.  Example - Denise Crosby shouts at a nun, ""I'm not giving up my daughter to a 900 year old goathead!""

I get her frustration, but that just made me cringe.

Also, I don't think the background of the story was developed as well as it could have been.  There should have been a richer history as to precisely why the events were unfolding as they were.  To me the explanation given was a little too...lacking.

Now, what I did like -

It was fun to watch. I love ""killer-doll"" movies and this one ranks up among the better ones.

I liked the fact that the actors all looked like ""real people"" and not overly made-up and ""too pretty"" actors.  I actually felt that the Mexican workers were really Mexican workers!  That was a great touch.

The actress and actor who played the brother and sister were terrific.  The boy was funny, intelligent, and precocious without becoming annoying, imo.  He could have become a bit too much, but I think the film-makers held him back just enough to make him just right.

The little girl was fantastic and played the innocent child as well as the possessed child very well.  She reminds me of a young Drew Barrymore.  Lovely and talented.

Not a movie that you'll likely remember for the rest of your life unless you are a cult-horror fanatic, but certainly one that will pass a pleasant afternoon or a bit of a creepy night when you are in the mood for horror with touches of humour.",1355356800,,2026,4.2936507936507935

457401,1,6302386608,"Dolly Dearest (Maria Lease, 1992)

There is just one reason to watch Dolly Dearest, the sole feature film from Silk Stalkings director Maria Lease: if you have such a serious Denise Crosby fetish that you're willing to brave movies like Born, Eliminators, and this particular pile of tripe, a straight-up ripoff of Child's Play without any of the humor that made that movie worth watching maybe once a decade or thereabouts.

Plot: the Wade family--dad Elliot (Apocalypse Now's Sam Bottoms), mom Marilyn (Crosby, who will forever best be remembered from Star Trek: The Next Generation), son Jimmy (Sometimes They Come Back's Chris Demetral), and daughter Jessica (Candace Hutson, who made much of her living as a voice actor in the The Land Before Time franchise)--head down to Mexico, where dad is opening up a doll factory after discovering the work of a local artist. Despite warnings from the housekeeper (Real Women Have Curves' Lupe Ontiveros), dad goes ahead and starts getting the old factory ready for production, while Jimmy befriends an archaeologist (Rip Torn, in what may have been the nadir of his long, storied career) who's trying to uncover the tomb of a legendary local demon child. Jimmy, who fits a lot better in small spaces, is a big help. But man, Jessica starts acting funny, and a couple of folks swear they see Jessica's new doll--the last one made by the factory before the mysterious death of the original artist--moving of its own accord...

Yes, it should all sound very familiar. And there's nothing at all that should make you think you're going to get anything different than Child's Play, except the doll is of a different sex. I'm all for riffing on the plots of older movies and coming up with something interesting and original, but this isn't a riff, and Child's Play had only come out four years before; it's nothing more than a second-rate knockoff with barely competent direction and average acting at best.

The premise is just so silly and ludicrous that anyone would have to laugh out loud at the complete and total nonsensical plot. Dolly is this vicious little monster who comes to life after a Mexican doll factory is opened near the ancient burial ground of satan's spawn. So much for outsourcing! I love how Dolly would run around, she didn't say much (Dolly was the strong, psychotic type), but her facial expressions were pure evil. Picture Miss Piggy with the face of a depraved wildebeest. Dolly sure managed to put the capital-B in this b-picture! There was just an incredibly chilling quality to her that will not go unnoticed. Perhaps it's because Dolly is just a totally evil misery-machine, although she has a much better disposition than most people from NJ. The film stars Denise Crosby and includes a bunch of second-rate performances that go along perfectly with this second-rate picture.

457437,3,6302386608,"As we forge ahead on the October horror movie trail decided to stop off and witness something in the murderous doll department. Naturally one of the Puppet Masters was a top choice, and probably will happen before the months out, but on-demand gave us a different option in Dolly Dearest. This film is one of those we've seen bits and pieces of years ago just never sat down to watch the entire thing. After doing a little review research it appeared the film had a lot of good feedback, and being that it's from the fantastic decade of 90's horror didn't hurt. So with that going for it it seemed like the natural choice.

Taking place in Mexico we start with an archaeologist whose working on opening a tomb belonging to the devil worshiping Sanzia tribe. Accidentally he unleashes the evil spirit of a devil child, that was a very poorly made yet hilarious red mist looking graphic, also taking his life. So from here we have an American family with 2 kids who are set to open their own doll factory on the cursed land. Once the doll manufacturing starts the evil spirit possesses one of the harmless yet creepy looking toys making it's way to the daughter Jessica. She begins to take on some odd changes and the rest is the family trying to take out the evil spirit.

Overall Dolly Dearest was a very enjoyable killer doll flick filled with chubby banditos at every turn. When it comes to this Halloween reviewing project Sid has taken on, it's a must to get a minimum of one flick terrorized by a murderous piece of plastic. Really what's creepier then a two foot maniac doll running around loping peoples heads off? There obviously were some stale moments, but for the most part it was a good 90's horror watch. The best part would have to be when the chubby Pachanga impersonating Mexican worker is cooking up a burrito, this isn't a joke, and gets so freaked out by the possessed dolls he drops dead of a heart attack.

457439,4,6302386608,"While I understand how some might feel that this film is just a ""Child's Play rip-off,"" the truth of the matter is that anybody would say that to ANY and EVERY doll film that came out. (They seem to forget that ""Child's Play"" wasn't completely original itself! Remember that episode from ""The Twilight Zone?"" or how about the ""Zuni Doll"" from the original ""Trilogy of Terror"" series from the 70's, starring Karen Black?) I feel that ""Dolly Dearest"" is actually pretty good, despite it being considered a ""B-film"". The film does seem to pay tribute to ""The Exorcist"" and obviously ""Child's Play,"" but the setting does give it that ""Nowhere To Run"" feeling, with its location in the deserts of Mexico,as opposed to the bustling of over-populated city life in Chicago. I also feel that there is something much more haunting about this antagonist, as opposed to that of the ""Child's Play,"" series for two reasons. One, ""Child's Play,"" in my opinion was completely obliterated by its now FOUR sequels, and soon to be REMAKE! In truth, the films are more known for their dark comedy/humor, than their actual scares. But also, in that these dolls are possessed by the spirit of a demonic child of ancient legend, as opposed to that of a human serial killer with a sense of humor (there is very little of that in this film, thank goodness). What I believe is scarier about this, is that serial killers are overly-abundant every day realities to us. Whereas, the spirit world, while fabled, made legend of, and talked of since man first appeared on earth, is not as real to everybody. Imagine being chased by something,thought by many, not to even exist, as opposed to another serial killer in just a slightly different ...""package"".

457444,1,6302386608,"'Dolly Dearest' finds itself with just enough filmmaking competence to become watchable, but we'd probably be better off had it not been able to conduct a coherent scene.

The story is derivative, and stupid. Family of four moves to Mexico -- Dad's opening up a doll factory! Nice big house in the country, with a nice fat Mexican maid to top; it's gonna be some goooooooooood livin'. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, the first scene of the film finds some sort of evil spirit find its way into the factory, where some of the dolls' exist. Naturally, the little girl in the family wants a doll (dumb *)@%&!_). So, the doll comes home with her, and bad things happen.

Watching 'Dolly Dearest', all I could think of is how, by comparison, the 'Child's Play' films -- all three of originals -- are utter masterpieces. The first one, perhaps most importantly, with its unique and compelling idea, but moreover its execution of such a potentially disaster-ridden concept. Re-watching the original 'Child's Play' recently, and just now painfully absorbing 'Dearest', it's pretty easy to articulate why they're at two different ends of the ""killer-doll"" spectrum.

'Child's Play' had personality. Brad Dourif's vocal work with Chucky added so much; he had personality, wit, and growls of psychotic rage scary enough to make you run from a two foot doll without the slightest hint of shame. The doll(s) in 'Dearest', on the other hand, spout claptrap in the guise of a little girl's voice spliced with a predictably 'demonic' tone. God. Then, there's the dolls themselves. Granted, 'Dearest' didn't have the budget of Chucky, but that doesn't save it from criticism; these dolls are UGLY -- 'before' they are inhabited by the spirit of Voodoo McGee -- and once they began to walk and talk, I began to give up on the film, succumbing to the hate deep within me. I'm sorry, but utilizing the same %*#!U!J""FLQKA shot of the doll walking -- below the waste and only below the waste -- a shot which is laughable the very first time it's seen, is inexcusable. How am I to focus on the dolls' deliciously maniacal murders when I'm continually jolted out of whatever reality the film manages to evoke, courtesy of what appears to be a small manikin gliding on roller-skates, over and over? If that's not enough, I have to hear them, in their demonic-girly voice, spout tripe like 'this is fun!!!'.  I noticed something was amuck towards the earlier bits of the film, observing the doll who's mentally thwarted sweet little daughter Jessica walk into the doll house, via a camera from afar.  I could have 'sworn' that, in fact, this was no doll entering the doll-house, but a life-sized woman; or, at the very least, a midget.  Maybe the Jesus-fearing maid?  Couldn't have been; the spirits pounced Jesus and Mrs. Dusty ten minutes beforehand. What's funny, though, is that re-watching the scene, I came to the conclusion it was in fact a doll they used... Which brings me to the doll -- c'mon.  The thing, below its neck anyway, is practically obese, spouting a beastly physique and the height of a power forward.  It's just repugnant to the eyes, and when we have no choice but to look at its limited facial expressions (I could have sworn one of them looked either stoned or retarded toward the end, peering out of a dumpster in the factory) and robotic motion, we die inside.

The other thing is that this movie is tediously boring.  The pacing is unbelievably slow, and very little action occurs. In 'Child's Play' we knew, as demonstrated conceptually and by repeated mannerisms, that Chucky was befriending little Andy merely as a ploy to take his physical body and get out of the plastic his spirit had been enveloped in.  You'd think, after watching 'Dearest', that these demons inhabiting the doll are really in it all just so they can play tea-party with Jessica, or, even worse, play 'tea-party' with Jessica; i.e., they're doing some really awful things to her in the dollhouse behind closed doors, which the dolls are suspiciously prone to lock. At least maybe we'd get some sort of twisted commentary on the subject of ancient spirits -- these demons are dead on arrival, with the most anonymous of personality complexes and unknown intentions.

The acting ranges from decent to embarrassing, but by and large I withstood the apathy of the characters' pretty well.  And idiocy... By the time Jessica growls at Mommy in a deep, jacked-from-The-Exorcist voice, and Mommy's subsequent reaction, though, it became harder to endure. The Dad/Husband comes running up; 30 seconds later they're out of the room.  Mommy: ""I -- think -- she's changing.""  (when Satan propels out of someone's mouth, I'd be a little more assertive in my beliefs. You THINK?).  The Husband's reaction is priceless: 'No, the only one who's changing around here is YOU.""  Queue music.  Tear.  Such resonant, family melodrama.  Bypass all rational analysis of possessed daughter -- you aren't connecting with your husband!.  The last fifteen minutes of the film is somehow worse than that which precedes it, because all of a sudden out of this lethargy everything gets emotional, or at least the exaggerated motions' by the characters would make you think so.  It's like -- oh, so you care now?  It's a lose-lose situation; you want the dolls to dismember the whole family alive (I didn't mind the dork kid, though), and sacrifice Jessica to their primal Gods. But then, you also want to see each doll get hit repeatedly with a 4x4 -- on several specific points, upper body namely -- so how are you supposed to reconcile with such expectations?  I honestly don't know.

The contemplation is there for anyone who liked Chucky's outings, but do not, please, venture into this abysmal pit of filmic vomit.",1161216000,3,5766,4.840284842319431
457475,5,6302386608,"I give a lot of credit to the people who made this film.  They could have treated the topic of a ""killer doll"" like the ugly stepchild and made it into a B-movie with very little effort.  Instead, they put a lot of effort into a great creative plot, a creepy atmosphere, and they hired actors who could act.  Usually every movie, by the time you're done watching, you can point to one or more actors that either didn't act well or were mis-cast.  I can't say that about anyone in this film.  The children, parents and rest of the cast fit very well together.  They acted well, worked hard, and none of the lines they were given were lame or made you roll your eyes, which is a credit to the screenwriter too.  This definitely ranks up there as one of the better killer doll movies.  It feels real, it's portrayed as real and a great overall job by those involved.  Watching Rip Torn act serious was a pleasant surprise after seeing him in comedic movies the last few years.  If you're into possessed puppets or killer dolls definitely rent or buy this.

Other recommendations are the Chucky movies, ""Dolls"", ""Puppet master"", and ""Blood dolls"" (which is now my new favorite guilty pleasure movie).

Great job.  Great effort.  Thank you for not phoning it in.",1159660800,8,1257,4.504424778761062
457476,3,6302386608,"When an American family moves to Mexico because the father invested in working over at a old doll factory there to make the world's most beautiful dolls. Unknown to him, there were demons that died near a mineshaft near the factory and is unleashed into the factory  as he gives her daughter one of the dolls as a gift, soon she starts to act strange as she talks odd and is obsessed with her doll all the time as it's possesed by a demon that threatens to kill anyone in it's way.

A fun low budget variation on ""Trilogy of Terror"" and ""The Exorcist"" with Rip Torn and Denise Crosby (""Pet Sementary""). The acting is a little stiff and so is the thin plot, but this movie was so much fun to watch and has some creative kills and good special effects.

The DVD has good picture and sound with only being in fullscreen format and does have the trailer, it's still a nice addition to anyone's killer doll movie collection.

Also recommended: ""Trilogy of Terror"", ""Child's Play series"", ""Magic"", ""Dolls"", ""Pinocchio's Revenge"", ""The Omen ( 1976)"", ""The Exorcist"", ""Making Contact ( a.k.a. Joey)"", ""PIN"", ""The Fear"", ""Tourist Trap"", ""Devil Doll ( 1964)"", ""Dead of Night"", ""Evil Dead 2"", ""Poltergeist"" and ""Ghost House"".",1156723200,,1214,4.685446009389671
457477,3,6302386608,"This movie has a lot in common with all the movies Chucky is in - sepcifically, for a movie where people are expecting a lot of people to get killed, the body count is exceptionally low. The deaths are inventive, but it takes ages to get to them. The atmosphere is slightly scary, but there's been a lot of scarier movies relating to demons and/or demonic possession",1154736000,,366,4.477611940298507
457478,5,6302386608,"I rated this 5 because I thought it was the funniest horror film I've ever seen.  Mind you, I have not seen a lot of horror films.  But the company I own happens to own the production (I think) royalties on this movie, and every once in a while we get a very small check.  So I'm delighted there is interest in the film as we might get a few more pennies out of it.  Films are not our main business, but we were told it was always worthwhile to own a movie.  Do I feel like a mogul?  No way!  Keep those comments coming.",1143936000,4,520,3.895238095238095
457479,3,6302386608,"The comparisons to CHILD'S PLAY are unavoidable, but this little sleeper from 1992 still has some good moments.  An archaeologist releases the spirit of a devil child which immediately possesses one of the pretty little dolls in Daddy's new doll factory.  Daddy's little girl Jessica falls in love with the doll and it isn't too long that we know the little Dolly has possessed the little girl.

The lovely Denise Crosby does a good job as the distraught mother and Rip Torn is effective as another archaeologist.  Sam Bottoms doesn't get to do as much but he is okay.

While quite tame by today's standards, DOLLY DEAREST is a tidy little shocker.",1143849600,5,648,4.75
457480,4,6302386608,"Where as Chucky ended up being more of a comic hero, Dolly Dearest is downright evil. With a hint of ""the Exorcist"" posession thrown in, she's quite the satanic doll, making this a much darker movie than even the first Child's Play. Not to mention there's just something about little girl dolls that is much more freaky than little boy dolls. Another bonus of this movie is that it stars the actress who played the mother in Pet Semetary.

Chucky definitely married the wrong doll....

I just wish the DVD had gotten a widescreen transfer rather than a FULL SCREEN. But the movie itself is highly recommended.",1127779200,34,609,4.682242990654205
457481,4,6302386608,"I Think the 1st time i saw this movie, i was 7, i rented it and House 4 from the video store, what i remember about House 4 was the talking pizza, and in DOlly Dearest i remember the lines""Oh Goody, Were going for a ride"" which i thought was the best part of the movie, i myself love the movie b/c of childhood reasons. If you like Child's Play and The Exorist, then consider this movie, although too short and too much nonsense, the Sanzia devil child brings the movie together.

Just try the movie, i belive you will like it to a certain extent.",1101254400,6,547,4.160377358490566

7824945,4,6302386608,"Man I haven't seen this movie in years. I watched this when I was a kid and boy did it scare the hell out of me, and it also didn't help with the fact that my sister had a doll kind of like those ones and we shared the same bedroom. Watching this again was a blast from the past, and its still as creepy as I remember. Sure it hasn't aged well and is kind of dumb, but what would expect? Still its a good horror movie, its good at building suspense and the dolls are terrifying, and I'm not just saying that because I'm creeped out by dolls. Also we got Tasha Yar from Star Trek: TNG as the mother trying to save her daughter's soul from the demon dolls. This is a good movie for Chucky fans out there and shows why Hollywood should do more killer doll movies like these instead of that Annabelle crud.",1522972800,,802,4.050314465408805
7824946,4,6302386608,"DOLLY DEAREST (1991) stars Denise Crosby (PET SEMATARY, MORTUARY, TV's STAR TREK: TNG)  and Sam Bottoms as Marilyn and Elliot Wade. Doll makers by trade, the Wades, along w/ their two children, travel To Mexico to manufacture the doll of the title. Upon arrival, they discover the factory in disrepair. Also, an archaeological dig site is conveniently located nearby. Said site, was shown during the opening credits, when an archaeologist was killed, and an eeevil spirit was apparently released! Of course, the Wade's small daughter, Jessica (Candy Hutson) is immediately given a doll that just happens to have been sitting in the factory. Soon, supernatural weirdness occurs, and the daughter begins acting oddly, developing a nasty attitude, and a particular aversion to all things holy. In no time flat, we hear the pitter patter of little feet in the night, and the body count begins! While Marilyn grows leery of the devilish doll and its increasing hold on Jessica, Elliot remains clueless. Another Archaeologist, named Karl Resnick (Rip Torn- A STRANGER IS WATCHING) arrives to investigate the caves explored by his predecessor. The Wade's son, Jimmy (Chris Demetral) joins Resnick in his quest for answers. Will these people discover a way to destroy the deadly doll of doom? Sort of a cross between CHILD'S PLAY, THE EXORCIST, and THE OMEN, DOLLY DEAREST is a nice little creeper for a chilly night. Ms. Crosby is quite good in her beleaguered role. The doll itself isn't bad, though it does have some rather pungent moments of cheddar, usually when its strolling around, or somersaulting backward through a door. Still, a solid evening's viewing... EXTRA POINTS: For the bonkers, all dolls on deck, dynamite finale! It's sublime!...",1508716800,3,1743,5.137323943661972
