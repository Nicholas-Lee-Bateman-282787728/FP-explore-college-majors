8186915,2,B000OVLA7C,"Dr. Bruce Taylor shares dreams with his mental patient Richard Patterson who also talks to the ground. Patterson makes predictions and  leads Bruce to a buried skull in an abandoned wing of the hospital, one with a history.

What is unfortunate is that the single line description of the film at Amazon and at IMDB is specific information about the skull and a plot spoiler. However, that is not half bad because the film is tedious to watch. I liked the beginning, but it starts to way heavy at midpoint. The acting leaves much to be desired and the dialogue is a snooze.

Guide: No swearing or sex. Naked corpse torso. Blood. Argentine film in English.",1452124800,,654,4.620689655172414

8186917,4,B000OVLA7C,"Although this horror film does have bad actin g, that does not deter from the impending doom atmosphere that is this film. Creepy and bizzare in places, this film does try to be different, and for the most part succeeds.

You won't forget some of the images

My favorite part was when the dr in deep in the cellars under the asylum, and the patients are ""listening"" through the ground to the dr unearthing the skull...creepy indeed!",1272412800,2,432,4.597402597402597
