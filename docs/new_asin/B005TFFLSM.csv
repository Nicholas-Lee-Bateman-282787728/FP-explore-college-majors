4890462,4,B005TFFLSM,"""Mausam"" needs a lot of patience on part of viewers to see it through. At least I got really restless and fidgety in the second half as to where the movie is going and how it will end. Thankfully I had taken a large combo of Popcorn and Pepsi which really gave me something to do while the whole boring proceedings went on.

Well but I have to admit I still find the movie nice. Its good and different from the movies we see now a days. Very few times now we see village life on screen so its a refreshing change. Some scenes have sweeping vistas like the train scene or the view of the river. Camerawork is really beautiful.

Shahid Kapoor in first half looks really mesmerizing as a simple village boy. His behaviour his mannerisms and his dialogs are so different from all his previous movies and he looks younger here. Think his father brought best out of him. I did not liked him much in the second half with his moustache etc. His song ""Tashan Mein Rehna"" is really rocking. Though music on the whole is quite poor and uninspired. Background score which can lift movie and make it ethereal is missing. Such sort of movie that tells about a decade of event needed a good a great background score which is sadly missing from the movie. Editing ,good editing which makes movie exciting for the viewers is also missing. Which is quite sad since this movie had potential to be a great movie. Direction from debutante director Pankaj Kapoor is good enough does not seem like his first movie. Some dialogs do fall flat ,good story needs good dialogs to tell it in fine way to evoke emotions of movie goers,which these flat dialogs make unnatural.

Sonam Kapoor does great too here,gets a role of a life time. She is quite natural and effortless. All the supporting cast here does great too.

w

The train chase sequence here is strange. Since we have all these accidents on rise where drivers overlook signals in hurry to jump track. Quit dangerous and unsafe I hope youngsters don't start aping it.

References to Babri Demolition,Kargil and Trade Tower Attacks is quite fleeting and I feel more coverage to them or getting those archival footage could have made this movie better. At least Naseeruddin Shah his eminent colleague did it better in his 2006 directorial debut ""Yun Hota Toh Kya Hota: What If...? "".Quite thrilling sequence of plane hitting trade tower from inside a Tower Cabin. Kargil scenes seem really lousy and toy like or child like.

But at least Gujrat riots are done well just a grim reminder to naive citizens that what happened their should never be forgotten. The ending scenes do remind of Dharmendra's ""BlackMail"" where couple hide to escape from dangerous people. The whole movie seems reminiscent of Rajendra Kumar's ""Aas Ka Panchchi"" which has the same sweeping story pattern and which was much better then this. I was really glad when the movie ended its 3 Hours long. People keep saying it is inspired from Tom Cruise's TopGun which I have not seen. But the first half to me is really refreshing and Original. So I would still recommend to people to go and see it for Shahid,for the beautiful vistas and endearing supporting cast.

And no resemblance here to Gulzar's Mausam (1975) which definitely had a thousand times better music.",1327968000,2,3265,4.646447140381283
4890463,5,B005TFFLSM,"Some parts of this movie reminded me of Top Gun, but better!  Mausam is so good. What a great love story. The acting by everyone in the film was fantastic.

4890475,5,B005TFFLSM,"This is probably one of my most favorite movies. I'm so glad that I bought it on DVD. I am usually not a sucker for big romantic movies especially ones that can be quite cheesy, but the creative story line in this film was so addicting. The acting is fantastic and the soundtrack is a must-have! The songs in the film go along with the movie so well and really help add to what is happening. I would recommend this to anyone who truly enjoys Bollywood romance.",1376092800,9,460,4.2988505747126435

4890478,5,B005TFFLSM,"I love this film. I keep watching bits of it again and again. It seems to me to be more of a love poem, a painting, a work of art dedicated to the ideals of mystical Love in Sufism and Bhakti Yoga. The mystic is forever waiting in longing for the Beloved. The lyrics in many of the songs are decidedly Sufi. I believe Mausam tells us more about Shahid Kapoor's father Pankaj Kapoor, who is the writer and director. Pankaj Kapoor (age 58) must be a highly intelligent and sensitive man to have conceived this epic love story, which bears no relevance to our more decadent western view of love - but rather emphasizes the idea of ""the one true love"" for life. This kind of one true love ideal is a part of eastern mysticism, and is expressed in the film's words: ""I am in you and you are in me."" A sacred Union.

Even if you do not value the ideals of mystical union, anyone who appreciates beauty and intelligence will be happy to simply gaze at Shahid Kapoor, who is not only handsome beyond anyone I can think of, but who is also becoming an excellent and wonderful actor capable of expressing very deep and subtle feelings. Perhaps his own complex [?] relationship with his father brought many subtle feelings into his reach. I only know that I hope he will continue on this recent path of creative development and not end up like SRK, who had such seeds of brilliance in Dil Se and seems to have lost his way becoming an icon.

I also found Sonam Kapoor lovely - and however lovely her bones may be, she needs a good director who can bring out her deeper qualities. Still she and Shahid made a good couple.

In my view, Pankaj Kapoor gets the credit here for a film that really should be seen as art and not compared to ""ek tha tiger"" type entertainment. It seems that as a father he is also very proud of his son Shahid, and says this in an interview about his first born. ""Today, I'm more proud of him as a professional than I was all these years as a father. From an intelligent boy he's become a committed actor. Shahid is a star no doubt, but he refused film offers for two years for my film."" [from dna india entertainment]

Shahid's performance in Vishal Bharadwaj's ""KAMINEY"" opened us up to the depth's of this young man. In ""VIVAH"" [2006] Shahid's true-blue Sir Lancelot purity will always remain in the hearts of deep romantics, making us long for a guy like Prem! But Shahid is young, only 31, born Feb. 25, 1981 - and if Fate is kind to us, he will go on and create many great roles becoming not only India's most handsome actor ever, but perhaps the greatest one also. I suspect nothing would please his father more. Do yourself a favor and remove your heart and mind from this harsh and uncaring world - and spend some 'slow' time in a soft tender imagined place of true love and lasting devotion. Thanks to Pankaj Kapoor and his multi-talented son Shahid. OH! I almost forgot --- Shahid can dance! There is a great dance number at the very end of the film just to celebrate life and love! Even though he can easily mimic Michael Jackson's style, Shahid reminds me of the great Gene Kelly.",1349308800,4,3107,4.3517241379310345
4890479,2,B005TFFLSM,"Requires finer palate of appreciation for subtlety & nuance! Acting- good. There was too much suffering. And it was that what was expounded upon in the direction and plot of the story! Too long and drawn out purposely to make it a time framed Bollywood movie that at the end of it, you feel drained instead of requited with the characters that they finally consummated their love and lived happily ever after!",1340755200,,409,4.694444444444445
4890480,1,B005TFFLSM,"I don't understand how can one create a film solely based on MISCOMMUNICATION. But I gave it a chance and sat through the end somehow.
It looked like a pitiful attempt to salvege the movie by making the characters the part of some sentimental times in India.",1329264000,,258,4.51063829787234

8486107,5,B005TFFLSM,"It is a very inspiring movie where we can see how people in India live in a small town, their struggles, the way they interact, the respect for the elderly and how the people in Kashmir suffer with terrorism (until now).  I like the delicate way a true and profound love is portrayed and above all this is a clean and healthy movie that all can enjoy and delight in good music, colors, dance, humor and dialogues. Simply wonderful!",1506211200,,431,4.455696202531645
