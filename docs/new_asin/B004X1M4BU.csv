4491184,5,B004X1M4BU,I have always enjoyed dynasty and dallas.  This season five was great and I am looking forward to getting the other seasons as soon as I can,1315353600,,140,4.185185185185185
4491185,5,B004X1M4BU,"Like all of my Dynasty friends here from Amazon.com have been asking, when are we going to see the other seasons of Dynasty?
Why must we wait a full year in between seasons?
I always read on the Amazon discussions how Europe gets the seasons before us.
As for Dynasty 5, I managed to get both volumes ( 1 & 2 ) from Amazon and watched it all in under 2 weeks.
It was fantastic.
I think I will start at the beginning again just for the fun of it.",1313020800,,445,3.9555555555555557
4491186,5,B004X1M4BU,"Have Dynasty seasons 1-5, but won't watch any until the rest of the series comes out. Think there were Nine total, and there was a 2 hour movie that followed a year later. Let's go already!",1312675200,3,189,4.277777777777778

4491188,1,B004X1M4BU,I think its so stupid to release Dynasty season 5 here in the states for 27.99 apiece for only half the season and if you want the whole season you gotta pay almost 60 bucks which is way too expensive in my opnion when if you look at amazon uk they are selling the entire season 5 for under 20 bucks! i would so buy this from amazon uk if it wasn't region coded and i don't have a muti player dvd plaqyer...i will probably end-up buying the season anyway to try to complete my collection but it leaves a bad taste in my mouth!,1307232000,3,526,4.019047619047619
4491189,5,B004X1M4BU,"Yes, I looked at the Amazon.uk website and both Seasons 5 and 6 are available for low prices now.  HOWEVER.... these DVD's are Region 2 DVD's for Europe and will NOT play in most North American DVD players.  You need a specific player that accepts all Region codes in order to play those DVD's.  Hence, unless you have one of these special players, you will have to buy Dynasty at the higher price listed here or wait and hope that the price in North America eventually drops.",1304985600,3,476,4.448275862068965

4491191,5,B004X1M4BU,"THIS IS THE SEASON I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR. THINGS ARE GOING TO HEAT UP AND BOIL RIGHT OVER IN THIS SEASON. THIS IS THE SEASON WHEN POOR ""ALEXIS"" IS PUT ON TRIAL FOR THE MURDER OF MARK JENNINGS. IF  YOU DON'T REMEMBER WHO DONE IT, I WON'T SPOIL IT BY REVEALING IT HERE. AND SURPRISE, SURPRISE, WHEN THE REAL MURDERER IS CAPTURED AND REVEALED BY ""DEX DEXTER."" IT IS DEFINITELY SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO SEE ""ALEXIS MORRELL CARRINGTON COLBY SUFFER. THIS IS THE ONLY SEASON THAT ""ROCK HUDSON,"" APPEARS IN AS ""DANIEL REESE"", IN THE SERIES. ROCK HUDSON WAS VERY ILL AT THE TIME, DYING OF AIDS. ""DANIEL REESE"" TURNS OUT TO BE ""SAMMY JO'S DADDY AND SHE WINDS UP INHERITING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AFTER HIS DEATH. BUT SHE DIDN'T CHANGE HER CONNIVING, SCHEMING BAD GIRL WAYS. AND POOR JEFF, HE GOT SILLIER THAN HE EVER WAS, CHASING AFTER EVEN SILLIER WOMEN AND DRINKING BOOZE LIKE IT WAS RUNNING FROM THE FAUCETS. AND ""KRYSTLE"", SHE ONCE AGAIN TRIES TO DECLARE HER INDEPENDENCE BY GETTING THE BRILLIANT IDEA THAT SHE WANTED TO BREED HORSES. ""BLAKE"", OF COURSE, OBJECTED BECAUSE HE JUST HAD TO HAVE TOTAL CONTROL OVER EVERYTHING. BUT LETS NOT FORGET WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE ONE OF THE SILLIER STORYLINES IN ""DYNASTY"". ""RITA"". PLAYED BY LINDA EVANS ALSO, THE CHARACTER WAS RIDICULOUS. SHE WAS SUPPOSE TO TAKE THE PLACE OF ""KRYSTLE"" AFTER SHE LEARNED EVERYTHING SHE COULD ABOUT HER. THEIR BASIC DIFFERENCES: ""KRYSTLE"" HAD BLOND HAIR. ""RITA'S"" HAIR WAS RED. ""KRYSTLE"" DID NOT HAVE A SOUTHERN ACCENT. BUT ""RITA"" SOUNDED AS IF SHE WAS FRESH FROM THE SOUTH. THIS WAS ONE OF ""SAMMY JO'S"" SCHEMES THAT SHE FELT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO SINCE HER AUNT, IN HER MIND, WAS ALWAYS GETTING IN HER WAY. AND ""LADY ASHLEY,"" PLAYED BY ""ALI McGRAW."" SHE WAS GOING AFTER THE TWO OF THE MOST POWERFUL MEN IN DENVER: ""JEFFREY COLBY"" AND ""BLAKE CARRINGTON."" POOR THING, COULDN'T SHE GET HER OWN RICH MAN! ""AMANDA CARRINGTON, PLAYED BY CATHERINE OXENBERG, WAS BEING PUSHED INTO MARRYING ""PRINCE MICHAEL OF MOLDAVIA"" BY ""ALEXIS"" TO SUIT HER OWN WICKED PURPOSES. AND LETS NOT FORGET HOW THE SEASON ENDED, WITH ASSASSINS CRASHING THRU THE WINDOWS OF ""AMANDA'S AND MICHAEL'S WEDDING, SPRAYING BULLETS EVERYWHERE, KILLING OFF SOME OF THE CAST MEMBERS. I RECALL WHO TWO OF THE CAST MEMBERS WERE, BUT I WON'T REVEAL THAT HERE EITHER, JUST IN CASE SOME OF YOU DON'T REMEMBER, I DON'T WANT TO SPOIL IT FOR YOU. OH YES INDEED!

4491192,4,B004X1M4BU,"The ABC Network's answer to the hugely-popular primetime soap ""Dallas"", DYNASTY was created by Esther and Richard Shapiro to be the most flamboyant, daring and outrageous of all night-time drama series.  The lives of Denver's oil-rich Carrington family unfolded each and every week to the fascination of viewers all over the world, who couldn't get enough of their scandalous private affairs.

The fifth season is one of my personal favourites, although in true DYNASTY style, it has divided fans for years.  Producers brought in a new supervising writer, Camille Marchetta (who'd previously worked on the first few *good* years of ""Dallas"", including the J.R. shooting storyline) and Marchetta gave the characters bold and exciting new directions in some of DYNASTY's best stories to date.  Not content to keep the action squarely in Denver, in this season the characters travel everywhere from Bolivia, Acapulco, London and Paris.  The gamble paid off, and DYNASTY was rating through the roof by the time of the season finale that year (with sixty million tuning in).

Jailed for the murder of Mark Jennings, the first few episodes this season focus on the trial of Alexis (Joan Collins) and the events which cause another face from her past to suddenly re-appear in Denver...  She and Dex (Michael Nader) later tie the knot in England but it's never going to be plain sailing for this unlikely pair...despite their mutual love of eating caviar for breakfast.

Krystle (Linda Evans) finally gives Blake (John Forsythe) a child and you'd think that the golden Carrington couple couldn't be happier...think again!  Baby Krystina (aka ""Kwythteena"" to the diehard fans) is born prematurely--there's never a simple birth in DYNASTY Land--and it's touch-and-go for a while.  After all the baby drama, Krystle announces plans to establish her own horse-breeding business, which Blake is less than thrilled about.  He complains that Krystle is being naive and selfish, after all, he's the breadwinner and she should just be content aimlessly wandering the Carrington mansion, solving everyone else's problems!  What dreams could she possibly have?  After all, she's a Stepfor...erm...Carrington wife!

Steven (Jack Coleman) finds himself torn between wife Claudia (Pamela Bellwood) and his twinky new co-worker Luke (Bill Campbell) ...hey...wasn't it ever meant to be a marriage of convenience?!?  Adam (Gordon Thomson) cheers and schemes from the sidelines...can't he find a woman of his own?!  Of all the DYNASTY ladies I've always felt a great admiration for Pamela Bellwood's Claudia, because, despite her nuttier moments in earlier seasons, in many ways she's truly the strongest positive female presence this year.

Following her crazed ""Runaway Bride"" act in the previous season, Fallon has supposedly died with nutjob Peter De Vilbis in a plane crash, and Jeff (John James) buries his sorrows in booze and babes, until he hooks up with Peter's ex-wife Nicole (Susan Scannell) for a bizarre ""Indiana Jones"" jaunt to Bolivia, where a treasure map supposedly owned by both Peter and Fallon leads them to a priceless artifact...and possibly even Fallon herself!

Dazzling lounge singer/entrepeneur Dominique Deveraux (Diahann Carroll) ramps up her mission to make Blake aware of her true place in his family; something he's not even remotely convinced of, despite Dominique gallantly investing millions in Denver-Carrington when the business is threatened with bankruptcy.  It's only after the pair visits Blake's father's deathbed that the truth is revealed...

And let's not forget the explosive season cliffhanger...the Moldavian Wedding Massacre!  It's a real pain getting blood stains out of Nolan Miller garments...  Plus, as if that's not enough, scheming Sammy Jo (Heather Locklear) brews up the outlandish plan to destroy her Aunt Krystle using lookalike actress Rita (Linda Evans again, but channeling Ann-Margret in a deliciously trashy red wig)...  This key storyline would unfold in the next season.

New characters:  This season sees the arrival of Alexis' secret daughter from England, Amanda Bedford (Catherine Oxenberg)...but could she also be a Carrington?  Millionaire race-horse breeder Daniel Reece (Rock Hudson in his final screen appearance before dying from AIDS) turns out to be another figure from Krystle's ever-complicated past; and globe-trotting celebrity photo journalist Lady Ashley Mitchell (Ali MacGraw, in one of the show's early attempts at stunt-casting) sets her sights on Blake...and Jeff.  Oh, and let's not forget dreamy Michael (Michael Praed), the crown prince of Mouldy Diva--whoops, Moldavia.

Of all the new faces introduced this season, none is more effective than Catherine Oxenberg.  A true ""blue blood"" in her own right, Oxenberg first came to the attention of viewers playing Princess Diana no less, in a TV miniseries.  She gives the role of Amanda a true grace and poise, and if nothing else, adds an extra layer of gloss to the DYNASTY cast roster.  And she more than fills the gaping void left by the departure of Pamela Sue Martin (Fallon) in the previous year.

Includes the following episodes:
Disappearance / The Mortgage / Fallon / The Rescue / The Trial / The Verdict / Amanda / The Secret / Domestic Intrigue / Krystina / Swept Away / That Holiday Spirit / The Avenger / The Will / The Treasure / Foreign Relations / Triangles / The Ball / Circumstantial Evidence / The Collapse / Life and Death / Parental Consent / Photo Finish / The Crash / Reconciliation / Sammy Jo / Kidnapped / The Heiress / Royal Wedding",1303689600,10,5571,5.252821670428894
4491193,5,B004X1M4BU,"Paramount has just announced the entire fifth season of ""Dynasty"" will be released on July 5, 2011. The set can be purchased in two individual sets (with Volume 1 featuring the first 15 episodes and Volume 2 the last 14) or in this two pack edition.

 Season 5 was ""Dynasty's"" best and would mark the year the series became the #1 show in North America as well as globally, being seen by an estimated 150 million people.

 During the 1984-1985 television season a series of guest-stars would pop up to fill the gap left by Pamela Sue Martin who quit her role as Fallon Carrington. Among those who made appearances that year would be George Hamilton, Ali McGraw, and Rock Hudson (in his last acting role).

 The stories that year dealt with the Carrington's grieving the loss of Fallon (it was discovered she died in a plane crash), Blake and Krystle becoming parents finally, Alexis getting married to sexy Dex Dexter, Sammy Jo trying to gain money from the Carrington's by hiring someone to impersonate Krystle, the arrival of a long-forgotten love child of Blake and Alexis, and the infamous Moldavia wedding and its repercussions.

 Like other ""Dynasty"" boxsets (with the exception of season 1) there are no bonuses, but the episodes are in full frame and come in English mono sound, the way they were originally shown on their ABC run.

4491213,5,B004X1M4BU,"This is one of the many reviews I have written here about this series.  If you were a fan of Dynasty or still are, then purchase the series in its entirety. There is nothing disappointing about this show and it leaves you always looking for more after each episode. The Dynasty cast and show bring you into their world of intrigue, plots, schemes and behind the scenes deceptions and not so above board cut throat business deals. The wardrobes of the cast are of days gone by, but nevertheless you can relive all of the glamour and story lines by just watching it again and again.",1392249600,4,580,4.471698113207547
4491214,5,B004X1M4BU,It is funny to see this again after so many years... there are old things that reveal the difference in years but the luxury and basic themes are just the same.,1386633600,2,160,4.193548387096774
4491215,5,B004X1M4BU,"Dynasty started out as a mild competitor to Dallas, then zoomed upward when Joan Collins joined the cast in season 2 as Alexis. The story lines got more and more contrived as time went on, but was still a watchable show, at least up until the Moldavian wedding massacre which closed out season 5. This incident coincided with Dynasty becoming the number 1 show on the air at that time. The wedding massacre itself was rather exciting to watch, but the follow-up at the beginning of season 6 was not up to par. Changing cast members and new writers and producers did nothing to ultimately save the show. It limped along in mediocrity until it fizzled out at the end of season 9. A ""reunion"" two years later did tie some loose ends up somewhat, but poor casting choices and missing main characters diluted this show's impact. CBS/Paramount has not helped sales of this show by issuing it in expensive, half-season sets in a fitful release schedule. As I have little use for seasons 6 thru 9, I have stopped my purchase of Dynasty sets at season 5. My 115 episode series ends with all the principal players being gunned down in a hail of bullets! No fake Amanda or too much fake Fallon for me!",1379116800,2,1190,4.513888888888889
4491216,5,B004X1M4BU,This was a purchase that I am so glad that I made. I really enjoyed reliving old times and looking at the old fashions.,1377648000,,119,4.0
4491217,5,B004X1M4BU,It has always been my favorite nighttime serial. Season 5 is great because it features Rock Hudson as a guest star. This season Dynasty became the number one show in the world. One serial you can watch over and over. A special feature is a 1985 interview with Rock Hudson about his guest starring on Dynasty from Entertainment Tonight. Highy reccommended.,1372896000,,355,4.836065573770492
4491218,5,B004X1M4BU,"Got this for my mom. I like 80's soaps too, though. Great value and speedy delvery of this item! worth watchins.",1371686400,,112,4.380952380952381
4491219,5,B004X1M4BU,We ordered Dynasty Season 5 and love it. Our order was delivered on or before the promised date. We feel the price is fair. We loved Dynasty when it aired in the 80's and are so glad we found it at Amazon. The only downside to owning this collection is having to wait so long between seasons.,1347667200,,292,4.140350877192983
4491220,5,B004X1M4BU,"I purchased seasons 1 and 2 in the value pack because I saw that season 1 was not available brand new unless bought in this bundle. I plan on buying season 3 and 4 in a couple of days, so I am very excited. I am also waiting on my tax check so I can purchase season 5 as well. As for the show itself, I had the 1st season a long time ago, but I decided to sell it because I saw that no other seasons were out to buy or were listed for release anytime soon. I am glad I gave it another chance because season 2 really gave it that much needed kick into overdrive that made this show what it was to become. I am now addicted and it has become a much needed guilty pleasure for me. I am currently only in season 2 by about 7 episodes, but it keeps getting better and better. Even if this show is quite dated and campy most of the time, that may be the main reason I enjoy it so much, after all, camp does make for some of the most entertaining entertainment. So all in all, I am glad it is available on DVD and I am glad I have started watching again. This will be one item I own that I will be watching over and over again for some time to come. Only issue is that seasons are sold in volumes. Not that big of an issue for such a great show. I am more than willing to spend a little extra to own each season or each individual volume. Get off off your high horse people and buy this already!! It never fails to please my guilty pleasure appetite!",1327708800,,1443,3.8783783783783785

It is just like Gordon Thompson said it is not the story that is bad, which it is a fantastic build up to the end, it is the very poor resolution of the Massacre storyline at the begining of season six.",1315440000,,274,3.9107142857142856
