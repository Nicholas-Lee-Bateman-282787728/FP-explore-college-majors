6259364,5,B00ID9Q0CC,"This keeps my 2 year old happy and entertained during longer car rides, so I'm a fan! This is pretty much the only show that keeps his attention for entire episodes and he will watch them over and over. This is also one of the only shows made for toddlers that doesn't drive me crazy if I have to watch it or hear it a million times!",1477440000,,333,3.985074626865672
6259365,5,B00ID9Q0CC,"My daughter loves all things Mickey Mouse, and since we don't have cable we have to get the DVDs for her fix of her beloved ""Mickey"". There are five episodes on the DVD:
1. Around the Clubhouse World
2. Donald and the Beanstalk
3. Goofy on Mars
4. Mickey's Hand Helpers
5. Pluto's Dinosaur Romp

I had hoped this DVD would be a little more educational than it is (especially with the Around the Clubhouse world episode) but it still does follow the normal format of asking the kids to help problem solve so it's definitely not awful, just not as educational as some of the other Mickey Mouse Clubhouse DVDs that are out there.  My daughter still loves this DVD though and Donald and the Beanstalk is one of her favorites.",1475193600,2,721,4.454545454545454

6259384,5,B00ID9Q0CC,"Another hit for Mickey Mouse Clubhouse!!  This DVD has 5 episodes:
1. Around the Clubhouse World (a little longer than a standard episode, closer to 30 minutes)
2. Donald and the Beanstalk
3. Goofy on Mars
4. Mickey's Handy Helpers
5. Pluto's Dinosaur Romp

Another great compilation, and a complete lifesaver for road trips!  Our collection of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse DVDs has absolutely saved us during long trips in the car.  Our kids love watching an episode of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse every morning, and on car trips they get the treat of watching them on the car DVD player.  The worth of these DVDs (if your little one is a fan) is immeasurable while traveling!  We've gotten through hours and hours in the car, on planes, etc because of Mickey!",1431648000,14,750,4.730769230769231
