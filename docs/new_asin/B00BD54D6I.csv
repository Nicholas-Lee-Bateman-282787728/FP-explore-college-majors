8566580,5,B00BD54D6I,"I recently saw Ian McCormack's life (portrayed in the movie ""The Perfect Wave"" on tv, the UP channel).  It is an amazing story.  I am going to order the set of 3 dvd's and the book.  I could not stop watching the movie.  It is a perfect portrayal about a surfer who comes to know God's amazing forgiveness through a diving accident where he was stung 4 times by box jellyfish in Mauritius.  What was most amazing (to me) was the praying Mother and how she interceeded to the Father for her son- so encouraging for me to keep praying for my sons.  God heard her prayers and answered them.  I encourage you to see this movie and read the book.

8566581,5,B00BD54D6I,"This was a great testimony. It will bring you to tears. And I am not easily moved by just any testimony a person gives. This man when he was young lived for nothing but pleasure by his own admission. He was deep sea diving and was stung by box jelly fish 4 times (one sting will kill a person) while in the water and once on the boat with his arm in the water. He tried to get help but  a cab driver and hotel workers thought he was drunk or on drugs and treated him horribly. He finally  was taken to the hospital where he died.
This is a reinactment as to what happened, diving and all.  He found himself in hell with the devil then was taken up to heaven and was in the presence of the Lord God. It is a very beautiful story of Gods love and redemption. He was sent back to life here where he has shared his story ever since. Done very well . I could watch it over and over. I think this is the best story of its kind together with the pastor that went to heaven and saw his pets there.
Also I recieved these DVDS right away and even an extra one with a book. This is clearly a ministry not a get rich quick scam. The DVDS are very inexpensive, but very good!",1399593600,3,1162,3.9361702127659575
