8347923,4,B001Y44DTK,"Recently we received a promo code for a free DVD from the Redbox.  When the ""new releases"" button was hit the first listing was ""My Friend Rabbit: Hello Rabbit"".  The information section below stated it was a movie for pre-schoolers.  Well, we are long past being pre-schoolers but with a movie starring a rabbit (and his name being ""Rabbit"") what bunny lover could resist renting it - especially since the price was right.

True to the blurb, ""My Friend Rabbit"" is definitely aimed at pre-schoolers, in the vein of ""Sesame Street"".  It teaches young children the importance of respecting one another when playing together.  Vocabulary words are introduced such as smart, puzzle, conundrum and humongous.  A running theme through all five episodes is on solving problems by thinking them through together in a logical manner.  This is accomplished by using Rabbit's best friend, Mouse, and Jasper the alligator, Thunder the slow-witted purple rhino, four young geese named Pearl, Amber, Jane and Coral, Beaver, and the Elephant (who is only in one segment).

In the first episode the gang deals with the problem of stopping the leaks in Beaver's dam.  In the second, they learn that the moon can be reflected in still water.  In the third, they figure out that everyone cannot be the leader at the same time.  In the fourth, these lovable characters learn the futility of trying to catch a rainbow.  And in the last episode they learn the importance of relying on their senses of touch, hearing and smelling to find their way in a dense fog.

The animation in ""My Friend Rabbit"" is more along the lines of a ""Crusader Rabbit"" cartoon than Walt Disney's ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", but still it is great fun to watch.  There is a nice theme song that is played at the ginning of each segment that children can easily learn the words to and so sing along.  Whenever Rabbit needs to do some deeper thinking, he ""jump thinks"" and ""think hops"", and each time his feet hit the ground it makes a funny ""boing"" sound.  Rabbit has a contagous laugh and likes to act in a zaney manner when having a good time.

The stories are based on the book by Eric Rohmann My friend Rabbit.  This is a great DVD for pre-schoolers and highly recommended as such.  So, if you happen to obtain a Redbox promo code and ""My Friend Rabbit: Hello Rabbit"" is still among the listings, you might want to put a smile on your face by viewing it for yourself.",1244332800,6,2424,4.645539906103286
