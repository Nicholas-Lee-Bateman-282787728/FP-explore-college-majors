1215346,5,B00000G3GH,"I have a number of Rodney Yee yoga dvds and I love them all.  This one is no exception. It's very subtle but very effective. Nothing overly crazy, just simple movements that engage your core and help strengthen it.  I've seen a tighter tummy in just 2 weeks of doing this 3 days a week.  A good ab workout and a relaxing way to do it.  Highly recommended.",1442880000,,355,4.176470588235294

1215370,4,B00000G3GH,I love Rodney Yee yoga DVDs.  I do think this is a really good ab work out but I have to admit that I skip through the first 7 1/2 minutes to get to the actual work out part.  I think this ab routine has a lot of variety for other ab workouts.,1430870400,,243,3.5660377358490565

1215438,4,B00000G3GH,I would give this 5 stars for quality but 4 stars for availability. I have this workout on a set of 5 workouts from a store here in town. I have been doing ab workouts for almost 3 years and this is great. I have a bad hip and lower back this workout really helps. I feel strong and relaxed after doing this workout.

1215476,5,B00000G3GH,"I love everything I have so far from Rodney Yee. They must have redone the cover of this DVD, because the video itself looks likes late 80's early 90's. The exercise itself is great, and really does work on your core. The moves are repetitive, but we're focusing on one area of the body here. I had added this into my weekly routine and love it.",1395619200,,345,4.242424242424242
1215477,5,B00000G3GH,I always start my Yoga workouts with this Rodney Yee dvd. It was exactly what I had wanted for a long time. Not too difficult and yet getting my abs toned up in record time. Not to mention the wonderful instructions from Mr. Yee along with his excellent examples. All this plus seeing and feeling the beautiful locations.,1393891200,,321,4.551724137931035
1215478,4,B00000G3GH,"If you really wanted to get great abs, I'm not sure this video would accomplish that goal. However, I've been using it after a full tummy tuck and it is just right for my weakened ab muscles. I'd suggest this to anyone who has had abdominal surgery or for a senior citizen who needs to gain core strength.",1393286400,,305,4.275862068965517
1215479,5,B00000G3GH,This is a good ab program and if you stick with it you will feel good about yourself and get results.  All of the Rodney Yee programs have been good for letting myself unwind and still take care of me.,1393200000,,201,4.025

1215481,5,B00000G3GH,"Fast delivery, love the easy but effective work out! If one consistently work on once AB, one will notice improvements within a month. Things I noticed in my life after exercising with Rodney: good sleep (deep sleep less dreams), improved lower back pain, flexibility (gradually over time - do not expect next week-I am a man and thought I could do these easy looking exercises with no problem-to my surprise could not hold my legs up for 5 seconds, but after a month I am agile then ever), fell light, and yes my stomach is flat. Since then, I bought one more Rodney's Yoga media.",1387065600,4,581,4.542857142857143
1215482,2,B00000G3GH,Hard to do for me. Most likely my weaker abdominal muscles. My kids liked doing the exercises more than I did,1386720000,,109,4.238095238095238
1215483,4,B00000G3GH,Easy to follow along with DVD. It arrived in a timely fashion and is a good starting solution for those that are new to yoga,1384992000,,124,4.0
1215484,4,B00000G3GH,Nice abs work out. Just wish he didn't go so fast. Perhaps not the best video for a  beginner despite title.,1384300800,,108,4.142857142857143
1215491,4,B00000G3GH,"Although easy to follow, as all of Yee's videos, this one is not for the abs-challenged! Some very difficult moves for those of us out of shape!",1383696000,,144,4.37037037037037

1215493,3,B00000G3GH,"I really enjoy Rodney Yee's yoga DVDs, especially ""A.M. Yoga for Your Week."" I bought this for when I want a similarly short but also more vigorous workout in the evening. It does the trick fairly well, but I would have liked a little more challenge, and you can tell that this was originally filmed quite a few years ago.",1383091200,2,322,4.383333333333334

1215495,4,B00000G3GH,"This workout definitely focuses on the abs, and I find it is challenging at various levels.  I am truly a beginner at yoga, and the first time I did it, I was so sore the next day!  But now that I've been using it for awhile, I find that I am able to do the poses more fully and continue to challenge myself.  The only gripe I have is with the length of the video -- its run time is about 24min, but once you fast forward through the monologue and such, it's only about 20min at most.  Not sure if a 20min workout is worth the cost of this DVD, but it IS effective and I would still recommend it to those who want a quick, effective abs workout to integrate into their yoga practice.",1379894400,4,683,4.0
1215496,4,B00000G3GH,"I was hoping for something more intense even though it was for beginners. I still like the instructor, music and scenery but his other workouts are better.",1379635200,,155,4.777777777777778
1215497,4,B00000G3GH,"I've had the video of this for years and needed to upgrade to DVD.  I have arthritis in my knees and can't do many of the poses in traditional yoga but since , as the title says, this is for abs,  it doesn't  hurt my knees.  I still feel as if I get the yoga ""experience"", and a good abs workout that isn't too difficult for this 60+ old body to handle.",1376092800,,353,3.861111111111111

1215500,2,B00000G3GH,"I'm usually really satisfied with Rodney Yee's yoga, but with this one I wasn't. It was boring and slow. I didn't feel like my abs were being worked, and I didn't like the fact that you had to a have a rope with it, I enjoy ab exercises that require only using your body.",1369094400,,271,4.037037037037037

1215502,4,B00000G3GH,"I just received this DVD in the mail two days ago and just did the routine yesterday for the first time. I woke up this morning and I could definitely feel it in my abs--not too painful, just a pleasant burn to prove I worked them harder than I generally do :-) The routine itself is short enough to do even if you're a little rushed for time, and it didn't feel strenuous, even to a yoga beginner like me.",1359504000,,406,4.0875
1215503,5,B00000G3GH,If you're wanting to get started reshaping your body...this is the way to go! All of Rodney Yee's videos are worth the price.,1358208000,,125,4.478260869565218
1215504,5,B00000G3GH,This was recommended by a friend and I always wanted to get it and found it on Amazon.  I purchased it and I do really like it!  It also came right away in the mail.,1356739200,,165,3.6857142857142855
1215505,1,B00000G3GH,"I own several Rodney Yee yoga DVDs that I enjoy but I was very disappointed with this one. It was just SO slow and I am a yoga beginner.

1215506,5,B00000G3GH,Excellent. Clear instructiIons to learn yoga in a perfect way. Good pictures and video . Instructions point to the proper way to follow the pose and how to avoid common mistakes,1345075200,,177,4.741935483870968
1215507,4,B00000G3GH,"This workout is organized like any of Rodney Yee's yoga programs with a little breathing exercise to warm up and then the relaxation pose at the end, with a good 20 minutes of ab poses in between.

The poses are really a gentle way of doing an ab workout, even though they can be strenuous (depending on your fitness level of course). I find the poses also to be easy to modify to what I can and cannot do.

After doing it a couple weeks in addition to my regular workouts I am noticing improvements in my abs.

The only thing that is annoying about this DVD is that they don't have it set up so you can easily get to the beginning of the workout, I have to press skip a couple of times to skip over the introductory speech by Rodney. It is good to listen to once, but who would want to hear that every time?

Anyway I would definitely recommend this to yoga/Rodney fans for a little extra help with your abs.",1331337600,8,909,4.1477272727272725
1215508,5,B00000G3GH,"I find Rodney Yee, very comforting and easy to follow. I love his dvd's. You also get great results.  It is better to start out with the beginners.  I feel so relaxed after doing yoga with Rodney.

1215509,5,B00000G3GH,"I'm pretty sure I have a huge crush on Rodney Yee.  First of all, this was my first Gaiam yoga dvd purchase, and I have never regretted it like so many other exercise dvds.  I could work out with Rodney everyday (and sometimes do!).  His voice is mellow and his instructions are clear.  My abs really feel it after doing this workout! I would recommend this dvd to anyone, and have! My sister and mother are now active Rodney followers as well!",1327968000,2,444,4.378048780487805

I thought at first the video was just doing a warm up but the whole video is like a really slow meditative warm up/cool down.  Very disappointed and total waste of money.  I cannot imagine anyone really reaping any noticeable benefits from doing this video except for maybe lowered blood pressure or lowered stress levels.",1327190400,3,489,4.773809523809524
1215512,4,B00000G3GH,"I watched and did this workout for the first time today. Im not in particulary good shape and my abs are weak and a little flabby. I have decided to get into yoga again after a brief trail years ago. The workout is harder than it looks of course, and I couldn't hold or do all of the poses as well as Yee, but I expect this to improve as my fitness improves. The only things I didn't like about it was the breathing part in the begining were you just sit and breath for a few mintues, I can do that on my own. The other thing I didn't like is that this dvd is only 25 mintues. It would have been 5 stars if he had included a second 25 mintues session. But its certainly more interesting to do than a bunch of boring crunches either on the floor or in my ab loung.",1326067200,,763,3.8974358974358974

You can feel the burn in your abs. However; he does a set of straight leg lifts which I cannot do, but I modify and still feel that this is a very effective abs workout. Like I said, a few modifications and I'm good to go!",1325980800,,377,3.973684210526316
1215514,1,B00000G3GH,"I am giving this a one-star because this DVD was not closed captioned as labeled on the Amazon website.  Either I got the wrong edition of the DVD , or Amazon needs to do some checking of manufacturers' claims for their product specifications.  It is a waste of time for me as a hearing-impaired person to shop for captioned DVDs on Amazon if they can't get the caption details correct.

The company should caption their DVDs, too.  Very disappointed as this seems to be a popular yoga video and instructor.",1321056000,2,507,4.6

1215516,4,B00000G3GH,"i love this dvd...the moves are challenging for a beginner, and are thoughtfully presented by rodney yee.  i would give it 5 stars, but it's impossible to skip through the extraneous waiting for the actual set of exercises to start without fast forwarding.  if not for that, it would be perfect.  the ab workout presented is fantastic, varied and interesting.  i definitely recommend this video.",1316822400,,395,5.030769230769231
1215517,5,B00000G3GH,SUPERB!!!  I have not found a yoga Vid I liked in a few decades. I got this to try it. and WOW my abs are sore already and getting firmer after just 2 wks~! I liked this instructor so much I just bought his Ultimate Power Yoga DVD and am going to do that too. I have a gym membership..2 in fact but driving the 20 min round trip is not conducive to my schedule. The BIGGEST plus is that I not near as stressed either!,1315180800,,417,3.8488372093023258
1215518,1,B00000G3GH,"This DVD is definitely NOT for beginners, so the ""for beginners"" part of the title is very misleading.

The DVD presents a moderately rigorous abs workout, perhaps fine for that purpose. However for someone new to yoga who might be expecting a general introduction to yoga and any of its meditative/relaxation aspects, the DVD is not representative and could be a downright turn-off.

1215522,5,B00000G3GH,"If you dread the usual run-of-the mill, boring crunches but still desire a toned Abs, I dare you to try this new method and you WILL NOT be disappointed.  You can FEEL THE BURN after this workout. Rodney does a great job at explaining the poses/moves.  The movements are fluid, backgrond music is relaxing, pace is right on cue.  This is by far my favorite Ab workout and definitely a great workout for all fitness levels, beginners, intermediate and advanced alike.  In the beginning I could not do some of the more challenging poses but after a couple of practices (1-2 times a week) for about 3-4 weeks, my core gradually became stronger and eventually I was able to master all the moves/poses for a challenging and effective ab workout. Practice does make perfect.  If you are consistent with your practice and take the time to do this right you will not be disappointed. This workout not only tones the Abs but also has the added benefits of yoga relaxation.  After each workout you will also feel relaxed/refreshed and not stressed as you do with ""regular crunches."" This workout is easy enough for a beginner to follow and practice while building strength/endurance, yet challenging enough for intermediate to advanced workout. For beginners practice once or twice a week and modify advanced poses as they build strength.  More advanced users can increase the number of days per week or hold the poses longer for greater challenge.  Either way you'll feel the burn. Thanks Rodney!!",1298419200,4,1488,4.853754940711463

1215525,5,B00000G3GH,"I had a bike accident a while ago that left my shoulder in pain for a long time.  Due to problems in my shoulder, I started having tenseness in my neck and upper back.  Having not been back to regular workout/biking yet, I have also fallen out of shape.  A friend of mine recommended me to try Rodney Yee's Yoga for Beginners to help relax better.  She recommended that I could move up to other DVD's as I excelled on this one.  As a result, I bought a bunch of DVD's with Rodney Yee as the Yoga instructor.  I know I was taking a risk, what if I did not like his DVD's?  But, I trusted this individual's recommendations and here I am.

I started off with Abs Yoga for Beginners DVD.  I wanted to start off with Yoga for Beginners, but Amazon.com did not have that one available.  I haven't tried the other DVD's yet, but if it is anything like this one, I am sure I will like them too.  The Abs Yoga for Beginners is absolutely a great way to get your day started.  Having done no yoga myself, I did not know what to expect.  Rodney Yee is really a great instructor of what to do and how much to do for those who are not as good in shape as he is.  As always, you should consult your doctor before you embark on any exercise activity.

Rodney Yee gives succinct directions as he demonstrates yoga.  He refrains from excessive talking which helps a lot - especially if you're going to do it everyday like I am trying to do.  The music is great and very relaxing, the narration just right.  I still have trouble staying in tune with breathing part, when to inhale and when to exhale.  But, don't worry, it is all in there, you just need to train your body and mind for the right time and length to breathe in and out.  Don't be fooled though, Rodney Yee is in greatest shape and he makes things look very easy.  I would recommend anyone doing any kind of activity to always warm up for it at least for 2 minutes; this DVD is no exception to warm up.  Stretching and bending over still require warm muscles.  And never force yourself too hard.  Do as best as your can, and gradually improve yourself when you can.

With Abs Yoga for Beginners, you will get a nice stretch, a good posture and a pretty good abs workout, all in 15 minutes.  In a nutshell, I would recommend this product to anyone out there who is willing to give yoga a shot!",1269043200,9,2338,4.186098654708521
1215526,5,B00000G3GH,"Anything Rodney Yee does is good, but nobody else comes close to this for yoga for the abs. It isn't too difficult for those who are just getting started and it's still good for a short practice session for those who aren't brand new beginners.

I recommend it highly!",1266192000,,268,4.469387755102041
1215527,5,B00000G3GH,"I should start this by saying that I have been doing yoga for about a year and working out hard for the same time.  I was looking for a difficult, new way to attack my abs, just to mix it up from all the different crunches and weighted ab moves I normally do.

My first time through this dvd, I was bummed.  It was not really yoga, but also, very very easy.  Anyone could start here.  The more I thought about it though, the more I modified it to work for me.  For example, one move that you keep returning to is called ""staff pose"".  This pose, you sit with your legs straight in front of you and pressed together.  I started keeping my legs slightly off the ground and never letting them touch from the beginning to the end.  This is much more difficult.

If you understand how to push yourself harder than further than you ever thought you could go - I recommend this dvd.",1262476800,3,875,4.18562874251497

1215529,5,B00000G3GH,"I bought this DVD because my abs needed toning, and I needed something that wouldn't be too strenuos yet would still be a beneficial workout.  I am over 60 and not terribly flexible. Other abs workouts that I've tried were too difficult for me.  Rodney Yee is so explicit in his instruction, and his voice is so soothing that I can do these exercises with my eyes closed. At the end of the DVD I feel both productive in helping to tone my abs and relaxed at the same time. Plus, I notice that my flexiblity is increasing. I have to modify some of the poses to suit my physical limitations, but I still notice an improvement in the way I feel and the way my clothes fit.
I enjoy this DVD so much that I bought another Rodney Yee DVD and plan to buy more, just for variety.",1252800000,7,771,4.167785234899329
1215530,4,B00000G3GH,"This workout although only 26 minutes long has basic yet progressively harder exercises and I definitely felt it working my abs by the end. Beginners shouldn't have any problems with this flowing sequence of poses and as usual Rodney's voice instruction is flawless. I think what I liked the most about ABS YOGA is that this is an Abdominal workout without crunches and I appreciated learning some different moves to help combat the muffin top.

Filmed in Death Valley National Park, the backdrop here is a beautiful desert setting. And although I recognized the ambient music from several other Yee DVD's, its pleasant enough and doesn't distract.

Beginning in a seated position the first part of this workout concentrates on breathing exercises then moves onto your hands and knees for Cat Pose and finally to your back where most of the workout is performed. With repetitions of knees to chest, head to knees and slowly lowering and raising your legs, you begin to feel the burn. Then Rodney leads us through side twists and several Half and Full Boat Poses which get progressively more difficult as does the burn. Towards the end we stand for Mountain Pose and Foreword Bend before sitting again into Staff and Cobblers Pose. The relaxation segment is short but well done and you'll come away feeling tighter and relaxed.

I believe this might be a good introduction to yoga for first timers, giving you a taste of the breathing and energy without overwhelming you with too many traditional yoga poses. And for those who do a regular yoga practice this is a great workout that you will definitely feel in your abs the next day. Namaste.",1249862400,6,1641,4.832740213523132

It may be a little strenuous in the beginning but its no where NEAR doing say 500 crunches with a drill sergeant instructor screaming ""500 more maggot"". A little practice, and you'll be all set. Funny story, one night I came home from band practice feeling tight and uncomfortable in the stomach. I Ploppped in the Yoga Abs DVD and voila! The Gas just POURED out of me in Long Loud booms.

The results are effective as Rodney takes you step by step into
 deep core muscle toning with yoga, as Rodney in a tranquil voice is guiding the breath, then the pose. This program is not lengthy or boring or unrealistic so everyone can join in. Some of the poses are boat pose,
cat and cow, relaxed cowboy pose and so much more!
The setting is nature at its best, the beautiful sun, sand and a tranquil lull of the breath attuned to your body

It even gets into the more esoteric ab work that gives an 'internal cleansing', but bear in mind though it's less than 30-minutes and not an 'in-depth' workout so it's good for all levels of practitioner.

My discrepancy is basically with the attitude of the teacher and the music selection.(I guess you could tell) I like to make my classes as fun and enjoyable as possible.

1215555,5,B00000G3GH,"Several years ago, I practiced Yoga in the beginner mode with 2 of Rodney Yee's VHS tapes. From the start I took to them like a duck to water and caught on very fast. I did these for about a year and them moved and got away from Yoga for a couple of years due to job, personal, not enough time, etc. Now I am a Yoga re-beginner, I started with the Rodney Yee Yoga for AM and PM. *What has helped me most is I bought 2 books on all of the Yoga poses with instructions (the best one is the Rodney Yee Book of Yoga, it is the most detailed and has more instructions and pictures). Then I read these BEFORE I began this ABS Yoga or AM/PM Rodney Yee DVD's. By reading the books and re-learning the Yoga poses, I was familiar with them BEFORE I started this DVD and the AM/PM for Beginners by Rodney Yee DVD. However, I have found that this is THE VERY BEST BEGINNER YOGA DVD for any beginner as it is easy to follow, yet you feel the stretch. After several sessions, I already feel the difference in how I look and feel. This DVD REALLY WORKS! This DVD works from a gentle stretch warm-up to the work out of Yoga for ABS and the ""cool-down"" relaxation is at the end--a perfect 20 minute session! Because it is just 20 minutes total, it fits right into my day in the early morning to get me going and full of energy for my day! Here is why the Yoga is such a big help to me and I believe it will be a big help to you:
1) It limbers the body.
2) It stretches the muscles and firms the muscles.
3) After doing the Yoga, I find that I have SUPER energy and in a wonderful mood ALL DAY LONG!
4) It is the best medicine for my body, mind and spirit that I have ever found!
One day last week, I missed doing my Yoga in the AM and was sluggish all day. Will not miss another Yoga session. Now, I do the Yoga every day and with just 20 minutes, it is so so so do-able!
*Each evening I do the Rodney Yee ""Yoga and Meditation"" DVD, this relaxes me and I find that I am much more relaxed and sleep better. Sometimes, I do the ""PM Yoga for Beginners"" with Patricia Waldren (This is on the AM PM Yoga for Beginners). This one is also excellent for unwinding and relaxing for the day.
If you are in need of working on your ABS and want to have some Yoga practice at the same time, this is the DVD to buy! I give it 10 stars!
After this one, I am so impressed, I ordered 2 more Rodney Yee Yoga CD's from Amazon so I will have some variety. I have 4 total of Rodney Yee's DVDs. To me, he is the BEST Yoga Instructor there is!",1185148800,21,2503,3.9291338582677167

You will definitely have sore abs after your first time using it, but it's not boring like doing tons of crunches.  The breathing and relaxation techniques at the beginning and end are great, also.

But here's how the video goes:

In the VERY beginning of the video you just kinda lay there watching 500 precautions go across the screen. Then after listening to people say all these wierd yoga words for 10 minutes, the workout begins.

In the beginning you just kinda sit there and the half-naked yoga guy says all this wierd stuff that relaxes you.

Then you move onto the actual workout portion, which isn't long, like 10-15 minutes. The workout part was actually pretty good for toning my abs.

To explain...I have done both The Bar Method and Lotte Berk workouts and both have similarites in the ab portion to this tape in that you have to hold your back really up off the floor and hollow the belly. The other tapes really stress that you keep your ribs up off the floor and that makes all the difference in the integrity of the pose. Rodney does not really stress this point. I like this one because even though you are working the abs it is very relaxing and it's a great one to do after a really brisk walk.,1137542400,12,758,4.026490066225166
1215572,3,B00000G3GH,"I found this DVD to be disappointing because I was expecting a more challenging work out.  If you are beginner level, this DVD will be more appropriate for you. But to be honest, the work out is very short and is comprised of more stretching than actual exercises.  You can receive better value for your money by purchasing a more challenging DVD and slowly building up your strength until you can successfully complete all of the moves.  I would normally give this DVD two stars, but you have to give them some credit for interesting scenery, music, and overall presentation.",1127779200,9,576,4.74
1215573,5,B00000G3GH,"This video was my very first introduction to yoga; I had absolutely NO experience with yoga prior to trying this practice. Although it doesn't involve many traditional yoga poses, the exercises flow together in a way that is unique to yoga. In fact, when I used the video for the first time, I wasn't quite sure when the warm-up ended and the ""real"" workout began--the transition was that smooth and gentle.

The workout begins in a seated position and focuses on breathing, then moves on to hands and knees for a back stretch (Cat pose). The majority of the workout is performed lying on your back, where you will do simple yet challenging leg extensions and twists to target the abdominal area. After a quick rise to a standing position, the workout returns to the floor to end with lying relaxation poses.

Although the moves become gradually more difficult, I think that most beginners will be able to perform the majority of this workout. I definitely believe that this workout has helped me to develop stronger abs). Rodney Yee is a wonderful instructor--he has a calming voice, his instructions are clear and precise, and he is not overly ""new age-y."" I would definitely recommend this video for anyone looking to thoroughly exercise their abdominals without doing crunches for a change.",1116892800,139,1294,4.877272727272727

When I fist started yoga I found some of the poses too taxing for my back (so I skipped or modified them). Now that I have gotten stronger I really like this workout. It starts easy and gets more difficult.  If you do what you can you will make progress and be able to do more.
Definitely heed the warnings of other reviewers: if you have lower back problems be very careful and modify some of the poses.
If you are a beginner and have not done other ab exercises before you might find this video very challenging. If you have some ab strength already this will take it to the next level.",1073952000,8,639,4.2809917355371905
1215576,5,B00000G3GH,"This tape is phenomenal.  I never thought I could find an ab workout relaxing, but that's exactly what this tape offers.  There's a strong focus on breathing and some of the new age things you come to expect with yoga, but it definately provides a great ab workout in a short amount of time.
Yee's voice is soothing and he's very discriptive about what he's doing so it's easy to follow along.  There are no insane poses that are impossible for beginners.  I have problems with my lower back, but I have no difficulties at all doing any of these poses.  You have options other than the boring standard crunches and situps and it's wonderfully refreshing.
If you're a little more advanced, this may not be the best tape for you, but if you're just starting out or if you're looking for something specifically for your abs to ad to your program, this is great.  I found that I can do my more rigorous tapes during the day and do this just before bed.
If you're limited on time and would like to do some type of exercise at night, but don't want to get too wound up that you can't sleep, this is a great tape for you.  It's short.  It does what it promises and it's relaxing.",1071792000,,1172,4.319634703196347
1215577,5,B00000G3GH,"Definitely great for beginners to yoga! My only caution is that your BACK must definitely be strong in order to comfortably work the abs- in this or any other *abs* workout- so if you are really out of shape, I'd highly recommend spending the time and money on a good back exercise video.
Yoga has been one of my greatest teachers. I'm middle aged, fairly flexible, and have been doing other forms of yoga for years, yet I had never focused on my *abs*. Due to medical problems, I had never really worked this mid-section of my body, and they were terribly out of shape. Yet for years, I have done a great deal of yoga to strengthen my back, and I have the flexibility of a MUCH younger person due to yoga.
Yoga is never really about spot-training any individual part of the body. It views the body as an integrated whole, movement connected to breath, with an awareness that is often absent in other popular forms of exercise. Moving into the postures -the asanas - brings centering and balance to your movement, serenity and peacefulness to your state of mind.
Rodney Yee's *Yoga For Abs* lives up to the best in the Iyengar yoga tradition. He begins this workout with an emphasis upon the breath, connecting the breath to the center of the body, where all the movements in this video originate. There is a quiet, meditative warm-up focused on breathing, which lasts about 4 minutes. Then follows the more intense, yet still quiet, part of the workout, which lasts about 12 minutes. No pumping here! Most of the video is done on the floor, lying down, with many legs lifts and Yee again emphasizing the breath. The most difficult asanas for me are the variations of the *bow pose*, and I must do a modification, as I am not yet strong enough to do these. Your back must be strong to effectively do this part of the workout. The video ends with a cool down and a relaxation, which lasts 3-4 minutes.  The entire video is filmed in a beautiful desert, with Yee surrounded by sand dunes and mountain sky, and his voice-over is peaceful and soothing.
If you are still young and in relatively good shape, and used to doing heafty cruches for your abs, you will probably be bored with the meditative quality of yoga. Rodney Yee's style is soothing and focused, allowing you to work into the more intense, yet quiet asanas. I've been working with this video, in combination with other yoga videos several times a week for a couple of months now, and I can definitely feel and see a difference. I look forward to exercising with this, and I feel fantastic when I come to the end of this video!",1070064000,7,2587,4.515991471215352

Me being quite physically fit, still felt that nice burn in the abs.  It starts out pretty easily, than gradually increases in hardness.  The transitions were so smooth, I could bearly tell when the real workout started.  I love how there is a 3 minute relaxation at the end.  Rodney Yee is a great instructor, and cued very well.  Also the scenery was simply beautiful.  I felt so refreshed at the end of the practice.  So my last words are GO FOR IT!!...you'll be happy that you did.",1050192000,4,602,4.36036036036036

Hearing yoga is the way many celebrities get their girlish figures back after having a baby, I reluctantly bought this video, chosen because it's for beginners.  The pace of the tape is not rushed, & instructor Rodney Yee's guidance through the poses is serene and encouraging.  But don't let that fool you... I worked up a sweat after the first pose!  Who would think that doing an exercise so non-aerobic would be so effective?  The poses are simple enough to memorize, so I can go through the session without actually watching the tape if I choose, & they were easily modified in the beginning to suit my initial lack of stamina and flexibility.  After just a couple months, I feel wonderful, lighter on my feet, & I can see my ""mommy tummy"" dwindling away!  Hallelujah for yoga!",1049846400,11,915,4.716981132075472

1215581,4,B00000G3GH,"Speaking as a person who has done yoga before and whose abs are in pretty decent shape, I think this tape offers something that 8 billion crunches can't.  It offers RELAXATION.
OK, you're probably skeptical about a hard ab workout that can be relaxing as well.  But, this tape does not disappoint.  Rodney Yee is a great instructor, and the clear, soothing voice-overs make this very easy to follow.  The basic exercises focus on isometric exercise (tensing your abdominal muscles and holding them in a stationary position while maintaining the tension) rather the conventional isotonic abdominal exercises (i.e., crunches).
Some of them are rather difficult, and, if you have back problems, I recommend bending your knees for the numerous leg-lowering exercises you need to do while on your back.  These exercises also focus on a lot of balance, something that traditional abdominal exercises don't address very often.
If you are a beginner, you are definitely in for a soothing, quick but challenging abdominal workout.  If you are an experienced exerciser, this will be a nice add-on to your routine that may actually get your abs doing a double take.  :)",1044403200,14,1158,5.063157894736842

1215583,5,B00000G3GH,"As a yoga neophyte, who is quickly becoming a GREAT fan of Gaiam products, I really liked this video. The only other ones I have are ""A.M P.M Conditioning for Weight Loss"" with Susan Deason (two-tape set). I said it in my review of those tapes, and I'll say it again: I LOVE the voice-over method. Somehow, when doing yoga (like I said, I'm brand new) I can't STAND someone talking to me throughout. I think the voice-over method is much more effective; it draws you in more, and at least for me, allows greater concentration and depth of connection to what I'm doing.
One of the reviews said this was not enough. They also said they're in pretty good shape and have been doing yoga for awhile. All I can say is, it's right in the title "" . . for Beginners."" Personally, I loved that I could both DO and FEEL this workout. I did as advised, and watched it once through to familiarize myself with it, and was intimidated at that. But actually doing it, I was pleasantly surprised. I could do most of it, and what I can't do, I know I'll soon be able to, with continued practice.
Rodney is a very asthetically pleasing form to behold, which was just a smidge distracting for me, at first (maybe if he had a smidge more costume!), but the setting is gorgeous and serene and you can see exactly what he's describing in his perfect form.

It's well rounded with breathing techniques and relaxation on top of moves to strengthen and tone your abs all in 20 mins... great for doing before bed or first thing in the morning. Rodney Yee's voice is soothing, giving good instruction so you don't have to look at the TV very often, and the photography is so beautiful. I'm a yoga virgin so a lot of moves are quite hard to master, but who said that it would be easy?
If you're looking for something different to do rather than the traditional way, try this video out. The relaxation and breathing techniques are great for reducing stress and let you feel refreshed. Creating a tranquil atmosphere (like candles or soft lighting)whilst doing the tape can help enhance the mood it aims for. Rodney Yee does it, he's in a tranquil place on the video and not in a studio.

Why do more than necessary to get to your goals? I am not crazy about the  advertisements that preceed the program. I think if you pay for a video you should just get what you pay for and not have to sit through ads. But, of course, one can simply fast  forward, which is what I do. I highly recommend this video.

I am always looking for a good ab workout but was not looking for an ""Oprah-remember-my-spirit"" type program (though ironically I became aware of Rodney Yee's tape on the ""Queen Midas'"" daytime talk show). Much to my surprise, this is quite a good and quick workout.  Having done the tape several times a week, I already feel and see improvements in that pesky region of the body.  What I found different (and liked!) about this workout was that I did not have to do seemingly endless and boring repititions of crunches or  feel the proverbial ""burn.""  But no need to worry, if you are anything like me, your ab muscles will definitely tell you that they are being worked out.  I feel a good muscle tension afterwards (and okay sometimes even some mild soreness the next day).
A word of caution for other yoga ""newbies.""  It will take some time to get up to speed moving between and doing the series of  poses.  After a dozen times or so, I think I have got it down -- but admittedly still have a mental block with keeping up with Yee's breathing inhalation/exhalation instructions.  As others have noted, skip the annoying ads in the beginning of the tape.  I simply have queued the tape to the start of the workout and rewind it back to that point each time.
I will probably not be a ""spiritual"" yoga convert (my abs don't feel like the ""deep soft belly of the dunes"" that Yee soothingly tells me each time) but so far I am a fan of this challenging, yet relaxing, program.

Rodney Yee is a soothing presence.  He is a thoughtful guide and I feel in good hands when I use his videos.

The  workout part of the tape is a little under 25 minutes, and part of the tape  is basically ab-focused meditation (but it's not flaky for those who are a  little intimidated by yoga's spiritual side).  The rest is gentle, yet  tough abs work which will be unlike anything you've ever done before.  The  best part is, it works.  Your abs will feel terrific and you will feel  great because you have completed some pretty challenging poses.  For some  reason, I don't know if it's true, I feel that this tape works out ab  muscles that those traditional tapes just don't get to.  Maybe it's because  most of the poses are isometric, but whatever it is, I would recommend this  tape to anyone curious about yoga and interested in toning their abs.",960076800,189,947,4.608433734939759
1215627,4,B00000G3GH,"I have never done yoga before, until I tried this tape.  At first I thought that this is way to easy...how can this work?  Well it does!  I do this tape everyday after my cardio tapes and I love it.  After my first  workout, my abs felt tighter.  I have been doing this now for about two  weeks and I can not only feel, but now I am beginning to see the  difference.
Buy this tape you will not regret it.  It is a great way to  round off your workout, or just to do when you are crunched for time!",959472000,18,497,3.8316831683168315
1215628,5,B00000G3GH,Great yoga tape.  Easy to do but hard enough that its challenging and repetition definitely shows improvement.  I could feel the increased strength in my abs immediately.  My lower back and posture benefited as  well.  Great buy.  Definitely recommend it.,955324800,8,255,5.25
1215629,5,B00000G3GH,"Although I enjoy aerobics and strength training, I have always hated ab exercises.  I just can't stand doing a crunch.  But how I love yoga!  I started doing Rodney Yee's Abs Tape in addition to his AM practice tape.  I  felt so completely relaxed at the end of the tape, but knew I had really  worked my abs.  After a few weeks of this tape a couple of times a week, I  really noticed a big difference in my ab muscles.",951091200,10,420,4.098765432098766
7908897,2,B00000G3GH,Kind of feels like outdated. Like I was watching a yoga vid from the early 90s. Maybe its the speedo Rodney is sporting...I'm not sure. Felt slow moving.,1525737600,,153,4.5
7908898,4,B00000G3GH,"I like Rodney Yee and have several of his DVDs. This one, I think, is a bit too easy. I did have a pleasant feel in the belly after training, blood surculation definitely improved, and that was good, but I think this programm is more like a conditioning for the muscles if I may say so. Not a training. May be good as a part of a recovery process of some kind.",1524441600,,360,4.013888888888889
