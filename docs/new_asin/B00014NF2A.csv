8006544,1,B00014NF2A,The DVD I received in mail only played in black and white . Was very disappointed to say the least .,1502496000,,100,3.8095238095238093
8006545,4,B00014NF2A,It makes a good video for me and my son to watch together. Good for people can't take a Rocky Mountaineer train in person right now.,1290556800,,132,4.115384615384615
8006546,4,B00014NF2A,"This DVD is a must see for those planning on taking this particular train trip.  See it before you go, and you know what to expect.  It shows all the aspects of the train; including dining, entertainment and shows, cocktail lounge, seats, types of cars (go first class!), and a map showing exactly where you'll go.  The trip is narrated over a PA system, helping greatly.  Looks like great staff help who run this trip.  The scenery is a little less quality, and could use some extra color and enhancements, but I think that's because it was snowing so much.  It's hard to capture the views of the mountains in perfect blue sky weather.  Note that you do not stay overnight on the train; instead you stay overnight in a hotel (it's a two day trip), arranged by the train trip company. Websites are given in the DVD so you know where to go to book this trip.  It looks like a fun trip to go on, someday I hope I get the chance.",1193616000,11,926,4.281609195402299

What I had expected to see was a run from Vancouver, BC to Banff though the eyes of a train engineer and to some extent the passengers......  What this DVD gives us is a travelogue from the passenegers point of view ...

The description of the 2 day trip is good but, another downer, this train does not have any sleeper cars so as far as I'm concerned it's a 3 star luxury train consisting of coach class cars (which they really never do show in the DVD) and two dinig rooom / bar cars ....  The tain stops and overnights in Kamloops and all the passengers are bussed to a hotel .... at the hotel we get a view of a cheesy hick town review and I guess what would be considered a 'world class' hotel ... whatever that eans ... They don't show the rooms of any other amenities of the hotel itself ....

Also onec the train arrives in Banff the DVD finished ... can you believe that..... one of the most beautifull and scenic wonders in Canada and these dummies just end the DVD .... I mean even for this being a traelogue it's not good either

The only saving grace are the scenic views that are mostly fimed through the domed top of the two dining cars ....

Last but not least there in not even ONE shot from the engine down the track ... we see the engineer for a few mintes but the cameraman never thought of shooting what the engineer sees as they travel down the rails ... I mean this is the most sought after view of ANY rail enthusiast ....

All in all it's not worth it .. trust me ....",1105228800,28,1580,4.093851132686084
