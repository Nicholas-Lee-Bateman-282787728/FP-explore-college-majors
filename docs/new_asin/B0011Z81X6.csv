8243101,1,B0011Z81X6,"If you are looking for video account of the Yom Kippur War to flesh out historical details of that war, don't bother buying this video.  The account of the war is over simplistic, even sophomoric, and the supporting film shown in the video is poor and confusing.  The movie appears to be made as a morale booster for the people of Israel which is commendable but as for increasing any understanding of that truly remarkable war by the Israelies, don't bother buying  this video.",1480896000,,478,4.666666666666667
8243102,2,B0011Z81X6,"An exercise in denial, this short presents the Yom Kippur war as if it was an extension of the 48 war. It's inaccurate, misleading in its omissions  and openly partial. This selective presentation of facts seems to aim more for boosting the morale of those who do not wish to learn how Israel got itself into its most spectacular intelligence failure, managing to be surprised despite all the warnings and ample information which preempted it.
It also does not touch on the famous ""concept"" which prevailed with the political and military elite In Israel - namely, that the Arabs are incapable of facing the Israeli army in combat, and succeed - at least tactically (with strategic political gains to be followed).
We know what is said about those who refuse to learn from the past...",1442102400,,784,4.807407407407408

8243104,2,B0011Z81X6,Boring. Misses the points of desperation. Like a college lecture. Almost fell asleep. Many other movies that do justice to the heroic stand Israel took to defend its freedom,1396396800,,173,5.0
8243105,4,B0011Z81X6,"After watching New Dimensions other shorts on the major Israeli wars with their Arab neighbors, this is a must see too. This documentary covers the 1973 war with Egypt and Syria as major belligerents against Israel and although Egypt had surprised the Israeli Armed Forces during what was supposed to be ceasefire period and made considerable advances into the East Bank of the Suez Canal in the Sinai Desert, the Israelis again displayed their awesome war-fighting capabilities with superb leadership and training against greatly outnumbered war machines and troops and that the Arab nations in the Middle East are essentially poorly trained, poorly led and even with good Soviet made equipment just cannot stand up to any well trained and well led force.

Israel probably still maintains a moments notice capability to beat their Arab neighbors back.  Please see the other New Dimensions short on these Arab-Israeli wars:  ""The Six Day War""",1375142400,2,942,5.184210526315789
8243106,1,B0011Z81X6,"This dvd of the 1973 Yom Kippur War was poorly organized,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yom-Kippur-War/dp/B0011Z81X6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yom Kippur War</a>and did not get into the facts leading up to the war.  It was in a word ""superficial.""  The video quality was poor.  The picture on the screen was slightly indented on the left side, and looked like it was produced by an amature.  The entire dvd was 27 minutes long. Reading a good book and analysis of the events leading to the war and the events of the war including the U.S  military airlift  to Israel is much more worthwhile.  There is no comparison in quality of  this dvd to previous ones depicting the 1948 war (birth of a nation) and the 1967 War (Six Days In June)  which I highly recommend.",1308441600,2,808,5.25
