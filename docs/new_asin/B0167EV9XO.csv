7456683,5,B0167EV9XO,"I really enjoyed these lecture series.  I am not a professor, or scholar just a housewife but I am a Christian and I enjoyed his view points and facts as well as the evidence that he presented.  This dvd is worth the purchase.",1457568000,10,226,4.232558139534884
7456684,5,B0167EV9XO,"Analysis is easy. Synthesis, however, requires encyclopedic knowledge, a mastery of a myriad of details, and the smarts to make a host of connections. In this case, it also requires the perseverance to challenge established theory. Rohl seems to have them all. If you're a discouraged believer (I know  an oxymoron) because of all the myth-accusations leveled at the Old Testament, or just a history and biography lover, these lectures may be for you. He starts with the Egyptian Sojourn and goes through the United Kingdom, establishing archeological (and astronomical) connections between Israel and surrounding cultures, and revising/correcting the prior Egyptian chronology to boot. I loved the trip, and wish him well in his endeavor..",1447632000,25,740,5.434782608695652
7456685,3,B0167EV9XO,"Professor Rohl is a very interesting lecturer; however, I found that his research was more about proving the Jewish stance on the bible.  His pointing out that the Jews never lived in Goshen is a very remarkable discovery that Jacob and his children were from the Canaanite Empire, which I believe answers a lot of questions.  Consider that Jacob and his children entered into Egypt as Canaanites, which explains why Joseph was able to interpret dreams.  Long after Joseph died the populace considered themselves slaves.

My hypothesis after viewing these lectures is:
This transition from Canaanites to Jews speaks to a spiritual people gone materialistic and doing religious chores like building temple would have seem as if they were slaves where previously they fulfill their obligations in sacred piety. The story of Joshua and his army destroying the Canaanite empire is very similar to how Protestants destroyed much of the Catholic Church during the Reformation period.  The Jews that were once Canaanites (Gentiles) became iconoclastic and rejected the religious teachings of the Canaanite empire just as Protestants rejected Catholicism.",1444780800,4,1147,5.385474860335195

7456694,5,B0167EV9XO,"Excellent lecture series. David Rohl clearly gives archeological evidence and timelines for many events in the Bible. His lectures are detailed and precise, yet thoughtfully presented for the lay person. I would definitely recommend this series for anyone wanting the history and archeology behind biblical events in the Old Testament..",1471132800,6,336,5.74

8735750,5,B0167EV9XO,"I bought these lectures as a followup to the DVD ""Patterns of Evidence""., which I recommend should be bought together.",1527120000,,118,4.95
8735751,5,B0167EV9XO,"This is a wonderful series and puts into perspective how the discoveries of modern-day archaeology are aligning with Biblical narrative.  David Rohl is cut from the classic historians and archaeologists of the 19th and early 20th century. I'm very glad he is handling the findings of his field so honorably and more importantly, honestly.",1524528000,,338,5.2592592592592595
8735752,5,B0167EV9XO,Not much I can write about this unless I take an hour of your time. David Rohl's Lectures is a mind blowing adventure into Biblical history and archaeology. It is a series one can watch again and again and still pick up facts or pointers you missed before. Absolutely brilliant DON'T MISS IT!!,1518652800,,293,4.547169811320755
8735753,5,B0167EV9XO,"I found these lectures to be thorough & logical in both thought and content.  The evidence presented in them is quite compelling and proves to my satisfaction that we have every reason to believe that the events of the OT actually took place exactly as described, and that they represent real events in history - just as one should expect, if the Bible is indeed ""God's True Word"".  David Rohl's so-called New Chronology also reconciles many, many issues with the events & archaeology for the history of the ancient world, as well.  Finally, I would also like to recommend his book on the Exodus and another similar DvD Set on this topic entitled ""Patterns of Evidence"".",1517875200,,670,4.758620689655173
8735754,5,B0167EV9XO,"Brilliant absolutely fascinating, such research and put out in a clear and concise way. What exciting lectures, I will watch over and again. Thank you David Rohl",1513555200,,161,5.0

8735758,5,B0167EV9XO,"I purchased this lecture series after watching ""Patterns of Evidence: Exodus"". David was one of the featured interviewees for that documentary, and he is the proponent of a new chronology of Egyptian history that purports to answer many of the existing conflicts between modern archaeology and the Bible.

The lecture series is well done. It covers the time from the Israelites' slavery in Egypt through to the Monarchy Period of David and Solomon. I found myself mesmerized by David's take on Jewish/Egyptian history. He addresses the dilemma that arose through the equation of the Biblical Shishak (the Pharaoh shortly after Solomon's reign) and the Egyptian Shoshenk I. This equation is the foundation for modern Egyptology's chronology of Biblical events, and Mr. Rohl's explanations provide an alternate perspective on who this important Pharaoh was, as well as how that impacts the prevailing understanding of Egyptian history.

Dr. Rohl does not merely wax hypothetical in this series, he offers a multitude of evidences for his theory. While many have challenged the theory, especially among the establishment of Egyptologists and archaeologists, he has done a fine job of rebutting their arguments against his re-dating of Egyptian chronology.

The lecture series is a bit technical, and in that sense, the presentation can be dry, but it is detailed, very well-explained, and lacks the bias that one would expect from someone with a vested interest in the subject (Dr. Rohl is neither a Jewish man or a Christian, and in my view is less likely to suffer from confirmation bias as a result). The series is done in an intimate setting, with maybe 30 or so attendees and it includes some Q&A sessions between Dr. Rohl and the attendees after each presenting segment.

I would recommend the lecture series to anyone interested in ancient Egypt, ancient Israel, Biblical Archaeology, or the Bible in general. I would also recommend picking up a copy of his book ""Pharaohs and Kings: A Biblical Quest"" on Amazon as well!",1503446400,,2024,5.124242424242424
