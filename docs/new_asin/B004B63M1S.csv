4313387,5,B004B63M1S,"And none of the action is phoned in either. Machete starts off with a bang, or a slice. Dispatching more drug lord henchmen than most movies have.

Machete is ripped from the headlines plot featuring illegal immigration over the U.S. Mexican border. Machete (Danny Trejo) is a former Mexican Federale whose family has been killed by drug lord Torrez (Steven Seagal). Machete is in the U.S. as an illegal day laborer who is hired to kill an unprincipled state Senator (Robert DeNiro) trying to make a name for himself. Machete discovers that he's been set up by Booth (Jeff Fahey) who is playing both sides of the immigration issue. As Machete careens from one side to another falls in with Jessica Alba as an ICE agent, and Michelle Rodriguez as a leader of a Mexican underground railroad. But don't let the issue fool you. It's there just to set all the characters in motion and there's no ""hidden"" message or agenda to either side of the argument. Characters on both sides are creepy and don't even manage to do the right thing for the wrong reason.

All the performances are matched for the actor. There is no great range or nuance to the characters but there doesn't need to be. All the action is over the top and all the characters have to do is deliver, and deliver they do. Danny Trejo as Machete, the always stoic hero who never flinches when faced with gun, sword, bomb, or girl. Steven Seagal's usual one note performance and shoe polish hairline are still visible, but it's the right note for the character. Don Johnson as a vigilante, killing people crossing the border is a combination of Marlon Brando and Robert Duvall's characters from Apocalypse Now. DeNiro's character is the only one I thought a little subdued and I thought there would be more to the character. But DeNiro is a smart enough actor to be able to match his performance to the material. Jessica Alba as ICE agent Sartana, able to fight and make arrests in the highest of heels.

Robert Rodriquez turns in another of his hands on productions. Rodriguez did everything from writing and directing the movie, to editing, to the soundtrack. It's clear that Rodriguez has studied the exploitation genre. He has the camera movements down, the jump cuts, he acknowledges and uses every clich, but they're used smartly and some times have a little snap or twist on them. Such as in a show of trust when Machete turns over a gun to Jessica Alba's ICE agent but she knows he took the clip out. Rodriguez's tongue is planted firmly in his cheek. The violence is beyond cartoonish and frequently delivered with a humorous twist. It's also good to see a filmmaker willing to bring nudity back into a movie, and not the Kathy Bates type of nudity. In one topless scene with Lindsay Lohan I think we can all say `all is forgiven Lindsay.'

Machete is a popcorn munching good time!",1283472000,7,2847,4.642857142857143
4313388,4,B004B63M1S,"Awaiting with great anticipation with RR since he last released Grindhouse in 2007. You could say I was more than excited to see Rodriguez reteam with regular Danny Trejo in Machete. I was surprised to see little turn out at the theater I was at. Machete is a former Mexican Federale who, after a tragic incident, is forced to become a day laborer in the U.S.. He is set up and left for dead. However, he is now caught between one of the most potent topics in the States today and revenge against those who caused his loss in the past. Action film junkies will get what they bargained for along with some of the best cheesy dialogue to come around since the Death Wish films. The only complaints I had were that you could see the ending a mile off. I wished they could of developed Machete's character more instead of giving him one liners. And I wish some of the villains had better death scenes. Other than that it was a pretty good action flik. Be warned though, it's not for young kids.",1283472000,2,990,4.356756756756757
4313389,5,B004B63M1S,"I can't think of a harder working or more deserving character actor/producer that deserves his time in the lead spotlight - think of the cool, amazing and memorable roles that Trejo has had from Heat to Con Air to From Dusk Til Dawn. Gotta love his humble sense of humour on the movie set too:

De Niro - ""Hey Danny, haven't seen you since we did Heat, glad to see that you finally got your first starring role"".

Trejo - ""Mr. De Niro, go and get me a cup a coffee""..... F***ING PRICELESS!

Hats off to Rodriguez for staying loyal to one of the good guys/Trejo and not letting Hollywood or the critics mess with the magic. Hope to see RR filming in Detroit one day...while Michigan still has its 40% film rebate. I can't wait to see Machete this Friday! Viva Danny Trejo!!!!

4313390,4,B004B63M1S,"""This guy should be like the Mexican Jean-Claude Van Damme or Charles Bronson""

This quote from Robert Rodriguez pretty much sums up exactly what you can expect from Machete. A cheesy action flick filled with brutal fights, senseless (but fun) violence, copious amounts of nudity, and some classic one-liners. Needless to say, I was pretty excited for it, even more so being a fan of Robert Rodriguez. I was able to see a sneak preview of Machete last night (8/31/2010) courtesy of my friend and I had a damn good time.

First, a little bit of background. Machete was an idea Rodriguez had all the way back in 1993, but he never got around to making it. Once he and Tarantino made&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grindhouse/dp/B003VMFWYI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grindhouse</a>&nbsp;(one of my all-time favorites), he included it as one of the fake trailers. Now it's 2010 and he finally got to make the movie after 17 years, but not before creating some of the coolest characters to ever grace the screen (El Mariachi,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seth-Gecko/dp/B00004RJ74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seth Gecko</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marv/dp/B000BCKFWK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marv</a>, El Wray, etc). I'm a big fan of Rodriguez's work and he's only let me down once, with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Once-Upon-A-Time-In-Mexico/dp/B0000WN140/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Once Upon A Time In Mexico</a>, but that's a story for another day.

The story is something any self-respecting action fan will recognize instantly: a man is given a dangerous job to do, he gets double crossed, and he seeks bloody revenge. We've seen this dozens of times, but it doesn't feel stale here. The main reason for this is the break-neck pace of the film. The runtime is about 1 hour, 45 minutes but it flies by in what feels like an hour. An interesting pseudo-commentary is present in the film, concerning illegal immigration. I'm sure some people out there will take the movie way too seriously and try to over-analyze it, but the fact is it's all done tongue-in-cheek and should not effect your enjoyment of the film.

Onto the cast, which like a lot of Rodriguez's films, is outstanding. Danny Trejo plays the same role he's been playing for 20 years, but this is exactly what he does best. He handles what little dialogue he has just fine, also delivering a few hilarious one-liners that I won't spoil here. Jeff Fahey is deviously cool as the guy who hires and then double-crosses Machete. Jessica Alba feels a bit out of place, but does a decent job and looks good doing it. Robert De Niro is delightfully cheesy as the big shot senator who is anti-immigration. It's quite fun to see one of the greatest actors of all-time just goofing around with a ridiculous role. Steven Seagal serves as more of a secondary antagonist, but he has a few good parts, especially in the finale. Rounding out the rest of the cast is Michelle Rodriguez, Cheech Marin, Don Johnson, Lindsay Lohan and Tom Savini. Cheech plays a good supporting role as Machete's priest brother, while Johnson chews the scenery as a vicious border patrol officer. Sadly, Savini isn't in the film enough. Amusingly, Lohan plays what feels like a caricature of herself, which some will find hilarious and others will find pointless. All in all, the cast does a good job.

The action and special effects are surprisingly good. While I love Robert Rodriguez's films, I do feel he isn't the best action director, save for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Desperado/dp/B0000A2ZU1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Desperado</a>. He doesn't really give you time to savor the destruction and mayhem that occurs. With the help of co-director Ethan Maniquis, Machete's action scenes are exciting and very violent, with limbs and heads getting chopped off, people being impaled, and plenty of other gruesomely awesome acts. There's a scene in a hospital that I know people will be talking about for years to come.

The film does have a few weak points, mainly concerning the ending. Like Desperado, the best action scenes occur midway through the film, making the finale a bit of a letdown because it just can't live up to the excitement of the earlier scenes . Much of this is forgivable due to the short but memorable scenes that pop up in every Rodriguez film and have a style all their own.

So bottom line, Machete is an satisfyingly bloody good time with a few memorable scenes and a great sense of humor. If you like a good action flick and just want to enjoy yourself, I'd give Machete a watch.",1283299200,4,4767,5.433783783783784

trailer and it looked awesome.  We start with Machete in Mexico and what
befalls him there (I'm not going to spoil it) causes him to go to Texas and
work odd jobs three years later.  Then someone hides him to kill a senator,
who wants to deport illegals.  But there is something bigger afoot. . .

Pros:  A lot of fighting; Women kicking some butt.  Machete kicking butt.
DeNiro is hilarious and so is Don Johnson.  Cheech Marin!  The ending of
the movie!

Cons:  the fighting and killing factor gets old after awhile.

And it has gun fights, people getting killed with an awesome machete, and Danny Trejo hooking up with chicks and fighting the evils of corrupt elected officials!  And another great part of the movie is that it has Michelle Rodriguez in it as an underground freedom fighter.  And she is awesome in that role!

4313549,4,B004B63M1S,"The action is fun, and the characters are compelling. The only flaw of this movie is its confused mood.

ACTION:

It's bloody, and at times gory, but without ever being too disgusting. (This from a person who can barely stomach watching gore.) It's deliberately phony, with severed heads that are obviously rubber, and bloodless disembowelment. Don't expect the battles to be realistic; this movie is set in a universe where humans can be cleanly decapitated with a sword, like cutting through butter; where intestines can unravel like a garden hose (stupid in most movies, but acceptable in this silliness), and where being shot through the eye is a mere inconvenience.

CHARACTERS:

In a movie this tongue-in-cheek, you shouldn't expect characters to be too deep or realistic. But they're still fun to get to know. The movie doesn't just rely only on its all-star cast to carry its story; the writers were sure to make each character unique and interesting, with the familiar actors who play them only being an added bonus.

Danny Trejo's Machete has the clichd back-story of the dead wife and daughter, but his persona is unique enough to still make the character stand out. Michelle Rodriguez steals the show as a female Che (named ""the She""). Jessica Alba gives us a conflicted Hispanic cop, tasked with deporting her ""brothers and sisters."" Shea Whigham, who played the worst character on ""Boardwalk Empire"" (Eli), is far better in this movie, as a disgruntled henchman. (His character gets a satisfyingly corny death, that I would have been much happier to see his ""Boardwalk Empire"" character receive. But oh well.) Then there's Robert De Niro as the corrupt Southern senator; Lindsay Lohan as the spoiled, drug-addicted daughter of one of the villains; and many others who I'm forgetting.

SEX APPEAL:

There isn't much of it for a female viewer (unless you're a lesbian). But there's plenty there for men (unless you're gay). Jessica Alba is as pretty as always, and Michelle Rodriguez is sizzling. The amount of young, sexy women who throw themselves at Machete may be off-putting, until you remember the nature of this movie, and that his character is a parody of the action-hero Gary Stu.

CONFUSED TONE:

This is the one flaw of the movie, which I mentioned before. The movie's tone teeters between a goofy action/comedy, and a grim, serious tale about struggling illegal immigrants. Some believe the immigration aspect of the movie to be a parody of Hollywood movies with political agendas; but parody or not, it shows the immigration issue from the sad, if exaggerated, perspective of struggling illegal immigrants. (Being regarded like a ""national problem"" rather than individuals with families and personal hardships). The serious undertones clash with the rest of this otherwise wacky movie.

VERDICT:

This is a great action movie, but the sequel is better. And you don't need to see this movie to understand the plot of the sequel.",1418342400,,2952,5.028688524590164

4313555,3,B004B63M1S,"First truly starring role for legendary action movie sideman Danny Trejo explodes across the screen with a sensationally hyper-violent (and briefly sexy) opening, which makes promises that it does and does not keep throughout the rest of its rather inflated running time (and I'm usually a reviewer who complains about the abundance of deleted scenes in these products!). Rodriguez is working with a stellar fun line-up of a cast (there's Seagal--whom I actually enjoy watching in movies--the smoking Jessica Alba, the uncredited Rose McGowan, a very funny Don Johnson, and a great turn by DeNiro who seems to be enjoying his satirically edgy material in the script) and he has an unusual command of the cinema medium as a director who is acutely aware of how cinematography works on the theatrical screen...but the material, while both self-aware and satirical (in its immigration reform plot), is too much a victim of hyper-violent, quasi-video game influenced editing and absurdly unreliable pacing. Far from the days of the more subdued ""El Mariachi"" (and even the sex-is-violence-violence-is-sexy style of 1996's ""Desperado""), Rodriguez appears to be off the hinges in this one, abandoning good sense for injections of splatter-porn style scenes that either work or simply falter; oh it's entertaining as all hell in places (with interruptions of nudity, swearing, and an even a gut-ripping scene that will make your stomach go whoops) but not enough to sustain its misguided plotting and rambunctious sensibility. It can be fun in its ultra-violence, and one needs to understand how violence in pictures like this is meant to be taken (it's pure fantasy, it's not meant to appeal to those who are truly anti-social), because it's intentionally over the top for a reason and I get this...but great exploitation films can be more--and less, at the same time. Rodriguez and Tarantino are the architects of post-post-modern retro drive-in theater exploitation cinema homage, and I am now a fan of the hyper-sexy and hyper-violent ""Death Proof"" with Kurt Russell, but sometimes too much can be made out of a good thing. This movie is really about violence, and if you aren't a fan of movie violence, then don't bother...but I also have to quibble about the cuts in the violence this time. Rumor has it that Rodriguez is going to release an even more violent cut of this film on upgraded Blu-Ray soon so why do this for marketing purposes, seriously? Simply put an unrated label on the original print! If there are more deleted scenes that need to be put back in that's fine, but why release two separate copies with one containing extended violence and gore? If Rodriguez would have slowed the pacing of the action scenes down I might have enjoyed this more, but as such it's an entertaining effort but not an absolute essential to me. By the way, the deleted scenes that are included here are inconclusive but fun to see once, offering nothing terribly revealing other than the ""Twins"" angle which seems to have been cut from the plot of the theatrical release entirely. The saga of tracking down completed prints of movies on digital media continues...C+",1416441600,,3157,5.026717557251908

4313567,4,B004B63M1S,"Going in you have to realize what Robert Rodriguez is going for here.  If you enter the world of Machete with a serious attitude, you will completely hate everything about this movie.  But that's not what its intention is.  Tongue-in-cheek ultra violence, jokes, and over-the-top action.  Hilarious.  Great ensemble cast with Danny Trejo as the indomitable Machete, Robert De Niro, Jessica Alba, Michelle Rodriguez, Linsay Lohan, Cheech marin and Steven Segal.  Machete is a Mexican super cop and when he's captured in a set up by Drug Lord Rogelio Torrrez (Segal) his wife is murdered in front of him and he is left for dead.  Three years later, Machete inhabits a down-and-out lifestyle in Texas, scraping by on yardwork jobs. He is corralled by Michael Booth (Jeff Fahey) and taken to a location where Booth gives him $150,000 to off corrupt Texas Senator John McLaughlin (De Niro) for being a general douche and other unsavory acts pointed at illegal Mexican immigrant.  Machete accepts the task after being threatened.  It's a set up.  The Senator gets shot, but not fatally, by one of his own henchman, who shoots Machete first in the should before wounding the Senator in the leg.  The melee ensues and everyone is howling for Machete's blood and the Senator is now a martyr.
The plot doesn't really matter here.  But it's pretty solid. What matters is the no-nonsense Machete going on a killing spree with the help from a few friends and his brother (Marin) who's a catholic priest.  Let the mayhem begin.  It's a clever, hilarious romp along the lines of Once Upon A Time In Mexico and its ilk.  Entertainment for the sake of entertainment.  No hidden agenda.  No grandiose analogies.  Guns blazing and one-liners flying and machetes slashing.  Enjoyable.  Just be in the right frame of mind.  For those of us who can't seem to see the humor in a movie like this, steer clear, it's just going to irritate you and those watching it with you.

4313656,1,B004B63M1S,"I've never been a fan of Robert Rodriguez, and I am not sure his fanbase are aware of the amateurish nature of virtually everything he has made. In the nearly 20 years he has been making movies he's never graduated to being a serious filmmaker. His pal Tarantino is lights years ahead of him.

This piece of crap movie was born out of the fake trailer between the movies of full ""Grindhouse"" experience a few years back. Remember that notorious bomb that nearly crippled Harvey Weinstein? Only the movie isn't really Grindhouse. The fake dirt and scratches laid over the opening scene disappear after the credits, and it looks like any old generic TV show for the most part with bland photography. If it kept up the dirt and scratches aesthetic, however fake, I would have respected it just a tiny little bit more.

It's not a Grindhouse film, it doesn't have the balls to be. It's just a cheap, amateurish killing spree with lots of fake, CGI blood and boring characters. I assume Rodriguez has dirt or incriminating Polaroid's on absolutely every member of the cast as I can't think of any reason why anyone would willfully agree to be in this abortion. I wouldn't have this garbage listed on my filmography. I wouldn't even want it listed on my toilet paper.

Don't get me wrong, I like Danny Trejo and I LOVE Michelle Rodriguez, but this film was so bad that upon watching it a second time I actually found myself reading a factual book halfway through as it was rotting my brain that much.

It's an angry 15-year-old's wet dream. It's one of the worst films I have seen in my life. I feel ashamed for watching it once. I feel like opening up my wrists for watching it twice. I don't want this Blu-ray in my house anymore.

The movie is presented in 1.85:1 1080p which shows of the hackwork ""cinematography"" in all its blandness, with a loud, childish DTS HD-MA soundtrack. There are extras, but I'd rather swallow my own tongue than suffer any of them.",1381622400,3,1957,4.564102564102564

When the bad guys begin to close in on him, he spots a tray full of surgical instruments--just as the attending physicians caution him that these mean-looking scalpels and cleavers are terribly sharp and dangerous!  Needless to say, Machete makes imaginative use of these tools in carving up the bad guys!",1376784000,,604,4.892156862745098
4313682,1,B004B63M1S,"Machete is a pretentious political drama disguised as a fun action movie.  This film was set up to be a fun revenge movie like Deathwish.  However, it soon becomes a pretentious commentary about the border.  Those two things do not really fit together.  Those things would be fine in separate films, but together they create a cluttered mess of a film which is what we have here.  I thought that it was unneeded and it made the film very boring for me.

The plot is too crowded.  All of the marketing for this film made it out to be a balls-to-the-walls actions movie.  However, it's like the makers of the film saw all of the issues about the border that were really big at that time and decided to work it into the story.  As I said earlier that is a bad move on their part.  I would be fine with a story dealing with the Mexican border if it does not detract from the action and Machete himself, which is what happened.  The film should have focused more on Machete and him getting revenge and the stuff about the border should have been in the background.  Instead the revenge story is mostly an afterthought.  It tries to be both a smart commentary about the border and a corny action movie at the same time, and it really does not manage either.  You have much political dialogue in a lot of scenes trying to make you take it seriously, while you also have over-the-top scenes Machete using a guy's intestines to onto another floor of a building.  That does not work.

The characters are not that great either.  The main character Machete (Danny Trejo) is actually an entertaining character.  If this film was a straightforward action movie he'd be fine.  The problem is we do not spend as much time with him as we should and his priorities seem out-of-whack to me.  The supposed main villain, Torrez (Steven Seagal), killed his wife at the beginning of the film.  Instead of going after Torrez to get his revenge he is just wandering around Mexico looking for work.  I think that this is there so they can introduce the boarder issue.  I think that a lot of potential characterization for Machete is lost because of too much political dialogue getting in the way.  If the movie was not concentrating so much on the border and hammering home a message we could have had more time with Machete and him getting revenge like he should be doing.

The other characters are not much either.  Jessica Alba plays a border patrol officer, which immediately lost me.  I do not buy her as an officer for one second.  Michelle Rodriguez is alright but she is not in the movie that much.  Jeff Fahey does the best job here in my opinion.  I am a fan of Jeff Fahey from when he appeared in Lost.

Steven Seagal got it the worst.  He was setup in the beginning to be the main bad guy of the film.  However, after the beginning we only see him on a computer screen.  Then at the end he appears out of nowhere to fight Machete to wrap up his arc.  The fight was very lackluster.  Machete does not even kill him.  He kills himself for some reason.  The whole ending was pretty lame to be honest.

There is some good about the film.  The film looks nice.  The effects look decent besides some scenes with obvious CGI blood.  The action scenes were okay (besides the ending), but there were not that many of them.

Overall, this was a very lame revenge flick.  All the marketing said it was a revenge/action movie.  Instead we got a lame commentary about the border, which does not interest me at all.  I would skip this one if you are thinking of seeing it.",1376265600,3,3544,4.3996913580246915

4313685,3,B004B63M1S,"I usually don't watch the Over The Top (OTT) and totally unrealistic action movies for that reason and the simple fact that they usually don't have well written stories. I have grown quite fond of Rodriguez's works like Dusk till Dawn and Desperdo. So I gave Machete a try and was not disappointed and was glad to see him take on the immigration issue with this story. This was kind of a tongue and check approach to the hot button issue with the somewhat (I say somewhat because some politicians act this way) over dramatic roles from De Niro (Sen. McLaughlin) and Johnson (V. Jackson) as TUFF AMERICANS AGAINST illegals. This while they are being bankrolled by a drug cartel for campaign funds and toll money for crossing his land with drugs and illegals. With our political climate in the shape its in it's not hard to make the transition. The action is good and over blown with larger than fantasy characters that are either dirty and corrupt or righteous and ready to take action. The acting is good for what they're roles are and as nut jobs they do a good job. I loved seeing Trejo getting the hot girls and the Mac 10 sub machine gunning girls (reminds me of videos you can buy) sweeping the parking lot at the end where the two sides collide. Danny prefers his Machete to more comventional weapons for his fights, but he doesn't mind a mini gun mounted on his hog to clear cagers (cars) or bad guys out of his way. All in all a fun watcch even though it does deal with a very important issue that needs to get taken care of for everyones sake. You can't go wrong here with pretty girls, guns, action, humor, gore and with a story to tell. 3.7 stars.

4313693,5,B004B63M1S,"First a little background: In 2007, a couple of audacious film writers, Quentin Tarantino (""Pulp Fiction"") and Robert Rodriguez (""Sin City""), wrote two feature-length horror films linked by fake trailers, all three presented as ""Grindhouse."" Fanboys went NUTS! Plus they started begging for one of the spoofs featured in the trailers!

Thus was ""Machete"" born.

This blood-splattered (but humor-laced) potboiler illustrates the far-reaching tentacles of the drug cartels south of the border and the political chicanery to the north. Our story centers on one muy feo hombre whose weapon of choice is...you guessed it...a machete; all that blowie uppie stuff is for sissies! He is a former Mexican Federale who is now an illegal alien, just trying to get work as a laborer.

  * Former real-life felon Danny Trejo (""Dark Games"") plays our very ugly fellow, a tragedy-scarred loner, a man of few words who prefers low-tech weaponry.
  * Former action star Steven Seagal (TV's ""Southern Justice"") is the brutal jefe honcho of the Mexican cartel.
  * Former tabloid queen Lindsay Lohan (""Mean Girls"") is the messed-up daughter of a political functionary.
  * Former marijuana front man Cheech Marin (""The Perfect Game"") is Machete's brother turned priest.
  * Former heartthrob Don Johnson (""When in Rome"") is a lawman, a stogie-smokin' Good Ol' Boy.
  * Jeff Fahey (LOTS of TV) brings plenty of blue-eyed charm to his role as a political strategist.
  * Robert De Niro (""Meet the Fockers"") is a racist state senator running for reelection on an anti-immigrant platform.
  * Jessica Alba (""Little Fockers"") wears spike heels as a hard-working DEA agent! (Her hair looks sooo clean.)
  * Michelle Rodriguez (""Avatar"") runs a taco stand out of a van. She darn near steals the show.

By the way, those two females pass the Bechdel Test, i.e., their characters have names and their conversations are NOT about a man, but instead about the problems of immigration and corrupt governments.

If you took parts of Itchy & Scratchy, GTA San Andreas, Blaxploitation movies of the 70s, and bad porn, and then had it stirred up, dipped in batter, and deep fried by Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez's unholy spawn, you get this stupidly perfect movie.

Some of the scenes in this insane grindhouse fest will have you pause, rewind, re-watch, and repeat: they are that freaking over-the-top. There were at least a half dozen literal jaw-dropping, eye-bulging, WOW moments. I wish I could share some of the great moments but they have to be witnessed in stunned amazement as I did, without any preparation.

Now let's get this straight; this movie has almost no genuine redeeming cinematic qualities. The plot is ridiculous, the script inane, there is no semblance of reality, and there is a moronically heavy handed pro-illegal immigrant message.  However, there is a reason this movie boasts big names and I'm pretty sure it wasn't for the paycheck or the chance to get an Oscar. It's because this is pure artery-clogging joy. If you feel the need to critique this movie you probably also look for the sanitary qualities of a truck taco. I don't know about you, but some of the best food I've ever eaten came from a truck. I can't sum it up any better than that.",1342051200,13,1296,4.700440528634362
4313743,3,B004B63M1S,"It's wildly exaggerated. It's supremely ridiculous. It spoofs its message. Huzzah! It's the action-packed motion picture, MACHETE, that you aren't supposed to take too seriously. It fulfills the promise raised in one of the faux trailers from the 2007 theater release of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez's double-billed GRINDHOUSE. A slew of big name actors graces this exercise in pseudo-exploitation cinema, but towering above them all is Danny Trejo as the brutish, laconic Machete Cortez, that vengeful ex-Federale. Trejo's face is so weathered it resembles a page out of a Thomas Guide. And yet he is somehow a chick magnet, if you buy into the film. No less than two hotties - Michelle Rodriguez and Jessica Alba - throw themselves at him.

When one sets foot on the vengeance trail, it's best to have a huge friggin' machete to wave around menacingly. Machete Cortez is an old school sort of hombre stalking a modern world. His impractical tool of choice is the machete, even though he frequently has access to less primitive weaponry. But he's very good with his namesake blade. He cuts a friggin' swath.

For shucks and giggles Robert Rodriguez, early on, inserts grainy footage to emulate those trashy old 1970s flicks. This alerts us that there'll be plenty of tongue-in-cheek shenanigans going down. The plot, such as it is, concerns the hot button topic of illegal immigration. Robert DeNiro, who's stooping to everyone's level now, plays conniving senator John McLaughlin, an aw-shucks, unctuous and drawly gent who is up for re-election. He's standing fast with his platform of proudly crapping on illegal immigrants. Scorning the even playing field, he hatches a fiendish scheme to garner him even more votes.

Three years after the murders of his wife and daughter, Machete Cortez has snuck across the border, assisted by an underground network. Today, disenchanted and without purpose, the ex-Federale struggles as a day laborer. And then, because misfortune is a cruel b! tch, Machete gets framed for an assassination attempt on Senator McLaughlin. Now a man on the run, can Machete Cortez muster up his dusty skills as a buttkicking investigator? More importantly, can he score a machete somewhere?

Let me reiterate, MACHETE is not meant to be taken seriously. Not when Lindsey Lohan's sporting a nun's habit and Michelle Rodriguez is running a taco truck and Jessica Alba is supposed to be a tough-as-nails immigration officer. And certainly not when Steven Seagal is playing a ruthless, sword-wielding Mexican drug lord. And when Machete gets on the loose, the coordinator of the frame job places a call to 1-800-HITMAN. I won't even mention those scantily clad nurses toting automatic weapons.

Rodriquez cheerfully constructs a mythology around Machete. He's got him plonked in the center of a brewing revolution. His past exploits are already legendary. It doesn't hurt Machete's street creds any that, in one jaw-dropping sequence, he... let's just say he tests a goon's intestinal fortitude. To quote one villain, Machete ""looks like CIA, FBI, DEA, all rolled into one mean f------ burrito.""

Performance-wise, the cast doesn't exactly cover itself in glory but I don't think it embarrasses itself, either. Besides, these characters are across-the-board over-the-top, which then gives us license to sit back and be more forgiving. Danny Trejo plays Machete just right, as a silent and implacable and sort of mysterious man of action. The humor is overt, perhaps to the detriment of narrative cohesion. But I really liked the riff on how everyone automatically admits a Mexican into their homes, providing he shows up with gardening tools. And Rodriguez's good luck charm and staple, Cheech Marin, is always worth a watch. MACHETE is a wild nudge in the ribs. It is packed with outrageous mayhem and cartoon violence. It even takes a semi-serious stab at a relevant issue, or relevant at least here on the left coast. And maybe on the U.S./Canadian border. I hear the Mounties are cracking down hard on any Yank trying to sneak across their border. Those health care benefits are so damn seductive.

I guess MACHETE earned enough good will, because a sequel, MACHETE KILLS, has been greenlit and is already shooting. It looks to feature Mel Gibson, Charlie Sheen, and a reprising Michelle Rodriquez. There's a rumor circulating that Tony Jaa may even be in it, if he's done being a hermit in the woods. There's an eye towards a 2013 release. I'd Facebook Danny Trejo for confirmation, except we already know that ""Machete don't text.""

The DVD's bonus stuff:

- Watch MATCHETE with the Audience Reaction Track
- 2 MACHETE theatrical trailers",1340496000,11,4780,5.1179487179487175
4313744,3,B004B63M1S,"Based on a character in a fake trailer in ""Grindhouse,"" ""Machete"" is essentially one short movie expanded into a feature-length action. Danny Trejo plays a former Mexican Federale hired to assassinate a US senator played by Robert De Niro. Machete is a man of few words, deadly with weapons, and he is also a lady's man. This is the prolific actor's first leading role, and though the film is flawed, Danny Trejo is perfect as the vigilante hero.

Part homage to exploitation movies, ""Machete"" is one-joke sketch turned into a 105 minute film. While the thin storyline is the film's obvious weakness, its strength lies in the cast including Jessica Alba, Jeff Fahey, Don Johnson, Lindsay Lohan, Cheech Marin, Michelle Rodriguez and Steven Seagal. With a cast of mostly B-list actors (and former A-listers), violent and sexy ""Machete"" certainly makes it point in its ultra-gory pre-credit 15 minutes, which is the best (or to some, worst) part of the film.

But like most Robert Rodriguez films ""Machete"" tends to be slack and even dull when it forgets what it sets out to do. We know this is entertainment and we shouldn't take the film seriously, but some actors seem not to see things that way. The subplots about ""Sh"" and Alba's agent (with her not-so-convincing speech) only slow down the film. The confusing climax with so many characters shooting each other is a letdown. The filmmakers need better action choreography.

4313746,4,B004B63M1S,"I'm going to side with the Amazon review written by Paul Gaita. He pretty much nailed all of the key points on this one.

The reasons you might want to watch this are:

1). Robert Rodriguez. It's reasonably consistent with his other work, maybe better, maybe worse, but if you've enjoyed his other films, there's no reason why you wouldn't enjoy this one.

2). The ""Nash Bridges"" reunion no one requested. Don Johnson & Cheech Marin, co-stars of what was possibly one of the worst TV series of all time, are together on the same screen again. You knew Cheech would be here...Don was the curve ball.

3). Steven Seagal! Playing a bad guy! A really really BAD bad guy! You're probably no longer reading my review at this point because Seagal's appearance in this film has enticed you into clicking the ""buy"" button.

4). Danny Trejo. If I have to tell you who Danny is, you're considering the wrong purchase. Having him in the lead role is a major draw. Having him in the lead role in a Robert Rodriguez film is like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. You may not like it, but a million or so people will mercilessly ridicule you for feeling that way.

5). Jessica Alba. Is the bad acting simply bad acting or part of the overall joke? She's gorgeous here...as always...but the acting?

6). Lindsay Lohan as a semi-automatic weapon-toting woman in a nun's outfit. Err...huh?

7). Robert DeNiro? See ""Jessica Alba"" above.

As Steven Seagal said in the film, ""Back the **** up and WATCH.""

Every white character is a violent oppressor; every hispanic character is a helpless victim.

I have no idea why DeNiro would attach himself to this slanderous project, nor Jessica Alba. Lohan probably took what she could get. One tries to be open-minded about the theme, but having DeNiro's character shoot down a pregnant illegal like he's poaching a buck can only be viewed as white hating.

that being said, the action is over the top and the filming itself is odd. at times giving the gritty feel of an older seventies flick, other times it looks more modern.
on the plus side, trejo kicks ass, always has. lots of action and t 'n' a gave it an extra star, cause i am a guy. and over the top is still fun...

bottom line, though, the message in this movie is pretty heavy handed and because so it loses its validity as a real social comment. i blame mostly the deniro and johnson chacters for that part.  lindsey lohan was doing anybody any favors either, 'til she got naked, even then....eh...

4313761,2,B004B63M1S,"Okay. This movie could had been a great movie, but what happened was there were too many big name stars than it actual needed. The stars in the movie were Danny Trejo, Steven Seagal, Robert De Niro, Michelle Rodriguez, Jessica Alba, and Lindsay Lohan. They should had just had either Seagal or De Niro for the villain. They should had Michelle Rodriguez or Jessica Alba. Lindsay Lohan as the drug addicted daughter in the movie they didn't actually needed. They could had just had the mom be a addict if needed, but that whole part wasn't needed in the first place.

If they could had did a better planning and editing in this movie, this movie could had been so great. As of now, it is just a if-if movie. But enough about what could had been, this was how the movie was. I thought Trejo played a great Machete. He was a great hero and acted his part well. Seagal acting wasn't as good as Trejo. He didn't play the villain as well. He seemed too cocky and overplayed his role. De Niro was a better villain than Seagal and should had been the main villain without Seagal as a partner. Rodriguez played a great hero role in the movie and was the best actor in the whole movie. Alba was okay, but was just eye candy in the movie. She shouldn't had been in the movie because she seemed misplaced in this movie and wasn't a good actor. Lohan was another eye candy actress in the movie. She too wasn't needed or her role.

4313763,4,B004B63M1S,"""Machete"" is one of the first entries of Hollywood's ""supergroup cinema"" trend, mixing lead performers from different rungs of the cinematic ladder in a bombastic vehicle that would've been unthinkable to produce in preceding decades. It also continues the fad of retrofitting modern action movies with exploitation twists in emulation of grandhouse features. In both arenas, ""Machete"" succeeds remarkably, making it one of the more enjoyable features of 2010.

The story: Three years after the murder of his family at the hands of a ruthless drug lord (Steven Seagal,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Exit-Wounds/dp/B00003CXW4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Exit Wounds</a>), ex-Federale ""Machete"" Cortez (Danny Trejo,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Once-Upon-a-Time-in-Mexico/dp/B0000WN140/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Once Upon a Time in Mexico</a>) becomes a wild card in a shady conflict involving the attempted assassination of a Texas Senator (Robert De Niro,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/GoodFellas/dp/0790729725/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">GoodFellas</a>), an underground immigrant aide network run by a tough beauty (Michelle Rodriguez,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Avatar/dp/B002VPE1AW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Avatar</a>), and a plot to exploit both to dark ends.

The cast is the first thing that catches your eye, and for the most part it's remarkably well-chosen. Danny Trejo - the perpetually underrated tough-guy - plays his first mainstream starring role to the hilt. De Niro brings a sense of legitimacy to the picture and proves that he doesn't mind not being the center of attention. Rodriguez is cool throughout but positively explodes during the finale. Seagal's casting is the most controversial but also the cleverest: eight years of DTV features have done nothing to lessen his intensity, and he plays a bad guy with deliciously despicable hamminess. Jeff Fahey as the two-faced co-villain, Cheech Marin as the shotgun-toting padre, and Don Johnson as the twisted nationalist militia leader are a hoot to watch, and even Lindsay Lohan gets her share of awesome moments. It's so much fun to see all these performer together. The only performer who doesn't do too well is Jessica Alba (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sin-City/dp/B00005JNTX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sin City</a>) as the conflicted policewoman: her part's written well enough, but she doesn't seem into it and gives a spotty performance.

The film's grindhouse style is mostly consistent, but it lapses whenever the filmmakers realize they have to focus more on the story or purposely let on that they're not taking themselves seriously. Stylistic aging of the video quality is attempted early on but quickly dropped. The violence is bloody but rarely outright gruesome: even when Machete slices open a man's stomach and pulls the length of his intestines out (he uses 'em as a rope), it's sold as incredibly fake and shouldn't bother anyone besides the extra squeamish. The actual action content is pretty cool: gunfights, explosions, knife fights, and many impromptu beheadings by Machete meld together to form a veritable action opus. Surprisingly, Steven Seagal's character gets in on very little of this: he's most active late in the movie, when he engages Machete in a swordfight that's neat but not nearly as furious as the other ones he's had in his career. Spectacle is occasionally played over substance here, but I can't fault these scenes: any gunfight that convinces me that Lindsay Lohan is hardcore automatically deserves credit.

The film's political overtones regarding the exploitation of illegal labor in the U.S. are, in my opinion, justified but could easily limit its appeal among viewers with different opinions. (Anyone who frequented this one's forum on IMDb years ago will remember all the Henny-Pennies who cried that it was going to initiate a race war.) Nevertheless, I don't consider this a serious political movie - just a fun, reckless action flick with a bit of style. Even if this one doesn't become a cult classic, director Robert Rodriguez ought to be proud of his work.",1316649600,8,4309,6.082236842105263
4313764,1,B004B63M1S,"I am so glad that I didn't pay to see this movie.  I remember seeing the trailer and thinking that it looked interesting, but this movie was pure garbage.  There were some good lines, some good action scenes, and more than little female nudity.  A lot of the action scenes were terribly unrealistic, but I can live with that if the acting and the story are good.  That was not the case with this movie.  Despite having some talented people in this movie the acting was terrible, but it's the story that really ticked me off.  I am not a bible-thumping conservative redneck from the south, I am politically moderate, I have a white collar job, and I was born and raised in the Midwest.  That being said I cannot believe that they would have a character in the movie, who is an obvious caricature of John McCain, be one of the biggest villains.  There are plenty of politicians who lie, steal, and cheat, but I can't envision any senator doing a fraction of what De Niro's character did.  Regardless of what your political views and whether or not you like John McCain, he volunteered to go to war even though his father had the ability to make sure that he never had to.  He was a POW, and he has given more for this country than most people have, and I think it was insulting to portray a character based off of him as someone evil.  Another thing is that all of the white people in the movie were portrayed as being extremely stupid.  If the heroes in this movie had been white instead of Mexican, and all of the white villains that were killed had instead been black there would be accusations that it was a blatantly racist movie and they would be correct.  I am generally not going to be interested in a movie where the heroes are illegal aliens, but if that is what you are looking for I would have to strongly recommend the comedy:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ladron-Que-Roba-A-Ladron-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000YIGNC2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ladron Que Roba A Ladron (Widescreen Edition)</a>.

4313766,4,B004B63M1S,"Machete"" is one f those films that you need to view when you are in the proper frame of mind.  And while you are in this zone, you need to consider just what the film is and what the film is meant to be.  I watched this one late at night and ran across it while channel surfing, which is the only way I watch T.V.  I have to tell you that I very much enjoyed it, as hokey as it was.

Hey, you have Danny Trejo (A recent favorite of mine for action films; he is as good as Arnold and most certainly can act better) staring along with Robert De Niro, Cheech Marin (Now who on earth does not like Cheech?), Jessica Alba and Lindsay Lohan (They both could do a movie without saying a word and I still would enjoy it), Steven Segal (Playing Steven Segal...need I say more), Stacy Keach and a slew of other familiar faces.  This is a good cast and each named here have turned out some fine movies...well, most of them have.  If you start with a good cast not much can go wrong...right?  Well the answer to that question will all be in the eye of the viewer.  Let's take a look at what this movie is and what it is not.

First, as other reviewers have so well pointed out, this is a parody of the old racial exploitation movies of the 1970s, make no mistake.  To take this movie with even the slightest grain of seriousness would be a grave error and greatly distract from the enjoyment of the entire film.  The plot is absolutely silly and the action shots will stretch the viewer's credibility to the limits.  Many of the lines in this movie can best be described as hackneyed at best.  It must be remembered though that this was done on purpose.  The maker of this film was out to make a point and in my opinion, he did his job well as did his actors.

Secondly, there is scene after scene after scene after scene of extremely graphic and completely gratuitous violence.  I lost track of the body count and the maiming early on in the film.  Again, as far as I can tell, this was the intent of the films maker.  It also contains completely gratuitous nudity and partial nudity, but considering whose skin we saw, I must say I was grateful for this aspect of the film.

Third, the movie does exploit and does make a political statement, crude though it may be.  We basically have illegal and legal Mexican immigrants' verses stereotyped right-wing gun nuts and racists.  Both the parts of the abused and down-trodden immigrants and the wing-nuts are overplayed to the hilt and both are so stereotyped that it is quite obvious that it was done on purpose.  If it had not been so grim and gruesome, it would have been funny.

Forth, this is most certainly an action thriller and the action is plentiful, graphic and almost nonstop.  The severed heads and limbs are without number and the casual shooting and blowing up of people...well; even the most jaded viewer should be well sated after this one.

On a personal note; Steven Seagal really needs to stay away from the surgical enhancement people, the botox parties, and back away from the chow table...Steven, Steven, Steven!

I am giving this one four stars simply because I am taking the film for what it is and it was sort of fun to watch...once.  I am taking one star away because I would have loved to have seen a bit more of the gratuitous nudity and semi-nudity and I most certainly would have liked to have seen more of the leather warrior woman outfits.  Warrior women in leather with flat abs...does it get any better?

The film falls a little short of the classic grindhouse homage that Rodriguez achieved with ""Planet Terror"".  It's possible that Rodriguez captured the grindhouse ethos so succinctly in that film that he had nowhere to go but down.  One minor quibble is the acting prowess of star Danny Trejo.  Trejo is a fine character actor but when asked to carry the burden of lead he falls a little short.  The scars and pockmarks on his face say infinitely more than anything inherent in his performance.  Not to worry because Rodriguez surrounds him with an expert cast.  Who would have thought of Steven Seagal capable of giving a full bodied performance.  This made a better ""trailer"" than a fully realized feature.  That doesn't escape the fact that it is a consistently entertaining flick.",1310774400,,1293,5.047169811320755

I did kind of think Danny Trejo slept his way through half the movie (i expected his character to be a bit more angry and a bit less....old and haggard i guess). That is minor, however, in light of my main complaint.
The movie is really about illegal immigration, and is condescending towards the view that people shouldn't just be wandering around here with no legality. It basically says it's cool to just come here illegally and do whatever you want. My point of contention is that while the immigration laws need to be reformed, illegal immigration is actually a problem here in America. Undocumented people have an easier time committing crimes since they have an easier time disappearing afterwards. There is no accountability. That is really just one in a long list of reasons why illegal immigration is a problem however.
The movie takes the opposite view, and pretty much labels anybody who is opposed to illegal immigration as uneducated, a racist, redneck, or a criminal of some sort. It is a clever movie, but disingenuous overall...",1310688000,2,1173,4.811881188118812

However, there were some heavy-hitter stars with good acting on board (Does anybody else see the irony of Don Johnson and Cheech Marin here?).

Also, I think there was a change in plot somewhere between the preview and the release that left me confused - was Machete out for revenge, survival, or justice? Were we to believe during the preview that Machete was an ex-cop?

Seagal's character seems to be more of a spoof than anything else.  It's Seagal's opportunity to portray just the type of thug that he relentlessly went after in his early movies (before his acting career dropped off the map).

4313824,4,B004B63M1S,"I've got 2 words for everyone that's saying 'Machete' is a horrible mess...you're right. It's an epic failure, but what else do you expect from Robert Rodriguez? He realizes his shortcomings as a storyteller, so he compensates by filling the screen with tons of big name stars, loud explosions, over-the-top sex and violence and anything else he can think of. Obviously it's overkill and it doesn't really work, but you can't say he's not trying. With all due respect to 'Touch Of Evil' -  once considered the best B-movie ever made -  I think 'Machete' can safely wear that crown. Where else are you going to see Danny Trejo bed Michelle Rodriguez, Jessica Alba and Lindsay Lohan on his way to an epic sword fight with Steven Seagal? Or Robert DeNiro, as a racist Texas senator, shooting everyone in sight? There are so many more unbelievable sights and sounds to be found here, that I strongly recommend seeing it twice. Odds are, if you're like me, you'll be less than impressed the first time around because there's simply too much stuff going on. But after the 2nd and 3rd time, you'll be having too much fun enjoying it for what it is: a gloriously trashy movie that makes you wish other filmmakers had the talent and guts to make movies like this more often.

Ex-Federale Machete (Danny Trejo) has been double-crossed and left for dead. After watching Torrez (Seagal), a Mexican druglord, brutally murder his wife and daughter, he vows revenge. Problem is he's not a cop anymore so he's forced to compete with all the other day laborers for whatever menial job he can get his  hands on. When shadowy political fixer  Boothe (Jeff Fahey) offers him $150,000 to assassinate Sen. McLaughlin (DeNiro), he thinks his luck might be turning around. It isn't. Once more Machete finds himself double-crossed and left for dead. But with the help of a sexy taco truck proprietor/revolutionary (Rodriguez) he's back on his feet in no time and more pissed than ever. He sets out to take down Torrez, Boothe and their minions one by one. Along the way he'll also have to battle an I.C.E. agent (Alba) intent on bringing him in, a flashy hitman (Tom Savini) and a hillbilly border guard (Don Johnson) waging a one man war against all Mexicans. Machete isn't going it alone though, he has his brother (Cheech Marin), now a man of the cloth, supplying him with incriminating evidence against Boothe and McLaughlin, as well as a hearse as an inconspicuous getaway vehicle. And, as if Rodriguez and Alba weren't enough, Machete also has the love of another good woman (Lohan) and her mom as well. If it sounds convoluted and pointlessly complicated, that's because it is. There's far too many characters and plot twists guaranteeing that not everything will be neatly wrapped up by the end of the film. But there are plenty of highlights along the way such as LiLo's first official nude scene (you do see something by the way), Steven Seagal's triumphant (?) return to the big screen after 7+ years in direct-to-video purgatory and Danny Trejo finally getting his time in the spotlight after appearing in nearly 150 films. So learn to take the good with the bad - and believe me there's plenty of both to go around - and enjoy this one-of-a-kind film that may just be Rodriguez's best.",1298332800,5,3273,4.745166959578207
4313825,4,B004B63M1S,"In the recent trend to do 80's action movie throwbacks, many of them are lacking that original take-no-prisoners style that Arnold, Sly, and other action stars from the 80's possessed.  Well, luckily, that's not the case here.  This is full-steam-ahead action.  It hearkens back to a time when men were men and had cajones, and not the emo, troubled, cry-into-a-pillow-at-night types that have dominated over the past decade and a half (who are really just one-dimensional along a different tangent).  This movie is not even remotely realistic, nor does it try to be.  It's not deep by any stretch of the imagination.  It's just plain old-fashioned action wrapped in a plain paper bag.  The good stuff.

My only complaints are that Rodriguez tends to crank up the gore to practically slapstick proportions, and tends to turn the characters into parodies of themselves at times.  There's also tons of stereotypes present here, but given the overall commitment to having balls, this is forgivable.

Yes he can write 'em, shoot 'em, edit 'em and score 'em, but he does not always do the best job in every one of those categories. This time he shares writing and directing duties, and the ""fun"" factor increases exponentially. Collaboration should be RR's mantra from now on.  It works.

4313833,5,B004B63M1S,"From the opening scene to the credits, ""Machete"" was violent, gritty and action packed. What I will say is that you will either love this movie, or hate it. I am one of those that LOVED it. Ok, you should also know that I appreciate Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction), Charlie Huston (Author of Hank Thompson series), Wayne Kramer (Running Scared) and Troy Duffy (Boondock Saints). I enjoy the crime noir or pulp noir genre of crime dramas because they tend to generate heated debates and discussions. No matter how you classify them, or what side you fall on (the love or the hate side), these sort of movies produce strong feelings...either negative or positive, and I think that is what most writers and producers hope for. There were some pretty controversial issues woven throughout the story.....vigilantism, immigration, drug abuse, sex, and violence....all of which set the stage for some pretty extraordinary events.  Although the subject matter and the dialog may seem on the surface to be in poor taste and offensive, I viewed it as a vehicle to tell the story, and a very entertaining story at that.

Synopsis:
Day laborer Machete Cortez (Danny Trejo) has been approached and hired by Michael Booth (Jeff Fahey) to shoot Senator McLaughlin (Robert Deniro). This assassination attempt was meant to endear voters to the Senator who is running on a ""strict regulations against illegal immigrants"" platform. What's better than a fallen hero?  Anyway, what Booth does not realize is that Machete's past is a little more complicated than he initially realized. Machete is an ex-Federale (Special Agent) who was presumed dead after being shot in the head following a case that went terribly wrong, and even resulted in his wife being beheaded. Now living the simple life as a day laborer, Machete is associated with some very unique characters, among them Luz, a vigilante/activist whose main goal is to help those who truly need rescuing while running a taco truck. Unbeknownst to them both, they are being watched by the very tenacious, ICE Agent Santana Rivera (played by Jessica Alba) who wants to prove herself and bring in the bad guy(s). Meanwhile, Booth is restless and has his own agenda, not to mention a very unstable drug dependant daughter, April (played by Lindsay Lohan) who he has some very impure thoughts about. To complicate matters, Booth also has a relationship with Von Jackson (Don Johnson) an eager border enforcer; and Drug Lord Torrez (played by Steve Seagal), none of which will result in anything positive. Even Machete's brother, Padre Cortez (Cheech Marin) isn't immune to what is going on and finds himself in a precarious position. As the violence escalates and the story unfolds, you see an underworld that contains gun totting nurses, a patch wearing Rodriquez, hired assassins, and dirty politicians, not to mention seeing the knife wielding Machete kill several dozen people who stand in the way of vengeance or justice.

So before passing judgment on the movie, I suggest you just give it a chance. Challenge yourself to look beyond the stereotypes, violence and other things that on the surface are disturbing, and take it for what it is....a story about wrongs being made right, and good overcoming evil. I highly recommend this movie, and think most will enjoy it.",1297209600,3,3307,5.007272727272727

This movie is patterned after the other Grindhouse type films with nudity, killing, guns, excessive blood, bad acting, bad dialouge, and a plot that doesn't make much sense. In this film Rodriguez thankfully parts way with the Drive-in intermission as well as the fake burning film, and film noise.

Danny Trejo, who makes Steve Tyler look like a pretty boy is the main hero is this film. Jessica Alba plays an immigration agent. Steven Seagal, using various bad Mexican accents plays a drug lord. DeNiro is a state senator who, along with his aide is in cahoots with the drug lord as well as a vigilante group along the border. Michelle Rodriquez leads a group of poor Mexicans, all with cell phones.

The plot is immaterial. In one scene the car starts on fire before it hits anything...then explodes. Lindsey Lohan goes topless and later dresses in a nun's outfit, packed with a gun. (Plot Spoiler?) She goes to shoot DeNiro, and says, ""In the name of my father"" BAM! BAM! then says ""I forgot the rest."" In the end, all alliances break down and everyone tries to kill everyone.

Alba is also naked in the shower with her arms and legs strategically placed. She is best in the deleted scenes as her own twin sister which we never see in the movie. Every time Alba comes home she finds her in bed with some guy. Her twin calls her a ""B"" word and Alba responds by calling her a ""slut.""

Those of us who refuse the continual intrusions of cell phone technology cheered in support. Unfortunately, Machete - played by the magnificent Danny Trejo - succumbs, three-quarters of the way through the film.

Disappointing ... as have too many of the films Robert Rodriguez has delivered since ""Sin City."" There's no heart in this action flick, just a parade of violence and lust.

While ""Machete"" doesn't rise to the quality of Rodriguez's first ""El Mariachi,"" its pacing hits light speed and the action is outrageous and gory. The women have rolled out of a Penthouse fantasy, especially in the deleted scenes extra. Most disappointing is the exploitation of Lindsay Lohan. Nude scenes with Lohan and  Alicia Rachel Marek are obviously air-brushed and over the top. Nothing about them feel comfortable or right.

Other female characters fight in stilettos and wear black leather bras, eye patches and micro-minis as they gun down villains. The plot revolves around bad Americans who bloodily enforce anti-immigration laws in an especially ugly way.

The cast is composed of Rodriguez's extended family of actors: Robert De Niro (Trejo, Rodriguez's cousin, appeared with him in ""Heat""), Don Johnson (bud of Cheech Marin and long time regular in Rodriguez projects), Jessica Alba (""Sin City"") and Michelle Rodriguez (Robert's wife). Steven Seagal and Jeff Fahey also appear.

Trejo's face, a Day of the Dead visage come alive, seems made for HD - and Blu-ray is his artist; every line, scar and muscle shines in detail. The film begins with the look of an old grindhouse flick, then progresses to smooth HD sheen. The color is bright and hot, especially on sun-drenched streets and furious muscle cars; the variety of skin tones is good. Detail reveals worn leather and well-used weapons. The sound is fierce - balancing dialogue, gunplay, ambient noise and a rich score by John Debney and Carl Thiel.

Just as the film is not overburdened by plot, the disc is not overwhelmed with extras. Aside from the live-theater release, there are a few R- and even X-rated scenes that were wisely deleted from the final cut. Those with BDLive-enabled players can access behind-scenes footage and a digital version is also included.

To be sure, I admire Rodriguez as a writer and director; all of his earlier films are in my personal library. I just wish he'd bring us more palatable stories with characters his audience could care about. I've been waiting for a film featuring Danny Trejo, but this isn't it.",1296086400,3,2595,5.004640371229699
4313851,5,B004B63M1S,"SOME SPOILERS

Some years back, Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez decided to create an homage to the low-budget, high-absurdity midnight cinema, a project they called GRINDHOUSE, after the dirty, popcorn-and-candy-bar-wrapper-strewn, soda-sticky floored, torn screen movie theaters known by that name. Grindhouses usually showed 86 minute double features with names like PELVIS and THE CARS THAT EAT PEOPLE. They sustained themselves with showings of THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW and THE GRATEFUL DEAD MOVIE, ignoring the pungent smells of marijuana and ""locker room"" that permeated the seating area, along with cheap wine and beer and vomit---Yes, you can tell, I was there, I admit it. The films grindhouses showed had badly scratched blobby prints that hummed and jumped their sprockets. The third reel sometimes came in the middle, depending on the relative sobriety of the projectionist.

Tarantino and Rodriguez's homage included a double feature, PLANET TERROR and DEATH PROOF, and a number of Coming Attractions, among which was MACHETE, a movie simply rip-roaring with silly stereotypes, cartoonish violence, and an absurd plotline.

MACHETE's star, Danny Trejo, is an American success story. After completing a now-long ago prison stint, Trejo began acting, at first staring in Andy Sidaris movies. His stone-cold scarred visage has graced many action films since.

MACHETE is the story of a former Mexican Federale, nicknamed after his favorite weapon, whose family is killed by a drug kingpin, Mr. Torrez (played by Steven Seagal). Swearing eventual vengeance, Machete manages to escape by swimming the Rio Grande, taking up residence in Texas as an undocumented alien working as a gardener---What else???

He is approached by a businessman, Booth (Jeff Fahey), who hires him to kill the ultra-conservative Texas Senator McLaughlin (played like a rabid LBJ by Robert DeNiro), who enjoys hunting down and shooting border crossers in company with Von (Don Johnson), the head of a self-appointed vigilante Border Guard unit (the bad guys in MACHETE are all played by Norteamericanos).

Machete takes the upfront money he gets for shooting the Senator, and donates it to ""The Network"" a shadowy organization founded by the mysterious She, that aids undocumented aliens and others in need. ""We help everybody"" says Luz (the blazingly hot Michelle Rodriguez), who runs The Network from the back of a taco truck, providing money, health care, and lessons in self-defense to the disenfranchised people whom she protects. The idea of class warfare runs like a raging torrent through MACHETE.

Although Machete never shoots the Senator, someone else does (in the leg), and Machete is blamed for the assassination attempt (in the wake of Tucson, the whole ""shoot the Senator"" subplot has become eerie). Now a hunted man, Machete vows to find out why and by whom he is being framed. He quicky allies himself with Luz, and with FBI Agent Rivera (Jessica Alba). He sleeps with both of them. He also sleeps with Booth's wife and drunken, drug-addled daughter (played by Lindsay Lohan, who was hardly acting) at the same time. Lohan ends the film wearing a nun's habit---talk about over the top!!!.

Machete discovers that the whole shooting incident was carefully orchestrated by Booth, McLaughlin, Von and Torrez, who want to reduce the number of illegals in the U.S. in order to drive up drug demand, agricultural prices and service costs, and hence profits, in the companies they own. They can't find Machete, but they kill his brother, a Father played by Cheech Marin, by nastily crucifying him in his own church.

Machete goes on a rampage, slashing and chopping his way through the rich mens' minions. The blood flies, often spattering the camera lenses. He escapes capture by cutting open a killer's belly, grabbing a handful of the guy's small intestines, and using it like an escape rope. In his gardener's role, he weed-whacks a few bad guys to death, impales a few more, and basically spreads gore like Christmas cheer.

While doing so, he raises an army of Latino farm workers who attack the Booth-McLauglin-Von-Torrez forces in low-riders with blaring radios and bouncy suspensions, fruit trucks, and landscapers' pickups. In the end, the real supporters of American democracy win.

It's simply hyperbolic, but, despite its clownishness, MACHETE does say something meaningful to the audience.

First off, the movie maker assumes there is no other view in America, except to kill Mexicans or any other Latino. Worse, though, is the view that all Mexicans/Latinos want is to kill anyone that wants to stop them from entering America in any fashion they chose, but also that it's fair to kill anyone and everyone anyway. The fight scenes are pure comic book, the gratuitous naked girls are scripted thirteen year old fantasies (""magically"" naked Lohan waiting for the pool boy) and the story line about as week as anyone could dream up.

If you are a big fan of movie fast action, guns, shooting, and blood, Machete is a must see!

Machete came out of a fake trailer that was featured in Grindhouse and was a brain storm Robert Rodriguez had after meeting Trejo on the set of Desperado.

As a fan of Robert Rodriguez movies, I knew I was going to love this movie. I remember Danny Trejo from two of my favorite movies, From Dusk Till Dawn with George Clooney and Desperado with Antonio Bandaras.  I really was excited to see this when it was in the theater. Unfortunately, I never got there but thanks to 20th Century Fox, I was able to review the DVD which was released early this month.

Machete, played by Danny Trejo is a Mexican Federale who is on a mission to rescue a kidnapped girl. He is set up and watched his wife and daughter murdered while he is left for dead. Fast forward 3 years and he is laying low, looking for honest work when he is offered a suitcase full of money by Michael Booth (Jeff Fahey) to kill a Senator played by Robert De Niro. It's a set up to show that this illegal immigrant is trying to assassinate the Senator.  He is taken to a Network hospital. U.S. Immigration and Enforcement Agent Sartana Rivera (Jessica Alba) is sent to retrieve the injured Machete.

With the help of Luz (Michelle Rodriquez) and his priest brother played by Cheech of Cheech and Chong, Machete seeks revenge on Booth.  After much death, machete throwing, making out, and recovery scenes, Machete rides into the sunset with one of the chicks on his bike (not telling which one).

Only in a movie by Robert Rodriquez could a guy who looks like Danny Trejo make out with Lindsey Lohan (yup she is in there too), Jessica Alba, Michelle Rodiguez, and Alicia Marek.

Great movie if you like this kind of thing and I do. Spent most of the move fight scenes going ""ahhhh"" ""ohhhh"" ""damnnnn"".  Fun, and a big cast: Don Johnson, Steven Seagal also have roles in this bloody revenge movie.",1295308800,3,1971,4.434903047091413
4313863,1,B004B63M1S,"I thought this would be a fun movie, like Mexicans fighting Mexican corruption in Mexico to better the lives of Mexicans in Mexico.  Nope. Machete is worthless political trash with whitey Americans being the usual profiling target and illegal immigration a glorious social acceptance and human right. I mentally puked at the political platform and brotherhood-sisterhood of Mexicanism being the celebrated theme justifying illegal immigration into the United States.

  De Niro is an idiot for being in this movie, like many of the other actors (who obviously needed the work). Or maybe it was their hypocritical world socialist/communist pseudo political left worldview which made them do it (support its political overtones). Oh and I read an earlier review which said this movie made fun of the liberal/left...a typical lie. This movie, in some sick twisted way, attempts to give legitimacy to violence (revolution?), sympathy in breaking Federal Law and ignorance in the U.S. Constitution. Even though attempting to be a slick ""B"" movie, this movie is no civil rights movie, just one of political stupidity and acceptable ethnic violence. It gloriously preaches a justification of a ""Mexican Railroad"" (sneaking in illegal immigrants into the United States) grotesquely trying to make similarities to the African American slaves of the Underground Railroad. Historically Sick, just like the ""liberals"" and uneducated who support this movie.

  After observance of Martin Luther King Day, this movie really makes me ill.

  Truly sad. It could have been a great movie if it were about Mexicans fighting Mexican Corruption in Mexico to better the lives of Mexicans in Mexico. This movie is as worthless as a Nazi propaganda movie. I'm glad I only barrowed it.",1295308800,15,1761,5.302158273381295

Also, the Mexicans, rarely hang at those day labourer places. Most already have jobs lined up, as depicted in fellow Austinite Richard Linkleter's Fast Food Nation.

Corrupt Politicians and law enforcement working with Drug Cartels. That plot seems pretty right to me, and its not even supposed to be taken seriously.

You can find a lot of parallels between the plotline of this movie and today's newspaper headlines, which I'm sure to a certain extent is what inspired Robert Rodriguez while he was writing the screenplay. There's comedy, action and enough blood and violence that would even make Freddy Krueger jealous!

I personally love the low budget feel to this movie, it fits perfectly with the over the top violence and gritty story telling. If you're looking for something else other than 3D, a high budget special effects thrill ride or an animated kids movie than this is it, you won't be disappointed.

The cast spans from ""A"" list celebs to ""B' rated stars to even Enquirer faithfuls such as Lindsay Lohan. All of which fill their respected roles beautifully and with lots of charm.

Cartoonish fun at its best, Robert Rodriguez' Machete comes out firing on all cylinders. If you're looking for ambiguous gore, interminable action, exceptional star-power, and a whole lotta ""just-plain-fun"", you've come to the right place.

Typically, a movie so jam-packed with nonsensical, action-based, turmoil would find it hard to accommodate the inclusion of a palatable storyline, but not so with Machete. You find yourself rooting for Danny Trejo's character (Machete) from frame one to the last throughout his societal and political dilemma. Aside from this, there are so many elements and layers that stand out that at least a few must be listed:

1. As already alluded to by other reviewers, it's simply AWESOME to see Danny Trejo finally pick up a much-deserved main character role after so many exceptional supporting roles.

2. With gorgeous women like Jessica Alba, scantilly-clad Michelle Rodriguez, and semi-good looking, nude women like Lindsay Lohan and Alicia Rachel Mark, just about all of the human male's appetites for hotties are sated.

3. The nostalgia level is through the roof with some of the actors in attendance here:

Don Johnson - (We haven't seen him in a notable role for years.)

Jessica Alba - (Probably one of the most naturally beautiful women on the planet.)

Lindsay Lohan - (Huh? What's she doing here? Isn't she in rehab?)

Robert DeNiro - (A huge Hollywood star like Robert in a movie like this? Unexpected, but literally awesome. Like always, he commands every scene he is in and makes his character his own.)

Steven Seagal - (He turned down Sylvester for ""The Expendables"" but redeemed himself to a degree by taking on this villainous role. Great to see him in a movie that exists a bit above the B-movie level for once in a blue moon. Maybe he'll turn up in ""The Expendables 2""...hopefully. It would still be great to see him star with Jean-Claude Van Damme one of these days as well.)

Michelle Rodriguez - (Huge sex-appeal and exceptional stage presence.)

Jeff Fahey - (Perfectly cast.)

Cheech Marin - (Really...Cheech as a padre who smokes pot? THAT, my friends, is nostalgia at its finest!)

4. The whole problem with illegal aliens crossing the Mexican border is presented with very in-your-face ardor but handled deftly with tact and respect for both sides of that very real political impasse.

Director Robert Rodriguez is normally much more clever with his set pieces and camera work. This movie feels like exactly what it is - a quickly-made movie based on a clever parody trailer. DeNiro and Don Johnson (and others) are wasted, obviously hoping for some of the cool cred that Bruce Willis got from his turn in ""Sin City"" (but that movie had great source material and style to spare). Rodriguez is slumming here, stretching one or two nifty moments over 90 minutes.
It's (severed) heads above most wannabe B action movies you could rent, but it's certainly sub-par for Mr. Rodriguez. Watch ""Planet Terror"" instead.

4313881,3,B004B63M1S,"I have mixed feelings about this movie.

It still has its grindhouse theme so it feels somewhat cheesy, but it was intentionally made to be that way, similar to previous grindhouse movies. Danny Trejo does a pretty good job with the part and is fun to watch, as is Steven Seagal. He does a poor job of playing a mexican, but hes a old action star from the 80's and 90's so its still amusing to see him now.

The overall storyline is ok, but two things are so cheesy they are comical. One is how every girl falls all over Machete like they have never seen a man before and the other is the fighting between the mexican's and the so called american freedom fighters protecting the border. Its almost like they took the real news of today and made a parody out of it for the movie which is why it can be hilarious at times.

Robert Deniro, Cheech Marin, and Don Johnson played their parts well. Lindsay Lohan was funny because she was basically playing herself. Ive never found Michelle Rodriguez that attractive in the past, but she really stood out in this movie with her part occasionally standing out more than Machete. Jessica Alba's part was both good and bad. Shes talented and great looking, but watching her fall all over Machete just didn't fit her.

If you go into this movie expecting a somewhat cheesy action flick with a grindhouse theme you will probably be satisfied. If you expect more you won't like this movie.",1294444800,2,1426,4.473076923076923
4313882,4,B004B63M1S,"Machete is the byproduct of a trailer shown with Grindhouse, the Tarantino/Rodriguez homage to exploitation cinema.  But while the Grindhouse pairing almost tried too hard in mixing original storyline with its homage, Machete revels in exploitation film conventions.  The result is a mix of over the top action, ridiculous violence, and gratuitous sex and nudity.  It makes no attempt to be deep, even though it has some biting satire towards immigration policy.  The film is ridiculous fun.

The film's greatest asset is Rodriguez's slight of hand film making.  This film was made for 10 million, and while it has an intentional cheap feel, some of the actions scenes could have easily being pulled from a 100 million dollar blockbuster.  The action is very funny and very stylized.  An early use of interesting props in a hospital is the tip of the iceberg for me.

The characters are equally fun.  Machete is a typical action here whose actions speak much louder than his words.  Danny Trejo is a perfect fit for this role, as he looks cold and serious, but is able to deliever the over the top action and such fun lines as ""Machete don't text"" without cracking a smile.  The supporting cast is equally impressive, particularly Robert De Niro, a proponent of immigration form who takes his disdain for immigrants to new highs.  De Niro plays a very stereotypical white politician with a slight southern accent.  De Niro's performance has a perfect subtle charm to it and as goofy as this movie can be, is probably one of the better roles he's had in a while.

The story is not important and is actually the weakness of the movie.  It involves Machete being set up to look like he wanted to murder De Niro's character.  But as characters flood the movie, the story gets a little muddlded.  This never stops it from being fun, but can make the film a little more busy than it needs to be.

Don't go in expecting something deep and appreciate the film for what it is and you will enjoy it.  Flawed, yes, but this as fun a Robert Rodriguez movie as you can hope for.",1294444800,,2065,4.636363636363637

DeNiro played his role well, even if it wasn't too much of a big one. Same with Seagal, and it was nice to see Seagal play a bad guy - that doesn't happen often. Seagal def was convincing.

I think the writing could of been a bit better for some of the minor roles (Seagal/DeNiro), but it was nice to see Trejo with the main role. He should definitely do some more movies w/ bigger roles.

For being an ""exploitation"" movie, it has some pretty big names in it, and all do a great job. It's also nice to see Danny Trejo in a starring role after all these small (but great) ones he's had in the past.

Right off the bat, I'll say the movie isn't fantastic. The original trailer was jam-packed with exploitation, action and ""That was just AWESOME!"" Moments, and it's hard to make a whole movie that can live up to that.

With that said, it's a very fun movie for fans of the genre. Be ready for some blood and guts (and with a name like ""Machete"", what do you expect?) - this is definitely for the hardcore fans.

It's not quite up to the caliber of Grindhouse or Planet Terror, but it's a nice ""B-Side"" to it which is very fun to watch (both for the over-the-top moments, the characters and some of the jokes).

The Blu-Ray looks VERY NICE, probably nicer than it should. Colors are great, picture is sharp and all-around a nice Blu-Ray disc. Same is true for the audio.. lots of explosions, music and sound effects that come across great.

The problem, however, are the extras. You do get a digital copy (itunes compatible so it'll work on Apple TV, iTunes PC/Mac and iPod/iPhone/iPad) on disc 2, but the only features are a few deleted scenes (maybe 10 minutes worth?), trailers and an ""audience reaction track"" (alternate audio recorded from a live theater audience so you can hear their reactions has you watch the movie).

The problem, however, is that there has to be more.. Robert Rodriguez is like the KING of great home-video releases. He's usually got tons of behind the scenes footage, commentaries, interviews, extended/directors cuts, home-movie-school, cooking school, etc.. and none are found here. It really seems like they held it for an ""unrated cut"" a few months down the road (similar to the extras-free Avatar release and the new 3-disc extended cut). Unfortunately, with it being ""Machete"" and not ""Avatar"", I don't know if sales will be good enough for them to ever release a ""special edition"" version.

Overall this is a very fun movie, looks/sounds great and only leaves you wanting more from the extras.

There's more to the story than that, but what there is in terms of story doesn't matter a whole lot as Rodriguez and his co-director Ethan Maniquis manage to craft and weave so much outrageous, bloody mayhem that you can't help but admire it.  Still though, Machete doesn't conjure up the same kind of B-movie greatness that Grindhouse managed to do, but it does a great job on its own merits regardless.  That, and a surprising cast featuring hotties Michelle Rogriguez and Jessica Alba, along with Steven Seagal (!), Jeff Fahey, Don Johnson, Cheech Marin, and Lindsay Lohan (yes Lindsay Lohan); all of which help make Machete such a blast to watch.

IT SEEMS TO MAKE THE ILLEGAL ALIENS THE HEROES, AND THE PEOPLE THAT TRY TO SECURE OUR BORDERS THE VILLAINS.BAD INTERPRETATION.MAYBE, SOME OF THE METHODS USED THAT WERE DEPICTED IN THE FILM TO RID THE COUNTRY OF ILLEGAL ALIENS WERE CRUEL. LIKE ELECTRIFING THE FENCE, AND SHOOTING ILLEGAL ALIENS ON SITE (GOOD IDEAS ?) APPARENTLY NOT ACCORDING TO THIS FILM.UNDERSTAND ONE THING, ""THESE PEOPLE ARE HERE ILLEGALLY"". THEY'RE ASKING FOR IT. THEY DON'T LIKE IT, TELL THEM TO EITHER BECOME LEGAL, OR GO BACK TO MEXICO WERE THEY BELONG.IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED I'M OPPOSED TO IMMIGRATION, BUT LETS GET BACK TO THE FILM AND AVOID POLITICAL PROPAGANDA.

  THE FILMS CAST CAN BE CONSIDERED OFF KILTER. FIRST OF ALL ROBERT DENIRO PLAYING A RACIST POLITICIAN IN A MOVIE HE SHOULD HAVE SKIPPED. THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST ACTORS OF ALL TIME. WHY WOULD HE GET INVOLVED WITH THIS? ALSO TO NOTE DENIRO IS COMPLETLY THE OPPOSITE OF THE CHARACTER HE PORTRAYS IN REAL LIFE. HE'S ACTUALLY FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. NEXT DANNY TREJO AS THE LEAD STAR OF THE FILM. DANNY TREJO IS GOOD AS A SUPPORTING STAR PORTRAYING A VILLAIN. HE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A HERO. HE ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE A ROCK QUARRY THAT'S BEEN DYNAMITED. ITS A JOKE ON THE AUDIENCE TO SEE HIM AS A GOOD GUY.HE WAS GREAT IN MOVIES LIKE DESPERADO, HEAT, FROM DUSK TILL DAWN, ETC. HE'S PRIMARILIY CAST AS A VICIOUS VILLAIN, NOT A HERO.FINALLY LINDSAY LOHAN IN A FILM. WHY DO THEY KEEP GIVING THIS DRUG ADDICTED PIECE OF GARBAGE MOVIE PARTS? LEAVE HER IN JAIL WHERE SHE BELONGS. FINALLY JESSICA ALBA AS A FBI AGENT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME? SHE PROBABLY COULDN'T FIRE A DAISY BB GUN. SEEING HER IN THIS PART WAS JUST AS FUNNY AS SEEING JESSICA BIEL AS A SOLDIER IN HOME OF THE BRAVE.UNFORTUNATELY THESE 2 YOUNG WOMEN LACK THE KIND OF TOUGHNESS THAT MICHELLE RODRIGUEZ HAS.

  NOW THE POSITIVES ABOUT THE FILMS CAST:

  IT WAS GREAT TO SEE STEVEN SEAGAL AS A VILLAIN AND HE WASN'T SO HARD TO KILL IN THIS FILM. (PARDEN THE PUN). HE ACTUALLY STOLE THE SHOW. THANKS STEVE! THE FINAL BATTLE WITH HIM AND TREJO WAS FUN TO WATCH.BRINGING JEFF FAHEY AND DON JOHNSON IN THE FILM AS SUPPORTERS WAS NICE. FAHEY IS A FINE ACTOR THAT'S RECENTLY BE SEEN ON THE SHOW LOST. WE ALL KNOW DON JOHNSON FROM THE MIAMI VICE DAYS. FAHEY PLAYS A CORRUPT POLITICAL AID TO DENIRO AND THE FATHER OF THE LOHAN CHARACTER. DON JOHNSON IS THE BORDER PATROL AGENT WHO WOULD RATHER SHOOT ANY ILLEGALS INSTEAD OF ARRESTING THEM AS THEY CROSS THE BORDER. ALSO MICHELLE RODRIGUEZ AS A FOOD STAND WORKER WHO ENDS UP JOINING A IMMIGRATION RESISTANCE UP AGAINST DENIRO. SHE WAS PERFECTLY CAST FOR THIS PARTICULAR PART. THIS ACTRESS IS SEEN IN THE SHOW LOST, RESIDENT EVIL, AND SWAT. SHE ALWAYS PLAYS A HARD CORE TOUGH GIRL AND THE SAME KIND OF CHARACTERIZATION IS PORTRAYED HERE. SHE WASTES QUITE A FEW PEOPLE IN THE FILM. IN FACT SHE'S RIGHT UPTHERE WITH TREJOS CHARACTER WITH THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE SHE KILLS. IT'S NICE TO SEE CHEECH MARTIN AS A DRUNKEN PREACHER TO LEND SOME COMEDY TO FILM. UNFORTUNATELY HIS PART IS WAY TO SHORT.

  ROBERT RODRIGUEZ, THE FILMS DIRECTOR, IS VERY ADEPT IN FILMING ACTION SCENES. SOME OF THE SLOW MOTION STUFF IN PARTICULAR. THE WAY HE DIRECTS TREJOS CHARACTER ALL THROUGHOUT THE FILM WAS UNIQUE. YOU WOULD THINK TREJO COULD BE A FUTURE ACTION FILM STAR TOUGH GUY LATER ON DOWN THE ROAD.EVEN AT HIS PRESENT AGE DANNY TREJO ( A FORMER BOXER BY THE WAY) HAS THE PHYSICAL CHARECTERISTICS TO PULL IT OFF.

  SO A SHORT SUMMARY. ILLEGAL ALIENS TRY TO GET INTO COUNTRY ARE KILLED,AND A COP,TREJO COMES TO THE RESCUE OF HIS COMPADRES, ALONG WITH RODRIQUEZ TO OVERTHROW SEAGAL'S CHARACTER TORREZ A DRUG SMUGGLER AND DENIRO'S CHARACTER, A CORRUPT RACIST POLITICIAN WHO ALSO KILLS ILLEGALS HIMSELF.

This is an action film with a few good one-liners and I'll be fair and give it 3-4 stars with a recommendation to buy it if you are a Rodriguez fan. Don't expect ground breaking stuff here but expect a fair action flick that is a bit exagerated and you'll be fine.
The reg. edition comes with an audience soundtrack and that made watching it a second time worth the time. This is where a viewing in a theater was recorded and every time a funny thing happened or big action scene happened, you can hear the audience reactions.
Political plot? I wouldn't say they went out of their way to make a political point in this film. Deniro played a character that was running for a position (in Texas) that the topics of illegal aliens and jobs etc would be big ticket issues and he takes a one sided position that wasn't popular. It was his character. That's the way I saw it.

Machete - ""Machete don't text."" when he is yelled at by Alba that he could have text'd her.

He is a former Mexican Federale whose life is ruined by a drug lord (Steven Seagal, of course), hired by a corrupt senator and his underling (Robert De Niro and Jeff Fahey, respectively).  Pursued by a beautiful immigration agent (Jessica Alba) and a seductive but deadly freedom fighter (Michele Rodriguez), Machete must fight to save his honor--and the lives of his people.

The performances are surprisingly strong throughout.  The film rests on Danny Trejo's broad, tattooed shoulders; fortunately, he IS Machete, with the tough attitude (and a surprising level of sensitivity) to carry out this role, even making it slightly more complex than it requires.  Seagal's Spanish is atrocious, but he is the embodiment of cool, even if he is far past his prime (I won't say his acting is good; it's Steven Seagal we're talking about, after all).  De Niro has made a lot of schlock lately, but he's clearly enjoying making a movie that's INTENTIONALLY campy.  Fahey oozes sleaze and cool; his slick-backed, gun-toting crime lord persona is arguably one of the better ones to grace the genre.  Alba and Rodriguez are both solid (Rodriguez usually is; for Alba, this is a pleasant surprise); it's nice to see female characters that avoid the typical eye-candy action role.

MACHETE is basically Robert Rodriguez at his best: pulling no punches, taking nothing seriously, just having a grand, gory good time.  It's an action movie with no logical plot or plausible character development; it's a movie where Lindsay Lohan appears in a nun costume, for God's sake (all of the puns intended).  We've also got Cheech Marin as a gun-toting preacher (""God forgives; I don't""); Don Johnson as a murderous vigilante; and Tom Savini as a professional assassin.  We've got a script that is good for what it is (and that's all it's supposed to be); and the co-directing by Rodriguez and Ethan Maniquis is frantic and fast-paced.  There are a few slow spots (hence the four stars) that hinder the movie, but ultimately, if you're a fan of grindhouse cinema (or just like a good, old-fashioned, no-holds-barred action thrill ride), MACHETE is a movie you will thoroughly enjoy.",1294012800,,2280,5.045333333333334

This isn't so much a review of the film itself, but of the product.  I'm writing to inform people of a future Double Dip.  In an interview in October 2010, Robert Rodriguez said that there is going to be an ""Ultra-violent Director's Cut"" of the movie to be released on home video.  No release date has been announced for that DVD yet, but I assume that version of the film will have the usual Rodriguez extras such as a commentary, a film school, and a cooking school (all of which are not on the current DVD/Blu releases).

1 DVD Widescreen Disc, being released January 4, 2010

""Machete"" was directed by Robert Rodriguez and Ethan Maniquis and is an expansion of a fake trailer for a film of the same name that was shown during the double feature ""Grindhouse."" If only more movies could be like this: cut into a trailer and the people either demand it or don't.

The premise is that an ex-Federale is hired for an assassination, but is then betrayed by the people who hired him who are trying to get a Senator re-elected by getting sympathy from the voters. Machete goes on a rampage of revenge with the help of the network.

""Machete"" is best when it embraces its genre. The campiness, the ridiculous amount of violence, gunfire, explosions, and gratuitous hot babes are all elements of what makes this movie work. The only parts that take away from the movie are the moments of seriousness where actors try to do something deeper with their performances. For example, Lindsay Lohan plays a slutty daughter of the man who hired and wronged Machete. Her back story is pretty bad, basically she enjoys putting nude photos of herself online to get attention for modeling and later takes a turn that gets her in a nun's uniform with a gun. The journey from point A to point B is a little painful, but if she could have just let herself go a little and rattle off one-liner's without being self conscious about it, she could have done better.

Danny Trejo as Machete has a face we all remember, though before now may not have remembered his name so vividly. He carries this movie with awesome action sequences and deeply buried emotions. He's a man's man getting it done and then randomly hitting it with hot babes who get naked for him. Does that part make sense? Heck no. Does it feel like a reward for years of supporting hitman roles? Hells to the yeah.

Jessica Alba plays Sartana Rivera, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agent trying to track down the network that helps immigrants led by ""She"" played by Michelle Rodriguez. Once Machete is framed for a crime he didn't commit and is able to gather evidence against his foes, Sartana switches gears to help him and get the real criminals who set this up behind bars. Both women walk the line of the tone of this movie very well. They hop between earnestly fighting for their goals, oozing sex appeal, and participating in crazy action scenes. Cheech Marin has a great short stint as the ass-kicking Padre.

The baddies are former ""Lost"" cast member, Jeff Fahey who is the man behind the curtain of the hire-up and main betrayer of Machete. His steel blue eyes and deep voiced resolve are perfect for setting up the movie. Robert De Niro is a little silly as a cowboy Anti-Immigration Texas Senator McLaughlin, but that fits this movie too.

What this movie did amazingly well as make sure to incorporate every scene shown in the original fake trailer! It would have been a little better at ""Grindhouse"" length, say 75 minutes or so and trimming down some of the fat (scenes getting too serious, slowing the story down). Definitely worth checking out for some crazy violence and action! For example, I looked away from the TV for a second and missed FIVE people getting decapitated at once. Whoa.

Bonus Features:

There is an audience track so you can listen to other people laughing and reacting to Machete decapitating people. There are five deleted scenes, some of which are a big surprise! Turns out Jessica Alba's character had a slutty twin whom she walks in on in bed with some guy often enough to be in two cut scenes. There are more scenes with our DeNiro politician where elements of the plot are explained to him (when they don't need to be).",1293840000,2,3905,4.632947976878612
4313905,2,B004B63M1S,"Never mind the comically obvious fact that this movie is basically a kind of political propaganda flick. Nobody can deny that. It's transparency can make getting the message across more effective because it is letting you in on what its up to, sort of like in-your-face, wink-wink-nudge-nudge ""we know You know"" blatant product placement. I suppose. Anyway what I want to say is the movie is simply not that funny, period. No the politics are not what ruined ""Machete"", for me anyway, so much as the way the politics were delivered. My Mexican-American friends didn't like the movie. Because it isn't very funny. Are we learning how Mexicans are persecuted and about corrupt, opportunistic politicians and white racism, etc., or are we doing a comedy inspired by grindhouse and blaxploitation flicks (which means some socio-political commentary)?
You can serve-up the laughs along with some soical awareness. Just look at a recent homage to blaxploitation called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Dynamite/dp/B002BWP3W0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Dynamite</a>&nbsp;to get the right idea. Dig it. And how about just more Machete killing and killing again and Desperado style fights. Brutal action, almost non-stop. But I loved ""Once Upon A Time in Mexico"" and ""Planet Terror""... one BIG difference - these movies had more entertaining characters, no? Having Johnny Depp, Salma Hayek, Willem Dafoe, Enrique Iglesias, Mickey Rourke, Eva Mendes and Rubn Blades in your picture helps a lot. Robert De Niro looks half asleep to me through many performances these days and he ain't funny. Lindsay Lohan...whatever. OK, Steven Seagal is funny and could have had a fatter role to play.

Look, the Machete preview was *art* as far as I'm concerned and Danny Trejo is still the man.",1293580800,5,1824,5.537634408602151
4313906,1,B004B63M1S,"Yawn. If you see people who defend the borders of their own country are cast as racist, brutal idiots and illegal immigrants are cast as heroes, I think you can guess what the movie is trying to get at.

Short Attention Span Summary:

1. We are introduced to Machete. It seems that he is going into a house to get someone out of it. Apparently he was set up and the people brought his wife there and killed her before his eyes. Somehow, he escaped from this.
2. Later, someone hires him to kill a Racist Government Official.
3. It turns out that he was setup for that, too. (Can a guy be so unlucky?) So, he gets shot, but manages to (a) survive; (b) get sent to a hospital that has Mexicans working for The Resistance; (c) shoot his way out of the hospital and get taken care of by a nice looking woman who runs a hotdog stand/ checkpoint of something like an Underground Railroad.
4. Next we get a very silly looking Cheech Marin as a drinking, potty-mouthed priest who is part of the Mexican Underground Railroad who helps with some logistics when Machete is going after the family of the man who set him up.
5. Machete does go somewhere and find the daughter and wife of the man swimming naked. He brings his ugly face out of nowhere and gets his freak on with these two fine looking women (yeah, right) and then kidnaps them.
6. A couple of people get killed (including the priest, who is crucified in the church and the Hot Dog Stand/ Mexican Underground Railroad woman who is shot in the face).
7. The Mexicans stage some sort of civil resistance (and it is at this point that I stopped watching because the movie was just getting so silly).

So, what do we have?

1. Silly casting. (Cheech Marin as a priest. Steven Seagal as, well, anything.) Danny Trejo, however, looked OK as Machete.
2. Annoying political tone. (Illegal Mexicans=good/ victims. Gringos= bad. Businesses= bad. Government defending its borders= bad.)
3. General plot implausibility. (How can someone with a machete be unstoppable, when people who have guns have so much less to do to kill someone? How can someone be shot in the neck and then jump of a second/ third story window out of a hospital and keep going, let alone take down 4 or 5 men with big guns? Give me a break.)

4313916,4,B004B63M1S,"Somehow it would seem appropriate that ""Machete"" the slightly subtle but affectionate lampooning of the exploitation thrillers of seventies gained It's roots from one of several pesudo-trailers that featured in the Tarantiono/Rodriguez collaboration ""Grindhouse"". Although wisely unlike SS ""Werewolf Women of the SS"" or ""Thanksgiving"" Rodriguez has chosen to make something out of this recent pet project. Casting regular and dedicated cast member, the fittingly leathery faced, time worn Danny Trejo as the titular protagonist allowing the actor to take centre stage for once, ""Machete"" is by contradiction a dumb, loud celebration of a bygone age of Americana while also being witty, knowing and self-referential.

It's safe to say that Robert Rodriguez is Mexico's closest answer there is to Tarantino a man who I can assume he has partially been inspired by and aided him to some extent in his rise to critical repute with a solid fan-base. Style akin to Tarantino is what permeates a film that chronicles the brutal and bloody tale of Federali officer Machete Cortez an honourable cop who paradoxically is also unflinchingly savage when forced to met out his own brand of justice, he's as the film with a lack of anything tenuous states is one who is a maverick willing to buck authority when necessity dictates. An act that leads to his seeming downfall when betrayed by his former boss who has allied himself with the merciless drug lord and socio-path Torrez played by an ever ageing Steven Seagal who has seen better days. Left broken and battered and emotionally scarred no doubt after witnessing his wife being decapitated before his very eyes, the movie skips three years after It's prologue to north of the border Texas where we find Machete scraping a living, performing yard work until an offer falls in to his lap from sleazy political aide Michael Booth (the criminally undervalued Jeff Fahey) who offers to pay him $150,000 to assassinate U.S. Senator McLaughlin (an ever reliable and funny Robert DeNiro). A man who's policies on immigration are rubbing a lot of illegal and legal immigrants up the wrong way. Of course as with the efficiently hackneyed plot might allow nothing is quite what it seems and Machte is enveloped in to a murky conspiracy with a a beautiful U.S. Immigration officer (Jessica Alba) and tough feisty immigrant and former freedom fighter Sh (Michelle Rodriguez).

Although it contains the bear semblance of a plot ""Machete's"" story merely serves as an excuse to push forward what is essentially a somewhat deceptively brainless send up which although done before is not any less entertaining as a result. Unapologetic in his OTT handling of the more violent aspects of the film and with fluid direction and a pace that runs smoothly and ably abetted by mainly solid performances by a fairly strong cast, Rodriguez knows what his core audience is after and he pretty much delivers in spades. If gratuitous violence, blood, guts and entrails with a light peppering of sex and nudity which were a hallmark of seventies exploitation films like ""Foxy Brown"" or ""Vanishing Point"" are the order of the day then you won't be disappointed. The Mexican auteur who's career in my opinion has been of one which is a fairly mixed bag delights and revels in the ludicrous almost cartoon world he himself has conceived, a world where an ageing, grist-led Federali is seemingly indestructible and can incapacitate or eliminate a horde of heavily trained gunmen with only a hand held machete as his weapon of choice. And in which such eye popping scenes which include one stand out moment where in desperation our hero does something hilarious involving a disembowelment will either make you simultaneously cheer and laugh in wonderment of the madness of it or just make you shake your head in bewilderment. Personally I was of the former.

Morosely however Rogriquez's notorious lapses in to self indulgence occasionally take precedent so that not only certain action sequences but the plot takes a twist that is not only a tad laughable but also lends it to feeling contrived and too nonsensical for words to allow. Coherence is given a wide berth in exchange for thrills and to forward It's straight forward simplistic narrative. While the inclusion of Steven Seagal, an actor with as much emotional range as one of his samurai swords when It's blunt smacks of cynical self referential casting, his performance is practically one note although he does manage at times to be a bit convincing in the taunting, sadistic antagonist stakes. Particularly when the film shifts in to It's final explosive act where Rodriguez practically throws in everything but the kitchen sink to mixed results.

The rest of the cast are mainly decent, Jesscia Alba while of course effortlessly sensual and the figure of most men's desires is competent enough (although I can't help but wonder if she was cast more for her aesthetics rather than acting talent) while Michelle Rodriguez makes for a memorable presence as Sh. DeNiro and Fahey are more than sufficiently smarmy, calculating and morally repellent in their respective villainous roles while Lindsay Lohan as Fahey's tempestuous and promiscuous daughter is revelatory proving that there is more to her than the score of hollow mundane teen flicks (with the notable exception of ""Mean Girls"") that she has been lumbered with. And who can forget Cheech Marin's amusing turn as Machete's ass kicking brother and man of the cloth who brings a whole new meaning to divine retribution.

Flawed as it might be ""Machete"" is still a solid popcorn flick with no real pretensions to really speak of and with Danny Trejo fittingly po-faced and sardonic as the movies tough title character I can think of worse ways to spend an evening at my local multiplex.

The characters are strong and perfectly cast (Lindsay Lohan anyone?) and Machete himself is one bad mother something something without even trying.  For me, the Machete ""mock"" trailer in the Grindhouse movie was one of the (few) highlights.  Glad to see the movie finally realized here and in such a flashy and epic manner.  Robert Rodriguez has always had a very distinct style and flair and Machete is definitely his stylistic masterpiece.  Every single aspect of the film comes together beautifully here.  The movie knows exactly what it is and doesn't take itself too seriously-but at the same time can also be very thought provoking when it wants to be.  Plus having the likes of Robert DeNiro, Don Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Jeff Fahey, Cheech Marin, Jessica Alba & Steven Segal in your film certainly doesn't hurt.  Danny Trejo is completely brilliant as Machete and really gives a performance worth rooting for.  Machete is easily the most fun I've had at the movies for a very long time.

I'll say it Machete isn't  The Godfather, Gone With the Wind,  Citizen Kane, Ect.
But, it's a  Raw Action Flick!
It's A True Homage to Classic 1970's Grind House Films
with a Big Budget and allot of Great A+ Actors
And without a Doubt the Best Over the top Violence in any Action Film!
I'm amazed the Film only got a Hard R ratting
Some of the kill scenes are just Crazy over the top But, it fits in this Looney Tune type Reality

The Stand Out Cast Members:

Danny Trejo is such a Unique character actor  he doesn't get to be the Good Guy/Hero enough!
He was Born to do this Film  he plays every  scene he was in straight I think a different actor would have Changed the whole Tone and Direction of the Film!

Robert De Niro as This Crazy  would be cowboy Tea Party Government official (Mr. De Niro's Part is also way out there I would have never guessed he'd take this Part But, he makes it all his own! By the end you so Hate him and what he stands for)

Steven Seagal as another main Villain much Like Robert De Niro takes on such a Different Role
Seagal makes one of the Best Bad Guys in all of Films in the Last 10yrs.
Even though he Passed on Stallone's The Expendables he gains major Respect for Taking on this Film!

Michelle Rodriguez without a Doubt Steals every Scene she is in! I Hope this Film gets her Career back on track
She has that ""It Factor""  this Film is Proof she is a versatile actress
She's Beautiful and can act and pull you in with every word! (That's a bit hard to do in a Film like this)
Hopefully she can keep her inner demons at bay and continue working.

Jeff Fahey is another Great choice  he makes a Unique bad Guy/ Dirty Old Man in love with his daughter

Cheech Marin can do no wrong he could read the Bible and make it Compelling & LOL Funny

Don Johnson is another WTF Actor who also steals every Scene and makes a Great Bad guy
Who Knew??

Lindsay Lohan is so/so in her Scenes but, i don't think she is Really acting!
But, You have to stand up and applaud her for in some ways maybe Committing Career Suicide
Only Cause this isn't No Family Friendly Kids Flicks it's Hardcore lol
I'm not sure why she passed on doing the Mother/Daughter 3-Sum scene

Tom Savini as  the 1-800-Hitman  is Classic to say the Least

Billy Blair  don't know much about him But, he has such a Different look I see him getting allot of Parts as the Crazy Psychopath
The Cast Alone is enough for anyone 2 at least check out
The Story:
  I was very Surprised Machete had a Very good Story it does have Social Commentary  hidden inside All the Blood and Gore
It was released in Theaters during that Huge Debate in AZ over illegal aliens
which still at this moment is being Debated like mad!

Over all The Film is Nothing Short then a Real Guys Movie
I wish more actions Films had the balls this film has
A Future Classic I'm sure of it

4313923,5,B004B63M1S,"MACHETE

As any one who knows me can tell you I am a huge Quentin Tarantino fan and a huge Robert Rodriguez fan, so naturally I love their work. This film being another Grindhouse type film especially since it was based on a trailer for that film is really fun. Any one who does not like violence, naked women, and violence should stay away. Also add in that I am a huge Steven Seagal fan and that this film was filmed here in Austin Texas, you know I loved it. This of course being another film QT and RR collaborated on, and yes they did QT was an uncredited producer. It should also be noted that Danny Trejo played this character in the three Spy Kids movies.

Machete [Trejo] is a man who has some what lost his way in life ever since a drug kingpin named Torrez [Seagal] killed his family. Since then he does hard manual labor for money until he is offered a hit. The hit of course is on a Texas politician [De Niro] who has a thing against illegal immigrants in Texas. When the hit goes bad as he was set up he goes back to his federale days and goes into kill mode. As the rampage goes on and every one from politicians, to priests, underground rebels, and US agents get involved the big players start to come out. That of course being the reemergence of Torrez as he is linked with Senator McLaughlin [De Niro], turns out they have a plan to own the drug trafficking in and out of Texas.

This is a wonderfully entertaining Mexploitation flick and is one of the best times I had at the movies all year. Every thing any one could want is in this movie, from great over the top action to some great romance [Machete sex music begins to play here]. The great over the top action is brilliant but one of the best parts has to be the exit from the hospital, any one who has seen it knows what I am talking about. The blood and violence of this are actually extremely well done, it is overly fun but at the same time isn't overly campy if that makes sense. In fact like many have said the opening scenes of the film let you know exactly what type of movie this is.

Danny Trejo is wonderful as if you didn't know as Machete and is right at home in this flick. He has been doing these types of roles for Rodriguez for years; in fact he has played Machete in the ""Spy Kids"" flicks. Jeff Fahey is masterful here looking like he is straight out of ""Pulp Fiction"" and having a weird thing for his daughter, and Robert De Niro looks like he has never had more fun in any other role. Now of course you know from the trailer that the ladies are here and looking oh so good while being oh so bad. Michelle Rodriguez has never looked hotter, man I love her so much, plus her character is really cool. Jessica Alba is fun here as well and to be honest surprised me a bit, she was kinda funny. Lindsey Lohan was another surprise here as I thought she did a good job with the time she got on screen.

Of course Cheech Marin is always great and here provides a lot of great and humorous scenes. But with every one in this [all of which were great and fun] I am going to have to say Steven Seagal stole the show a bit. Now I know all kinds of people are going to disagree with me but I thought he was hilarious. His last scene with Trejo is brilliant with the sword fight and all that, but his final bit of dialogue and actions are priceless. I have never laughed so hard ever, it was truly brilliant.

Directed by Robert Rodriguez and Ethan Maniquis and written by Robert and lvaro Rodrguez this movie was extremely fun, funny, and over the top. There are also some messages about this country and its politics but they don't beat you over the head. The style of the flick is much like that of the EXCELLENT ""Grindhouse"" film that RR and QT gave us so you know it looks great and has a great feel. I do recommend this flick to any and every one, BUY IT when it is released. I will be picking it up the second it is released, you should do the same.",1286668800,32,3937,4.146596858638744

4313926,5,B004B63M1S,"Having seen Grindhouse, I remember seeing a funny trailer for a movie called Machete.  I am not sure how the actual movie came about: whether this was an actual trailer or Rodriguez decided to make it due to positive comments on the trailer.  Anyway, I had been trying to find time to see this and I just saw it today in an empty theater.  I could not understand why since this film is one of the best action films I have seen in a long time!

This movie has everything from a great cast, intriguing and very timely plot and many beautiful women.  I was drawn in from the first five minutes and never able to catch my breath again until the end of the film.  Machete is a Mexican police officer doing a raid on one of the Mexican Cartel heads who has kidnapped a girl.  He is told over his radio to wait for backup before going in.  He tells his partner that he is not waiting for anything but is going in.  His partner is immediately killed but Machete is a one man army (like Arnold in The Terminator) against the bad guys.  When he finally gets to the girl he finds out that it is all a setup by his own boss.  The Cartel Head (Steven Segal) then kills Machete's wife right before his eyes.

Fast Forward three years and Machete is in Texas as an illegal alien looking to get by.  Don Johnson is the head of a border militia that guns downs aliens he captures and Robert DeNiro is a corrupt senator that goes on the hunt with Johnson.  Michelle Rodriguez is running a Taco stand while secretly involved in an underground network that gives passage to illegals to the United States and helps them find work.  Jessica Alba is an INS agent watching Rodriguez's stand while trying to catch her doing something that will lead to the head of the underground network.

Machete is approached by the Senator's advisor to assisinate the Senator for money.  He reluctantly agrees but is then set up to take a fall.  I don't want to give anything more away about the movie but it is loaded with highly violent and bloody fights including a lot of bad guys getting sliced, diced and gored by Machete's favorite weapon, the machete of course!

I loved this movie from start to finish and the ending announces two sequels (not sure if this was Rodriguez just making it up for this movie or if they were real).  If you love the old Charles Bronson Death Wish movies, you will definately love this film.  Highly recommended!",1285804800,5,2410,4.382882882882883
4313927,4,B004B63M1S,"If you're a fan of the over-the-top grindhouse tributes to the 70's style drive in action flicks, you're in for a treat.

Danny Trejo plays Machete, a former Mexican federal agent turned rogue vigilante who specializes in womanizing, destruction and of course, killing.  The plot really isn't important in this style of big screen action, but in case you're wondering, vengeance is the key theme.

One reason this yarn makes a lasting impression is the stellar cast.  Along with Trejo, you get Don Johnson as a red neck cop, Michelle Rodgriguez as the head of an underground vigilante group, Jeff Fahey as a crooked aide to a dubious government official, Jessica Alba as a hard edged agent with a soft side, Lindsay Lohan as a bad ass drug smoking daughter (what a stretch huh?) and Cheech Marin as a killer turned priest turned killer again.  Then throw in the added bonuses of Robert De Niro as a sleazy politician and Steven Seagal as the evil sword toting kingpin slash drug lord, and you've got the makings of cake with a whole lot of icing.

Furthermore, with Robert Rodriguez at the helm, you know you're in for a whole lotta out of this world action, ultra clever dialog, and sizzling hotties around every corner.

If you've seen the trailer, you know what the film claims it will deliver; and if you've seen the movie, you know it keeps the promise.",1285113600,7,1358,4.656903765690377

Much bleeding and nudity ensues.

Writer/director Robert Rodriguez shares his colleague Quentin Tarantino's fascination with the exploitation cinema of the 70s, but Rodriguez has a purer vision.  He may not elevate his material with frequently inspired dialogue, but he also does not distract from his story with awkward, self-indulgent homages.  Rodriquez delivers a fast, entertaining, fun movie that one could imagine seeing in a grindhouse theater.  Trejo is the Mexican Charles Bronson that we didn't know we were waiting for.  It's a shame the guy is already 66 (!), because I'd like to see him crank out one or two hard and dirty thrillers a year for the next 20 years.

This movie lives up to the other ""Grindhouse"" films--with it's exploitation and bloody, comic book like effects and action!

The movie is about how one hand washes the other between dirty US politicians and Mexican Drug Lords--using and betraying poeple on both sides of the fence--only to care about money and power.  It's a story about corruption,betrayal, revenge, poeple coming together, ""Messing with the wrong Mexican"" and, as Jessica Alba's character says, ""To do what's right.""

It's a film chuck full of great actors such as two LOST stars, Danny Trejo from Rob Zombie's DEVIL'S REJECTS, Tom Savini, Robert Di Nero, Cheech from Cheech and Chong and even Don Johnson!  Lindsey Lohan played a slutty, drug using daughter of a politican's lackee: so it wasn't much of a stretch for her to play! How she became a popular actress is beyond me! On the other hand, we did have the beautiful and very talented actress, Jessica Alba in the film--from such fame as Dark Angel, Sin City and the Fantastic Four Films.

4313933,2,B004B63M1S,"WARNING: THIS REVIEW IS FULL OF SPOILERS.

Yes, that's right. Aside from Inception and/or The Wolfman, I literally can't remember the last time I gave a movie on here 5 stars. OK maybe with The Wolfman I was being a tad generous, but OK let's move on.

I have a question for a lot of the positive reviewers on here: Did you REALLY like this movie, or are you just gushing out of respect for Rodriguez??? I'm a Rodriguez fan too, in case you didn't know. Tarantino and Rodriguez are the kings of b-movies. They know how to make a good b-movie and their extensive filmography has shown. With Tarantino you have Kill Bill, Jackie Brown and Inglourious Basterds, with Rodiriguez you have Planet Terror, From Dusk Till Dawn and the king of all things ""Visually gorgeous"", Sin City. What I love about both of them is that while their films are indeed exercises in Style Over Substance, they're aware of it and don't take themselves too seriously.

I still stand by Grindhouse as the most fun I've had at the theatre. Two great movies from two fantastic directors with some hilarious fake trailers thrown in there for the price of one. After ""Hobo With A Shotgun"", ""Machete"" showed. I laughed so hard! And then the news broke that Machete was going to be a full movie. I was excited.

Turns out, some fake trailers should just stay fake trailers.

As I mentioned earlier, Rodriguez's films are Style Over Substance. But they are aware of it, and don't take themselves too seriously, and for that, come off as awesome. Was this movie Style Over Substance? Yes. Did it follow its ""Don't take yourself too seriously"" rule? Well, it did... for the first 20 minutes.

I was liking the first 20 minutes. Even as a gore hound, I was wondering if I should be eating during that scene! Then of course, we get the awesome betrayal scene and the hospital scene... I especially loved when Machete cut the man's abdomen open and used his intestine as a rope to escape through a window. I laughed!!! Then it went downhill from there.

First off, Jessica Alba was annoying. Take her out of the movie and it wouldn't be different. All she does is just run around and scream the plot out loud. The most cringe worthy scene was near the end when she got up on the bonnet of the car and made that speech. That brought back memories of ""Robin Hood"" of earlier this year (you know what scene I'm talking about). Second, this film has too much plot in it, and too many characters. For a movie that's supposed to be a b-flick, this movie shouldn't be about political mumbo jumbo.

The characters are a big letdown here. Or at least the representation of characters. Let's begin. ""She"" is a great character. About halfway through the film she is killed off... then near the end she survived!!! Or the Priest. He is a likable character too. Then he gets killed off 5 minutes after his first appearance. Or what about Daryl Sabara's character? He's a funny guy and he has (what feels like) 30 seconds of screen time... and yet he's one of the main actors in the opening credits!!! Bigger yet, what about the villain? WHO'S THE VILLAIN? Is it Segal, who has a total of 6 minutes of screen time, De Niro, or Fahey, who easily out of the three supposed villains gets the most screen time... except he dies 10 MINUTES BEFORE THE CLIMAX. Or Lindsay Lohan... why is she even in there, other than the fact that she's Fahey's character's daughter??? The climax is a total anticlimax. There's no excitement in the battle at all, it's incredibly dull and boring. Even the iconic bit shown in the trailer with the bike was underwhelming. And Segal's character's death even felt copped out and lazy.

By the time the film was done, I was so glad I was out of the theatre. The film bored me enough with its slow pace. For a movie that claims to be an ultra gory action b-flick, there's about 10 minutes of action, 90 minutes of boring dialogue. This is supposed to be a b-movie, not some political crap. I like slow paced films, but not when they're supposed to be fun b-movies.

Sorry, Mr. Rodriguez, but I think your days are numbered!",1283817600,19,4091,4.508771929824562
4313934,5,B004B63M1S,"The fake trailer comes to life thanks to Robert Rodriguez. Danny Trejo stars as Machete, a bad ass who rarely speaks during the movie.

Some people may hate it though but I really didn't care. The movie looks censored, so it could get an r-rating, but im sure this dvd will be released uncensored. A very good, action packed film with the usual laughs. A must for action lovers.

Machete is a brilliant display of exploitation, actually a subgenre of grindhouse films called Mexploitation that celebrates Mexican life while dealing with drugs, crime, sex, and money.  Initially just a humorous teaser between&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Terror/dp/B001F0TM5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Terror</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Proof/dp/B001F0TM5I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Proof</a>, a combo from Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino, the story of an ex-Federale nicknamed ""Machete"" seeking revenge just had to be made as an homage film.  The result is undeniably entertaining.  The combination of incredible action without the dreaded shaky-cam, off the charts sexploitation, several humorous bits that heavy-handedly lampoon the incessant political hyperbole, ingenious use of everything within hand's reach for weapons, nudity or partial nudity from all just about all female cast-members (Rodriguez has never looked sexier and Alba is en fuego)...what's the point, this review could reach Moby Dick proportions if I listed everything I liked.  Needless to say, credits caused audible crowd celebration

For gorehounds, this movie will definitely, unequivocally not disappoint.  Ignoring the obvious plethora of decapitations and double-taps that produce enough blood to fill Seaworld, let me just say there is one brilliant scene in which someone gets eviscerated and his intestines are used for urban repelling.

The cast is unreal.  If someone had told me before this film that DeNiro, Seagal, Don Johnson, and Jeff Fahey were all bad guys, I would have been floored.  Believe it people, because Danny Trejo holds down the other side just fine with his low-rider Army headed by executive officers Jessica Alba and Michelle Rodriguez (Alba is an ICE agent and Rodriguez is a resistance leader).  The cherry on top is the combo of shotgun wielding priest played by Cheech Marin and hitman for hire played by Tom Savini.

Robert Rodriguez is responsible for just about everything awesome in this film, and it's pretty clear he enjoyed making it.  Several portions of the script are hilarious, and I'm still singing the chorus to the titular named song that accompanied Trejo through one of his carnage sprees.  The over-the-top nature of this film is pure gold that comes off as a cross between a Mexican version&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaft/dp/0790743752/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaft</a>, a low-rider car show, a more violent version of Bronson's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Wish/dp/B0000541AN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Wish</a>, and Cinemax softcore fun (except the leading man is a 60+ year old ex-con covered in jailhouse tats and coarse, scarred skin).  The only flaw is the political discourse which, contrary to what some other reviewers have mentioned, is far from forgotten or dismissed.  Nonetheless, one speedbump can't stop an avalanche of awesome.

I hope the fact that this started as a tongue-in-cheek teaser is inspiration enough to create at least one of the tongue-in-cheek sequels mentioned at the end of the movie.  We should all be so lucky.

4313936,4,B004B63M1S,"Machete sure delivered the throwback vibe to the exploitation flicks of the 1970's. They should have paired it up with Piranha 3-D and called it Grindhouse 2. Ever since the fake trailer in Grindhouse, fans have been calling for a feature length version, starring one of the toughest looking dudes to ever grace the screen.

It's about time Danny Trejo, who I can't believe is 66 years old, finally gets the lead role. While he plays a great quiet menace (few faces can strike fear with just one look), he is supported with maybe the best cast ever to be assembled for a pure trash (in the best sense) film. Robert De Niro, Steven Segal and Don Johnson all play villain roles and they seem to having a blast. This is Steven Segal's best work (not saying much I know, but he fit's the part) and Robert De Niro, who seems to be channeling some of his Cape Fear accent, hasn't done anything this memorable in the last decade. Of the three main female roles, only Michelle Rodriguez leaves an impact. Jessica Alba is okay, but not all that believable, and Lindsay Lohan's character seemed like an afterthought. Cheech Marin provided a couple of good laughs, one having to do with...you guessed it, a certain green substance.

I was worried the whole political message about illegal immigration would be too much, but it fit the mold of the story and didn't get too heavy. The script takes itself seriously for the most part, but there is a decent amount of humor. There was actually a bit more to the plot than I had expected going in, but don't worry, you'll still get plenty of lines made of only the sharpest cheese.

The fight scenes and gore are fantastic. Machete likes to lop off heads and body parts using his namesake, but that doesn't stop him from trying out the occasional pistol, corkscrew, pimped out weed wacker with saws for blades, hospital knives turned into a swinging mace, a mini-gun strapped to the front of a motorcycle, and many, many more. Did I mention that he uses some poor guys' intestine, while he's still alive, in order to jump out a window and reach the floor below? So sick, yet so undeniably creative. The fights are edited in quick Robert Rodriguez fashion, but you never really lose sight of what's happening to who.

On the downside, even though it didn't drag bad enough for me to check my watch, around 10-15 minutes could have been trimmed off to make it flow a little better. Oh, and what the heck happened to Tom Savini's character? He just vanished.

The movie ends by claiming Machete will return in the sequel, Machete Kills, and the third entry in the trilogy, Machete Kills Again. I guess it's really more of a joke, unless it does well enough at the box office.

This is the guy movie The Expendables wishes it was. I thought Stallone's effort was average, especially now, after seeing just one lone man with more raw toughness oozing out of his worn and scarred face than all those Expendable guys combined.",1283558400,3,2953,4.583333333333333

Well,this film does not dissapoint, full on action from start to finish starting with nudity buckets of blood and gartuitus violence,everything I wanted and expected Machete to be.

Fallow Machete as he hacks his way back to vengence while leading a revoloution. Hot women with guns and in skin tight leather pants. Who could possibly resist seeing Michelle Rodriguez or Jessica Alba in that?Plenty of laughs throughout,lots of inside jokes,puns and great cameos. Some of the funniest scenes were watching Steven Segal portray a Mexican drug lord and well...Lindsy Lohan not reallying portraying more than herself. A spoiled rich effed up crack whore. I wonder if she did that intentionally or had no clue  her character was the butt of the joke?

You really have to hand it to Robert Rodriguez, considering that the first to Grind House features were commercially unsuccessful, he went ahead and made another one. It just goes to show that he isn't in this just for the money, he truely loves film, creating fantastic over the top characters and telling great stories with style.

4313938,4,B004B63M1S,"** Couple of SPOILERS (shouldn't matter, but I warned ya) ahead **

The fake trailer to MACHETE was probably the highlight for me of GRINDHOUSE (2007) the intermittently entertaining Robert Rodriguez/Quentin Tarantino homage to 1970s exploitation cinema. Heck, all the trailers were cool and I'm glad to have HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN (best title of all time) to look forward to as well. Kind of weird though that anything more came out of that film, which received mixed critical response and generally poor box office. Well, I'm glad that Rodriguez said damn the critics and the public and went ahead with this, because MACHETE - though not exactly a masterpiece - easily beats out either of the two original GRINDHOUSE features, and helps to show, if there were any real doubt, that though QT may talk the exploitation talk (and talk, and talk...), it's his Texan buddy who walks the walk.

The opening could not be any better: a splatter and nudity-filled prologue to the film proper, as federale Machete (Danny Trejo channelling DEATH WISH 3-era Charles Bronson with pretty near total success) wipes out a dozen henchmen of drug kingpin Torrez (Steven Seagal), mostly with his weapon of choice but also with anything that comes in handy including an automatic with chopped-off hand still attached - but doesn't manage, at the end to save his wife from the same kind of fate that befalls most of his adversaries. Somehow he manages to escape a serious-looking cut to his groin area and the burning of the house; like a Bronson character, he doesn't need to vow revenge, we know he'll get it somehow.

Cut to several years later, as ex-cop Machete is now earning a living as a day laborer in Texas. A far right-wing state Senator (Robert DeNiro) is in collusion with a group of Minutemen-type vigilantes led by Don Johnson, and greasy Jeff Fahey hires Machete to kill him for loads of cash, which the taciturn tough guy instead gives to Luz (Michelle Rodriguez), owner of a taco stand and....

oh the heck with it. What's the point of going on about the plot?  A complex, involving story is not why you are watching this movie!  Suffice it to say that rough-looking, heavily tattooed and deep-voiced Machete spends most of the time cutting people up and blowing them away; we get to see him cut a guy open, pull out the intestine (a couple of minutes after a helpful lecture by a doctor) and then swing out a window with the unfortunate dude's organ as a rope; we get to see weedwhackers in action, a motorcycle-mounted gatling gun, a double-machete vs double-katana duel, a long soliloquy by a dying villain before he deliberately twists the blade imbedded in him all around his insides - you get the picture. And we get plenty of nudity and just-about, in the eye-candy form of Ms. Rodriguez, Jessica Alba, and Lindsay Lohan - among others. And a plot with some pretense of seriousness (the corruption of immigration/border issues) that is essentially jettisoned for action 75% of the time - in the best exploitation style.

MACHETE does run out of steam a bit, though it's mostly because Rodriguez and codirector Ethan Maniquis just want to pack too much in I think - a couple too many characters (we've also got Cheech Marin as Machete's shotgun-toting priest brother, Tom Savini as a hitman hired to stop Machete, lots of comic bits involving Fahey's henchmen and a few of Machete's allies, etc) and a last act that's just too drawn out and inevitable, even if we do get some excellent death scenes out of it. The acting isn't really ""good"", but should you expect it to be? No, not really. Fahey really seems to get his role and seems like he could fit right in as a slimeball in a 1973 blaxploitation film with Pam Grier or Jim Kelly; Cheech is good as well though he's not onscreen enough. And Seagal plays his villainous overlord exactly the same way he plays half the cop characters he's done - with arrogance and disdain - but it seems to work better in this kind of role I think. I wish more had been made of the 60something, not exactly handsome Machete getting to make it with every hot babe in the film - but maybe it's just as funny that it's not overdone; after all, we're used to stuff like this in every other action movie, Trejo happens to be just a bit more obviously outside of the male model category than Sean Connery or Clint Eastwood.

All in all, it's pretty damn fun. The tilt here is more towards action than satire, as opposed to last year's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Dynamite/dp/B002BWP3W0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Dynamite</a>&nbsp;which is drawing some comparisons. That film was one of my favorites of 2009, and though this might not make my top 10 for 2010, I'm glad there are a few people around who still know how to do something like old-school action - even if they do have to resort to parody to get it done.  Now I just need to get ahold of some Mexploitation flicks.

Long live Danny Trejo!",1283558400,4,4991,4.752886836027714
4313939,3,B004B63M1S,"There's no question that Robert Rodriguez's MACHETE is a lot of ""guilty pleasure"" fun.  There's a visceral pleasure to be had from a guy as outstandingly scary looking as Danny Trejo wielding a machete and severing heads and limbs, disemboweling bad guys and general leaving a trail of carnage in his wake.

All of these things were promised in the fake trailer for MACHETE which was presented prior to the start of GRINDHOUSE, the wonderfully crazy experience crafted by Rodriguez and his buddy, Quentin Tarantino.  Both men are drawn to the cheap thrill, to the idea of going just a little too far and over-the-top.  But Tarantino (PULP FICTION, KILL BILL, etc.) is extremely talented, a full tool box of skills at his disposal.  Rodriguez, on the other hand, mostly wields a hammer.  It's a stylish hammer, to be sure (see DESPERADO)...but his films don't feel like cheap and tawdry thrills delivered by a mad genius...they feel like exploitation flicks.  Often very fun...but also empty.

Trejo plays the titular Machete (a Mexican federale in hiding in the US after his family is slaughtered by a horrible drug kingpin, played by Steven Seagal) with about two expressions.  He's a wonder to look at and has a crazy charisma.  He's not much of an actor, but he's riveting nonetheless.  His scarred and pock-marked face is real, and he carries himself like a guy who earned those scars.  Thank goodness he IS so much fun to watch, because if his role were a failure, there would be little else to enjoy.  Machete is drawn back into the spotlight when he's framed by Jeff Fahey in an assassination attempt upon Robert DeNiro, who plays a Texas state senator who campaigns purely on the idea of driving out illegal immigrants and then putting up an electrified fence.  You will not be surprised to know that Fahey, DeNiro and Don Johnson as a border vigilante, are all actually teaming up with Seagal to control the flow of illegals, and to profit from their misery.

Machete is joined in his quest for vengeance by an immigration officer (Jessica Alba, once again proving unable to create a remotely believable portrayal of a human being), his brother who is also a priest (Cheech Marin, earning solid but obvious laughs) and a tough underground immigration supporter (Michele Rodriguez...looking mightily convincing wielding weapons).  Mayhem ensues, all of it bloody and noisy.  The film is gleefully violent, and usually only takes a break from the violence for some gratuitous nudity.  Lindsey Lohan shows up as Fahey's drugged-out daughter, and we get some body double nudity from her, in case you're interested.

The movie is pretty much what you'd expect.  The audience of mostly younger men and their seemingly reluctant dates (those who had dates) whooped and hollered and had a great time.  For myself, I kept wishing for wit that was a bit funnier, for visual flair that was more dazzling.  Rodriguez stages plenty of violence, but much of it is surprisingly clumsy and unclever.  In one scene, he takes a long close-up of a corkscrew.  Why?  So that you remember it when two scenes later, it is plunging into the eye socket of a bad guy.  The foreshadowing of weapons of destruction is this obvious throughout.  And the best action sequences occur in the prologue and in a relatively early scene in a hospital, where Machete uses a truly unusual method of escape.  As the film wears on, the scenes get bigger but they become less satisfying.

And imagine, if you will, 66 year old Trejo taking on a bloated and barely ambulatory Seagal in a climactic scene.  Yep, it was about as climactic as packing a lunch in the morning.  Tarantino is a master of finding great old stars and reinvigorating them in his masterpieces of mayhem (David Carradine in KILL BILL, Robert Forster in JACKIE BROWN).  Rodriguez seemingly wants to do the same with Seagal, but Steven Seagal was never a good actor even in his heyday.  DeNiro has minor amounts of fun in his role...but even the thrill of seeing him in such junk wears thin.  Fahey is generic.  Don Johnson has a bit of fun for awhile...but as with DeNiro, the fun wears off.  Only Michelle Rodriguez makes a real impression...she looks like a girl who would take no nonsense from anyone, and would handle herself well in a gunfight.  She is suitable support for the formidable Trejo.

I enjoyed myself for most of the film, but by the end, I had stopped laughing and smiling.  In many ways, that fake trailer from GRINDHOUSE packed all the entertainment of MACHETE into a 3 minute package.  I remembered it so fondly, and that helped me enjoy this film...but in the end, MACHETE just couldn't cut it for a feature lengthy film.",1283558400,14,4682,4.782067247820672

I'll admit that I'm biased against her, but that's only because she's a horrible human being.  Her performance was mediocre at best, her looks cannot compare to the other leading ladies, and most of all, her character was completely pointless as far as the story goes.  I can't understand why Rodriguez included her, and if someone can explain it to me, please do so in the comments.  He has demonstrated several times how great he is at making this type of film.  So it just baffles me as to why he'd purposely subject himself and his crew to working with her, and his audience to watching her.

That can only mean that Machete is now in theaters and Alex Jone's Helter Skelter prediction has come true.  That's right: this film is so damn cool that the trailer alone convinced a right-wing media maniac cursed with the power to constantly (and hysterically) predict things that never ever actually come to pass that racial Armageddon was upon us and that our gardeners and housekeepers were plotting against us all along.  This movie was to be the signal.  Be afraid, my Caucasian friends.  Be very afraid.  Oh, wait.  Sorry.  Turns out it's just a cheesy summer action film and everybody who saw it had a great time.  My bad.

Machete began it's life as a spoof trailer presented in between films during the massive box office failure that was Robert Rodriguez/Quentin Tarantino's ""Grindhouse"" double-feature.  If you'd told me that the 70's exploitation homage starring Danny Trejo would spawn it's own feature film, I'd have said ""I wish"".  Wish granted.  And then some.  While the finished product is probably too slick to be properly considered grindhouse material, it is almost certainly the baddest, bloodiest, sexiest, most hardcore, and most controversial film of the summer.  I hear this this other little star-studded action film homage thing out this summer.  Well, said film is likely to have expended it's popularity a matter of months from now, while Machete looks to be a cult classic shoe-in that will be enjoyed for years to come.  This movie is phenomenally entertaining at every level.

Let's start with the cast.  Imagine an action film with Robert DeNiro, Steven Seagal, and Tom Savini.  That is three very different shades of awesome right off the bat.  And those are just the villains.  Topping the incredible cast is man-god Danny Trejo (FINALLY headlining) with Cheech Marin playing his brother, but that is still not all.  Man cannot live on sausage alone so we get Michelle Rodriguez in her hottest role to date and the unconscionably sexy Jessica Alba to boot.  Also Lindsay Lohan, looking much less gaunt and strung out than in recent years and much more like the sweet thing she used to be.  In fact, this is probably the sexiest female cast ever assembled on top of the killer selection of leading men and they are taking full advantage. Yeah, I'm going to rain on some parades and call this the best cast in an action film yet.  Deal.

Also in the win column (which is a loooong column) is the tone of the film itself.  Rodriguez is simply the best action director in the business, but he also has one of the best sense of humors out there.  Machete comes off not only as a modern 70's exploitation homage and a BOLD statement against the media-fueled hatred and bigotry that persistently plagues non-white immigrants; it's also very funny.  Whenever the hero is about to get his groove on, the audience is treated a porntastic funk flourish while the rest of the film is peppered with an agreeably seamless combination of hard rock and traditional Mexican music.  Rodriguez scores are always fabulous.  And while the immigration issue is handled with all of the subtlety and nuance of a weedwhacker, the satire and celebration of Mexican culture is sure to raise a lot of smiles in certain communities.  Trejo leading a brigade of gaudy lowriders bumping hydraulics or taking on armed guards with an assortment of gardening tools is just too funny any way you look at it.  Let's not forget that this movie is not aiming to be an intellectual assessment of the current political climate in America (although it does a surprising job of summing it up and some of this stuff is not entirely fiction); it's just a rollicking good action flick deliberately extending it's middle finger to people who are frankly too stupid to even deserve to see a film this fun.  There's always that other movie for those people.

Machete is a character that combines everything you love about heroes like Shaft, El Mariachi, Rambo, and Dirty Harry and cranks it up to levels previously unheard of.  He gets the girl.  He gets all the girls.  He kills the bad guys.  All of them too.  And most of all, Machete don't text.  Because texting is for losers.  Want more onscreen sex and violence than the other flicks will give you?  Bam!  It gives you every ridiculous thing you saw in the Grindhouse trailer and much, much more.  I'm talking about intestine-swinging, decapitating, seppuku-tastic, eye-shooting, machine-gun motorcycling, pure goddamn cinematic badness through and through.  All that and harsh political commentary from a director who is not afraid to stick up for the little guy in the biggest possible way.  This is likely the best thing I'll see on the big screen all year.  And it didn't even start a race war.  That's what I call a win-win, baby.",1283472000,6,4903,4.8189448441247

8421531,5,B004B63M1S,"One of the funniest and most entertaining films that I have seen in awhile. If you are expecting a run-of-the-mill action movie, forget about it. Machete is really a comedy disguised as an action movie. There are tons of stars in this movie, although few are known for their excellent acting skills. Lindsay Lohan does pretty much what she does best, play a sex-obsessed junkie that is naked in most of her scenes.

Steven Segal is hilarious (perhaps unintentionally) as a Mexican drug lord hell-bent on killing Danny Trejo's character. Steven Segal has tried passing himself off as a lot of different races and nationalities... Japanese, Native American, Russian, etc. Seeing him trying to speak with a Mexican accent is absolute comedy gold though.

Deniro does a spectacular job straddling the line between dramatic acting and comedy. Playing a politician in this movie, it reminds me a lot of the film Wag the Dog. I have no idea what Jessica Alba's family background is, but I am pretty sure that she is not Hispanic. Watching her trying to act Hispanic is just hilarious. She must have spent weeks in a tanning booth to get ready for this part.

The plot of the movie makes total sense, which is odd for what I would characterize as a B-Movie. The script was obviously custom tailored for the specific actors in this movie. Since Rodriguez uses the same actors in many of his movies, that makes total sense. The comedy timing and overall pace of the film is about as close to perfect as you can get. It was meant to be more of a parody of 1970's action films than anything else. Nothing in the film is really taken seriously and it's all 100% pure entertainment. You are either going to love this film or hate it. Anyone who hates it clearly has no sense of humor.",1521331200,,1770,4.612698412698412

Even Danny Trejo seems flat which is crazy given how much charisma this guy has. What the heck are Robert De Niro and Don Johnson doing in this film? Steven Segal is totally ridiculous in this one. Great female actresses too. Anyway seems like all the ingredients to make a awesome action flick are there but somehow it just doesn't come together. The social commentary is interesting given what is going on with Trump.",1514332800,,558,4.534653465346534
