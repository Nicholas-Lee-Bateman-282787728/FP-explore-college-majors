I'll admit - I'm a big fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger because he doesn't take himself too seriously - so instead of being cheesy, his movies come across off as self-deprecating.

This movie reminds me of an Ahhnold movie. A ridiculous premise, a very obvious low budget ($2000), but in the end, a hilarious ride. There is drama, there is comedy, and replete throughout the movie is a lot of homages and self-jabbing at movies that take themselves too seriously.

Buy it. Watch it. And share this movie. It's awesome.",1362182400,5,580,4.611650485436893
5540424,1,B00B0LKVIY,"80's nostalgia aside this very bad, speaking specifically about 80's nostalgia, there is a difference between making a nostalgic piece and making a piece that is no better than the 80's despite the intervening 3 and a half decades of cinematic advancement. People praising films like this and Sharknado while nitpicking at multi million dollar projects is the reason cinema is in decline although it  is probably just a symptom of intellectual decline in society.

Undoubtedly filmed in a grueling three day shoot in front of a greenscreen, this special effects extravaganza sets a new standard for storytelling. A hero will rise. A team will rise. A bad guy will rise too. And be defeated. Thank you Manborg. Robocop who?",1506729600,,389,4.6521739130434785

5540427,5,B00B0LKVIY,"This movie is an homage to live action video games and 80's/90's action sic-fi schlock but it has a ton of heart and the cast is extremely endearing.  It manages to be consistently funny and awesome, all while maintaining a really distinct aesthetic and wearing its influences on its sleeves.  I went in expecting something unintentionally funny due to being ""so bad it's good"" but instead I ended up watching a genuinely fun, well-made movie that proves that a low budget does not equate to low quality.

Loved it, and I think if you give it a chance with an open mind you just might as well.",1506470400,,593,4.5233644859813085
5540428,5,B00B0LKVIY,"Honestly, one of the best pieces of cinema I've seen in the past 10 years. The fact that they didn't finance the second one is a travesty. With all of the garbage that has come out in the last decade, this was a pure soul of the creative essence. 10/10

The fact is this movie was made with $1000, for $1000 this looks incredible. I bet modern movie studios couldn't make this with $1000. The talent of cinema and the materials to produce a movie are absurdly expensive, and the whole time I was amazed.

Even some of the minor artistic choices, the stop-motion blended with the real-time, the throat dub, the action shots, I wish I could see what they would've done with $2000. A bold move to make something they loved to make.",1506211200,2,728,4.385185185185185

5540431,1,B00B0LKVIY,"not bad enough to be bad in a good way.  The cliche aspects were just not played up right...could have been good, but too much was attempted with too little.  For instance, the over-the-top voices didn't really work.  Kung Pow and Kung Fu Hustle would be good examples of over the top play on cliche themes, but this is just not quite there.  Things are sped along with characters that just can't carry the plot.  Even though the 2 dimensional characters lack the development to match the stories pacing.  The villains aren't funny or scary, which further makes it hard to engage with the story.",1505606400,,595,4.619047619047619
5540432,5,B00B0LKVIY,"Many movies with plots just as simple and ridiculous as Manborg's are made with 100's of millions of dollars, and they take themselves 100% seriously, and people lap it up. If you're bored as hell like I am with what passes for ""Sci-fi action"" in Hollywood, and even ""off-Hollywood"" then you will find Manborg 100x more watchable. I would say that you have to be ""OK"" with subpar effects, but that's a huge part of the point and of the experience, so you have to be more than ""OK"" with that. That said, the creature makeup and costuming are actually pretty great.

I would agree with the comparison to Kung Fury, but I would actually rate Manborg a bit better than that one for managing to make its absurd characters more than just jokes. I would love to see more just like this!",1505260800,3,779,4.4475524475524475

5540439,5,B00B0LKVIY,"I figured I'd hover over the seek bar and skim this movie for giggles. I ended up watching the movie. It wasn't that the story was overly compelling. It reminds me of when sound equipment became less expensive, and people became able to record their own music for a small investment. This is the same idea, but now that video production and distribution tools are available to regular people, we see the same DIY sub sub sub genres created.

Sure, you could just say this is an indie film, but then you might be expecting a certain aesthetic. The film uses recognizable memes to substitute for in depth character development. It plays like somewhat of a fanfic adventure movie wherein recognizable cultural memes from various video game and popular movies meat in order to undertake a heroic journey.

The makers of the film very consciously exploit any and all film and storytelling techniques to make the best use of the limited resources they have.

The best thing I could say about this movie is that it embodies the DIY ethic that makes punk rock and barbecue pits so enticing and appealing.

Don't expect your world to be rocked, but do expect to be curiously entertained by the creative usage of limited resources to be able to get a film to a platform where millions of people can see it.

The horrible plot, the terrible acting, the non-sensical characters and the distressingly bad special effects.  The dialogue, along with the annoying voice of the male blonde idiot, along with the droning voice of the bad kung-fu-movie-wanna-be star; not to mention the seemingly autistic-like behavior voice and mannerisms of Manborg himself, all left me disappointed and upset; luckily I didn't have to pay to watch it; I wish I could get my 77 minutes back...",1504483200,,736,4.7265625

It looks like a bunch of film school drop outs took acid and hacked this movie together in PhotoShop CS2! The characters seem to be green-screened then superimposed into oversaturated CGI scenery. Then most of it is played back at like 12 frames per second to give it a super cheesy old film effect. Reminds me of some of the crap I've scene on Adult Swim. Somebody spent a decent amount of time and money to give this movie the appearance of being cheaply made. I'm not even sure what this movie is about.  Apparently, Dracula is the king of Hell and he overthrows Earth with an army of satanic robots or something like that.

5540460,3,B00B0LKVIY,"Manborg reminds me a lot of John Carpenter's Dark Star and that's a huge compliment. Both films are lovingly jokey about the material they are sending up and seem to want to please the audience. Where Manborg diverges is it's love of all things 80s VHS as well as a love of 90s era nerd kitsch. The film takes place in world you'd see in a video game like Doom or Mortal Kombat. Army men, robots, anime influenced cute girls, mad scientists, demons, and general monsters all come together to fight it out in a HR Geiger meets Blade Runner style world. Oh and the guns have guns attached to them with extra guns. It's a bit like Will Smith's guns in Suicide Squad that had 4 or 5 different sights on them cause sometimes you need a mini reflex sight on your ACOG with a couple of sets of canted iron sights for good measure. Since the guys who worked on this movie went on to work on the Oscar winning make up crew on that movie it makes sense. If you noticed I quit talking about the story, it's cause the story is the least important thing here. It's mostly an excuse to show off their serious skills as film makers.

It's all told very tongue in cheek and they know they're being silly. It also about an hour long. It never really wears out it welcome. It just doesn't quite all gel at least for me. It's a little less than the sum of it's parts. However, man is it amazing what they got out of probably less than a million Canadian dollars. Seriously, these guys are talented. So is the cast. I've seen them pop up in other films/shorts from these guys, which after watching The Void by them I decided to check out all the work of everyone involved with this Astron 6 group. You know you're seeing some people going places when you can still gush about something that didn't completely work for you.

5540466,4,B00B0LKVIY,"Proving that they can be both funny and entertaining when they put their minds to it, the Canadians of Astron-6 made ""Manborg"" for about $1,000. Don't let the bare-bones budget scare you off: despite cheesy special effects and obvious corner-cutting, the film is quite well done and is certainly entertaining, especially if you happen to enjoy gentle mockery of and homage to numerous 1980s films such as ""Robocop"". Here we discover that the evil Count Draculon and his minions conquering Earth. There is lots of fighting and insane action and at one point we see a soldier die at the hand of Draculon, which presages some restoration with power tools (think ""Robocop"").

Number One Man and Justice are strange prisoner buddies and Manborg joins them in the joint (I was especially fond of the astonishing voices and dubbing) where we're also introduced to Mina, the local hottie. Prisoners here have to fight gladiator style, but fortunately Manborg has both a giant afro and a machine gun hand, which is hard to control. Dr. Scorpius controls these fights and also created Manborg. In short order we see an exciting scene of water boiling, the worst Australian accent ever filmed (from Justice, and which always made me laugh), and Mina going off to the Genesis Tower to fight Draculon. (""It's never too late to be a hero!"") The training montage is hilarious, and eventually the fight ends up being Manborg versus Draculon, which was a foregone conclusion, while the other three good guys duke it out with the evil henchmen (I particularly enjoyed Justice's ""dancing shootout"" scene). It's no surprise that in a team effort Draculon is defeated, but at a high price: Mina is dead. Fortunately Manborg has the ability to revive her, but at the cost of his own life, dying a hero. This is a lot of movie for $1,000!

For such a low budget property, this DVD has a lot of extras: there are deleted and alternate scenes, bloopers, a behind the scenes feature (which is fairly boring, honestly), a visual effects montage (which is modest but interesting), and a short film ""Fantasy Beyond"" featuring a stop motion monster man versus rock and roll cops in an art gallery (I particularly liked this). There are also some interviews, a question and answer session, and a trailer. All in all a very nice package.",1473552000,3,2305,4.832911392405063

It's a combination of ROBOCOP+ TERMINATOR+ PLAYSTATION+ANIMATION+LIVE ACTION and some serious action cool SCI-FI movie, an Ultra Low budget cinema here.
And the result was there seems to be a lot, I mean a lot of followers out there that made him possible to make another movie like this.

The movie is nothing that you've seen before.
At the beginning, you need some time to adjust to the look.
Then you will be crazy about it.
The computer graphic of the city neon lights and the fighing shots are all great considering they kind of look a little like computer game as well as live action.

Yes the movie is very light hearted nothing serious like TERMINATOR.
The charactors are funny and not that serious.
Only the Manborg seems serious but from time to time he is also joking too.
But above all, this is not a joke.
The future, the enviornment is not a joke.
They need to save the world.
Just like any other SCI-Fi movies.
Yes, there are blood scattering.
There is a bit of love.
There is street fight sequence and they are super cool.

5540481,3,B00B0LKVIY,"Everything about this movie is stupid and cheesy and over-the-topbut for some people that works.  You know who you are.  ;)

Kung Fury (2015) meets Mutant Hunt (1986) with a dash of cracked out Robot Chicken (2005-present) and Flash Gordon (1980) in this trashy collage of schlock, super cheap effects and stop-motion creatures.

So here's the short synopsis by IMDB:  ""A soldier, brought back to life as a cyborg, fights alongside a band of adventurers against demon hordes in a dystopian future."" If that doesn't make you want to see this movie entirely on its own, then you probably shouldn't watch this.

""Earth, the legacy of the Hell Wars when mankind fought the armies of Hell and Hell won With every passing hour, another nation crumbles to the technological might of this unholy menace, and their monstrous leader Count Draculon.""

The film is choppy and it appears as if actors are being greenscreened over a 1990s videogame backdrop as soldiers battle Doom zombie pseudo-Nazis with laser guns and stop-motion monster zombie shock troopers.  In fact, this feels a lot like watching a videogamewhile on drugs.  One brave man in the battle field goes toe-to-toe with the evil warlord Count Draculon (a Nazi vampire demon from Hell?) and is left for dead.

This man becomes Manborg (Matthew Kennedy; Father's Day) in a cybernetics montage.  Laser hoverboards, combat droids, cheap computer graphics, even cheaper costumes, and a Liu Kang-ish martial arts-y sidekick named #1 Man mix nicely into this persistent assault on good tasteor a delightful bubble bath of bad taste, depending on your preferences.

Manborg is captured and forced to battle in the evil Nazi zombie fighting pits.  Their champion is a giant claymation monster with laser rocket launchers.  I loved the claymation, however bad it was.  Speaking of ""bad"" this film was both bad and delightful (to lovers of bad films).  It had a budget of $1000. 1000 DOLLARS!!!!!  That in mind, this is actually quite impressive.

Massively cheap and grossly overacted, Manborg is an homage to 80s schlock trash cinema directed by Steven Kostanski (Father's Day, ABC's of Death 2 ""W is for Wish"").  At times the ultra-low budget and ultra-badness of it all was a bit exhausting.  Other times it was weirdly refreshing.  I especially enjoyed The Baron's lines, attempts at romantic courtship and awkward demeanor.  Attempts at gore, however cheap they may appear, were abundant and suitably messy and gross to match the trashy scale of the rest of the film.

This film even made an attempt at a plot.  You see, Manborg was actually created by the same mad scientist who accidently opened the gate to Hell in the first place.  So, he made Manborg to combat this infernal evil from Hell.  While doing so, Manborg delivers loads of tropes from 80s trashy action badness along with digital future-scapes and weird special effects galore.

This is CLEARLY not for everyone.  But for some of you (the schlock lovers), this may be just what you need.",1437350400,3,3003,4.963927855711423

5540491,3,B00B0LKVIY,"Even though my rating is 3 stars, I do recommend this film.  It's worth watching, but it's not for everyone.

+1 star: For what has been accomplished on a shoe-string budget.  The costumes, the special, effects, and the post production shows that Astron-6 can put together a complete film. While this movie suffers a little from poor lighting and a shallow range of  sound effects, they did a fantastic job with what they had.  Bravo.

-1 star: For failing to be so-bad-it's-good.  This movie is a parody and/or a homage to the '80s B-movie action film genre.  It doesn't take itself seriously and purposely goes over the top.  These attribute disqualify the movie from obtaining the coveted so-bad-it's-good label.  A truly so-bad-it's-good movie must be genuinely trying to be a good movie yet fails.  This movie is purposefully campy.

+1 star: For capturing the essence of the genre.  This feels like a B action movie from the 80s. The opening and closing credits are spot-on.  The music perfectly sets the mood.  The stop-motion animation is wonderful.  The crazy plot is exactly what you would want at 1:00am while channel surfing past infomercials.  The concepts for the costumes and set designs are on par with those films from 30 years ago.  This is where the movie really shines.

-1 star: For not being a good campy movie.  Good campy movies have great delivery of bad acting and dialogue.  This film lacks the great delivery part of the equation.  It's easy to have bad acting when you have bad actors, and much of the dialogue is just plain bad.  Many of the bad moments feel like youtube schtick or hacky student films.  However, they did a good job of using these faults to their advantage.  Manborg's dialogue is the only aspect of this movie that is so-bad-it's-good. The Baron's running gag is pushed far enough to make it funny.

+1 star: For being intentionally funny.  There are some great gags in the movie with decent timing.  Justice's stereotyping was great.  Mina's action cut-scenes were perfect.  Manborg is anything but stealthy.  #1 Man's over-dub made me laugh every time.  The absurdity of the world that was built. Count Draculon - need I say more?

This movie fell short of my expectations because I wanted the unintentional laughs of a so-bad-it's-good movie.  Instead, I got the intentional laughs of merely OK campy movie.  With a little more polish, I would bump this up to 4 stars.  After taking everything into consideration, I was genuinely impressed with the final product.  I look forward to hearing this movie be recommended when these guys are working on future Hollywood blockbusters, so I can say, ""I saw that, and you should see it too.""",1414195200,,2685,4.809210526315789

5540501,2,B00B0LKVIY,"""Manborg"" has an outstanding B-movie DVD cover art package that really led me to believe that something unique was going on inside of the film's content. Unfortunately, this is not a film, but rather a glorified video game. It's far dumber than I was expecting it to be. Now I can sympathize with the filmmakers and their intention (they are clearly 80s/90s video store nerds, and I understand where they're coming from really) but considering the fact that there is no script, only ham acting, poorly designed sets (which were professionally created on a cheap computer set-up), and slop-shop dialogue (along with some of the silliest characters I've ever seen in any film), I would be ballot-stuffing if I gave this heap anything other than 2 stars (and that's for the packaging!). Starts out promisingly (sort of) with a war sequence which leads a viewer to believe that this will be a warped Dracula movie set during a World War 2 era, but then things quickly go haywire, and we learn we are now in the future (?). Nothing here makes much sense. Too bad, because the initial concept could have been a tribute to sick cinema (such as ""Robocop"") but as such it's just crap.

5540502,3,B00B0LKVIY,"Ultra low-budget comedy Manborg is made by a Canadian five-member filmmaking group Astron-6, and the film grew out of their love for the 1980s genre movies like Eliminators and The Running Man (see the groups name and logo that is clearly inspired by the now defunct company Vestron) as well as old-fashioned video games and other pop culture.

The film is about a young soldier (Matthew Kennedy), who, after getting killed in the fight against the hells army of Count Draculon (Adam Brooks), wakes up to find himself changed into Manborg, super-soldier equipped with battle armor. When Manborg has to fight alongside a band of ragtag fighters, however, he is the least reliable one, not knowing what to do with his new mecha-body.

Manborg is a comedy with interesting twists to genre conventions. The films cheesy effects are all intentional. Characters all fight against a green screen. One Bruce Lee/Kenshiro-like character speaks with badly dubbed voice.

But amusing as they are, those jokes are not enough to sustain the feature film. Once you get the point of the film, you realize that the film has little to offer besides these tongue-in-cheek parodies. Manborg is a great homage to the old 1980s films, but beyond that there is not much to say.",1395273600,,1255,4.938388625592417

It's a movie with actual characterization, charm, genuinely funny writing, some stellar editing, and just wonderful practical effects.

I could write page after page in its praise, but I'll just say that it is impossible to have a bad time watching this.  Once Manborg teams up with Number One Man, Justice, and Mina, the movie becomes non-stop fun.  There are stop-motion monsters, arena fighting, hover bikes, kung-fu, transformer guns, anime-fights, and some legitimately great make up work.

I suspect this is because in near future sci-fi films like Robocop there's still plenty of character development while in far future sci-fi films the special fx usually take center stage leaving little room for character development.  This was not the case at all with Manborg, though admittedly it is only a little over an hour long.  But what an hour it was!!!!!  For this price you really should give this movie a chance.

5540515,4,B00B0LKVIY,"There are generally two types of modern throwbacks to the grindhouse films of yore. I tend to favor the more fervent such as Jason Eisener's masterpiece, Hobo With A Shotgun. Hobo shows so much love, sincerity, and aspiration for its inspiration that it easily surpasses the foundation laid 40 years ago. The other type of shoutout, the silly, over-the-top, ironic comedy, usually misses the mark painfully. The folks that make up Astron-6 may walk the path of the absurdly goofy wink and nod, but they are proving themselves to be the best at it.

Manborg is the story of a soldier who has been killed in battle against an invading army of demons from Hell lead by Count Draculon. He awakens years later rebuilt and ready for revenge. Changed to be both Man and Borg, his name is Manborg. Count Draculon now reigns supreme over one of the last major cities on earth, and forces humans rounded up on the streets to battle in an arena for entertainment. Whether or not he was also the one to make them dress up as awful Street Fighter cosplayers is never brought up.

Manborg is captured and forced to battle demons alongside his newfound friends as they struggle against an increasingly unentertained Count.

Manborg will require some patience. The first thing that you notice is how much of a blurry mess the whole thing is. It looks like a flip phone camera recorded this off of another flip phone screen that was smeared in vaseline. The opening scenes are so chaotically edited and stitched together that it will hurt your brain. The film is almost completely green-screened behind real actors, and the amount of different layers projected on the screen and how they interact will make your eyes bleed. Foreground and background images move independently of each other. Each layer disregards camera movement in its own spastic way. All of this seems unbearable, but only until your brain adjusts to the schizophrenia.

Once you are introduced to the characters, all of that obnoxious visual noise fades away. The comedic timing applied to genuinely hilarious dialogue replaces tears of pain with tears of pleasure. The character comedy is the highlight. None of the characters exist to just be joke delivery systems. Each one has clearly defined personas and the comedy falls in line accordingly. None of the gags are throwaway, either. Manborg's every move is a beautiful labor of pain with mechanical whirls and gears grinding all the way to the very end. #1 Man, the Liu Kang wannabe, is voiced by another person whose vocals have been laid over the original audio. This all shows an attention to detail that comes along very rarely to comedies.

For such a visually ugly film, it does have its highlights. The stop motion bits are fantastic. They certainly aren't the most polished, and the frame counts look quite low, but they have an awesome style to them that adds a lot of character to an already character-packed film.

Overall, this is a very silly film filled with intelligent writing and clever gags. While it won't be everyone's cup of tea, Manborg deserves its place on the mantle of every offbeat comedy lover.",1374278400,6,3130,4.830223880597015
5540516,4,B00B0LKVIY,"To think that this was made for about $1000 bucks is pretty astonishing. That is not to say this film, ehh, umm, video (shot on Hi-8) is an incredible work of art. It certainly is not, and the film makers (Canada's Astron-6) know it. But taken in the spirit it is intended, it is an enjoyable, short (a brief 70 mins.) piece of fluff entertainment. The special effects, make-up, and costumes are all undeniably homemade looking.  This will never be confused for a big-budget Hollywood action movie. But that's not the reason to see ""Manborg"". The real reason to see it is to watch what can be made for so little money, but with a lot of heart and passion, the two things that seem to be missing from those big-budget Hollywood movies. So if your thing is big, polished blockbusters like those that Michael Bay is well-known for (and that's fine), than you'd be probably better staying away from ""Manborg"".
Despite its limited resources (a tattered green screen, shot almost entirely in mom & dad's basement with outdated video equipment), ""Manborg"" is a triumph in micro-budget indie filmmaking.

5540519,5,B00B0LKVIY,"I have always been a fan of the straight-to-video movie. The 80's and early 90's were a particularly strong time for them as home video became a reality and studios popped up everywhere delivering cut price product that would be snapped up by customers who had already watched all of the big new Hollywood releases. It was an exciting time as companies like Empire Pictures and Cannon Films let filmmakers with big ideas take a shot at letting them make them a reality even if they did not have the money of their big studio counterparts. What resulted was a ton of ambitious if not always successful sci-fi, fantasy and horror that even sometimes managed to push the envelope further than the big boys in Hollywood but with a fraction of the budget and manpower. It is these movies that inspired Steven Kostanski and the rest of the Astron-6 crew to make Manborg.

A grueling three years of shooting on weekends and between other projects, then editing together and putting together the special effects, Manborg is a true labor of love. The resulting movie is not for everyone, obviously this movie was made for very, very little money and one shouldn't expect the best looking special effects or costumes. What you do get however is a movie that really feels like an homage to the films that inspired it without making fun of them. Kostanski and crew were not looking to get cheap laughs off deliberate kitsch value and cheesiness, this movie is full of jokes and is genuinely very funny. There's still plenty of action thanks to Konstanki's skill with cheap CGI and stop motion animation, this is without a doubt a movie that looks like totally unlike anything else that's coming out in 2013.

Not only do you get that snappy sci-fi action extravaganza but you also get a short film after the end credits, a mock trailer for BIO-COP. If you've ever enjoyed that particularly nasty kind of gore where people melt into ooze and it's all ridiculously over the top gruesomeness you will get a big kick out of BIO-COP. Also on the DVD is another short film, bloopers, deleted scenes and so on. My favorite extra by far is the interview segment which highlights the seriously bizarre and off-kilter sense of humor you can expect from Astron-6.

Support independent genre cinema! Even if you're not a fan of low-budget fare like this, you really have to admire the work that went into it getting made. I can't recommend it highly enough.",1367798400,3,2433,4.706572769953052
5540520,4,B00B0LKVIY,"So, after seeing the awesomely crazy trailer for Manborg, I decided to blind-buy it for a ""Bad Movie Night"" with my friends. We typically watch these kinds of movies for an unintentional laugh, a la Mystery Science Theater 3000, and the low-budget look and goofy nature of the trailer seemed like it would fit in that category.

We were wrong. It was actually a genuinely awesome movie.

The thing is, despite the cheesy effects, it's truly amazing what Astron-6 pulled off with such a bare-bones budget, and it provides a loving tribute to 80's VHS B-Movie Sci-Fi and to 90's live action videogame cutscenes (yes, really). There is also some crazy scope provided, with detailed cityscapes and creative stop motion animation used to make such a tiny movie feel much bigger.

It also helps that the cast plays their parts with a mix of overt seriousness and silliness that keeps everything funny throughout. Once again, I mean GENUINELY funny, not unintentionally. The writing plays on the silliness of the story and gives us a character with intentionally goofy/melodramatic dubbing (A martial artist named ""#1 Man"", who is very much inspired by Liu Kang from the original Mortal Kombat arcade game) and an Australian gunman who is an all-out 80's pop star complete with random bouts of dancing (and who hilariously is shown giving the same thumbs-up multiple times during a training montage).

It's all rounded out with a fake movie trailer after the credits: Bio-Cop. This had everyone on the floor laughing, as it was a brief but genius idea about a cop who is forever locked in agonizing biological transformation after an accident involving chemicals. It would never work as a feature film, but as a 5 minute sketch it's one of the funniest and most disgusting ideas I've ever seen put on film. Trust me, it's THAT good, and I don't want to spoil any more.

Manborg certainly won't be for everybody, as it still has the elements of so-bad-it's-good cinema in its veins. The difference between this and, say, The Room or Birdemic is that the film knows how stupid it is and it wants you to laugh along with it. It's not a bad movie, but rather a great comedic love-letter to the B-Movies of yesteryear, albeit one with the same (if not even lower) budget than those movies.

It's never too late... to be a hero!",1367798400,16,2315,4.760598503740648
5540521,5,B00B0LKVIY,"I'll start by saying this movie is not for everyone. If you're looking for great special effects, academy award winning acting, character development, or any type of seriousness in a film this is not the film for you.

If you were a teenager in the early nineties and remember everything that was fun from the 80's then you may enjoy what this movie is offering; a chance to relive the silliness and straight up ridiculousness of all that was action and sci-fi in the 80's and 90's. You'll know what i'm talking about if you've watched movies like Total Recall, Terminator, Tron, Robocop, any Bruce Lee movie (yea I know from the 70's) or any kung-fu movie for that matter. It also helps if you played action video games like Mortal Kombat, Duke Nukem 3D, and Street Fighter. Remember Buckaroo Banzai? Yea, think of it as something along those lines. With that said here's what I think overall.

The film does a great job at setting us up with a simple brainless plot, the special effects while very cheesy I believe are pretty darn good. When watching the film you have to think a lot of time and effort went into the making of this film. I had a great time watching this film and while it was around 70 something minutes long it felt extremely short, and in my book any movie that I enjoyed that didn't feel long is a good movie. The acting was on par with the budget of the film but again, overall I think all of the actors did a fantastic job and I sure hope they keep making good cheesy ""throwback"" films like this. I recommend this to anyone looking to fill in a Friday night empty slot with some fun brainless humor!",1367712000,4,1623,4.406666666666666
5540522,5,B00B0LKVIY,"Few fillums recently have given me such continuous and sincere enjoyment as this film. When one watches the Deleted and Alternate Scenes and the ""Behind the Scenes"" footage (one doesn't need to see much of either one), and observes the wretched locale and the ratty green drops in front of which the actors of this film gave their all, one is, well, in awe... Having seen such a fillum, I have no fear that the new technologies (particularly filmic) will rob us of our humanity or of our narrative virtues... Plus, it contains a very important message! ...I think...",1367452800,4,566,4.7272727272727275
5540523,5,B00B0LKVIY,"Astron 6 has done it again with another awesome movie to stand along the recent father's day! This is low budget filmmaking at its very, very best, Manborg is a throwback to cheesy Sci-Fi's of the 80s with lots of references to classic films but is 100% original, pure entertainment from start to finish with crazy low rent green screen effects and cheesy acting and dubbing and dialogue but its totally fantastic, the movie is made this way on purpose so make sure you know what your getting yourself into when you watch it, great cast as usual, brilliant bad guys the make-up effects and gore are awesome!! The soundtrack is great too especially on the cool open credit sequence, this is a modern Grindhouse style cult classic and must be seen, fantastic special features too and commentary, a bargain at any cost!!",1364169600,5,817,4.72027972027972
8560343,3,B00B0LKVIY,"It's like David Sandberg saw this movie and said to himself, ""I can do it better."" Unconfirmed, but I feel as if this film is the parent of ""Kung Fury"". Don't get me wrong, this movie sucks big time, but there is so much charm and 80's/90's kitsch in it, it's almost like watching a little kid play with his Mortal Kombat figurines. All it needed to make it huge was David Hasselhoff, something David Sandberg obviously figured out.",1530057600,,432,4.481012658227848
8560344,1,B00B0LKVIY,The humor is out of place for the movie. I normally love movies like this but I cant even finish it. It goes from campy 80's and 90's throwback references to comedy dialogue that no one would laugh at. This same movie could be remade and be successful if they hired a writer.,1529625600,,275,4.2075471698113205
8560345,2,B00B0LKVIY,"Really didn't care for it.  That being said, the make up effects were not bad, the stop motion animation wasn't too bad, the other kinds of animation used were not great at all.  the acting and story were sub par.",1528588800,,213,4.3

8560349,4,B00B0LKVIY,"I've been a fan of Stephen Kostanski's short films for a long time and thought he did an excellent job maintaining his awesome sense of the outlandish in the feature length Manborg. Extremely inventive and funny. And, if I didn't know better, I'd say Thor: Ragnarok stole its plot from Manborg.",1514419200,,294,4.784313725490196
8560350,2,B00B0LKVIY,"I mean, I guess I get the idea. But man that's trash execution. It just totally missed the mark on so many opportunities to be the ""bad enough that it's good"" film that it obviously, desperately wants to be.

And seriously guys, all-weather deck screws holding his bits together? Jesus...",1509062400,,288,4.76
8560351,5,B00B0LKVIY,"You know what?  I don't care what anyone thinks, this movie is hilarious!  And not in a bad way at all but in a fun way.  So many little and big and sometimes completely cheesey jokes in here.  For example, the flash back scene where the scientist accidently unleashes hell on earth and tries to desperately and quickly reverse the mistake by hitting ""Backspace"" on his computer keyboard.  Oh, and for the tiny, tiny, tiny amount of money they spent making this movie, the effects were great!  Its difficult to explain but they took what would have obviously been really terrible green screen overlays, used stop motion and color filters somehow and gave this movie a pretty decent authentic look!  I hope that whoever made this film gets a chance to do many more of them with bigger budgets.  Cant imagine what he could do with a little bit of money!  This movie is just plain fun to watch in the first place but if you listen and watch even more closely, you'll find it totally full of a great sense of humor as well.  Yup!  I recommend.",1507420800,2,1039,4.473404255319149
