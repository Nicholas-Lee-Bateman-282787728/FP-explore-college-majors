If you love this opera, then it's a worthy companion to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1995-Mackerras-Hytner-production-with-Thtre-du-Chatelet/dp/B00000JN2W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1995 Mackerras/Hytner production with Thtre du Chatelet</a>&nbsp;that currently sets the standard for this work on DVD.

Don't expect exceptional production quality: what you see is a grainy 1965 black-and-white kinoscope of an East German television broadcast of this ""opera film"". The singers sometimes appear to be lip-syncing, which is a skill that doesn't comes particularly naturally to opera singers, though I can't be sure this isn't just a sync issue with the technically inferior double system sound film technology behind the Iron Curtain. The orchestra comes across remarkably good however, despite the monaural sound!

Max Brod's German libretto contains several departures from what we're accustomed to from the Czech version (and its English translations in the Anglosphere). Felsenstein apparently recast the German in an attempt to get closer to Jancek's original meaning (this according to the program notes anyway). Regardless, in this production some of the dialog is delivered as spoken text, and much is delivered as sprechstimme. There's a significant interpolation in the first tavern scene that includes a small mob stalking the priest: in this production he's blamed for impregnating Terynka, an interpretation that's not ""forced"" by the Czech libretto, but is made explicit here through a spoken monologue from the Forester in the tavern. There are a few bars cut from the middle of the foxes' wedding chorus, though the program notes contributed by the DVD producers indicate that some cuts were necessitated due to film damage, so perhaps the reason here is as innocuous as that.

The ultimate test of a Vixen production is whether it ""gets"" the ending of the opera. The Forester has learned that Sharp Ears is dead, but spots one of her pups. He then encounters a frog who, in singing the opera's last lines, reveals that he is not the same frog that awoke the Forester in the first act, but his grandson. As the meaning of this sinks in with the Forester, the full orchestra bursts forth in a glorious D-flat major melody that ends the opera. In fact, this melody is not new, but was introduced by the English horn during the instrumental threnody following the vixen's death two scenes earlier. The message is unmistakable: the Forester has suddenly learned that by accepting nature's cycles of death and renewal, he can find comfort in his creeping old age and unfulfilled dreams, and that his life has meaning after all. It's the redemption of the Forester that is the underlying theme of the opera, but one that's too all often missed by productions that try to make it more about the animals than the humans (and thus wind up making it a tragedy). In the film of this production, we quickly pan away from the Forester's bemused expression to the forest scene, now devoid of its animals, a treatment that mildly disappoints me. Perhaps it's overly aggressive, but I appreciate the gobsmacked expression of Thomas Allen's Forester in the aforementioned Mackerras/Hytner production when he realizes that three generations of frogs have passed, which quickly turns to expressions of bliss and acceptance of his own mortality as the final chords ring out. Jancek was nearly 70 when he completed this opera. This is an ending that should leave you in tears.

Still, there is much here to admire, starting with Irmgard Arnold in the title role. She brings a more mature kind of cynical and ""strong woman"" energy to the role than most characterizations (which tend to emphasize youthful impishness), and her singing and diction are quite fine. The forest staging avoids sentimentality or childishness. And the DVD itself is attractively packaged, with two booklets featuring director's notes and an essay on the restoration of the films. Most importantly, the production strikes an effective balance between presenting the animals as forest animals and anthropomorphizing them into caricatures of humans. Though I wouldn't make this your first video Vixen (unless you're a German speaker perhaps), I'd say it's worth the 90 minute investment.",1311379200,5,4391,5.3594202898550725
