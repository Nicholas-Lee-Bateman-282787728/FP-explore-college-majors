8486772,5,B005UCI7YE,"""There are 12 towns in France named Roquefort, but only one that makes the cheese!"" - Phil Ligget.

I always love Phil Ligget's stream of consciousness style commentary on these DVD's and this one of the best.  Great coverage, footage, and commentary.  Much more enjoyable that the 2012 sky-train.",1371340800,,297,5.020408163265306
8486773,4,B005UCI7YE,Good product. Exciting race to watch when training indoors. DVDs do have a couple of bad spots where the video gets froze up like it is scratched but it does recover and play again.,1359072000,,181,4.352941176470588
8486774,5,B005UCI7YE,"I was in France in 2011 and was able to see some of the stages.  It was great to actually see the places we visited and try to pick us out of the crowd.  Since we only got to see a small portion of the tour, this dvd provided us the opportunity to see what we missed.",1357171200,,267,3.6666666666666665
8486775,5,B005UCI7YE,"This is the first time World Cycling Productions has released the Tour in Blu-ray and the timing couldn't have been better.  The intense competition has been magnificently captured with crystal clarity in high definition.  If you're a cycling fan like me, you'll enjoy watching all the mountain stages in full in the 12-hour edition.  My favorite stage was Number 19 - Alpe d'Heuz won by Pierre Rolland, where he rode away in the final 2 km after chasing down Alberto Contador with the help of Sammy Sanchez.  No wait, maybe my favorite is Stage 17, won by Edvald Boassan Hagen after he cut through the narrow mountain roads ahead of Phillipe Gilbert, chased furiously by Contador and Sanchez trying the escape the peloton.  Or maybe Stage 12 where Sammy Sanchez won on Luz Ardiden after a huge effort.  The magnificent French countryside looks stunning in high definition and I love being able to spot the equipment the riders are on.

The only complaint I have is that the critical Stage 20 time trial where Cadel Evans took back 2:30 from Andy Schlek to win the Tour is only very briefly covered.  There are a couple of extra-feature segments with Chris Boardman that I did not find interesting and took up unneccessary time away from the competition.  Also, the way the Blu-ray menu works is not very convenient.  It doesn't resume from where you left off if you stop playing and then want to go back to the same point.

As always, the narration by Phil Liggett and Paul Sherwin gives you the full picture of the competiton for all the categories like the overall points leader, the king-of-the-mountain, the green jersey for the sprint, the best-young-rider category and the best team.  You are able to follow the strategy of each team as they try to win in the category with the best potential outcome for them.  Great job, Phil and Paul!",1329004800,5,1844,4.707165109034268
8486776,5,B005UCI7YE,A great race with the top contenders battling all the way to the second last stage.  The organisers set a very challenging course through the regions of France.  The beautiful scenery  made enjoyable viewing even for non cycling fanatics.  Tommy Volkler did France proud with his gritty determined efforts and it was good to see the young up and coming riders showing to the for. Perhaps we saw a future tour winner from France. Enjoy viewing this set I am very pleased I added this to my collection.,1325635200,,500,4.6477272727272725
8486777,3,B005UCI7YE,It is difficult to condense 3 weeks of racing into just 12 hours... To solve that issue make them 16 or 24 hours... Disc #1 is stages 1 through 11... Are you kidding me??? Each stage narrative begins with like 10 miles remaining.. ZERO depth in the analysis. No rider profiles and only a scant few second of the French TV car carnage.... ARE YOU KIDDING ME???? Yes I want to see the grueling climbing stages in their entirety but you need to tell me more about who the characters are and how they got there....,1325548800,4,510,4.322916666666667
8486778,5,B005UCI7YE,"Nothing beats the Official SBS coverage of the Tour de France - 12hrs of the BEST footages from the BEST vantage points.

It's not just about watching the race but also a helicopter tour of the breathtaking french countryside.",1325289600,3,226,4.794871794871795
