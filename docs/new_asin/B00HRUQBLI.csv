8634961,5,B00HRUQBLI,"My four year old Paige has always loved Littlest Pet Shop since she's a huge animal lover. She also happens to be my little fashionista. She somehow knows what's in style and literally changes her outfit 5 - 10 times a day because she loves clothes and fashion so much. That made the newest LPS from Shout Factory a dream come true for her! Littlest Pet Shop: Strike a Pose is right up her alley!

The DVD has five new episodes:

So You Skink You Can Dance?
Commercial Success
What, Meme Worry?
The Big Feathered Parade
Alligators and Handbags

Paige has watched this DVD over and over again from start to finish. When I asked what her favorite episode was, her response: ""I love them all."" So there you have it! This DVD is a hit!

Blythe is a special little girl who can understand and communicate with animals in the Pet Shop next door. This is just amazing to Paige and she's asked me why she can't understand animals! I actually call her the animal whisperer because she does have a special way with them. Unfortunately they don't literally speak to her!

When Blythe gets sick in one episode, she can no longer understand the animals! What will she do? How can she get her ability to communicate with them back? Watch and see!

Littlest Pet Shop: Strike a Pose is a super fun DVD for the Littlest Pet Shop fan in your life and they won't be disappointed!",1401926400,,1360,4.42
8634962,5,B00HRUQBLI,"I looked up the episodes and here is what I can gather (though I'm not 100% sure this will be the final listing)
1. The nest hat craze
2. What, meme worry?
3. So you skink you can dance
4. Alligators and handbags
Again just listing the episodes that I've be able to scrounge up and not 100% positive about the final listing",1396396800,,323,4.142857142857143
