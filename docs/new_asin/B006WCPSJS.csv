8505536,5,B006WCPSJS,"Just like the cover, b-movies are the basic plot and feel of the series. After a terrible accident happened in the Riverdale's High School lab, strange things happen in the small town. Archie Andrews is a reporter for the school newspaper. He investigates every mystery along with his friends, Jughead Jones and Dilton Doliey, his girlfriends, Betty Cooper and Veronica Lodge, and his frenemy, Reggie Mantle. Yes, I said girlfriends, as both Betty and Veronica are both in love with Archie.

Some of the b-movie themes are: aliens, a werewolf, a cursed mummy, a 50-foot Veronica, a ghost, creatures, and Veronica clones. In Invisible Archie, both Reggie and Archie turn invisible after a lab accident, which is a spoof of The Invisible Man movies. Most of the episodes play homage to old scifi and horror movies. My favorite was Attack of the Killer Spuds, a spoof of the Invasion of the Body Snatchers, but instead of pods the aliens use potatoes.

The Archie gang has a new modern day look to them, but all the old gags are still there, including Jughead's love of hamburgers and Veronica is still spoiled. As a b-movie fan and cartoon fan, I enjoyed watching these weird episodes and I recommend the DVD to other fans too.",1337644800,4,1225,4.773584905660377
