4286536,4,B0048LVDHG,"These two movies are awesome.  I had only seen ""El Mariachi"" in the original version with English subtitles before.  This English version is dubbed very well (I hardly recognized that the voices are not original).  Video quality is essentially not different from a DVD.",1300838400,4,269,5.068181818181818
4286537,5,B0048LVDHG,Got my Blu ray quickly and I loved Desperado. El Mariachi is the prequel to Desperado which starred somebody who clearly is not Antonio Banderas. Mariachi had horrible acting but it did kind of set the stage for Desperado. For some reason the movie is all in Spanish. It was just made that way. Desperado was a classic and I loved it. Salma Hayek is so sexy in the movie especially when she is sing her solo song while Antonio is recovering from a lo g night of love making to her. Not bad for getting a double feature for $15,1297555200,2,526,4.217821782178218
4286538,5,B0048LVDHG,The two movies had different actors to play the same character as the same theme continued from one movie to the other.  The Blu-ray version of El Mariachi had the lines spoken in English which the previous DVD (non-Blu-ray) did not - the only speech for the dialogue was non-English (in Mexican).  I propaply had more interest in Desperado of the two - it had many of the same actors as were in Once Upon a time in Mexico.  They are all movies I like to watch repeatedly.,1297209600,2,472,4.340909090909091
4286539,3,B0048LVDHG,"The copy of El Mariachi is really rather poor quality, but it's probably about as good as it can be. I gather it's a telecine of a film copy of the original - hardly Bluray quality. It's interesting as the first film Robert Rodriguez made.

Desperado, by contrast, is much better quality. It is a sequel to El Mariachi, but clearly made with a much larger budget.

Having these two together is a much better deal than having El Mariachi by itself.",1296604800,6,447,4.439024390243903
4286540,3,B0048LVDHG,"For those who don`t know this is double feature disc means one disc contain both of movies .If its 2 pack then package will carry different discs like Crank , House of 1000 corpse. I am not reviewing movie just conversion.
Blu Ray :
Conversion is so so. Its quite grainy and poor sound upgrade. Conversion is no way close to superiors of Terminator,Back to future,Caligula(1979) and they are older then this .This Seems like work of haste or just run for quick bucks .
Menu are a mess .I find it really difficult to navigate which movie i want to play .Whenever you insert disc it start looking for Internet connection .Very annoying feature of most of BD live discs including this one with no option to disable it .Loading is done in form of bullet that gets red but seems more like male genitalia .No pun intended. Reasonable price for this double feature is $8.99 .If you own dvd upgrade isn`t that essential unless you want to see Salma Hayak on full screen.

Final Verdict : Weak Video upgrade ,Poor audio ,Inferior PQ according to blu ray standards , over priced",1296000000,4,1068,4.533678756476684
4286541,5,B0048LVDHG,"This is an excellent blu ray. El Mariachi's source is not without its flaws, and it looks it, but most imperfections can largely be attributed to the low budget nature of the film and it certainly looks better than any previous home video release. Desperado, which had a substantially bigger budget, looks splendid on blu ray. The colors are vibrant, the blacks are strong, and contrast is good. As with El Mariachi, Desperado has never looked better. Pick this up if you're a fan of these movies, you will not be disappointed.",1295395200,10,527,4.739130434782608

4286608,4,B0048LVDHG,"We all know what Robert Rodriguez can do - Sin City, Planet Terror, Machete - so it's fun to see how few restrictions he had back in the beginning.

The irony is that his first film, El Mariachi, was confined mostly by a lack of funds, and Desperado was boosted by its star power.  Salma Hayek and Antonio Banderas are the leads, and Steve Buscemi, and Quentin Tarantino make appearances, along with other faces who have become Rodriguez regulars.

4286609,3,B0048LVDHG,"EL Mariachi was simply awful, and really should be amputated from Desperado.  El Mariachi was obviously done on a shoestring budget.

4286611,5,B0048LVDHG,"El Mariachi is Robert Rodriguez's first commercial effort, but it is amazing in that the brilliance that inhabits his later works are already on display.  The film is a little unpolished compared to the later ones, but it is very effective none-the-less and provides a good starting point for the subsequent films 'Desperado' and 'Once Upon A Time in Mexico"".  The English dubbing isn't bad either, which always helps.

Desperado is fabulous.  Antonio Banderas is perfect as the now very intense El Mariachi.  The story is great.  It bristles with humour and intelligence, which are true for all Robert Rodriquez's efforts.  I'm making an assumption, but some of the gunfight scenes owe a little to John Woo.  However, at the end of the second gunfight (the first is narrated by 'the American'), I've never seen gunfighters picking up the weapons of the fallen and so consistently having them not work.  It's very funny in a bloody sort of way.

The collection did not include 'Once Upon A Time In Mexico', which, believe it or not, is even better.  I recommend watching all 3 in a mini Robert Rodriguez film festival.  You will not only see 3 excellent films (of their genre, of course), but have an opportunity to see a great director develop his craft.

4286634,4,B0048LVDHG,"Since this Blu-Ray is two movies on one disk, I have written a double feature review.

EL MARIACHI

When this film came out in 1993 I only heard bits about it. It wasn't until it came out on VHS tape and later on Laserdisc that I began to take notice. Rodriguez earned $3,000 by volunteering as a lab rat for a month in a medical research hospital, where he wrote the script. With another $4,000 from his friend Carlos Gallardo, he shot this movie in Mexico with the intention of selling it to the Spanish video market. But a copy of the film wound up into the hands of a major Hollywood talent agency. Rodriguez was signed with an agent, which lead to a 2-year development deal with Columbia Pictures.

That was what I knew about EL MARIACHI when I sat down to watch it for the first time. When I finished, I thought it was really cool. It doesn't have a lot of dialogue, but it does have plenty of action. And it wasn't until many years later when I watched it again I discovered something else. It is a Mexican Western, like the Man-With-No-Name movies Sergio Leone did with Clint Eastwood. This was especially clear after I read Rodriguez's book: REBEL WITHOUT A CREW, where he gives full detail how he made this movie for $7,000 and what happened after that Hollywood agency got its hands on it.

The plot is a Comedy-of Errors type. An unnamed mariachi (Gallardo) comes into a small town in Mexico, intending to follow his father's footsteps and make a name for himself, dressed in black and carrying his guitar in a case. At the same time, a gunman named Azul (Reinol Martinez) arrives dressed in black, carrying a guitar case full of weapons. He also has come to town with a goal, which is established in the opening sequence. He worked for a drug dealer named Moco (Peter Marquardt) and helped him make a lot of money. Now he wants his share of it, and starts killing the dealer's henchmen to get to him, having been double crossed by Moco. Moco sends his men to kill Azul, but they end up mistaking the mariachi and chase after him. At the same time the musician has to fight for his life, he finds some work at a bar, which is owned by a beautiful lady (Consuelmo Gomez)

If this plot seems rather simple and obvious, that is actually a small price to pay for the movie. What the film has is an unbelievable amount of energy in it. If you watch carefully, you'll see lots of cutting even when the characters are speaking. This not only helps to prevent the film from getting bogged down, it actually works to keep the film going at the right pace. (The Blu-Ray has the first of a series that Rodriguez has been including in all of his movies: THE TEN MINUTE FILM SCHOOL. For this movie, he explains the real reason why he did the dialogue scenes that way.)

The action scenes have a lot of fast cuts in them. A lot of times I complain about this kind of editing in big action movies, but with EL MARIACHI, it isn't an issue. We see automatic weapons firing, and characters getting hit, and the film doesn't look like it actually cost only $7,000, except with the grainy picture and lack of surround sound. It also features a stunt that Gallardo did himself, which also adds to the illusion of a movie costing more than it did.

On Blu-Ray, the film is very grainy in appearance. This is because of the main source: the 35mm blown up version of the original negative, which was in 16mm. Next year is the 20th anniversary of this film's theatrical release. Rodriguez should have the film completely re-mastered, using the latest digital technology to clean it up, as well as an audio re-mastering into 5.1 DTS sound. There is also another drawback to this film. The subtitles are in white, and are very hard to see at times. When they were putting this Blu-Ray together, they should've made the subtitles in yellow.

(note) Rodriguez included an award winning short film he made in 1990, which proved to him that the feature film was possible: BEDHEAD. This short film is actually really good. All I can say about it is that I laughed out loud while I watched it, and that Rodriguez seemed to have a talent for comedy as well as action.

DESPERADO

After Rodriguez made an action film for Showtime called ROAD RACERS in early 1994, he made his first Hollywood theatrical release with DESPERADO. The film is a sequel to EL MARIACHI, and it cost $7,000,000. Even in the mid-nineties that is a really low budget for any Hollywood movie. And like EL MARIACHI, it looks like it cost a lot more than that. If you're a Hollywood Executive who funds the cost of a movie, Rodriguez gives you your money's worth. That's what he demonstrates with this movie.

I have to give a Spoiler Warning for EL MARIACHI to describe this film. (Read no further if you haven't seen the previous film.) At the end of EL MARIACHI the title character has lost his left hand and his girlfriend. Believing he may never play the guitar again, he took the guitar case full of guns. In DESPERADO we learn that the drug dealer who shot him worked for a bigger drug cartel: Bucho (Joaquin de-Almedia). The mariachi (Antonio Banderas) is determined to kill this man, and makes it clear that he is the only one he wants. But everywhere he goes he winds up in a bloody shoot-out against Bucho's men. As he says to a bartender (Cheech Marin) before he gets killed, ""You had to do it the hard way.""

In addition to looking for Bucho, the mariachi has two other elements to deal with. He saves the life of Carolina (Salma Hyeck), a bookstore owner, and the two end up developing a relationship together. I wouldn't call it a deep relationship, since there is really no time for it. She returns the favor by removing a bullet in his shoulder. The other element he has to deal with is another person who came to town: a knife throwing bad-ass (Danny Trejo). Rodriguez says that Trejo has a great face and intended to use him in all of his future films. The first time I saw him, he looked like a really scary guy you would definitely not want to tangle with.

Although this film is indeed a sequel, it is actually Part-II in a trilogy of the Mariachi-with-No-Name. It makes it clear that EL MARIACHI is a Mexican Western. It is strange how this genre easily moves itself into the films from other countries; including Japan. (Akira Kurosawa made his own Samurai Western with YOJIMBO.) But there is something else added to it. In addition to being a Western, DESPERADO is a Mexican John Woo movie.

Woo is the Chinese filmmaker whose Hong Kong action films feature an unbelievable amount of stylish gunfire. His main character usually shoots with two 9mm pistols, raking up an incredibly huge body count. Blood flies everywhere in Woo's movies, and he constantly uses slow motion. With the exception of the latter Rodriguez does the same thing. Gunfire erupts all over the place in DESPERADO, with plenty of blood flying everywhere. The action scenes are spectacular, even if some of them look so preposterous.

There are some really funny scenes in DESPERADO. It opens with Steve Buscemi telling the story about a gunfight the Mariachi got into, which he ended up witnessing. This follows with the title credits, which reveal that the mariachi had two guitar players as a backup band. They're playing in a bar and deal with a dangerous patron in a comical way. Quentin Tarantino comes in for a cameo, where he tells a really tasteless joke in a bar. Cheech Marin's bartender, who works with a regular in the bar (Tito Larravo), adds his own comic elements. On top of that, Rodriguez throws in an entertaining shootout involving the Mariachi's backup band and a clever use of guitar cases. (More of that, I cannot reveal).

Is DESPERADO a masterpiece? Of course, not. Neither is EL MARIACHI. But these films are really entertaining. Rodriguez is a director with tremendous talent, and a lot of creativity. And DESPERADO qualifies as a Kick-Ass Film. (See my review of GRINDHOUSE for a definition of that.)

DESPERADO looks much better than EL MARIACHI on Blu-Ray, and takes full advantage of the DTS 5.1 Surround effect. If you have a good 5.1 Home Theater, it makes an excellent demo disc.

Both movies feature a running commentary by Rodriguez. What he does is to explain how he made EL MARIACHI and DESPERADO on their incredibly low budgets. His intention, I believe is to inspire young filmmakers into going out and shooting their own action movies at little cost. With the modern HDTV technology today, they can make their films even better, and cheaper.",1347667200,2,8525,4.564421190320471

4286636,5,B0048LVDHG,"Two movies for a great price. Now the movies:  I have owned Desprado on DVD for a while and love the movie. I would give it more than five stars if I could. As for El Marachi surprisingly another fine Robert Rodriguez film. Frankly I never before had heard and believed that it was Desperado but in Spanish. I was wrong and found out what El's motivation for killing drug dealers came from. Thank goodness the film was transferred as is and was not ruined with a computerized enhancement. You see the grain of the film which added grittiness to the film. The only thing that I highly recommend that you turn on the English subtitles and listen to the original Spanish audio. The English dub track is Godawful you will enjoy the film much better.  As an avid anime and Chinese Kung Fu fan I have heard worse dub tracks and this is the same. You will get more enjoyment and the translation of the subtitles give more depth to the story then listening to the dubbed audio. In wanting to match lips to dialog inevitably is butchered when English I'd synced to the film. All that said both films are trademark Robert Rodriguez movies. These are not masterpieces in need of an award, but they are great action films for guys to enjoy with humor mixed in with the blood and guts.

I am happy these were released together. Otherwise I most likely would have watched it on cable with the horrible English dub.

Even though it is said that Once Upon A Time In Mexico is the finale of the movies it does nothing but embarrass Robert Rodrigez. I am sure it was made with a bigger budget and they tried to make up for the poor script with some big named actors and blood and guts. These two are all you need to see IMHO",1325808000,12,1706,4.338557993730408
8418735,4,B0048LVDHG,"Great movies but the presentation itself is not that impressive. This BD is very standard, nothing to brag about. No booklet, a rather thin BluRay case, no reversible cover nor anything else worth mentioning. The Grindhouse Double Feature at least had a cool case sleeve and reversible cover. This one is barebones.

The menus are just as uninteresting. It's just the words and some footage of the movies playing in the background. The fonts are not interesting or stylized and it's not fun to look at or explore, there are very few graphics that actually go into it for style. It's all just kinda there and it really doesn't impress.

The video quality for El Mariachi is not great but that was always going to be the case. There is no getting around the fact that this was filmed for $7000 and this is all you can hope for when the original print of the movies is made with such a cheap budget so be aware. That only applies to that movie, Desperado looks and sounds solid so no complains on the quality of that one.

Extras are good, too, but considering that Desperado was censored and had a whole shootout scene at the end that was filmed but left out this could've been the best time to add a sort of original cut to the movie or at least showcase the deleted scenes. There are commentaries, there is trivia and there are some video presentations, good stuff, but I'm pretty sure all of the extras were just the hand me downs from the DVD versions so nothing new. Again, it's all good but there is nothing special.

If there was to be an ultimate version of these movies, or even of either one, then this ain't it. It's got the movies, some extras and it works just fine, and for $15 it's worth the asking price, but there is nothing special about this so If you ARE just looking for the movies and something decent for a good price, this is the one, but if you are as big a fan of this movie as I am it's not going to scratch that itch for a definitive or best available version on BluRay then this falls shy of anything remotely that. Unfortunately, as far as I know, there is no such edition anywhere. There is a Best Buy steelbook edition, which I don't own, but as far as I know aside from the case and being regions free that on is also not that much different from this one. It's too bad there is no such version but if you want to own the movies of BD this might be the best venue without going international.",1525996800,,2423,4.295404814004376

8418739,5,B0048LVDHG,"I bought this for El Mariachi, I heard Robert Rodriguez made it for $7,000 and that it was good. I watched it and was suprised, it's pretty great, such raw passion, such fire.... Carlos Gallardo played a fantastic Mariachi and It's just an amazing little gem! Buy it for this movie alone!

Desperado is not the same story. Because El Mariachi was so sucessful and so cheap, they threw 7 million at the sequel and well, it's nowhere near as entertaining El Mariachi. Desperado feels unfocused, has too many jokes, and Antonio Banderas doesn't hold a candle to Carlos as the Mariachi. It looks nicer and has better effects, but I feel no passion.

In short Buy for El Mariachi, and maybe you might like Desperado.",1513036800,,711,4.634920634920635
