8132722,1,B000GI3RXI,"I was bewildered at first by all the attention to tea growing and manufacturing (and harvesting in bright new 'ethnic' costumes.)
After giving Margo Polo's Silk Route a verbal shrug, they(start on a trek with horses on the old tea route to Tibet. Fascinating, the men and a woman  all dressed up in finery, the woman even wearing shoes that were better off for ballet or city evenings than the rugged terrain they were going thru, but she served to prove that women too can be part of this parade. If you buy it, note the faces of villagers and the newness of their clothes as the caravan goes thru their villages. The most absurd is the remote large Catholic Church, filled with worshipers in what appeared to be the foundations for stalls,all crossing themselves with great gusto facing an alter - with no priest. You are told how Tibet always has belonged to China and given a jolting rationale for any future wars with India. Informative yes. About Marco Polo's Silk Route - forget it.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marco-Polo-s-Silk-Road/dp/B000NJWO7U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marco Polo's Silk Road</a>",1251244800,5,1155,5.346153846153846
8132723,4,B000GI3RXI,"This was a beautifully filmed production, focusing on the southern silk road.  Really, though, it should be called the Tea Road, as the amount of time that was actually spent talking about the impact of Silk was minuscule.

We purchased the film expecting to see more of the Northern Silk Road, through the ""stans"" and Western China because of an upcoming trip to the region.  Instead, this one focused on the route to the south, over some incredibly varied and inhospitable terrain.  The movie follows a caravan carrying tea leaves as it goes to Tibet.

Stunning visuals, and a great look into daily life for some of the minority peoples along the route.  If you're looking for info on Kashgar, Urumqi, or any of the former Soviet republics, you may be disappointed.  Still, it's worth checking out.",1169856000,10,800,4.795620437956204
8132724,4,B000GI3RXI,"If you are even slightly interested in Asian Culture and/or rare footage of unknown cultures, this film will satisfy you.  It covers the 6 month journey taken by many Chinese that was (and still is to some extent) the engine of the Chinese economy.  There is also footage of personal culture (ie: marriage, harvesting rituals, days of celebration, etc..).
