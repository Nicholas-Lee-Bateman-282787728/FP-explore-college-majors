While the camera provides perfect focus on the ""guests"", its primary  attention is rightfully on the stars of the show, The Band.  Complete with  backstage interviews, compelling locations, and a surprise or two thrown in  for good measure.  A must see for all who understand rocks impact.",922924800,,430,4.888888888888889

403553,5,6301971175,"Legendary final performance of The Band. If you know who The Band was, what there music is, then you should also know that Martin Scorsese was at the cusp of a creativity that would not concern itself with making movies to be hailed as commercial success, having a natural and matured direction style that knew how to edit artsy ideas of interviewing, interlaced with important live performances of The Band standards, and even a little edgy, beatnik-like poetry, and create a masterpiece, one of a kind in the music and cinema world. The final cut of musical guests is impressive. We are talking over 40 years ago, and many of these artists are still around. It might be important to note that only 2/5th's of The Band remains alive.",1517097600,,734,4.6976744186046515

403638,5,6301971175,"One of the first things I notice, that so many people ask when I have introduced this outstanding music movie to them is ...why?  Why on earth did "" The Band"" retire...  they don't look road weary or stumbling around bloated with sunken dark eye's carrying 60lb's worth of dead liver tissue.  Quite the opposite they look as if 16 years on the road has turned them into rock hard road warrior's at their prime!!!  I tell them ... "" Well your right!  My guess is they wanted to go out like Rocky Marciano, on top & be remembered that way!!!""  I also remind them of the pressures & internal conflict that can develop between band members that work so closely together for so long...just look at "" The Beatles"" & they broke up a lot earlier than 16 years together.  Here are 21 reasons to purchase this Music D.V.D.  #1: Bobby Charles #2: Dr. John  #3: Van Morrison  #4: The Staples  # 5: Ron Wood  #6: Ringo Starr  #7: Joni Mitchel  #8: Neil Young  # 9: Steven Stills  # 10: Paul Butterfield  # 11: Bob Dylan  # 12: Neil Diamond  # 13: Emmylou Harris  # 14:  Ronnie "" The Hawk"" Hawkins  #  15: Eric Clapton  # 16 : Muddy Waters & of course the reason all these stars are in this movie "" The Band""=  # 17: Garth Hudson  # 18: Rick Danko  # 19: Richard Manuel  #  20: Levon Helm  # 21:  Robbie Robertson.  And if that list of musical talent isn't enough to spark your interest then remember that Rolling Stone Magazine rated  "" The Band"" at Number 50 of the Greatest Rock & Roll Bands of all time!!!  Chances are if your looking at purchasing "" The Last Waltz"" you are familiar with "" The Band"" & their Music.  I would like to say I feel as though most of "" The Bands"" songs captured on this D.V.D. are better than there studio versions!  Also this makes a great gift for young people that are interested in Rock & Roll History!  I know my son loves it & he is in his early twenty's.  As far as Music Movies or Music concerts or events captured on film goes this one ranks right up with "" Woodstock"" , "" The Isle of White"" or "" Altamont"" If not surpassing those show's for the simple fact that this event was captured on 35. mm film with great sound.  If you love watching great music performed live at its best this is a must have along with the afore mentioned shows!  I know I had to add it to my music movies on D.V.D. collection!  Stand out performances on this D.V.D. are everything performed by "" The Band"" as well as Van Morrison, Neil Diamond, Dr. John, Bob Dylan & Neil Young's face as he gets to play with Bob Dylan... Neil looks like a kid at Christmas!!!  I can't leave out Muddy Waters either who starts off playful but finishes very strong, or Ronnie "" The Hawk"" Hawkins who gives us a Rip Roaring Rebel Yell version of "" Who do ya love?""!!!  "" The Staples"" add a whole new level to the song "" The Weight""  & Levon Helm sings "" The Night they Drove Old Dixie Down"" like it's the last time he will ever get to sing it again...wait a minute ...IT IS the LAST TIME He will ever sing it with the original line up again!!!",1502409600,7,3028,4.128865979381444

The Band themselves, are each amazing musicians and then, throw in artist after artist. Its just a fantastic smorgasbord of musical genius. My fave clip is The Night They Drove Old  Dixie Down. Its by far, THE best version of the song. I actually think I prefer them live! How lucky you were if you were actually in the audience! Damn! I've always said I was born 20 years too late.

I saw these guys in Dallas in Memorial Auditorium, just a couple hundred people sitting on folding chairs but it was one of the best concerts I've been blessed to see, before the guys were blown out & Robertson morphed into the pretentious egomaniac you see in this film - makes me laugh to see him singing his head off - no where near the mic!! Hohoho...and with Neil Diamond telling him, yo, Rob, I think the guys recognize ""Helpless""...duh. If I could edit the constant headshots of him outta this, it would help! Loved seeing the other four majorly gifted Band members albeit heartbreaking musicians, they are amazing, as are the guests. Levon, Richard and Rick were all unique vocalists as well as talented musicians, Garth too, although he didn't sing - or pretend to! Watch the boys' faces - the rare times Scorsese takes his camera off Robertson - while Robertson is spinning his ""amazing"" yarns - nuff said!

403793,5,6301971175,"What can I say about Martin Scorceses The Last Waltz that hasn't already been said? That it is the greatest rock and roll documentary of all time?  The finest music movie ever made? The best rock concert ever put on film?

The Last Waltz is, of course, a feature-length documentary of the final concert of the legendary 1960s and 70s rock group The Band. This concert was held at Bill Grahams Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco on Thanksgiving Day, 1976.  This is much more than a concert video, however. It features The Band playing many of its most iconic songs, such as Up on Cripple Creek, The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down, King Harvest (Has Surely Come), The Weight, Ophelia, and many, many others. The concert also features several guest stars - most notably Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, Joni Mitchell, Muddy Waters, Van Morrison, Neil Diamond, Neil Young, Emmylou Harris, The Staples Singers, and many others.

Until recently, I had only seen The Last Waltz twice in my life  once in the mid-1980s on an old, horribly grainy VHS tape, and once a few weeks ago on Amazon Video. The difference between the two viewings was startling. By 2017, the movie had been remastered in high definition, making both the video and audio quality pristine. It was such an enjoyable viewing experience that I decided to purchase The Last Waltz on Blu-ray  making it only the third music video in my entire home video library.

Although I don't quite subscribe to the idea of The Last Waltz as being the best rock movie ever made,  I do rank it a very close second, behind what I consider the greatest-ever rockumentary: Michael Wadleighs Woodstock: 3 Days of Peace and Music. The Last Waltz easily earns my highest recommendation.",1492560000,4,1721,4.751677852348993

Interviews and all spoken parts were at such low volume that I was constantly turning the volume up and down.  If it was right for the music, I couldn't hear the spoken dialog.  If I turned the volume up for the dialog, it was too loud when the music resumed.  In the very beginning there is a suggestion that it should be listened to at high volume.  Then I suppose one could adjust the volume for the dialog and enjoy the music at a very high volume.  This would have been great if I was watching on a set with home theater quality sound.  But, alas, I was watching on a small set with small, poor quality sound.  So my advice is don't even try to watch this on a tablet or a small TV.",1484870400,,779,3.9806451612903224

Since then, I have backtracked previous material by them and really became interested in their music.

404709,5,6301971175,"Hands down, my favorite concert film. By all appearances, The Band was at the height of its artistic power on Thanksgiving, 1976. Why Robbie Robertson decided to pull the plug at that time is anybody's guess. He claimed burnout, but these five guys seemed to be exultant in their music during their farewell performance. Besides the incredible music by The Band, there are stellar performances by Neil Young, Muddy Waters, Paul Butterfield, Eric Clapton, and Van Morrison. Bob Dylan performs, along with Joni Mitchell, Neil Diamond, and Emmylou Harris, among others. My favorite segment might be when The Staple Singers perform ""The Weight"" with The Band. Mavis Staples and Rick Danko grind it out. Despite later lineup variations with and without Robertson and Levon Helm, this is the final performance of the premier American roots band at its zenith. I can't think of a better way for anyone who loves the music from this era to spend two hours.",1484092800,,948,4.968553459119497

406231,4,6301971175,"The Band was a fine group of musicians who put out some great songs. Marty Debergy (whoops, I'm getting ahead of myself) decided to film it in an apparent attempt to be more 'personal' than that of ""Don Kirshner's Rock Concert"", and failed utterly. Intercutting (including with hard audio cuts - I guess music is a visual medium to Scorsese) lame attempts at interviews (attempting, occasionally, to star himself), Scorsese manages to make a group of wonderful songs (and singers) into a fairly tedious exercise.

""Spinal Tap"" (by Rob Reiner) skewered this movie and its flaws so completely that I cannot even look at the title without thinking of 'Tap'. I bought the (triple - vinyl) soundtrack, and it is a much more enjoyable without any of the drek of the movie. Check that out instead.",1482537600,,790,4.8088235294117645

But variation in sound level between that of the performance and that of the interspersed interviews drove me nuts.  I had to move the volume up and down 30 points between the two.

The dialogue segments were so hushed that I constantly had to crank the volume up to way past 11 just to hear, then back it all down again for the music.  I don't know why the credits say ""Starring Emmylou Harris"" when Joni Mitchell was featured much more prominently but that's probably due to the bickering and petty stuff that surrounded the production of the film.  It's water under the bridge now, I very much enjoyed re-watching it and hearing all the music from stars that are woven through the tapestry of my generation's lives.  Strange to be sitting at this end of my life, watching a movie I saw when it was first out and I was a teenager.

The Band sound great, their interplay and changing roles within the band and music, the singing, the playing are outstanding.

409125,5,6301971175,"An epic performance that captures The Band in peak form - with a little help from a who's who list of artists - captured in colorful Panavision by Martin Scorcese, on a week-long break from shooting New York, New York. A rare combination of talents, at a singular moment in time: just as the curtain was closing on 70s rock, and punk and rap would pull the rug out. And with the exception of the waltz interlude, which seems dated but adds a European art-house touch that reflects Scorcese's roots, the film and the music is timeless in all the best ways.",1479168000,,555,4.450980392156863

Its enjoyable enough but the performances are mostly sloppy and the vignettes, while sweet, are often maudlin and pointless. The songs performed are mostly B sides - ie. not the artists best pieces - and Dylan is amazingly poor - as performer or even catalyst.

409312,5,6301971175,The best film on a classic Rock and Roll band ever produced. The Band was in my opinion the greatest group ever assembled. This pointe view of their last concert was way to soon. They were solely missed then and are still relevant today.

The Last Waltz, to me, is a celebration of American and Canadian musical history, not the end of The Band.  I suggest that if you want to rock everyone from young to old on Thanksgiving or any other day of the year, play the Last Waltz and turn it up!",1478908800,,414,4.08641975308642

409372,4,6301971175,Another film that I'd heard about for years and finally got around to watching it.  It's actually a pretty amazing concert film considering how old it is.  Production values are surprisingly stellar.  Cinematography and audio quality is amazing.  You can certainly see the promise of an early Scorsese in this film.

409575,4,6301971175,"This was a pretty good documentary, and I suppose I should give it a higher rating, taking into account that it was made in 1976. I do feel that, even back in those 'rustic' times, it would have been nice if they could have balanced out the volumes better between the concert parts and the conversation parts. Being a family man, the main time I could watch this and be able to hear the talking parts, I would need to watch after some of the kids were in bed. This made me glad for the remote, because I would have to keep going up way up on the volume when they were talking, and way down on the volume when the concert parts came on. Overall, though, it was an enjoyable movie. I always did like The Band's music, and they did have a good assortment of fellow musicians from back in my day (yes, I'm THAT old, though I am still a family man), making for a great concert.",1478390400,,872,4.135294117647059

409613,4,6301971175,"This to me is an epic video documenting not only the final concert of The Band with an all star cast of musical talent but a historic era as well. It is one of a Martin Scorsese's earliest and finest works in a long line of high quality rockumentaries. In my book he is the master of rockumentaries. The music is a tremendous collection of the best of the era if not ever, performed by equally some of the best musicians. The Last Waltz should be seen by anyone with even a passing interest in the music and life during the late sixties through seventies. For fans of The Band or in fact any of the other artists who performed during this concert it is an absolute must to have in your collection. I am truly not sure how many times I have watched it beginning with the original release on DVD.

The remastered video quality is superb! So why only four stars and not the full five? As I said, I have watched this many times over the years. The problem with at least this recording that I watched via streaming is the low volume level of the non music content. This is important stuff folks! There is great history of The Band, many musicians such as a Paul Butterfield, and the era itself in this portion of the documentary. I had to crank up the volume for each of these portions and dial it way back again for the music. You can hear every word just fine if you crank it up so don't let that sway you from watching or purchasing The Last Waltz. I have streamed it before going back a few years and don't remember that being an issue. Nor is it an issue on my DVD copy. Actually when I streamed it a few years ago I remember thinking the quality was better than the DVD. So what has happened to that fluctuation of volume in this reproduction? It was disappointing. Granted the only disappointment and I still highly recommend it. Hopefully the new remastered version on Blu-ray will not have that issue.",1478304000,,1905,4.306406685236769

They play deep from the albums things you haven't heard in years, but remember what great work it was.  With todays digital abilities you can here things you didn't in the original analog.

409968,5,6301971175,"This was the best concert I have ever seen and I was only 12 years old when it was performed. It was absolutely amazing the way it was filmed, arranged and performed. Martin Scorsese is a brilliant director and his accomplishments are noteworthy. It's unbelievable that there was that many first class musical artists performing along with ""The Band"" at the final performance of their career at that time. I was floored at the quality, style and overall musical talent and performance that they provided:

The Band:

Robbie Robertson  ...Lead Guitar & Vocal
Rick Danko  ...Bass & Violin & Vocal
Richard Manuel  ...Piano / Keyboards / Drums / Vocal
Levon Helm  ...Drums / Mandolin / Vocal
Garth Hudson  ...Organ / Accordion / Saxophone / Synthesizers

The amazing musical geniuses, and others that performed as well:

Eric Clapton  ...Performer
Neil Diamond  ...Performer
Bob Dylan  ...Performer
Joni Mitchell  ...Performer
Neil Young  ...Performer
Emmylou Harris  ...Performer
Ringo Starr  ...Performer
Paul Butterfield  ...Performer
Dr. John  ...Performer
Van Morrison  ...Performer
Ronnie Hawkins  ...Performer
The Staple Singers  ...Performer
Muddy Waters  ...Performer
Ronnie Wood  ...Performer
Michael McClure  ...Performer
Lawrence Ferlinghetti  ...Performer
Martin Scorsese  ...Interviewer
Jim Gordon  ...Performer
Tom Malone  ...Performer
Howard Johnson  ...Performer
Jerry Hey  ...Performer (as Jerry Hay)
Richard Cooper  ...Performer
Charlie Keagle  ...Performer
Larry Packer  ...Performer

How can you beat a lineup like that at a farewell concert? You can't! This entertainment is the best. I own this on Prime and Blu-ray.
There are other A listers that appear and are uncredited.  Bill Graham was seen on the edge of the stage during production.  Carl Radle was there on film. Robert Charles Guidry was there in production. Bob Margolin played his guitar with Muddy Waters. Pinetop Perkins played piano with Muddy Waters as well.

I've seen a lot of concerts and this one is the best I have ever seen.

Enjoy a relaxed evening in. Have a beverage and enjoy beautiful music for your ears, mind and soul.
Politics within the band aside, this is very entertaining. There's a lot more to the future of the members of the group and I urge you to check it out under other reliable sites. Otherwise, this is music made to perfection under difficult circumstances.",1477612800,16,2370,5.356948228882834

It's so low you can barely tell there is sound at all and you certainly can't make out what is being said.  Once the music starts back up it's all good.  It doesn't make sense and I know it's not how the film was originally because I have seen it multiple times before.  Great movie, frustrating way to see it.",1477267200,,531,4.479166666666667

I have to take away a star because in the end the movie is a fraud. You come away thinking the Band is Robbie Robertson and his sidemen and that's not true. I wondered what was wrong with Garth Hudson and later find out that a coked out Scorsese woke him up at dawn to film his only lines in the movie. So, many of the relationships are not as presented. I have to say it's weird watching Richard Manuel say ""I just want to break even"" knowing he died in 1986, and his death was ruled a suicide. It's like anything else. You grow up and you look back on what you used to like and it looks different. The Last Waltz is still good, the music is still amazing, but it's not as true a story as I used to thing it was. Then again, that's true of most things.",1476921600,8,877,3.905027932960894

410723,4,6301971175,"The music is great and some of the performances are inspired. But like all hagiographic work the film is both self-serving and undercutting  with the self of being served up is Scorcese's impressions of what music meant to folks geometry ng of age in he late '60s; as a tonic watch the Mayles brothers far more acerbic and honest documentary about The Rolling Stones in 1969, ""Gimme Shelter"").

 In 2016 watching it is a nostalgia trip in both the best and worst senses of that term. You can see how Scorsese really plays up Robbie Robertson's role  and Robertso responds with some frenetic showboating both on and off stage. The (fine) camera work, editing, and digital restoration and print work are top notch, but really it is the songs and  interconnectedness between Levon Helm,  Rick Danko, Richard Manuel, Robertson, and Garth Hudson as musicians that are the true stars. I've also read that Robertson's vocals were removed from the mix.

In the interview segments everyone seems to be stoned out of their gourds. I have also read that  when Martin Scorsese worked on the digital restoration he removed cocaine tell-tales from underneath various people's nostrils. I would have liked to hear Levon Helms tell more stories. I'm not taking sides in the Robertson vs. Helms farrago. Both Robertson and Helms had really interesting lives prior to becoming rock stars.

I was lucky enough when I was 17  to see two of the legendary 1974 concerts where Dylan and the Band reunited briefly. Forty-two years later I still remember the fierceness and musical intensity of those shows. At its best ""The Last Walltz"" captures that but the film's  title is apt: when these concerts were filmed the party was over.",1476489600,12,1708,4.875432525951557

""The Last Waltz"" is a glaring exception; it really is the greatest concert film ever made.  And when you think about it, when you combine a legendary band at the end of a legendary career with a legendary director, how could it NOT be?

Those prior reviewers who have blamed Robbie Robertson for all of the group's troubles -- based largely on Levon Helm's account -- may wish to read Robertson's new memoir; not surprisingly, his viewpoint is quite different.  But none of the bandmate squabbles take anything away from ""The Last Waltz"". Buy it, enjoy it, treasure it, pass it on to your kids.",1476316800,,692,4.647540983606557

411811,3,6301971175,"The Last Waltz (An experience in blow) - An important part of rock history, It seeming embodies both the 60's and the upcoming 80's in on mid 70's concert experience. You can see the downfall's of the 60's rock generation coming in the 80's. The most obvious example of this is just how arrogant and coked up Robbie Robertson comes across. There is a self congratulatory vibe here - Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson are rarely show on camera in comparison to Robertson. The contributions that Garth and Manuel made to the group are largely ignored and we get a lot of footage of a cocky coked up Robertson making sexual facial expressions and acting the single band leader. I know he is not the only coked musician of the concert... he just oozes coke arrogance. He is also interviewed far more than the rest of the band. The crowd is hardy shown and not nearly as loud as you would expect for a concert of this magnitude. There is the stars and the unwashed unseen masses.  I think the 60's is represented here in the sense - these guys haven't quite gone dorky middle aged rocker yet - they still play with a youthful passion and fire. I have to admit Robertson, despite how he comes off, plays very well. However, It's definitely a different version of The Band than the first 2 albums. There is ALOT of fiery Robertson soloing - the homespun backwoods vibe is rarely present here, if at all. I'm not sure how well all the guest spots fit either, some of the sequencing doesn't really fit to me. Overall, I think the musicianship is at a high level, but there is a lot detracting from the overall experience for me.",1433980800,,1617,4.462837837837838

411880,5,6301971175,"The Last Waltz

 When one of cinema's giants sets out to make a concert film we can expect something extraordinary.  Director Martin Scorsese has accomplished exactly that in this wonderful, breathtaking film.  It helps to have music as memorable and fine as any music produced in that great era.  The Last Waltz records for all time the electric night of Thanksgiving Day November 25, 1978.  This night marked the last appearance of the legendary group known simply as The Band at the Winterland Ballroom.  The Band accompanied Bob Dylan in the 1960s when Dylan was at the height of his musical power and popularity.
 Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko, Levon Helm, Garth Hudson and Richard Manuel made up The Band from the last part of the 1950s when Ronnie Hawkins led them until The Last Waltz in 1978.  The Band performs 'Up on Cripple Creek', 'The Shape I'm in, It Makes no Difference', 'Ophelia', 'The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down' and 'Stage Fright'.
 As the first of a spectacular A list Ronnie Hawkins sings 'Who Do You Love?'.  Hawkins is followed by Dr. John, Paul Butterfield and Muddy Waters before Eric Claptin sings 'Further on Up the Road'.
 Neil Young breaks our harts with 'Helpless'.  Joni Mitchell, Neil Diamond and Van Morrison all contribute songs.  Bob Dylan gives us several songs including one sung with his old team mates, 'I Shall be Released'.  Dylan and the Band are joined by Ronnie wood and Ringo Starr on that song.
 This is the best music by the best musicians performed one after the other for almost two hours.  The sound is perfect, thank you Director Scorsese.
 The Band and the Staple singers work together on a version of 'The Weight' that all by itself is worth the cost of the entire wonderful album.
 This is often called the greatest concert film ever made and I find it hard to argue against that idea.
 I watched the 2002 remastered special edition and recommend this version for home viewers.
 PG rated for some language issues but for those of a certain age, it just doesn't get any better.",1432339200,,2035,4.692090395480226

411918,4,6301971175,"The Last Waltz, 1978 film

This is the farewell performance of The Band (which reminds me of a smaller version of Woodstock). They played many of their famous songs. The Band began as the back-up for Bob Dylan then went independent due to their popularity. [No mention of Bobs accident.] There are interviews with individual members who tell about their past. [Is it all true?] Was the whole greater than the sum of its parts? How well did each do on his own? What kind of personal conflicts caused their break-up? Will they ever come together to perform again? Or have popular tastes changed to make their music obsolete?

An indoor concert avoided the problems of an open outdoor concert where admission could not be collected from all customers. Michael McClure spoke in a foreign language. There are individualized performances. Note the dress of these performers, ordinary clothes rather than show costumes. You see the faces for each singers voice. These songs tell about personal viewpoints, there is nothing like The Eve of Destruction or Blowing in the Wind. One man tells about sixteen years on the road. [A rough way to make a living when you're middle-aged?] One attraction was meeting their female fans on the road. Note the cigarette smoking by the members; what was the long term effects?

Who paid Lawrence Ferlinghetti for his prayer parody? What did it add to this show? Traveling on the road has ended the careers of many singers. The Band quit while they were ahead instead of dying on the job, like Hank Williams, Buddy Holly, Elvis Presley, Otis Redding, etc. Those who stopped became less popular (Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis) but survived to old age. Theres always a trade-off in business. Touring is one way to sell records to fans who attend concerts. This movie would be better if it had less editorial comments.",1430179200,,1840,4.834920634920635

412375,1,6301971175,"This 1 star review is about the audio quality of the BD and not the movie itself. Get right to it: it's pretty bad. I listened to it thru a $300 Sony soundbar that I have had for months and I know what it can do and the soundtrack is muddy and the bass end is non-existant. The studio songs are better: the staged performance at the end as the credits begin to roll had the best audio quality of the movie. Just a major MAJOR disappointment. As far as audio goes watch clips (""Van the Man!"") on YT with a nice set of headphones and you will get a far better experience.

As for the movie: it is an RR vanity set-piece but it is neither the ""greatest concert film of all time"" nor a boring snooze-a-thon. Van and Muddy's performances are my favorites, I cant't get over Neil's choice of song AND couture, but overall I sure wish I had been there. It is beautifully filmed but there should have been more performing and less interviewing. Beyond my assessment of the audio quality everyone seems to be screechy and over-singing.

Overall I would give the film itself a 3 Star rating. It puts me to mind of the movie ""Dr Zhivago"", neither are the masterpieces rather too many claim them to be, but they are both worth sitting down and watching at least once so you can make up your own mind. I just wish The Last Waltz was worth listening to as well.",1410998400,2,1347,4.2578125

412496,4,6301971175,"You can't over-estimate the influence The Band had on music, and I'll leave it to other reviewers to attempt to document even a fraction of it. This is a valuable treasure of a DVD. That said, I read Levon Helm's book (""This Wheel's On Fire"") which leaves this concert--and the movie/production--heavily tainted to me. Robertson--too obviously--is front & center, on camera, the star of the show (and the scarf does get distracting, as if he needs that to hog your attention). Levon gets some screen time as lead vocalist on many songs, and Rich Danko, bass, is frequently seen since he is stationed next to THE STAR, but I can't figure out why Garth Hudson is relegated to 'hired help' status. And only the CIA using sophisticated computer software would be able to find Richard Manuel (which MAY be his own fault...reportedly so drunk at the time that he was almost a bystander, but STILL.....). And apparently Robertson was continuously trying to get Muddy Waters--a legend and influence on The Band--booted out...but made sure to keep Neil Diamond, who's only tie to the band was that Robertson was producing his album on the side. The high level of musicianship--and songwriting--comes through here, and the incorporation of friends who've either influenced or affected their careers is a terrific bonus. (And there's no denying Robertson's extreme talent as a songwriter and guitarist...able to sweeten up a song with understated fills and licks, yet capable of blowing you away with dynamic leads). The Band will always be under appreciated, in my book.",1406764800,2,1560,5.027027027027027

412989,1,6301971175,"Pay attention to ""The Shape I'm In"" sung by Richard Manuel in the 1st 15 minutes of the film. You'll hear a crisp horn passage just before Richard sings ""Way up yonder..."" The horns are tight and they add just the right amount of flourish to the song. However, they were recorded months after the show to ""augment"" the piece. Don't get me wrong- there were horns there that night, but this is just one example of the many frauds presented to the public by Robertson and Scorcese. One more- the camera focuses on Robbie Robertson as he sings harmony vocals in many songs. You would think that he was the lead singer as Laslo Kovacs or one of the other cinematographers frames his face and lovely locks. Only thing is his mic was turned off for the music portions, and turned on only for stage announcements. There are many other examples too numerous to mention here.

The Last Waltz is a fraud. It gives the public the impression that all of the musicians were in agreement with the decision to quit. Such was not the case, all of The Band minus Robertson, went out on the road 7 years later. I've read and heard interviews from younger musicians (Grace Potter and others) who say they were inspired by this film. I would suggest that they read Levon Helm's book ""This Wheels on Fire"" to read an alternative view of such received wisdom.",1381190400,10,1337,4.502057613168724

I wasn't at the concert, but I wonder if the film is even better.  Some of the world's best photographers, a great remixed soundtrack, and Scorsese's artful movement between concert and interviews with the group members make for a very rich experience.  A number of ""friends"" of The Band joined them for their swan song after 16 years on the road.  One of my favorite numbers was ""Helpless"" performed by Neil Young with Joni Mitchell doing backup vocals.  Another was ""The Weight"" with The Staples.  Bob Dylan does a twenty-minute set.

I play this movie every few years.  I last played it when Levon Helm died a year ago.  Robbie Robertson is the only one left.  As the movie says at the beginning:  Turn up the volume.  The Staple Singers are excellent, and the other guests aren't too shabby either.

Over the years The Band was not out in front (of Bob Dylan) and on top of the charts a lot, but you will remember the hits they did have on their own like ""Cripple Creek""  My favorite cut is Levon Helms playing the drums and singing ""Ophelia"" -- it is mesmerizing.

413318,4,6301971175,"For a number of years the Band was far and away my favorite musical group. Still, I hadn't gotten around to hearing or viewing `The Last Waltz' until last week. Knowing how live performances tend to go, naturally I expected some unevenness.

First of all, let's discuss the lead singing: Danko, their most usual lead singer, seemed to be trying his utmost to sing away from and around the melodies we were used to from the songs' recorded versions, not in the sense of being off-key, though that was happening occasionally; but it was more like he was inventing ways to refer to the original lines without actually singing them, almost constantly changing things melodically, and to a lesser extent rhythmically. It was inventive riffing, though what he ended up with usually wasn't solid enough to rival the original tracks. I thought that it made the song performances rather weak; it is very possible that he was, as we used to say, quite ripped.

The marvelous Manuel and Helm didn't display this degree of self-indulgence; their songs employed smaller amounts of improvisational flair; they sang their leads passionately, powerfully, and generally more in tune.

As for the non-Band performers, everyone did a very fine job of it; I thought the three best were Muddy Waters, Neil Young, and surprisingly, Neil Diamond.

Muddy Waters put on the most spirited performance, with his singing and what we might call jumpy personal choreography; and this was a fellow who at the time was getting on in years. He was well-dressed, and had a jocular, professional demeanor while singing this down-and-dirty blues standard.

Diamond, whose singles I generally don't enjoy listening to with the exception of his very first (""Solitary Man""), sang a song I had never heard, which was neither one of his singles nor one of their B-sides. This protest song was kind of reminiscent of the emotional tone of what Buffalo Springfield had sometimes done. It was a well written piece, and he totally nailed the performance. The song is titled ""Dry Your Eyes"" (not to be confused with the soul ballad of the same name, sung by Brenda and the Tabulations back around 1969).

Neil Young gave a killer performance of his song ""Helpless"". As folks know, when Young is singing lead in a song, there's really no room in the sonic palette for other vocalists; when the chorus comes, he dials it down perfectly (so all the voices can harmonize beautifully). Nevertheless, during the second verse, Joni Mitchell, whether by pre-arranged design or as a result of ego-frippery, began improvising these noodling counter-melodies which she couldn't pull off because of the inherent strength and richness of Young's lead. As such, most of the time she was singing out of key as there was nowhere for the notes to land. And Mitchell NEVER sings out of key. I generally love her singing to the max; but what she tried to do was based on a bad decision, in my opinion.

When Joni got around to singing her own song, she was on key, as is usual for her, but her enthusiasm seemed pale as compared with many of the other performers.

Bob Dylan didn't sing as well as on his recordings, but his stage presence and charisma were unequaled; I couldn't take my eyes off of him.
Robbie Robertson's guitar playing was excellent, until he was playing in the same song with Clapton; but who can match the brilliance of Clapton on the guitar?",1341964800,4,3399,4.808219178082192

413341,5,6301971175,"Has Martin Scorsese ever made a bad film? Well maybe the odd one, but this ain't one of them.

`The Last Waltz' is an elegy to the end of an era, the `Woodstock' generation of young, fresh, earnest and often virtuoso musicians writing and performing lyrical songs, with themes of political protest and poignant observations of human nature as common themes intermixed with more usual popular music fare. Made in 1976 (the year that `punk' first exploded on the scene full of vitality and unfocussed anger speaking to a new generation), Scorsese used the 25 November 1976 farewell concert of The Band, surely one of the most talented rock bands ever to take to the stage, as an armature on which to hang his tribute to the music of the 1966-76 decade, the defining backdrop to millions of lives during that period.

The film mixes stage performances from The Band, Bob Dylan, Muddy waters, Van Morrison, Joni Mitchell, Eric Clapton, Neil Young, Neil Diamond (bit of a surprise, but he fits right in) and others - separately, and then briefly all on stage together - with fly-on-the-wall rehearsal scenes and interviews with Robbie Robertson, Scorsese himself speaking about the making of the film, and shorter cameos.

You could be forgiven for thinking this neither-fish-nor-fowl format wouldn't work, but it does. The result is as fine a film as Scorsese has ever made in a long career of excellence: poignant, absorbing, intelligent, with a rich seam of sensationally great music holding it all together like a classy binding holds together a great work of literature. It's hard to fault Scorsese's editing of his 40 or so of hours of available material; the film is a textbook lesson in how to craft greatness from what might so easily have been, in the hands of a less skilled filmmaker, chaotic or mediocre.

This great film looks as good now as on its 1976 release; the passing years have enhanced its reputation and gained the attention of new, younger audiences. If you have never seen it, then you're in for a treat: you don't even need to be a fan of the music of this period to appreciate Scorsese's finely crafted piece of artistry but of course if you are, your viewing experience will be even better.",1326758400,3,2214,4.772845953002611

413373,5,6301971175,"This movie is a great testament to what The Band had accomplished in their ""short"" 16 year career together.  Some have mentioned how Robbie Robertson seemed to come off as the star of the show, but this was only natural as he and Martin Scorsese were at the biginning of their friendship.  It's great to see Richard Manuel's humor in his story telling and Rick Danko's lovable demeanor.  I had always wished that they could have included more of Garth Hudson's thoughts about The Band.  A true genius is Mr. Hudson, while Mr Helm was a little grumpy.
 Anyway, I was lucky enough to see the film when it first came out and I was just amazed by how powerful their music seemed to me.  Their playing and singing that night (Thanksgiving, 1976) let everyone know that they were still at the top of their game.  Maybe too, there was always a sense of sadness because the viewer knows that this was it for The Band.  As I look at this film again, the sadness is amplified by the fact that Messers Danko and Manuel have left life's stage, as well as some of their guests of that night.
 This film is truly great!  When I first saw it, the picture was really dark. Now it's color is bright.  If you're interested in the music of The Band and you haven't seen it, please do so!  I bought my copy through Amazon.com.",1314316800,2,1306,4.351239669421488

413398,1,6301971175,"Uless you give it 1 star= Whos this Jerk??-The only negative I have about this is the voulume of the sound-- ---Im disappointed that the sound is so low- in that I have to turn my reciever to almost as high as it will go to get the volume I need (which is fairly important with these kind of DVDs). But if I had to use my old manavox 5.1 DVD system, which at the time I bought it was heads and shoulders  ahead of the$100 boombox I had been using from from about 1996-2001, It probably would not reach volume significant enough to help me slide through these cracks of light in the dark of the night. So I would say its better on a system that has the ability to put out more volume then you would normally use, hope you understand- Neil Young is on and I gots to go. ( Maybe I should add that sometimes I have to use that system due to fates beyound my control.)
And Not to nit Pick- but this is a moive and not a concert disc Which is great if your looking for a movie to watch- but not as great if your looking for a concert to watch, its like the directors cut of Pink Floyd in Pompelli?? I really enjoyed  that version but if I just wanted the concert i plays the original version as interesting as the talk might be- at some point it would be nice to just hear the musical portion, I mean how often can you listen to the same guys saying that such and such just happened and so and so just showed up and thats how we made this great record- not as many times as you want to hear the great record- am I right?? --yes I have the volume to make this work-- and really as good as everyone is so far Joni Mithcello steals the show for me, may be a bit of exagerration, but it was the performance that most surprised me.
As to the volume Id sayIf I were to use a comparative scale, it would rank in the middle, Its not Cream royal albert hall, or Led Zepplin DVD from Mothership- But its not the doors DVD from that collection that has two cds and a DVD. The audio on the cds is OUTsTanding  but the DVD is merely interesting. its not so much the soumd Quality as it is volume that is the major problem here. It kind of seems impotent that the DVD of this concert should depend so much on how much money you had to waste on a sound system- Although to be fair most of the people who buy this probably have good-great sound systems- othewise they prorbably aren't that interested in music as an entertainment alternative.  its days later- I enjoy this DVD more each time I watch it - for different reasons-right now I kinda am enjoying the cimenatogrophy and the interviews more then I did before. Granted I usally view it at Corbet canyon where the views might be a bit skewed- but I sure wish the volume was  a little nutter butter peanutbutter bar better. What are you looking for in a review? A little peek into you?? Im my opinion you should purchases this, its not expensive- its both a fine piece of music and a good movie, don't take the food out of the babys mouth- but no reason to ride the fence Just DO IT- do it good- do it now do it till the cows come home.",1305331200,4,3070,4.067768595041322

I did, and I've just been watching my copies (BR and SE DVD) side-by-side, on a 50"" 1080p plasma, listening through a high-end HT system, and here are my thoughts. (Note: DVD was being viewed on a player that does a fine job of upconverting, so your DVD experience could be different.) Audio: Contrary to a few reviews below, I think the uncompressed DTS HD 5.1 mix on the Blu-ray is far superior to the 5.1 on the DVD. !!Note: the BR disc defaults to the compressed 5.1 track!! Be aware that the BR does NOT have the 2.0 stereo (uncompressed PCM, I assume) track from the DVD, so if that's what you prefer, you don't want the BR. Video: I also disagree that the video is not improved. I think it is sharper (of course, some might say that's less film-like and not an improvement) and the colors are more saturated. However, it is not a dramatic improvement, and by itself wouldn't justify the purchase. In addition, I think the flaws (scratches and sparklies) present from the film used for the transfer are far more noticeable on the BR. That maybe makes me slightly prefer the DVD video. It would be great if Criterion or somebody would give this film the total restoration it deserves, fixing that as well as restoring what some reviewers here say is footage lost from the original theatrical release, which I never had the pleasure of seeing. Put the missing special features back in, and maybe even add cutting-room floor of all the missing songs. A new 40th anniversary special edition, please!! Special features: Missing from the BR are--a) band members/others commentary track (the Robertson/Scorsese track only is included), b) archival outtake of jam session, c) photo gallery & d) trailers. Verdict: worth purchasing BR for improved uncompressed 5.1 audio, but don't give away your SE DVD copy.

Now, a MESSAGE FOR AMAZON. I suspect the majority of us viewing Blu-ray reviews, especially of concerts and classic films, are trying to decide whether it is worth upgrading from our DVD. So Amazon, please give me reviews of the BLU-RAY VERSION ONLY!!!! Yes, I know the main purpose of a typical review is to discuss the content, but that ain't necessarily so on Blu-ray remasterings of older titles. And I can always go to the DVD and VHS reviews (which should also be separated from each other, btw) for additional info.

413451,5,6301971175,"Okay, not ""very first taste,"" but very close to it.  This film was one of my first exposures to what a ""rock-umentary"" is all about.  It combines live footage from the legendary Thanksgiving 1976 concert at Winterland in San Francisco (after which The Band resolved to stop touring) with post-concert footage at their studio-cum-clubhouse, Shangri-La and on a Los Angeles sound stage.  In between the snippets of live footage, there are interview segments with all five Band members, providing history and exposition for all the live songs included in the film.  Plus, there is explanation as to the impact that the motley guest stars (Bob Dylan, Neil Diamond, Neil Young, Muddy Waters, Eric Clapton, Joni Mitchell, Dr. John, Bobby Charles, Ringo Starr, Ron Wood, Paul Butterfield,Van Morrison, Ronnie Hawkins, Emmylou Harris, the Staples) had on popular music up to that point.

Also of note on this DVD is the inclusion of both commentary tracks, one with The Band's Robbie Robertson & Director Martin Scorsese, the other with other surviving Band members Levon Helm & Garth Hudson, plus Ronnie Hawkins, Dr. John, Mavis Staples and various members of the production crew.  The film is in itself a treat, but the inclusion of these tracks makes it extra special.

On a personal note, two of my favorite things to watch & listen for during this movie are Robbie Robertson's distinctive guitar solos and all the points when Garth Hudson is spotlighted (from his breathtaking Lowrey organ/synthesizer solos to his accordion on ""Evangeline"" to his soprano saxophone playing during ""It Makes No Difference"").",1294704000,,1604,5.1461538461538465

413487,4,6301971175,"To the extent this movie is supposed to be a document of The Band, it is significantly flawed. It essentially fawns over Robbie Robertson, and makes the rest of the band (except Helm) look like boobs.  The Band had three primary singers--none who were named Robertson--yet it is he who occupies center stage and gets all sorts of camera attention while ostensibly singing--although it looks to me like he's lip-synching.  The snub of Richard Manuel is particularly grating. Only one (out of at least a dozen Band songs played) is his (""The Shape I'm In""), and the camera simply ignores him while he is singing ""I Shall be Released"".  The off stage interviews involving Manuel, Danko, and Hudson are terrible.  Surely the filmmaker could have shown them in a better light.

A movie about The Band that doesn't include the performance of ""Chest Fever"" (except for a truncated version of Garth Hudson's intro), is akin to a film about Led Zeppelin that includes only 30 seconds or so of ""Stairway to Heaven"".  Somehow The Last Waltz manages to diminish the importance of ""Chest Fever"" to The Band's history.

To anyone who wants to know what The Band was about, and why they were great, I heartily recommend Music from Big Pink, The Band (the brown album), and maybe the Basement Tapes.

The music of the Band's various guests is generally quite good and redeems this movie to some extent.",1286236800,,1386,4.7698744769874475
413488,5,6301971175,"$6.99? Are you kidding me? How much closer to getting it for FREE do you need it to be? Actually, IMHO, this DVD should be given away for free...to every 12 year old kid entering Junior High School. Day 1 at School ""hello class, for your first assignment you are required to watch Martin Scorcese/The Band's ""Last Waltz"" ""basically by doing so you will learn more about music, film making, interpersonel relationships and man's psychological struggles... than you will in anything else you do here in your next 6 years....all in 120 minutes"".

I have seen this sooo many times since I went to see it at the Theater as a 12 year old when it first came out. Every time I watch it I get something new out of it, something subtle that I originally missed. This is unquestionably the greatest Rock and Roll movie ever made. The whole thing is a wonder to be seen,  phenomenal. The interviews are classic and telling, not so much in words but in emotions, body language and silence. My hi-lites are Ronnie Hawkins the man who put the Band on the map when they were The Hawks. Ronnie has the least profile of any of the artists on stage that night but don't tell him that. Watching him strut around stage to a ripping ""Who Do You Love"" is riveting, almost worth the price of admission itself. Joni Mitchell makes me drool, so beautiful and elegant. Neil Diamond is dripping cool and studliness. Van Morrison is out of his mind doing ""Caravan"". Neil Young is whacked out on something (white powdery substance gracing much of his face) but I find ""Helpless"" to be just average. All you Clapton fans can see him in pretty good shape for a change on his numbers and Dylan is pure Rock majesty. The Band doing ""The Weight with the Staple's singers is sooo good, makes my spine tingle. The glittering image of Rick Manual during the intro to ""Stagefright"" is classic. What the heck did he take before the show?

The Band's own music is amazing. The talent these 5 guys had will never be seen again. They could play circles around anyone else at the time, write and sing like Angels , every one of them save for Garth. They all had there own styles and signatures, unmistakably unique.. Polished musicians as a reult of years and years on the road playing with every one and having seen everything imaginable out there in the Rock and Roll world. The Band could rock and bring tears to your eyes. Imagine the Dead... but guys who could write , sing and play. (not gonna get alot of love for that I know).

The thing that fascinates me the most about this story is not so much the music anymore but the story behind the demise. The first few times I saw it as a kid, I could never quite figure out why the heck they were splitting up. They were doing so well, so much struggle and effort to get to the top and then to pull the plug on it all very suddenly. Why?

Robbie Robertson is way too cheery and relieved that it was all coming to an end...the other guys not so much..
You watch the Band's segments and all you see are 5 guys who are simply dripping with musical talent, these guys were born to sing and play and pretty much nothing else, save for Robertson who had it all mapped out as a solo star for years to come. Handsome , well spoken , great guitarist and feet firmly planted in Hollywood. Robertson was poised to be bigger than ever in the coming years. Its painful to watch the others in this film struggle with there own individual identies and the foretelling prophecy that life would be hard from here on in. Scorcese spends alot of time asking them... ""well, its over...what are you going to do now?"" The answers are pretty jumbled and saddening , Danko's silence when asked of this is in fact haunting. We all know the sad stories of Danko and Manuel and how they both painfully checked out eventually. Just makes my heart break. Am I bitter about Robertson, yeah, a little but who is to say that they wouldnt have eventually floundered after 2-3 more years? I saw The Band without Robertson in 83, they were brilliant. You know what, I didn't feel like Robertson was missed at all in fact. Everything I needed was there, the hearts and souls of 4 crack musicians who lived to play... and played to live.

God Bless The Band and Scorcese for doing such a wonderful job making this film.",1285804800,,4291,4.411616161616162
413489,5,6301971175,"This is a terrific combination (BluRay/standard DVD) of perhaps the best music performance video documentary of all time. When Martin Scorsese directs a movie, you know there is going to be attention to detail and intensity. The guest performers are diverse and mostly at their best, especially, Dr. John, Dylan, Joni Mitchell (""Coyote"" is Mitchell at her most sublime). Even Neil Diamond rises above his ultra-pop persona and hits it. Plus, the interview with members of The Band show  a side of them not seen before. Somewhat heartbreaking to realize that super handsome-charismatic Rick Danko and a more inroverted, quirky Richard Emanuel are now dead. But it's mostly about the music and the performances -- and they are worth every penny as The Band serves as a backup for the invitees as well as front and center for themselves.

413542,3,6301971175,"Let me just preface that I am a huge fan of The Band. I always preferred them to bands like Grateful Dead. Levon Helm's voice came straight out of the smoky, Civil War-era hills. While this movie looks good and sounds good, the abundance of post-gig doctoring (overdubs) hampers this document, in my book. Watch the left hand of the late, great bassist Rick Danko (RIP) during the Eric Clapton song - the shot where Danko is left (closest to the camera), with Robertson in the middle and Clapton on the right (background). Danko's hand (both of them, actually) don't match the sound. According to Levon Helm, the film was riddled with overdubs, but not by Helm. In Helm's autobiography, he talks about how he refused to record overdubs for his drumming and his voice for the movie. While I'm sure that much of the soundtrack is live, there's a good portion that isn't (much of it is evidenced by Danko's hands; curiously, Robertson's back or side is aimed at the camera for some of his soloing, too, which might raise some suspicion, although his frontal shots seem live), and for a musician, watching their hands not matching up to the sonics, well, it's a flaw that dampens the experience. I know almost every live album and DVD has some post-production tampering, but ""The Last Waltz"" has too many blatant examples. And speaking of the visuals, what is up with this DVD version's crop job? Originally, Scorsese's film crew, despite all the coke, did a pretty decent job of framing the musicians with the cameras, although now the fake letterboxing mat (black bars slapped onto the top and bottom of an already cropped, if not completely pan-and-scan/full-frame image, render Danko's bass and Robertson's guitar invisible for way too long. Here's hoping that a true widescreen version of this - and Pink Floyd's ""Live at Pompeii"" - is reissued on DVD, with the full film negative image on the disc. Again, I love The Band.

The Founder providing, perhaps, the only smile in the whole film.

Backstage interviews feature all the members, who, worldwearily contribute road stories, making us feel the their fatigue.

Don't know what Neil Diamond has to do with this music, but I'm no Band (or Diamond expert). Another very minor complaint, is in the lack of face-on, close-up, audience cutaways.

Happily, there are no hokey
introductions or buddy buddy mutual self-congratulation. The guests just come on and do their thing with the vigorous help of The Band. Despite excellent performances by all, with a special bow to Neil Diamond, who turns in a fine performance amongst all these Authentic Rock people, it is Bob Dylan for whom all wait, and Dylan, without whom it could not have been half so good. Not that his performance, in itself, rose above those of the others, it is simply that his mystique adds a dimension that lesser figures in the Rock World cannot match.
I rarely watch the extra stuff but this time I did watch the conversation of the Producer, Robertson, and the  Director,Scorsese. It proved a worthwhile lesson in the details of film-making which gives us an inkling of the kind of skills needed by a director.

Musicians will appreciate the seat of the pants vibe on many tunes where members of the Band look for cues from guest stars as to where things may be going next, especially with Bob Dylan. Rick Danko's stunning singing on many of the Band's classic songs, especially ""Stagefright,"" is a standout. Of course, Levon Helm was a genius drummer whose singing was amazing on ""The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down."" Could a song like that, romanticizing the Rebel South, get out today? Hhmmm. Garth and Richard have great moments, too. Much has been made of Robbie Robertson's hogging of the spotlight. But honestly, there seems a hard reason for that: clearly, he was the smartest, most articulate one of the bunch. And, he set up the whole film, which grew from a smaller idea into the stunning 32mm film that it became. Musicians aren't often great talkers, but he was. He makes the others look like rubes. Van Morrison's turn here is eye-opening. You gaze slack jawed at Neil Young in his prime. And Muddy Waters, Dr. John and Ronnie Hawkins all shine. Neil Diamond, who seems out of place with his one less than stellar song, was there because he represented Tin Pan Ally songwriters, of which he was a great one, as the band was trying to show where all its influences came from: blues, country, folk, show etc. These guys had played for 16 years on the road when they made this, and their fine-tuning really showed.",1267488000,,1618,4.525597269624574
413574,5,6301971175,"This is one of my favorite concert films (and I have thousands in my collection). I have owned it on VHS, DVD, DVD (Special edition) and my favorite, on Laserdisc. I thought I had experienced this historic concert until I saw it on Blu-Ray. I was shocked how clear the images were and how much that added to the enjoyment of concert.

I must admit that I am totally confused that, once again, the best few seconds of the film that were my favorite moment in the entire film were missing. On the VHS, at the end of ""The Weight"" Mavis Staples of The Staples is seen to look satisfied and heard to say ""beautiful."" She is right in enjoying what was truly a moving version of the over-played Band song.

The Band is an amazing group from several perspectives: (1) they have made an important contribution to the history of rock at its finest state-of-the-art since their early days with Ronnie Hawkins (you need to watch Ronnie in their one video doing the ""Moonwalk"" in 1958!) to their Last Waltz days and post-Last Walk ""quartet"" and Cates Brothers-based editions. When you hear them back up singers as diverse as Joni Mitchell and Muddy Waters without EVER losing their unique sound or dominating the guests' performance, you know how unique they are.

As a side note, one of my favorite moments of the film is Robbie Robertson telling the oft-told story of their 1965 visit to Helena Arkansas to visit with Sonny Boy Williamson II and jam with him. I am writing a biography of Sonny Boy Williamson II based on extensive oral history interviews with his friends, family, neighbors, and fellow musicians.

Helena Arkansas is a key player in this story as is nearby Turkey Scratch, a rural town of about 70 people today, from which both Levon (pronounced Lavonne in the area) Helm and Robert Lockwood Jr. (Robert Johnson's stepson and Sonny Boy II's and B. B. King's band leader during the 1940s and 1950s.)
Helena was arguably the landlocked state of ""Arkansas' seaport.""  It offered jobs to non-sharecropper blacks in a Chrysler plant, a piano factory and on the docks shipping cotton grown on Arkansas' delta.

If you wanted to go over to Mississippi, Mr. Jenkins would take you over on his ferry. Mr. Jenkins son, Harold, learned to play by practicing his band using the instruments left in the KFFA radio studio by Sonny Boy Williamson II's band that played each weekday noon on ""King Biscuit Time."" Harold would later change his name to ""Conway Twitty"".

For a 70 mile radius of Helena which include about 10% of the black population of America at the time, this pioneering blues show (still airing each day today) began in 1941 and made Sonny Boy II the first media star of the South and influenced the entire generation of blues musicians who migrated from the Deep South to Chicago.
In the spring of 1965, Dale Hawkins, Ronnie Hawkins' cousin, told me he got his first drink from Sonny Boy's bottleSonny Boy's invitation  outside at of KFFA'a studios.

Sonny Boy had returned to Helena expecting to die there and did. The two previous years he had spend 17 months in England, starring on the American Folk Blues Festival (AFBF) 1963 and 1964 seasons as well as recording albums with the Eric Clapton-led Yardbirds and Eric Burdon-lean Animals and Chris Barber (six years before Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf and Chuck Berry's ""London albums."") Check out the AFBF DVDs released recently. He had serious health problems (I suspect the spitting blood story in The Last Waltz is because he had drunk so much for so long that it had eaten away the lining of his esophagus.

Anyway, he had returned to the site of his biggest early US successes and locals believed that he must have been ""playing for the troops"" instead of playing the greatest music halls of Europe.

The day in question, The Band arrived in town looking for him. Having arrived too late to catch him leaving KFFA's studios where he did King Biscuit Time, they asked around for anyone who had seen him. Chris Strachwitz of Arhoolie Records was in town cutting a deal with Sonny Boy to release an album of his Trumpet recordings. The Band (then Levon & The Hawks) saw him and asked him if he had seen Sonny Boy and he told them he had seen him walking down a specific street and a man in a unique multi-colored suit (the right half black and the left half grey) was not hard to find. Chris never knew who they were and wasn't interested in signing them anyway as he said ""I wanted that Boogie Blues.""

The Band and Sonny Boy II jammed that night as Robbie Robertson said (the only American musician in The Band that knew Sonny Boy well was Levon Helm. I saw a similar unreleased interview with Rick Danko that showed that he didn't know much about Sonny Boy's history.) and went on their way after asking their manager to set up a bi-racial ""salt and pepper"" tour. While at Tony Mart's in Somers Point NJ, (check out the opening scene in Eddie and the Cruisers as they enter the bar and say ""Tell Tony the Cruisers are here."") they got the sad phone call while at Tony Mart's from Sonny Boy's representatives telling them Sonny Boy had died.

If Sonny Boy had lived another few months, he might have been a member of The Band when they joined Bob Dylan. Although Dylan didn't need another harp player in the band, if Sonny Boy, already a well-known to European and British audiences, had opened for him, he might have gotten a very different reception (without the Boos) at his concerts. Check out ""Don't Look Back"" the documentary of the next year's Bob Dylan tour of England.

Subsequent interviews with Robbie add to this story on both his documentary ""Robbie Robertson: From the Band to The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame"" and The Band: The Authorized Biography"", ""Classic Albums: The Making of The Band"" and on the Japanese Laser Discs ""The Band is Back"" and ""Made in Japan: The Band Japan Tour 1983"": The Japan Tour."" Finally, the circle is completed when Eric Clapton leaves Cream and visits Woodstock intending to ask to join The Band (and chickens out).

The Last Waltz was an important turning point in the history of America Rock `n' Roll as The Band's connections with so many of their fellow pioneers changed that history.",1267056000,,6195,4.629326047358834

413597,3,6301971175,"This is one of my all time favorite concert movies. It definitely has that Martin Scorcese style that has become so well known and the talent assembled is staggering. I heard the bluray had completely remastered sound, re-engineered by the surviving band members so I jumped at the chance to test out my new theater system with a classic. I was pretty disappointed to say the least. I know much of it is live and over 30 years old now but it seemed like all the remaster did was turn up the loudness. I'm what many consider an audiophile. That's a person who is obsessed with high-quality audio reproduction. This is usually achieved through high end hardware. My theater system is a Rotel processor, Sherbourn 5 channel amp, Jamo Concerto series surround, and a Bay Audio sub. All mid to high end gear. I got the Sherbourn amp recently and was looking to hear amazing things out of this blu ray and I was disappointed. It's only slightly better than the DVD. I have been selectively adding to my BR collection only movies that have visual and audio qualities that would benefit from the increased resolution and uncompressed audio technology. Movies like Sin City, Kill Bill, Apocalypto, Snow Falling On Cedars and The Dark Knight are great because they are visually and audibly dramatic and their filmed qualities are sufficient to translate well into digital format. Movies that don't translate well: most comedies (what's the point in spending the extra $10 on a clearer copy of Blazing Saddles?), old TV series (stuck in 4:3), films that are not remastered. I think that this movie fits into that category of movies that are just as good on DVD unfortunately.",1264550400,4,1664,4.78125
413598,5,6301971175,"Great movie, I watched it and all of the extras and spent a bunch of time reading up on the band and their albums. But I still don't have an answer to the question that has been plaguing me: so many people are seen playing Fender Stratocasters in the film (Robbie Robertson, Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan, Ron Wood), why do they picture a Fender Telecaster as the main symbol on the cover? Maybe we'll never know. The film was directed by Martin Scorsese and shows The Band playing a gala ""final"" concert (they reformed without Robbie Robertson a few years later anyway) that marked a long break from touring and recording. The party was held in San Francisco, they served a turkey dinner since it was Thanksgiving, and they had actual waltzing. The bands played from 8:00PM to 2:30AM. While The Band can come off as a bit dull, old-worldly on the recordings, watching them is great because they all really look like they're having a great time. Levon Helm, the drummer, you get to see how he holds his drumsticks with the traditional grip, but the left-hand drumstick grip-outward. Robbie Robertson, well-known from his later career, is the only Bandmember  who doesn't sing, despite the fine, raspy singing voice we all know him to possess. Garth Hudson, nutty and classical-trained, is not seen often. The editing of the film is strange, with the last number of the evening played first, interspersed with interview dialogue, and then non-concert bits, such as ""The Weight"" recorded with the Staples Singers (great, great, great), and ""Evangeline"" with Emmylou Harris (great, great, great).  While the musical add-ons are fantastic, you would wonder why non-concert bits are included in a film document about a concert. Great scene with The Band, Neil Young and Joni Mitchell, the Canadian music mafia, singing Young's ""Helpless"", a song about ""a town in north Ontario.""  That's Ontario in Canada, not Ontario in California.",1263772800,,1921,4.9411764705882355
413599,5,6301971175,"There are valid criticisms of this movie but if you are a fan of the Band and the roots/Americana music performed by most of their guests, you should own The Last Waltz. We've probably watched our copy 50 or more times, and our seven-year-old recognizes the performers when he hears them on the radio. Whatever their inner turmoil, and if drummer Levon Helm's account in ""This Wheel's on Fire"" is accurate there was plenty of turmoil, Rick Danko, Helm and Robbie Robertson appear to be putting everything they've got into their performances. It's remarkable to watch the Band accompany their guests with skill and respect. Helm's drumming particularly blew me away, and of course the Band's three singers, Danko, Helm and Richard Manuel, are among the most expressive rock vocalists ever. Contrary to appearances, however, Robertson's microphone was turned off because he's really a very poor singer. Which leads to the criticisms:

1. There is way too much Robbie Robertson, particularly in the interview segments, but in fairness, I don't know if it would have been possible to get much more out of the others. As Levon Helm's ""This Wheel's on Fire"" acknowledges, the members of the Band were all, except possibly Garth Hudson, strung out on various chemicals by the mid-1970s, leaving Robertson, strung out himself but apparently more functional, as de facto leader. By the Last Waltz, nobody else was writing songs or making decisions, and Robertson's own songwriting had gone downhill badly after the first two albums. One hears different motivations for Robertson's decision. Maybe he didn't want to continue if the quality couldn't be maintained. Maybe he felt, with punk and disco on the horizon, that the Band's time was coming to an end. Maybe he wanted to concentrate on his movie-star ambitions. Whatever the reasons, the others, who could not count on songwriting royalty income (Helm claims they did participate in songwriting but were cheated out of their rights), were not happy about Robertson's decision. Stoned, embittered, and viewing the Last Waltz as a vanity project for Robertson, they may not have had much to contribute to the interview segments. Nonetheless, that's no excuse for the concert footage itself focusing so heavily on the lip-synching Robertson while Garth Hudson and Richard Manuel are practically invisible.

2. What is Neil Diamond doing in this movie? I don't care what kind of relationship Diamond had with Robbie Robertson. Whatever his merits, Diamond's Brill Building pop style sticks out from the other roots-oriented performers like an unwelcome surprise in the punchbowl. We always skip this segment, but for Diamond's fans, it's probably the only segment of the movie worth watching.

3. Many reputed-to-be-great performances are omitted. Apparently Scorcese and his crew were as stoned as the musicians, and the cameras of the day required constant re-loading that disrupted the filming.

4.  If you are not a fan of the Band, you will find this movie long and boring.

5.  The extras, with only Robertson and Scorcese participating, are reasonably interesting but but self-serving. Unfortunately Danko and Manuel had passed away, Helm was too embittered to participate, and Hudson, well, who knows about him.

For reference the guest list includes:
Ronnie Hawkins
Neil Young
Dr. John
Paul Butterfield
Eric Clapton
Muddy Waters
Joni Mitchell
Van Morrison
Bob Dylan

Overall a remarkable record of great performances by some of the most gifted A-list musicians of the day. And a note to Levon Helm who so bitterly hates this movie and resents that he's never made a dime off it: It does introduce new generations to the music and the people who played it. I know who you are because of this movie. My kids know who you are because of this movie. We listen to your new stuff and hope to come to one of your Midnight Rambles because of this movie. So maybe it's not as bad as all that.",1262649600,,3934,5.030721966205837

413601,5,6301971175,"this is short as others have reviewed the film well. i am somewhat prejudiced as the band is my favorite band of all time and i never tire of hearing them play.

the last waltz was a magical night and i'm glad scorcese took on the project. that being said, why in the world could this new blu ray transfer not include the unedited ""it makes no difference""? having listened to it from my various last waltz CDs at least 1000 times, it's jarring when the film comes to the first edit and i have to mentally re-engage and remind myself that, ""oh, yeah; this is where scorcese really screws it up."" i simply cannot imagine why anyone thought 90 seconds would make a difference in the overall length of the film--but i cannot think of any other reason for the cut. it could not be that one of roberston's finest songs ever was thought to be too boring to go on for 6:30 or so. thankfully, it lives on forever, uncut, complete, and beautiful in the CD.

now, another thing: bill graham's ""wolfgang's vault"" on the internet has just released the raw audio of the entire concert to their website but when i say ""raw"", i mean ""RAW"". i was amazed at how much overdubbing and sweetening had to be done in the studio to clean it up and produce what we know today as ""the last waltz"".

one last thing: the blu ray version has an incredibly annoying ""click"" sound when you select any item in any sub-menu. like ""swing-from-the-shower-curtain-after-hanging-yourself-with-your-necktie"" annoying.

413602,4,6301971175,"I had the good fortune, having just moved to San Francisco, to be the guest of Capitol Records to attend this concert. It was advertised at the time, to be The Band's last performance and Bob Dylan might show up. The tag line was ""share The Last Waltz with The Band and 5,000 of their friends."" How could i not attend?
Bill Graham had Thanksgiving Dinner served for all 5,000 guests while the Berkeley Promenade Orchestra played waltz music replete with 30 or so couples dressed to the nines. The lights went down and what followed was an endless stream of the biggest names in music in the late 70's. I have to admit that by the time Dylan came out, i was exhausted! The night was beyond magic as everyone from Neil Young to Neil Diamond, Dr. John to Kinky Friedman, Ringo Star to Van Morrison and of course Bob Dylan...then...lets not forget that this was the first time that Neil Young and Steven Stills  were on the same stage together following a long running feud. It was a touching moment...sadly the on-stage hug moment was lost in editing. (I had heard that when Neil Young saw the film...he decided to sober up a bit and back off the drug use.) The only other bit about this film that i didn't like is that the tune ""The Weight"" was performed by the Staple Singers.
I recall waiting and waiting for The Band to play it, but they were saving it for the last song of the night. The problem was that when the time came to play it...The Band had had a little too much fun back stage and sadly were unable to do it justice. The Staples Singers weren't there but were added later.
Having been there was the treat of a lifetime, and having this on Blue-Ray is as close as it gets to the magic of that night. The interviews are great and the music is superb. When the film ends..you will feel like you were there.",1260316800,5,1815,4.32258064516129

I remember references to their name, but did not realize that is what they called themselves.  I remember one or two of the songs that made it on the radio in the sixties. At that time, I was totally into the Fab Four (John, Paul, Ringo and George).

These gentlemen are accomplished musicians. I enjoyed their ""story songs"" and how they meld varied styles, e.g., rhythm and blues, country, rock, and rock and roll to name a few, into super sounds and words.  Most touching, however, is the palpable feeling of connection between these gentleman and their polished ensemble playing and singing that Scorsese's filming and direction reveals.

413627,5,6301971175,"I remember when This first came out. I saw it in the Theatre and had it on tape and DVD before finally getting The Blu-Ray version. I love music deeply and I remember ""The Band"" and those early days of Rock and Roll. I have been in and out of Music myself and have some small appreciation of what it is to make music and what it is to have and run a band. This Movie is a wonderfull collection of roots music with some of the best talent in the world comming together to celebrate one of the most influential groups of the Era. The performances are stunning and the range of talent that came together for this ""LAST WALTZ"" is like a phone directory of Who's Who in the Music business. The filming and lighting and sound are fantastic. Even if you are not old enough to remember these guys and this type of music may not be your cup of tea I highly reccomend it anyway. You will get a sense of things from a unique perspective and a beautiful one at that. Also there are quite a few short interviews with some very interesting Tid bits about Music, the business, other musicians and various events that make this like a little biography complete with music and Video. Its a music lovers dream especially if you were alive back then.

This review is of The Blu-Ray version But if you don't have a Blu-Ray player I have owned The regular DVD version and it is of very good quality but The Blu-Ray is the best because Scorcesse recorded this on 35mm film which really makes a difference when you master a film to Blu-Ray.(they had originally planned to record the event on 16mm)

On a side note This film was done as a colaboration between Robbie Robertson and Martin Scorcesse. There are a lot of people who have a beef with this because some band members later on aired their dirty laundry after the film came out, But I think its totally irrelivent about the internal politics and personal rubs inside ""The Band"" itself. Anyone who has ever had a band will tell you that its like a family and Families usually have lots of quarrels and disagreements and do terrible things to each other behind closed doors. Also there is usually one person Who calls the shots. Bands are usually like that too. Robbie Robertson was the leader and owned most of the rights to the music.

I never saw them perform live, and I enjoyed seeing how versatile they were: Levon Helm playing the mandolin, Rick Danko playing the fiddle and string bass. I was dismayed to see how Robbie Robertson was given the star treatment and allowed to eclipse his fellow Band members. He isn't impressive enough to justify so much attention, although he certainly was cute in those days! Another theme which kinda fell through was the ""waltz"" motif, including the Band performing the waltz tune just before the ending credits. That seemed very stilted.

The thing which really hit me hard was the self-destructive behavior of many of the performers. In watching this film for the first time more than 30 years after it was made, and knowing how Paul Butterfield, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel are no longer with us due to their long term alcoholism and drug abuse, and having heard the story about Neil Young (I heard it was a big lump of cocaine stuck up his nostril), it is really sad to watch them in action on the stage, and during the interviews. On the stage, Young & Paul Butterfield seem to be just about holding themselves together, and Eric Clapton is brilliant but obviously vegged out on heroin. Very sad. On the other hand, Joni Mitchell was riveting--intense and focused.

They're obviously stoned during the interviews (except Levon Helm, who seemed like the only one with genuine charm), and the interviews are all so boring--people who are stoned can't usually express themselves in a very articulate fashion. The personalities all seemed so shallow to me--disillusioning. The most revealing thing to me is how much I've evolved:  that if I'd seen the film the year it was made, I probably would've thought they were all incredibly cool!",1249171200,,1887,4.890625

Not only do you have The Band playing some of their greatest songs such as ""Stage Fright"", ""The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down"" and ""Up On Cripple Creek"". But they are joined by such incredible artists as Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell and Van Morrison. I especially loved Muddy Waters' stirring rendition of ""Mannish Boy"" and Neil Young's ""Helpless"". The soulful, gospel inspired vocals of the Staples Singers on ""The Weight"" was also a highlight.

But what really takes this to an even higher level of artistry is the talent of director Martin Scorsese and his production crew. The editing, lighting and camera work are all light years beyond the typical concert film. Also the interviews with The Band are done in such a way that it's not just a bunch of guys talking. But rather is intended to be a commentary about the joys and sorrows of life on the road as well as the history of American music and how rock and roll arose as a hybrid form of blues, country, gospel, jazz and myriad other styles of music and entertainment.

The DVD also includes some excellent special features such as audio commentaries from Scorsese and Robbie Robertson, an archival jam session and a short documentary, called ""Revisiting The Late Waltz"",  with an older Robertson and Scorsese discussing the making of the movie.

But then, I am not taken with the interviews except to the extent that they illustrate what life on the road can be like for a rock and roll band. I've loved The Band mostly because they always evoke Americana in a way that no other R&R band has been able to do.  As I recall, the Allman Bros and the Grateful Dead recommended The Band as the third headliner for Watkins Glen, and they certainly knew what the music was all about.  Is Rock of Ages ""better""?  You bet!  But, Rock of Ages does not have Emmylou and The Band doing Evangeline. It does not have Paul Butterfield and The Band doing Mystery Train.  And it does not have The Staples and The Band doing The Weight as a gospel tune (almost).  There is one point that The Last Waltz does make, though I don't know if Scorcese was trying to make it, and that is that Rick Danko was a helluva musician and as central to the band's success as Helm's vocals and Robertson's lyrics.

413753,5,6301971175,"I too was absolutely mesmerized by this film.  So wonderfully captured; the time, essence and images of a group so filled with talent, we will never find again, I fear.  I grew up with the Band's music remembering their songs in middle school and later high school.  They were highlighted in Peter Fonda's great depiction of the rebellious 'Easy Riders'.  And when I heard Robbie say, '16 years on the road', I was incredulous that someone didn't break the run years earlier.  The road had 'taken the great ones' So for Robbie Robertson to quit when he did amongst the angst of the rest, especially Levon, 'Levon wears his war-wound like a crown', is understandable beyond reasonable. How gracious to play back-up to such a host of big names and at the same time perform your best songs so well.  Just wonderful!  To see Robbie featured in this film in no way detracted from its purpose and overall theme to say good-bye and thank all the folks who provided impetus and encouragement to their music.  Robbie was the most expressive and articulate of the team and toward the end, was a surrogate father to those not enduring so well on the road due to substance abuse.  He had had enough and you could hear it in his interviews. Even at the time of the filming, Robbie was separated from his wife and living with Scorsese.  If indeed, there were objections to the final cut, these could have been made in plenty of time for editing.  Lord knows they had the footage.  Only after the final production do we hear cries of imbalance.  Sigh.  Put a sock in it.
Having said that, if I was consulted for the final cut, I would have featured Richard Manuel and Levon Helm's phenomenal voices.  They were the heart of 'The Band' as was Robbie's stunning lead guitar. But the film does capture the essence of the group's synergy.  The value of this group as a whole, exceeds by a thousand times, the sum of it's individual parts.  In short, they were awesome when cooking on all 5 cylinders. But, the world sometimes is very cruel with these things. They want, want, and want more to the demise of our best, not realizing how frail they really are.  The Band had given more than enough and since their music is immortal, we can all go back and listen, over and over again.  With the 'The Last Waltz' we now can watch it too.",1195948800,,2314,4.492822966507177

413769,4,6301971175,"""The Last Waltz"" is ostensibly a record of the ""The Band""'s famous final concert but it is as much a celebration of musicians and musicianship. This is no hagiography, however - Scorsese does not shirk away from the seediness of the life of the Band-musicians. Yes the Scorsese ""edge"" is certainly present. This contrast actually makes the performances on stage appear all the more magical.

As well as musical performances - including such stellar guests such as Neil Young, Van Morrison, Eric Clapton, and Bob Dylan - the film is interspersed with interviews with the band members dominated it must be said by Robbie Robertson. Robertson, himself, comes across as rather smug and pretentious in comparison to the other Band-members.

Robertson and Scorsese obviously struck it off well during the making of this film because Scorsese used his services on many of his other films - most recently ""The Departed"".

I remember seeing this film/concert on Showtime years ago, & it still sounds fresh every time I watch it now on this great DVD version.  (And I watch it at least once a week).  Here's the riff in all of this; aside from the 10 bucks each that Garth was charging the guys for music lessons, .. I thought Robbie had passed away, for the last 20 years.  I had read this in a Rock Encyclopedia 20 some years ago, & believed it; & thought that rock had lost one of ""the great musicians"" of our time.  Whether it be songwriting, or guitar playing, or producing, this man has made a significant contribution to music that is hard to rival.  I don't care what Levon says .. lol .. & that is not to diminish Levons' own unique contributions.  Robbie was the ""guiding force"" & leader of ""The Band"".  Well, I very gladly learned that Robbie had not passed away during the Hall of Fame induction ceremony for Jackson Browne & Bob Seger .. the camera panned to a table where Bruce Springsteen & Robbie Robertson were sitting.  I thought I'd seen a ghost .. ""that's him, I know it is"" & thankfully it was.  I later learned that Richard Manuel had passed, & was incorrectly reported as Robbie.  Both Richard & Rick Danko are gone now.  Let's appreciate the surviving members.  The Last Waltz has so many great moments; but one of my favorites is when Eric Clapton's guitar strap breaks & Robbie picks it up without missing a beat!!!  ""The Man"" .. & the camera pans to Clapton who is smiling with gleaming approval of the performance.  I thought Van Morrison gave the best guest performance as well.

413794,4,6301971175,"Whether you enjoyed the Band as backup to Bob Dylan during the breakthrough part of his career or when they went out on their own this is a film that any Band fans can appreciate. This is the 1976 farewell concert for them and as filmed by a younger Martin Scorcese it shows both the style he was to use in latter documentary- type films and the limits of improvisation to hold a film together. In any case the intertwining of personal commentary by members of the band between acts gives more depth to the film than just filming the concert itself (as Jonathan Demme recently did in his Neil Young film).

For those who appreciate the back up abilities of the Band and their multifaceted talents with musical instruments they are present throughout the film. Highlights include Muddy Waters doing Mannish Child, Ronnie Hawkins on Who Do You Love?, Van Morrison on Radio and Bob Dylan leading the cast in I Shall Be Released. For those who were saddened when the Band broke up Robbie Robinson gave one of the best reasons for doing so that I have ever heard- why tempt the fickle fates that the music gods have in store for those who stay on stage too long. Why, indeed?
******
It's funny sometimes how when you are hooked into certain musical vibes like going back in the day to classic rock `n' roll things, things like remembrances of long lost bands, turn up in odd places. That is the case here with the Martin Scorsese documentary film, The Last Waltz, the filming of The Band's last concert. And here is the sequence of how I got there. I had heard, several years ago, that Bob Dylan was putting out as part of his now seemingly never-ending official boot-leg series, some work that he did with The Band back in the mid-1960s when he was ""hiding"" out with them after his motorcycle accident out in the Woodstock (ya, that Woodstock) area of upstate New York making all kinds of interesting music from a number of genres. I made a mental note to check it out  but did not pursue the thought until recently  Then I headed to a local library to see if they had a CD of the work since they had other in the series (and in fact has a separate Dylan drawer for all of their CD collection of him). They didn't have it, or rather it was out. So I went to the Dylan drawer to check on some other possibilities and there I found a set of five CD's entitled the ""Real Woodstock Sessions Boot-leg"" series (or something like that). And that find contained (along with plenty of odd-ball outtakes and other miscellanea) some incredible versions of famous folk, folk rock, and country songs like Joshua Gone Barbados, Spanish Is The Loving Tongue, I Forgot To Remember To Forget Her, and stuff like that. All done in just kind of off-handedly way, Dylan and The Band off-handedly.

That is a rather circuitous way to explain the why of this review of The Last Waltz that I had seen when it originally came out in 1978 and have now re-viewed. What popped out at me in this second sighting was that these guys displayed in this two hour documentary that same kind of off-handed serious musicianship that I sensed in the boot-leg CD series mentioned above. No only did they rock, when rock was called for, but they could turn around musically (and instrumentally too) and do, well, a waltz. Hell, some of the instruments they were playing, and playing with professional abandon, I am not even sure I know the names of. And that explains Scorsese interest in doing this piece. He sensed a good story behind the rock and roll, a story of a band coming together when it counts-on stage. But also when, as band leader Robbie Robertson put it, it is time to move on after over a decade on the road. The road is a monster only the crazed, and Bob Dylan, can keep rolling along on. The Band got ""off the bus"" while they still had plenty of music left in them, just not together.

That said, all that is left is to pick out some highlights from some of the performers who showed up to bid adieu. Aside from a couple of numbers of their own The Band's strength here was as ""back-up"" for a number of performers, most notably Neil Young on Helpless, Van Morrison on Radio, Joni Mitchell on Coyote, Bob Dylan on I Shall Be Released (along with the entire ensemble), Muddy Waters On Mannish-Child, and going back to their roots, Ronnie Hawkins on Who Do You Love. Nice stuff, nice stuff indeed if you are interested in knowing what it was like when men (and women) played rock and roll for keeps.",1174953600,7,4472,4.4487804878048784
413795,5,6301971175,"""Just think of the rich visual eloquence with which Mr. Scorsese was able to invest a simple Checker cab in ""Taxi Driver,"" and just notice that all he supplies here are a waltzing couple behind the credits and some smoke clouds. Given that, you can't help realizing that for all its impressive musical accomplishments, ""The Last Waltz"" is a great lost opportunity. There is a dazzling array of talent on display here, and the film surely has its memorable moments. But it articulates so little of the end-of-an-era feeling it hints at--and some of Mr. Scorsese's accomplishments have been so stunning--that it's impossible to view ""The Last Waltz"" as anything but an also-ran."" Janet Maslin, The NYT

'The Band', Rick Danko, Levon Helm, Garth Hudson ,Richard Manuel, Robbie Robertson; all stars of 'The Last Waltz'. This was a concert by the rock band, sometimes known as rockabilly. A term they did not agree with.  The concert was held on Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 1976, at Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco. This was known as a ""farewell"" concert after 20 some odd years of touring. The Band was joined by more than a dozen special guests, including Eric Clapton, Neil Diamond, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Ronnie Hawkins Pine Top Perkins, Ringo Starr, Dr John, Muddy Waters, Emmylou Harris, and Neil Young. The concert was filmed by director Martin Scorsese and made into a documentary, released in 1978. The film features concert performances, scenes shot on a studio soundstage and interviews by Scorsese with members of The Band. The Last Waltz is hailed as one of the greatest concert films ever made. However, it has been criticized by Band drummer Levon Helm, who disagreed with guitarist Robbie Robertson's decision to discontinue touring. He has said the film concentrates too much on Robertson and not enough on other members of The Band. I have just finished reading Levon Helm's memoir, and I have such mixed emotions about this DVD. It has their marvelous music, the music of their guests, but it is missing the feeling of loss, the emotions of a group disbanding.

The concert was organized by promoter, Bill Graham, who had a long association with The Band. Starting at 5:00 p.m., the audience of 5,000 was served turkey dinners. There was ballroom dancing with music by the Berkeley Promenade Orchestra. Poets Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Michael McClure gave readings. These readings are shown without rhyme nor reason throughout the film. The Band started its concert at around 9:00 p.m.  and history began. Neil Young and Joni Mitchell were then invited back out to help The Band perform ""Acadian Driftwood"", a song to the Acadians of Canadian history. 'The Band' then performed a short set of some more of its songs before Bob Dylan came on stage to lead his former backing band through four songs, only two of which were in the film. The Band and all its guests, with the addition of Ringo Starr on drums and Ron Wood on guitar, then sang ""I Shall Be Released"" as their last song. The Band then came out at around 2:15 a.m. to perform an encore, ""Don't Do It"". It was the last time the group performed with its original members.

I loved this film, my best friend and I have listened to their music, discussed Levon Helm's memoir and viewed this video several times. I love 'The Band', but this was not the film all of the members wanted for their memories. It is glorious at times. The interviews are interesting, but not particularly illuminating. This DVD gives us more filming not shown in the original set. But the audience, the feast, the comings and goings back stage are not represented. A great film, yes, but not a  film that captures 'The Band;' as they wanted to be remembered.  Highly Recommended. prisrob 3-25-07

413796,3,6301971175,"I was fortunate enough to have attended ""The Next-to-Last Waltz"" - the concert in Pittsburgh's great Syria Mosque a few weeks earlier in 1976. Immediately afterward, The Band (well, Mr. Robertson) canceled the rest of the tour. Then the movie was made.

The Pittsburgh concert was the best show, performance or event of any type I've ever seen. That includes movies, concerts, opera, ballet, sporting events, cockfights, bar mitzvahs, class reunions - you name it. (OK, I lied about the opera and cockfights.) And I'm an old geezer of 54. I'd give it, oh, 10 stars. I'm told there's a bootleg of it, but I'm not sure.

This one I give 3 1/2. The music is good, of course, as is the guest lineup. But....

Scorsese should have clipped a lot of Robertson's mugging (while wearing that ridiculous dangling scarf). Ronnie Hawkins' crack at the private screening about the inordinate amount of attention on Robertson was right on -- and it took chutzpah, especially if Robbie was at the preview, too.

The short shrift given to Richard Manuel also is annoying. Longtime fans know that he was the soul of the group, and really its lead vocalist. At the Pittsburgh concert, he sounded great. And unlike the movie, he was front and center on numerous songs. (Robbie managed to leave the scarf at home, too.)

All in all, though, for 7 or 8 bucks - even 10 or 12 - The Last Waltz DVD is a heck of a deal.

But for the whole story of the night from a musical standpoint, get the complete concert on CD.",1174694400,16,1492,4.548507462686567

However, the main reason to buy this film is the music. Quite simply The Band were one of the greatest Rock N Roll bands ever. This is a film of their farewell concert (at least in the classic line-up with Robbie Robertson on guitar). The Bands music on its own would merit purchase of this disc. They run through a 'best of' set, that as a concert film would be hard to beat.

Add to this the guest list, and you have the best concert film ever. Van Morrison in his hey day belting out Caravan. Joni Mitchell singing Coyote. Dylan with Robbie Robertson burning incendiary guitar licks behind him. Muddy Waters, Neil Young, Dr John... The list goes on and on.

To flesh the film out a bit they filmed some of the numbers on a sound stage. One of these is a version of The Weight. This version features The Band with The Staples singers. If you haven't heard Mavis Staples, and you like gospel influenced music this takes what was already a great song to a new level.

The same year this was filmed (1976) Punk came on the scene and changed music for ever. But it doesn't matter whether you were brought up on Elvis Presley, The Sex Pistols, Nirvana or Coldplay, this music is as essential now as it was 30 years ago",1173312000,6,1500,4.3238434163701065

413884,5,6301971175,"This excellent DVD gives us a remarkable version of Martin Scorsese's film. It has been color corrected by Scorsese himself, and remastered for superior sound quality.
The concert on Thanksgiving Day in 1976 was the final concert of The Band, with its original lineup. Numerous special musical guests enhanced the occasion. The Band were clearly at the top of their game that night, despite whatever personal tensions may have existed between them. Classic songs like ""Up on Cripple Creek"", ""Stage Fright"",and ""They Night They Drove Old Dixie Down"" are given excellent rendtions. The guest stars seem to be having a good time, with backing by The Band themselves. Ronnie Hawkins does an outstanding ""Who Do You Love"". Dr. John does his classic ""Such A Night"". Joni Mitchell performs her underrated ""Coyote"". A high-kickin' Van Morrison rocks the house with ""Caravan"". And blues legend Muddy Waters does a spectacular ""Mannish Boy"". In a ""making of"" featurette, Scorsese says Waters' perforance of this song was almost not filmed, because most of the cameras ran out of film. Fortunately, one cameraman caught the whole song, so we can have this excellent performance.
 Neil Young, Eric Clapton,and Bob Dylan are just some of the other performers in this outstanding lineup. Scorsese also provides excellent behind the scenes interviews with the members of The Band.
 The DVD also incudes two commentaries. One features Scorsese and Robbie Robertson, the other features Levon Helm, Garth Hudson, and guests stars Hawkins and Mavis Staples. They all have good stories to tell, and serve to enhance the film quite well. A previously unseen jam, and an eight page booklet written by Robertson round out the DVD.

413959,5,6301971175,"I have had the opportunity to read several reviews concerning Scorsese's documentary aptly titled The Last Waltz.  There are many critics out there that denounce Scorsese for showing so much favoritism to non-leader Robbie Robertson on-screen both during the interviews as well as the concert.  I have read other critics who hate the way that Scorsese edited this film, bringing a Hollywood element to something that was purely anti-The Establishment.  Then there are others that see this film as a farce.  The Band may well still be together if it weren't for this film and the persistence of Robbie Robertson.  As I watched this film a second time, I could not imagine anything further from the truth.  The Last Waltz was a near flawless documentary that did exactly what it promised ... it coupled amazing music (perhaps one of our last glances of a now commercialized industry) with talented performers and the giants of the scene paying respects to one of their own, The Band.  Scorsese opens this film with bold wording that I believe summarizes this entire documentary as a whole.  Those words are: THIS FILM SHOULD BE PLAYED LOUD! An accurate way to tell if a music documentary is succeeding is by turning the television off, but leaving the sound on.  If you are still enjoying the music at the end, the documentary has succeeded.

The music if flawless in The Last Waltz.  In fact, it is due to this film that I purchased the full recording of that infamous night.  I wanted to hear Van Morrison's soulful voice again, I wanted to hear the strangely added Neil Diamond song (which now seems to be relevant in my mind), and I wanted to hear The Staples putting the song ""The Weight"" into a whole new galaxy.  Neil Young's performance with Joni Mitchell in the background still continues to haunt me days after I finished watching the film.  The ability to see the entire range of The Band in just a short 117 minutes is an astonishing feat.  Scorsese did it.  What makes The Last Waltz groundbreaking is the passion of Scorsese.  I was worried at first that there would be less music and more spoken word from the band (which I could handle, if it weren't so much of Robbie Robertson), but Scorsese kept true to The Band, giving us more moments of song than ""dance"".  For those technical junkies out there, sure, Scorsese blatantly favored Robertson more than the rest of the band, but this newbie didn't care.  I was there for the music.  For half of this film I closed my eyes and allowed, maybe for the first time, my ears to critic this film.  What I experienced was a moment in music history that my generation will never experience, unless Coke has their corporate logo right above our artist's heads.

There are two people that I would like to give a bit of recognition to as I watched The Last Waltz.  The first is the cinematographer Michael Chapman for his ability to bring a crisp, smooth, young feel to this film.  Other music documentaries that I have seen typically are grainy and choppy at best, feeling as if you are sitting in the classic ""obstructed view"" seating of the concert.  Not with The Last Waltz.  Here, we are right up next to The Band.  Impressively, and what I believe brought so much emotion to the songs that they were singing, was actually seeing their expressions on their faces as they sang or played their instrument.  I felt like I was right up there with Danko, Helm, Hudson, Robertson, and Manuel.  I also felt extremely excited each time a new guest would appear to join The Band with one of their songs.  This excitement could only have been built by good music, strong direction, and powerful, captivating cinematography.  Check on all three counts.  The second person that I would like to give recognition to is Levon Helm.  His vocals, passion, and dedication to each song inspired me.  He seemed, and felt, more like the leader of this band than the apparent Robertson was.  He seemed secluded, content, and when he hit those drums my heart would beat.  This man is a music God.  Did anyone else witness what he did on that Mandolin?  Priceless.

Overall, this was a superb film that should be shown to every wanna-be musician out there in the world.  I am tired of American Idol or millionaire teens telling me what I have to listen to and how I could never relate to it.  Sure, maybe I am getting old, but that should not mean that the music needs to die.  Scorsese preserved an infamous night in history.  It is no Woodstock, but it was a photo finish.  There was one moment in this film that really made me see the change of musicians in our modern society.  The Band was on the road for sixteen years, and was finally calling it quits.  I pose this test to you readers out there.  Can you name one group within the past 10 years that has continued to tour time after time?  Mr. Matthews comes to mind, but outside of that, I don't expect Jessica Simpson to keep her popularity going.  If anything I would like to say ""Thank You"" to both The Band and Scorsese for making this project.  If it weren't for them I would still be grumpily listening to the newest Shakira song wondering where music devolved.  Now, my CD player enjoys this album.  ""The Weight"" is still my favorite song on the album, but it is a near photo finish with the haunting Neil Young song.  What a talented bunch of musicians that traveled, played for their fans, and sang about life.  What more can you ask for?

Grade: ***** out of *****",1149120000,11,5468,4.564234326824255
413960,5,6301971175,"The ""New Yorker"" called ""The Last Waltz"" ""the most beautiful rock film ever made,"" and while I personally have other favorites, there is no doubt that from an artistic point of view that this is one of the most lavish and beautifully produced rock films ever, which stands to reason as most films of this nature can't employ the likes of Martin Scorsese.

This film is beautifully and thoughtfully planned from the opening scene in which the film actually begins with the encore, which in context serves to emphasize the finality of the night. ""The Band"" was certainly in excellent shape during the performance with Levon Helm and Rick Danko in particularly fine form. The device Scorsese uses (often imitated since) where he intersperses interviews with concert footage works generally well, but if I had to pick one thing to critique it would be on the over-reliance on footage with Robbie Robertson (who also produced the film, and who was obviously closest to Scorsese) which sometimes crosses the line into self-aggrandizement (analogies to Janis Joplin, etc.) and gets a bit tedious at times.

The guest sets are generally excellent, and I was especially pleased to see the Eric Clapton, Emmylou Harris, and Ronnie Hawkins performances. For me the highlight of the film were the Levon Helm performances (especially ""Up On Cripple Creek"") while the ebb of the film were the scenes where Robertson ""sang"" (Helm claims that, mercifully, his microphone was unplugged...Robertson may be a fine composer and guitarist, but he is not a gifted vocalist) and over-emoted with a plethora of humorous facial expressions.

The commentary tracks are fascinating, but occasionally difficult to take. It is readily apparent that Scorsese and Robertson are friends (not that there's anything wrong with that), but they sometimes seem pitted against the rest of the band (which makes sense given the post-breakup history of the group.) While I liked listening to the commentaries (and liked the other bonus features), I think they somewhat taint the feel of camaraderie the film otherwise engenders.

Despite any shortcomings it may have, though, ""The Last Waltz"" is an unqualified masterpiece and any classic rock fan will be sure to enjoy it.",1148515200,7,2233,5.126373626373627

The musicians in it are all great, and of course The Band is phenominal, especially Helm, Richard Manuel, Danko and Garth Hudson... but, what kills the movie for me is Robertsons self-important interviews and super cheesey comments... ""I couldn't even think of 20 years on the road...""  Look at Janis, and Hendrix and blah, blah, blah..'  The whole time I was watching this film I was wondering, why the hell would this amazing band, still in their prime if you ask me, call it quits?  The answer is Robbie Robertson basically assumed leadership and MADE the rest of the band, who really didn't want to call it quits, go through with this Last Waltz..  The whole film Robertson comes off like a pompus, arrogant, lunchbag..  which is too bad because the rest of The Band are such cool, amazing musicians with way more character, way more likeable qualities than Robbie..  I don't understand why they were not interviewed more.  Then, I read Levon Helms book, This Wheels On Fire and I found out.. None of the other guys wanted anything to do with The Last Waltz.  It was Robbies idea with Marty Scorsese who comes across in the film like a short, coked-up,nervous troll.  Anyway, the performances were good, which is the reason I gave it 4 stars.  Neil Young is always magic to me, Muddy was great, Dr. John is always hot.. Clapton rocked, etc.. Although, from what I read in Levons book, most of the highlights of the show were not even filmed. I also kept wondering why the hell Neil Diamond was in it, I know Robbie produced an album  of his but... what does he have to do with The BAnd?  Nothing at all..  Robbie made sure he was there though.  They even wanted to kick Muddy Waters out so it wouldnt be so long!  That would have been a dumb idea.  Levon actually said if I recall, that if Muddy went, they'll need to get another drummer too cause he would also leave.  And, ""tell Neil Diamond to get the hell out"" or something along those lines... I have tremensous respect for Levon Helm. He is a true American Treasure. I LOVE the Band and their music, but it was heartbreaking for me to find out just how bad Robertson screwed them.  He also basically took all the credit to pretty much all their songs.  Rick Danko, one of my favorite bass players and vocalists ever, died in his 50's from working himself to death because Robbie screwed them so bad.  So, that made me sad.  So, this is a good rock movie, and the Band is awesome.  I know Robbie did contribute a lot to the Band lyric wise and his guitar playing is good, but, his attitude was so different from the rest, its pathetic.  He ruins the movie for me.  If you could take out all his dumb little moments where he hams it up for the camera, it would be a 5 star movie.. Anyway, just wanted to let people know that The Last Waltz was Robbies way of having one big payoff.  Not what the rest of The BAnd wanted.  Oh, and, none of them (aside froom Robbie) ever made a cent off it. Nevertheless, its a good film.  It just sickens me that these great, timeless musicians got so ripped off.  Levon Helm, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson are truly musical marvels who always make me happy.  Buy their solo albums, they are good.  I especially love Dankos Live On Breeze Hill, and Times Like These. Also, Garths solo cds are very good too.  There sure isn't any music like the music the Band made around anymore.

I will add, though, that it's sad and somewhat haunting to see the ""I Shall Be Released"" finale when Richard Manuel comes in on the second verse, the way he's hidden off-camera until we get a shot of ... Ringo on the drums. Overall, overwrought, overrated, somewhat shameful at times the way Scorcese tries to make a star out of his coke buddy Robby Robertson.

There is the precious opportunity to see legendary bluesman Muddy Waters in all his glory, there's a thrilling performance of ""Mystery Train"" sung as a duet by Levon Helm and Paul Butterfield, with Butterfield giving a virtuoso performance on harmonica.  It's a special treat to see The Band playing their own songs in their heartfelt last performance together, and to hear their stories about their past as folk rock trailblazers (in another Martin Scorcese film, ""No Direction Home"", Bob Dylan calls them ""gallant knights"" for sticking with him through his turbulent transition to electric music).  This is really a magical film.  The things that stand out are Levon Helm's drumming and his singing, Rick Danko's singing and his sense of humor, Garth Hudson's versatility (particularly noticeable when he plays the saxaphone), Richard Manuel's intensity, and Robbie Robertson's vision of what it all meant, as well as his one-of-a-kind songwriting and lead guitar style.  Probably the best moment in the film is during the Bob Dylan set when Dylan is changing tunes but hasn't yet told The Band what's coming next, the look on the faces of Danko and Robertson as they go with the flow is instructive as to their musicianship and their sympatico relationship with their colleague Mr. Dylan.",1133740800,11,1646,5.0777777777777775
414000,5,6301971175,"If you can get past Robbie Robertson's insufferable mugging for the camera- and what are all those spots doing on him during some else's solo?- there are some absolutely wonderful, moving performances here. When the stage goes dark and Rick Danko steps into the spot to sing ""Stagefright""- well, it's a chilling, beautiful moment. And the guest stars show how incredible The Band were at backing up other performers. My favorite is Joni Mitchell's ""Coyote"", done in a more rhythmic, upbeat style than on ""Hejira"", but no less enchanting.

I was less than impressed by the interviews, which are dominated (for the most part) by Robertson; I'd rather have seen a straight concert film. Knowing what I know about the breakup, in context much of the film is rather disturbing, presaging Manuel's suicide , Danko's death following his illness, and the rancor between the various members and Robertson.

414005,5,6301971175,"Now you gotta know I'm a player.. a quite good keyboardist.. and I've played some of this material in bands, and I can read guitar chords and bass lines just from watching.

And I tell you honestly, Rick Danko was NOT playing the basslines I heard song after song.. he'd jump around, and wag his elbows around, and pretend to do some flashy stuff on the fretboard.. it's just not him that you hear.  It's screamingly obvious on a couple of the blues numbers, he's just thumping away on one note while the bass you HEAR is doing climbs and drops.. you know, professional.

So I don't know what was up with his playing, and I don't know if there was a ringer offstage or whether they overdubbed bass in a studio later (i.e. they recorded the audio to a 24-track).

But I swear, Rick Danko was NOT playing the bass you're hearing.

MY THEORY: Eric Clapton was around all evening, and played several times. His bass player from Derek and the Dominos, Carl Radle, mysteriously showed up during the one 'all star' jam that got filmed.. Carl's tone and playing style sounded suspiciously familiar.. as if I'd been hearing him all along.

Other than that, a fabulous look at some classic rock performers that'll never be on the same stage again.

414068,5,6301971175,"This may come off sounding like a tribute to Bob Dylan, but it's not (or it could be).  I didn't see Dylan perform until the 80's, but I was always aware of The Band.  Having had a subscription to Rolling Stone from '67 until the early 70's, I was at least informed.  I had even remembered how they came up with the name, The Band.  Rolling Stone provided all kinds of trivia.

I did not follow The Band (Hawks) or Dylan in the early 60's.  I was 10 when Dylan's 'Free Wheelin'"" came out.  (I think that was his first).  But I do have a distinct memory of a friend of my brother bringing this album over (Dylan) with such excitement and insisting he listen to it pronto.  I was right there waiting with such anticipation, the memory is branded in my brain.  From the first words I heard come out of the new ""stereo"", I did not get it.  At 10 I did not appreciate or like folk music.  I had been forced to watch ""Hootenanny"" (sp?) and my brothers collection of Peter Paul and Mary, did not impress me. I love music but the only thing I had access to was AM radio.  My parents had no collection of Billy Holiday or the such, but they did have old 78's of the singing Pioneers, I used to like those when they would bring them out.  At 10, I was not ready for Dylan, he was not Mick Jagger or even The Beatles.  It was only a few years later when FM radio was being used for ""us"" before I got it. It didn't take me long to discover Dylan was not a folk singer in the way Peter Paul and Mary was.

So, for me to see The Last Waltz (and never having heard any of the sound track) was such a delight.  I have listened to Dylan for years (I recently purchased The Essential Bob Dylan and it's great, even if you have every album/CD, it's a great compilation of his works) with much respect and Van Morrison has become my favorite for many reasons.  I do own The Best of the Band and knew all the songs, but the greatest tribute to The Last Waltz is that my husband got hooked and watched two thirds of it, saying, ""I didn't know they did that song"", too many times to mention before he went to bed.  Now that is only worth mentioning because we have very differnt orintations to music.  He graduated from University of Texas with a degree in fine arts and was used to doing and singing Broadway musicicals.  He really was captivated by the performances, which is the biggest reason I rate this so high, other than the fact it deserves it.

414123,2,6301971175,"This music collage is definitely misnamed.  After Martin Scorsese produced this 1976 San Francisco filming of the concert, he added interviews with the young members of the Band who accompanied the varied '70s ""stars.""  It was good to see the young men's hair styles back then, as I had two teenage sons thirty years ago.

The best I can say about this production is that it was weird.  Something similar takes place in this backward town at an old church building converted to Laurel Theater (on Laurel Ave.).  Nowadays, they call it bluegrass and traditional, but I have never liked country and it may be rock'n'roll, but not in the sense of Buddy Holley and that gang from the Fifties.

The only waltz was at the opening credits, thereby giving the film its name.  The music is as far from a waltz as classical is from hillbilly.  The young performers talked of getting drunk on corn liquor, laid by 'ladies of the night,' and stoned.  The whole music scene back then as lived out in front of the camera was smoking, drinking, pill popping and sex.  You'd think it was Woodstock all over again; I'm glad I missed it.

Neil Diamond has moved up the ladder since then and the only 'real' star in this whole show. He was absolutely marvelous in THE JAZZ SINGER and sang his own music throughout the beautiful JONATHAN LIVINGSTON SEAGULL.  Scorsese started with sordidness, two hours of noise.  Now I understand why his rather lengthy masterpiece, THE AVIATOR, dealt mostly with the sleazy part of Howard Hughes' life.

414131,5,6301971175,"""The Last Waltz"" (thankfully) became my new 'phase' movie, replacing ""Saving Private Ryan"", but thanks to the Band it will become something more than a phase and certainly something that will last a lot longer. I first saw the movie because of Scorsese, then got into it because of the Band, and now I am only into it for the Band. As great as the movie is, as strangely comforting as it is to hear music like this, and as thankful as I am that it does exist...I have several reservations about it that I feel people are overlooking. First of all, if you've heard the soundtrack album, then you know that these songs have been edited down SEVERELY for the movie, and not just the verses of the songs. They cut out several of Robbie's most moving and lengthy guitar solos ever, and even had the audacity to excise some passages from ""Mystery Train"". Of coarse, the greatest travesties are the Band songs ""It Makes No Difference"" and ""The Shape I'm In"", and I guess it would have killed people to sit through Richard's final verse of the latter. It is an exciting film to watch, so maybe people just overlook this because of that, but this is a music film and how many fans do you know that would have complained about the movie being a half an hour longer?! Other qualms of mine include the fact that the Band simply don't do enough of their own material. Now that I've heard all of their albums, and got familiar with all of the other great songs and material that they had, I am inclined to think that the records are a more rewarding listening experience (although Robbie's guitar never sounded rougher). Richard has the best voice ever, and it's obvious that we have a special rythmn section and guitarist, so why do they treat the show like it's for the guests instead of them? Maybe Richard couldn't have sang all night, but where are the great Band songs? If you don't understand what I'm saying, just imagine if ""Rock of Ages"" would have been filmed. The Band had great songs, and I know Robbie said that it was originally supposed to be just them, so what gives? And a question for Scorsese the genius--why do we get a minute and a half intro to what looks like a rocking version of ""Chest Fever"" and never see any more of it? Why weren't the other film performances included? So what if the whole performance wasn't filmed, or if it looked bad, they could have squeezed in ""Acadian Driftwood""! What a heartbreaker! I mean, if only I could have seen ""Time to Kill"". I'm not going to gripe about Robbie's face being all over the thing--I like Robbie, and frankly the rest of the guys looked like they had been hibernating for ages and were sad that the crew woke them up for interviews. Robbie is cool, even if he destroyed the Band's road career, and at least he talks without trying to remember where he is! But I will say that this is the best concert film ever--I mean the music rocks (artistically too boot), the camera angles are right, and the whole evening looked magical and I feel sad that I wasn't alive back then to get there and see it. It's an essential purchase without a doubt, but a bit of a letdown for the Band's sake. Too many guest artists (in the movie). However, the film contain's one moment that no other rock film can beat. Turn up the riveting and terrifying performance of ""Stage Fright"" right after Rick shouts 'just let him take it from the top!' and prepare to be rattled by one of the loudest and most incredible guitar solos ever filmed. Intense isn't a strong enough word. So at least we have this preservation of the Band's strength, power, and excellence on film, although the whole idea of never seeing the Band perform again is tear-jerking.",1107907200,,3686,4.470326409495549

414185,5,6301971175,"Really . . . This DVD is amazing.

Not just because of its excellent sound (5.1 remix is just fantastic).

Not just because of Martin Scorsese's production/direction. (The film quality is soooo good, sooo clear, in part because of Scorsese's and The Band's decision to film with 35mm - most rock concerts at the time were 16mm.  Also, they just didn't set up a music concert stage and have the camera-guys run around and get the best shots/angles they could.  Instead, their approach from the beginning to make the stage at Winterland a movie set, with camera angles pre-thought at least in part, resulting in a more cinematic look, and better composed angles.  This and the 35mm decision sets this film apart from almost all other music concert films of the time.)

Probably what adds the crowning jewel on top of the audio/video production is the players here.  It's like a time capsule of mostly excellent performances of many of the most significant musicians of the time (from Dylan, to Dr. John, to Eric Clapton, to Mudddy Waters - an absolutely riveting version of Mannish Boy - to Van Morrison, to Neil Diamond, to . . . well the list goes on.  And on.)  In this way, the Last Waltz is like a perfectly preserved historical snapshot of ""popular"" music in the mid-70's.

None of this would matter, though, if at least the sound quality were not stellar.  And it is here. . . I've had other experiences with other music performance DVDs of bands I really like (Queen comes to mind), but the sound, even though in DTS or Dolby 5.1, just isn't up to par.  It ruins the experience, to a certain extent, for me.  With the Last Waltz, and with Martin Scorsese producing this, I suspect that the Dolby 5.1 remixing guys were blessed with excellent analog source recordings, which just sets the quality of the music just over the edge.  I listen to this with the TV off sometimes, though it's too bad the interviews between songs can't be somehow avoided when playing the DVD as ""sound only"".

Lastly, speaking of the interviews, though I find them really fascinating and entertaining, they are also the source of the only problem I have with this DVD - the volume of the interviews.  The interviews are not in 5.1; only PCM 2-channel stereo.  That alone is not a problem and even makes sense - what do you gain from a 5.1 sound interview?  However, the interviews are at a noticeably lower volume than the music.  Annoying, but not enough so to even take a 1/2 star off my 5-star rating. . .

This movie is fantastic on so many levels, the digital transfer is flawless, the music is timeless and the insight provided by Director Martin Scorsese in his many interviews is priceless. I am hard pressed to find a single favorite moment in this film but a few personal highlights are, Dr. John leading the Band on ""Such A Night"", Neil Young stealing the show with his fragile, shaky but determined reading of ""Helpless""(big cocaine lump and all)and the interview segments featuring the late Richard Manuel, only 33 years old at the time but with his heavy beard and world weary demeanor seems very engaging but at least 20 years older.

Everything about this movie is pure magic, and a love letter to every true music fan! You get the feeling that this concert was a true once in the lifetime experience for the musicians as well as the audience. I can honestly say that I am driven to watch it over and over again because of the sheer brillance of the performances, the love that the members have for their music, and the energy that flows out of each and every song.

To watch the Band send out such masterpieces as ""the Night They Drove Old Dixie Down"", ""The Shape I'm In"", ""The Weight"", not to mention my absolute favorites ""Stagefright"" and ""It Makes No Difference (one of the best lost love heart breaking songs ever written), and then perform as the best back up band for talents such as Muddy Waters, Van Morrison, Eric Clapton, etc. - well, this set of performances makes you realize there is a God, and He loves music.",1095292800,6,1038,4.373056994818653

414191,5,6301971175,"It's a worn-out formula nowadays. Bob Dylan did it, Chuck Berry did it, and Luciano Pavarotti does it all the time. They also do it every time somebody dies, and in this case you don't even have to be a musician. Yeah, I'm talking about that dreary event, the celebration concert with guest musician buddies. But there are exceptions to the rule, and this is definitely the case here.
To celebrate that they were quitting the `god---n impossible' life on the road after 16 years, The Band gave a farewell concert in San Francisco, on Thanksgiving Day, 1976. To join them, they invited artists who represented the rich and varied array of styles that went into their musical melting pot: Rock'n' Roll, Blues, Folk, New Orleans R'n'B, Country, Gospel, Rockabilly ... who would sing their own numbers backed up by them. They, noblesse oblige, brought in their first mentor, Ronnie Hawkings, a man who sure knows how to entice a teenager into joining a rock'n'roll band, and Bob Dylan, of course, (who had just released Blood on the Tracks and Desire), Joni Mitchell (The Hissing of Summer Lawns and Hejira her most recent albums), Neil Young (Tonight's the Night and Zuma were his latest solo efforts), Muddy Waters (who would release Hard Again, his best late day work the following year), and many, many more I have no space here to mention. All top-notch and in their musical prime. Well, and Neil Diamond.
The result was a concert that can only be described as dazzling and magical. The Band do ecstatic versions of some of their best songs and the guest appereances are also amazing, Van Morrison does what's probably the best version ever of Caravan, Muddy Waters proves why he is the M-A-N, chile, The Staple Singers send a shiver up your spine that can rend you comatose for life, and Robbie Robertson and Eric Clapton bring the house down with their scorching six-strings and then they burn the ruins to ashes. All this just to quote a few. But I have a minor complaint here, the movie only features one song (The Shape I'm in) sung by Richard Manuel, one of the most soulful and moving singers that ever walked the face of the earth. This gives the newcomer a somewhat off-balanced account of how vocal duties were shared in The Band, as one can deduct that Levon Helm sang almost everything with a little help from his friends Rick and Richard. And Levon is darn good, but Richard is the shhh ....sheer top of the heap.
Casting these trifles aside, the movie is a masterpiece. Direcrted by a Martin Scorsese in a state of grace (those were the days of Taxi Driver and Raging Bull), and beautifully darkly photographed by Michael Chapman (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull), Michael W. Watkins (later X-Files direcror and producer), and Vilmos Zsigmond (Close Encounters of the Third Kind, The Deer Hunter, Heaven's Gate), this was to be more than your average rock concert documentary.
The filmmakers were set on an ambitious goal, to show what it is and what does it feel to play great music. And they achieved it in such a way that we mere mortals get to feel what it is to be up there on the stage, enraptured, playing that great music to an enthusiastic and receptive crowd. The featurette that is one of the DVD bonus add-ons shows how Scorsese had these sheets of paper with the  lyrics of each song to be played written down in one column, the main moments of each performance in another (when a singer would join in the chorus, or the guitar solo was to begin, or a special part of the lyric would be sung, etc), and the camera shots and movements for each moment in a third column. This is called making the best of the means of your art instead of just doing anything that would do, and it shows on the screen in a way that leaves you breathless. Watching Scorsese frantically directing the movie like a tightrope walker with no net to fall down on must've been worth another documentary. They had only one take for everything, mind that, and I guess that's what might have attracted such a brave and audacious director as Scorsese: Jumping into the unstopping swirling midst of life and trying to extract art out of it with just spotlights and cameras. Souns enticing, isnt't it? And for no money nor any promises of getting more you-know-what than Frank Sinatra.",1080864000,24,4273,4.637203166226913

414223,5,6301971175,"The Last Waltz is a final tribute to the great music of the late 60's and early 70's. It marks a farewell to rock's finest era. The lineup is argueably the finest collection of rock musicians ever assembled and the performances are trancedent. Wisely Scorsese's film concentrates on the stage performances. The interview segments that sporatically appear in the film aren't that interesting, but they do prove context for the song selection. Probably the weakest thing about the film are The Band's performances on Scorsese's sound stages. These numbers lack the intensity that the Band gives in their concert performances. The Band themselves are awesome in their own concert numbers, rivaling the cuts on Rock of Ages. Since they are so many guests, the film limits the amount of the Band's performances. The guests are stellar with the highlights being: Joni Mitchell's Coyote, Neil Young doing Helpless, Dylan with Baby Let Me Follow You Down, and a show stopping Caravan with Van Morrison. Only Neil Diamond strikes a sour note. Even the guest stars pale to the Band's own numbers especially with Robbie's firey guitar work that night. The Last Waltz a piece of history, an amazing concert, and a brilliant send off for an era of great music.
Image: 1:85:1 picture looks great, good detail and sharpness. Compare with the trailer and be amazed. The print is very clean and few dirt specks appear even in dark areas.
Sound: as it should be is excellent, I listened to the 2 Channel and it rocked. 5.1 also included, but sounds weaker on two speaker setups.
Extras: commentary with Robbie and Marty is Robbie dominated and is rather dull. A documentary is included that focuses on them and I would reccomend it instead. The second track is a wonderful commentary from a variety of sources. It is structured and edited into a form that resembles that of the interview segements in the film. Scoreses' crew, rock critics, and Dr. John, The Hawk, Garth, and Levon take turns telling behind the scenes stories. It has a wonderful introduction that prepares you for true tales and tall that you are about to hear. It's worth it alone for The Hawk's background story on the Band and anything Dr. John says is brilliant and a hoot. Well worth a listen. There is an interesting ten minute jam session at the concert with the amazing lineup of Young, Starr, Wood, John, Garth, and Levon. Also included is a photo gallery and trailer.",1079308800,5,2427,4.822541966426859

Levon was deeply wounded by Robbie's increasing authority over the Band culminating in his decision to close out the band in this extravagant fashion. The music was great, but Band fans should check out Levon's angle in the book. The movie is all Robbie.
As Ronnie Hawkins said after viewing the preview about Richard Manuel, the great pianist & vocalist in the Band, ""Was Richard still in the group when we did this?""

Scorcese does a wonderful job of digging into the lives of the Band, with some wonderfully candid comments backstage between the glorious songs of this concert.  The Band was in full flight, with memorable guest appearances in what was ostensibly their swan song.  Take your pick of favorites.  Mine were ""Who Do You Love"" with Ronnie Hawkins, ""The Weight"" with the Staple Singers, ""Mystery Train"" with Paul Butterfield, and ""Baby Let Me Follow You Down"" with Bob Dylan. Some of the guest performers looked a little out of place like Emmylou Harris, who didn't seem to find her voice on ""Evangeline.""  But, then there is Joni Mitchell singing a lovely rendition of ""Coyote.""  The concert builds to its closing crescendo on ""I Shall be Released"" with everybody joining in for this rousing rendition of the classic gospel song.

The off-stage interviews capture the slyness, charisma and chemistry of the individual members, particularly Robbie Robertson, and are edited between the concert songs in such a way as to provide marvelous, illuminating segues.  I don't know which is more brilliant, the concert or the direction and editing.  It just all melds into one fantastic experience.

Dr. John, Dylan, Neil Diamond, Eric Clapton, Neil Young, Van Morrison, The Staples and many others join The Band in their 1976 send off.

You see what the reverence for music and groups was for back in those days. That is not to say that artists are no less capable today or are much less worthy of attention but back then there was a sort of envy we all had for those folks who made and put their lives into the music and the music did effect the world around us. That is to say they not only put their lives on show but they seemed to put everything they had on the line for that music. And the music back then had something to say, albeit different to everyone who heard it.
Although in later days we've come to see this as a mutual admiration society between Robbie Robertson and Martin Scorsese the direction from Scorsese doesn't hurt at all and the musical inspiration provided by The Band and their guests is what it's all about here.
The Band is very tight on songs of their own but with guests stars, who are right up there in the firmament, they are especially tight sounding.
Yes it does stand the test of time (short as it might be) yes it doesn't always throw the best light on certain people up on the stage but it does seriously show what was going on at the time.",1057276800,,1351,4.140684410646388

Everybody in the film it quite obviously enjoying themselves tremendously and as Robbie Robertson stated, it was like they were in a zone - and they were.  Their play is fantastic. I never get tired of watching it as it clearly is a celebration of a great band going out on top  with their friends and great fellow musicians in attendance.

Magnificent camera work (thank you Mr Scorsese), witty humor, hilarious stories from the road of old, superb musicianship, crystal clear video, stellar sound, and one of the greatest all around concerts I have ever seen, live in person, or on film. I saw it in the movies in 1979 I think, and that was the one and only time until now. I had forgotten how good it was.....or maybe I just didn't realize it back then.
First the obvious. I had seen the Band on numerous occasions in the past, but I can't remember ever seeing them this good. It was as if, knowing this was thier last show, they had decided beforehand to come out that night and play like they never had before. Levon? what a voice and solid backbeat. Richard? sometimes you forget who sings certain Band hits until you see this film. Garth? a style unlike anyone I have ever heard. Rick? looking like he was having an absolute ball on stage, and also the voice behind many of thier memorable numbers.....& Robbie....what can I say? The guy is just stealing the show, with his personality, and stellar guitar playing. To all you (myself included) guitar players out there striving to get always better, just watch this guy!
Secondly, the sprecial friends. Dr. John, Niel Young, Joni Mitchell, Muddy Waters, Bobby D, Paul Butterfield, Emmylou Harris, the Staples, Niel Diamond, all turning in moving performances, not to mention a fantastic horn section.....and of course ...Clapton. I guess my only complaint about this DVD is that Eric gets only one number, yet on it, he and the boys just tear up the house on ""Further On Up The Road"". (I dare you to try to listen to the last 1 1/2 minutes of that without your foot stomping on the floor and without you realizing it!).
The running commentary between Scorsese and the boys (mostly Robbie and Levon, but all have much to contribute) is often humorous, sometimes moving, and sometimes downright sad in thier reflections of the past.
I'm rambling now....sorry.....just do yourself a favor, and go out and buy this DVD....you won't be sorry.",1049328000,3,2102,4.7146739130434785

414285,4,6301971175,"Yes, this is a sensational rock documentary. It was a seminal movie, and many of the filming and edits techniques that are (or were) a staple on MTV and VH-1 had their origins here. It's certainly on the short list of best rock and roll movies ever made.
Yes, the list of artists is stunning, and many of their performances were even more memorable at the time than they seem now: Van Morrison and Bob Dylan coming out of retirement (or at least seclusion), Emmy Lou Harris moving away from the Nashville machine. You can even forgive Neil Diamond.
And yes, The Band was far more important and influential than their two original studio albums might suggest. As Eric Clapton said later, ""I heard an album called 'Music from the Big Pink' and it changed my life.""
But the movie and this DVD are bittersweet. Not just because it was the last time that Robbie Robertson was on stage with the other members, not just because of the tragedies that came afterwards. Read Levon Helm's ""This Wheel's on Fire"" for another view of this movie, the director and Robbie Robertson. Maybe The Band was already breaking up when ""The Last Waltz"" was made, but there can't be any question that the making of the movie hastened the process.
It's all gone now past any redemption. They were much better together than they have ever been apart. And that knowledge colors every frame.",1047254400,4,1362,4.632231404958677

As far as the film itself, I believe this is what put Martin Scorsese on the map of the great directors.  I also believe this is the best Documentary/Rockumentary, whatever or however you want to refer it as in a genre'.  Even if you're not a fan of The Band, I don't think there is a better film to help an audience understand what it's like to tour, be on the road, or the going ons of a concert.  This film just does it all.  So sit down for a few.  I recommend this film to be shown to kids in a music or film class in high schools maybe even some colleges.  It's a great presentation with some great cameo appearances by the best names in the music business, back then (1978) and are legneds to this day; Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Van Morrison, Muddy Waters, Joni Mitchell, and some memorable tunes as well.

414288,5,6301971175,"Listening to Martin Scorsese's interview on this DVD, it's no surprise how beautiful The Last Waltz  turned out to be.  Scorsese had always loved music and used it well in his films, and The Last Waltz should be required viewing for every music video director today.
Scorsese can cut maniacally with the best of them (witness Mean Streets and Bringing Out the Dead), but on The Last Waltz, he wisely recedes into the background and lets his subjects speak for themselves.  And the subject is music -- lots of it, some of the best ever recorded, and the film also catches the musicians responsible at the height of their powers.
I wasn't even that big of a fan of The Band, but this film changed me -- and I can't say any other visual work has ever achieved that in me to this degree.  The Last Waltz shows The Band was that rare coming together of equals.  What other rock group can boast of having four vocalists of such unique persuasions?  And instrumentally The Band was really the cream of the crop -- Levon Helm and Rick Danko's irresistible grooves; Garth Hudson and Richard Manuel's dual keyboards (not to mention their more unusual instrumental contributions); and Robbie Robertson shows his fieriest playing in this film -- his gutsy playing overshadowed even Eric Clapton (who was beginning to show his more 'professorial' side at this point).
And matched against the guest stars, the group achieved pure magic.  My favourite number has to be the matching of Helm's gritty, masculine voice and Richard Manuel's bonkers drumming against Emmylou Harris' angelic croon in ""Evangeline"", but it could easily have been Van Morrison's devastating ""Caravan"", which seemed to stun even The Band itself, Neil Young with an aching rendition of ""Helpless"", or the mass gathering on ""I Shall Be Released"".  On The Band's own numbers ""The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down"", ""It Makes No Difference"" and ""Ophelia"" were all tremendously moving, while the two studio numbers (""The Weight"" and the almost mythical, gorgeous ""Waltz"" ending) were simply magnificent.
Scorsese's handling of the documentary sections shows the ultimate in bottom-line storytelling.  Most filmmakers would have raised eyebrows at the concept of jump-cutting interview audio without regard to image, but Scorsese triumphs by making these sections tight and meaningful so that the awkwardness of the jump-cuts becomes a non-issue.  And the celebrated shooting -- meticulously planned and storyboarded, featuring some of the best camera, lighting and design talent in the industry -- shows how concert films should be done.  As Scorsese says, no need for stock audience cutaways, fast montages or thrashing bodies; just powerful music, impassioned performances and a camera that knows where to be at any given point.
This film is, to me, in a class all by itself -- other concert films such as Woodstock and The Monterey Pop Festival have tended to leave me indifferent (even if I do like some of their artists).  The Last Waltz is the hands-down winner on all fronts -- visual, musical, and narrative.",1045872000,4,3069,5.019685039370079

The Band is brimming with energy and they play their farewell concert, and the music sounds fantastic in the 5.1 mix.  You don't even have to be a huge fan of The Band to enjoy this movie, as long as you like classic rock.  There are so many guest stars that join The Band, including Eric Clapton, Van Morrison, The Staples Singers, Neil Young, Bob Dylan, and many others.
There are two outstanding commentary tracks on this dvd.  One of them features director Martin Scorsese and Robbie Robertson (of The Band).  Over the course of the film, they provide a great deal of insight into the making of the documentary.  Equally valuable is the second audio commentary, which features many participants (the other surviving Band members, a few of the guest performers such as Dr. John and Mavis Staples, and several crew members, among others).  Although the many participants were recorded separately, the track tightly edited with nary a dull moment.  A nice touch: you can select a subtitle feature which will bring up the name of the person who is speaking while the commentary plays.
If all that weren't enough, the 20 minute featurette contains good recent interview footage with Scorsese and Robertson.  And there is a 12 minute outtake which is an all-star jam session (the instrumental jam itself isn't all that exciting, but with that kind of line-up it's well worth watching).  Even the Still Photo gallery had more care put into it than most dvds, with the photos divided into three sections, many featuring captions to identify what we're looking at.

After watching ""The Last Waltz"" I know exactly what he meant. When put against the backdrop of that period, and before, todays music and musicians are plastic entertainment at best. The Last Waltz moved me from my recliner and made me dance. I haven't done that in years. Today it is all about 'packaging'. Today's country music is nothing more than 'rock-a-billy, two-step, gee he sounds just like Garth Brooks'stuff. And Rock and Roll lives only on oldies stations. Maybe I'm just an 'old fart' but for me the music of today is dead. A perfect example of what I'm talking about was on display at Super Bowl XXXVII. I could feel the music when Santana played pre-game. I don't even know who that Madonna look-a-like was ""singing"" with, I guess that was Sting, at half-time, but what was that ""SOS"". Maybe 'Same Old Sh_t'. And Bon Jovi at post-game? Give me a break. Santana should have been the feature, not the warm up. And the other's could have stayed home.

The rest of the film is a little too reverential for a band that had only two classic albums. For guys in their thirties, the band move and talk like weary seventy year olds. If they were so tired of ""the road"", why did they continue performing after this film was made. Get a real job like everyone else!
The symphony additions and the cheesy trappings of the ""Last Waltz"" set up is a little too stuffy for a great bar band.",1042848000,21,871,4.589743589743589
414334,5,6301971175,"Here is a concert that took place over 20 years ago and the music is fresh and enjoyable as if was when it was new. Even more important here is a group of musicians who were on the road for years, working clubs and bars that had a chance to become a success due to their musical ability not what company they were with. Not one person in this concert could become a success today. Imagine any member of The Band, Bob Dylan, Neil Young and any of the other players, on this special night, trying to make it in the business today. These people were not placed together to saturate a demographic. They were not assembled for a particular look to please the 12 to 15 year old female audiences. They were not a promotion by a record company or radio conglomerate to build up a profit base in a particular section of the country who haven't been buying enough records of a particular type in the last three months. These are a bunch of guys who got together to play music, get laid and party and are thrilled that you could come along for the ride. This is a look back on what was going on before music was a global business that completely controlled what was to be deemed talent.
I didn't mean to use the context of a movie review to spout off about what is going on today in the music business but the whole time I was watching I was plagued with the idea that the future generations would not have a Bob Dylan or Robbie Robertson to take inspiration from. Can the Backstreet Boys inspire you with their musical ability or Britney Spears, who can't even perform live, make you want to learn an instrument? I'm sure that there are many new talents, Alicia Keys and Creed come to mind, (both of whom were rejected by every major label) out there but will they get the exposure to effect the future as these people did; only time will tell.
This DVD release came out when there is a `revival' of the older 70's and 80's bands so it is actually timely. The reason of course for this revival of `oldies' is because there is so little in the way of creative music going on now and the copyrights have run out on the songs so for the most part the cooperations rake in all or most of the revenues from these greatest hits copulations.
The movie itself was a great mixture of interviews and the concert itself. The interviews were some single and some group but all very short glimpses into the character of each of these persons as part of the band. There were two songs that were done in the studio that really emphasized the roots that this music came from, Gospel (Staples) and Country (Harris) but both of these went with the flow. This is a concert of `imperfect' music with a sound from ordinary folks playing songs that most anybody with some guitar training could master quickly. This was an affirmation that this band, as a total, was certainly greater that each of its parts. A great way to spend an evening with a six-pack, a pizza and your system turned up loud.",1042761600,3,2964,4.351985559566787
414335,5,6301971175,Just watching and listening to the various folks playing here lets one understand what real music is all about.  The footage is great and the sound is awesome (although the bass on the DVD and the remastered box set is a lttle thinner than previously).  Listening/watching Joni sing Coyote is worth the price alone...what a voice and what a song. How come no one writes stuff like this anymore,1039651200,5,393,4.681159420289855
414336,5,6301971175,"The first thing that you will notice about this film is how well it looks and sounds. I'm only 19 and anything from 1976 (when this was filmed) I'd expected to just look okay and sound decent. But the audio is possibly the best around on a music DVD that i've heard (roger waters: in the flesh also is of pristine quality)and the film, which was shot using 35mm by Martin Scorsese looks awesome.
I've heard some of the songs off the last waltz album and i thought it was good, but when i put in the DVD and put on the 5.1 surround sound i was literally blown away. I never heard anything like it in my life. The guests appearances are amazing, every single one. All in all it's a fabulous DVD and if you're a fan of The Band it's an absolute must have, and I recommend it for all fans of rock and roll.
p.s. YOU HAVE to hear ""the night they drove old dixie down"" at full blast and in surround sound. Quite possibly the best thing i've ever heard.",1038960000,16,946,4.118918918918919
414337,5,6301971175,"This is a documentary of how a group of musicians celebrated their contributions to preserving American musical traditions, and a story that showcases the gifts of an important American filmmaker.  The Band were and are unique in the history of popular music, for many reasons I can't explain adequately here (or anywhere).  As a team, they were the vehicle for traditions and values that were larger than each member, but still part of their everyday lives and work.  There is a maturity, wisdom, and authenticity in their sound I haven't found elsewhere.  This movie captures all that beautifully in images that glow with the energy of Martin Scorsese's vision.  The DVD would be indispensable even without the extras, but they embroider an already luxurious experience.  My favorites are the audio commentaries from Robbie Robertson, Martin Scorsese, Levon Helm, Garth Hudson, and others.  The least effective extra is the archival ""jam footage,"" a classic case of ""you had to be there.""  The graceful but forceful editing that makes the Band's performances in the rest of the film so involving is missing here.  It is difficult to narrow down the best performances, but the ones I return to most are: ""Cripple Creek,"" ""It Makes No Difference,"" ""Stage Fright,"" ""Dixie,"" and ""Ophelia"" by The Band, and ""Caravan"" and ""Mannish Boy"" by guests Van Morrison and Muddy Waters.",1036281600,,1372,5.089285714285714
414338,3,6301971175,"I think the Band was wonderful group, one of the all-time best.  I disagree with comments that this performance was tired and uninspired.  But I was very disappointed in one aspect of this film: the gross imbalance in ""screen time"" given to the members. There is WAY too much of Robertson, including lots of him ""singing"" whereas he is not even one of their three main vocalists.  There are ridiculously few shots of Manuel (especially) and Hudson.  Also not enough shots of the Band as a whole group. The ""all star"" aspect is overplayed.  I didn't care to see Dr John and Ronnie Hawkins and long repetitive Joni Mitchell and Muddy Waters cuts, etc., at the expense of the Band itself.  Even Bob Dylan is no great shakes in this concert.  Instead of 50/50 Band/others, it should have been 75/25.

While the video clarity is tremendous, and some closeups (like Helm's drumming) is enlightening, there are far too many ""head shots"" of a single person (especially Robertson).  And even the ones that are there don't always make sense (he may be playing a guitar solo, and they often just show his face).  While those closeups are good, in measured amounts, to show some of the emotion and sweat, their excess doesn't do justice to one of the greatest ""ensemble"" bands.  I thought their originality lay in their ""group-ness"" with their varied vocals, styles, and textures, but the filming makes them too much like just another rock concert.  I don't know if it was Scorcese himself or Robertson who's to blame for the imbalanced coverage.

Danko and Helm do some excellent passionate singing, and it's great to watch Helm's creative drumming even as he sings.  Manuel probably did some singing worth seeing -- too bad it's just not there (except for one song, and even in that the camera is elsewhere for much of it).  Manuel was probably the group's best overall singer, and to not show ""Tears of Rage"" or at least one more song showcasing him was just a shame.

I still enjoy watching many tracks, but after the first time, I find myself skipping a lot of them.",1032134400,24,2059,4.677777777777778

414392,3,6301971175,"First off, was it not hysterical to see Robbie & Clapton ""jam"" together? Although this Liberace look-a-like is so in to himself and the great history of the Band, I myself don't see it. The band is mediocre if best, and this good-bye concert is the same. Although there are great performances by Neil Young (""Helpless""), Dr. John (""Such a Night""), and Muddy Waters (""Mannish Boy""), the rest of the performances were either uninspired or simply out of out place (see Joni Mitchell & Neil Diamond).
The only worthy material is Bob Dylan's appearance out of seclusion to pay homage to his former bandmates, reliving the great days as his backing band the Hawks (as evident of his first song of the night, ""Baby Let Me Follow You Down"") to the '74 co-headlining tour, to their studio sessions (as evident in Dylan's next tune, ""Forever Young"" which had The Band backing him in '74's Planet Waves.) Since Dylan had already clearly stolen the show, they ended the night with an all-star bash of Dylan's classic, ""I Shall be Released"", accompanied by Ringo Starr, Ron Wood, & all other performers from the night.
That day in '76 we said good bye to The Band, as well as Dylan as he was ready to venture into the world of Christianity and subsequent comercial failure until 83's Infidels. This DVD reissue reminds us of the overall yet subtle effect that this southern rock band from Canada had. They had some good tunes, some good times, and some good friends. And for that I agree with Robbie, and say let's celebrate.",1026518400,3,1512,4.666666666666667
414393,5,6301971175,"S.F., Thanksgiving Day 1976, The Band's last concert/waltz is the finest rock movie ever. Scorsese did a great work deidicating his cameras to the musicians - instead of the public as it was usual in the great rock concert of the Sixties and Seventies - and so doing captures with The Band a little encyclopedia of the american popular music featuring such distant musicians as Neil Young and Dr. John, Joni Mitchell and Ronnie Hawkins. This blend works because The Band was an incredibly eclectic group of musicians.

The Band and their special guests (Dr. John, Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Eric Clapton, and on and on) are in top form.

As you can tell by now, I am a big fan. Although I left rock n roll behind many years ago (classical fain now),  I still play Band cd's regularly.
When I first saw film (years ago)I enjoyed the experience. But I felt something was missing.  That something was the ""feeling"" of being at a concert.  Scorsese and Robertson would surely say they were making a moview, not a filmed concert.  OK.  But at least end with bang, not the whimper.  The ending was sentimental. Also, a couple more songs by the Band in ratio to guests was needed.  Still very enjoyable.",1025481600,,900,4.53416149068323
414397,5,6301971175,"A LONG time ago, when I first saw The Last Waltz (or, more accurately, some of The Last Waltz), I remember thinking it was OK, but nothing much to write home about.
  Well, recently, after becoming more familiar with this group and their music over the years, I felt the urge to see this film again. I did, and was absolutely bowled over.
  It is fantastic. I can fully see why The Band are revered as highly as they are in the music world. However, it seems to me that some current musicians (are you listening, Hootie?) might do well to study this film, since they seem to have spent their entire careers aping The Band, with usually poor results.
  Highlights of The Last Waltz are too numerous to mention, but they include ...
  An absolutely barn-burning rendition of the Motown classic ""Don't Do It"", with Levon Helm and Rick Danko sharing vital, earthy harmonies.
  An uplifting, intensely moving version of ""The Weight"", with added gravity from Mavis and Pops Staples.
  Van Morrison belting his heart out during ""Caravan"" (singing with so much emotion, in fact, that I thought he was going to pass out on stage).
  Muddy Waters swaggering through ""Mannish Boy"" (and, by the way, does anyone recognise that rhythm guitarist who also joins them on stage for this number? Y'know, the one that sort of looks like a cross between Bob Dylan and Jeff Lynne? He looks familiar, but I can't put my finger on it).
  Paul Butterfield's hollering and harping on ""Mystery Train"".
  The swirling, pulsing ""Genetic Method"", helmed by Garth Hudson.
  The richly rustic ""Evangeline"", with Emmylou Harris providing an excellent vocal counterpoint.
  And, of course, ""Who Do You Love?"", a taste of how it all began, with Ronnie Hawkins fully Diddly-ing his heart out.
  Of course, all the Band classics are fantastic too, especially ""Up On Cripple Creek"" (Wowee!) and ""The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down"" (Yow!).
  I also enjoyed the interview and discussion segments too, particularly Richard Manuel's vibrant explanation of the origins of the group's name, and the impromptu performance of ""Old-Time Religion"".
  However, the film does have its less-than-swell points too.
  ""Helpless"" is certainly not bad, but I'm not sure Neil Young knew where he was.
  Similarly, I understand why Neil Diamond's ""Dry Your Eyes"" was included, but it does stick out a bit from the rest of the film.
  Eric Clapton's ""Further On Up The Road"" is so low-key it isn't funny.
  And the final all-inclusive performance of ""I Shall Be Released"" reminded me too much of ""We Are The World"". In fact, it took me two viewings before I even realised who was singing the second verse!
  But I must admit to being particularly underwhelmed by the segment with Bob Dylan. Now, I respect his abilities as much as the next person, and I totally see why he should be included in this film. But ""Forever Young"" goes on too long. And my opinions of ""Baby Let Me Follow You Down"" inadvertently led to an all-time embarrassing moment for me recently ...
  As previously noted, I was less than enthused by this song. And, I guess I wasn't paying too close attention to the lyrics because ... well ...
  Recently, I was talking to a few friends, and when they found out that I had seen The Last Waltz, they asked me what I thought of it.
  ""Oh, I really liked it! It's great!"", I gushed. ""Except for that disgusting bit near the end"".
  This caused some surprised and quizzical looks. ""What bit?""
  ""Oh, that song Bob Dylan did"".
  By this point, my friends were very puzzled. ""What song are you talking about?""
  ""Oh, you know ... 'Baby, Let Me Go Down On You'. That was just crass. I'm surprised they got away with putting that in the film"".
  Needless to say, the entire room promptly fell about laughing for what seemed like hours about that one. I guess I should have paid more attention.

The Last Waltz is by and about THE BAND (amazon.com can't even get it right in their listing of the DVD).  Robbie Robertson was just one member of The Band.  Indeed, one only has to watch the film to realize that on the ""heart and soul"" scale (and that's what this band was about) Robertson (as cool and articulate as he is) brings up the rear.  It's obvious that Robbie Robertson and Martin Scorsese were tight on a movie producer level and it's a drag that they were led by their egos into the editing room.

Then I went in the Jehovah's Witness sect in my late teens and bottled up all the important things in a bad marriage and bad religion (Don't get me started!). I was trapped without a way out.
One Friday night in the fall of 1978, I saw a movie marque that said ""The Last Waltz: The Band"". So I paid my money and let the 60's come over me again in a wave of nostalgia. The relief was palpable - I cried with emotion. I exulted with joy. Yes this is my life - not some foolish religious hoax. I was riding high and went back on Sunday afternoon to see it again. This time it was like a party with a full theatre of fellow 60's types yelling ""Turn it Up!"". The rest is history: left the JW's, got divorced and remarried, started made my life again and never looked back. Oh, I've owned this movie in VHS, Laserdisc and now DVD ever since.
I love the performances and learned to play along with each one, except Neil Diamond - are they kidding!!! (Turns out Robbie Robertson produced something for Mr. Shmaltz so we have to suffer through it.) The Band is in great form and so are all the visiting players. There are dozens of cool moments like Joni Mitchell signing high backup on Neil Young's ""Restless""; all of the Bob Dylan pieces and the segue after ""Baby Let Me Follow You Down"" (where did he get that great cream hat?); the Staples Singers on ""The Weight"" (I feel conflicted over foxy gospel singers.); Muddy Waters who has one of the best groove's on the disk; Eric Clapton who re-tells Dylan's ""Love Minus Zero""; and the ever lovely Emmylou Harris singing of my native Acadian ancestors.
After reading Levon Helm's ""Wheels on Fire"" I understand why Robbie Robertson gets all the spot lights - even when other Band members are singing the lead. Guess he and Marty Scorsese had this thing where Robbie thought he was the Band. Sad we don't get to see Richard Manual while he sings ""I Shall Be Released"", his signature song. Oh well, ego is nothing new to the music biz. That's a little anoyance but doesn't detract from one of the greatest video's of all time.
We had friends over for supper two weeks ago and found out they had been watching a vhs copy of this over and over for years. We spent the rest of the night in the TV room for another playing of ""The Last Waltz"". Too bad they didn't want to hear me play along on the Les Paul.

REVIEW:

  Wow....Is all I REALLY have to say...At the time that my dad had me watch this, I had not heard a single song by ""The Band"" before, not even ""The Weight"".  As a young 17yrs girl, I was highly impressed...I would have loved  to have been at that concert if I was alive back then, but I was not born for another 9yrs after that concert was performed and filmed (In 1976).  I've always treasured music before my time, and The Band's music is definitely very good.

  This film is very well made, and While Robbie Robertson certain can come across as a bit of an egomaniac, the camera work was well-done and the picture quality is phenomenal.  For someone at the age of 17, it was a fantastic introduction to not only ""The Band"", but to the biggest and best acts of the time period, people such as: Muddy Waters(Whom influenced a GREAT MANY 60's groups like: The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, ect.), Van Morrison, Joni Mitchel, Neil Young, Neil Diamond,Eric Clapton, as well as other legends and greats of the era! This was actually where I first discovered Van Morrison as well and began to delve in to his discography shortly after watching this film.

I cried and laughed and sang along to some of the songs I did know, and got to get a snapshot of a time that was long since past, and truly made me appreciate the music that once was, and inspired me to make music that also is just as impactful.

This filmed record of the Band's last concert on Thanksgiving Day 1976, directed by Martin Scorsese (and released in 1978).Joined by such friends as Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr, and Van Morrison was phenomenum. Great performances of some great songs! The
camera work is quite good",1024185600,,362,4.950819672131147
414430,5,6301971175,"Rumor has it that at the debut screening of The Last Waltz in 1977, Ronnie Hawkins stood up at the end of the film and remarked sarcastically, ""That was all right, but it sure could've used a few more shots of Robbie!""  By now, any serious fan of the Band will be familiar with the antipathy between Robbie Robertson and some of his former comrades.  A quarter-century later, this classic movie's disproportionate concentration on Robertson at the others' expense not only remains palpable, it's even more lopsided in the updated version.  But for better or worse, that is a key part of the story of the Band; and in retrospect, the Last Waltz is surely an even more accurate documentary than Robertson had aimed for.  More importantly, it captures one of the greatest concerts of the rock era.
As Levon Helm relates in his rather bitter memoir ""This Wheel's on Fire,"" the decision to disBand was Robertson's alone and the Last Waltz was a somewhat reluctant exercise on the part of the other four.  This shows to varying degrees in the interviews which are dispersed throughout the concert footage:  Robertson, who appears far more often than the others, looks animated and a bit rehearsed (although it's hard not to feel some animosity towards him if you've read Helm's book) while the others look tired or worse.  (Helm's description of Richard Manuel as ""looking like Che Guevara after the Bolivians got done with him"" is all too close to the mark!)  While unflattering to a degree, the interview scenes do speak volumes about what the music industry did to one of rock's all time greatest bands and the truth about the then-impending breakup.  The Band did, after all, reunite sans Robertson as soon as they were legally able to use the name again without his blessing.  The commentary itself is still interesting as well, particularly some of the saltier stories of life on the road in the early 1960s, a time too often thought of as rock's ""innocent"" years.
But the music itself is still the most important part of the show by far.  However uncomfortable things had become behind the scenes, these guys could still play like no other band before or since, and it's almost magical to watch them do so for the very last time.  Given Helm's well-documented distaste for the whole project, it's remarkable how happy he looks during most of the performances, almost as if the bad blood disappeared during those last few hours while they were doing what they did best together.  The late Rick Danko's showstopping solo performance of ""Stage Fright"" just might be the concert's most intense moment, which is perhaps just as it should be given the subject matter of that song and the reality behind the scenes.
If there is any complaint to be made about the concert footage itself, it is that the guest performances by Hawkins, Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Eric Clapton, Joni Mitchell, Muddy Waters and Van Morrison featured here don't necessarily do justice to the full brilliance of that night.  The complete soundtrack (which was only recently released legitimately, after years of bootlegging) reveals stunning performances that didn't make it into the movie, although Martin Scorcese claims in the retrospective documentary that this is only because he simply wasn't able to shoot satisfactory footage of some of them.  Nonetheless, the performances that did make the cut are superb across the board.  Even the wildly out of place Neil Diamond does a decent job with his one song of the evening, even if I was left grateful that it was only one song.  Best of all, we're treated to dozens of unintentionally hilarious shots of Robertson singing with such emotion that the veins stand out on his neck - into a microphone which, as Helm gleefully recounted in his book, wasn't plugged in.  (This was no accident; guitar genius though he was and is, Robertson's vocal abilities always paled in comparison to those of Helm, Danko and Manuel, who also delievers a number of touching performances here.)
The new footage consists mostly of Scorcese and Robertson reminiscing about the making of the film; it's predictably self-congratulatory, but fairly informative.  More interesting to me, though, are recollections spread throughout the show from a wide variety of people who were involved with the project in various ways, playable as voice-overs with any given part of the concert.  After 25 years, these provide a perspective on the event and its meaning through the eyes of someone - or really, many someones - other than Robbie Robertson.  Perhaps this was the original intent behind the movie.  In any case, it should have been.  The new perspectives and footage are an undeniably nice touch, but the music still stands alone, and it sounds better than ever.  It all makes for a new and improved look at one of rock's all time great events.",1023667200,675,4840,4.874390243902439

I give the producers credit for having done a good job with what they had to work with.  I found the performances enjoyable insofar as they were passionate and did a good job of capturing the era.  I found the simplistic format of performance, simple interview, performance, simple interview.... to be boring.  Some of the spoken audio was poorly captured and hard to understand. It succeeded as a documentary (documenting an event) like a single camera stuck on a tripod at the back of a church could be said to document a wedding.  The performances are truly left to stand on their own as the filmmaking itself was lifeless.  As another reviewer commented, this soundtrack would prove a decent music CD.  It was fun seeing old footage of Robbie Robertson, Bob Dylan and the others.  But to rate this 5 stars is a big stretch.",1023580800,5,924,4.695652173913044
414432,4,6301971175,"The Last Waltz, a documentary about the farewell concert for The Band, is a movie that features some great music, but unfortunately, little else.
Since the music is the core of the movie, it is sufficient to make this a four-star film.  Besides The Band, there is a vast array of big name artists, including Bob Dylan, Neil Diamond, Van Morrison and Neil Young.  With such a line-up, you really can't go wrong.
On the other hand, the Last Waltz is significantly flawed by the other material.  The interview segments, in particular, are rather tedious.  In addition, there isn't that much that is visually impressive about the concert footage, and I sometimes felt that listening to a CD would have been equally fulfilling.

Great live sequences with of course great special guests.  Of course there is one VERY special guest in my estimation...that being Bob Dylan.  For Dylan fans this is a glimpse of The Man at some of his best.  Leading The Band (as he did on a revolutionary tour of the world in 1966).  The Band is great on their own but the 3 tunes done with Dylan show how they came to be as great as they are!  Check this out and I doubt that you will walk away down trodden.

414434,5,6301971175,"There are few bad things I can say about this documentary. By chapter 5, Neil Young's rendition of Helpless, chills were running through my body and didn't stop till the end credits. Bob Dylan at his best, Van Morrison at his chubby best, Eric Clapton on fire as usual. I derived great pleasure watching Levon Helm and Rick Danko envelope themselves in the music, though Helm seemed removed and slightly bitter or reluctant to talk during the interview portions. Now, on to the criticism. The non-live scenes, such as Evangeline with Emmylou Harris, are obviously staged and the performances themselves seem contrived despite the wonderful music. The only other bit of criticism I have to offer has already been mentioned. Levon Helm seems removed from the interview process as if he doesn't want to be on camera. Robbie Robertson, however, devours the spotlight in the interview sequences. Every bit a rock star, Robertson relishes his role as frontman, and his speeches and stories oftentimes seem rehearsed. Overall, though, this documentary is wonderful and I'd recommend it to anyone, a Band fan or not. At the very least it's a testament to the communal nature of counterculture music of that era, and the end of that era.",1021939200,18,1228,4.966019417475728

414475,5,6301971175,"To paraphrase a song by The Band. ""A hippie's dream..if I ever did see one"".  Filmed in 1976, The Last Waltz captures the end of an era beautifully.  The lighting has a dream-like quality to it.  I guess if our generation died and went to heaven, this would be the closest thing.  It centers around The Band and their magnificent musicians (Robertson, Danko, Helm, Manuel and Hudson) plus great performances by Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan, Van Morrison, Joni Mitchell, the great Muddy Waters, Neil Young, Dr. John, Emmylou Harris and more!  The DVD also includes  audio commentaries, behind the scenes features and great digital audio.  After 1976, we were bombarded with disco, new wave, and  punk leading us into the techno 80's.  This film represents the music of the post-hippy  late 60's and early 70's best.  It is intelligent rock music performed by my some  of the greatest names in rock history.  This is one of the finest music films ever made.

I remember seeing this film as a teen-ager and knowing absolutely nothing about The Band, and being particularly amazed by Levon Helm's drumming (I'd never seen anyone play drums that way before).
But is it an accurate representation of the group? Well, read Levon's highly entertaining autobiography, ""This Wheel's on Fire,"" and you won't feel too good about that question...the book portrays the film as an ego exercise for Robbie Robertson and an adventure in lies-by-editing. Actually, that knowledge makes the film even more fun to watch, as you become aware of the endless film flattery Robertson gets -- but, hey, he was probably the most dynamic and photogenic member of the group (not to mention that he wrote great lyrics, as was subsequently confirmed by his solo albums).
Watch these guest musicians roll across the stage -- everyone from Muddy Waters to Neil Friggin' Diamond -- and you can't help but think that we have yet to reach this level of musical depth again. You also can't help but note that a lot of these musicians probably weren't cute enough to cut it on MTV, and you can't help but wonder how much modern music has suffered as a result.

I found myself hanging on every word, even the thought process of how they came up with the most uncreative of band names. what appealed to me and should to others watching this film is how scorcese's interviews with the band make you feel as though you're in the room listening to war stories from your most interesting of friends. the guest performances are as if all the planets and stars aligned for one night. neil young's ""helpless"" with a silouetted joni mitchell providing back up should provide those elusive goosebumps one receives when witnessing something beautiful. a must own for anyone with a pulse.",1021248000,,953,4.925465838509317

The Band is to the US what The Beatles, The Who and The Rolling Stones were to England. Viewers in their teens and twenties will not only learn about some of the greats (like Van Morrison, Neil Young & Joni Mitchell) but will accidently learn a bit about the history of rock and roll.
This was an amazing era. The 1976 concert was a who's who in rock and the top ticket price was $7.50. Concert goers got a Thanksgiving meal, ballroom dancing, and live music from 9 PM to 2 AM by some of the biggest names of that era.
Neil Diamon looks like he wandered in from a realtor's convention. Neil Young looks like he wandered in from an AA meeting. Eric Clapton still played blues rock rather than pop rock.

The more I watch this movie - the more I realize how good Martin is.  The way this was put together was brilliant.  One of my favorite parts is where Joni does her thing singing Coyote.  What an incredible professional and talent.  They just don't make them like her anymore.
It's amazing, but watching these guys in interviews makes you think you were more likely to meet them at a truck stop.  To think that heart-felt music like this can come from such ordinary guys blows my mind.  These guys write and sing from the heart - something that most modern music today really lacks.

This film gets better with age.  You can't watch this DVD without being moved.  Martin is right - this DVD needs to have the volume turned up to really appreciate!

A few highlights; 1. Rick Danko's soulful and honest singing of ""It Makes No Difference"", ""Stagefright"" and many others. God bless his soul. 2. Levon Helm's ""americana personified"" singing on ""The Night They Drove Ole Dixie Down"" and his perfect drumming. 3. Dylan's God-like presence and powerful performance. 4.

414565,4,6301971175,"... if you know the players and their stories.
The first time I saw ""The Last Waltz,"" I thought Robbie Robertson was the coolest guy in the world. In the film, he looks like Mick Jagger with perfected facial proportions and he's got a hipster's smooth, mesmerizing speaking voice and a world weary suggestion to his movements and I just fell for him.
But I didn't know much about The Band, then. I taped ""The Last Waltz"" off A&E in, like, 1987 because I was newly high on ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Raging Bull"" and the then recent ""After Hours."" ""Last Waltz"" was a Scorsese film I hadn't seen before and I watched it so many times that, even though I now have a non-cable copy, I still expect the commercial breaks to pop up between songs.
After my first viewing, I became a Band devotee, I read everything about them that I could, watched every documentary. Knowledge of the inner politics of The Band changed how I viewed the film and, for a time, I would've vehemently agreed with the camp that says that Robbie Robertson is pulling a Paul McCartney and that he arranged the whole event and centered himself directly in the middle of it.
However... in many ways, that makes this film a more honest portrait of a legendary group and I don't think it makes ""The Last Waltz"" any less important.
MOST bands have a powerful, charismatic figure in the middle trying to call the shots and the groups that don't have one of those types usually don't make it out of the small time. In fact, I'd be willing to say that the conflicts beneath the surface make for a more interesting document about the last official concert of one of the greatest rock groups ever.
Plus, there are bottom lines within ""The Last Waltz"" and those lines are: Robbie Robertson is an incredibly talented guy, Levon Helm is an incredibly talented guy, Garth Hudson and Richard Manuel are probably THE MOST talented of the bunch (and yet they probably say the least) and, lastly, the whole show itself wouldn't be half as much fun without the voice, the music and the personality of Rick Danko, who's none too shabby himself in terms of talent.  I'm sorry ""The Last Waltz"" was the beginning of a rift for the group, even more sorry that rift never healed up.
But the most important aspect of any concert film is, of course, the music. And the music here is great. It's also filmed by a master, Martin Scorsese, who happens to be in love with the music, too, and you can tell that.  The whole thing really gives me a feeling of a moment in time and a group of musicians completely preserved.  Everything else (the politics, the personalities, the unspoken conflicts) is just a side dish. The entre itself is excellent.",1020038400,8,2674,4.532091097308489
414566,3,6301971175,"Robbie Robertson got this move made to glorify his own massive ego. As you can see from the footage, he interrupted almost every time another member of The Band had something to say -- God forbid someone else should take the spotlight away from him. The rest of The Band look pretty miserable during the proceedings, as they knew the whole thing was a disgraceful and [unreal] sham.
This was NOT a major concert event, although the movie would have you believe it was history in the making. The Band had been on a downward spiral for years  and Robertson's contention that they had had enough of the road is laughable; they weren't playing many gigs at this point, not like the old days anyway when they were criss-crossing North America on a series of one-night stands.
As for the music, it's pretty fair. But the only truly great performance is Van Morrison's. He blew everyone off the stage that night.",1019088000,11,905,4.62111801242236
414567,5,6301971175,"I saw this movie in the fall of 1978.  I had been out of the country for two years, on assignment as a Peace Corps volunteer and had heard little American music in that time.  So when ""The Last Waltz"" came to a cinema in the capitol city, I was the first in the door.  I delayed my trip back to my site for three days, and was at the cinema for every showing.  Because I had been away from America so long, hearing this music again was a great pleasure.  Knowing that this particular music had been silent for almost two years was unbearably poignant.  In 1978 Honduras, the events two years earlier at Winterland seemed already the stuff of legend.
Watching this video almost 25 years later still gives me those feelings of pleasure and nostalgia.  It perfectly captures a moment in time when American rock music was at its peak.  The performances here are nothing short of magical:  Van Morrison leaping for joy at the end of ""Caravan"", Joni Mitchell's enigmatic half-smile in ""Coyote"", Robbie Robertson seamlessly filling in for Eric Clapton (and Clapton's subsequent seamless recovery) during an on-stage mishap.  Michael McCune's recital, in perfect Middle-English, of the openng lines of ""Canturbury Tales"" was a brilliant touch, serving to put the entire concert into the realm of timeless myth.
The music world in the late sixties and early seventies wan't all happy.  It could be hard, ugly and contentious, but none of that is apparent in this film.  This was one time when all the big talents played well together for one night, where feuds and differences were forgiven, and where the true guiding spirit of the times (dare I say it?? peace and love?) again reigned supreme, if only for one shining moment.
Call me an old fogey, but that music was good.  My lasting gratitude goes to Robertson and Scorsese for getting it down on film.

414568,3,6301971175,"First of all The Band is one of my all time favorite rock groups ever. I went and saw the re-release of the film here in Austin for the South By Southwest music and film Festival (2002), the sound was AWESOME and the film was re done very well. But I have to vent somewhat here, this was NOT the last concert by The Band, this was the last concert with Robbie Robertson, The Band went on to tour for many years without him...if you are a fan of The Band I URGE you to read this book, it's called ""Wheels on Fire"". In the book he mentions how the rest of the members didn't want to quit, nor did they want to perform this ""last concert"", but Robbie threatened legal action if they didn't. The rest of the group was at a loss as to why Neil Diamond would be performing with them.
The reason the ""The Weight"" and the song with Emmy Lou Harris are fimed in a studio and not in concert is because the camera crew was so high on coke, they didn't notice that he film had run out!!! Nice work Martin, this is a great concert film, maybe not the best(Gimmie Shelter) but I still like it as I LOVE The Band. The film is a must to have on DVD, but I just feel that the public should know some of the details about the film.

While I was standing in line outside the theatre a guy came up to me and asked if I had any spare change. When I told him that I did not he gave me fifteen cents. Thus began a most memorable night. After a full Thankgiving dinner and some waltzing,the concert began. The Band took the stage for the final concert of their long career in music. Looking back now, the members all seem way too young to be calling it quits even though The Band had always appeared to be from another century, always photographed in grainy black and white. After a full and wonderful set by The Band, special guests from throughout their career took the stage with The Band, culminating with an amazing performance from Bob Dylan. A jam ensued that included more guest stars. Almost every major band or musical icon of the sixtes was represented. Hours after the concert began, The Band returned for one last song, Don't Do It. it is this performance which opens the film version of the concert. Two years later a two record set was released with only some of the songs from the concert. Now a more comprehensive record of the event has been made available!

414570,4,6301971175,"The Last Waltz shoud NOT be Robbie Robertson. It should be The Band, one of the three or four best acts in rock (or country or ... whatever you want to call their great music.)
In fact, the one reason I took a star off my rating is there's far too much Robbie, who used this as audition for an acting careeer that never took off _ Levon Helm turned out to be more successful if less ambitious. About 80 percent of the interview time involved Robertson. I would have liked to see a lot more of Richard Manuel, whose short interviews were the best of the bunch and more of the painfully shy Garth Hudson.
Still, the music is great (although I've never been able to figure out what attracted Robertson to Neil Diamond.) In his autobiography, Levon says much of it was overdubbed in the editing because many of the performers were under the influence  during the filming to the point that one guest had to have white powder brushed off his nose.
OK, that was common and the end product is wonderful. But it should be a tribute to the entire group, not just Robertson's ego.",1017964800,12,1069,4.371859296482412

Thus we had jazz, hard blues, and free-ranging rock on the same bills, across the country...and that was *normal*!

Other artists simply spoil the concert--neil young's is okay, but still doesn't belong on the Band's final concert.  Footage of Robbie R. leading the other members of the band through the  songs, like a conductor with an orchestra is phenomenal. The sweat on the musicians matched the intensity of the performance.

In one concert you have Muddy Waters, Ronnie Hawkins, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Dr. John, Eric Clapton and Bob Dylan. What sets this apart from other concert films, are the interviews with members of The Band and the tension captured in the live performances; the pacing is dead on.

The film truly *became* a concert, with the audience clapping before and after (and sometimes during) each song. It was so exciting. (In case you're wondering who got the most applause, it was Muddy Waters.) I think it made everyone from that time feel so young and alive. If the print and sound had been better, and the screen a bit bigger, I think we would have all jumped out of our seats and rushed the stage! It was so wonderful.
Seeing this on a big screen brought out many subtleties that didn't quite register with me before. For example, the way the camera subtly moves in on the guests as they begin their performances. In particular, I love the moment the camera lowers to show a white hat and, then, Bob Dylan. The film doesn't include the introduction of him, the camera just drops down on him. There are a lot of wonderful surprises that creep up on you, fantastic moments that make this documentary a living, breathing thing.  One of my favorites is Joni Mitchell singing a haunting, ethereal backup to ""Helpless"" from behind the curtain.  Was that planned?  Rick Danko's pained delivery of ""It Makes No Difference"", with the guys all backing him up during the chorus.  If you can't feel Rick singing that song, then there is something wrong with you.  The later studio scene with Rick (working on his solo project at the time), hearing a sample of what he was working on in the studio.  That voice.  Oh god.  The sound of Muddy Waters booming through the auditorium.  An almost as deep Mavis Staples reaching way down low for ""The Weight"".  The Staples sisters smiling at their father; they really look like a *family*.  Van Morrison in his tight red suit, kicking the air.  The fake smoke during ""Evangeline"".  Everyone singing ""I Shall Be Released"" in beautiful harmony, with Richard Manuel unexpectedly sneaking in to sing lead during the second verse.  There are so many fantastic moments.  This is truly brilliant filmmaking, and as a by-product, it is a knockout concert film that just takes my breath away (or is it the other way around?).
Watching this (again and again) will be a life-altering experience, and it will make you a believer in the redemptive power and salvation that was the cornerstone of late 60s/early 70s rock and roll. It will also sadden you, however, to see that this film captured the end of that era. Sure we have our artists now, but somehow this society has made it harder for men to be as emotional and as close as we see displayed here. I love seeing several of the guys sharing a microphone. I think modern rock guys are too afraid to stand that close in public, let alone have their mouths that close together. Where did we go wrong?
Will the next Bob Dylan, Neil Young, or Bruce Springsteen please STAND UP???? To he** with ""slim shady""!!!!",994550400,2,3081,4.556159420289855

414706,5,6301971175,"The Band are fortunate to have had Martin Scorsese film this historic concert in 1976. The Band and their guests are all in peak form, and a top-shelf film crew captures it all. A masterpiece in many ways.

When Scorcese and Robbie Robertson edited the film, it was kept short enough to fit theatre-preferred movie time slots. Maybe if they'd known the film was to become so critically-acclaimed, they would have originally included the rest of the concert in its first release.

Gratefully, we now have a remastered DVD release. Yet other than footage of one of the after-concert jams, nearly half the concert remains unreleased on film. As Scorcese said in an interview for this release, they'd done an exhaustive search and what became of the rest of the footage is presently a mystery. (The complete audio of the entire concert is preserved on the new expanded 4-CD set.)

I was lucky enough to be at the concert. The Band played an entire concert of their songs, and after a break, brought out the guests, backing them so well it rivaled or surpassed the guest's original release of their songs. The Band was on stage for at least 5 hours that Thanksgiving night.

It's hoped someone eventually stumbles upon the rest of the footage in the vaults, and we may then have a complete film of the historic performances of a concert for the ages.",991008000,,1345,4.686440677966102
414707,5,6301971175,"Martin Scorsese, the one director who can make film sing, captures The Band's farewell concert as a celebration of musical passion of religious zealotry perfectly wedded with expert craftsmanship. Coming along for the ride are some of the finest musicians of the 20th Century: Eric Clapton, Van Morrison, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young among others.
Scorsese's camera soars, tracks, and dances around his subjects, bringing them off the stage and into your consciousness.
The Band members themselves prove to be insightful, honest if rather surely as interview subjects. They do provide many amusing anecdotes about both the creative process and their direct participation in the rich history of American music.
As the opening titles insist: This film should be played loud. When done so, The Last Waltz will literally set your feet to tapping and your soul to flying. Many many of my gray days have hit the road in the wake of watching this film. If you are a fan of great music, don't miss this one.",988848000,27,1007,4.964497041420119

Obviously, since the film was shot in 1976, the sound quality is not up to the pristine standards of the 21st century (hopefully some digital re-mastering will add some enhanced stereo spread). I was amazed at The Band's ability to seamlessly adapt to each new guest artist's style, while still adhering to their own sound (witness Robbie's lightning takeover of Eric Clapton's solo in ""Further On Up The Road"" when his guitar strap breaks on stage!)  The breadth of talent of the artists presented for this concert has yet to be duplicated on ANY concert film, as far as I'm concerned. Neil Young was obviously having the musical time of his life!

414709,5,6301971175,"""The Last Waltz"" was one of the very first films I ever purchased new on VHS, and I have enjoyed it consistently for the last 12 years.  This movie captures one of the most symbiotic relationships between music and film I have ever seen.  Martin Scorsese only had one chance to get this movie right, and he did a great job.
Watch the closeup footage of Levon Helm engulfed in a cool blue light while belting out an amazing version of ""Ophelia"".  Watch Joni Mitchell filmed in a silouhette backstage as she secretly sings backup to Neil Young's ""Helpless"".  Watch Dr. John's hands float effortlessly over the piano keyboard while performing a rousing version of ""Such A Night"".  Watch Rick Danko as he curiously peers over at Bob Dylan, completely unsure of what song they are about to launch into next.  Filled with countless moments like these, ""The Last Waltz"" is pure enjoyment to the very end.
Since falling in love with this movie, I have learned that drummer Levon Helm was a very uncooperative participant in the production of the movie.  He was not ready for The Band to quit, he believed that Robbie Robertson wanted to make this movie only to further his ""rock star"" persona, he did not like the fact that Neil Diamond was involved in this project only because Robbie Robertson had just produced a record for him, and from Day 1, he did not like Martin Scorsese.
Knowing that, it is interesting to note how removed Levon seems to be during the interviews, and how much Robbie playes the ""Rock Star"" role, professing exhaustion from the road, and not knowing how he can go on with this lifestyle.
I am not saying that Levon or Robbie is right or wrong, I am just saying that it is interesting to watch this movie knowing how at least one of the members of the group felt about the project.
If you care about music and quality filmaking, ""The Last Waltz"" should be part of your permanent collection.",969580800,149,1907,4.574780058651027
414710,5,6301971175,"Although I didn't know it at the time, one of the biggest mistakes of my life was on Thaksgiving Day 1976 when I passed up a ticket to the Last  Waltz concert at Winterland to have dinner with my girlfriend. The  girlfriend is long gone but the movie is a part of my life.  My wife thinks  I'm crazy but every year I hold at least one ""Last Waltz party""  for many of my good friends.  It's amazing how those who have never seen  this movie are blown away!  I've given copies of the video as well as the  CD to many friends and I must have purchased the last VHS copy on the  planet earlier this year.  I have been frantically trying to purchase a  copy and have met with no luck.  The video is out of print and a DVD  version is planned.  Check out the Last Waltz web site.....it's great!  The Last Waltz never tires and you find something new each time you watch  it.  As Dr. John says prior to 'Such a Night'....""this one's for the  Band and all the fellas"". You better believe it...it was 'Such a  Night'!",965952000,7,1008,4.124352331606218
414711,5,6301971175,"...and it doesn't matter that they came crawling back later, as all the legends seem to do, in ill-conceived, poorly-received reunions. This was an absolutely deserved celebration/sendoff of this anachronistic band. Much bigger stars than them came onstage to pay them homage, and were rewarded with wonderful accompaniment. ""I just wanna say, before I start, that it's one of the pleasures of my life to be onstage with these people,"" said Neil Young, as he joins Jonie Mitchell and The Band, creating for a moment a Canadian supergroup.

The highest of the many high points in the film is the concert footage of Van Morrison. The Band coaxed this notoriously nervous performer into delivering a wild, joyous, smokin' rendition of ""Caravan"". Robbie Robertson wrung the last bit of soul out of this very soulful number with his guitar, so much so, that Van nearly blew his lines, he was grooving to it so much. It is much better than the version on Morrison's own classic live album, ""It's Too Late To Stop Now"", and it may well be Morrison's finest recorded live moment.

There's much more: Ronnie Hawkins delivers an uproarious version of ""Who Do You Love""; Levon Helm matches Paul Butterfield yelp for yelp in ""Mystery Train""; Robertson holds his own with Eric Clapton on ""Farther On Up The Road"", much more so than the facelessly competent sidemen Clapton usually uses. The interview segments are unintentionally funny sometimes, as the laconic Band members field questions and give reminisces to the overcaffeinated Martin Scorcese.

Ironically, the less effective parts of the concert are the supposedly climatic numbers with Bob Dylan. ""I Don't Believe You"", in particular, sounds stiff when compared to the full-on, fur-flying versions from the Royal Albert Hall days a decade earlier. The Band's own songs pale just a little in comparison with their own earlier live recordings, too (though the footage of the late Rick Danko and Richard Manuel singing is now quite poignant). The studio numbers with The Staple Singers and Emmylou Harris are wonderful country, pure Americana.

The DVD extras include the usual flashback commentary, but also the only extra musical footage from the concert, a long, shuffling blues jam. It's led by Garth Hudson, Paul Butterfield, and Neil Young. A couple of guests who aren't in the rest of the film show up: Carl Radle and Stephen Stills. Young and Stills barely glance at each other, but their guitars mesh quite nicely. Oddly, Eric Clapton plays for a few bars, and then gets up, speaks to Butterfield, and leaves. Wonder what that was about...

All in all, this is a wonderful, revelatory film, a perfect introduction to a band that was influential beyond all proportion to their own popularity. Tell your children! Rock wasn't always ""just noise"". It had heart, soul, and people who truly loved to play it.",963273600,3,2855,5.002105263157895
