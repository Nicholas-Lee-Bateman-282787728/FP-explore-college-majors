2881364,5,B000S62BC6,"The Best so far. I found truly instructional and revolutionary the approach to Tango lessons on this DVD. Particularly the graphics and animations showing the steps one by one in full detail. Another cool point in favor of this particular DVD is the easy going nature of the tango instructors, Gaston and... well I can't remember her name of the top of my head, but really cool. I'm planning a trip to Buenos Aires in September and I'm gonna look for this Tango Brujo Academy, it sounds good.",1182643200,4,492,4.6022727272727275
8204356,1,B000S62BC6,Not at all what I expected from the description.  Not easy to watch and the instructions are not good at all.,1377216000,,109,4.190476190476191
8204357,2,B000S62BC6,"The positive reviews for this DVD are very misleading. You have to struggle to learn dancing tango using this teaching method and composition of the disk. The disc includes several absolutely useless chapters at the beginning, but takes a little time to show the elements. It is very difficult to see the follower's steps because she was dressed in somewhat funny pants instead of nice little tango dress.
Don't trust positive reviews.",1293321600,,435,5.055555555555555
8204358,5,B000S62BC6,"This Tango Steps dvd is very easy to learn and I reccommend it for couples preparing a tango dance for weddings or special events, with these basics steps you can create your own choreography very easily!",1233273600,2,204,4.694444444444445
8204359,2,B000S62BC6,"Like many of these ""learn to( whatever)in six easy lessons, the demonstrations and illustrations come at you just once and too rapidly to be of any value. Plus navigating the disk for repeats was a pain. Not much help in learning a complex dance.",1206835200,2,246,4.613636363636363
8204360,5,B000S62BC6,Great Argentina Tango lessons for the beginners. Very easy instructions. You can learn new moves pretty quickly. Hope to see intermidiate and advance Tango lessons from these instructors in near future.,1206489600,2,202,5.548387096774194
8204361,3,B000S62BC6,"There are some interesting oddities in this video.  First, they take you shopping.  I'm pretty expert at that; I don't need lessons.  Second, in the first few scenes, the dancers materialize on set in Star Trek fashion.  It's comical.  Third, the girl with the extremely green eyes and low cut dress on the DVD box is not in the DVD at all.

However, despite this, I gave it a somewhat positive rating because the dancers are clear, they have a good style, and they cover most of the basics that can be expected in a beginning tango dvd.  The woman is not very verbal, but the man is quite clear in his explanations and demonstrates a very strong lead.  The dancing is very competent and they show tango well in classic Argentine style.  Though there are a couple of video tricks that amuse, there is generally good, well lit photography and from angles that make it easy to learn.

I would buy it again, even knowing the limitations.",1206403200,9,934,4.505952380952381
8204362,5,B000S62BC6,"Well, very simple, but gets you - you start liking all this. Just these drawings... actually, they confuse you... But - you catch the taste.",1200182400,,140,4.64
8204363,5,B000S62BC6,"Very helpful reviews.  Could someone answer one question for me?  What is this basic step they talk about on the DVD?  I've gone to some tango classes and the variation and complexity of what they call ""the basic"" is all over the place?  Is it something simple that I could pick up right away?

Laer",1193097600,,299,4.363636363636363
8204364,5,B000S62BC6,"Great DVD!  The lessons are complete and done very slowly - first they go over the man's steps, then the woman's.  Great video for the beginner.  Glad we purchased it, my husband and I have had a great time learning together!",1187740800,6,225,4.439024390243903
8204365,5,B000S62BC6,"Meet Gastn and Mariela, two of the most casual, cool, unstructured tango instructors. They have perfected the art of showing the essentials. What really matters to to them is that you learn the moves, the figures, the steps without having to worry somuch about the way your hair looks or where did you buy or how much you paid for that pair of shoes or a fancy skirt.

This is the time, and Gastn and Mariela are going to guide you through the basics: El Abrazo, La Caminata, El Ocho and El sanguchito, basic concepts of this wonderful dance that has the World on it's feet.

Gaston and Mariela, accomplished tango dancers and teachers from Buenos Aires, we'll help you through the basic notions and movements so you too can learn how to dance the tango. It takes two to tango, and just one DVD, this is it!
