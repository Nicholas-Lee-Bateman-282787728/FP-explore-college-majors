6165737,5,B00HHYF5CU,"Our 2 year old loves this video, he tries to get us to let him watch it over and over but of course we won't but it was worth the money. wish they had a little more of mr perkins like they normally do, my son loves him.",1398643200,3,219,3.5833333333333335

6165739,5,B00HHYF5CU,"This is a new Thomas and Friends DVD that is perfect for any Thomas fan. This selection of episodes is very nice. I have noticed that many other children's television shows these days talk down to the audience like they are complete idiots. How do you expect children to learn when they are spoken to like that? These Thomas stories, however, treat the audience a bit more maturely. These stories teach not only lessons about friendship, but also the real workings of a railway and engineering terms, which are both marketable skills.",1396828800,7,534,4.815217391304348
6165740,5,B00HHYF5CU,"We have been watching Thomas & Friends for about seven years now and honestly he doesn't get old.  The show is wholesome and full of colors that it is cute and fun to watch.  My 2 year old daughter now loves to watch Thomas & Friends but somehow we always miss it on television so having this DVD is awesome.  We can watch Thomas & Friends anytime and with six episodes there is plenty to watch.  All the episodes feature accidents and great lessons on how to fix them.  Now we do miss them on television like I said but this title does say ""6 Never-Before Seen Adventures"" so for a Thomas-fan this would be a secret gem to own!

Episodes Include:

Away From the Sea
The Smelly Kipper
No More Mr. Nice Engine
Gone Fishing
Thomas Shortcut
The Afternoon Tea Express",1394928000,15,763,4.330985915492958
6165741,5,B00HHYF5CU,"Thomas & Friends have been friends of my sons since he was about two years old. At almost six his eyes still light up at the site of a new Thomas DVD like the latest Spills & Thrills from Lionsgate and Hit Entertainment. I see the age is rated 2 - 5 so I wonder if our Thomas days are running out. Luckily I have a new baby boy that will fall in love with Thomas about the same time big brother outgrows him!

Ironically one of the episodes was about being afraid of the dark and that's something we've been dealing with lately with both of my children. I love when we watch shows that deal with topics that are very real and current to them. It helps them not to feel so alone and to realize that they are normal and it's ok to admit your fears. James doesn't want to admit his fear of the dark but in true Thomas & Friends form, he is shown how to deal with it. It also opens the door for an honest and real discussion about it.

Thomas & Friends are often silly and always getting into trouble but I love that they always do the right thing in the end. That's another lesson I really want to sink in with my kids.

Whether your child is a new Thomas fan or an old one tried and true, the new Spills & Thrills will be a hit in your home!",1393891200,7,1239,3.948

6165838,4,B00HHYF5CU,"I'm an older thomas fan who didn't approve of the cgi switchover at first, and that opinion was made worse by the disastrous writing style of Sharon Miller, but I've grown fond of the series again since Andrew Brenner took over as head writer. Brenner has taken the show back to the glory days of Ringo Starr and George Carlin. The best part of the new episodes is the resurrecting of characters who haven't appeared since before the switchover. Harvey, Bill and Ben all appear in Gone Fishing. Although Duck isn't in this DVD, he is featured in the DVD The Thomas Way. The new character, Porter, is a nice addition to the show. This DVD includes two Mr. Perkins segments between episodes. In the second segment, he reads the book version of the episode Rusty Helps Peter Sam, seen on the DVD Rusty To The Rescue, another throwback to the model days.",1402185600,,850,4.562091503267974
