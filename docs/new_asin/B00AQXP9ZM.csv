8556669,4,B00AQXP9ZM,"One of the most interesting takes on Sonic.  It's good for a laugh, and I enjoyed it a lot more than the one featuring the chicken and drillbot.  The songs are sometimes awkwardly forced into the episode, but are almost always fun to hear.  I feel like Underground is the like the missing link between SATAM Sonic and the more goofbally versions of the show out at the time.",1515542400,,374,4.391304347826087
