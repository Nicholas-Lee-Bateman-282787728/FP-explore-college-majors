501659,5,6302722551,"""Zentropa"" (or ""Europa"" as it is called in Europe) marks the end of Lars von Trier's (the director) Europe-trilogy, which started in 1986 with ""The Element of Crime"" followed by  ""Epedemic"". ""Zentropa"" is a real film-noir in Hitchkock  style. The movie, like the rest of the Europe-trilogy, was a co-production  between Lars von Trier and Niels Vrsel; both great screenwriters.
The  thing which is so special about ""Zentropa"" are:  1) It is made  without ANY digital effects.  2) It is shoot in B/W.  3) All importent  elements in the movie have colour (a thing Spielberg stole from Trier, when  he made ""Schientlers List""). 4) It has a great story. 5) It is a  Trier film.
The cinematography is great, so is the acting; especially Max  von S. is great. Also notice that Lars von Trier himself has a small  role.
If you want to know more about this film, you should read the book  ""Lars von Triers elements"". If you are just looking for some  saturdaynight entertaintment...this is not what you want. However if you  want so see a quality movie in world class, this is a modern classic...  Don't miss it.",959040000,28,1104,4.666666666666667
501660,5,6302722551,"The story of an American exile in Germany during the end of WWII. Germany is almost like a ghost town. The only connection to life seemingly being the constant back and forth of the trains which takes people away from  their past lives and into unknown territories. The story is very cleverly  told, with a voice over narration by Max Von Sydow playing a sort of all  mighty hypnotist who decides our principal character's destiny. The film  stands out not because of its rather simple tale, but as a visual marvel.  Von Trier (""Breaking the Waves"") seems to have an inate desire to  breakthrough the rules of cinema, and in ""Zentropa"" (Originally  titled ""Europa"") he comes close to fusing experimental visual  imagery with the classic Hollywood narrative. It is a an exhilirating film  to watch from beginning down to the very final frame. (Look out for Von  Trier himself making a cameo as ""the Jew"")",956793600,6,903,4.767741935483871
501661,5,6302722551,"Zentropa is the antithesis of Dogme 95.  Everything in this picture is tweeked and manipulated: sounds, background/foreground, camera angles, light, etc.  And von Trier demonstrates his enormous talent for  mise-en-scene.  There are scenes here that are mindblowing.  Again:  everything is tweeked for maximum effect.
The story is weak and  undeveloped.  However, this is a monumental picture just because there is  so much going on.  A feast for the eyes and the intellect.",956102400,2,474,5.458333333333333
501662,3,6302722551,"The other reviews here focus almost exclusively on the cinematography and direction (both of which were excellent), rather than on the story itself, which could have used some major work.
Although the concept of an  American ""everyman"" exploring post-WW II Germany is brilliant,  the execution is poor. The concept of the Werwolf (the German spelling)  organization is introduced, but otherwise it is handled as though it were  just a run-of-the-mill terrorist group. No effort is made to explore the  deeper philosophical or ideological implications of the group, it just  seems to fall into the Holywood stereotype ""Bad  Nazi""-mold.
Furthermore, the plot is extremely trite and  predictable. The only real surprise comes in the form of the protagonist's  ultimate fate. But other than that moment, the story runs like a grade-B  thriller. The protagonist is drawn into a tug-of-war between rival parties  that wish to exploit his position with the Zentropa rail company. However,  given that the protagonist is such a sweet guy, can there be any doubt  about which side he will ultimately choose? (Can you imagine Jimmy Stewart  as a terrorist? If not, you won't be able to imagine Leopold as one  either.) And although the film treats the revelation about his wife's true  loyalties as though it were a shocking discovery, anyone who paid attention  to her comments during the model train display scene should have been able  to figure out where her sympathies were. Now if the film had taken the time  to explore her reasons for her allegiances, it could have been much  better.
Finally, the marvelous Udo Kier is wasted in a role that has only  about 10 minutes of screen time and has next to no significance to the  plot. Other than the character ultimately being killed off to show what  mean guys the Werwolves were, I can't even figure out a good reason to have  included him. There are other details which could be critiqued as well  (such as why would the assassins sent to kill Ravenstein wait until they  were in the compartment with him to load their guns? Wouldn't it make a lot  more sense to have loaded the guns before boarding the train?), but it is  not fair to expect a film to make every concession to reality.
If you  want to see a film which handled the psychology of post-WW II Europe much  better, I would suggest ""The Third Man"". If you want to know the  real story of the Werwolf organization, read Perry Biddiscombe's  ""Werwolf!: The History of the National Socialist Guerilla  Movement"".",945302400,3,2517,4.847058823529411

501708,5,6302722551,"At the beginning of the film Europa a hypnotic mental countdown invites the viewer to enter the strange demilitarized world of post-war Germany where American soldiers, determined to root out all Nazi sympathizers, control the government, industry, and all transportation. Into this dark and ruined world comes Leopold Kessler (Mr Aspirant), a young American soldier who, having gone AWOL has set out to find his German uncle. His uncle enlists him for training as a sleeping car conductor on the Zentropa Company train line where he undergoes the farce of being taught to make beds and shine shoes using a highly disciplined and methodical system governed with petty rules. Under the baleful eye of his uncle, Kessler's bumbling efforts lead to strife and conflict, for nothing is as it seems on board the train to Bremen. The train is a gloomy, highly contrasted world of compartments and catacombs and narrows aisles, like a painting by Hieronymus Bosch where everybody seems touched by strange light. The camera alternates between mono and colour images, heightening the feeling of evolving plots and transmutation. In the eerie atmosphere, undercover agents of the notorious ""Werewolf"" partisans are planning to dynamite the train, and Kessler inadvertently plays into their hands. Before long, the noose of panic tightens and the train carriage, already dark and claustrophobic, fills with fear. As the train explodes, crashing spectacularly over a bridge and into a river, we witness Kessler's last moments. The first casualty is sound; all noise is smothered under the flood of ice-cold water filling the car. In the silence that ensues, we watch the horrifying countdown to Kessler's death as he fights desperately for air . . .

The voice-over that starts the countdown to Kessler's death begins:  `On the count of ten you will be dead,' says the voice. To the call of the numbers and through layers of sheer panic and desperation, we watch Kessler drown: `One . . . two . . . three . . . four . . . five . . . six . . . seven . . . eight . . . nine . . . ten. You are dead.'

We are now immersed with the dead Leopold Kessler in the cold dark waters of the river (above, people are still alive), and we watch as the force of the stream opens the door to the car and leads his drowned body away, to follow the river as days go by, finally to head out for the ocean that mirrors the sky. `One second of infinite rest . . . You want to free yourself but it is not possible,' says the voice.

What often puts me in mind of the film is the notion that our lives are part of some great footprint in the sand. Dying is regularly thought of as rejoining nature (in this case, the sea) to become awash in the driving force of life again. The fact is that the last scene in the film is chilling. Like all of us, Leopold Kessler was trapped on a journey whose direction was uncertain and whose destination was unknown. He died a victim of the machinations of others; his short life is played out in surrealistic ways mixed with political means and ends in the strange reality of post-war Germany where to fight for your own country was a crime. His petty duties, the trivia of being a sleeping car conductor, and the farcical examination, all heightened the senselessness into which his world had fallen. The end came suddenly, unexpectedly, his dead body left to float for days before it rejoined ""the ocean that mirrors the sky"". Superficially, it seems that Europa may be proposing this as a way to tackle the problem of the end, so that the preceding, apparently senseless life takes on purpose. But, the key to the film is the mood and atmosphere, and one can't help feeling at the end of the story that one has just finished being told the universe is a joke.  And a contemptible joke at that.

Whatever Trier's intent, we are hugely entertained by a masterful filmmaker. Europa has the elusive quality of finishing without concluding. This makes it a classic.",1368489600,4,3966,4.626420454545454
501709,4,6302722551,"In post-Nazi Germany, Leo, a young American man of German descent gets a job with the help of his uncle working the railway.  In the process he finds his beliefs and political stand questioned, exploited and abused at the hands of everyone he meets.  He is torn in considerable directions and his inability to displease makes him a perfect pawn for many trying to get ahead in their own right.  With the crushing presence of the Werewolves, a group of Nazi fanatics continuing to fight their fight even after the war has ended, Leo questions his own loyalties and the loyalties of those around him as his relationships become ploys to manipulate his actions.

Or something like that.

`Europa' is a chilling cinematic experience presented to us by the master of chilling, Lars von Trier.  It is a visually arresting film (that cinematography is outstanding) and it is technically masterful, from the set pieces to the pitch-perfect score, and yet there is something off kilter that causes me to question my own feelings on the film.  There is something unbalanced here.  The tonal direction of the film can seem confused at times (it does have an almost stagey soap operatic feel to it in parts and yet a deeply sinister edge that doesn't always mesh properly) and the overall impact is stilted because of that.  It is a very cold film, and I'm sure that was intentional, but it can feel slightly off-putting.  It isn't like von Trier is a stranger to `cold' since he thrives in that sort of atmosphere, but the elements here don't always come together as tightly as they should have.

That said, it is an experience worth being had.  The acting is up to par for the most part, with Jorgen Reenberg, Ernst-Hugo Jaregard and Barbara Sukowa nailing their supporting roles, and Max von Sydow's narration is possible the best use of narration in any film I have ever seen.

The moral complexities at bay here, especially those surrounding the views on neutrality, cut like a knife and linger in the viewer's mind long after the film ends.  Listening to a man of God defend the atrocities of Nazism and condemn the `lukewarm' or neutral (a complete twisting of scripture) was an astonishing stroke of character development.  Lars commands the screen as usual (his films are always HIS films) and certainly makes this slightly uneven film a must see experience.",1347321600,3,2355,4.780246913580247

So, I considered von trier a great director. I bought europa thinking it would be amazing and it was this pretentious piece of garbage. The constant color on black and white and overlapping frames came off as trying too hard. ""Look! I'm an artist!"" Sad.

501712,5,6302722551,"Notable Awards received: Nominated for the Palm d'Or Cannes, Won Best Artistic Contribution Cannes, Won Jury Prize Cannes, Won Technical Grand Prize

For some reason despite my obsession with European cinema I've never felt compelled to watch the works of the Danish l'enfant terrible Lars von Trier (he gave the finger to the judges at Cannes when Europa failed to win the Palm d'Or).  However, desperate to find something worthwhile to watch I discovered Europa.  And, with Max von Sydow's stunning introductory narration telling me to be seduced, I was seduced, but by what exactly?  I'm still not exactly sure but I shall try desperately/earnestly to explain myself.

But first...

It is necessary to detach yourself from the Lars von Trier of Breaking the Waves, Dogville, and Manderlay.  This film was made in his pre-Dogma film style.

And...

... here's a limited non-spoiler plot summary:  An American pacifist named Leopold Kessler travels to post-WWII Germany to find a job.  He joins his alcoholic uncle as a sleeping-car conductor for the mysterious Zentropa railways which crisscross Germany.  Eventually he falls for the daughter, Katharina Hartmann, of the owner of Zentropa and becomes involved with a shadowy conspiracy against Germany's occupiers.

And the viewer enters a the visually stunning nightmarish world of post-War Germany rendered brilliantly by Lars von Trier's camera:  characters interacting with back screen projections, heavy contrast black and white (think Welles' The Third Man), highly selective use of color (think Tarkovsky's Solyaris), and hallucinatory nighttime journeys through train stations, train cars, tunnels...

Lars von Trier deliberately deconstructs (reverently) American film-noir thrillers.  I must admit that I was so entranced by the individual images of this sumptuous/disturbing feast that Lars von Trier's apparent message became of secondary importance.  Is this supposed to be an apologetic piece?  Perhaps most importantly, does it have historical locality -- i.e. directly an attack on the ""idealistic"" American occupation after the war?  Or, is this a parable to be divorced from its historical locality?

Perhaps we should look at this film more explicitly as a reinterpretation of The Third Man more than simply as an homage.  In Welles' The Third Man an American author uncovers the corruption of another American in post-war Vienna.  Here, an idealistic American discovers a group of Germans--completely desensitized by the constant death surrounding them during the war--who still ""fight"" for Germany despite the continued loss of human life.  This group of Germans manipulate the American who does not understand the environment he's entering.  The Germans perpetuate destruction but their reasoning remains aloof yet somehow even dignified.  What are we to make of this reinterpretation of the players in post-War Germany?

And it is here that words fail me.  I was absorbed completely by the murky waters of von Trier's Europa and I'm strangely satisfied by this unresolved murkiness.

Pretty pictures cast spells.

A truly remarkable experience.  Its message, if it has one, remains strangely distant.

And so I implore you -- Listen to Max von Sydow

""You will now listen to my voice. My voice will help you and guide you still deeper into Europa. Every time you hear my voice, with every word and every number, you will enter into a still deeper layer, open, relaxed and receptive....""

An absolutely worthwhile film.  Find it!  Watch it!",1278201600,19,3514,5.361974405850091

501714,3,6302722551,"I know this film Europa (also known as Zentropa) is supposed to be great, but ultimately, I just found it quite uninteresting.  I thought Lars Von Trier's ""Breaking The Waves"" was quite brilliant, but Europa was a little too meandering and unfocused to keep my attention.

I do give the director some credit for at least avoiding the usual film-making cliches, but I got the feeling he doesn't really care about the audience, either - it's like he made this movie just to please himself, but forgot to ask if his guests (we the audience) were having a good time.",1255046400,4,562,4.61
501715,4,6302722551,"I really enjoyed this picture on the first viewing.  However, it needs multiple viewings for full appreciation.  The transfer from B&W to color and back is interesting and done very well on certain scenes.  The director (von Trier) did a great job in making this 90's  picture feel like the traditionally yesteryear noir genre (set in Germany; post-WWII).  Also, interesting that this is the last part of a trilogy, yet does very well on its own.",1252713600,3,446,4.815789473684211
501716,3,6302722551,"This is one of Von Trier's most unseen films.  It was initially released as Zentropa (the name of Lars's production company) to avoid confusion with Europa, Europa.  When it was released on home video initially, it was a pan and scan print that did no justice to the film.  Now, Criterion has put it out in a stunning, 2.35:1 DVD, so is it a good film?

There is much to like in Europa.  The cinematography and the mise-en-scene is beautiful.  Von Trier's early work (this film and The Element of Crime, his debut) show a great eye for composition and framing that was abandoned in his later work for a hand held, jump cut style.  He also uses long takes in this film quite well, and the film has one of the more unique looks in his filmography.  It is mostly shot in black and white with splashes of color.  There are a lot of back screen projections that give the film a real sense of nightmare, and it works quite well.

There are some very funny moments, especially with Ernst-Hugo Jregrd as the uncle who gets his American nephew, Jean-Marc Barr, a job working in Germany after WWII.  He gives the best performance in the film.  Jean-Marc Barr's performance is good, but his character is rather one note.  Barr's character is so simplistically written he might as well have had ""idealist"" tattooed to his forehead.  In fact, the script of Europa is the weakest thing about the film.  You can marvel at the look of the film (and it does look fantastic), but ultimately, it's not an insightful look at post-war Germany.  Most of the dialogue is expository, and most of the characters feel like caricatures, not real people.  In fact, aside from Ernst-Hugo Jregrd's character (which is very funny), the whole cast (with former Fassbinder regulars Barbara Sukowa & Udo Kier, and Godard and Fassbinder regular Eddie Constantine) slog their way through their one note characterisations.  They're such good actors that they're worth watching, but I wish they had more to do.

While they are some amazing shots in this film, it's a rather hollow film.  Still, I did like it, even though I felt it could have been much more profound.",1240444800,6,2129,4.641711229946524

501748,3,6302722551,"Seen together, Lars Von Trier's Europa trilogy isn't exactly a profound experience, but it does underline the fact that even when he's boring he's never dull. Seen separately - The  Element of  Crime,  Europa  and  Epidemic  are only available  together in  a lavish European PAL 4-disc  set, with  Epidemic currently unavailable at all in the  US - none of them should work and none of them do, yet on another level there's an audacity to them that engages far more than the subject matter: at times, the hypnotic execution is more than enough to compensate for the narrative confusion. Indeed, the whole trilogy seems to be driven by dreams and trances. Europa, aka Zentropa, even opens with Max Von Sydow's unseen narrator hypnotising the audience to bring them into the film. The film itself is the closest to a mainstream narrative of the trilogy, but even here Von Trier is constantly undercutting his noirish plot - an idealistic American becomes a pawn in the amoral politics of post-War Germany still plagued by the Nazi `Werwolf' resistance movement - with both strikingly expressionistic imagery (not least an audacious use of backprojected images) and that trademark fevered confusion until mindless destruction seems the only release. Of the three, this is the most visually audacious, with a superb use of black and white scope imagery that helps compensate for the awful performances by Jean Marc-Barr and Barbara Sukowa (who once again proves that she may be able to speak English and German but she can't act in either of them). Still, the presence of Ernst-Hugo Jaregard (so wonderful in The Kingdom) ensures that not all the cast are carved from wood.

While it's  not as  comprehrensive  as  the European 4-disc boxed  set, full marks for Criterion's excellent presentation - not only is Europa/Zentropa presented in a good 2.35:1 transfer but many of the extras from the European set have been carried over.",1232236800,3,1928,4.993730407523511

On the train to learn his new job, he travels through destroyed, occupied Germany and meets Katharina Hartmann (Barbara Sukowa), daughter of the owner of Zentropa, Max Hartmann (Jorgen Reenberg).  Leopold stays neutral between the allied forces and the Germans, and learns of a terrorist group that is killing the sympathizers of the allies and conducting subversive actions against the allied forces.  He also falls in love with Katharina, who soon reveals something about her background that seriously strains their relationship.
 Shot in both black-and-white and color, ""Europa"" has a dreamlike quality as it takes us through a nation still stunned and broken by defeat.  We sympathize with Leopold's loyalty conflicts even though the plot is often tough to follow.  The visuals, however, are amazing, as they illustrate time period and setting and contribute to mood.

They talk about the film's troubled beginnings and the struggle to get financing. They laugh and joke like old friends and tell all kinds of filming anecdotes, pointing out some of the techniques used to get certain shots. This is quite an entertaining and engaging track.

Europa was seen as the last film of a trilogy that included&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Element-of-Crime-Criterion-Collection/dp/0780023277/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Element of Crime - Criterion Collection</a>&nbsp;and Epidemic. Von Trier shows how many of the images in the film were inspired by ones out of children's' books. He shot the fore and backgrounds separately and then merged them together which took some time. There is footage of Von Trier shooting exteriors in Poland. This doc really conveys what an impressive and technically challenging film it was to make.

Also included is a theatrical trailer.

The second disc begins with ""Trier's Element,"" an interview with the filmmaker, including footage from the set of Europa and the press conference at its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in 1991. He comes across as very smart and shrewd about how he is perceived. Von Trier comes up with some real gems like, ""I like to turn shooting into something of a happening."" This featurette provides fascinating insight into his philosophy and working methods.

""Anecdotes from Europa"" is a short documentary about the film's production with the cast and crew talking about the experience. Jean-Marc Barr talks about what drew him to the film. Producer Peter Jensen talks about the challenge to get the film financed. This is an excellent look at how Europa came together.

""From Dreyer to Von Trier"" features director of photography Henning Bendisen talking about working early in his career with the legendary Carl Theodor Dreyer and his later, final films with Von Trier. He also talks about his approach to filmmaking.

""The Emotional Music Script"" is an interview with composer Joachim Holbek and he talks about his approach to the score for Europa. He says that he was influenced by modern ballet. Von Trier asked him to work on the film and discusses what it was like to collaborate with the director.

""Lars von Trier - Anecdotes"" features various crew members, who have worked with the director over the years, sharing stories about him. Early on, he hated working with actors and hardly spoke to them but has mellowed somewhat over time. However, one gets the feeling that his tyrant image is just that.

""A Conversation with Lars von Trier"" was done in 2005 about the Europe trilogy. He talks about when he first got the idea to do three films. This is a pretty in-depth conversation that runs over 40 minutes. It is evident that he has lost little of the bemused provocateur over the years.

Finally, there is ""Europa: The Faecal Location,"" which features amusing footage of the cast and crew's hotel rooms while shooting on location in Poland and the things they did to amuse themselves when not filming.",1229299200,3,3235,5.170172084130019

I am very glad I still own the original laserdisc of this film when it was titled ""Zentropa"" as it has English subtitles.

This dvd is an english dub with Korean subtitles which doesnt help when the characters speak german and the subtitles are in Korean. Fortunantly the english speaking parts tell the main story and its not hard to follow. Beautifully filmed and well acted with some truly memorable scenes- especially the voiced countdown to the drowning of the main character. It combines elements of Schindlers list- Sin City- and is a near cousin to any of Hitchcocks best films. I cant recommend this movie enough- it is one of the best movies of the last 20 years or so in my opinion. This is truly deserving of an official criterion or Anchor BAy release though any release would be great.,1185408000,2,851,4.642384105960265

501777,4,6302722551,"As a young boy at the age of 7 my mother took me to Germany in the early 1950s. Although to young to be aware of the political  climate of post war germany, I do recall the plight of the average German in their efforts to rebuild. German was learned quickly by this american born boy who played in the ruins of bombed out buildings with his German peers. To me the director of this movie has encapsulated (through the lighting,use of black and white and other cinematic tricks)a sense of the time period involved. This is why I had to own Zentropa. Lars Von Trier is able to move the viewer past the story line (which is based more in surrealism than any historic event)to a different time period the way a painter can move a viewer with his skillful brush strokes beyond a two dimensional painting.",1140998400,7,799,4.398648648648648

It's a bloody shame this is not currently available as this is one of those films that deserves a much wider audience.  As a personal aside, everyone I've shared this film with - and what a widely disparate assortment of folk that is - has been astonished by it.  von Triers pays homage to the great expressionist filmmakers who went before him and he does them proud.

von Triers realizes the medium of film and applies the qualities of a true gesumkunstwerk - every element, from script to lighting, to sounds to visual images and beyond has been carefully, masterfully calculated for its total effect.  The entire movie is not unlike a trip and the ultimate destination of Zentropa is both expected and mindbogglingly shocking.

501779,5,6302722551,"The voice of Max von Sydow hypnotizes the audience by stating, ""You will now listen to my voice..."" as he continuous to count to ten, which pulls the viewer into a nightmarish dream.  Simultaneously the opening shot of railroad tracks is flashing by, which visually puts the viewer in a trance as the screen turns black.  This beginning incites the audience participation as the film definitely requires a high level of cognitive participation, unlike most films made where the story is driven by the scripted dialogue.  Zentropa becomes a visual and aural journey that mesmerizes the audience in a highly artistic manner.

Comparisons have been made with David Lynch's Eraserhead (1977), Hitchcock's Notorious (1946), and the director Wim Wender's cinematic creations.  Despite the previous comparisons, Lars von Trier creates a unique cinematic experience that could be compared to an artistic and political journey into the aftermath of World War II.  Cities lay in ruin and people suffer from starvation as the artery, the railroads of Zentropa, of the recovering Europa continues its exploitation of the people as it carted off millions to a certain death in the Auschwitz, Buchenwald, and Dachau during the war.  This creates a tense Machiavellian atmosphere where fear, paranoia, and anxiety have a firm grip of the people.  This causes most people to alienate themselves from society.

The cinematic journey begins with German-American Leopold Kessler (Jean-Marc Barr) who departs United States after the end of World War II for Germany.  When Leopold arrives to the shattered Germany he is greeted by Uncle Kessler (Ernst-Hugo Jregrd) who gets him a job as a train conductor on one of the luxurious sleeping-cars of Zentropa.  Through work Leopold meet Katharina Hartmann (Barbara Sukowa), the daughter of the owner of Zentropa, with whom he falls in love.  However, Leopold's desire for Katharina drags him into a dangerous affair of terrorism, politics, friendship, and murder.

The pacifist Leopold tries to balance his life through abstention of politics, avoidance, not choosing sides, and minding his own business, which is also suggested by his Uncle Kessler.  However, no matter how hard Leopold tries to follow his own policy he is forced into situations where he must choose a side as it would otherwise have a catastrophic affect on the people for which he cares.  Eventually Leopold finds out the hard way that choices must be made based on his own conscious.

Lars von Trier plays with the visuals throughout the film as a painter would with a new innovative color that would revolutionize art forms.  The film is shot in black and white with occasional insertions of color, which enhances the cinematic importance of moment.  Von Trier also uses trick photography and double exposures in order to artistically magnify the shot, which creates personalized imprints in the audience's cinematic experience.  Ultimately, von Trier pushes the envelop as his message is decoded through his brilliant enigmatic tale of a broken Europe where unity is the sole answer for the continent.",1097107200,12,3100,5.213709677419355

501781,4,6302722551,"In his typical scattered narrative, von Trier crafts a hypnotic tale of an American in the post-WWII rubble of Germany, as he gets entangled with a stunning local woman. Problem is, the woman is revealed to have been a dangerous operative during the war with far-from-simple roots.
Sounds like a fairly comprehensible theme to wrap a thriller around, but no, not under the sly lens of von Trier! His screenplay copiously employs his characteristic symbolism, effortlessly morphing between black & white and technicolor, using double-exposures, backprojections, and some fascinating trick photography such as superimpositions.
The resulting murky, obscure atmosphere of psychological disorientation may lead a casual viewer to much the same frustrations as the film's protagonist -- of never quite finding a footing in the surrealistic, trancy goings-on.

501782,5,6302722551,"Zentropa is much more than a simple movie. The experience you feel when you are under the control of time in the railroad is a brilliant idea that slowly mesmerizes you in a nightmare of horror, passion and death. Lars von Triers built a story where the anguish, the shame, the memory, the werewolf, the loneliness create an evil atmosphere. The edition is unforgetable, the amazing sincronization between the black and white and color, gradually envolves us and make us descends to the unboreable state of tension And this situation is only generated in another film Midnight express . of Alan Parker.
Returning to Zentropa, the sense of guiltness surrounds to our american benefactor who initially seems to be in a redemption state . Every one of his achievements are governed by the ethic . But he doesn't realize how the circunstances slowly are engaging him to the gallow. The relationship between him and his uncle, the epic affair with Barbara Sukova, announces us a fate far away he planned it. The performances are superb. You don't find just a hole. The use of the old fashioned effects is a great tribute to the golden age of mude film. From Griffith to Stroheim through the german expressionism Murnau, Wiene and Lang.
The final sequences are so original,fascinating and so beautifully made , that at the end of film the plot permeates your soul and your psiquis several weeks after.
Triers made Breaking the waves and The element of crime, which define him as a brilliant storyteller , with a visual style like very few directors.
Triers belongs to that elite of directors who see upon their shoulders. Creator in the purest sense of the word.
Don't miss the opportunity of watching this movie. You'll appreciate it several times because it's impact will shock you every time you watch it.
This is a true milestone in the cinema story. Orson Welles wherever he is, will be smiling , because Triers is one of his remarkable descendents.",1082764800,3,1948,4.817910447761194

Try as he might, the American's attempts to be a understanding ""nice guy"" serve only to tighten the noose.  Yet to be passionate and follow one's beliefs wherever they lead is shown to lead to disaster as well.  We are doomed to go through the night of mass murder and war if we are to see the light of day.

7830129,4,6302722551,"Ultimate part of his European Trilogy, ""Europa"" is quite a work of art to look at. Indeed, with German expressionism, Nazi Aesthetic, Film Noir, and Hitchcockian references all melded together, ""Europa"" is the story of Leopold Kessler, an American who comes in Germany to work on the train Zentropa where his uncle works as Sleeping car Conductor. Hoping to help the fallen Germany while staying in a Neutral political position over the reality he lives in. An opinion that harms him for the worse as he encounters the path of the Hartmann family. Family whose name is in reference to Lars's biological father, Fritz Michael Hartmann. A man who never recognized Lars as his biological father and never had any influences in Lars's life and tastes. A man Lars uncovered the secret truth only when his mother Bente Host told him the existence on her deathbed that this man was his real father. Therefore, making a movie one of the first works where Lars dives in part of himself into his work, which he didn't do in Element of Crime or in Epidemic.
But also, this movie is a tragedy which condemns the taboos of World War II and its post-War period. The culture of silence, of lies, of collaboration, of despair, and of germanophobia that still plague Europe today. Whether from the Germans or the Americans. A movie whose opinion is that in the upcoming future of Europe, World War II will leave a deep scar over the world.

Also, it is a movie of visual and musical references that made Europa one of the most well-received among film critics. Which is understandable as many cinema references populate this film what unfortunately, lacks emotionality and human connection with the characters and with the audience. Making the movie hard to connect with as the technical wizardry of retro-projections, black-and-whites, and color film stocks turn Europa into ""a block of ice"" as Lars himself told Stellan Skarsgaard. A work so controlled in its presentation and control of its actors that there are no chances for mistakes that make the story more real. More human which is what Cocteau did with ""Beauty and the Beast"".

However, Europa has the merit of bringing out a talent that Lars would continue in his future films. Strong, determined, and brave female characters. Nothing to do with the sexist archetypes of American TV soap Operas where women think over Prince charming stereotypes and weddings that soon end up in divorces at the end of the season. Instead, Lars's women are strong invididuals with personal agendas and goals; in complete control of their lives and interests. One that Barbara Sukowa plays very well. As much as Udo Kier played her brother Lawrence, and Jean-Marc Barr for the role of Leopold Kessler.

Of the special features in this Criterion DVD, which I wish they could release in Blu-Ray, ""Europa"" offers a Danish commentary with Lars von Trier talking in a very pleasant and not pretentious way with his producer Peter Allbaek Jensen, another interview over the European Trilogy and its hypnotic thematic that, among others, unites the three films. And also a bonus feature where Lars's collaborators defend him as a very nice and kind human being who does movies that unfortunately upset pretentious and obnoxious people. Which I noticed straight away when Lars had his Antichrist Press Conference, first time I ever witnessed Lars von Trier behaving in public, and was shocked to see him treated with violence by the reporter from the Daily Mail; one of the most trashiest and filthiest British Newspaper that pollutes the crassest common denominator of the world. Making me therefore realize that most of the attacks on Lars come from the twisted minds of biased reporters and Lars's replies are just his chance for him to slap back at the stupidity of their questionning. Which occurred before as in one of the special features of this film we see Europa's welcome at the Cannes Film Festival. A film venue that for all its glamour and poshiness as the Elite of Film Festival, really harbors idiotic Reporters. People asking questions of which they already know the answer and treating Lars like they did since his first arrival with ""Element of Crime"". As a weirdo, a prankster, a fraud, and a manipulator. Though that latter definition would take bigger proportions with Breaking the Waves and Dancer in The Dark as they would start calling him other names like Misogynist.

As a whole, Europa made him receive the technical prize and the Jury's prize, award that would make him call Roman Polanski, head jury of that Festival, as ""The Midget""; in nod to his role in ChinaTown. Both in irony and in anger at not receiving the Golden Palm. A calling that I find well deserved; a lack of recognition that however maybe was for the better as had it not been for that, maybe Lars wouldn't have tried to push himself away from all his technical wizardry of his European trilogy and start what he would do next.
Movies centered around himself, his emotions, and his view of the world. Bovarist fables where he would display women as main characters.
Emotional work he would start doing with ""The Kingdom"", then his gorgeous and spectacular, and incomparable ""Breaking the Waves"".",1452384000,,5211,4.878103837471783
7830130,5,6302722551,"""You will now listen to my voice,"" intones Max von Sydow as the opening shot of railroad tracks slowly disappearing beneath a moving train leads us down the rabbit hole of ""Europa"". Lulled by the soothing voice of hypnotist/narrator von Sydow, we're suddenly conjoined with young Leopold Kessler, an American AWOL pacifist, who's seeking a second chance at redemption by helping Germany's defeated citizens at the end of World War II. With an impossible, demanding uncle supervising him, Kessler begins working as a night conductor for the Zentropa Railway, taking him from one bombed-out city to the next. Along the way, his naivete and pacificism gradually erode via his continued exposure to newfound connections. Lars von Trier's 1991 film (released in the U.S. as ""Zentropa"") could be construed as, more or less, a tarted up morality tale, a film noir married to European postmodernism, but it is, more than anything, an indictment of remaining neutral and passive in the face of evil and injustice. Death abounds in Europa, and as Kessler goes about his duties aboard the night train, he becomes involved with a gorgeously leonine German heiress and her nearly destitute family, a cagey U.S. army colonel and some initially innocuous German citizens with ulterior motives. Before he knows it, poor Kessler, the naif, is being played by both sides for all he's worth but his moral intertia prevents his realizing how deep a hole is being dug for him (although in his passivity, he's complicit, too, and not without blame).

It's a dark story, its nihilism kept in check by the calm steadiness of the unseen narrator; but, as photographed by cinematographer Henning Bendtsen, nihilism in the movies has seldom looked this ravishing. Though filmed in gorgeous black and white, vivid colors seep into the frame as blood flows from a severed artery, a bullet lies accusingly on the floor of a train car, a world-weary glamour girl infuses her drab surroundings with life by turning on her charms. Actors in the foreground sometimes play against oversized imagery projected on back screens, creating an extra layer of unreality that preys on young Kessler's mind (as well as the viewer's).  The villains in ""Europa"" are, ostensibly, the ""Werewolves"", the unrepentant Nazis who refuse to acknowledge that they've lost the war; their equally dangerous enemies string them up under cover of night, leaving their bodies swinging from light poles as the train passes through moonlit villages. However, there is no one innocent in ""Europa"", not even the children, (who are as capable of murder as their adult counterparts) and certainly not Kessler, whose maddening passivity foments the seeds of his own destruction. The Germany here is presented as a dark and dangerous place where no sunlight dares intrude. The mood and atmosphere seem to be authentic recreations but the ""Europa"" of the movie, with its crumbling, darkened ruins still belching fire and smoke, the shabbiness and desolation of even the most genteel households, seems like the very center of hell: a highly stylized, ultra-cinematic vision of hell, to be sure, but one which still recalls the horrors of a particular time and place in history. The most blatant horrors of the war (and the film) are briefly glimpsed when Kessler leaves the confines of the sleeping car and finds himself moving through a cattle car of emaciated concentration camp victims still clad in their striped uniforms, grim reminders of a past not yet dead, a past that eventually manages to drag Kessler, himself, down into a roiling river of rage and desperation that comes to late to save him.

Whats interesting about the acting in Europa is that it never feels intrusive, never interferes with the bigger picture that von Trier is focused on presenting. Jean-Marc Barr plays young Kessler with a bland niceness that is perfectly expressive of his pacifism; he also has the personality of a toaster oven and his overanxiousness to please his unbearable uncle is grating. When the light bulb finally does flash in his head, his pure deer-in-the-headlights panic is so genuine that you're tempted to feel sorry for him, even though hes been such a shlub through most of the film. As Kat, the films femme fatale, Barbara Sukowa overshadows Barr in every way: shes a lush, full-figured, shady dame with secrets and a foreign accent, befurred, bejeweled and sporting a sensuous mane of big hair that, in itself, could house a treasure trove of secret weapons. Warhol-staple and horror film standby, Udo Kier, does a nice turn as Kats insolent, gay brother, and Eddie Constantine (the famous Lemmy Caution, himself) proudly resurfaces as Colonel Harris, the American military man whos sharper than he lets on. By far, the most noxious character in the film is Uncle Kessler, who seems like he should be on hand for comedic relief but, as if to upend expectations, is truly a despicable, drunken thug with no redeemable (comic or otherwise) qualities. Jorgen Reenberg does an excellent job in bringing this amazingly unlikable character to life.

The general plot of ""Europa"" could have been lifted from a Hollywood noir potboiler from the fifties but in the hands of von Trier, it's potboiler elevated to high art; through his ingenious (and ruthless) manipulation of the audience as passive observer, unflinching assessment of recent history and audacious utilization of cinematic imagery, von Trier has left an indelible mark on movies that I don't think hes come close to matching since.",1441497600,2,5526,5.069230769230769
7830131,4,6302722551,"This film, finally and at last, makes sense, though in 1991 it is a strange way to celebrate the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany. But sense it makes because the splitting of Germany in two was the only way the West, the victors could deal with what was absolutely still alive and kicking, that is to say Nazism and the obligation for most Germans to go on being Nazis because they had been Nazis and now they felt guilty about being defeated Nazis in their minds as much as remorseful about not being victorious Nazis, and maybe never being able to be any day.

The film is so clear about that. There is no doubt, no question asked. Everyone agrees and we are shown what they were able to do. The only hope the Americans, the allies had, was to get some of the big wheels of the regime on their side because they were industrialists for example and they were needed and they could be bought, cleaned up with some false Jewish witnesses and then whitewashed innocent.

But the Nazis in 1945 were everywhere and they were holding everyone who were werewolves at night and human in the day time. A Jew could make you innocent but then you were the target of the underground Nazis because the Nazi party was not Hitler but was the upper class in Germany with the support of 90% of all Germans still in 1945. So you could buy one of them but you had to take him as far as the USA for his security. When you have said that, you have the film on your palm because there is nothing else to say. How did Germany survive? How did they deal with their past and their memory and their guilt? Thats not the question of the film. Thats the pedestal of the German statue and that pedestal is not mud or sand. It is concrete, pure stone, stainless steel.

The film though has another dimension that makes it absolutely effective this time not because it terrifies us, not because it could horrify us, certainly not because it might gross us out. It is effective because it frightens us to the point of making us wet and soil our pants like a little baby in the middle of the dark night. It frightens us because it is still what the Germans are. This guilt, this deeper layer of crime and enjoyment in that crime is still there even in the younger generations because it was kept alive by the Cold War, because it was kept alive by the division of Germany, because it was kept alive by both the western pro-American side and the eastern pro-Soviet side.

Worse even than that is the fact that the reunification was the best way to erase the past, to erase the guilt, to finally be German again, conquering, proud, above all and everyone else. The every symbol of that is not visible yet in 1991 because the East Germans had to climb a lot of steps to take over the political machinery of the Bundes Republik, but it only took something like twelve years or so. Lars von Trier in his frightening vision of what it was in 1945 is projecting it into what it was going to be in 2015. In seventy years the full fledged reunified bossy and domineering Germany was to come back and tell Europe this time what was good for them, the Europeans, maybe, the Germans for sure, and good for the world, the Germans of course, the Europeans maybe and the Americans, if they play it nice for German business.

Yet the film seems to suggest that some sacrifice will have to be made by the Nazi side of history, getting rid of some of their werewolves who could betray, getting rid of their too obvious and visible presence in the full light of day. They had to go underground and they had to dive and settle deep in the minds of people. And that is definitely a genial side of the film. The Nazis are mental and ideological and not an SS militia any more.

The film, from beginning to end, is led by a hypnotizer who tells the main character to go back to 1945 and then to jump to this place and this time, in chronological order. But this character is dead as we learn at the end. So who is that hypnotizer hypnotizing if not us and no one else but us. He is manipulating us into believing he is manipulating the character who is strutting on the screen in a makeshift German uniform whereas he is manipulating us and that is even more frightening than what I have said so far because we are the accomplices of this situation, the accessories of this criminal intention and project, of both the Americans who are trying to take control of the country, but also of the underground Nazis who are trying to save the independence of Germany from sheer humiliation and colonial enslavement.

Lars von Trier makes us feel guilty because we supported the splitting of Germany to keep that basically imperialistic country under control. And in 1991 when Germany reunified we started running away, escaping, fleeing in our minds because we understood that Germany was back and with a vengeance to take. Was he right? Was he wrong? Are we still mentally being chased and hunted by our fright and fear? Maybe yes, maybe no, I don't really know, or don't really want to know, but for sure we cannot ignore the question.

We can then wonder if this film is really representative of the Dogma 95 manifesto and The Vow of Chastity Lars von Trier and consorts signed and advocated for the cinema or at least their cinema, a sectarian minimalist approach of the fundamental means of communication, the central TV and cinema medium for which the message is the massage, the medium is the message that means the basically sacrilegious ritualistic enslavement of the mind to some cool feeling of comfort in front of images and messages that caress us comfortably where it feels nice and matters.

But the color frames now and then are absolutely unrealistic and they emphasize the moments when there is some emotion, some emotional dimension in the situation. That is not minimalist. This is direct intervention of the director on our vision. And the hypnotist is definitely a means to take the control of our minds, of our reflection, of our thinking. The film must be in color. Special lighting is not acceptable. So far three films, Element of Crime, Epipdemic and Europa, in black and white and the third one with a subtle play on color frames in the vast ocean of black and white pictures.

Temporal and geographical alienation are forbidden as if the hypnotist was not a way to play on temporal and geographical alienation, depravation, even traumatization. You can tell me that one-sided manifesto was written in 1995, four years after the third film, but it is then a denial of all they have done so far, and it is when Lars von Trier is finally coming to some convincing discourse that he edicts his pronouncement that tells us all that he has done so far has to be discarded and the audience who was starting to find some interest in all has it all wrong and there the director is a terrorist who tells the audience they can go get lost in some antipodean place somewhere on another planet.
