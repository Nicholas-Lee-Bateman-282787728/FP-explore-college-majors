8095672,5,B000C4JP4G,I have all of the american released dvd's for big country.  You do need a universal region free dvd player for this concert though.  Great footage of the band at it's peak.  If you are a big country fan it will be money well spent.,1273968000,,231,4.088888888888889
8095673,3,B000C4JP4G,"The first disc has a gig from 1986, which is great.  The band is tight and energetic.  The overall sound and visuals are excellent.
Tracklising: Wonderland / Fields Of Fire / Where The Rose Is Sown / Rain Dance / Remembrance Day / Just A Shadow / Steeltown / Look Away / Chance / The Teacher / In A Big Country / Inwards / Harvest Home / The Storm / Lost Patrol / Tracks Of My Tears.

The second disc is from 1991, and this is a better forgotten era.  This was right at the release of the truly horrible No Place Like Home album.  Mark Brzezicki left the drum seat, here replaced by Chris Bell, who is certainly a good drummer, but it's not the same band without Mark.  The band is also augmented by a keyboardist.  The mix starts out terribly, with We're Not In Kansas basically sounding like a synth song.  The guitars, which are far too clean, are mixed way too low.  It's really bizarre.  Also bizarre is how talkative Stuart is.  Anyway, the show is of interest for some rarely played songs - Winter Sky & Mannish Boy - and to see what a train wreck is.  Thankfully, within 2 years, Mark was back in the drum seat and, as evidenced on Without The Aid of A Safety Net DVD, they were once again a great live act up until the end.
