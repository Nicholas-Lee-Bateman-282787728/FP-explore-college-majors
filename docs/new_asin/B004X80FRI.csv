If you like Flight of the Conchords, the Young Ones, Drop the Dead Donkey or Goodness Gracious Me, then you will enjoy this typically British sitcom. I never buy DVDs, but I laughed so loud and so much when I watched the TV series that I was persuaded - and I laughed and laughed again when watching the DVD.",1348358400,,415,4.2
4492619,2,B004X80FRI,"Okay now before I get to the review I have a short story. I recently was going to try and move and get my own place. Once these dvds came in I was excited but decided not to watch them or open them until I was able to get them in my new place and as a celebration of my success I would watch one of my fav tv shows. Unfortunately I couldn't get the place and I was stuck at home. So today I got handed down a new tv stand and put it together so I decided to say screw that idea lets watch it today! I put in disk one and the dvd player starts to make a weird noise and the machine starts to shake, it got stuck on the don't pirate warning and froze while my dvd player just keep shaking. Now before I am told ""you live in the US this is a UK dvd it doesn't work on your device"" I will stop you there. When I ordered this I also ordered a dvd player that lets Americans watch dvds in UK format. Series 2 through 7 play just fine in that dvd player it's just that series one always freezes on that warning and the dvd player vibrates uncontrollably. I don't know what's going on but I can't watch series 1 I would hope the seller contacts me and tells me what they can do to make up for this because as things stand I can't watch series 2 through 7 that's just silly. As far as the delivery itself I can't complain. It came in on great timing.",1348272000,,1341,3.844765342960289

4492621,5,B004X80FRI,"Absolutely fabulous to see the boys (and girls) in the early years, and see how their characters have developed. Be aware that the DVD is only in Region 2, so that does not work in Aussie or NZ (Region 4) - unless you have a multi-region player as we do. Crazy that they still have the region restrictions on DVD, can understand the point now.
But anyway, these guys - actors, writers, producers, director...are geniuses. Our only hope is that they just keep producing this show. There's a lot of really 'unfunny' comedies out there, and it's truly ""marvellous, just marvellous"" as Mark would say...to come across one as clever as the Yes Minister's and Blackadder's of the world.",1322697600,2,680,4.722689075630252
4492622,5,B004X80FRI,Item arrived in a timely manner exactly as described. My boyfriend was extremely happy with the collection and it will be getting a lot of action in his DVD player. Would happily do business with this seller again!,1315872000,,214,4.657894736842105
4492623,5,B004X80FRI,"Excellent and original comedy.  Very easy to get sucked into.  Anyone in the US who liked what they saw during Mitchell and Webb's / Peep Show's brief American airing should send out for this one right away.

For those who don't already know, the series stars David Mitchell as Mark Corrigan, the anxiety ridden office drone, and Robert Webb as Jeremy Osborne, the wannabe pop-star without a propper job.  Mitchell and Webb's unique comedy style lends itself perfectly to Peep Show's absurd action.

Recurring supporting cast members include Olivia Colman as Sophie, Mark's co-worker and main love interest throughout most of the series, Matt King as Super Hans, the crack smoking small time musician Jeremy idolizes, and Paterson Joseph as Alan Johnson, Mark's boss and hero who hides his deeply rooted unhapiness behind bravado, selfishness, and eccentric business ideals (""Sickness is a sign of weakness"").

The only downside about Peep Show is that it cannot be played on a standard American Region I DVD player - you'll need a European or Multi-Regional DVD player.  For this I'd recommend a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PHILIPS-9-Multi-Region-Portable-DVD-Player-5-Hours-built-in-Long-Lasting-Battery-DIVX-XVID-AVI/dp/B003T10BGK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PHILIPS 9"" Multi Region Portable DVD Player 5 Hours built-in Long Lasting Battery, DIVX, XVID, AVI</a>.

Nothing boring about this series.  If you're looking to find something entertaining and original to watch you won't go wrong with Peep Show.  All 17 hours of it.",1313625600,12,1574,5.955555555555556
4492624,4,B004X80FRI,"love this show and i am glad i finally got it on dvd, but just to let people know it is missing 2 episodes from the first season. i belive episodes 5 and 7. i have no clue why they excluded these but i feel a bit cheated. i think Hulu still has this show on so if you buy the dvd set watch the missing episodes online so you don't miss anything.",1312502400,2,345,3.73972602739726
4492625,5,B004X80FRI,"I love them. They are so amazing.

Sadly, this set is not U.S. ready.

Check them out on Netflix - not Peep Show - but other one of their show's to get a taste.  That is their show, which was a sketch comedy show.  This one is more of a situation comedy.

All good.",1307836800,2,265,3.8333333333333335

8446404,5,B004X80FRI,"This is such a great ""uncomfortable humor"" sit-com.  The characters are relatable, funny, detestable, sympathetic, and hedonistic all at once.  Fans of british comedy and David Mitchell should definitely check it out.",1488672000,,217,5.75

8446406,5,B004X80FRI,"who says you can't teach an old amerikan about new english sit-coms ?

an english (NOT british!) friend recently introduced me to this series thinking i had at least heard o' it.  sadly i had not.  in fact, after only a couple o' episodes in i found myself wondering how that was even possible !

no matter how many 'comedies' i have subjected myself to over the years (too often tempted by the gratuitous over-use o' phrases such as, 'best ever', or, 'most something something o' all time'), outside o' a small handful, few have made any lasting impression on me.  yet now having witnessed Peep Show in it's entirety (save the final season currently being unleashed) i can honestly say that i have yet to witness another sit-com which can surpass the consistently brilliant - if not outright jarring - writing found here

although the use o' unsteady first-person camera angles could easily threaten to ruin even the best o' scripts, here it quickly becomes part o' the wonderfully unnerving fabric which only helps elevate this decidedly moreish series above 97% o' its peers.  add to that daring the sublime brilliance o' hearing the characters un-edited thoughts, some very cringe-inducing situations; and this series delivers consistently on nearly every front a comedy can (to include how to make modern history genuinely memorable !).  i simply cannot recommend this delightfully bizzare deconstruction o' life in south london enough.  if you are a fan o' comedy, and have a VERY small uncomfort zone, then this series should easily satisfy.  if the pilot fails to prick your interest then proceed no further, for it just goes wonderfully downhill from there

let's be honest, given the state o' things today, what with politics increasingly hurtling towards complete and utter irrelvance, and corporate malfeasance entering its nadir (or zenith - depending on your position on the corporate ladder), we need cathartic moments like this now more than ever; if only to remind us o' what it means to be a human being living in these turbulent times...........even amongst the fashionable ruins o' 'civilization'

i for one am in no particular hurry to reach what i'm sure will be a most satisfying conclusion to one o' the most genuinely offbeat series about a modern day odd-couple ever scripted.  alas, all good things must come to an end",1398297600,2,2345,4.951530612244898
8446407,5,B004X80FRI,"This show is really really great if you appreciate dry British humor.  The 1st person views are interesting and something that I wasn't used to seeing with American Television.  If you really like you could purchase this, but with the non-US format it sounds like way more trouble than it's worth.  Get a Netflix account, they've had the show on for a few years and currently have seasons 1-8.",1389312000,4,393,4.666666666666667
8446408,5,B004X80FRI,"The brilliance of this show can only be truly measured and appreciated by someone who's shared in the best friend/roommate experience. Friendships, especially those of the codependent variety, are ripe with laughter, anger, ambivalence, envy, thankfulness, and a multitude of other incalculable descriptors. The distinguishing factor that makes this show work so well is the perspective. Viewers are entreated with multidimensional orientations via the internal, personal dialogues of the main characters. From these positions, spectators can fully appreciate the hilarious dynamics of a dysfunctional friendship.

Mark Corrigan (David Mitchell) and Jeremy Usborne (Robert Webb) met while they were roommates at the fictitious Dartmouth University. It is at that moment that ""The El Dude Brothers"" were born.

Mark is a slightly below average-looking man with an above average IQ. He values structure, conformity, and regularity. He has a normal job and a degree in Business Studies, but his true passion can be found in History. His appreciation for historical facts and occurrences only helps to solidify his status as the resident dork. Aside from his love of History, Mark has romanticized the ideal of meeting and marrying the perfect woman. Here, we can see a readied dichotomy when compared to his longtime friend and roommate, Jeremy.

Jeremy is an above average-looking guy with a not so stellar IQ. He is the epitome of a consummate playboy. Blissfully meandering from one beautiful woman to the next, one can only wonder how Jeremy does it without cerebration or money. Generally jobless, Jeremy is disorganized, morally resistant, and sporadic; he is the antithesis of all things Mark.

More often than not, Jeremy seems to come out on top of things without ever trying. Mark, on the other hand, works hard, does the right thing and commonly ends up flat on his face. Not always, though. Sometimes Mark is rewarded for his sacrifices and diligence. Herein lies the comedy. When one friend begins to succeed (work, relationships, etc.), the other is there, by all outwardly appearances, to show their support. At the same time, their internal thoughts are often flush with feelings of jealousy and thoughts of sabotage.

Mark and Jeremy are best friends and love each other dearly. Their symbiotic, perhaps slightly unhealthy, relationship is hilarious to watch on the big screen. Perhaps it is because most of us can relate.",1378252800,,2436,5.284237726098191
8446409,5,B004X80FRI,There is no show better than this as far as comedy. I'm American and I wish this was broadcasted in the US. I caught it on Netflix by accident and so glad I did.

8446412,5,B004X80FRI,I think Peep Show is one of the greatest British TV series ever made.
