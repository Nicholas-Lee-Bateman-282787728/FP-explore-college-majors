8241347,1,B0011CVFL4,"When I first viewed these videos I really thought it was a joke!!!! This is a complete waste of time n especially $$$$... The filming is all shaky it makes u nauseous just to watch it...the videos were definitely not shot professionally it sounds like this so called master mechanic's wife is the videographer n the videos which were shot in the driveway of there home.... You can barely hear what he is explaining due to high volume of background noise from the zooming cars on the busy street they must live on..... There is little to no lighting other than the sun which makes a glare no lighting under the car hood or underneath the motor... This man claims to b a master mechanic but it seems as if he is more like a shade tree mechanic.... If u have all this knowledge n are trying to profit from it shouldn't u put out a product worth putting ur name n title on..... I have a true master mechanic n my family n he just laughed when I showed this low rate low budget product to him as he says if u earned the title n call urself a master mechanic wouldn't u have a mechanic shop with a real car lift n lighting to produce a video an work in?? it is kinda scary to think this guy is a master mechanic but has no shop to work out of makes u wonder if he really is a master mechanic n if he is really qualified to teach anyone how to work on a vehicle u could end up messing ur vehicle up rather than fixing it....don't get me wrong the premiss of the video is a great idea n would b helpful to a consumer if it was produced professionally in a real auto shop an u could actually hear n see what was going on.... This man has no personality n is very monotone n he is definitely not engaging... The mechanic does nothing to draw u in or make the videos interesting if u can even watch it long enuf without getting nauseous u would see that the only interesting thing that happens is him getting annoyed multiple times with his videographer/wife for not filming the way he wants and at one point him yelling ""CUT that's it"" I mean u think they could of edited there arguing out.... The videos r a real waste of money n time unless u want to listen to a monotone, seemingly unintelligent, not interesting n very vague description of HOW TO .... Bob Villa this guy is definitely not....  DO NOT WASTE UR$$$ 0(zero) stars if I could",1377216000,2,2331,4.18
8241348,1,B0011CVFL4,"First of all ALL VIDEOS ARE FROM THE EARLY TO MID 1990'S!

I own five DVD's of this guy's mechanic how to series. Every single thing the previous review is 100% TRUE! I ordered from his website (Jason Varnums). The cases for the DVD's look better than the content. You can't hear ANYTHING when he is outside because of traffic, his wife is the camera operator. One HUGE annoyance is he cuts the camera in the middle of a sentence! For example he actually says, ""The next step in replacing""... thats it. CUT! There is pretty much zero lighting used under the car. I have seen better Youtube.com videos of teenagers! If you could give a ""Zero"" star rating it would get it by far!",1318291200,2,677,4.416
8241349,1,B0011CVFL4,"This is a home garage produced video with an old or cheap camera under very poor lighting. The camera man or woman was apparently inexperienced, even with the basic timing of zoom in and out. The home garage is located right by a busy street. You cannot hear clearly what the guy was saying because of the loud traffic noise in the background. I was totally disappointed with the video, and had to quit watching after only five minutes. A complete waste of money.",1286841600,4,463,4.523809523809524
