8637525,5,B00HZMZ2MC,I never heard of the second movie. I had purchased this for Loose Cannons. Sometimes you just need that movie to show your friends (or kids) what the heck you're talking about. Endless laughs to be held from a great pair of actors. Dan Ackroid suffers from PTSD and maintains over 200+ personas in his breakdowns while solving the Alice in Wonderland crimes.,1454803200,,358,4.698412698412699
