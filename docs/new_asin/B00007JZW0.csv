7977090,5,B00007JZW0,"Fuma's father has been mortally wounded by Nataku. He tells Fuma that he is ""Kamui's twin star"". upon hearing this message, Fuma begins to act strange around Kamui. Kamui senses this and begins to worry about the old friend that he is beginning to draw closer to once again. Meanwhile, Sorata and Arashi search for Subaru, another member of the Dragons of Heaven. Subaru is confronted by an old friend, who also killed his sister 6 years ago.

This is an excellent series. It has action, drama, and suspense. The animation, plot, voice acting, and soundtrack are all excellent. There are also lots of great characters and plot twists. I try to be objective and think of just 1 bad thing to say about this series, but I can't. This is an all around incredible story. CLAMP has done it again! This is a must see for every anime fan.",1355184000,,830,4.533333333333333
7977091,5,B00007JZW0,"thisis a great series for everyone. its not just one type of genre but most of them rolled in to one great package :) this is the tv series not to be mixed up with the movie (wich was pretty but empty).

if you like this series i recomend code gease (also from clamp like X) and i recomend chaos head, and tokyo babylon (the prequal to x).",1235174400,,339,3.985294117647059
7977092,5,B00007JZW0,"The outline that follows is an outline that refers to the entire series and spoilers will be included.

To begin with, if you are looking for an anime that is more in the style of Love Hina, than you should skip this one. If on the other hand, you are looking for an anime that is powerful, emotional, has love/romance, great character development and strong story, than you are definitely right here.

Outline of the story:

The story resolves around the Seven guardians of Heaven and the Seven guardians of Earth. The one group wants to preserve earth as it, believes in humanity no matter what they have done to earth, and hope for a better future. The other group wants to erase humanity from the face of earth so that the planet and its other creatures can life in peace etc.

The `problem' is that when watching the show you will - like it or not - agree with both groups (not to mention the fact that there is no `black - white answer' but a grey version (You will have to watch it in order to understand or otherwise I will give the entire show away, sorry guys)). Apart from it, the age of the group members does not matter much; meaning that you will see in both groups' teenagers and adults fighting side-by-side or against each other till death. Others will fight against the other group for their own personal reasons.

The biggest problem however is that there can be only one Kamui (chosen one) and the side he decides to follow will win; but, it proofs that the real Kamui has a twin star, meaning that there is another Kamui out there as well. This will lead to an explosive mixture of emotions. Lovers, who will belong to the opposing group, will be forced to fight till death against each other, brother against brother, best friend against best friend and so forth. To be honest, the story will get very emotional indeed. No matter the age, the group members will fight and die.

As for the action, you will get more than enough. To begin with, the fights occur in both astral plane and our materialistic world. In order to prevent damages in our world, the group members are able to form a kind of a shield, in which most fights happen, and no matter the destruction our reality remains unaltered. That is, if the fights remain inside the shield, something that will not always be the case. In addition, all group members have their own supernatural `super powers' etc. For instance, some can use the five elements, some others are psychics, some others use magic, some take advantage of technology, some bend reality etc.

Who will win in the end and what will be the cost of this destructive victory?

The genre of this anime could be categorized under: fantasy, supernatural, action, and love / romance.

The music that accompanies the show is very well orchestrated and good. Starts with a rock/pop song and ends up with a melancholic ballad. In-between the music changes in accordance with the shows (very good done).

As for the dub, in my humble opinion, it is very good and professional done, in the same level as CB is done.

The animation is excellent.

As for extras, it has more or less the typical stuff: Textless opening and ending, previews, trailers etc.

As for the box-set: The first DVD comes with the box and every DVD you buy it fits in there; imagine it something like a shelf.

As for the story: It is very emotional, has great character development, solid storyline (that moves forth and back, with flashbacks etc.), many twists and is very mature and character driven.

Tip: The first episode, called X-0, of the first DVD is like a prelude and `summation' of the story. If you don't want anything to be given to you in front but want to be glued to your sits from episode one, that skip this one.

Last but not least, is it worth buying or not? In two words: Definitely yes! However, by collecting all 8 volumes the cost may raise around $200. To be honest, it is worth having in your collection but if the cost might seem to you as an obstacle than try to rent it and to watch it.  The show is highly recommended!

I hope that I could help you, if so than please click on the yes button below ^_^",1156118400,2,4144,4.466225165562914
7977093,5,B00007JZW0,"X is a beautiful series, which seriously attempts to be an epic in a heartfelt manner (and I only say ""attempt"" because I'm an english major and have read the real epics).  X doesn't just show, it reads.  The viewer leaves every episode feeling fulfilled and craving more.  This DVD made me especially excited, however, because of the first serious appearence of Subaru-kun, the star of one of my favorite animes, Tokyo Babylon.  If you've gotten this far in the series, seriously consider purchasing Tokyo Babylon, to fully understand the tragedy of the encounters of Subaru-kun and Seshiro.  If you haven't seen X at all, what are you waiting for, silly?  Get Vol. One NOW!!! :)",1099872000,,680,4.818965517241379
7977094,5,B00007JZW0,"This volume is great. I would give it 6 stars if possible. I think it is the best of all the volumes at this point. It talks about Satsuki's past and how she found out she was a Dragon of Earth. Fuma's father tells him that he is Kamui's twin star. Fuma then has a vision of the two of them fighting, and then Kamui killing Kotori. Kamui has a cool, exciting fight with a Dragon of Earth, Seishiro Sakurazuka. Fuma steps in and saves them both and Seishiro vanishes. Sorata and Arashi go searching for Subaru Sumeragi, one of the Dragons of Heaven, but Seishiro finds him first and the two have an intense battle. Seishiro leaves during the middle of the fight and Subaru then meets up with Sorata and Arashi. Subaru and Seishiro are my favorite X Characters, and their battle made this volume the greatest. Buy it, it's amazing.",1058140800,,829,4.42483660130719
7977095,4,B00007JZW0,"This DVD is just another DVD of a great series. The DVD X [One] blew me away and I immediately bought this DVD as well. This was almost a let-down. It's not a shot at the series, but to the people who are organizing these DVDs for American release. I am seriously sick and tired of 3-episode DVDs. We all know they can put at least 5 episodes on one DVD and when they put 3, they're trying to scam more money from me. For our [item price] we at least deserve 4 episodes!
Great series, but these DVD's aren't really worth the money unless you're really into it. I can't justify [that much] to an episode.",1054684800,,603,4.162393162393163
7977096,4,B00007JZW0,"Well, this is gonna be breif....I am kinda dissapointed in the choppy animation ... and weird coloration... BUT I JUST LOVE THIS SHOW!!! I love X/1999 I kinda love the X movie and now I can have a moving version of the the book (of sorts). Too bad they sliced and diced the actual script of the book....and they twisted the characters around a bit....which I am deeply sadden by....But this installation of the DVDs kinda got me happy again. These are not filler epsidoes (I don't think any of them will be..thank the Dragons of Earth-ahem-Heaven) these are character insights from another point of view. I don't really like the director for twisting around the characters (Kotori) and plots....at all....BUT LO AND BEHOLD...SUBARU!!! This is a great insight (and eye candy) from Tokyo Babylon's Subaru Sumeragi. This is a really cool DVD cuz of him!! It really shows off Subaru's improvement from the Tokyo Babylon Subaru. That's all that I liked from X tv series so far though... I hope to see some keeping with the actual Clamp script soon....and the Dragon's of Earth are not evil!!! They just have a diffrent view on things!!!",1050624000,,1131,4.775510204081633
7977097,5,B00007JZW0,"In much of these three episodes, director Yoshiaki Kawajiri explores the human dimensions of his characters and their histories.  But, do not be mislead into thinking that, since the focus is on character development, the stories are slowly paced.  Entirely the opposite is true.  Pacing is excellent, moving from intense dueling scenes to elegiac memories.  Nor are there no sharp edges in the remembrance of things past.  Unlike the film, which paid only the most minimal lip service to internal dialog, the series allows the story to develop in its own time.  The result is a whole vision of the progress of the story instead of a fragmentary whirlwind.
'Cyber' is a character study of one of the coldest of the Dragons.  In a set of flashbacks played against an effort to capture her, we are introduced to Satsuki Yatouji - computer genius and Dragon of Earth.  This episode is interesting in how much it finds to say about Satsuki, unlike the film, which made her out to be a pure villain.  Instead, we find a lonely person who finds the world inside a machine far preferable to the boring and messy life of us humans.
'Gemini' opens with a short glimpse of Karen Kasumi, a Christian of many contradictions and Dragon of Heaven.  Then comes the revelation of the identity of Kamui's twin star, or opposite, who is prophesied to be the balance to Kamui.  Two destinies, one ending.
'Onmyou' introduces Subaru Sumeragi, leader of the Onmyouji, Japan's Yin-Yang masters.  His opposite is assassin Seishiro Sakurazuka, who killed Subaru's twin sister, Hokuto.  Many of the themes and characters developed have strong ties to Japan's underlying Shinto faith.  The ideas of polarity and balance pervade this series, playing in almost every relationship.",1047945600,3,1752,4.955479452054795
7977098,4,B00007JZW0,"X #3 starts right where #2 left off.  The Dragons of Heaven and Earth are still assembling to get ready for the final showdown and the battle for Earth.
This is really cool series.  It's got a lot of what I like: epic plot, lots of characters, and some cool fighting.  The animation is magnificent -- it's hard to believe that this is a T.V. show and not a big budget movie and the music is quite good as well. This disc covers 3 more episodes and basically serves to introduce more characters as the two sides start staffing up so they can fight it out. In terms of plot, having seen the series in its entirety already, things really start to heat up once the seven warriors (on each side) get together which happens in another disc or two.  For now, be content with episodes focus on the individual characters and their background and motivations.
I would have given this disc 5 stars if it had four or five episodes instead of three and some extras (there really isn't any).
Overall, I'd highly recommend this series.",1044316800,5,1020,4.438502673796791
7977099,5,B00007JZW0,"X is by far one of the best animes in existence today. The animation is beautiful, the story is consuming. Anyone who watches the series can not help but be obsessed with it. This is the third dvd of the series, and it is a major stepping stone in the series. With the introduction to new characters (like Subaru, my favorite!), it takes the series to new heights and after this DVD the next ones will only be better! Trust me!",1040601600,,427,4.283950617283951
