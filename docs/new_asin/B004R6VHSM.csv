4458345,4,B004R6VHSM,"If you are looking for a movie with strippers that also has a good story and good acting, Sweet Karma is for you.  I also recommend this movie to people that are tired of the same old Hollywood movies. Sweet Karma is like a blend of the movies Eyes Wide Shut and Taken.",1336780800,6,269,4.0754716981132075
4458346,5,B004R6VHSM,"Sweet Karma is one of those movies that has a certain ambiance; it sets the mood for the viewer as soon as it comes on. This movies takes you all the way through Karma's killing spree and search to find out about her sister and who was responsible for her sister's death. The movie does an excellent job showing how close the two sisters were and how much they loved each other. This movie was not predicable to me. It served up the best twist in the end.

I always find that independent films and lower budget films have the best story lines and they know how to execute them well. If you like action and a little bit of mystery along with your suspense Sweet Karma is provocative eye candy that won't let you down.",1325721600,5,716,4.264705882352941
4458347,3,B004R6VHSM,"""Sweet Karma"" is a pretty 'sweet' little vengeance flik with a female protagonst dishing out the 'instant' karmic retribution to the bad guys.  The plot premise is simple: a lovely, mute Russian girl (named Karma) goes on a vindictive killing spree after her sister disappears in Canada, apparently the victim of a Russian mafia white sex slave ring.  While this concept is certainly not original the film manages to insert enough twists and turns to keep it fresh and intriguing right up to the 'surprise' ending.
From a 'sexploitational' perspective (if that's what U R looking for), the 'white slavery' aspect allows for plenty of scenes of humiliating degradation and nudity as Karma follows a group of girls who have recently been duped (like her sister) into believing that they are heading for 'honest' jobs in N. America only to find themselves being forced to become strippers and hookers to pay back their criminal 'sponsors'. Karma is not portrayed as any sort of highly trained killing machine - rather she comes off as a determined individual who takes advantage of the moment to wreak her vengeance. The lead character's voiceless condition undoubtedly helps the film's tone as the actress doesn't have to worry about flubbing her lines and can concentrate on looking good - which she does pretty effortlessly.  All in all I found this to be an enjoyable watch featuring interesting characters, decent scripting & photography, and a gorgeous leading lady. Worth a look!",1315699200,2,1483,5.044897959183674
4458348,5,B004R6VHSM,"I found the movie highly entertaining and engaging.  I think the poor camera quality (whether intentional or not) ADDS to the realism.  As a matter of fact, it was the overall realism of the movie that attracted me to it.  The acting by the lead was amazing even though she didn't say a single word.  The plot was not at all predictable.  Sure, she is taking revenge, but how she goes about it and how not everything turns out perfectly is what made it unpredictable.  Some say that this plot has been done to death - that is probably true, but since I haven't watched that many movies of this type, then it is new to me.  The look into the sex slave trade is also quite important.  The movie is VERY graphic and raw.  It has a well deserved R rating.  Not only for the rape scenes but for the blood and violence - this is not a movie I would recommend for the faint of heart.",1315180800,6,876,4.160714285714286
4458349,2,B004R6VHSM,"This is a lower budget revenge flick with just not enough going for it.

Here's the scoop. A Russian crime syndicate imports girls to Toronto for the sex trade but the girls think they are going to perform maintenance duties. Some disappear and the mute sister of one of the disappearees is headed for Toronto to do in all the bad guys.

The schtick here is that you have a pretty, shapely, mute girl doing the violence. Other than that there is not much new. She weedles her way into various places and situations involving the traffickers and, when the time is right, does her thing. Only one of the kills has any degree of cleverness to it so don't expect anything to tickle your grey matter. There is one twist in the plot near the end that is both interesting and ironic but it's not enough to redeem this unremarkable movie. Most of the acting is not very good. The production values are lacking. One of the cameras had a lens that was either dirty or pitted. In either case it was a distraction. The sound editing and mixing was OK but nothing notable. There was a reasonable amount of nude female flesh on display and my guess is the producers figured this would get them in the door. I guess it did because here it is.

It doesn't hurt to watch this movie, and it clocks in at just under 90 minutes so it won't tax your time, but unless you need to see every revenge flick ever made you won't hurt yourself by giving this a pass.",1312416000,5,1438,4.318518518518519
4458350,4,B004R6VHSM,"This popular festival runner from a couple years ago finally makes the DVD slate here, albeit in below average clarity, but it still has the rawness to pull off a 3.5 rating.

Cookie cutter story about the avenging sister of a human trafficking victim who met a bad end coming from Russia to the Canadian underworld. But several writing and casting risks give this a notch above some of the genre hits: Our heroine is mute and she contains the hotness and feminine characteristics without being cheesy. Shera Bechard has been in nothing - yet she pulls off a raw potrayal here filling all the needs to make this watchable: very hot yet not over the top throughout the whole movie (similar in abuse and circumstance to Rapace's performances in the GWTDT trilogy).

The picture quality is average to horrible through most of the film. Since the majority of the story happens indoors and/or at night the results are either meant to look this bad or instead adds the element of being ""real"" (handhelds, low lighting, etc.) The sound is equivalent and they added absolutely no special features. English language only, no region coding listed. Normally I would rate a disc of this quality and bareness as a 3 or lower, but her performance puts it back up. For those that have asked about the rating regarding the rape scene, it is graphic in the sense of how the man's member meets a demise and does run a bit too long overall.",1307836800,4,1421,4.634920634920635

The atmospheric production values contribute to the overall mood of the piece.  And I thought the main plot twist, no spoilers, was cathartic.

4458502,3,B004R6VHSM,"Above average exploitation flick about a mute Russian girl who infiltrates the illegal Toronto sex trade to avenge the death of her sister.  You've seen the set-up before in movies both serious and unsavory--some poor, naive girl from Eastern Europe or sometimes Asia thinks she is signing up to be a singer or dancer or club hostess or house cleaner in another country but is instead sold into prostitution.  Sweet Karma puts a light spin on the premise as the title heroine's sister has already fallen prey to these people.  Karma comes to Toronto and is given some clues by a former coworker--the picture of a hotel where they were kept, a package of strip club matches and a newspaper clipping about the unidentified dead body of a girl that was apparently her sister.  Karma wants revenge since her beloved sister was the only family she had.

Sweet Karma lacks the graphic sex and over-the-top violence of Thriller--A Cruel Picture (a classic slice of Swedish ultra-nastiness from the 1970's), the hypocritical sleaze of the I Spit On Your Grave films which offer extended rape scenes for the sexual gratification of viewers who are into that sort of thing before the victims are allowed to take their appropriately gruesome revenge or the baroque style of Ms. 45 which transcends the genre altogether to become a fever dream work of art.  (The fact that Karma is mute might be a nod to Ms 45).

But Sweet Karma is a respectable attempt at the revenge genre that's never quite as exciting as it could have been but also remains compulsively watchable, largely for the novelty of its approach to the otherwise familiar material.  Who doesn't want to see these slime-balls receive the fate they so richly deserve at the hands of the appropriately named Karma?  Sure a little more flair and energy would have been nice but if you like revenge flicks Sweet Karma is worth a look.",1438300800,3,1881,4.763076923076923

8438720,4,B004R6VHSM,"This movie turned out to be good out of nowhere! It was a little convoluted at first, but once itgot through its odd way of telling the backstory, this film's narrative was off to the races -and won. This has a bit of thriller aspects to it, but plays more like a high-stakes action film. All the components to make a scary, nail-biting thriller were there, but I believe the director specifically decided not to go that route.
There is very little nudity in this film. The one sec scene has no nudity and is a rape which makes it very hard to watch.
Everything else is just above-par acting and storyline which keeps you invested in the narrative.
I got to the end and thought ""wow, this was actually a good movie."" Be warned, though, the ending is pretty unsatisfying. The hero both wins and completely loses at the same time. She could have at least found love, but not even that works out.
All together it's a shaky start movie that's a fun, riveting ride with a surprising ending which if fine, but they don't make up for the heroine's kids by giving her a win in another way.

Yes a lot of shooting, stabbing, tire iron to the head etc...however, again it is a part of the story as in Godfather way.
Karma is not a super hero, Kung Fu martial artist, or weapons expert however, she is hot, Russian, and in very real way shuts down multiple Russian gangsters... in a believable way.
I did enjoy the nudity, and was able to cheer her on.
Shera Bechard is now on my list of super hot actresses who can actually act.
If you are male, and love women, and like criminal action drama... if you don't watch this you need to hand in your man card.
If I could find a women who looks like this, and refuses to talk I might, I say might want to marry again.
