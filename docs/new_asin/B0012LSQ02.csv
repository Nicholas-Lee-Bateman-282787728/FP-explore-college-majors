3092226,5,B0012LSQ02,"Come Away Home is a wonderful family movie that everyone should see.  It combines a great cast that has an incredible synergy with a warm storyline, to make for a very enjoyable family viewing experience.

Unfortunately there are not to many films that you can watch as a family these days, but this is one of them.  Great scenery on picturesque Hilton Head Island and heartwarming performances by Paul Dooley, Jordan Claire-Green and Gregg Russell all work together to make this a ""must see"" movie.

3092249,2,B0012LSQ02,"This movie attempts to follow a familiar story line:  an annoying young girl from a big city is sent to the boonies to spend the summer with a relative.  In this rural setting she becomes less annoying, and finally actually lovable.  Usually a horse plays a part in this transformation.  There is no horse in this movie and the girl remains annoying for a long long time after she gets to the country.  When her doddering Grandpa enters his bathroom and accidentally sees the girl wrapped in a towel, she screams at him.  When he averts his gaze and retreats, she screams at him to come back and close the door.  When the poor old guy comes back, she screams at him again.  Later, she falls out of a motorboat, trashes around screaming until finally she sinks underwater and loses consciousness.  When she comes to, she screams at the guy who saved her.  By that time I was sort of disappointed that she hadn't drowned.  Eventually she does get less annoying, but for me the transformation took much too long.  I usually enjoy ""family"" type movies, even the sappy ones, even the really corny ones.  But I could not enjoy this film.  For that reason I gave it two stars.",1365465600,2,1169,4.504761904761905

Yet in the end the family talks out the issues and of course finds common ground.

3092252,4,B0012LSQ02,This is a great family movie about generational relationships and how important family is no matter what has happened in the past. It was nice to watch a movie that didn't have any bad language in it that I can remember. This is a good movie for pre-teens and teens to watch.,1301616000,3,275,4.3076923076923075
3092253,5,B0012LSQ02,"I really enjoyed ""Come Away Home."" The mother's worry wort, yet bossy, uncaring attitude toward her daughter makes the women seem extremely selfish and totally pathetic. The girl's father is no better. Who would take a vacation, even a so called second honeymoon and leave their daughter with her Grandpa, an older man she doesn't even know, all the while planning to put him a retirement home? The Grandpa is a whole different story. His love for his granddaughter shines through the whole movie. Also the granddaughter's ever increasing maturity and thinking of sweet ways to bless those she loves, such as getting help to fix up her Grandfather's rundown home are all very touching.",1268265600,8,685,4.965217391304348

3092256,2,B0012LSQ02,"The movie had a good message overall, but I didn't care much for the girl's bad attitude and independence.  I think it set a bad example for girls her age.  Her mother seemed to just abandon her and I thought that was strange.  With 2 girls ages 8 and 13, I am always trying to find films that really show innocence in pre-teen girls.  I guess maybe that doesn't exist these days.  I also did not care for the teenage romance in the film, these kids are just WAY too young to be worrying about the opposite sex and this movie encourages that in my opinion.

Pretty good acting, but we won't be watching it again anytime soon, in fact we might just get rid of it.",1260230400,4,662,4.173228346456693

Better than Britney and the pop tarts, but not as thrilling.  The message is not too strong, but is there, and the not very good sappy ending shakes an otherwise good movie.  But it was fun to watch a young person think her way out of a tough situation, and add to the world, not just take from it.

3092265,3,B0012LSQ02,"This movie has its moments, but there is more to regret than to like in this effort.

The first third of the movie is a washout with four unprepossessing characters not relating to each other.  The second third picks up occasionally, and the last third is better.

But the movie looks like the work of someone just learning to write a screenplay.  New characters seem to be made up as we go along and thrown in to prop up a sagging story.

The big plus, of course, is Lea Thompson, but she is only on for a few short bursts and plays a less-than-sympathetic character.

The big minus is the preteen girl--and she's the central character.  She seems incapable of producing any but one face.  This wax, expressionless face is worn in every scene and in every situation.  On a scale of 1 to 10, her acting is 0.  She seemed to have an amused detachment from the movie as though she found the whole thing, like, you know, too much.

There are some touching moments toward the end as characters begin to get it together.  I had no problem with them, but others might find them unconvincing.",1202688000,7,1085,4.424242424242424

In short, too much is just not believable and theater isn't much fun without being able to buy in. If all someone has ever seen is ""Feature Films for Families"" or something, maybe this can squeak by with some redeeming points here and there, but if anyone over the age of 10 has had any exposure to professional film or stage, this is a bit embarrassing to endure.
