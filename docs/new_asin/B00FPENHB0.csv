6016625,1,B00FPENHB0,All amazing matches but there missing Dean Ambrose vs Undertaker on Smackdown April 26th 2013 and there missing Damien Sandows cash in on John Cena and why was this set not made on Blu Ray? I came on Amazon to buy the Blu Ray since Raw & Smackdown have been saying it's on Blu Ray & DVD but now it's only on DVD looks like I'm not buying this amazing set it's a shame really that WWE does not make Blu Rays for good sets like these they want less money that's fine by me.,1392508800,3,471,3.968421052631579
6016626,1,B00FPENHB0,"i already pre ordered it 2 weeks ago but only after it the full card was released and after i saw the matches i understand the WWE just s***ing on us the fans this list of matches is a joke. this is the worst ""best of RAW & SD"" of all time and specifically in an year with so much great TV matches, most of this matches are not here cause the WWE decided that we have more interest in pure garbage like santino cesaro and kingston fandango. where the hell is cena sandow from RAW? christian RVD orton from SD? so many great matches not even here and jokes like santino cesaro and kingston fandango are here.

as a loyal fan of this business that bought many DVD'S in the last few months this is the most disappointing DVD of all time and maybe if i knew the card before i bought this i didn't even want to buy this s***",1389571200,,819,4.055555555555555
6016627,3,B00FPENHB0,Okay there should be different matches on here. Like get red of Kofi versus Fandango. Add undertaker versus dean Ambrose. add Damian's cashing in. Add Christian versus RVD versus Randy Orton. Add paul Heyman versus Mr.mcmahon. Add different matches that the Wwe universe would like more than those matches like Kofi and Fandango and Antonio versus Santio and Chris Jericho versus Curtis. They should of had Big E versus Curtis instead of that.,1389139200,,443,5.082191780821918

Our Favorite Moments

The time is here when WWE once again picks the best moments and matches from the year and releases them on DVD to give to the fans. While this DVD is jam packed with some memorable moments from 2013, they once again left out memorable moments and matches that should've been featured on the set but aren't. Kind of like the last 2 Best of Raw and Smackdown DVDs they did. A few matches that should've been present on this set were: Dean Ambrose vs The Undertaker, Kane and CM Punk's No Holds Barred match, Chris Jericho vs RVD, any Bryan vs Rollins matches, Damien Sandow's cash in on John Cena, and the 8 Man Tag Team match between CM Punk, Daniel Bryan, and The Usos against The Wyatt Family and The Shield. Like honestly, why are matches like Santino vs Cesaro and Fandango vs Kofi Kingston even on here?? Those weren't memorable matches

A few moments that should've been included are the tribute video they aired for Paul Bearer, followed by the opening segment with The Undertaker and CM Punk, The Wyatt Family's debut, AJ revealing herself as Kaitlyn's secret admirer, the segment between CM Punk and Paul Heyman, the night after Heyman turned on Punk, John Cena choosing Daniel Bryan as his SummerSlam opponent, and so many more. While this DVD does contain a few remarkable matches and moments from 2013, it robs fans of the plethora of the lasting, historical matches and moments that truly made 2013 in WWE. Raw and Smackdown need to just go back to having their own separate DVDs for the ""Best Of"" series because whoever is picking these matches and moments is doing a bad job at it. Nonetheless, I only recommend picking up this DVD if you want to add it to your collection or there are highlights on here that spark your interest enough to buy it",1389052800,11,4016,4.654727793696275

8617627,4,B00FPENHB0,"Josh Mathews once again host this set showcasing various matches from the past year of both of WWE's flagship shows (RAW & SmackDown) along with various moments including The Rock's verbal battle with C.M. Punk, the confrontation between Paul Heyman & Mr. McMahon, The Rock & John Cena face to face, C.M. Punk disrespecting the memory of Paul Bearer, Brock Lesnar invading WWE headquarters, Mark Henry's retirement speech, Alberto Del Rio's championship celebration, the contract signing between A.J. Lee & Kaitlin, the debut of The Wyatt Family, Damien Sandow looking for his stolen Money In The Bank briefcase, MizTV with John Cena & Daniel Bryan, Big Show confronts The Shield, and the WWE World Heavyweight Championship ascension ceremony.  It should also be noted that the Blu-Ray edition is not available in the United States due to the low sales of the previous editions.

Matches Include:
T.L.C. Match: WWE Champion C.M. Punk vs. Ryback - Ryback came out very dominate with using his superior strength causing Punk to resort to using the weapons right away to get the advantage only for Ryback to fight fire with fire leading to such moments as steel steps & the announce table also coming into play during the match, the chair used for shots to the body or just launched at the opponent, bodies going through tables more than once along with a ladder resulting in it being broken, and one wrestler having the lights turned out on him...literally.  It's no secret that Ryback was being pushed as the next Ultimate Warrior/Goldberg where he was (and in many ways still is) a one dimensional power wrestler getting the heavy push despite being very green so this type of match was the best environment to play to his strengths while Punk did the best he could with who he was with.
""RAW"" Jan. 7

Last Man Standing Match: World Champion Big Show vs. Alberto Del Rio - Show showcased his superior size & power advantage early easily shoving & knocking Del Rio down with his massive chops before Del Rio attempted to break Show down either through wrestling like a sleeper or using a weapon such a chair or both having a domino effect as they traded momentum with both men taking some hard hits such as a putting one man through the barricade, using the steel steps including having one man's face sandwiched with the steel steps & ring post, and one man having the tables turned on him...literally.  In what was setup to be a ""David vs. Goliath"" match turned out to be a real physical match with neither man holding back when it came to the weapons & ringside environment used for or against them.
""SmackDown"" Jan. 11

John Cena vs. C.M. Punk - The winner of this match would go on to to face The Rock for the WWE Championship at WrestleMania XXIX as both men started off exchanging exchanges & didn't stop from there as this was a match that had both men going back & forth with momentum non-stop in regards to either grounded offense such as the front facelock & side headlock to submissions like the Anaconda Vice & STF to impactful moves such as the suicide dive & piledriver to their signature moves of the Attitude Adjustment & Go To Sleep as Cena was trying to work a faster pace pulling out moves that we rarely or haven't seen from him before while Punk was more slow & methodical targeting Cena's neck including one move that is so dangerous that it's shortened & ended careers in the past. Punk & Cena just have this natural chemistry with each other bringing out some of their best performances in their WWE careers with this being no exception.
""RAW"" Feb. 25
[History Of WWE: 50 Years Of Sports Entertainment]

Alberto Del Rio vs. Jack Swagger & Zeb Colter - Rio started out being aggressive such a suicide dive that sent Swagger over the announce table before it took Colter getting involved to get the advantage with Swagger heavily working over the leg & ankle as both men traded momentum working over the specific body parts for their trademark submissions.  This was a glorified rematch from WrestleMania the night before as Zeb didn't really get involved in the match & was a solid match but it was mostly about setting up the aftermath where the one guy the crowd was chanting for ""cashed in.""
""RAW"" Apr. 8

Kofi Kingston vs. Fandango - This wasn't much of a match as they were just feeling each other out before a man who had his issues with Fandango made his presence known but this match was more significant for the crowd inventing what would go on to be known as ""Fandangoing.""
""RAW"" Apr. 8

Sheamus & Randy Orton vs. Mark Henry & Big Show - This started out with both Show & Sheamus renewing their old rivalry exchanging strikes including the forearm blows to the chest against the ropes before Show & Henry were able to dominate with their power such as a side slam & bearhug while isolating their opponent from their partner keeping him grounded while Orton was trying to ""hit & move"" countering offense in their own such as a DDT on more than occasion & Sheamus fighting using his own strength & power.
""SmackDown"" Apr. 19

Undertaker & Team Hell No vs. The Shield - The Brothers Of Destruction reunited here with Daniel Bryan & being very dominate from Kane's strikes to Bryan's various kicks along with Undertaker going ""old school"" while isolating one member of the team away from his partners including one of Bryan's clotheslines turning Seth Rollins inside out before The Shield was able to regain control using the same strategy of keeping one opponent away from his partners using the numbers to their advantage with double & triple teaming keeping them grounded on the floor.  This was a fun back & forth six man tag match with the highlight being Undertaker's first match on RAW in 3 years.
""RAW"" Apr. 22

Chris Jericho vs. Curtis Axel - Paul Heyman was on commentary here as Jericho took control early with this trademark offense while getting a little more aggressive than usual banging his head off the announce table but Axel was get the advantage back working over the head & neck as both men traded momentum throughout the contest being able to counter & avoid some of their trademark offense.  This was a nice competitive match between both men.
""SmackDown"" June 7

Street Fight Match: Daniel Bryan vs. Randy Orton - This was their fourth match against each other in a week span as both men started off trading first right away in & out of the ring using whatever was around them including Orton using a weapon to his advantage to not only block Bryan's running at him on more than one occasion while Bryan took advantage of his surroundings as both men went back & forth from trading fist to kendo stick shots to putting each other through tables to the unique counters to their offense & submissions.  While this ""weak link"" storyline would be lost & overshadowed by their later series over the WWE Championship, this was one of the best & most physical matches they had against each other all year.
""RAW"" June 24

Rob Van Dam vs. Randy Orton - RVD used his educated feet to keep knocking Orton down along with his trademark spinning legdrop off the apron onto the barricade to take control before Orton was able catch RVD & use the barricade to his benefit keeping RVD grounded as both men traded momentum with RVD continuing to use his educated feet & going aerial while Orton was able to keep catching RVD in the middle of his high risk offense delivering some impactful moves of his own.  This was a good competitive match with RVD working a fast paced high risk offense while Orton's was slow & methodical.
""SmackDown"" Aug. 9

Santino Marella vs. Antonio Cesaro - This was Santino's return after a long absence but a dominate showcasing for Cesaro's in-ring ability including what I believe was the first time we saw what would be his trademark ""giant swing"" that definitely got the crowd's attention.
""RAW"" Sept. 9

Daniel Bryan, Cody Rhodes, Goldust vs. The Shield - Triple H was at ringside as the team of Bryan & the Rhodes were always able to stay one step ahead when a distraction allowed The Shield to take over singling out & working over one member of the opposite team keeping them in their corner before things started getting so out of control in & out of the ring that a decision had to be made that would result in more than one person being knocked out.
""RAW"" Oct. 7

No Disqualification Match: WWE Tag Team Champions The Shield vs. Cody Rhodes & Goldust - A rematch from the previous ""Battleground"" PPV where the Rhodes won their jobs back with Cody & Goldust starting out in control causing The Shield to resort to double teaming & isolating each member away from their partner while keeping them grounded with Ambrose taking advantage of the ""no disqualification"" stipulation to add the numbers game in their favor only for the Rhodes to use an equalizer to even the odds with the action picking up not just in the ring but outside with the ringside area not only used but destroyed with bodies knocked out all over the place.  This was a great tag team match that went back & forth with the ""No DQ"" stipulation not really coming into play until the end.
""RAW"" Oct. 14

John Cena, Cody Rhodes, Goldust vs. Damien Sandow & Real Americans - This started off in a brawl but did calm down into a normal match with Goldust taking control & even taking out two opponents at once only for Sandow & the Americans to take back control keeping one member in their corner working him over with double & triple teaming while taking advantage of the rules & distracting the referee before eventually broke down with one big move hit after another.
""SmackDown"" Nov. 1

C.M. Punk & Daniel Bryan vs. The Shield - Punk & Bryan took control with through either submissions or aerial assault before The Shield was able to take advantage of a distraction to keep one member down & away from his partner with double teaming tactics only for Punk & Bryan to use the same strategy against them only for others who had their issues with those involved in the match made their presence known leading to a big verbal & physical debate that can be summarized in the phrase, ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend...or my enemy?""
""RAW"" Nov. 11

(Blu-Ray) Steel Cage Match: John Cena vs. Dolph Ziggler - Dolph attempted to escape right away only for Cena to stop him right away as Dolph was able to take advantage of the environment using the cage whenever he was on offense or defense to escape when possible while Cena not only had to fight Dolph in the ring but Big E & A.J. Lee on the outside preventing him from escaping as they continued to trade momentum escaping their opponents signature moves while delivering their own continuing to use the cage along with whatever else they could to their advantage in what was not only Dolph's first cage match but also the main event for the main event of the 20th Anniversary of RAW.
""RAW"" Jan. 14

(Blu-Ray) Intercontinental Champion Wade Barrett vs. Chris Jericho vs. The Miz - This was ""every man for himself"" early on as all three men interacted with each other with various sequences where one avoided an opponent only for execute a move on the other while there were other some other moments such as one man attempting to steal pins & capitalize on other's work along with each man at one point having the strategy of ""divide & conquer"" with all three men continuing to have similar strategy such as using their own signature maneuver just to break up their opponent's & all three continuing to interact with each other in a non-stop action packed match.
""RAW"" Mar. 18

(Blu-Ray) Kane, Daniel Bryan, Kofi Kingston vs. The Shield - All of these men faced each other in different matches the previous night at the Extreme Rules PPV as each team attempted to utilize the same strategy of singling out one of their opposition playing to their individual strengths from diverse wrestling skills to power & athletic ability keeping in their half of the ring in a solid back & forth encounter.
""RAW"" May 20

(Blu-Ray) Christian vs. Alberto Del Rio - Rio came out aggressive early taking the fight right to him focusing on a specific area of the body shoving off his offense only for Christian to be get aggressive himself sending Rio over the announce table & taking advantage of Rio's showboating when possible as both men took advantage of their ringside environment & countering each other taking risk that didn't pay off as Rio continued to rely on his strong kicks & Christian with an aerial assault in a competitive encounter that was a preview for their upcoming World Championship match at SummerSlam.
""SmackDown"" Aug. 9

(Blu-Ray) Intercontinental Champion Curtis Axel vs. Big E. Langston - Big E used his superior strength early on causing Axel to use the strategy of grounding him to neutralize him only for Big E to come back with more explosive power offense in a quick contest that was about strictly about showcasing the Big E that hadn't been seen since his time on NXT.
""RAW"" Nov. 18

There wasn't much room for every single standout or relevant match on each show to be put on here but there's always certain matches that could have easily been left out in favor of those that didn't make the cut as they didn't have any real relevance to be put on a ""Best Of"" set but overall they did a better job on this one than last years & have some of the best quality TV matches & moments on here so I would still check it out if your a fan of the TV product.",1392768000,4,13459,4.595833333333333
