8488207,1,B000KQGNPU,"Hi.  Is this a real movie?  I looked on the imdb website, and it doesn't seem to be real.  Are all of you people fooling with my head?  That would not be funny.  What colleges did this film play at?  Are these reviews all fakes and plants?  If so, that is not fair to me.  Please just tell me the truth.  Praise the Lord.",1211241600,3,321,3.890625
8488208,4,B000KQGNPU,"There is more moviemaking ability in this low budget but charming feature comedy than in all of Steven Spielberg's films together. As a female, I did not find myself laughing at all the jokes that my male classmates found so fall-off-the-chair amusing during a recent college screening but I was very moved by the relationship between Paul and Allie. Cynical and flippant as Paul tries to come across, he clearly cares deeply about his handicapped friend. And actor Alan Werksman as Allie is sensational, both funny and warm. Rounding out the cast is the golden-voiced Erik Bergmann who is excellent as the bully. I must agree with other viewers that this film is incredibly well conceived, written and edited. Writer-director Paul Edward Yalen is hugely talented and the fact that he also edited and musically scored the film is impressive.

The songs are wonderful. I had to give this film only four stars instead of five, because it doesn't have Paul Dano in it, but hopefully Paul Edward Yalen will earn a bigger budget for his next film and correct this one defect. To sum up, ""Prep Boys"" is a significant, smart and humorous film that I will view often.",1167350400,2,1159,4.795
8488209,5,B000KQGNPU,"It isn't often that a low budget film gets my thumbs up but ""Prep Boys"" has earned it. This is an extremely cleverly conceived feature length comedy that has a lot of big laughs, truly unique characters, and terrific original music. The writer-director (and editor, composer and star) is Paul Edward Yalen. I remember him from when he was Paul Edwards, a singer-songwriter, some time back.

Yalen has designed a storyline that has to be at least partly autobiographical about a failed rock star who is now reduced to laboring with his childhood, brain-damaged best friend as a ""prep boy"" at a used car lot, where he quixotically plots his comeback. The dialogue between these two had me rolling on the floor with laughter but their close friendship is also genuinely touching. You won't find gaudy special effects in this movie and in fact it appears to have been shot on a combination of 16mm film and video but Yalen makes a virtue of this in a way I won't reveal here. It's very, very clever. I also enjoyed the special appearances by Jay Leno and Eliza Dushku, both of which are hilarious. This is not a movie for everyone, but if you appreciate originality, laughs, memorable characters and great music, I would definitely recommend it.",1164844800,2,1241,4.74537037037037
