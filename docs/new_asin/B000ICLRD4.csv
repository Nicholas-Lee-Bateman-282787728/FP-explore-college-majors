8144837,4,B000ICLRD4,"Truly requires a knowledge of the battle and unit types from the Napoleonic era, much of the film rattles locations and unit names and types off in rapid fire succession. It can be followed but is difficult. Enjoyed the filmed scenes as they are from a patriotic Russian film I believe.",1461715200,,286,4.627450980392157
8144838,1,B000ICLRD4,"Boring and all over the place and the ending was boring and left you empty. Either the film was translated badly or it's just a real looser,",1450656000,,140,4.222222222222222

8144840,5,B000ICLRD4,I can't think of a a better documentary on an historical subject ever made. A college course on Napoleon on one DVD!  A wonder how such a thing could be done. Tres Magnifique. Indulge your intellect.,1428624000,2,199,4.527777777777778
8144841,3,B000ICLRD4,"The image quality and production values are very poor, resembling 1950s television. But, the historical value is interesting.",1428278400,,125,6.0
