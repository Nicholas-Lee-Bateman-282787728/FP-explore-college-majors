8579994,5,B00CBNV7HY,"I love disaster movies, buy them all the time.  I wasn't sure of this one, but I got to tell you, this will keep you awake.  No sleeping with this one.  One of the points that I really appreciated was the way they had set up the computer monitors in the command center.  You'll have to watch it yourself to see what I mean.  Have fun.",1401235200,3,334,4.0
8579995,2,B00CBNV7HY,"I enjoy disaster movies and B movies.  This made-for-tv movie is just about what you would expect from a disaster movie; underdog main character, evil military man, world in peril.  This would have earned 3 stars but for the hero's girlfriend.  She is belittling, unsupportive, needy, and you just can't wait to see her taken out by the extreme weather.  I'm not sure what the writers and the director was looking for but she brings the movie down an entire star by herself.  Of course the ending doesn't make you love the hero any better.  Instead of feeling inspired and good that the world was saved you feel the hero sold out and prefers to live a shallow, cheesy life instead of using his skills for the betterment of mankind.  Worth watching if you are a die hard disaster movie fan.",1375142400,2,789,4.553191489361702
