4127866,5,B003IODND6,This is a great DVD highlighting Prince's career in the 1980's. He is a musical Icon and everything about him is amazing. Prince has brought so much to the music industry.,1386979200,,171,4.548387096774194
4127867,3,B003IODND6,"I was a bit disappointed Bcause I also bought 'Prince: The Glory Years - A Documentary Review' & 'Prince: In  the 1980's is the EXACT SAME DVD as above right down to the picture on the DVD (same as Glory years picture), & contents! So basically I paid twice for the same DVD! It would've been nice to know before spending the money!",1372809600,21,332,4.26984126984127
4127868,5,B003IODND6,Nice sound .wish it was blue ray not long enough..I am huge huge huge fan of prince... Love love it,1353888000,,99,4.0
4127869,4,B003IODND6,"The title says it all! ""Prince: In The 1980's"" is a better than average documentary on ""The Artist Who Will Always Be Prince"". Entertaining and informative to be sure, but honestly ""Prince: In The 1980's"" is the exact same documentary as ""Prince: The Glory Years"". The only difference between the two is the title and the cover photograph. If you are a Prince fan, either of the two documentaries would be good to have for your Prince collection...I guess it would depend on which cover photo you like the best. I chose ""Prince: In The 1980's""....I admire the brother's talent and style, but the cover photo on ""Prince: The Glory Years"" is just a little too flamboyant for my taste.",1307318400,18,682,4.691666666666666
4127870,2,B003IODND6,"if you think you will see footage from his glory years think again it's a bunch of people that used to work with him in the past recalling their experiences with him no significant performance footage is shown, a waste of time.",1283731200,38,227,4.428571428571429
4127871,4,B003IODND6,"I found this DVD to be quite interesting (I had not seen the Glory Years or The Document). People from his past gave candid and insightful input on what they observed about His Purple Highness during their time with him. The only two drawbacks for me were that (1) the product description indicates that interviews with Prince are included--this is not true; (2) with the exception of about four contributors, the people interviewed were only able to give snippets of their experiences with Prince, mainly due to the fact that they did not work with him that long. Again, this is with the exception of about four contributors. People like Alan Leeds were obviously able to contribute a more circumspective view point to the conversation. I also enjoyed the interactive trivia game, though I wish they could have included more questions. The information on the contributors is a plus as well. All-in-all, I did enjoy the documentary, and I'm glad that I added it to my Prince collection. I look forward to someone doing a documentary on his post 1980s work. However, I am sure this would be even more difficult given the gag-order he has on people working with him now, and the fact that he has sole authority to release/approve information on any post-Warner Bros. projects.",1282780800,31,1274,4.848623853211009
4127872,3,B003IODND6,"While this is a good program, do not buy both this and ""Prince: The Glory Years"" or the ""Prince: Live Documents"" CD/DVD set. The DVDs are all the same video.",1466294400,,157,4.266666666666667

4127878,2,B003IODND6,"Fair but skimpy documentary about Prince and his music from the 80's, mainly from the persepctive of aging music producers (and no actual interview footage with Prince.) There's some interesting background here but nothing spectacular.",1417478400,3,235,5.742857142857143
4127879,4,B003IODND6,Fine DVD.  Insights on Prince's musical career from some of those who were a part of the whole ride.,1414713600,,100,4.2631578947368425

4127881,5,B003IODND6,This dvd is excellent. It never seems to amaze me about how amazing an artist Prince really is. This type of God given talent only comes once in a lifetime.,1399334400,3,156,4.233333333333333
8397594,5,B003IODND6,Arrived Safe,1527897600,,12,5.5
8397595,2,B003IODND6,"Much of this information can be seen in other DVDs and in a more organized way. This project comes across like something that's been repackaged. A better documentary about Prince, particularly his business practices, is the 2014 documentary, Slave Trade. Highly recommend it.",1516060800,,275,5.4186046511627906
