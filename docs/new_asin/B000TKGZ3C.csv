8210157,4,B000TKGZ3C,"This is a really, really underrated and practically (as far as I can tell) unknown film, and more's the pity.

Franco Nero, as the titular hero, Banovic Strahinja, is - as he nearly always is - terrific as the conflicted, tormented nobleman whose castle is invaded in his absence by Turks, who abduct his bride and do away with various retainers in all sorts of unsavory manners. (One especially disturbing scene has a man drawn and quartered by four horses and simultaneously decapitated - very convincingly, too.)

There's also an especially gut-churning scene as we see what impalement actually meant in Eastern Europe (and elsewhere, I would assume) when a man has a forearm-diameter pointed timber inserted in his, er, nether regions and then is made to slowly, agonizing slide down it under the weight of his own skewered body. *gack!*

But this isn't just a chainmail-&-sword gore-fest. No, there's a tender but sad romance at the heart of the story, between Nero and his young bride (lovely Sanja Vejnovic) who, while abducted, does not put up enough of a fight against her Turkish captors to satisfy an unremitting tradition that declares death is better than rape, especially at the hands of an infidel.

Worth tracking down if one is in the mood for a realistic medieval drama (spiced with gore, nudity and swordfights).",1273968000,,1331,4.928571428571429
