2648026,3,B000HXDWH8,It is surely not an american film but it was different and a love triangle so I watched. I would watch again.,1210204800,,109,4.0
2648027,4,B000HXDWH8,Completely enjoyed Daniel Craig's performance The storyline holds your interest with a twist for the solution of the question asked  I would recommend this movie very highly,1186099200,,173,5.407407407407407
2648028,5,B000HXDWH8,"I got the movie mostly because of Daniel Craig but it was a good movie, the ending was slightly disappointing but overall worth the time to watch.",1179532800,,146,4.444444444444445
2648029,2,B000HXDWH8,"Take good looking actors, add an incoherent script, throw in a handful of picturesque Euro locations and you have ""Obsession"". This film is recommended only for those who wish to have a complete Daniel Craig collection, albeit a bizarre addition to the library.

This film's worst offense is that it is boring, deadly dull despite a capable cast. The story is riddled with jaw dropping inconsistencies and the kind of stupidity one associates with Lifetime movies. For instance, Daniel Craig's character is supposedly from Zimbabwe, yet his accent is from Kansas not Rhodesia. WTF? Even DiCaprio was able to carry off a credible Rhodie accent in Blood Diamond.

If you simply must own every movie that Daniel Craig ever made then this will be $6.99 well spent. Otherwise, give this film a wide berth and in the unlikely event that you are invited over to a friend's house to watch this insult to your intelligence then you would be well advised to fabricate any excuse, however farfetched, to avoid wasting 110 minutes of your life.",1178496000,,1032,4.8914285714285715
2648030,3,B000HXDWH8,"... but a scenario that takes too many turns, and the story finally gets lost. I must say the beginning is intriguing and there are some very goods scenes and parts but the whole is disjointed and you don't quite get the point of the entire film. The jacket says that Craig's character is obsessed by his grandmother's death. I wouldn't call that ""obsession"". He is just trying to make sense of events that took place in his youth and were quite ""intense."" It makes sense. He is investigating his own past; I don't find that obsessive. The title ""obsession"" probably refers to the extreme passion he and another man - French actor Charles Berling whose character I found truly boring and bland in comparison to Craig's white Zimbabwean intense personality - have for a woman. She may be wonderful and beautiful and all; it still does not seem quite believable that two intelligent and powerful guys get themselves taken for a ride by her, like they do for quite a long (waaaayyyy too long in the movie, that's where it looses the attention of the viewer) period of time... I don't get it.

The annoying part is that the movie had amazing components and characters at the beginning but the script handles them all so poorly that interest in the story gets lost.

I loved the story of the man from Zimbabwe and the picture of the tightropers and how he'd like to see their faces to understand more...

I loved how he meets the woman, how he helped out the old man chased by the police and the bond that was created between them from then on. I loved the two old men in their tailor / puppet shop. Also the music element that is brought by the woman character (very good Heike Makatsch)is interesting but is not handled well. There are a million good ideas in this movie, and they seem to all get lost in a pathetic story of a love triangle and a woman's love - and whims - for two very different men... Yawn, yawn, yawn.

There are also some loose ends (why does the old man steal?) that are a little irritating.

Anyway, very good performances by all; Daniel Craig's fans should enjoy his acting tremendously, he is perfect.",1174089600,,2123,4.489637305699482
2648031,4,B000HXDWH8,"This movie promises much but delivers a product that does not do the actors justice. It suffers from a disjointed script and is way too ambitious in trying to cover the scope of true obsession. I did not get to grips with the charactors as deeply as I would have had hoped and despite a stirling job from Daniel Craig and Heike Matkatch they seem to wander around in a dream at times.

Obsession in itself is a highly charged emotion and there are some good scenes throughout this movie but ultimately this film suffered in the editing room and it's a real shame. I enjoyed it but not at the deeper level I was looking for. Also I didn't get the ending. You are left wondering what happened. did they all live together?

Great performances from all the actors involved but as for the director - could do better",1169078400,,810,4.3933333333333335

8142224,3,B000HXDWH8,"An OK movie.

The performances are a bit light.  Just an easy bit of entertainment.  Does not demand too much of the viewer.",1382659200,,124,4.304347826086956

8142226,2,B000HXDWH8,I really can't give this movie a full review because it was so boring. Someday when I have more time I'll have to try and watch it again. Get this only if you can find it cheap or if you're a huge Daniel Craig fan and want to complete your collection.,1363910400,,251,3.9411764705882355
8142227,1,B000HXDWH8,"The greatest thing about this film is the color of Daniel Craig's eyes. Otherwise it is a painful melange of too many stories, too many coincidences, and horrible music (soul-less Euro-club?), especially during a love scene on a train, when DC disrobes and to the radio playing an embarrassing and bland ""I want to make love to you all night long.""

The character he plays is pathetic and it doesn't fit with the charisma he naturally exudes.  Never sure why two men are so distraught over the love interest--it frustrated me to see so much wasted emotion and supposedly sensitive dialog about feelings. Both men could do better than what we see of the female character and it's hard to understand why they are so smitten. She seems silly, vacant, and capricious. OK, she's cute but not really passion-inspiring, therefore I couldn't buy into the great obsession these two men carry on for her. And therefore, their love seemed exaggerated.

What I learned from this film is that even a superbly sexy actor, such as Craig, can play an emotionally weak puppy very well. But it's a useless exercise when the script is clueless and a waste of talent and all you can take away is, ""This film was a frustrating, silly exploration of what was done 1,000 times better in 'Jules and Jim,' so many years ago."" It could have been fascinating new exploration of 2 men and 1 woman, especially with the excellent actors in the cast, and that is also why I am so disappointed.",1306800000,,1462,4.658914728682171
8142228,3,B000HXDWH8,"Watch it if you love one of the actors, otherwise this story makes little sense.  The actors do a great job, but the disjointed editing leaves the viewer wondering what is going on most of the time and, ultimately, there is little or no resolution to the movie.",1250553600,,261,4.4375
8142229,2,B000HXDWH8,"(For a much more interesting flick with a young Daniel Craig you should try&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Rage/dp/B000060MWB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love & Rage</a>&nbsp;with Greta Scacci).

If you're a serious Daniel Craig fan you might buy it to see him, but there is no other reason I'd recommend this one.  He's only on the screen for about 1/3 of the entire movie.  This movie is mostly about the female lead, Miriam, and her ability to string along two otherwise intelligent men for no reason that I can really see.  When both men realize she is romantically ""double-dipping"" and they confront her, she simply shrugs and says, ""I love you.  And I love you.  And seeing you both made you both happy.""  This is delivered with so little emotion or charm that I would have thought both men would have walked out on her.

Also, don't assume the ""Obsession"" of the title is a romantic one...the ""obsession"" in the title refers to Daniel Craig's character's search for the identity of a man in an old photograph...a man who may very well be his biological grandfather.

If you're a Daniel Craig fan & you're curious, then $6.99 is a pretty cheap buy.  But don't bother with this one for a plot.",1211932800,,1246,5.063725490196078
