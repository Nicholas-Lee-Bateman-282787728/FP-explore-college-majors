8103367,3,B000E0OBNI,"This is a set of 4 entertaining westerns.  While I enjoyed the films, I was severely disappointed when discovering that all 4 films are re-issues.  I expected more from Lion's Gate than maybe just cleaning them up a little.  The two RKO features, West of the Pecos and Nevada, were TV re-issues by C&C TV Corp. with beginning and ending titles changed.  Other than that, these 2 features looked pretty good and were complete.  The 2 Paramount films were re-issues by Favorite Films with beginning and ending titles changed.  Wagon Wheels was complete and also looked good.  Fighting Caravans looked good but was also missing a good 10 minutes of footage since the original running time is 92 min.  The Zane Grey special feature is pretty good and worthwhile, but all 4 discs use the same special feature.  In fact, the special features are the same on ALL their other Zane Grey releases.  All these issues have made me quite reluctant to acquire any more of these.  The retail price of these is ridiculous compared to the edited and re-issued films you are getting.  I doubt that these versions are the only ones that exist.  If they were, I could forgive it.",1241827200,19,1159,4.678217821782178
