8346381,4,B001VH7A3G,"This is a filmed lecture by a student of the collapse of the USSR which examines american social and economic trends that could lead to the accelerated relative decline of american power and considerable internal disruption over the next five to ten years.  The lecture is presented in a low-key manner with touches of dry and mordant humor.  Orlov is not apocalyptic in his views; he views the issues presented in an evolutionary way.  Orlov basically views the US as having a twenty to thirty year cushion over the USSR for a variety of geographical, economic, and social reasons.  He points out some key differences between the nations' very different circumstances in undergoing collapse:  different resource bases, demography, gun ownership rates, and energy generation systems.  Watching this dvd is a very good way to jumpstart thinking about the future of the USA and changes that will probably occur over the next decade.",1257465600,14,930,5.0855263157894735
