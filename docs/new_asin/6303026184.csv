7834310,5,6303026184,"Just thinking about this show puts a smile on my face. I remember, being little, and me and my big sister huddlingh together on the green leather couch and watching Ren & Stimpy, Rocko's Modern Life, Snick with All That, and the best of the best, Are You Afraid Of The Dark. I think back, and the scariest episodes still flicker around in the back of my head. I've mentioned this to my friends, and they have the exact same reaction. Everyone launches into a discussion of their favorite/scariest episode and laughs when others remember too. This was the best show in the history of Nick, and it makes me sad to think it's gone. Hold on to any memory of it you can, so you can tell your kids that we had some decent television, once upon a time.",1130284800,,745,4.328571428571428
7834311,5,6303026184,"I was ten when this show came out, and all I have to say is that to this day, no show has come close to being as great as this.  I would bargain with my father to let me stay up and watch all of Snick to make sure I wouldn't miss Are You Afraid of the Dark.  I just bought the DVD of 91 episodes on E-Bay, and I am in heaven all over again.  I get flooded with memories of old commercials, and the way life was.  This makes my heart ache with a longing for my childhood, but I am so grateful for the oppurtunity to experience this again.  I remember Halloween being so awesome because they would show more than one episode a night!  I also just picked up Salute Your Shorts from E Bay.  If you're reading this, then you probably remember that too.  God how I miss those days...",1117843200,,777,3.967741935483871
7834312,5,6303026184,"At 16 years old, I look back on this show and I realize exactly what everyone else has realized....where the hell did it go? This shoe was the epitome of what Nick used to be like, and I appologize for using the other reviewers sentence there, but I honestly cannot sum it up any better. When I look back on my childhood, I think of staying up with my friends watching this show and getting the crap scared out of us and sleeping with the lights on. I also remember the show ""Salute Your Shorts"" but thats a different time and a different place. I know that it's far off, but I honestly hope that Nick makes this show on DVD because not only would it be nice to have, I think it would be nice to show my kid someday and be like, ""Yeah, this is what real shows were like when I was little."" Not that SpongeBob Square Pants garbage that they have on now. And to be honest, I think I truly would watch the episodes in my freetime because they are that damn scary. I hope other former watchers and fans are out there reading this, cause we honestly need to petition cause I really would like to own this on DVD. E-mail me and let me know what you think-(...)",1114387200,,1154,4.133333333333334
7834313,4,6303026184,"I think Nick should at least consider running Are You Afraid of the Dark? on Noggin, then the younger generation of kids that weren't able to watch this show could have a chance to see for themselves that this show is timeless. Besides, what kid doesn't want to be afraid?

At the most I'd like to see a DVD set made. I'd more likely buy a set than a seperate episode, but I'd definitely recommend to any parent out there looking for a ""scary"" alternative for their children this VHS. I'm eighteen and I'd still watch this show if it was still on air, but maybe that's the nostalgia talking. Either way, take a chance and let your kid experience that slumber party where all the kids end up sleeping with the lights on.

This show is the epitome of what Nick use to be before it watered down and consisted of only mundane tv shows. At least Noggin is airing Clarissa, but still... why not Are You Afraid of the Dark? Bad move, Nick! Give us back our childhood!",1109980800,,960,4.3277777777777775
