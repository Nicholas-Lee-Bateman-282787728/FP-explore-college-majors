8503910,3,B006T5GTJQ,"A cool collection with some of the best but in most cases fighting with second rate competition. To me it was worth what I paid and it's from the days of real wrestling before it admitted it was just entertainment. I have better wrestling DVD's but it belongs in anyones collection who appreciate that time in wrestling history.

8503911,1,B006T5GTJQ,"I've been a wrestling fan since i was 8 years old and have collected a good many of the videos. With the names listed on the details (Ox Baker, Dick The Bruiser, Mil Mascaras to name a few) I thought this would be a really good buy. Just the opposite. This is nothing but a bunch of second rate TV matches of big stars against studio nobodies with bad video quality. Not worth a dime.",1351728000,,384,4.133333333333334
8503912,5,B006T5GTJQ,"Watched this 2-3 times already. This is a great DVD with quality. 20 matches and stars in everyone. I was told this is the first in a series of several to come. Best of Southwest is next. VCI did a great cover, and the design is top notch. Ox Baker on the cover is the 1970's. It's also nice to see a legal copy of top quality wrestling, unlike ""I  Offer "" and ""Ebay"" who allow anyone to sell copies of these fine matches. If you love old wrestling purchase this DVD. For one reason only, its Great!!! and support the cause as well. Soupy",1335139200,9,538,4.123809523809523
