7971400,5,B00006L7Q4,I bought thisd after picking up the box a few times in my video store.  I had wanted to check it out for a while but the sole copy was always out when ever i'd pop in.  I figured i would take a 13 buck chance since the extras seemed even more interesting then the movie to be quite honest.  I just finished watching this and what i did not count on was just how great the actual film would be!  What the hell is the deal with this?!  Why was it not released in theatres?!?!?!?!  Was it?!?!?!?!  If so i wish i had heard since i haven't laughed [so] much since.....well - since i saw Clerks for the first time.  Not that this is a Clerks clone as it seems at first.  There is actually a lot more going on here and it's all pulled off by the understated direction which makes you sort of feel like you;re actually there at this party evesdropping on these guys when they talk about stuff i didint think i;d ever see anywhere other then in my dreams.  Very cool extras for such an independent film. Definetly a bargin at this price.  Very glad i bought it - thanks.,1052438400,2,1062,4.106796116504855
7971401,1,B00006L7Q4,"Direction, jump cuts for the hell of it. I don't require a lot from a film but when someone uses a convention like a jump cut it's nice to know there's a reason, like different takes on the same subject from different perspectives, to demonstrate long winded arguments and move the film along. Not here though, more like, 'hey, let's do this, it's not expensive to do and art films do it all the time.' Beyond that, mostly uninteresting shots with a car camera that switches between two men discussing what it means to date. That would be fine except the shot has worked better in films like Clerks where there was almost no budget and was exceptionally well written which is the issue on hand.
Script. Was there a script? I hope not as much of the conversation seems improvised and not very well. Almost all the characters are annoying college boys on summer break guys that have fairly long speeches at times with nothing interesting to say.
Premise. Could have been good. Anyone who's familiar with post party behavior knows things have the potential to get wild. But here I felt like the majority of the characters were to self-involved or downright obnoxious to even have fun laughing at the few funny moments including the Coca Cola baseball scene.
Conclusion. If this is men being men then there should be a man school to teach these people what 20 somethings actually do in life. There was a lot of potential but some of the acting was...I'll be charitible and say not focused. Some characters seemed almost real but most seemed so self-obcessed that if you put the same film using women as the end of the night party staglers you wouldn't see much of a change in discussion.
Nothing offended me, the idea was sound and could have been funny. The characters are poorly written to outright obnoxious with no purpose other than to make insignificant plot points - what little plot there is. Beyond that, Four Letter Words doesn't know what kind of film it wants to be and neuters itself by trying to be two films.
In the end, it's about a bunch of uptight suburban kids with too much time on their hands and without the insight other filmmakers would have gotten out of the material, think Kevin Smith. Not worth seeing unless you want to see what your parents were like in the 80s. It's not even good for mindless viewing.",1052352000,,2329,4.5875299760191846
