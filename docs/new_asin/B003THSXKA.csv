4190391,4,B003THSXKA,"Another installment of warren miller. The movies over the last few years have all been a bit the same (kids doing jumps, heli skiing in alaska, steamboat and utah powder etc). I do think this was a bit of a change in this years flick as it showed more of a story on how people and their families fell in love with skiing. I do miss the narrations of warren miller though and a bit more 'fun' would be nice.",1289174400,4,406,4.0875
4190392,5,B003THSXKA,"A great new warren miller movie that goes over the last 60 years, and crazy new places.  Really enjoyed the segment where they were in remote China.  Beautifully edited and fun to watch on a 1080p projector.",1287705600,2,207,4.5675675675675675

8405091,5,B003THSXKA,"I have enjoyed Warren Miller productions for 40 years and this one didn't let me down. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing my local ski area where I am an instructor in this movie, Crystal Mountain Resort (skicrystal.com). If you are a snow sport enthusiast then get this movie.",1326412800,,270,4.76595744680851
8405092,4,B003THSXKA,"I am a huge Warren Miller fan.
I do miss him as a narrator and realize that Johnny Mosely is a better narrator then no movie at all!
Can't get enough!  Great music, great destinations, great everything.
Don't purchase thinking you are going to learn how to ski, that is not how these movies work....",1294185600,,299,4.4363636363636365
8405093,4,B003THSXKA,Dynasty has lots of big mountain skiing and great photography. But Jonny Moseley is not the narrator Warren Miller is.,1292198400,,118,4.95
