8130544,4,B000GBI79Y,"Director Mats Arehn shares his experiences onboard ships in this Swedish psychological drama Kocken (The Chef). Made in 2004/2005 the film is set in 1969 and we are introduced to 18 year old Martin von Lindh (Henrik Lundstrm) who sitting smoking on a train is recalling his adventures to and from Cape Town on board Snow Drift in the summer of 1969.  Martin is second chef to Head Chef Peter Stein (Kjell Bergqvist) a mid-40s fitness fanatic who seems to be overly-fatherly towards Martin but also has a violent temper often on display. Apprentice chef Sundsvall (Peter Viitanen) who Stein refuses to communicate with tries to reclaim his old friendship with Martin from a previous holiday.
Lundstrm shines in this film and the claustrophobic environment of the ship gives proceedings an extra level of psychological intensity. The trio arrive in Cape Town only to face tragedy. Back on board sailing back to Sweden we face a grim conclusion.
Part thriller filled with suspense and black comedy, Kocken is a decent film to watch. At just under two hours, the time seemed to fly by.",1316563200,,1081,4.875
