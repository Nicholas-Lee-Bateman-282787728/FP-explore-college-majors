I coaching a Battlebot team for the first time and what I was able to watch, give the kids a good insight their upcoming matches.",1328659200,,275,4.52
8471437,5,B005GAV8B4,"My 14 year old grandson loved it!  We watched this video together as a family:  Parents, boys and grandparents.  We thought it was interesting and age appropriate.  The boys and girls featured in the film are great role models for middle schoolers.  Our grandsons want to attend Robotics camp this summer.",1515456000,,305,4.901960784313726

8471439,5,B005GAV8B4,"I've been a follower of Battlebots (and the like) since before the show on Comedy Central first aired.  My fascination and intrigue mainly stemmed from the competitive aspect, but I was definitely drawn into the camaraderie between builders.  Seeing people's robots decimate each other is extremely entertaining, however, seeing rival engineers assist each other in times of dire need is what drove my interest.  These people build to kill, yet, they assist in the killing (sometimes of themselves).

The battle, conflict, and destruction is a huge (and main) draw for me.  The fact remains, that what goes on behind the scenes is (and can be) even more enticing than the fight itself.  This movie does a near perfect job at accentuating that fact.  I strongly recommend this film to any fan of robot combat.

They may only be in high school, but their knowledge and intuition is far beyond.",1364860800,,891,4.932885906040268
8471440,5,B005GAV8B4,"Bots High is the most entertaining documentary I've seen in a while. I went to school with some of the guys who are competing, and they are hilarious! Their robot is really cool and it is so fun to watch the robots battle it out! I am not the most tech-savvy person out there, but I still found Bots High extremely enjoyable. Definitely check it out!",1346976000,,350,4.318181818181818
8471441,5,B005GAV8B4,"OK, Full disclosure--I am in this show.  I know everyone in the documentary.  I also think that this review is STILL legit: you decide.
This has what I want most from a documentary.  It made me feel like, even with all my flaws, greatness is within reach.  This is a REAL story of high school kids doing REALLY COOL stuff.  It made me think again of how much more important process is over product--how it's more important to try than to succeed.  Also, robots catch fire!!",1331164800,,473,4.441860465116279
8471442,5,B005GAV8B4,"I think this seems like a great pilot for a tv series...it could be educational introducing the next generation to engineering and at the same time very entertaining. For me this video shows teenagers as they actually are: talented, funny, procratinators, warm, encouraging, and lovable. It gives me hope for our future if these will be some of the minds that shape it. Watch the movie and see what I mean.",1330300800,2,406,4.732394366197183
8471443,5,B005GAV8B4,"This is hands down one of the most engaging and true to life documentaries I have ever seen.  It's informative, enlightening, and hilarious.  Not only does it show the world of engineering and robotics, it demonstrates the extraordinary capabilities of  teenagers leading ordinary lives.  I recommend this film because it's a great watch (no matter how many times you see it) but it also goes to show what kids these days can do.",1330300800,3,429,4.835616438356165
8471444,5,B005GAV8B4,"This movie is a great story of life in high school, balancing emotions and activities. And, there's fighting robots thrown in to boot! Great cinematography. I would say that this is one of the best documentary's I've seen in regards to picture quality and attention to detail. Clearly, hundreds of hours were put into editing this film. Sound is great. Overall a fun movie to watch.",1330300800,3,382,4.803030303030303
8471445,5,B005GAV8B4,"Sometimes you think of a documentary as dry and simply informative. Not so in this case. It is very engaging as you get to watch all the characters in real life as they make it through a challenging time, juggling high school academics, robotics and teen age relationships. I loved it and my 32 year old niece who has never seen a robotics competition and not involved in the engineering world sat next to me and  thoroughly enjoyed it. It is appropriate for all ages and all levels of ""techno savvyness"".",1330300800,4,505,4.549450549450549
