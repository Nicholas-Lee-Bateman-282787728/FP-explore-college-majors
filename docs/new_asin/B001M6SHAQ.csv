8320666,2,B001M6SHAQ,"While season 2 part 1 of ""Shin Chan"" has some funny moments, they are few and far between and most of the show consists of filler and stupid/unfunny jokes. Don't get me wrong ""Shin Chan"" is a good, funny anime but season 2 of it sucks ass. IF you wish to watch ""Shin Chan,"" watch season 1 of it instead. Skip this crap. 2.5/10",1290297600,,326,4.109375
8320667,5,B001M6SHAQ,"The official Amazon review by Charles Solomon is the worst one I've ever read here and singularly inappropriate. Do yourself a favor and ignore it.  Solomon doesn't get it, with a vengeance.

EDIT:  Solomon's official Amazon review was  taken down.  Disregard.

Shin Chan is great fun.  I generally dislike precocious kids in TV and the movies, but this show's kid is innocent rather than cynically constructed to go for the cheapest laugh.  The laughs often come pretty hard in Shin Chan, as the little tyke frequently doesn't realize how bad his behavior is and seems as surprised at the results of it as we are.  He gets calculating here and there, but being a child he is often caught at it and can't seem to understand that the world doesn't work the way he thinks it should.  The absurdity of our world reveals itself more clearly to Shin Chan's post-toddler eyes than it might to those of us who have gotten so used to its rough edges that we can hardly feel them anymore.  And Shin Chan calls us on that:  on all the absurdities apparent to a child that adults become numb to and even wind up perpetuating.  Shin, guilelessly rude, takes action with an energy, authenticity and obliviousness we can't help but cheer and be horrified by at the same time.

Don't worry about the almost aggressively poor animation; it works surprisingly well, acquiring the charm you'd hope it would immediately.  The voice work is wonderful too; merely thinking of Shin's voice and odd delivery makes it almost impossible not to smile.

I had many great moments with the Shin Chan series.  Upbeat, sometimes wistful, often extremely funny, this anime introduces you to a character it's very hard not to love.  Keeping in mind that Shin Chan is no role model for kids and the show  often makes adults look foolish, you might want to watch an episode first before deciding whether to show this series to your children.  If you take it for granted that both kids and adults most certainly are foolish, Shin Chan's take on them will be less of an issue.  But that's up to you.",1276041600,2,2062,4.640883977900552
8320668,3,B001M6SHAQ,"Shin Chan is a great show yet I feel like Season Two part one was not as great as the complete season one. If you want to collect all of them go ahead but if you want to try and get the best ones, try to make this one of the last ones you get.

P.S. The Star Wars Parody was the WORST EPISODES they had in there. I don't know what the other user was talking about since I felt it was a complete waste of time watching it.",1269043200,,421,3.6777777777777776
8320669,5,B001M6SHAQ,"The Shin Chan series is this: (1) not as shocking as South Park, Not as goofy as Beavis and Butt-head, and has more potty language then the Simpsons. (2)Most of the dialogue is edgy and fresh. However, the a_ _ dance becomes tiresome by the end of season one, as well as the small b_ _b jokes. This is a series worth owning because it has a quality where the jokes sometime fly by so quickly it'll take several seconds to regester. Also, all the jokes are not gross or shoved in for shock value, there are some charming subtleties to Shin Chan...though you have to look hard for them. (3)it's about a dysfunctional family, but a subtle version. Not as annoying as Married with Children, or as Crazy as the Simpsons. (4) For some viewers it may be disturbing to see an animated five year old flashing his lower region, or the idea of poking fun at domestic abuse (Penny and her mother). However, if you can handle these two surprising elements, Shin Chan really is an original treasure for people who just want something a little different then the shows mentioned above.
As for certain reviewers who are too nit-picky about how the show had been changed to suit American tastes. Please don't buy the show unless you have better things to do with your life then rip on a series mostly dedicated to butt jokes :) Otherwise, if you're the average American, enjoy the show :)",1258156800,,1371,4.51004016064257

8320671,5,B001M6SHAQ,Sold at a really low price and in the original packaging and its operating just as it should... Great seller,1244592000,,108,4.45
8320672,5,B001M6SHAQ,What can i say. I cant stop laughing at the Star Wars Parody that they did. Im aware that Crayon Shin Chan is for Familys in Japan but Funi pulled reverse 4Kids on it. And its worth. Also Laura does is Hilarious as Shin.,1238803200,2,220,4.0227272727272725
