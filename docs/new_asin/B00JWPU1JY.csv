8654195,1,B00JWPU1JY,I ordered this thinking that what I would receive would be vol. 1 of sailor stars. Instead I received a Spanish comedy of a guy dressed up in what appears to be a super hero costume called El Chapulin Colorado. Not happy,1439337600,10,220,4.261904761904762
8654196,3,B00JWPU1JY,"This release definitely has many cons, most of them small, one huge (on the disc I received). However, let's not forget the pretty sweet pro: we FINALLY have an official Sailor Stars sub!!! Keeping this in mind, if you wait a few years, you'll get the same thing on a VIZ Media set. Should you wait or not? It depends on how patient you are. Some of the bugs in this disc will probably be gone. I was impatient and jumped on it considering how good a deal it was; thus, I an tell you the flaws in it. There are mostly petty things that I know will be on your copy and one flaw that is not likely, but still a risk. The pros are obvious, so I'll just list the cons.
1. The subtitles are a tad too small, often misspelled, and out-of-sync farther into the disc, making it look like a fansub.
2. Don't ask why, but for some reason, you can't fast forward or rewind certain parts, and if you use the pisode menu, it wants to skip the opening and next-episode previews.
3. The main menu opening looks horrible.
4. It's not much of a flaw, but there are some laughably stupid moments in the episodes, like Michiru kissing the HUGE wound on Haruka's hand like it was a mere boo-boo in episode 1 (there was so much blood that she had to wipe her mouth with a hanky), or treating the room with Hotaru's name on it like the last place you would find her in episode 2. They do make for good laughs, though.
5. Last but certainly not least, my copy was defective. I ordered it straight from Amazon, only the first two of four episodes played, though if I was lucky, half of episode 3 played in another player.
So, even though that last one is probably just a rare anomaly, it's still certainly something to keep in mind. I say, buy with anticipation of getting a better version from VIZ.",1427241600,4,1775,4.223529411764706

8654199,2,B00JWPU1JY,"In May 2014, Viz announced that it got the license to the ENTIRE Sailor Moon franchise, including the never-released-in-America final season, Sailor Stars. What's even better is the fact that Viz is also going to dub that season as well, after getting through the first four seasons.

I really think you should wait to buy Sailor Stars until it's released here in the USA (probably in around 2016 or 2017 if the 3-4 month release period is anything to go by).",1423180800,3,459,4.666666666666667

They are the only ones to have the rights for the US Market! They will be releasing everything on DVD and Blu Ray starting this fall!
Stay away from this DVD and the 3 other volumes! They are BOOTLEGS! and are infringing on Viz Media rights! I'm sure there's going to be a lawsuit for this. Just warning everyone! Going to cancel my pre orders for this!",1400198400,7,484,4.329670329670329
