7027262,5,B00U1GQOUI,This is a great example of just how much horror can be created on a small budget. Full review soon to come on www.deaducated.com,1443312000,,128,4.375
7027263,2,B00U1GQOUI,"This is a low budget slasher (note choppy outdoor sound) .It follows the classic formula of showing us an incident in the past and then bring us to the present. The identity of the killer is not well hidden. I liked the 80's opening with everything being glow in the dark type stuff. When we move to the present,things get a little lame. The high point of the film appears to be the spanking of the twins during the hazing, based on the most popular reproduced photo still. The modern times was not well constructed as it appear they copied another film when they should have done something on their own. The ending was anti-climatic which downgraded the whole film.

My recommendation would be to watch ""Delta Delta Die"" instead and do your own spanking.  If you have already seen it, watch the extras.

7027265,1,B00U1GQOUI,"Are you kidding me?! This is hands down, without any hyperbole, the worst indie slasher I have ever seen. And I have seen hundreds going all the way back to the 70's. Non-existent script, dialogue that will literally cause the immediate loss of IQ points, and average at best, blood and gore effects by the  ""legendary"" Marcus Koch. What is worse is that not only did the makers of this movie post the fake reviews that we all know get posted, but they must have infiltrated horror movie review cites and paid them off as well as I read at least a half dozen of these reviews that praised it. I should have been paid to watch this because I know the actors in this thing must have paid the makers to be in it. ""Hey goofy actress, after you have said your ridiculous line, laugh like an idiot for at least 30 seconds.""  This film was garbage.",1440720000,6,841,4.3164556962025316
7027266,5,B00U1GQOUI,"I had a great opportunity to work on a movie and so glad that I got that chance and so glad that our horror movie is now on Amazon! This movie is a throwback to those 1980s horror/slasher films but with a twist. It's an indie film, it's guerilla style and it was fun to write and edit! Check it out and add it to your horror line up. More to come from Gaterblade Films, LLC.",1426204800,4,374,3.9342105263157894
7027267,5,B00U1GQOUI,"Slaughter at the Sorority

Sorority-based slasher films have a long, bloody tradition in the history of horror movies.  And that sexy, splattery sub genre is set to return in fine form with the upcoming release of Gatorblade Films Die Die Delta Pi.

Produced and Directed by Florida Filmmakers Sean Donohue and Chris Leto, Die Die Delta Pie is set in the late 1980s when times were fun, technology was changing, clothes were rad, and girls were bad. The movie tells the tale of a group of sorority sisters who pull a deadly prank on one of their own. A prank that goes waaaaay wrong, killing its intended victim and unleashing a bloody serial killer massacre that shuts down the sorority.

But 27 years later, the Delta Pi sorority re-opens, new sisters are elected, and the killings begin again. Is The Burnt One behind the butchery? Youll have to see it to find out.

Like the sorority slaughter flicks that came before it, Die Die Delta Pi promises plenty of sexy bodies and buckets of gore. The filmmakers have also vowed that all of the gore will be shot in-camera using practical makeup FX rather than CGI trickery. Even better, those gore FX have been created by gore maestro extraordinaire, Marcus Koch.

Sounds good to us!

Also, dig the FANTASTIC poster. Its an instant classic.

7027270,3,B00U1GQOUI,"The cover art makes you think of the good ol' slasher film days, which was a nice touch as the movie does use the same kind of set up as older slasher flicks, with the twist you saw coming at the end. All in all when the movie first came on I was set to hate it, it had that really cheap, terribly acted, over the top sort of vibe that a lot of newer b or indie films seem to have. They lack in talent, story, and often originality. This one was not really and exception to that, but I do think they captured a teeny bit more spirit, and that homage to the eighties slashers was decent, though the characters in the beginning who were supposed to be representing the eighties were so lacking I literally made the comment couldn't they have at least watched the I Love the Eighties episodes first so they could get it at least a little right? That aside, lol, the movie turned out to be kind of fun. I didn't feel the need to turn it off, and I was actually entertained. It was far from the greatest but also far from the worst. At five bucks I would consider owning it. Lower would be nice, lol. I'd recommend this for the type that will watch anything as long as it's horror, but no one who's super serious about their believablity or originality or seriousness. If that helps, lol.",1454112000,,1283,4.198380566801619

7027274,3,B00U1GQOUI,"Ok.  I have to write this one, just to add some comments.  First off this is all supposed to happen at Sun state College, which on a letter bears a strikingly close address to the University of Tampa, which I'd guess is what the writer really means, since Sun state College is a beauty and massage school (though that might explain a few things).
  Here's the rundown. Recycled revenge story for the humiliated girl who got savagely burned at a school prank. Nothing new here.  Film quality goes from low to ""ok"" during this movie not a major budget.  No really new ideas. Standard plot everyone knows.  Little twist at the end, nothing amazing.
  This is one of those meant to be dumb horror flicks at times it works and is kinda funny, mostly just bad drama.  Kinda a mind numbing, I need to be smoking something stronger than a cigarette to Truly enjoy.  Still watching an obvious train wreck still has some compensations. Mostly watching annoying people die.
  There are 2 generations of Pi's in this movie the first generation are th stupid annoying women that you would love to watch die over a long time.  However are just shown dead. The second generation are pretty much inncoent (dumb but innocent) and watching them die is kinda a waste.
  There is no sex in the movie but several scenes of nudity. One girl stands totally nude in the doorway (supposedly in the 80's with a Brazilian wax job).  The 2nd gen incredibly hot tanned girl with the large rack will do a shower scene where you get a good view of those assets at the scenes end. The 2nd gen blond girl will be topless throughout the campfire event.

 There is a nasty strangulation scene with barbed wire. Most the other deaths and effects are fairly hokey or not very gruesome.",1452816000,4,1748,4.544871794871795

No scares, lame acting, just a dull experience. I had to turn it off at about the 2/3 mark as it was just that boring. I was kind of hoping for a campy, cheesy throwback video, one I could kind of laugh through as just an 80s horror slasher tongue-in-cheek send-up. But, it's just a bad video, plain and simple. Not funny, not campy, just lame.",1455408000,,552,4.257142857142857
