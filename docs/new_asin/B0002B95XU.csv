2074429,4,B0002B95XU,"YES!  I've been waiting years for this to come out on DVD!  This went right on my Wish List.

Twenty years ago (dang I'm old), CBS ran this short-lived series about a team of interplanetary police based on the distant outpost of Fort Hope.  It had a wonderful cast, including several Babylon Five actors, Clint Howard (funny as always), the ever-awesome Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa (playing an alien warrior-priest with severe anger-management issues), and Academy Award winner Linda Hunt as their matriarchal base Commander.  I loved it.  You've got scary monsters.  You've got alien organized crime rings.  You've got amazonian space-babes.  You've got swordfights.  You've got a grouchy cyborg.  To this day I repeat Tagawa's line ""Move like water!"" at people, and nobody gets the reference.

Stop reading this review right now and order this set!",1378857600,105,843,5.208955223880597
2074430,3,B0002B95XU,"I am a Jeff Kaake fan! Even though the plot isn't the best (which is probably why this show only lasted six episodes) if you are a Jeff Kaake fan, you still have to see this. Even though he isn't clean shaven and roughed up a bit, he is still good looking and a great actor.

The characters are quirky, always getting by--barely--by the seats of their pants, honorable, and the good guys (and gals) always win. This is not a heavy show and there are always several laughs along the way.",1218931200,5,486,4.282608695652174
2074431,5,B0002B95XU,"Although I just was able to see only the third episode of the three. This movie had as good of a story plot and acting by great characters as it gets. I thought when it first started that it would be a grade B movie. Many folks that are in this show have made very good grade A films not just one shot TV stuff. I will keep after this 3some TV show till I can be able to purchase the whole thing on DVD.I happen to like Star Gate and all of the Star Trek as Well as Babylon 5. I thought the first go around on Battle Star G was Campy but cute. This go around on BSG has been great acting and stories. An updated Space Rangers could be at least as good as some where around the Star Gate Atlantis or Star Gate SG1 and if they worked it with new updated Scripts could be as good as BSG. Still I liked  Star Trek (Enterprise) and felt it should still be on the air as well. I know 30 million a year for Scott B was High but seemed like a good deal to me. But hey The Allen array only cost 100 million right. Hey Starship One was in that range as well I think we should have a new Space station called Pauly's an Allen Bar & Grill The InterGalactic  Wet spot to the Star's. Hey Paul get Bill and his wife to pony up a few bucks for the New Watering Hole. PS Get me a ticket on the Starship One when it fly's commercially. D Ray

2074445,5,B0002B95XU,A Grate series that came to an end to soon. I'm so happy this made it to dvd.,1502236800,,77,3.3333333333333335
2074446,3,B0002B95XU,"I remember watching ""Space Rangers"" when it first aired. While it wasn't as good as ""Star Trek: The Next Generation,"" I found it had potential. As such, I was disappointed when it was canceled. Fast forward to recent times when on a whim, I decided to look the series up. I was pleasantly surprised to see it on DVD, so I bought it.

As a series, ""Space Rangers"" has a decent concept, but alas isn't taken very far. The series is set on Fort Hope, which is on the planet Avalon out on the ""frontier."" As I watched, I couldn't help but think that if this series was remade for today, one of the first things I'd do is follow the ""Firefly"" model and actually make Fort Hope feel like a frontier place. Instead, the exterior CG shots of the fort show a ""modern"" facility that just looks cheap and grungy on the inside. So there's a disconnect there.

Story-wise, this is a very episodic series, who's stories are filled with cliched writing. You have the dashing, leading man with the babe of a wife and adorable child, yet said wife doesn't understand her husband needing to do his actual job. Naturally, she leaves him. You have the rookie hotshot kid who's the son of a famous general. Said kid is looking to prove himself to his father and to his comrades. You have the babe pilot who's also tough as nails. You have the older, short, fat mechanic who's part cyborg. And rounding out the crew is the ""Klingon"" of the group, the alien Zylyn, played by Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa. Oddly enough, seeing Cary in this series made me a fan of him.

Sadly, we get very little in the way of development for any of these characters. Captain Boone's ""development"" is pretty much limited to the pilot and trying to balance his job with his marriage. After the first episode, his wife is gone and he's just the dashing, rogue, leading male actor. Daniel Kincaid's development limited to the cliche of living in his great father's shadow. Zylyn gets the most development due to his berserker warrior-priest character getting put on trial for murder. Even this is fairly limited. Were the series to be rebooted, it would need to have much better, less cliched character work done.

The special effects are pretty laughable, even for the 90s. You can point to ""Babylon 5"" as an example of the kind of CGI SFX used during this period, yet I'd say B5's are better than ""Space Rangers."" Then again, ""Space Rangers"" probably just didn't get the budget it should. With ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" running high in syndication and spinning off ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" in 1993, to say nothing of ""Babylon 5"" getting its start a little bit later that year, I can well imagine some smeg head at CBS saying, ""We've got to get in on this sci-fi thing,"" but not really wanting to do that. When you slap stuff against the wall, it usually doesn't end up with a good result.

Still, this would be a series that in the hands of good writers and a decent budget, it could be made into something special. I doubt that happens.

As to the DVD quality, there are no extras, not even subtitles for the hard of hearing. The video transfer appears to be VHS quality (480p). The first disc contains the original six episode. The second disc takes those six episodes and converts them into three movies, so other than the pilot, the episodes are not displayed in the same order.

In the end, Space Rangers was an interesting and good concept, but as a series, it was limited by cliched writing, poor special effects, and poor budget keep it from being a good series like Babylon 5 or other 90s sci-fi shows became.",1501286400,,3579,4.522411128284389

2074460,1,B0002B95XU,"Bottom line first:
A television, Sci Fi program has to be bad for me to even notice it has a theme song. Worst one of any TV theme music. Sets terrible, special effects- not special. The director must actively hate his audience or maybe just the scripts, they are bad. The fact that some reviewers laughed at the show does not mean it was funny, it just means that some people react to bad material badly done by laughing. I did like Space Ranger Commander -try reading that and not noticing how trite and juvenile that sounds.  Linda Hunt and I came to feel sorry for Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa the expected emotionless warrior alien noble humorless walking clich. Painful to watch. Recommendation-Run Away.

It is not my habit to buy things, books or movies, etc that I do not expect to like. I am generally a fan of Space Operas and I was looking forward to watching Linda Hunt in action. Man the things I will do to finish for an Amazon review. Things like watching this show beginning to end. I wanted to like this stuff. Evan as I was watching it I was working to find something to admire.

Consider this television time line:
Star Trek -1966
Space 1999 - 1975
Star Wars-1977 Yea I know not a TV Show. So many SCI FI things became possible after Industrial Light and Magic A program filmed 15 years later should have been able to learn something from Lucas Films
>>Space Rangers- 1993
Babylon 5 -1994

All of the other shows did virtually everything better than Space Rangers. Space 1999 was almost as bad with some of the worst special effects, but at least there was a boldness about how bad the sets were.  It was better and there was a true sense of adventure. The point: there was no reason for so much to be so bad about Space Rangers. In the production of Sci Fi for TV Space Rangers did not have invent anything in the field. It does ignore a goal to do anything as well.

At a strain, I agree that the cast did seem to have spent years as a team. The convention that a remote station in space would be operating with worn and unreliable gear was well written into the broadcasts.

On the off chance it was not painful enough to sit though the 6 episode on disk 1. Bloated, badly edited, overly long and the opposite of crisp episodes- are spliced together in pairs on disk 2 as the Ranger Chronicles.",1477526400,,2309,4.380841121495327

2074464,4,B0002B95XU,"This was a very interesting and entertaining show for its time. Sadly, the show was produced at a time when science fiction was just starting to creep back onto television after a long hiatus. It didn't have a big budget and tried too hard to be different, which worked against it.

The show had kind of a clich&eacute;d premise where a group of Space Rangers (sort of a cross between soldiers and police) traveled the Galaxy, keeping order. The show didn't take itself too seriously, leaning more towards comedy in ways that ""Firefly"" later perfected, but which this show took steps towards.

The characters were really out there. The commander was played by Linda Hunt with everyone not noticing how incredibly short she is. The cyborg engineer was my favorite. The joke was that he was always taking off body parts off himself that malfunctioned. My favorite scene was when he pulled out a slot with his heart in it (just a little pulsing red thing) and whacked it until it started beating again. There was also a warrior alien played by Hiroyuki Tagawa. On the surface, he was kind of a Spock character in that he was alien and stoic. But he was also kind of the opposite of Spock in that he was such an aggressive warrior that he had to wear a ""control collar"" to keep himself in check. When he took it off, watch out.

This series tried so hard not to be Star Trek that it shot itself in the foot. The pilot operated the ship while lying down, which made no sense, I guess to avoid looking like the navigator in Star Trek. They would travel down to the planet surface in little pods instead of teleporters or shuttlecraft.

Modern audiences may not appreciate it, but older fans or fans of classic scifi definitely will.",1474588800,,1726,4.540192926045016

I was stationed in Europe when this aired, and never saw it. Discovered it recently after completing a Babylon 5 binge. Cheap sets, bad acting and very rudimentary CG that looks identical to Transformers: Beast Wars cartoon. Not really impressed, and don't understand the massive fan love this show garners. It did have potential. Had they scrapped it and started over with a decent budget, it could have been a decent space opera. Maybe on par with Babylon 5.

The qualify of the set itself, I am disappointed. The collection is several discs in one box with no protection between them. There is nothing to indicate the order of the discs.

Linda Hunt, who is a fabulous actress, was the Commander of Fort Hope, and outpost of law enforcement somewhere in the middle of nowhere.  The Rangers seemed to look like a rag-tag bunch, but who were actually very highly skilled unit.  There was quite a mix in the starring crew.  You had a captain who was the brains of the outfit, a stunner of a ship's navigator, an alien warrior-priest who was no dim-bulb, and a  android mechanic who knew his stuff.  Add to this a new, untried, and slightly trigger-happy kid, and you've got the makings of an interesting series.  Unfortunately, it was not to be.

At the time there was a lot of outer space sci-fi on the air - mostly in syndication like Star Trek the Next Generation.  While the Star Trek series' tended toward drama in the 90's, this show was pure colorful adventures.  It seemed similiar in tone to Buck Rodgers with Gil Gerard.  Space Rangers lasted mere weeks on network TV and this DVD package has two dvds - one containing the series six episodes and one containing three movies edited together from the episodes, which was a common practice with sci-fi flavored shows too few in number for syndication.  It is a fun addition to a sci-fi fan's dvd library.  Looking back on it, the effects were very good and the writing seemed to offer a lot of interesting cultures and ideas for exploration - which alas were not given time to manifest.  There are some interesting guest stars in this series' brief run including legendary comedian Buddy Hackett and sci-fi starlet extraordinaire Claudia Christien.
Space Rangers was an appropriate name for the show as it detailed the adventures of a group of rangers charged with keeping the peace at a far off interstellar out post.

2074609,5,B0002B95XU,"It seems that this particular product is rather controversial.  I just purchased this and checked it out.

I remember seeing this show back when it originally aired.  I never caught more than the pilot at the time.  That was in 1992 or 3.  NOBODY remembers this show.  I thought it was pretty novel and it features a lot of recognizable actors.  I can't imagine how they got Linda Hunt for this show.  I really wish it had survived.

The Show:
I'm not going to gush over the show and tell you that you'll like it, but I will try to give you an idea of what it's like.  Apparently, just about everyone in the early 1990s scrambled for new science-fiction programming.  A ton of shows were released in 1993 alone.  These included Deep Space Nine and The X-Files.  The atmosphere, effects and scripts all feel like a cross between Babylon 5 and Space: Above and Beyond.  Is there anything special about this show?  You better believe it!  Not since The Wraith have we seen such fine Clint Howard goodness on screen!  I take that back - Clint's appearance on William Shatner's roast is, BY FAR, his greatest performance - but who can resist Clint???

Is it Cheesy?  OH YEAH!  With all the complaints, I'm shocked nobody mentioned the Space-Simon competition during the crew round-up in the first episode.  Probably because they didn't really watch the show.  Right on-par with the water-billiards in Star Trek V!  But on the whole, I thought the special effects did their job just fine.  Science Fiction shows have a notorious history of being under-funded.  Space Rangers is certainly no exception.  And don't tell me that Star Trek TNG/DS9/Voyager special effects were really all that great.  Those shows were simply a bit more polished - and weren't NEARLY as action-oriented.

But it's a fun sci-fi romp that I think is worth every penny of 7 bucks.

The story is basically about space police having adventures on their space ship, based on a planet in the middle of nowhere.  I know...original...

The DVD:
This is a bare-bones release.  Expect no frills.  The first DVD contains all 6 episodes with no subtitles, no commentary and no other videos or interviews to complement the release.

The second DVD contains the three ""Chronicles"" episodes.  I find these to be a complete waste of time.  Someone mentioned they were the same footage glued together.  Again, had they actually watched the entire set they would know that the Chronicles edits are not the same footage.  I found them to be a bit incoherent.  They not only removed some footage completely, but they re-arranged massive amounts of footage so as to not even be in chronological order.  I suppose if you got the original VHS tapes 20 years ago, you'd want these.

Anyway, it's six episodes of a show that died a quick death.  I think if you liked Babylon 5 and Space: Above and Beyond, this show would fit nicely in your collection.

As for it being ""the worst show ever""...I don't know about you, but I'm tired of soap-operas disguised as reboots.  Crummy acting, horrible scripts, questionable CGI, treating the audience like idiots - OH MY GOD, IT'S 1993!!!!!",1411689600,,3128,4.734200743494424
2074610,1,B0002B95XU,"This is probably the worst Sci Fi series ever- and that includes Enterprise. It's an embarrassment to real sci fi fans who would like to pretend that it never happened.

It sucked so bad that they killed the series inside 6 weeks.

If you consider it a comedy it may get another star because it is laughably bad.

Two kids and a dog and a video cam could do a better production job. The dog could write better scripts.

When you get to CD 2 you find the first six episodes from CD 1 shown again on CD 2, retitled 'The Space Chronicles 1-2-3', which combine the first six episodes (on CD 1) into three 'chronicles' of two episodes each. Same exact footage as on CD 1. That means you can cut in half the total viewing time you actually get. Serious advertising deception. The six episodes are pretty much what you would expect in cheesy, dated sci-fi, but no complaints there (the only reason I didn't give it one star). I don't like being deceived by advertising. Had I not waited five weeks (one week over the return time) to view the CD I would have returned it under 'not as described' on principle alone. My two cents.",1410912000,,971,4.554285714285714

2074614,1,B0002B95XU,"I still love this TV series and wish it would have lasted but as with all things of potential on network TV that does not have some teenagers crying in it (which seem to stay on forever even though they SUCK!), if it does not give the station a pot of gold in two days, it's cut. This was a great short run series and it was going to be great to finally get all six episodes to watch but then we get to why I gave this a 1 star rating. The main Amazon seller has a hold on it while they're researching a problem with the product but there are 15 or 20 others still being allowed to sell it so I figure they're good to go. WRONG! I got the 2 disc set and tried them both in a PS3, and three different DVD players which all resulted the same ""DISC Read Error"" along with a few choice words from me directed at the players and disc. I figure I paid almost as much in S&H as I paid for the disc and would most likely have to pay S&H to return it so I decided to just round file it (garbage can) and lesson learned. Then I decided to try it in my computer as a last attempt before it goes away and big surprise, it plays (at least the very beginning does, not watched them all yet) just fine. That makes me think just one thing. Some cheap rip of a recording where the violator does not even have the skills to put it in the proper DVD format so it'll play. Don't waste your money and your time here. I hope to get a better copy of these somewhere else and if all else fails I still have them available to play on my computer since it is a great show. Thinking of the situation, I would have to assume that no matter who you're buying this from they all probably have the same problem due to the original source unless somebody out there can indicate a specific store that sells a version that works in a DVD player as advertised, I do not recommend this product.",1410048000,3,1858,3.9839142091152815

Any sci0fi fan will enjoy it but is a must buy for those of us who watch it when it aired because it was aired out of order and not all 6 was seen ever where. Disk 2 is not a repeat. They took 2 stories and made movies out of them and that what is on disk 2. As someone who like the DVD exters as much as the show it was a big let down due to no extras at all. Many of these short runs sci-fi DVD sets do not come with extras. Maybe one day someone would put out a DVD that covers extras from all of these shows.,1408147200,,540,3.546218487394958
2074624,3,B0002B95XU,"When I spotted that this TV series was available on DVD I figured I just HAD to add it to my collection.

This series debuted into a very tough market, with Star Trek's ""Deep Space Nine"" having just premiered and ""Next Generation"" going strong and story-heavy ""Babylon 5"" making big headlines.  Unfortunately it was never able to find an audience and it was canceled very quickly--in the US after only four episodes were aired.

To be honest the series didn't quite hold up to my recollection.  It's hard to believe to judge from its relatively sloppy special effects that this was a contemporary to those other series.  The stories were slightly better and helped a great deal by the inclusion of the other two episodes that weren't shown during the original run in the United States.  The first couple of stories were a bit dodgy but by the end of the run a solid foundation had been established and some interesting supporting characters were beginning to be developed.

But I spent a fun couple of days watching it all over again, and it'll find a home in my collection of oddball science fiction TV series.  Glad I got it, and honestly it can't be beat for the price.

Recommended for any fan who remembers the show and/or who just plain likes slightly campy sci-fit.",1407974400,,1272,4.642857142857143

2074628,4,B0002B95XU,"The cast was pretty likeable and the concept was kind of Captain Midnight meets Fort Apache. Casting off Captain Boon's family and then introducing new ""interested women"" was ok but there was never anything ""sparking"" between he and they. The gooey stuff for Zylyn was a distraction and he seemed too Mr. Spock seeking to be an ultimate warrior for me. He probably would have been a more interesting character if he didn't growl and grunt so much but he was a good ""go to"" enforcer when they needed intelligent muscle. I think with all the characters it took a while longer to introduce them and allow the audience to develop an affinity for them as the actors felt more comfortable in their roles. I wonder why they just repeated the episodes on the next disk? How crazy was that? Find a few of the characters and interview them as well as the people who created the series instead. I think a lot of us would have liked to have known how the whole cancellation thing went over. I need sub-titles so that was something I sorely missed. I wanted to see more Dr. Mimmer. Clint Howard was outrageous and he made me recall James Bond's Q. I think this series would have caught on given a chance for the plots to develop more. I wonder why they needed an annoying charachter like Colonel Weiss to intrude on Linda Hunt's Chennault. I felt that watered down the good chemistry she had with the others. The first ""Replacement"" was hilarious and Ringer should have been a fixture on board ""Tin Lizzie"". We loved him. He could have been the ultimate diagnostician for everything from crew headaches to engine failure. Oh well thinking about some of the other sci-fi series that were short lived, I think this one deserved at least six more episodes before sentencing to death by the powers that be. If they could cancel Firefly before recognizing its potential they certainly showed no gift for good judgement by being quicker on the trigger with this one. I guess for me the wanting more after only six episodes says it all. I was hooked and left hungry.

2074673,5,B0002B95XU,"For nostalgia freaks, here are two cancelled series from the '80's and 90's (each dropped
in different decades). Oh, what a difference a months make, today's blurring-fast years
will see good and bad series fold as soon as computers say so.

Space Rangers was released in 1982 and is remembered as a ""cult series"". The Golden Monkey came out after. And... is not much remembered. No cult status (Cult just means many followers) Stephen Collier was fine but the scripts DOA.

I give an all-out enthusiastic five stars to Space Rangers, which is
why I list them first. To Golden Monkey I give a merciful 3 stars.

Space Rangers was 'way ahead of its time in concept, writing, production and cool. While Golden Monkey was churned out by Universal, with a Hollywood ""let's do it again 'cause it worked before old-school mentality'. The G.Monkey was made to mix humor with action (with, sorry, some very corny supposed to be funny ;} writing), while Rangers had more of a Star Trek Attitude in all aspects - writing, creative philosophy,characters and; well, Everything. Thanks again Gene Roddenberry.

Back then, Star Trek was mostly shot on sound stages. While Space Rangers did location shoots and hectic/digital space action shots. (Yes,RANGERS too for practicality, shot some in-studio shots, as appropriate).

The outcome: Space Rangers is more like today's quality TV (both in production
and viewer sophistication with more complex plots, less-exec-managed scripts

Space Rangers used outside nature locales (yes, some, tricked out). Hip, quick, real dialogue and more quirky writing like today's fare. That is, real, unchained and smart-funny. Ditto the mutli-layered characters, issues. So plots and action came closer to real, original and quick. Their editing played to those elements as well.

Overall, Rangers writing was superb, natural, ahead of the cliches which
so riddled earlier decades. Often funny, too. Not often enough, though.

So, to parse out praise, 5-stars to Rangers and 3-stars to Gold Monkey.

(And another 5 stars for another ranger - The Lone Ranger Collection I just bought; the original TV series with Clayton Moore. Moore really believed in his masked man and what he represented.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lone-Ranger-Collection/dp/B0012EI8BQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lone Ranger Collection</a>&nbsp;Also...

I noted,studying the 80's (but enhanced and brought to life) prints, Moore did his own Hi-Ho-ing Silver jump starts and rode very, very well. And did whatever else the Ranger needed to do to be real and risky (...Okay, he didn't really shoot guns outa bad-guys' hands. Probably an insurance issue). Moore's RANGER, B&W and dated is vastly better than the 2013 Lone Ranger.

I gave the 'new' Johnny Depp Lone Ranger movie one star. If you buy it or bought it, look at the deleted scenes and 'making of' selections. Check the credits, this movie was hated by its creators. Eventually, me too.  rc",1390435200,,2980,5.357601713062098

So I got two discs with the same episodes.  Enjoyed the episodes, but expected to get more episodes on the 2nd disc.  Don't know how many episodes aired on TV, but if there were more than what was on one disc, this is an incomplete collection of the series.",1385856000,4,415,4.1375
2074685,5,B0002B95XU,"This is a fun, obscure action series from the early 90s that I never thought I'd see on DVD. 6 episodes aired on CBS in 1993 which I've kept on tape over the years. There are three additional episodes that are a re-package of the existing episodes.
 This is more of an action/adventure series than a sci-fi series. The sci-fi element adds an interesting twist to the story lines. These rangers are based at an outpost in outer space and are tasked with enforcing the law, rescuing people in trouble and keeping peace in their quadrant of space. The characters are somewhat stereotypical of what you'd expect in an action series, but then you're not going to put this on and expect Shakespeare! Linda Hunt is terrific as the outpost commander and there's no shortage of fast moving action in each episode.
 The overall look of the series is a bit cheesy. It looks like it was shot on videotape and transferred to film. A lot of the visual effects are CGI, which wasn't quite ready for prime time back then. Despite the low budget production values, the show holds up pretty well after 20 years. Good stories and characters never go out of style.
 I'm very pleased with the quality of the DVD presentation. Mill Creek has released a lot of value packages over the years where you get a lot for your money, but the source material was poor quality. Not the case with this series. It looks as crisp and colorful as it did when it aired 20 years ago. The dialog is a bit low in a Dolby 5.1 mix, but that's a small nit pick. It actually sounds the same on my old tape which was recorded in S-VHS hi-fi off the original broadcast. Kudos to Mill Creek!
 There are no bonus features, but at $10, who's complaining? Get a bowl of popcorn, put this on, sit down and get ready for some fun.",1385683200,3,1778,4.395136778115502

2074687,3,B0002B95XU,I admit that I got this impulsively because I recall this series way back but was cut short. I only had 4 episodes recorded and when I saw the running time listed of 557 minutes I assumed there would be about 12 episodes. But I find out that the chronicles was just a rehash of the same 6 episodes paired up as movies. It has been my experience that many tv shows that have been cut short have had a lot more episodes. A good example is the Starhunter 2300 in which I only saw 4 or 5 episodes but was over 20 episodes. Stuff like that is a real treat. Stuff like this not so much. This only had a couple of missed shows and that is it. Hardly worth the price I paid. I like this well enough but I don't appreciate deceptive tactic of doubling up the same episodes but would appreciate more honesty.,1383955200,2,798,4.089171974522293
2074688,5,B0002B95XU,Series was excellent.  Loved the characters.  Great acting by a distinguished cast which included Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa and Linda Hunt.  Guest star Buddy Hackett was an added surprise in one of the episodes.,1383868800,,206,5.375
2074689,5,B0002B95XU,"Space Rangers, CBS, Jan. 1993, aired 4 of 6 episodes out of order (which made the series nonsensical, just like Fox did to Firefly); all 6 aired overseas.  Great stereo sound (I only listened w/ headphones; ending credits state episodes are recorded in THX surround, so that may be the case, but there is no such info on the box); no subtitles; very good picture quality (although often times seems quite soft of focus; no dropouts); effects by Industrial Light & Magic; no dvd extras.  Menu has episode selection, and each episode is broken into 5 chapters.  Music by Hans Zimmer (notable for MANY movie soundtracks, such as Lion King, Gladiator, Black Hawk Down, several Batman & Pirates of the Caribbean movies, Inception...).  Created by Pen Densham (Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves; Outer Limits & Twilight Zones revivals...).  Disc 1 has the six episodes, disc 2 combines 2 episodes (such as Fort Hope + Banshees) to make 3 ""movies"".  Great casting of Clint Howard as the science guy in his usual comic relief role, and Linda Hunt (I so loved her in Silverado).  To me the show has a vague feel and/ or look of a mash-up of Babylon 5, Firefly, Brisco County Jr., and The Last Starfighter.  Following is a list of the episodes (I beta taped the original episodes when they aired, and all of the episodes were shorter than on the dvd release, especially the pilot).
Pilot (a.k.a. Fort Hope), air date 1/27/93, 47:08 minutes (dvd episode 49:45).
Replacements, 1/6/93, 45:15 (dvd episode 45:45).
Banshees, 1/13/93, 46:47 (dvd episode 47:30); IMHO, the best episode.
Death Before Dishonor, 1/20/93, 46:20 (dvd episode 46:45).

2074690,5,B0002B95XU,"Space Rangers!  I have had a copy of most of these episodes on VHS which I taped off the TV back when this was originally aired.  They look terrible, and my collection was incomplete.  I figured that was a piece of sci fi history that would remain incomplete.  I know there were a lot of sci fi fanatics like me out there who felt the same--and so did some company that finally went ahead and made this show available on DVD after all these years!!

Amazingly, this show holds up pretty well, too!  I was ready to soak of the nostalgia and probably do a lot of cringing while watching, too.  Not so!  I have watched through the first half of the episodes so far, and I have found them totally enjoyable.  It's no Babylon 5.  It's episodic, network sci fi TV from back in the day. It was made to be a fun romp in space with action and some cool sci fi ideas.  The effects are top notch for the day it was produced.  And, it's probably about as great as you remember it!

People who are not in their 40's and can't remember when this show was aired and have not pined away over the years wondering if it would ever be released may not find this as enjoyable as I did--they might, but I am less likely to best represent folks who have never seen this before.
