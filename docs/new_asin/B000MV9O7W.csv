2750469,5,B000MV9O7W,This was very interesting as a period piece and I received it in excellent condition.  I am very pleased with it.,1423180800,,113,4.380952380952381
2750470,3,B000MV9O7W,"A stupid and fun bad-guys-versus-good-guys movie presenting itself as a documentary, which it is not.  Apparently not well researched.  Example: the segment on Bonnie and Clyde has Bonnie smoking a cigar incessantly.  Had it been properly researched, it would have been (easily) found that Bonnie Parker only once was photographed or seen with a cigar, and it was a posed joke.  Etc., etc. ditto ditto for the rest of the movie.  Lots of fun.  Don't do your history term paper on what it contains.",1417219200,2,497,4.857142857142857
2750471,1,B000MV9O7W,"After watching the recent TV movie about Bonnie and Clyde and re-watching the version from the 1960s, I became interested in the real Bonnie and Clyde. While reading a factual account about this famous couple, I came across a little info on Pretty Boy Floyd. I read that Pretty Boy Floyd had wanted nothing to do with Clyde because he'd carelessly killed too many bystanders while committing his crimes. This is my groundwork for watching """"Guns Don't Argue,"" a terrible movie that is based on rumors and gossip. This movie educated me by reminding me of the kind of junk that I watched as a kid in the fifties that gave us stereotyped images. Criminals and people on the run are evil in every facet of their lives, and ""bad guys"" speak a bank robber lingo that is foreign to most of us. In reality, Bonnie Parker had posed as a lark holding a gun and a cigar. ""Guns Don't Argue"" features a foul-mouthed girl with a cigar in her mouth in absolutely all her scenes, which is ridiculous. The real Bonnie drank too much, and she was known to swear a lot, but she and Clyde were actually kind to people they kidnapped. Also, in every scene, Bonnie and Clyde are bossy and rude to everyone, even each other. They were actually close to their families, the mothers in particular, and they shared the money they stole with their families. Clyde wasn't a boy scout or an alter boy by any means, but he wasn't one-dimensional either. This movie features these three people shooting at almost everyone they encounter without provocation. The dialogue is silly. There isn't much real or factual about this movie. Even the vehicles featured are all wrong. All three of these real people died in 1934, so the stolen vehicles that they drive in the movie should be from 1934 or older. ""Guns Don't Argue"" has writing, producing and acting quality similar to that of a cable TV porn movie. But it's worse because it's supposed to be based on facts.",1389225600,2,1932,4.586705202312139
2750472,1,B000MV9O7W,"This is a dream come true for me. I have been looking for this horrible movie for years. I cannot remember when or where I saw it(MST3k,perhaps?),but I do remember laughing uproariously through the entire movie.
The sets are cheap;the actors barely actors(for the most part)and the overall impression you may get is that this is the exact antithesis of""Reefer Madness.""
So actually,because I am a lover of baaaaad movies(but I love Ed Wood) and this one qualifies,I am going to sit myself down to Sunday dinner,and watch this beloved and horrid movie,hoping to not choke on my food while laughing.",1309046400,2,597,4.920792079207921
2750473,3,B000MV9O7W,"Released to theaters in 1957, GUNS DON'T ARGUE is a composite of three 1952 ""Gangbusters"" syndicated TV episodes, loosely woven together with additional narration. Focus is on Prohibition Era criminals. As this show was pro-law enforcement, facts that reflect badly on the FBI have been changed. Here for example, instead of their brutal ambush-style executions, both John Dillinger and Clyde Barrow fire the first shots after being given a chance to surrender.

Others covered (Baby Face Nelson, the Barker Gang, Pretty Boy Floyd) fare better; that is if you can ignore all the 1950s sets, props and costumes used to recreate the Roaring Twenties.
