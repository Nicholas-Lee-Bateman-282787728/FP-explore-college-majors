She and the family have much fun exploring yoga postures, animal sounds and dancing. Ingrid's voice is soothing and her instruction is very helpful.  the scenery and music are beautiful and healing, i suggest this dvd  for families interested in learning yoga!",1237507200,14,376,5.032258064516129

3694688,5,B001M9PBK2,"I have done yoga through various studios and health clubs for years, and love the strength and stretching aspects, as well as the calming mental effect. I wanted to find something that my husband (not flexible at all!) and kids (ages 2, 4 and 8) could do with me, as a family activity. This is challenging enough that if you are new to yoga you will feel some sore muscles,  but easy enough for my kids to follow along. The animal noises make it fun, and the sections are brief enough that it keeps their attention. There is a section for partner stretches that lets everyone move off of their mats and work with each other to complete, and this is probably our favorite part. I would definitely recommend this as a good family activity!",1485129600,13,737,4.45925925925926

3694694,2,B001M9PBK2,"I have a high energy 2 year old who loves to do yoga with ""Ninny"". I think Yoga is a stretch here. As a yoga teacher I believe this is a silly, dancy video that does not work on focus, calm, breathing... all the major benefits of yoga that would be wonderful for a child. This video may be an exercise routine that gets kids up and moving but it is not mindful or focus building. I wanted something serious enough for me to do with her and actually get some benefit while showing children participating. Kids like to watch and imitate- this could have been an excellent way to calm your child, teach some mindfulness, demonstrate simplified breathing techniques and teach the true benefits and joys of Yoga-This was very disappointing.",1469404800,13,735,4.575757575757576

3694703,4,B001M9PBK2,I bought this Yoga for Families DVD as a way to incorporate working out with my 5 year old. This DVD does great at giving nice instructions that are clear and easy for even kids to follow. It's a fun way to incorporate yoga and has different moves than typical solo yoga moves for adults. There are some silly parts that the kids can really enjoy. It's a great way to get in a quick yoga workout with your kids.,1456272000,,411,4.15

3694706,5,B001M9PBK2,I don't know why there were negative reviews for this dvd. My 3 year old and 1 year old and I love it!  It's getting my kids moving and is actually a really great workout!

3694708,5,B001M9PBK2,"This is a great video. The poses and stretches are easy enough for a 5 year old to do, but it's not hokey or obnoxious like many kids' exercise videos. My 13 and 8 year olds love to do this.",1451347200,,190,3.775
3694709,5,B001M9PBK2,"I have three boys (ages 5, 3, and 3). They LOVE to ""do yoga"" with this DVD. They ask me to do yoga with them and enjoy the fun ""games"" that this DVD uses to introduce younger ones to yoga. The children are able to do basic yoga moves while pretending to be animals or do fun activities like dumping cookies out. There is even a section where they get to pair up. My boys especially like this part (of course, they always want mama for their partner). :) I highly recommend this DVD.",1450656000,,482,4.138297872340425
3694710,5,B001M9PBK2,Got this to do yoga with my young daughter. The moves are really easy and it is made to be fun and silly. This is really made in mind for young children to do yoga. For older kids and adults you should find a video more challenging.,1440892800,,232,3.9574468085106385

As an adult,  the animal parts are a bit repetitive,  but this is a great way to do yoga as a family & gain her interest in healthy, fun exercise.",1436918400,,333,3.9402985074626864

3694733,5,B001M9PBK2,"I was a little worried that using a family exercise video would be too cheesy and drive me crazy. This video did have a few things that bothered me, at first, but the more I use it the more I like it. The narrator is a little dry, but that's not a big deal. The music isn't great, but not a big deal. The workout itself does move quickly, but I feel like that is a good thing. Kids lose interest quickly. This video keeps it snappy, not too difficult, and also allows challenge for me. I love how the menu is formatted. You can choose how much you want to do, and it is all separated into warm-up, work-out, and cooling down for each section. Overall, I'm keeping it, I'm using it, and the kids enjoy it. Get it.",1402876800,3,712,4.0928571428571425

3694735,2,B001M9PBK2,"I am so sorry, but I just can't recommend this dvd.  The presenter is rather annoying and uses the same phrases over and over.  The workout is ok.  I believe this should be marketed more to younger children and not families.",1399852800,2,224,4.414634146341464
3694736,3,B001M9PBK2,"Although the instructor in the video is doing the poses in a timely matter, the narrator is constantly talking and moving on to the next pose 2 sec after you got into the previous pose. The kids like it, but it's not my favorite.",1396396800,6,229,4.2272727272727275

3694742,5,B001M9PBK2,"I really enjoyed the yoga for families.  I got this to do with my 6 yr old daughter.  She really enjoyed it.  The instructor made learning certain moves fun for the kids by relating it to an animal and having them make the noise.  My daughter really had fun with that.  It is great for helping them with balancing.  My daughter was excited because she could do almost all of the moves.

I def recommend this as a basic family yoga DVD.  It was effective and easy to do.",1386115200,3,469,4.191011235955056

3694749,5,B001M9PBK2,My son who is 7 loves to do yoga by himself and w/ us. After reading many reviews I had purchased a different DVD on Amazon that none of us liked. It was weird and was more about story telling w/ animals than actually teaching the children poses. I sent it back and dug back into my research. I found this video. It is awesome! My son has done it alone and we have done it w/ him. It is very easy to follow. I definitely recommend this to anyone who is trying to get their little ones into yoga.,1365033600,5,495,3.96

3694751,4,B001M9PBK2,This one is fun and creative but it would be helpful if you had some yoga experience and even then you'll want to do the routines several times so that you get familiar with them.  I like the relaxed atmosphere.,1362960000,2,211,4.275
3694752,4,B001M9PBK2,"Like the title, it is indeed a great yoga video for families.  It is fun for both kids and adults.  My wife and son love making the animal noises during the animal poses.

I am working with kids grades 1-5 so I would recommend this to anyone. We LOVE it!",1357948800,7,336,3.8840579710144927
3694757,2,B001M9PBK2,"It has some good idea for entertaining kids while doing yoga, but some things are too advanced for kids (or a beginner like me) without more explanation than is provided.  It was annoying to me that the instructions were all voiced-over.",1346716800,,237,4.780487804878049
3694758,2,B001M9PBK2,"I have been looking for ways to introduce my son to Yoga and so we gave Yoga for Families a try. The emphasis of this video is supposed to be about ""fun"" and ""family.""

Cons:

The instructor is the only person who looks like she's having a genuine good time.
There are some random scenes of the family hanging out and the instructor doing yoga poses that just don't fit with what's happening.
The pace of the video is pretty quick and there are some fairly difficult yoga poses regarding balance that for a beginner could be dangerous to move so quickly.
The animal noises we are supposed to make for the poses are corny and no one in the video actually does them. I really don't know what they are for because they only served to distract me and my son.
The video is hacked up into way to many segments, it distracts and gets annoying.

Pros:

The instructor keeps a smile on her face and tries hard. I would like to see her lead a serious yoga routine.
The video is easy to follow seems well made with good lighting and sound.
Music is there but not overwhelming you or the instructor's voice.

I'm glad we had the chance to just rent this video because it's not a good fit. This video tries hard but lacks that certain quality that could have made it special. Pass on this one.",1339977600,5,1280,4.2946058091286305
3694759,2,B001M9PBK2,"This video has very little to do with yoga.  If you and your family are already in good shape and very familiar with yoga poses, it can take you through a VERY fast paced series of poses with annoying music.  But there is nothing relaxing about it!  I could barely get into the pose for a second before she had moved on to something totally different.  Many of the moves are basic enough, but others ask for quite a bit of balance with no warning and no alternate moves for beginners.  Definitely not something my four year old and I could do together for fun.",1322611200,,560,4.295238095238095
3694760,5,B001M9PBK2,"I purchased this DVD to introduce my 5 year old granddaughter to Yoga and it worked. We both enjoyed all aspects of the DVD: music, exercises, and general mood of the presentation were upbeat and encouraging. Highly recommended.",1316131200,,228,5.026315789473684
3694761,4,B001M9PBK2,"I sampled this video at a Girl Scout training meeting. It was fun, easy to follow and I could still feel that I had worked my abs and arms a few days later. Knowing that I had actually gotten some sort of workout out of just the warm up, cool down and breathing exercise had me sold. The animal poses, sounds and references are fun. My 6 year old really enjoys this video and my 2 year old also tries to get in on the action. If you've never done Yoga before I would recommend watching the video first before attempting the exercises. This video is designed to let you skips around sections, the first two and last two are my favorites. If you are Yoga pro you may find these exercises too easy and a little boring, though there are some back bends and yoga flips that I could not complete.

It *is* fast paced, but it's not too difficult and easy to adjust to once you've done it a time or two. I loved the two person poses, relaxation kids can relate to, the explanation of ""namaste"", and the energetic music. The instructor's voice is fun, but soothing. A definite keeper for our family.",1311120000,20,430,4.2560975609756095
3694763,5,B001M9PBK2,"I love this video!  If you are looking for something that is very technical and step by step--this is not it.  Yoga For Families is structured, but still very free flowing and focuses on the most important aspect: time with your family.  In my opinion doing yoga with children is about building a healthy foundation of exercise, meditation, and a positive outlook on life, not so much mastering each pose.  Ingrid is very chill and enjoyable to watch.  I highly recommend this video!",1305763200,4,483,4.771084337349397
3694764,3,B001M9PBK2,a little disappointed in this dvd. din't give a lot ideas for teaching yoga to families. wasn't a total waste of time though--got a few good poses from it.,1301097600,,155,4.379310344827586
3694765,4,B001M9PBK2,"I really don't understand the bad reviews for this DVD.  Let's be realistic about expectations people.  I bought this for my friend's 5 year old boy.  He is high energy and sometimes emotional, especially on rainy days when he can't get to a park to run out his energy or be social with other kids.  With this DVD, he follows along and has a good time while managing to stay quiet and focusing on the instruction.

Yes, his head is sometimes up watching the DVD, just like I watch the instructor sometimes in yoga class.  No, he does not do the poses perfectly, just like I don't do any exercises as perfectly as the folks on any exercise DVD I own.

He gets exercise and he enjoys it quite a bit.  In fact, he has asked to do a yoga for kids class with the local parks & rec.  As far as I am concerned, this DVD is brilliant because the kid is learning to stretch and breathe rather than trying to blast his mom with his imaginary Star Wars Clone Wars laser.

If you expect your kid to be the next Rodney Yee by popping in this DVD... well I am sure there is a pose to help you work through that.",1291766400,233,1097,4.107981220657277
3694766,1,B001M9PBK2,"Living in the desert southwest prevents my children from getting adequate outdoor play during the summer so I was looking for a workout that would get my children moving and allow us to have fun as a family; this was NOT that workout.  The workout is way too fast paced for either a children's workout or for a beneficial yoga workout.  There is no instructional section for children, or their parents for that matter, to learn the correct poses.  And by the time you figure out what exactly the instructor wants you to do she has already moved on to the next series of poses. It was impossible to keep up with her. My children, ages 6 and 8, were frustrated by the fast pace of this video. I also found the pace difficult to keep up with and I am a certified fitness instructor!  The verbal cueing of the instructor was lacking so you have to keep both eyes on the TV to watch what she does - kind of hard while attempting to perform yoga poses. Do not waste your money on this video.  Me and my children do enjoy Denise Austin's Fit Kids workout, which is fast paced but fun and easy to follow.  Gymathtics is also a great children's workout.",1281484800,110,1144,4.322429906542056
3694767,4,B001M9PBK2,This video is fun and entertaining. The segments are good in length but a bit repetitive. Fun for weekly or bi-weekly use.,1279238400,,122,4.590909090909091
3694768,4,B001M9PBK2,I bought this DVD for my 6 and 4 year olds.  I agree that it is more like a stretching DVD with a little Yoga but still is very relaxing. The music and voice over is great and makes you want to watch it to relax.  Worked well with my kids.  They did identify well with the animal poses and sounds and when stretching without the DVD still make the sounds.  I really like the changes in scenery especially with the water.  Very soothing.  Great for parents and kids.,1271203200,16,465,4.168539325842697
3694769,1,B001M9PBK2,I returned it. There is little about yoga in this DVD. It is more like a quick passed strech excercise routine with sounds of elephants and other animals.,1269561600,12,154,4.535714285714286
3694770,4,B001M9PBK2,"I agree with others who've reviewed this video that it is a great video for families.  We just did the routine for the first time tonight and everyone enjoyed it.  We've got 3 kids (6, 8 and 10) and it was fine for all of them.  The poses were generally easy enough, yet not so easy that it didn't feel like a workout.  I have one minor complaint, and that was that the transitions betwen poses was sometimes unclear.  The second thing to note is that there are two segments that called for poses being done with a partner, which is great, except when you have an odd number of people.  It was a big challenging to do with 2 parents and 3 kids, since someone didn't have a partner.  We made it work, but it was somewhat uncomfortable and made the flow a bit awkward.  Otherwise, a good video, especially for the price!",1264204800,12,818,4.266233766233766

You can tell that the voice over instructions and sound effects were added to make this video appeal to a younger audience, but it was still too challenging for younger kids and did not hold their attention.",1262390400,38,311,4.362068965517241

The length of the workout is not too lengthy or too short for us. We love doing this together, and this is a great video for bringing families together in this way. And the instruction is simple enough for little kids to do it without an adult participating. I think this dvd should be a part of any child's activities collection.",1257811200,39,494,4.561797752808989

8320730,3,B001M9PBK2,"This was really geared for children younger than I was targeting. I think maybe 3-5yr old would be good. It was nice that all movements were described rather than just naming a yoga pose that may be unfamiliar to the viewer anyway. But, it does require a bit of balance, so the beginner adult I was also working with couldn't comfortably participate.",1511913600,,350,4.661290322580645

8320734,1,B001M9PBK2,I was looking for yoga for my 6 yr old to do on her own. The quality of this video is poor.  They also have exercises that require a partner to do - they don't offer any alternatives in case you either have an odd number or people or are doing it alone.  Keep looking for a kids yoga video.

8320736,5,B001M9PBK2,This was great for my 5.5 year old and me to do together... and it didn't require me to dress like a princess!  The moves are simple enough for me as a non-yoga adult and for her as a kid to accomplish even the first time around.  They make it fun by adding animal sound effects for different moves and showing the whole family doing the routine.  i like that we can either do the whole DVD or choose certain pieces.  Great alternative to going to the park on a rainy day!,1497398400,3,472,4.0978260869565215
