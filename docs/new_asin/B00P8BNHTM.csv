8686855,5,B00P8BNHTM,"Wow. Two girls becoming friends, growing up, trying to understand each other and life. Nobody is as good as Rohmer at just letting the viewer try on different viewpoints, to feel what it's like to experience life through another's eyes.  I guess life doesn't have enough explosions and fireballs for some people,  The theme here is kindness or indifference to strangers, and the results it brings;  if I didn't spell that out for you, you might not even notice, Rohmer has such a light touch. There are dial-up telephones and people smoking cigarettes on the street, but the questions the girls  struggle with don't feel dated at all, you could shoot the same script tomorrow it would be relevant.  Also, it's just a nice and rare portrait of young women that isn't dominated by the question of romance and men.  It's over before you know it, and you wish for another seven episodes.

PS:  this film is the rejoinder to all those people who say Rohmer's films are nothing but talk. The first and fourth adventures rely on silence for their impact.",1503792000,,1047,4.714285714285714
8686856,5,B00P8BNHTM,"While this episodic charmer isn't as well-known as many of Eric Rohmer's wonderful films, it certainly deserves to be. As previous posters have noted, he used the semi-improvised, serendipitous style of his masterpiece ""The Green Ray"" (AKA ""Summer"" in American release) in this collection of 4 short pieces about the meeting & friendship of nave country mouse Reinette & somewhat more sophisticated city mouse Mirabelle ... but those labels turn out to be a bit more nebulous than first expected. The first vignette, ""The Blue Hour"", is a quietly lyrical beauty in the same emotional territory as ""The Green Ray"" -- I could easily see it being expanded into a full-length film of its own. The following three vignettes are classic Rohmer: lots of smart, witty dialogue using mundane moments of everyday life as starting points that lead to complex ethical & philosophical concerns. Let me hasten to add, that dialogue is never boring or leaden; instead, it's enlivened by considerable humor, as we watch the bond developing between these two new friends. The entire air of these stories is almost that of eavesdropping on two very interesting people engaged with the world & its ever-shifting nuances. And again, all of this is done with a tone of effortless delight. I'll be watching this film many times again in the coming years -- highly recommended!",1473292800,,1354,5.022222222222222

8686860,4,B00P8BNHTM,"French actress Jessica Forde, who plays Mirabelle, reminds me a little of Danielle Panabaker. She is gorgeous in this film.
Eric Rohmer discovered a process of filmmaking he was pleased with while shooting Summer (The Green Ray); namely, shooting with a skeletal crew and allowing for his actors and location to dictate the direction of the story. He went into 4 Adventures of Reinette and Mirabelle with the same process and the result is charming. If you liked other Rohmer films, you'll allow yourself to be swept along by this film's laid-back, near plotless atmosphere and lengthy dialogues. Like the plays of Chekhov, nothing epic ""happens"" plot wise and the two characters don't grow or change or experience catharsis, but there is delight and comedy to be found in the behaviour of the characters. They go from wandering around the countryside to wandering around the city of Paris, and the manner in which they meet, dance, argue, moralise, steal, panic, and eventually cooperate are memorable, real and relatable. Fans of Mumblecore will be able to appreciate the ability of this simple film (Rohmer described it as his ""weekend film"") to effortlessly straddle the line between scripted, well-rehearsed scenes and improvised moments with happy accidents.",1423958400,4,1264,5.200980392156863
8686861,4,B00P8BNHTM,"A relatively unknown effort from 1987 by French director Eric Rohmer is slight but worthwhile. The four ""adventures"" of the title are really slight stories which our two protagonists go through, with some moral lesson to be learned.

In the first episode, the tough, sophisticated law student Mirabelle (Jessica Forde) goes to the countryside where she meets Reinette, a painter and naive country girl (played by Joelle Miquel, who is great).The next three episodes have Mirabelle returning to her native Paris bringing the innocent Reinette along her. A lot of the situations have to do on how the natural country honesty of Reinette is tested in the cynical big city. The episode I liked best was the second one, in which Reinette has to deal with a very rude waiter at a bar. The third one (which is mostly about how Mirabelle decides to help a shoplifter to Reinette's dismay) is weaker, but the final episode, in which Reinette tries to sell her paintings to an art dealer despite having put on herself a vow of silence, is fine.

Some actors from previous Rohmer movies (like Beatrice Romand, Marie Riviere and Fabrice Luchini) have bit parts here.",1416700800,2,1154,4.852791878172589
