But this video is way to good to not review and I only hope it gets released on DVD someday soon.

The video is all about various christmas scenes filmed through a video camera showing people celebrating the christmas season in so many ways across america. These scenes could be skiers in a nice 'winter wonderland' landscape that echos a 'white christmas' or scenes in neighbourhoods on how people are decorating and/or have decorated their neighbourhoods for the christmas season. There are scenes inside churches where christmas themes are underway ane there are scenes in people's homes with these people celebrating the christmas season in one way or another. And so many other scenes like carollers singing in a snowfall, the video footage should completely put one in the christmas spirit. And it's so great that this is done in a moving format via a video camera rather than still photos from a simple camera, it really let's you see the christmas fun happening before your eyes and the way it would look if you were there.

But the video is only half of it. There is a gorgeous soundtrack of religious christmas songs that I just like so much. My absolute favorite versions of O COME, O COME, EMMANUEL and O COME ALL YE FAITHFUL are on the soundtrack and they are done with a most wonderful chorus with orchestra backup. These two songs really do sound like songs that could have been recorded back in the 1950's and 1960's so you get a real nice traditioanl sound in them. Other absolutely wonderful christmas songs done in this chorus and orchestra style ar HARK! THE HERALD ANDGELS SING - WHAT CHILD IS THIS - SILENT NIGHT - JOY TO THE WORLD and perhaps a couple of others, all among the best if not the very best versions ever.

But the absolute best song done in this chorus and orchestra style and the best song on the VHS video is AWAY IN A MANGER. Combined with the video footage of outdoor christmas preparations with the end result of all the work for the first half of the song, then a church celebration of christmas for the second half, AWAY IN A MANGER really did alot for me. It's either my favorite version of the song or perhaps my second favorite version as I really like a version by the LIVING STRINGS too. But with both the music and video footage combined, it's my favorite version.

While the chorus and orchestra songs named above are the best songs on this VHS video, the other songs that don't have this chorus and orchestra style are still all fantastic. The songs are done by various other instruments such as a wonderful multiple guitar version of IT CAME UPON A MIDNIGHT CLEAR, various other instruments for other songs, and an orhcestra or two instrumental song(s) as well.

Every song and video footage is top-notch and this would be excellent viewing not only for yourself but for some nice general backgroung christmas entertainment when entertaining family/friends during the christmas season.

Combining the music with the video footage, this is the best christmas video I have ever seen, even better tha any christmas movie.

My most highest recommendation.",1241654400,5,3291,4.71304347826087
