8220179,5,B000VUXUOC,"Agreed. It's been a while since I've watched it through and trained each move, but I had purchased a number of bjj/submission wrestling training videos, and this one is top shelf. Bar none the most effective one for me. I honestly just watched each move, took shorthand notes (just a word or phrase to trigger the memory)  and then trained visually (and only visually) for maybe 10 minutes a day. I then rolled just once a week at a local facility that offered open-mat drop in no-gi training, and the results were stunning. I'm no black belt, and almost certainly never will be, but I was regularly tapping guys who had previously dominated me. His style is so simple--elegant may be the word--it relies on speed and no-bells-and-whistles type moves. Yet it's brilliant; he cuts to the chase, and taps guys so quickly, so seemingly effortlessly, and explains his system tremendously well. Highly recommended.",1452643200,2,909,4.902597402597403
