If he can only avoid detection by the Nazi Soldiers, the non-Jewish neighborhood kids/thugs and the ocassional path-crossings with others on the down-low.  If he can make it through, what will he face next?  What will be left of the world?

3063151,5,B00116GEFM,"Based on a true story during WWII in Warsaw, Poland, it is the survival of an eleven year old Jewish boy separated from his father and uncle who are taken to work camps, from which no one returns. He has three things to sustain him: his pet white mouse, Snow; the book Robinson Crusoe; the promise of his father that he will return. The Nazis regularly patrol the bombed out buildings in the ghetto looking for stray Jews who may have escaped their clutches. It's survival in its most basic form. This overlooked film tells the amazing story of the imagination and wits of this 11 year old as lives day to day trying to survive against all odds. Ala Robinson Crusoe, he establishes a loft for himself in a bombed out building and uses every instinct he has to stay alive and not get captured. A fascinating story and well done film. Great camera work and editing. The many twists and turns in the story will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end. Strong performance by Jordan Kiziuk as the 11 year old Alex.",1236384000,33,1022,4.38421052631579
3063152,5,B00116GEFM,"Based on the 1985 semi-autobiographical novel by Israeli author Uri Orlev, ""The Island on Bird Street"" portrays a young Jewish boy's attempts to survive in a ghetto in Poland during WW II. Young Alex [Jordan Kizuik] is reassured by his father Stefan[Patrick Bergin] that he will return to find Alex upon the war's end [Stefan had been selected for deportation]. Alex manages to escape a similar fate or worse by eluding the Nazis, with the help of his old uncle [Jack Warden] who sacrifices his life to save Alex.

Upon the ghetto's liquidation, Alex finds himself totally isolated and having to rely upon his wits to survive. His only constant companion is ""Snow"", a white mouse and Alex is also sustained by reading and re-reading passages from Robinson Crusoe [which also inspires him to survive using whatever resources he can find].

The drama of Alex's survival unfolds at a steady and suspenseful pace - Alex soon discovers that there are other Jewish refugees just like him who are hiding in the ravaged ghetto and time and again, he sees these Jews being caught by the Nazis whilst eluding capture himself. By sheer ingenuity, Alex builds a sort of treehouse for himself in one of the derelict buildings in the ghetto and stares out of a window out onto the other side of the ghetto, where Polish Gentiles lead relatively ordinary lives, seemingly untouched by the Nazi atrocities. Eventually, events necessitate Alex's venturing out to the Aryan side, and though he realises the risks, Alex's adventurous streak wins over his caution. He is also lucky in coming across Polish Gentiles who sympathise with his plight, such as a Catholic priest, a Polish doctor who works for the Polish underground, and even makes a friend, a young girl who is kind and accepting of Alex, even after finding out that he's a Jew.

Despite everything, Alex is adamant and determined to wait the war out in the remnants of the ghetto - and hoping against hope that he will be reunited with his father. Alex's resilience shines through every scene, as does his extraordinary courage, and the young actor that plays Alex has done an amazing job in bringing credibility to his role as the young boy with an indomitable spirit.

""The Island on Bird Street"" is a unique Holocaust drama as it focuses on one individual's experience, that of a young boy. Another Holocaust drama that is told from a young boy's viewpoint is ""Fateless"", about a young Hungarian boy's experiences in a concentration camp during WW II. Both movies are quality productions with strong leads and a compelling storyline. Note to parents and teachers : there are scenes of some characters including Alex drinking liquor, and also one scene with nudity [of Alex's entire back as he is taking a shower].",1233273600,8,2759,4.851380042462845
3063153,5,B00116GEFM,"This film is based on a true story that occurred in the Polish ghetto during the holocaust. It's a survival story of a boy who, at his father's instruction, faithfully waited for him at the ghetto until he returned from deportation to the concentration camps.
*The boy's close encounters with the Nazi's and Polish collaborators will put you into suspenseful dread. The days add up and many have advised him that his father's chances for returning were very poor. He's given options from sympathetic Poles who offer him a chance to leave the dangers of the ghetto at the risk of not being there when his father returns.
*Other holocaust films that I've viewed have ended tragically. This film is similar to the movie `Edges of the Lord'. Both of these films depict life in a world of evil and the good will of those who oppose it. `Edges of the Lord' has a poignant ending to it but this story has a happy ending.
*Today the boy portrayed in the movie is an internationally acclaimed writer. I highly recommend it for family viewing.",1224892800,4,1033,4.619565217391305
3063154,5,B00116GEFM,"Young Alex finds himself in a predicament when his Uncle is shot and his father hauled off by the Germans during WWII in occupied Poland. Afterall any Jewish children are carted off to work camps or death camps. He manages to illude the Germans and create his own island of refuge as he reads ""Robinson Cruesoe"". His white pet mouse ""Snow"" substitutes for Friday. His daily rummaging for food and clothing nearly gets him caught more than once so he decides to build his own treehouse of sorts. I highly recommend this movie. The whole cast is great in addition to Jordan Kiziak as Alex, we have Patrick Bergin as his father and Jack Warden as his Uncle. Based on a true story I found it compelling and fascinating. Good quality DVD with great replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""Joyeux Noel"" and ""Silent Night"".

3063170,5,B00116GEFM,"I will try to make an adequate review of this film which deserves high praise and seems to be outside peoples radar.

I have seen many many movies on or centered around the Holocaust, many of which did not measure up to being close to good film making. When I see, by far more reviews on The boy in Striped Pajamas than on this I wonder if today's society would rather see fiction or fact when it comes to the Holocaust in film genre. This I must point out IS a true story, a story that borders on amazement, luck and ingenuity beyond all else. This is a story of a boys personal triumph of survival in the face of evil, an evil determined to wipe he and all of his blood into extinction.

Meet Alex, an 11 year old of Jewish ancestry whom among millions were herded into ghettos and concentration camps. This is the story of one of those millions, a boy imprisoned in the Warsaw ghetto desperately seeking survival by any means necessary. When the ghetto is continuously emptied by German soldiers in their infamous ghetto roundups, the boy is left to fend for himself while his father is taken away from him during one of these roundups. Miraculously With a harrowing escape, Alex is able to hide and elude the Germans within the hidden places of the ghetto. You see a boy using his head and not making decisions based upon fear to hide amongst the ruins of a building blown apart, a building I believe that helped save his life as much as his own ingenuity did. Throughout the movie you see roundup after roundup, slowly emptying the Jews until it seems that Alex is all that is left but their was seemingly no end in site for Alex as he had to not only survive the Germans but also others of his own kind fighting to do the same.

In the end I believe you will be happy that you purchased this film, it has enough triumph and moments of humor to take your mind off (If even for a moment) the death surrounding Alex at all times. It is rare to see a film of this caliber in a genre that is flooded with movies that make you sad. I leave it for you to decide but I see this as a breath of fresh air in the category even if it, at times, seems impossible for a boy to be so inventive at his age",1333238400,2,2195,4.184397163120567

3297664,5,B00116GEFM,"This movie is about survival. For those of us who are spoiled by the luxuries of the modern world, it is hard to imagine a time when survival is so precarious. Even the simplest decisions could bring death. And through this dangerous time we follow a boy's life in the streets patrolled by Nazis. Survival seems impossible, yet we cheer the lad on and hope things turn out well for him. The real power of this film is the realization that life was like this during World War 2.",1363305600,,477,4.370786516853933

3297667,5,B00116GEFM,"I will try to make an adequate review of this film which deserves high praise and seems to be outside peoples radar.

I have seen many many movies on or centered around the Holocaust, many of which did not measure up to being close to good film making. When I see, by far more reviews on The boy in Striped Pajamas than on this I wonder if today's society would rather see fiction or fact when it comes to the Holocaust in film genre. This I must point out IS a true story, a story that borders on amazement, luck and ingenuity beyond all else. This is a story of a boys personal triumph of survival in the face of evil, an evil determined to wipe he and all of his blood into extinction.

Meet Alex, an 11 year old of Jewish ancestry whom among millions were herded into ghettos and concentration camps. This is the story of one of those millions, a boy imprisoned in the Warsaw ghetto desperately seeking survival by any means necessary. When the ghetto is continuously emptied by German soldiers in their infamous ghetto roundups, the boy is left to fend for himself while his father is taken away from him during one of these roundups. Miraculously With a harrowing escape, Alex is able to hide and elude the Germans within the hidden places of the ghetto. You see a boy using his head and not making decisions based upon fear to hide amongst the ruins of a building blown apart, a building I believe that helped save his life as much as his own ingenuity did. Throughout the movie you see roundup after roundup, slowly emptying the Jews until it seems that Alex is all that is left but their was seemingly no end in site for Alex as he had to not only survive the Germans but also others of his own kind fighting to do the same.

In the end I believe you will be happy that you purchased this film, it has enough triumph and moments of humor to take your mind off (If even for a moment) the death surrounding Alex at all times. It is rare to see a film of this caliber in a genre that is flooded with movies that make you sad. I leave it for you to decide but I see this as a breath of fresh air in the category even if it, at times, seems impossible for a boy to be so inventive at his age",1333238400,2,2195,4.184397163120567
3297668,5,B00116GEFM,"I finally found and purchased this wonderful little film about Alex who waits for his father, all alone, in the ghetto. His determination and vulnerability are well played by the young actor who is alone in front of the camera very often during the movie. I knew that film from an old VHS borrowed many years ago but it was with a French title and even if I would type the word ""Island"" at Amazon.com, it did not appear but finally I found it on Google and back again at Amazon.com which found it from a little shop elsewhere. And the magic worked again when I watched it ! Touching and inspiring story which is a true story by the way. If you like WW2 films and kids, you will love this film!",1327795200,,693,4.2180451127819545
3297669,5,B00116GEFM,"Really good movie.  Good Family movie too. Lots of suspense, and some great acting from the young boy who is the main character. Not Disney-like. It has some violence, but nothing that will stunt your growth. I recommend this movie.",1310083200,,232,4.8
3297670,3,B00116GEFM,"The video is based on a survivor account but seems more a tale of luck and narrow scrapes than of what I'd suspect was needed in the dull, slow, grinding task of hiding. In other words, while interesting the presentation didn't seem realistic enough. It's still worth seeing and watching however, and seems quite realistic enough in terms of the settings used.",1309996800,,360,4.82258064516129

Only one scene of a read nudity shot of the boy showering caught me off guard.  But the over all film was well done.",1257638400,2,281,4.226415094339623

8240890,5,B00116GEFM,"I love this movie. It's hard to find Holocaust films that are suitable for younger viewers, but I think this one would be OK for anyone over the age of 10 in my opinion. It clearly shows some of the things that happened during the Holocaust, and really conveys the atmosphere that other films do. But it does it without explicitly showing a lot of violence. It also shows a part of the Holocaust that is somewhat overlooked in film in my opinion. Most films about the Holocaust heavily feature the worst of it - the death camps themselves. The Island on Bird Street never ventures into the camps though, it remains in one of the walled off ghettos the Nazis forced Jews into before taking them to the death camps.",1489104000,,713,4.450381679389313

They are 10 and 12 yrs old and they liked it because you see it in the eyes of a child and how he struggles emotionally and physically to survive alone, waiting for his father to return. Its so suspenseful and the ending is beautiful!",1422230400,,321,4.111111111111111
8240896,5,B00116GEFM,"I have never seen such a movie that seemed so realistic and from a child's point of view.  It was as if we were with him in his hiding place.  It for me was very reminiscent of the movie the ""Pianist"".  This movie educates everyone who sees it.  I researched the true story of this young man and found there were some changes to the story which were not quite factual, but most of the story is intact in this movie.  What a brave boy, and a worthy undertaking by the film makers.  Thank you for making this movie. It attests to the strength of the human spirit and its yearning for survival in the most dire circumstances as the Holocaust and the Jewish Ghettos.",1421539200,2,662,4.256
