5994974,4,B00FKN1GJQ,This movie is a reminder that our  life can be more than getting EGO candy. It makes you laugh at our mistakes and cheer for our wins because this family is all of us. This is what going to the movies was before Chain Saw film.,1381881600,5,227,3.9347826086956523
5994975,5,B00FKN1GJQ,"Papadopoulos & Sons is about waking up to life. Who wouldn't want to be Uncle Spiros--""You don't have to be drunk to dance!""  I totally recommend it for Greeks, for everyone!",1381881600,,174,4.612903225806452
5994976,4,B00FKN1GJQ,"It has a simple, graceful plot and enough surprises to engage the viewer on many levels. Keep your eye on Theo. He's a delightful little scamp who brings to mind a very young Michael J Fox -- oozing intelligence and confidence with a touch of sweetness.",1381449600,4,253,4.521739130434782
5994977,5,B00FKN1GJQ,I found Papadopolous and Sons an extremely refreshing film on a dysfunctional family that bonds together over financial crisis. Also a great insight into the mind of a widowed single father and estranged brother relationship. It made me laugh and cry and transported me into London and I loved it and it made me want to tell everyone about this Greek/UK gem of a movie.,1381363200,,369,4.6923076923076925
5994978,5,B00FKN1GJQ,"A delightful film,  full of such likable characters,  a funny portrayal of a famliy's experiece after losing it all!  You fall in love with the Papadopoulos family!",1381363200,,164,5.0
5994979,5,B00FKN1GJQ,"Absolutely LOVE this movie! It's refreshing to see a film that actually portrays what is really important in life.  It's a funny, clever, feel-good film for the whole family.
I can't recommend it highly enough.",1381276800,4,210,5.0
5994980,2,B00FKN1GJQ,The movie ends up being very dull a majority of the time.  The story bounces around too much and it doesn't let the characters or the movie itself develop along.  There isn't much useful dialogue to keep this movie at an entertaining level.,1381104000,,240,4.558139534883721
5994981,4,B00FKN1GJQ,Enjoyable storyline and likable characters is what first comes to mind. I definitely recommend renting this at $3.99 you won't be disappointed!,1381017600,2,143,5.545454545454546
5994982,4,B00FKN1GJQ,"This movie was cute and funny, I really did enjoy it. Although I did not know any of the actors. I am glad I gave it a chance.",1380931200,3,126,3.5357142857142856

5994984,5,B00FKN1GJQ,Most touching.,1446249600,,14,6.5
5994985,5,B00FKN1GJQ,"I watched this film only because I admire Stephen Dillane's acting abilities so much. He has such an expressive face. He certainly put in to good use in this film!
  At the start of the film he is a successful, self-made businessman.  With an economic downturn and a poorly timed loan, he loses everything. This is particularly bad as he is a widower with three kids, all of whom are still dependent upon him.
  Starting over, while terrifying, may turn out to be the best thing that has happened to him and his family. I found this film to be very entertaining.  The actors who played the children also did a great job.  The boy who played Theo was particularly endearing.",1445817600,,673,4.512396694214876

5994999,5,B00FKN1GJQ,"In the great scheme of things, Greek lives are never dull. They sing, they dance, they make money. But sometimes things get convoluted. Happiness is not always found in that pot-o-gold under the end of a rainbow! Excellent casting and morals. Great for the whole family!",1431648000,,270,4.891304347826087

5995003,4,B00FKN1GJQ,Slow to start but turns out being a really good movie more about life than anything else.,1428278400,,89,4.294117647058823

5995006,4,B00FKN1GJQ,Far fetched but fun,1426636800,,19,4.0
5995007,3,B00FKN1GJQ,"I think Papadopoulos and Sons was a sad story of a family with too much money. The children were spoiled, the father was arrogant, the brother was a toss up between a saint and a reformed sinner. They did not get along when the rich brother lost everything and had to move int to the ""Fish and Chips"" shop the brothers owned together. The family was not welcomed back into the neighborhood, but they did persevere and finally was accepted in the neighborhood and accepted their fate as owners of a ""Fish and Chips"" shop.",1425427200,,520,4.484210526315789
5995008,5,B00FKN1GJQ,I could identify with the story as in Australia many Greekellines operated the fish and chips shops. The story is excellently acted and has a pertinent plot in these economically troubled times. Overall I would recommend viewing as I am definitely going to see it again in the near future.,1425340800,,289,4.8
5995009,4,B00FKN1GJQ,A look into the Greek psyche. Join them in laughter and dance on the floor of life's disappointments.,1423526400,,101,4.666666666666667
5995010,5,B00FKN1GJQ,This is a good movie for the entire family.  There is a message this movie is conveying which is that being a rich person isn't everything.  What matters is being happy & having joy in one's life.,1422576000,,196,4.27027027027027
5995011,5,B00FKN1GJQ,"Some people thought this was a predictable and sappy movie, and it was, but the characters made it all so believable that I fell in love with the whole movie!",1421452800,,158,4.3
5995012,4,B00FKN1GJQ,"Good story, especially if you've lived life, lost, struggled and perhaps had the benefit of family.",1421280000,,99,5.25
5995013,5,B00FKN1GJQ,I loved this movie would love a series made of this with the same people and no changes and the way they do the script that would be awesome,1420070400,,140,3.8620689655172415
5995014,5,B00FKN1GJQ,"Really cute, thoughtful film.  Worth your time.",1418083200,,47,5.714285714285714
5995015,5,B00FKN1GJQ,"Finally, a movie depicting the family as the most important in one's life. There's humor and sadness but in the end, it's all about family.
If you don't get the gist of this movie's meaning,then you are truly a lost soul. I even saw a bit of Zorba the Greek in one of the characters. Just a delightful movie and timely one considering the plight of many families in this financial crises that is upon us.",1417219200,,404,4.328947368421052
5995016,4,B00FKN1GJQ,"I liked this movie very much. I'm not a professional director but I am a strong one and I've always believed that the weakest most predicatable script can be quite successful when put into the right hands and cast well. NOT that the script is too bad. A bit flowery and predictable but it had many strengths, too. But it is the performances that make this movie succeed.
 I am a sucker for stories about various ethnicities, although, this one seems to be a little ... whitewashed? ... somehow? I think that's happening with the passing of time because this isn't the first performing arts experience I've said that about. Maybe it's a politcal correctness thing. Although the uncle ..... a bit of a sterotype but done well.
 Oh! And I DO love Selina Cadell! VERY diverse actor as the majority of British actors seem to be.
 It's true. It is a ""feel good"" movie and I suggest watching it when you're in a not-too-critical mood and ... well ... want to feel good.",1416268800,,962,4.517241379310345
5995017,5,B00FKN1GJQ,Well done characterization . A poignant story of a rags to riches and back to rags scenario. Obvious moral i.e. riches do not make you happy but neither does poverty. Enjoyable family movie.,1415491200,,190,4.787878787878788
5995018,5,B00FKN1GJQ,Loved the message  a little unreal at the very end but an uplifting and funny film.,1415404800,,83,4.1875
5995019,5,B00FKN1GJQ,"I loved this movie.  It told the story of a rich, miserable man who had lost contact with what made him happy in his life but found true happiness after losing his wealth when he was forced to move back in and reopen his fish and chips shop with his 3 children and his older brother.",1414627200,,283,4.053571428571429

5995024,4,B00FKN1GJQ,This is a nice little feel-good movie. There aren't many surprises and it has a happy ending. Sometimes that's all I want in an hour's entertainment.,1410998400,,149,4.769230769230769
5995025,4,B00FKN1GJQ,not your regular rags to riches movie but it is a rags to riches with riches of the heart not of the wallet,1408579200,,107,3.6956521739130435
5995026,4,B00FKN1GJQ,"As a disclaimer, I love feel-good movies. However, some movies of this genre leave me feeling as if I have sacrificed a few brain cells in the act of watching. This was not the case with Papadopoulos & Sons. While some of characters were static, Harry in particular was well-developed and his actions throughout the movie were believable and did not seem contrived. This saved the movie from seeming formulaic. Thoroughly enjoyable, left me with a smile on my face!",1407801600,,465,4.825
5995027,5,B00FKN1GJQ,"I've been wanting to see this movie for quite some time and I've finally gotten around to it, it was great! It tells a wonderful story about, in my opinion, what it is important in life.. your family and being happy. I highly recommend it to everyone, you won't be disappointed.",1407369600,,278,4.470588235294118
5995028,2,B00FKN1GJQ,It started out well but lost momentum half way through the movie.  Disappointed.  The music on the other hand was great.,1407024000,,120,4.666666666666667
5995029,3,B00FKN1GJQ,A very enjoyable comedy?,1406505600,,24,5.25

5995031,3,B00FKN1GJQ,it's there so your mind doesn't have to think much and that's ok. romantic funny a little off beat but who doesn't like that?,1403740800,,125,4.25
5995032,4,B00FKN1GJQ,This is a good movie to watch if you need a pick me up.  I did have some difficulty putting the characters together and where they fit in.  Maybe that was the Director's intent.,1403308800,,177,4.176470588235294
5995033,3,B00FKN1GJQ,"The movie was fine, fairly predictable and if Stephen Dillane ever did smile, I must have missed it. But that's his way of acting. He is such a wonderful actor, especially in, ""Welcome to Sarajevo,"" and another reason I purchased this DVD is because his son, Frank Dillane, is also in it playing his son. I loved the relationship between them because you know that they are actually father and son. The ending is sweet because you get to see Stephen Dillane actually dance! And actually be happy with his life..............",1401321600,,523,4.758241758241758
5995034,3,B00FKN1GJQ,"...however, moves slowly. Typical story of immigrant family doing well abroad but in the process losing its sense of ""family"".",1401321600,,126,5.35
5995035,4,B00FKN1GJQ,It was a reasonably good movie but pretty predictable if you have Greek heritage. Good to see some start up producer reasonably successful,1401148800,,138,5.043478260869565
5995036,5,B00FKN1GJQ,"Charming. While the story of someone who is rich and loses it all and then figures out what's truly important in life isn't a new concept, this movie portrayed this idea in a very heartfelt and genuine manner. The interaction of the father and his children was genuine, rather than overexagerated, as some movies tend to do. The brother/uncle character was larger that life, but suited the overall tone of the movie. His purpose was to shake up their narrow view of the world and show them an alternative future, and in this he succeeded. My entire family really enjoyed this movie!",1399852800,,582,4.715686274509804
5995037,5,B00FKN1GJQ,"I was just looking for something simple and British to watch while organizing some stuff, saw this and thought it sounded interesting.
I had no idea how great a film it was going to to be! It is touching, and even though there is tragedy it stays lighthearted. I am so happy I came upon it!

I highly recommend watching it!",1399680000,,323,4.295081967213115
5995038,4,B00FKN1GJQ,"This movie had enough pathos, fun, and lessons to keep me interested.  No matter how often I read something or see a movie about what is really important or what real success is, it never gets old.  We need to be continually reminded!",1397088000,,234,4.4186046511627906
5995039,2,B00FKN1GJQ,"It's a little story about success lost and redeemed. Dillain under acts and the guy who plays his brother overdoes it. The juxtaposition of the two doesn't work in my opinion. Wasted a little time, but thankful I didn't pay $10 to see it in a theatre.",1396742400,,251,4.361702127659575

5995044,4,B00FKN1GJQ,This movie defines success not in a monetary measure but rather what makes you happy.  A must see for the whole family.  Don't forget the popcorn.,1389830400,,146,4.576923076923077
5995045,3,B00FKN1GJQ,"This is a heartwarming story of family emotions where hurt feelings are presented, conflicts are slowly worked through, and the deep love of family endures against everything.  Great for family viewing or just wholesome entertainment.  The drawbacks include a weak script, very limited production skills, a message that was way too obvious from the start, and acting that was mediocre.  The whole film could have been less than 30 minutes in length with no loss of story value.  You can't be much disappointed since nothing offensive is presented, but you also might not be strongly impressed either.",1389657600,,600,5.154639175257732

5995047,3,B00FKN1GJQ,Not terrific but certainly fun and never boring. Does not drag and brings some smiles. Touching in a few places.,1388707200,,112,4.65
5995048,5,B00FKN1GJQ,"Papadopoulus & Sons celebrates family and gains perspective from loss to remember where things started and where the future may take those who have faith. It's a comedy, but it's also charged with the most relatable and heart-warming aspects of the human experience. Like many independent films, it goes beyond the traditional happy ending to leave a lasting impression on any viewer, combining sorrow with joy to create something unequivocally real and cathartic.",1388361600,,464,5.36986301369863

5995052,5,B00FKN1GJQ,"CLEAN, REAL, EMOTIONAL, WONDERFUL!
I stumbled upon this movie by just wanting to watch a comedy while cooking dinner!  It was posted under ""Comedy"" genre.  However, after being glued to the kitchen TV while unable to continue fixing  dinner, I watched it all the way to the end. What an emotional climax!  I was living and feeling and dancing with them, while in tears.  I really enjoyed  watching such a down to earth, true to life story unfold, with its ups and downs.  I loved the definition of success: ""to feel joy""!  Pretty good!  My second favorite definition after my life long first one found in Joshua 1:8.  In a time when fantasy, horror, sexual immorality is on the top of the movie making, it was quite refreshing and just plain wonderful to watch this movie.  I can't wait for my family to get home and watch it again.  I think I am going to order some fish and chips for dinner, and I'll make some popcorn, too!
 I will wholeheartedly recommend it to all my friends and loved ones.",1386028800,,996,4.466666666666667
5995053,5,B00FKN1GJQ,"Surfing my list of four billion titles in my Netflix streaming queue one night, I wasn't sure what I was looking for until 'Papadopoulos & Sons' crossed my eye. I loved the description, so gave it a try - and less then two hours later, still sniffling and swiping tears from my eyes, this became one of my favorite films of the year.

A British film about a wealthy Greek widower in England who loses it all in a banking disaster, the film stars Stephen Dillane as Harry Papadopoulos, a food industry giant who suddenly finds himself broke ... then forced to move himself and his three kids both out of their mansion and their affluent lifestyle. With nowhere else to go, Harry turns to his estranged brother, the flighty vagabond Spiros (Georges Corraface) for help. The boys grew up, before their father died, helping to run the Three Brothers Fish & Chip Shop, which in recent years Spiros allowed to run into the ground until forced to close it. With nowhere else to go, Harry moves his family into the apartment above the restaurant, and tries to help Spiros get the restaurant going again, for the income (Harry wants no part of the family business anymore; he's above that now).

The film is funny, heartwarming (yeah, I know, a corny term - but it's true), and ultimately about how the choices we make are nothing compared to the choices that choose us. I LOVED IT, and also got a quote from it that goes through my mind to this day, weeks later: ""Success is the joy you feel."" A truly wonderful, touching film about life, and how when life DOES force us to make lemons into lemonade ... sometimes the lemonade is better. If I could hug a movie, this would be the one.",1385683200,8,1676,4.491803278688525

5995056,3,B00FKN1GJQ,"I think it can be succinctly put that this indeed a ""Feel Good"" movie. However that in and of itself is no criticism, as there are both good and bad ""feel good"" movies. This one while in some ways predictable is definitely in the ""good"" category. It has finely tuned and developed characters, you get to know them all in due time and they all are empathetic if a bit stereotypical. But, you care for them and you end up caring for the outcomes......the movie can serve as a learning tool for all of us; your never too big to fail, you can bond with your neighbors, and of course a family is a wonderful asset. So, do see it and settle in for some laughs and smiles and don't ask too much of it and I think you will enjoy the experience of stepping out of a big Hollywood blockbuster and into an independent film with earnest intent.",1385337600,,832,4.238993710691824

Great casting, writing, and especially Directing.  The camera angles were exceptionally simplistic and supremely logical in their composition.  Truly artful.  I was blown away!",1385078400,,406,5.0
5995058,3,B00FKN1GJQ,"A nice enough premise, but weak on plot and dialogue.  I fast forwarded through some sections and that made it okay.  Seriously though three montage scenes set to Greek music is three too many!  Really. Put some effort into making a film and not stringing together a batch of scenes or images because you can't manage to actually come up with an actual plot point.",1384646400,,364,4.569230769230769
5995059,4,B00FKN1GJQ,"I was particularly drawn in by the music and did get a very prompt reply when I inquired about where to find it. The movie itself was refreshing to watch, and you need to watch it with the European sense of humor! Well done!",1384473600,,224,4.113636363636363

It's not a shoot-em-up, or a thriller (so not everyone will love it), but it's a well-made film (good acting, directing, music, etc.) that will make you cry (I cried more than once, but I am a total sap), it will make you laugh and it will leave you feeling inspired to go out there and get 'em. (Whatever ""'em"" is for you.) Watched it one weekend and then watched it again with my family the following weekend.

5995065,5,B00FKN1GJQ,"I was in the mood for a feel-good movie and came across this. Oh boy! What a wonderful and stunning piece of work! A real film with depth: Beautifully acted, beautiful storyline and beautifully executed. I was riveted from the start - the usual cold scenes of a wealthy, detached father morphs into a real emotional, touching embrace of family as he realizes, through a financial catastrophe, what the real value of life is. It juxtaposed the no-nonsense, practical and responsible mind-set of the wealthy father with the carefree, sometimes bungling, sometimes uncouth but full of love and open-hearted uncle - and you see who the real rich man is. It measures the real value of success so often forgotten in this Wall St. climate of dog eat dog. It shows that even if you don't have family, you can create one with people all around you with love and thrive in your own warm support system.

I thought the film was intelligently, sensitively and powerfully written and directed. I had to look up Marcus Markou who both wrote and directed this film, because I had never heard of him before. I now hope to hear much of him. I think he has a bright future ahead of him if he keeps up this quality filming. I would recommend this to anyone who wants more than just blood, gore, car chases and thrills - someone who wants to engage their intellect as well as their souls and get back in touch with their humanity. I gave it five stars because I want the Papadopoulos family to be real, and I want them to adopt me - that is how good this movie is.",1383436800,9,1544,4.455830388692579

5995068,1,B00FKN1GJQ,"I could barely sit through this, I only did because I paid for it! It was very slow, barely a story, and if you are Greek and thinking this will be a nice story about Greeks you will be disappointed. I did a lot of eye rolling.",1382832000,2,227,3.851063829787234
5995069,5,B00FKN1GJQ,"What a good movie with an important message. I have never seen Stephen Dillane in a weak role and he absolutely shines in this movie. How refreshing to see the characters develop and move into their new lives. Dillane is so fun to watch as he appears to be sincerely perplexed at the turn in his business and when the opportunity to move in another direction is presented, you can see the indecision hounding him. Georges Corraface is perfect in his role as is Thomas Underhill. Definitely family entertainment. I wish there were more selections such as Papadopoulos & Sons.

5995071,5,B00FKN1GJQ,"This presents a quandary, it's sappy and predictable, there are no surprises, the characters are pleasant and the movie, directed by Marcus Markou, is mildly diverting. Our 2013 Seattle International Film Festival audience was a bit testy after sitting through such a non-artistic entry from the UK. On the other hand, Yours Truly had a very nice time. I LIKE sappy and predictable, so I was happy.

We start in a gorgeous white-on-white mansion, with a widower, his housekeeper and his three children, two are teenagers and one is nine. Their life is one of entitlement and ease. His lawyer's office is in the green glass building fondly called ""The Gherkin"" in London. (It really DOES look like a pickle!)

Here are the actors and their characters:
  * Stephen Dillane (""Game of Thrones"") is Harry Papadopoulos, a phenomenally successful businessman, ready to build a shopping center in London when the bottom falls out of international banking.
  * Georgia Groome (""The Holding"") is his daughter Katie, forced to re-write her requirements for friends.
  * Frank Dillane (""Harry Potter"") plays his son James, who wants to be a botanist, NOT a businessman, and yes, he really IS Stephen Dillane's son.
  * Thomas Underhill (""Mother's Milk"") is his son Theo, who can see patterns and trends, loves to create order from chaos, and would LOVE to go into business with his father.
  * Georges Corraface (""Without Borders"") is Spiros, his ebullient brother, who never holds a grudge, is always upbeat and a little overdue to make amends for his past shortcomings, per the ninth step of his AA program. He had been in the fish-and-chip business with his brother back ""in the day.""
  * Cosima Shaw (Lots of TV) is Sophie, a lovely legal assistant assigned to negotiate a new mortgage which will allow Harry to reclaim his empire.

Can you see where this is going? No bad guys, no sweaty bodies, no gunplay or vehicular mayhem, just decent people trying to sort out their lives with no blowie uppie stuff. And YES, I found it pleasing. What a pleasant surprise to find it available on Amazon!",1381968000,28,2085,4.850282485875706
5995072,5,B00FKN1GJQ,"We loved it.  Very well done.  We liked the characters and the evolution of change in their lives as they adjust to their lifestyle change.  Some adjust easier than others but the journey is interesting and ultimately they find themselves happier,  communicating as a family and loving what they are doing.  How refreshing to enjoy this movie with no special effects, no killing, no violence just a great feel good story that makes you smile and feel good as you leave the theatre.  We highly recommend it.

8616376,5,B00FKN1GJQ,"Briefly, this movie concerns two brothers and a downturn of fortunes. One brother is a free spirit who is living his dream in the United States. The other brother found his financial dream in England only to find have his business fail in wake of the financial crisis in 2008. Faced with these financial difficulties, the brothers decide to enter into business together, which is fraught with difficulties, because they have polar opposite personalities and are trapped by the past.

This is a simple plot device which has been used before in other contexts and could have easily descended into parody. It works well here, however, because this plot serves as a metaphor for the financial problems currently experienced by the nation of Greece with the European Union. The type of characters found in the two brothers are somewhat formulaic and could have sunk the movie into the depths of mediocrity. The acting displayed by Stephen Dillane and Georges Corraface in the two brothers, however, are strong and hold this movie up despite a relatively weak script. This movie is worth watching and holds its own.",1473206400,,1109,4.962365591397849

8616382,3,B00FKN1GJQ,"Set in and around suburban London, PAPADOPOULOS AND SONS focuses on the fortunes of Harry (Stephen Dillane) as he falls from being an award-winning self-made millionaire into a fish-and-chip-shop owner.  Along the way he re-encounters brother Theo (Thomas Underhill) with whom he has not spoken for several years, and discovers that family loyalty and  daily industry are more important ingredients for happiness rather than filthy lucre.

A familiar tale, no doubt; but one that is given particular poignancy by its background.  The Papadopoulos family came to Britain in the wake of the Cyprus civil war in 1974; only two of the three brothers survived, and their childhood experiences still scar their adult lives.  The fact that a Turkish Cypriot family, headed by Hasan (George Savvides) owns a kebab shop opposite the fish-and-chip-shop is something rather disturbing for the Papadopulos family, reminding them of past conflicts.

Yet director Marcus Markou seems uncertain as to whether he wants to explore the family's traumas in detail or to exploit the material for knockabout laughs.  Harry's business associate Rob (Ed Stoppard) comes across as a figure of fun, so obsessed with money that he cannot appreciate any other values.  In the end employee Sophie (Cosima Shaw) an American divorcee becomes so tired of Rob's posturing that she quits her job and opts for a life of drudgery in the chip shop.

In the end all turns out well, as the family, their friends and the Turkish Cypriots indulge in a Greek dance in the street outside the shop.  But we cannot help but feel that Markou has shied away from exploring his material and his characters in greater depth so as to provide a happy ending.",1449360000,,1708,5.024822695035461
