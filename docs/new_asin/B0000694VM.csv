1730439,4,B0000694VM,"While I didn't like the whole Feng shui ... or whatever its called episodes i believe that the RK series ended very nicely. I had to buy this dvd just for episode 95, because the boxsets i bought only went to episode 94... That really made me angry, but i belive that it was worth dishing out 15 dollars to see Kenshin and Karou finally start sharing their feelings. However i do have to say something that is bothering me. All the people who gave this dvd a bad review because it was so different from the manga. If you don't like the way the anime is, then stick to your manga. Dont compare the two. Either you read or you watch. Also i think everyone should go see samurai x reflection. Because for fans of the ANIME that is the ultimate depressing ending.",1057795200,7,759,4.277777777777778
1730440,2,B0000694VM,"First of all, i really like Rk, but this ending was weak. After the Kyoto arc, the series bombed out. When i finished watching the last episode, i said, ""what?! that's it. what kind of ending is that???"" They don't even tell you what happens to the characters and whether or not Kauru and Kenshin ever get together. that really made me mad. i would suggest viewers buy the kyoto arc and finish there. it would be a waste of perfectly good money to by these last episodes. just rent them or something....you'll regret buying these unless you are an upmost devoted RK fan. Overall it was very diappointing watching my favorite series end this way.",1055289600,5,645,4.568965517241379
1730441,1,B0000694VM,"DO NOT mistake these terrible filler episodes (from the end of the Kyoto arc to this DVD) to be the ending of the rurouni kenshin series!!  To see the TRUE ending that was actually based off of the RK manga, reserve a copy of the Samurai X: Reflection DVD that is to be released March 25th!  This is the last OVA of the kenshin series, and the real ending!
DO NOT waste your money on the filler DVDs.",1044057600,4,400,4.115384615384615
1730442,3,B0000694VM,"It truly pains me to give this DVD such a rating as I am a diehard fan of Ruroken. However, this arc hardly follows the rest of the Rurouni Kenshin theme. Most of the time when a particular enemy used something like ""magic"" to attack, he was quickly proven to only have been using some sort of illusion or trickery. In this arc they go against that and the enemies now seem to have real ""magic"" which they use with some sort of ruler looking devices that they hold up. The cast of Ruroken end up having to fight a person who is capable of making lakes boil, and trees to change season's instantly and go from green to autumn leaves. That and Kaoru and Yahiko hardly show up, as Kaoru becomes sick and Yahiko looks after her. I almost thought that I was looking at another anime when I watched this.
However, if you are a big Ruroken fan, I suggest you watch it anyway. There is a small Kenshin & Kaoru bit (Kaoru gets hurt, and Kenshin has to find some sort of special water that will cure her from the ""magical attack"" she suffered)
However, episode 95 should be the absolute ending episode.  Kenshin and Kaoru go visit a grave on an island somewhere for a day. (no, not Tomoe's grave)  While I found the ending a slight let down because there was no significant romantic part, there is slight romance and it truly is a happing ending without the feeling of finality (if this makes sense).  If you get this DVD at all, get if for episode 95, in Japan it was never even aired on TV, people had to buy the VHS tape seperately.
Again, if you like Ruroken I suggest you buy it anyway because it's the last arc, just don't expect too much from it, afterall, this arc wasn't at all part of the original manga/comic by Watsuki.",1029110400,10,1721,4.28923076923077

7965141,5,B0000694VM,"Kenshin Himura was an assassin for the imperialist army during the revolution. At the turning point something happened and he just vanished. 11 years later he encounters a girl named Kaoru while wandering through Tokyo. He saves her life just before she is killed trying to fight a notorious murderer. He begins living with her at her dojo. They gain new friends and have many adventures, but one day ghosts from Kenshin's murderous past come back to haunt him. His gentle nature gives way to a murderous side and Kaoru must stand by him to keep him from changing forever.

This is the end of the Kenshin TV series. The Feng Shui users have been defeated and Jinpu says his goodbye. After that Kenshin and Kaoru take a romantic trip to the ocean to conclude the series. It's not the end of the story though. Samurai X Reflections is the theatrical conclusion.

Rurouni Kenshin is an amazing anime series. Maybe even one of the best ever made. It has everything. Action, comedy, drama, suspense, romance, and mystery are all common themes in this anime. The amazing part is that it is based loosely on actual historical characters. The animation, voice acting, soundtrack, and plot are all very well done. There are dozens of great and unforgettable characters. This anime is a legend, and is a must see for any anime fan. It's also pretty family friendly. It has violence, but it's pretty conservative. All in all this show owns.",1353196800,,1429,4.734939759036145
7965142,2,B0000694VM,"I had gone for years unsure on how the series ended. The final story arc of the series is very different from other story arcs in the series. Rurouni Kenshin is a very good animated series and the animation is still excellent in this volume. The content however is a bit too far fetched even for this series.

 The Feng Shui arc seems a bit too supernatural compared to rest of the series. Most of the ""magic"" sword techniques felt fitting to the series whereas this moving of chi did not.

 I had bought the DVD for the very last episode but it was not as fulfilling as promised. It wanders a bit randomly with no set destination in mind and then just ends on an open-ended note. It was as if to say ""And they continued living."" But what I was looking for was a relief of the long-standing romantic tension between characters.

 If you want to complete a collection or see the last episode, consider buying this. However, I feel that the OAVs or original manga provide a more satisfying ending than the TV series.",1244505600,,1014,4.39572192513369
7965143,2,B0000694VM,"Although it is true that there is an ending in the manga series, Samurai X ""Reflection"" goes beyond that and gives a fitting and unforgettable end to a truly meaningful series.

I myself dislike these fillers dvds and wish that they had animated the jinchu arc, but, nonetheless, Samurai X will give all rurouni kenshin fans a deeper understanding of the series and give a thorough closure that no one will regret to watch.

Samurai X, compared to the somewhat lighter and occasionally satirical normal Rurouni Kenshin anime, is more serious and real. The feelings expressed in it are all within the range of believability and thus more meaningfull and allows one to feel the delicacy and importance of the moment.

Samurai X, ""Reflection"" gave an excellent closure to the unforgettable series and truly is a heart-touching ending. I highly recommend that one turns to Samurai X ""Reflection"" as the ending for this unforgettable series.",1185062400,,936,5.025806451612903
7965144,4,B0000694VM,"While this is not the way I had expected Kenshin to end, I must say, it was better than the Black Knight Saga. And, please, don't be foolish and skip out on this just because people say it's no longer Kenshin standards. As it may not be be Season 1 and Season 2, it's still great. People who didn't like it were just too spoiled the absolute amazing 1st 2 Seasons. If you watched up to the Shi-Shi O Saga, and stopped after, then... I must URGE you to continue. Overall, Rurouni Kenshin goes down with a legendary status in my book. My favorite Anime, along with a few others. Watch in this order: Rurouni Kenshin - Trust & Betrayal, Rurouni Kenshin T.V., and Rurouni Kenshin - Reflection, if you are new to the Anime. All of Kenshin is simply divine. Don't miss it, friend.",1154563200,,774,4.344827586206897
7965145,4,B0000694VM,"I first have to say that Rurouni Kenshin is one of the greatest anime series ever. All of them were good the ova's samurai x were good, the wandering samurai arc and the legend of kyoto arc were perfect, even the motion picture was good. But I was not completly sure about the tales of the meiji arc it looked sort of weird and confusing but it was still rurouni kenshin and I respected that. There are five episodes in this DVD and all of them were good but weird and confusing. My favorite episode is the last one with Kenshin and Kaoru stuck together that was a pretty good episode because again it shows how much Kaoru cares for Kenshin. I don't really think that this is the last episode I mean I think that they are still dubbing the other arc that was supposed to come out the ""Jinchu arc"" because the real episode is when Kenshin and Kaoru were supposed to get married and have a son named Kenji.
If anyone happen's to know if anymore kenshin arcs coming out in the future please contact me.",1087257600,4,999,4.291005291005291
7965146,4,B0000694VM,"""Rurouni Kenshin: End Song"" presents the final five episodes of the Japanese anime about the masterless, roving samurai named Himura Kenshin.  The first four episodes cover the rest of the Feng Shui story arc that began in the previous episode and then we have the final episode where the question of whether the wandering samurai is going to start wandering again or what:
Episode 91, ""The Magic of Feng Shui: Kamiya Dojo is Targeted,"" involves a lot of exposition to explain what is going on with all those pentegrams on the map of Tokyo.  It seems that at the start of the Tokugawa Shogunate a series of shrines were built by Ieyasu Tokugawa (circa 1603) that helped to define triangles in which evil spirits would be sealed.  The triangles were joined to make penegrams which make them even more powerful and provide a clean chi for the great city.  The ""Circle of Eternity,"" defined by Mt. Fuji, the gulf of Edo, and the two great rivers, has been built and maintained by the Wind Clan.  But the Water Clan wants their own circles and has returned to try and destroy the Circle of Eternity so that what happened to China with the Opium War will happen to Japan as well.  So basically the fate of the nation is once again at stake for Kenshin and the gang, this time from the threat of a form of Chinese astrology.
Episode 92, ""Tokyo Under Martial Law: The Deadly Ryu Myaku"" is about the effort to defeat the giant ""dragon"" of the Wind Clan, while Episode 93, ""The Enemy Awaits in Senjo Gahara: In Search of the Jade Crest"" actually has a key personal element as Kenshim finally resolves to live with his past, which has key consequences for the Hitokiri Battousai  and his reverse blade sword.  The battle climaxes in Episode 94, ""The Elegey of Wind and Water: A Last Desperate Effort.""  The Feng Shui story arc is a bit over the top, but this is what happens when you keep trying to up the ante with each story line.  By fans of ""Rurouni Kenshin"" have already agreed that the Kyoto story arc was the highlight of the series.
Then we come to the end of the road with Episode 95, ""End of Wanderings: The Bond of Scarlet and Azure is in the Sound of the Sea.""  As the title indicates, this is a rather poetic ending to the series in an episode that uses film for some interesting effects (including having characters animated into the film).  The episode has two functions, the first being to resolve the situation between Kenshin and Kaoru, and the second to be a curtain call for the cast of characters.  The latter takes away from the former a bit as we get flashbacks on series highlights, but the episode does achieve a sense of the lyrical on how it resolves the situation.  I was afraid they were going to use some comic bit again to do this, as with Sanosuke and Megumi, but they actually come up with a small series of moments to play out the end song, and the final line spoken in the series is both appropriately simple and important.
I was rather surprised to find out that these 95 episodes all took place within half a year, but they beyond the specific period of the Meiji Restoration I was not paying attention to the dates.  So when we find out at the end that it is late summer in the 11th year of the Meiji (1878), there was no special significance to me.  There is an impressive set of liner notes for this final DVD edition along with the usual sprinkling of outtakes and some trailers.
Originally published in ""Weekly Shonen Jump Japan"" in 1994, ""Rurouni Kenshin"" was created in manga form by Nobuhiro Watsuki and ended up being told in 28 manga volume, these 95 episodes, and two OVA specials.  The problem was that Watsuki was still working on completing the Jinchuu story arc when the Kyoto arc animation was done and anime original episodes were created as filler, which is why the ratings for the show plummeted in Japan and why we see such a noticeable drop off in quality in the Tales of the Meiji episodes.
Still, overall this is one of the better anime series out there, despite its problem with coming up with really good story arcs after the Kyoto high point.  The characters, the attention to strategic details in the sword fights, and the backdrop of Japanese history (not to mention the comic elements) make it stand out apart from its competition.  As much as I was happy to see a resolution to the romantic subplot of the series I was more impressed that the reverse sword idea came to an appropriate conclusion as well.",1080172800,22,4461,4.491965389369592
7965147,2,B0000694VM,"I love rurouni kenshin. I loved the tokyo, and the kyoto arcs. I even liked the christian, and the black night stories (what can i say, im a sucker for romance). But this is just plain lame. Im not going to restate the story because everyone already has. But magical feung shuei people are one of the lamest ideas for villans, i wish that they would have ended w/ the black knight story so i wouldent have been so dissapionted.
Another good idea for the last 5 episodes would have been good old fashioned funny kenshin episodes. I would recomend this for hardcore fans of kenshin, like myself, just don't expect to be wowed in the end.",1073692800,,635,4.435897435897436
