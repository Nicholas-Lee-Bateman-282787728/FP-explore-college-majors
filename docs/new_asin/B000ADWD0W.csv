2386046,4,B000ADWD0W,"My 2.5 year old daughter enjoyed this DVD very much. I liked it because the main episode shows Swiper in a different light; this time he tries to help someone and gets stuck himself. One would think that Dora would be a bit tired of Swiper's continual swiping, but this episode shows that she considers Swiper worth saving. Dora's World Adventure also shows Swiper in a new way.",1162512000,3,378,4.573529411764706
2386047,5,B000ADWD0W,"Dora is my three year old granddaughters favorite on Nick Jr. and she loves this DVD. I don't know how many ti,es she has watched it since I aquired it, but it's a lot.",1143072000,4,168,3.9705882352941178
2386048,5,B000ADWD0W,"My 3 year old daughter loves Dora. When we purchased this DVD,she watched it over & over. It entertained not only my 3 year but my son who is a little over a year old gets excited when he hears the music. A must get for infants and toddlers.",1142380800,6,241,3.938775510204082
2386049,4,B000ADWD0W,"My child loves this (she is 2+) - she would give it 4 stars.  I find it tedious, repetitive and pretty boring.  However, she does follow the actions on-screen, finds stuff in the backpack etc.  It is typical Dora and better than some other toddler offerings, but not much.  Most parents seem to feel Dora is the lesser of several evils and I agree!  There is not as much dancing as I was expecting - three episodes back to back.",1140739200,10,428,4.3
2386050,4,B000ADWD0W,My granddaughter did enjoy Dance to the Rescue. It was one of the few she had not already seen. The other two episodes were ones she had already seen. It would be nice if Dance to the Rescue and the new Dora's Big Adventure(which is to be released this month)would have been together on the same DVD.Dora neeeds some new episodes on Nick. Whatever happened to Dora's baby sister and brother?Where is Dora's dog?Come on Dora creators. WAKE UP!!!,1136505600,6,444,4.632911392405063
2386051,4,B000ADWD0W,The other reviewer accidently reviewed the computer game here (which I understand to be terrible).  This is the DVD version which is recommended instead of the computer game.,1134777600,22,174,5.214285714285714
2386052,1,B000ADWD0W,"As a parent of a young girl, this seemed like the perfect Christmas present.  Since it is cartoon themed, it is sure to be a hit with any avid Dora fan.  Also, the dancing theme is more feminine than your average video game, which is perfect for young geek-ets (like my daughter).  However, beyond the initial concept and theme of this product, the game is a total flop, and parents should beware!

While the voice and graphics quality is decent, the game play is absolutely infuriating.  The mini-games are extremely repetitive and have difficult to understand criteria for passing.  For instance, one of the stages requires you to click to make the characters dance in time.  However, the animals you are attempting to mimic move at a lightning pace while you painstakingly inch the characters arms up and down one degree at a time.  Getting the timing to match the invisible metronome is frustrating at best, compounded by the long-winded instructions they repeat on every failure.

Rather than being the exception, in every stage you will learn to share the frustration as your child attempts to figure out a new eccentric game that is somehow themed around dancing, but has little educational value whatsoever.  However, the difficult control mechanisms do a great job of covering up the fact this game is rather short in content and length, focusing more on poorly animated skeleton-like character jigs than educational content.

I have also purchased several other Dora titles form Atari, such as ""Backpack Adventure"" and ""Fairytale Adventure"", and have enjoyed playing them with my daughter, so this game is definitely not representative of other Dora products.  I just hope other parents can avoid the disappointment and frustration of purchasing this product.",1133308800,10,1769,5.083044982698962
2386053,5,B000ADWD0W,"As a professor of semiotical dialectic and chair of the postmodern hermeneutics department at a major university, I spend most of my day engaged in exegetical debate over the development and metaphysics of cultural praxis, as influenced by both prestige politics and fin de siecle nomism. Both my profession and reputation depend on the ability to analyze, and then analyze the analysis, and to keep doing this until either deconstructionist absurdism sets in or a layer of impenetrable argot prevents rational intrusion.

""Dora the Explorer"" may be a far remove from Derrida, Foucault, and Heidegger, but I find watching the little imp on her adventures with her simian companion, Boots, and her animated inanimate objects, backpack and map, a great relief from the demands of intellectual rigor, especially with two fingers of my favorite single-malt and a smooth Cohiba. I especially enjoy the hypnotic songs, with their trance-like repetition of key phrases, such as ""I'm the map,"" no doubt inspired by the serialism of John Adams. ""Dora the Explorer"" also educates as well as entertains, providing me with the opportunity to finally study Espanol, a language I have been needing to learn in addition to my Latin, Greek, French, German, and Russian. Finally, unlike the dusty texts of history and the desiccated artifacts of half-forgotten cultures, Dora actually and literally speaks to you! Granted, the history of recorded audio and moving pictures is still young, but even the Russian neoexpressionists or the French avant-gardists or even the Czech retro-dadaists rarely, if ever, violated the sanctity of the ""fourth wall"" and spoke to the audience in a truly empowering and unironic manner.

Although I obtained ""Dora the Explorer"" purely for my own enjoyment, I thought my two-year old daughter Europa might also appreciate the delightful and edifying experience of viewing and actively participating in Dora's adventures. She sat through the first five minutes seemingly transfixed on the screen. After ten minutes, I saw signs of discomfort, and after fifteen, she got up, toddled over to the bookcase, and pulled down my copy of ""The Riverside Shakespeare."" The weighty tome landed on the floor and opened up in the middle of ""Twelfth Night."" Europa sat down in front of the text and began giggling with obvious delight. To my great horror, it appeared I had fathered a literary critic. I was heartbroken, but soon forgot my woes as Dora the Explorer embarked on yet another adventure with me, her faithful viewing companion, helping her.",1130025600,15,2553,5.194174757281553
2386070,5,B000ADWD0W,"One of the many reasons our family loves Dora is despite Swiper constantly trying to undermine her progress on her exploring adventures, she always treats him with respect! In DANCE TO THE RESCUE the sneaky fox gets trapped in a magic bottle by a  dancing elf and Dora promises to get him out by winning a royal dance contest where she can win one big wish to wish Swiper free. Includes some of the most amazing Dora music and dance numbers:  "" ONE BIG WISH"" , "" MARCHING ANTS/WIGGLY SPIDERS/SNEAKY SNAKES"" ,  and "" EVERYONE CAN DANCE"". You and your family will be singing and dancing along - I promise you!",1377561600,,607,4.45045045045045
2386071,5,B000ADWD0W,"Well I had some issues with the condition of my dvd. when I first looked at the back of it I saw scratches and when I played it for my grand daughter it took a while for it to play and when it did it started making loud noises and rolling and the the picture split into and it would start and stop, so I knew it was because of the scratch marks. So in my first review I wrote that the packing that the dvd came in was in perfect conditio but the dvd disc inside was beautiful on the forn but when you turn it over the back of the disc was another story, so I said for the price of the dvd it was awesome but the dvd itsef was not. So I received an email from the seller apoligizing for the defected disc and he wanted to make things right and gave me a full refund and also emailed after I received the full refund and wanted to know if he could do anything else also, well this goes to show you what type of person we are buying from, he went through an awful lot of trouble to rectify this error { we all make mistakes } and I want him to know that I was not mad but disappointed because I purchased the dvd for my grand daughter { who is 18 months old } she loves Dora The Explorer, and when the dics continues to mess up in certain spots while we are watching it that interrupts her learning  and enjoyment. So know everything is resolved and there is nothing like get the proper understanding and both parties are at peace, and so know  he deserves a 5 star rating. Thanks again",1360281600,,1483,3.9565217391304346
2386072,3,B000ADWD0W,"In Dance to the Rescue, Swiper gets trapped in a bottle and then swallowed by a whale.  He gets out, of course, but my sensitive two and a half year old gets upset about this scene.  She gets worried about Swiper.  For most kids this won't be an issue, but if you have a sensitive kid, there may be better Dora DVDs.  We like the Cow Girl DVD- no traumatic events on that one.",1303516800,6,376,4.04054054054054

2386075,4,B000ADWD0W,"My little girl LOVES to sing along with Dora. She especially loves the Spanish language tracks. I purchased this DVD because the description stated that the movie had movie English and Spanish Language tracks. Unfortunately this was not the case. I would've returned the movie but once my daughter saw it it was too late. If you are looking for both language tracks, please be sure to check with seller to read the back of the case and ensure that both languages are there.",1208304000,3,473,4.642857142857143
