4267901,4,B0046GDYLQ,"I am an avid fan of the Guardians of Ga'Hoole book series and have read all 17 books about these owls. This movie is something I'd imagine for a long time and when I saw previews I immedietly beganing binge reading to complete the series in a little under two weeks.
The movie was amazing! I went in 3-D and feel that it was well worth it. It was one of the fullest 3-D films I'd ever seen with things not only popping out but sinking away. The lanscapes were totally gorgeous and the owls simply marvelous. (Even if I think Twilight looks silly that is pretty much what a Great Gray Owl looks like.)

POSSIBLE SPOILERS
How does the movie compare the books? Well, for one thing it covers 'three' books. Mostly book 1 and an adapted version of book 3. Book 2, The Journey, is covered very quickly.
The villians of the novels were treated interestingly, combining groups of villians and splitting individual villians into two characters. However, this is handled so deftly as to be completely natural and it really works for this film.
The settings. Nailed it. That's really all that needs to be said.
The 'Band'. Awesome, I mentioned earlier Twilight looks silly, that is really the only thing working against the Band, you get a sense of the comraderie that builds in the books.
Other Ga'Hoolian Owls. This is where the movie falls short. Otulissa has no real part in the movie, this is sad because she really does have a wonderful personality once it gets fully developed. Ezylryb, one of my favorites in the book, I don't know what happened here. It should work, I think once again he suffers from too little screen time. You never gets to see the quirks of his personality. While Barran and Boron were handled well this can't be said for many of the other Ga'Hoolians. Pity.
Last but not least, the un-owly stuff. The owls are violent having large scale wars. Anyone who complains that the movie is violent probably would hate the books. The books have a heavy bit of fighting. Blacksmithing, who cares that owls can't really smith? It is important to realize that this is set in a post human world and owls can write too. While it is true that an owl isn't really built to forge steel one should never lose sight of the fact that this is fiction. Aand possibly my favorite part of the books, colliering. The idea of an owl flying through a forest fire is simply breathtaking and the movie delivered. Sequences where Soren was flying through fire were among some of the most beautiful I'd ever seen in a movie.",1285891200,3,2513,4.535242290748899
4267902,4,B0046GDYLQ,"""Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole"" is an animated film with the enchanting lure of a fairy tale, the intrigue of a medieval political thriller, the excitement of an action spectacle, and the majesty of a special effects extravaganza. What it lacks is the time needed to fully develop the characters and the story; the film, an amazing technical achievement, not only moves too quickly but also feels incredibly condensed, as if not just one, but several of Kathryn Lasky's ""Guardians of Ga'Hoole"" books (unread by me) were combined into a single story. With so many plot points reduced to vague descriptions, with so many characters that each have engaging and discernable personalities, I didn't feel like I was seeing a great movie, but rather the beginnings of a great movie. And that's the thing - the beginnings are there. For a film just ninety minutes long, that's quite an achievement.

In what's essentially a redressing of a hero's journey, it tells the story of a barn owl named Soren (voiced by Jim Sturgess), who's brave, idealistic, a dreamer, and devoted to stories about the Guardian owls, legendary for their heroic acts and their protection of the kingdom of Ga'Hoole. His brother, Kludd (voiced by Ryan Kwanten), thinks the stories are merely that - stories - and is jealous of the attention Soren receives. One day, the brothers are abducted and taken to the lair of the evil Metalbeak (voiced by Joel Edgerton) and his wicked queen, Nyra (voiced by Helen Mirren). Once there, the weak owls are mentally incapacitated and forced to pick through owl pellets; the strong ones are brainwashed into joining Metalbeak's merciless army and take part in an insidious plot to take over the kingdom. The details of this takeover are left a little obscure, although it apparently involves a debilitating device that runs on scraps of metal.

Brother is turned against brother as Soren befriends Gylfie, a timid elf owl (voiced by Emily Barclay), while Kludd is primed by Nyra to be the greatest of Metalbeak's soldiers. With a little help, Soren and Gylfie escape, and they realize with great excitement that they have finally learned how to fly. They quickly team up with a kooky burrowing owl named Digger (voiced by David Wenham) and his lute-playing poet companion, a great gray owl named Twilight (voiced by Anthony LaPaglia). Only then does Soren learn that the Guardians are not only real, but also the only hope left for saving ... I guess you'd have to call it owlkind, since mankind apparently doesn't exist in this world. Thus the story progresses to a fierce and fiery battle in Metalbeak's lair, which, if the title is of any indication, will someday become legend.

This 3D animated fantasy, director Zach Snyder's first attempt at family entertainment, shows that considerable care went into creating its look. Production designer Simon Whiteley and art director Grant Freckelton have crafted a world of woodland charm and battle-scarred horror, with just a hint of Celtic thrown into the mix. The owls themselves are a triumph of animation, and I have no doubt that their feathers alone were a painstaking ordeal, what with the texture, color, movement, and transparency to take into consideration. There's a close-up shot late in the film, for example, of Soren as he flies through a violent rainstorm; coming towards the camera in slow motion, his feathers ruffle authentically in the howling winds, and rain droplets cling to his body while others splash into his eyes. It's a breathtaking moment, overflowing with power, grace, and style.

The problem is that it didn't go far enough with the story. Either that, or far too much of it was trimmed away in post production. Whatever the case, ""Legend of the Guardians"" is one of the few films that actually needs an extra thirty minutes just for the sake of pacing and clarification. We're so quick to complain about a film that moves too slowly, but we often forget that it can be just as damaging for a film to move too fast - we don't want to leave the theater feeling as if crucial details have been overlooked. As a full two-hour film, I suspect the film would do more than seem complete; it would also be one of the best modern-day examples of a conventional fairy tale retold.

Note: Despite the film's PG rating, ""Legend of the Guardians"" is considerably darker than most recent animated films - more so, I suspect, than the studios have been willing to reveal in the ads. There's no gratuitous violence, although there are a few decidedly violent moments of owls in battle. It's not excessively gloomy, although there is a consistent undercurrent of danger and despair. Take from this what you will. You obviously know your children a lot better than I do, but I've always been a firm believer that, in general, kids can tolerate a lot more unpleasantness than adults give them credit for. If this weren't the case, stories by J.K. Rowling, Roald Dahl, L. Frank Baum, The Brothers Grimm, Hans Christian Andersen, or Carlo Collodi would not have withstood the test of time.",1285718400,,5072,4.8657407407407405
4267903,5,B0046GDYLQ,"This good vs. evil treat to the eyes, begins with an owl family nested in the hollow of a large old tree. (I believe they were white snowy owls if I have my breeds correct.) Two younger male owls (brothers) and their baby sister are looked after by parents and a snake nanny named Mrs. P.  The young males are learning to fly and are also told the battle stories of the great Guardians (the great owls) who keep peace and protect the masses.  One of the young males is mesmerized by the tales, so much so that they are told to go to bed before they are up all night with ""Daymares"" :-).

When they are supposed to be asleep, the brothers sneak out to practice flying and wind up on the ground, a no-no for an owl.  Approached by danger, they are grabbed in the nick of time by other owls, who carry them off into the night, only to become enslaved to serve an elite group of owls called ""The Pure Ones"" and their evil leader ""Metal Beak"" and his beautiful but nasty queen.

Of course, the Pure Ones are anything but pure-in-heart.  They kidnap young owls to serve their power kick to take over the owl world.  The ""lucky"" ones get to fight for the cause.  The unlucky ones get to pick up mouse pellets (the fur balls owls cough up after they eat a mouse - yuk) and throw them into some sort of energy recycling machine that zaps other owls.  The unlucky ones got ""moonblinked"" --kind of mind-zapped into servant zombies.

In a quest to save the goodness in the owl world from the evil-doers, our hero sets out to find the Guardians at the Great Tree and release the enslaved.

I found the CGI stunning and the imbedded messages to be that you can achieve your widest dreams in this approximate 90 minute film.  It was pretty adventure filled.  We also had the strong message of good fighting evil, of strong friendships and caring for each other along with love of family.  It was also a ""tap into the strength within"" film. I loved it.

As a side note, there is some violence that may frighten the very young children.  If your children are young and sensitive, you may want to see it first yourself.  This is a power fight with a ""the strong shall survive the weak"" mentality by the bad guys.",1285459200,2,2194,4.31219512195122
4267904,3,B0046GDYLQ,"First off--Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole is not meant for little kids.  It is directed by Zack Snyder, who also did Watchmen, Dawn of the Dead, and 300.  This is also a pretty violent film.  I am suprised it didn't get a PG-13 rating.  It doesn't contain any blood, just ruffled feathers.  Still it might give youngsters some nightmares.

This owl flick is definitely a visual delight.  The CGI images are indeed crisp and amazing.  I watched it in 3D at the Imax theater, although I don't think the gimmicky glasses and resonant speaker system added anything to the movie.  They sure as heck didn't help cover the monotonous, derived storyline.

It doesn't take long before you get the feeling of being kicked out of your nest before you are ready to fly.  Not that any aspect of the plot will go over your head, it is painstakingly simple and cliched.  The story flutters through a basic good owls vs. bad owls conflict.  There is no intelligent dialogue.  Not much humor.  No clever birds and the bees innuendo either.

Final assessment--Booooring, bird-brained disaster--2.5 stars.  This film would have been better if it was geared toward little kids with less violence and a cute little message woven in.",1285459200,3,1226,4.761904761904762

I feel really good watching this movie.  Always torn about wishing for a follow up.  It would have been nice, but look at the sequels to Shrek and Cars, total crap (I mean really, they are total crap).  So with one movie, it makes it extra special.  Also, if you enjoy reading, you can always jump back into the Legend of the Guardians.

4268099,5,B0046GDYLQ,"I didn't quite know what to expect as I prepared to view
Legends of the Guardians.  From the little pre-research
that I usually do, I discovered that the film is adapted
from the series of books, Guardians of Ga'Hoole, by
author Kathryn Lasky.  Additionally, this animated film
is directed by none other than Zack Snyder, best known
for his films 300, Watchmen and Dawn of the Dead.

The story mostly centers around a young adventurous
owl named Soren (voiced by Jim Sturgess) who has grown
up hearing his father's fantastic tales about the mythical,
warrior owls known as the Guardians of Ga'Hoole.  These
owls are heralded as the peacekeepers of the owl kingdom.

One day Soren and his brother Kludd (voiced by Ryan
Kwanten) are abruptly kidnapped by a force of evil owls
who call themselves The Pure Ones.  Led by the evil
queen Nyla (voiced by Helen Mirren) and its masked
leader Metal Beak (voiced by Joel Edgerton), the army
of owls are intent on conquering the world.

Brother is turned against brother as Kludd readily joins
the Pure Ones while Soren's resistance leads him to
slavery.  With the assistance of a supportive guard,
Soren manages to escape and find his way into the
hands of the Guardians.

I can understand why someone like Zack Snyder
would be interested in dabbling in this story material.
The film is filled with all-too-familiar battle shots of
warrior owls racing into attack then suddenly
colliding in slow-motion.  Since this is essentially
a family film, there is no gore here and I think that
the stop-motion battle tactic lessens the ferocity
of the violence.

Legend of the Guardians is very effective in
its 3D presentation, though I wouldn't rate it the
very best I have seen.  The film was certainly
composed for 3D with its appropriate placement
of branches and brush which give a nice sense
of depth separation from the forest backdrop.
The problem I found is that sometimes the level
of 3D doesn't seem very consistent, particularly
in the darker scenes within The Pure Ones lair
where images tend to look a little more flat.

Still, there are some really nice moments
where the 3D process shines such as a scene
where we meet the first Guardian rescuing an
owlet above the raging ocean waters -- or when
Soren is flying through a barrage of raindrops.

While the filmmakers strayed from throwing too
many 3D gimmicks at its audience there are some
minor ""In Yo' Face"" moments that involve owl beaks,
raindrops, fire embers and a snake named Mrs. P
that peak out from the screen. Watch for the
porcupine/hedgehog oracle and how his mouth reaches
out from the confines of the viewing area.

Ghosting issues?  A few throughout the film, mostly
evident in darker scenes and when the owls take flight.
There were some moments with shots looking down
upon crowded groups of owls that I saw more pronounced
double imaging.  However, it's certainly not a problem
that burdens the entire film.

Created entirely in the digital realm, this film looks
immaculate and the transfer does nothing to mar it.
Images are sharp and detailed. This is an extraordinarily
beautiful film to watch with its warm colors that include
golden sunrises and sunsets. This really is one of those
films that benefits greatly from the Blu-ray format.

The DTS-HD master audio track is open and spacious
with very active surround activity.  Let's first begin with
the film's non-too-memorable score by composer David
Hirschfelder that comes across with nice dynamics and
just a hint of underlying bass.  There's a nice animated
sequence that features the song ""Take To The Sky"" by
the group Owl City that has a nice amount of punch to it.
The dialogue is seemingly evermoving across the channels
as is the film's effects. I tend to overuse the word ""immersive""
but I know very few other words to constantly describe this
kind of experience where the audio really pulls you into the film.

Really love the fact that Warner is including 3D cartoons on
their feature films as a bonus item.  It started with The Polar
Express and now for a second time we get yet another neat
Road Runner short, Fur of Flying.  It clocks in at a mere
2 minutes 50 seconds but it's a very high-quality 3D short
that I found to be  thoroughly enjoyable.

CONCLUSION

The last thing I want to do is to give an entirely negative
opinion about Legend of the Guardians.  It isn't a bad film
by any means.  However, there's nothing memorable about
it. You watch it, are entertained for its 90 minute length, but
soon forget about it afterwards.  It's a bit dark, there isn't
anything feelgood about it and as such I sort of wonder how
much lasting appeal it would even have for kids. Warner did
a great job with the transfer and keeping the ghosting minimal.
The 3D is effective but nothing to go ""ooh and aaah"" over
except for a few small sequences.

Still, with so little quality family entertainment 3D to choose
from I can't help but recommend this film
for an evening I think will be well enjoyed by the entire household
huddled together wearing their 3D eyewear.",1453075200,,5048,4.728310502283105

4268229,3,B0046GDYLQ,"It's a beautifully animated movie with great voice actors and big themes.  But the big themes overwhelm quickly, especially since it's a children's movie.  I don't think there was enough exposition or character/situation development at the beginning of the movie.  I think it's only maybe 10 minutes in when the two young owlets are kidnapped and taken to be slaves.  Everything felt rushed to me, and in a lot of places, very dark and scary.  I took my 5 year old nephew to see it when it was in theatres and he waffled between being scared and not paying attention.  I think it is not as much of a children's movie as a big kid and animation-loving adult movie, but I could be wrong.",1419984000,,685,4.483870967741935

I bought this movie as a gag gift for a White Elephant party, it was meant to be extremely painful for anyone who was unlucky enough to get this DVD and had never seen this movie before. 2 stars for amazing visual effects and CG animation, it really is a work of art, just like Andy Warhol's narratives.",1419033600,,583,4.407407407407407

4268286,1,B0046GDYLQ,"Spoilers below. Not that you could spoil this movie, it's rotten already.

All of the heroic female characters are either absent or dramatically weakened. The hero of Ambala, Hortense, is completely gone. Gylfie is reduced to saying ""I'm scared, Soren,"" instead of being the brains of the operation when the two make their great escape. Also, instead of Gylfie waiting for Soren's flight feathers to grow in, he waits for her. Why?? I have no idea. Also, smart and sharp-tongued Otilissa turned into a flirty love interest for Soren. The imaginative plot and wonderful characters are flattened into something really stale and uncreative. As my 8yo said, ""They took a great story and made it into the Power Rangers.""

The plot was a mess -- Kludd wasn't metalbeak (he is in the books), Ezylryb is made into part of ""the band"", the puffins are left out, Soren got stuck in the magnetic pull of the flecks -- it barely made sense if you'd read the books, and definitely wouldn't if you had not.

The only good thing about it was that the scenes were pretty - especially all of the flying. But that's it. If I could give it less than one star I would.",1413417600,,1147,4.585365853658536

4268289,4,B0046GDYLQ,"I watched Legends of the Guardians (The Owls of Ga'Hoole) after a recommendation at the sci-fi convention that I go to in January. The reviewers at the convention nailed it in their 30 second review of the film, amazingly gorgeous but a little light on the story. To be fair, the story was predictable but fun and let's be honest an animated feature like this is aimed at a slightly different demographic than I fit into (maybe?). The story revolves around two brother owls, one of which is on the side of good and one on the side of evil. A fellowship of other owls (and one snake) form around the good owl and they set off to find the legendary Guardians in order to get help in stopping the bad owls. It is as straight forward as a movie can get but it was well done and I was surprised at the amount of emotion they squeezed out of the feathered characters. The part that I loved about the movie was visually it was probably the finest computer graphics that I have EVER seen and I have seen a fair bit of CGI!!! The challenge of feathers moving in the wind was perfect. The depth of the scenes was also amazing. The colors were rich and backgrounds super detailed. I would place the animation at a higher level even than the Pixar films. The music was a mix of traditional film score music and pop tunes that worked well for the film. While it may not have been the deepest movie, it was a great brainless piece of beauty to watch and it established a universe where owls are the main characters and I want to see more of their adventures (it was certainly set up for a sequel). Check it out if you need to find a film to find with your kids or if you just want to see some of the finest CG animation out today.

4268325,1,B0046GDYLQ,"The only good thing about this movie is the animation - it is stunning. If you are an animation buff - it is worth watching. However, the animation does not make up for the appalling script, and the insult this movie is to fans of the books. The books are a great series and are worth reading. I have read them all and thoroughly enjoyed them.
I understand that some changes need to be made when translating a book to film, however there are some changes that unforgivable. In addition they tried to cram too much into one movie. The movie technically covers three books - The Capture, The Journey and The Rescue. However the changes at the end are so great there is nothing in the third book that is remotely similar to the movie.
***Spoiler alert***
Firstly they changed the concept of the books, and the main characters. Soren and Kludd were not taken by the Pure Ones. Kludd booted Soren out of the nest so he could join the Pure Ones (although you don't find that out until much later in the books).
Secondly, they changed the main characters - The Band, mainly that of Twilight who was a warrior not a sop with a lute. Soren did not like Otulissa (who was a goody goody pain in the butt who never stopped talking). Ezylryb never wore battle claws and did not fight (which also came out later in the books).
The introduction of a traitor within the Great Tree was an abysmal addition to the story and the character did not exist in the books.
The ending was also sanitised - to a happy ending where Soren met his parents and lived happily at the Great Tree - Kids are tougher than you think and that sort of ending really stuffed the story.
The other thing - why did they place the movie in Australia. The books were set in Northern England and isles and there was no Echidna.",1406851200,,1781,4.351351351351352

4268376,3,B0046GDYLQ,"I don't like predatory cowardly creatures that kill other creatures in that 'parasitic existance'.  So I never liked or accepted the fact that Americans chose and continue to choose the ""Bald Eagle"" as our national bird...because like owls, etc., these cowards prey upon those less fortunate.  It's kind of in keeping with our sick national policy where here in America, I know of no time when 'we the people' haven't been at war with some country(s)...and like the owls/eagles, we always attack, destroy and rob from those who actually are much smaller and considerably less in number than we are. So I was disappointed that this movie portrayed these Owls as heroic or worthy of my attention beyond loathing them for what they choose to be and do.  Technically, the CGI animation is extremely well done, but as good as it was and as limited it's story line and plot were in the choice of portraying Owls as 'guardians' or something special didn't pan out.  They were owls who hunted, tortured and killed species who were far, far smaller than they were...so there was nothing noble about this species or it's portrayal.  As a human animal watching this movie, it reminded me of just how utterly de-evolved and DEFICIT the human species is...so this 'propaganda film' didn't work for me.  With humanity eating flesh of similarly helpless animals we hunt, farm, torture and kill, I don't need any more lies thrust at me about how evolved humans are when-in-fact our ACTIONS are full proof that we definitely aren't.  This film, although technically might be considered as being well made, is overall a lie that is in keeping with the kind of supreme hypocrisy of human animals eating other animals...so where we all are meat, the cautionary tale and message here that was missed is that we individually and collectively need to adopt and adhere to the truth here 'that IF you don't like the idea of being hunted, herded, and harvested for your flesh, then never, ever do to others what you don't want done to you!!! Here this movie misses on so many levels to lull you into continuing your 'sleep through life' journey of spiritual death so that the gigantic meat profiteers can have you support your own soul's demise.  Owls are just like people here, so there is truth to instruct and guide children to choose a different path and way of life beyond their parent's flesh eating influences.  I looked for more, but this movie gave me less.",1400976000,,2440,4.76303317535545

Now for the service. It was a cheap movie on DVD, understandable. The upper right corner of the DVD case was sliced! Plastic (The very tough plastic) was cut.

4268380,1,B0046GDYLQ,"Let me first off say that this review is specifically geared towards those who are (like me) diehard fans of ""Guardians of Ga'Hoole.""  I will agree that if you've never read the books or are a casual fan of GOG, this is a good movie.  I saw some people in other reviews mention wanting an art book for this movie and I couldn't agree more.  It's absolute eye candy.  That being said, I still think this is one of the worst movies on the face of the planet.  I just finished watching this for the second time (taking copious notes throughout) and am in a fairly foul mood.  I apologize beforehand if I begin to rant.  Im in a ranting mood.  I also want to warn that this will contain spoilers of both the books and the movie.  So just a heads up.

Let me first off say that, for the exception of Twilight and Kludd/Metal Beak and somewhat Digger and Nyra, I thought every character was perfect in actor choice, design, and personality.  Everyone was pretty spot-on with the book.  My problem with Nyra was that she was pure evil, and in the movie shes portrayed aswell, a pouty evil person.  In the books, she caused chill bumps.  In the movie, I kinda got annoyed with her near the end.  Diggers character in the movie was adorable, but somewhat an extreme of who Digger really was.  For one thing, he was an owlet like Soren and Gylfie, and he was an orphan.  He wasn't the crazy, always cracking jokes owl, he was slightly eccentric, quiet, and (oddly) very wise.

Metal Beak and Kludd ARE THE SAME PERSON.  You cant split them apart and remake the Pure Ones.  Also, its never been told who actually destroyed Metal Beaks face, but it most certainly wasn't Ezylryb because he didn't even know Metal Beak existed.  I think the speculation in the book was that it was either a Pure One or some random owl he fought.

And Twilight.  My beloved Twilight whom I looked forward to so much in the movie.  And they ruined him beyond compare.  I was expecting the battle hungry, crude, violent Twilight who only wanted to know how to fight with battleclaws and always bragged about learning from the Orphan School of Tough Learning and escaping the St. Aggie snatchers by fighting them.  This was the Twilight I loved and held dear, the one who sang songs in the middle of battle that made the enemy go yeep, the one who learned that war isn't glorious and its more than just battleclaws.  Was he like this in the movie?  No!  He was an aging owl who thought he was a bard, though still had some battle lust, but nothing like the real Twilight did.

The movie starts with Soren already knowing about the Battle of the Ice Claws (something he didn't learn about until the third book The Rescue when Octavia, Ezylrybs nest snake, told him) and hes retelling the story to Eglantine.  Soren is already branching and Kludds just about to start flying.  There is no First ceremonies really mentioned.  I think Marella, Sorens mum, says something about First Meat in passing, but its never talked about.  Instead of Soren being pushed out of the nest by Kludd in Kludds sacrifice to join the Pure Ones, Soren and Kludd both fall to the ground while spatting over flying.  In book one, The Capture, Soren was too young to fly and hadnt even come close to branching yet.  There never was any battle with a woodland creature, only his falling and then the owls of St. Aggies picking him up.  St. Aggies is portrayed as a Pure One strong hold with no mention of Skench or Spoorn, the actually leaders at St. Aegolius.  Nyra is introduced as the Ablah general, not Skench.  In reality, the academy was an entirely different entity from the Pure Ones and even fought a battle against the Tytos.  St. Aggies was notorious of owlet snatching as well as stealing eggs from nests.  Owlets captured were given a number and then moon blinked to forget their names and identities, thus brain washing them.  If the owlets were eventually found to be very loyal, they were assigned new names in a Specialness ceremony.

Questions were forbidden and considered swear words; owlets caught speaking any wha words were severely punished.  Soren experienced one such punishment while working in the Pelletorium.  Gylfie and Soren meet at St. Aggies, like in the movie, but are split up later to different pits.  One of the most notorious and terrifying villains of the first four books, surprisingly, makes no appearance in the movie: Auntie/Finny.  If you read the books, shes literally one of the worst owls, in my opinion.  Positively horrifying.  Anyway, neither Auntie or Unk, Gylfies pit guardian, make an appearance, nor does Hortense/Mist (Mist is one of the best spies for the Great Tree and actually warns the Guardians of the Pure Ones and Metal Beak back when no one really knew what the Pure Ones were).  Grimble is shown, but only really long enough for him to teach Soren and Gylfie how to fly and then die by Nyras hand, err claw.  Unlike how he in The Capture he took weeks teaching Soren and Gylfie to fly in the Library and was killed by Skench and Spoorn.  Grimble was not really recruited so much as forced into service at St. Aggies and moon blinked.  He was able to resist at first, but over the years it wore on him until he almost decided to give up and just be brainwashed, that was until Soren and Gylfie arrived.

Flecks were shown as metal fragments with glowy blue stuff that had magical powers.  In reality they were only magnetic metal that messed with an owls gizzard and sense of direction.  St. Aggies harvested flecks to eventually use, though no one really actually knew how to use them, thus prompting the Pure Ones to attack and steal most of the flecks for later battles against the owls of the Great Tree.

Instead of Soren and Gylfie resisting moon blinking by reciting the Legends of GaHoole (stories telling about the first king, Hoole), they simply stay awake during the night.  The reason the stories were so crucial was that they strengthened an owls gizzard and evil owls tended to not be able to hear the name Hoole or GaHoole without having some sort of reaction (think Vampires reacting when Gods name is spoken to them).  These stories, which become important later on in the series, are never spoken of in the movie and the entire focus is on the Battle of the Ice Claws (which actually wasn't a battle but a war).

The actual journey from St. Aggies to the Tree took almost half a book.  Soren and Gylfie flee the tree and meet Twilight, who joins them on their quest to the Great Tree, then find Mrs. P, and then they meet Digger, who tells them that the owls of St. Aggies are also cannibals (ew!) and ate his brother.  They were attacked by Jatt and Jutt as well as another owl, who tried to eat Digger, and were saved by two eagles and Hortense, who they thought dead since Auntie had pushed their friend off a cliff.  From there, the Band (Soren, Gylfie, Twilight, and Digger) journey toward the great tree and have the incident with the crows (which is partially shown in the movie) and later a battle against a bobcat where they learn for the first time about the Pure Ones (sorta; the Band wasn't actually told about the Pure Ones, but they were told by a dying owl that there was something out in the world much, much worse than St. Aggies).  Then you had the incident at the Mirror Lakes You get my point.  There never was an echidna shaman/soothsayer dude to direct the Band on their way.  It was actually a family of puffins who did that. xD

Now the Pure Ones.  The Pure Ones comprised only of Tytos with a few other owls in lowly, servant-like positions.  Tyto Albas (barn owls) were the leaders since the Pure Ones believed that Albas were the most pure of all owls.  The Pure Ones really first showed themselves in the books when they captured Ezylryb in The Rescue and used flecks to disorient him completely.  The Pure Ones existed long before the books began, but they didn't become a true threat until Kludd became the High Tyto as Metal Beak, with Nyra as his mate.  Nyra was actually the one who encouraged Kludd to join since she saw someone even more evil than herself in him.  Nyra was, supposedly, almost an incarnation of wickedness.  She was literally an owl demon.  Besides Kludd, she was the most ruthless and bloodthirsty of all the Pure Ones and became the leader of the group after Kludd died by Twilights hand.  The Pure Ones sought to take over the entire owl world and went to any lengths to do so, such as attacking St. Aggies to steal flecks, causing the Great Downing (another battle against St. Aggies where the Pure Ones and the academy fought of scores of owlets), and reviving the hagsfiends (owl demons).

Eglantine was originally captured by the Pure Ones, along with a bunch of other owlets, and placed within human crypts where it stone stunned her into thinking Tytos were supreme.  Much worse than moon blinking.  Eglantine never went to St. Aggies as a chick, nor was she moon blinked.  She was found during the Great Downing (battle between Aggies and Pure Ones) and didn't return to normal until she saw a shard of stained glass from a human building.

The battle at St. Aggies against the Pure Ones never happened; the Pure Ones brought the battle to the Great Tree, aided by mercenaries and their own bolstered forces.  Lord Allomere was never in the books, instead the traitor being a burrowing owl named Dewlap.

Otilissa was not liked by any young owls.  Soren never had a crush on her.  Everyone, even some of the teachers, thought her too annoying and people-pleasing, plus she was a brat in the beginning.

I think Ill stop here since I could go on and on and on and Im pretty sure Ive lost 99% of my readers.  My point is, the plotline was so messed up that theres no way they can do a sequel and follow the books.  If you look at the books, they're only about a hundred and fifty pages long and a lot of that is description of places and people.  Now, how hard would it have been to take the first two, maybe even part of the third book, and follow it?  Not that hard at all.  Doing so would have made a better movie and would have allowed for a continuation of the story.  If youve read this, thank you and Im sorry for the length and if I rambled.",1399593600,13,10231,4.489983757444505
4268381,4,B0046GDYLQ,"Good animal fantasy adventure story for Older Children; Pre-Teens.  The plot and characters were OK, and kept me engaged in the film.  However, I purchased this film primarily on it's 10/10 3D Effects rating as reviewed on CinemaBlend.  I agree with the review that this movies easily matches Cameron's ""Avatar"" in 3D image quality and enjoyment. The -1 star is only for the story and content which gets a little slow at times. Still, I rate it as a Must Buy if you're a 3D movie aficionado, because it really is a 3D movie benchmark (as are Gravity, Life of Pi, Hugo, and a ton of others).",1399420800,,590,4.4953271028037385

Very large voice cast, includes Geoffrey Rush, Helen Mirren, Sam Neil, and many others. The film was criticized as being a Star Wars knock-off written by 15 years olds, but I don't see the connection. A wonderfully rendered heroic fantasy, more in the Tolkienesque mode than the Star Wars Universe. Back stories, legends, glorious fights, though it is true it is hard to tell who is who sometimes. The rendering was fantastic and awesome. It is disappointing it did not win the Oscar for best animated film--it went to Toy Story 3, which I didn't even bother to see.

4268400,5,B0046GDYLQ,"This is without a doubt the best Zack Snyder film that I have seen. I'm not usually a fan of the movies that he directs, but with this one his style really shines through on!

Picture Quality: This movie is simply stunning to watch. Between my roommate and myself we have around 40 3D movies and this is easily one of the most impressive looking. I'm far more critical than your average viewer when it comes to cross talk. I hate it. Most movies nail the foreground, but the background is where you'll see most ghosting. With Legends it was only a problem a few times, and was so forgivable that you quickly forgot that it ever happened. This isn't how I feel about most movies when I watch them. In most scenes your eyes can focus on whatever you want and naturally adjust to the depth as though it was right in front of you. The best part, it's not so overwhelming to your senses that you feel a headache coming on! In my opinion, this movie is up there with Avatar, How to Train Your Dragon, The Hobbit (both of them), Pacific Rim (Very impressive post production 3D), Turbo, etc. when it comes to the quality of the 3D, and overall visual experience.

Audio (my setup is 5.1 surround): I'll take care of this aspect after viewing the movie again. I belatedly realized that my subwoofer had been off while I watched it.

Plot: It felt rushed. However, In all honesty I think the movie would have done horribly if it was much longer or Snyder had chosen to Peter Jackson it and cover every last detail. Yet, there were definitely a few plot points that seemed to happen far too suddenly and could have used a bit more fleshing out. This is probably due to the movie seeming like it takes place over a 3-4 day span of time while in the books it was probably (haven't read them) longer. It just feels like a lot happens too quickly, which is also a strength of this movie. You never really feel like it gets too bogged down. The story moves rapidly and definitely keeps viewers engaged.

All in all, both my girlfriend and myself walked away from the movie feeling like we'd be more than happy to watch it again. This is the biggest selling point for me. I love the 3D, but the fact that it had an appealing storyline along with the beautiful visuals makes me very happy that I purchased this movie.

Almost fell asleep twice- WAY TOO LONG. Yes, the owls look cool, but not enough dynamic. It didn't draw me in. Wasted family night.",1394150400,2,297,4.418181818181818

4268467,5,B0046GDYLQ,"Dont let the realistic cover turn you away from this great animated film. This is one of the most beautiful, original, epic  and entertaining animate films out there. The visuals are stunning, from the realistic environment with great lighting, to the rain and sense of Flight, this is top notch. Darker than most animated films, it feel like a younger version of The Lords of the Ring or The Hobbit; because of that boys are more likely to enjoy the movie even though there is something here for everyone. If you haven't seen it, give it a try, for the price there is not good reason why not to. Highly recommended for young fantasy fans or animation fans out there.",1393545600,,667,4.558333333333334

The 3D effects were outstanding.  The attention to detail was very impressive.... down to the very last feather.  This was a memorable viewing experience.

I remember watching Star Wars and you didn't understand half of what they were saying or why they were saying it, but that didn't matter because the movie had a lot of heart.

I like animated stories, in general, but I usually have to watch them from the POV of a child to really enjoy them. With this movie, I was just shocked by how good it was from start to finish. I think anyone who likes a good adventure will love this movie, no matter what age.

I found it cheaper somewhere else (rare), so I didn't buy it here - but I buy almost everything here, so I figured I'd review it here. :) Just watched this with my 7 1/2 year old son and we thought it was awesome. The story is well-written, the characters are adorable, and the 3D looks awesome. I was surprised by how much I liked this movie.

and your children are learning about life, so when they become parents, they will have already learned, the things
they were learning wasn't wrong, but trying to learn the proper knowledge and hands on experience, so they can be
the gift that is inside of them. Help the your family first, than you can help your community in purity of heart, with

4268545,5,B0046GDYLQ,"The movie was a good movie of good versus evil.  My kids wanted to watch a movie and I chose this one because I thought my husband would enjoy it too.  I was right, he enjoyed the action and nobility in the movie.",1379289600,,213,3.9302325581395348
4268546,3,B0046GDYLQ,"Surprised at the tone & story line of this movie for a children's film. Visually, it was beautiful. It was dark and had a fair bit of violence in it.  My husband said it was like Gladiators meets the Owl Family.  That about sums it up. Maybe not suitable for children under 8",1379289600,,275,4.169811320754717
4268547,5,B0046GDYLQ,It held my interest all the way through the movie.  I would defiantly recommend this movie to my friends. Great for children too.,1379116800,,129,4.608695652173913
4268548,4,B0046GDYLQ,Legend of the Guardians is a classic good vs evil type movie.  I am not sure how it compares to the books but the plot of the movie is far from boring and easy to follow.  Like many other reviewers stated the animation is VERY crisp and detailed and is worth watching just for that reason alone!  This is a great little movie that didn't garner a whole lot of attention at the theaters but still ended up impressing me.  I would definitely recommend you watching or even owning this one!  It's a great flick for people of all ages.,1378771200,,531,4.27
4268549,4,B0046GDYLQ,Cute movie! May be a little too low-key or serious for toddlers. It's better for older kids and pre-teens. Great for the price!,1378771200,2,127,4.565217391304348

4268569,5,B0046GDYLQ,"First things first, this movie is beautiful.  Especially on Blu-ray.

Everything about the animation is meticulous and eye-popping.

That's without even getting to the story itself, which I found to be delightfully conceived and executed.  The voice actors did their jobs capably, and the soundtrack was nice (even with the strange surprise of Owl City being involved).

I would recommend this to parents who are tired of sitting through totally mindless movies with their children, and want to be able to have something that both they and their kids can enjoy.",1376438400,,561,5.1208791208791204

4268575,5,B0046GDYLQ,"As far as 3D and family friendly, this is one of my top picks overall. It's based on a children's story, but as an avid 3D fan, I have many Pixar, WarnerBrothers, and other children's ""animated"" movies. This particular one is one of the most stunning graphically- Feathers have motion realism that I hate to say not even my beloved Rio can compete with, and the story is intriguing as well. This was my first 3D purchase in 2010 and it still tops my list as more movies have been released in the 3D format. If you're a 3D system owner, this is a must have for your collection.",1376006400,3,576,4.293577981651376

4268620,5,B0046GDYLQ,"I've watched this film maybe 10 times, before buying it.  The animation is fantastic, extremely realistic.  The first time watching, I had trouble with the Aussie accents; but with rewatching, could hear the lines better.

The DVD clarity is better on the same HD TV, versus the Comcast airings.  Wow.  Golly, I could watch this every day and not get bored.

There is a song in the middle of the film which serves as its theme that I don't like, but I just turn down the sound during that sequence.  Next minus: it's a pain to use this DVD.  You're stuck with a ton of previews you can't get out of (except to keep hitting the skip buttons), before you can even get to the DVD menu.  Please someone, fix that annoyance, in future editions?  In Windows 7, the DVD kept getting stuck (32-bit Windows 7, Dell 780).  But that could be the computer.  Seems to play just fine, in the DVD player and my Win 7 laptop.  Third minus: the scene selections aren't titled.

There are two special DVD features:  one, on the importance of owls in nature, very charming, roughly 15 minutes.  The second special, is a short cartoon, 'The Fur of Flying', with our pal Wiley Coyote and Road Runner.  It looks almost like 3D, on my Toshiba 1080p TV monitor.",1368489600,3,1237,4.450892857142857

4268640,5,B0046GDYLQ,"I fell in love with this movie the first time I saw it. It is amazing. It is a little violent (for a kids movie) so I would watch it before you let your younger children see it. Which is fine, cause its amazingly entertaining.",1365897600,,226,4.044444444444444
4268641,5,B0046GDYLQ,"Our family really enjoyed this movie. The graphics, sound-track, and story-line are excellent! It might be a tad scary in some places for toddler-4 aged kiddos, mostly during the fighting or scenes with the bad owls.

We really love Amazon's customer service, also! We experienced some buffering times during the show, and they refunded our rental price- excellent!",1365724800,,365,5.293103448275862

4268647,4,B0046GDYLQ,I love CG movies and they tend to hold my little ones attention better than traditional cartoon movies.  I love owls and it has a cute story line.  I don't mind watching this one over and over.,1365033600,,193,4.1891891891891895

The story line is a little dark as a group of misfits search for the guardians so that they can stop an evil owl. Breathtaking artwork,1364860800,,364,4.041666666666667

4268651,5,B0046GDYLQ,"If you are looking for THE movie to demo your new 3D set, this is the one for you. From all 3D animation movies I have seen, this is by far the most impressive. The Legend of the Guardians is not just a 2D flick where 3D provides the little extra for 3D enthusiast, you will see this movie in a whole new perspective. Once you have seen it in 3D, the otherwise impressive flying scenes, look flat in 2D - 3D makes it an immersive experience. Even my kids who usually take their glasses off mid film, were spellbound till then end.

I just wanted to comment on the 3D effect, all else has been already said. This movie has a 6.9 IMDb rating.",1364688000,,640,4.12
4268652,5,B0046GDYLQ,So touching! Animation was great. It's amazing what directors can do with films. Love Owls they one of my fav animals!,1364688000,,118,4.666666666666667

4268655,5,B0046GDYLQ,My children watched this movie and seemed to totally enjoy it!  The movie was really good.  We needed to put it on a bigger screen but it was okay.,1364515200,,147,4.0344827586206895
4268656,5,B0046GDYLQ,"After I got a new 3D projector, I researched some good 3D movies to get - not just for the effects but also good story.  This one had high reviews for both story and 3D.  Thanks for those reviews because this was a great movie - deep story that goes beyond just the normal cartoon good guy-bad guy storyline.  The 3D was spectacular with owls in flight and lots of great depth over ocean, forest, and bleak barren landscape scenes.  Would recommend this one for both a great story for kids and adults and also as something to show off your 3D system.",1364428800,,550,4.310679611650485

4268658,2,B0046GDYLQ,"My daughter got an Eglantine owl beanie baby for her birthday and got interested in Legend of the Guardians.  She and her sister and I were all disappointed in this movie.  The primary reason we didn't like the movie is because we couldn't follow it.  The Australian accents were too strong for even an adult to comprehend without straining.  On top of that, two of the main characters, Soren and his brother, were hard to distinguish from each other.  We stopped watching the movie 45 minutes before it was over and the birthday day girl was very disappointed.",1364083200,,561,4.683673469387755

4268661,4,B0046GDYLQ,Pleasantly enjoyable; great graphics.  Will watch again with grandchildren.  Cheaper to purchase than taking entire family to theatre.  Costs $18 for 1 adult at IMAX 3d.,1363651200,,169,5.423076923076923
4268662,3,B0046GDYLQ,"There was a lot of hype about this movie, but I found the plot seemed to jump around & at times was confusing. But the 3D was great so I gave it 3 stars for the effects.  If you're looking for eye candy, you can't go wrong. But the plot might leave you asking yourself just what is this about?!",1363651200,,294,3.9
4268663,3,B0046GDYLQ,"Read quite a few reviews on this movie prior to making the purchase. Have watched more than 40 3D movies since going 3D in 2012 (plasma but whatever, no one cares.)Legends was the first movie I have seen where there was ghosting. Not to mention more than several scenes (mostly backdrop)were out of focus. Tried liking the movie and perhaps one day will give the 2D aspect a try. Will type this, the animation/CGI are quite impressive and picture quality for the most part clear, it's just the ghosting double exposure and out of focus stuff that got in the way.",1363478400,,562,4.574257425742574

4268666,2,B0046GDYLQ,The movie is slow and not that interesting.  A little scary for my 3 yr old. It is something they can watch but won't be a favorite,1362873600,,131,3.8518518518518516
4268667,5,B0046GDYLQ,Loved the movie and every once and a while a DVD gets ruined.  Not a problem with streaming.  It is easy and the quality is better.,1362787200,,131,4.0

4268675,5,B0046GDYLQ,"This is really a beautifully done animation movie. It might be a little ""dark"" for younger children, but if you
appreciate how even the feathers seem indiviually done and their movement then adults will enjoy it and
older children will like the story.  It's a good versus evil thing.",1361491200,,283,4.775510204081633

The upside is that I can download it into my laptop so I don't feel as cheated. I just dont' have a constant internet connection for my daughter to mess with but not Amazon's fault.,1360108800,,324,4.158730158730159
4268686,5,B0046GDYLQ,I love what the producers of 300 did with this movie! I wonder why this movie wasn't hyped? Not sure if WB was afraid of over hyping it too much. But frankly I hope they continue the saga. Awesome slow mo's and graphics!,1360022400,,220,4.1395348837209305
4268687,4,B0046GDYLQ,"Great family time movie.  It kept my husband, my sons (16 & 8), and myself entertained and left us smiling.  It probably would have been great to see in 3D in the theater.  Glad we own it now.",1360022400,,192,4.0
4268688,3,B0046GDYLQ,"I'm sure the book is fantastic, but this 1 1/2 hour movie tries to cover too much in too short of a period of time.  There's no character development, the timeline is obscure, and the story just...isn't.  The graphics are utterly amazing and worth the price of admission.  Couple that with a killer surround sound, and it's worth the watch...once.",1359936000,,347,4.75

4268694,4,B0046GDYLQ,"The graphics in this movie are some of the best I have ever seen. The owls look so real and the world they soar through is truly a fine example of digital art. The movie itself, had my kids pretty much glued to the TV throughout. The sound was the only problem we found, no matter how we set out TV up, the voices in the movie were so quiet we could barely understand them. Not sure if that was a problem with my particular DVD or not. Otherwise, excellent movie and highly recommended.",1359244800,,486,4.180851063829787
4268695,4,B0046GDYLQ,"Is it me or does this movie feel like Star Wars except with owls? I could help but think of Obi Wan saying to Luke, ""Use the gizzard Luke... Use the gizzard!"" Oh well... Still liked the movie. Kids liked it too (ages 10 and 12). My 6 year old thought that the owl fighting scenes were a little scary. The 3D effects were good.

4268699,5,B0046GDYLQ,"The real 3D version is better than the Blu-Ray verison 2D converted to 3D by the player/TV pair. The 2D to 3D version leads to an eye fatigue but the real 3D Blu-Ray version does not. It is pleasant to watch. Played it through a Panasonic DMP-BDT220 3D Blu-Ray player and Panasonic TC-P65ST30 3D capable TV with Panasonic TY-EW3D3MU 3D Active Shutter Eyewear for Panasonic 3D HDTVs (Medium) (2011 Model) glasses.

4268726,4,B0046GDYLQ,"I read the Guardians of Ga'Hoole cause a friend recommended it to me. And fell in love with the story and the characters. Basically, it's about a Barn Owl (Tyto Alba) named Soren, he lived in a tall fir tree with his Mum, Da, Sister Eglantine, older brother Kludd, and their nest-maid snake Mrs. Plithiver. Soren was looking out of the hollow one night waiting for his parents to come back, and is shoved to the forest floor by his brother Kludd. Soren was captured and taken to St. Aggies, an academy for orphaned owls, where he meets Gylfie, a tiny Elf Owl. They meet Grimble, a Boreal Owl, who teaches the owlets to fly so they can escape. Then they meet Twilight, a Great Gray, and Digger a Burrowing Owl. And they work together to find a legendary tree known as the Great Ga'Hoole Tree to warn the Guardians of Ga'Hoole about a rising evil known as the Pure Ones. My favorite character has to be Nyroc (he hasn't appeared in the movie, YET.) or Coryn. I hate how they killed him off in the War of the Ember.

The movie: It's almost like the book. I know they can't make it exactly like the book, due to copyright reasons, but they could've done better.

Differences: In the movie, Soren and Kludd both fall out of the tree, and get captured, while in the book, Kludd pushes Soren out of the nest, and he captured. In the movie, Kludd and Soren are the same age. In the book, Kludd is older than Soren. In the movie the first High Tyto is revealed as a Greater Sooty Owl, when in the book the first High Tyto was never revealed, and it briefly mentions him. Kludd becomes full High Tyto until book six: The Burning. In the movie, the Pure Ones are St. Aggies, when in the book, St. Aggies, and the Pure Ones are two different organizations. In the movie, Soren and Gylfie meet Digger and Twilight at the same time, when in the book, the meet Twilight first, then Digger. In the movie, when they rescue Eglantine, she's still a barely fledged owlet. When in the book, when they rescue her, she's a fully fledged owl. Meaning she has all her adult feathers.",1356998400,,2059,4.359375
4268727,5,B0046GDYLQ,My kids saw this movie at the theater in 2D awhile back and really liked it then.  I purchased it in 3D and it was well worth it.  My kids loved it all over again.  I would definitely recommend adding it to your 3D library.,1356998400,,223,3.911111111111111
4268728,5,B0046GDYLQ,Very good clarity and was a fun movie to watch with good story line. I would definitely buy it again.,1356998400,,101,4.1

4268733,5,B0046GDYLQ,Its a shame they may never follow up with a sequel.  The movie is very well done the animation is almost awe inspiring how well it is portayed.  My childern love the books and love this movie.  Overall the storyline moves at first fast but then slows to a better pace which makes it easier to follow and the action never stops.,1356652800,,327,4.241935483870968

4268735,5,B0046GDYLQ,"I saw this movie at the theatre and was impressed about how the adventure to see the Guardians brought the young group of owls through a rough patch and grew, while learning about some of the good and bad things in life.  Belief in stories told by their parents brought them to the Guardians, who were able to help them re-correct the bad that had come in their lifes.  Excellent movie.  I had to have the DVD to enjoy again.",1356566400,,425,4.2875

I got her to watch it with me, thinking it would be something for background noise while we worked on a home project.  We ended up stopping said project and watched the movie instead.

4268744,5,B0046GDYLQ,I have children  who I took care of when I had a daycare and are now 11 years old.  They love this movie and I do.  They can watch it over and over.  Dislike nothing.  Would recommend to all parents of older children.,1356307200,,217,3.953488372093023
4268745,4,B0046GDYLQ,love this film - love the animation and the story.  children enjoy watching it; they love to read the books,1356307200,,107,4.35
4268746,5,B0046GDYLQ,"I wanted to see this when it was in the theaters and I missed my chance. Picked it up on the ""fly"" and I don't regret it, just wish I had a bigger tv because, wow, what AMAZING animation. That alone makes this film worth seeing. That being said, it is *not* a young child's film, it does get a bit violent and sometimes disturbing. I also have to mention, I've never read the books (and I'd say 95% of the time the book is better- not that you can compare a few hundred pages or more of detail condensed into a 2 hour movie). I am positive there are plenty of details in the story that was left out because the plot line and background is not always totally clear but you can follow it fine. I just can't give it less than a 5 because the intention with the story is very well-meaning and inspirational (good vs evil, typical of youth/animated films), and I just can't say enough about the beauty of this film. Visually awe inspiring. I lost my breath a few times.",1355702400,3,964,4.188172043010753
4268747,5,B0046GDYLQ,"I was actually disappointed. I only read the first book but was enthralled. The story was rich and deep and entertaining...the movie might be good for children, but it just bores me. However it's a gift and the person getting it will enjoy it. Thankfully they left out most of the negative things in the book and this is more fun and silly.",1355616000,,340,4.412698412698413
4268748,4,B0046GDYLQ,"I bought this movie because I'd seen reviews that it was visually stunning and was excellent in 3D.  I was not disappointed.  The plot isn't exactly new, good vs. evil, young hero facing overwhelming odds, etc.  What saves the story is that you can identify with the characters and that the actors whose voices give life to them, are perfectly cast.  The 3D is truly excellent, with no visible artifacts and some of the effects were truly wondrous.  I'm no expert on animation, but can only describe it as awesome.  Audio quality is excellent throughout the movie.

The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that occasionally, the movie departs from it fairly dark plot, to remind you it is based on a children's story.  That makes it feel uneven and can even jar you out of the mood that had been set.  Maybe, it is just that I'm too old for kid's stories.

One final thing.  There is one sequence where Soren embarks on a particularly dangerous task.  The music that accompanies the scene is so very haunting and perfect for what is happening, it is impossible to forget it.",1355443200,2,1075,4.541666666666667
4268749,5,B0046GDYLQ,My husband and I loved it. The artwork is beautiful. We had just rented it and decided that we will get the DVD in the future so we can watch it over and over.,1355443200,,159,3.7058823529411766
4268750,5,B0046GDYLQ,This is a great family movie. This price could not be beat! We are very happy with this purchase. This deffinately gets 5 stars!,1355184000,,128,4.375

4268752,4,B0046GDYLQ,"I thought this was a great movie, and would recommend it, for children over the age of 10.  It had great effects, and a great story line, but I love Disney movies, so for me this was a good move!  The only down fall, of the move, was the violence and bloodshed  not for small children.",1354838400,,285,4.053571428571429

4268754,3,B0046GDYLQ,"Good movie. BUT, I rented it to watch with my grandkids, 5 and 8. It was too scary and they couldn't follow some of the story. They watched part of it. We turned it off when the 5 yr. old said, ""This might make me have nightmares.""",1354492800,,231,3.9361702127659575

4268758,4,B0046GDYLQ,"The kids love this movie. The visuals are stunning. The voices are show that acting in animation make a difference. I am not familiar with the books, so I can't comment on that part. I liked the message and that good triumphs over evil. I wasn't bothered by the fact that it is ""dark."" Life is dark and I was right there when the kids were watching it, so any questions they had were answered.",1352592000,2,393,4.253333333333333
4268759,4,B0046GDYLQ,"LOTG is animated children's film with enough their to keep an adults interest as well.
This movie has quiet a few characters and I couldn't help but feel some of them just didn't get enough time to really make their mark the way the film makers where hoping they would. This film moves visciously,unapologetically fast and that's where lies the heart of the problem.
I was really surprised at how well the action sequences came across though and the 3D was exceptional. I think just about any child would love this movie.

I think without 3D this movie still looks gorgeous and you could definently spend your hour and a half watching far worse,but the 3D certainly adds to the experience here.
The biggest problem with Legend of the Guardians is the story just seems too big for the scope of this movie and I really wish they had a directors cut with an additional half an hour or so. The movie seems too focused on moving the plot along as fast as it can when I feel their where some moments it should have slowed down and let the characters ""breathe"" a little.

I would say this film is worthy of a weekend rental, and if your a 3D buff,worth keeping around in your collection.

Another plus to the 3D version of this film is a Looney Tune short which features wile e coyote and the Road Runner. It runs around five minutes and packs a great punch in 3D.",1351987200,10,1357,4.398406374501992
4268760,5,B0046GDYLQ,"I highly recommend Legend of the Guardians to anyone who enjoys animated movies. There is a pretty good story, good morals for adults to use in discussions in kids, and absolutely the most stunningly beautiful animation I have ever seen in an animated movie.

4268761,4,B0046GDYLQ,"This movie was a last minute choice after searching for something all of us were interested in. As it turns out, the story and animation was worth the every moment. The time we spent watching was filled with silence as there were no groans from anyone about why did we have to watch this movie. I would watch again without hesitation.",1350259200,,334,4.491803278688525
4268762,3,B0046GDYLQ,"Some nice animation, however I had something of a hard time visually telling the characters apart, and when they were in battle it was hard to tell which side was which at times as well.  However, a nice story of bravery, courage and character.

Not a movie I would like to watch multiple times though and I just don't see this being a favorite for the kids to watch either...but good to see once.",1350172800,,397,4.351351351351352

4268765,3,B0046GDYLQ,The animation and 3D effects were outstanding.  The detail on the animation was stunning--you could see the fuzz on the feathers of the owls.  The story was a repetition of many that have gone before.  This time it featured owls.,1348617600,,229,4.675
4268766,5,B0046GDYLQ,This is one of the most intelligent and cinematically beautiful movies I've seen in awhile. Great story with a great message. Highly recommend it.,1348358400,,146,5.125

4268777,4,B0046GDYLQ,"A bit of a retelling of ""The Hidden Fortress"" mixed with ""Excalibur"" but for the kiddies The Owls of Ga'Hoole is a dizzyingly beautiful visual feast on Blu-ray.  When brothers are taken from their home fear and courage separate them into camps of malevolent brainwashed bad guys and prisoner of war rebels who run into each other at movies end for their own personal showdown.  Because this is essentially a movie aimed at children the parent would probably think and expect that the brother turned bad would see the error of his ways and come back to the side of his courageous, righteous brother.  The parent would be wrong in this case as the story presents more of an unsettingly reality, and consequences, than what we have come to expect from the average kids movie.  Don't get me wrong: the good guys still win here but there are real losers.

After you see this movie do yourself more of a favor--patronize your local zoo and check out their owls.  They really are magnificent birds.",1344988800,2,991,4.666666666666667
4268778,3,B0046GDYLQ,"I would not recommend this movie for die-hard fans of Guardians of Ga'Hoole. Trust me you will be thouroughly disappointed as I was.
The Good Side: The movie was visually beautiful. The animation and the colours and landscape and everything. I especially like the symbolism in the movie. How around St. Aggie's was always dark and how Kludd had several dark markings on his face when he joined the Pure Ones but Soren's always remained pure white. I liked that. The score was great especially Owl City's To the Sky and they did keep up good enough with the characters.

The Bad Side: They didn't take time to really explain the situation. Soren and Kludd were suddenly captured by the St. Aggie's Owls and the whole purpose of the Pure Ones was not properly explained as well as the flecks. They just looked like strange fragments with mystical powers. But what upset me the most was how far they went from the story line. *SPOILER ALERT* Kludd first of all WAS NOT supposed to get snatched by St. Aggies and he wasn't even Metal Beak! That was the prime of the novels! And Nyra wasn't his mate either. My family didn't read the books and they could hardly understand the movie. And I was so very very disappointed. Where was Kathryn Lasky during this production? Did she approve of this?

Items on the foreground (mostly the one that had the focus) showed the least ghosting. I Googled for ghosting/crosstalk for this movie and found dozens of posts.

4268802,3,B0046GDYLQ,"First, the animation itself. Technology just keeps getting better, and this is riding the wave. The texture of the owls' feathers, their motion - it all comes together in a beautiful mix.

Then there's the story. I found it a comfortable mix of familiar ingredients, many of which recall Star Wars: the Yoda-like mentor, treacherous relative, and plucky band out to save their world from the evil empire. As stories go, it's solid craft, no rough edges, but hardly fine art.

I'm not in the target demographic, though. When I saw it, families with kids maybe aged 5-8 predominated in the audience, and the story seemed aimed at them. A couple of moments might have a skittish child on edge, but most of it seemed safe adventure with bloodless conflict and an encouraging moral or two somewhere in the background.

Other than casting bats as bad guys (I like the little critters), I found it visually arresting, but otherwise forgettable - unless I find myself entertaining a small child for a rainy weekend.

The story employs a 'coming of age' genre that will no doubt get very old very fast for adults required to view it multiple times as dutiful parents or grandparents, but the kids will stay fascinated.

4268811,4,B0046GDYLQ,"LEGEND OF THE GUARDIANS: THE OWLS OF GA'HOOLE flaunts an ungainly title and a cumbersome unfolding of  narrative. But, geez, it's so pretty to look at. The visuals are absolutely stunning, and it's a shame that the filmmakers couldn't invest as much in its ho-hum storytelling. It strives for an epic feel, but I think falls just short of grandeur. It features the coming-of-age tale of the owlet Soren. Soren has long been entranced by his father's tales of the Guardians of Ga'Hoole, them legendary owl warriors who once waged a great war against the despicable Pure Ones.

So far Soren has led a dull, sheltered life. He can't even fly all that well as yet. But one bout of oneupmanship too many with his more skilled brother, Kludd, results in their plummeting from their treetop home and onto the woodsy bottom. And owls have no place being on the ground, where they're rendered exceedingly vulnerable. Soren and Kludd are owlnapped and taken to the stronghold of the Pure Ones, them renegade owls still bent on enslaving the rest of their brethern. Their preferred method is to expose their victims to the moon's influence, ""moon-blinking"" they calls it, the moon in essence stupefying the unwary and transforming them into zombie work drones.

But I'm going on and on about a pretty generic plot. Suffice it to say, brother Kludd opts to stay with the Pure Ones, is enlisted in their savage troops. Soren escapes and embarks on a quest to locate the Owls of Ga'Hoole, to warn them about the Pure Ones. Along the way, Soren meets several companions, establishes a fellowship (this is mandatory in heroic quests). Thank goodness for the burly Twilight and Soren's snake nursemaid, Mrs. P. They provide most of what humor there is. This epic is so determinedly earnest and somber that even J.R.R. Tolkien thinks it needs to lighten up. Tack on characters with no grace notes and unfolding events that failed to draw me in and, really, the breathtaking animation is the sole reason to recommend this film. This is a visual spectacle in which to bask your eyeballs. Else, take the plot and the characters and the tired dialogue, and insert a live action format, and I think what you have is something the Sci-Fi Channel would be proud to call its own.

Parents, be warned that while there is no blood or gore, the film doesn't shy from rolling out scenes of fierce owl-on-owl violence. In this narrative, death is very much part of the order of things. Only, it's a higher evolved circle of life, what with various birds clad in armor and tearing adversaries with vicious metal talons. There are some very dynamic action sequences, not the least of which is Soren's harrowing showdown with Metal Beak, the malevolent chieftain of the Pure Ones. I wished I cared more about who won this death match. I guess I'm edging towards Soren, even though he makes Frodo Baggins seem breezy. But I harbor mad respect for Metal Beak whose creepy metal accoutrements make him look downright scary. You gaze at Metal Beak and you don't doubt he's capable of serious, er, foul play. Except that in a children's story, villains aren't allowed to win, so suck on that, Metal Beak. 3 or 3.5 stars out of 5 for this one, with its animated virtuosity and disappointing storytelling.",1326326400,3,3264,4.751322751322752

The computer animation is so real, beautiful and at times disturbing. This movie is not just for kids. But, the battle scenes aren't for the young kids. My 11 and 12 year olds watch this. I wouldn't recommend going too much younger unless they're really desensitized to violence already, which isn't recommended because we should protect the minds of the very young so that they're not exposed to ideas that they're not ready to handle. While there was no blood or gore, there are slashing enemies throats, birds falling hard on the ground, one bird falls in the fire and stuff like that. It's done tastefully, but just be warned. War is violent, and it is not sugar coated very much. Evil birds try to take over and their idea is that the strong rule the weak. The theme of the movie is fight evil, mend the broken and strengthen the weak. Overall, a great moral story with fantastic visuals and interesting characters.

Set in a fantasy world where air space is controlled by 2 sets of owls.

The first thing which struck me was the jaw-dropping graphics and animation - some of the best I have seen in recent digitally animated films.  The voice actors do a great job for their character's role, although Soren's voice did get a little annoying at times - funny because he is the main character.  The story was fun to watch unfold and entertained me even though there were really no new concepts explored - the characters and story are typical for fantasy/adventure titles. I love how the owls move and act realistically for what you would expect for talking warrior birds. This movie is a little darker themed, which for me was an interesting and almost refreshing change from watching other overly cheery/happy digitally animated movies of it's kind.  A caution to parents with kids under eight though - depending on the child, they may not be able to handle some of the battle scenes and strong character conflicts which occur later during the film. Personally I loved the battle scenes - they are very well directed and amazing to watch.  The owls fight fiercely and simply use crafted helmets and metal claws; which once you see it looks more realistic than it sounds.  Some people love it, some people hate it - I give it a 9 out of 10.  Although it is full of under-developed characters and has a usual 'good warriors versus bad warriors' plot with plenty of cliches thrown in, it has become one of my favorites (even though I am normally very annoyed by cliched movies) and I would recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy stories, owls, or spectacular digital effects.",1315440000,,1653,4.698961937716263

This film is a masterpiece, from the story to the very realistic visual effects. I saw this movie twice in IMAX 3D, and my money was well spent on this flick. The visuals are so breathtaking, it almost made me cry. The characters are pretty engaging, as well. My favorite character is Gylfie, because i found her to be cute. So, Legend of the Guardians is a fantastic movie. I need to read the books by Kathryn Lasky.

I wanted a movie that delivered great 3D special effects and on that had a good story line. I have to admit that when this movie premiered on theaters I was the first to criticize the movie without even seeing it first. But when I purchased my 3D TV I found myself searching through a somewhat limited amount of movies to choose from. All that said, this movie is amazing, a complete treat to your eyes, not only 3D wise but just special effects. The movie is very well made with a solid storyline, not the best storyline, but at least solid, I am sure one that most children will enjoy. the characters are very easy to fall in love with and care for.

This is definitely a movie to at the very least rent to experience. It's my believe that since with have such a limited selection of 3D tittles, all movies out there worth watching for the right price.

The movements appear very natural, even when they make the owls talk.  The 3D is the best feature film I've seen so far as well, there are a few documentaries that capture a better 3D effect but not any movies.  There is one scene where they are flying in a rainstorm that will leave you breathless, it is absolutely stunning.  As for the story, it is a little dark but I found it quite enjoyable, and nothing I would tell a child they couldn't watch.  I only wish it was a longer film to give more time for developing the characters and story.  However I think they did a great job and look forward to the sequel which they left plenty of the story open to the point it would be tragic if there was no sequel.",1302652800,,860,4.304347826086956

A friend came over and the kids were watching the dvd on their 37 inch hd tv...my friend was like WHAT IS THAT! lol. he couldn't stop looking at it(no joke it was that gorgeous).

The trees, water, flying and fighting of the owls, the shiny feathers of the owls...everything about this movie...ridiculous in detail.  GET THIS MOVIE!!!

The greatest thing about this movie is that the story keeps you interested.  Its not a movie where you buy only for the 3d.

I'm 20 years old, and I literally watched it about 3 or 4 times the first week I had it. That's how much I enjoyed it. Caution though: it may be based on the books, but there are several differences between the film and book versions (the basic storyline remains the same through everything, regardless.) Honestly, though, the differences don't even matter because the film is just stunning. The graphics are to die for, the soundtrack is perfect for daring owl deeds, and the characters are enchanting on the big screen.

4268864,1,B0046GDYLQ,"This movie has racial undertones. The owls are being subjugated by a ""superior"" group of owls that capture them and make them pellet pushers. (owl pellets being moved around and collected)The superior owls are all bowing down to a large female owl who is delighted by the other owls vying for her attention after they compete in flying abilities. The chosen owls are trying to fight the owls who are new and not quite conforming to their new subjugation.

The subjugated owls are put into a trance before going down into the lower area to collect and organize owl pellets. The three new owls try to escape being put into the trance. Two of the three new owls manage to not be put into a trance, they realize the third owl is under the trance and they essentially write him off as one of them at that point. The two new owls try to infiltrate the large female owl's status as a ruler and therefore dictator that is subjugating the other owls.

I won't spoil the ending for you. The 3d effects are stunning, similar to Despicable Me or Coraline, however the lighting on this film is always darker than that of the other 3d movies mentioned. I thought this would be a nice movie to show off the new 3d television, however, I would have liked to have been warned that it is a downer, depressing, dark, not much like any kids movie I have ever endeavored to watch. I love kids movies, I just got Bolt 3d (Disney)and I even loved Cats and Dogs the Revenge of Kitty Galore, but a dark owl movie about owls being subjugated by other owls into a second class slave race of owl pellet pushers is not my idea of a good time kids movie.

The visuals of the movie are the best I've seen for any CG made film and probably looks just as good as with Pixar is with their CG animated films.  I'd have to say that when it comes to the writing it seems that they were able to adapt things from the novels but they went about making it a little different than that of how the books are and changed it up a bit for some to help understand.

When I watched it for the first time I was interested in the standards of morality promoted by the movie; the age-old conflict between good and evil was clearly defined.

The temptations that evil might present to some and the difficulty of resisting if one is not solidly grounded by a moral framework is presented in a way younger audiences can appreciate.

The movie is an adventure filled with excitement, danger, and heroic acts of bravery. The 3D effect is nicely done and the surround sound very good.

I thought the books are rich and multi-layered.  The movie was thin and confusing.  If you haven't read the books, I think the movie would be very hard to follow.

4268888,4,B0046GDYLQ,"I got it dirt cheap and new so on that score I can't complain.
I also kept it for my extensive DVD collection (I wouldn't mind seeing it again).
Why?
Well, the sheer artistry was breathtaking.  The opening sequence had my jaw dropping, this is super-realism at its finest.  I can't find fault with the lavish beauty which was stunning throughout.  An A+++++++ there.
However.
I can only be mesmerized by shiny objects for just so long before my mind starts to wander.  This wasn't just art on a wall, there was a story involved.  Well, to be honest, neither involving nor evolving.  It's obvious they spent all their money on the wow factor and two bits on the screenplay, if that.
The F----- story (I'm being generous here), was a bare bones simplistic play of good against evil.  Like that's never been done before!  And better.  In this case, it's true that familiarity breeds contempt.  Every element has been culled by finer works, there was absolutely nothing fresh or new about the substance.  And this is probably why it was a dismal failure domestically (yet a hit on the international stage - go figure).
An exercise in futility?  Maybe.  But I still ended up with a begrudging fondness for the stupid thing.  I'd call it grim but exquisite.
Do I recommend it?  I'd say that would depend entirely on your expectations.  I was already forewarned so my expectations weren't high to begin with.  (It's impossible to be disappointed if you don't expect much at the outset.)  That's why I was surprised when I decided to keep it.  It's an emotional response.  It appealed to me on an artistic level and I didn't hate it.
I'm still hoping the book was better, if not...well, why make a movie of a crummy book?",1297987200,,1713,4.6092715231788075

If the makers of this movie think anyone is going to spend about $2k on a 3D TV to see a DVD in 3D they must be nuts, cheap and greedy.

Those 3D glasses in the theaters work but a lot of time the movie doesn't work in 3D. Bought several DVDs in 3D that provided those flimsy paper glasses. The reproduction of 3D was very good with the cheap flimsy glasses at home. It it better than in the movies because a lot theaters really can not run 3D as it should be. Some movies that claimed to be 3D in the cinema were in fact never 3D movies.

America is supposedly in an economical down turn. Provide 3D glasses with the retail version of 3D movies. One has to be nuts to buy shutter glasses and a 3D TV. No one even goes to the movies nowadays. And huge numbers just pay for one movie and spend all night or all day at the cinema.

4268895,2,B0046GDYLQ,"I read the books when I was younger, though I haven't kept up on the more recent releases, so I was excited when I found they were actually making a movie from the first three books in the series.  The trailers looked promising, though some things were clearly added or removed. The reviews were mainly favorable, so I bought the DVD, hoping for something that at least resembled the characters and events I'd read as a child.

No such luck.  The story was warped horribly - even though I can't remember details clearly from the books, I'm pretty sure St. Aggie's was not founded by Metal Beak.  Kludd certainly didn't fall out if the nest, nor would Soren have been showing off like that.  The flecks were shown as some sort of electrical magic...something, and even the main characters were turned into horrible caricatures that are almost nothing like their originals; Twilight, Digger, Otulissa...even Skench and Spoorn.

But alas, even if you ignore the books and let it stand on its own, it still wasn't worth it.  They kept just enough elements of the book to ruin the story it might have been had it been made independently.  Its character development was poor, the story was weak and predictable even if you don't know the books.  The movie feels rushed, yet never seems to go anywhere.

I wanted so badly for this movie to be enjoyable, but in the end, the only thing I can say for it is that it was beautiful.  Its incredibly well done animation is the only thing holding it up from a one rating, though I'd never recommend it to anyone.  Don't waste your time or money.

4268899,4,B0046GDYLQ,"When I picked this up I was expecting a run-of-the-mill children's animated film, complete with songs, cheesy jokes, and the usual.  From the second I started watching, though, I knew I was in for a completely different experience.  By the end of the film, I was completely blown away.  I mean, I was expecting something on the level of ""Monsters Vs. Aliens"" but instead I got the animated version of Lord of the Rings - you know, if Gandalf and company were CGI owls.

Speaking of the plot, this is the quintessential ""hero's tale"" that's been told and re-told about a million times.  That being said, if a film isn't compelling enough then this sort of story can end up feeling stale and re-hashed.  So, does ""Legend of the Guardians"" succeed or fail?  Well, I feel like it's a success.  I never felt bored the whole time I was watching.  Even though a lot of familiar elements and themes are present (hero's journey, family members betraying each other, evil overlords, etc.), there were also a lot of times where I thought to myself ""Oh, I bet that this will happen"", but it never did!  They managed to avoid enough of the cliches to keep the film from feeling too predictable.  My only complaints about the actual story are the fact that some things remain unexplained, and the film engaging in obvious sequel-baiting (something I'm not fond of since they can't really guarantee that sequel will ever come).  Overall, though, I'm pretty pleased.

So, I've already established that I enjoyed the film greatly - but I'm an adult.  Even though ""Legend of the Guardians"" is marketed as a children's film, parents might want to exercise caution in allowing their children to see this.  It's fairly violent (but not gory), and even though they try to throw in some brief comic relief, it has an overall atmosphere of seriousness and dread.  I couldn't really give you a definitive age range, but parents should know whether or not their children are too sensitive for a film like this.

Lastly, I need to mention why I've only given this film four stars instead of five.  It has nothing to do with the movie itself and more to do with the set-up of the DVD.  There are several annoying features that really irked me.  First off, when you first turn on the DVD player, if you don't hit the menu button immediately various trailers will start playing.  You CANNOT skip these!  If you try to hit the menu button during a trailer, it won't do anything.  You also cannot use the ""skip to next scene"" button.  So, you've either got to turn off the player and try again or wait through all the trailers (and there are a lot).  That's just cruel and inexcusable.  My second complaint has to do with the DVD options.  The only two options you get are ""play movie"" and ""Language"".  They didn't even have the courtesy to give us a scene select option.  Nor are there any special features of any kind.  I know some people don't care about special features, but I like watching the ""making-of"" documentaries and personal interviews with the cast and crew.  It would've been nice to see that here.  Well, anyway, those are my only real complaints.

Despite the minor irritations with the DVD itself, I still recommend this film.  Among hideously vapid movies like ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"", ""Legend of the Guardians"" stands out as a quality film that should not be missed.  Even if you're not entirely sure, just rent it first and give it a try.  You might like it as much as I did!",1296864000,,3467,4.607843137254902

I watched it four times in two days with my kid.  Kids loves the story and I found it good.  Yeah they kinds sped up events in it, but kids will not even notice that.

4268903,4,B0046GDYLQ,"The short version of my review is this: the animation is spectacular and makes up for most of the weaknesses in the film. Now for details. Those who have stated in their reviews that this is the most visually beautiful film they have ever seen are NOT exaggerating. As my family watched this dvd in our living room (on our 1080p plasma) my husband kept saying, ""We should have gone to the theater to see this in 3D."" It truly looks amazing. I can't speak to the blu-ray since we only have seen the dvd, but I imagine it would bring even more of the incredible detail to life. No one in our family had ever read or heard of the books this film is based on, so the story was unfamiliar to us, though it is a familiar enough story. Young owls are kidnaped from their peaceful forest home and enslaved in an evil kingdom. They escape, find the mythical Guardians, and become involved in an epic battle of good vs. evil in which they much face their fears, draw on strength they didn't know they had, etc. There are so many elements of the story that are familiar (basic hero's quest stuff) that even my kids kept saying things like, ""This is just like Lord of the Rings"" or ""That's like when Obi Wan dies"" or even ""This reminds me of Harry Potter."" The dialogue was difficult for us to make out (we kept having to turn up the volume), but I'm not sure if that is a fault with the sound or something to do with the Australian accents. The overall tone of the film is rather dark and dramatic, and the interjection of a perky Owl City song in the middle was somewhat jarring. My 13 year old son said, ""That's cute to have an Owl City song while we're literally looking at an Owl City, but the song is too cheerful."" The names of the characters were hard to understand, and we couldn't even read some of them when the credits rolled. All that being said, I recommend everyone see this film in order to understand the sheer beauty of the animation. I thought I'd seen everything that cg animation could do, but I'd never seen anything as jaw-droppingly gorgeous as this film.",1296518400,5,2067,4.329896907216495

4268912,4,B0046GDYLQ,"The Legend of the Guardians is a strange tale- and I'm not even talking about the actual film.  Hyped during its theatrical run (which began on September 24th of 2010), Warner Brother announced that it was scheduled for a mid-February DVD/ Blu-ray release.  Then suddenly (presumably in effort to capitalize on the spend-happy Holiday shopper scene), the DVD & Blu-ray were released and with virtually no hoopla on December 17th.  I nearly completely overlooked it as a result except for the fact that when preordering Despicable Me, I was recommended Guardians with the sub text ""available now"".

Going into the film, I was aware of the fact that the material would be joining an ever-growing list (a list that includes Shrek, Meet the Robinsons, How to Train your Dragon, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs to mention a few) of animated features based on popular children's book series.  This one was done up by the studio responsible for Happy Feet (Village Roadshow), distributed by powerhouse Warner Brothers and represents Zack Snyder's (the man responsible for such works as Watchmen and 300) directorial debut in animated feature film.

On the whole, Warner Brothers has been lagging behind in the highly lucrative animated feature market; a place dominated by Disney/ Pixar and DreamWorks.  Other studios in similar positions have begun to realize the potential in this segment and are putting in serious work to catch up (Sony with ImageWorks, 20th Century Fox with Blue Sky and so on).  WB hasn't proven quite as eager as the competition so converting Kathryn Lasky's series of young reader fantasy books into CG is about as good a place to start making up for lost time.

Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole' uses personified owls to weave its tale in a completely fantastical world (seemingly devoid of humans).  The plot works on the fantasy template on nearly a point-by-point basis:  A young, inexperienced (eventual) hero is introduced from the safety of his picturesque home.  Innocence and security are whisked away by invasion of a powerful enemy army, complete with a weapon of incalculable advantage.  The only force in the world capable of keeping the rising threat at bay have long since retired to the recesses of memory and myth.

The quest begins to not only prove the legend true, but to convince the Guardians to come out of their self-imposed retirement to once again rise up against this evil empire (The Pure Ones) to restore peace and harmony to the whole land.  Along the way there will be requisite betrayals, family division, advice from goodhearted heroes, training from hardened warriors, a better understanding of the horrors of war and why freedom is worth fighting to preserve.

If this all sounds familiar, that's because it's a story archetype that's been told countless times throughout the ages.  Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Eragon; you can find this precise tale in various forms of entertainment spanning literature, film, poetry, folklore and so on.  However, don't be mistaken into believing that because its formulaic, Legend of the Guardians comes up short.  But we'll get to that.

Notice the apparent lack of names included in my above story summary?  That was a deliberate homage to the actual experience in that upon the film's conclusion, I was confident only in the names of two of the fifteen main characters.

Names like Otulissa, Strix Struma, Ezylryb, Eglantine and Allomere were made clear to me only in post-viewing research and even then I was quite unsure which were which. Australian accents and little scripting effort to embed faces with the names results is a definite ""so that's the main guy's brother there?"" experience.  Fortunately, somehow, the film suffers none as a result of this little snafu.  A marketing disaster, sure, but the entertainment value endures.

And speaking of entertainment value, Legend of the Guardians is a visual feast! It can truly be said that Pixar and DreamWorks have absolutely nothing on Village Roadshow.  Lighting is spectacular, settings are rich with background detail and the character models are so well textured/ animated that they often border on photorealism.  The flight sequences, particularly when viewed in high-definition, are breathtaking.  I can only imagine what the experience must have been like in a 3D theater.

There are a few complaints to be voiced however.  The weapon of the enemy (an energy field that somehow captures owls and renders them helpless) is kept a complete mystery to the viewer for the duration of the film.  Whether or not it is better explained in the source material books, I cannot say, but aside from requiring tiny little pieces of metal to function, it is nothing more than a one-dimensional plot device here.

Also the PG rating should be taken quite seriously as, though animated, this film contains some pretty intense sequences that will surely unsettle the youngsters.  Additionally, even if the kid in question is desensitized to such things, the plot and themes would likely be a bit heavy/ hard to follow for younger tykes.

In all though, despite what surely sounds like multiple complaints, Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole' is a surprisingly solid piece of computer generated film.  The story is a bit clich yet it still manages to engross, the character and location names are a venerable mystery, yet the story manages to shine through, the 3D revolution may be a fad but the visuals here simply refuse to stop dazzling.  At the end of the day, the movie is 97 minutes of sheer enjoyable adventure: a classic tale of good versus evil, told with animation of absolutely epic proportions.  The fantasy element is quite strong throughout and offers fans of films like the Harry Potter series, Lord of the Rings and Star Wars a fully CG feature to relish.",1295568000,,5840,4.98968008255934

  It was a wonderful work of animation, but the story is horrible. I can think of around 5 differences from the books at a time. There are personality defects, I think some of the owls look weird, and most of the story is cut out. If you have watched a bit, there is no enchidna in the story either, (though 'the doubter' part was funny.) Also, some of the diologe sonds a little corny (out loud). Bacicly, they cut out too much from the books and added worse stuff, or nothing, in place of it. I wish they had sticked more to the books.",1295308800,,646,4.070866141732283

4268926,5,B0046GDYLQ,"As I had not read the books at the time, I came at this movie with no knowledge of the characters or the plot that had been covered by the author. As a result I was able to enjoy the movie on its own merits... aside from the vocal pop/rock song that played at one point very briefly - very out of place in such a beautiful and well crafted film. I was not sure if I would enjoy this movie as it was publicised as having been created by the makers of Happy Feet, a film that although beautiful, failed to impress at the storytelling level. The Legend of the Guardians therefore came as a fine surprise indeed. The story was cohesive, well paced, with characters that were distinct and likable. Coming from a 3D animation and visual effects background, I would be the first to nitpick but I really couldn't bring myself to, as I enjoyed it that much.

Shortly after viewing the film I purchased the first few books of the series and am now at book 6. I must say that despite SO much of the content having been removed or rewritten, the movie did the best that it could imaginably do in a short time frame. Yes, there is alot of wonderful content missing, but as a lover of the written word I'm happy to go to the books if I want to enjoy all of that. And I certainly encourage those who have enjoyed the movie to do the same! Rather than feeling you know everything that is about to happen because you have seen the film, the books will have plenty of surprises for you since they are so very different.",1294963200,,1501,4.211805555555555

I CAN NOT WAIT FOR THE NEXT PART! I want to see next chapters of the movie. It was so good.
Small things I disliked are: the accent. To me it sounded British. It reminded me of the''Narnia Chronicles'' movies that weren't that good. Personal opinion, not a terrible thing. And behavior of the owls. It seems so like a men behavior, even the way they talk. The main character is way to trusting and too kind. Of course it is done on purpose to depict difference, evil and good brother, but he is way too trusting and it seems a little too silly. I wish it was more of something else. The song by ''Owl City'', could be changed on something else, less known and much greater. By far so many know of ''Owl City'' and it could be changed on greater undiscovered or less known songs.
And as I mentioned above, I LOOK FORWARD FOR THE NEXT MOVIES 8P",1294876800,,1102,4.354368932038835

I had no idea this movie was based on a series of books until today, so my review comes from someone who has never read the books (although now I'll be going back to read them).

I had no expectations going into this movie and I was absolutely blown away. I watched it over and over. The characters are engrossing; the soundtrack is lovely; the animation is dazzling; the voice acting was great; the story isn't overly original, but certainly seemed to stay true to the world that has been created.

I think this movie is wonderful, magical, and brilliant. The time, love, and research that went into this movie are so apparent that it makes it all the more endearing. Plus, it's educational without even realizing you are learning.",1294876800,,930,4.491124260355029
4268930,3,B0046GDYLQ,"Since I haven't read the books, I can only give my impression of the movie, and here it is: Darwinists should squirm in their seats while their kids are watching this. I don't know if this was the author's intent, but it was pretty hard to miss.

The story is about some Hitler-type owls wanting to rule over all the other owls due to their supposed species superiority. They call themselves the ""Pure Ones"", hinting again at their claim to genetic right. Although the name itself smacks of religiosity, and had me wondering if it was supposed to be a hit on the Inquisition, etc., the script made it clear that the underlying idea was Darwinism's ugly stepchild - the idea that the superior race should rule by right. Although there has been a concerted attempt (and a flurry of popular books) to hide this unintended legacy, it is the logical implication that Hitler understood. In fact, Hitler justified his course using the language of Darwinism. (Although Darwin himself abhorred slavery, his theory was in fact used to further the mentality behind slavery - for example, the horror of aborigines hunted down in Australia to serve as museum displays of ""lower races."" Darwinism was also the inspiration for Planned Parenthood - most people are still unaware that Margaret Sanger started it to reduce the numbers of black, Asian, poor, uneducated, and other ""undesirable"" populations.)

Although rarely discussed, this implication of Darwinism still stands mutely in the corner ... hoping to be ignored in public discourse, but waiting one day to be reawakened.

(Richard Dawkins himself admitted he would not want to live in a Darwinistic society. Why? ""Because it would be fascism."")

There was also a message about faith and belief in what you have not yet seen, and the importance of intangibles such as love and courage. Since these are understood by Darwinists as mere chemical illusions conserved for survival value (just as some evolutionists have argued that gossip, rape, adultery and murder also have evolutionary ""value""), I would take this as another indication that this movie is on the other side of Darwinism.

Regarding the prophet echidna, it's hard to say without having read the book. At first he looks like a scam artist inserted for comedic effect or even to warn against religious hucksters. However, later he seems like the real thing.

Artistically, the movie cannot be much faulted. Almost every frame looks like a beautiful painting. However, in many scenes this quality of detail makes it hard to see what's happening or what's important. Since every feather and background element is rendered in detail, sometimes it's hard to see the owl for the feathers. More care should have been taken to balance the visuals. The battle action is fast and furious and - perhaps intentionally - unintelligible.

For its warning against the unstated dangers of Darwinism, it's worth a watch, although its ending seemed too deus ex machina with a convenient forest fire handy.",1294704000,,2994,5.0

The younger brother didn't have anything to say except wonder if we liked it.  Our reply was it was sorta okay.

First off, we never read the books, and I wasn't aware it was based off one.  The CGI in this movie is very good.  There are some breathtaking views.  The different kinds of owls were pretty accurate visually.  I didn't notice the music much, but what I did notice was pretty.  It never got in the way or seemed like too much for the current action.

Otherwise.. the storyline was pretty dry.  You have 3 owlettes.  the oldest boy seems to think he's oh so grown up.  Wants to be all serious.  Dreams and play are for babies, blah blah.  The brother has a natural gift for flight and he's jealous of him.  The kid sister is sweet and all around just loves everyone and likes to have fun.  The brothers get kidnapped and one flees for help, and makes a couple friends on the way.  Not extremely unique here, or particularly engaging.  In my opinion the only thing going for this movie is the obvious care that went into the visual aspect.  As far as the storyline.. if it was based off a book they only have so much to work with.

So I will give it a safe 3.  The kids will probably love it if they aren't in highschool yet, but all three adults were pretty bored.

The color and picture on this movie are fantastic, it has been such a long time since I have had the pleasure of watching such a beautiful film.

The story was interesting as well, even if it was the same basic storyline just with different animals, and kept the attention of several teens aged 14-19, as well as a couple little ones.  I am not one to watch animated films for more than background noise, and even when we do happen to pick one for our movie nights I will sit with the fam, but get work done on my laptop quietly.

4268945,5,B0046GDYLQ,"This is a visually beautiful film that tells of the ""Hero's Journey"" of a young owl who accidentally falls into the clutches of a group of power hungry owls who call themselves ""The Pure Ones."" Further, it is the story of his escape and his meeting with the legendary ""Guardians,"" who are pledged to fight evil.  The climax of the story comes with the ending battle between the forces of light and dark, and the the film tells of the young owl's adventures in finding his way between good and evil.  The story tells of his search for adulthood in the process.

This story does an excellent job of using the ideas and themes of Joseph Campbell in a way that is instructive and fun. The characterization is solid. The graphics are marvelous. There is humor and tenderness along the way.

While this is a good family story, do not show this to very young children.  Some of the battle sequences will be too intense for them.  However, this is not a gory film.  Gore is only alluded to(but sometimes strongly) in the movie.

It is unfortunate that this film has not received more attention.  It is a good story and the imagery is beautiful.  I wish I had been able to see it in 3-D. As some might say, that would have been ""epic.""",1293580800,5,1226,4.408888888888889
4268946,5,B0046GDYLQ,"When complex animation is mentioned, most people think of Avatar as the benchmark, but the characters in Avatar had wooden faces compared to the range of expression given to these owls. This has to be the best animation I have ever seen. Not only is almost every scene incredibly beautiful, but the characterization is amazing. With little more than eyes and a beak to work with the animators have created subtle expressions that give each owl a unique personality. On top of that there is a feather physics system that allows the animal's feathers to ruffle when they speak or move and even in response to the slightest breeze or movement. Incredible!

The storyline here is a simple one, the battle between good and evil and the coming of age of a would be hero, Soren. You won't be dazzled by the simple plot which has been done many times, but you'll be so amazed by the images, flight scenes, mid-air battles and characterizations that you won't care. From the sweet humble Soren to the cold Queen Nyra (voice of Helen Mirren),the only low spot in the entire film is a very poorly suited vocal track inserted during a training session at the Tree of the Guardians. The silly pop song ""To the Sky"" ruined that whole segment for me and I literally had to mute the volume. Check out the soundtrack on Amazon and compare it (only song done by OWL CITY) to the rest of the soundtrack which was done by David Hirschfelder who also did some of the music for the movie ""Shine"" and appears to understand what a film score is supposed to accomplish.  I can only imagine that it was the work of someone's relative who needed a music credit. It flies in stark contrast to the song that follows which is associated with a zen-like flight scene. That song is ""The Host of Seraphim"" done by Dead Can Dance's, Lisa Gerrard. This is not on the soundtrack but it is available here. In spite of that awful song the movie still rates a well earned 5 stars.",1293494400,4,1941,4.495750708215297

4268960,5,B0046GDYLQ,"I saw this movie in theaters in Imax 3D, and I was astounded by the visuals.  The atmosphere was breathtaking, and the animation of the owls was superbly done.  The musical score is incredible for an animated film.  This is one of the best animated films I have seen, and as for it being CGI... this is what CGI was made for.  I was more eager for the release of this film to Blu-Ray than any other film this year.

What I truly enjoyed about Legend of the Guardians is that it is not just another dumbed-down children's movie.  It does not look down on the intelligence of the audience.  There's no blood and gore, but the owls do wield some scary weaponry and participate in some intense battle scenes, and the tone of the story can be rather dark at times.  The danger to the characters is real, and there's a good deal of tension and suspense.  It reminded me of some of the older animated films like The Secret of NIMH in the sense that the movie takes itself seriously.  That's a refreshing change from the usual treatment that animation receives.  When I learned that Zach Snyder (300) directed the movie, I understood why, and he did a superb job.  I wish more film makers would take this approach.

After seeing the movie in the theater, I became interested in the books and I have read the first four so far.  If you have read the books and not seen the movie you will notice some definite differences.  Some characters are added, some are not present, and some have undergone some changes.  The story is based around the first three books, and much of the story in the books has been condensed.  This is the result of the screenplay adaptation process.  There's simply no way to fit the entirety of the books verbatim into a film.  The movie would be over three hours, and even at 90 minutes, the production cost is expensive.  There's also a matter of pacing the film for the audience, and having a complete story for a single film.  A sequel is always possible, but the screenwriters know that they need to tell a story without the necessity for a sequel.  I would have preferred a longer film myself with some more fleshing out of Soren's time in the Ga'Hoole tree, but as it is, the story is fine and quite enjoyable.  If you have seen the movie but have not read the books I highly recommend them.  They are written for older children, but adults can easily enjoy them, and after having read the books and watching the film again I was able to appreciate the film even more for knowing some of the smaller details better.

I recently encountered a superb deal on a 3D-capable Samsung plasma TV and 3D Blu-Ray player.  Tonight I watched this movie in 3D, and it was just like being in the theater again.  The visual quality is just incredible.  If you have a 3D-capable home theater, this is the version you want.  It includes a 2D Blue-Ray copy as well as standard DVD, so if you've been considering upgrading to 3D sometime in the near future then go for this version.  It's worth it if you like the 3D experience, and it's one of only a few 3D movies available at this time.

In regards to Charles Solomon's official review of this movie... potential buyers, ignore it.  Read the customer reviews instead of this recycled movie-critic drivel.  Amazon, if you intend to actually sell products like movies, please find people to review them that actually want to sit down and watch them, or at least have an open mind when they do so.  Solomon's review sounds like he was forced to sit through a movie he didn't want to watch in the first place and then had nothing nice to say about it as a result.  I wager that he's being honest in the sense that he personally didn't like the movie, but most of us feel differently about the film, and reviews like that certainly don't do much to help your sales.",1292630400,93,3816,4.426111908177905
4268961,4,B0046GDYLQ,"Background:

This movie is based on the first three books in the series, of 15 books that were written by Ms Kathryn Lasky. She finished this series in 2008. So don't be surprised if in the next year or so a sequel to this movie shows up. Ms Lasky has written about 100 books for children and young adults (fiction and non-fiction). However, make no mistake, this is not just a kiddie film, in fact it has been given a PG rating.

Storyline:

When two young owls fall from the safety of their tree they are kidnapped and forced to join the evil Pure Ones that have their base at St. Aggie's. Soren (Jim Sturgess) and his new found friends then journey to seek out the legendary Guardians (Jedi ??) to stop the evil plans of the Pure Ones.

The plot is not overly original, defeat the evil empire, and may the force be with you. The evil leader wears a black iron mask (although there is no deep breathing noise) reminds of an owlish version of Darth Vader.

Cinematics:

The graphics are simply awesome, there are a lot of sunsets, seaside scenes and massive trees that are wonderous to behold. The owls are also beautiful to look at the feathers move individually with the wind and the mechanics of flight are accurately portrayed. The slo-mo effects are wonderfully done, the final battle is quite dramatic.

Conclusion:

This film is among the best animated full length movies for 2010. It is very strong on its technical aspects. Although there is a lot of fighting, you are spared the blood and the gore. It is a great family film that everyone can watch and be entertained.",1292284800,19,1579,4.515789473684211
4268962,5,B0046GDYLQ,"The effects, the 3-D , the detail,  all amazing! The cruelty of Owls is not glossed over, neither is their beauty or their capacity to inspire awe.  Best animated movie of the year don't miss out on at least viewing it!

4268963,5,B0046GDYLQ,"This movie is about a young owl named Soren (voiced by Jim Sturgess) who is in awe of a story told to him by his father of a group of solider owls called ""The Guardians"" who fought and won a war many years ago that brought peace to the owl nations.  It is said that ""The Guardians"" live in a magical tree on the other side of the sea and they appear when owls are in trouble.

One day Soren is pushed out of the nest by his evil brother and they are both captured by the spinster owls of St. Aggie's.  Soren's brother joins the owls in their plot to take over the owl nations, but Soren refuses and is put to work gathering metal pellets to make a strange machine that the owls of St. Aggie's plan to use to kill ""The Guardians"".  Soren makes friends with another owl named Gylfie (voiced by Emily Barclay) and they both escape and set off on a quest to find ""The Guardians"".  The rest of the story is about their adventures along the way and their battle to bring peace to the owl nations.

This movie is stunningly beautiful to watch.  The 3D effects and the animation make for a visually stimulating experience.  The story is also inspiring.  Soren's belief in a legend about the power of good over evil gives him the courage to fight against seemingly insurmountable odds in his attempt to save all the kidnapped young owls.  There are times when the movie is a little dry, but the excitement at the end totally makes up for any slow scenes.

One word of caution on taking young children to see this movie. Even though this is a cartoon, the movie deals with themes that include the cruelty of war, prisoners of war and the kidnapping of young children. The most exciting scenes in the movie are the battles, which are graphic in parts so this movie is really not appropriate for children who get scared when confronted with these themes. My ten year old son is the perfect age for this movie. He loved every minute, especially the brutal fight scenes. We will definitely see more about these owls since the end of the movie was setup perfectly for a sequel.

""Legends of the Guardians - The Owls of Ga'hoole"" is a beautiful, enjoyable and exciting movie that is just made for 3D.  I would highly recommend seeing it.",1292025600,4,2221,4.374695863746958

4268966,3,B0046GDYLQ,"When I saw the trailer for Legend of the Guardians , I was so excited to see it. One of the main reasons was because it was directed by Zack Snyder and because the animation looked unlike anything I have ever seen in CGI. I finally got to the theaters to see it and I have to say that was let down.

First off, the animation was the best part of the whole film. I could not get over how breathtaking the landscapes were and even the way the characters were brought to life. These owls looked so lifelike and while they did talk and fight (yes they actually fought with blades), the way they walked and the way their feathers and wings went against the wind was astounding. The acting was very well done, getting a slew of well known names such as Jim Sturgess, Sam Neil, Hugo Weaving and Abigail Cornish. The only weakness this film had was the plot. I understand that the film was in fact the first 3 novels of this massive story.  The reason it failed was because the film was way too short. The movie started off really, really light and then went really, really dark. There was very little time for character development as well as plot explanation and that would have really helped this film. I have read the premise of these novels and it is an incredible fantasy story. Being able to make this film with the use of CGI gave it tremendous potential to be a great film. Still, when it comes to family oriented films you always have to remember a good portion of your viewers has an attention span of a common field mouse. Because of that major flaw, I would be quite surprised if a sequel is ever made, they have a lot to work on especially if they plan to put another 3 novels into one film. I would love to see possibly a directors cut or an extended version of this film so they can thicken up the story as it should be told.

Still, Legend of the Guardians is something worth seeing if not only once. Just the spectacle of it is quite amazing and just seeing how far we have come to making CGI films as real as live action. This film couldn't set a better example.",1291161600,40,2073,4.243037974683545

4268969,4,B0046GDYLQ,"Let me start off by saying that the visuals in this movie was BREATHTAKING. So much to the point that it's probably the main reason why the trailer appealed to me as it did. I personally don't think that it's too dark for some children,as some reviews may say. There is,however,some fighting and violence so if that's not your cup of tea then I wouldnt suggest it for you.

As far as in comparison to the books, it DID change alot of things(one of them being that there was both a Kludd AND a metal beak....there is a reason why that doesnt make sense but I won't say for those of you peeps that is reading the series and doesnt want spoilers)...also might I add that it isn't only based on the first 3 books. For nyra,a future mate of Kludd, doesnt come into the picture until book 4,The Siege. But it doesnt jeopardize the sequal worthiness I just think if there ever was a sequal(god I hope so!) it will stray even farther.",1289692800,,926,4.32183908045977
4268970,4,B0046GDYLQ,"""Legend of the Guardians"" is a brilliant creation, telling how ""The Guardians,"" a flock of ""good owls,"" foil the plans of ""The Pure Ones,"" a flock of ""evil owls,"" to rule the owl world. What they can't do with modern technology! Many times you'd swear these really were live, movie-screen sized talking owls -- with very expressive eyes that show emotion more clearly than those of many human actors. The dialogue, done by actors with British accents, is imaginative, in that the ""good"" owls talk like what I would imagine middle-class Britons sound, the plug-ugly ""bad"" owls, in a very broad cockney, and the ""rulers"" of The Pure Ones, like members of the nobility. It adds a lot to the story, as given the setting and situations, American accents would have grated on the ear.

 A few quibbles: Sometimes it's hard to tell which group of owls a particular creature belongs to; the plot can be a little difficult to follow at times; and the mid-air battles between owls, or groups of same, feature such rapid jump-cutting that a certain amount of the action is lost to viewers unless their eyes are much quicker than my aging ones.

 And, here's my main problem with what is otherwise a fine animated feature: Can't filmmakers ever get over the ""Nazi template"" and move on to some other type of villain? The group name ""The Pure Ones"" is obviously intended to conjure up visions of the Third Reich's race-based ideology. One scene shows the chief villain, making a stentorian speech to a crowd of his followers, and we're supposed to think of Adolf Hitler, thundering at a Nazi rally. An elderly, battle-hardened ""good owl"" has facial features and speech patterns that fairly shout ""Winston Churchill."" As depicted in history books and World War II documentaries, Hitler and his Nazis apparently have left us so handy an image of an ""evil regime"" that filmmakers can't resist returning to it, again and again.

 Nevertheless, that's a matter of my own personal preferences. I would definitely recommend this movie to those who enjoy a whacking good adventure story, done in modern animated form.",1289606400,,2096,4.857142857142857
4268971,5,B0046GDYLQ,"Good vs. Evil is the way to look at this movie. If you have a problem with the existence of ""evil"" you will most likely not enjoy this movie.

The story is filled with themes such as standing up for the weak, facing your fears and enemies- even if it's your own brother. At one point the brother of the main character joins the ""Pure Ones"" because they are strong. Why hobble yourself with the weak? He wanted to be the best, and staying with the weak doesn't work with that goal real well.

It's a story that shows that being good is more than being the best or strongest, though those traits may still also be necessary.

The main character of this film, a young male owl who has grown up hearing war stories of the past, eventually meets the author of those stories. He's old and scarred, and he finds the real stories aren't so glorious- they are ""Hell"". But then the old scarred owl says, that's the necessary point. To do good, you still stand up and do what's right, again and again, even if you end up looking like him in the end. Even the ""weak"" owls are given tasks in his camp, and their specific worth is pointed out.

The Owls shows your greatest challenges are usually yourselves. A harsh theme many adults rebel against in all their complexity, searching for reasons to justify bad behavior. Many adults prefer villains like Darth Vader who is wronged, is tricked, and then he goes bad because of it (outside evil or others made him do it). The owl's bad guys go bad all on their own, simply because they want to be better than the rest. The willingness to do ""anything"" to be the best and the strongest is their downfall. The outside influences are just the opportunity, nothing more.

This isn't the ""if you kill the bad guy, you'll be just like him"" philosophy that's so prevalent in most animated films and TV shows either. The Legend of the Guardians is in fact the exact opposite; To stop, and if necessary, kill the killer and end his reign, is the right thing to do. It's the land of the free, because of the brave themes. One of the hardest lessons of all is you might even have to stand up against someone you love.

It's a story that will appeal to kids (especially boys who crave good male role models), but the darkness of the fight scenes could scare very young children. 8 years and up is what I would give as a general rule.

The animation is an A+ --especially in 3D. The owls look extremely lifelike, and the story is original enough that it's an easy film to watch. As other reviewers have pointed out, it is basically bloodless. Real young kids probably won't catch exactly why a helmet goes flying off for instance...helping to give the stories mature message an easy way to get across.

I really enjoyed the movie, specifically because I found the themes to be so much more than in most movies- though this IS a KIDS movie. But even if you put all that aside, it's a good action flick too!",1289260800,4,2926,4.385608856088561
4268972,4,B0046GDYLQ,"Based on Kathryn Lasky's children's series (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Guardians-of-Ga-hoole-Complete-Set-Books-1-15/dp/0545172705/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Guardians of Ga'hoole Complete Set, Books 1-15</a>), The Legend of the Guardians: the Owls of Ga'hoole is an epic story of good and evil, bravery, betrayal and of doing what's right.

Briefly, the story centers around Soren, a young barn owl living in the forest of Tyto, who is enraptured with the tales his father tells of the Guardians of Ga'Hoole, the great warriors and protectors of the owl world who have passed into legend. When Soren and his brother Kludd are kidnapped and taken to a deep canyon where young owls are being ""moon-blinked"" into mindless slavery by the evil ""Pure Ones"", Soren escapes with another young owl and sets out to find the Guardians and plead for their help. Once they find the Guardians, a rescue is planned and the film climaxes with a soaring aerial battle between the Guardians and the Pure Ones.

The plot is not new. Fans of Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, among others, will recognize many of the story elements and several of the characters common to films and books based on the classic ""Hero's Journey"". So, the question becomes - have the filmmakers made this hero's journey one worth seeing? For me, the answer is ""Yes"". And that ""yes"" comes, in no small part, from how the film looks.

Legend of the Guardians is so completely spectacular to look at that I found myself able to ignore some of the issues with the plotting and the script and just sit back and drown in the visual feast. The ""scenery"" throughout the entire film - so jaw-droppingly gorgeous in theaters - translates very well to the home screen and the animation looks superb on Blu-ray. The flying sequences are not quite as breathtaking here as they were on the big screen, but all-in-all I think the film has made a successful transition to home viewing. Certainly it remains incredibly beautiful and exciting to look at. I wish all animated films offered the same visual pleasure.

Parents should be aware, though, that ""animated"" in this case does not translate into ""kiddie-show"". While there are moments of warmth and companionship and a few humorous bits, the film has a number of violent scenes and an overall intensity that might frighten or lessen the enjoyment of the under 8 crowd. I will volunteer, though, that my just under 8 year old granddaughter LOVED this film and didn't seem to find it too intense at all. So my age guesstimate might be a bit off. Since parents always know their own children and what they can handle far better than any reviewers do anyway, I offer the ""8 and over"" as a sort of jumping off point. :) I'll add, too, that the level of intensity I felt the film possessed on the big screen seemed somewhat lessened when I viewed the film at home.

A few additional notes on the film:
* There are a lot of characters with unusual names. Unless viewers (kids OR adults) have read the books, they're probably not going to catch or remember them all in a first viewing.
* There are a few instances where the dialogue is difficult to understand.
* The score suits the film. In parts it incorporates the human voice, as Lord of the Rings did, to effectively evoke an emotional response in the viewer. On the other hand, the song ""To the Sky"" (credited to ""Owl City"" on the soundtrack CD) was, IMO, the film's most glaring misstep. The chipper tune felt so out of place it actually made me cringe.

Some notes on the DVD (I bought the Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy version):
I'll admit straight off that I am not a techy person, so my comments on the quality of the video can be taken with that in mind. That said, the Blu-ray picture clarity is wonderful, the colors vivid and the sound good. For me, all are completely satisfactory. Navigation is pretty straight-forward and didn't trip me up too often - something I'm thankful for and something I, unfortunately, can't say about all DVDs.
The film can be viewed in English, French, Spanish or Portuguese. Subtitles in those same languages are also offered.
Special features include:
* ""True Guardians of the Earth"": The animated character Digger & Rico Rodriguez (Modern Family) host a documentary about owls which presents interesting information in a kid-friendly style.
* Maximum ""Kid"" Mode - Explore the World of Ga'hoole"": Soren and other cast members act as guides for this picture-in-picture style viewing of the film. Information is offered on animation and various aspects of filmmaking and storytelling. Well done. Should be particularly interesting to young people interested in behind the scenes stuff and the nuts and bolts of filmmaking. Also included is additional scientific information about owls, their anatomy and their habits.
* Legend of the Guardians: Armor up with Soren & Eglantine: Kids can mix and match different types of owl armor.
* Match the Owl Treats: A matching game.
* ""Legend of the Guardians: Rise of the Guardians"": A short film about the Pure Ones and the legendary Battle of the Ice Claws between Metalbeek and Lyze of Kiel.
* Looney Tunes ""Fur of Flying"": The Road Runner/Wile E. Coyote cartoon featured in theaters along with LOTG. (On the 3D version of this DVD, this cartoon is also in 3D.)
* Artwork Galleries: stills of some of the lovely artwork from the film.
* ""To the Sky"" music video by Owl City.

For my granddaughter and me, this film was a winner and now that it's part of my home collection, I'm looking forward to sharing it with my other grandchildren over the next few years as they grow old enough to appreciate it. While the plot may be rather familiar, IMO it avoided coming across as tired or trite. That, along with the stunning look of the film, makes it easy for me to recommend it. And I do, happily.

4268974,3,B0046GDYLQ,"First, the animation itself. Technology just keeps getting better, and this is riding the wave. The texture of the owls' feathers, their motion - it all comes together in a beautiful mix.

Then there'sthe story. I found it a comfortable mix of familiar ingredients, many of which recall Star Wars: the Yoda-like mentor, treacherous relative, and plucky band out to save their world from the evil empire. As stories go, it's solid craft, no rough edges, but hardly fine art.

I'm not in the target demographic, though. When I saw it, families with kids maybe aged 5-8 predominated in the audience, and the story seemed aimed at them. A couple of moments might have a skittish child on edge, but most of it seemed safe adventure with bloodless conflict and an encouraging moral or two somewhere in the background.

Other than casting bats as bad guys (I like the little critters), I found it visually arresting, but otherwise forgettable - unless I find myself entertaining a small child for a rainy weekend.

4268975,5,B0046GDYLQ,"The Owls of Ga'hoole was definitely the most beautiful movie I've ever seen. And it's use of 3D was amazing. I liked the use of 3D in this even better than the 3D in Avatar. It was that good.

When I first saw it on the theater screen I was blown away, even from the first credits. This movie has a depth and ""realism"" that truly shows what 3D is capable of, without getting at all gimmicky.

The story is a general coming of age story, of myths and legends and people who still believe. It's about family, and dreams, and all the things that touch us most. The design of the owls was outstanding, giving a natural expressiveness and uniqueness to each owl was a big feat considering how expressionless and similar looking owls actually are. But the subtleties in the expressions in this movie were simply amazing to see, and each owl had it's own distinct character, look, and voice.

The backgrounds were beautifully rendered, but also very real looking. It was that golden mix of a fantasy world that looks real, without losing any of the power and message of the fantasy.

This is a good vs evil story, and the scenery reflects that, from the comfortable, normal, forest home in the beginning, to the dark and sinister mines of the ""Pure Ones,"" to the busy and optimistic bustle of the great Tree of Ga'Hoole.

Even the water scenes in this movie were outstanding, and water can be a nightmare to animate, much less when animating feathers, and wet feathers at that.

I agree with the other reviewer who said they need an art book for this movie. Truly, if you see no other movie this year, go see Legend of the Guardians in 3D. This is one of those memories that stays with you forever. One of the GOOD ones.",1286409600,72,1713,4.439490445859873

4268978,5,B0046GDYLQ,"The Owls of Ga'Hoole is one artistic movie of such beauty I nearly cried for joy at the animation. I have an art degree too so for someone who looks at (ROBERT BATEMAN) books (SEE HIS ART) I am quite picky at my art. (VIDEO GAME)""Game Informer Magazine"" wrote a 5 star review for it, and they tend to rip some people a big one not so much in always a good way due to their standards! The story is for all ages as my family kids from 3.5 (and the 3.5 yr old is starting to learn concepts), to grandparents who liked it and felt it was calming for the blood pressure, to thirty and fourty year olds with 2-3 teenagers went as a group in my family. Kat got over her fear of owls. It is the classic struggle between right and wrong, good and evil, light and dark.  Teachers and students in this story (it really is a good book series and movie for kids who are in school as the principals are good in it) and represents the will to keep fighting and going forward as well as good leadership, teamwork, family, and social networking examples.  The owls even have schools of learning.  I want them to come out with an art book really bad! Soundtrack is good and I wish I would have wrote this book series as it is something the author in general fun and learning should be proud of.",1285977600,2,1276,4.157894736842105

8417239,3,B0046GDYLQ,"The animation is beautiful but the story line is choppy, hard to follow, way to much fightiing. I have a feeling most of the storyline ended up on the editing room floor.

8417246,5,B0046GDYLQ,"Zack Snyder's films might have most superhero fans seriously divided concerning his works, but Legend Of The Guardians(no relation to the Rise Of The Guardians), which was based on the Guardians Of Ga'Hoole children's book series by Kathryn Lasky usually gets positive reviews. This fully CGI animated filmn collects the first three books in the series into a single timeline, and was an American/Australian production done mostly by the outback's own Animal Logic, which also created alot of the effects for The Great Gatsby.

A family of owls dwells in peace in their forest in Australia, but the two sons Soren and Kludd are kidnapped by thug owls working for the Pure Ones, an army of renegade owls lead by the scarred Metal Beak amassing numbers in their efforts to conquer the lands. Soren befriends the smaller owlet Gylfie, and the two manage to escape the Pure Ones, while Kludd is seduced by Metal Beak's consort, the malevolent Nyra. The two escapees run into a duo of stray owls, Digger and Twilight, and they all head for the great tree of The Guardians, the ruling kingdom of owls that maintains peace throughout the region. The young heroes tell their story the The Guardians, which leads into an epic battle of owl vs. owl with talon daggers, battle armor, and a magnetic sonic boom!

The film works surprisingly good considering it ties together three whole books, even though your average children's novel isn't more than 100 pages, but it also carries out as an exciting fantasy/adventure. It captures the essence of Don Bluth's The Secret Of Nimh, along with the style of fantasy in a Tolkien story. The animation is even beyond Pixar standards, and truly excels by making the owls appear as actual owls while still taking on human personalities. Despite alot of conflicting criticism on his works after this, Zack Snyder put together a well crafted production, both in story and development. The voice cast is top-notch too, with stars like Hugo Weaving and Helen Mirren. Forget the DVD, and just get the Blu-Ray to enjoy the pure visual glory!",1523836800,,2065,4.880341880341881
