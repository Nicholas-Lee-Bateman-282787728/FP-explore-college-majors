Great family entertainment.  The message always reminds me of how it used to be.",1301443200,14,244,4.260869565217392
4283962,5,B0047BXR1M,"This set will include:

Lassie Come Home (1943)
Son of Lassie (1945)
Courage of Lassie (1946)
Hills of Home (1948)

From the press release:

In an unusual departure from its practice in their TCM's Greatest Classic Films line, Warner is including a new-to-DVD title, Hills of Home (1948), in its just announced TCM Greatest Classic Films: Lassie set.
The fourth entry in the Lassie film series, Hills of Home stars Edmund Gwenn, Donald Crisp, Tom Drake and Janet Leigh.
It will be a 2-disc set and will street on February 1st. All the bonus features from the previous three releases will carry over, plus two new ones:
Vintage Short Fala at Hyde Park
Classic Cartoon Puttin' on the Dog

End of press release.

This was actually pretty good news from my standpoint since I have always been exceptionally fond of ""Hills of Home"" and wondered why Warners didn't put it out on DVD when they were releasing all of the other Lassie films. Hills of Home has plenty of Lassie in it, but it mainly focuses on Edmund Gwenn as Dr. William McClure, a village doctor in late 19th century Scotland that gets tricked into taking Lassie as payment for his services, and then learns that the dog has a flaw that makes her worthless as a working dog - she's afraid of water. McClure has always been a stoic and practical man, but he finds himself binding to Lassie in spite of her flaws. It's a very heart-warming film and I highly recommend it as I do this economical set of Lassie films.",1289088000,26,1471,4.556818181818182

She's only 6 and the other granddaughter is 4, but they seemed to like it.  It's one of my favorite movies.  The quality was fine for an old movie.  I don't know how the other three movies are, as I left the DVD with the family as I returned home.  Hope they watch the rest of the Lassie movies and like them.",1477699200,,456,4.067415730337078

4284076,5,B0047BXR1M,"These were some of the original Lassie films, and once you see them, you'll know why Lassie was so popular, from then, forward. The action and sets are very good, and the adventures are well done and believable. Lassie, the consumnate actress/actor, is gorgeous, brave and convincing.

The outstanding cast of actors maintains the quality and interest of the stories, and you should find them very enjoyable, and your kids will love them. (despite the fact that it is a given that Lassie always comes out on top, and the bad guys lose.  No mystery there.)

The variety and depth of the characters she meets on her adventures are very well played, and even many or the antagonists are depicted as misguided, and many come around with improved attitudes, by the end of the films.

These are films for the whole family to enjoy. I recommend them highly.",1356998400,8,850,4.722972972972973

It stars the same fellow who was Santa in ""The Miracle on 34th Street""-Edmund Gwenn.  He is superb, and the 'Hills of Home"" is the best of these charming movies, in my opinion.

8417929,4,B0047BXR1M,"The four films feature one of the great method actors of all time (Lassie). The first three (1943-46) have character greats like Nigel Bruce and Frank Morgan with location filming in California and the Pacific Northwest (imdb identifies specific sites). A young Elizabeth Taylor performs intensely in the second and third--with a co-star for once that matches her in ability and beauty.

Parental advisory for ""Lassie Come Home"": heroic Toots is killed, gratuitously and on screen.

Courage of Lassie (1946) sympathetically depicts Lassie's combat-induced PTSD, providing a fascinating counter to the Hollywood master narrative of WWII.

Beware the fourth film, ""Hills of Home""(1948). Despite three stars from Leonard Maltin, this one lacks the charm of its predecessors. It's watchable, but Lassie has a reduced role. Janet Leigh has little to do. Actors are directed to employ hokey Scottish accents, and the American actors are especially hard to understand except when they forget to burrr. . . Studio scenes give the film a claustrophobic feel.",1518825600,,1049,5.384146341463414
