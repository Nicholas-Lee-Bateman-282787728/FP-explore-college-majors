7763911,4,B01GKED57Y,"It is difficult to recommend a movie that left me with such bitter taste as Desde Alla did . Directed by Venezuelan newcomer Pablo Larrain , it tell the story of middle age orthodontist Armando who leads a lonely life in Caracas and often pays street youth to undress for him . Early in the film he develops a fixation for a specific one , cheeky and aggresive Elder . The relationship between the two men is initially highly problematic and seems to be based entirely on money . Slowly though it turns into something that entails appreciation and respect ,  Armando is obviously damaged psychologically by something that his father did . It's difficult to decipher what his motives towards Elder are and vice versa . Is it a warm embrace  that he is after ? A son figure ? Or is it maybe plain lust ? Elder on the other hand , enters the relationship highly dissmisive of Armando but gradually contributes to it more and more .
 It is often what's not said and showed in this film than what is indeed displayed that's more haunting . The motives of the two parties are unclear the whole way through and the movie experience is frustrating , intense and challenging for the viewer . It's the two main perfomances that make this rather eliptical story work. Chilean actor Alfredo Castro adopts a hypnotic , combra-like mask which Armando wears non stop to hide feelings and thoughts while Luis Silva is rude , explosive and almost as generous in his acting as Elder ends up being in this story . The ending , a dark statement on human relationships perhaps ,is totally unexpected and one that makes Desde Alla a movie impossible to love but at the same time difficult to forget .",1472688000,7,1678,4.5131578947368425

8763126,3,B01GKED57Y,"What a strange little movie. More like a you-are-there on the mean streets of Caracas. With a surprise ending that was unexpected. Goes to show that poverty, corruption and little hope in an environment,can bring out both the best and the worst in people.
In this case, a street hustler of ambiguous sexual persuasions and a lonely middle=-aged man meet on an encounter that leads to something neither expected. Both the two main characters have an interesting time negotiating what to do with their meet ups, and the sad streets of Caracas, provide an atmosphere where anything can happen, and does! Worth a look just for how the story unfolds.",1477785600,,645,4.872727272727273
8763127,3,B01GKED57Y,"This is a situational slow-moving film that has its moments. However, there is a continuous vague feeling of being unfulfilled. Ultimately, we see rank and unexpected hypocrisy that leaves one feeling rather disgruntled, and sad.",1477180800,,229,5.571428571428571

8763129,4,B01GKED57Y,"An existential drama shows us the life of a mysterious and lonely man who hides a bitter past. He is a Peeping Tom and pays for watching. The picture places us around closing and opening doors (Bresson in Joan of Arc) subtle angles in which the camera is like a mute witness, through unsaid absences, restrticted emotions, visible anguish and inner despair of both beings.

But there's something around hovering the atmosphere. I won't incur to let you know more about the plot. That runs for you. As Venezuelan citizen I pride myself to know this film has won The Golden Lion in Venice . Note for instance, the vital silence and the minimalist ambiance that reminded me too much Mouchette's Robert Bresson (which is much to say).

Excellent cast. Go for this revelatory story that could take place anywhere, anytime!",1474761600,,817,4.787234042553192
