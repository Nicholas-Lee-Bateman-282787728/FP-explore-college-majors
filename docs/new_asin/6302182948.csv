434989,2,6302182948,"Watching this film the other day, I really was ready to like it since I've always appreciated a good Peter Lorre thriller.  Well, for one, this is not a Peter Lorre picture, the protagonist is the most insufferable character whose inner thoughts tell us what a simpleton he is, just a notch above his girlfriend, who is frightened of I don't know what because then she purposely puts herself in jeopardy.  There no tension here to keep one on edge, nothing, just the constant droning of the guy.
I don't usually bother to write negative reviews, but this one made kind of angry at the waste.
Miss this one.",1433721600,2,606,4.5504587155963305

434991,5,6302182948,"This is a powerful movie! John MacGuire plays a news reporter named Mike Ward whose honest but faulty eye-witness testimony leads to the murder conviction of a young man named Briggs, played by Elisha Cook Jr. After Briggs' conviction, Mike gets promoted and proposes to his girlfriend, Jane. Jane begins acting coldly toward Mike due to her suspicions the wrong man may have been convicted. Soon, Mike is haunted by similar doubts. He has suspicions about a strange man he spots hanging around his apartment building (the ""stranger"" of the title), but no real evidence. Until...

Going any further would spoil the film.

The direction, cinematography and music score are all excellent, and help make this a first-class mystery-thriller. Despite the fact that most of the lead actors are not very well known, all the performances are terrific, and make this into a powerful, riveting movie all the way through. A flashback scene of the murder trial of Briggs (as recalled by Mike) which Briggs screams passionately about his innocence after the jury finds him guilty is very unsettling, as are several other scenes.

One ""moral"" I took away from this film: Don't ever make threats of violence to anyone, either explicit or implicit. Suppose you threaten to get even with someone and that individual was found murdered a day or two later? Would you have a plausible alibi?

The entire film only runs 64 minutes, which works in its favor. The story moves quickly yet never feels rushed. (If you miss just one of the 64 minutes, you'd likely miss a major plot point.) I give ""Stranger on the Third Floor"" my highest recommendation.

As an aside, I want to clear up a common misconception about the definition of a ""B movie"". Many people erroneously believe that a ""B movie"" means a bad movie. In fact, ""B movie"" was the term used to describe the second film in a double feature. The ""A"" movie tended to have big-name stars and high production values. The ""B"" movie that followed the ""A"" movie usually had lesser-known actors, a low budget and a short running time. Those aspects do NOT necessarily mean a ""B"" movie is a bad movie; in many instances the ""B"" movie on a double bill was better than the ""A"" movie which preceded it. ""Stranger on the Third Floor"" is an example of a first-rate film that is also a ""B"" movie.",1427500800,,2316,4.7227722772277225

435030,4,6302182948,"I love Peter Lorre, so seeing a film noir with him in it was definitely the topping on the cake. I don't know of any other person who is both horribly creepy and so adorable at the same time. I think that is a quality that is unique to Peter Lorre. Other than the fact that Lorre was in the film, I also enjoyed the classic film noir qualities of the film. I especially liked the lighting. It is so dramatic and adds visual interest to the film. I think that with film noir, one of the things that makes it so successfully tense is the harsh lighting that is used. The high contrast is so unnatural that the film seems dreamlike, or nightmarish, rather. The dreamlike quality of the film is stretched even further during the scene where the main character is actually having a nightmare. Another thing that I love about film noir is that there are parts of the film that seem happy-go-lucky and have that classic Hollywood charm. For example, the scene at the beginning of the movie has this charm about it as the couple meets in a diner for breakfast and has light-hearted conversation. While film noirs have the obvious dark side, there are also spots of sunshine through out that seem to contrast it. I think it is this sense of tension and contrast that makes the films like Stranger on the Third Floor so great. Whether it is with the brights and darks of the lighting or the different feel of the scenes, film noir keeps us interested. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys Peter Lorre, film noir, classic movies, or just intriguing plotlines. I really enjoyed watching this film and feel like others will really enjoy it too.",1305072000,14,1643,4.48

The movie is relentless with its dark lightning and the presence of some strange characters helps drive home the environment of bleakness. It has a few twists and its well written. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is a fan of dark, psychological dramas.",1303948800,20,500,4.5054945054945055
435032,2,6302182948,"Stranger on the Third Floor is a real thriller but one that is rather comical for today's standards of thrillers. This film is a great film noir thriller. The setting, shadows, camera angles, winding staircases, and a relatable protagonist create a spellbinding crime thriller. The most impressive attribute of this film is that it is film almost entirely in one location: the street.  This style is enormously effective in the film noir category. The reporter's girlfriend plays a crucial role as she traps the real killer in a dark and sinister way. This film is great for film study in that it is short and had incredible photography; this being so, it is great for analyzing the so-called first film noir. I almost wonder if Hitchcock found his muse in this film. I love studying the camera angles of this film, the images of the prison bars, the electric chair, the odd dream sequences, etc. The camera work of this film, I think, should be talked about more than the fact that it is the pioneer of film noir. The camera work is innovative and creative and cannot be missed. For all those film lovers out there, this is something you cannot miss. The creation of suspense is established in a deranged and illusive way. The ending is paramount for the film--it's so great. The sinister nature of the thriller is encapsulated in the ending. This is most definitely a psychological thriller.  I do think that the script could have been a bit better/stronger. There were definite moments of weakness there. Almost echoing that of Italian neo-realism, the use of unknown actors did this film really, really well. It allowed the audience to really get into the picture and it allowed the film much more suspense and fear. Great film.",1303862400,5,1732,4.77

I probably should have bought the pricier ($34.99) WB archive version (cover with artwork), as this one is allegedly ""remastered"", hopefully its video quality is better (although I've been burned before with lousy so-called ""remastered"" releases).

435037,3,6302182948,"The film begins on a city street. A young couple talk about their new home. Michael Ward is a star reporter who is a witness in a murder trial. He saw Briggs by a murdered lunch store owner. He saw him once a few days before. Briggs explains he walked in and found the owner dead. Does the jury believe him? They find him guilty. The reporter visits the scene of the crime. Back at the rooming house he sees a stranger there. After this there are flashbacks and voice-overs to carry this story forward. This allows minimal characters for this low budget film.

The film moves forward with a crime for which Michael Ward is convicted and sentenced to death. [People didn't lock their doors!] Could this only be a nightmare from his imagined fears? What will happen if this dream comes true? Ward calls the police to report this murder. He is now a material witness (and a suspect!). Ward's girlfriend tries to find that strange man, but nobody has seen him. Then she finds a man who fits the description. This man does not want to go back to the institution! But there is a happy ending to this story.

[It reminds me of a TV drama from the late 1950s like ""Outer Limits""] ""The Woman in the Window"" was a better film.",1197504000,6,1216,4.376106194690266

SPECIAL FEATURES BIOS:

1. Peter Lorre (aka: Lszl Lwenstein)

Date of birth: 26 June 1904 - Rzsahegy, Austria-Hungary [now Ruzomberok, Slovakia]

Date of death: 23 March 1964 - Los Angeles, California

Special footnote, actor Peter Lorre (June 26, 1904 - March 23, 1964), born Ladislav (Lszl) Lwenstein, was a stage and screen actor of Austrian descent especially known for playing roles with sinister overtones in Hollywood crime films and mysteries....He began acting on stage in Vienna, Breslau, and Zrich. In the late 1920s he moved to Berlin where he worked with German playwright Bertolt Brecht. The German speaking actor became famous when Fritz Lang cast him as a child killer in his 1931 film ""M""....then London where he played a charming villain in Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"".... When he arrived in Great Britain, his first meeting was with Hitchcock and by smiling and laughing as Hitchcock talked, the director was unaware that Lorre had a limited command of the English language. During the filming of ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"", Lorre learned much of his part phonetically.....Eventually, he went to Hollywood where he specialized in playing wicked or wily foreigners. He starred in a series of ""Mr. Moto"" films, a parallel to the better known ""Charlie Chan"" series, in which he played a Japanese detective and spy created by John P. Marquand....Lorre enjoyed considerable popularity as a featured player in Warner Bros. suspense and adventure films. Lorre played the role of Joel Cairo in ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941) and played the role of ""Ugarte"" in the film classic ""Casablanca"" (1942). He played Dr. Einstein in ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" (1944-filmed in 1941). It was Lorre's character who introduced the ""letters of transit"" (there was no such thing in reality) which became, in some ways, the dramatic center of the film.....But Hollywood never fully tapped Lorre's creative powers.

Hats off and thanks to Les Adams (collector/guideslines for character identification), Chuck Anderson (Webmaster: The Old Corral/B-Westerns. Com), Boyd Magers (Western Clippings), Bobby J. Copeland (author of ""Trail Talk""), Rhonda Lemons (Empire Publishing Inc), Bob Nareau (author of ""The Real Bob Steele"") and Trevor Scott (Down Under Com) as they have rekindled my interest once again for Film Noir, B-Westerns and Serials --- looking forward to more high quality releases from the vintage serial era of the '20s, '30s & '40s and B-Westerns ... order your copy now from Amazon where there are plenty of copies available on VHS, stay tuned once again for top notch action mixed with deadly adventure --- if you enjoyed this title, why not check out VCI Entertainment where they are experts in releasing B-Westerns and Serials --- all my heroes have been cowboys!
