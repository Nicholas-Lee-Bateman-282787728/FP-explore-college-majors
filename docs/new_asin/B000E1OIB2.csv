2482264,4,B000E1OIB2,"I love this movie!!!  The story line is great.  I did not find any of the scenes offensive, as some customers indicated.  The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the item description states closed captions.  There are no subtitles or captioning.  I am a little hard of hearing, and really like these features when watching movies.  I am keeping my copy anyway, hoping to find a version later which does have the subtitles or captioning.",1307318400,,454,4.54320987654321
2482265,2,B000E1OIB2,"Audrey's Rain started out with swearing right out of the shoot.  It has a good story, but was disappointed in the many instances of swearing.  Life on Libery Street was better, no swearing, but maybe a little uncomfortable for those that are not used to the mentally handicapped.  But it does have a great story line.",1287446400,,317,4.625
2482266,5,B000E1OIB2,"I absolutely love this movie.  It's a heartwarming, beautiful story.  And the setting of the movie is so homey.  Just shows you that life's not always perfect, but it is still beautiful.",1271548800,,186,4.75
2482267,5,B000E1OIB2,"Enjoyed both movies. Good to sit and watch a movie without sex, violence and foul language.",1271030400,,91,4.75
2482268,4,B000E1OIB2,"I really enjoyed both of these.  I've liked Brett Cullen since Hired Heart and it's good to see him in something else.  He was way better in this one (Life on Liberty Street).  Audrey's Rain had me crying, but then it doesn't take much for me. lol",1253923200,4,247,4.212765957446808
2482269,4,B000E1OIB2,"My husband thought it was too much, but my daughters and I enjoyed these as gentle fun.  Nice to see some stuff coming out that doesn't stress you out.  Note, Audrey's Rain does have a scene you would not want young girls to see.  We enjoyed Life on Liberty Street more, anyway.  We laughed alot.",1214006400,17,296,4.327272727272727
2482270,2,B000E1OIB2,"Be aware that this movie should have had a PG-13 rating. I'm not sure why it remained unrated because it is very easy to come to a conclusion this movie is NOT appropriate for children. The chemistry between the actors is phenomenal and some of the dialogue is hilarious. The language is a problem; some of the topics discussed by the two women are definetely inappropriate; the conversation between Terry and Audrey at the picnic was most definetely not for children's ears, but the worst part was when the two of them are in the orchard and there is a bedroom scene. I don't know what kind of dialogue was exchanged because I fast-forwarded this scene. DON'T let your children watch this movie! It will NOT be a part of our movie collection.",1203984000,14,743,4.593984962406015

2482272,5,B000E1OIB2,"Audrey's Rain is a compelling story that doesn't shy away from the complex issues faced by modern families. There are a couple of scenes that will activate your tearducts whether you like it or not. Replete with wacky characters, challenging relationships, and cathartic moments, the Smith sisters have written a sweet story that deserves to be seen by many.",1144022400,11,358,5.084745762711864

8104313,5,B000E1OIB2,"The experiences of life for a middle aged woman raising a sisters two children after she committed suicide and and the care of a retarded sister that she has cared for since the death of her parents.  The humorous parts are good and it shows life.  Life is not always rosy and fine, but someone is there to come and help shoulder some of the problems.",1473897600,,351,4.303030303030303
