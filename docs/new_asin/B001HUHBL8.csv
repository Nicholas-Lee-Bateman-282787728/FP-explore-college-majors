8309680,5,B001HUHBL8,Great quality and my 2 year old loves it! Has English subtitles.,1483488000,,64,4.416666666666667
8309681,4,B001HUHBL8,"I agree with the first reviewer here-- GIVE US THE ENTIRE PROGRAM.  Stop with the ""selections.""  (This goes for 'old school' Sesame Street programs as well.  GIVE US THE ENTIRE SHOW.)  I don't like the snippets, I want the whole show.

This is the Israeli program-- it isn't geared for learning Hebrew, but for an audience already speaking Hebrew.  I don't find the Hebrew paced any faster than I hear it spoken by my Israeli friends and neighbors.  While I don't speak modern Hebrew, my son understands it all (I insist my friends speak to him in Hebrew, and his teachers speak it at his gan as well).  With the subtitles, I'm improving my Modern Hebrew while my son enjoys his Moishe.

I would like to see entire programs, not selections surrounding one or two characters.  But if this is all I can get, I'll take it.

The older Chanukah dvd is a program more geared towards learning Hebrew and mixes more US celebrities and Rehov Sumsum characters.  I don't know about the new one with Avigile.

This is definitely more of a Modern Hebrew tool.  If you're more interested in Judaic programming, check out Aleph, Bet, Blast Off!",1295395200,2,1130,4.613065326633166
8309682,3,B001HUHBL8,"I got this to give my four year old daughter some exposure to basic Hebrew vocab and develop her Hebrew alef-bet and counting skills, beyond Oy Babies 1 and 2.  Although she was rapt and begged to watch all 3 episodes, this product did not meet my expectations in two ways.  First, I only saw that the cover said ""3 episodes"" and was expecting close to 3 hours, not 60 minutes total.  Second, I expected some simple cartoons or shorts featuring just one letter/number/concept, like on English Sesame Street or on Shalom Sesame.  This was mostly the muppet/people skits or longer songs about things like brushing teeth, what to do when you're angry.  Also, maybe it was my poor Hebrew skills, but it seemed like the characters were speaking more quickly than English Sesame Street characters do.  The pacing seemed fast for something geared for children.  We'll see if my daughter stays interested in it and if it improves her comfort level with Hebrew, but right now I would recommend the new Shalom Sesame videos over Rehov Sumsum unless your child is very comfortable with Hebrew.",1295308800,,1082,4.78494623655914
