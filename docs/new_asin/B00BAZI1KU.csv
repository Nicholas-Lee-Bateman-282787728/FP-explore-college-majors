8565107,3,B00BAZI1KU,"Love Lucy Lawless, but unfortunately I didn't really like this one.  The music was off a bit.  There were a couple of great songs and the rest were just - I don't know how to put it - just 'eh.  Always a good thing to hear Lucy and always a good thing to see Lucy, but honestly, this was just a bit out there for me.

To be perfectly honest, I had more fun watching the rehearsals/Behind the scenes footage, than the actual concert.  Again, it wasn't bad necessarily, but it wasn't something I'll put in my DVD player very often either.

I love her voice, but the music was so loud and the show itself so distracting, it took away from her beautiful voice.  So again, for a dedicated Lucy fan, it's obviously a must have, but if you're looking to hear her voice and be blown away by that, search for something else.",1383955200,3,815,4.219354838709678
