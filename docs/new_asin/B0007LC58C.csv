slide, just for entertainment, this is it.
If you want to learn the slide, look somewhere
else.",1243728000,2,143,4.142857142857143
2217629,5,B0007LC58C,"Great DVD for someone needing more challenge playing
slide guitar. Roy Rogers is ""The Master of Slide""
This DVD will give even talented players some thing to work on.
Would highly recommend.",1225670400,3,190,4.96875
2217630,5,B0007LC58C,"I learned and am learning so much from this DVD, it's got live footage of him and his band and then he breaks it down for ya', I am an intermediate slide player and an advanced fingerstyle blues player, I recommend this to everyone, it's so basic, yet so advanced, it'll totally open up the world of slide for you and explain sooooo much!",1168905600,5,338,4.296875
2217631,5,B0007LC58C,"Don't mess with the rest!

RR shows and tells you what to do, and within 30 minutes or so you too can play slide guitar! Okay, not like Roy but satisfying enough that you keep plugging through the harder stuff. And Roy helps you with that too. The format is very helpful. The camera and Roy let you see what is happening with both hands. And of course DVDs are great because you can keep slowing things down and going back. I recommend this to any guitar player who ever said, I sure would like to try slide guitar.",1160611200,11,515,4.202020202020202
8048187,5,B0007LC58C,"Roy is a good teacher.  Some people are teachers, some are not.  Like Bob Margolin.  No offense Bob.
Roy will get you going quickly.",1482278400,,132,4.416666666666667
8048188,5,B0007LC58C,"Really good, clear, selection of great songs well played and skillfully taught. Roy is a good teacher. I have a ton of instructional dvd's and I'm getting a lot out of this one. Not too tough for a beginner, but plenty of stuff for a good picker to play with. I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.",1422230400,,292,4.140350877192983

8048190,4,B0007LC58C,"Roy Rogers is a master of the slide guitar.  This is sort of an instructional video, but it's also appealing just to watch Rogers play.  Some of the songs he picks were surprising, but whatever he chooses, he does well.",1411084800,,219,4.45
8048191,5,B0007LC58C,I love this guy.  He has to be one of the best slide players I know of.  I love the layout of this dvd.  If you are a more experienced slide player just skip the basics and go right to the tunes.  He plays the tunes live with his band and then breaks down the parts to show you how he plays it. Very Kool.,1402185600,,305,3.646153846153846
8048192,5,B0007LC58C,"I found this DVD enlightening, well produced and well presented by Roy.
He is an excellent teacher and imparts his insights and thoughts well.
The music tracks where he plays with his band are excellent.
I thouroughly recommend this DVD to anyone who has the basic knowledge of chords and wants to learn to play slide guitar.",1347321600,,325,4.719298245614035
8048193,5,B0007LC58C,If you  are thinking about learning this playing method...which is not as easy as it might appear...you may as well learn from one of the best in the business! Hope he is feeling well after his recent situation. I love the video. Now if I could just do it! Thanks Roy!!,1281225600,,269,4.2745098039215685
8048194,2,B0007LC58C,The main problem with this DVD is that it doesn't properly play on a PC. I had to contact the manufacturer and they had me download a viewer that works on a PC and also download the entire DVD in a different format.,1277683200,,215,4.023255813953488
8048195,3,B0007LC58C,"Roy can certainly play, he is 8 times grammy nominated. However, this particular DVD is from 1992, and that shows...it looks more like a video tape than a DVD, in terms of picture quality. I'm going to see him soon in Sacramento and that will be fun, I'm sure. However...

The instructional design of this DVD isn't great - its more like Roy sat down to be taped and just talked through a few things then played some song parts and licks. Mostly, this is a collection of licks to songs, in Roy's style. The ""conceptual"" material is quite abbreviated. It basically includes brief reference to types of slides, open E tuning, muting with palm edge, and I think that was about it. Too often, the comments were like...I use either a glass slide or a metal slide but you can use whatever you want. Also more than one instance of...oh yes and I wanted to mention this...as if there were no script and no plan for this - which I find too easy to believe.

If you are looking for slide instruction that will help you understand what you need in a guitar for slide, different types of slides, different open tunings and which ones to start with, and learning the basics of slide, I would recommend instead looking at Mel Bay's ""Getting into Slide Guitar"", which is a book with a CD. It will serve you much better than this DVD.

But if you just want to watch some slide and hear a little perspective, this is OK. At the $26 price point, I think this is priced about double what it should be. It seems like it was put together as a small independent project by a company with no instructional design resources, just a camera and Roy. It shows.",1270166400,6,1633,4.382838283828383
8048196,5,B0007LC58C,"Mr. Rogers is an amazingly talented player, and he fully explains his technique. The production values are excellent; good shots of fretboard and fingering, and actually, the video is also a fine 'music video' as well, very enjoyable as entertainment as well as for instruction!",1250380800,,278,5.2
