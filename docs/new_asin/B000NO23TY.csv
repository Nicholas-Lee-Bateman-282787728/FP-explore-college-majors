8179572,4,B000NO23TY,"First movie - Three women give full frontals and many more women are topless and completely nude from the back side. A couple other women try to give a full frontal, but the camera view doesn't allow it. 4 stars......  2nd movie - Lots of topless only and completely nude from the back side. Absolutely no hint of a full frontal. Mostly just standing or sitting around like their modeling for the camera. 2 1/2 - 3 stars.",1517270400,,421,4.397435897435898

8179576,3,B000NO23TY,"This review is for ""My Tale Is Hot"" only:

I wasn't really sure what to expect from this outing, because you never know what you are going to get when you watch one of these skin-flicks from the 60's, as the quality of them tends to run all over the place. But ""My Tale Is Hot"" is, if not a solid effort, at least stays on the right side of entertaining.

There's really not much to this film, as it's basically a string of burlesque-type shots of fairly attractive babes, which has a bookended plot about a super-faithful husband (played by Jack Little, under the name ""Little Jack Little"") being tempted by the devil (played by Max Gardens, under the name ""Manny Goodtimes"") to stray. That's about it.

Deeply involving this is not, but it is a good bit of fun and never really takes itself very seriously. As noted, the women are remarkably pretty attractive for the most part and have little problem peeling for the camera, while Little and Gardens provide somewhat humorous double entendre commentary during it. There's even a clever ""little twist"" (no pun intended) in the end, when the devil learns just why he can't tempt this most faithful husband to cheat. The dialogue is totally cornball throughout, with puns-a-plenty, some of it funny and some of it cringe-worthy.

Really, though, the film is pretty much centered on the buxom figures of the ladies, which is only to be expected. There is a nice go-go dancing scene about midway through, featuring the talents of Ms. Candy Barr which is very nice. At just under an hour long, the film doesn't tend to overstay it's welcome, even if a couple of the burlesque scenes do seem to.

In the end, it's just a fun and campy nudie-cutie romp, which is pretty indicative of this brand of film. It is certainly far from the worst effort this kind of film-making has created. If you are a fan of the genre, you might get a few chuckles of mileage out of this one.",1375574400,4,1916,4.542028985507247
8179577,3,B000NO23TY,I bought these because I like looking at film with nice looking women in them and I really like looking at  Dixie Donovan  nude she was in the joys of jezebel and it did have some nude scenes of her but for the money if you really want to see some very sexy nude scenes of her the buy tobacco roody instead of this film you really want be disappoint. not only does it have her in it but a couple of other women that look good in the buff also. lots of nudity in that film.,1341100800,,472,3.8556701030927836
8179578,4,B000NO23TY,The Joy Of Jezabel is a nudie comic farce and is a cut above most of these sexplotaion movies. It is worth the money to see it. I got a kick out of satan and the biblical characters.,1284163200,5,182,3.8157894736842106
8179579,4,B000NO23TY,"This Something Weird double feature contains a couple of 'Lucifer' themed flicks designed for the grindhouse/drive-in theater of yesteryear. The first flick is called The Joys of Jezebel(1970/75mins) and features Lucifer, Hell, Jezebel, and a bunch of naked chicks frolicking around the land 'down-under' involving themselves in orgies and getting whipped. The second flick is called My Tale is Hot(1964/58mins) and the story is about a silly looking Devil trying to tempt a 'smurf-like' man with a bunch of naked chicks.

This wacky Nudie Cutie features a cameo from the legendary Candy Barr. Ms Barr also makes an appearance in on of the bonus shorts called Boudir Belles(2 1/2mins). The other two bonus shorts include a weird cartoon called Satan in Church(8mins) and an all black cast from the 40's called Go Down, Death!(53mins). There are a handful of Satan/Hell themed trailers(Touch of Satan, The Naked Witch, Olga's Dance Hall Girls, Soul Lover, The Devil's Garden,Up in Smoke).

There's also a 7 1/2 minute Gallery of Exploitation Art with Greatest Hits Soundtrack from filmaker David Friedman. Both main features are nonsensical and irrelevant storywise, but contain a great deal of nudity and softcore bumping. Go Down, Death! is surprisingly good. The SWV trailers are - as usual - weird, kooky, and fun to watch. Once again the folks at Something Weird Video dishes up another demented plate of twisted and sizzling fun.",1255824000,13,1434,5.176724137931035
8179580,3,B000NO23TY,"For a cult classic, these films are pretty good.  I wish there to be more sex and nudity and the plots are very funny and raw.  I am a collector of ""Something Weird"" videos.",1251158400,4,173,4.0588235294117645
8179581,4,B000NO23TY,"Both are Satan themed and actually, the makeup is pretty good for the red faced dude - though as scary as a bucket of red hots. The first JOYS OF JEZEBEL is essentially an hour long orgy at Satan's lair and where ever - the woman are all gorgeous and the camera spends long lingering sweeps up & down their bodies - the women are either all nude or in nighties ... MY TALE IS HOT is a relatively poor print but the women spend lots of time nude under bright, bright studio lights so that makes up for a poorer than usual print. Again, the women are all classy and gorgeous and basically Satan has commanded them to frolick in a studio blow up pool ... yea, there's a plot but do you really care? The extras are nice - one is a burlesque strip (short in b&w but again, gorgeous girl) plus an oddity, a short all-black cast with no nudity ... then the usual great and fun trailers ... another excellent 2-fer from SW - a keeper!",1207180800,22,926,4.15
