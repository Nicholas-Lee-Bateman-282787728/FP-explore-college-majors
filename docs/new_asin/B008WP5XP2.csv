8531554,5,B008WP5XP2,"This documentary is one that I wish all grandparents and the adult parents of the grandchildren would view.
It is so heartbreaking to listen to the grands in the support group who have been denied access to their precious grandchildren. I think some people would be surprised to know how many people have been alienated from their grandchildren and they often don't even know why. This is a great introduction for a support group or for people who are alienated to know that they are not alone.  I think support is key and that's what is getting me through this tumultuous time. Thinking of starting a support group because of Susan.  Great job Susan. I wish I lived closer to your support group. I have viewed this video 4 times and get something out of it every time. You won't be disappointed. Share it with your friends. You may be surprised that they need help as well

The most desperate pleas I have ever been privy to are those from grandparents who have been denied visitation with their grandchildren. It's painful to me to have so little hope to offer them. The documentary film, A Precious Bond, does offer some positive news for estranged grandparents, although the good stories are balanced with the less hopeful ones that I hear most often.
Background and Facts

A Precious Bond was created by Advocates for Grandparent Grandchild Connection (AFGGC), the non-profit group headed by Susan Hoffman, who successfully lobbied for changes in California's grandparent visitation laws. Hoffman started a grandparent support group in Corona del Mar, California. Most of the stories feature grandparents from that group.

Hoffman's earlier efforts on behalf of grandparents who have been denied visitation include two books. 20008's Grand Wishes is primarily an account of how Hoffman changed the law in California. A Precious Bond is a 2011 publication that gives grandparents extensive and detailed advice about avoiding estrangement and what to do if it happens anyway.

The film A Precious Bond is 39 minutes long. It is available for a donation of $13.99. It's well worth the price for anyone interested in grandparenting issues, as well as being a must-have for those grandparents who are being denied visitation.

Telling Their Stories

The film begins with scenes of grandparents and grandchildren doing things together. The musical background is ""You Are My Sunshine,"" sung by children. These scenes are followed by a series of children saying why they love their grandparents and recounting all the things they do with them. It's a fitting opening for the poignant scenes to come, when estranged grandparents tell their stories.

The stories told by the grandparents have a common theme of pain, but they recount different outcomes, letting estranged grandparents know that there is more than one way for their story to end. One couple tells of giving up litigation because it became too painful but reconnecting with grandchildren through court-ordered family therapy. Another grandmother, who refers to learning ""how to write letters and eat crow,"" finally received a response to one of her letters and has reconnected with her son's family. Another grandmother tells of having minimal visitation and being frustrated by her daughter's refusal to expand her access. Then, of course, there are the grandparents whose efforts have been unsuccessful but who vow to keep trying.

Experts Weigh In

A third section of the film contains footage from a conference held in 2011. Speakers include psychotherapist Dr. Lillian Carson, who has written extensively about grandparenting. Dr. Carson discusses the importance of children having ""a loving adult in their lives who believes in them."" A grandparent, she suggests, can be that adult and can take on the role of bolstering a child's self-esteem, which she compares to a bucket that constantly needs refilling. Attorney Sheryl Edgar discusses the role of litigation but begins by saying, ""The less court time you all do, the better off you all are."" She discusses the concept of ""parental authority"" and says that she would not take a case to court unless grandparents have tried lots of alternatives, because grandparents who sue to see their grandchildren when it's not necessary are ""blowing their college fund.""
The Take-Away

Advice for estranged grandparents boils down to a few key bits:

Find or create a support group.
""Do the work"" of trying to reconcile with family members.
Don't stop sending grandchildren cards, letters, gifts.
Try litigation only when other measures have failed.
Don't give up hope.
It's also worth watching the film for this clear and cogent explanation of why grandparents' rights are important, from Carol Menck, a member of Hoffman's support group: ""But at some point in time, somebody's got to get it that a child's feelings matter. It isn't about me wanting to see my granddaughter. It's about our granddaughter, who thought we stopped loving her, who thought we forgot all about her.""

Adds Menck, ""Relationships are not disposable.""",1349654400,2,4192,5.2604790419161676

The story is easy to watch, well done and beautifully told. A great story and a must see about a situation that needs to be told.",1349222400,2,309,4.081967213114754
8531559,5,B008WP5XP2,"I recently purchased the book and film by Susan Hoffman ""A Precious Bond"" as well as, her book titled ""Grand Wishes"" and I highly recommend the film and her books. As a Grandparent myself I have been fighting through the legal system for the priviledge of having this special relationship with my own grandchildren continue despite the divorced parents ongoing drama to alienate and brain wash the children against me while trying to destroy this very special loving bond. As Grandparents we should all stand united to preserve and protect this very special and loving bond of Grandparent/Grandchild.

Please buy Susan Hoffman's film and books and start your own support group and become an advocate for Grandparent Rights in your community. Togther we can make a difference in our Grandchildren's lives by making our voices heard. protecting the loving G.P. relationship and hopefully, change the State Laws in which we live as Susan Hoffman has done in California. One state at a time!

Susan Hoffman brings to the screen a little known but rapidly growing problem in families throughout our country. Without blame or harshness she has gently interviewed a number of grandparents dealing with this at times ""secret"" problem.

I found myself a grandparent dismissed and my grandchildren having no voice and no choice in this, a sense of not being alone and not feeling as though I am the only one in this nightmare.

I would highly reccomend this beautiful documentary to any and all faced with this situation, or they that have a freind or family member faced with this tragic ever growing social problem that needs immediate attention.",1345507200,2,928,5.299319727891157
