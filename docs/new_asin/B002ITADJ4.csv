8371134,4,B002ITADJ4,"When Gus Lawton pushes his wife too far, one day; He finds himself chasing her to her childhood home in the country. Faced with losing her or living by her plan, he gets busy fixing up the old place, starting with the septic tank. Thing is, Gus digs up a zombie. A zombie that will do anything he says. But, having a zombie has its' problems and that's when things heat up.

I'll admit, this one took me by surprise. Straight from the get-go, I was laughing hysterically. Have to hand it to Director David Kemker(who also plays Gus), he wrote a witty yet hysterically funny zombie movie that's loads better than Fido could ever be. I think it's really sad that movies such as this get panned over for the more elaborate bigger budget movies out there with well known stars and so on..but that's the nature of the beast, I guess.

Still, I highly recommend this one to everyone. Zombie fans might pass on it but, I guarantee, if you're a fan of dark humor and love movies like Fido, Zombieland or Evil Dead---you're going to dig this one.

Absolutely LOVED it!!! <Thumbs up>",1343779200,,1073,4.464285714285714
8371135,5,B002ITADJ4,"The movie opens with unemployed Gus sitting in a bar admiring his wife's best friend's butt (Wendy Jewell also producer of film) when she invites him back to her place. As things turn out Gus (David Kemker) doesn't cheat on his wife Deborah (TV actress Shauna Black) but it causes problems. They end up moving out into the country in her old family home. She now rules the roost. Gus stays at home and makes repairs, while she works for her former lover Donny Schulthesis (iron man John Jarvis).

While digging up the septic tank in the back yard, Gus uncovers Quinto, a zombie (David Sparrow) who he converts into his personal workman to his wife's dismay.

The conversation between the couple is comical. It is witty and well written. I was laughing at loud at their break up. Later when they are in bed together because she heard a mouse noise in the house:

Deborah: ""Don't parlay this into early forgiveness. That would be the worst thing that could happen.""

Gus:""Forgiveness is the worse thing that can happen?""

Deborah (turning over and facing away from Gus): ""Don't twist my words.""

Having a zombie in your backyard poses problems and things escalate.

The movie also includes some politically incorrect humor. At times I just couldn't stop laughing. A great movie that is a work of genius and under the radar. Kudos to David Kemker who wrote, directed and starred in this film. Good acting. If you liked ""Fido"" you'll want to see ""Zombie Dearest"".

8371136,3,B002ITADJ4,"I won't plot spoil - just be careful what you wish for. This is not a FIDO type of humor, and not a SOTD either - but it is a dark humor that has cute and funny moments....apart, from any zombie based humor. In fact, the zombie is background filler and pretty tame till the end, and even then he's far from ANY form of a Romero Zombie. This is a film that if you take it striclty on it's own, was a very nicely done one and well acted - and the female lead is the one that gives you all the laffs.  Before you buy, I would rent as for most zombie fans it is pretty tame but the story is good. I only gave it 3 stars as it's more of a social tale that a horror movie, and the cover art on the boz had zip to do, with anything in the film.",1271030400,3,737,3.694267515923567
8371137,5,B002ITADJ4,"I thought this movie was a scream.  Not your typical blood and gore zombie movie, which is what made me really like it.  Just when you think there's no way out, the unexpected happens!  You don't have to be a zombie cult follower to get a rise out of this one.  I've seen other really great reviews too.
