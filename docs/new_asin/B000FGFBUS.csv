2564540,4,B000FGFBUS,"I was looking for another work by Lynda Day George whether it was film or a TV movie and I came across with a 1977 TV movie entitled Ants.

It was a film in the tradition of Jaws. This thriller is about a group of guest at a tiny resort that becomes prey to a group of ants - the type that could kill considering their chemically poisonous bites that it is capable of and their appetite for human flesh.

While this film is far from realistic and with over-the-top performances from the cast that includes Lynda Day George together with Suzanne Sommers,Robert Foxworth,Brian Dennehy, Bernie Casey and Barry Van Dyke,it became enjoyable in the sense that it became unintentionally funny and comedic that made it enjoyable and entertaining. This campy classic is definitely worthwhile especially when one is looking back in the 70's that is similar to its genre.",1440633600,3,860,4.726666666666667

2564546,3,B000FGFBUS,"Released to TV in 1977 as a knock-off of the theatrical ""Empire of the Ants,"" which came out several months earlier, ""Ants"" is (obviously) a 'when-animals-attack' film featuring the little critters in full attack mode. Although the insects were huge in the theatrical movie, here they're normal-sized but with a toxic bite due to chemicals in the ground or whatever.

Robert Foxworth, a favorite of mine, plays the protagonist with his sidekick Bernie Casey, another favorite. Lynda Day George plays the girlfriend at the old hotel where the ants are uprising and Myrna Loy her crippled mother. Barry Van Dyke plays a stud working at the pool and cutie Karen Lamm his girlfriend, Linda. Suzanne Somers is also on hand as the associate of a businessman interested in buying the hotel.

I've heard some criticize the movie as high camp when it's not campy at all. It's a straight forward creatures-on-the-loose flick with the requisite drama. There's nothing artificial or goofy about the acting or story, which defines camp. This is not to say, however, that there aren't giggle-worthy parts, like when the boy falls into the dumpster.

There's nothing extraordinary about ""Ants,"" but it's certainly decent enough to give an okay grade. Although Somers isn't fat by any means, she's not in good shape like she was early-on in ""Three's Company"" and over a dozen years later as a hot fitness guru. This can be observed in a couple of scenes where she's wearing a one-piece bathing suit. Karen Lamm works better as the requisite babe. As for Day George, she's dressed to the hilt with loose clothing the entire film.

The film runs 95 minutes and was shot at Qualicum Beach, Vancouver Island British Columbia.

2564547,5,B000FGFBUS,"I love its terribleness, if that is a defensible position.  NOTE: the construction worker who is seen for a few seconds escaping by running down a steep mountain, happens to be Sonny Shields, the real life father of Randy Shields who was a young boxer in the '70's who eventually got to the Number 3 welterweight spot in the world.  I know this because I used to know both of them, having gone regularly to Goodman's Gym in Van Nuys, California during the 1970's.  Sonny's punches would literally rock the heavy bag and send it swinging, whereas when I hit it, it barely moved a half an inch.  Randy's punches were just as hard, but he was a nice kid and I don't think his heart was really in it.",1418256000,,696,4.3307692307692305

2564551,2,B000FGFBUS,"Remember seeing this on TV many years ago.  The only thing that really interested me was the location for the filming of this silly movie.  It was filmed in a small village on Vancouver Island, British Columbia.  The majority of the movie is filmed at the old Qualicum College Inn.  Once an all boys school.  Qualicum Beach is a beautiful vacation spot on the east side of the island.  It's one of my favorite places as I have many lovely wonderful memories when visiting my mum and dad and taking my four boys to the lovely sandy beaches.",1375401600,,539,4.448979591836735
2564552,3,B000FGFBUS,The story outline was unrealistic at times but kept me on my seat. You were kept wondering what was going to happen next. The actors were okay although not exciting. I would watch this movie again.,1373155200,,197,4.5
2564553,5,B000FGFBUS,"I haven't seen this film in decades, so finding it available on DVD was quite the coup.  It was exactly as I fondly remembered.  Given its age, it's quaint by today's standards.  Even though special effects were making vast improvements at the time (1977), they certainly weren't employed in this film.  Having seen ants swarm up the side of a building, their painted on effect was quite funny.  Only in extreme close-ups did they manage to achieve the right creepy-crawly consequence (I was scratching for hours after watching this film)!  I felt sorry for the poor actors who had to let the ants crawl on them.  They couldn't have paid me enough to do that.
Naturally, these weren't supposed to be just any old ants, these buggers were fortified through years of insecticidal abuse.  Several bites proved fatal to a few characters who conveniently died off-screen or by slumping tastefully to the ground.  Not the stuff of horror, more annoyance than anything.
This film is known by several titles: It Happened at Lakewood Manor, Panic at Lakewood Manor, or the pithy version ANTS.  I prefer the latter because it immediately gets to the point.  Besides the ants, another villain is present, Gerald Gordon as real estate magnate Anthony Fleming.  He wants to buy the Lakewood Hotel resort then tear it down and build a casino.  And not to be forgotten, there's the dope (Robert Foxworth), who unwittingly turns the ants into a rampaging horde of displaced residents in search of a new home.  What an idiot.
This film is most notable though, for wasting the considerable talents of Myrna Loy (the owner of Lakewood Hotel), in one of her last film roles.  How ignominious.",1369526400,3,1672,4.838028169014085

2564556,4,B000FGFBUS,"The 70's got a lot of mileage out of eco-disaster stories.  Like the 50's and it's fears of the cold war and alien invasion that led to a wide variety of films about our destruction at the hands of forces beyond our control, the 70's gave us films about our destruction at our own foolish and selfdestructive hands.  Ants is a neat movie set at a little hotel that is on the verge of being swept away by big business.  The Ants of the title are an unusually large colony mutated by toxins in the atmosphere and in the ground.  Instead of being killed off by the poisons they have adapted to using them.  They are also disturbed by the beginning of construction that damages their colony causing them to be more aggressive and to expand their range.  The story is solid and the acting is also a wonderful thing supported by a cast of well known actors and actresses.  The cast includes Murna Loy, Robert Foxworth,  Suzanne Somers, and Barry Van Dyke.
For the quality the production company got, they didn't spend very much money.  They got lucky and so did the people who watch this movie.  It is one of the best of the 70's eco-disaster movies.",1361318400,8,1144,4.430622009569378

2564558,5,B000FGFBUS,I saw this movie when it first aired on TV many years ago but I enjoyed it very much. I thought it was an interesting idea of how ants could adapt to the many different poisons we've used on them over the years. I wonder what we would do if they could use them against us?,1342137600,2,272,3.875
2564559,4,B000FGFBUS,"What can I say, you don't buy this movie because of Oscar performances. However, it will keep you entertain. The real stars of the movie are Robert Foxworth, Chase on ""Falcon Crest,"" and Lynda Day George. Legendary Myrna Loy is in the movie and looks very much like her younger self. She aged well. We can talk about the movie but the real reason that we buy this movie is because we want to see sexy Suzanne Somers naked, by at least tv standards, covered with ants. Suzanne rivals Janet Leigh in ""Psycho"" as the beautiful blonde, whose life is cut short in the first half. This will be a classic. Buy and enjoy. Also, Suzanne, if you read this, please take a break from health books and selling your customized items as a product line. We miss you as an actress. Please, at least part time, do some more t.v. movies, movies or specials. You are still sexy. Mah",1304726400,7,862,4.39375
2564560,3,B000FGFBUS,"ANTS is one of those sillier-than-usual made-for-TV movies that I watched as a kid. I just watched it again this afternoon and enjoyed most of it, cheeze and all. Robert Foxworth (Prophecy) is a construction worker trying to figure out what has injured and killed members of his crew. Myrna Loy (!) and Lynda Day George (Pieces) are the mother / daughter owners of the hotel under siege by the angry little insects of the title. A pre-thighmaster Suzanne Somers is definitely a hottie, and proves that she can have ants in her pants just like anyone else! As ant-attack movies go, ANTS isn't totally awful. While it's not as good as THEM or PHASE IV, it is nowhere near as bad as EMPIRE OF THE ANTS (although Joan Collins is a riot)! So, prepare yourself for some sporadic crawly fun between dull stretches of tedium...",1240099200,2,819,4.616438356164384
2564561,2,B000FGFBUS,"It Happened at Lakewood Manor (Robert Scheerer, 1977)

Picture it. Pittsburgh, 1977. I was over at a friend's house doing something or another. As I was walking out the door to go home, his parents were watching TV. I saw just a scene. It traumatized me. We're talking nightmares for weeks. I had no idea what it was. Fast-forward twenty years later, to the glory of the Internet and its many film geeks. I describe the scene on a forum, and presto-- someone comes up with the name of this movie. I worship. Fast-forward another eleven years, to last night-- yes, it took me that long to get my hands on a copy-- when I watched it. I was once again traumatized, but for very, very different reasons.

Ecohorror schlockmeister Guerdon Trueblood (Candy Snatchers) wrote the screenplay for this Robert Scheerer (The World's Greatest Athlete)-directed dog about mutant ants menacing a resort. Ethel Adams (Myrna Loy) has been running it for decades, with a helping hand from daughter Valerie (Lynda Day George) since infirmity forced her into a wheelchair. A shady developer (Bernie Casey) and his gorgeous assistant (Suzanne Somers, who gets top billing despite having relatively little screen time) want to buy the resort so said developer can put up a big, glitzy lakeside casino. Meanwhile, a nearby construction project (whose overseer, Mike [Robert Foxworth], is having an affair with Valerie) has disturbed, yes, a vast nest of mutant ants. And boy, are those ants mad. When the Department of Health gets involved, things get all kinds of fun.

Oh, Guerdon Trueblood, how I love thee. How long did it take you to bang this script out, an hour? Less? It's quite nicely summed up by one of the characters, inserted into the movie just so the ants will have another target, who says breathlessly to her new boyfriend, ""and to think, this morning I didn't even know you."" (Later that morning, however, they knew one another very, very well. Ah, the swingin' seventies.) the characters are far too thin to be cardboard. Onionskin, perhaps. The plot is about as solid as an acid-eaten piece of PVC pipe. The music (the only score to which Ken Richmond's name was ever attached, at least according to IMDB) comes straight out of the adult film industry. Can say one good thing about it: the ant special effects are about a thousand times better than those of more recent killer-ant CGI-fests on the Sci-Fi Channel. (I assume that real ants were used for most of the shots; amusingly, whatever they used to get the ants where they wanted them was painted in swirls, and so you see meandering rivers of ants wandering down, say, a hotel corridor. I kept wondering why everyone was so scared of a six-inch-wide trail of ants working its way down a six-foot-wide hallway. Why not just step around them?)

This is, truly, an awful movie in every respect, but I have to admit-- the kid-in-the-dumpster scene that gave me such nightmares when I was nine years old? Yeah. That still creeped me right the [censored for Amazon consumption] out. **",1209427200,7,3033,4.7934990439770555
2564562,5,B000FGFBUS,this is an older movie but one that is worth watching if you like this type of show its fun to see the difference between the stars then and now,1206662400,2,144,3.8333333333333335
2564563,4,B000FGFBUS,"It is said in the scientific circles that if, for whatever reason, the insect species were to rise and attack us, we would have no hope of survival. Food for thought. Well in this well crafted thriller with an angle of Science Fiction, the day they speak of has come.
Our story opens at an aged, somewhat uncool and border line out of date Motel/Inn were a nearby construction site has disturbed a small patch of ground that is home to an enormous soldier ant nest. This particularly poisonous species lashes out with stealth, attacking through a broken sewer pipe and against a small boy in a dumpster. But with the attack of a broad shouldered construction worker who is literaly brought to his knees, things start to get serious.
Sometimes know as...""It happened at Lakewood Manour"" This nature against man movie is one of the best, with good characters, a good build up in suspence. And an ending for the hero's of our story that will have anyone's skin crawling......Please enjoy.",1200096000,11,985,4.732558139534884

8122104,2,B000FGFBUS,"Ants! 1977 film

A bulldozer destroys a shed. There is a cry for help! One construction worker is buried! A rich man talks about his plans for a gambling casino. But a nest of ants was uncovered. Where is that missing man? They try to dig him out. The death is mysterious. It is investigated as a possible case of criminal negligence by an official. A young boy is attacked by ants in a dumpster. The construction crew talks about filling the hole. What if this thing can attack others? The ants bite one worker, his leg is numb. [Why doesnt that cook notice the ants on the kitchen floor?] He is bitten and collapses! Outside a worker collects ants in a bottle. The health official blames a virus instead, then handles some ants. A worker used a front-loader to destroy that excavation. Could those ants have absorbed toxins from poisons? Ethel Adams calls that developer for a meeting.

Ants climb the wall of the building! They enter the bedroom where that young woman lies in bed. Ants attack a man, he collapses. That worker calls for help against the ants. How can they get a woman in a wheelchair out of the building? Can kerosene and a fire destroy the ants? There is a dramatic scene where a woman is trapped at the end of a long ladder.! Would burning down the hotel be a solution? The people are attacked, can a fire hose flush them off? Can others help? If you don't move the ants won't bite you says the health official. The people stand still. Men arrive to fumigate the room. Once the nest is scattered the ants lose their force. The woman says she will go to Florida. [Dont they have a greater insect population?]

This follows the typical horror story. A threat to the people is answered by a collective action that removes the threat in the end. Is this story believable to you? It could have been better. This was also named Panic at Lakewood Manor. Who believes a gambling casino in a rural area would be a success?",1517702400,,1935,4.445070422535212
