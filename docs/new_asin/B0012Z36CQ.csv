The episodes are great, and the audio commentary is insightful and worth listening to.  You should already have this if you call yourself an Avatar fan.",1214611200,,322,4.5
3100358,5,B0012Z36CQ,"My entire family has been watching 2-3 episodes of Avatar everynight.  It is great family fun for the summer, and as much as we all enjoy talking about the story, the character development and the choices they make take center stage.  How to choose between good and evil, between your own interest and helping your friends (or strangers for that matter), between your feelings and your values:  This is what sets Avatar apart from ordinary conventional cartoons.  The end of ""The Boiling Rock, Pt. 2"" just blew us away.

That said, we are all screaming in agony over having to wait until the end of July to see how things turn out.  In the meanwhile, we're going back to Book One and watch from the very beginning.",1214179200,,714,4.582677165354331

3100375,4,B0012Z36CQ,"It has been a shamefully long time since new episodes of Avatar have been aired on American television.  So long in fact, that this DVD contains unaired episodes.  Unfortunately for me, instead of rationing the episodes out, I greedily watched all in one night.  These episodes, while not always the strongest in dialogue, are strong in story and will change the series significantly in the future.  I cannot wait to see what happens next!

However I would prefer that the network air them so I can have the prolonged enjoyment of week to week because being the Avatar addict that I am, if I end up buying new episodes before they air, I am going to watch them all in one night.

3100378,5,B0012Z36CQ,"I have to say, I'm a little disappointed with the creators of the show and Nickelodeon for not showing Western Air temple through Boiling Rock Part 2 yet. However, I learned what the plots for each of these episodes.

Western Air Temple: Zuko attempts to convince Aang to allow him to be his teacher.

Firebending Masters: When Zuko's firebending is gone, he and Aang go to the source.

Boiling Rock Parts 1,2: Team Avatar plans to raid the Fire Nation prison and help Suki and the other warriors escape.

This season really did get better very drastically aftr dismal episodes like The Beach and Nightmares ad Daydreams. Be prepared for Vol. 4 July 29. Hopefully the rest of the episodes will be shown by then.",1210032000,,711,4.664
3100379,5,B0012Z36CQ,"Avatar is exceptionally written, perhaps the best animated series ever to air in America.  It's so good that acclaimed Director, M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN,(The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs, The Village, The Happening) called it, ""The coolest mythology I've ever seen,"" and put his own screenwriting on hold to spend the next six years producing/directing a BIG-SCREEN LIVE-ACTION TRILOGY of this story.

Adults may find the occasional comic relief a bit cheesy, but will love the character development, psychological depth, mythos, realistic martial arts, ""special effects"", and the excellent insights into Asian philosophy, sociology, and mythology, and even politics. I've been studying Asian culture and philosophy and teaching in Asia for years and I've gained insights from this series because the writers have found ways to introduce and explain Asian thought so simply that even kids can ""get it"". Ideas like chakras, Daoism, and Chinese philosophy of the balance and properties of the natural Elements are brought to life and illustrated in the characters lives, situations, and cultural settings.  I bought this to watch my nephews (though I often watch it when they're not here too) and I think it's awesome because as they grow up in an increasingly Asian world, I think what they were exposed to in this show will make Asian culture (Chinese, Tibetan, Japanese, Indian, Korean)  much more accessible and comprehensible to them than it was to me when I studied it.

Don't the the animation fool you, this series is a myth of exceptional crafting, on par with STAR WARS and LORD OF THE RINGS.

Zuko finally comes around and joins the Avatar Team.  Aang, Kitara, Sokka, Toph, are also joined by Haru, and couple of other characters from previous episodes.  One great benefit to Zuko joining the team, the episode doesn't cut between two separate story lines.

Zuko's first problem is convincing Aang and company that he really has changed and wants to help the Avatar bring balance back to the world.

Aang accepts Zuko as his firebending teacher, only one problem, Zuko has lost his firebending power.  He needs to find a new source, other than rage and anger, to fuel his power.  Aang and Zuko go on a quest together to find the true source of Firebending power.  (We also learn how Toph learned to be such a powerful Earthbender.)

The last two episodes on this DVD involve Zuko and Sokka.  They have some dialog together talking about their ex girlfriends.  Sokka is on a quest to rescue his Dad, a Waterbender, from a Fire Nation prison.

And, we finally find out what happened to Suki.  The last we saw of her was on Appa's lost day.

The voice of Zuko, is played by Dante Brasco.

I recognized the voice of Sokka as the brother on Hannah Montanna.  I can't remember his name, sorry.

The voice of Avatar Aang is Zack Eisen.  I recognized his voice from the Antz movie.

The artwork in this anime is stunning.  It's on par with movies like 'Spirited Away'.

I'm 44, a little out of the demographic, but I positively find myself enraptured by this series and am looking forward to the next Volume.",1215475200,,1756,4.593548387096774
