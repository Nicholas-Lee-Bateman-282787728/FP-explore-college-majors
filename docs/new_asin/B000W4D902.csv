8221168,3,B000W4D902,"Let me start by saying that I LOVE the music and fun lyrics!  The CD is fabulous, different, and fun for both grownups and kids.  However, I was disappointed in the DVD.  The animation is sadly lacking - - it's more like each song is accompanied by a series of illustrations that occasionally move.  While the illustrations are fun and lovely, they failed to capture my 2 y/o's (or my) attention.  So, if you're buying for the music, it's a fantastic purchase, but if you're looking for a fun DVD for kids, I'd look elsewhere.",1207267200,,526,4.494736842105263
8221169,5,B000W4D902,"I bought this after searching for better music for my nearly 2-year old son.  We have been listening to the usual Wheels on the Bus, some Rockasaurus Rex (which rawks), and They Might Be Giants.  I was looking for something lyrical that I could also get into and this is really good stuff.  He is too young to sing the words but loves it when I sing along to the videos.  He is really glued to the TV during the videos but participates.  It amazes me because the subject-matter and style seem very mature but it totally speaks to my son; he gets it.  The whole thing is very well done, the package is beautiful and the drawings and animation are amazing.  I am definitely going to get have to get the other DVD as well.",1203379200,2,719,4.242647058823529
8221170,5,B000W4D902,"The Gustafer Yellowgold project is unique not only for its thoughtful content, which deftly integrates important life lessons with fun stuff, but also because it can be enjoyed by both children and their parents for the same reasons -- a sort of Shel Silverstein-meets-Yellow Submarine.

We love Sendak.  We love Suess.  And now we love Gustafer. This is not frenetic, animated crap or solipsistic Wiggles fare; it's a true gem, highly recommended by every child librarian, parent, kid advocacy group and mainstream press outlet you've ever heard of.  A must-have for early readers.",1201046400,4,582,5.225806451612903
8221171,5,B000W4D902,"There's a higher standard in children's music these days. Discerning parents now have more than just Raffi and The Wiggles to choose from. And school-age kids, especially mine, have become increasingly sophisticated about what they want to hear. No more ""Wheels On The Bus"" or ""Hot Potato"" for them! Children's musicians like Dan Zanes, Ralph's World, and Eric Herman have responded by producing intelligent, thoughtful songs that appeal not only to the kids, but also to the parents who are monitoring the boomboxes and car stereos.

Well, Morgan Taylor has raised the bar even higher with his astounding new release, Gustafer Yellowgold's Have You Never Been Yellow?, a highly imaginative tale of a curious creature named Gustafer Yellowgold who leaves his home on the Sun to explore Earth. It's all wildly inventive and surreal, just the kind of lyrics that kids of all ages will eat up. The music is shimmering pop that sounds like a cross between XTC, Robyn Hitchcock and Donovan. There are plenty of jangly guitars and hand-claps mixed in with the gentle pianos and horns. The CD also comes with a DVD of animated videos for each song, beautifully drawn by Taylor. It's a treat for the ears and eyes.

I've played this disc for friends who raved about it, having no clue that it was a children's CD. Most importantly, though, my kids give Gustafer Yellowgold the highest praise, both asking for songs to be repeated while we drive around town.",1193529600,5,1449,4.8861788617886175
8221172,5,B000W4D902,This is the anticipated follow-up to the critically acclaimed 'Gustafer Yellowgold's Wide Wild World'.  Number two in the series by illustrator/songwriter Morgan Taylor.,1193270400,,169,6.3478260869565215
8221173,5,B000W4D902,"If you've never experienced the magic, whimsy and beauty of Morgan Taylor's creation, Gustafer Yellowgold, the second DVD/CD set will entrall you and your kids - of all ages.  If you loved the first set, you will not be disappointed.  All the songs are excellent but my family and I are especially taken with the lyrical ""Bluebird Tree,"" and the hilarious ""Mustard Slugs.""  If you are unsure whether this is to your taset, visit the character's engaging website [...] and sample a song or two;  you won't regret it.",1193011200,,515,4.752808988764045
