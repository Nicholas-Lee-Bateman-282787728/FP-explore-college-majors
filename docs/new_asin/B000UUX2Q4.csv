8401818,1,B000UUX2Q4,"I decided to give this film a chance, because it really is an intriguing story. Set in 1969, in a small town in Florida. An alcoholic father has abandoned his wife and child. The child is slow and has all kinds of problems, so the mother is forced to open up a business. In 1969 what kind of business does every small southern town need? You guessed it, a sex shop! It's a different plot and seemed like it would be a very interesting story, but looks can be deceiving. They hire writers to make the ""official"" description of the movie, so it sound great and you'll go see it, and in this case they got me. This has got to be one of the slowest and most pointless movies I have ever seen. Everyone is portrayed as stupid, the film is choppy and makes no sense, and on top of that it's just a total bore! They fooled me, don't let them fool you! Avoid this one!",1361577600,,860,4.125
8401819,3,B000UUX2Q4,"I am a college professor of disability studies, and I bought this DVD to add to my collection of films about disabilities.  In this case, the title came up when I was searching for a film on autism.  This film is NOT about autism.  If you are seeking a film about autism, do not purchase this one.

This IS a powerful film in the tradition of Eudora Welty, Flannery O'Connor and other Southern gothic writers who portrayed a strong sense of place peopled with grotesque characters.  It has won several film awards.  However, it is decidely not about autism.",1256428800,3,557,4.575757575757576
8401820,4,B000UUX2Q4,"It is an intense, sad and a make you think movie.  I enjoyed it.  I purchased it because my son, Jason Antoon, was in it.  He played the pharmacist.  It is not a fast paced movie.",1207353600,,179,3.888888888888889

Odd, haunting little gem.  Not much plot but excellent acting and definitely food for thought!",1201478400,2,266,10.521739130434783
