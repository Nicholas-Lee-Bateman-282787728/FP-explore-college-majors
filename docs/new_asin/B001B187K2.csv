8281042,5,B001B187K2,This is a very interesting book for Dickens fans and students of Victorian London generally.  His novels taken on an added dimension when you can see the very places they were referring to and the influence his surroundings had on his work.  Highly recommended.,1492387200,,261,4.909090909090909
