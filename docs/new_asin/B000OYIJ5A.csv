2806301,5,B000OYIJ5A,"Tru Confessions was one of my all time favorite DCOMs as a kid. I had been searching for this movie for the past several years. I found the VHS version. However, it was $100 and I didn't want to pay that much for it. But thankfully, it is now on Amazon! This movie is awesome, especially because it came out during a time when Disney movies taught kids a lesson. It teaches kids that being different is okay! I would definitely recommend watching this movie!",1453680000,5,458,4.4
2806302,5,B000OYIJ5A,where's the movie? and what is the real price?? whats the point of putting it up here if there really is no movie!,1393113600,,114,4.0
2806303,5,B000OYIJ5A,This is a great movie for siblings and parents of someone with special needs. So true to life and the acting is superior.,1366588800,9,121,4.304347826086956
2806304,5,B000OYIJ5A,"This movie first ared on the Disney Channel and was a real precursor for the superb acting ability of Shia LeBeouf. He slipped into the character, mannerisms and verbal acuity of a disabled person with such ease.  Stunning performance.",1317427200,10,235,5.0256410256410255
2806305,5,B000OYIJ5A,"One of the few, meaningful and great Disney films. Before Disney was really condescending and talking down to their audience, that had a handful of shows and movies that really appealed to their audience and this is one of them.

Tru confessions is the story about a young teen named, Trudy Walker who is living with her mom, dad, and developmentally disabled twin brother, Eddie.  Tru has a lot going on at school and at home, but she doesn't really know how to talk to her friends or parents about it. She does, however , carry her video camera with her at all times, and this is how she expresses herself.

When the chance to enter a video contest comes up, Tru will have the opportunity to view her life in a new way and to really see herself and those around her. And if she wins the contest, it will be her first step into a filmmaking/moviestar career.

This was one of my favorite Disney films as a kid, and while I'm sad that it still isn't available to buy on DVD, and there's no way to download it to my computer, I had the chance to buy it on Amazon, and that it will always be on my Amazon library.",1474848000,3,1111,4.226415094339623
2806306,5,B000OYIJ5A,So emotional over it. !! Love this movie remember when it came out.,1473206400,,67,4.230769230769231
2806307,4,B000OYIJ5A,Enjoyable.,1469232000,,10,10.0
2806308,5,B000OYIJ5A,"I first watched this movie when I was 10 years old. I remember really enjoying it as a kid and as an adult I still remembered snippets from the movie, such as the library scene. I looked it up and behold! It is available on Amazon! Watching it again I basically cried through the whole thing. I never remembered it being so sad! But it is a truly realistic portrayal of a real life family and everyone can take something from the movie. I can't say enough about Shia LaBeouf's performance, as he truly fit the roll. I would recommend that everyone watch this movie!!",1466035200,3,566,4.4
2806309,5,B000OYIJ5A,Looking to find it and buy it on DVD do u have it on DVD to buy it a great movie,1465084800,3,80,2.857142857142857
2806310,5,B000OYIJ5A,"I saw this movie when I was about 12 and loved it. I watched it again recently and loved it just as much as the first. It is a Disney movie, so expect it to be more geared toward a younger audience. Tru seems whiny, but hey....she IS a teenager. We've all been there.

However, Disney just doesn't make movies now like they did back in the day. The storytelling is great and there is true emotion in this movie. This comes from a time where storytelling was more important than catering to the public.

I highly recommend it!",1464912000,4,525,4.292929292929293

2806314,3,B000OYIJ5A,"I remember watching this when I was younger so I wanted to see it again. It is a Disney channel movie so don't expect Oscar worthy performances. But it is still a sweet movie. Shia Labeouf did an amazing job on the film, a great performance.",1459209600,3,241,4.260869565217392

8187743,5,B000OYIJ5A,"I love this movie! It was one of my favorite Disney movies when it came out on TV when I was a kid. Totally made me cry and I'm not a movie crier normally. Now as a mom, I couldn't stop sobbing through this movie. Yes, it's cheaper/lower quality than some movies, and maybe a little corny at times too, but the message is so sweet. Shia Labeouf did an awesome job letting you feel the emotions he was feeling. Bought it to show my girls to help open their eyes towards others around them.",1491696000,,488,4.147368421052631
8187744,4,B000OYIJ5A,"The Disney Channel has gotten away from making realistic shows and movies. Life isn't joke after joke.  Not everyone wears perfect clothes. Most people are not rich.
This movie is beautifully done. A small look into an often neglected topic- an often ignored people.",1488067200,,266,5.045454545454546
8187745,5,B000OYIJ5A,"Seriously one of the BEST movies ever. I remembered it from my teenage years and I was super excited to find it on here.... Once my daughter is old enough to understand what's going on, I plan to show her this movie too! Accept everyone no matter what!!",1482796800,,253,4.291666666666667
