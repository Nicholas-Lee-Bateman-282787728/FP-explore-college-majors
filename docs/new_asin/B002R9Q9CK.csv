Best DVD they have done.
Scott is at his peak here.",1410739200,,70,4.071428571428571
8378522,1,B002R9Q9CK,"This is a bootleg. The video looks like it was a 4:3 source but it has been stretched to 16:9. I advise you to save your money rather than waste it on this dvd, as I foolishly did.",1407542400,,180,3.763157894736842
8378523,3,B002R9Q9CK,"This was a very good concert, but the audio and picture quality was terrible. I really enjoyed the setlist. I guess i cant complain tho. Im happy with my purchase.",1358121600,,163,4.466666666666667
8378524,5,B002R9Q9CK,If you are a Stone Temple Pilots fan you should buy this; you won't be disappointed.  Incredible jam at the end with the Doors Robby Kreiger really is a nice touch.  I keep watching it along with Stone Temple Pilots 'Live in the Windy City'.  No reason this band should ever break up again; though they might because Scott Weiland is always stoned.  So I guess I'll enjoy them while they last.,1349568000,,393,4.416666666666667
