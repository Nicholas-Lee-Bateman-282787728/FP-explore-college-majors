8426289,5,B004DXXBIS,"As a fan of old B&W classic movies of horror, mystery, film noir etc..this is a must have. Sanders became one of my favorite actors along with
Dana Andrews both who made fantastic films that many never saw or rarely shown on TV. This is one of them. Sanders plays the Saint character
mostly known from Roger Moore's TV show. In this one he plays a double role as the Saint and a criminal and along with Bela Lugosi who has
a small but effective role and should have been used more this movie has a great script and acting and twist and turns. If you like The Saint
or Sanders or Lugosi or just great classic movies this is a good one to start also get The Saint in London with Sanders.",1476576000,,685,4.157894736842105
