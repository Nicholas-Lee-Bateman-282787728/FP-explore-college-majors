6425197,5,B00KGDWJ3W,"This DVD is a must have for any Outlaws fan. I am happy to have a copy of it. I had posted previous feedback (I since removed) in which thought that the seller, had made a threat against me because of a dis-agreement over shipping damage regarding my first copy. The seller assured me that he did not threaten me, and promptly sent me out not one, but 2 replacements! I would recommend this DVD and this Seller. My apologies, and Thank you Joe!",1443052800,2,444,4.2976190476190474
6425198,5,B00KGDWJ3W,This DVD was awesome. Seeing Hughie and Billy together again was absolutely incredible. The sound and video are incredible especially considering there over 30 years old. An absolute must have for any Laws fan . It's like reliving your best Laws concert over and over again.,1433894400,,274,4.978260869565218
6425199,5,B00KGDWJ3W,"Now this video is truly awesome.  I didn't even know this footage existed. The footage is pro-shot and is a little grainy, but has stood the test of time.  This footage is worth it's weight in gold.  Despite being a little grainy it is worth having and the sound really pops.  In addition to the longer show on this DVD, there is additional footage of the Loreley Festival in 1981. As a long time fan of the Outlaws, my life changed from the first time I heard GGHT.  As a musician I am always looking for video of them where I can watch those fingers work the magic.  Not to mention how cool the lineup is at the crescendo of GGHT.  Don't let this one go.",1422921600,,656,4.158730158730159
6425200,5,B00KGDWJ3W,this a great dvd of the outlaws i am a long time outlaws fan and theres not much footage of the band you will not be disapointed a excellent show for the money you cant beat it,1403740800,,176,3.7837837837837838
6425201,5,B00KGDWJ3W,This is a must have for long-time Outlaws fans. Makes you appreciate the unique guitar interplay between Hughie Thomasson and Billy Jones. Video and sound quality is good considering how long ago these shows took place. Takes you back to the glory days of live Southern rock.,1402704000,,275,4.872340425531915
6425202,5,B00KGDWJ3W,The Outlaws tear it up in support of the Ghost Riders Album. Really cool interplay between Hughie and Billy (incredibly underrated). Good picture quality and great camera angles. Brings back all those great memories from all the Outlaws shows back in the day. The Outlaws could really bring it.,1402444800,,294,5.020408163265306
6425203,5,B00KGDWJ3W,"This show is from the 1980 tour of the Ghost Riders album. This is a must have for the fans of this Florida rock band. Recorded in 1980 this DVD has 13 songs. It features great guitar work from the late Hughie Thomasson and Billy Jones, also with guitarist Freddie Salem. Also there's the powerful rhythm section of Rick Cua on bass and David Dix on the drums. The quality is excellent for a 30 plus year show. The multi camera angles are good also. Plus the vocals are top notch. My favorite moment from the concert is when Hughie and Billy are smiling back at each other during Green Grass And High Tides! I enjoyed watching this show as it brought back alot of memories for me back 33 plus years ago. I was a senior in high school and i caught the band twice that year on the Ghost Riders tour. Grab this DVD folks, you won't be disappointed.",1402444800,3,845,4.254658385093168
8658290,4,B00KGDWJ3W,"I have been a huge 70's/80s The Outlaws fan for over 40 years and never get tired of the music and master-guitar playing. Watching Hughie and Billy is as good as it gets if you like this kind of music. I know they get compared to LS but to me, The Outlaws offer something different, that's all. The show and close ups are excellent if you are a true fan, no doubt. The only downside of this video is the bait and switch of the GGHT video, which is poor quality and can be seen for free on video sites already. I was really bummed out to see that version of GGHT. Maybe when I bought the video I missed the wording that the GGHT was that video, but either way I was surprised and disappointed when I watched it. You might not mind.",1533254400,,730,4.076388888888889
8658291,1,B00KGDWJ3W,"Very poorly recorded,  both audio and video . It reminded me of the ""bootleg"" videos that popped up before dvd .",1502496000,,112,4.333333333333333
8658292,4,B00KGDWJ3W,"video and audio are just acceptable, but the best songs are here, and you really get the feel of the power guitar band at their peak...probably the best us outlaw fans are going to find after all these years...",1498694400,,210,4.410256410256411
8658293,5,B00KGDWJ3W,Saw them live around when this was filmed and it brought back memories. Good quality considering it is early 80's.,1496880000,,114,4.75
8658294,3,B00KGDWJ3W,"HT Audio great to deal with. The DVD is not great quality. Picture is a little grainy, I can deal with that. The sound quality is not good at all bordering on terrible. I have a $4000 system and this DVD sounds like it's coming from a soundbar. Midrange sound only.

8658295,5,B00KGDWJ3W,The seller of this DVDs couldn't have treated me better. I recommend buying anything from ht audio llc. The first copy of this DVDs must have been a bad one. They sent me a new one and also the outlaws 2007 DVDs at no charge to me. NOW THAT IS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE.  ALSO: both DVDs were fantastic,1473379200,,299,4.155172413793103
8658296,5,B00KGDWJ3W,Fantastic album.  I have a few Beat Farmers CD's and this is by far the best (and has the most songs as well).,1473379200,,110,3.782608695652174
8658297,2,B00KGDWJ3W,"First off, have always liked bed the Outlaws, that being said, you have to be a huge fan to watch this dvd all the way thru. The video looks like it was copied with a camcorder aimed at at screen. The audio is horrible on the first half and only slightly better in the second half. The video stops and starts at the end of each song. There are no audio choices or any kind of menu functions.
There is absolutely no bass in the first half, you can not here anything from the bass guitar or drums. The second half is only slightly better.
It was a treat to see the guys in action but the overall quality of this dvd is deplorable.
Its a shame that no high quality live video/audio is available for this super group. If you love this group the video is worth watching.",1471564800,,765,4.140939597315437
8658298,5,B00KGDWJ3W,"First of all HT Audio LLC are a great Amazon partner to deal with.  They ship fast , package well , and address problems quickly to the customers satisfaction. O.K. now on to the video. I bought this DVD knowing that it wouldn't be a typical big name production so I was not disappointed. It was GREAT to see the Florida Guitar Army in the glory years. Seeing Hughie and the boys brought back awesome memories. If your a a fan of the Outlaws you must own this DVD. Also, they have a GREAT CD of the Outlaws at Nassau Coliseum ( I was there ! ) Buy it !! Thanks a million to HT Audio !",1462060800,,584,3.9914529914529915
8658299,5,B00KGDWJ3W,"Considering when it was recorded, this is about as good as it gets! I saw them open for Bad Company when I was 13 years old. They are amongst  the best all-time Southern Rock bands  for sure!",1454457600,,191,4.135135135135135
