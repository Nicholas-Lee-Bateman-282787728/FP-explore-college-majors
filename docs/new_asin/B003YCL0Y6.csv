4228131,5,B003YCL0Y6,So good they made numerous spinoffs. Cheesy sci-fi at it its gooiest. It has Helen Hunt.... That's kind of a big name... sort of...lol.,1372636800,,135,4.666666666666667
4228132,1,B003YCL0Y6,"I enjoy cheezy 1 star movies. What I do not enjoy is a shoddy quality that looked to be pirated in some back alley in China. The truth is that the back alley in China would have done a better job than what I had put in my DVD player. I also echo the other 1 star reviews here as far as the quality of the disc themselves. You are better off finding an old VHS tape and a player that still works.

SAVE YOUR MONEY AND NEVER BUY ANYTHING BY THE COMPANY THAT PRODUCED THIS SHODDY POOR EXCUSE FOR A DVD.",1359676800,3,499,3.892156862745098
4228133,5,B003YCL0Y6,"Being a long-time fan of Full Moon and it's films, it's a bit surprising that it took me this long to get around to the Trancers trilogy. It had been at least 15 years since I'd seen any of them, and they were every bit as campy-awesome as I remembered. Tim Thomerson's performances exude the confidence a tongue-in-cheek sci-fi hero like Jack Deth should. Helen Hunt delivers what may be the only competent acting in any of these films, but let's be honest... when you pick up Trancers or any of its sequels, you're not shopping for Oscar-winning performances.

Along with Subspecies, the Trancers Trilogy sits like a sparkling jewel in the crown of Full Moon Video's top-shelf brand of ridiculous action cinema. Just remember, as Jack Deth always says, ""Only a squid can be tranced!""",1345420800,2,785,4.772058823529412
4228134,4,B003YCL0Y6,The Trancers trilogy set include the first two movies on side A of the disk and Trancers 3 on side B.  It nice to get three movies for one low price. Especially when the movies go together as these three movies where Trancer Hunter Jack deals with both his first wife and current wife in these stories. Protecting the past to save the future. The only draw backs in this set is the picture quality of the first Trancer film isn't up to those for 2 and 3 when it comes to the transfer to disk.  Also you really only get PLAY and CHAPTERS for options compared to your usual single disk that offer more bonus options.,1331424000,5,614,4.239316239316239
4228135,5,B003YCL0Y6,"This item was received in great condition and perfect working orders.  In my opinion, these are some of the best science fiction movies ever made.  It has been so long since I have seen them that I didn't remember them.  Jack Deth is still one of the coolest characters of all time.  Tim Thomerson does a superb job as Mr. Deth.  I recommend this to any science fiction fan.",1316649600,2,374,4.36231884057971
4228136,1,B003YCL0Y6,"Let me start by saying that I love ""Trancers"".  With exception to the 6th film, I enjoy the entire series.  So, the 1 star rating I'm giving this DVD has nothing to do with the movies themselves.  That being said...where should I begin.

I went into this latest ""Trancers"" DVD trilogy with the slim hope that some of the problems from the previous DVDs would finally be rectified (most specifically the problems with the first movie).  After all, Echo Bridge is starting to release movies on Blu-Ray, so I figured there was some chance they might be using newer and better source material than that of previous ""Trancers"" DVDs.  Sadly, such is not the case.

The disc itself is a double-sided, single-layer DVD.  Movies 1 and 2 are on side one, while movie 3 is on side two.  All three movies appear to be sourced from the exact same video masters are their previous incarnations.  In the case of the original film, this means it's the same shoddy LaserDisc transfer with the same ""side change"" and the same telecining problems.

For those of you who don't know what I'm talking about, ""Trancers"" is literally dubbed off of the Vestron LaserDisc release.  But, for some odd reason, this duplicate recording seems to...drift, almost as though the playback of the original LaserDisc source was a few milliseconds slower than the equipment recording it for DVD.  The result is an excess of additional interlace lines, blurring images, and no chance at progressive film playback through a DVD player.

Additionally, every DVD of the 1st ""Trancers"" includes a now infamous ""side-change"".  Since the LaserDisc source was double-sided, the image abruptly goes to black midway through the movie and then fades back in.  This is where the DVD's authors had to flip over the LaserDisc to continue the movie.  Why this break in the action was never simply edited out is completely beyond me.

There is, however, one difference in the presentation of the original ""Trancers"".  The closing credits now feature the trailer for ""Trancers II"".  This is superimposed in a window in the upper-middle of the screen as the credits roll.  Movies 2 and 3 are not altered in this manner and feature their original closing credits.

Also, this ""Trancers"" trilogy DVD includes a brand new problem I've not seen on any other edition--improper 16x9 flagging.  When I popped this DVD into my set-top player, the image was stretched from 4x3 to 16x9.  But, when I played it back through my PC, the picture was in its proper 4x3 format.  So, be warned that some players may force this DVD into an ugly, stretched 16x9 playback.

The treatment of the ""Trancers"" franchise over the years is appalling.  Even considering the limitations of their source material, there is no reason Full Moon Pictures could not have handled these DVDs better.  And, though this DVD does offer more ""bang for your buck"", it still has all of the problems we've come to expect from ""Trancers"" on DVD...plus some new ones :(",1288051200,50,2970,4.827722772277228

8408967,2,B003YCL0Y6,"For the price, it's hard to beat 3 movies for $4 which is about what I paid for this DVD release.  However, the fabrication of this DVD leaves so much to be desired.  Let's start with the cover.  The three Trancers movies had three different movie posters or VHS covers so why did they simply repeat the artwork for the first movie three times?  If they were only going to use one piece of artwork why not simply use the Trancers 1 artwork once and call it Trancers Trilogy or something and put all three movie titles over it?  It's really bizarre.  Then inside the case is something I've never seen, all three discs were stacked onto one spindle.  Not spindles that overlap which I've seen before, but simply one spindle with 3 discs on it.  The transfers of the movies were not very good, especially the first one which has a highly washed out black level and a lot of white horizontal lines and pops that you can tell came off a 3/4"" tape source or something similar.  During the end credits they superimpose a promo for Trancers 2 over the top of the credits.  Oddly, the Trancers 2 promo has correct color levels and its blacks look black which only calls attention to how grey the black levels look on the Trancers 1 credit roll.  Obviously all three movies are in fullscreen, I don't know if any of them were originally in widescreen or not so I give that a pass.  There are a couple of extras on the making of Trancers 2.  Oddly, similar extras have appeared on other releases of Trancers 1 and 3 that do not appear on this release.  Just a very poorly put together release but again, for the price it's hard to argue against it.",1418860800,,1637,4.35973597359736
8408968,5,B003YCL0Y6,This is classic science fiction. I remember seeing this movie a long time ago when I was a teenager and I thought the movie was great and I just remembered this year that this would be a great movie to have. When I saw that I could buy the first 3 movies of Trancers for a good price I knew that I would have time to watch the 2nd and 3rd movies in this series. All 3 movies are classics and in the future I will buy the 4th and the 5th movies in the series.,1418688000,,458,3.78125
