669276,5,6303499996,Straight to the point.  You cannot lift heavy but this helps you not to miss a workout.  Great for students and busy moms.,1095206400,4,122,4.260869565217392
669277,4,6303499996,"It was only because I saw such great results from the ""8 Minute Abs"" video that I could really come through with the level of commitment I needed to make this tape work.  I mean, for some reason this took alot longer for me to get with the program.  It's not so simple as the ""New Sex Now"" or ""Goddess Worship"" videos, where you just watch it once and you pretty much get it.  With this program you gotta watch the tape every single time, and follow along with the guy doing the stuff.  And while it is fun to do that with the Goddess Worship video too, it's a different kinda viewing experience... though still highly enriching.  Anyway, the point is that you gotta put these techniques into action, every single day, and practice this stuff so it pays off -- since there's no sense just watching tapes like these just once and continuing to feel fat.",1075161600,10,852,4.367088607594937
669278,3,6303499996,"I think the ""buns"" part of this video is great--I felt and saw results almost immediately.  But I was disappointed with the ""legs/thighs"" portion.  I have problems with my knees so was unable to do some of the lunges and squats.  Despite doing the rest of the tape, I didn't see much positive result in my legs or thighs.",1058832000,2,321,4.406779661016949
669279,4,6303499996,"I use this in addition to 8 minute abs and would definitely recommend it. The 8 minutes go by fast and you can feel your heart rate rise. There is not alot of jumping around which you find in other workouts. The workout is sequenced so that you target the buns and thighs. The only part I found hard was the forward and reverse lunges, so I definitely recommend either using a chair for balance or doing a modified move. I felt toning within a week of using this routine.",1053907200,7,471,4.2444444444444445
669280,5,6303499996,As a 41 year old mom of two I don't have a lot of time for exercise and  I figured I at least could give myself 8 minutes a day.  On top of that my metabolism has taken a nasty turn (yet again) and these two areas are of great concern.  I've been doing the exercises for a four days now.  The tape is fast paced and tough.  I really appreciate the clock as it motivates me to keep going when I feel I can no longer.  I do both buns and thighs in 16 minutes and I feel I've really done something.  I can't wait to see the results and I'm confident I will.,1051747200,,554,3.765217391304348
669281,5,6303499996,"I started out with a very weak , injured back, and no abd strength at all. I did this tape, along with Quick Fix pilates, and now I have a stronger back, and my oblique muscles are showing up on my stomach. Easy to use, and get stronger tape, instructor is not annoying, tape is not too long, and I look and feel great. also had great results with 8 min buns.wonderful work out, just do it",1051488000,3,389,4.064935064935065
669282,4,6303499996,This video is old but it is a great workout.  I love Jaime Brenkus' work and highly recommend his workout videos to anyone looking for a workout without benefit of a gym.,1049846400,,170,4.3125
669283,4,6303499996,"This video is tougher than it appears.  After 5 minutes of the buns section i am tired and wanting to quit, however, the burn is letting you know that you are working that all important Gluttis Maximus (according to Jamie Brenkus)  The thighs part is quite abit simplier and is actually the same exact workout as the 8 minute legs.  When the thighs portion comes on it actually says 8 minute legs.  These 2 workouts are the same and i suggest buying this dual pack and saving your money instead of buying legs seperately.",1047340800,15,521,4.51063829787234
669284,5,6303499996,"These workouts are not for those ""No Pain, No Gain"" people.  I love them because, as out of shape as I was, I could do a workout and not be sore the next day.  Yet, I definitely saw results after a week.  That's because I was able to stick with it.  It didn't take a lot of time, and I felt good afterward.  It seemed to give me an energy boost.  Watching the clock count down during the workout was a real motivator, too.  I also love that the tape has two different workouts, so when you no longer find a single workout challenging, you can do them back-to-back for a new level of challenge.",1040688000,,593,4.104347826086957
669285,5,6303499996,"I recently purchased the 8 minute buns with 8 minute legs to do before work.  I felt the ""burn"" after the first workout.  This video really gives you a good workout in just 8 minutes.  The instructor, Jaime Brenkus, is easy to follow and walks you right through the exercises. I highly recommend this tape to anyone who has a limited amount of time, yet wants to get an effective workout.  It is amazing at how fast the time goes and how good you feel when you are done.",1035849600,2,470,4.247191011235955
669407,1,6303499996,"Please do not be decieved. Although the tape says that it is Buns & Thighs, the tape is actually the buns workout along with the legs workout. I have all of the 8 minute tapes and enjoy them. I simply do not want others to order this tape and have to also return it because it is mis-labled.",997660800,19,291,4.0344827586206895
669408,4,6303499996,"As with any exericse tape, it's always best to watch it first. Sometimes I watch a tape two or three times before getting down on the floor and working up a sweat, and this was one of those videos I had to watch more than once ... allow me to explain.
When I first watched the tape, I didn't focus much on the exercises. With Jamie Brenkus leading the group, I must say he never stops talking for two seconds! There is, however, a guy behind Jamie, who seems to be having a difficult time with the exercises. He resembles He-Man (remember He-man, fellow early 80's kiddies?), and seems to look as though somewhere between popping a vein in his forehead and performing the exercises at the same pace as everyone else, he's trying to insert the odd smile; to make some rather (unsucessful) attempt at convincing the viewer the workout is 'fun'. I almost fell off the couch watching this guy ... too funny!
On a more serious note, you really don't notice this guy much while you're working out, and Jamie's constant chattering is really quite motivating. He really knows what to say to those of us lazy people who would much rather watch the He-man look-alike grunt and sweat while laughing hysterically from the comfort of our couches. He knows how too keep you active, challenged, and kind of proud that you made it through 8 minutes of exercise.
There is a clock on the screen, and an indicator of the exercises completed in a little 'climbing scale type' format on the side of your screen. Both are useful for those of us who don't like working out and constantly keep asking ourselves ""Are we there yet? Are we there yet?"". You can see how much you've done in terms of time, and in terms of how much you've worked out. It's not so bad when you're losing your steam and suddenly you realisze you've only got 3 and a half minutes left.
Jamie always smiles and encourages the viewer before, during and after the workout. He always says at the end of a workout, ""I'll see you in 24 hours!"" I'm not sure working out your lower body is something that should be done everyday, or two days in a row, for that matter. I don't use this tape every 24 hours, but maybe once or twice a week (and never two days in a row!). However, I suppose if you want to use this tape everyday, there shouldn't be a problem ... it's a great areobic workout that really gets your blood pumping too!
Some of the exerices overlap in both the Buns and Thighs workouts, such a squats. It's not really a big deal since you're only doing around 30 - 45 seconds of squats anyway, so a little extra won't hurt. I always do these workouts one after the other, without a break. 16 minutes isn't much for a busy person to spare a few times a week. Also, it would be nice if there were more calf exercises, but the ones provided are pretty effective. In 8 minutes, it's about as well-rounded as any workout can get in such a short time!
Definately a good start for those of us who are just plain lazy when it comes to exercise, or for those of us who are just too busy to spend 90 minutes in a glute class at the gym. For those with more time I wouldn't reccommend this, unless you like to travel and need something quick and effective to keep in shape while away from home. This would make a good gift for students, busy people, and anyone who travels alot.",994377600,31,3320,4.339228295819936
669409,3,6303499996,"I bought this tape looking for a short work-out that would help me to firm up and give me new ideas for a lower-body workout.  The buns section is great for beginners and experienced fitness buffs as well.  I exercise regularly and this short workout is definately beneficial.  While the buns workout can be somewhat challenging, I found the legs to be somewhat easier than the buns and would recommend that portion for beginners or those who don't exercise regularly.",993427200,4,468,4.825
669410,5,6303499996,"This tape is great.  I've been looking for something that doesn't take up to much time because I have 3 kids and not much time to myself.  I finally found it.  This tape is only 8 minutes and you can really feel the results.  The first day I was sore, but after a couple of weeks I felt stronger.  I would recommend this to anyone who is seeking results in toning with not much time on their hands.",992822400,2,398,4.051282051282051
669411,5,6303499996,"I have made a goal to work out at least 3 times a week and found myself never having ""time.""  I tried using my really old aerobics tapes  from the late 80's and found them to be too long or generally not  ""safe"" by today's standards and my older body.  I found the  exercises on this video to be extremely beneficial and actually FUN!  Just  when you think how much time is left?  I look on the TV screen and see I am  almost done!  I also have 8 Minute Abs and Arms and alternate doing 2 of  each a day.  They have not given me any back problems (which I had injured  in a car accident) and I feel great after finishing.  I highly recommend  these tapes to anyone who really doesn't enjoy working out and to those who  do enjoy it!",966902400,28,732,4.013986013986014
669412,5,6303499996,"I have become a fan of this series of exercise tapes. Having already been using a Nordic Track faithfully for 2 years, I thought my legs were well  toned with a hard butt. This workout proved to me that there were areas  that still could feel the burn. The tapes onscreen clock and the instructor  encouraging you all through the tape seems to make the workout shorter.  After the first 2 times doing the butt exercise I could honestly say  ""My buns are burning"". A great instructional tape.",966384000,9,491,4.534090909090909
669413,5,6303499996,"I bought this tape originally in a set (8 minute buns, 8 minute Abs) and I love them both!  I had tried Denise Austin's tapes and she was WAY too bubbly sweet for me.  Jaime is a lot more ""to the point.""  It is  only an 8 minute tape, but you'll definitely feel it the next day - I would  pace yourself when you do it for the first time.",948931200,42,337,3.757142857142857

7849285,4,6303499996,"I got this workout because I love the 8 minute Abs workout so much and love the results and this tape didn't disappoint! Even though I've had this tape for over 10 years, I still use it on a regular basis and the workout still gives/maintains excellent results. After a few weeks, I noticed my bottom and thighs were more toned! Though this workout is so short, it is very intense and you definitely feel the burn.

As with all the other tapes in this series, Jamie, the instructor keeps you motivated and helps you focus on proper form so as not to aggravate your back. The 8 minutes really flies by and it's easy to fit it into your daily routine.

I'm only giving it 4 stars because of the included 8 MInute Thighs - that workout is great and also yields excellent results, but I also bought 8 Minute Legs separately and it is the SAME product/workout! Don't buy 8 Minute Legs because you already get it on this tape.",1407628800,,920,4.343023255813954
7849286,5,6303499996,"You're not going to get as ripped as the people in the pic on the box, but you will get a nice bit of toning and in just 8 minutes.  This program is great for people who don't have a lot of time, and helps to start the workout process.  If you do it consistently you will build up a nice level of tone.  You will have to chose another program after that to really continue on as you will reach a point where this doesn't help too much any more.  But it is a great starter program!",1286668800,,480,3.86734693877551
7849287,5,6303499996,"I like Jaime's videos. I hate to work my thighs and buns. But this workout is fast and effective. I have bad knees so I have to modify some of the moves but that creates no problems as I still get a very effective workout.

I use this tape when my muscles are too sore from a weightlifting session and I need something to fill in. Both sessions, if done well, burn about 140 calories or so.

If you want to tighten up your buns and/or thighs in a short period of time, this is for you.",1159315200,,485,3.9896907216494846
7849288,4,6303499996,This workout is a good compact workout for the glutes at intermediate level. I don't know if beginners could keep with it at first. The second part for legs is not challenging (except for the numerous lunges) but it will keep you toned up.,1142208000,2,239,4.454545454545454
7849289,5,6303499996,I was looking for something that could easily fit into my schedule and produce real results.  This tape definitely fit the bill.  I use it a couple of times a week and even after the first week I saw improvements in the tone and definition.  The fact that its so quick (a total of 16 minutes for buns and thighs) make it easier to keep up with as well.  It is a bit difficult physically with a couple of the exercises but overall its a great video.,1110499200,4,448,4.114942528735632
7849290,5,6303499996,I bought the video about a week back and I have no complaints. Its a great workout for the buns. Starts with a 2 minute warm up and then three different exercises for the rear. You feel the pain and it definitely works. Its just an 8 minute routine and one can definitely find time for it.,1102377600,3,289,4.087719298245614
