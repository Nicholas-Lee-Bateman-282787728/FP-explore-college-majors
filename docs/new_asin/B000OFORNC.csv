It is informative but mostly it is fun to see the gorgeous Newfoundlands they found to star in this video. These dogs are already beautiful animals but the ones in this video are simply magnificent specimens.

If the team filming it would have been better professionals this would have been a SUPERB video, but it is still a great video that is fun to watch.",1288396800,2,466,4.35632183908046
8184876,2,B000OFORNC,"I bought this DVD for my wife for Christmas because we have a young Newfie, and I thought she'd like to have a DVD all about Newfies.

It was a mistake buying this DVD. First of all, only 20 minutes of the entire DVD is about the Newfie breed, and they only show you ONE Newfie the entire time (a puppy). A young guy who is very uncomfortable in front of the camera rattles off basic information about the breed, as very annoying silly music loops in the background.

There are two other features on the DVD. VERY basic training commands (sit, stay, down, etc.) with a dog that isn't even a Newfie. Ultra-beginner stuff. Then there's a half-hour feature with dogs running around and barking, intended to play on your TV for your dogs when you leave the house.

It's just a very lame, poorly produced, cheaply made DVD. If you want something about the Newfie breed, look elsewhere -- anywhere but here.",1200009600,13,901,4.4817073170731705
