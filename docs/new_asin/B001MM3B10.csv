8321522,5,B001MM3B10,"This video was awesome.  I'm teaching a bunch of 2nd graders who picked Black Holes as their enrichment topic and this was fun to show them instead of all the books we had been reading. Yep - it was over their head in some parts, but its fascinating for 8 year olds, it was fascinating for my husband and I. If you love all things mysterious and in space, try this out.",1432771200,,369,4.125

8321525,5,B001MM3B10,"This DVD managed to enthrall both my 6 year old nephew,who became fascinated with black holes after watching the black hole episode of ""How the Universe Works"",and myself,who watches any program about astronomy/cosmology and usually multiple times. Even when the science was way above his head, the beautifully-rendered CGI kept him enthralled. I was especially interested with the virtual trip inside a supermassive black hole. And,yes,I realize that it would be impossible for that to happen, which was made clear in the program. The discussion of the physics of it kept me as riveted as the graphics.",1308873600,3,603,5.22680412371134
8321526,3,B001MM3B10,"There is some really interesting info in this film, if you can stay awake long enough to watch it. Somehow their delivery is about like reading a computer manual.
Get some extra strong black coffee and watch it. If you can stay awake long enough to watch it all, it will give you plenty of interesting things to think about later on.",1243728000,8,333,4.387096774193548
