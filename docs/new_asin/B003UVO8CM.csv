4207733,4,B003UVO8CM,"I absolutely love this video. I think that is great for those who love low impact exercise and those who are not ready for high impact choreography. Great on the joints and great pace for beginners or those recovering from an injury and looking for an exercise routine to help get back into shape. The only reason did not give 5 stars, because will admit that the cue is bad and that introduction for the routines could have been more detailed; but for the low price I would deal with it!! Once you learn the easy choreography you are good to go and have fun with this workout!!!",1369180800,2,579,4.37037037037037
4207734,2,B003UVO8CM,"I've done this one several times (both the express and the full workouts) and I don't really like it.  I'd rather just do simple moves instead of so many ""dance-like"" moves.",1365552000,3,173,4.580645161290323
4207735,5,B003UVO8CM,Love this one.  It is a great workout.  I can do most but not all so it is good to stretch endurance.,1364688000,2,101,3.5454545454545454
4207736,5,B003UVO8CM,"This is one of my oldest FIRM workouts and was produced before they started focusing on 10 and 20 minute workouts. It contains two workouts, a 30 minute workout with a little cardio but mostly weights which I use on days when I don't have much time and want to focus on sculpting, but I really like the full workout, 45 minutes, for days when I allot the time. It's TONS of good cardio, weights and also abs at the end right before the cool down.

I strongly recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Firm-Total-Body-Time-Crunch/dp/B000SM6FJK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Firm: Total Body Time-Crunch</a>&nbsp;if you are really serious about staying in good shape. I'm 60 years old and can keep up with the much younger instructors (most of the time) and this DVD is one reason. Rebekah Sturkie is one of my favorite FIRM instructors, and always does a good job as she does here. Highly recommended.",1349481600,12,948,5.3624161073825505
8406224,5,B003UVO8CM,Use this work out 4 times a week and it works ! You will see a difference in about 3 weeks and feel a difference in 2 weeks. I didn't know I could like the habit of working out at home but I am dedicated to it. Love playing my own music and getting this 45 minute work out in.,1496188800,2,276,3.6166666666666667
8406225,4,B003UVO8CM,Not too hard (intermediate) but can use heavier weights to increase level.  Good mix of cardio with weights.  I like how there is a lot of variety.,1473206400,,147,4.407407407407407
8406226,5,B003UVO8CM,Best exercise videos ever. They are simple enough that I can follow them and at the same time they can be made more difficult by the use of heavier weights. The earlier videos are better than the later ones.,1467331200,,207,4.333333333333333
8406227,4,B003UVO8CM,This DVD has been in my workout rotation for ten years. The instructor is great and I always get my heart rate way up and get pretty sweaty. My only complaint is that it doesn't target my upper glutes as much as I'd like. Overall it's a great way to burn fat.,1462752000,,259,4.0
8406228,5,B003UVO8CM,Great workout! Not too much not too little. Shipped quickly!,1454803200,,60,5.1
8406229,3,B003UVO8CM,"Too much fancy footwork. I wasn't impressed. When she gets down to the actual sculpting moves, those are good, but I fast forward through all the cardio since she completely losses me on them.",1437091200,,192,4.676470588235294
8406230,5,B003UVO8CM,"This 45 minute workout is comprised of 37 minutes of alternating low-impact aerobics and weighted body sculpting; followed by 4 minutes of abs and a 4 minute cool down.
The floor aerobics are fast-moving but the steps are easy to learn.  The weighted sections start with a lower body move, then an upper body move; then the two are combined together for more intensity.  Often times a third muscle group is incorporated to make the movement even more useful.
Equipment needed are the Firm Cardio Weights, which you can easily substitute with your own set of three different weights; and an exercise mat.",1425427200,6,603,4.844660194174757

8406232,5,B003UVO8CM,Great video and she's one of my favorite instructors! Easy to follow and but a good workout!,1422835200,,92,4.470588235294118
8406233,4,B003UVO8CM,"I have done this workout at least 25 times by now. It's one of the DVD's I alternate with for about a year now. I still get a great workout, meaning my heart rate and breathing is increased. I love how it's choreographed to be cardio exercises mixed with light, dance-like moves.",1377475200,2,279,4.384615384615385
