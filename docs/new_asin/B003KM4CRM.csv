8398774,5,B003KM4CRM,"I gave it five stars because of the all the historical content..it just a bit old style formatting when watching it. BUT it is the only dvd on the market that is so detail.. It just boring if you are just watching to pass an exam. I recommend this for DSST takers, though.",1367884800,,272,4.150943396226415
8398775,2,B003KM4CRM,"This is just a DVD copy of a very old VHS documentary. It most definitely is not ""just the facts."" Being just facts implies the video would not be either pro-communism or anti-communism, and the video is evidently anti-communist propaganda. It also skips key events in Soviet history. I will not play it to my students, and do not recommend. Unless you are looking for a video to do an exercise with students to identify subtle propaganda. In that case it would work.",1364601600,2,467,4.63855421686747
