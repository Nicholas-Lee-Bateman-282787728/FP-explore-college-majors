8569566,5,B00BJC8USC,"Two great overlooked movies with Jack Lemmon, including his first pairing with Walter Matthau. The Fortune Cookie has just a hint of the darkness of The Apartment  with sly shots at greed, the legal profession, and the NFL. Irma la Douce takes a winking look at Puritanism while making some early feminist statements. Both are very good films with excellent casts and direction.",1467072000,,378,5.0
8569567,1,B00BJC8USC,"One of the videos does not have anything but the TGG Direct opening screen.  Video 2 does not have the movie.  This is the second time I bought a video produced by TGG Direct that was defective.  No quality control or customer service.

The first video played fine.  The second video does not play anything except the FBI warning and the TGG Direct opening screen.  In the menu, there is no movie on this DVD.  This company is a rip-off.  Not worth the trouble of returning it.  Tried to contact the company TGG Direct.  They have no email and no phone.  Probably some production in some third world country producing pirated movies.

Before buying a movie, check the studio in description.  If it says TGG Direct, don't walk, run away from the purchase.  I wish I would have noticed this was made by TGG Direct before purchasing.  Two out of three movies I ordered produced by TGG Direct were defective.  Says something about their manufacturing and quality control.",1453420800,4,967,4.666666666666667
