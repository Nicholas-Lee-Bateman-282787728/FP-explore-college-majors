2541636,4,B000EWBKL2,"This movie isn't light, fluffy entertainment, it's a film with a message. The underlying theme is on graffiti art and its culture, but there's a lot of social commentary mixed in throughout the whole movie. Seeing how fluidly and easily the two main actors can create their art was amazing. Good casting all around, and having San Francisco's Mission District as the setting couldn't have been more appropriate. There's a lot of garbage coming out of Hollywood these days -- they should pay attention to indie movies like this.

One of the great things about movies on DVDs are the commentaries and this one didn't disappoint me at all. I found the commentary on this movie to be one of the most interesting I've heard. They did a great job not only detailing background information about making the movie, but the way they presented the Mission District, and the people who live there, in such a real and heartfelt light was very enlightening. They also touch on topics tied to our culture and society on a scene by scene basis. Whether graffiti is art or vandalism can be a simple question, but this movie did a great job to make me consider both sides.",1152144000,,1155,4.661764705882353
2541637,4,B000EWBKL2,Dude?! Same thing happened to me. I bought it from the movie's website and got deleted scenes and songs and stuff but my friend Gabe bought it from here and got the wack version. I don't even think that's a real picture of SF on the cover! Whatever this is a good movie but buy the RIGHT version. Peace like chickengrease.,1151539200,,322,4.295081967213115
2541638,4,B000EWBKL2,"This movie's pretty dope. I like films about graff in general, but this one had a lot of things going for it. The cinematography, capturing the gritty but vibrant aesthetic of the Mission district, totally meshed with the appeal of graff culture, and I thought the plot, which centered on the disintegrating friendship between two writers due to problems with the law, was compelling.  I first checked it out cuz' my homie had a copy from net flix, but when I ordered it from the Quality of Life website, the one I received was way different from the one I first peeped. This dvd (Against the Wall) seems sorta like a chopped-down Hollywood version of the official film- the movie's basically the same, but it doesn't have extra features and the cover art's pretty lame. If you wanna check it out, I think you'd be better off getting the official version.",1151452800,,855,4.662251655629139

I always watched this movie repeatly when I was younger & it was streaming on Netflix, now that they no longer have it & I'm old enough to buy my own s*** I had to cop it for my collection",1469577600,,206,3.7045454545454546

8114836,5,B000EWBKL2,"The story itself is very well done. It has great cinematography, it will probably move you to tears, it has great themes about life, and mixes the graffiti aspect in well.",1372204800,,171,4.548387096774194
8114837,4,B000EWBKL2,For people not in the culture this movie is pretty damn good. I'd give 5 stars if the ending wasn't so crazy. *Spoiler* Him getting 3-5 years for graffiti would make more sense.,1368316800,,177,4.393939393939394
8114838,3,B000EWBKL2,"Benjamin Morgan's no budget character study Quality of Life is a decent film. It's not a great film but the term independent gem may well apply. Quality of Life refers to those nuisance laws like littering, prostitution and graffiti writing that degrade the status quo from inside the system.

The film follows the paths of two graffiti artists in the Mission District of San Francisco. Michael aka Heir (Lane Garrison) and Curtis aka Vain (Brian Burnam) are house painters by day and graffiti artists by night. After a run in with the law the friends follow two divergent paths. Heir moves in the direction of getting a job in an ad agency while Vain continues to spiral out of control and into self destructive behavior.

While the acting is not always even the performances by the leads are generally effective. There is good support from Luis Saguar as a concerned father and from Mackenzie Firgens as Vain's live-in girlfriend, Lisa.

The filmmakers, working on a shoestring  budget,produce a compelling portrait of the graffiti and hip hop lifestyle. The disc that I viewed from Screen Media was bare bones. I understand that the filmmakers have a bonus filled edition available for sale at their website. If you are a fan this may be the better edition to purchase. One slight problem that I did notice was that the sound was mixed extremely low during the feature. This problem is not present on the commentary track by Morgan and producer Brant Smith. The commentary track is a good listen and explains the trials and tribulations of no budget filmmaking.

This is one small gem that is worth checking out.",1210032000,,1615,4.815884476534296
8114839,3,B000EWBKL2,"Its pretty much a raw story of a graff writers life. Alot of graff writers deal with the same stuff this movies goes into. From cops, to beef, struggle and bombing.

The movie is a little low budget but easy to see past that once it gets going. Has lots of bombing, good music and a decent story IMO. By the time your done with the movie im sure youll be glad you watched it, atleast once.

its worth the 5 bucks... get it.",1202688000,,423,4.023809523809524
8114840,2,B000EWBKL2,"An all too predictable indie production: street level story aimed at the youth market with raw editing, dialogue, sound-mixing all indicative of a low (almost no) budget.  Unless you are part of the target market the characters and plot become forgettable very quickly.

I thought the Extras were of more interest having watched the film.  Director Benjamin Morgan and Brant Smith's efforts to get their baby into film festivals and then expect to be suddenly surrounded by distributors wanting to get their hands on the film were touching.  No go with Sundance but Berlin accepted, where it joined the dozens of other (better?) films on show.  It turns out that word of mouth marketing worked best to pull in the punters.  The film's website offers the DVD, a book and a CD so maybe the crew might make a few bucks in the end.",1198972800,,827,4.708333333333333
8114841,4,B000EWBKL2,"Interesting to see the dialogue around the title change. Thought I should comment to clear the air. The distributor opted to change the title (and the key art). They felt that, although everyone in the subculture knows what quality of life laws & offenses are, the general public would not. We were actually OK with the title change (to widen our audience). We were not, however, thrilled with their key art. Authenticity was/is our core value. The key art on this version basically throws that out the window. (As you can see, this is a CG creation of an SF alley way, and they superimposed our actors heads on some random bodies to get the hoodies and spray can in there.)

If you're interested in buying the real, authentic, filmmaker approved version, go to our website www dot qualityoflife-themove dot com. We're offering a grip of tasty extras that are available only from our website (in addition to our exclusive Sam Flores shirts and behind-the-scenes book).

8114842,4,B000EWBKL2,"the graffitti artworks were really amazing. what a sad and hopeless story. again, the majority americans are struggling while the politicians are bragging that america is the most powerful and the richest nation on the planet. all the roles were played wonderfully realistic and so naturally performed, a great achievment here. this is a movie turned out to be almost great but also very dark. i couldn't say i enjoyed it because it's a very sad story.",1158105600,,452,4.883116883116883
