It is realy the REO Speedwagon Live Plus dvd, witch is great, but I wanted one that contained Gary Richrath on lead guitar. The cover & even the dvd cover show him, but it is not him on the dvd when played it's Dave Amato. DON""T BUY IF YOU ALREADY ON (REO SPEEDWAGON LIVE PLUS)!!!!",1404518400,7,451,3.967032967032967
