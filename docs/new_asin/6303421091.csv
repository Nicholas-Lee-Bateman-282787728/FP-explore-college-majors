648866,5,6303421091,This video rocks. Eric keeps you going throughout the entire video. The moves are great because you can actually apply them to your dancing.,951264000,2,140,4.875
648867,5,6303421091,"I have only seen the grind workout tape once, and I just love it. I have been looking all over the place for this tape and I was unable to find it. I need it bad, I love to workout, and this tape makes me excited; Out of  all the workout tapes I have tried this is the only one that makes me  excited.",948844800,,301,3.6875
648868,3,6303421091,"I think the workout was really good, but Lynda should have spent a little more time worrying about herself, other than sitting there flirting with Eric Neis the whole time! Poor guy, he tries to spend almost an hour  working out and he's got this crazy lady on him!",922579200,2,265,4.408163265306122
648869,2,6303421091,"Fun dance moves, but by the end of the video, I was tired of doing the same routine. The video is not very challenging if you're a dancer or if you're already in good shape. Buy this video if you're out of shape or  looking for a fun video to do on lazy days.",921628800,4,259,3.7962962962962963
649104,5,6303421091,"I bought this VHS when it came out in the 90s.  Back then, it was one of my favorite ""workouts"" because it was just so cool and so fun.  The music was the same music we were listening to on the radio.  The vibe was the same vibe we wanted to bring to our school dances (I was a teen in the 90s).  All in all, it was hilariously fun.

I busted out this VHS more recently, and popped it in on one of those days when I didn't really want to work out, but just wanted to move and have fun (I still have a VHS player).  And ""oh snap"", it was still fun!  Even moreso now that it makes me reminisce on my ""younger"" days of the 90s when I loved hip-hop.  The moves are ""fly"", with none of those booty-poppin'/stripper or complicated poppin/lockin/isolation moves of today.  All the dancers in the video are amazing (well minus Eric, who has little rhythm) and bring their own ""flava"" to the moves.  I'm biased because I have such history with the workout, but I think it's supposed to be taken like a dance class where, it's not really supposed to be an intense workout, and the moves aren't really supposed to be done at a club, but it's supposed to get you moving to have a good time.  I also think I had a crush on Anthony... I hope that's his name.  He was one of the dancers with the dreads that takes his shirt off mid-way through the DVD.

I think people who were around in the 90s and loved hip-hop as much as I did will love this video.",1323648000,,1437,4.0711743772241995
649105,3,6303421091,"The MTV Grind Workout: Hip Hop Aerobics is a decent video if you like hip hop and putting small moves together to form a dance routine.

The instructor Linda Nader is upbeat and not overly irritating, she tries to show you all the steps as simple as possible and then jumps right into the move.  The dancers are extremely annoying (especially the Danielle chick) as they get their moment in the sun by hitting the moves with too much extra effort, proving they are professionals and making you feel inadequate because you can't dance as good as they do.  Eric Nies has no reason for being there (maybe just eye candy) because most of the time he is not in sync with the steps and he seems like he doesn't know what moves are going to be next. (He must've missed a couple of rehearsals!)

The complete routine consists of a lengthy warm-up, the actual dance sequence and a cool down followed by an ab workout, which I haven't even bothered to look at yet.  The warm-up has lunges, stretches, foot taps and hamstring pulls while the dance number takes you back with moves such as the pepperseed and the ""Creep"" from a TLC video.  The cool down has you balancing on one foot along with other moves that effectively bring your heart rate back down.

Overall, the video is great for someone who is just getting back into their exercise routine and wants to rev it up a bit. But for me it was just too much because I am completely out of shape and I need something extremely low impact!",1279238400,,1480,4.419117647058823
649106,5,6303421091,"I'd been looking for this for years, finally found it. I still love it! Great condition too.",1235260800,,92,4.470588235294118
649107,4,6303421091,"Years ago, in the 80's and 90's, I loved dancing and I invented dance moves on my own.  20+ years later I don't do that anymore and my body shows. I still ""got rhythm"".  I dug out this video, afraid I couldn't keep up.  I was able to keep up with most on the first try and when I couldn't, there are visual reminders to keep moving at their pace.  I definitely got a heart workout without getting overwhelmed.  I like that the ab workout is separate from the aerobic workout.  Basically, you can do the ab workout when you aren't worried about ""keeping up"" with fancy and quick moves.  I also liked that the different dancers had their own emphasis while the instructor stayed on the exercise track.

My only complaint would be that the music could have been louder.  If you're going to simulate a club, then the music would have a more sublime effect.  Overall, still a lot of fun and good for you.",1202256000,,899,4.3293413173652695
649108,4,6303421091,"Even though their Yoga and Pilates series videos are good, I miss the MTV hip-hop inspired cardio workouts!  I wish they would make some new ones.  :(  I disagree with the reviewer that thought the instruction was poor.  I followed along with no problem.  The choreography may take you a couple of times doing the video, but that's common with dance workouts.  I really like the music they use, tracks by Coolio and Naughty by Nature for example.  The only thing that bugged me was the marching in place between moves.  I think they needed to keep the intensity up higher, but I guess you can do that on your own.  This video is about 50 minutes long.",1138752000,4,651,4.4491525423728815
649109,5,6303421091,"The workout is alot more fun than any other exersise videos or dvds I have! The music is definitley reminiscent of the mid 90's , but all the songs are still great. The dance moves took me 2 or 3 workouts to totally get down, but it's interesting  and always gets my heart rate up. It's alot better than the soundtracks of most workouts.",1136678400,2,337,4.265625
649110,4,6303421091,"Okay...so it's 2005, this video came out 10 years ago, you might not want to bust these moves on the dance floor tonight. But hey, if you can work it, all the power to you. However, anyone can get a fun workout if they learn the moves. Even if you don't perfect the routine, the idea is to keep moving. I'm an experienced dancer/exerciser and I definitely worked up a sweat. This tape is definitely worth the $3.00 I paid for it, especially since Eric is so hot!",1119052800,,462,4.261363636363637
649111,5,6303421091,"I have owned this video since its release in '95.  I do not think this video looks out dated what so ever (?) I don't understand how that could be said. The only thing is the music, which is from that time, but it they are still hot songs (The Bucketheads, Ini Kamoze, M People, Coolio etc)

The workout itself is fun for all levels. For a beginner, it would be good to work up endurance and have fun at the same time. For advanced exercisers (like myself) I do this tape on occasion for fun, but also to break a sweat having fun dancing.

The Grind videos are really great! I am an experienced exerciser (and video exerciser!) and these are super fun! ALL of these videos are worth owning, and especially in this order IMO

-Hip Hop Aerobics and Dance Club Aerobics (tied for best IMO)

-Fat Burning Grooves

-Fitness w/ Flava

AND all of these videos have EXCELLENT club ready music that is REALLY motivating and fun! Music is so important!",1110412800,,942,4.379310344827586
649112,5,6303421091,"This tape is great.  It's pretty easy to follow and certainly easier as you do it more.  Plus, they keep repeating the moves and adding on, so you get a good chance at figuring them out.  There is a group of MTV dancers and two leaders - one male, one female - both great.  Good music, some fun comments and an overall great workout where the 35 minutes pretty much flies by.  Not the toughest in the world but good and easy to motivate yourself to pop the tape in.",1021766400,3,465,4.122222222222222
649113,4,6303421091,"I recently purchased this tape with the thought that it would be fun to incorporate a little dance into my daily workout. Having used tapes such as Jane Fonda, Cher (Much as I can't stand her, this is a great one for losing weight!), and various step aerobic tapes, I've gotten bored with the repetitive routines. This tape definately put a little spice and variety into my day, but I would not recommend it for someone with no dance background or those looking for low energy workouts. The dance in this tape is very fast (and you may have to rewind a few times to get the steps down) and requires a lot of space. Since this tape was made in '93, I definately wouldn't suggest trying to use these moves in a club (although there are often people who still do), but it makes for a fun workout and definately gets the heart rate up! Overall, it's a great tape.",1011744000,3,859,4.341614906832298
649209,4,6303421091,"...I do like the music in this video, because it's upbeat and goes along with the moves. The stretching in the begining and end is great. In this viedo they show you a dance move and then break it down and then do it at tempo. It took me a lot of rewinding to get the fun moves down. But once you know the whole routine and moves you can do it at clubs and parties. I didn't sweat a whole lot during this workout, probably becasue of all the breaking the move down.",1011139200,,465,3.9574468085106385
649210,5,6303421091,"Yes, some of these moves are now outdated, since the video was done in '95, however, they are still fun to do instead of running or some other horrendously boring form of exercise.  I found it to be fun, easy to follow (not sure how easy it is for those who don't dance well already), and the music was great!  Very energizing!",1001376000,3,327,4.258064516129032
649211,4,6303421091,"If you hate exercise, but love to dance, this video is absolutely for you!  Yes, Eric is full of himself, but the music & beat make it easy to ignore.  The music is awesome, the dancers are full of energy, and you will sweat!  The instructions are bad, but if you grew up in this era and enjoyed going to clubs, you will have no problem.  If you didn't know the moves to start with remember, it is a tape, you can practice it as many times as you need to!  I've tried some of the other Grind workouts and this is the only one I like because it is the least like an exercise video than the rest of them are.  The other tapes have a different instructor, and do not seem to be as fun as this one is.",994896000,14,697,3.9078014184397163
649212,1,6303421091,"Although Eric is great to watch, that is the only reason to buy this video.  As a user of several different video aerobics workouts, I can say this is one of the least legitimate workouts I've ever seen.  They are not actual instructors and the workout is not actually an aerobic workout.  In fact, I bought two of the MTV workout videos thinking they may be a good ""dance"" workout (plus I could watch Eric) and both are disappointments.  The routines are taught by ""kids"" rather than legitimate instructors and it quickly becomes clear why aerobics instruction isn't something any one off the street can do.  There is a correct way to teach aerobics and a correct way to ""call"" the workout so that people can actually follow you.  These MTV videos do none of that.  Bummer.  Looks like some of the moves could be fun, but the instruction is so sloppy and amateurish you will likely never achieve any level of competency where it can be fun.  SO, after all of that, I recommend the Kathy Smith videos.  There is a reason she is the queen of workout videos-she is good!  She knows what she is doing and she instructs VERY well.  You can pick up the routine after one viewing and it just continues to become a better workout the more you use it.  And, if you are like me and the sight of a cute shirtless guy helps motivate you to watch the video (come on, lets be honest here) I actually also recommend the ""Lucky Vanous: Ultimate Fat Burning Workout"" video.  It is actually really great.  Lucky isn't the greatest instructor, but they knew that and brought in a professional to do the actual instruction and Lucky is the window dressing that motivates some of us to continue to watch.  Great routine and I don't get bored of watching it!",989107200,20,1737,4.484076433121019
649213,5,6303421091,"Ok, this video is like any other thing....when you first start, it's not the easiest thing to do, but after you do it a couple of times through, it gets easier and more fun!  If you really get into the dance steps, you can get a great workout, you just have to give it a chance!!  This is my favorite of all the grind workouts, and yes, i have every one of them, and it is also one of the ones i do the most frequent out of 20 workout videos.  So, if your looking to get into shape, this is more exciting than plodding on the treadmill....this video is the one that first got me started excercising, and i lost about 30 lbs (not from video only, it just helps) from the combination of working out and eating better....so i suggest it for starting out, too!",987811200,9,756,4.129251700680272
649214,4,6303421091,"I find the video fun.  They remind you to stop for water, give tips such as drink before excercise and after.  They also pause half-way through so that you can judge how you're doing.  The thing that's most interesting is that you can almost forget you're working out.  You break a sweat if you're having fun and it doesn't require a lot of space.  The only problem I had was that I live on the second floor and my neighbors probably hate me by now.  There's a bit of jumping involved periodically.",978220800,4,498,4.358695652173913

649216,5,6303421091,"Hip Hop Aerobics is a wonderful workout video. Despite what others may have said, this video DOES make you sweat. It's about 30 mins long, not including the warm up and cool down. And after this, you get a 7 minute ab  workout. I must warn you though, this is for people who love to dance. The  routine is challenging, I must admit. And you have to have a lot of passion  , strengh, and endurance to get it down. There are lots of dancers and two  very good instructors that you can follow. You can use the moves in dance  clubs, the music is great, but you may have to rewind and pause to get the  steps down. This is a very challenging routine, but you will burn lots of  calories and tone up while having fun and learning to dance. This is a must  buy, along with Fat Burning Grooves.",957657600,72,787,4.131578947368421
649217,5,6303421091,"I bought this video about a year ago and I have been using it ever since.  It is not the type of video that makes you sweat a whole lot, but once you get the moves down, you WILL get a good workout.  The moves are fun and you  can even use them in the clubs.  Linda Nader and Eric Neis do a wonderful  job at leading you through the moves and encouraging you throughout the  video.  This video is also very good at giving your muscles a good stretch.",955929600,5,450,3.933333333333333
649218,5,6303421091,"I bought this video because I heard Eric is an expert on ab routines and after using this tape, all that I've read is definitely true.  Eric is energetic and a great coach and incorporates awesome music with easy to  learn moves.  I also recommend checking out his Abaratus device which makes  a great compliment to this video.  If you want to burn calories to the  hottest hip hop tracks then this video and Eric is your man!  Great job MTV  and thanks for a fun workout!",951264000,9,472,4.344827586206897
