4241507,5,B0040ZN9OA,"A story that truly shows that nothing in life is guaranteed. Freeze frame Marcus Dupree's life as a senior in high school and ask where would he be in 20 years and you most likely would have said the Pro Football Hall of Fame. This documentary gives you a glimpse into what went wrong. From the people who thought he was their lottery ticket to the coaching staff at Oklahoma that only saw the football talent and not the young man probably in need of fatherly guidance. It was funny seeing Barry Switzer with an ego bigger than his trophy room trying to justify his actions all these years later.
It is also pretty bizarre to see that Dupree was treated better by a man that was involved in their hometown's most hideous crime be a better friend to him (by helping him secure employment post football) than some of those closest to him.",1303430400,3,837,4.441558441558442
4241508,5,B0040ZN9OA,"Like most viewers, I was stunned at how much I enjoyed this superb documentary from Jon Hock.  Even my wife - who I can say, without reservation, despises the sport of football and football culture - was smitten by this compelling story.

In choosing this subject, Hock has rightfully judged the tale of Marcus Dupree as the great, untold sports story of the last 30 years.  That Dupree is my contemporary makes it superbly fascinating to me and people of my generation.  Like me, I'm sure they all said ""Yeah, whatever happened to this guy?""  And, like me, I'm sure they were saddened and appalled to see how Dupree was misled, poorly advised and stripped of his youthful enthusiasm.  It's appalling that an 18-year-old young man of so much promise is placed into a position of having to make a series of difficult life decisions 'advised' (a word used very loosely here) by adults with motives that were, at best, unclear or, at worst, clearly self-serving.  Of those, Reverend Ken Fairley comes out of Hock's film taking the biggest drubbing.  Neither Hock nor his camera takes down Fairley.  The reverend does the damage by and to himself.

Ultimately, Hock's film is about perseverance and triumph of character.  The winner: the Marcus Dupree, a regal man who betrays not an iota of bitterness or sadness.  What makes Hock's story work more than anything is that its protagonist - the current version of Marcus Dupree, not the one of 30-year-old gridiron glory - is a supremely likable gentleman, completely at peace with his life.

But, of the football, one note: in interviews, Hock has said that part of the intrigue of Dupree is that his exploits pre-dated the ESPN era, when everything is videoed, documented and on full display in a highlights package within minutes.  By contrast, not only did Dupree not get that treatment, his high school day exploits were solely of the 'passed down myth' variety.  Until, that is, Hock and his crew learn that there is one, reclusive man who has a series of Super 8 tapes squirreled away in a box.  After repeated entreaties from Hock and others, the tapes wind up in their hands.  As Hock says, his hands trembled as they threaded the tapes for a first viewing.

Hock's take at that exact moment: ""If all these runs are seven yards off-tackle, we don't have a film.""

What they found in those canisters instead: Pure magic.

See the film to appreciate what that moment must have been like.",1300492800,5,2439,4.734597156398104
4241509,5,B0040ZN9OA,"I just watched this for the third time on ESPN and have come to the Amazon site to purchase the DVD.  I was a student athelete at OU when Dupree was there.  I met him, watched him practice, and attended all of the home games.  He REALLY was that great !!!  Also, he seemed to genuinely be a good person -- caught up in a mass whirlwind of hysteria.  This documentary is simply outstanding in its organic approach to the unbiased telling of Dupree's story. It also deliver's a powerful message about how the transient nature of popular culture {regardless of whether or not its sports} can effect the lives of those both admired and admonished.",1296432000,,643,4.508620689655173
4241510,5,B0040ZN9OA,"This film is an absolute masterpiece.  I have seen all of ESPN's 30 for 30 series and this is the clear-cut best of the bunch-- only ""The Two Escobars"" can be mentioned in the same breath.  Jonathan Hock takes you on a ride through the ups and downs of Dupree's incredible life, compiling an incredible collection of game footage and interviews sure to keep even those with limited football knowledge entertained.  The story is fascinating, a tale of a pure, honest talent running into greed, arrogance, and corruption.  I laughed, watched in amazement, and by the end, I was even crying.  Sports fan or not, anyone can appreciate and love this film.",1294012800,8,650,4.767857142857143
4241511,5,B0040ZN9OA,"This documentary is well-paced and absolutely riveting.  I watched it with my boyfriend and we both loved it.  It somehow creates this mix of portraying a character who is a super-human athlete and at the same time just a regular everybody.  Marcus Dupree was just a kid who wanted to play football.  But, as chance? fate? would have it, his ""playing football"" was unlike any other athlete I have ever seen in terms of absolute domination.  I mean, truly unbelievable clips of him in high school are shown here, and he just plows through to touchdowns - the tacklers just bounce off of him.  Amazing.  But the best part, in my opinion, is just seeing Marcus Dupree as the man he is now.  As a truck driver, he emphasizes that his job may not be flashy, but it is an honest one.  An honest way to earn a living.  And the fact that he is more proud of that then upset at the loss of millions of dollars as a sports star is refreshing.  (And also where I cried...hey, I like sports but I am still an emotional girl, too.)  The documentarian makes magic because by the end, you truly believe that Marcus Dupree was indeed ""the best that never was.""",1292457600,,1144,4.369668246445498
4241512,5,B0040ZN9OA,"Marcus Dupree.  I've thought about this guy for the last 28 years.  He was truly EXTRAORDINARY.  Absolutely the best running back to ever put on shoulder pads.  He was better than Barry Sanders.  He was Earl Campbell and Tony Dorsett rolled up into one.

Unfortunately, he was ill prepared for the trappings that his amazing ability attracted.  He was manipulated and exploited by many including a ""man of the cloth"" from Southern Mississippi who clearly had no love for the young man.

This documentary captures both the essence of Marcus as a person and his amazing ability.  It was an absolute crime what happened to him; and while the film captures that, as well as amazing footage at Oklahoma, it shows how his spirit was not broken.  I learned alot about Marcus and I wish him the best.

Many young people can learn alot from this documentary.  Understand who has your best interest at heart and keep GOD in all of your decisions.  This film shows what can happen when you don't.  And this cat had it ALL.",1291852800,,1011,4.606741573033708
4241513,5,B0040ZN9OA,"If you are into good documentaries don't pass this up. One of the best I've seen this year, in any genre.",1291248000,,105,4.0476190476190474
4241514,5,B0040ZN9OA,"I was fortunate enough to watch and meet Marcus on multiple occasions while at OU. Never missed a home game. I was only 12 years old then and still have my first Sooner jersey, #22. Thanks to ESPN for creating this documentary and thanks to Marcus Dupree. Your determination to achieve is inspiring and a model of success.",1289433600,2,322,4.568965517241379
4241515,5,B0040ZN9OA,"I remember Marcus because in was (and still) living in North Texas. It's not that he would have been, but WAS the greatest football player ever. Then. Now. And forever. I challenge any football player past, present or future say they were, are, or will be greater. I've seen eleven G.O.A.T.'s in my life time. (Greatest Of All TIMES) Muhammad Ali, Magic Johnson, Willie Mays, Cheryl Miller, Serena Williams, Wayne Gretzky, Carl Lewis, Secretariat, Tiger Woods and Marcus Dupree. These athletes are not bound by wins and loses, but measured by the fact that No One else had as much ""IT"" as they had in their field and the ability to do everything--including be great leaders of teams or self, in the case of individual sports, simply of all times. Tonight Mr. Marcus Dupree took his rightful place among this group of God-given talented athletes. They had or have that ""it"" that even they can't explain or understand how they do ""it"". One of my favorite scenes was watching Marcus today watch his historic footage and be in awe of what he was watching. It was like he was having an out of body experience. I saw closure and thankfulness in his eyes. I saw no bitterness. Just pure joy. I admire the fact that Barry Switzer said what he said about how he ""handled"" Marcus. The ""Bootleggers Boy"" has always been straight in answering a question. It takes a real human being to be that human. And even though Marcus probably ""won't"" be part of the immediate daily on going discussion about footballs GOAT, hopefully a film like this will NOW grow his name and fact-filled legend. The cool thing is it seems Marcus could really care less because he knows he did things when healthy that no one else could or would do before, then or after. The proof is in Gods work of perfection and completeness. He knows he had something no one can teach nor could really take away. Over 300 college coaches were witnesses. And one preacher tried to steal his soul and sell it. But Marcus has had the last laugh against his Judas. Watch the film and just think, it was all for his young brother. Not money or fame. His soul is content.",1289347200,7,2116,4.556430446194225
4241516,5,B0040ZN9OA,"This is a great documentary for any sports fan! If only we could have seen what this amazing athlete could have (would have) accomplished had it not been for a few unfortunate twists of fate. I can't think of a more promising player in all of football--maybe in all of sports. I'd heard the name but vaguely knew the person. I'd seen him on a few highlight reels and heard how he was such a promising, yet controversial figure in Oklahoma football. But until seeing this film, I never realized such an extraordinary running-back ever existed. No doubt he would have been the Muhammad Ali or Michael Jordon of his sport. I'm sure there are many such stories, but thankfully the filmmaker (Jonathon Hock) presents it with unbiased humility and without the usual sugar-coating. It's neither a tragedy nor a fairytale...it's pure, it's touching, it's emotional, and it's a REAL SHAME! If only.................

8412488,5,B0040ZN9OA,"Filmmaker Jonathan Hook brings a compelling story to the esteemed 30-30 ESPN documentary series.  If you have heard of Marcus Dupree you probably just know he was, likely still to this day, the most sought after high school football recruit in the history of the sport.  If there was ever a more raw naturallyl talented, as well as physically big, running back to play football I'd like to know who that would be.  Perhaps, like me, you really didn't know his story at all to which this heartbreaking documentary corrects.  Dupree survived both himself and injury to ride again, albeit a short, but none the less reappearance in the sport.  His roots and ultimate post football life make for a very compelling story.  Highly recommended.",1473552000,,737,4.856
