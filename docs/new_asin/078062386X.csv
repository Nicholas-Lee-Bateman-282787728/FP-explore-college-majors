31376,5,078062386X,"This is a series that everyone must see.  It seems hard to believe that much of this took place 20 to 50 plus years ago.
Of great value is the narrative from people who lived through it on both sides of the  ""curtain"".  While the younger generations who did not live  through it may know of the Viet Nam conflict, I have to wonder how many  would know just how close we came to total devastation as a result of the  Cuban Missle Crisis?  Even those of us who lived at that time may now be  learning the horrendous truth.  If anything, this one episode is a must see  but the entire series is a must have.",954374400,2,604,4.085470085470085

31378,5,078062386X,"The Cold War was not just about the Iron Curtain in Europe or wars in Vietnam and Afghanistan.  The Cold War affected the evolution of human society, race relations, and democracy everywhere.  This series examines  both the military and social ""fall-out"" of the Cold War, not all  of which is now past us.  It is a compelling history told from many  perspectives about an era during which the human race nearly succeeded in  destroying itself.  My hat is off to Tedd Turner, CNN, and all those that  contributed to this project, for history recounted so accurately and  emotionally is far less likely to repeat.  (At least I hope so!)",911692800,3,634,4.724770642201835

7789536,5,078062386X,"I don't know what else to say. This was a fabulous series. Great music, interviews with most of the major players, visually impressive footage. It really puts the Cold War in context. It needs to be released on DVD for future generations.",1274659200,,238,4.690476190476191
7789537,5,078062386X,"The reviews say it all. The series is very comprehensive and well balanced, showing all aspects of the Cold War, with a lot of unique film material, telling interviews with witnesses and a competent commentary. An incredible amount of money, research and thought has been invested into this series, comprising 24 sequels. If only Warner Bros. or whoever now owns the rights would reissue this fantastic series on DVD! There's so much crap being reissued on DVD while this masterpiece lays buried in the archive. It's a shame! CNN, Warner Bros. or whoever it may concern - PLEASE MOVE!",1257897600,,584,4.909090909090909
7789538,5,078062386X,"This is a superb series that details the entire Cold War begining just after WWII through the Gorbachev years.

I remember watching it on cable almost a decade ago, and have been waiting for it to be released on DVD, but unfortunately it is only available on (useless) VHS.

Time-Warner, please release this on DVD!!!1",1146787200,6,318,4.763636363636364
7789539,5,078062386X,"I heard about the release when I was in Vietnam, about 1998. There's no way to order these kind of films or books in a Communist regime. I could only read the narrative of 20 episodes from CNN website. I bought the film as soon as I reached Singapore.

It's very objective to me, not a kind of propaganda. I could listen to A LOT of people from both sides of the battle line. Very vivid!

A must see documentary film!",1106697600,9,417,4.135802469135802
7789540,5,078062386X,"This 8-tape, 24-episode set is a fascinating video history of the Cold War. While providing a brief background of the rise of Communism in Russia, it focuses on the post-World War II era, from 1945 through the fall of the Berlin Wall and the democratization of the Warsaw Pact countries.  The series contains incredible footage of a divided Berlin.  The finest episode of this outstanding compendium, in fact, is devoted to the Berlin Wall.  The producers managed to get footage of persons in the act of escaping from East Berlin -- and being restrained by East German police.  I found it impossible to watch this episode without gasping!

Because the creators were given the time to do a thorough treatment of the subject, we are shown highlights of virtually every significant Cold War event.  From the Potsdam conference to the Berlin airlift; from repression in the USSR to MAD; from the Cuban missile crisis, through the Vietnam War, through Gorbachev's attempt to introduce ""glasnost"" and ""perestroika"" -- it's all here.  We even see footage from the war in Angola, which was never a top priority for the evening news.  And we are shown, often for the first time, footage shot from the Communist side of the war.  As with all series of this length, it is not perfect.  The treatment of the Sandinistas is far too sympathetic -- there was a reason they were voted out in the first free election; the cursory treatment of the Six Day War misstates certain facts and posits the war as simply another crisis between the superpowers; the episode on McCarthyism veers into moral equivalence of the United States and the Stalin-ruled USSR; the Vietnam War alone requires more in-depth treatment than that provided here.

But given the time and space alloted, the creators have put together the definitive video history of the Cold War. Watch it to see an always-engrossing, never-boring history of this conflict.  From there, you will certainly be inspired to read more about the different facets of the Cold War.  The videos are expensive, but well worth the money.  This is a set you will treasure.",1105401600,13,2099,4.859550561797753
7789541,5,078062386X,"I did not hesitate when purchasing this title and everyone around me did enjoy watching all the 8 tapes continuously. I really would recommend to get this title while it is still available! The recent history of the world has been decided by the two super powers and the decisive role was played by the USA and if anyone still doubts it, he/she should watch this fabulously made movie. ....",970531200,7,390,4.585714285714285
7789542,5,078062386X,"I have experienced 15 years of life in east side of the Iron Curtain. Just want to say I really love this picture as I have found it objective enough, disclosing many interesting and important points in West-East diplomacy  which were really hard to understand for me so far. Wish all the people  watch it as we all could learn more of many mistakes have been done. None  is holly - the comunists are unhuman by principal but the americans did  many stupid thinks also. This movie shows you a lot of hidden, shadow  politics of the era of Cold War. Enjoy it.",958435200,6,558,4.378640776699029
7789543,5,078062386X,"This is an outstanding series!  As a member of the Defense Nuclear Weapons School in Albuquerque New Mexico, I recommend this excellent look at our history to middle, high schools and universities around the country.  Perhaps around the world.  I believe with the age of some of the experts  and people that were alive during this time fading; we must ensure that  this information is past on to generations to come.  Ensuring we do not  repeat the errors and apply the lessons learned as we move through the 21st  century.",955929600,12,523,4.733333333333333
