8600931,5,B00003O02V,"Michael McClure is a gifted poet, and Ray Manzarek  is a talented and accomplished musician, who seems to get the music ""just right"" for the poem McClure is performing.  However, it's not just their respective talents, but their obvious enjoyment in working together that really makes this film such a pleasure to watch.

Although I saw no reason to subtract a star from my rating, I do have one objection to the description of the film.  There IS some footage of Jim Morrison performing with The Doors, and an interview that was presented on PBS, but there is NO footage of Morrison reading his poetry.  I'm not sure why that claim is on the tape box, because it's just not there.

With that said, I highly recommend this tape or DVD for anyone interested in good poetry accompanied by some fine music.",1177113600,,803,4.619718309859155
8600932,5,B00003O02V,"This film is for anyone interested in the beat poets and poetry in general. It inspired me to learn more about the beats and that whole era.  Manzarek music is great, continuing his brilliant work from the Doors.  Mcclure's words and Manzaerk's music go great together.  Anyone who's a fan  of the Doors and a fan of great poetry should see this film.",950140800,2,351,4.523809523809524
