The Etoiles, of course, shine above the rest of the ensemble, but yet, the chorus and soloists are a real pleasure to watch.  All together, this DVD is a sublime experience.",1405641600,,402,5.265625
8147771,4,B000IY06A2,"The reviewers before me have done a splendid job so I will add what I think will maybe additionally helpful:
First of all do buy this DVD as it features dances that are fairly rare and also superbly produced (POB after all).
The Le Jeuene Homme is what I would call a likable modern ballet: The setting is modern but the dancing is classical and so is the music. Note that the theme itself is macabre, featuring suicide. However just like a Dostoevsky work the execution is still finally a celebration of proper human values even if the theme is dark. The virtuosity of Nicholas is extraordinary. There is a moment when he is horizontal in mid air which is a consummation of ballet technique to show sheer spirit through sheer material human effort. This ballet is short and the end is disturbing but nevertheless a treasure to be repeatedly enjoyed.
I know of only 2 productions of Carmen: The one with Baryshnikov (ABT?) and this one. This one is much better - better dancing, better production. Interestingly the interpretation is similar.
All classical ballet lovers should also like this dance.",1207094400,6,1099,4.7591623036649215
8147772,4,B000IY06A2,"This is an excellent presentation, although I am far more impressed with LE JEUNE HOMME than CARMEN, which takes up most of the latter two thirds.
The ballet language is very much the same, but it is much more suited for the contemporary (even though done in 1946) existential story of LE JEUNE HOMME. Also, the marvelous Nicolas le Riche is far better used in LE JEUNE. Here the combination of classical technique and pure athleticism is exciting viewing. The first is thrilling; CARMEN drags. Even so, I think this is a valuable item for a dance lover's collection",1182816000,4,566,4.7272727272727275
