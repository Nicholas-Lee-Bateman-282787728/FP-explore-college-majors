7995324,5,B0000A1M5F,"My three year old has loved Pingu since she was 1.

It is nice because there are no words, just gestures

and a type of gibberish that appeals to toddlers (and me.)

It has a European feeling, and some European values in it

that aren't ""Politically Correct"" in the U.S. like spanking

for misbehavior, but I really think she enjoys the simple

claymation of Pingu and his family and friends.  I know

I do.",1172361600,,407,4.405405405405405

7995326,4,B0000A1M5F,"We loved the two Pingus you can buy for American Region 1 DVD  players (""Meet Pingu"" and ""Chillin' With Pingu""), so, in addition to other reasons, we bought a Region Free DVD player and ordered this Region 2 one. We wanted to get exposure to what all the European kids (and kids whose parents subscribe to cable tv with the Sprout channel apparently) can get too.  But, oh no, Pingu has been updated! This DVD is computerized animation instead of the charming old fashioned claymation.  The music is more computerized and ""zingy"" sounding and rock and rolly. It's not as charming as the accordion music, in my opinion. My 2 year old daughter is still quite mesmerized by it, but for all of you feeling deprived because you can only get the two older DVDs, it's ok, you have the better ones, I think.  Pingu is still better than almost anything else out there for a 2 year old, I think.",1158105600,8,885,4.478260869565218
