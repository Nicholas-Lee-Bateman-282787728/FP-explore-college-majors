8628248,5,B00GX33JG0,"Great independent feature. The Guide was built around a small cast, no wild effects, and no costly sets or props. The characters and location are the backbone that holds up the story, which was full of twist that you would never anticipate. The fantastic acting by Don Scribner is a given, while everyone else in the small cast was pretty solid also. I especially liked the young lady at the convenience store because she really fit the role and she behaved as should be expected in the situation.

At first some of the flash back sequences could be confusing (why is that happening?), but later on it all fits together and you understand why that was done. Shooting in all-white snow locations is not easy. Without proper lighting, settings, and a skilled cinematographer, the white can easily blow out in the camera and be too blinding to the eye. No such thing here. Wonderful visuals and a few really great establishing shots.

There are no boring side explorations going on, the pace of the movie is perfect and we are on one journey that, as we get to know the characters, is not side tracking us down different avenues. My wife wanted to see wider angles, as much of the film is shot very tight on the characters, but I accepted it as being very much the style of the film and once the story was established and I was focused on what was going on, what would happen next, etc., I appreciated the way the camera was often in tight on everyone. Particularly in the case of Don, his expressions are vital to establishing what is going on inside his character's head. Editing all the pieces together was done well and the simple solo guitar background score was as basic as were the titles and credits. Nothing needed there beyond what there was. Simple, clean, and direct.

Don's incredible ability to get into a role so deeply that the character's emotions ooze out of him was evident in this film, as is usually the case in anything I've seen him do before. Again, those emotions drive The Guide and are really what was the winning ingredient to this film, at least to me.

I definitely recommend this, but when you watch it make sure you don't have distractions going on. You need to have the same story focus that the filmmakers had in the way that they presented it. Pay attention to Don's character, and what he is feeling, expressing, and going through.",1393718400,5,2364,4.568396226415095
8628249,4,B00GX33JG0,"""You made a big mistake by messing with the wrong guy and the wrong guys daughter."" Joe (Scribner) once again visits his daughter trying to get her to move back home. She has never forgiven him for not being there when her mother suddenly died. During the argument her boyfriend shows up angry because she stole and lost $8,000 worth of drugs. Joe starts to think of ways to help her when he receives a call from the two hunters he is supposed to act as a guide for. Wanting to turn them down he changes his mind when they offer him $10,000 plus more if the trophy is a certain size. Little be little Joe begins to lose his sanity which affects everyone involved. This is a perfect example of a movie that isn't really anything like the trailer makes it seem. In this case that is a good thing. I went in expecting a slow moving and almost boring movie so I had pretty low expectations. The movie opens with the argument between the daughter and father and quickly turns tense. When the two hunters arrive the movie begins to be told in flashbacks, what's in Joe's mind and what is daughter is currently doing. The constant switching works and really keep you on your toes and interested the entire time. This is not a real fast moving movie but it does stay tense and really sucks you in. I'm not sure if it was my low expectations or not but I really did end up liking this much more then I expected to. Overall, tense and riveting. Keeps you feeling uneasy and unsure of what is happening. You are never sure what is real and what is happening in Joe's head, that really helps the tenseness of the movie. I surprisingly give this a B+.",1393113600,4,1638,4.321428571428571
