Always has him singing and dancing and lots of laughs.",1263600000,,299,3.8688524590163933

3949437,5,B002LYD2LM,"If you already have the out of print 1st 3 seasons, then this is a must buy. It's packaged in a conventional flip-panel DVD case instead of the book-style case of the other seasons & doesn't have the bonus inserts, but that's OK - it still looks great displayed next to Season 3.

If you don't already have the 1st 3 seasons, then you're better off getting the new full series box set. Eash season is individually packaged in the same type of case as this Season 4 release, and held together in a cardboard display box. Makes a great gift for anyone with kids, or for anyone who was a kid in the 80s.",1261785600,,600,4.217391304347826

3949439,4,B002LYD2LM,"For those eagerly awaiting for the release of the final season of the Fraggles that never came, this is a wish come true: Episodes are as great as ever, DVD transfer at the same quality as the previous releases, closed-captioned as always, and one disc of extras.
Where this release loses the fifth star, is packaging:
Forget the embossed cover, the nice touch of the materials the previous releases had, and, most important, the goodies that awaited you in the inner sleeve of those releases. (You can forget the inner sleeve also)
Instead, imagine a standard DVD plastic case, then make it thicker, so than it can hold five DVDs in there, and that's about it. Not even a leaflet with the titles of the episodes! (so forget the summaries too)
What you must NOT forget, however, is that the previous company did NOT release this at ALL, so, better than nothing, I guess, although definately not a strong collector's item...
The choice, as always, is yours!",1260057600,9,956,4.730538922155689
3949440,4,B002LYD2LM,"So Hit Entertainment finally listened. . . Sort of. We got the final season by itself, but the packaging is sh---y and it doesnt have any of the cool inserts that the others do. Worth the 19.99 I paid for it, but not the 29.99 it's MSRP'd at.",1259452800,2,242,4.0625
3949441,5,B002LYD2LM,"Love the show hands down! But the packaging was a disappointment. I have the first three seasons and have waited a long time for the final season to be released. I was hoping that the packaging would be the same as the previous 3 but it was not. To be honest I would have paid extra money to have the ""extras"" that were included in the other seasons. Such as the booklet and the unique way that the others were put together not some plastic case like this one. But all in all the show is what really matters and I am pleased with that.",1257638400,14,535,4.104761904761904
3949442,4,B002LYD2LM,"I am thrilled that they finally released the final season. The packaging is not like the previous seasons. Bare bones packaging but at least the discs have what we want on them, Fraggles!",1257206400,3,187,4.696969696969697
3949443,5,B002LYD2LM,"This long-awaited collection finally arrives on DVD November 3, 2009! All 24 episodes of the fourth and final season are included in this set, along with nearly two hours of bonus features (the same ones included in last year's Complete Series set released by the Jim Henson Company, HIT Entertainment and Lionsgate).

Some of the most touching, sincere and sentimental episodes are found within the final season of this legendary television experience, including a giant wrap-up taking place over the last three. Perfection is the only suitable word. Everything that IS Fraggle Rock is on prominent display over these ninety minutes, forming one of the most beautiful conclusions to any show in the history of the medium.

Many other episodes demonstrate the Henson team at what is probably the highest point of artistic expression the company has ever known, delivering heartfelt storytelling magic in shows including ""Uncle Matt's Discovery,"" ""The Perfect Blue Rollie,"" ""Wembley's Flight,"" ""The Voice Inside,"" ""A Tune for Two,"" ""The River of Life"" and ""Gone But Not Forgotten."" Those last three deal with racism, pollution/environmental awareness and death, respectively, in charming fashion unique to the series; however they, in particular, must be seen to be truly believed.

*Like the previous three season sets, Season 4's bonus material is simply outstanding. Everything you would hope to see and hear about the final season is delivered by familiar faces in a typically wonderful and extensive manner. Close to thirty minutes is spent covering the episodes themselves, with the best of the season (listed above) nearly all discussed by each corresponding writer. Featured are staples Jocelyn Stevenson, Lawrence Mirkin and Jerry Juhl (archival footage), as well as the returning David Young (""The Perfect Blue Rollie,"" ""The River of Life"") and newcomer Laura Phillips (""A Tune for Two,"" ""Gone But Not Forgotten"").

The list of remaining bonus features are as follows, with the last four alone worth the price of admission:

- The Inner Gorg: interviews body performers Trish Leeper (Ma Gorg), Gord Robertson (Pa Gorg) and Rob Mills (Junior Gorg).

- Designing the Puppets: interviews builders Rollie Krewson and Tim Miller.

- Directing the Fraggles: interviews directors Eric Till and George Bloomfield.

- Let the Music Play: Philip Balsam and Dennis Lee, interviewed together for the first time on DVD, give a first-hand recollection of what it was like to produce two or three unforgettable songs each week.

- Dance Your Cares Away: Philip Balsam discusses the evolution of the theme song. Nearly ten minutes of unused themes are seen and heard here.

- You Cannot Leave the Magic: rare, incredible footage from the last day of shooting.

- Celebrating Fraggle Rock: rare, incredible footage from the show's wrap party.

Simply put, the show speaks for itself. Now that the Henson Company has unloaded HIT, who blatantly failed to release this remaining installment last year, they are finally able to give their top property the home video sendoff it rightly deserves. As most people buying this set already know, there is nothing like Fraggle Rock. For those revisiting these last episodes: it's as good as you dare remember. For those who know the show but haven't seen this season: the best is yet to come.

3949485,5,B002LYD2LM,"I enjoyed this episode, because it finally brought the peace that I had hopped to see between these two sets of characters. The Gorgs were never evil, they were just living their lives. It's like how humans react to mice, with traps and fear and anger, but if one started talking to you, you'd probably listen to reason. The whole adventure really put the big lesson, hinted at throughout the series, into light. That all living things, no matter the size, are all part of this big crazy thing we call life, and depend on each other in ways we may not even fully-comprehend.",1393200000,,574,4.528846153846154

3949494,5,B002LYD2LM,"Fraggle Rock at 6:30 PM on HBO was a must watch for me.

The finial series closes out with two of the best episodes of any TV show ever, and it's worth the cost for just them.  Just a great message and story for everyone.

If you've never seen it, pick this up for sure.  You can not leave the magic.",1368316800,,300,3.8688524590163933
3949495,3,B002LYD2LM,"This was a fitting farewell to the series, I love the final two episodes, ""The Honk of Honks"" and ""Change of Address"" since Doc finally got to meet Gobo and the Fraggles.  I love the ending song for the final episode ""Magic be with you"" (I think that's what it's called, I'm not sure of the official title) and the slightly altered version of the ""Fraggle Rock theme"".  The special features are great too.  I love the behind the scenes feature on the last days of shooting and well as the Fraggle Rock wrap party.  The featurette on the creation of the Fraggle Rock theme is also really good, it's interesting to see/hear what the Fraggle Rock theme could have sounded like had they chosen one of the other versions.

That was the good part, now for the bad.  Ordinarily I'd have given this set 5 out of 5 like I did Seasons two and three but it looses 2 stars for the defect on disc 1.  The episodes ""Uncle Matt's Discovery"", ""Junior Gorg Faces the Music"" and ""The perfect Blue Rollie"" would all freeze and skip randomly on my machine and I couldn't even stop them.  The ""stop"" feature also wouldn't work on the main menu.  The only way I could stop was to eject the disc.  I got a refund and then bought a replacement copy.  The replacement copy however, had the exact same problems with those exact same episodes, so it wasn't just one defective disc.  I suspect it may be a problem with the manufacturing or the original files that were burned on the discs.  I also know it's not my DVD player since I tried both sets on my brother's DVD player and he had the exact same problems with these same episodes, not to mention none of my other DVD's gave me these problems.

All in all I would ordinarily recommend this set but with two different copies having the same defect I'm hesitant to do so; since I find it hard to believe both sets having the same defect could simply be a coincidence.  With the 30th anniversary of Fraggle Rock coming up I would probably recommend waiting to see if they release a new set and getting that one instead.",1367712000,,2044,4.37037037037037
3949496,5,B002LYD2LM,"My husband and I purchased the entire Fraggle Rock series for our baby due later this year.  A bit soon we know.  After comparing the reviews on Amazon, we decided not to order the complete DVD set and instead purchased each season separately.  I read there were complaints by other customers with packaging and missing/differing content on the ""complete"" set.  I did not have any of these issues when the packages arrived.  The DVD's were in great condition with no signs of scratching or wear.  The content of the videos was what we expected.  Great show for kids.  Some things are better left in the past but this show does not disappoint.  We love our purchase.",1358985600,,665,4.663793103448276

3949505,5,B002LYD2LM,"Recently, I was clearing my parents house out and found a box of old toys, including a bunch of Fraggle dolls that I had as a kid. When I mentioned this to my sister, she said she heard that Fraggles were making a comeback with a new movie coming out. Sure enough, when I checked Amazon, the complete series was available. It was such a joy to see this again. This is a great show for kids (or nostalgic adults). The puppetry is great. The show is very musical, but the songs (by and large) aren't corny or annoying. Some of them are actually a bit tender. The episodes often deal with themes like prejudice and the environment.

That being said, I'd recommend getting the newer&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fraggle-Rock-Complete-Series-Collection/dp/B002LYD2LW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fraggle Rock: Complete Series Collection</a>&nbsp;DVD set.

3949506,3,B002LYD2LM,"Jim Henson would be sad that they sold out on him like this.  I doubt I'm alone among the people that bought each of the first three seasons of this show, only to be disappointed that they turn around and sell a complete series set alongside the final season, and that the complete set only costs marginally more than one of the individual seasons (and that's not even counting the fact that the seasons were a bit more expensive when they first released).

The reviews from other people saying that there are no extras and the packaging doesn't compare to the previous seasons just goes to show that corporate greed can ruin even your fondest childhood memories.  Now I'm stuck with the decision to buy this last season, or buy the complete set and give away the first three season sets.",1277337600,,788,4.574468085106383
3949507,3,B002LYD2LM,"I bought this from a recommended seller through Amazon and when I opened the box it was shipped in, I thought I got ripped off with a Chinese aftermarket item.  I own the first 3 seasons and the box sets are made with high quality materials that seemed aimed for collector's or to those who like quality in a dvd box set.

This season, being the last season, I expected the same.

Instead it is a cheap plastic hard cover box that looks like a cheap import and not a quality USA made product.  To make quality box sets with extras for 3 seasons and then take a short cut on the 4th and final season of a show is beyond me.  Whether made by one or several companies/studios or one, the quality should be the same throughout the entire show series.  When I opened this, I was shocked at the cheapness and was upset in thinking it was not the real product I ordered... that is until I went back on Amazon and read other reviews and saw this was indeed the authentic final season, but made cheaply.  It is 5 discs in a clamshell.  That is it, nothing else.  I have not watched the shows yet....almost afraid to - LOL. In reading other reviews, the quality is slightly less than the other seasons, but cannot say for sure.  All and all, if you want the full series, this is a must have.  Jim Hensen I think would have something to say on this if he were alive today.  He was one for quality through and through.",1276992000,,1406,4.205223880597015
3949508,5,B002LYD2LM,"I've been waiting for this final season for quite awhile. Glad to have it.
Being a long time Henson fan, I was excited when the final installment was released through Lionsgate. I didn't want to sell my other sets, just to be able to afford the 'complete collection' that was released by HIT  in place of the final season.  I loved the artwork and tid bits that came with those previous seasons.
This extra content on this is wonderful, the only thing not included is any artwork or similar.

3949511,3,B002LYD2LM,"Well I need to make a caveat right off the bat here.  I love Fraggle Rock.  I was thrilled to see that finally the last of the seasons and all the episodes where finally out.  I bought the first three seasons as each came out and was nothing less then impressed with the quality of the Discs, packaging and extras that came with them.  This final release to the set is a complete let down.

The image quality looks to me to be lessened, as if they did poor transfers.  The discs aren't unviewable or anything like that, but their is a lot lost on this version over the previous parts of this set.  Also the box that this comes in is not in the original style of the three earlier ones.  There is no included anything extra in the packaging that we got with the three previous releases.  It's just a four disc plastic carrier that's used for any multidisc pack.  Their is nothing special about this.  It's an abrupt and unflattering end to what was a great set.  Hence my low marks all though I'll love watching the episodes for years to come.",1265155200,2,1042,4.287179487179487
3949512,5,B002LYD2LM,"Excellent and sad closing for a series that ended too soon. A great show Full of songs and lessons from the mind of Jim Henson. Dealing with the issue of loss near the end of the series probably mirroring the loss of Henson at the time is done simplistic enough to get the point across, but also done in a way that doesn't belittle the tragedy of it. A somber ending to the series, but for fans of the show, well worth the view.",1264982400,,428,4.107142857142857
