8390950,2,B002997SIM,"I got this DVD and was not that impressed.  The work out was slow and boring and was practically sitting doing very limited and small stretches and was not like the yoga i'm used to at all.  Granted, I only did the third trimester one, but this was enough to put me off.  I have been much more impressed with Shiva Rea or Jennifer Wolfes yoga which provides stretch and excercise.",1252540800,,380,4.323943661971831
