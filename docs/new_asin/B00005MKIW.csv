7945808,5,B00005MKIW,It had scenes that were new to me.  It was exciting and fast-paced.  Footage was realistic even though it was black and white in many places.,1379462400,,141,4.384615384615385
7945809,2,B00005MKIW,"I expected from Readers Digest some clear images digitaly done as mentioned on their cover , but in effect especially Pearl Harbour is a

very poor example of quality footage . To be honest their are two discs

and I have only viewed part One , and I am in no hurry to look at Part Two . I have seen enough of very soft images and running scratches to

do me for quite some time . I respect greatly what the American Service

Men and civilians had to do during the war , and the sacrafices involved .

If you are going to tell their story , they deserve much better than this .",1161820800,2,577,3.982608695652174
