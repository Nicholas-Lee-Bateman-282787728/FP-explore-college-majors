8375199,4,B002NNY8AK,"Item arrived in a timely manner & in good condition. I am still reviewing the DVDs in the First Volume Box Set. This Korean Drama series from KBS America is a very educational one from a historic viewpoint, as well as being entertaining. I cannot wait to start reviewing the Second Volume of DVDs later on; once I am done watching the Volume One DVD Box Set. Many thanks! Keep up the good work!",1411603200,,394,4.337837837837838
8375200,5,B002NNY8AK,"Condensed version of what I consider to be one of the best Korean Dramas made? If you like Historical Korean darmas, you'll love this one",1379203200,2,137,4.52
8375201,3,B002NNY8AK,"I was very excited when I got this item, and very happy when I got it too. And I absolutely love the show. I first watched it when I Was in an elementary school, and I managed to get into college with an essay I wrote about the main character. But the box set mixes many episodes into one ""episode"", and cuts out uncountable amount of scenes and episodes. When I got it and watched through the drama, I was definitely happy to have found it. But I was also very disappointed that there were so many scenes missing that also had historical importance.",1360454400,,550,4.298076923076923
8375202,5,B002NNY8AK,"This 33 episode set is an abbreviated compilation from the original 103 or 104 episodes produced by KBS Media in Korea.  It is a long but exciting epic.  I watched this 33 episode version several times and finally ordered the full series from KBS Media.  I would recommend it and if you enjoy it as much as I do, you can then pursue the original series.  Based on what is known about the Admiral, you can read more about him at:

HANBOOKS has reprints of his diaries.  The video in this series is very very good as is the audio.  A real treat for western viewers.",1301702400,4,570,4.261682242990654
8375203,4,B002NNY8AK,"It's definitley not the whole, full drawn out original version but a condense version of the original drama.
But decided it keep it since my dad loves this drama and impossible to come by.
All and all 'OK'.

Have to admit it definitely is a well made korean historical drama.",1289952000,5,275,4.5
8375204,5,B002NNY8AK,"Truly a riveting drama of the greatest warrior and tactician naval commander of Chosun (Korea) especially noted for his victories against the Japanese navy during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592-1598). Plenty of action amid the drama of having to overcome the narrow minded beliefs and traditions of those jealous of his achievements and his love for the people and his country. Beautifully filmed and well acted, that you can't help but intimately connect with the characters and situations.",1284336000,8,498,5.3164556962025316
8375205,5,B002NNY8AK,"This now rare series is an outstanding production, one of the best I've ever seen.  It has depth in personal and cultural dynamics.  This 12-disk set is the ""short series"", a 33 episode condensation of the 104 episode full series.  I am  confident that anyone who sees this historical drama will quickly become addicted to it.",1267488000,8,326,4.767857142857143
