I don't want my kid to be confused because in the family we pronounce the same words correctly. The stress and accent and the vowels are all a little funky. I guess if you want your kid to speak the equivalent of an obscure ancient dialect you will be fine.",1455408000,,383,4.260273972602739

8381314,5,B002UNHFZI,"From the award winning flim maker, mom and daughter of the internationally acclaimed language teaching pioneers, Dr. Paul Pimsleur and Julia Pimsleur, comes learning languages for little children ages 0-5.  The Little Pim fun with languages DVD's come in a 3-pack set which includes eating and drinking, wake up smiling and playtime.  This amazing instructional dvd is the recipient of over 25 awards and has been featured on many TV shows.  If you don't want to use dvd's then purchase the iPad version at the App store.  The Little Pim language series comes in 11 languages including: Spanish, Chinese, German, Italian, Hebrew, Russian, French, English, Japanese, Arabic and Portuguese.

I recently introduced my child to the Italian language through the Little Pim series and was amazed at how interactive the series is.  A little Panda, and who doesn't love a Panda, is the series teacher who will laugh, play and guide your child through the basic building blocks for learning a second or third language.  This is fun even for the whole family.

Each dvd introduces 60 new words and phrases with on-screen phonetic pronunciation and optional subtitles to help parents, plus a Parent Guide with helpful tips.  This is the perfect tool to use to immerse your child in a new language at the perfect age.",1388361600,,1305,4.976958525345622
