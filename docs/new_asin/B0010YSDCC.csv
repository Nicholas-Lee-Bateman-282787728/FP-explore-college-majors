3055685,4,B0010YSDCC,I watch this because of the musical Evita. You just don't feel a woman so loved by her country would be so evil as depicted in the musical. This documentary would give you a more balanced insight into her life.,1373760000,3,210,4.275

3055687,4,B0010YSDCC,"""The Mystery of Eva Peron"" is a detailed account of Eva Peron's life history and also goes into the mysteries surrounding her embalmed corpse. This classic documentary was originally released in Argentina back in the late 80's and has been re-issued, uncut. For those who are interested in purchasing or viewing this item, please bear in mind that it is in Spanish (with English subtitles) but it's definitely worthy of checking out if you are an Evita fan, a historian or just want to enlighten yourself on the subject matter. It is lengthy (well over an hour and a half) featuring a tremendous amount of photographs, newsreel footage and information pertaining to the enigmatic first lady, her husband and their controversial movement. This film is especially interesting because of the numerous witness testimony from people who were actually there during the first Peronist period and who had direct, personal involvement with Eva and/or were a close friend. Some of their accounts are clearly laced with admiration and passion (especially the testimony of Eva Peron's personal confessor, Father Hernan Benitez who has since passed away like many others featured here) which just demonstrates the fierce loyalty and dedication this woman inspired in her devoted colleagues. Even Cipriano Reyes, who fell from the Peron's good graces and was used as a scapegoat as one of the masterminds of a Peron assassination plot, admitted that to deny Eva's charitable works, is like ""clipping the wings"" of a bird mid-flight.

My one of only a few complaints lies with the story's execution. The documentary switches back and fourth between Eva's life to the many escapades experienced by her mummified body. All of this back and fourth does become a bit grating but considering the tremendous amount of very interesting information that the film-makers are throwing at us, I guess it's a small price to pay. The newsreel footage used, for the most part, is good. It mixes the usual footage used in many other documentaries in with some rarities. I just wished they would have shown footage of Evita's film career: ""La Carga de los Valientes"", ""La Cabalgata del Circo"" and most importantly ""La Prodiga"" her final picture . I have an old used copy of this documentary on VHS and I noticed that in several sections, the footage was cleaned up quite a bit and my VHS copy was heavily edited by at least 15 minutes. There is also a tremendous assortment of photographs used but just like the newsreel footage, in some instances, they are unsatisfactorily produced with unsightly scratches but in other cases, they are immaculate and several rare pictures are reproduced. I was especially delighted to see many of Eva Duarte's artistic photos featuring her on the cover of many showbiz magazines, advertisements and some ""cheesecake"" shots are thrown in as well. The photos show a thin, pretty brunette who reinvents herself into a blonde with cascading curls who reinvents herself yet again into the iconic Evita of the braided chignon and tailor made business suits. The physical transformation is stunning but even more poignant is the beating Eva's beauty took from cancer. Photographs and newsreel footage show the charismatic beauty wither away into a gaunt, sickly, sad, physically weak woman (at times she had to be held up by her husband) who weighed a miserable 80 pounds (or less according to many) in the last stage of her life. Like all documentaries of Evita, her dramatic fall from power, the harsh criticisms geared towards her, her battle with cancer and the gross mismanagement of her corpse is talked about in detail.

For those who have not seen this and are interested in the subject matter, ""The Mystery of Eva Peron"" should not disappoint. Unlike other documentaries which run no more than 60 minutes in length (too short a time to fully tell Evita's story), this documentary is lengthy, well researched, engrossing and is one of the few that actually showcases the many people who personally dealt with her. Combine this with hundreds of photographs (many quite striking), actual recordings of Eva's speeches, and interesting documentary footage, Eva's story is told like no other documentary in existence. The DVD also has a few movie trailers and a brief and disappointing photo gallery. Considering the tremendous amount of photographs that have been released of Eva recently which have made their way in to photo books like ""EVITA: Imagenes de Coleccion"" and ""Evita en Fotos"" by Felipe Pigna, there is no excuse for having such a sub-standard photo gallery. But this is a minor complaint of an overall enthralling documentary on the life of one of the most fascinating woman of modern history.",1207008000,22,4709,5.028169014084507

She herself shrived for popularity in the hopes of her becoming Vice President of Argentina but the movement failed. She also wanted to be referred to as a Saint, but with her rumored past being a prostitute, was not overlooked.. The whole documentary/movie has all spoken dialogue in Spanish, however the English subtitles help to find out what is being said. A decent documentary if you don't mind the subtitles and some of the gushy admiration for her. Her husband, Juan Peron influenced her political beliefs so they together were Nazi sympathizers.

3055738,4,B0010YSDCC,"Eva Peron is described in the movie as Argentina's spiritual leader . She is the mediatrix between the people and the all-powerful one one - Juan Peron. She urges the people to totally devote themselves to the all-powerful one . She herself only wants to serve the people and to serve the powerful one. Anyone who opposes Peron she says is an enemy of the people . She is the champion of the poor who come to her for succor. She called the poor supporters ""the shirtless ones."" She said the loyalty of the of the poor will always be there. And you will always have the poor.

 She was hated by the rich and powerful oligarchy who saw her as inferior to them . The movie said she never had sex with her husband. Does that mean perpetual virginity like Mary in Catholic belief She dressed like the queen, in many eyes, the Queen of Heaven . No one could lay a hand on her .

 She even died at 33 years old and at the top of her game , just like Jesus .  For the longest time the people did not know where her body was .

 She filled the roles of Mary the mother of Jesus and in some ways of Jesus himself . In a Catholic country it is easy to see the adoration of her. I can't say whether or not she intentionally appropriated the parallels between herself and Jesus and his mother but those parallels nevertheless served her  and Juan Peron greatly. She was Argentina's 'Saint' even welcomed by the pope himself . Jesus fed the 5000 but she fed millions with Argentine meat and wheat, especially in Spain.

 The criticisms of the other reviewers are all pretty on target and I have no contradiction . However, I greatly enjoyed the movie in light of her spiritual role for Argentina . I would think that those with a strong Catholic background would find the movie especially interesting in light of the parallels between herself and Mary. Evita is Madonna.",1439078400,3,1856,4.338150289017341

3290235,4,B0010YSDCC,"Eva Peron is described in the movie as Argentina's spiritual leader . She is the mediatrix between the people and the all-powerful one one - Juan Peron. She urges the people to totally devote themselves to the all-powerful one . She herself only wants to serve the people and to serve the powerful one. Anyone who opposes Peron she says is an enemy of the people . She is the champion of the poor who come to her for succor. She called the poor supporters ""the shirtless ones."" She said the loyalty of the of the poor will always be there. And you will always have the poor.

 She was hated by the rich and powerful oligarchy who saw her as inferior to them . The movie said she never had sex with her husband. Does that mean perpetual virginity like Mary in Catholic belief She dressed like the queen, in many eyes, the Queen of Heaven . No one could lay a hand on her .

 She even died at 33 years old and at the top of her game , just like Jesus .  For the longest time the people did not know where her body was .

 She filled the roles of Mary the mother of Jesus and in some ways of Jesus himself . In a Catholic country it is easy to see the adoration of her. I can't say whether or not she intentionally appropriated the parallels between herself and Jesus and his mother but those parallels nevertheless served her  and Juan Peron greatly. She was Argentina's 'Saint' even welcomed by the pope himself . Jesus fed the 5000 but she fed millions with Argentine meat and wheat, especially in Spain.

 The criticisms of the other reviewers are all pretty on target and I have no contradiction . However, I greatly enjoyed the movie in light of her spiritual role for Argentina . I would think that those with a strong Catholic background would find the movie especially interesting in light of the parallels between herself and Mary. Evita is Madonna.",1439078400,3,1856,4.338150289017341

8239475,3,B0010YSDCC,"This is a mediocre black and white documentary, as it was simply not very well done. I was interested in viewing it, however, as a  few month ago I had been to Buenos Aires, where I had visited an Eva Peron museum. I confess that I found her to be an intriguing public figure. So, I wanted to know more about her, as well as more about the saga of her remains and the mystery surrounding them.

Before viewing  this documentary, one should know that it is entirely in Spanish. Lucky for me that I am proficient in the language, as the English subtitles were quite difficult to read. The quality of  the film print is also quite poor. On top of that, there were out of time sequences that were awkward at best and made little sense. One sequence had to do with the whereabouts and final resting place of Evita's  remains. The other had to do with her life, where she went from being a poor, would be actress, to being the most influential, powerful, and iconic woman in the history of Argentina. The story swings back and forth between these two sequences with no apparent rhyme or reason.

The good thing about this documentary is that it contains much archival footage and a number of recordings of her speeches to the public. There are also interviews with people who knew her.  I could see why the Argentine nation was in her thrall, as she was a galvanizing  public speaker, speaking with the enthusiasm and cadence of a powerful preacher. At the same, she was lovely to look at. There was also a strange dichotomy between her socialist beliefs and work on behalf of the poor and her penchant for wearing expensive clothes and a fortune in jewelry.

This is a documentary that may have limited appeal, but those with an interest in Eva Peron will derive a modicum of enjoyment from viewing it.",1464220800,,1797,4.487730061349693
