TWO OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES I WATCH OVER AND OVER AGAIN. IF YOUR LOOKING FOR HIGH BUDGET, BIG STARS,GREAT QUALITY AND AWESOME SOUND EFFECTS,THIS DVD IS NOT FOR YOU, BUT IF YOUR LOOKING FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT, LIKE A BLAST FROM THE PAST B HORROR CREEPY CLASSIS,THEN THIS IS FOR YOU.A MUST FOR A HORROR MOVIE COLLECTOR.",1075075200,9,504,4.674157303370786
1410040,1,B00005A07V,"This movie is a let down all the way around. I am a huge fan of old horror movies, but I cannot find one good thing to say about this one. The print I attained on DVD is horrible. The picture is choppy, out of frame, shows it's age, and the sound is muffled and very low. As to the content, the movie drags all the way through, the effects were very poor, and the acting was worse than plan 9 from outer space. I thought they could have done much more with the plot, but chose a cheap route, even for 1958. To me, it isn't even worth watching for laughs. Should be a dollar store special, but even they have better movies!",1062720000,,622,4.024193548387097
1410041,4,B00005A07V,"I first discovered ""The Screaming Skull"" while watching Mystery Science Theater 3000. I immediately thought the film seemed interesting, so when the chance arose to purchase the film, I took advantage of the opportunity.
""The Screaming Skull"" is about a newlywed couple who come to live in an old vacant house that is owned by the husband after his previous wife mysteriously died. At night a skull haunts the wife all throughout the house. Convinced it's her husband's dead wife trying to scare her, she is viewed as crazy - she had already spent some time in a mental hospital after witnessing the drowning of her parents.
Although the budget is low and the film seems to drag at times, it's good for the fact that it really tried to build suspense and give the audience an interesting story to follow. There are a few twists in the movie that you may figure out early on, but that's the fun of the movie. You also have to laugh at the fact that at the beginning of the movie, the producers announce that they will provide free burial services to those who die of fright while watching ""The Screaming Skull"".
I would definitely recommend this film to people who love old horror B-movies. This is one the few that will leave you thoroughly entertained!",1052956800,20,1253,4.623318385650224
1410042,1,B00005A07V,"I just thought you would like to know that ""The Screaming Skull"" is a movie that has made an appearance on Mystery Science Theater 3000, so if you're looking for a movie of that caliber you will enjoy this one; however, you might as well buy the MST3K edition and get the humerous commentary that accompanies it.  If you're looking for a ""classic"" horror film I would suggest that you keep searching.",1048204800,2,400,4.555555555555555
1410043,4,B00005A07V,"You know, I like this little shocker and don't understand why there isn't a better print of it around. It's rather spooky and quite effective. The story concerns a husband bringing his new bride home to his family estate. She's recently out of a mental hospital due to the shock of her parents' accidental drownings. He's a widower and the shadow of his former wife {whom he's killed) hangs over everything. The bride (Peggy Webber, later a ""Dragnet"" regular on TV) is now rich from her inheritance and the husband tries to drive her insane and/or to suicide to get the money. He plants a skull everywhere trying to scare her and the screeching of his late wife's peacocks that still roam the grounds of the estate add to the spookiness. The screeching of the peacocks is used to emulate screams that Webber thinks is the skull screaming. But the estates' looney gardner (who loved the late wife) is on to everything and has a skull of his own that he keeps hidden in a murky fountain. Just as Webber has screamed herself into a near catatonic state from fright, the ghost of the late wife shows up to exact revenge. This sequence is handled very well as the specter is dressed in a flowing gardening dress and big hat with a skull for a face. It floats out of the greenhouse (her favorite place as she loved flowers) and chases Webber down the garden path and into the house---at night of course and very effective. It's all very low budget but well done in b&w with creepy music and a good performance from Webber. The estate is properly run down and gothic looking and shadows are used to good effect. I hope to see a decent print of this one day. I'd love to own it.",1045699200,19,1670,4.44299674267101
1410044,1,B00005A07V,"Ignore some of the folks who gave this five stars. Both the movies and the picture are absolutely horrendous (but you expected that, didn't you.) ""Screaming Skull"" and especially ""Werewolf vs. Vampire Woman"" aren't as deliriously so-bad-they're-good as you'd hope: they're just bad. As in BAD bad.
""Screaming Skull"" and especially ""Werewolf vs. Vampire Woman"" look awful. ""Werewolf"" includes some of the strangest visual distortion I've ever seen: the backgrounds tend to jitter as the foregrounds stay still. Colour bleed, grain, and poor contrast are all present.
The extras include a not very good Betty Boop cartoon, as well as trailers for the main attractions and ""Brides of Dracula."" The trailers are the disc's only asset.",1044403200,2,730,5.301724137931035
1410045,1,B00005A07V,"The Screaming Skull had been mentioned in Hallmark's promo video, Creepy Classics.  We attempted to rent the video, but it was not available.  Now we know why!
While the B&W lends a bit of creepyness to the flick, the story line was pathetic.  68 minutes was way too long!  Even Elvira would not have had this on her sci-fi Saturday creep show!

1410047,2,B00005A07V,"Yet again, Madacy has gone out of their way to find the worst prints imaginable to sell to the unsuspecting viewing public.
The first feature, ""The Screaming Skull"" (a title that's given me a headache for decades!), is exceptionally muddy and dark, obviously an extremely poor dub from a several-generations old video source. The second feature on the tape, ""The Werewolf vs. the Vampire Woman"" is pure pan n' scan from a very scuffed and chopped print. Distortions and color blur are obvious on the edges of the picture.
In ""The Screaming Skull"", young and nervous newy wed is terrorized by a skull, supposedly that of her new hubby's ex, who died from a crushed skull/drowning in a lilly pond. Grade Z acting all around.
While ""The Screaming Skull"" is a classic low-budget horror flick from the 1950's, ""The Werewolf vs. the Vampire Woman"" is of European 1971 vintage.
In this one, two college girls travel to eastern Europe in search of a legendary grave of a lady vampire. They meet up with a spooky guy when the run out of gas. Naturally, he's a werewolf. Well, with at least one of the two college girls, I'd be howling at the moon, too.
Anyway, they stupidly awaken the lady vampire, and after a bunch of killings, the werewolf and vampire have it out. Obviously the ""director"" was a fan of ""The Six Million Dollar Man"", because the lady vampires run and jump in slow motion (not as sexy as it sounds). There are hints of breast from time to time, but if there were any naughty scenes originally, they appear to have been cut (European versions have five to six more minutes then the US drive-in release, which this seems to be).
I would strongly urge DVD collectors to avoid any of the horror titles in this Madacy set.
I gave the disc two stars only because of the interactive menus. They are the only part of the disc that was nicely done, and there is a Popeye cartoon added for ""intermission"".",987379200,13,1905,4.573099415204679

1410088,4,B00005A07V,"The film begins with the classic set up of sunshine  blue skies opening but quickly grows dark into a haunting comedy of psychological strain. Peggy Webbers character soon feels that she is being haunted by the ghost of the dead spouse while also fighting an existing psychosis for which she was committed previously. Her husband tries to tell her that it is her imagination quickly followed by the blame being placed on Mickey. Then as it is revealed to Webber the true ordeal she faces with her new husband the nightmare becomes filled with suspense and panic.

The Screaming Skull had the marketing gimmick that is just brilliant. The promised to give free casket and funeral for anyone who died from fright while watching this film. Love it! Now by no means would this movie cause such a fright to todays audience but in 1956 maybe. It seemed people fainted at the slightest of things, swear words, drops of blood, or panties too tight. The film does have some pretty cool effects that became standard in Hollywood films of the time with ghosts, classic props and dark shadowy scenes of chase that give both visual and psychological build of intense suspense. The acting is above par for a B-movie and the story plays like a classic Hitchockian nightmare that is both intimate and easily conceived by the audience. Although the effects are basic and dated by todays standard they work in this film by giving some cool entertainment value to the melodrama that unfolds.",1433462400,,1472,4.791338582677166
1410089,4,B00005A07V,"This is a classic atmospheric flick in the tradition of The Haunting but with much less atmosphere and a very predictable plot. You know who the villan is about 10 minutes in but it's almost worth it to see someone struggle with an inanimate skull as if it was attacking them.  Truly what makes this movie horror is the fact that it doesn't have the blood and gore that seems to make a horror film today. No, instead it makes YOU rely upon your senses. I very highly recommend this gem to anyone who wants to see psychological terror and escape the blood and gore. I got this for my son who saw it when he was 5 & at 37 years old is still terrified by it.

If you enjoy these kinds of movies, I suggest you check out ""Svengooli"" (previously called Son of Svengooli) Svengoolie is a hosted horror movie show. The show's title is taken from the name of the character host. The show is a long-running local program in the Chicago area and in recent years expanded nationally, airing Saturday nights on Me-TV. To make it even better :Svengooli"" (Rich Koz) is truly a nice & decent person in real life.

SPOILER ALERT
The film opens with a narrated disclaimer over footage of an opening coffin. The narrator explains that the film's climax is so terrifying that it may kill the viewer, and reassures the audience that if they die of fright while watching the film, they will receive a free burial service, and it closes on the casket which has a card inside reading ""Reserved for You.""[1]

Newlyweds Jenni (Peggy Webber) and Eric (John Hudson) move into Eric's palatial country home. Jenni is Eric's second wife; his first wife Marion died when she accidentally slipped and hit her head on the edge of a decorative pond on the estate. At the home they meet Eric's friends, the Reverend Snow (Russ Conway) and his wife (Toni Johnson), as well as Mickey (Alex Nicol), the developmentally disabled gardener. Eric privately mentions to the Snows that Jenni spent time in an asylum following the sudden death of both her parents, and Mrs. Snow reveals that Jenni is very wealthy.

Jenni is disturbed both by Mickey's belief that Marion's ghost wanders the estate and by Marion's self-portrait inside the house, which Jenni believes resembles her mother. When she begins to hear unexplained screaming noises and see skulls around her house, she believes that Marion is haunting her. Though Eric speculates to Jenni that Mickey, who was a childhood friend of Marion and thus dislikes Jenni, may be behind the trickery, Jenni worries that she is going insane. Eric then suggests to remove Marion's self-portrait from the home. Eric and Jenni take the painting outside and burn it. While they clean up the remains of the painting, a skull emerges from the ashes. While Jenni panics at the sight of the skull, Eric denies that the skull is there. Jenni faints and Eric withdraws the skull and hides it, revealing that he was responsible for the trickery all along in an effort to get hold of her wealth.

Believing she has finally lost her sanity, Jenni resolves to be committed. She tells Eric that the entire property will be meticulously searched for the skull as a last resort. Before Eric can retrieve it, Mickey secretly steals the skull and brings it to the Reverend, revealing Eric's plans. That night, Eric prepares to murder Jenni and stage it as a suicide. Jenni sees Marion's ghost in Mickey's greenhouse and flees back to the house. When she enters, Eric begins throttling her. The ghost then appears and chases Eric outside and about the property; it finally corners and attacks him, drowning him in the decorative pond.

After Jenni regains consciousness, the Snows arrive. Mrs. Snow comforts a hysterical Jenni and the Reverend discovers Eric's body in the pond. Some undisclosed time later, Jenni and the Snows depart from the house. Reverend Snow declares whether or not Marion's death was an accident will remain a mystery.",1431820800,,3927,4.740849194729136
1410090,3,B00005A07V,"It's obvious at the outset what's going on and why, so everything that follows is expected.  The story features a creep (played with stupefying numbness by John Hudson) who is trying to gaslight his new RICH wife (Peggy Webber).  To that end, he tries all manner of dopey tricks to drive her to suicide.  Skull, skull, who's got the skull?  What skull, I don't see a skull, oh dear, you've gone all crazy on me again haven't you darling?  That's what comes of being..........impressionable.

This film is the brainchild of a bored actor (Alex Nicol, who also plays Mickey the gardener and friend to the first wife).  He wasn't pleased with the types of roles he'd been getting at the time so he decided to direct himself in a film, how hard could it be?  The results are less than inspiring.

And, why does the house they live in have a colonial exterior and a Spanish interior?  The Screaming Skull does not care to answer these questions.

Lots of print damage, a very soft image; and although it's full-screen (as compared to some other releases ""widescreen"" format which truncates the picture), it's still a lousy print.  That said, it also doesn't contain some of the choppy ""jump cut"" edits that find their way into other releases, making it a more complete print than some.  The MADACY DVD also tries to create a ""Drive-In"" movie experience, with trailers and a cheezy-looking drive-in graphic that unfortunately they use to begin the main film with, shrinking the opening AIP titles and then ""opening up"" the picture to full screen.

1410142,3,B00005A07V,"You know why I love those old ""classic"" horror movies so much? Because for all their problems and limitations (mostly due to lack of budget and the primitive state of special effects at the time), those movies, the really bad ones, took themselves way too seriously. Case in point: THE SCREAMING SKULL.

The plot is an old one. Widowed husband brings new wife to old home with the intention of driving her either insane or to suicide in order to gain her inheritance. The husband in this case is Eric Whitlock (played by John Hudson) who's bringing his new wife Jenny (Peggy Webber) back to the mansion he shared with Marion before her untimely demise. Untimely in that Eric didn't wait long enough to kill her before she revised her will and all he got was the house and the land, but where's the money? Luckily new wife Jenny is loaded. And she's got a history of mental illness to boot--score for Eric!

Rounding out our cast are curious onlookers Reverend and Mrs. Snow--friends of Eric and Marion, now Eric and Jenny--and Mickey the gardener, played by Alex Nichol who also directed.

Spending her nights alone in the mansion while Eric is ""in town"" tending to the business of their moving back into the place, Jenny is woken by a screaming late at night, which turns out to be coming from a skull she finds stashed in an armoire. Jenny tosses the skull out the window, but it finds its way back onto the porch and begins knocking loudly at the door until Jenny opens it to let it in. But when Jenny tries to explain to Eric what's happened, he insists she's simply having a reaction to the new home and a portrait of his deceased wife that reminds Jenny of her own dead mother.

The audience, meanwhile, is left to wonder which of the three possibilities is really at play here. It's either Marion's ghost come back to haunt the mansion, or it's Mickey trying to scare away the new wife (Mickey and Marion grew up together and she was one of the only people the feeble-minded gardener could relate to). Or, it could be stone-faced dead-inside Eric. The whys of this last theory don't come out until close to the end, so for the most part we're led to believe Mickey the likely culprit.

The only problem ... the only REAL problem the movie could have solved but didn't (you can't hold crappy effects and even worse acting against them, it was 1958) is that the movie never really makes up its mind. Yes, of course it's really Eric trying to get his hands on Jenny's money without the trouble of an actual wife hanging around, but the skull Jenny finds really does move on its own, and she's clearly haunted by a real ghost while Eric is out looking for Mickey and is nowhere near the house. So THE SCREAMING SKULL actually wants to have two protagonists at once--the murdered wife, and the sociopathic husband. In the end it just leaves the audience confused.

I had originally seen this movie years ago on MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATRE 3000, and it's probably one of my most-viewed episodes, so it's almost impossible to watch the regular version of the movie and not hear the jokes in your head. But believe me, if you know the jokes, just say them out loud because you'll need something to take your mind off how truly boring this movie is.

And now back to that part about taking themselves too seriously. In the 50s, moviemakers used to come up with some crazy ploys to get audiences in the theaters, such as William Castle's vibrating seat device during screenings of THE TINGLER. THE SCREAMING SKULL played the same game, including a short introduction stating the climax was so frightening you might actually die, and insuring free burial to anyone who did succumb to the ""shocking horror"". Well, if super-imposed skull images growing to giant proportions over the backdrop of the scene is enough to scare you literally to death ... you've got bigger problems than bad taste in movies.

THE SCREAMING SKULL is a movie with simply too many strikes against it. The story is predictable, the pacing is eternal (even at only 68 minutes, it feels like a week). The editing is choppy, the sound is off balance, and the lightning changes from shot to shot. The dialogue is ridiculous, the acting even worse, and watching John Hudson writhe around while clutching a skull to his neck and pretending it's attacking him is just embarrassing.

As much as I love crappy old horror movies, THE SCREAMING SKULL doesn't even qualify as cheesy bad; it's just plain bad. If you want to revel in your lack of quality, at least have something original to bring to the table. This isn't it. And that's why it wound up on MST3k in the first place.",1343952000,,4634,4.58021712907117

Jenni has issues that stem from seeing her parents drown, but I suspicion that Jenni has a lot more issues than just that.  After all, who else saw the bouncing skull?

Jenni (and we) get to see the skull in various places on the property.  We also get to see other eerie things happening, all supposedly caused by deceased wife Mary.  However, if you pay attention and use a little deductive reasoning, you can figure out much of what is going on long before the movie reveals what is happening - except for the supernatural parts, of course.

I thought the director plotted this movie well.  The plot is borrowed from other films that rely less on the supernatural aspects of the plot, but this film also uses those supernatural aspects to create an ending that varies from other, similar films.  I am unable to point to a place in the movie where I was frightened, but there are a couple of scenes that I thought were a little spooky.

The picture and sound were reasonably good, though I am unable to tell whether they have been restored using the best available modern standards.  I suspect not.

This movie tries very hard to take itself seriously, and other than the campy beginning (if you are frightened to death by the movie they have a coffin reserved for you) the movie is played as a reasonably straightforward horror story.  If you like movies that use a supposedly haunted house and combine supernatural and natural aspects in the plot, then you may enjoy this movie.

Elvira is a student who feels it is necessary to defile the tomb of a Hungarian Countess ostensibly for her course work but really so she can end up dripping blood on the corpse so it can come back to life.  Next thing we know, the Countess Wandessa d'Arville de Nadasdy (Patty Shepard ) is up and about and women are biting each other on the neck.  Periodically Waldemar turns hairy and runs around in the woods.  It seems like these two plotlines should have more to do with each other given the title, but neither character is in a hurry to get to that point as ancient evil and a lengthy curse take a back step to a trip to the local market.  When we get to the climax and the fight between the title creatures, I swear it happens because they ran out of anything else for the characters to do.

The day for night shooting is pretty dark and you can never really see what is going on until we get a close-up of the blood on the corpses.  No wonder the Vampire Woman runs around in the sunlight.  The director likes to cut back and forth between shots really quickly when something is about to happen.  The music in this film becomes almost oppressive it is so unrelenting as it tries to provide more atmosphere than the actors and scenes have created.  At lest there is something reassuring about gold old fashion time lapse dissolves for werewolves to turn hairy (and visa versa) and vampires to become skeletons.  It is just that the big fight at the end seems so anticlimactic, especially for ""the most sensational fight to the finish ever filmed,"" and even the pathos of freeing a loved one from a curse seems so mundane.  The final credits are the best part of the film, not because it is all over, but because it is actually the most atmospheric part of the whole thing (really).

As is usually the case with these Killer Creature Double Feature DVDs there are trailers for both of the main features, both of which are better than the films themselves, with the trailer for Hammer's ""The Brides of Dracula"" starting off the evening's festivities.  Intermission is a Max Fleischer Betty Boop cartoon, ""Morning, Noon, and Night"" recorded by Rubinoff and his Orchestra for what that is worth.  Basically cats are going after baby chicks and a determined Betty comes to the rescue, although dancing is involved first and a rooster and other fowl of the air do most of the work.  How day turns to night here was pretty cute.  However, unlike the DVDs from Something Weird there the extras here are too skimpy to make up for the shortcomings of the films.

The math for this week has ""Screaming Skull"" coming in at 2 stars and ""The Werewolf vs. the Vampire Woman"" earns 3 stars, so we divide in half and round up because the second flick does cover all of the bases for good old European horror film from that period.  Next week we try again, not only to have a double feature to watch on Saturday night instead of Monday but also to find some better bad movies as we screen ""Naked Evil"" and ""Exorcism at Midnight"" as we try biker gangs and voodoo mixed up together in England.",1113782400,,5858,4.5394862036156045
1410170,2,B00005A07V,"I'm usually a big 50's sci fi buff so how could I resist such a great title and cover art, right?

It was a decent story and well done but there really wasn't much to it.  Nothing really creative as far as scares or special effects - just the same plastic skull rolling around on the floor over and over.  It probably would have played better as a 1/2 hour episode of Night Gallery.  For reference purposes on 50's horror, I prefer House on Haunted Hill or Tingler to this film. Screaming Skull is not bad, just uneventful with a lack of real scares or creativity.

One thing to note on the Good Times version - it has a decent transfer, the sound has a hiss and crackle and there is a GoodTimes 'GT' logo that stays in the bottom corner of the screen the entire picture.  I guess GoodTimes will always be lame.",1112745600,8,811,4.233766233766234
1410171,3,B00005A07V,"THE SCREAMING SKULL opens w/ the perrrfectly cheeeze-wonderful casket sequence, warning us that we just might die of fright from viewing this motion picture! After this joyous event, our tale begins. Eric and Jenny Whitlock (John Hudson and Peggy Webber) are newlyweds who move into the country mansion that Eric lived in with his first wife, Marianne. Marianne met with an untimely demise by ""slipping"" and smashing her skull on the pond wall. Now, Jenny is experiencing late-night visitations by Marianne's ghost. Or is she? Eric seems supportive, but spends most of his time away on business. Mickey (Alex Nicol), the twitchy gardener, grew up w/ Marianne and could be crazy enough to terrorize Jenny w/ the yowling noggin of the title. Yes, the skull rolls around like a bony soccer ball, sending Jenny into fits of overwrought mania! There's a hideous portrait of Marianne, and a backyard monument to boot! Jenny slowly comes unglued, due to the seemingly supernatural ballyhoo. There are some periods of dire dullness to offset the hyperbolic idiocy, but the whole thing is just over an hour long. Co-stars Russ Conway as the stiff, no nonsense Rev. Edward Snow, and Tony Johnson as his utterly prim wife. In more capable hands, this could have been quite a horror / mystery film.

1410172,2,B00005A07V,"This is an endearing , odd little film directed by industry workhorse Alex Nicol who died recently at the grand old age of 85, and who gave himself the role of the grief-struck gardener Mickey in ""Screaming Skull"". Smart move; he's the most interesting character in the flick. I remember being scared by the trailer and even the poster when this movie first came out, but then I was 7 years old and a good, lurid poster could scare the bejayzuss out of me. The movie is cheap, moody, and the spare unadorned settings (I should think the peacocks and the flowerpots in the greenhouse took up most of the film's budget)
somehow work to create a sense of jagged paranoia, although you'd think the new bride would be a tad suspicious that her new hubby can't seem to get the electricity turned on in the dark mansion he's brought her to, and she has to manage with the light of one (!) sputtering candle by which to read her Henry James. And it's a mark of the movie's quirkiness that her bedtime reading is Henry James, and not ... well, given the era, Erskine Caldwell...
however, what should at worst be a guilty pleasure and at best a treasured item in your genre DVD collection, is sabotaged by the awful quality of the print. Alpha Video are very hit and miss, for instance their ""Brain that Wouldn't Die"" and ""Killer Shrews"" are not half bad, quite crisp with good sound, whereas ""Night of the Blood Beast"" is a scratchy splotchy mess, and ""Hercules Unchained"" has great chunks of the movie missing. But if you're keen to have a copy of some rare items, AV are often acceptable given the attractive packaging and LOW prices. In the case of ""Screaming Skull"", however, they frankly have a lot of nerve charging ANYTHING for the DVD. The print is speckled and scratched throughout, in places badly damaged, it jumps and hiccups, the tonal quality is non-existent; contrast so dreadful the whites flare into a screen-bleaching nothingness while the darker tones emerge as charcoal-dark blotches making the whole thing resemble a monochrome Jackson Pollock. At the most viewable moments, the image is a dull degenerated gray. Even more egregious, if that's possible, is the sound - so muffled that our plucky heroine's dialogue is unintelligible, you have to grab at a word here and there and try to infer what she might be saying. The male voices - lower register - do survive reasonably intact. Alpha Video really should be ashamed of themselves on this one. They can't keep hiding behind ""But look how cheap!"", eventually fans will wise up and start demanding refunds. On ""Screaming Skull"" at least, AV should pay us, the eager collecting movie fan public, for taking this dreadful technical travesty off their hands. But hey, I repeat ... the movie is strangely loveable, and hopefully someone will, one day, find a cleaner print.",1084406400,8,2833,4.725252525252525
1410173,3,B00005A07V,"Eh. The Screaming Skull was included in the 50 movie, 12 DVD horror collection I just purchased.  I found the movie slow, but there are some nice touches....the peacocks on the estate and the strange sound they make at night, the way the skull lands and rolls on the garden lawn when the women hurls it from her window.  That's about it.
Oh yeah,that ultimate creepy music from the opening of Kubrick's The Shining is featured in the beginning.  I found that interesting.",1078790400,2,471,4.650602409638554

Alas, he doesn't anticipate his first wife coming back from the grave for revenge in the guise of a screaming skull.

This film scared the bejeezus out of me as a kid, watching it in the dark on late-night TV in the 1960s, and I could yet feel a nostalgic chill in some scenes, watching it today.  There are a few shots of the banshee in full ghostly attire that are still creepy as hell.

Yes, it's very talky and totally lacks any gore or over-the-top special effects.  This is one of those low-budget treats from the golden age of supernatural suspense that calls upon the audience's imagination to supply the real terror.

What more do you want? This movie was shot by Floyd Crosby, an Academy Award winner, he also shot High Noon, and it is lit and shot beautifully, some of the interior scenes are just stunning. It was shot in a real, spooky old house and it has a genuine, Gothic atmosphere.

Granted, those moments are punctuated by undeniably hilarious shots of the titular menace wiggling in the grass or rolling from place to place, and Alex Nicol's odd performance as Mickey the caretaker will have ""Manos"" fans wondering if he and Torgo are related.
