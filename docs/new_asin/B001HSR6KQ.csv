8309502,5,B001HSR6KQ,"I wasn't sure what exactly to expect from this film, I'll be honest, the main reason I got it is because I was a big fan of Armin, who is one of the dj's featured on the film.  The film takes you through the journey of hosting such a big event and how it all got started in the first place.  It's pretty much a documentary, and a very good one at that.",1306540800,,352,3.808219178082192
