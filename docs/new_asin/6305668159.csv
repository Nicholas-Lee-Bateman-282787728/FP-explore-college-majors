1062392,5,6305668159,"So you've decided to buy a dragonball Z DVD and you don't know which one is best? Well I'm here to help you out friend. This is the begining of my personal favorite saga in the intire DBZ outfit. That is of course the Freezer(frieza) saga. It has the most compeling story line that I've ever seen in an anime saga. Not to metion that the japanise music and dioluge are far better than the english DUB. I highly recommend buying this and future Freezer(frieza) DVD.
 Please help a guy out and say that this review helped you ^_^. I have a bet with my couisen. Thank you.",992390400,,569,4.268518518518518
1062393,5,6305668159,"Goku finally gets down and dirty with Frieza and Frieza shows off some of his little tricks and traps. Goku, however, isn't easily fooled by these tricks. As Goku and Frieza continue to battle it out, Captain Ginyu (in frog body) manages to switch bodies with Bulma. This gaga follows through out the Frieza saga. The battle scenes were pretty intense and when Frieza reveals hes not using his full stregth, this can mean only more cool stuff to come.",979344000,,451,4.65
1062394,1,6305668159,"I'm 15.  I'm a guy. I'm an american.  AND I ADMIT DBZ IN AMERICA IS NOT AS GOOD AS DBZ IN JAPAN.  Good, I've got that out of the way.  I've rated other videos, and I've given five stars because they deserved  five stars!  The problem with American DBZ, is a lot of stuff is dubbed.  That is why I  only rate uncut versions, with the exception of this one.  Yeah, cut  versions stink.  No doubt about that, but the people who watch them, that's  their choice.  I watch uncut because I can't find subtitles and I like DBZ  pure.",949536000,,526,4.13
1062395,1,6305668159,"The dubbed version of DBZ is simply horrible. The people that keep giving this 5 stars are 9 year olds who don't know any better. DBZ is great, but no the English version.",945993600,,171,4.212121212121212

7893341,5,6305668159,"And what a battle it is. Frieza's true fighting power is finally revealed in this amazing DVD. The first episode on this DVD is an all out fight between Goku and Frieza in which they both show some weird attacks that are great to watch. This includes Frieza playing ""pinball"" with Goku. (Well, that's what the back of the DVD calls it at least.) In the second episode, Frieza finally reveals how powerful he really is as the fight moves on. The episode also contains an amazingly funny filler debacle that will span three epsisodes. (The rest of this DVD and the first episode on the next DVD, Desperation.)
Yes, this three-episode filler debacle is where Captain Ginyu switches bodies with Bulma and the chaos that follows. The conclusion to it is in the next DVD, so be sure to check that out. The final episode shows Frieza reach new powers which are really high. He starts to take down Goku and the battle is incredible. As for the actual DVD features, there are no extra's, but you should be used to this. The cover is a screenshot from the DVD, but it is sort of misleading. It makes it look like Goku is winning when he is not. Anyway, this DVD is superb and deffinetaly a must-buy.",1074297600,,1189,4.458715596330276
7893342,5,6305668159,and it is really good. This DVD is great cause it continues where the Namek and Ginyu sagas left off and sets up the Frieza saga. It is a great segway. This DVD also resolves some things left from the Saiyan saga. Alot happens but i won't ruin it for you. You really should buy this DVD but buy it with Frieza: Transformation for a real treat.,1050537600,,343,4.134328358208955
7893343,3,6305668159,"This is what you'll get out of watching this ok DBZ DVD that has 3 episodes:
Clash of the Super Powers
-Goku's first shots at Frieza
-Clues to make you think Frieza is a girl
Frieza's Boast
-Frieza fighting evenly with Goku with his hands behind his back at 1% of his power
-Goku biting Frieza
Bold and Fearless
-Frieza beating up Goku when he's only at 50% of his power
THE SKINNY:  Frieza even says himself he's just been playing with Goku during the first two episodes, making this DVD not worth buying.  You should only get this DVD if you are one of the small minority of Frieza fans out there.  The only other thing even remotely exciting is when Bulma is turned in to a frog.",1045785600,,682,4.271317829457364
7893344,5,6305668159,"Dragonball Z is back, back with a brand new saga, and what a helluva saga it is gonna be. Right from when you slip this disc into your DVD player things are looking good; Gone is the static Menu of previous volumes, and in it's place a more lively looking intro inside of Capsule Corp. Prototype 1138 where the image of the DBZ (English version) trailer plays away to some funky new beats as you make your selection of where you want to head...
 This DVD contains the first three episodes of the excellent/epic Frieza saga, where things are really starting to take an interesting turn. With Goku still in bad shape from his battle with Captain Ginyu Gohan and Krillin are forced to form an uneasy alliance with their worst enemy Vegeta if they want to have any chance of survival from the wrath of ultimate bad guy Frieza (hell you gotta see this guy lose his rag in the these episodes to believe it, it aint pretty. And that isn't nothing compared to what's still to come in this saga). Although these certainly are not the most action packed of episodes they have key plot elements in them which no one who calls themselves a Dragonball Z fan will want to miss...Namekian fusion, The Eternal Dragon, a peed off Vegeta and a beserk maniac by the name of Frieza are just a few of what's on offer here. Not to be missed.
 As for the disc itself, well it's certainly a step in the right direction in regards to presentation with the upgraded menu and a good selection of trailers for later sagas and the online DBZ store. Things are most definately slowly looking up on all fronts and I fully recommend picking up this next chapter in the on going epic that is both the Frieza saga and Dragonball as a whole. Toriyama's incredible manga continues to be done full justice in the perfection piece that is Dragonball Z.",1025740800,,1814,4.460843373493976
7893345,4,6305668159,"This DVD was pretty good, the menus and extras aren't any different from the rest of the Frieza Saga DVDs though.  The fighting didn't start until the end of the 3rd episode on this DVD.  Everything before that was plot, but what great plot it is!  You'd be missing out on a very important part of the saga if you didn't get this DVD.  I definitely reccomend it.",1009497600,,362,4.279411764705882
7893346,3,6305668159,"I was a little bored with this one.  Pretty much it was just Goku and Frieza fighting, nothing major really happened.  If you enjoy long fights, then you'll love this.",1006387200,,167,4.533333333333333
7893347,5,6305668159,"Frieza and Goku fight and Goku starts losing.  It seems there is nothing else Goku can do so he remembers a technique he learned while training with King Kai; the Spirit Bomb!  He needs time to charge it and when Frieza finds out what Goku's up to, Piccolo tries to stalll so Goku can complete the Spirit Bomb.  Non-stop action and great music.",1006387200,,344,4.428571428571429
