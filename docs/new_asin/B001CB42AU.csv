8286368,4,B001CB42AU,"If this film seems quirky by today's standards, one can only imagine what people thought in 1967 when it was first shown.  There isn't a story in the conventional sense, it's more a pastiche of Charlie in mid-life, a series of vignettes in which one way or another he's become an outsider to his own experiences.  I like the slightly surreal quality of the movie, as well as the way the parts are only loosely connected -- but I must say, some parts are better than others.  As for Liza Minnelli, kind of a creepy character she inhabits, sort of awful and boring at the same time.

Sometimes looking at old films like this, one is surprised by words or phrases that we think of as being new, or from our own time, in this case a reference to organic gardening.  I didn't remember people talking about that back in '67.  Lots of cigarette and cigar smoking, a stout reminder that this is the Sixties.

I like another Finney movie, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning.  It's a better movie than this one, but they make a good pair, viewed one after the other, or two nights in a row.  In both movies, Finney drawing on his working-class roots, the realness comes through.",1380672000,3,1167,4.466981132075472
8286369,3,B001CB42AU,"A little difficult to know where we are going with this one. Quite early on in the film I had the impression that this was going to be on the lines of ""Sir Henry at Rawlinson End"" (see my Amazon review) but no such luck--it quickly lost its way for me.

The film is essentially a series of vignettes of varying duration (some outstaying their welcome) loosely threaded together by the main character of Charlie Bubbles (Finney) himself. (This, I understand, was his first and only? shot at directing a film as well as acting in it. Perhaps the dual roles were rather too much for him to handle?) Some of the episodes come close to being corny, such as when his young prot&eacute;g&eacute; slowly undresses him, leaving her extensive black wig on the pillow as she makes for the lower regions of the bed!

On the CD case we have: ""Wretched in his wealth, Charles stumbles through life drunk, debauched and dull, until he decides to go home again to revisit his ex-wife (Billie Whitelaw) and child in the North."" Whitelaw, we are further told, earned a BAFTA award for her role. She gives a competent performance as was her way but her contribution is minimal. This is misleading since nothing appears to have been resolved by his visiting the old home--on the contrary it would appear.

If the intent was to demonstrate just how blas&eacute; one can become about life then it partially succeeds. There may be other dimensions that would require a second watching, something I am disinclined to take on. There are incongruences too (unless I have missed the point) such as Whitelaw espousing a healthy lifestyle on the ""farm"" with organically grown foods as she puffs her way through one fag after another. (I suppose the short episodic, niggling coughing from Finney might have indicated an over indulgence with the cigars?)

Some nice scenic shots from Northern Britain that you'll have a job to see today owing to the rash of wind farms spreading across the landscape. The tranquillity too has been shattered since the Ministry of Defence introduced intensive and extensive low flying by military jets over rural Britain from the early 1970s. And the final farewell as Finney drifts away in a balloon would have him in danger of colliding with a jet in today's utterly insane world.

Perhaps there should be a re-make of the film in order to further emphasize our continual slide into decadence?",1352851200,2,2396,4.777777777777778
