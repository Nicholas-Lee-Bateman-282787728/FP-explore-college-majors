8165636,5,B000M1LYIY,"I love Joan Hickson as Miss Marple. Ok, I haven't seen the others; but Hickson is so as I envisioned Miss Marple when I first read those stories that I really haven't cared to check out the others. The other casting is, imo, also very good. Story well told here.",1443052800,,262,4.26

The Moving Finger

Mrs. Cleat has a nose for the nasty.

Naturally, if they kept the subplots and characterization the same as the book, this movie would be a miniseries. However they did do a good job of consolidating characters and sticking to the main points of the story. Even if you have read the book you will enjoy watching the movie.

One of the plusses of this movie is the character that plays Edward Symmington (Michael Culver.) He is in several other English films and plays Prior Robert in the Brother Cadfael Series.

One of the minuses of this movie is the Lisa Doolittle scene; it is totally out of character for aunt Jane films.

You have the characteristic mystery and the usual (or unusual) suspects. Aunt Jane is confronted with a problem that may snowball into murder if she does not figure it out in time. But as everyone says, ""Ask Miss Marple. She usually has the right answer.""

At Bertram's Hotel

Muffins vs. tea cakes with raisins

It is not easy comparing movies to books, especially Agatha Christie's novels. However this one has the feel and just the right actors. There is great attention to detail.

If you have the nagging feeling that you saw Chief Inspector Fred Davy (George Baker) before it may be that he has been in at least 100 movies and shows, recently as Detective Chief Inspector Wexford in Ruth Rendell Mysteries.

Bertram's Hotel is just how Jane remembered it as a child. She soon comes to the conclusion that it is to good to be true. The Chief Inspector is of the same mind. This film has several overlying plots. However just being in the hotel will distract you from them.

So get out your muffins, sit up in bed and watch ""At Bertram's Hotel.""",1362787200,2,1760,4.737704918032787
