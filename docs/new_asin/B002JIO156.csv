Most of which I have purchased and studied.  I really wish I could get my money back.  This is a video of a teacher and his class of kids learning the tonfa without much editing.  There is not a traditional kata to be learned here if you are looking for that.  You will not have the tools to ""Master the Tonfa"" with this video",1294876800,4,480,4.21978021978022
