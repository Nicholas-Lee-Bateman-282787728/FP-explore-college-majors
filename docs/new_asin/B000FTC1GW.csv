2584376,5,B000FTC1GW,"My original ""review"" was written in 2006, with a main focus on how PATHETIC it was that Warner Brothers had not yet released season two. After four years, and many excellent reviews by other fans, it looks like we will FINALLY get our wish! I have decided to change the tone of my review from ""negative"" to ""positive"", and enhance it with episode information. My original review is still attached at the bottom, perhaps as a reminder to Warner of how unhappy we all were (and that they had better not wait another FOUR years before releasing season THREE).

Brief episode list:

1. ""The Nun"" - 9/27/1984
Dinah Manoff as a NUN! Woohoo!
2. Christine and Mac (a.k.a. Daddy for the Defense) - 10/4/1984
Markie Post arrives (for one episode)!!!
3.  Billie and the Cat - 10/18/1984
It's a ""catnapping"" and Harry sends public defender Billie Young to jail.
4. Pick a Number - 10/25/1984
A winning lottery ticket sends the courtroom into a frenzy!
5. The Computer Kid - 11/1/1984
A computer whiz takes over Harry's office!
6. Bull Gets a Kid - 11/8/1984
Yep. Bull becomes a foster parent!
7. Harry on Trial - 11/15/1984
Harry isn't your average judge, and he could be in trouble for it!
8. Harry and the Madam - 11/22/1984
Stella Stevens guest stars!
9. Inside Harry Stone - 11/29/1984
John Astin guest stars! Harry and his darn ulcer!
10. The Blizzard - 12/6/1984
Trapped in the courtroom! Dan is stuck in an elevator, and he's NOT alone.
11. Take My Wife, Please - 12/13/1984
Michael Richards guest stars!!
12. The Birthday Visitor - 1/3/1985
It's Billie's Birthday... but it doesn't go smoothly!
13. Dan's Parents - 1/10/1985

14. Nuts About Harry - 1/17/1985

17. Battling Bailiff - 2/7/1985
Bull quits to become a pro wrestler!
18. Billie's Valentine - 2/14/1985
Billie's boyfriend causes a lot of trouble! Guest: Lou Ferrigno!!!
19. Married Alive - 2/21/1985
Dan the gold-digger?
20. Mac and Quon Le: Together Again - 2/28/1985
Billie or Dan for a comission?
21. World War III - 5/2/1985
Yakov Smirnoff and Gordon Jump!
22. Walk, Don't Wheel - 5/9/1985
Harry refuses to go to the prom with a disabled girl.

Twenty Two great episodes of classic comedy! Markie Post doesn't yet become a regular cast member (you'll have to wait 'til season three). Speaking of Markie Post; fans sure would like to have the second season of ""the Fall Guy"" released (where she appeared from 1982-1985).

It's been a LONG wait, but it will certainly be worth it! There are still OTHER great series out there that have been treated unfairly by the studios, so this release can be seen as a bit of hope for all of us!

Three cheers for the arrival of season two!

------ > My original review:

It boggles my mind that a tv series like DOOGIE HOWSER has FOUR seasons out on DVD while a program like Night Court that ran for NINE years has only ONE!

I would never describe the folks at Warner Bros. as being ""bright"", after all they had an entire TV network ""close shop"" and merge with another failed network (UPN). I'm sure it's all a reflection of ""great decision making"" :)

At any rate, maybe they'll do something RIGHT for a change and release the second season of Night Court... FINALLY.

Two thumbs up for Amazon and I hope they know something that we don't know about the potential of this release.

P.S.

Just because a DVD box set of a ""season one"" doesn't sell as well as a production company would like doesn't mean that future releases of later seasons will not sell better or even HELP to increase sales of the first season. Also, when several seasons have been released buyers tend to be more willing to make an investment into the series as a whole. I know lots of people who wait until several seasons are out (or even an entire series) before they start buying.

If you're going to release a ""season one"" of a TV series on DVD you're making a promise to fans of that series. I think production companies need to wise up and realize that they will certainly make all the money they wanted if they simply make a commitment and release everything. They may not see huge numbers at the beginning... but it will all sell eventually. Also, having the product ""out there"" is valuable in terms of NAME RECOGNITION for the production company. It will help the Warner Bros. NAME to have high quality and COMPLETE series in the DVD marketplace. Night Court is one of those series.

2584377,5,B000FTC1GW,Please release the other seasons.  There has never been anything on TV since this series that approaches the quality of this show.,1152921600,11,130,4.909090909090909

2584379,5,B000FTC1GW,FINALLY!  Hopefully this is the start of somthing great.  Fans are still waiting for the news of the release of the other great seasons of Night Court.

2584380,5,B000FTC1GW,"Night Court was one of the funniest shows of the 1980s or any decade. It's a shame that Warner Bros. might not release seasons 2-9, as the show got much better after the first season. All Night Court fans should buy the 1st season and the ""TV Favorites"" DVD, even though the 1st season isn't the best and the best of DVD includes the 1st 2 parts of the ""Her Honor"" storyline but not parts 3 and 4, to show our support.",1151625600,11,418,4.109756097560975
2584381,5,B000FTC1GW,"After all this time, I hope that ""Night Court - Season Two"" will be available soon.  Night Court is one of the best sitcoms to ever air on TV, and as far as I'm concerned, they can release all nine seasons.  Say it with me, I want more... I want more... I want more...",1151280000,10,268,3.9444444444444446
2584382,5,B000FTC1GW,I was so disappointed when I didn't see any new seasons of Night Court being released!  It was such a fun show!!  Let's hope Warner Bros. will continue onto the rest of the seasons!,1151193600,11,181,4.294117647058823
2584383,5,B000FTC1GW,"Yes, looks like they may be releasing this after all.  Everyone write a review expressing how much you want buy this when it comes out so that it doesn't get shelved again.",1151020800,11,172,4.375
2584384,5,B000FTC1GW,"Yes!  Night Court on DVD might not be dead after all!  PLEASE click on the button above to be e-mailed by Amazon when this product is finally available, so Warner Brothers will realize how wrong it's been to deprive us of the second season for soooooooo long!  Seeing this here just made my night!  Yes yes YES!

UPDATE:  May 27, 2007

Well, an entire year has now passed since I wrote my comments above.  The joy I expressed that night has since turned into frustration.  I just don't understand this!  WHY won't Warner Bros. release the second season?  The 6-episode ""Television Favorites"" compilation disc has not seemed to get them moving at all, unlike some of the other shows they tried that tactic with.  ""Welcome Back, Kotter"" and ""The Drew Carey Show"" were both given season sets following those releases, but ""Night Court"" still seems to be dead in the water.  The thought of being stuck with the butchered syndication versions of the final eight seasons (and even then, shown only rarely) is NOT appealing.

The length of time between first and second seasons is approaching ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" proportions!  I can only hope that the end result will be the same...better late than never!

Well Warner, the ball's in your ""court""!  (pun intended)

UPDATE:  October 10, 2008

Hooray!!!!!  Night Court Season Two will FINALLY be available in February, 2009.  A mere FOUR years after Season One, but better late than never.  PLEASE support this set so maybe Season Three won't take another four years to get.  At that rate, I would be 64 years old when the Ninth and final season would be released!  :)

My faith in Warner Bros. has been restored.  Good things truly DO come to those who wait.  Whew!",1148515200,77,1715,4.702702702702703

2584522,5,B000FTC1GW,"With most of the characters firmly in place, Night Court began its second season in September, 1984.  Here it is, 2016, and Harry, Dan, Mac, Bull and crew still hold up as one of the greatest ensemble casts ever assembled.  With exception of Markie Post, who made one appearance in Episode 2 and wouldn't be a regular until Season 3, the characters had both fleshed and rounded out.  Writers had now the opportunity to see their ""puppets"" in play.  They, the writers, had a feel for each and every person and had them dancing around the set like marionettes on strings.

Season 2 offered some of the cast a little expansion.  Mac had Quon Le.  Harry had both his ulcer and his father, Kenny ""I'm feeling MUCH better now"" (John Astin).  Bull got to try pro wrestling.  Billie's flame returns.  These are just a few examples of what to expect from this 22 episode season.  This is great comedy by a fantastic staff who certainly seem like they get along doing it.",1467676800,,961,4.52906976744186

2584558,4,B000FTC1GW,"To get it over with quickly, my copy arrived with some scratched and skips on disk one. Perhaps I should take away a star for damage, but instead, just a reminder of the risks.

Bottom Line: Harry Anderson and team deliver low key, finely timed humor with perhaps a few too many touches of human pathos. For a comedy show there are regular appearances of what are now hot button issues mostly handled with a light touch. This is family rated entertainment, but not entirely for the youngest. Night Court has some kind of reference to sex in every episode, but always off screen and played for humor.

I had remembered Night Court for the wacky Judge Stone (Harry Anderson), the older , no nonsense bailiff Roz played by Marsha Warfield and the big, not always dumb bailiff Nostradamus Bull Shannon, ( I bet HE was the biggest boy in his class) played by Richard Moll. The names are perhaps more famous, but the roles that seemed too predictable: John Larroquette the craven DA, Dan Fielding and Peoples Council for the Defense most often Markie Post as Christine Sullivan. For me the regular scene stealer was Court Clerk Mac Robinson, ably played by Charles Robinson. To some degree or another all of the cast were aware of and subordinate to Judge Stone, Mac, had seen too much to be all that impressed by his bosss joking.

Season 2 episodes address topics of the day  like Homosexuality, Vietnamese Camp survivors and Mental Health (look for a very young future Seinfeld star Michael Richards). In every case expect a low key sympathetic even respectful handling of the person and the issue. This is comedy so rarely will any topic be handled with complexity. A Russian and American diplomat will solve the problem of nuclear disarmament in one night, only to tear it up knowing neither side would accept anything that direct.

Another pleasure of these shows are the unexpected appearances of soon to be and longtime stars including Lou Ferrigno (those cannot be real), Stella Stevens, a very young Caroline McWilliams, Yakov Smirnoff Korolenko and John Austin.",1464652800,3,2066,4.808450704225352

He brings a great sense of humor and willingness to put up with Anderson. Larroquette, Moll, and Diamond and holds his own with them. Markie Post guest stars in the second episode as Christine Sullivan, but her comment to another show made her unable to do more than one episode but she feels a natural fit with Anderson and Larroquette. The rest of the season the defense lawyer is Billie Young (played by Ellen Foley) who does a nice job but she feels like a prototype for Christine Sullivan. Sadly however this would be the last season for Selma Diamond who passed away shortly after season 2 was wrapped. She gets a lot memorable scenes and jokes. The second season is an improvement over the first season. The characters are more developed and the jokes are funnier and the cast clicks a lot more.",1423008000,,935,4.63855421686747

This 1984-85 Season is also the season when New York-savvy defender Billie Young(Ellen Foley), and Vietnam vet Mac Robinson(Charles Robinson), the court clerk join the cast & crew to this sitcom in the Fall of 1984 replacing Paula Kelly as Liz Williams and Karen Austin as Harry's original love interest(Lana Wagner)whom departed the show in the Summer of 1984 after only 1 season.

On the 22-episode docket: an invisible man, a mogul madam, a lovelorn nun, hookers, pickpockets, flashers, wackos, weirdos, gonzos and great guest stars, including Michael Richards, Stella Stevens, Jack Gilford, John Astin, Lou Ferrigno and, as substitute defender Christine Sullivan(Markie Post), who became a full-time cast member in NIGHT COURT's 3rd Season when Foley was reportedly fired from the show in the Spring of 1985, due to producers feeling her relationship with Harry Anderson was more like a brother and sister one which resulted in Post being Foley's successor in its 1985-86 Season when Post was hired as a permanent co-star in the Fall of 1985.

Join the fun as Judge Harry throws the book at crime--the joke book

2584935,5,B000FTC1GW,"I forgot how much I enjoyed Night Court when it originally aired until I got this DVD set. Set in a courtroom in New York City at night (naturally), you can see the potential for the kind of oddball characters and weirdos  who seek justice... and the judge is wise-cracking, prank-pulling Harry Stone.

While Harry Anderson was a natural as Judge Harry Stone, John Larroquette also put in great performances as the sharp-tongued assistant DA. This set includes some well-written comedy episodes, with appearances by Ray Walston (My Favorite Martian), John Astin (the Addams Family), Lou Ferrigno (the Incredible Hulk) Michael Richards (Seinfeld) and Yakov Smirnov. Night Court was easily one of the best comedy series done in the 1980s and this season one of the best for that program.",1369526400,,785,5.030769230769231

2584993,5,B000FTC1GW,"My review of season one mentioned the lack of tracking. This season seems to be made a bit differently and the tracking issues are gone. (by tracking I mean going from say the theme to the start of the show after the theme). I think these are made by a different company than the first season, which is great. It looks great and still has the charm and insanity that I recall. One of my favorite shows. Cheers and Night Court was my favorite hour of tv back in the day. It's great how Mac is there from the beginning. He wasn't so much introduced as he was just shown. Which works. There is no sense that they changed from season one (even though they did with character change ups) it's almost like while we were waiting for the second season life at the municipal court building kept going on, and we just caught up with them in the fall. A great show. a bit underappreciated, but overall well loved. Glad to see the whole series coming out (there was a huge delay between season 1 & 2 ) now it's going great, they have but one more season to release. It is definitely worth checking out. While this show seems a bit insane and holds very little similarities to real life, the actors pull off the absurdity with such skill that you simply do not care. A bit over the top at times but in a fun way, not in a stupid way. Though where I grew up I've seen many strange and crazy things just not all in one room. But that's what makes this show great, you get great scripted jokes, tons of great slapstick/physical comedey as well as good character development and always always a smile. You can't walk away from this show without one. It will make u laugh. true it's a bit dated (totally 80s in some ways) It's a great show that should not be overlooked.",1361145600,,1752,4.2642642642642645
2584994,5,B000FTC1GW,Season 2 is when the show really started to come into its own. The loss of Selma the baliff was very sad but the addition of Florence filled the void. I recommend this show to anyone who loves good clean humor!,1359417600,,210,4.146341463414634

2584996,5,B000FTC1GW,"Season 2 of Night Court is a must have to anyone who was and still is a fan of the show. It was the last season that Selma (played by Selma Diamond) would be seen on the show. She passed away after this season (1985). Selma was one of the funniest members of the early years. Dont get me wrong the firsr 2 seasons were funny but the show really took off on season 3 when Markie Post and new baliff Florence (Florence Halop) joined the cast. From there on the show was golden. The only other change made was when Florence passed away after season 3 Which was written into season 4 as Bull having trouble copping with the loss of two friends ""First Selma now Roz"".So they brought in Marsha Warfield to play Roz. That cast lasted until the show ended. Oh i guess you can also add Macs wife Quon Lee. The show was so hot then everone wanted to make a  guest apperance. The shows with Mel Torme and John Astin were especially funny.
BTW, its amazing that with all the reviews that are here about the show there are not very many mentions about Selma & Florence. To me (yes i know it was only a 1/2 hour comedy) those were importment plot twists and it showed how the writers delt so well with it.",1352937600,,1191,4.178260869565217

No doubt this was hard as sometimes some tv shows are only good in the first season and they find it hard to maintain the standard or they run out of ideas; not so here. Also I found both the Season 1 and Season 2 DVD's of good quality and overall good value for money; highly recommended. P.S.

Van Dyke, etc were going to be almost the very last of good tv
we would ever to see. As the present is pretty bad and embarrassing
for the most part, we have to wonder will we ever see really good
tv again. Night Court was one of my favorites. Revisiting it after
some years a wave of nostalgia came over me at how very nice the
characters were. They cared for one another and would do anything
to help each other out. Cheers was o.k. but when I have revisited
that series, I,m more appalled than ever at Carla's meaness and
spitefulness(I know it wasn't her personally but I believe that
creating characters with mean, cruel images leads to the young
people watching it today that it is o.k. to be that way. Then we
wonder why for the most part people are more uncaring about
anyone else other than themselves in the present time.
Maybe some day the general population will return to a time of
caring for others. Wouldnt it be great if all of the young
people could view shows such as Night Court? Wouldnt hurt

It has been one of my favorites for years, and when I first started collecting TV on DVD, I was especially excited at the prospect of being able to get this one. I had hoped to buy the entire series at once, silly, naive person that I am, I thought they would want to make as much money as they could off such a BELOVED show by getting it out there so people can BUY IT!

But while I now own hundreds of seasons of TV on DVD, thanks to Warners, my grandchildren will one day be saying, ""oh look, there's the last season of that show Gram liked so much, FINALLY. Too bad she never got to see it. "" Of course they won't buy it, because they're too young to CARE. WAKE UP! It's time to get these classic series out IN THEIR ENTIRETY so those of us who love them can still buy them.

UPDATE* Well, they finally came out with all the seasons of Night Court, but I would have to mortgage my house to buy them! These TV people live in some other world, not the one I live in.

2585060,5,B000FTC1GW,"Long before Boston Legal,  there was Night Court! And the Court room has never been the same!

Night Court was a poke in the eye of the legal system and the people who do crazy things in a sane world. What ""Welcome Back Kotter"" did for education and ""Barney Miller"" did for Law Enforcement, this show does for the legal system.

for those who don't know the show (AND you should!), Harry Anderson (Dave's World)  plays Judge Harry Stone..a Judge, a Joker and glue that holds this show together. John Larroquette (long befor Boston Legal) plays Dan Fielding..Part DA, all slimy and overly sexual heel with a heart (Just don't tell anyone). Richard Moll (The voice of Two Face on Batman the Animated Series) is Bull the Batiff... a tower of strength with a child-like innocent. Selma Diamond (in her last TV role) is Selma the head Batiff who has been around and seen it all forever. Charles Robinson is Mac, Court Clerk who tries to keep the order of the docts, but never does. Ellen Foley plays defense attorney Billie...in many ways, she does not fit with the rest of the assembled cast.

Put these actors together and watch the fun mesh. I loved this show when I was younger and I still do. It is not a timeless classic of Television nor it is tasteful morsel that you will remember for decades, but it is a good sitcom. This show  is like a bawdy revue. What I mean is some jokes will make you laugh, other flop badly...but still you chuckle the way this cast makes this work. This show is situation and plot  driven, not a one yuck show

I make a comparison  with Boston Legal. However Legal is a comedy drama, but this show is a straight forward comedy with comics knowing their craft milking and mining the script for their moments to shine. Isn't that what a comedy show should be

So Warner Brothers, the question is when is season three coming?

2585088,5,B000FTC1GW,"DVD Review (Feb. 21, 2009):

""Night Court"" was a classic 80s, early 90s comedy series that should be released by WB, and fast. This second season entry doesn't disappoint. Picture and audio quality is quite good, and the 3 disc package is well conceived. The disc menu navigates seamlessly. My only regret is the lack of any additions, like interviews, bloopers, promos, etc. DVD sets should provide some historical context for those who remember these TV series fondly. Yet, the price for Season 2 is extremely economical and worth the effort. You won't go wrong buying ""Night Court"" for the many hours of enjoyment. Go for it, and hopefully WB will release subsequent seasons (Seasons 3-5 were probably the best!!)

UPDATE:  Night Court Season 2 WILL be available Feb. 3!!  Make plans to pre-order on Amazon.

OK .. it's time for the 40+ disgruntled Night Court posters on Amazon to rejoice!  Apparently, Warner Bros acknowledged Night Court, Season 2 will be available in 2009.  Please refer to the following for confirmation

[...]

Caveat:  There is NO official announcement from WB, thus the deal is not sealed; caution is advised.  However, I've found ""tvshowsondvd"" to be a very reliable source, and feel optimistic you'll be able to pre-order Season 2 on Amazon within a few months.  Hang in there gang ... Judge Harry and Dan Dan Fielding will be back in session soon ... hope there are some great extras with this release, and I hope the Season 3 release follows within one year, not 3+ years as before!!",1221523200,6,1515,4.829457364341085

I agree with other people how Season One was the least desirable and it didn't hit comedy genius level until later,but still I bought it and eagerly waited for the others. Holy crap,some of the other shows I've seen available on store shelfs are laughable(not in a good way!!) yet still no wonderful,hilarious,brilliant Night Court! Warner Bros. should be ashamed!

2585090,5,B000FTC1GW,"It's amazing to me that the entire Night Court series isn't available on DVD yet.  Look at the pedigree this show has...

* Part of the first legendary NBC Thursday Night Line-Up, along with The Cosby Show, Family Ties and Cheers.

* John Laroquette won 4 straight Emmys in a row for Best Supporting Actor for his work on the show, and probably would have won a 5th had he not asked to be taken out of consideration for the award that year.

* One of the highest-rated and most popular shows of the 80s.

The Suits at Warner Brothers complain that the 1st season set didn't sell well?  Of course it didn't!  The cast changed five times during the first season and most of the episodes are horribly uneven.  It wasn't until the second season that a rhythm began to establish itself and it wasn't really until the third season that things started rolling.

Release this set and I guarantee you'll see the sales go through the roof.",1219449600,5,929,4.449704142011834

She also wrote that without the rest of the series, she might as well send them her copy of the first as it is no good to her without them.

I agree that Warner Brothers is being a complete idiot in this case. I realize they don't care about us as people, but I thought they cared about money. Maybe I was wrong...",1218844800,5,562,4.063063063063063

YES SEASON ONE was not it's best but Wow how it improved was out of site..
I watched John Laroquette on Boston Legal (which has 3 Seasons out already)the other night and all I could think of how good he was as Dan Fielding and the rest of the Cast just kept on getting better and better.
From Season 2 onwards it was a joy to watch and funny I just could not get enough. As I am from Australia it is harder to get this message across to the dim wits that work for Warner Brothers, but there is a market for your product world wide. Australia and the World want a BOX SET OF ALL SEASONS 1-9 and not just Season 2.

2585159,5,B000FTC1GW,"I hope the less than stellar sales for the first season DVD set of Night Court are not preventing the latter seasons from being released. Night Court really struggled to find itself for the first two seasons. Once they got the final ensemble cast in place though, it clicked so well that the best way I can describe it to modern audiences is ""Scrubs"" in a 1980's courtroom instead of a hospital. There were always a couple of central themes at work in each episode between the main characters, while the interesting parade of Night Court defendants and plaintiffs made for great sight gags and one-shot humor that kept the show fast-paced and fresh.

Season two changes that are for the better include the additions of Charles Robinson as court clerk ""Mac"" and Ellen Foley as Billie, the public defender. In turn, Karen Austin as Lana Wagner and Paula Kelly as Liz Williams were deleted from the cast. With a better supporting cast, season two was more about ensemble acting and less about Harry Anderson doing his stand-up routine in a judge's robe. Once Markie Post was added to the cast in season 3, the show was pretty close to perfect for about the next four years. Thus the show had to ""jump the shark in reverse"" for the first two seasons before things were just right. Only when creator Reinhold Weege left the show at the end of season six did I notice any downturn in quality, starting with the ""softening"" of Dan Fielding.

Probably one of the best episodes of the second season was ""The Blizzard"" in which Dan (John Larroquette) is trapped in an elevator with a man who is attracted to him, while the rest of the staff is trapped inside the courthouse itself. Another good one was ""Married Alive"" when Dan starts dating a socially backwards woman who just happens to be heiress to forty million dollars. Dan's libido and money problems were a great source of comedy throughout the series.

In fact, I wasn't even going to buy the first season because of that. My husband is the one that bought me the first season.

In fact, isn't that why they replace characters on TV shows? To make people identify with the characters in the shows? So why wouldn't the people putting out the DVDs naturally assume that later episodes would do better?

But I keep missing the first seasons of it so I bought this one and season one, also. And have enjoyed every minute of the dvds. This series is a classic.",1500595200,,307,3.967741935483871

8126324,5,B000FTC1GW,"I suppose there are a few people out there who have never heard of the comedy series, Night Court, which ran from 1984 to 1992. But for those unfortunate few, they truly do not know what they are missing.

Night Court broke the usual comic mold. Most comedies are centered around a normal central character witnessing the madness around him or her. With Night Court, everyone is nuts, including Harry Anderson, who plays a judge, a figure society assumes is as solid as a rock.

What made this show so darn funny was clever, well-written scripts, the right combination of identifiable personalities (I mean, who does not know a person like Dan Fielding or Christine Sullivan?), and the choice of actors perfectly suited to match their characters, giving performances of the roles of their careers.

There was also an incredible range in its humor. While most comedy series usually find one level of banality and stay there, the comedy in Night Court covered a greater spectrum. Thus, the humor was sometimes poignant, sometimes philosophical, sometimes slapstick, farcical, or even downright dumb, many times in the same episode. The humor, though, was never boring. The humor was intelligent, smart, ... and just darn funny.

The show never really jumped the shark, even when it easily could. In the eighth season a new character, a ditzy Court Reporter, was introduced. So now there are two comic relief characters in the Courtroom, the Court Reporter and one of the Bailiffs, Bull Shannon (Richard Moll.) While introducing a new character to an established routine is usually fatal to the over-all chemistry of the cast, this new character, through deft comic script-writing, fits right in, adding, not hindering, the comic effect.

Recurring actors include John Astin, of Addams Family fame, Yakov Smirnoff, and Mel Torme, who shows incredible acting flair as Harrys idol.

For all those who have not seen this series, check it out.",1498003200,,1936,5.034375
