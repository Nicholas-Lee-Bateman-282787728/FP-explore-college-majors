7972534,1,B00006RCON,"I bought the first two volumes and then happened to see the third in the library, so I checked it out. What a disappointment!! Not only was ""Empire of Good Intentions"" missing, as others have noted, but in this third volume Mr. Schama has gone off on a tangent and apparently forgotten this is supposed to be a history of Britain, NOT a sociological review of all that was bad in the last two centuries of Britain's history. I enjoyed learning the history of Britain in the first two, but somehow, what was actually happening in Britain in the 19th and 20th centuries was subservient to Mr. Schama's liberal take on everything. I am certainly glad I did not buy volume three. It pales in comparison to the first two.",1058313600,6,716,4.515384615384615
7972535,2,B00006RCON,I'm in the same boat as other reviewers - would have rated the third part of the series much higher - but one segment was missing.  Has anyone received any sort of resolution from the History Channel?,1056844800,,200,4.405405405405405
7972536,1,B00006RCON,"I am seconding the comments by Joseph Miller (no relation). Some time ago, I telephoned Britannia and told the operator that I had received 2 volumes, not 3, and the segment on the disintegration of the Empire was missing. (This was shown in its complete format on a TV program on the History Channel, so I know whereof I speak.)",1045008000,3,329,4.5
7972537,1,B00006RCON,"Purchasers should be warned that ""A History of Britain III""
is less than promised.  This two-tape collection is missing
one of its parts.  While tape one (Volume VII) is complete,
with ""Forces of Nature"" and ""Victoria and Her Sisters,""
tape two (Volume VIII) only contains ""The Two Winstons,""
without the section titles ""Empire of Good Intentions.""
Do not purchase this set until The History Channel can
correct this serious error.",1039305600,31,431,5.142857142857143
