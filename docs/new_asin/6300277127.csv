Whatever appears on the back of the cover of the case for this VHS doesn't match up with what you see on the VHS itself, but that doesn't affect the workout in my opinion. The workout is actually simple for me.",1454889600,,259,4.098039215686274
7809355,4,6300277127,"The VHS was I I expected it to be, rather 80's (ha ha)  Kind of a blast from the past!  I had the LP album for my kids when they were little and we would all ""exercise"", if you could call it that, to the songs. One of the favorites was Ducks Dance Too!  I bought it to see if my grandson would want to dance along with grandma to it!  Wish me luck!",1427587200,,348,3.6621621621621623

7809357,5,6300277127,I watch Mousercise years ago and was so happy to find it again. I can hardly keep up with the kids but am feeling better each day.,1408492800,,130,3.8518518518518516

7809359,5,6300277127,"I came across this Gem of a video while digging through old VHS movies and I am so happy I found it!  My DD loves Mickey and dancing, I wanted to start up my work out with something that she wouldn't be bored with watching while I'm working out.  This is perfect, she is learning her coordination in trying the moves and loves seeing Mickey pop in and out.  Meanwhile I get in a full an worth while work out.  As she grows I know she will enjoy doing the full workout with me.  I Treasure this video and hope they re-release it on DVD format soon!  Nothing is more fun than working out with this 80's retro tape, a plus if you were a child of the 80's too.",1235952000,3,656,4.007692307692308
7809360,4,6300277127,"During the time Mousercise was still airing, ""Kellyn"" had one of the hottest, sexiest bodies on television.  If you like beautiful women in leotards and tights, you'll like this video.",1216166400,,184,5.133333333333334
7809361,3,6300277127,Other than the fact that Mickey pops in for a few minutes this tape is not easy to follow. The exercise program seems dangerous. I let my daughter watch it as she loves Mickey Mouse but it is not really good for exercise.,1173312000,,221,4.162790697674419
7809362,5,6300277127,Mousercise is fun to work out to even though its an old video it really makes working out fun and it works. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an excerise video for their kids or themselves.,1051056000,2,199,4.2631578947368425
7809363,5,6300277127,"The 1985 ""Mousercise"" is actually a lengthy, quality video, even though the only Disney character is ""Mickey"". But Kallyn guides preteens through a 55 minute program that includes old fashioned stretch and aerobic exercise moves. You really don't see some of these exercise moves anymore, including the ""sit-ups"". Nowadays, they are called stomach crunches and done with small pelvic moves.
In between segments she offers tips ""Health Break"" to encourage young children to incorporate exercise into their lives for their heart, lungs, endurance and thinking to aid in school sports. Coordination is also a factor here. Kellyn educates children with about importance of doing exercises correctly and on the pulse and how to take it.
The aerobics section is called ""High Performance and Peak Performance"". Aerobic moves are fun, easy to follow, and easy to do as these movements are high in aerobicizing (fast all body movements.) Included is the floor work at two separate intervals that includes leg work. A bonus is the ""Dance Section"" at the end. Youngsters dance for fun as an alternative. A few songs depart from the usual instrumental, like ""Bug A Boo"" and ""Jungle Book Boogie"", but most of the music is instrumental.
As I mentioned, this is a lengthy video that is done very well for younger children. Today, the video market is tailored for your money and they lack the 55 minute length this one has. It is fun. ....MzRizz",1015632000,11,1429,5.008403361344538
