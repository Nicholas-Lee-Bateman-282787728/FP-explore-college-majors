8482939,5,B005Q3PBMS,"After looking for this for many years, I finally got the DVD.  It was exactly as noted and arrived timely and in prime condition.",1391385600,,129,4.375
8482940,4,B005Q3PBMS,"This film has been unavailable for so long that I was excited to finally be able to get a copy.  It's not made from the best print materials I've ever seen but it's the only game in town so I'd rather have it than nothing.  I shared it with some friends recently who had never seen it  and they didn't mind that it wasn't pristine quality one bit.  It's an excellent film and for it's time I think the whole psychotherapy theme is handled much more modernly than I would have expected.  And of course the whole climactic ""Jenny Made Her Mind up""  musical extravaganza alone would be worth the price of admission.  Ginger again shows she was so much more than Fred Astaire's dancing partner and it's nice to see Jon Hall so nattily dressed.  He, Ray Milland, and Warner Baxter make a very believable triangle of ""suitors"" for Rogers and they play well off each other.  I'd love it if some day some one would remaster ""Lady in the Dark""  but until they do I'm more than happy with my copy.",1386720000,2,987,4.344262295081967
8482941,2,B005Q3PBMS,"This print was a poor copy.  Not easy to watch, would not recommend buying it.  Great expectations however, sadly disappointed.",1374969600,3,127,5.3
8482942,5,B005Q3PBMS,Amazing psychological drama with a touch of wit considering made in the 1940` s.  Ginger Rogers was wonderful as the troubled editor of a fashion magazine.,1370736000,2,155,4.961538461538462
8482943,1,B005Q3PBMS,"i recieved the copy of this dvd to find that the cover is not the one advertised - the dvd is of inferior quality and both the sound and picture leave MUCH to be desired - there is nothing to indicate that it is even a legitimate paramount release, my advice would be to avoid this product , in fact the you tube posts are better in quality than this dvd - extremely disappointed",1360281600,8,379,4.135135135135135
