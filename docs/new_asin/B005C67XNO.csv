4651523,1,B005C67XNO,"Dear Customer,

  This movie contains two storylines that feature two very unlikely couples. The first contains a preoperative female-to-male transgender person who meets and falls in love with a gay man. It seems to me that if a woman believes that she is a man and begins the process of changing into a man, then that individual would most likely want to be with a woman. In fact, the idea that a woman would begin taking testosterone so that she could become a gay man seems completely ludicrous to me.

  The second couple consists of two postoperative male-to-female transgender persons. For the same reasons,this coupling seems as unlikely to me as the first. If a man believes that he is a woman on the inside and goes to all the trouble to surgically alter himself, this individual is going to want to date a man, not another woman. Also, the idea that two people are so in love with each other that they are willing to surgically alter their appearance so that they can look alike is kind of creepy.

  Unfortunately, because of the unbelievable characters, poor cinematography, and a weak storylines I can only give this movie one star.",1357084800,2,1146,4.69
4651524,5,B005C67XNO,"Had the privilege to see OPEN at a film festival and this was such a revelation in terms of its sensitivity and sense of houmour towards its chracters. Dealing with issues of identity and beauty and featuring real transgendered actors, I was so moved by the way director Jake Yuzna gave each character an inner life and turmoil that went past just being a transgendered person, highlighting the ways we all feel alone and disconnected and how we can change that. It really belongs right up there with the debut films that Gus Van Sant and Todd Haynes made at the start of their carears. I can't wait to see more from this director, and all should see this film if you want a film that travels beyond typical cliches and familiar storylines.",1326672000,19,740,4.571428571428571

Definitely not a mainstream film but I found the acting, characters and plot (what there was of one) actually quite affecting. Slow moving, subtle and ambiguous there were moments that raised this film from the ordinary low budget fare. Subject matter may be off putting to some but I found it fascinating and truly glad I took out time to watch it.

4651539,4,B005C67XNO,"I enjoyed this movie mainly for the shock value. It was absolutely different and held my attention.  All of the characters were very interesting.

All of the characters were obviously in a lot of emotional pain, and I really felt for them. It particularly touched me when Genesis said that she made so many changes on the physical outside, but her problems and emotional pain did not go away.

The ending was not clear to me. I am assuming that Cynthia committed suicide and Sid had a baby. It was questioned whether testosterone injections would hurt an unborn baby, but the question was never answered or explained, but we can assume that Sid had a healthy baby and Nick accepted the baby. It should have been explained and it should have been mentioned whether Sid continues his transition after giving birth.

I did not understand why Sid's car accident was necessary for the story.

Genesis and Jaye were a little weird to have constant surgeries to look like twins. I could understand surgeries to look more like women, but surgeries to share each other's features was strange to me. I didn't like their intense red hair color (and I think that one or both were wigs) -- I thought that they would have looked much better with brown hair (like Cynthia's hair color). I really hated their gold teeth -- I have never seen anyone with a mouthful of golden teeth. I assume that if someone had a sex change, that the person would want to blend into society, and not stand out with bright hair and gold teeth and flashy clothes. Genesis said to Cynthia that she was afraid to go out when it is dark because of the fear of getting beat up.

Nick was the only character who appeared content with the gender that he was born with. I wondered whether Nick was bisexual, in other words, was Nick attracted to Syd as both a woman and as a man? Did Nick and Syd know each other when Syd was a woman? The movie should have explained how long they knew each other, how they met, and why Nick would be with someone transitioning.

The movie also should have explained how Genesis and Jaye met and whether they were together from the time that they were both men. They had so many surgeries together, so I wondered whether they transitioned together.

It was never mentioned what kinds of jobs these people held. Genesis and Jaye must have been doing well financially to be able to afford so many surgeries. It was mentioned that Nick and Syd did not make a lot of money, but it was never said what kind of work they did. I wondered what the employers and co-workers thought and how they were treated at work, or if they had jobs where they had to deal with clients or with the public, and how that was working out.

It was not clear to me what these people's families felt about them.

This movie needed more information and explanation and more backstory.

This movie was very interesting and very touching, and it was unusual because there are so few movies like this.",1421366400,5,2959,4.4916201117318435

The performances ranged from momentarily riveting to obnoxious to bizarre. A minor example would be the hotel clerk where the two young men (one a transman the other a cisgender man) spend the night.

4651550,4,B005C67XNO,"This film, like characters in it, is on its way, not all the way there yet; a merging of drama and documentary, it posits images of conventional beautyclouds moving across the sky, a colorful house as foreshortened landscapealong with people, men, willfully undergoing changes toward a kind and type of being they desire and hold beautifulboth unconventional. 'Open"" does, then, invite natural scenes,unmediated by humans, and urban pastoral landscapes, mediated yet not homogenized, just as it scrupulously testifies to the wonderfully sterile atmospheres in which such beauty may, at great cost to pocket and soul, be earned. Within this established setting, the unfinished men, still at work on themselves, physically and psychologically, and still being worked on, present poignantly deceptive half-way locations at which, nevertheless, full-fleged, fully human emotions blossom, sometimes explode, and witherstrange orchids without a sufficient greenhouse.
Cinematically, the movie does not dare much, nor does it need to. It's bi- status and theme are enough to engage the susceptible viewer. who will have, of course, to challenge himself/herself, I suppose, to bear the extreme of beauty/idol making itself in imitation of the Other, neither with social or aesthertc sanction. Because these men extend boundaries of behavior as well as of body, they open themselves to comic situations and attitudes: a transexual woman conceiving a baby with a gay man is tearfully laughable; the couple poignantly engaging. The result a wonderful physical, social, political conundrum.
I have read that the movie earned a deserved German awardgood, again, for the Germans!. What I prize is that it was made in the United States. The honest, wry, and subtle understanding, toned by pathos, not pity, and the highest dignified comic, not slapstick, elevate ""Open"" to a risky category of art and document. I am proud of my countrymen who have deeply etched this film into the international fresco; I salute each and every actor, technician, crew member, director, camera man for planting our flag in a New World of film that should be discovered by everyone, most especially by those who will never see it.",1389916800,4,2196,5.368115942028986

8464814,2,B005C67XNO,"Like others, I tried to like it. I tried very hard. but it can be summed up in a single word: awkward. And just to make it clear, I am an FTM Transgender person. I understand that they were trying to probably make the point that Trans people have real people problems too. The whole time I was watching it I kept wondering WHY I just didn't turn it off. I kept hoping it would make some deep point or miraculously in the end it all made sense... but it didn't. This comes across like a college student's film piece.

Warning: SPOILERS

One couple has the 'happy ending', the single person commits suicide, and the other couple obviously has a baby. The suicide is just a stupid cop-out. By the time we get to the big emotional scene preceding it all I could think of is that it was just one hair away from being a temper tantrum, like if the person caused enough of a ruckus that the uninterested person would change their mind. So. Freakin. Stupid. (I have struggled with suicide over the years so the topic itself I do not take lightly. It's just how it was handled in here that I find to be totally stupid.) But the absolutely biggest thing that ticks me off is the baby issue. Why? Because once it hit the point where the Trans guy said he didn't know if he wanted the baby (after previously expressing growing up never wanting kids) that the REST of the focus on the situation was about how the CIS GUY felt! Seriously, the Trans guy does not say ANYTHING about his feelings after that. As a Trans guy I can tell you that it would be one screwed up emotional mess for him to have to sort through even before dealing with the crippling dysphoria of dealing with a body (let alone another life) doing things that completely conflict with the internal perception of their own gender. And the last you see of the Trans guy, he's laying there in bed, massively pregnant, not talking, eyes not open, no expression at all. It just leaves me with the really sour feeling that he felt as if he had to follow the expectation placed on him by others and not what was right for him. So it really felt like the 'real (cis) man' was in control and the Trans guy would just have to be the girl because he got pregnant. This pisses me off to no end. In healthy Trans relationships, traditional gender roles normally do not apply. And they never answered the question how/if the hormones would affect the baby!

Sloppy work on the storytelling all the way around and it just ended up really strange.",1525564800,,2487,4.355603448275862
8464815,2,B005C67XNO,"I tried to like it, I really did. The timeline bothered me more than anything else. While I understand the separate stories didn't all need to be happening at the same time, this movie doesn't give any inclination that more time had passed than a few days. The biggest issue I had with the timeline was Syd's pregnancy. I mean, he's laying in the hospital very obviously pregnant and the eye injury from his accident is still bleeding indicating that it's still new but when he was hit, he was not showing at all. It just didn't make sense. Also, don't any of these people have jobs?? I get it's an art piece and doesn't have to make complete sense but it could have been a bit more relatable and offered a bit more in the way of these people's normal lives. My other major problem was the acting. I'm sorry but it wasn't good. It wasn't believable at all. I am assuming that's why each scene either had no talking at all or 2-4 lines of dialogue. It made it very hard to connect with the characters and impossible to feel anything for them. You get no sense of who they are. Since there really is no plot to speak of, no consistant timeline, and minimal dialogue you feel left a little cheated at the end. I spent over an hour watching it and wasn't able to take anything away from it. I did give 2 stars though for the artistic attempt the director took with this film. I feel like I can't credit the writer anything because the script must have been about 5 pages long, at most but some of the scenes were shot in a nice way and I feel the director did the best he could with what he was given to work with. I also thought the characters seemed like they could have been interesting, if I had been given a chance to see them developed more in the film.",1522800000,,1755,4.226190476190476

8464821,3,B005C67XNO,"The story is American as apple pie. It's about the extra/unordinary lives of trans-people. The irony of them. They are saving the world from the tyranny and destruction of binary thinking (male/female), yet still long to be part of that oppressive system, while struggling to free themselves from it. In the film, a trans man gets pregnant by his bi-sexual lover. The trans man cannot escape his femaleness despite having removed his breasts and grown a beard (extraordinary!). But all they can talk about is about arrangements for living together and healthcare (unordinary!). I couldn't have been anymore engrossed in this film -- it is photographic -- a slideshow of carefully composed shots. It's a poem weaving simple visual and auditory narratives about trans sexuality among other things, life. The story is sweet, funny, bizarre, incoherent, suspenseful and utterly slow. It waxes and wanes because after ""shocking"" reveals, there is no urgency. The characters just wait for the phone to ring. They stare into space, have meaningless conversations. It's as if it's easy to be a trans person in America. There is no conflict other than self-acceptance. Yet, that is the one of the biggest struggles of trans people, which the film poignantly portrays. Cynthia, one of the main characters, you can't take your eyes off of and she evokes much sympathy from the viewer. We are invested in her plight. If only the rest of the cast was that good (lines were butchered: no intonation, inflection or purpose). Nick is the second most empathetic character and he's not even trans.  He was more likable than the other three trans characters. Was that intentional? In the end, this might have been a better movie if the actors hadn't been asked to act. However, I see the point. Trans people have to perform a gender -- masculine, feminine -- a persona that doesn't come easily to them because they've been the opposite gender for so many years. The actors struggle with these characters though these are their true-life stories being told. The whole ensemble reiterates the idea that identity is not easily defined. The movie is a film student's final project -- bad lighting, contradictory shots/images/ideas, shoe-string budget -- but it's still one of the best films I've seen in years.
