8168996,3,B000053VQG,"Maki, Reimi, and Yuka are office bound traffic cops most of the time, but they get into the action on occasion, even when they're told to butt out, so eager are they to prove themselves. Maki, the blond-haired siren of the group is beautiful but is not above blowing a suspect's head off while in hot pursuit on her souped-up motorcycle. Reimi is cooler and more composed but also resorts to violence when she feels intruded upon by Banba, one of her co-workers who seems to have feelings for her. She's pretty apt to give him a bone-crushing punch instead of a kiss! Yuka is more worldly than she lets on but is apt to fall flat on her face if even a slight breeze ruins her klutzy balance. The girls take it upon themselves to investigate a recent rash of young female abductions which leads to a hot nightclub, owned by an influential playboy named Samuel McCoy. When Yuka is taken captive by the slavers, the kid gloves come off and the body army and heavy firepower come on.

Girls with Guns. Yes, we all know this genre, but its constant challenge is be entertaining even though the storylines can only go so far down the road of originality. Burn Up is a pretty good tale and really puts the characters personalities across in a short span of 45 minutes. Most one shots like this fail, but this one actually shines in its brevity. Even though the anime is around 15 years old, it is still very good for being made so long ago. Good start of a franchise that includes Burn Up W, Excess, and Scramble.

There are no extras on the DVD. I would also recommend the anime Miami Guns which cuts out the drama and ratchets up the comedy into a hilarious mix.",1136419200,,1657,4.394136807817589
8168997,5,B000053VQG,"The origonal BURN-UP! video is finally on DVD! YES! O.K., for those of you who've never seen it before, it has NOTHING to do with the BURN-UP W, X-CESS, or recent SCRAMBLE series. the characters and story are all completly independant, although there are simular themes.

The scene is Tokyo, sometime in the not-too-distant-future. Women are being kidnapped off the streets and forced to become sex slaves for some rich, amoral men. (Despite such mature themes, this isn't an X-rated hentai title, though there are some definete adult-only moments, probably a title for 17 and older.) Three female traffic cops-impulsive, hot-tempered Maki, cool, level-headed Reimi, and ditzy Yuka-decide to do some under cover work, with the help of Maki's boyfriend/co-worker Kenji and his partner Banba, by going to a nightclub where many recent kidnappings have occured, and trying to lure the criminals out. But their plans backfire and Yuka ends up as the latest kidnap victim! The next day new evidence shows millionare Samuel McCoy as the mastermind behind the whole plot, but because he has powerful friends in high places, the police cheif says simply that there's nothing they can do. Maki and Reimi can't just leave it at that, so putting both their lives and their jobs at risk, they steal some body armor suits and heavy weapons and a police tank and set out to McCoy's to rescue Yuka and the rest of the kidnapped girls.

Lots of action, humor, and hot anime babes. (Though their breasts are nowhere near as exaggeratedly large as Rio's from the later BURN-UP series.) Also, the dub features long-time voice acting vets such as Tiffany Grant as Maki and Amanda Winn as Reimi. (Sadly, nether Amanda Winn nor the woman who does the voice of Yuka work for ADV anymore.)",1109376000,4,1765,4.8996655518394645
