2470495,5,B000CR7R7K,"Funny, witty, poignant, romantic, sensitive! A wonderful coming-out film AND rated PG-13, making it easily accessible to ALL age groups!",1140998400,,136,5.85
2470496,4,B000CR7R7K,"Writer/director/producer Tennyson Bardwell is definitely a talent to watch.  In his first venture into film, DORIAN BLUES, he has created an intelligent script with razor sharp dialogue, witty and acerbic and touching depending on the moment, and has cast his film with a fine groups of actors who obviously hold him in great respect, as the final product is a polished film that is always entertaining as well as informative.  Few 'coming out' films flesh out the territory as succinctly and realistically as this.

Dorian Lagatos (a fresh and talented Michael McMillian) is sour on the world that doesn't understand him.  His family is the microscope on his world: a right wing radical father Tom (Charles Fletcher), a seemingly ditsy but subservient mother Maria (Mo Quigley), and a brother Nicky (another bright and hunky talent Lea Coco) who is everything Dorian isn't - a jock, a ladies' man, and a happy-go-lucky high schooler. Dorian has an 'epiphany': he discovers the reason he doesn't fit in is that he is gay!  With his discovery he finds some solace from another edgy gay friend Spooky (Austin Basis) but still feels he must remain in the closet.  Finally he confides in Nicky who surprisingly listens to him and accepts him - just so long as Dorian doesn't act out. Frustrated, Dorian leaves for New York for college while Nicky wins a sports scholarship to another college.  In New York Dorian finds the gay life, feels 'normal' at last,  falls in love, confronts rejection and the games people play, and then lives a despondent life until Nicky visits him: Nicky has lost his scholarship.  The two brothers make the rounds of Dorian's milieu until they receive a phone call that their father has died.  Returning home Dorian must still face his anger at his father, though dead, and it is this anger that his mother (far more sensitive than Dorian ever knew) confronts Dorian and the message of the movie is completed in a very realistic and understanding way.  Life's philosophy is not wholly bound to one's sexual preferences.

Michael McMillian and Lea Coco both give notice of being young gifted actors to watch. And the apparently 'film inexperienced' Charles Fletcher and Mo Quigley deliver radiant cameo roles.  Indeed the entire supporting cast is excellent, perhaps due to the fact the Bardwell is a fine director!  This is a gay coming out film that is intelligent, free of the usual visuals that distract the general audience, and one that has more healthy bits of psychology scattered throughout than many a feature film.

Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, February 06",1140652800,,2595,4.944700460829493

2470505,5,B000CR7R7K,"If you need a quirky, intimate, involving look at how one young man conquers his coming out experience, this is it. The characterizations  (particularly the protagonist's older brother) ring true and it tells an old story in a refreshing way.",1408924800,,242,5.05
2470506,3,B000CR7R7K,"You can sense how the story was inspired to some extent by a real person given how fleshed out things are in terms of the characters. There are a lot of rich interconnections between the various characters that keep the story fairly tight and nicely compelling. Too many times we encounter far too many characters thrown into the narrative blender and the result is a lot of weak character development that ultimately hurts the story as well.

The core conflict here is a common one among gay men, especially when their families do not appear to be 100% supportive of who they are. And as complex as such cases may be in reality, I think the movie managed to capture things decently well in a way that conveyed a lot of the hardships in a light and still entertaining manner without overwhelming the viewer with too much mental and emotional baggage. And not, the conflict was not just about Dorian and his father, but ultimately Dorian and his ability to accept the truth of who he is and what this may mean to other people.

The brother angle was a nice one - a good transition between trying to fit in with the views of your peer group in terms of gender stereotypes but at the same time recognizing the importance of family. Nicky had his own share of dealing with this odd dichotomy to their shared lives and it was conveyed well enough in terms of both the writing and the actual acting performance.

The movie ends on a bit of an abrupt note, but given how much had been invested in prior story development, I can understand how that was ultimately a safe enough place to end the story. I can't say that this is my favorite LGBT movie of all time - it certainly had its share of issues in terms of overall direction for scenes or even balancing the humor with the drama.

At its core, Dorian Blues has a good story to tell - a story whose value comes from how real it feels and how close to home it can be for many gay men out there. The comedic bits are there to try and lighten the mood a bit, but there are still some compelling questions raised in this story.",1403740800,,2070,4.341085271317829

I thought it was just going be another one of those Boy-meets-boy-discovers-first-love-has-enlightened-moment-lives-happily-ever-after positive positive positive type movies... Not even close! Some of that happens, yes. And it does end on a positive note, of sorts. But nothing like I thought it would be. It was more... Realistic. And I actually wound up liking it a whole lot better because it doesn't have that ""OH, Kyle, we're so happy to have a gay son!"" vibe to it. There is a lot that actually does Not work out in this movie. But it isn't the end of the world for the kid either. It's just life happening, repeatedly.",1386806400,2,667,4.911504424778761
2470510,4,B000CR7R7K,"This is a stormy story of a young man's relationship with his father Tom (Steven Fletcher) and his warm relationship with his brother, Nicky (Lea Coco) the only person to give Dorian (Michael McMillian) the support that he desperately needs. This film for the most part is really well done with a great cast and dialogue. It sticks to the theme in the title and most of it is very blue, although Dorian's shirt is definitely fuchsia!
Early in the film where Nicky is smoking a cigar, is way out of place and just should not have been there, and one of the final scenes when Dorian is suddenly a cigarette smoker just didn't look right. The character of Dorian is a bit of a loser, but he is not that much of a loser! Overall a better than average movie!",1385510400,,753,4.347517730496454

2470513,4,B000CR7R7K,"This is a gay stream of consciousness, coming of age movie. Dorian has a homophobic doctrinaire father, a housewife mother with a spiked mullet who is dominated by her husband, and an all-star athlete brother. Dorian is not athletic, likes fashion, wears fuscia shirts, and he's.... Being baled out by your younger brother may save your hide but does nothing for your ego.

Due to the restrictions placed on child actors most high school parts are played by adults. Michael McMillian was 25 when he played Dorian. Lea Coco who played his younger brother was a year older. The movie has humour and pathos. The turnaround occurs when jock Nicky visits his brother in NYC and breaks down crying in the night because he's lost his athletic scholarship. It takes the death of their father to make a man out of Dorian and supply some surprise revelations from his mother.

Surprisingly good production given the genre, better than average. Rather amusing encounters between Dorian and the seamstress's mannequin in therapy.",1370390400,,1017,4.976470588235294

2470517,4,B000CR7R7K,"To me, Dorian Blues presented a light-hearted take on coming out of the closet yet, at the same time, brought to light the emotional roller-coaster that most of us have to ride on at some stage or another when sweeping our closets clean of our gay skeletons. Totally devoid of gratuitous male nudity, the producers did a good job of presenting a rather tired coming out theme in a very different light - finding oneself doesn't always lead to true love although, if one wants to find true love, one certainly needs to find oneself first. While it may not be the most memorable gay-themed movie I've ever watched, it's certainly worth watching.",1346716800,2,643,4.699115044247788
2470518,5,B000CR7R7K,This movie had several moving moments. This is a sad but true gay movie. It is hard to come out and then not be accepted by those you love and you think love you in return. I have watched this movie several times and am never dissapointed. You won't be either.,1325980800,,260,4.117647058823529
2470519,3,B000CR7R7K,I am not too impressed with is this movie.  I was expecting more acting but all I got was a story from Dorian's point of view.  It is not a movie that I will watch again.,1320451200,,170,3.6944444444444446
2470520,5,B000CR7R7K,"Dorian has a problem.  He realizes he's gay and isn't sure he wants to be.  He does have a supportive brother, so there's that.  He's discovered a counselor - a gay one that assures him he's fine.  But Dorian wants kids.  So there's church and the Bible.  That'll fix him.  Or the stripper will.

Or maybe there's just reality.  The reality that he didn't have a choice.  He is who and what he is.  There's the reality that he has to tell his dad because he isn't hiding anymore.  Of course Dad is old school (this takes place in the 70s) - think Archie Bunker meets Red Foreman of That 70s Show.  Dad sees Dorian as the lesser son already.  He's not athletic like his brother.  He once dared to question his dad's political tirades.  Dorian has a poster of JFK in his room.  He's clearly a moron.  Dad is always right.  Dad knows being gay is a choice and an immoral one at that.  Dorian pretty much hated his father before he knew he even realized that he was gay.  His mother is spacey and oblivious.  But Dorian is about to head off to NYU, to the best city in the world, especially for a boy like him.  So hey, even if telling dad goes as bad as he expects it will, who cares?  The time is now.

But sometimes life doesn't go how you expect it to.  Well, except for telling dad.  That is, of course, a disaster.

Not really a comedy.  Not really a drama.  Much like real life, it's a tad of everything.  Having watched friends in my lifetime have to drop out of school over similar situations, feeling as though they have to move, etc this one hits a bit close to home.  It's not really a ""gay story"" though I can see the anti-gay folk not appreciating this movie.  It is more about being who you are, trying to find yourself, family problems, life in general.  Dorian's issues in life just happened to stem from the fact that he is gay and wanted so desperately to find acceptance from others (especially his dad).  So while yes, it hits home to those of us who love people who have gone through this and yes I realize I am sort of contradicting myself here - it is definitely a movie for people who care about gay issues but it's also totally NOT about that at the same time and if you're someone who is willing to just accept gay and straight characters both then it's really just a life story that anyone who has been a little lost could relate to.",1300924800,,2357,4.2202247191011235
2470521,5,B000CR7R7K,"This is a wonderful, wonderful story! Execellent all around. I've bought this as a gift for many friends.  It will make you laugh and cry!! It has become one of my favorites!!!!!!!!",1289692800,,181,4.65625
2470522,5,B000CR7R7K,"I like this movie since it's probably the first gay themed movie where I like better the non-gay character, Nicky (Lea Coco), Dorian's brother. He has a development in the movie that is wonderful, starting anyway from a point where, even if he can't understand his brother, he never leaves him alone.

Dorian's himself is a good character, above all since it's not an ""always"" right gay teenager; he is suffering from his situation, but he is also mistaking. Even when he is in college and finally free, he is easily driven to mistake but his tendency to not analyze his situation. He is clinchy and envious. And I liked him for that reason.",1278288000,,641,4.62280701754386
2470523,4,B000CR7R7K,"Unlike many movies, Dorian Blue has a script which is masterful, whimsical and moving. It transcribes the average, delves into the real, and supports the actors in such a way as to make the movie an overwhelming emotional success. You laugh, you cry and you rage against the absurdity of how being 'gay' would influence relationships to the extent that it does. The inherent tragedy of Dorian's relationship with his father is made self evident throughout the movie, and as an observer you cannot help but feel the struggle within. The perversity of denial, and the horror of removing oneself from the life of your child, is by far the most ignorant, destructive and selfish decisions a parent can make. Yet Dorian emerges as a self assured, stable young man, determined to make his life a success.

The movie could have been very dark, yet through the use of humor the writers have taken a subject as serious as any other, and communicated their message in manner which leaves the audience raw but enamored. The movie is beautifully written, and has an endemic intelligence which transcends many within the comedy genre. The acting is superb, although special mention must be made of the lead

If one judges a movie by the impact it has on you once you have left the theater, then this is one which will certainly inspire. It lingers for days after you have seen it, and the message (or more accurately the many messages) resound within you both as a challenge and as a call to change.

An excellent movie, well deserving of any collection.",1277856000,,1541,4.721189591078067
2470524,5,B000CR7R7K,"I love this movie. I've seen it a dozen times and it always delights me with its truth.  Wonderful acting, direction and script.  Coming out has never been more fun.

2470525,5,B000CR7R7K,"I was pleasantly surprised that I liked this film as much as I did. When something is touted as a sort of ""gay Napoleon Dynamite"", I thought: ""Uh-oh...a disaster!"" But it's actually sharp & funny, thanks to a good script, good directing & good performances (Matthew McMillian is a real find, perfect as the sexually conflicted oddball Dorian; and Steven Fletcher is dead-on as Dorian's political-minded, opinionated & intimidating father). I liked the way the relationship between the two brothers was portrayed (as two worlds colliding, struggling to understand, but still ""bros""). And of course, ""Dorian Blues"" does have that weird bent for profoundly funny moments (Dorian getting seduced by a nerd; fighting his jock brother to prove he's not a ""sissy""; contending with school bullies; getting into a dangerous situation with a psychotic trick; and dippy therapy sessions). I remember my teen years, and like Dorian, there were some achingly awkward moments I wished I could erase from existence!
DB is original enough to be engaging, empathic enough to be insightful, and delightfully off-center enough to be funny throughout.",1254009600,2,1131,5.288888888888889
2470526,3,B000CR7R7K,"Dorian Blues is a coming out story which will probably resonate with a number of gay males who struggled in coming out. I thought this would be more humorous than it was. The cover likens it to Napoleon Dynamite, which in my opinion, it was nothing like (minus an entertaining goofy dance scene which was more embarassing than anything). The acting was good and by ""gay movie"" standards this one was pretty decent. Its a renter though, it was just okay",1224115200,,452,4.592592592592593
2470527,4,B000CR7R7K,"This is probably a three star movie, but it touched me, so I added a star. Not a great movie by any means, this is a small, honest film. This is a believable coming of age story. A nice way to spend an hour and a half.",1206835200,,218,3.6595744680851063
2470528,4,B000CR7R7K,"*Dorian Blues* is a decent coming-of-age of a young gay man that is enjoyable to watch.  For a low-budget film, this one does the job pretty good.

The movie starts off with Dorian as a high schooler.  He soon realizes that he's gay when he challenges his debating father during one of their traditional, monotonous family dinners.

Of course, Dorian needs to talk to someone about his sexuality.  He tries with his penny-rolling mother but she's just in her own world.  He lucks out when he's referred to a gay counselor.  In addition, the only other person in his family who knows, supports and protects him is his younger, beefy brother.

Eventually, Dorian works up the courage to come out to his father, which doesn't turn out well.  Evicted, Dorian starts his new life in New York.  Meanwhile, his younger brother is left behind and eventually goes to college.

Life seems ordinary for Dorian, being his own self.  However, what Dorian doesn't realize is that he has grown up to be just as bitter as his father, whom he despises yet loves.

Everyone in the film has done a good job.  My favorite were the brothers' interactions.  I thought it was an interesting twist of the younger brother protecting the older brother, especially during high school.

Overall, good movie filled with comedy, romance and of course, drama.",1202169600,,1328,4.784140969162996
2470529,4,B000CR7R7K,"There is nothing new and novel about DORIAN BLUES that hasn't been done countless times before both dramatically (DOING TIME ON MAPLE AVENUE) and comedically (THE WONDER YEARS) in coming out or coming of age films. The usual teen angst,anxiety,one dominant parent,one submissive parent,anger,rage and awkwardness is all there. This time, though, there are some pretty effective actors to make this not just another teen gay or straight movie. Michael Mc Millian and Lea Coco,both graduates of the Carnegie Mellon Institute of Drama,team up to play the awkward Dorian and his jock-brother who both live in a household ruled by a Mussolini-type father know-it-all (a brilliant and explosive Steven Fletcher) and a ""penny rolling,enabling doormat of a mother (Mo Quigley, a Mink Stole lookalike!)
Where this film shines is in the ensemble acting of these principles. Each actor has a good idea of their character and do excellent jobs in their respective roles. This film is at it's weakest with a script of very funny and clever scenes that jump rather quickly giving us snapshots into lives instead of gradual growth of each character. High points are hit, but unfortunately each character remains underdeveloped and caricatures. Writer/director Tennyson Bardwell known for his television sitcom work has given a similar treatment here,but extending the sitcom to a mid-length feature. Still,all in all, this is a delightful and winning piece of work for what it is, and we learn never to say ""Fabulous."" Though Dorian's ""coming out"" is the central focal point, a look at family dysfunction is well treated here with which anyone could identify. It is the likeability factor that allows me to rate this film 4 ****'s. The film is totally pleasant and enjoyably humorous.",1195603200,,1769,5.188811188811189

Dorian has 3 main hardships.  At home his dad has a nuke-a-gay-whale attitude that make republicans seem like Green Peace activists.  High-school he is trying to avoid bodily harm, not because he is gay, but because he is nerdy.  And then there is the gay factor.  We follow him from high school to college, and see his therapy in between.  It is all funny from start to finish, with a few sober moments.  This is a must see.  If you can't afford it, then rent it, or convince a friend to.  It's not a bunch of pretty boys and naked bodies.  It's a real movie, with a real plot, great acting, and super funny.",1179792000,2,764,4.236111111111111

It just didn't put ,as other reviewers said, enough good things about gay people ,it said all the bad things but in a realistic way. The thing I hated about the movie was that the gay son always wanted his fathers approval and still talked to him after he was kicked out and disowned, not real. But this movie does provide some real takes on gay people still wanting to come out and how these people want their real life scenarios to end up. I wished that Dorian had found a prince after all the struggling and gloom, he reminded me of myself. The best scene was in the bar when his best friend took his ex and how real they were about not wanting to change as gay people. Overall, I don't think the movie had enough gay parts in it it seemed to be for conservative types.",1174780800,2,835,4.192546583850931
2470532,3,B000CR7R7K,"How to say this movie is trite and boring without seeming too harsh?  How I wanted to like this movie, which has about one likeable character (the straight brother) and focuses on a whining, irritating, immature, dullard who is surprised (?) to discover that he is gay.  I actually felt a little offended that this character is confused and unsuccessful at everything ""because"" he is gay?  I didn't know it was a handicap.

It moves along fairly well as the ill-conceived mini-skits pass along.  The film-maker barely makes an effort to tie them together.  And, in the end, everybody comes to their senses and has strength and wisdom that they have totally lacked throughout the whole movie, except one character, the totally unlikeable and one-dimensional father, dies.  You don't really feel that sad.

The acting is generally passable and only occasionally reminds you of a high school play.  The sound is decent, the shots nice, and the story okay, although rife with stereotypes and botched screwball twists (like the S&M date scene.)  I've seen this movie compared to ""Edge of Seventeen,"" and the comparison holds with regard to a kind of pathetic central character who can't quite figure out that he's gay.  I didn't much care for that movie, and this one isn't any better or worse.

Certainly worth a rental.  There are many superior gay movies and coming out movies to see first, including Latter Days, Gone But Not Forgotten, Big Eden, and Mambo Italiano, to name just a few.",1169942400,2,1485,4.868525896414343
2470533,5,B000CR7R7K,"This is a great movie. I don't want to overstate my review and raise expectations beyond reach, but this film is a gem in ""coming out"" films. It introduces two very hot young actors, Michael McMillian and Lee Coco. Both give outstanding performances in their roles. I was deeply impressed with their level of professional acting abilities. So realistic, as are the portrayals of the typical middle class family who are trying to deal with accepting a gay son. The plot is awesome. (never use the word ""fabulous"", it sounds too gay, try saying ""awesome""...... quote from movie). I found myself very much relating to this family, and my own ""coming to terms"" with my sexual identity. There are a couple spots where I felt the mothers character was a little overdone, and the dad's as well, though both actors were very good in their roles. There is a nice mix with reality, and fantasy. Reality in the depiction of the classic family, and the harsh struggles of being gay, fantasy in respect to the brother/brother relationship, and every gay guys dream of having that kind of relationship with his VERY attractive brother. Brothers who are also the best of friends is a very nice touch for this film. It is also refreshing to see a film where the YOUNGER brother is the one looking out for the OLDER. Nice twist. The quality of ""Dorian Blues"" was very very good all the way around. I have read the reviews of other reviewers who try too much to imitate Siskel and Ebert, or overdue their ""intellectual"" image. Ignore them, if you are a typical person viewing this film for entertainment instead of flattering yourself with your ""critic persona"", you will like this film. One of the all time favorite ""coming out"" or ""coming of age"" films I've seen. Very dramatic, very realistic, and very easy to relate to if you yourself have ever struggled with you own sexual identity. In all fairness however, I did have one beef with this one. That is the mixture of sexual identity and politics. I would like to see film makers get away from this and accept the fact the gay people come from every political spectrum. It is not so one-sided, as they like to depict. Other than that, I highly recommend this film and hope you enjoy it as I did. Be sure to watch to the DVD extras which include a couple deleted scenes and a few good trailers.",1161907200,3,2330,4.589928057553957

But as a movie I expected to be just a fluffy, silly low-budget comedy, Dorian Blues managed some surprising about of emotional depth.

The largest part of the reason is star Michael McMillian, who manages to never be anything else than appealing even when playing the depths of neuroses.  His wide-eyed enthusiam goes a long way towards elevating what could ordinarily be a paint-by-numbers gay indie movie.  This is a gem in more ways than one.

2470536,3,B000CR7R7K,"This title is a fairly good story that has no replay value.  The character development takes too long and most of the humor is dark.  But, it is also more real to life than most movies of the genre.

The basic story follows two brothers from high school to college who are completely opposites...in all aspects of life.  It details the affects of an over bearing father figure on the brother's lives and ends with the funeral of the father (or begins as this is one of the first scenes of the movie).

Definitely a good movie to rent on a slow night, but I doubt anyone will want to watch it over again.",1156118400,4,603,4.254385964912281

2470538,5,B000CR7R7K,"For me the two main essentials that can make or break a film are first, the actors and, a close second, the writing. I'm happy to report DORIAN BLUES has the finest of both, in spades.

The cast, even down to the smallest roles, is uniformly excellent. A pleasant surprise when so often the acting in indie/low budget films is appalling, leaving one to assume that the director cast all his friends regardless of their lack of talent.

Michael McMillian as Dorian, is completely winning. Sort of Topher Grace-ish. Kinda cute but not distractingly so. Not in the least effeminate or outrageously quirky, yet still convincing as a gay character who sees himself as a misfit. He pulls off quite a few terrific comic moments but handles the dramatic stuff fairly admirably as well. And Lea Coco as Nick, his handsome jock brother, is an absolute revelation. Everyone - the boys' parents (particularly the thankless role of the father - a right wing conservative bully), Dorian's college friends, an understanding stripper, a wise therapist - all wonderful.

The storyline is completely unique for a coming out film, primarily because it's so much more than that. This is not a film about a teen learning to accept his homosexuality (which he does, fairly early on, and without too much fanfare). It is not about a virgin's quest for his first sexual experience (which is dispatched quickly, humourously...and off camera). And it's not about his achieving the acceptance or respect of his father (which he does not). It's about a young man coming to terms with the fact that he has turned out bitter, mean, sarcastic and angry - just like his father, whom he despises. The writing sparkles with wit and originality. There was nary a cringe-worthy moment in the dialogue where I was left thinking, ""But people don't actually say things like that."" It all sounded intelligent and natural.

Additionally, the film managed to buck several big gay film cliches and was emotionally richer for it. In particular, the relationship between the brothers, Dorian and Nick, was unbelievably well done. Nick is the first one Dorian comes out to and he accepts him fairly quickly yet with a realistic amount of reserve - considering he's only a high school junior, and a popular athlete at that. Their loving, supportive, occasionally combative, relationship is one of the finest (and refreshingly cliche-free) depictions of two brothers (straight, gay or otherwise) that I have ever seen on film. I don't want to go into a huge amount of detail but I think the folks who write for some of the more strident, polemical LGBT TV shows could learn alot from Tennyson Bardwell, the writer/director of this lovely, funny and moving little film.",1147996800,44,2720,4.919389978213507
2470539,4,B000CR7R7K,"I liked this movie. But if you're looking for five star directing and story, this isn't it.  I just enjoyed it's simple and basic story of coming out.  I identified with the main character in many ways, as I'm sure many gay males will at that age.  It is certainly better than many gay-themed movies I've seen.",1146355200,4,310,4.4035087719298245
2470540,5,B000CR7R7K,"It's rare to find a film that is a near perfect blend of humor and seriousness.  This is one of those rare films.  What's truly awesome about the humor and seriousness of this film is how these two opposing forces blend seamlessly.

Every topic, every scene, every character is a well balanced blend of subtle humor and seriousness.  There are so many clever and surprising touches that make this film great.  One of my favorite scenes is when Dorian tells his mother he wants to talk and she replies ""Well, sit down and talk.""  Then she gets up and walks away.  Dorian is surprised by what his mother said(implies she will listen) and the viewer is surprised by the action of her walking away.

Dorian and Nicky have a typical brother to brother relationship.  The interaction of the two after Dorian comes out is priceless.  Nicky is at once accepting and at other times acts like a typical jock.  The dancing scene with a school mate is hilarious.  The dancing scene with the stripper is touching.

Steve Fletcher is great as the typically stern, unaccepting, close minded, Republican father.  Fletcher is a great actor who I've missed seeing since his days on One Life To Live.  The final irony of the film surrounds the death of the father.  The news that Dorian is gay didn't trigger an immediate heart attack....it was the news that Nicky lost his football scholarship that did it.  It is also very telling when Dorian and his father talk about AIDS.  This conversation cracks the father's hard and harsh facade and shows that he does care.

The movie soundtrack is awesome too.

Overall, this is one truly excellent film.  Sure it is another coming of age/coming out story, but this one contains the perfect blend of important issues blanketed in easy humor and that's priceless.",1145664000,22,1787,4.718446601941747
2470541,3,B000CR7R7K,"I wanted to like this film, I really did but was in the end disappointed. The story was uneven and not well developed in many parts. In some instances, the character Dorian was made out to be the bad guy and the family and friends who crapped on him are portrayed as cool people. For example, there is one scene where Dorian, already in the depths of despair over breaking up with his boyfiend, finds out that his boyfriend is now dating one of his closest friends and he is just supposed to get over it.

I particularly detested the character of the father. He was a totally despicable human being and I was frankly glad when he died. I have known more than my fair share of people like that in my life and the world would be a much better place without people like that in it. I also hated that doormat of a mother.

I gave this movie 3 stars instead of 2 because I did think the film had potential.",1145232000,5,901,4.172413793103448

  It is a real movie and a really really good movie -- top quality acting and production.  The two brothers are charming and captivating in their own very different ways but their relationship is truly amazing and interesting.  Both actors do a superb job in their performances.  I did not want the story to end and left the film yearning to learn more about each brother and how their lives progressed.

  It is the rare movie that left me wishing there is a sequel.  Since there is not one, I yearn to see more films by the actors that play the brothers.  They were that good!!

  Hardly no sex but it has a real story line that says something.  Ok, it might not be the best film ever made but it is really very very good, and sorry to say it, but for a U.S. ""gay"" movie (this genre is still getting off the ground in the U.S. -- see Ventura Pons and Francois Ozon for really great films) it is one of the best.",1143676800,7,974,4.161290322580645
2470543,4,B000CR7R7K,"what makes this movie so likable is its ability to show some of the trials and tribulations that people go through when they finally come to the realization that they are gay.  granted not everyone that comes out experiences the same situations but i think that this movie gives a well rounded perspective of all the reactions that are possible in this type of situation.  dorian is an interesting character, i liked him because i really think that i got an idea for who he was in this movie.  he was very confused and unsure of himself until one day there came a point where he declared who he was to himself and i can certainly relate to that aspect of the process.  it takes a lot of guts to admit who you are, not to mention the fact that it is even harder to tell your family.  i loved the brother in this movie, because at one point he is very stereotypical while at the same time is the coolest most understanding brother someone could ask for.  the dynamic between dorian and his brother is an interesting one because at one point his brother accepts him and wants to support him while just as fast his brother is trying to help him become ungay, the sad thing is that dorian goes along with it.  reason being that he feels that religion is the answer and tries to change himself.  traditionally many people attempt to use religion to cure themselves, thankfully your true self typically overpowers religious ideals and dorian accepts himself for sure.  the father in this movie is very typical on some accounts especially with his attitude and misunderstandings of what it means to be gay.  he believes that dorian will die of AIDS and that is the only way his son will end up.  for a while i worried for dorian just because it almost came to pass that he would turn into the typical gay man, but i think that the movie won't allow dorian to come to a horrible fate because in reality there are a lot of us that arise from coming out a stronger person and more self assured.  this is a simple movie that presents a blanket statement of the issues facing people coming out and i think that it does a very good job and presents a very good and positive perspective.",1143244800,4,2172,4.389027431421447
2470544,3,B000CR7R7K,"PROBABLY SPOILERS++++++++++PROBABLY SPOILERS++++++++++PROBABLY SPOILERS

A number of good things (one not so) have been said by the 5 reviewers preceding me, particularly about acting levels and the ""realness' achieved in picturing a gay teen's environment at the beginning of the 1990's. I can't disagree with those points in the least, but do feel the need to express the following less than positive observations.

No notable bettering in this film of 1998's very well done ""Edge of Seventeen."" One would think, seven or so years after that earlier production, the bar would have crept higher.

While ""Dorian Blues"" does have lots of what I'll call 'cutesy' (the lead, himself, being particularly so), elsewhere there's definitely an 'OVERmuch' amount (film's first half) of:

--A Dad who could be best described as a 'Mean Ole' one & A Mom who could essentially be labeled as 'Mummified' (Mom only comes into her own at film's end........as does Dad, for that matter / LOL).

--A L'il Brother who enjoys the position of the ""Better-than"" son (even if he is presented as generally supportive of Dorian and possibly his best ally).

Sadly, what there's an 'UNDERmuch' amount of is time spent on Dorian's New York City escapades (and I don't mean those with visiting brother-from-home.........well, this movie is supposed to be gay, for Pete's sake).

At bout's end, ""Edge of Seventeen"" remains the winner.

PS: Not much 7-years-progress evident to us in the on-screen romance department either: one very timid kiss. (Oh, I see, you don't look for 'that kind' of scene in any romance film, gay or straight. Interesting.)

2470545,5,B000CR7R7K,"If you assume movies are like their trailers, then seeing the trailer for Dorian Blues will fool you. I expected a light comedy of little substance. Actually, the film is comedic but with a lot of sincere heart tossed in as well.

The surprising thing about Dorian Blues is how well written and well acted it is. Since this is about Dorian accepting his being gay, you'd think the familiarity of the subject matter would prevent anything original happening. This is not true. Because the script is so well realized, the characterizations are focused and true to life. Helping this along is some extremely fine acting from all four of the principle characters.

The protective relationship between Dorian and his brother, Nicky, is so softly portrayed by Michael McMillian and Lea Coco. These two actors have a great future ahead of them. The father's coldness stings without being over the top, again because of Steven Charles Fletcher's performance. And Mo Quigley presents Dorian's mom as a weak individual without making her an unsympathetic character.

Although the film's theme seems to be Dorian's acceptance of his sexual orientation, in a broader context this movie is about family dynamics and how we need each other's strength in order to survive as an organic unit capable of growth. This is where Dorian Blues transcends the genre to which it has been consigned.

Dorian and his family are people I enjoyed knowing. I envied his relationship with his brother. I'll revisit this movie often just to say ""hi"" to people I don't mind thinking of as friends. This movie can open a lot of hearts if we see it as an imperfect family trying to make its way in an imperfect world. I cannot judge the weak links. I can only offer my support for all of us that deal with imperfect humanity in our lives.",1141171200,2,1804,4.772435897435898
2470546,2,B000CR7R7K,"Based on some of the online reviews I had read of Dorian Blues, we were really looking forward to seeing it. It had played last year at a number of gay and lesbian film festivals, and people who had seen it there had written some enthusiastic reviews. Written and directed by Tennyson Bardwell (his first outing, pardon the pun), this is a coming-out story, and the reviews promised that it was very fresh (even though the genre is, shall we say, already well trod). Well, now that we've seen the film ourselves, I have to wonder if those people who posted the great reviews were all just friends of the debutant director. Not that the movie was bad. It was okay. We were mildly amused and entertained, if not deeply moved or laughing volubly. It certainly had some good parts. Michael MacMillian, who plays the lead, is certainly a talented comic actor. (The physical comedy of Dorian at his therapist's office practicing coming out to his father using a mannequin was quite amusing.) And there was some potential in the material for some real exploration of family relationships, especially the unwitting influence of fathers and brothers. But we really only saw that in the last two minutes, which were very good, and maybe one or two other scattered glimpses. (Those last two minutes were bittersweet, in that they underscored what the film could have been, but wasn't.)

The film was just very uneven, and I think the fundamental problem is that the director couldn't make up his mind what sort of film he wanted to make. Sometimes it was a misty sepia-toned semi-nostalgic attitude (think The Wonder Years), while other times it was sardonic and not taking itself seriously (think That 70's Show). There were moments of real emotion, but just when the audience might get engaged with the characters, the film careens to a detached comic tone that pushes us away emotionally. In much of the story, the characters are just cartoons walking from one clich into another. There is a funny (and well-executed) scene when Dorian tries to talk to his mother, who is practically oblivious to him while claiming to listen. With a more skillful director, this could have fit well as an exaggerated subjective impression, being both funny and poignant at the same time, but Bardwell doesn't pull it off. (It's a difficult balance, but it can certainly be done well. I think of Jeffrey as an example that was laugh-out loud funny, mostly sardonic and detached, charicaturish, and yet at times quite emotional and ultimately engaging.) There's some good raw material, but an inconsistent vision and attitude make the movie fall short of what it could have been.",1141171200,16,2653,4.856512141280353
