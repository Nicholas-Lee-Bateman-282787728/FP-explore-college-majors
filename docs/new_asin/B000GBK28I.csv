8130497,5,B000GBK28I,"Excellant series with few of the shortcut other shows make when doing something on the history of space travel. Good solid writing and acting. The actor who play's Korolev is superb, as is the way technical issues are covered without talking down the audience. Plus it was nice to see good CG of the N1 under construction and launch. Pity the DVDs are Europe only.",1409961600,,364,4.615384615384615
8130498,5,B000GBK28I,"I saw this BBC series on PBS a few years ago and decided then, that I would love to own a copy of it for my personal library.  It was then I found out that the format was not suited to play on our American DVD player.  This was very disappointing, and I do not understand.  Why?  The whole story had to do with American effort, work and ingenuity, from Managers, Engineers, to the workers on the factory floor. Why is BBC, not releasing the DVD in the format,so American's can play them?  They did a excellent job in producing the program, but besides that, they had nothing to do with the tremendous work since 1957-1969 and beyond, with the arrival of the Shuttle. If I have to fly to England to purchase a DVD that will play their disc format, I will!",1362873600,,754,4.244755244755245
8130499,2,B000GBK28I,"This BBC produced docudrama displays its roots - the British apparently cannot get beyond the fact that Wernher von Braun was the mastermind behind the V2 program. I can't say I blame them, that's human nature, but it must be factored in by viewers who are not fully aware of the facts. After watching this program, an uninformed viewer would be left with the impression that virtually everyone working on the American program was morally, intellectually and patriotically inferior to their Russian counterparts.

Viewers will probably enjoy the drama but should take it cum grano salis.",1316131200,2,587,5.114583333333333
8130500,5,B000GBK28I,"This is a well done documentary about the race into space between the soviets and the United States.  And since it is a British project, there is not the normal bias one might see.  What is most interesting is the depth explored about the development and failures of the Russian technology.  It is in PAL format and so to watch it here in America, you will need access to a standards converter.",1284076800,,394,4.444444444444445
8130501,5,B000GBK28I,"This is an amazing walk-through of the history of rocketry. I enjoyed this so much that I keep watching it over and over again. For those who expect real footage, note that maybe only 10% of the whole movie is real footage and the rest is actors playing the events of the period. For North American buyers, be careful since the DVD is European region and your DVD player might not be able to play it. Overall, accurately made and the narration is also very good.",1268784000,3,462,4.383720930232558
8130502,5,B000GBK28I,"The Space Race wasn't quite as one sided as one might believe.  This series outlines the benefits of Capitalism over Communism but also shows serious flaws in NASA work to ""get man to the moon before this decade is out"".",1263254400,,220,4.5
8130503,5,B000GBK28I,"This BBC program was broadcast in the USA by National Geographic. The four hour program, based on Deborah Cadbury's well researched ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Space-Race-The-Epic-Battle-Between-America-and-the-Soviet-Union-for-Dominion-of-Space/dp/0061176281/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Space Race: The Epic Battle Between America and the Soviet Union for Dominion of Space</a>"", is very well done. It depicts the simultaneous efforts of the Russian/USSR Chief Designer, Sergei Pavlovich Korolev and the German/USA Rocket Scientist, Werner Von Braun, to send a man to the moon and bring him back safely.

Information about Korolev is so hard to find in the USA that I'd think this video would be welcomed here and readily available. Not so.
That being said, I most highly recommend James Harford's thoroughly researched ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Korolev-How-One-Man-Masterminded-the-Soviet-Drive-to-Beat-America-to-the-Moon/dp/0471148539/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Korolev: How One Man Masterminded the Soviet Drive to Beat America to the Moon</a>"".

This DVD has been available since 2006 in the UK/PAL -- heck, all over Europe and Australia and China -- but not in the US/NTSC. Why is that? Do we need to depend on YouTube for everything? From what I've seen of it there, this is a top notch production.

National Geographic first aired this program in the US. At one time the National Geographic website posted more information about the program but that's long gone now. I emailed National Geographic as to product availability. They say it's not available.",1236211200,9,1659,6.531818181818182
