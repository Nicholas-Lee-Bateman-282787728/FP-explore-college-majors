4118568,1,B003FSTN84,"I never thought I would enjoy a show called ""NUMB3RS"", but I watched and got hooked at least for seasons one through four.  And then for whatever reason, known only to the ""TV gods"" they (the writers) started pulling the plug.  A great ensamble cast - a brilliant concept - all got flushed down the googela - Kevorkian would be proud.  CBS are you aiming to go the way of NBC?",1272585600,17,376,4.267605633802817
4118569,5,B003FSTN84,"This show should be on the student resource list for math classes beginning in 5th grade. The writers demonstrated amazing foresight in covering subjects in 2005-2010 such as AI and IoT that are still evolving, but are now guaranteed platforms. I love the analogies used to simplify complex mathematical concepts and otherwise esoteric topics in astronomy and physics. The addition of psychic- and numerology-based premises mirrored points of debate between science and traditionally fringe disciplines. Debunking magic and the extraterrestrial was neatly juxtaposed with religion and the arms race. The fact that family dynamics, social welfare, gender equality, morality, and cultural differences consistently ran as underpinning themes through all seasons made the series strong in all aspects.  Watching the series for the first time in 2017, I can testify that the relevance is lasting. The actors were perfect for the characters. Real, quirky, people who live next door. Action, suspense, romance, comedy, science fiction all top off a FIVE-STAR production! Fantastic job!",1492473600,7,1078,5.654320987654321

4118576,4,B003FSTN84,"Hated to see the series end, but it went out with class. This is probably the most fun to watch, cerebral show, that I have ever seen. It was not only entertaining to watch, but was also informative. The characters were always engaging, and made the viewer feel like a part of the cast. This show will definitely be on my list to re-watch, whether in syndication or through other media. Thank you for the memories.",1486252800,,414,4.4605263157894735

4118581,5,B003FSTN84,"My husband and I absolutely loved this series. We were looking for a series to binge watch on weekends, and this fit the bill! Rob Morrow, David Krumholtz, and Judd Hirsch are perfectly cast. But the surprise favorite for me was Peter MacNicol as the lovable and philosophical mentor of Krumholtz's character. The series finale was highly satisfactory although sad because we knew there wouldn't be any more episodes.

We were often amazed at how the writers were able to take the subject of a math genius helping with FBI cases be new and interesting with each episode. We never felt as though they had fallen into a routine or rehashed old ideas. Each episode was unique.",1485734400,,673,4.752136752136752

4118596,5,B003FSTN84,We have really enjoyed this series. Each season has been great and we'll miss not having it continue. My only complaint is that I felt it tied everything up too abruptly just to be done on the last episode.,1481932800,,206,4.3076923076923075
4118597,3,B003FSTN84,Stuck with this series because I'm a completest but the final season felt disjointed and hurried compared to earlier episodes. The balance of dark and light hearted humor was missing at the conclusion.,1481846400,,201,5.121212121212121

I know that it resolved many things with the main characters when it ended so it was like it did have an end, but I wish I could have gone on with the people for another 5 or 6 seasons.

I thoroughly enjoyed this show, watched from beginning to end and felt like I really got to know the various characters. But, knowing the last season was in fact, the LAST season, I felt like the ending of the show was handled very well. Everyone ""moved on"" in their lives so it made the parting sort of bittersweet, but it was kind to the very last moment. The characters seemed to really love one another and cared for each other and they got to express their feelings that seemed to reflect how the actors probably felt as well. While I always found the mathematical solutions fascinating, along with the forensics and ""real"" police work the agents undertook, for me the attraction of the show was the interplay of the characters -- brothers, sons, father, co-workers, and so forth.  I never really felt that the show got ""old"", and it easily could have, but it was always something just a bit new in each episode.",1459382400,2,937,4.538461538461538

I enjoyed the character development throughout the series. And especially the lovely relationships between Don and Charlie, and their dad. The ongoing themes of friendship, loyalty, and truth made for a positive viewing experience. Plus the use of math to solve so many life issues was fun to watch.",1441411200,6,444,4.855263157894737

4118819,5,B003FSTN84,"This season concluded my hands down favorite crime show! Numb3rs excellently combined criminal investigation and the bond of family and friendship. Its cases were realistic and exciting leaving you on the edge of your seat, and at the same time did not focus on the crime being committed but how they solved that crime. So many shows place too much emphasis on the crime and the sickness of it and does not focus on how they actually solve the crime leaving you at the end of the show relieved that the criminal was caught but feeling a kind of sick as a result of the in depth of emphasis placed on what, how, and when the crime was committed. Numb3rs, on the other hand, does not zero in as much on the grievance as it does on how the crime was solved and often times ending on a positive note of family, trust, love, or friendship leaving you glad that the perpetrator was apprehended but uplifted by the way each member of the FBI team or Epps family loves and cares for each other.",1441065600,2,986,4.364130434782608

4118863,4,B003FSTN84,"""Numb3rs"" is one of the few TV series that I qualify as very good.  Season 6 was the final season.  In most ways it was also the weakest season.  The ""fun math"" that was a cornerstone of the earlier seasons was almost entirely lost.  Megan (on of their best characters) had already left.

It's still worth the view, though, especially for the fans of the series.  The relationships among the characters are still engaging.  ""Numb3rs"" also brought to a close.  The ""back stories"" arc the season to bring the characters into their post-series lives, set forth in the last episode.  (Enough said.  No spoilers.)

If you're new to ""Numb3rs"", start with Season 1.

If you found Season 5 too slow or lost its way, you may want to skip Season 6.  I think the wind-up was worthwhile, but Season 6 is otherwise not appreciably better than Season 5.

Everyone else, you probably will be happy with Season 6.

4118871,5,B003FSTN84,"For half a decade ""Numb3rs"" followed mathematician Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz) and his FBI agent brother Don (Rob Morrow).  Charlie's phenomenal math insights helped solve more than a hundred crimes over the course of the series, and this DVD set of the sixth and final season contains all 16 of that season's episodes that were originally aired from September 2009 to the series finale in March 2010.

Season Six was relatively short, but there were many strong episodes--the team encountered worlds such as Russian roulette, gambling, cloning, and the paranormal, and used Charlie's tips in the mathematical concepts of game theory, ultimatum game, and risk analysis among others to solve crimes involving a sniper, robbery, kidnapping, computer hacking, identity theft, a hostage situation, and more.

Henry Winkler guest starred in an episode this season, and this set includes special features discussing the filming of the show.  ""Numb3rs"" had great chemistry among the lead characters and superb writing, and the final episodes tied up the storylines for the main characters and showed the direction they planned on taking in the future.

While fans of the series were disappointed when ""Numb3rs"" ended, the show's run of 118 episodes was creditable for a show of its type and provided much enjoyment with its unique mathematical spin on police drama.",1431129600,4,1362,5.287037037037037

4118989,4,B003FSTN84,"I enjoyed all of the shows, however by the Season 6 it was obvious that Numb3rs should come to an end.  There was entirely too much of the episodes centered around Charlie, Amita and Larry rather than the actual story itself.  I will still give it 4 stars but really would not care for any more of Numb3rs.",1411257600,,306,4.258620689655173

4118995,5,B003FSTN84,"Loved this show while it was running on TV, and watching again was really good. I feel it was the right move to discontinue it after the 6th season, because, it would have begun to run into another soap opera, like so many other programs did.",1409270400,,242,4.282608695652174

4119006,3,B003FSTN84,"They really could have tied it up better. Like the show and the character and the math surprisingly. It helps me understand math much better than I did but Im pretty sure the FBI, CIA, NSA and other agencies would be doing a lot more if it really worked.

4119011,5,B003FSTN84,"It all ended way too soon!  It's probably the last of the truly wholesome, family shows...and the math/physics of it all...  I've always thought of myself as an ""undercover"" geek (computer science undergraduate major), and this show truly brought out all of my geekiness!  But the funny thing is, I understood much more now that I've embraced my creative side (fine art graduate degree)!  Honestly, I had never heard of Fibronacci or the Golden Ratio until I became an art student!  It tickled me PINK to hear them talk about these concepts AND apply them!!  Loved the entire series.  When I finished watching it, I had Numb3rs withdrawals!  I didn't watch the series when it ran because I promised I wouldn't get caught up in any more television shows that pushed the envelop.  But this one is truly a wholesome show.  I really wish it had not ended.",1404777600,,851,4.6891891891891895

4119015,5,B003FSTN84,"I give a thumbs up () to season 6! I really enjoyed all of them. In 6 however; I kinda became emotional when I realized the series might be ending when everyone was Quiting their jobs, selling property and moving away. I was recovering from surgery (couldn't do much) and this series made it much easier as I was recovering! It is a series that would be appropriate for most audiences. No foul or filthy language (which I appreciated very much) in the entire series. Love it!!!",1404259200,,477,4.494252873563219

4119017,5,B003FSTN84,"The final season, even though short, gave the series a fond farewell. It was nice to have noone died and to have Don and Charlie their happy ending.",1403913600,,148,4.321428571428571
4119018,5,B003FSTN84,"The actors/""actresses"", writers, producers, and cameramen, etc. have again put together a totally engrossing series of episodes that more than less did not fail to keep me ""glued to my seat"". As always, thumbs up!",1403568000,,213,5.114285714285714
4119019,5,B003FSTN84,"Although I was certain at times this series was over long before it truly was, the sixth season was a bittersweet ending. It actually was better in the last season than in seasons four and five.  The last episode, while not making me cry -- there was too much joy and hope for that -- I did find myself swallowing hard at times.

This casting was truly inspiring.  I loved the three major characters -- and in one episode, when Don says he's never been to Fairbanks, Alaska, I truly laughed out loud (as he was in Northern Exposure, one of the best shows of all time!).  To me, the deep sigh of completion of a wonderful series at the end of the last episode me me heartily glad I watched it.  The entire thing, I mean.  I watched all six seasons in about three weeks (real life getting in the way at times) so I could remember from time to time what had happened previously.

Here's to hoping that something like this comes along again.  It's doubtful with all the ""reality"" stuff we are getting now, but I know that there are cycles in television viewing, and hopefully this reality is about done.  I see more and more good stuff -- but not so good as this show.",1403481600,,1164,4.2785388127853885

4119021,4,B003FSTN84,"I really liked the last season of Numb3rs and was sad to see it end, however I did feel like I agreed with the phrase ""all good things must come to an end."" It was time. While season six isn't my favorite (the whole team, except for Nikki, drastically change how they look),  it did host some of the best episodes.

Season 6 finale is great, really drawing the show to a close. I also REALLY liked the episode Ultimatum (where Colby Granger, my favorite, gets taken hostage! *girl squeal*,) and have watched that many times.

Overall I'd say it's worth renting on Amazon, maybe not worth the buy - up to you. Con Job was excellent, but not my favorite episode.",1402876800,,660,4.39344262295082
4119022,4,B003FSTN84,I enjoyed watching these characters move through their relationships while solving crimes using their brains. Looking for more if this.,1400976000,,135,5.8
4119023,4,B003FSTN84,While it is apparent from at least mid-season that the show seems to be drawing to a close it is still fun. Especially since they bring back some characters from past shows--good and bad. I was happy to see Henry Winkler reprise his role. The show does a good job of tying up most of the characters lives.,1400284800,,305,4.275862068965517
4119024,4,B003FSTN84,Love watching this show. It requires you to think about things that you typically wouldn't. Much better than the fluff shows that are only around to annoy.,1400112000,,155,4.777777777777778
4119025,5,B003FSTN84,My wife loves this series. We have almost finished watching it and my wife is sad because she loves the characters. The math applications to real world problems make it quite interesting.,1399852800,,187,4.875
4119026,5,B003FSTN84,"After watching the six seasons, I'm really said that the program came to a conclusion. One of the best, well thought out, well written and well acted program I've watched in years. It FLOWED....seamlessly from season to season. Will be very hard to top this one!",1399852800,,262,4.717391304347826
4119027,3,B003FSTN84,"It seemed like weak wrap up to the season.  That wasn't a real wedding,  Larry presiding - how convenient.  Amita had no family there which was why they couldn't set a date earlier in the season.  Less math in the episodes and Don didn't participate as much throughout the season.",1399161600,,280,4.54
4119028,5,B003FSTN84,Really liked the show. Loved the dynamic between the brothers and father and appreciated how the characters struggled and grew thru each season.,1399161600,,144,5.304347826086956
4119029,4,B003FSTN84,IT is a good show. It is a little unbelievable with all of the math stuff but still is fun to watch.,1398816000,,100,3.590909090909091
4119030,4,B003FSTN84,"I love watching this show, but have a hard time finding out where I left off on Netflix. I watched it once on amazon, but when I wanted to watch the show, It didn't pop up like on Netflix. So I guess I need to learn how to use amazon.",1398470400,,234,3.7
4119031,5,B003FSTN84,I enjoy the show and the actors and actresses that played in this. Watch every single episode in all 6 seasons,1397433600,,110,4.285714285714286
4119032,4,B003FSTN84,"This was the last season for the show and with that they had a lot of loose ends to tie up. While they did clear up a lot, much of the drama that made it such a nice series took a back seat in the end. If it wasn't the end I might have given it all five stars",1397260800,,259,3.406779661016949

4119037,5,B003FSTN84,Great series with good character development and no graphic violence.  Fun to watch the plots unfold. Shows how critical thinking actually works.,1395014400,,145,5.590909090909091

4119040,5,B003FSTN84,I recently met a young man with a degree in math and physics who had never heard of this show.  I set him right since it's a novel story line with all the ingredients of a good mystery.,1394150400,,185,3.8684210526315788

4119042,5,B003FSTN84,The math used to solve the crimes is interesting.  New ways to measure or find results are interesting to me as the determining results could be applied to many day to day problems.  Not the specific techniques here but the concepts.,1394064000,,233,4.658536585365853
4119043,3,B003FSTN84,"I rather like this show. It is nice to see mathematics represented so well. This rendition of the federal bureau of investigation is action packed, passionate while offering a view of a fed's personal, family and work life.",1393372800,,223,4.894736842105263
4119044,5,B003FSTN84,The stars are amazing in this series.  The show sometimes becomes quite complex due to Charlie's brilliant but complicated mathematical algorithms but all in all this is a good family show.,1393286400,,189,5.096774193548387

4119049,5,B003FSTN84,"Great show. I missed this show when it was on tv and seeing it on Amazon, I think it was one of the great FBI / Police shows of all time. I too feel like another person who mentioned that this show was 'underrated', but you don't get 6 seasons out of a show that's not good. So I say go for it, you'll get hooked.",1390867200,,313,3.757575757575758
4119050,5,B003FSTN84,"Love this show. Has incredible insight into familial relationships, is educational, has romance, some crime but the stress is on the crime solving rather than the crime itself.

4119054,4,B003FSTN84,"The final season of Numb3rs is amazing so far. There are some nice dynamic episodes and some of my favorite characters return, both good and bad. The DVDs themselves are in excellent condition, so far none have glitched. However, when I opened the case for the first time there were random broken plastic pieces that fell out. Luckily, they didn't damage the DVDs and the case firmly closes without these broken parts. Shipping was ok, not too fast but not too slow. Thank you!",1389571200,,477,4.690476190476191

4119064,5,B003FSTN84,Great education about math.  Wish the show had lasted longer.  It's entertaining and if you want to learn more you can!,1381276800,,119,4.619047619047619
4119065,5,B003FSTN84,"Not the typical crime series. This series challenges the mind, has an actual family feel to the main characters, and is not just your typical ""action"" show. LOVE it.",1380931200,,165,4.724137931034483

But, once I watched a full show I changed my mind.  Although some of the math is stretching it and a lot I have never heard of at all, I thought the show was great.  I especially liked the ensemble - the interactions of the father and his two very different sons.",1376697600,,410,4.217948717948718
4119073,5,B003FSTN84,"I liked this show a lot and enjoyed watching all six seasons from start to finish. I found it challenging intellectually, sometimes looking up the definitions of words used in the dialogue.

I thought the last episode ended everything too suddenly, like everyone graduated from college, with very little progression leading up to an end.

4119145,4,B003FSTN84,"I haven't kept a close eye on ""Numb3rs"" thanks to its dead end 10 pm Friday night airing, but when I had tuned in (primarily via On Demand), I rarely was ever disappointed. I will submit that the mathematics used in this sixth season wasn't the greatest and in fact during one episode, 'And the Winner Is', didn't make a whole lot of sense in that the theory was sound but how they came about it and in turn found the culprits was on the iffy side. But, I've always felt that while indeed the show's gimmick was using mathematics to solve crimes it is the characters and their arcs that make it worthwhile viewing. In the sixth season I could immediately tell that even the writers had an inkling this would be the final season as they began tying up the characters' stories and by the series finale, as a casual fan, I was mostly satisfied. Yes, it is a very low key ending to the show as even the plot was in line with most of the stories that have come before but I wouldn't want it any other way. They could have had some big shootout or major explosion that would've altered or even killed a main character but far too many shows (see: ""CSI: Miami"") do that and it just comes off as melodramatic and rarely works. Plus, with only a few exceptions, isn't really ""Numb3rs"" style.

As for this DVD, I can see how the features have devolved from the first couple of seasons (5-6 episode commentaries, a few featurettes) to the latter releases where, in the case of The Fifth Season, having only a featurette and no commentaries at all. In this one, we do get commentaries on 3 episodes ('Con Job' - actor Rob Morrow, director Ralph Hemecker and executive Don McGill; `Old Soldiers' with director Ken Sanzel, actor Alimi Ballard and guest star Henry Winkler; and `Cause and Effect' with creators/writers Cheryl Heuton, Nicolas Falacci (who also directed) and actor David Krumholtz) but unfortunately they couldn't get the entire cast together for the finale, though I am glad it did get one (unlike ""Scrubs"").

The set also has a decent featurette entitled ""Coming Full Circle: Numb3rs The Final Season"" (25:42) in which the first half chronicles Falacci's directorial debut on the series finale before going into the cast and crew talking about this being the end of the road (it also includes emotional on-set final statements by the cast). There are also two more featurettes (""The Women of Numb3rs"" (11:04) and Pixel Perfect: The Digital Cinematography of Numb3rs (15:10)) and each are pretty good, though ""Coming Full Circle"" is the one to see. There is also a photo gallery with pics taken of the cast and crew taken over the years.

The video and audio quality are both on par with previous seasons including a bombastic audio during the opening and transition scenes.

Anyway, fans of the show should of course pick this up and I think for casual fans like myself, it's still worth it as I feel this is one of the better shows that was on TV and it's nice to have it sitting on your shelf, plus it helps the show has plenty of repeat value.",1281139200,83,3048,4.556569343065694

CBS has been the only network left of the original ""Big 3"" that has had anything worth watching the past several years. But they too are really screwing up! First it was the cancellation of Moonlight starring Alex O'Laughlin. I honestly believe they cancelled that as payback for the writers strike! Why else would they cancel a hugely popular new show like that; nothing but clear cut vindictiveness on the part of CBS management, acting like spoiled little brats! Then Criminal Minds replaced Mandy Patinkin who is a very talented actor! But at least they replaced him with Joe Mantegna, another excellent actor! Now I find out that Ghost Whisperer and Numb3rs may also be done? Why doesn't cbs pull their heads out of their butts and pay attention to what the people like! Yet they leave shows like CSI on the air even though William Petersen has left and he WAS CSI:Crime Scene Investigation! The only good shows left will be CSI: Miami, NCIS & Criminal Minds! All the excellent shows are now showing up on cable stations, (or in my case satellite stations); shows like Burn Notice, In Plain Sight, Royal Pains, The Closer, Leverage, How The Earth Was Made, MythBusters, The Universe, MonsterQuest & UFO Hunters, although I think UFO Hunters was just cancelled too, IDIOTS! I think in another 10-20 years NBC, CBS and ABC won't even exist! They don't know a good thing when they see it anymore!
I do hope that NUMB3ERS has not been cancelled and that they leave it on the air for a while longer! Judd Hirsch is GREAT in this show!

4119149,1,B003FSTN84,"I knew this show was doomed when they started overemphasizing the laughable physics character.  I'm told that this show was inspired by Nobel laureate Richard Feynman and if so, he would be rolling over in his grave at the New Age sideline that's spewed by ""Larry"".  Also, it seems like the math aspect of the show has been watered down to glitzy little graphics with little or no substance nor explanation.
The original characters from Season One were much, much better and I wish the show could be resurrected in some form with a real physicist character who would do Feynman justice (I know they switched the main character to math vs physics but again, Feynman was direct and a real physicist).  Why not bring back the mechanical engineer from a few shows past?  That was a character that could have had broad appeal.
Also, on the DVD's, why not include in the special features some in depth discussions of the math?  The folks who aren't interested could just avoid this but in all the DVD's, and I do have them all, there's very little decent extras.  Keith Devlin could easily add a bit from his great book on Numb3rs, available at Amazon--plug intended, and go into even more detail.
It just seems that everything must be dumbed down while a good portion of the public would love to be treated as adults and would appreciate a bit of content with their entertainment.  Maybe it's possible for fans to pull a ""Star Trek"" campaign--IF the producers will listen a little more to Devlin and a lot less to the entertainment/TV folks.",1273708800,41,1536,4.645756457564576

8396095,5,B003FSTN84,"We loved this show from beginning to end. One of those rare shows that make you feel good after each episode. The characters became our family in a sense and we were happy for them when they were happy, sad for them when they were sad. The only downside to this show was that it ended after only 6 seasons. However, it could have gone for 12 seasons and the end would have been too soon. Finally, it felt so good to have a beloved series ended in such a positive, upbeat finale. It made the loss a bitter-sweet one and also made it a bit easier to say goodbye.",1503532800,,560,4.1
