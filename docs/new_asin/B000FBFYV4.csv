8120382,3,B000FBFYV4,"This is just OK. I'm a huge pirate fan and was looking forward to a documentary on the actual ships used by pirates. Instead, there is a brief mention of a couple of different types of ships and the rest is just a brief, popular history of pirates-but no fine detail about the actual vessels used. If you are new to pirates it is interesting and is worth watching but be warned: the title is a bit misleading. Also, this disc does not have a 'pause' feature. I was hoping for more but this just wasn't that program.",1500163200,,515,4.26530612244898
8120383,5,B000FBFYV4,wish history channel would do more shows like this instead of those stupid reality shows,1434672000,,88,4.933333333333334
8120384,4,B000FBFYV4,"Sailing ships credited with being filmed for this show are Bounty, Lady Washington, Mary Day and Western Union.  There is also a Golden Hind replica and Columbus's three ship flotilla.  Although mention is made of ancient Greece, most of this program involves European pirates and privateers from the sailing era.",1423180800,,313,5.24

8120386,5,B000FBFYV4,"Awesome History Channel DVD, very interesting and quite factual, as normal for The History Channel!  A must see for pirate buffs like myself!",1216339200,,141,5.130434782608695
8120387,2,B000FBFYV4,"I feel mislead, from the title I was thinking that this was going to be a ""Modern Marvels""-style program about pirate ships. Instead there's maybe 15 minutes about pirate ships, pirate life and how they modified merchant ships into armed vessels.  The rest of the 47 minute running time is dedicated to mini-histories of Sir Francis Drake, William ""Captain"" Kidd, Bartholomew Roberts (Black Bart) and Edward Teach (Blackbeard) all told with weak reenactments of ""pirates"" snarling and pulling ropes.

Couldn't they have at least found a guy with a real beard to play Blackbeard?!  LOL.",1205712000,6,585,5.136842105263158
8120388,2,B000FBFYV4,"I was a bit let down after seeing this video. The description is NOT accurate. Henry Morgan is not once even mentioned in the video, and there is no footage of sunken ships at all! Interviewed historians do give some interesting insights, but the reenactments are rather pitiful. Blackbeard looks as though he bought his beard from the cheapest costume shop available. If he looked like that in real life, I doubt anyone would have taken him seriously!",1160092800,14,452,4.8076923076923075
