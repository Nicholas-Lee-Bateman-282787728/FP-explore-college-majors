These videos are a very nice introduction to a new topic of study in our home school history lessons. We are roughly following The Story of the World curriculum, and moving chronologically through history, though we are going to go through ancient Rome in the ""cradle of civilization"" area around the Mediterranean region before moving over to study ancient China and India. That means we've watched&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ancient-Civilizations-for-Children-Ancient-Mesopotamia-With-Teacher-s-Guide-VHS/dp/1572251425/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ancient Civilizations for Children: Ancient Mesopotamia (With Teacher's Guide) [VHS</a>],&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ancient-Civilizations-for-Children-Ancient-Egypt/dp/1572251387/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ancient Civilizations for Children: Ancient Egypt</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ancient-Aegean-Schlessinger-Ancient-Civilizations-for-Children-VHS/dp/1572251352/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ancient Aegean (Schlessinger Ancient Civilizations for Children) [VHS</a>] before this one. (We couldn't get Ancient Africa from our library, and we were well past that part of our studies by the time we became aware of it.)

I like these as an overview of what we're about to study. We watched the Mesopotamia and Egypt videos AFTER doing those units, and my son spent a lot of time saying, ""I already knew that!"" He was still very happy to enjoy screen time instead of reading another book, and he also found fewer errors in these videos than he has in some others. (He is the kind of kid who loves to ""catch"" the experts making mistakes, though sometimes the ""mistakes"" he finds strike me as intentional generalizations to keep things short and simple for a lay audience...)

In spite of the slightly dated production values, the content on these has been very accurate, and the level of information is great for kids, but not so dumbed down as to be a waste of our time.

If I were a teacher doing Ancient History every year, I would find it worthwhile to purchase these videos. As a homeschooling mom with just two kids, I think borrowing these is a better idea.

The Ancient Greece video covers the basic geography of the region, the fact that Greece was united by a culture, not common leaders, and really stresses the governmental form of democracy as its greatest innovation. Lots of attention is paid to athletics and the different roles boys and girls had in two areas of Greece, Athens and Sparta.",1382918400,,2746,6.253968253968254
