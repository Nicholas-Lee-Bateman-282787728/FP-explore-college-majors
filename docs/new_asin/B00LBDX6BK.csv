The back of my neck was getting goose-pimples and then I suddenly got knock-knees and went pigeon-toed, too! I called my doctor only to find out he was home sick, so out of desperation, I rang up my old buddy Barnacle Barnabas who was still mad at me for forgetting to remind him to forget about the way he didn't like to be forgotten.

""Hey Barn, I got it bad, what has come over me?"", I asked him.

""When's the last time you watched a Sasquatch movie?"" he wisely questioned my original question.

Hokey Smokes! He was correct. It had been at least a month; I was going through withdrawals! If there's one thing I've absorbed in my many years of wandering, it wasn't this, but it was time to adapt Barnabas' knowledge deep into my own brain. Without any ado, I got online, secured the Amazon search function, and typed in one word. One important word, a word that does live in infamy, a sacred word, a serious word, a word that needs no introduction. Bigfoot.

The rest was/is a blur, but the end result was a cure. If you are ailing in a similar way with peculiar symptoms, maybe you need this 2-movies-on-1-handy-DVD-set, too. The films are incredible, much like our hairy friends, the Sasquatch, and if you ever believed in them but sometimes faltered in that belief (go easy on yourself you are only human), then these fantastic films will grease your confidence wheels anew.",1508976000,,1554,4.480565371024735
