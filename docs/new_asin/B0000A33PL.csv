7995869,5,B0000A33PL,"Fantastic video, i love the little girl, and very very funny",1432425600,,60,4.545454545454546
7995870,2,B0000A33PL,"I purchased this film because it was written by Peter Flannery.  Sadly, it's a dud.  Beyond the fine acting, the movie is unfunny, lewd, and stupid.  If you think watching a young woman sitting on a toilet testing herself for pregnancy is amusing, you may disagree, of course.  Mercifully, this film is available only on Region 2.",1411862400,,330,4.7368421052631575
7995871,1,B0000A33PL,"This movie is listed among the selections from Suzanne Bier. It is not by her. However, she did make a well received movie by the same name (when translated) in 1999. Any ideas where to find it with English subtitles? Thanks",1327536000,,224,4.487804878048781
7995872,4,B0000A33PL,"My husband is a Geordie and we have done Newcastle Upon Tyne together, so when I heard about this film, I had to get it.  There are tons of great views of Newcastle city, the famous bridges, Tynemouth, St. James Park (home of NUFC Toon Army Magpies Newcastle United Football Club Soccer), South Shields, and the Angel of the North.  I think Gateshead appears, too.  The acting is great.  Very cute and funny.  Justine Waddell is the star and though she's not famous in America, surprisingly we have 3 of her films on DVD (The One and Only, The Fall, and Dracula 2000).  This is her best of the films, in my opinion, because she really gets to act.  And she's funny, too.  The film has unexpected events, so I won't spoil them for you, but it's very funny.  Patsy Kensit was really funny in this, with her sideline story.  Finally, I'm now a big fan of Richard Roxburgh (who is Australian).  He's becoming famous in many things now, but in The One and Only he's just a regular guy - not an up and coming movie star.  The film is from 2001 or 2002, so it's slightly dated as you can see by the Art Museum, NUFC shirts, & more.  But it is one that we will watch again and again.  Oh, and as for the Geordie accents?  Awful.  But they are still better portrayors of the wonderful people of the Tyne River than the trainwreck that is called ""Geordie Shore"".  Give this a try, I promise you will really enjoy it.  And, yes, my macho husband from North Shields LOVED the film, too.  Men will enjoy this as much as women.",1327536000,,1513,4.282685512367491
7995873,3,B0000A33PL,"My wife wanted this movie and we found it.  It was not cheap at $49 but she really wanted it.  Here in California the DVD region is 1 not 2.  So until we purchase a DVD player that will play all regions we watched the movie on the computer.
I was not happy that a region 2 DVD arrived.  The sender should have known better.",1252886400,,323,3.923076923076923
7995874,5,B0000A33PL,"Really enjoyable feelgood romantic comedy.  It is in the same league as ""Brassed Off""

Hollywood would never produce great films like these two.",1134777600,2,144,5.217391304347826
