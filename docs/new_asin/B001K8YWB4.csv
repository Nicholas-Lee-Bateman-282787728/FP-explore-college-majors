But this Mahoney Brothers band takes the art of mimicry to a new level.  They play every Beatles song you can imagine note for note. And that includes the singing. The way you heard the record play on your record player is the way you hear them do the song!  Plus they do the Beatles from several different eras - early, middle and late - in full costumes.

All of the music is played live by the Brothers - no tapes or background music added.  The bass player says he even learned to play left handed so as to better impersonate Paul McCartney.  Now that's attention to detail taken to a new level.

Enjoy the Mahoney Brothers.  I discovered them recently one Summer playing live at Knoebels Grove Amusement Resort in central Pennsylvania, thinking that they'd be just another so-so Beatles act.  They floored me with their professionalism.  And I'm not the biggest Beatles fan in the world either.  See them live if you can.  Meanwhile see this video.",1248825600,3,1230,4.58256880733945
