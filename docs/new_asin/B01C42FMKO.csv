7671756,5,B01C42FMKO,"I, for one, am grateful Universal is *finally* re-releasing S6 of Xena.  I never got to this one when it was still in print from ADV and am glad as the sets from Universal have SDH subtitles and are in shelf *and* space-friendly packaging!  Considering the S6 ADV sets are now hard to find this is a welcome release as I can finally complete my Xena collection.  There are only 6 seasons of Xena, not 8 as another review indicates.",1456358400,11,431,4.3625
7671757,3,B01C42FMKO,"This is just one more rerelease..

7671771,5,B01C42FMKO,"I bought this as a gift to my daughter.  She and I used to watch the Xena series together when she was younger.  Last year, for her birthday, I bought her the entire series - except for Season 6 because I couldn't find it. I am so glad that the collection is now complete!!!  Xena was a wonderful show that really empowered women!!!  We need more shows like this now - instead of the reality junk that shows women as nothing more than whiny, petty, petulant children that only know how to solve things by fighting.  I miss this show",1482883200,,532,4.28
7671772,5,B01C42FMKO,Boom!!! Xena at her best,1482278400,,24,4.0
7671773,5,B01C42FMKO,"I love this show. It is great to have seasons 4 thru 6 on DVD. I will probably order the first 3 seasons on DVD as well, because  I have them on VHS right now.",1481587200,,159,3.5428571428571427
7671774,4,B01C42FMKO,"First 3 discs were real good then the writers started going on their PC (Politically Correct) binge again where they would have 5-10 minute fights and the worst anyone would suffer was a bloody nose or black eye.  I'm a fan of the earlier seasons obviously where Xena killed her foes instead of just punching them a few times.  Episodes with Area and Aphrodite were Super and I liked the new ones introducing the Norse Gods and Odin.  The final disc in Japan was good but the writers REALLY copped out by having Xena die to try to atone for her past sins!  Did they get new writers or don't the morons pay any attention to their past scripts when Xena says time and time again that you can't like in the past, you have to move on...  It was a cheap ""PC"" way to end the season and the series.
They have rumors of a season 7 but 6 ended in 2001, 15 years ago.  Lucy Lawless must be a grandma by now, could she still do it?  Using another actress would not be the same but I'd probably watch it anyway, just to see if the new Xena went back to the old Kick Ass Xena.",1477699200,,1063,4.081730769230769

7671791,4,B01C42FMKO,The main thing that is bugging me about this release is that it does not have a good main menu. The main menu has only icons and no words for what the symbols mean. Some are obvious while others are confusing. No main menu music either. Good price for what you get though. The main menu is a bit cheap.,1466899200,3,302,4.05
7671792,3,B01C42FMKO,Ok. The DVD plays well and the quality is good.  Only a couple of the episodes are up to prior year's level.,1466812800,,108,3.909090909090909
7671793,5,B01C42FMKO,"It played well, picture wasn't updated or anything, but it also didn't advertise that.

However ... if the review is asking about what I thought of the season ... compared to the other five seasons of Xena, I am a bit disappointed. (Spoiler Alert) There wasn't going on as there could have been with Eve. She wasn't in half the episodes because she was out spreading the message of Eli instead of traveling with Xena and Gabrielle. Maybe it is because the redemption story line has already been a core through out all of the Xena series, but I would have been interested.

A few of the other episodes involving Ares and Aphrodite was very comical, I enjoyed those .. but in this season they started pushing hard about a sexual relationship between the two, whereas in the other seasons it was more 'alluded' to, or hinted at, without being overly in the face. I realize for most people, this may not be an issue, but I grew up idolizing Xena and Gabrielle as strong women who didn't really need a sexual partner to make it through life, they did it on their own two feet. With it so overly in one's face, for me, it cheapened their inner female strength. As though, at the end of the day, if you don't need a man to save you, then it must be another woman. Heaven forbid if a woman wants to just stand for herself.

So the reason for five stars despite my feminist ideals being shattered? The ending to the Xena series was very well done. It seems rushed in some ways, but then are people ever completely satisfied with a series ending? It left a cliff-hanger with Eve, Gabrielle, and Ares. I hear there is supposed to be a Xena reboot, but to me, they sealed it so sure Xena can't come back, that it should be a Gabrielle reboot. After all, Gabrielle herself isn't bad at all, the Xena series seems more about Gabrielle's transformation than Xena's.",1465948800,,1850,4.435294117647059
7671794,5,B01C42FMKO,Finally able to complete my Xena collection! I like these new packaging designs better than the older releases. Thanks.,1465948800,,119,5.315789473684211
7671795,3,B01C42FMKO,"This isn't as good as the first 5 seasons. The menus have icons instead of text for things like subtitles and episode selection. The episodes are number instead of saying the episode name. The video quality looks pretty good and it has subtitles. I can't decide if the video looks as good as earlier releases, though. Clearly the person who designed this never saw any of the other releases. I already have the Region 2 DVD's and I only got this to have the matching set.",1465776000,4,471,4.488372093023256
7671796,5,B01C42FMKO,finally I finished colleting all six seasons. 1 of the best shows ever,1465689600,,70,4.461538461538462
7671797,5,B01C42FMKO,As described. Got the cc to work.  Thanks,1465689600,,41,4.125
8752124,3,B01C42FMKO,all the season episodes--not a single stitch of extra's no commentaries behind the scenes and opening menu well the only menu is 4 symbols next lets you select episodes by the picture no titles offered. not even scene selections. the most basic season of a program you can get. you'll have to buy a different set to get any extra's or a menu.....,1527811200,,346,4.507936507936508

8752127,5,B01C42FMKO,I grew up watching Xena so there's nothing not to dislike about it.,1524441600,,67,4.230769230769231
8752128,5,B01C42FMKO,"This was one of the best seasons, with the exception of the last minutes of the final episode when Xena dies. There were some really great Xena/Gabrielle moments in this season. The subtext of their lesbian relationship is right out in the open. ""When Fates Collide"" and ""Return Of The Valkyrie"" show that their love for each other is much deeper than mere friendship. Ares shows up in numerous. episodes, and as always, his character is lots of fun. Especially in ""Old Ares Had A Farm."" This season shows how far Gabrielle has changed over the course of the series. The best example of this is in the excellent ""To Helicon And Back."" My only complaint is the icons used in the menu options. The previous 5 seasons listed the titles. Which was much more user friendly than trying to figure out what episode you want to watch from a picture. However, that is a minor issue that in no way detracts from my enjoyment of this collection.",1517270400,,933,4.559523809523809
