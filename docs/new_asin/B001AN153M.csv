8278091,5,B001AN153M,"this is a good view-*ESPECIALLY* the real footage of a safari park when a man gets out of his car ???? to film lions. as he's filming one a lion jumps on him from behind and we watch him get mauled and torn apart - *as does his family*.

and we see a little monkey try and negotiate the grapple of an anaconda.",1449187200,,310,3.9206349206349205
8278092,3,B001AN153M,"I am old enough to say that I saw this movie when if was shown in theaters. This type of ""documentary"" relies on a careful mix of what might be considered ""gross"" material with more light hearted but highly unusual material. I remember enough of this movie to know that it has been ""cut"" to ribbons and information on the internet confirms that. The video does not survive well and now seems hopelessly outdated.",1404604800,,412,4.581081081081081
8278093,1,B001AN153M,"This is a 1975 Mondo film originally titled ""Zumbalah"". It is done documentary style showing us animals killing animals and man killing animals almost as a forerunner to the ""Faces of Death"" series. It also attempts to be anthropological by showing us naked hippies littering the beaches of Cape Cod in order to save the environment.

While some of the scenes are staged, there are some interesting scenes, people humping the ground for example, that I had not known or imagined. The film had a lot of nudity, mostly male and the narration was extremely boring.",1390521600,,561,4.84375
8278094,2,B001AN153M,"SAVAGE MAN, SAVAGE BEAST is yet another mondo / death-porn film from the 70s. Once again, animals are killed in various ways in various parts of the world. A monkey is crushed by a python. Aborigines hunt kangaroos and bats w/ spears and boomarangs. Natives kill water buffalo and elephants. A British fox hunt is shown. Animals of all kinds are slaughtered by land, sea, and air. Tribal rituals such as earth impregnation and cannibalism are also examined. Personally, I'll never understand the fascination these films hold for a certain audience. While interesting, it is obvious that exploitation is the primary reason these films were made. The idea of passing such movies off as ""documentaries"" or ""educational films"" is laughable. These were just an excuse to show bloody deaths punctuated by nudity in a time eons before the internet was even a dream. The naked hippies are a hoot, w/ their free-loving animal husbandry and drug-addled protest. Unless watching these fuzzy folk using the restroom outdoors, or breastfeeding lambs is of interest, you might want to move on. Then again, if you enjoy shock-films from yesteryear, then this is a prime example thereof... P.S.- As an added bonus, watch for the human execution near the end! It's either totally fake, or blessedly edited! What a wonderful world...",1386028800,,1315,5.064516129032258
8278095,2,B001AN153M,"I actually saw film at my local cinema way back in the late 60s..on general release.....I was 17 and it had an X rating(adults only)..remember it being upsetting and vicious.
Ive been looking for it since then (curious only)and only just found it here........wont bother to see it again in these unshockable days...........would link as similar and shockable as the BBC documentary ""The War Game"" ...out on release about the same time...",1337731200,,437,5.083333333333333
