8486140,4,B005TFY1TC,I finally managed to see the movie for free from another website! The movie is good. I didn't like the ending though. But don't get mislead and buy this movie from Amazon.

8486144,4,B005TFY1TC,"It has a rather good storyline, acting is great, and shots are good. Though without giving out spoilers I'm not happy about the ending but still worth watching.",1378944000,,160,4.75
8486145,5,B005TFY1TC,"This is a great Hindi film with constant action and romance. The story line keeps you engaged from start to finish and revolves around a team of drug agents who are leading a war against gangs and sophisticated drug dealers in India that bring in drugs from around the world. The story takes off when the brother of a major drug dealer is killed, then the team of agents not only has to protect their families but keep drugs off the streets. A lot of lives are lost in the process but in the end the good guys bring home a win. Well, worth the watch and purchase.",1353196800,,563,4.222222222222222

8486147,5,B005TFY1TC,"The time has come that even Bollywood invites good action choreographers into the action movies, and you can see it here. Solid story, surprisigly - for a Bolly - few dancing scenes, but well included into the story, great characters - good and bad. John Abraham has charm enough to pull his brooding hero through the whole movie, Genelia D'Souza is lovely, newcomer Vidyut Jamwal properly menacing. With some of the newest movies like Force and Urumi and Magadheera and a lot of others Bollywood starts to steal wind from Hollywood action scene sails.",1336780800,,552,4.882978723404255
8486148,2,B005TFY1TC,"There is a method to all stories, even to the ones which are supposed to be unpredicatable. ""Force"" is an action drama whose two main ingredients are speed and ""masala"". In movies where the protagonists are GOOD cops, the percept is that the Good shall prevail and the bad shall be vanquished. Good can prevail only when the innocent are protected. And this is where the fault lies with the script of this movie. In his eagerness to portray the bad-guy as sadistically brutal the writer went off the percept, wherein lies the undoing of this movie. The bad guy manages to kill everyone who is dear to the good guy, which in other words means that the Good looses to the bad. John Abraham looks ill at ease throughout the movie. The underwear-two-sizes-too-small syndrome. He is a poor actor and should not be burdened with the tag of ""solo-hero"". The villain, Vidyut Jamwal has the same expression throughout and does not look menacing or evil nor does he have the screen presence or the personality to look convincing as a man who can rub the entire Mumbai police department the wrong way. Munish Behl is the only actor in the movie who looks and acts the part given to him. Quite a waste-of-time movie.",1329436800,,1204,4.604651162790698
