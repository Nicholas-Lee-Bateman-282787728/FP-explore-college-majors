225654,4,6300213501,"""The Search for Spock"", while not up to the par of the previous Trek movie, is nonetheless one of the better films in the entire series, despite the fact that the title character barely appears. Making up for his  absence, though, is the return of his father, Sarek, as well as the  heart-tugging ending on the planet Vulcan. Slightly marring the film are  Christopher Lloyd as the Klingon captain (just can't picture Reverend Jim  as a Klingon!) and a different actress playing Saavik instead of Kirstie  Alley (from Trek II), who was born for the role. However, these are minor  detractions. Seeing the destruction of the beloved Enterprise, being  watched by the planetside crew, is worth the price admission (or rental  fee), alone!",922492800,,736,4.926829268292683
225655,2,6300213501,"The first 45 minutes of this film are outstanding.  The fact that consequences from actions of a previous movie are seen is an unheralded breakthrough in moviemaking.  The pain and guilt that Kirk feels is  appropriate.  The best part of the film is when the crew steals the  Enterprise.  Frankly, you could make an entire movie out of just such a  topic.  James Horner's music (he also did Star Trek II) to this entire  sequence of events is outstanding and it really generates a lot of  excitement and tension as the crew desparately try and get the ship out of  space dock.  Once in space, though, the film starts to meander downwards.  The depiction of the Klingons doesn't invite too much fear out of you and  the dumb looking Klingon muppet-dog-pet, which elicits more chuckles than  ominousness, does not help matters at all.  The whole segment of the film  surrounding the Genesis planet isn't executed very well and the planetary  special effects are not very good, as the whole look and feel only confirms  that everything is taking place on a sound stage.  Indeed, except for  exterior shots of ships and associated explosions in space (including the  well-executed Enterprise desctruction sequence), the effects for the film  leave much to be desired (just look at the on-board computer screens for  the Excelsior.  Ugh, those graphics look like they came from an Atari 2600  game system).  The Vulcan mythos is executed much better in Star Trek IV,  with this film only giving you a few interesting insights.  The film could  have been a lot better, but it's still watchable, almost exclusively for  the first half, though, with things coming apart in the second half of the  film.",915148800,5,1694,4.8350877192982455

I enjoyed this one the most, but it is more of a ""chick flick"" than the others. You do have to suspend your disbelief because of the plot, but the essence of the movie is very touching.

I enjoyed Christopher Lloyd as the Klingon commander, a bit over the top, but he had some great lines in the movie.  Although TWOK had less budget for special effects, from this movie until TNG:First Contact, one can see the 'cheapness' of Paramount in tightening up the budget on special effects.  They really took a hit on ST:V, but that is a whole other issue.  Overall, it's fun to actually see everyone out of uniform, there are a lot of poignant moments and I always enjoy re-watching it.",1477526400,2,663,4.446280991735537

Andrews Blu-ray Review: The Third Sci-Fi franchise feature film STAR TREK III: THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK [1984] is on another mission for the intergalactic pioneers of the Starship USS Enterprise and sees them all unite as one to free the trapped soul of their fallen comrade Spock [Leonard Nimoy]. On returning to Earth, Admiral James T. Kirk [William Shatner] is mortified to hear that the Starship U.S.S. Enterprise is not available. So Admiral James T. Kirk is determined to find his lost Vulcan friend Spock, Admiral James T. Kirk and his loyal crew have no choice but to steal their beloved ship and bring him home. Having less time in front of the cameras than usual, Leonard Nimoy makes the most of his opportunity to direct this film.

Directly after the demise of Spock at the hands of the Klingon, Khan, the crew of the Starship U.S.S. Enterprise return to Earth only to discover their beloved ship is out of action. As if Admiral James T. Kirk wasn't heartbroken enough at the loss of his friend, not to mention Dr. Bones McCoy's increasing hysteria, Admiral James T. Kirk has to come to terms with the end of an era and that is, until Spock's father turns up and explains the mind of his son, or his Katra, has been transferred into Dr. Bones McCoy's head, and the only way to solve the situation is to reunite Spock's body with Dr. Bones McCoy's mind.

But Admiral James T. Kirk is not the only one with an interest in the planet, scientists Dr. David Marcus [Merritt Butrick] and Lt. Saavik [Robin Curtis] are already in the area having conducted a test on the Genesis Device, a tool that allows life to be created from 'lifelessness which is an effect that may well have reanimated both the desolate planet and the body of Spock, although Spock, like the planet, is aging rapidly with both facing destruction in just a matter of hours.

To complicate matters further still, a Klingon Bird of Prey warship lays cloaked in the planet's orbit, while its owners led by Klingon Commander Kruge [Christopher Lloyd] who is normally so gentle and eccentric on screen, is wonderfully despicable as Commander Kruge, yet also very funny, where the Commander Klingon takes the Genesis Device scientists and a now-teenaged Spock prisoner in an effort to get their hands on the Genesis Device to use as a weapon. When alerted Admiral James T. Kirk wants to discuss a cease fire, a lot of actors would just let the Klingon make-up do the acting and read Commander Kruges retort as you might expect. Instead, Commander Kruge tells his underling to Put him on screen, his voice dripping with sarcasm and surprise. Its a genuinely laugh-out-loud moment. Eschewing the rule that only the even-numbered STAR TREK Sci-Fi franchise films are any good, STAR TREK III: THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK works largely because it's the middle chapter in a three-story arc, which sees Admiral James T. Kirk reunited with his old friend Spock, as well as the added presence of Admiral James T. Kirk's son David [Merritt Butrick].

But like most good STAR TREK Sci-Fi Trek pictures, even the burgeoning special effects are outgunned by the performances of the original crew, due in part to the direction of Leonard Nimoy, whose STAR TREK candle had been relit after the success and subsequent burn out caused by STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN [1982]. It doesn't quite get wrapped up until the STAR TREK IV: VOYAGE HOME [1998] but STAR TREK III: THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK always has been, and always will be, one of the best STAR TREK Sci-Fi film franchise sequels. STAR TREK III: THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK was a big box office success, critically and financially, proving that STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN was no fluke or one off wonder Sci-Fi film. After a failed cinematic launch, it became obvious that the STAR TREK Sci-Fi film franchise was in good hands. Now all that was left to do was make a really good STAR TREK IV: VOYAGE HOME. The Adventure Continues. . .

Blu-ray Video Quality  Paramount Pictures UK has once again done a superb excellent job in giving us a wonderful 1080p encoded image, with an equally impressive 2.35:1 Panavision aspect ratio. But when you the film starts it has for a short while a window-boxed aspect ratio presentation and I got worried this is what the film would look like and look very grainy, but I think this was deliberate, as it was near the end of STAR TREK II just to set the story up. Then when the film actually starts, you get a wonderful sharp transfer, and I would say a vast improvement over the inferior DVD release. The model effects shots in the Spacedock interior resolve all the little windows and lights in much greater clarity than ever before. Colours are quite strong and you have got to love those burgundy uniforms. The contrast range is excellant, with rich blacks during the space scenes. Paramount Pictures UK has also put in a tremendous amount of work cleaning up or digitally painting out the dirt and debris commonly associated with optically-composited special effects of the era. Overall the transfer in some respects is very impressive. It's absolutely the best-looking edition so far of the Sci-Fi film to appear on this particular Blu-ray disc, and of course indisputably superior to the inferior DVD release.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Paramount Pictures UK has once again done a superb excellent job with the audio experience, in giving us a brilliant awesome 7.1 Dolby TrueHD Surround track. The audio experience is nicely loud and clear, and gives all your speakers a good workout. Many of the sound effects, especially the transporter beam and phasors, are well delivered. As a Sci-Fi film from 1984, surround usage was slightly moderate at best. Nonetheless, there are a few good ship fly-bys, and wind on the Genesis planet blows through all the rear channels. James Horner's luscious film music score has solid stereo separation. Still, all in all, this is the best audio sound presentation you will get to hear with this remastered Blu-ray disc with this Limited Edition SteelBook presentation.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

No. 1 Audio Commentary by Director Leonard Nimoy, Writer/Producer Harve Bennett, Director of Photography Charles Correll and Robin Curtis: First up is Leonard Nimoy and talks in-depth about STAR TREK III and informs us that this was his first feature film he has directed, and does slight go over the top and especially about the end of STAR TREK III, which I just cannot understand why he has to go to great length to describe what you are seeing what you are viewing also and is a complete mystery, because fans of STAR TREK will know every detail of the storyline and will of course seen all of the STAR TREK films many times and probably knows more about the film than Leonard Nimoy, despite him directing it, so unfortunately Leonard Nimoy is just sadly stating the obvious and someone should of stepped in and stopped him droning on and repeating all of the details about the ending of STAR TREK III. Leonard gives great praise about Christopher Lloyd and especially the way he could be a chameleon with his character, especially when Leonard saw him read the part of the Klingon leader, and on top of all that Leonard really liked his character in the TV Series Taxi. With Robin Curtis [Savaak] talks a great deal about her performance in the film and also talks about the first time she met Leonard Nimoy and after her test shoot of course got the job. Harve Bennett felt Spock had set the scene, especially on the Vulcan planet and showing us the character of the makeup of the Vulcan people. Leonard tells us he had great praise in Gene Roddenberry especially have forethought with introducing us the character of Spock and especially introducing us to the Vulcan Mind Meld which of course now everyone excepts this whenever we see Spock uses this method on people. One thing Leonard felt about directing this film, that he was on trial and directing this film would hopefully leave a lasting legacy on especially making sure a good job has been done and the Trekkie fans would give him the thumbs up. Another aspect of the film for Leonard that he was very pleased with, is when everyone arrives back on the Vulcan planet and there has to be the Vulcan Mind Meld from Dr. Bones McCoy to Spock via the Vulcan High Priestess, who was the famous Dame Judith Anderson, well Leonard had admired this wonderful British actress for a very long time and when he contacted Dame Judith Anderson and asked her if she would like to be part of the film, well Dame Judith Anderson said it would be a great honour. Harve Bennett felt STAR TREK III was a lot of fun and talks about his favourite line in the picture, because with his long experience in American Television you was censored a lot, especially with certain words, especially fending off the censors and talks about the engineer Scotty when he gets in the lift to go up to the rebel Starship U.S.S. Enterprise, and when you hear the lift voice say, level please and Scotty replies, transporter room and then says, up your shaft, Harve Bennett always laughs whenever he sees this scene, because working in film he is allowed to let the actors say what they want without the censors breathing down on Harve, which would not be able to have an actor say those words on American Television. Leonard informs us that the Paramount film set for the scenes on Planet Genesis, was the actual film set used by Cecil B. DeMille [Filmmaker] used in the film The Ten Commandments [1956] All in all, everyones contribution in the audio commentary was a really enjoyable experience. Anyway despite this, I really enjoyed this very interesting audio commentary.

No. 2 Audio Commentary by Ronald D. Moore and Michael Taylor: Neither Ronald D. Moore is an American screenwriter and television producer. Ronald Dowl Moore is best known for his work on Star Trek; on the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica television series and Michael Taylor is best known for his work as a writer for both Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and Star Trek: Voyager, and both of them have no direct connection to this STAR TREK III Sci-Fi film, but both are big massive geeky STAR TREK fans. They also talk endless vacuous nonsense about the STAR TREK Sci-Fi film franchise's continuity and this STAR TREK III Sci-Fi film. Also something that got on my nerves is that Ronald D. Moore tells us when he was very young and went to see this film when it was released in the cinema, he illegally took in a tape cassette recorder and recorded the whole film on cassette tapes. Also these two nerds are totally obsessed about William Shatners hair piece, again how pathetic can you be, and boy if ever I bumped into these two at a party and again they started droning on about STAR TREK like they do in this audio commentary, they would bore the pants off me and as far as I am concerned these two nerds were the worst audio commentary I have ever heard and it was an insult to my hearing experience.

Special Feature: Production: Here you get a selection of four different features and they are as follows:

01. Captains Log [2002] [1080p] [1.78:1] [26:12] When STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN had been release in the cinema and was a massive box office hit, Paramount Pictures contacted Harve Bennett [Writer/Producer] to immediately do a screenplay for STAR TREK III. William Shatner talks about the graceful way Spock sadly passed away and Leonard Nimoy was asked to be in STAR TREK III, especially giving him great praise for his performance, but after all the back slapping and fawning, Leonard Nimoy tells the Executives that if they wanted him back he would only do it if he directed the film. Eventually Michael Eisner told Leonard that in his contract he said he didn't want to be in the next STAR TREK film, but Leonard tells him this is not true and told him to look at the contract again and Leonard was proved right and so was given the go ahead to direct STAR TREK III, but there was one slight problem, is that Leonard had never directed any film before and had to ask for William Shatner for help and over short period guided him, until Leonard was confident enough to do direct the film. Ralph Winter [Associated Producer] says that Leonard was marvellous and was also great fun directing the film. Charles Correll [Director of Photography] talks about how he would have liked more location work, but due to logistic problems they finally had to shoot everything on the Paramount film sound stage 15, and especially the scenes on the Planet Genesis. Robin Curtis [Savaak] also praises Christopher Lloyd and enjoyed working with him, especially being very visceral and was also very funny. But with an eight week shoot Robin enjoyed it immensely, but the only part of the film that made her feel uncomfortable was when Savaak had to tell Admiral James T. Kirk that his son David was dead. But as we come to this very interesting special, Leonard Nimoy reflects on his Directing of STAR TREK III and also gives great praise to fellow actors and friends, but at the very end William Shatner comes out with a very poignant comment, thats the story of STAR TREK.

02. Terraforming and The Prime Directive [2002] [1080p] [1.78:1] [25:53] Here we start off with David Brin [Author] informing us why he loves Science Fiction, which feels is on several levels and feels STAR TREK covers all aspects, especially with the films STAR TREK II and START TREK III on our hopes and dreams it will happen in reality and that hopefully things will get better for all humanity in the near future. We also get some input from Chris McKay [Research Scientist at NASA Ames Research Center] which is situated at the Moffett Federal Airfield in California's Silicon Valley, where he reflects on STAR TREK II and the creation of new life like with the Genesis Project, but of course in reality you can of course destroy a planet, but you cannot at the moment create a new planet and prime example is about trying to turn Mars into a habitual planet and comments on the fact to make it fit to have humans live on it like Earth would take at least a 100 years to change the environment like Earth. Dr. Louis Friedman [Executive Director at The Planetary Society] and also basically agrees with the synopsis about living on Mars. But one thing I found so totally boring was whenever Chris McKay talked about making life on mars, because he was like a technical nerd and also had the most boring voice that could have easily sent me off to sleep and should of been left his video footage on the cutting room floor.

03. Industrial Light & Magic: The Visual Effects of STAR TREK [2009] [1080p] [1.78:1] [13:50] This is an overview of the special effects work done on the STAR TREK Sci-Fi films. From the start we get the statement Visual Effects has always been a part of making pictures. We are also told that back in the good old days, before computer graphics, it was really a team effort, and they didn't have the facility of Video Anamatics to be able to show the Director what the effects he wanted, it all had to be first done with a storyboard showing all the different angels that would eventually be able to viewed in the film. But what we hear from all the contributors is all the technical problems they encountered with the three STAR TREK films, but despite this, they a brilliant fun time producing all the special effects, because at the time compared to todays technology, it was very primitive. But what I liked is hearing all the technical details on how the special effects were produced. But one thing with all the contributors was enjoying destroying the Starship U.S.S. Enterprise in STAR TREK III and you hear in great detail how it was all done, but of course today everything is done with computer graphics, but way back then the first three STAR TREK films, everything was done by models and had a great time in creating some really spectacular special effects for real.

04. Spock: The Early Years [2009] [1080p] [1.78:1] [6:22] Here we get to meet the actor Stephen Manley [Spock Aged 7] who talks about his experience working on STAR TREK III and informs us that he has been a child and teen actor since 1970, but now as an adult he has been involved in film and television for many years, but when he got the call, they informed him that they might have a part for him in STAR TREK III and when he walked into the room for an interview, who should be there was Leonard Nimoy himself, and a week after the interview he got a call to do a line up with the other child actors to see if they all look ideal for a young Spock and of course got the part. When the film had finished shooting Stephen went off to the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California in October 1984, and studied film and fine art, where he also produced a couple of films, but finally ended up in the production side of the film industry, and in 2005 Stephen started to attend Conventions, which he really enjoyed. But overall Stephen feels he has had a gifted life and enjoyed everything in his career.

Special Feature: The STAR TREK Universe: Here you get to view five separate categories and they are as follows:

01. Space Docks and Birds of Prey [2002] [1080p] [1.78:1] [27:49] Here we get to hear that on STAR TREK II they had a lot more money to spend on the special effects. We also get to hear about how the design for the Starship U.S.S Excelsior (NX-2000, later NCC-2000) which was based on a Japanese Industrial Design and the Klingon ship had to be designed like a Bird of Prey on the instructions of Leonard Nimoy. But Scott Farrar is always being asked, what is it like between the technology of today, compared to the technology of photo chemical, well with the old style special effects, everything had to look clean, especially the spaceships, but of course with computer technology you do not have to worry about such technical detail problems, and he says that STAR TREK III really opened up to the technology revolution.

02. Speaking Klingon [2002] [1080p] [1.78:1] [21:04] Here we are introduced to Marc Okrand who is an American Linguist who works on the closed caption system for American Television. But he was also the one who created the Vulcan and Klingon dialogue and was invited to work on STAR TREK III and what would happen the actors would speak in English. This has got to be the worst 21:04 of boring drivel I have ever had to endure!

03. Klingon and Vulcan Costumes [0000] [1080p] [1.78:1] [0:00] Here we are introduced to Mandy Spock and no this is not a joke and Mandy and her partner were the ones that designed all of the Klingon and Vulcan costumes and started her business in 1979 and they also design all the jewellery costumes which Mandy shows off all the actual items that were in three of the STAR TREK films. We also get to meet Robert Fletcher [Costume Designer] who also designs clothes for the STAR TREK films.

Special Feature: Star Trek and the Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame [2009] [1080p] [1.78:1] [17:00] With this special feature we are in Seattle in Washington at the now famous The Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame that was founded by Paul Allen and Jody Patton and opened to the public on the 18th June, 2004. It incorporated the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame which had been established in 1996. The museum was divided into several galleries with common themes such as ""Homeworld,"" ""Fantastic Voyages,"" ""Brave New Worlds,"" and ""Them!"" Each gallery is displayed with related memorabilia, which include movie props, first editions, costumes, and models in large display cases, posters, and interactive displays to sketch out the different subjects. Here we get to meet Mark Rahner who is a veteran critic, interviewer and pop culture writer at the Seattle Times newspaper and he is here to do a fascinating interview with Harve Bennett [Writer/Producer] as they do a personal guided tour of the museum exhibition, where get to view some very rare items relating to STAR TREK memorabilia. Mark asks Harve about his experience with being involved with Science Fiction films and both of them do the special Vulcan hand gesture that William Shatner was not able to do, they had to fix his fingers so it looked like he could do the Vulacn hand gesture. Harve explains that science fiction has been divided into two sections, pessimistic and optimistic, and of course with Gene Roddenberry concept, this is where all this started. Also Harve says he is not a science fiction person, but has been involved with an enormous amount of science fiction films. Harve talks about personalities of the main characters in the STAR TREK films and especially the vanity issue of William Shatner abour ageing, which Harve cleverly resolved. Others contributors include Jacob McMurray [Senior Curator of EMP|SFM] and John Brooks Peck [Curator of EMP|SFM] and talk about their involvement with the museum, and informs us that there is well over 600 items relating to all aspect of Science Fiction items and three quarters are related to STAR TREK memorabilia. As we slowly come to the end of this very special feature and the tour of the museum, Mark asks Harve well this about ends our journey, Harve if you was the Captain and able to be sitting in the Captains chair and ask to take the Starship out, and Harve replies, in the space dock, I would take it very slowly, but with impulse power, I would stick my head outside the hatch and look out that way, as I do not trust the screen. Harve replies, It has been a pleasure, and thank you Mark.

05. Starfleet Academy SCISEC Brief 003: Mystery Behind the Vulcan Katra Transfer [2009] [1080p] [1.78:1] [2:42] This is the third in a series of plot recaps hosted as though they were Starfleet instructional videos at the Starfleet Academy, Ex Astris, Scientia, San Francisco MMCLXI. In this episode, Starfleet Science Officer [Sarah Backhouse] from the 24th century examines the mysticism around the Vulcan Katra Transfer. The Katra, or living spirit, was the essence of the Vulcan mind and could be transferred to another person moments before death.

Theatrical Trailer [1984] [1080p] [2.40:1] [1:08] Here you get to view the Original Theatrical Trailer for the film STAR TREK III: THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK and is a really exciting presentation in giving you a dramatic build up to what you will experience watching this particular STAR TREK film.

Special Feature: BD-LIVE: To view the contents via your Blu-ray player, it has to be connected to the internet; otherwise it is not BD-LIVE capable. For possible solutions to resolve this problem, please consult your Blu-ray player manual.

Finally, STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN and STAR TREK III: THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK is about total sacrifice. In STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN, Spock gave his life for his shipmates and to save the Starship U.S.S. Enterprise. So, while the sluggish beginning and ending slightly mar this particular STAR TREK Sci-Fi film outing somewhat, there is still enough to please the most adamant Trekkie fan here to please them of this series, and, to a lesser extent, cinema-goers in general. Highly Recommended!

226248,5,6300213501,"Another Marc Daniels gem. While not as enthralling as The Doomsday Machine, this episode was great in its own right. The location shooting makes this a must see for any Trek fan.

This episode is one of the few episodes from The Original Series where I wish the producers of TNG would have given us an update as to how the arms race between the Villagers and the Hill People had been resolved. Did it result in internecine warfare and strife (As In Black vs. White relations In North America) or were things resolved (As In The Northern Ireland Conflict)?

The episode has the sexiest woman to ever appear in TOS. Nancy Kovack was sultry and so irresistible. Using that root and her own feminine wiles I can see how men would be enthralled by her beauty. She's the woman every man would dream about.

While my friends disagreed with Kirk's arming the Hill People I agreed completely. a balance of power is the only way to prevent one side from having overwhelming power. I feel Kirk was right.

This episode is interesting for its raw sexuality. Nona, a married Kanutu woman openly seduces Kirk and admits to seducing Tyree as well. in the end, Nona's greed for power destroys her. But the attempted gang rape and her subsequent murder surprised me. I'd never have thought that would be broadcast on 1960s television. But her death is what catapults Tyree to becoming a killer. The man who fights to avenge his woman or child is the most dangerous foe to behold.

Spock's recovery from a near fatal musket wound is directed remarkably as was the portrayal of doctor M' Benga by Booker Bradshaw. all of the supporting players were great. This is an episode I highly recommend. I'm proud to be the sixth person to review it and the fourth to give it a Five Star Review.

226798,3,6300213501,"Admiral James T. Kirk and crew are headed back to Earth after their harrowing encounter with Khan. All are still grieving the loss of Spock, who sacrificed himself to fix the warp drive, letting the Enterprise escape the blast radius of the Genesis Device. The Device was designed to be used on a lifeless planet to make it habitable. The explosion has indeed created an Earth-like planet. Spock's coffin, a torpedo tube fired from the Enterprise, was caught in the planet's gravity and landed on the planet. A science vessel with Kirk's son David and the Vulcan Saavik investigate the planet. They discover life form reading right by Spock's coffin! David and Saavik beam down to investigate.

Meanwhile, the crew of the Enterprise are informed the Genesis Device is is a political hot-potato--they shouldn't discuss it with anybody and travel there is restricted. The only problem is McCoy. He has been acting very Spock-like. After talking with Spock's father, Kirk realizes that Spock has transferred is katra or soul to McCoy and that should be brought to Vulcan along with Spock's body. If not, Spock will truly be gone. Realizing how desperate the situation is, Kirk and his main crew members steal the Enterprise and head off to the Genesis planet, where more complication ensue, because the Klingons have shown up and want their own doomsday device.

So the plot is rather busy and does look contrived at points (stealing the Enterprise by jury-rigging an automation system to run the whole ship from the bridge has so many problems with it). The Klingons are one dimensional but still fun (the Klingon commander is played by Christopher Lloyd, who played Doc Brown in Back to the Future!). The story serves to get Spock back from the dead and sets up the light-hearted Star Trek IV. So it's a good transition film but not a great film by any means. Watching it once or twice is plenty.",1467763200,,1895,4.827692307692308

226861,3,6300213501,"Of all the ""original"" Star Trek movies, this has to be the biggest double edged sword.  While the movie is one of the most meaningful it is also one of the worst filmed and produced.  I do say that with a very heavy heart as I prefer Kirk to Pichard any time.

Star Trek III's underlying plot is truly the one of friendship between Spock and Kirk.  The primary plot is that of honorable intentions gone awry.  In this instance those of one Dr. David Marcus and his desire to make something out of nothing with his Genesis project.  It should be noted that Christopher Lloyd turns in one ofgis worst performances ever as Klingon Commander Kruge.",1464566400,,644,4.461538461538462

226909,3,6300213501,"Star Trek 3 The Search for Spock was always kind of interesting film to me.  I watched it recently for the first time in many years on Netflix.  I always thought of it as a pretty good movie but not a great film.  Some of the special effects really look dated by todays standards.  I felt like a lot of plot elements were left out or raised questions that went unanswered.  I never understood why Kruge just didn't beam his girlfriend aboard his ship before destroying the little human traitor ship.  What was Kruge lust for the Genesis torpedo?  Did he want to fire it at Earth or hold the Federation Hostage?  I Felt like they kind of shortchanged the failure of the Genesis project except for the simple conversation between Saavik and David in the movie.  The Klingons destroy the other Federation science ship so easily with 1 shot I found that a little hard to believe especially if they had shields.
.
My favorite part of the film is when Kirk and company steal the Enterprise out of Space Dock.  I always smile and get a kick out of that scene wonderfully done.  Seeing the destruction of the Enterprise was pretty spectacular as well.  One of the best shots of the movie is when The Enterprise taxis into Space Dock and all the people stare at all the battle damage done to the ship out the big windows.  It is a very moving and cool scene to look at.

The movie definitely has some great moments but does seem to drag in a few spots.  I kind of expected to see more grieving of the loss of Kirks son on his mind once they got Spock to safety on Vulcan.  I would rank the first 6 films in this order 2,4,6,3,5,1.  Though 3 might be low on that list it is definitely a much better movie than 1 and 5 no doubt about it.  It is too bad Kirstie Alley did not come back for the role of Saavik I thought she did a decent job in the 2nd film.

Overall I would rate this a 3  to 4 star movie.  I think it often gets ignored because 2 and 4 were such good films and 3 was just a little above average.",1458518400,,2000,4.142857142857143

227034,1,6300213501,"I have been a fan of Star Trek the Original Series since it first aired in Sept. 1966. I watched the ""Man Trap"" on a B/W TV in my bedroom. I subsequently made the case to my father to see the remaining episodes on the RCA Color Console set in the living room. I saw every episode when it first aired (all three seasons), with the exception of the ""Trouble with Tribbles"" (Dec 1967). A death in the family required that I travel by train to attend a funeral in the midst of winter. There were no TV's in the club car. I had to wait until the upcoming summer to see it in rerun. (Those were the days before VHS, let alone streaming content.)

I do not lightly criticize the much awaited movies which finally appeared some 12 years later. The 1st movie introduced improved models, better special effects and new characters. We could forgive minor shortcomings of this 1st effort. We were glad to have the franchise return, albeit in movie form.

It is not an overstatement to say that Nicholas Meyer course corrected the movie franchise (after its less than stellar start with ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"") with the ""Wrath of Khan"" giving us a fitting sequel to the STOS episode ""Space Seed.""

But where ""Wrath of Khan"" succeeds ""The Search for Spock"" fails miserably, wasting characters and opportunities.

I endured the ""Search for Spock"" when it first appeared in theatres. Recently I forced my self to suffer through it again. My opinion has not changed and I share it now. It would have been better if this movie had remained stillborn on the cutting room floor. What a waste of celluloid.",1443398400,,1594,4.562937062937063

It's goal, among other things, is to capture the essence of Star Trek. So, I wanted to see what he was talking about. Yes, I believe they did capture the essence of Star Trek and remained true to the original characters.
There is a little weakness in the plot as to why a Klingon would risk war with the federation to go after the so-called ""weapon"" of genesis, and it starts out a little slow, but otherwise, it's a marvelous Star Trek movie.
I like the way this movie adds to the lore around Vulcan mysticism. It presents Kirk without Spock, which is kinda of like ying without yang. But it is the tension of the division of the inseparable duo separated that adds to the movie's tension. This made a marvelous Saturday afternoon.",1437782400,,878,4.49375

227385,5,6300213501,"As far as my touchstone Star Trek movie goes, I most enjoy THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK.
A direct sequel to THE WRATH OF KHAN, it starts with the wounded Enterprise and crew putting into port for repairs and shore leave. However, when Dr. McCoy begins to exhibit symptoms of multiple personalities--one of which seems like that of fallen commrade Spock--Captain Kirk believes the remedy lies in returning to the newly created Genesis Planet. When Kirk's request is denied by Star Fleet brass (due to the controversial nature of the Genesis teraforming device) The Enterprise crew rebel and begin a frantic ""search"" for not only a cure for McCoy, but one that will totally revive the existence of Spock.

THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK spans Earth, the Genesis Planet, and finally the Vulcan home world in beautiful technical detail and with a script that explores the concept of ""the needs of the few outweigh the needs of the many"" (which is a twist on the concept explored in KHAN: ""The needs of the many outweigh the needs o the few""). Thus, the series's signature morality play is preserved, though limited to mainly Kirk's sacrifices. Therein lies the one weakness in SEARCH: Not showing what everyone truly gave up. Though it can be argued that the crew's careers in Star Fleet, filled with infinite adventure and peril, is enough implication. But for a much deeper look into what each of the crew sacrificed, a reading of the Vonda McIntyre novelization is highly recommended.

As for the direction of SEARCH, Leonard Nimoy's turn behind the camera is refreshing, in that it gives every one of The Enterprise crew memorable lines or scenes--not just Kirk, McCoy, or Spock. Nimoy also bravely goes where few big screenTrek directors have: Television. A pool of sturdy TV actors (such as James B. Sikking, John Laroquette, and Phillip Allen) fill the guest cast. Most notable, however, is then TAXI star Christopher Lloyd being tapped to play the villain Kruge. Despite the choice being panned by some critics and fans, Christopher Lloyd's performance is effective. Kruge isn't as flamboyant as predecessor Khan nor sympathetic as latter day Klingon Gorkon and his crafty General Chang, thus leaving the stage for The Enterprise and crew to shine brightest. Lloyd simply plays Kruge as a straightforward bad guy: But, it's one with a singular, vicious desire to ""seize the secret of [the Genesis] weapon"" and whom spares no expense in carrying it out.

The special effects are excellent, featuring two new starship designs (The Excelsior and The Grissom); an extension of the Klingon physiology and ship designs; and wonderful civilian settings on Earth and Vulcan. A bar scene featuring McCoy and a ""backwards"" alien is a standout.

All-in-all, THE SERCH FOR SPOCK is the most creative and enjoyable of The Old Series movies. It gives viewers a new look at the Star Fleet-Klingon Conflict, a couple of new starships, the effects of Genesis terra forming, and Vulcan mysticism. More importantly, it manages to carry on the rich morality play that the series is--or perhaps ""was""--famous for in entertaining fashion, without being drenched in allegory (a la THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY) or self deprecation (THE VOYAGE HOME).",1434326400,,3208,5.024436090225564

227733,4,6300213501,"Highly enjoyable sequel in the Star Trek franchise.

 This film is not as good as ""Wrath of Khan"", but is very enjoyable never the less and is a worthy sequel.

  Set right after the events of the battle against Khan, the Genesis torpedo device had created a living Earth like planet on a dead moon that had brought back to life of the body of Mr. Spock (The late but still great Leonard Nimoy).

 Captain Kirk figures out that Spock had mind-melded with Bones, transferring his spirit and soul consciousness into Dr. McCoy.  Captain Kirk defies the Federations orders, and steals his own ship in order to find Spock and bring Bones to the magical Mount Selaya on planet Vulcan.

  Along the way a new enemy has surfaced, a Klingon warlord played by actor Christopher Lyoid (Roger Rabbit), who will stop at nothing in his despotic demeanor to obtain the power of the Genesis device in order to use it as a weapon.

  This is a worthy sci fi action adventure addition to the other Star Trek films, and I found not only the scenes of the space ship battles fun but I also had found the mysterious dream like fantasy world of the crumbling unstable Genesis planet the heroes try to navigate through and survive ultimately very captivating.

For the ""Search for Spock"" is the true search for our own very souls.",1422662400,,1307,4.549356223175966

This was ILM in their pre-CGI-ruining-everything stage when so much care was put into starship models, matte painting and incredible set design. The pace is thrilling and to me Christopher Lloyd really shines as the star as the crazy, over-the-top Klingon commander, with a very exciting, explosive (literally) conclusion featuring a self-destructing planet and Kirk and the Klingon commander in a good ol' fashioned fist-fight.

227766,4,6300213501,"Following on the heels of the best Star Trek film, Star Trek II, a lot was expected of this sequel.  Alas, it couldn't top ST II and was arguably the dullest entry in the ST film universe.
The plot has the crew going to try and retrieve the remnants of Spock, hoping that he might've somehow been resurrected by the Genesis phenomenon.  He is and he's taken to Vulcan where his mind can be rejoined with the new body(the mind was in Dr. McCoy, if you remember, at the end of ST II).  In a religious ceremony, Spock is restored and slowly remembers who and what he is.
Though there are action scenes, the plot above is so thin that nothing much happens and we end up just watching an entry in the ST library, bridging the ST II events with the next real mission in ST IV but especially the culmination in ST VI.
So, if you are a Trekker and must have the whole library of films, get this one.  If you are not a Trekker and merely a film or sci-fi buff, there are much better choices on Amazon, including Star Trek's II, IV, and VI plus the enormous sci-fi universe on line for sale.",1417564800,,1081,4.1826923076923075

227784,4,6300213501,"At the end of STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN, one of the series' most beloved characters, the vulcan Spock, made a tragic sacrifice to save the Enterprise which cost him his life. However, even Leonard Nimoy (who simply IS the character) felt that fans were horrified at the fate of Spock, so he helmed this second sequel, aptly titled THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK. Even though the plot does not have the depth and sophistication of its predecessor and some scenes run longer than necessary (notably during the first fourty minutes), Nimoy compensates for this with some breathtaking action set pieces (the whole scene where Kirk and company steal the Enterprise and the climactic confrontation with a nasty Klingon commander -- wonderfully played by Christopher Lloyd) and engrossing scenes of character development. Furthermore, the performances are all top-notch -- even William Shatner manages to turn in some surprisingly effective moments of genuine acting. It has been widely stated that the odd-numbered STAR TREK films are inferior to the even-numbered ones, but STAR TREK III is an exception to the rule. Actually, it's better to appreciate this film as the second entry to a three-act space adventure (beginning with II and ending with STAR TREK IV: THE VOYAGE HOME), as it obviously ends with the words ""the Adventure Continues"".

227801,3,6300213501,"In this third movie of the TOS movie franchise, Kirk, McCoy and the senior officers of the Enterprise go on a daring mission to bring peace and rest for their departed friend, to find a dangerous force awaits them on arrival.  Spoiler alert follows.

This movie is not brilliant nor a flop.  It is a competently done movie that has a reasonably good story, though this does drag along at times.  As with the following two films, this movie explores some of the more philosophical and religious themes in Sci-Fi, such as the nature of the self, the meaning of death, and the need to balance duty to what one has sworn to uphold with the duty one has to one's friends.

The movie contains some good moments - the fate of Kirk's son David, the recovery of Spock, and the self-destruction of the Enterprise are examples.  Yet the villains (Klingons) are a clunky element in the plot, Saavik (whose character should have been given more depth) is marginalised, and the omission of Carol Marcus (who should at least have been given a scene or two, especially after what happens to David) is questionable.  There is a good mix of humour, action and seriousness, done well enough.

I feel the movie could have done without some of the mystical mumbo-jumbo, especially around Spock's death and (odd) resurrection.  It was good in the reboot movie 'Star Trek: Into Darkness' that Kirk's similar 'resurrection' theme was handled lightly and with a good sense of humour, instead of the sombre, maudlin way it was handled in ST III.  There was no need to spend such a long period of time in the movie on Vulcan mysticism and religion (would Spock as a logical, scientific man have believed in such nonsense anyway?) which could have been handled much more lightly, and should have been a sub-plot at most.  Countless other SF movies and television series have done the same without bringing religious themes into the equation.  One gets the impression the film is in some way tinged with an anti-science bias, especially in relation to the fate of the 'Genesis Planet'  which self destructs after David includes 'proto-matter' in the device (why wasn't this mentioned in ST II, where so many died to get the device?).  This spoils an otherwise good film and is the reason I give it 3 rather than four stars.

If you are not into Trek, this film can be safely missed - there are much better offerings in the franchise.  One for the fans.",1410825600,,2423,4.665882352941177

227818,3,6300213501,"Whereas 'The Wrath of Khan' was Star Trek's foray into true action-adventure, The Search for Spock is Star Trek's more contemplative outing. The film picks up right where WoK left off. Spock is launched from the Enterprise after his self-sacrifice and the crew, especially Kirk, are left distraught. But when McCoy seems to be possessed by Spock's katra, Kirk learns that Spock can be resurrected if his body is brought to a Vulcan mountain and Spock's katra is transplanted back into his body. The plot is bazaar to say the least, in many ways mirroring the sacrifice and resurrection of Jesus Christ. This is especially odd considering just how different the dramatic drive behind WoK was. This contrast is why the Star Trek films are known for being incredibly inconsistent. The series approaches the many themes and sub-genres of science-fiction with very mixed results. In the case of Search for Spock, the outcome is a bit of a lukewarm affair. Kruge, although not terrible, is no Khan. SoS has none of the genuine thrills of WoK, and the fight scene between Kirk and Kruge is downright laughable. As far as the story goes, it comes off like an epilogue to WoK. SoS could have probably been condensed down into a 10-minute short film and tacked on to the end of WoK as an extended afterword. It drags quite a bit, and the sub-plot with Kruge only serves as an unnecessary distraction from the situation at hand. Despite the problematic storyline, SoS is quite accomplished on a pure filmmaking level. Leonard Nimoy proves to be a more than capable director. There are quite a few stunning shots on Genesis and the final scenes on the Vulcan home planet are gorgeous. The special effects are cheesy by today's standards, but not totally distracting. The music by James Horner is grand and Shatner as Kirk is a bit more restrained but still undeniably daffy. SoS will forever lurk in the shadow of WoK, as it in inferior to it in almost every imaginable way. It's not a complete waste of time, though. The story is interesting enough to keep the viewer's attention until the end and the film itself is technically proficient.",1402358400,,2129,4.772357723577236

227977,3,6300213501,"Having finally re-watched this movie for the first time in a couple decades, I have to admit that it didn't age very well.  A lot of the scenes that I remembered as dramatic and moving come off a little too cheesy, and a lot of the special effects (particularly the representation of the Genesis planet, but other things as well) just look cheap.  While the films that bookend this one, ""Wrath of Khan"" and ""Voyage Home"" are low-budget Star Trek films that still manage to look pretty good and have held up over the years, ""Search for Spock"" is a low-budget Star Trek film that hasn't.  It's still an enjoyable movie, but you have to have a much higher suspension of disbelief to buy into this one.  And what's with Kirk just casually destroying the Enterprise?  In any previous TV show or movie he would have found a way out, but here when backed into a corner, he immediately decides to self-destruct?  That's the best the script writers could come up with?

As for the bonus features on the second disc of the Special Collector's Edition - I haven't finished watching them all yet, but nothing has really stood out and made me glad I bought the collector's edition.  Particularly bad is the ""Terraforming"" feature, which theoretically is tied to the movie by a discussion of the technical and ethical aspects of the Genesis project, but which quickly goes off topic and becomes  20+ minute discussion of how we should terraform Mars.  It's OK if you enjoy that sort of thing, but it really has nothing to do with the movie.

All in all, I'm glad I bought the movie in order to have a complete collection of the original cast films, but I'm also glad I didn't pay full price for it.",1384473600,,1684,4.524752475247524

228077,4,6300213501,"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan reinvigorated the franchise and hit what is pretty much universally acknowledged as a high note with its strong characterization, flamboyant villain, and an emotionally gut-wrenching finale. But, where to go from there? This was the question put before producer Harve Bennett and star/director Leonard Nimoy when it came time to produce the third Star Trek feature film.

Perhaps inevitably, Star Trek III: The Search for Spock somewhat lacks its own identity, being a film that resolves many of the narrative loose ends of its predecessor and restoring order to a universe in chaos. The story revolves around restoring Spock's essence (or katra, as its called here) to his body and reuniting the crew of the USS Enterprise. If Wrath of Khan focused on aging and death, Search for Spock rather explores the nature of friendship and life. Worthy material, to be sure, but Spock's reputation as one of the odd-numbered Treks is not one of the highest in the franchise. We have elements that don't quite work: a bar scene that invites comparison with Star Wars' Mos Eisley cantina (and it is not favorable), some lackluster effects work for the Genesis planet that breaks suspension of disbelief, microbes evolving into worms, Vulcan puberty subplots, and Christopher Lloyd's surprisingly incompetent Klingon villain. None of these are truly awful, but the lack of polish in their execution brings a level of hokum to the film that was mostly absent from its superior predecessor. Yet the film also has many fine moments: the old crew going rogue and stealing the Enterprise to rescue their old friend, Kirk reacting to another devastating loss, the noble destruction of a series icon, and of course the long-awaited reunion at the finale; these moments resonate deeply. Ultimately, even if it struggles to escape the shadow of and lacks the narrative finesse of the second film, Search for Spock accomplishes its goal of restoring balance to the Trek universe and is a worthwhile film.

With rather pleasing transfers of the first two films in the series, it's unfortunate that Search for Spock's transfer is somewhat disappointing. While still clearly high-definition, the smoothness of the transfer betrays substantial digital scrubbing of the image, and as a result the level of visible detail is somewhat lacking. The lossless audio track fares better, really coming to life in the third act as the Genesis planet falls apart all around Kirk and the Klingon commander.

The Corbomite Manuever is better, and has a better ending. It's the first episode I remember seeing as a kid. It's a little slow and lacks any sort of action, but much better represents the Trek I came to love.

Growing up, I always loved Star Trek II and IV, but always felt like this was the ""boring"" one of this particular story arc.  I only watched it again a couple of times, unlike watching Star Trek IV to the point of line memorization, lol.  However, now that I am older and have been married for 7 years, have gone to college, have purchased a house, have suffered the loss of my father, I know so much about what it is to truly live and how the people in your life are such a HUGE part of that.  In Star Trek III, we get to see the relationships between the characters like never before.  Part of the reason we really get a feel for the connection between the crew members is because they have acted together for so long, but it is also because the writing and directing of this film is superb.  You really get a good sense of the DEEP and loving relationship between Bones, Jim, and Spock--especially between Jim and Spock.  They are, for all intents and purposes, like a married couple (but not in a sexual sense.)  The moment when Spock has his catra back and turns around and looks at Jim after walking by--it is a heart stopping moment.  The love between the two is so great and so heartfelt in just a little exchange between Jim and Spock.

228148,3,6300213501,"This is for the two-disc special edition, which I would recommend as well worth it for the included bonus features. I just re-watched this film, and it was actually better than I remembered. Not perfect, mind you, but really pretty decent, and at moments even great. What I like the most about Star Trek III is the Vulcan mysticism. Some of it is difficult to rationalize or conceptualize, but I like that about it. They are aliens, after all. This film has a spiritual mystique and beauty to it that I find really compelling. There are also a handful of truly iconic, cinematic moments, both in terms of spoken dialogue and images. While this one does not measure up to its masterful predecessor, Star Trek II, there is a line spoken by Kirk in the final scene that surprisingly and movingly answers the climax of that film, which I consider an ingenious touch. I will also say that I liked the portrayl of Uhura. These movies are always better when more crew members get real scenes for their individual character development.

Now, to what I dislike about this film. There are in my opinion a few too many moments of ""silly humor"", and some of the Starfleet characters are not as serious in portrayal as I think they should be. Some of the plot elements here and there are a bit hard to buy, maybe a little cheap in terms of storytelling. Christopher Lloyd seems ""off"" as a Klingon. He does not disappear into the character, but rather comes across as Christopher Lloyd playing an unusual Klingon. The big disappointment though, for me, is that Kristy Alley did not return to the role of Vulcan Lt. Saavik. No disrespect intended to Robin Curtis, who assume the character for this film, but it is just not the same. Alley's character smoldered with a scene-stealing charisma that made everything around her more compelling; Curtis' portrayal somehow does not achieve the same effect. And my other disappointment is that the incredibly cool starship Excelsior was not utilized in a more dramatic way. It ends up making a cameo; it could have made this film more thrilling as a plot device.

Not the greatest Star Trek film, not the worst. Definitely worth owning if you are a fan, in particular as the middle installment of the ""trilogy"" of films Star Trek II-III-IV, which are tied together by a nicely continuous story arc.",1345852800,,2327,4.700980392156863
228149,2,6300213501,"While I do own this movie, I do agree with a previous reviewer. That this movie shows why the odd numbered Movies are bad, now Nemoy can say what he wants. But he has been on record saying that he didn't want to come back and play Spock after ""Wrath Of Kahn"", but after seeing the success of Star Trek II. He decided to come back, and direct it. Problem is, Spock died at the end of II. But wait, he downloaded his ""Cotra"" into Mcoy's mind. That's not really the bad part of the movie, He had to put Klingons into the movie. Now having recently watched this movie, one thing I noticed. They weren't necessary to the story, they could've had Kirk after escaping space dock. Encounter the other ship at Genesis, instead of having the Klingons. Kirk could actually take on the federation, to get Spock's body back. But then you wouldn't have the death of his son, but honestly that character didn't really do anything in the movie, same with Saavick. This movie is sloooooooow, and even when you get to the end. The scene of Mccoy, and Spock on two different slabs, so they can transfere spock's mind back into his body to bring him back to life, is incredibley long. It's full of different angle shots of the priestess, raising and lowereing her head. Final word on the movie, not the worst. But it's not that good either, it's slow and tries to put too much into it.",1341360000,,1365,4.377952755905512
228150,4,6300213501,"WARNING:
If you have not yet seen the earlier movies in this series, THIS IS A SPOILER! I cannot tell anything about this movie without explaining its connection to ""The Wrath of Khan.""

So anyone still reading has either already seen ""The Wrath of Khan"" or doesn't mind spoilers. Right? OK: here we go.

At the end of the last episode, Spock was dead, having sacrificed himself to save the Enterprise. He was placed in a coffin-capsule and shot to the surface of the Genesis planet. So Kirk and the remaining crew returned to the Starfleet dry dock for extensive repairs. Unfortunately, the bureaucrats see it differently: they are going to scrap the Enterprise. It's 20 years old, there's a whole new generation of ship design, and it's no longer worth repairing.

Then Spock's father Sarek visits Kirk and discovers that Spock had shared his ""essence"" with McCoy just before he died. Sarek says that Kirk must bring Spock's body and McCoy to the sacred mountain on Vulcan ""so that both can have peace."" Obviously, having Spock in his head is driving McCoy crazy, literally. But the commanding officer of the Starfleet denies Kirk the ship he would need to go fetch Spock's body, and also tells him that the Genesis planet is quarantined and top secret.

So Kirk hijacks the Enterprise with the assistance of Sulu, Chekhov, McCoy, Scotty, his son David, Saavik and (though she stays back at Starfleet HQ) Uhura. They get to Genesis only to find a cloaked Klingon ship that starts firing on them. Fortunately, they have to lower the cloaking device in order to fire, so Kirk gets a second or so to see them and fire his own weapons.

Well, there's a lot more to the story, but the bottom line is they manage to destroy the Klingons, get Spock (in a sense) and McCoy to Vulcan, and restore them to ""normal."" But Kirk's son David sacrifices himself to save Saavik and Spock. And the planet Genesis destroyed itself just after they left. Apparently David had used the wrong sort of material for the Genesis Effect, and it was unstable.

McCoy: You did what you had to do, what you always do; turn certain death, into a fighting chance for life.  The act that prompts this exchange is a profound moment in mythos of Star Trek.  It makes one think of the James T.

228169,5,6300213501,"""The Savage Curtain"" was a mediocre episode and not one I enjoyed.  It was most illogical.  ""All Our Yesterdays"" on the other hand is a remarkably great episode.  When else do you see Kirk not getting the girl and ending up being accused of being a witch?  The best part though is seeing Spock revert to the savage past of his home world.  If you want to continue this episode in book form, get copies of Yesterday's Son and Time for Yesterday by the phenomenal author A. C. Crispin.  Yes, Spock mating with the lovely Zarabeth superbly portrayed by Mariette Hartley had results, namely a son called Zar. Spock finds out to his shock that he has a son.  He and Kirk travel to Vulcan to tell T'Pau about Zar and how family must not be abandoned.  T'Pau agrees and uses her influence with the Federation and Starfleet to authorize Spock and Kirk going to the Guardian of Forever and traveling back to Sarpeidon to rescue Spock's son.  The sequel Time for Yesterday is another time travel trip to the past to see Zar and that's all I will say because anything more could spoil the book.  A. C. Crispin has seamlessly woven both novels with ""All Our Yesterdays"" to make a very believable story.  Spock is shocked to find that his son Zar is a grown man when he had been expecting an infant or very young child.  Even more dismaying from Spock's perspective, is that Zar has a mind of his own and is not especially interested in being obedient. Dr. McCoy is also really great in both books.  His compassion and humor and even stern parental attitude contribute to Spock and Zar making peace with each other.  There are many scenes that simply require laughing out loud as Spock tries to come to terms with being a father.",1319760000,2,1716,4.47588424437299

228172,3,6300213501,"In the summer of 1984, ""Star Trek III: The Search for Spock"" hit movie theaters as the much-anticipated direct sequel to arguably the best Trek ever, ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.""  Without the benefit of writer-director Nicholas Meyer, this new film trusted its success to the most logical (pun, intended) candidate available, Leonard ""Mr. Spock"" Nimoy.  As his directorial film debut, Nimoy would proceed to make a time-efficient and entertaining film on a modest budget with only 105 minutes of running time.  After twenty-seven years, ""The Search for Spock"" still ages fairly well, but its weaknesses become increasingly apparent with repeat viewings (i.e. have you ever noticed how ""Search""'s opening melancholic tone is inexplicably opposite of ""Khan""'s optimistic finale?).

Overall, the largely predictable story often works on all thrusters, including the climatic destruction of the overmatched U.S.S. Enterprise during its showdown with the Klingon battle cruiser, and a devastated Kirk's reaction to his son David's tragic fate.  The sequences involving the theft of the U.S.S. Enterprise from Spacedock and the poignant finale are certainly moments for Nimoy and his team to be very proud of.  The flip side is that Lt. Uhura (Nichelle Nichols) is given so very little to do, as seeing her escape from Starfleet to make the rendezvous on planet Vulcan should have been worthy of at least one quick follow-up scene.  Also, the Genesis set starts off well in conjuring up the illusion of another world, but it becomes increasingly obvious during these 'outdoor' Genesis scenes that ""Star Trek III"" was filmed entirely inside a studio.  Interspersing some real outside location footage to simulate Genesis' garden-like environment gone to hell probably would have made a difference here.

The acting, as expected, is solid and consistent, but this time it not necessarily inspired.  As Admiral Kirk, William Shatner's efforts were better in ""Khan,"" but his big reaction scene over David's fate is arguably the character's finest moment ever on-screen.  The familiar Trek ensemble cast is true to form, though only Kelley as Dr. McCoy is given anything remotely challenging to do.  With that in mind, Kelley deserves the film's acting MVP award for making the most of his bolstered screen time (i.e. his attempted Vulcan nerve pinch on a less-than-amused Starfleet security agent).  Christopher Lloyd, despite yet another role as the black-hat villain, predictably eats up the screen as the nefarious Klingon, Kruge.  Robin Curtis does some nice but relatively bland work as the new Lt. Saavik, as does the late Merritt Butrick again as Kirk's son, David.  Unfortunately, these two actors have only minimal chemistry together.  Kirstie Alley's more interesting presence as Saavik would have been preferable over the age-old soap opera tactic of simply recasting the character.  Finally, look for an amusing Klingon cameo by a heavily made-up John Larroquette as Kruge's last surviving crew member, who is evidently disappointed that Kirk's sarcastic death threat just moments earlier proves to be false.

Ultimately, ""Search"" is intelligent, above-average entertainment that suffers from numerous plot holes (i.e. why is the U.S.S. Enterprise being decommissioned so abruptly? What happened to Carol Marcus?, etc.).  Yet, the movie recycles some classic character elements from the vintage TV series, such as Kirk's fight moves during a climatic battle with Kruge, and the underlying friendship between McCoy and Spock.  The few poignant surprises, unfortunately, come off as sacrificial lambs by screenwriter-producer Harve Bennett to enhance Admiral Kirk's sense of urgency in rescuing Spock (and McCoy's sanity).  Even so, Bennett's lackluster writing efforts at least makes the transition to ""Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home"" in 1986 appear pretty seamless.  In my opinion, Kirk gets the best line when asked by Sulu and Chekov, if they have beengiven Starfleet's permission to save Spock & McCoy.  The admiral's nonchalant reply: ""The word is 'No.'  I am, therefore, going anyway,"" is simply vintage Captain Kirk.

All in all, ""The Search for Spock"" is a Trek worth taking as a bridge to better installments in the ongoing film franchise.

Rating: a solid 7/10 stars (appropriate for ages 10+ for mild profanity and some sci-fi violence).

I like the ambience in the beginning of the film, including its exploration of the Star Trek universe's underworld at the bar and the mercenaries' meeting with the Klingons. Also, the scene in which the crew steals the Enterprise is a classic. The space battle is a good one and the resolution classic Kirk. Yet, halfway through, the film seems to lag. It's quite obvious Spock will be resurrected, but it takes a while. The fight between Kirk and the Klingon is just boring and oddly lacks a memorable soundtrack. The film's denouement on Vulcan takes way too long, almost as long as that of Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, but without the emotional drama. However, the film's underlying problem is that the title gives it all away - namely, the audience knows Spock will be revived. There no suspense in that part. Overall, it defies the old rule that the odd-numbered Star Trek movies are all bad, but it's also not as good as the even-numbered ones.",1311206400,,1009,4.611111111111111

This film is almost as dark in tone as Star Trek II. In a tragic scene, Kirk destroys the USS Enterprise in a desperate attempt to defeat some Klingons! In another tragic scene, the Klingons brutally murder James Kirk's son David! This film is one of the first Star Trek adventures where the Klingons speak their own language. This film recycles matte paintings from The Towering Inferno(1974) and models from Star Trek The Motion Picture(1979). Kirk and Kruge beat eachother up just like in an episode of the Star Trek TV show. Two or three soundstages at Paramount Pictures burned down during the making of the film! William Shatner himself helped to fight the fire with water. The scene where the USS Enterprise is blown up by explosions was filmed upside down to simulate zero gravity and no oxygen. Janice Rand(Grace Lee Whitney) from the Star Trek TV show make a cameo appearance as well as a few Tribbles. A young Miguel Ferrer plays an officer on the USS Excelsior. Some of this film's detractors claim it's corny and some of the stuffier ones claim it's ""very bad""! Star Trek III: The Search for Spock is one of the best of the Star Trek feature films. The story continues in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home(1986).",1310860800,6,1834,4.716510903426792

The last frame shows Nimoy flipping the script for ST III, saying to the offscreen producer, ""I particularly like the part where I rise again on the third day.""

Thankfully, the final result actually did come in more dignified than that. In this one, Nimoy gets to show just how much he knows Star Trek, and flex his directorial muscles. In short, Leonard Nimoy knows Star Trek, probably better than Gene Roddenberry ever did. The characterizations are dead-on perfect, the right amount of humor is present, and the plot never, ever drags. The only problem with this movie is the fact that it's only 90 minutes long, and with a movie as tightly paced as this one, that's short. However, anything else would be seen as padding, so, in the end, it's better to have a really good 90 minute film than a two hour film that's been padded out. Bottom line: It's Star Trek, it's a great movie, and it definitely leaves you wanting more (kind of like having a big meal, then having dessert cancelled).",1305590400,,1256,4.709090909090909

But then, it has to be. From the start, it is based on an inherently hokey premise: after The Wrath Of Khan, another Star Trek movie could only exist if it found a way to bring Spock back from the dead. Of course, there's no way to do that believably.

So, the writers use the crutch of Vulcan mysticism, and invent a ritual whereby Spock can be resurrected. The Vulcans have so many super powers that, by all rights, they really ought to be running the entire Federation. They're already super-smart, super-strong, and live for hundreds of years, and now they also have immortal souls that can be transferred between bodies. Even less believable is the idea that Kirk would know nothing about these aspects of Vulcan culture, despite being best friends with a Vulcan for years. Don't they have liberal arts requirements at Starfleet Academy?

But, miraculously, all this is almost palatable, because they bring back&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mark-Lenard/dp/B000059XU0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mark Lenard</a>&nbsp;as Spock's somber father. For me, much of the appeal of the entire Star Trek franchise comes from its remarkable luck in finding actors with precisely this kind of old-fashioned acting style. Mark Lenard, David Warner, Ricardo Montalban, and even the much-ridiculed William Shatner all have a mannered, theatrical diction and bearing, a style that is unsuitable for realistic, ""modern"" stories, but perfect for depicting epic archetypes. In fact, by the time this movie was made, Star Trek might have been the only place to find this style of acting -- outside this franchise, you'd have to go all the way back to old black-and-white Hollywood films. But there is always a place for this old style. For instance, I admire the acting of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robert-De-Niro/dp/B0006GAOJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robert De Niro</a>, but he'd never have been able to play&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Agamemnon/dp/0140447946/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Agamemnon</a>, or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Odysseus/dp/0374525749/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Odysseus</a>, or, dare I say, Captain Kirk.

So Mark Lenard arrives to deliver the idiotic plot device concocted by the writers, but he is so grave and dignified while doing so that it almost sort of makes sense. Kirk's show of respect for the stern old Vulcan is also quite affecting. The ensuing scenes draw on another one of Star Trek's great strengths, the theme of friendship and loyalty between Kirk and his crew. The entire first half of the movie, up until the first space battle, is excellent, because Kirk's love of his captaincy and his ship was always key to his character, and it is genuinely moving to watch him push himself to sacrifice those things for the sake of friendship. The ending of the first space battle is completely awe-inspiring -- not only because of the sacrifice involved, but because it is a brilliant piece of strategy on Kirk's part. Unlike many Star Trek victories, it is not a deus ex machina (""we suddenly discovered a new type of beam that makes the bad guys spontaneously combust""), but rather, the product of audacious thinking and cunning.

The resolution is less clever, though. Christopher Lloyd, as the Klingon warrior Kruge, is a competent villain (not as good as Ricardo Montalban, but maybe that's an unfair comparison), with an imperious bearing that fits his status as ""lord."" But with him, the franchise began to invent a goofy medievalist warrior culture for the Klingons. In my opinion, this makes it much more difficult to take them seriously as modern, Cold-War-style adversaries. They are much more interesting in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Undiscovered-Country/dp/B0000UJL96/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Undiscovered Country</a>.

And I dislike the way the movie cavalierly dispenses with the entire Genesis story from The Wrath Of Khan. In the second movie, Genesis made a good symbol, one that gave additional meaning to Spock's sacrifice. Furthermore, even though Kirk, due to his adventurous character, can't ever possibly settle down with a wife and son, it was a good touch to show that he still had a family out there somewhere. The way this movie does away with that is pointlessly callous. At least Robin Curtis is a better Saavik than Kirstie Alley, and gets a great, sympathetic scene with the young Spock (too bad they didn't have the guts to show Kirk's reference to her ""condition"" during their goodbye in The Voyage Home).

The conflict ends with a fist-fight in the middle of exploding special effects, which is quite dumb. In the sixties, Shatner had enough youthful machismo to pull that off on the TV series, but here, he's not a very credible contender in hand-to-hand combat. He is a much more convincing leader during the space battles, where he can be daring in his schemes instead of his physical strength.

Perhaps this was the first Star Trek movie where the plot development was visibly influenced by marketing concerns, from the premise to the resolution. A lot of it is quite engrossing, and uses the characters very well. But it's not the one to go to if you want Star Trek at its best.",1290729600,9,5693,5.810778443113772

228202,4,6300213501,"There is an unwritten law concerning the Star Trek movies.  All the even numbered movies (2, 4, 6...) are good, and all the odd numbered movies (1, 3, 5...) are horrible.  I bought into this, to a point.  I completely agree with regard to Motion Picture and Final Frontier.  However, I think that of the original six TOS movies, this one is exempt from the rule.  I don't think it's quite as good as 4 or 6, or anywhere near as good as 2, but I thought it was pretty close.  I think this movie is kind of put alongside 1 and 5 without any real thought put into it.  It isn't quite as good as the even numbered ones, so it's considered horrible.

The third movie in the series starts up a few days, or maybe a week after the events of part 2.  Spock is dead, having sacrificed himself to save the ship.  At the end of part 2, there was a sense of optimism.  Spock is dead, but there is hope that the Genesis planet could possibly heal him.  And Kirk has finally come to terms with the fact that he is getting old, and it not longer bothers him.  At the start of this film, however, everyone appears to be depressed over Spock's death, while in the previous film they seemed to have come to terms with it.  It's like they just decided to overrule what had happened in the previous movie.  On that subject, David Marcus, Kirk's son, is staying behind to study the Genesis planet.  For some reason, his mother, Carol Marcus, is entirely absent from this movie.  I mean, she isn't even talked about.  Her name isn't mentioned once.  I don't really understand why she wouldn't have wanted to stay behind and study the world she helped create.  For some unexplained reason, Saavik also stays behind.  Kirstie Alley did not want to reprise her role, so her actress was replaced.  I don't remember the new Saavik's name, but I couldn't stand her.  She just so wooden and bland, even for a Vulcan.  But she doesn't have as much screen time in this film, so it's okay.

The Enterprise returns to Earth, where they find out that the Enterprise is no longer going to be used by Starfleet.  Starfleet feels that Enterprise is too old and needs to make way for newer ships, like the new Excelsior.  Something so one has ever pointed out, to my knowledge, is that this is roughly a week after Wrath of Khan.  Why weren't they talking about dismantling the Enterprise in the last film?  And why did they send Enterprise on a training cruise if they were planning on dismantling the ship anyway?  Maybe they had been thinking about dismantling Enterprise for a while, and in light of the damage inflicted on the ship, they thought it would be too much trouble for them to repair the ship.  Okay, fine, but it seems like a plot hole.  As Kirk and his crew are mourning the death of Spock, Sarek, Spock's father arrives.  He is angry at Kirk.  He assumes Spock mind-melded with Kirk just before his death.  It turns out that Vulcans can live on even after their body has been destroyed.  They just have to transfer their brain to someone else's body.  Then they have to have someone transfer their mind back to their own body, on Vulcan.  It turns out that instead of Kirk, Spock actually melded with McCoy.  So why didn't Spock explain that to Kirk right before he died?  And why didn't McCoy start acting like Spock right away?  That would have saved everyone a lot of time and energy.  On the plus side though, it was pretty entertaining to see McCoy acting and talking like Spock.

Kirk realizes he has to go back to Genesis and pick up Spock's body, then bring him back to Vulcan for the ritual.  If he doesn't, any chance of saving Spock will be lost and McCoy will go insane.  He asks the Starfleet commander for permission to return to Genesis.  Starfleet refuses his request, saying that Spock coming back makes no sense, and that Genesis is under quarantine.  Kirk disobeys his orders and he and the rest of the crew steal the Enteprise.  The scene where they fly the ship out of the Starfleet hangar is probably my favorite scene in all of Star Trek.  And the captain of Excelsior, the pursuing ship, is such an arrogant jerk that it makes you want them to escape even more.  They leave earth and head for Genesis.

They get there, only to find the ship David and Saavik and David were on has been destroyed by the Klingons.  A Klingon bird of prey, captained by Doc Brown, wants Genesis.  A short fight ensues between the two ships.  Enterprise is crippled, and they lose power.  Doc Brown has captured David and Saavik, along with a reborn Spock.  However, Spock is now a young boy.  He was regenerated by the planet, but brought back as a young boy.  It also turns out that the planet is dying.  David engineered it using proto-matter, an unstable element...or something.  Spock is rapidly aging along with the planet.  He is in a tremendous amount of pain.  As a sign that he is serious, Doc Brown has David killed.  Kirk pretends to surrenderr, and then he and his crew beam down to the planet just as most of the Klingon crew is beaming aboard Enterprise.  Kirk has set the Enterprise to self-destruct, and in what is a great scene, the bulk of the Klingon crew are killed.  Down on the planet, Kirk and crew kill the remaining Klingons and rescue Saavik and Spock.  Kirk tricks Doc Brown into beaming down to Genesis.  The two argue, Doc Brown demanding that Kirk tell him the secret of Genesis, and Kirk calling him an idiot, pointing out that the Genesis experiment is a failure.  All the people who try to explain this to Doc kind of miss the point.  Doc isn't interested in creating a planet from lifelessness.  He wants Genesis for it's destructive power, like Khan did in the previous film.  Having the planet destroy itself after Genesis changes it does not really matter to Doc.  He wants Genesis as a weapon, nothing else.  And whether Genesis can sustain life is irrelevent, as far as he's concerned.

I have to say, Kruge is a pretty scary villian.  He would have been better if he had been played by someone else.  I'm not saying Christopher Lloys is a bad actor, he just wasn't the right actor to play this role.  He's better at playing comical roles than evil villianous roles.  So in a throwback to the old TV show, Kirk and Doc have a fight.  Doc falls off a cliff to his death.  Kirk tricks the remaining Klingon into beaming him up to the Klingon ship.  Man, these Klingons are dumb.  They leave for Vulcan just as the planet explodes.  They perform the ceremony, and Spock and Bones are both saved.  It will take some time for Spock to completely heal, but he is at least on the path to recovery.

As I said before, I like this movie.  I do not by into the odd-numbered Star Trek rule when it comes to this film.  I don't think this is as good as most of the even-numbered movies, but I think it's pretty good and under-rated.  I think too many people wanted it to be as good as Wrath of Khan, and in just about every way, it is just not as good.  But I still like it.",1261267200,,6985,4.392494136043784
228211,4,6300213501,"Right away, I will say that out of 5 stars, I expected a 4 star movie, and I got a 4 star movie.

Unfortunately, it suffers from being between two epics: An epic of comedy (The Voyage Home) and an epic of tragedy (Wrath of Khan)

I pointed out in my (NEW) Wrath of Khan review that Wrath of Khan was about Kirk, and the ""maturation"" he suffers by Spock's death.  Spock's death shows to Kirk for the first time that he is not invincible, and he has cheated death for so long, that the inevitable came, and did what Khan intended to do: hurt him and make him go on hurting: taking his closest friend from him.

Unfortunately, you can't really continue the same Star Trek journeys without Spock.  A brilliant writer/director likely could, but it would have to be a genuinely BRILLIANT writer/director, and even then some fans would still whine and complain about Spock.

So they have to bring him back.

To their credit, they did a very good job of bringing Spock back without making it seem like a cheap ""I got better"" asspull excuse to bring him back to life.  The Genesis Planet brings Spock's body back to life, but without his mind, it is a nonsentient animal, confused and in pain, as it rapidly ages with the planet.  Teen! Spock has sex with Saavik to sate his Pon Farr, and the Klingons finally return to try to steal the Genesis Project secrets from Kirk.

Christopher Lloyd is magnificent as a Klingon.  And in terms of effectiveness, I have to say he's in some way better than Khan.  While Khan eventually caused Kirk to suffer the death of Spock, it was only after Khan had died, and indirect.  Christopher Lloyd's Klingon is cold, calculating, cunning, and brutal.  Such things he does and memorable lines include killing his gunner for accidentally destroying a Federation science vessel when he wanted it disabled because he wanted prisoners, or when he has Saavik and David prisoner on the Genesis Planet, he orders one of them killed, and says ""I don't care which one"".

In fact, the Klingon seems to directly affect and hurt Kirk more than Khan did, at least in the short-term.  While Khan swerved and screwed Kirk several times, Kirk was always smugly in control of the situation and was a step ahead of Khan.

This is the first time in the film that a villain gives pause to Kirk, and seriously hurts him while being alive to do so.  First, David is killed while struggling with a Klingon.  This news hits Kirk so hard, he falls to the ground in shock and anguish.

And then of course, the Klingons' attempts to take the Enterprise force him to have it self-destruct.  Another hurt on him.

But ultimately, because dollars and status quo and a great character's continuing adventures demand it, Spock must return.  Spock's ""Remember"" mind-meld with McCoy becomes central in this film, as they take Spock's body just as it conveniently ages to Nimoy's current age, and bring it to Vulcan, to ""extract"" his ""Katra"" or soul or whatever from McCoy and return it to Spock.  The ending is very touchingly heartwarming.

But ultimately, because bluh bluh dee bluh mentioned above, Spock must return.  And while the movie is decent enough, it loses some points for its severe mood whiplash from the previous film, and the seeming long-term ""lesson"" and its effects---that being Kirk is not infallible or invincible---being ended, as even though Kirk hurt with the loss of his friend, he got better, and got Spock back eventually anyway.",1257552000,,3446,4.663907284768212

228213,4,6300213501,"Quickly following the events of ""Star Trek II:  The Wrath Of Khan,"" ""Star Trek III:  The Search For Spock"" takes the filmgoer on a highly unusual ""rescue"" mission.  This go-round finds Kirk, McCoy, and the rest of the crew (minus Spock, who sacrificed himself to save the others) returning to the friendly confines of the Federation for rest and, unbeknownst to them, the decommissioning of their beloved Enterprise.

Meanwhile, the Federation starship Grissom is studying the newly alive Genesis planet and discovers a lifeform on its surface.  Kirk's son, David (Merritt Butrick) and Lt. Saavik (Robin Curtis) journey down to the planet's surface to investigate.  What they find is a young Vulcan boy who is rapidly growing.  They also find that the Genesis project isn't quite as successful as they believed.  The planet is quickly deteriorating and will soon destroy itself.

Having acquired information about the Genesis project and planning to use the Genesis device as a powerful weapon, Klingon commander Kruge (Christopher Lloyd) sets a course for Genesis.  Couple this with a visit to Kirk from Spock's father, Sarek (Mark Lenard), who reveals to Kirk that Spock's ""katra"" was placed inside one of the surviving Enterprise crewmembers and must be retrieved along with Spock's body in order to properly put him to rest back on Vulcan, and you have the stage set for an exciting space opera.

In order to make it back to Genesis, Kirk and company steal the Enterprise.  It's a bold maneuver that Kirk knows will be costly, but he is determined to help his old friend.  When the Enterprise arrives at Genesis, they find the Grissom destroyed and face-off against Kruge, who has Saavik, David, and the Vulcan boy held hostage on the planet's surface.  Kirk realizes that the boy is Spock, and now he must try to save his son and his best friend.

From this point, the film turns into an especially emotional struggle for Kirk.  Kruge gains the upperhand on the Enterprise almost immediately, and uses his hostages as pawns in a game of wits with Kirk.

Who survives the outcome?  You might be a bit surprised if you haven't yet watched this third installment of the Star Trek film franchise.

While Khan was a powerful foe in ""Star Trek II"" (and quite possibly the greatest villain in all of Trekdom), I have to admit that Christopher Lloyd does an excellent job as Kruge.  He forces Kirk's hand in ways that will shock the viewer.  While it's quite hard today to see Lloyd as anybody but Doc Brown from ""Back to the Future,"" his portrayal of Kruge is good enough that the ""flux capacitor"" takes a backseat while the renegade Klingon is on the screen.

William Shatner delivers one of his best performances as Admiral Kirk.  Kirk goes on an emotional rollercoaster ride in this installment, but manages to keep his composure under immense pressure.

Nichelle Nichols (Uhura) is relegated to a small supporting role, but she does have one very hilarious moment that was a highlight of the film.  Walter Koenig (Chekov), James Doohan (Scotty) and George Takei (Sulu) have somewhat larger roles, but their characters aren't challenged as much as Kirk or even McCoy.  McCoy, by the way, shines each and every time he's on the screen in this film.  DeForest Kelley is brilliant this time around, being both humorous and caring at the same time.  Robin Curtis does a solid job as Saavik, as does Merritt Butrick as Kirk's son.

While it's been stated that the odd numbered Trek films have always been the worst ones, I have to say that ""The Search For Spock"" stands above the pack for two reasons:  1)  It is one of the most emotionally tugging films in the entire series and 2)  It manages to be a solid stand alone film despite acting as a bridge to the fourth film, ""The Voyage Home.""

Nimoy does a solid job as a director, holding together a plot that could have easily fallen apart due to its somewhat outlandish setting.  The film's score, provided by James Horner, is wonderful.

The special effects are sketchy at times, but they get it right at key moments in the film, especially in the space battles.

The fight sequences aren't up to par with other hand-to-hand combat scenes in other films from the franchise, but I have to admit that Sulu does have one of the best fight scenes in all of the Trek films in ""The Search for Spock.""

This particualr DVD offers numerous extras.  Highlights include commentary from Nimoy and an interesting (if rather dryly delivered) explanation of the development of the Klingon language for the film (and the future of the franchise).  Oh, and there's an interesting Easter Egg for those Trekkers willing to hunt for it.

With exceptional highs, powerful emotion, and just a few miscues, ""Star Trek III:  The Search for Spock"" is a fine addition to the Trek universe.

The villain, Klingon Commander Kruge, is played by Christopher Lloyd.  With a villain played by Lloyd, you can't go wrong.  In my opinion, Christopher Lloyd played the best Klingon.  No other actor comes close to surpassing Lloyd's portrayal of a Klingon.

The Genesis Device plot saved Star Trek.  In this movie, the Genesis Device was the perfect way to bring Spock from the dead.  The writers were very lucky to have it turn out this way.  As a result, the resurrection of Spock is very believable.  To steal a quote from Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, ""Genesis was perfectly named-- the creation of life, not death"".

This movie works because it shows how much the crew risked to save Spock.  They disobeyed Starfleet by stealing the Enterprise and returning to the Genesis planet.  The movie clearly shows that the needs of the one outweigh the needs of the many.",1242259200,,1014,4.661016949152542

But just like the first Star Trek movie brought back a series that many looked on fondly, but without expectations, this movie brings back a character that was sacrificed in one of the most heart tugging scenes in all 500+ hours of Star Trek. Unfortunately, this time out has a few pacing problems.

This is Nimoy's motion picture directorial debut, and he performs solidly enough, though there are a few moments here and there where it simply feels like there's something ... missing. It's hard to describe.

That's not to say it isn't worth a watch. If you plan on seeing Star Treks II and IV, this is a must see. But there are also some scenes that are just superbly done. The scene breaking McCoy out of the security cell has classic Trek charm. And the scene where the Klingons kill one of the hostages and Kirk reacts is absolutely excellent. He stumbles and completely misses his chair. We see the captain -- this man we have seen beat astronomical odds with a bluff, who has faced the destruction of Earth or the forceful invasion from another galaxy without even a twitch in his jaw -- we see this great captain completely exposed and despondent.

Unfortunately the fight scenes are very rushed and important deaths are just glossed over with little or no attentioned paid to them.  Christopher Lloyd as the villain is serviceable but his motives are not always clear throughout the film.

228249,4,6300213501,"Back in the 80's Star Trek really hit its stride having finally made it to the silver screen. The first film was a dark, dreary disappointment but the producers stuck with it and created a major hit with the second film, The Wrath of Khan. The next two films including the Search for Spock and The Voyage Home basically created a trilogy that in my opinion represents the apex of the entire Star Trek franchise. By adding humor into the mix and focusing on the interaction between the main characters particularly Kirk, Spock and McCoy the producers created a winning combination that will likely never be repeated. This formula worked extremely well peaking with The Voyage Home before collapsing in a smoldering heap with the moronic row row row your boat scene in The Final Frontier.

The Search for Spock is the weakest entry in the trilogy but that doesn't mean it's weak. This was the first of two entries directed by Leonard Nimoy and they turned out to be two of the best of all the Star Trek films. Search for Spock has a more intimate feel to it with most of the action revolving around the conflict between Kirk and the Klingon Kruge. Nimoy's focus on more lighthearted action and the playful interaction of characters makes the film a real joy and contrasts well with the films darker second half.

William Shatner is often mocked for his acting ability and this film really pushes him to the limit, in particular his reaction after the death of his son David. Shatner may be a ham but he's the kind of ham I love and to me he will always be the true Captain of the Enterprise. I also have to give special credit to Christopher Lloyd who was absolutely fantastic as Kruge. One unfortunate change was the replacement of Kirstie Alley with the forgettable Robin Curtis as Lt. Saavik.

This film is clearly created for the fans, as it should be. If you haven't watched the old episodes or The Wrath of Khan you're unlikely to get much out of this film because it's filled with in-jokes and references to the prior film. The special effects are rather dated. In particular the starships have thick black lines around them that spoil the natural effect and the scenes on Genesis scream movies set. It's a movie with fantastic moments including the classic self destruction of the Enterprise and some lengthy stretches of slowness in particular the finale on Vulcan. I have a lot of fond memories of these three films and despite some flaws recommend them all wholeheartedly.",1210636800,,2481,4.659817351598173
228250,5,6300213501,"After the death of Spock (Leonard Nimoy) and his corpse is sent to Genesis where his coffin is to remain. Kirk (William Shatner) feels depressed about the lost of his best friend and the crew has repaired the enterprise after the battle with Khan. McCoy (DeForrest Kelly) has been acting strange lately as he channels both Spock's behavior and voice. Spock's father Sarek (Mark Lenard) pays a visit as he knows that McCoy has Spock's soul and learns that Spock is alive on planet Genesis as they must go on that planet to find him. Kirk with his crew (James Doohan, George Takei, Walter Koenig, Nichelle Nichols) and his son Dr. David Marcus (Merritt Butrick) and Lt. Saavik (Robin Curtis) hop aboard the enterprise so they can find Spock on Genesis, but the Klingons with a leader named Kruge (Christopher Lloyd) have learned the secrets of Genesis as they want to steal it.

Energetic and smart third installment of the popular cinematic Sci-fi franchise delivers some goods. Leonard Nimoy himself directed this motion picture as this is part a loose three part trilogy that started with part 2 and ended with part 4, sure it doesn't have the awe or greatness of ""Wraith of Khan"" but this is still an enjoyable and entertaining installment with good special effects and good acting. The storyline itself is complicated but good, this movie does have the rebirth of Spock after his demise in ""Wraith of Khan"" and it's still worth watching for fans.

228251,4,6300213501,"WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE
4 STARS - THE REAL FIRST TOS EPISODE, AND ITS A GOOD ONE

The ""Cage"" was the very original TOS episode, that never made it on tv (though it was released eventually to home video as ""The Cage"" and also integrated into the 2-parter ""The Menagerie"" which comes along a little later in this first season). The Cage episode featured a cast and crew that was rejected, except for Leonard Nimoy as Mr. Spock.  Star Trek eventually was granted the opportunity to try again, and made it to the network, though it's first aired episode was ""The Man Trap"".  Unfortunately many of the episodes aired out of order, but upon home releases (such as this 2 episode set) are the first two episodes in proper order.  Some obvious elements in Where No Man Has Gone Before give it away that this is an earlier episode than The Man Trap.  One, the uniforms are much simpler, and have yet to evolve to all those colors.  Two, no Dr. McCoy yet onboard.  The episode succeeds, and quite well, actually coming off as one of the stronger episodes I have seen in the entire 3 season run.

Gary Mitchell is the highlight in this episode, and the only episode you will see him in.  His character was rather likeable (even before his villainous transformation) and I could actually see him fitting in as a member of the crew on a regular basis.  We discover this helm office has been close friends with Captain Kirk for the past 15 years.  As the Enterprise answers to a distress call from within some kind of space forcefield, an electrical charge attacks two crewmen - one Dr. Dana, and the other, Gary Mitchell.  Rather quickly, this shock transforms Mitchell into a god-like entity, craving power by the minute as he continually strenghens mentally and physically.  Kirk is forced to wrestle with his feelings and kill his best friend, before he kills the crew.

Considering this is the first episode of TOS, it is very well made (just try comparing it to most season 3 episodes!).  Gary Mitchell is likeable, both as a regular crewman and as the villain.  Kirk is already forced to deal with a difficult issue.  Even some of the effects (though very cheesy today) were quite astounding for a television series in its time.  A definte must own for any Trekkie out there.

THE CORBOMITE MANEUVER
4 STARS - [3.5] LOOKS CAN BE DECEIVING

The Corbomite Maneuver is a perfect example of an extremely cheesy episode for today's viewing pleasure versus the effectiveness of its original release date.  It is a fairly simple story that actually holds out well.  Perhaps you may recall an alien figure with a rather tall, stretched face who almost always appeared as one of the clips shown during the end credits of every Star Trek episode.  This is the episode that features that alien.  Almost laughable today, when this episode originally aired the alien figure made a frightening impact.  I remember the first time I saw this episode as a kid, the image remained in my head for years.  The irony of the episode is that the intelligence behind the force holding the Enterprise at bay throughout the episode is not the menacing alien, but ""Balok"" played by Clint Howard.

About 85% of this episode takes place on the bridge, making it appear a very slow watch.  The mystery behind the oposing force is the interest here.  The massive size of the alien vessel and snippets of the alien figure on the viewscreen make the situation more frightening.  But Kirk pulls a rabbit out of his hat, or actually in this case, plays a game of poker to defeat the present scenario.  Kirk, McCoy and crewman Baine beam over to the alien vessel, discovering the surprsing truth of it all.

This is definetly a classic episode of the series that fans will easily reconize, while non-fans may not discover much from it.  The moral of the story...looks can be deceiving and sometimes its good to go against the odds.

While it may never be popular or even politically correct to criticise government, Star Trek has an impressive history of taking events from our day and put them in  futuristic settings to  make social commentaries that are far more perceptive than what one will find on the six o'clock news. This is is no exception.  The question this episode begs to be answered is how far should a supposedly advanced nation become involved with a so-called lesser culture. Watch ""A Private Little War"" and see what happens.

It does have the semi-dubious distinction of being the only Trek movie to have me laughing out loud.  Yes, the characters and storyline are very believable, but how can you not laugh at some of the lines coming out of McCoy's mouth.  The behind the scenes footage is awesome as well.  I've always been a Trekkie, but I am just now starting my movie collection.  Thinking I'm gonna stop after the first 6 though.  I've seen the others, but they aren't as ""Star Trek"" as these. Maybe it's because I'm not as big a fan of Next Generation.  And I think to an extent the powers that be got a little greedy.  They figured trekkies would flock to anything saying Star Trek.  I just don't think the later movies are as well written as the earlier ones.  But that is just my humble opinion.  I know I should be sticking to the movie at hand, but you can't help but bring in the others when discussing Star Trek.

I'm sorry she was very bad and it is painful to look at her act when she is on the screen. Now on the other hand Christoper Lloyd is the best Klingon I have ever seen and plays the role very very well.  This film is in no way near the best of the Star Trek films but it is a decent one and worth watching and having in your collection.  There are some very memorible moments in this film like Uhura dealing with the young ensign in the transporter room, and Kirk's fight with the Klingon.

228274,4,6300213501,"The third Star Trek film basically continues where the second left off.  Spock is dead.  The Genesis planet is already under study by Kirk's son David and Lt. Saavik, who are studying from the science vessel USS Grissom.  The Enterprise, is an empty house.  The children (young cadets) are all gone, and the absence of Spock left an open wound.  The events from the Wrath of Khan continue in this film, yet there is enough newness brought into the mix as well.  Overall, this Star Trek film is easily overlooked, but is one of the finer installments of the franchise.

The story is about finding Spock, which is no easy task.  As a Vulcan, we learn that his katra (his very soul) has been exchanged into Dr. McCoy's, and remains alive in him.  Spock's body has been found on the Genesis planet, in the form of a kid.  Apparently, the Genesis effects gave Spock's dead body a new life, yet aging quickly with the planet around him.  The goal, is for Kirk and crew to recover Spock and bring him to Vulcan, where he can finally regain the life he once had.  To do so, is the real excitement of the film.  The Enterprise is being decomissioned in spacedock.  Kirk's only means of getting to Genesis is stealing the ship, with the help McCoy, Scotty, Sulu and Chekov.  They break almost every law in the book to do so.  And to make matters worse, they are confronted by Klingons who want the Genesis secrets for themselves.

Though this film did not receive as strong as an impact as The Wrath of Khan, this is a solid follow-up.  The story remains ineresting and complex.  The action is a little weaker this time, yet still lots of fun.  The Klingons and the Enterprise engage in battle, and Kirk sacrifices the ship in a self-destructed explosion of effects that look great today.  The Klingon villain - Kruge - played by Christopher Lloyd is memorable.  And the scene where Kirk and crew steal the Enterprise is great suspense.

If you are not a Trek fan yet interested in this film, i suggest you at least watch The Wrath of Khan first.  Although it is not necessaryto enjoy this film, it will explain why Spock is dead and how he ended up on the Genesis planet, even though there is a small scene of those events shown at the beginning of this film.  This is a great Star Trek film that should not be overlooked.

228275,5,6300213501,"Contrary to the ""odd"" opinion of odd numbered ST movies falling short. STIII in my opinion hardly does, in fact it reaches heights not seen in most of the ST movies following. ST1 doesn't do too bad either. The story focuses on Kirk and how he does all to at first search and save some aspect of his friend, Spock. We get to see aspects of Kirk's career, a new starship which may make the Enterprise's family way of life obsolete. We first see the first take of the barbarous facets on the Klignons who continue to bark and growl incessantly through the TNG and the other ST series and movies. STIII really wasn't meant to be the middle part of the trilogy. Younger fans did not live through the times when the movies came out with each movie rumored to be last. This was still when any Star Trek movie coming out was a phenomenon. Only because of Star Wars and Lucas boasting of 9 ""episodes"" did Paramount had to compete with 20th Fox sequel sci-fi. The scenes are portrayed poetically and while Nimoy was a first time director he was an amateur photographer even before the original series (see autobiography ""I am not Spock"" circa 1967) and you could tell his visions come through in some breathtaking vistas especially the return to Vulcan. Arriving at spacedock with James Horner's great variation score of ST:II is one the best ST scenes seen in any Star Trek. Spacedock was probably reconfigured from the Mother ship in ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" by the special effects company ILM. Great adventure, stunning pathos, even more bittersweet goodbyes are experienced before the ending which does not let down unlike many other sci-fi movies. Even a reference at the very end harkening back to the ending words of ST 1. STIII tooks risks , made changes, and had no reset button which was expected of the tv trailer's words ""The LAST voyage of the Starship Enterprise"".",1193616000,4,1881,4.651651651651652
228276,5,6300213501,"The first half dozen times I watched this episode (as a kid) I took it as pro-Vietnam-war propaganda. Later I watched it and realized that it's a CRITIQUE of the Vietnam War. The ending is a little ambiguous, but I really believe that Kirk changes his mind about the rightness of a ""Vietnamization"" policy at the very last moment.

There are things to quibble about -- such as the crappy California landscape used to portray ""Eden"" and the incredibly cheap wigs thrown on the planet denizens -- but a couple of things are outstanding. First, Kirk and McCoy argue over what is essentially a Federation ""Vietnam"" policy, made obvious by Kirk's reference to ""twentieth-century brush wars in Asia."" The great thing about this scene is that both Kirk and McCoy give their side the best possible argument. McCoy retorts, ""Yes, I remember. They went on for year after bloody year!""

We are given reasons to mistrust Kirk. As McCoy points out, Kirk is under the influence of a local witch (Nancy Kovack) who is greedy, seductive, and selfish and trying to get him to provide her people with guns. But Kirk stands his ground. ""Say you're right, that I am under her influence. What would YOU do, Doctor?"" You see, the Klingons are arming one side in this fight and Kirk feels the need to back the anti-Klingon proxies. It's the hill people vs. the village people. It could've been the river people vs. the mountain people. Whatever. These primitive folks are just pawns in the Federation-Klingon Cold War.

Another outstanding moment is Shatner's acting of that final line. It is a difficult scene -- the entire episode depends on it -- and Shatner delivers the episode's ambiguous, but ultimately anti-war statement. Flintlocks? ""Serpents, Mr. Scott, serpents for the Garden of Eden. Just beam us up."" For all its flaws, this episode communicates a deeply heartfelt message that our Cold War involvements in the 20th century were depressing, tragic, and frought with moral perils. Peace was the way, but sometimes there were no easy answers. Maybe, despite the costs, it is better to just ""beam up"" and get out. None of this should be lost on people today as they think about how to get out of Iraq -- site of the original Garden of Eden.

In watching this episode, remember that in 1967 the debate over the Vietnam War was just heating up and there were still many millions of people who insisted we needed to be there. This helps explain the ambiguous tone that Roddenberry gives the episode. But the fact that Kirk is seduced by the witch gives you a clue as to Roddenberry's real leanings.",1188172800,,2584,4.748329621380846
228277,4,6300213501,"At its worst, this episode is a parody of every bad Star Trek ever made. Kirk, Uhura, Chekov are spirited away to a planet run by aliens who enslave humanoids and make them engage in gladatorial combat. It's a bad situation except that Kirk gets to seduce his super-cute drill instructor (Anjelique Pettyjohn). She wears a silver bikini and has greenish-blonde hair. As much as any other episode, this one enhances Kirks reputation for seducing ""alien babe forms.""

Acting logically, Spock tracks down Kirk and company. The science isn't great... there's some nonsense about an ""ion trail""... but Spock pursuing his course of action in absence of alternatives shows his persistence and cool-headedness. Naturally, McCoy tells him he's a green-blooded fool the whole time.

But wait. It gets better. Having Uhura participate in an episode about slavery, though perhaps rather obvious, hits some emotional buttons. Another slave is brought out for punishment and Uhura is supposed to use him for target practice. The slave is a very African-looking black man. Uhura refuses, and Kirk tries to help her, ultimately taking the punishment himself. This was surely a powerful statement in the 1960's.

The best scene is when Kirk finally confronts the super-advanced aliens in charge. Actually they are a trio of talking brains who sit around below the planet surface. In some ways it's silly: the brains are colored red, green, and yellow, matching the collars on the slaves they own. But when Kirk turns the tables by making them a wager they can't refuse, it's good psychology. You see, these brains have developed to the point they no longer need bodies, and they are so bored that they have nothing to do all day but wager on humanoid fights -- much like the humans who bet on dog fights today.

The ""Kirk in love"" stuff is better than usual. Quite smooth is the scene in which he tells Ms. Pettyjohn she's beautiful and she asks ""What is 'beautiful'?"" He holds a reflecting pan to her face and says ""THAT is beautiful."" Slick move, Kirk. The acting and writing of that moment are actually rather nice.",1187827200,,2101,4.893258426966292

A mediocre 3rd season had me praying for someone to put this puppy out of its misery but at least we get two episodes, the second of which even more so, that are worthy of inclusion among the very best episodes across all 3 seasons here.

The first episode is a little silly at times but the huge redeeming factor for me is the introduction and explanation of very key characters that are pivotal to future Trek series like DS9 e.g. Kahless and the Founding Father of the Vulcans.  Also, the moral that the pursuit of science and knowledge are noble and worthy causes in and of themselves but not at the cost of misery and suffering to innocent others I found to be very relevant even today.

The second episode is one of my all-time favourites and I even liked it better than ""City On...Forever.""  Just as in that episode, there are a number of inconsistencies and strange events here like how can a completely different planet have a similar history as ours with musketeers to boot!  Ignoring this though, the side-story with Spock and McCoy is simply brilliant.  Nimoy does a very good acting job here as he shows emotions of jealousy and anger and then reverts to his usual self at the end.  A very good time-travel episode and very easily the best episode of the final season.

If you are deciding which volumes to keep, this one falls under the ""Must Have"" category.

228312,4,6300213501,"In a mostly terrible 3rd season of stops and starts but of mostly the former, it's refreshing to get a mini-revival for at least two episodes before the very end.  A combination of low budgeting and poor ratings due to a poor time slot gave the production team very little to work with and it shows here in this volume especially in the first episode with ""The Lights of Zetar"".  The ""possession"" scenes with the lights over the faces of both the first female victim and Lt. Romaine represent special effects scenes so poor that they were almost humorous instead of the horror which was the intended effect.  Still, this average episode ranks among the better ones of the 3rd season.

In the second episode ""The Cloud Minders"", we get one of the best episodes of all Classic Trekdom.  We get a very good overall episode which is a fable and satire about discrimination.  The scriptwriting on this volume has improved dramatically from previous volumes and the acting as well making this episode to be overall a worthy addition to Classic Trekdom lore.

If you are looking for one of the better volumes of Season 3, this one falls under the ""must have"" category.

228313,2,6300213501,"As the 3rd and final season quickly comes to an end, I'm left unsurprised that Classic Trek got axed at this season's end.  After a long string of poor and uninspiring episodes (where had all the great scriptwriters gone after the first two seasons?) this volume is just the next installment of forgettable drivel.  The first episode is just very, very poor with terrible scriptwriting and Spock is inexplicably made out to be some obnoxious old maid with pms.  The overall dialogue is very poor and the story is just plain stupid.  Why wouldn't a force strong enough to send the Enterprise 1000 light years away just simply destroy the Enterprise right away instead of playing games with the crew is unexplained.  Why would the computer have to make replicas of Lee Meriwether specifically for individual crew members without being able to kill at will is another ridiculous failing of the plot.  I can safely say that this episode ""That Which Survives"" is one of the worst 3 episodes in the entire classic trekdom.

The second episode is an interesting fable about racial discrimination and intolerance which pricks the conscience and successfully achieves its intention of provoking discomfort among its viewers to look at themselves to see if they are guilty of similar actions themselves.  The script is quite good and the acting is good as well and not as bad as the other reviewers have made it out to be.  This episode ranks among the better ones of season 3 as well.

Overall, we have one horribly bad and one average episode putting this volume under the ""give it a miss"" category if you are deciding which volumes to collect.",1171843200,,1636,4.790035587188612
228314,4,6300213501,"Star Trek III - The Search for Spock Is not one of my favorite Star Trek feature films, but it is worth the buy in my opinion for the Special Features alone.  It must be said that most Star Trek fans already own this DVD.  Someone who is not a Star Trek fan or has never seen Star Trek II - The Wrath of Kahn would be lost, then again; these films are so deeply engrained into our culture that if you did get lost by this film you must have been living under a rock for many years! lol!",1171584000,3,486,3.85
228315,4,6300213501,"Which doesn't really say very much given the ""quality"" of the majority of the episodes of this season.  Still, in the first episode which closely resembles the ""Squire of Gothos"" from Season 1, we get ""superior"" beings who become intoxicated with their powerful telekinetic powers and become living proof of George Orwell's famous pronouncement in ""Animal Farm"": ""Power corrupts but absolute power corrupts absolutely.""  It what can be described a painful episode in more ways than one to watch, we get to see Spock and Kirk made to look extremely foolish and humiliated almost beyond bearing but then managed to turn the tables around and to have the self-restraint to not take revenge when the opportunity arises.  All in all, this is an above average episode and is certainly one of the better ones of season 3.

In the second episode, we get another example of a powerful race rationalising that superior power makes it alright to impose your designs on the less superior.  Here, in order to perpetuate the species at all costs, the Scalosians decide that it's okay to kidnap, use and discard the unsuspecting for their greater ""good"".  Like the first episode in this volume, while not great this episode still ranks among the better ones of the season.

Overall we get two episodes which highlight how power can easily corrupt and can even be ""rationalised"" as a perfectly good reason to abuse, exploit and manipulate the less powerful.

Two of the more interesting episodes make this volume come under the ""nice to have but not essential"" category if you picking which volumes to collect and keep.",1171065600,,1603,4.911111111111111
228316,4,6300213501,"In 'The Ultimate Computer' mathematics genius Dr Daystrom (William Marshall) installs a new supercomputer, the M-5, aboard the Enterprise. It can run a starship better than humans, and it's to be tested in war games against four other federation ships. Daystrom is such a genius even Spock can only be of small help to him. McCoy says to Spock, ""This is what you'd like isn't it Spock?"", ""you'd prefer a ship run by computer"". Spock replies, ""I don't find it preferable"" in understatement. In fact, watching this episode for the fifth or so time . .  Spock and Kirk both have a deep conversation on the bridge about neither wanting to be replaced by machines. It isn't long after this the M-5 begins to malfunction. During the entire rest of the episode, there is no real evidence suggesting M-5 is purposefully malfunctioning but it is perhaps something to note.

When the war games begin, not only does the Enterprise react faster than the other ships, but the M-5 has shields and weapons set to maximum. The M-5 has malfunctioned. It's taken complete control of the Enterprise and doesn't see this as a game. The enterprise destroys one starship and heavily damages one or two of the others.

Dr Daystrom, - ""lecturing to fools, who don't even begin to understand my systems; lessor minds and competitors, building, on my work"" - a mad genius it turns out, whose own 'brain engrams' have been used in the creation of the computer, tries to talk the M-5 into disconnecting itself. The talk almost sounds as if it is a man in conversation with his child or even with himself, ""this unit must survive"", M-5 insists.

Kirk asks M-5 to scan the starship Excelsior and Hood. The M-5 reports there are no life-signs aboard. 'You have murdered', Kirk proclaims, and both the M-5 and Dr Daystrom have a mini-breakdown giving the crew a chance to disconnect the faulty computer.",1170720000,,1871,4.747692307692308
228317,5,6300213501,"In my review of ""The Wrath Of Kahn"", I commented that it seemed like a movie, while ""Star Trek:  The Motion Picture"" seemed like an overlong episode.  This movie also came across to me as an overlong episode, but in this case, it was a long version of one of the better episodes.

I won't give away much of the story, except to say that this was a continuation of the story started in ""Wrath Of Kahn"".  Robin Curtis took over from Kirstie Alley as Savic, and I actually liked Curtis better.  I think she's cuter as well, but I don't think you're reading a review to see who I think is cute.  Also featured is a return of Merrit Buttrick as David, Captain Kirk's son, as well as sitcom actors Christopher Lloyd (Taxi) and John Laroquette (Night Court) as Klingons (though Lloyd was much more menacing then funny).",1169164800,,812,4.416107382550336
228318,3,6300213501,"If you are deciding which volumes to keep, this one only just falls under the ""nice to have but dispensable"" category which is a pity because the first episode, ""The Ultimate Computer"" is actually one of the best episodes from the second season and comes after a string of mediocre episodes.  We get a very interesting premise: ""Will computers/technology ever make humans redundant?  This similar premise has been visited many times over since in movies like ""Terminator"", ""The Matrix"" and ""I, Robot"" and will probably still strike a chord with viewers many years into the future as well.  The acting is very good and coupled with one of the better scripts ever written for Trek make this a very memorable episode indeed.

Now for the downside: ""The Omega Glory"" is a ridiculous episode which unlike the very similar episodes ""Piece of the Action"" and ""Patterns of Force"" in which the virtually identical parallels with Earth history were explained by Prime Directive violations, we are expected to believe that inexplicably, some planet light years away developed the Declaration of Independence word-for-word and have exactly the same flag as the U.S.  The two warring factions are also called the Yanks and the Communists!  The ridiculous plot and average acting makes this among the 3 worst ever episodes in the entire Trekdom.

I see that Amazon is now offering downloads of individual episodes for about $2 each.  It's probably a good way to get around this conundrum and perhaps order the one episode and forget the other one as quickly as possible!",1166227200,,1556,4.980694980694981
228319,3,6300213501,"If you are choosing which volumes to keep, this one falls under the ""nice to have but not essential"" category.  In the first episode, we get a comical episode as ""Koirck"" and then Spock attempt to pass themselves off as old-time Chicago-style gangsters with extremely humourous results.  The plot is admittedly far-fetched and full of holes and yet this is what adds to the humour of the episode which is never meant to be taken too seriously.  Overall a slightly above average episode.

The second episode is also humourous although it is a little less so when compared with the first.  Aliens hell-bent on subduing the members of the Enterprise end up having to deal with human style sensations which ultimately results in their undoing.  It is precisely the way the Enterprise crew and especially Spock's role in making the Kelvan commander jealous is what makes this episode really funny.

In conclusion, this volume contains two above average episodes which nevertheless fall far short from the heights achieved on other Season 1 episodes.",1165190400,,1044,5.0
228320,4,6300213501,"While maybe not as good as the Wrath of Khan, this story offers a great conclusion to this two part story. The only let down of this film is that Leonard Nimoy as Spock isn't seen until the very end of the film, which may discourage some fans that they didn't get enough of the Spock they know. But, the story makes up for any loss of the film and the age progression of Spock actually makes the story even more intersting.

This film also marks the debut of Leonard Nimoy directing a Star Trek movie, and he is makes a great director. The most bizarre thing about this movie is that it features Christopher Lloyd as a Klingon. As funny as it may seem and even appear when watching for the first time, he actually made a pretty intersting and convincing Klingon and enemy. There is a lot of drama that takes place in this movie as well as another known character is tragically killed. Overall, another great installment in the Trek movie franchise.",1164240000,5,948,4.417142857142857
228350,1,6300213501,"There are many reasons why I find this particular volume very forgettable and missable; in fact, this volume falls into the ""give this a miss"" category and ranks among the worst ever among all 3 seasons.  In the first episode, we have a ridiculous looking creature that makes me laugh more than shudder in fear reminding me a lot of Paul from the ""Electric Company"" and we also see a racist side to Kirk when he automatically assumes that as the doctor assisting Bones is black and so he is somehow not competent and he needs reassuring from Bones that the black doctor is good at his job and hence good enough to tend to the injured Spock.

The second episode is worse with a very weak storyline and portrays Kirk at his sexist best with the way he manipulates his female jailor.  The storyline is very far-fetched and the only redeeming factor is the humourous exchange on the Enterprise among Bones, Scottie and Spock when the latter suggests the other 2 mount a mutiny.

228352,5,6300213501,"Most intelligent movie critics like the even numbered Star Trek movies (II, IV, VI) because they believe the the odd numbered ones (I, III, V) are inferior. But buying ""The Search for Spock"" is worth the money. Now I am not defending this odd numbered movie because I am a trekkie--I have a real job and do not live with my parents.

This movie is as good as ""Star Trek II: the Wrath of Khan,"" and ""Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home,"" because the plot is really interesting, and the characters are just as well developed as Star Trek II. For example, enter Christopher Lloyd, playing the villian Kirk must face in this adventure. Commanding all ""1.21 gigowatts"" of his bird of prey, Lloyd portrays a merciless Klingon who kills his girlfriend, a starship crew, and a defensless scientist. He is out to get the secret of the Genesis doomsday weapon (it is not the ""flux compasator"").

One can tell how much more money Paramount invested in this sequal to ""Khan."" The special effects are stunning because more ships are featured, and an enormous, mushroom-shaped space station is where the Enterprise docks above Earth. Although Nicholas Meyers (Trek II, IV, VI) did not participate in making this movie, Leonard Nimoy's directing debut is very successful.

What enhances the drama and emotion is the superior music score by James Horner. His ""Khan"" soundrack has lots of catchy theme songs, and he continues with the consistent music of the Genesis adventures in ""The Search for Spock."" Horner is the John Williams of the Star Trek movies (yes, Jerry Goldsmith is probably more award winning, but I believe Horner packs more memorable tunes per movie that he conducts in the Trek saga).

This two disc edition has Nimoy's director's commentary and also a hilarious interview with William Shatner, who sarcastically gloats how he ""saved the day"" when Paramount studios caught fire. Michael Okuda's text commentary is very entertaining for the fans. The second disc interviews the guy who actually perfected the Klingon language. (Can you believe that an actual linguist created this crazy language! Can you believe he translated the Bible into Klingon!)

  It is still the Year 2285. The Enterprise is in deep mourning over the death of Spock (Leonard Nimoy), especially Kirk (William Shatner).  Security has warned Kirk the security seal on Spock's living quarters door has been broken.  As Kirk inspects the darkness, he hears a familiar voice. Admiral Morrow (Robert Hooks) had told Scotty (James Doohan) he will be transferred to another ship.  There will be no re-fitting of the Enterprise.  It is 20 years old.  Meanwhile, Klingon Krudge (Christopher Lloyd) has just seen the videotape of the Genesis project.  Starship USS Grissom which contains David Marcus (Merritt Butrick) and Lt. Saavik (Robin Curtis), have discovered a reading that Spocks's photon tube, his coffin, is registering as a life force.  Admiral Sarek (Mark Lenard) is furious with Kirk for not sending Spock's body back to Vulcan.  However, Sarek decides to mind-meld with Kirk.  They discover that Spock had mind-melded with McCoy before his death.

  As David and Saavik explore Genesis, they find Spock's coffin empty with only his robe.  No body.  After some more exploring, they hear a cry.  It is a  Vulcan child (Carl Steven).  It is Spock!  Spock's living body is accelerated and rejuvenated by the Genesis effect. As the sun sets on Genesis, Spock is now 13 years old (Vadia Potenza).  As Spock goes through puberty, ""pon farr"", the burning of his Vulcan blood, Genesis is also changing rapidly close to its own destruction.  Later that evening, as a storm is brewing, Spock has become 17 (Stephen Manley).
  The Klingons capture Saavik, David and Spock (Joe W. Davis) who is now 25.  He is growing painfully fast.  Saavik gets the opportunity to tell Kirk, via communicator, that Spock is alive.
  Can the Enterprise get to Genesis soon to retrieve Spock, Saavik and David, or will the Klingons and Genesis kill them?

 Quentin Tarantino has presented a story idea with screenwriter Mark L. Smith. He wants the movie to be Rated R. William Shatner, Patrick Stewart and John Cho have shown interest.

228358,4,6300213501,"When the superb sequel ""Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan"" ended with Spock dying and his casket being sent down to the newly made 'Genesis Planet' many fans wondered is this the end for the beloved Vulcan or was the final moment showing the casket on the planet merely a teaser of things to come.  Well, as it turns out it was merely a teaser for things to come, but that wasn't known for a little while after the movie was released which proved to be a brilliant marketing strategy by Paramount, keeping the resurrection of Spock under wraps until the third film was essentially finished and the trailer was released.  So once the trailer was released fans could hardly wait to see the next installment in this blossoming franchise, in hopes that their perished hero would rise from the dead to rejoin Captain Kirk and the rest of the Enterprise crew.  And believe me the wait was definitely worth it, as this latest movie did an excellent job of building on top of what was started in the second film.

""Star Trek 3: The Search for Spock"" begins essentially where its predecessor left off.  The Genesis Planet has been created, Spock is thought to be dead, and the crew of the Enterprise is attempting to limp back to space dock so that the Enterprise can either be repaired or decommissioned.  Before the Enterprise leaves the Genesis Planet they allow David, the estranged son of Admiral Kirk (William Shatner) and the Vulcan Lt. Saavik (Robin Curtis) to remain on the planet to study the new life that has been created.  After reaching space dock the Enterprise receives word from Lt. Saavik that a life form has been found on the planet and it is that of a Vulcan boy, and coincedentally enough, Spock's casket is now empty prompting the crew to wonder has their friend somehow been resurrected by the Genesis effect.  However, getting back to the planet may prove more difficult than Kirk imagined, his close friend Dr. McCoy (DeForest Kelly) appears to be suffering from having Spock's soul transported into him before Spock died, Starfleet is forbidding Kirk to return to the planet, and to make matters even worse the Klingons have discovered the planet and are attempting to plunder it for themselves.  With Dr. McCoy losing his mind and his son and Lt. Saavik and possibly Spock in mortal danger from the Klingons, Kirk and the rest of the crew of the Enterprise must choose whether to defy Starfleet and return to the Genesis Planet or lose their friends and loved ones forever.

""Star Trek 3: The Search for Spock"" as I stated earlier did an excellent job of continuing the story started in ""Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan"", also this movie is the only 'Star Trek' film that doesn't really work as a standalone movie, all of the others are basically self-contained.  The story was full of deeply emotional moments, involving Kirk and his sadness over losing Spock, and his concern over Dr. McCoy.  Though the story was fairly dramatic, the writers still managed to infuse some humor into the proceeding without it seeming to be forced or a cheap ploy to get people's attention.  The acting was all very well done, and this is thanks in no small part to the fact that most of the actors were very familiar with their characters at this point, and the fact that Leonard Nimoy (who played Spock) also directed the film, and showed a great eye for achieving cinematic gold.  This movie does an excellent job of tying off the loose ends left over from ""Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan"" and allowing the movies to branch out further from the TV series and become an entity of their own, which they clearly became with the outstanding ""Star Trek 4: The Voyage Home"" which would also be directed by Leonard Nimoy.

Overall, this film coupled with the previous sequel provides Star Trek fans with so much sci-fi goodness that they can almost completely erase the atrocity that was ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"" from their minds.  ""Star Trek 3: The Search for Spock"" is a very solid entry into this franchise, but be warned you should view ""Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan"" before watching this movie so that you can fully appreciate what's going on in the storyline.

""Star Trek 3: The Search for Spock"" is rated PG for violence and brief language.",1150156800,2,4251,4.631648936170213
228359,4,6300213501,"I never got into Trek films until I was like 15 or 16 yrs old ""although I never really bothered watching the first one of them then lol"". While everyone was worshipping the Wrath of Khan or even Star Trek 4 with some people ""which are both great don't get me wrong"", I always loved the Search for Spock. I mean where else do you have Christopher Lloyd as a ruthless Klingon ? Or Kirk getting in a big one on one fight at the end and kicking some ass ?

  You also have James Horner's awesome musical score. Yes the late great Jerry Goldsmith did some really good Trek scores as well but I always wished Horner would come back and just do one more. I really hope he comes back to do the score for the announced Trek 11....which will really be a prequel about how Kirk and Spock met on....Brokeback Mountain lol ""am kidding about the last part. Anyway Horner's score for me is what made the Wrath of Khan and the Search for Spock seem like the only Trek films that are like space operas. It's one of the most lively Trek scores and the films need him again.

  Anyway the film takes place after Spock's heroic sacrifice in the Wrath of Khan. His casket was launched to a mysterios planet. There the planet has a mysterious effect on his body which has him reborn. Kirk steals the enterprise to go to the planet after weird behavior by Bones. It would seem that Spock left a little of himself with Bones before his death. So Bones is sorta possessed by Spock in a way. So they need to get Bones with the reborn Spock to form some sort of ritual. I know that all sounds silly but to me the whole Spock rebirth isn't even what makes the film good for me. I mean you have Klingons killing Kirk's son and get to hear him say ""you Klingon [...]!, you Klingon [...]!.....you...killed...my...... son! lol. To me that's about as classic as when he yells ""KHAN!!!"" in the Wrath of Khan. This is still one of the funnest and most entertaining Trek films ever.",1145664000,3,1946,4.2888283378746594
228400,5,6300213501,"I agree with those who write that Search for Spock isn't quite the movie that Wrath of Khan was.  This movie just ground to a almost screeching halt at times.  Some of the scenes were hard to watch.  There isn't nearly the ambience of movies like Wrath of Khan, The Motion Picture, or First Contact.

What I like about the film is as follows:

1. Robin Curtis.  I think she's the ultimate Vulcan babe.  I found her Saavik to be much more convincing than Kirstie Alley's.  When I saw this movie in the theater I thought ""Now there's what a Vulcan woman should look like!""  She's never been surpassed in my book.

2. The entire original crew working together to save one of their own.  They each get to do something.  It's not just about Kirk, Spock, and McCoy.

3. Christopher Lloyd.  No matter how ruthless his character is, I still want to laugh.  Maybe not the most convincing Klingon, but very entertaining, to me anyway.

I could go on, but I would likely repeat what others have said about the movie.

But this isn't just about the movie; it's about all the other stuff you get with these two disc sets.  You get commentary tracks and interviews and documentaries.

Wouldn't you like to hear what Leonard Nimoy had to say about Directing the movie?  Would you like to hear and see Robin Curtis talk about her approach to playing Saavik and how she was coached through various scenes by director Nimoy?

There's a lot more going on here than the movie itself.  So maybe it's a three star movie, but it's a five star product.",1141862400,,1528,4.4601449275362315

I'm still hurting from having bought all the episodes just before the box sets were released but I've decided to move on and to talk about the versions that I have instead of moaning about the whole affair.

Anyways, the screenplays for both these episodes are first class.  We get great acting and excitement here as both episodes encapsulate what everyone has grown to associate with Trek: the great storytelling, the humour and excitement all rolled up in 45 minute eps.

Spock's character becomes more grim as the episodes continue but here on the first episode, he actually smiles a couple of times and he doesn't wear his trademark blue uniform until the next episode on this disc.  As any fan will tell you, not all the episodes have great stories or even good acting but that's certainly not the case with these two eps.

If you are not keen on getting the whole set but are looking at selective titles, you should definitely ensure that this DVD is one of them.

228402,4,6300213501,"The signs were there in ""The Wrath of Khan"": Spock's mumbling of the word ""remember"" to a semi-conscious McCoy; the soft landing of Spock's torpodoe-coffin on the surface of the Genesis Planet; and the phrase so often stated by Spock himself--""there are always possibilities"". So it shouldn't have been a surprise when Paramount Pictures--wisely ""leaving the door open a crack""--announced ""Star Trek III: The Search for Spock"". It was a stroke of genius--and good press--to tap Leonard Nimoy to direct the film. And it made sense, too--since Nimoy's character was supposedly ""demised"", it freed him from being in front of the camera and moving behind it.

TSFS picks up where TWOK left off: after the formation of the Genesis Planet, a battle-scarred Enterprise limps back to earth with a skeleton crew. The emptiness of the ship echoes the thoughts of its captain, James T. Kirk. While licking his wounds over the loss of his fallen comrade, he discovers that Dr. McCoy is behaving strangely, showing signs of schizophrenia.

Mark Lenard makes a grand and welcome return to the fold as Spock's father, Ambassador Sarek. In a well-played and dramatic scene, Sarek mind-melds with Kirk to determine if Spock's Katra--his living soul--inhabits Kirk. Soon, both discover that his Katra is being kept by someone else--guess who?

The boundaries of loyalty, friendship, sacrifice, and courage are tested as Kirk and crew put their careers on the line to retrieve Spock, bring him to Vulcan, and perform an ancient but dangerous ritual to restore his Katra to its rightful owner.

What keeps this film from being truly great are some production flaws: when David Marcus and Lt. Saavik arrive on the Genesis Planet to investigate strange readings, the rocks and vegetation surrounding them looks absolutely fake. They're reduced to being 2 actors trudging thru a large studio set. Also, while the fight between Kirk and Commander Kruge is well done--made more thrilling because the planet is falling apart around them--the scene is marred by some phony effects.

TSFS has a stirring musical score as well as key moments that are emotionally powerful: the destruction of the Enterprise (while Kirk and crew watch helplessly from the planet's surface as it goes down in a ball of fire--I had a lump in my throat when I first saw it); and the death of Kirk's son, David, as he ""atones for his sins"" concerning the planet's ill-fated formation (and consequential self-destruction) by sacrificing himself to save Spock and Saavik.

Given the almost-thankless task of the ""heavy"", the talented Christopher Lloyd manages to raise his role of Klingon Commander Kruge above being more than a ""stock villain"". He's even given a delicious line: ""Genesis--I want it!!"" Best of all, Scotty, Chekov, Sulu, and Uhura are given their moments to shine as they aid their captain in breaking Starfleet rules and doing what they think is best. Actor James Sikking (a familiar T.V. face) offers comic relief as the pompous Capt. Styles, commander of a sleek new starship, Excelsior. And Robin Curtis takes over the role of Saavik with precise stoicism. Although she lacks the nuances of Kirstie Alley, she nevertheless looks more like a Vulcan than Alley.

Nimoy deftly weaves action, adventure, ""human emotion"", and Vulcan mysticism into the fabric of the storyline. He could've hit a brick wall in the climax (as in the unfortunate case of ""Trek 5""), but Nimoy's clever enough to add enough surprises and close calls to make the journey in restoring Spock worthwhile.

TSFS may not be perfect, but it sure is a wonderful ride!",1140480000,2,3600,5.048821548821548
228403,5,6300213501,"This movie, bashed and considered an ""odd numbered failure"" in the franchise, is actually better made than ""The Wrath of Kahn.""

While the movie does waste time in ""Spacedock,""  it makes up for the sluggish plot with fine moments of humor. McCoy adopting Spock's personality traits was brilliant. Sulu overcoming the cadet who called him ""Tiny"" is a fan favorite. The Christopher Lloyd Klingon Captain is hilariously brutal.. it's especially clever to have him execute an officer on his bridge, and then have him call the dead crew member ""animal!""

The conclusion could had been better... more fighting, and less standing around a Vulcan ritual... but all and all, this is a great Trek film!

228404,4,6300213501,"Why does Star Trek III break the mold of odd-numbered Trek films being bad?

First off, it features Leonard Nimoy as the director. This was Nimoy's feature film directorial debut, but his familiarity with the Trek universe and with his fellow actors helped to move the picture along. Nimoy was especially familiar with the Enterprise bridge set, so he was able to set up a number of good camera angles there. Additionally, he was able to give every main and supporting character (except Chekov) a short moment to shine on their own.

A defining moment of the Trek franchise occurs when Kirk and McCoy steal the Enterprise. Kirk tells Scotty, Suly and Chekov that they don't have to go with him, and each man tells Kirk they're going. It's that sort of all-for-one attitude that has won Star Trek so many fans over the four decades it's been around.

Also, the film had its fair share of drama. Kirk's destruction of the Enterprise combined with the death of his son David make this one of the weightier entries in the Trek franchise.

Humor also plays a role in the film. Sulu's line of ""Don't call me Tiny"" remains one of the most-remembered bits of dialogue from the films.

More interesting tidbits: spacedock and the USS Excelsior make their debuts in this film. Both miniatures would get frequent usage both in feature films and in later Trek spinoff series. Also, the debut of the more recognized Klingon bird of prey made its mark on the franchise. That miniature would get used several times in films and TV shows up through Deep Space 9 and Voyager. James Sikking of Hills Street Blues fame also maede an appearance as Captain Styles of the Excelsior.

Special features abound on this DVD. Several folks discuss the realism of terraforming. Cast and crew talk about behind-the-scenes happenings. Michael and Denise Okuda provide text commentary offering further insights into the film's creation.

As films go, this Trek feature is one of the better entries in the franchise. The Search for Spock provides an entertaining yarn and a reasonable way for Leonard Nimoy to return to the fold.",1133049600,2,2097,4.808333333333334
228405,4,6300213501,"These two episodes share the theme of great genius gone wrong.  In ""Computer"", Kirk struggles to free the Enterprise from the grip of a computer that's become self-aware.  ""Omega"" had Kirk and crew trapped on a primitive planet whose history is being altered by another starship captain.  Though ""Omega"" is probably more ridiculed (especially for its ending) it's actually a great episode, and the clear winner of the two.

Not to say that ""Ultimate Computer"" is a bad ep - far from it.  When the ""Enterprise"" has Dr. Daystrom's M-5 computer installed so that it can take part in a series of wargames (uh oh!!), the ship also gets Daystrom himself.  Ufortunately, the machine gets too big to take orders from the crew, and not only goes into business for itself, but soon crosses the line between wargames and pure war.  You just can't say enough about actor William Marshal's booming voice.  You'd think that a man who finds it easier to connect with machines than mankind would sound more like Wally Cox - making Marshall's role here one of creative mis-casting.  ""Ultimate"" is also in search of a coherent theme.  Until the machine loses its cybernetic mind, ""Computer"" is a great story about men at risk of being made obsolescent by machines.  And then it goes wrong - and the computer decides that it's human and proceeds to make a great case for it by losing its mind.  While ""The Next Generation"" blurred the line between AI and human intelligence, this episode just assumes that machines consider themselves human and therefore free to act utterly illogically.  The promising plot arc, in which the imperfect minds of Captain Kirk & Crew manage to out-think the master brain, is lost.  Instead of a great discussion about the ironic virtues of man's imperfect mind, we get some morality play about its supremacy.  This is old hat for Trek, which confronted our heroes with a host of thinking machines that also proved susceptible to being talked out of their existence by imperfect men (Nomad, Landru & V'Ger come to mind).  This was the episode that introduced (to Trek, anyway) the term ""Dunsel"".

""Omega Glory"" takes lumps for its ridiculous looking ending, but it's still a great ep - a great variation on the theme of alien societies that model themselves on shreds of our own.  Discovering a derelict starship in orbit of an unexplored planet, Kirk finds its crew wiped out by a mysterious plague - their bodies dissolved into dry crystals.  Realizing that they're infected, Kirk & Crew follow the recorded warnings of the now dead crew of the other ship - beam down to the planet's surface.  There, they find two warring civilizations - Kohms and Yangs.  The first is peaceful, and seems to take its orders from Ron Tracy, the captain of the stricken ship.  The Yangs are savage - the bad guys.  Unfortunately, Tracey has more than the safety of the Kohms to think about.  The immunity of the planet seems to have turned its inhabitants into immortal supermen.  Has Tracy discovered the ""Fountain of Youth?""  And will he have to violate the ""Prime Directive"" to learn its secret?  This was a great ep. that works off its great casting - veteran TV actor Morgan Woodward chews up the script as Tracy, making you wonder how Trek would have looked had it been a show about his adventures.  The ending, in which Kirk rhapsodizes about the virtues of knowing freedom, is pure corn, but Tracy's character keeps the story humming with his fire and brimstone delivery.  (As an alternate-Earth society story, like ""Patterns of Force"" or ""Bread & Circuses"", ""Glory"" is unique in that it saves that revelation for the end.)

Trivia: In ""Glory"", Ron Tracy thinks he's found the fountain of youth.  In the ""Logan's Run"" TV show, Woodward played an ""Elder"" - one of the select few men who were allowed to live past their 30th birthday, even if secretly.",1123804800,,3854,4.7677224736048265
228406,4,6300213501,"The oft-quoted rule that has even-numbered Trek movies beating odd-number movies was never that convincing - and this flick proves it wrong.

Picking up at the moment where ""Wrath of Khan"" left off, ""Search"" has Spock's coffin soft landing on the Genesis planet. Dr. Marcus and Saavik return to their to investigate that world's development. Meanwhile, the badly damaged Enterprise returns to Earth where Captain Kirk learns the ship is to be scrapped. When Dr. McCoy begins showing signs that he was ""mind-melded"" with Spock - thinking he actually is Spock - he tries to get a ship back to the Genesis planet where Spock's body was left. (In a scene that sends up the cantina scene from the first Star Wars flick, McCoy tries getting a ride with an alien who bears a resemblance to the Vorvon from ""Buck Rogers""). Kirk, informed by Spock's father Sarek that both McCoy and Spock's body must be returned to Vulcan, tries to get to Genesis himself, even though Starfleet has quarantined the planet. Meanwhile, Kruge (Christopher Lloyd), a rogue Klingon warlord with his own ship and crew, penetrates federation space greedy for the secrets of Genesis.

Though this flick seems a bit abbreviated - filler between ""Khan"" and ""Voyage Home"" it's not only a lot of fun, but a great example of how good Trek can be. The script has our heroes working outside Starfleet regulations and having loads of fun with each other. Prime examples: Scott explains how he saboutaged the Excelsior to McCoy, dropping that ship's isolinear chips into McCoy's palm like spare change (""From one Doctor to another, when you've learnt how to clean the pipes, you know how to stop the drain""). Kirk, when meeting up with the Spock-possessed McCoy holds his hand up in the Vulcan salute, asking the Doctor ""how many fingers am I holding up""; and let's not forget that magic moment when Bones tries to give a Starfleet Security the Vulcan neck-pinch. Laughs aside, the script is tight and sticks with its central theme of pulling life from death - epitomized by the rescue of Spock and the awesome self-destruction of the Enterprise. Christopher Lloyd's Klingon was underused, but he showed some potential. The special effects beat anything I've seen on the Next-Generation movies and the script makes the characters seem a whole lot livelier.

228408,3,6300213501,"Leonard Nemoy's Star Trek directorial debut succeeds in two vital areas:  A)It's extremely well-paced and B)There's quite a bit of good humor in it.  The story takes place right after Khan's wrath and involves Kirk's starship-jacking of the Enterprise to go look for Spock's body to unite with his mind which in imprinted in McCoy's cranium.  The problem is Spock's body landed on the newly created and recently doomed planet of Genesis.  As luck would have it, a group of ambitious Klingons, led by Christopher Lloyd, want the information to make their own Genesis and go after the research vessel, which is inhabited by Kirk's son and the newly made-over Lt. Saavik, orbiting the planet for the information.

This is just good ol' fashioned Star Trek minus great space battles of the last installment.

228409,5,6300213501,"The Ultimate Computer

Approaching a Starfleet space station, the Enterprise receives orders to test a new computer system. The M-5 multitronic unit, created by foremost computer scientist Dr. Richard Daystrom, is the next evolution in vessel operation and control. The M-5 can operate a starship with a limited number of crew members, a fact that Kirk can't believe. The machine will be tested in vessel maneuvers, routine contact problems, and war game exercises against a task force commanded by veteran ship commander, Commodore Robert Wesley. With the majority of the Enterprise crew on the space station the ship gets underway with a crew of twenty.

Kirk, who thinks that having a single computer run a starship is dangerous, reluctantly goes along with the tests; at first all goes well. The M-5 performs everything asked of it with smooth precision. Various ship maneuvers and landing party decisions for a planetary survey mission are handled by the M-5 with the professionalism and experience of a veteran starship crew. Kirk uneasily watches on as the M-5 handles all the things he has trained his entire life to do. His frustration is further fueled after he witnesses his ship under control of the M-5 reacting to an unscheduled attack drill. The USS Lexington under the command of Commodore Wesley and the USS Excalibur under the command of Captain Harris are outmaneuvered by the M-5 unit and have multiple ""hits"" scored against them.

Kirk's uneasiness is justified when the M-5 destroys the SS Woden, an automated ore freighter. Kirk orders the Enterprise back to the space station and the M-5 to be taken off-line. The M-5 has ideas of its own as the machine, which has protected itself with a force field, kills an engineer trying to disconnect it while drawing more power. With the main attack force for the war games on the way, Spock and Scotty attempt to bypass the M-5, and Kirk and McCoy try to delve into Daystrom himself. In his early twenties, Dr. Richard Daystrom won awards and accolades for his duotronic breakthrough. The Enterprise and her sister ships in Starfleet utilize the duotronic computer systems created by Daystrom. That triumph in Daystrom's career was about a quarter of a century ago and the M-5 unit was to be his comeback.

The M-5 unit shows what a superior system it really is when it fools Scotty and Spock, thwarting their attempt to regain control of the ship. The machine that was impressed with Daystrom's personality to make it more suited to starship control seems invincible and there seems to be no hope for the approaching task force. Kirk's fears are brought to reality when the M-5 opens fire on the unshielded task force with weapons at full power. The machine launches devastating attacks against the task force comprising of the USS Lexington, Excalibur, Potemkin and Hood. The starships were damaged in the unprovoked and calculated M-5 attack pattern. The M-5 renders the Excalibur severely crippled, killing the crew aboard. Kirk desperately has Daystrom try and talk some ""sense"" into his creation only to find the doctor an unstable man who is proud of what his ""child"" has done. Wesley receives permission from Starfleet to stop the Enterprise at all costs with the remaining ships at his command. Trying one final gambit Kirk attempts to convince the M-5 that it has committed murder. The machine using the right and wrong lessons that were programmed into it deactivates itself leaving the ship open to attack. The Enterprise's shields drop, and when the task force goes in for the kill Wesley breaks off the attack at the last second.

Great space battles as the Enterprise tests the M-5 unit.  I guess they figured if the M-5 could survive Kirk then it was ready for mass production and use!",1110499200,,3767,4.924409448818897

228444,4,6300213501,"This film continues the storyline that began with ""The Wrath of Khan"" (which itself is a follow-up of the original series episode ""Space Seed""). Whereas the previous film presents the notion of ""the good of the many outweighs the good of the few, or the one"" this film showcases the premise of ""the good of the one outweighs the good of the many"".

Some pointed observations need to be made pertaining to this generally satisfactory film. The most glaring note for this film is the inexplicable omission of Doctor Carol Marcus. Where is she supposed to be / what role is she supposed to play while her son David is first assigned to the science vessel Grissom and then later murdered by the renegade(?) Klingon contingent led by Kruge? It is as if she in fact passed on before David reached adulthood and hence became a non-entity by the time all these events are taking place. The flipside of this point is the equally inexplicable inclusion of Lieutenant Savvik. Firstly, the switch from Kirsty Alley to Robin Curtis seemingly makes no more sense than, say, changing the actor playing Spock from Leonard Nimoy to someone else (though this was done in the case of Captain Christopher Pike in ""The Cage"" by Jeff Hunter and in ""The Menagerie"" by someone aside from Hunter). Moreover, the Savvik character just did not seem all that integral to the plotline of either this or next film (of course if Alley re-prised the role in both ""Search"" and ""Voyage"" then at least the continuity would have been preserved). As for Robin Curtis, she is a fine actor in her own right/terms, as amply demonstrated by her portrayal of a Vulcan separatist in ST:TNG ""Gambit I and II"" episodes. Nevertheless, since the Savvik character has already been established by Alley, not Curtis, in ""Wrath of Khan"", it seemed inapropriate for anyone other than Alley to be portraying her, if at all.

On balance, this reviewer finds the film better than several Star Trek films, such as ""The Wrath of Khan"" with its egregious continuity discrepancy - Khan having met - and thus remembering - Chekov when in fact he never saw Chekov prior to the meeting at Ceti Alpha V in the film (Khan did not meet Sulu, either), or his reference to having been awakened in the year 1996! The main problem for this film seems to be a lack of clear and distinct identity. In short, this film in practical terms serves as a filler, a conduit between II and IIII, as perhaps intentionally symbolised by not having a main musical theme of its own (the film merely commandeers the one in ""Wrath of Khan"", something that is not true of ""The Voyage Home"").

228447,5,6300213501,"WRITER: Harve Bennett. DIRECTOR: Leonard Nimoy.
THEATRICAL RELEASE: June 1, 1984.
BUDGET ESTIMATE: $17 million.
USA BOX OFFICE: $76 million. WORLDWIDE BOX OFFICE: $87 million.

THE PLOT: Kirk and Co. disobey Federation orders by stealing the Enterprise from space dock (!!) and heading for the forbidden Genesis Planet (created in the previous film) to retrieve Spock's body and clash with Commander Kruge, a Klingon bent on claiming the secrets of the Genesis Project for his own destructive purposes.

COMMENT: For a 1984 film I admit that the Genesis Planet sets aren't the greatest, but they get the job done. Besides, if you're used to watching the TV episodes they're fantastic. Star Trek was never about outstanding special effects anyway (with the exception of the unique and brilliant ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture""); no, Star Trek is about people, their joy of living and their grand spirit of adventure and exploration.

GREAT LINE: Witnessing the emblazed ship go down on the apocalyptic horizon of the Genesis Plane, Kirk asks: ""My God, Bones, what have I done?"" McCoy responds: ""What you HAD to do, Jim, what you ALWAYS do -- turn death into a fighting chance to live.""

QUESTION: Just how far does the Saavik (Robin Curtis) go in helping the teenage Spock get through his first Vulcan ""pon farr"" on the Genesis Planet? The film itself doesn't concretely answer, it simply shows Saavik holding Spock's hand and comforting him. However, since early drafts of ""Star Trek IV"" featured Saavik remaining on Vulcan because she was pregnant with Spock's child, we can assume that Saavik went ALL THE WAY in helping young Spock (!). Okay, so now the question is: Did she do this out of a sense of Vulcan duty or simply to get her jollies with a young Vulcan stud?

Speaking of Robin Curtis, she plays Saavik much more Vulcan-like (i.e. better) than Kirstie Alley in ""The Wrath of Khan"" (I never bought Alley as a Vulcan). In truth, Curtis in nothing less than exceptional in this film.

COMMENT: Although early in the story Sarek describes Spock's 'katra' as his ""living spirit"" and later Kirk refers to it as his ""soul,"" it's clear in the the film that the katra does not refer to spirit or soul in the traditional sense, i.e. one's non-physical life-essence. We know this because, while McCoy possesses Spock's katra, the Vulan's actual consciousness or life-essence is simultaneously within his rapidly-aging regenerating body on the Genesis Planet. Hence, the katra could be accurately described as an incorporeal file of a Vulcan's knowledge and life, which is why Sarek described it as ""everything (Spock) knew, everything he was.""

FYI: I never bought Merritt Butrick as Kirk's son, David, but he's serviceable. He died of AIDS in 1989 at the young age of 29.

ANALYSIS: ""The Search for Spock"" is a great Star Trek picture embellished by the welcome return of Trek's quirky brand of humor. The story expertly meshes comedic touches with dead-serious tragedy. It's also thoroughly enjoyable and compelling to see Kirk & crew in the wry and unexpected role of Starfleet rebels, risking everything to honor their fallen comrade. Another highlight is the return of Klingons as major villains, with upgraded make-up no less.

The only problem with this Trek installment is revealed in the title -- there's no Spock, at least as we know him, but the film does a fabulous job of instilling a sense of the Vulcan's lingering presence. The story climaxes with the powerful image of Spock's mates warmly gathering together. This scene is worth the wait where a simple raised eyebrow fills the viewer with incredible warmth and joy (not to mention the shedding of a few tears).

Also, I gotta hand it to the creators for coming up with an inspired and (seemingly) credible way of resurrecting Spock; the Genesis Project was, by happenstance, the perfect catalyst.

FINAL WORD: ""Star Trek III"" is inexplicably condemned by fundamentalist trekkers as a failure or, at best, mediocre.

They're wrong.",1092873600,4,4000,4.971556886227545

228468,4,6300213501,"Leonard Nimoy spent most of his time behind the camera directing this film, and though I miss his presence as Spock, it's one of my favorite of the Star Trek series; it's more subdued and introspective than the others, and the overall theme is friendship, and risking one's life for a friend.
The year is 8210, and the plot centers around ""The Genesis Effect"", an experimental device that can be placed on a ""lifeless space body"", like a dead moon, and make it flourish with life, but because one of the scientists used risky methods, ""life"" is happening at a fast clip.
The evil Klingons of course, in their constant lust for power, want the ""Genesis"" secret, and Admiral Kirk must stop them.
William Shatner is fabulous as Kirk; I've always found him to be a unique, immensely watchable actor, and all the original ensemble cast is wonderful: DeForest Kelley ~ McCoy, James Doohan ~ Scotty, George Takei ~ Sulu, Walter Koenig ~ Chekov, Nichele Nichols ~ Uhura. Added are Mark Lenard as Spock's father Sarek, Robin Curtis as Lt. Saavik, Merritt Butnick as Kirk's son David, and Christopher Lloyd as the Klingon Kruge. Dame Judith Anderson plays the Vulcan priestess TLar, in a scene that is high camp, and quite marvelous.
There are some nifty special effects on the Planet Genesis, and some nice cinematography by Charles Correll, as well as an exceptionally lovely score by James Horner. Leonard Nimoy gave this film a moody, thoughtful atmosphere, and it works for me, and I find the ending quite touching, no matter how many times I see it.

- Kirk gives the Vulcan Salute to Dr. McCoy as they both escape a trip from The Federation Funny Farm, and look for a lost pointed ear friend in ""Star Trek III: The Search For Spock""
Its been 20 years to the day since the search began in this third and underated entry in the ""Star Trek"" saga. ""The Search For Spock"" is an adventurous (if corny) film that teaches a lesson in the loyalties, & importance of friendship, no matter the consequence.
Picking up where ""Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan"" left off, with the death & funeral of Captain Spock & the birth of the Genesis Planet, ""The Search For Spock"" begins with the crew of The Enterprise limping home after the battle wrath with Khan, only to find out that the Federation has decided to decommission the legendary starship & reassign most of its crew. Whats worse is the fact that Dr. ""Bones"" McCoy is having a sort of nervous breakdown, breaking in to Captain Spock's sealed quarters and giving Admiral Kirk an errie message from the grave.
When Spock's father, Ambassador Saarik, arrives informing Kirk that Spock isn't dead, but, is in a state where mind & body are in seperate forms, its up to both, Kirk & Saarik to find who has Spock's marbles (McCoy has them) & where Spock's body rests (on The Genisis Planet). Once both are retrieved, and thru an ancient Vulcan ritual, only then can Spock become his old self again. With the arrival of the Kilngons, looking for the secret to Genesis, its a race against time as the planet becomes unstable and starts to deteriate at an alarmingly fast rate. The search isn't without sacrfice & Kirk loses the two things he holds dearest to him in order get his friend back.
""Star Trek III"" is one of those films thats pretty much written for fans of the series (if this film was your introduction to ""Star Trek"", I'm pretty positive your reaction was more of a ""Huh!?"" with a shrug of the shoulders). I hold this as the fifth best in the series tieing it with ""Star Trek: Generations"" (""II"" & ""First Contact"" are the two best in the series).
The Klingons finally get some much needed screen time in this film. Since they were the main nemesis in the television series, it was only a matter of time before they would show up (the Klingons make a cameo in ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture""). A year before he went ""Back To The Future"", Christopher Lloyd gives a great performance as Commander Kruge, the greedy, power hungry Klingon commander. Kruge is much better than the two Klingons in ""Star Trek V"". Those two reminded me of the Wonder Twins from the ""Super Friends"", for some reason. The Klingons in ""Star Trek VI"" came across as more regal and honorable than threatening and coldblooded, like Kruge is. As for Shatner and the rest of the cast, all are also great & age gracefully in their respective roles.
James Horner's score to ""III"", like ""II"", is one of the better scores in the series (acutally, I think, its a lot of reused score material from the previous film, but, I just get so tired of hearing Jerry Goldsmith's opening theme from ""The Motion Picture"". Its been used in at least half of the the ten films, as well, as the opening theme to ""The Next Generation"" series). Leonard Nimoy directs his first of two ""Trek"" films (""III"" is his directorial debut) and gets a lot out of his actors and does a good job overall.
The 2 disc DVD edition to ""Star Trek III: The Search For Spock"" is worth owning and is better than ""Star Trek V"" on any given Sunday. Join the Search.",1086048000,,3549,4.478395061728395
228471,4,6300213501,"First, here's what I didn't like: Kirk's son dies, and the Enterprise is destroyed. I know they wanted gripping drama, but still, doing ether one of the two seemed a bit too much. The Enterprise has been home to it's crew (and, in a way, to the fans) since the first T.V. episode, and the death of Kirk's son, well...it's his _son_. Otherwise, why does everyone concider this one of the weaker episodes? SPOCK LIVES. His ressurection should have been enough to make any true fan stand up and cheer. There's also enough action to satisfy anyone. Kirk and crew (minus Spock) must face off against not only the dastardly Klingons, but also against their own superiors at Starfleet. This is also the first film where we see the Excellcior, my favorite Star Trek ship. Check this film out.",1083801600,,784,4.64748201438849
228472,4,6300213501,"There was a point in time where I really wished that this movie had not been made.  The death of Spock at the end of ""Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan,"" was a high point in the history of the ""Star Trek"" universe.  When Spock, separated by a thick piece of plastic shielding, tells Kirk for the last time ""I have been and always shall be your friend,"" it is a devastating moment.  Kirk and Spock are one of the great ""odd"" friendships of all time, in or out of the realm of science fiction (they are the Aubrey and Maturin of their future time and place).  The ""Star Trek"" franchise was served by this 1984 film, since it spawned three more outings for the original cast and inspired a quartet of television spinoffs, but I am not sure if the characters benefited as well.  I still think ""Wrath of Khan"" is far and away the best ""Star Trek"" film, with ""Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home"" coming in second.  There are some nice moment with Spock on ""Star Trek: The Next Generation,"" although there are more between Captain Picard and Sarek, Spock's father, and the death of James T. Kirk in ""Star Trek: Generations"" certainly pales compared to that of Spock.
So making this third ""Star Trek"" film took something away the death of Spock, but even wishing it had never been made I still have to admit this film has its moment.  The whole Vulcan ""katra"" bit is a deus ex machina pulled out of a hat and Spock's tube landing on the Genesis planet so that his body can be regenerated, growing at precisely the right rate so that when the download Spock's katra from McCoy's mind we are back to where we were at the end of the previous movie is just an absurd conjunction of circumstances.  But at the heart of this film is the relationship between Kirk and Spock.  William Shatner's performance in the key scenes, early on when he relives Spocks' death with Sarek and at the end when Spock is restored, have a weight that overcomes a lot of objections and which is clearly privileged by Harve Bennett's script and Leonard Nimoy's direction.
That friendship has always been there and many of the high points of the original television series were where it was acknowledged, albeit almost always obliquely.  At the end of ""Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan"" it was made painfully explicit, and that powerful moment is revisited at the end of ""Star Trek III: The Search for Spock,"" as Kirk stands there before his friend, having sacrificed his only son and the ship that has been his home for what seems like his entire life, because ""The needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many.""  This flip of Spock's motivation for going into that chamber and sacrificing his life is not glib, because it speaks to a great human paradox.  Namely that we believe both positions are true and that not only do the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the one but that the exact opposite is true.  Each film in turn proves its thesis.",1083542400,10,2907,4.451977401129944

I'm not advocating violence for violence sake but it wouldn't have hurt here.
All Our Yesterdays has its share of stupidity as well.  Kirk and Spock haven't learned anything from all their previous voyages by they way they act in this story. 'Leap before you Look' is the theme here.  Maybe Spock's behavior is poorly explained but this story led to one of my favorite Trek novels Yesterday's Son and its follow up Time For Yesterday. 4 stars on that alone.",1078790400,,687,4.60655737704918

Well, maybe when Kirk told Spock to fire at the 'computer' and the unnamed Lt. fired at the 'cube' hanging from the ceiling, which made no sense at all!  And that's with the full-length original episode.  It looks like they edited something important out of the story, or more probably just ran out of time.
On a negative note, Let That Be Your Last Battlefield was a poor excuse of a 'moral story' about prejudice.

228519,4,6300213501,"Wrath of Khan took Paramount by surprise. The studio expected the production to fare much worse than the first film as sequels usually do less business than the first film in a series. While it grossed less than ST:TMP, it also cost less. The revamped Enterprise sets and redressing of the Enterprise for other ships, helped save cost making it more profitable. Much more important, the fans loved the film. That inspired Paramount head Michael Eisner to give Harve Bennett the green light for a sequel. Unfortunately, a major character died at the end of Trek II. Luckily, no one really dies in science fiction films.
Search For Spock starts out with a fascinating premise; when Spock died at the conclusion of Wrath of Khan, he placed his ""soul"" into another character for safe keeping until Kirk could return his ""soul"" to Vulcan. Unfortunately, Dr. McCOy the keeper of Spock's essence, has become mentally unbalanced and confused by having Spock inhabit his mind at the same time.
Sarek, Spock's father, goes to Kirk and makes him aware of what's happened. Kirk plagued by guilt feels he needs to collect Spock's body and his mind and return them to Vulcan for a proper Vulcan funeral. Unfortunately, Star Fleet disagrees and won't let Kirk go back to the Genesis planet where Spock's body resides. What's more, the Enterprise is being decommissioned and headed for the scrapheap. Without a vessel or means to get to Genesis (which has been declared off limits by Star Fleet until Kirk's son Dr. David Marcus can study the planet and prove its safe to inhabit), Kirk must do what he's always done best--disregard his orders.
Leonard Nimoy's directorial debut is almost as strong as Wrath of Khan and highly entertaining. Nimoy's deft hand as a director allows him to get the best possible performance from his cast and tell a story he's quite familar with as well.
The optical effects by ILM look stunning on this special edition DVD. Unlike Wrath of Khan, the movie is the same as the previous versions. The transfer, though, is sharp and the colors vivid. The anamorphic transfer (which translates to higher lines of resolution=better picture and clarity)is magnificient.
Paramount has packed the second disc with a number of great featurettes including one on the optical effects/models, the terraforming concept and a tribute to actor Mark Lenard (Sarek). Additionally, there's the original trailers and publicity material and interviews included as well.

228520,4,6300213501,"Well by todays F/X standards this series may seem a little cheesy to a young audience. Those of us that watched it numerous times since it originally aired on TV don't see it that way. Sure we realize there are better effects these days, but better crew interaction? No. Captain Kirk was the tough leader, Spock the intellectual, Bones the well mannered humane doctor, Scotty the engineer who could fix anything. All the rest of the supporting crew were great as well.

I challenge anyone to show me a series where they have the comradery of this series. I must admit Stargate SG-1 probally runs a close second, but you can't beat the orginal ST series. Even though we have heard stories that William Shatner did not interact well with several members of the cast, on screen there is no denying his ability as Captain James Tiberius Kirk.

This DVD is a must have to start your set. Not to mention it is interesting to note how the costumes, sets, and acting style changes as the crew grew into their parts. It always makes me smile to hear Spock shouting status in the first couple of episodes. Sure I have enjoyed watching all the other Star Trek series, but none more than this set. I bought the entire DVD set even though I do wish they had put more than two episodes and the original TV trailers per DVD.

228522,3,6300213501,"""Star Trek: The Search for Spock"" came in the middle of the golden era of Star Trek films (1979-86, when ""Star Trek"" ruled at the box office and got critical raves), and it's a fairly well made entry in the long series.  Comparisons between it and its immediate predecessor ""The Wrath of Khan"" are inevitable- perhaps this is why many fans were disappointed with this entry, because it fails to live up to ""The Wrath of Khan"" and has many flaws.  However, I have still allowed it into my DVD collection, and there's plenty here for a ""Star Trek"" fan to like.
""The Search for Spock""'s biggest flaw is in its pacing.  The first half hour of the film is very slow and not very interesting, as Kirk debates with others about Vulcan mythology and the current status of Spock's soul.  Hard-core fans will undoubtedly love this stuff, but as a more casual fan I wasn't very excited with it.  Likewise, the movie's final 20 minutes also are very slow and ponderous, with the final scene (I won't give it away) being the only highlight.
This pacing problem is a shame, because the film's middle hour is almost on the same caliber as ""The Wrath of Khan"" was.  There are many tense and involving scenes as the Enterprise flees from a hostile Starfleet and battles evil Klingons on the Genesis planet.
Just like the last film, William Shatner's work as Kirk here is very good- he's effective at portraying Kirk's anguish over the loss of Spock, and then his resolve to save his friend no matter what.  Leonard Nimoy's direction is pretty good considering that this was his first major film, and the ""Star Trek"" regulars show great ease with their roles here.  Christopher Lloyd isn't as good as Richardo Montalban was, but is still effectively menacing as the Klingon Commander.  Merritt Buttrick is improved as Kirk's son, and makes us care about his fate.  Only Robin Curtis as Saavick is horribly miscast- she fails to make us care about her character at all.
In conclusion, ""The Search for Spock"" is an adequate ""Star Trek"" adventure that will surely please fans, though casual sci-fi fans may not like it as much.  I'd recommend it to anyone who's building a ""Star Trek"" collection.",1074643200,,2175,4.667539267015707

228560,5,6300213501,"Star Trek: The Original Series Volume 1 presents two episodes from 1966:
""Where No Man Has Gone Before:"" Although this was the third episode aired, it's actually the pilot that sold the show to NBC. Many things make it obvious that this is the pilot -- e.g. no McCoy or Uhura, drab colorless uniforms, absence of skimpy miniskirts, ray gun rifle, etc. There's nothing childish about this episode. There's no kid or jokster robot as in, say, Lost In Space. Even the music is dramatic and powerful. The chemistry between Kirk & Spock is right there from the opening scene featuring the duo. The subject of ""absolute power corrupts absolutely"" is explored as the momentum of interest, mystery and suspense builds culminating in the action-filled climax. A one-of-a-kind debut adequately testifying that Star Trek was a winner right out of the opening gate. GRADE: A+
""The Corbomite Maneuver:"" An excellent suspense-building episode with a simple moral: appearances can be deceiving. This segment would've made a great pilot as well with its excellent combination of space exploration, mystery, creepy aliens and characterization. McCoy, Uhura and Yeoman Janice Rand all make their debut here. It's obvious that this is the first episode produced for TV after the NBC executives approved the (second) pilot because most of the characters are still developing. For instance, you'll notice Spock's uncharacteristic shouting and almost-apology to Kirk for having no helpful suggestions, Uhura's one-dimensional dialogue (""Hailing frequencies open, sir"") and Rand, who appears as little more than a Starship maid. Bottom Line: it's slow and ship-confined but somehow strangely fascinating. The baby-like Balok hiding behind a much more menacing facade is a great idea. The occasional visuals of the fearsome alien greatly add to the mounting suspense. The awe and mystery of space exploration is successfully captured. GRADE: A
Incidentally, ever wonder who came up with the idea to dress the ladies in those ridiculously short miniskirt ""uniforms""? When Grace Lee Whitney (Janice Rand) was hired on after the acceptance of the pilot they dressed her in the same black stretch pants seen in that episode. Whitney basically said ""No way,"" insisting that the girls should look like girls. Her protests led to William Ware Theiss' design of the now infamous hotpants uniform.",1069372800,,2364,5.289893617021277

228565,3,6300213501,"Hoping to cash in yet again on the heels of the hugely successful second ""Star Trek"" film, ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn"" (1982), Paramount Pictures produced a third film for the franchise entitled ""Star Trek III: The Search for Spock"".  This third film took on a new dimension by being directed by the actor who had played the character of Spock for over 10 years, Leonard Nimoy.  This was not Nimoy's first time in the director's chair as he had previously directed two episodes for two different TV series, but it was his first directorship of a big-screen motion picture.  Joining Gene Roddenberry again for writing was Harve Bennett, who had helped to write ""The Wrath of Kahn"", as well as Leonard Nimoy, whose writing was not credited.
Though Spock's character was killed at the conclusion of ""The Wrath of Kahn"", the door remained open for his potential return since his body was left on the Genesis planet, which was a living planet created out of lifelessness.  Still mourning Spock's death was the U.S.S. Enterprise crew: Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner), Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy (DeForest Kelley), Commander Montgomery 'Scotty' Scott (James Doohan), Commader Hikaru Sulu (George Takei), Commander Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig) and Commander Uhura (Nichelle Nichols).  Kirk is visited by Spock's father, Vulcan Ambassador Sarek (Mark Lenard), who inquires about Spock's soul.  After a mind meld that confirms that Kirk doesn't have Spock's soul, the two review the events just prior to Spock's death and realize that Dr. McCoy has Spock's soul.  Sarek explains Dr. McCoy must be brought to Mount Seleyah on Vulcan along with Spock's body in order for both to have peace.  Placing his friends above everything else, Kirk and the other primary Enterprise officers decide to steal the Enterprise to return to the Genesis planet, which Starfleet Command has made a forbidden destination.  Having been heavily damaged in the battle with Kahn in the previous film, the Enterprise was decommissioned, but Scotty manages to secretly prepare the ship for departure.  Meanwhile, the Genesis planet is under study by Kirk's son, Dr. David Marcus (Merrick Butrick), and Lt. Saavik (Robin Curtis); but a determined Klingon captain, Captain Kruge (Christopher Lloyd, known more being the 'Doc' in the ""Back to the Future"" films), wants to obtain the Genesis technology for the Klingon Empire.  The development of the Genesis technology by David Marcus and his mother, Dr. Carol Marcus (Bibi Besch), was a feature in the previous film ""The Wrath of Kahn"", but Bibi Besch did not appear in this third film.  Also, Lt. Saavik, whose character was introduced in ""The Wrath of Kahn"", was played originally by Kirstie Alley (best known for her character of Rebecca Howe in the long-running TV series ""Cheers"").
The most memorable scenes in ""Star Trek III: The Search for Spock"" include Sarek's visit with Kirk, McCoy's occasional Vulcan behaviors, McCoy's conversation with an alien (Allan Miller) in a bar, Lt. Uhura's conversation with 'Mr. Adventure' (Scott McGinnis), the Enterprise leaving space dock, David's fight with a Klingon (David Cadiente), the abandonment of the Enterprise, the end of Kirk's fight with Kruge, and Mount Seleyah with T'Lar (Judith Anderson).  With Leonard Nimoy absent during most of the film, much of the action depended primarily upon William Shatner, who is not the greatest actor.  The best acting in the film came from James Doohan, DeForest Kelley and Mark Lenard.  Sadly, the sets used for the Genesis planet were not very realistic and much of the action that takes place on its surface was not particularly memorable.  The unexpected Vulcan boy who ages rapidly was played by four different actors: Carl Steven, Vadia Potenza, Stephen Manley and Joe W. Davis.
Overall, my rating of for ""Star Trek III: The Search for Spock"" is only 3 out of 5 stars because of the lackluster acting during much of the action scenes, poor set design, and anticlimactic ending.  The film does have some good points and is worth watching, but could have been much better in my opinion.  I don't necessarily recommend purchase of the film on DVD, but it does fill in the gap between ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn"" and ""Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home"", which are two of the franchises best films that were ever made.",1058140800,2,4337,5.008344923504868

228569,4,6300213501,"After the success of Nicholas Meyer's Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, it soon became apparent that the Trek franchise could continue, with or without Spock.  Despite rumors to the contrary, Leonard Nimoy had never stipulated in his contract for Star Trek II that Spock be killed off.  According to Nimoy (as revealed in  a ""the making of"" featurette), the actor really did think that the second film would be the finale of the Star Trek movies, so why not have Spock go out in a blaze of glory?
However, even before production ended on The Wrath of Khan, Nimoy and producer Harve Bennett decided that ""there were always possibilities"" for the future, both for the franchise and Spock.
Thus it came to pass that Star Trek III: The Search for Spock had its, pun intended, genesis.  With a subtle scene here and a more upbeat ending there, several plot strands were left unresolved....what did Spock mean when he gave Dr. McCoy a mind meld with the word ""Remember?""  Why was he left on the Genesis Planet?  Those two scenes, coupled with Nimoy reciting ""Space: The Final Frontier"" at the end of the second movie practically screamed ""Sequel Ahead!""
As it happened, Star Trek III would also mark Nimoy's feature-film directorial debut.  Although he was given a modest budget - which does, unfortunately, become obvious in many scenes - Nimoy fared fairly well his first time out as a director.
As in the movie that follows (The Voyage Home), Bennett and Nimoy give us a mix of adventure, suspense and even moments of comedy in the continuation of a three-movie story arc.
The setup is simple.  After the events depicted in Star Trek II, the USS Enterprise has been ordered back to Earth.  Spock is dead, the Enterprise's trainee crew has been reassigned, and Starfleet has quarantined the Genesis planet.  Only a science vessel, USS Grissom, has been assigned to survey the forbidden world.
Little does the Federation know, however, that the Klingons have found out about the Genesis device. Fearing that the Federation has plans to destroy the Klingon Empire, Commander Kruge (Christopher Lloyd) is determined to obtain its secrets.
At the same time, upon his return to Earth Admiral Kirk (William Shatner) discovers that Spock has somehow placed his ""katra"" in Dr. McCoy's (the late DeForest Kelley) body.  Kirk is urged by Sarek, Spock's father (the late Mark Lenard) to retrieve Spock's remains from the Genesis planet.  After that, Kirk is to go to Vulcan with McCoy and Spock's body, where both of his friends will ""find peace.""
When Kirk requests permission to take the soon-to-be retired Enterprise back to Genesis to retrieve Spock's body, Starfleet Command refuses, saying that the science ship (where Lt. Saavik and Kirk's son David Marcus are now serving) is the only ship allowed by the Federation to investigate.  As usual, Kirk takes matters into his own hands and, assembling most of his bridge crew, steals the Enterprise and warps off to Genesis, setting up a sequence of events that Kirk will find to be more costly than he bargained for.
The Collector's Edition DVD set, unlike the previous two Director's Editions, has no added scenes or director's cut version.  The theatrical version of the film (with a running time shy of two hours) is featured here with director's audio commentary by Nimoy and text commentary by Michael Okuda.  The movie will delight some Trek fans, satisfy most fans, and disappoint others.  (This being an odd-numbered film, it seems to prove the theory that even numbered Treks are great, while odd-numbered ones are either just okay or just plain bad!) The extra features disc includes the usual mix of ""making of"" documentaries, interviews, and the theatrical trailer (which, unfortunately, gave away a crucial plot device).",1055289600,9,3771,4.9336492890995265

Especially when he handled the stealing of the 'Enterprise' scene in a very exciting, capable, and funny way.  However, as soon as Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner) and company embarks on a voyage towards the Genesis planet to look for Spock's body, the movie starts losing its pace.  Although, there is a moment of excitement when our heroes confront a Klingon Bird Of Prey, concluding with the destruction of the 'Enterprise' -a moment that I consider the saddest after Spock's death at the end of ""Star Trek II-The Wrath Of Khan"".
""Star Trek III-The Search For Spock"" is a fine film, as well as an OK debut of Nimoy as a director, but I think this movie should have needed a bit more energy.

Leonard Nimoy directed this third feature film outing in the Star Trek series, and it shows that this is a series in transition, up to and including Kirk's willful destruction of the Enterprise, and an interesting look at Vulcan rituals.  The Search for Spock isn't the best film in the series, but it isn't the worst either (Star Trek V Anyone?), and it serves as a nice bridge between the best films in the series: Wrath of Khan and the hugely sucessful The Voyage Home.

228605,5,6300213501,"I've been a fan of The Original Series since I started watching the reruns when I was about 12 years old, and having the episodes on DVD brings back a lot of memories of those days.  For one thing the episodes have been digitally remastered, resulting in a much cleaner and clearer picture that looks almost new.  The stories themselves also manage to bring back the wonder of those years, although I haven't seen them on TV in a long time.  ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"" and ""The Corbomite Maneuver"" are two of my favorite episodes, so I was pretty glad when Paramount decided to release them on DVD.
One of the major complaints I hear about these DVDs is that they have no extras.  Not true.  Although Paramount has a reputation for putting no extras on their DVDs, each and every Original Series DVD has the original TV promos for the episodes on the DVD, plus there's an ""Easter egg"" that includes more of these promos.  While it's true that it would have been nice to have things such as cast and crew bios, it doesn't really matter to me because I enjoy the episodes for themselves, not for the extras that are on the DVD with them.
The other major complaint is that there's only two episodes per DVD when there could be six.  This is no big deal to me even if it is a move by Paramount to make more money, as some have said.  In fact, I feel that it makes viewing the episodes much easier because the total running time is about the same as a feature film, and if you watch only one episode, there's no going through the menu a few days later and trying to remember where you stopped at.
All in all, the Star Trek-The Original Series DVDs are well worth the cost, and definitely something you'll want to watch again and again.",1049846400,,1734,4.330246913580247

228609,5,6300213501,"We must be reaching the end, because Volume 39 of The Star Trek DVD series contians two of the last great episodes producedin the series three season run.
At first look THE SAVAGE CURTAIN may be considered a ridiculously silly episode.  This is the infamous episode where 'Abraham Lincoln' makes an appearance.  True that this episodes plot is way too far out to ever actually occur but still you have to give the writers credit for their creativity even if this is too cheesy.  Basically the story goes that the Enterprise crew are abducted by a friendly alien entity who takes the form of Lincoln.  Lincoln insists he is who he actually is and requests that Kirk and Spock accompany him to the molten planet where (unbeknowst to our heroes) the rock like aliens, the Excalbians have organized a battle between good and evil.  Pitting (good) Kirk, Spock, Lincoln and the greatest Vulcan philosopher Surak against (evil) Genghis Khan, Kahless the Unforgettable (founder of the Klingon Empire), Col. Green (someone who supposedly is a Tyrant in our future) and Zora (some fairly forgettable experimental witch tyrant here).  The story has essentially an anti-war message.  Some people consider this to be one of the worst episodes.  I actually greatly disagee with that thought on this show.  Of course it's nowhere near the best but it's effective and creative, especially considering that (by this time) the Star Trek series was on life support.  Not the best but good for third season standards.  Hey, at least they didn't credit Abraham Lincoln played by himself!
ALL OF OUR YESTERDAYS was the last great Star Trek episode to ever make it into production.  Being only an episode away from the end of the series' three year run, in retrospect they should have ended with this one.  The story essentially deals with time travel.  The Enterprise journeys to Sarpeidon and Kirk, Spock and McCoy meet a peculiar old librarian (played by Ian Wolfe).  It's a really effective time travle episode since this story has three settings: Present day Sarpeidon, Kirk in Sarpeidon's Victorian age, Spock and McCoy in Sarpeidon's ice age.  The last setting really steals this episode.  Partly because we see Spock's barbaric nature take him over.  There is no doubt why Nimoy is on the front of the DVD case.  He even gets an effective love interest in this story (played by Mariette Hartley).  An interesting plot, great acting and a somewhat tragic ending make tihs episode one of the more memrable episodes from the tail end of the Star Trek series.
Overall this is another must.  One of the better pair of episodes from the end Star Trek's wildly uneven third season. Highly recommended.",1048204800,5,2679,4.8957871396895785
228641,3,6300213501,"Volume 37 of The Star Trek DVD series contains two of the lesser episodes from the show's third and final season.  This collection points out the low points of the third season because both episodes are quite weak.
THE LIGHTS OF ZETAR is the better of the two here.  However that's not saying much.  An evil alien entity invades the body of Lt. Mira Romaine (Jan Shutan) Scotty's new love interest.  The alien is from Zetar and threatens the crew that Mira will die.  Essentially this episode is a blue print for the famous horror film 'The Exorcist' however this episode lacks any distinct depth.  The episode isn't the worst in the series and Jan Shutan makes a nice acting appearance here.  However the story is weak, Scotty's love interest is completely unconvincing (like all the others he had), and the ending of this episode is completely lame.  I don't think evil possessive aliens can be defeated so easily by a pressure chamber!
It's gets worse though.  THE CLOUD MINDERS has to be one of the weakest Star Trek scripts ever to make it into production.  The episode try to tackles the discrimiantion issue between upper and lower class people, but ends up flopping over and the message is not only vague but incomplete.  The budget (which was really low at this point) was spent entirely on set and costume design.  Therefore we have a really weak script and some pretty mediocre and shoddy acting.  Although this episode may have been good had the budget been spent better and the plot developed more.  Even a double serving of eye candy with Diana Ewing (who plays Droxine, a rich Stratos girl who becomes a totally unbelieveable love interest for Spock) and Charlotte Polite, cannot save this episode from the depths of humilation.

Bele insists that Lokei has committed some terrible crimes nad must pay the price.  However Lokei pleads that his kind on Charon are treated like this by authority regardless of what they have done.

I think III is often overlooked because of its very serious tone; there's only a few scenes that are humorous (like Sulu's ""don't call me tiny"" schtick). However, what we have here is a great sci-fi/drama with great performances (especially Christopher Lloyd as the Klingon commander). James Horner produces another good musical score (albeit it's not nearly as ambitious as his score for II) and Leonard Nimoy does a good job in his first directorial outing, which would be perfected in the next episode of the series, The Voyage Home.

Partly because each has it's own ""landmark moment in American television"".  In reality these moments are barely noticable and these two Trek episodes are just as mediocre as the rest that came out of the third season.
PLATO'S STEPCHILDREN opens this one.  Yeah I know. I've heard it a thousand times: ""tv's first interracial kiss"" between William Shatner and Nichelle Nichols.  The truth is (according to Shatner himself) that two scenes of this were shot. One that was actually a kiss and the other that wasn't.  The latter was chosen in the original airing and they have never bothered to put the actual kiss in any reruns.  Therefore technically there is nothing special about this one.  The plot is typical Star Trek and this episode showcases some of the actors most embarassing moments.  Still this is good for a laugh.  Especially when the dwarf Alexander mounts Kirk like a horse and our good Capt. begins to 'neigh'.  Apart from those embarassing moments and a few touching acting scenes between Kirk and Alexander this episode is pretty forgettable.
The second episode here is WINK OF AN EYE which fairs little better than PLATO'S STEPCHILDREN.  For whatever reason I have always felt the sound in this one was muffled.  Maybe it was just me?  Anyways the supposed off camera sex scene between Kirk and the girl isn't very noteworthy.  As a matter of fact I didn't even notice it until another Amazon.com reviewer mentioned it!  The plot to WINK OF AN EYE is interesting but in the long run it's merely the Star Trek crew being invaded by bizarre aliens once again.  As I said many times before, it's been done!  Anybody else notice that the camera work of this episode was almost always on a slant?  Just a thought...
Overall these two episodes are definetly watchable but I find neither them are as special as they claim to be.  Keep in mind these were released in 1968 so perhaps they were considered more shocking back then but I find it hard to believe since Star Trek's ratings and popularity were at an all time low when they aired.  Not the best but it's classic Trek so go on try it!  Recommended!",1045180800,,2274,4.6775818639798485
228647,2,6300213501,"I enjoy most of the Star Trek television shows, and some of the movies.  This movie was showing while I was on a flight from Japan to the US many years ago, and it was the first I'd seen it.
I normally can't sleep sitting up, but this movie did the trick for me.  Halfway through the film (probably during one of the dramatic scenes between Kirk and his estranged son) I drifted off, and arrived back home well rested thanks to Captain Kirk and company.
I recommend it to non-fanatics who are having trouble getting to sleep.",1044316800,7,525,4.346938775510204
228648,4,6300213501,"Ok, lets not mince words here. If your buying these like I am, you doing it because you liked the show. And you'll probably like these epidsodes. With edisode 2, it's alittle surprising to see how young everyone looked, and I couldn't help noticing a major difference in the design of the bridge and Spock's eyebrows betwwen episodes 2 and 3. The uniforms seemed to magically change alitle too. It seemed as though they weren't completely ready to do the show when they did the first two episodes. The abrurt changes in episode 3 do kind of make it seem cheesey.
  Another downside to this that I noticed is that it seems as though the volume level isn't constant. Perhaps this is a result of the re-mastering and conversion to Dolby 5.1. The music was much louder than the voices and I found myself adjusting the volume constantly. Image quality is better than I remembered from seeing it on T.V, but is still obviously limited due to the original source tape.
  In summary, if your a Trek fan, which I am, and you like the original series, which I do, this is a great way to bring it back again. It's no longer shown in sydication where I live, so this is great way for me to get to see it again. However, If you expect the absolute greatest picture and sound possible by today's standards, your not going to get it. These haven't been made over again, just digitized and put on DVD. The limitations of early video recording methods are stiil evident. You just can't get here from way back there.

228649,5,6300213501,"As everyone knows this is the second pilot filmed in hopes of launching the Star Trek series and there are a number of differences between this particular show and the others that followed. Most notable immediately is the slightly varied opening and closing theme music; there is no voice-over narration by Shatner in the opening credits either. Other visible differences include the uniforms, the look of the recreation room and the conference room, the odd appearing intercom Kirk speaks into, Sulu is assigned to Life Sciences, the doctor is played by someone else, etc. It still is a very strong episode with a great story encapsulated in a taut script and cast well with the surprising guest stars Gary Lockwood (pre '2001: A Space Odyssey' fame) and Sally Kellerman (pre 'M.A.S.H.' fame) turning in excellent performances.
The Enterprise beams aboard a flight recorder from the missing and 200 year old ship U.S.S. Valiant, all that is left of the ship as near as can be determined. The tapes of the flight recorder reveal a very strange and disturbing story concerning the ship's encounter with an unusual force at the edge of the galaxy and also an obsessive interest in the subject of E.S.P. The tapes are too damaged to determine all the facts surrounding the log's narrative; Kirk decides to venture beyond the same demarcation line and that brings about devastating results for two crewmembers. Kirk is forced to take the dire matters into his hands and is left with only one diabolic but very necessary choice if he and the crew of the Enterprise, indeed the whole galaxy, are to survive.
After viewing the original pilot 'The Cage' it was described as ""too cerebral"" by the NBC studio heads that allowed the Trek creators to produce a second pilot. Though this show is also somewhat cerebral by nature, in 'Where No Man Has Gone Before' Kirk does get into a climactic fistfight, gets his shirt torn to expose his chest and proves himself a crack shot with a rifle. ""ALLRIGHT! Now that's more like it! Give us more like this!"" was the enthusiatic reaction of the studio heads to this second go-round (or least my exaggerated interpretation of their response). I don't want to downplay the serious undertones of the episode though; there is real tragedy here. The loss of Kirk's friend and ship's navigator Gary Mitchell and the medical department's newcomer Elizabeth Dehner is a devastating blow to the young captain. Lockwood's portrayal of Mitchell as a newly crowned deity like being is absolutely dead-on perfect. His taunting of Kirk is both creepy and agitating; when he speaks of his powers he sounds only egotistical and not enlightened. Kirk memorably summarizes his friend's quandary quite succinctly and eloquently in the exciting climax.
'The Corbomite Maneuver' is an equally good episode, creating some genuine suspense and a clever, fast thinking and nefarious looking alien in Balok. The ship he commands is also very intriguing; after it approaches the Enterprise it balloons to an incredible and intimidating size that the ship's sensors can't measure effectively. The creative staff had even better surprises waiting for the viewer at the end of the episode when Balok is finally unveiled.
During a star charting mission the Enterprise encounters a brilliantly colored cube rotating in space, impenetrable to the ship's sensors. At first it appears benign, completely harmless; later, when they try to move around it, it blocks their path and out of necessity they destroy the cube. Shortly afterwards an alien ship appears condemning the ship and it's crew to imminent destruction. With only a reprieve of ten minutes Kirk must either find a way to successfully negotiate their release or invent a clever means of escape.
The idea of the stray cube in space is a great concept, and would automatically cause the ship's scientists to assume an intelligent designer must be responsible for its being there. It recalls the Arthur C. Clarke short story 'The Sentinel' that gave rise to the movie '2001: A Space Odyssey', but in storytelling structure the episode resembles a quality more commonly found in the works of Ray Bradbury. This was the first appearance of DeForest Kelley as Dr. Leonard McCoy and his characteristic sense of humanity and his natural diligence to it comes into play right away. He defends the uptight and nervous navigator Lt. Bailey, marvelously characterized by Anthony Hall. Ted Cassidy provides the voice for Balok throughout much of the episode and it is most effective; he was also well cast as the android Ruk in the episode 'What Are Little Girls Made Of?' The final revelation in the show's finale is one of the most extraordinary in the entire ongoing Trek television series.
Some final notes: The juxtaposition of these two shows merits a brief discussion. This was the first episode filmed after the second successful pilot but the tenth show to televise in the series. It was said that the show was ""too cerebral"" so the character of Captain Kirk was 'dumbed down' a bit and shown to be a man of action in the second pilot. Suddenly in the next episode Kirk ignores any options to fight their enemy - and even chastises crewmembers that do! He wants to think his way out of this one. Naturally if he chooses to fight he stands little to no chance of winning, but the writers chose to place Kirk and his crew in this predicament so he would react this way. Apparently the studio heads were of little concern already. On the lighter side...early in the show Kirk casually strolls through the Enterprise corridors on his way to his quarters bare-chested and sweaty with his shirt hanging around his neck much like a preppie would carry his/her sweater. Is this really acceptable behavior from a superior officer?",1043971200,,5778,4.927179487179488
228650,3,6300213501,"Once again, a fine special edition has been released for these venerable Star Trek movies.  In this film, the crew heads off to the newly-formed Genesis planet in the stolen Enterprise.  They meet up with Klingons newly arrived to try and steal the secret of the Genesis Device, which they call the ""Greatest weapon ever invented.""  This film is clearly more light-hearted than TMP or TWOK, the previous two films in the franchise, and introduced the plot device of sending each crewmember off on their own mission before pulling them back together.  As such, we see more of Sulu, Uhura, and Scotty than we are used to, which adds rather than detracts from the story.  Another highlight is the scene-chewing performance of Christopher Lloyd as the Klingon commander, in perfect opposition to William Shatner.
Unfortunately, the film tends to be repetative.  It starts off with a flashback to Wrath of Khan to bring the audience up-to-date.  That's fine, but these moments are relived again when Sarek visits Kirk 20 minutes in, and YET AGAIN at the end of the film.  Thus, this 100-minute movie only contains 80 minutes of new material, and repeated watchings tend to leave you fidgiting.  In addition, the sound-stage sets of the Genesis Planet (and Vulcan) are impressive, but not the same as actual location footage.  However, it's a worthy addition to the Star Trek family, it simply suffers in comparison to the two movies on either side of it.
Likewise, this special edition is good, but not as good as those for TMP and TWOK.  The highlights are the text commentary by the Okudas, a featurette (25 minutes) on the development of the Klingon language, and the ILM featurette on the effects.  The general making-of feature is interesting (Shatner is amusing in a faux-pompous way), but is mostly a repitition of the audio commentary.  The print is curiously grainy, in contrast to the obviously cleaned-up DVD versions of the previous 2 films.",1043193600,6,1948,4.920489296636085
228674,3,6300213501,"'The Lights Of Zetar' is an episode that plays by it's own rules and the result is one of the poorest efforts of the original series.  The story was written by Shari Lewis, of ""Lamb Chop"" fame, and her husband Jeremy Tarcher, with the thought that she would be the female lead.  Thank goodness clearer heads prevailed!  The idea of a conscious body of interstellar beings traveling the galaxy looking for an escape from their incorporeal state isn't really a bad concept at all.  It's the way that they are defeated that's the problem here.
In the beginning we are introduced to Lt. Mira Romaine who the Enterprise is taking to Memory Alpha, an immense library sanctioned by the Federation and open to all.  The starship encounters an unusual phenomenon just before reaching their destination.  It appears onscreen as a multi-colored cloud that gives no discernible readings when scanned.  It soon penetrates the hull and disables the crew in various ways; the cloud assaults Lt. Romaine momentarily and later she has what she believes is a disturbing premonition concerning the Memory Alpha facility.  Within time the true identity of the mysterious cloud is discovered - and the crew also learns that Lt. Romaine has been chosen by them to fulfill a sinister and costly purpose.
What really hurts this episode is that Kirk, Spock and McCoy devise a way to defeat the Zetars that isn't quite plausible.  How will this method defeat the beings?  While you are watching this keep in mind they penetrated the ship's hull with no problems in the beginning of the show and also they have existed in zero gravity for millennia.  I'm going to guess that the episode may have had an earlier solution that wasn't practical in view of budget concerns; this ending was written as a substitute and was certainly easy for the special effects crew to pull off.  The result: It Stinks!  Any reasonably educated person isn't going to buy this explanation as presented.  The romance between Scotty and Lt. Romaine is a limp-legged plot element as well and it only gets in the way of the story, bogging it down with sappy and unlikely dialogue from the normally levelheaded engineer.
'The Cloud Minders' fares much better and introduces the city of Stratos that floats on a cloud, one of the most memorable fantasy elements created by Star Trek.  Upon arrival Spock meets an attractive and intelligent woman whose beauty so impresses him that he gives brief consideration to a romance.  But as you might have guessed something ""sours"" the milk for the first officer.
The Enterprise goes to the planet of Ardana to pick up a shipment of zenite, the antidote to an epidemic that has struck a Federation planet's vegetation and may destroy it all.  On the surface of Ardana Kirk and Spock are attacked by terrorists known as Disrupters; they are rescued within seconds by the ruler of Stratos, Plasus, who has come to the surface with two guards.  Returning to Stratos with Plasus, Kirk and Spock receive the explanation that the miners who live on the surface of Ardana are rebelling against their superior counterparts who live in the city of Stratos.  Kirk and Spock see the clear distinction between the classes of citizens and attempt to negotiate an understanding of their differences, running afoul of both of the warring parties, leading to several complications.
The mutual attraction between Droxine and Spock develops nicely; their conversations are believable and revealing, adding necessary insight to the two cultures depicted here.  Kirk takes the dire matters into his hands breaking all rules of diplomacy and shooting from the hip.  It's hard to believe that the Federation would tolerate Kirk's actions in this case despite the severity of the situation.  Apparently the creators of Trek realized this as you'll note by the final line of dialogue between Plasus and Kirk.  Another unintentional comical moment happens when the elegant and refined Droxine tells Spock that she will go to the surface to work in the mines.  Yeah, right!  She wouldn't last 30 seconds in the completely foreign and harsh environment of the underground caverns.  Obviously she wishes to continue to further impress the intrepid Mr. Spock.",1042243200,,4216,4.953125

228677,4,6300213501,"STAR TREK III: The Search For Spock is almost as good as THE WRATH OF KHAN and THE VOYAGE HOME, but it has its own strengths working for it. It is indeed an essential part of the Trek phenomenon, and there is a bit of action and human essence in this movie.
The Enterprise crew is headed for the starbase battered from the raging battle with Khan, that resulted in the birth of the Genesis Planet. When Kirk and crew finally arrive and the Enterprise is due to be decommissioned, Kirk and a few crew members (Scotty, McCoy, Chekhov, and Sulu) highjack the Enterprise and race to the Genesis Planet after they learn McCoy is carrying the soul of Spock, and Spock is alive, aging rapidly like the planet that rebirthed him...but essentially, has none of his marbles which McCoy possesses. When the Enterprise encounters the Klingons and Commander Kruge, it results in the untimely destruction of the Enterprise. Down on the Genesis planet, Kirk and crew find Spock and Valeris, but David, Kirk's estranged son, is dead. After ridding themselves of Kruge, Kirk highjacks the Klingon vessel to get to Vulcan, where Spock and McCoy are put back to their rightful places.
Overall, The Search For Spock is an enjoyable edition to the Trek adventures with Leonard Nimoy's directorial talents to go even further with Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. Star Trek III is essentially satisfying and would be a welcome addition to your Trek collection, no matter what kind of Trekkie you are.",1040601600,,1475,4.765625
228678,4,6300213501,"With the death of Spock at the end of the last picture, and his funeral in the Mutara Nebula, now quickly forming a planet in the wake of the Genesis device, an enormous chapter in the Star Trek Universe has ended. . . Or has it?  The movie pits the crew of the Enterprise verses a rather rowdy group of Klingons, bent of obtaining information from the Genesis Project, which the Klingons see as the ultimate doomsday weapon, and against Starfleet, unwilling to let Kirk go back to Genesis to recover the body of his lifelong friend.  And to top it all off, Dr. McCoy seems to be losing his faculties, when it is realized that he is the unknowing carrier of Spock's soul.
This movie is pretty good.  Christopher Lloyd was a pretty good, rather pale, Klingon.  The crew of the Enterprise has always been a tight-knit group, but their utter dedication to one another is paramount in this film.  They are willing to fight and die for one another.
Robin Curtis takes over the role of Lieutenant Savak, played previously by Kirstie Alley.  It is an improvement in my eyes.  Ms. Alley was good, but not quite ""Vulcan"" enough for me.  A great deal happens in this film that shapes the course of Star Trek films to come, it is definitely needed to understand how the events at the beginning of Star Trek IV.
Leonard Nimoy sat in the directors chair for ""The Search For Spock.""  It was strange not to see Spock as a main role along Kirk, Mccoy, and Scotty.  But, the movie is good, and fun to watch.

The movie picks up where Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn left off. Spock has died, or has he? The movie is the race to get Spock's mind back to his body. There is a dangerous planet that is evolving as Spock is but the end of this Genesis planet evolution is its destruction. The cost of saving Spock's life is the price of the Starship Enterprise itself. Nimoy did  a fantastic job creating a broad opera with heart and soul and some real moments of friendship and loyalty. DeForest Kelly (Gunfight At The OK Corral) really steps up to bat with his performance and humor as the doctor with Spock in his head.
The movie has drama, action, space battles and most importantly - humor. William Shatner (Showtime, Miss Congeniality) has some very special moments of Star Trek lore in this movie. Each of the supporting cast even have their moments in the limelight. Nichelle Nichols (Snow Dogs, Porgy And Bess) shines with Mr. Adventure and James Doohan (The Duke, Load Weapon 1), really shows what a crafty engineer can really do. This film also introduces Robin Curtis (Ghost Story, Making Contact) as Saavik (originally played by Kirstie Alley (Cheers) in Star Trek II as the Vulcan science officer assigned to investigate the newly formed Genesis planet with the late Merrit Buttrick (Zapped, Stagecoach) as Dr. Marcus.
The most outstanding performance however goes to Christopher Lloyd (Back To The Future, Taxi) as the Klingon commander Kruge. His energy and excitement and evil nature in the role made a great nemesis for Admiral James T. Kirk. Watching the two of them fight is amazing.
The DVD extras include a great commentary by Nimoy and crew as well as several behind the scenes featurettes with great footage of the film as it was being shot. Also there is a great docudrama about the exploration and planet terraforming of Mars ad other planets. What real space science is capbable of and shooting toward. A very educational piece.

228704,4,6300213501,"Though lacking the philosophical depth of The Motion Picture, and the heart-pounding action of The Wrath of Khan, Star Trek III: The Search for Spock ultimately succeeds because it's primarily a character driven story, which recalls the best episodes of the original series. Spock's resurrection is handled convincingly--no magical regeneration with a shiny blue animated line here. In all aspects, Leonard Nimoy does a fine job in his directorial debut--he can clearly handle a camera and brings forth strong performances from his actors.  Robin Curtis more than holds her own in the role of Lt. Saavik, originally portrayed by Kirstie Alley.  The consistently underrated William Shatner shines here, giving a performance which is by turns somber and impassioned.  DeForest Kelley also deserves praise as the Spock-possessed McCoy.
Most of the special effects have held up well over the years, and the few that haven't are not overly distracting. Star Trek has never been beholden to special effects, but has generally relied upon character development and story--and this emphasis has served it well over the years.
The picture is identical to the first DVD issue, which improved on both the VHS and Laser Disc issues--the colors are more vibrant and crisper. The sound also has more impact than the earlier versions.
This is one of the few films where the theatrical cut WAS the director's cut, so there are no added scenes here.  The commentary by Nimoy and the rest is interesting and informative, as is Michael Okuda's text commentary.  The cast interviews, as always, are entertaining, although I would have liked to have heard more of what REALLY happened during the infamous 1983 fire at Paramount studios.  Less entertaining are the featurettes on terraforming, the Klingon language, and the visual effects, which contain almost no behind the scenes footage.",1037836800,19,1868,5.230769230769231

228706,4,6300213501,"This is another great Trek pairing.
""A Private Little War"" is Trek's take on what was then our expanding participation in Viet Nam.  Here, Kirk and crew journey to an idyllic Eden of a world populated by noble nomads and settled villagers and, unfortunately for everybody, fair game for the Klingon empire.  Though barely on the edge of the industrial revolution, villagers are now armed with flintlocks, and have engaged in a genocidal war against the nomads -a noble band led by the heroic Tyree.  A close friend of Kirk's on his last sojourn their, Tyree allows Kirk to hide within his tribe while he and McCoy investigate Klingon backing of the villagers.  Spock is unluckily struck by one of the primitive flintlocks and spends much of the episode in the Enterprise's ICU.  Down below, between ducking Klingon's, Kirk and McCoy bitterly debate the morality of bringing the tribes into technological parity with the villagers, with Kirk in favor of giving Tyree's people a fighting chance, and McCoy arguing how that would only prolong a bloody and suicidal war (almost a completely win-win situation for the Klingons).
This was a great episode, deftly referring both to Viet Nam and treatment of indigenous tribes in 19th century America.  McCoy especially shines in his moments arguing with the Captain, while the script gives Kirk the coldly logical position normally reserved for Spock (it would probably have been too cold; perhaps that's why they had him shot down in the opening scene).  Also look for 1960's TV fixture Nancy Kovack as Nona, Tyree's bewitching wife.  Kovack had a recurring role as Darrin Steven's former flame on ""Bewitched"", exposing her to all sorts of nose-twitching witchcraft.  As Nona, a ""Kunutu"" woman, she now gets to cast the spells.
""Gamesters of Triskelion"" is perfectly campy Trek, with Kirk, Uhura and Chekov kidnapped during transport by a highly advanced race of beings (is there any other kind?) called ""Providers"" who force Kirk and crew to battle in mortal combat with other kidnapped aliens (one of them, a beautiful humanoid who's wicked in the ring).  You'd think the Providers would have long tired of the repetitious gaming (they bet using ""quatloos"", but you never see one) and would have long settled on developing the slaves to try living normal lives as a more amusing form of entertainment.  ""Gamesters"" is campy trek, using interior sets (even for outdoor scenes) and featuring Shatner in full ""lounge mode"" as he courts his fellow prisoner.  One caveat though, this episode features a moment in which Uhura is assaulted just out of camera shot.  It's very suggestive, but by the end of the episode, there's just about no closure.  It was perhaps a bit too campy for its own good.",1037059200,,2738,4.949781659388647

228708,3,6300213501,"Volume 27 of The Star Trek DVD series contains two of the second season's typical plots. Both episodes are watchable and entertaining However neither of these episodes are not the most successful variations of these blueprint plots.
THE ULTIMATE COMPUTER is one of those man v.s. machine episodes of Star Trek. Only this time Kirk must sit and watch the Enterprise be contolled by a computer called the M-5 rather than his crew. At first the M-5 seems as flawless as it's creator Daystrom says. Of course the computer goes haywire and begins destroying Starfleet ships. Sure this episode is written ok and all but we've seen this a thousand times before and it's been done better. Still this episode's story is entertaining and worth at least one watch but it is at best a standard Star Trek episode.
THE OMEGA GLORY follows a similar pattern as THE ULTIMATE COMPUTER. This is a typical second season Star Trek episode but it is by far one of the worst varaitions of the whole ""journey to an unknown planet run by a cruel race or empire"" plots. In a somewhat patriotic episode where the planet is run by Comms (chinese communists) led by a insane Starfleet Captain (Morgan Woodward from DAGGER OF THE MIND). When the Comms are excuting violent slaves called Yanks (as in Yankee) this episode gets a little far fetched. A few suprises here and there, but other than that THE OMEGA GLORY is a below average episode of Star Trek in my opinion. Partly because it's story is pretty far fetched and disappointing in the end. Also because this plot has been done to death in Star Trek and far better other times.
Overall a decent collection of standard Star Trek shows. There is really nothing super special here but if you love classic Trek then you probably will want to get this DVD. Mildly recommended.",1036540800,,1799,4.660377358490566
228709,4,6300213501,"When it was first released in 1984, ""The Search For Spock"" was hailed as the best of the Star Trek movies to date--there was no ""odds are bad, evens are good"" rule, and instead it seemed like each new film was going to outstrip the last.  However, with the passage of years and the development of the ""odds/evens""
rule (no doubt helped by the release of V, ""Generations"" and ""Insurrection""), ""The Search For Spock"" was retroactively downgraded as an iffy venture, with some good points but also a fair number of items that could be improved.  Fans now complain about the ripping off of the ""Star Wars"" bar scene, Robin Curtis' portrayal of Saavik, the wimpiness and annoying nature of all the other Starfleet captains, and the contrivances surrounding the destruction of the Enterprise (all that to take out six lousy Klingons?  Kirk had defeated much greater odds before).
However, whatever weak points the film may have, the strong points far outweigh them.  ""Star Trek III"" was a successful combination of the big ideas and emotional complexities of the first film and the tight paced action of the second, wrapped around a compelling story.  There are delightful references to TOS lore scattered throughout (tribbles, the self-destruct code, Rand's cameo, Sarek's spectacular reappearance and the scenes on Vulcan), and each of the supporting cast get their own special moment, far more than they had in either of the first two films.
The film's humor looks forward to ""Star Trek IV"" and Nimoy has a lightness in his directorial touch that feels like the soul of the series has returned.  However, it is the angle on the Kirk/Spock/McCoy triad which makes this film so special.  McCoy's performance as the tortured McCoy is top-notch, and that Kirk would sacrifice everything to save his best friends provides for character development and some truly epic themes (a twist on the ""needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few"" line from Star Trek II). The destruction of the Enterprise may be contrived, as is Spock's convenient adult age when dragged off of the Genesis planet, but in a sense these ""contrivances"" seem necessary to emphasize the lengths Kirk was forced to go this time, and the mystical nature of the plot.  The scenes on Genesis and on Vulcan are incredibly beautiful; the DVD brings out the picture and sound in these scenes immeasurably.
The Special Edition does not change anything in the original movie (no director's cut or deleted scenes), but the special features on disc two are adequate, including a trailor for the new ST film ""Nemesis"" and a great ""Captain's Log"" documentary on the making of the film, with Shatner providing choice interview moments.  OK, so no-one (sans die-hard fanatics) really cares about learning Klingon, but I feel satisfied with what I have.  ""The Search For Spock"" does not need to be improved by new edits, SFX or added scenes; its only weak points (such as the out-of-character Starfleet captains) are faults from the original script.",1036368000,,2999,4.932539682539683
228710,2,6300213501,"Star Trek III is definitely one of my favorite of the films. Thus, why the director's edition earned at least 2 stars with me.
Why DIDN'T it earn a good 4 or 5 stars? Simple. I felt ripped off slightly because I expected Paramount and Mr. Nimoy to give us something other than the same old thing. I felt almost the same way about Star Trek: TMP Director's Edition. It, however, had more content than this. I went and shelled another (...) to Paramount to witness these things??? :
NO improvement in the sound
NO deleted scenes
NO Special Effects enhancement or sound enhancements
Add to that same old movie I ALREADY OWNED on DVD and give me a couple of ridiculously unsatisfying features including a commentary which lasted about 25 minutes, and you have the gist of my disappointment. I could have done without the small ""making of"" segment, which was extremely inadequate, and the other window dressing segments that accompanied it. ""How to speak Klingon."" PUHHH LEASE!!! Does Paramount think that all Star Trek fans are children??
The Disappointment and the let down really drove this possible 4 or 5 down to a 2. Wake up, Paramount. Give us MORE for the hard earned money we shell out to you!",1035504000,2,1197,4.650943396226415
228711,5,6300213501,"Describing this movie is pointless - every Star Trek fan in existence has seen it countless times.  The reason to buy the 2-disc DVD are the Special Features that are located on it.  ""Captain's Log"" has recent interviews with William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Christopher Lloyd, and Robin Curtis.  It also offers a look back on the film from it's inception to the premiere.  ""Star Trek Universe"" has interviews with the designers and model makers of the space dock and Bird of Prey that are seen in the film.  It has Marc Okrand (a linguist) talking about how he created the Klingon and Vulcan languages.  ""Terraforming and The Prime Directive"" features NASA scientist Dr. Louis Friedman discussing the Genesis device and the Genesis planet and how we are now in the infant stage of the real thing as plans for making Mars habitable are underway.  ""Archives"" has many photos taken during filming of the movie, and the storyboards.  There are other features on this DVD such as commentaries, the creation of Klingon and Vulcan costumes and jewelry and the theatrical trailer.
I love this movie and never get tired of watching it.  My two favorite scenes both involve Enterprise; first when the ship is coming into space dock showing her battle scars and second when Enterprise is destroyed.  Sometimes I think Enterprise is the real star of this movie.  I already had Search For Spock but when the 2-disc DVD came out, I simply had to have it.  It is a must have for the Star Trek fan!  The interviews with the stars are very enlightening and entertaining and the ""look back"" is very interesting; I learned many things I didn't know.  The designers and model makers talking about special effects and how everything was made is wonderful, and although I can't speak Klingon or Vulcan, Marc Okrand discussing the languages had me in awe.  (How can anyone CREATE a language?)  Dr. Friedman discussing the greenhouse effect NASA will be creating on Mars and comparing it to the Genesis planet was very educational.
If you are a true Star Trek fan, you will buy this DVD!  It is a must have!  As Spock would say, ""Fascinating.""",1035504000,3,2119,4.758904109589041
228712,4,6300213501,"This is the odd-numbered Trek film with the unfairest rap for being part of the odd-numbered ""curse"" of Trek films (the even-numbered ones are all good, the odd-numbered ones are all bad).
""The Motion Picture"" was epic, but wrong for Trek. ""Khan"" was fun and had a lot of dazzling visuals, but it too seemed to be ""off"" just a hair. The fourth film was funny, but not at all what it could've (or should've) been. The fifth film had excellent bookends, with a disasterous and dopey story in between, and the sixth was good, but too far out there. While ""Khan"" had the Trek-style action sequences down, and is generally viewed as the best Trek movie, this one gives ""Khan"" a run for it's money in all other areas. Overall, like it or not, ""The Search for Spock"" really is the best Trek film, the film that is more in touch with Trek than any of the others.
Some of the bad rap against the movie is justified, but not all of it. After all, the film is kind of a downer, throwing some majorly bad juju at Kirk. Enterprise is to be scrapped. Kirk can't get a ship so he can help Spock and McCoy. Kirk has to go against orders and his career is finished. David. The destruction of the Enterprise. Not as much fun as the ""Khan"" film. Not as bland as ""The Motion Picture"".
Probably the biggest plot hole here is when Kruge kills off his lover because she has seen the Genesis tape, and then later he shows it to his underlings anyway. Of course, it made him look all the more ruthless, but it was also kind of dumb.
Right up there with that plot hole has to be the destruction of the Enterprise, as spectacular as it was. Even after twenty years, I've never been able to believe that Scotty couldn't fix the automation circuit, or Checkov couldn't have run down to the phaser control room to manually blast the bad guys. Still, the last moments of the famous starship are great.
Despite having the reputation for confirming the ""curse"" of the odd-numbered Trek films, there really are some awesome moments in this one. Saavik's berating David for using proto-matter, Kirk stumbling in grief and rising right back up again, the dead silence when Kirk and Spock meet again, with Kirk saying, ""You would've done the same for me.""
This is a really good film, and Nimoy handles the direction with polish and finnese. While it is true that the film was a bit darker than the preceeding two Trek movies, and not as much of a fun actioner as ""Khan"", they also got a lot of things right. You can tell this is true because, unlike the first two Trek releases on these collector's DVDs, ""Star Trek III"" has no re-editing, cut segments restored, or extended scenes in evidence. While a bit disappointing not to see extra footage or whatnot, it really is satisfying to know that this film simply didn't need reworking to make it better. I think that this is due mostly to Nimoy's input on the film. Nimoy is an ""old-school"" actor, versed in the classics and great literature, and his intellegence shows clearly in both his directing and his comments.
The extras on the new DVD are absolutely stellar, better that the extras on the ""Khan"" disc, and far better than the extras on the ""Motion Picture"" offering. There is a 30 minute discussion on terraforming that is very interesting. Besides going into the technical aspects of terraforming, one of the interviewees discusses the differing views of both Trek 2 and Trek 3 regarding the morality of ""playing God"". The commentary track, a mix of Nimoy, Bennett, Curtis and others, is intellegent and informative.
This is an excellent movie, and an excellent Trek.",1035244800,3,3589,4.557275541795666
228713,5,6300213501,"Volume 25 of the Star Trek DVD collection has two great episodes from the second season.  Although season 1 of Star Trek was far more diverse and fresh, season 2 just happend to spawn some of the series most classic and memorable episodes.  This DVD contains just two of these great episodes.
A PIECE OF THE ACTION may very well be one of the top five most popular episodes of the original series.  The Enterpirse crew arrives at Sigma Iotia II to find a civilization similar to the Chicago Mobs of the 1920's.  The planet itself has been divided by gang wars and Kirk feels he must reunite the planet so it can have good relation with the Federation.  Kirk resorts to him and Mr. Spock donning mobster gear and talking in slang which leads to A PIECE OF THE ACTION being one of the funniest Star Trek episodes.  The episode itslef is quite good and very entertaining especially Kirk driving the old jalopy, the card game and Spock acting like a gangster.  However the episode wraps up unevenly and it really makes you think: Kirk completely disobeyed the Prime Directive in this episode! However this episode doesn't fail to please and the end left this plot open for a sequel.  Unfortunetly it has never been produced.  A PIECE OF THE ACTION is an excellent episode of Star Trek though.
BY ANY OTHER NAME may be one of the strangest episodes of Star Trek ever!  Kirk and the crew are abducted by Kelvans who take on a human form.  The Kelvans demand control of The Enterprise so they can take a voyage to find a planet suitable for colonzation since there own ship was destroyed.  The Kelvans are so ruthless they even go to the extent to killing an innocent enterprise crew member to get what they want.  This makes BY ANY OTHER NAME seems like a serious episode that is until the crew discovers the Kelvans weakness: human sense and emotion.  This results in Kirk flirting with the beautiful Kelinda, Spock making Rojan feel jealousy, and Scotty getting himself and another Kelvan drunk.  This results in BY ANY OTHER NAME to be a comical episode of Star Trek but it's strange how the mood changes.  The first half hour is somewhat dark whereas the second half hour is bright and funny.  The episode ends with The Kelvans making peace with the Federation even after the death of a crewmate.  BY ANY OTHER NAME is an uneven but above average episode of Star Trek.
In conclusion I highly recommend this DVD for it does have twoo great episodes.  The picture and quality are fine too!  Highly recommended!",1035072000,3,2506,4.563758389261745
228734,5,6300213501,"I haven't yet bought the DVD version of this fine movie, but I have watched the VHS version until my copies have all been reduced to tatters. One thing I haven't read in other reveiwers' comments is that this is the ultimate Star Trek movies' take on love. Mr. Nimoy's perspective on the freindship and love our heroes deal with during these trying events is exactly the reason I've spent thirty six years being addicted to Star Trek. If you wouldn't sacrifice everything for the people you care about, then what are they (and you) worth? Once again, James Kirk has shown us a proper path to justified existence. It's not about a battle, or a threat to human existence. It's all about the people we care about, and what we are willing to do (and lose) to keep them safe. I love this movie more than any of the other ""classic"" Trek films, because it is the most human of them all. Every time I watch it, I feel reaffirmed in my dedication to compassion, love, and loyalty. Mr. Nimoy deserves great credit for his work, as does Mr. Bennet.

228735,5,6300213501,"Two of Star Trek's second season episodes that are quite memorable appear on the Volume 23 of this DVD collection.  One tackles a huge issue of the 60's while the other is just a classic Star Trek episode.
A PRIVATE LITTLE WAR obviously attacks the Vietnam War issue that plagued the world at the time (the late 60's).  This had been attempted to a lesser extent in the earlier episode FRIDAY'S CHILD.  However A PRIVATE LITTLE WAR is far more successful at getting the message across.  Kirk and McCoy arrive at a peaceful primitive planet which Kirk had visited years earlier.  However upon their arrival they find the planet has been divided and they're using flintlocks.  As it turns out the Klingons have been supplying villagers with weapons to kill tribesmen.  One of these tribesmen is Tyree a good friend of Kirk's from years earlier.  As Kirk tries to help he realizes that he is violating the prime directive.  And in the end the peaceful Tyree even falls into the hatred and bloodshed when his manipulative wife Nona is murdered by villagers.  This episode ends on a real down note.  For it is extremely tragic what happens to this peaceful planet because of the Federation and Klingons.  It really relates to the Vietnam war when you think about it.  This episode is one of the more serious Star Trek outings however the Mugatu ape beast is somewhat cheesy looking and so this episode does have a few funny moments.  There is a great lesson to be learned from A PRIVATE LITTLE WAR but it's never been a personal favourite of mine.  It is a good episode though.
The other one here is the classic GAMESTERS OF TRISKELION.  I am greatly suprised at the amount of negative reviews for this episode however.  I always found this to be one of Star Trek's finest and a true classic.  Kirk, Chekov, and Uhura are abducted by superior beings and forced to fight ""drill thralls"" in a gladiator like fashion.  The superior beings (known as the Providers) end up being talking brains that bid over these gladiator battles.  This episode has tons of colourful characters including a beautiful green haired humanoid named Shahna whom Kirk falls in love with (kinda predictible huh?).  Meanwhile Spock and the Enterprise crew search for the missing crew members until they are captured when they find them.  The episode ends in Kirk making a bet with the providers if he can defeat three drill thralls the providers will let everyone go free and Kirk and his crew may return to the Enterprise and if he fails the entire Enterprise crew will be forced to become part of these gladiator games.  I dunno if that was the best bet for Cpt. Kirk to make but he was successful and thats what's important.  I have always loved this episode it is a classic.  It is a typical 'superior beings play with inferior beings' episode but the gladiator fight scenes have to be watched!  It's memorable!
Overall I highly recommend Volume 23.  It has two great episodes from Star Trek's second season, one tragic and one classic but both are great.  Highly recommended!",1033776000,2,3047,4.687382297551789

The scope of the movie is about the same as Wraith of Khan but it really turns inward and deep to expand on the final moments of Kirk and Spock in the death seen of STII. I like the emotion and depth of this movie.
I cannot write a review of this movie without commenting on the music. Jerry Goldsmith out-did himself with the first movie and James Horner had a difficult task to add-to and change the music enough to be unique but fit well with the series. Personally I love the themes of STII but I really didn't think they were fleshed out as well as they could have been. Mr. Horner got it right in STIII. STI and STIII really standout to me as great movie music. I think it really helped Mr. Horner to have another movie to expand on what he had done previously. It seems the music matured with story. The motif of the Mind Meld between Sarak and Kirk is mesmorizing. The percussion used for the Klingon themes is so powerful.

228743,3,6300213501,"These DVD's normally pair episodes with some deep shared meaning - in this one, the idea is that peoples of past eras are largely ignorant and prone to find superstitious answers to solve life's msyteries  (In ""Trek"" lore, the inhabitants of the future are the technologically and ethically advanced descendants of savage and greedy fools - us).
In ""All Our Yesterdays"", the Enterprise comes across the planet Sarpeidon - home to an advanced civilization that appears to have disappeared.  Their planet about to be destroyed by a supernova, the Sarpeidons left no hint of their escape.  Instead, Kirk, McCoy and Spock find a huge library cataloguing thousands of generations of the planet's existence (the best of times, the worst of times).  Perusing, though not entirely understanding the significance of the library and its strange librarian, Mr. Atoz,  all three learn too late that the library is actually the navigation center of a huge time machine through which the Sarpeidons have escaped to the past.  Unwittingly leaping into one such portal, Kirk finds himself trapped in a pre-industrial era in which he is branded a witch by typically ignorant natives of the time.  Spock and McCoy have it worse - vanishing into the planet's ice age (an era kept on catalog for prisoners) where they meet the lovely Zarabeth (Mariette Hartley - later to return as a sexy Terranian in Roddenberry's short-lived ""Earth2"" series, and also immortalized in a generation of Polaroid commercials).  In Spock's case, the metaphor for time travel is reversed - Zarabeth is a caring and loving person, but Spock's journey to a time before his ancestors cast out their emotions and their meat-eating diet has caused him to become a passionate savage.  (McCoy, however, does not revert to the primitive state of pre-20th century country doctors).  Falling in love with Zarabeth - also a future Sarpeidon sent to the past as a prisoner - he is willing to do anything to remain in the past with her (a special safeguard ensures her death should she try to return to the present).  The episode was later sequelized in the novel ""Yesterday's Son"" in which Spock returns to Sarpeidon for the son born of his union with Zarabeth, and confronts another sign of his wild days - Sub Commander Tal from ""The Enterprise Incident"".
""The Savage Curtain"" was a more overt jab at those foolish primitives of our past - pitting the crew not only against simulacra of the evil past (barbarian warlord Genghis Khan, the warmongering Kahless who set the Klingon race into their bellicose ways, and Colonel Green, guilty of more recent crimes against humanity) but also against the naivete of our more noble ancestors - Abe Lincoln and the vulcan Surak.  Trapped on the world of Excalbia, the crew are subjects for that world's inhabitants to test the strength of good over evil.  Unsurprisingly, Lincoln and Surak aren't big on fighting at all, and are good's biggest liabilities.  The message of this episode is vague - is goodness stronger than evil because it does not measure itself according to strength?  Or perhaps the moral is that the lines between good and evil aren't so clear -but that was handled better in the episode ""Errand of Mercy"" in which both Humans and Klingons are kept from warring against each other by godlike Organians who play no favorites.  (Unsurprisingly, the Organians and Excalbians would meet years later in DC Comics's ""Star Trek"" monthly, in an issue titled ""Errand of War"".)

""That Which Survives"" suffers from terrible cheapness, though it benefits from an interesting performance by Lee Meriwether as the image of the last surviving member of a long-dead alien race, Losira, who is now nothing more than a computerized planetary defense system...for an entirely extinct race, that can no longer benefit from it.  Losira begins appearing and disappearing aboard the Enterprise, killing various crew members and performing acts of sabotage.  Kirk and Crew go on an alien hunt on the nearest planet, and there also encounter the strange woman, whom they correctly surmise is some sort of lethal hologram.  The story hasn't got much plot, but it holds your attention, and Lee Meriwether was always first-rate eye-candy.

Lou Antonio and Frank Gorshin are the last surviving members of two severely prejudicial races living on the planet Charon, their polarized attitudes evident even on their very bodies:  one is white on the right side and black on the left, the other black on the right side and white on the left.  Antonio's race is the oppressed proletariat class, Gorshin's the decadent bourgeois  -  Antonio seeks asylum on board the Enterprise, and Gorshin, a Charonian policeman, demands his return for trial on several crimes.  The aliens begin infecting the Enterprise with their enflamed rhetoric, and prove to be utterly consumed by hatred of each other and ruthless in the extreme as to achieving their separate goals.
What's best in this episode are the performances of the two guest stars, the fiery Gorshin especially, and the all too memorable finale in which the perpetual antagonists deliberately throw themselves into eternal warfare rather than work out their differences  -  even once they know their home planet has completely destroyed itself in precisely the same useless conflict, and they, themselves, are its only surviving remnants.",1030233600,4,2017,5.232919254658385
228775,5,6300213501,"Both of these episodes share one thing in common:  they boldly went where no network program had gone before, in terms of ... bypassing the censors.  ""Wink of an Eye"" is the one in which comely Kathie Brown (the real-life Mrs. Darren McGavin) is seen brushing her hair beside William Shatner while Shatner sits on the edge of his bed pulling on his boot, and ""Plato's Stepchildren"" had T.V.'s first interracial kiss (William Shatner and Nichelle Nichols).  Neither of these things may seem like that big of a deal today, but in 1968, let me tell you...!
""Wink"" is an episode that makes little sense, but is thoroughly enjoyable.  The entire race of the planet Scalos seems to have disappeared, without explanation.  All that remains there is an occasional odd insect buzzing  -  which follows the landing party back to the Enterprise, after which Captain Kirk suddenly disappears from the bridge, in full view of the crew.  What's really happened to him is the same thing that happened to the Scalosians, several of whom are now on board  -  he's speeded-up a thousand times, now moving too fast to be detected by anyone not accelerated at the same rate.  Alien leader Kathie Brown, like all alien women, has taken a fancy to the charismatic Kirk, and intends to keep him with her after freezing the entire Enterprise crew and stealing his starship to move on to greener pastures.  Forgetting the built-in logic problem of how matter accelerated to such an impossible speed keeps from falling apart by intense friction, this is still a pretty good little story, fascinating to watch, and Kathie Brown is a knockout, in addition to being a decent actress.
""Plato's Stepchildren"" is a great episode, written by one of Outer Limits' best contributors, Meyer Dolinsky.  The Enterprise finds itself summoned to a previously believed to be uninhabited planet, populated by beautiful people affecting ancient Greek costume and architecture.  They call themselves Plato's Stepchildren, supposedly devoted to nothing but lofty philosophy  -  but in reality, they are telekinetic demigods, whose seeming immortality and incredible power has dragged them down into sadistic decadence.  Their power and immortality does have one terrible price  -  it makes them hemophiliacs, and their medical knowledge is dreadfully inadequate, so Dr. McCoy is commanded to remain behind with them.  When he refuses, Plato's Stepchildren force several of the Enterprise crew into cruelly degrading situations, and unleash the full force of their fury.
The story is great, and so are the scenery and the guest stars.  Liam Sullivan is the Caligula-like Parmin, head of the planet, with the always sexy Barbara Babcock as his aristocratically sadistic mate.  Best of all is famous dwarf actor Michael Dunn as the planet's whipping-boy, who helps the Enterprise defeat the evil Platonians.  Dunn  -  best known as Dr. Loveless in The Wild, Wild West  -  had a phenomenal singing voice, and usually got to use it in his numerous 1960s guest appearances, as he does here in fine style.",1030233600,4,3053,5.041916167664671

2. (SPOILER ALERT FOR THE THREE PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE) This movie contains two of the most entertaining happenings in the Star Trek universe -- the theft of the Enterprise and the destruction of the ship.
The new DVD will finally make the movie, rough on both widescreen VHS and the earlier DVD, look refreshed. The Search for Spock isn't the greatest voyage in the Trek universe, but it's a good ride and serves its purpose well. Recommended.",1029888000,,817,4.5646258503401365
228778,3,6300213501,"I suppose you could get sillier and more childishly simplistic than to find an unbelievable lava-rock monster pitting Abraham Lincoln against Genghis Khan on an arena planet (with Kirk and Spock aiding the centuries-dead ex-president) to see whether good is stronger than evil, but - come to think of it, no you couldn't.
That's ""The Savage Curtain,"" probably the worst-ever episode of the series.
""All Our Yesterdays"" is one of the best-ever.
Kirk, Spock and McCoy try to evacuate the inhabitants of a planet about to be devastated by a supernova, only to find that they've already found their own way out via the Atavachron, a time-machine that sends people back into the past, out of harm's way. Kindly Mr. Atoz (Ian Wolfe) and his numerous clones mistake the Enterprise personnel for people needing to be evacuated - so, Kirk soon finds himself accused of being a witch in a 17th century setting to which he is sent against his will, and Spock and McCoy are sent back to the planet's Ice Age. The sole human resident in that Ice Age is the fetching Zarabeth (Mariette Hartley), a sad and tragic forgotten prisoner who falls madly in love with Spock (and he with her) and will do anything to keep him with her - even if it's possible to send the misplaced pair back to the place from whence they came.
This is a great episode, owing largely to Hartley's moving performance as the doomed beauty, Zarabeth. Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley really shine in this story, McCoy going crazy and Spock succumbing to his atavistically violent Vulcan lusts. Shatner does pretty well too, but this is really Nimoy and Kelley's time to show what they've got.",1028419200,4,1650,4.7526132404181185
228779,3,6300213501,"""The Ultimate Computer"" is a so-so entry, with more to recommend it than not, and ""The Omega Glory"" is  -  frankly  -  laughably bad, one of the worst scripts seen in the entire series.
William Marshall is Dr. Daystrom, ""The Ultimate Computer""'s creator, whose title device is intended to replace an entire starship crew and fulfill all of their functions with far greater efficiency.  Unfortunately, Daystrom's genius comes largely from the fact that he was a social outcast, and the computer's mind is programmed directly from his own engrams.  The result:  something out of Stanley Kubrick's worst nightmare, with a dangerously schizoid personality and weaponry out the wazoo.  Commodore Wesley (Barry Russo), the commander of the lead starship engaged in war games with Daystrom's mad alter-ego, has to make a decision as to whether or not to terminate the homicidal hardware  -  and Kirk and Company, reduced to prisoners on board their own ship, have to find a way to help him, or they'll die with the killer computer.  Marshall is quite compelling in the role of the computer's creator, but the episode is otherwise fairly undistinguished.
""The Omega Glory"" is perhaps the most absurdly propagandistic script to have emerged in any medium during the Cold War.  Morgan Woodward gives a wonderfully intense performance as Captain Ronald Tracy, a Starfleet commander gone mad as the sole survivor of a plague that devastated his crew  -  Tracy accidentally gained immunity by taking up residence on the planet from which the plague originated, where he must now remain or die.  While there, Tracy discovers Starfleet's superior weaponry is worthwhile in establishing himself as a king among a primitive tribe called the Comms, who war with a neighboring tribe called the Yangs  -  who turn out to be direct Earth parallels of the ""Comm""unists and the ""Yang""kees, with the Yangs even saying the U.S. pledge of allegiance.  Spock is seen as the devil because his pointed ears look like Satan's in the Yang ""Sacred Book"" (yes, they also have our Bible).  Yeah, you don't have to say it  -  it's pretty stupid to me, too.",1028419200,,2121,4.96875
228780,4,6300213501,"OK, first of all, I'm not going to bore you with plot details because anybody who's a Trek fan has most probably seen it and know it.  Now then, here's where Star Trek III - Special Edition will have a special place in my heart for some time.
Back in the Christmas season of 1986, I got my first VCR along with 2 commericially recorded movies.  One of these movies was Star Trek III.  I requested it because I had missed it in the theaters and as Trek fans know, 1986 was the release year for Star Trek IV.  And since Star Trek II thru IV form what is commonly known by Trek fans as the ""Genesis Trilogy"", I had missed the middle movie, so I wanted to catch up.
Now then, fast forward to Christmas 2001.  I get my first DVD player.  One of the first movies I get is Star Trek: TMP - DE.  Now we have both Star Trek II - DE and Star Trek III - SE coming out relatively close together.  This year, 2002, has been a good year for Star Trek fans.  With the release of the full series of TNG and at least 2 of the movies in Special Editions.  And rumor has it that Star Trek IV - SE is already in production.  So if you're looking to buy the Trek films, hang tight and wait for the impending Special Edition versions.
I give the movie 4 stars because although it's a pretty entertaining movie, it's not one of the best Trek films.  However, the Special Edition version will probably bump that up to 5 stars with all the extras.",1028160000,,1422,4.075539568345324
228781,3,6300213501,"Star Trek had grown remarkably flaccid during its third season, the result of the production crew realizing that their diminished budget and weak new time slot had already all but spelled out the series' end.  The season had moments of rallying, putting forth some of the best scripts the show ever had  -  but the majority were pretty weak.  These two are of the latter category.
""The Cloud Minders"" is a pretty piece of fluff with nice sets, costumes and matte shots, a reasonably good cast, and a terribly trite ""socially progressive"" script that is just a cheap retread of the classic silent sci-fi film, Metropolis:  the title characters are effete socialites, whose wealth is derived entirely from the exploitation of a permanent mining underclass.  Can Captain Kirk demonstrate to them the ethical folly of their ways, before the end of the hour?  (What do you think?)  The episode does have Jeff Corey, who is never less than stellar, and a generous helping of eye-candy in the form of Diana Ewing and Charlotte Polite, one of whom has an entirely unconvincing romantic subplot with Mr. Spock.
""The Lights of Zetar"" fares little better, but is at least a serviceable semi-horror story, rather like a sci-fi version of The Exorcist.  Scotty's new love, Lieutenant Mira Romaine (Jan Shutan), becomes the target of a number of celestial space-lights that have already destroyed a planetary outpost.  The lights are the surviving personalities of the long-dead planet Zetar, seeking a host body in which to live.  Can the Enterprise find a way to exorcize the evil invading lights from poor Lieutenant Romaine, before the end of the hour?  (What do you think?)  Jan Shutan is pretty and genuinely likeable, but you have to pity poor James Doohan being saddled with yet another of Star Trek's third season absurd love-interest roles.
You could do worse than these two, but they're pretty unimpressive overall.",1028160000,,1912,4.9748427672955975
228782,5,6300213501,"Two of Trek's best early episodes, both dealing with encountering the unknown at the limits of man's former boundaries.
""Where No Man Has Gone Before"" was Trek's second pilot, the one that sold the series.  Captain Kirk's old friend Gary Mitchell (Gary Lockwood, pre-2001: A Space Odyssey) becomes infected by an energy field at the rim of the solar system, which the Enterprise discovers from a former lost ship's probe caused the destruction of that ship:  the field effects people with strong ESP abilities, heightening their powers and making them drunk with them.  Mitchell rapidly becomes a power-mad monster, similarly infecting fellow crewmate Sally Kellerman, and plans to run off with her to produce a race of ESPer gods who will one day rival humans.  Kirk has to stop him  -  but can he do it without Kellerman's help?  And without killing his old friend?
The actors are excellent, especially guest stars Lockwood and Kellerman.  Shatner gives one of his better performances, showing the star quality that made him what he was before he descended into a caricature of himself.  The production is terrific, the story managing to raise a few chills despite its hackneyed sci-fi plot.  Being the second pilot of the series, the costumes and makeups  -  especially Mr. Spock's  -  are jarringly different, but that adds to the illusion of reality when compared to later episodes since it denotes a natural evolution in the Star Trek universe.
""The Corbomite Maneuver"" is a great taut, suspenseful story, well-directed and -acted, bringing the Enterprise into contact with an alien probe that attempts to prevent their entry into its space.  Kirk orders it destroyed and proceeds, cueing the arrival of the alien probe's builders in the form of Balok, a scary, giant creature looking very much like a UFO Gray with Ted Cassidy's (The Addams Family's Lurch) intimidating voice, who coldly announces his intention to destroy the Enterprise as a hostile invader.  Kirk resorts to trickery to buy time in finding a way out of the mess he's gotten his ship into, and ultimately discovers much more about Balok's race and true intentions  -  which are not as hostile as they appear.
""Corbomite"" benefits from three great guest star performances:  Anthony Call as an inexperienced bridge officer who snaps under pressure, but whose sensitivity and innate abilities serve a higher diplomatic calling; Ted Cassidy's voice, which truly does contribute to a frightening alien presence; and child star Clint Howard, who has a surprise role (with a dubbed voice) which can't be discussed without giving away the game.  The alien ships are also quite impressive, the more so for their simplicity:  they are purely geometric shapes, but of great size and destructive power.
Great sci-fi, still worth watching after all these years.",1027900800,,2823,5.080260303687636
228783,4,6300213501,"Naturally, the Star Trek franchise wasn't going to let Spock simply rest in peace, so who better to bring Spock back to life than Leonard Nimoy himself.  Though a quality effort in every way, this has been a somewhat underappreciated Trek movie, perhaps because it had the simple misfortune to come right after the great Wrath of Khan.  Star Trek III does pale next to its predecessor, but so does every other Trek film.  Looked at on its own, The Search for Spock certainly meets every reasonable expectation.  Good humor, the first appearance of a Klingon cloaking device, strong action, the return of Sarek, a stirring subtext on loyalty and friendship, and the dramatic demise of both Kirk's son and the Starship Enterprise itself.  Not to mention Robin Curtis seamlessly stepping in as Saavik and the great Christopher Lloyd as Commander Kruge, the baddest Klingon ever.

228795,5,6300213501,"I only recently got into watching reruns of the Star Trek: the original series.  I am not a real trekkie at all though.  I don't like any other Star Trek series but the original and I would not be caught dead at a convention.  I simply like to watch the original series because it is a fun tv show to watch.  It generally had a well developed plot, colorful characters, and quite often was down right hilarious.  It's a true piece of good tv from the 60's.
The First episode here saved the series from never making it on the air.  WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE was the second pilot after NBC rejected THE CAGE (which never aired on tv).  A rough line up of the original crew appears here.  Capt. Kirk, Spock, Sulu and Scotty all appear here but Bones McCoy and the others would not appear until later in the series.  The episode finds the Enterprise travelling through a mysterious and infamous energy barrier.  As they travel through the bizarre barrier it begins to take affect on the ships crew particularily Kirk's good friend Lt. Gary Mitchell (Gary Lockwood) and Dr. Elizabeth Dehner (played by Sally Kellerman who later played Hotlips in the MASH movie).  Soon Mitchell becomes extraordinarily powerful and begins to influence Dehner.  Not long after that Spock tells Kirk that he will have to kill Mitchell in order to save the galaxy from utter destruction.  Kirk finds himself stuck between saving the galaxy and the trust of a friend.  Truly a dramatic episode especially for a pilot.
The second episode here is THE CORBOMITE MANUEVER.  This epsisode is famous because of the infamous face of Balok.  The Enterprise is travelling through unknown regions of space when they come across a bizarre cube like  alien space buoy.  When the ship's phasers destroy the object an alien ship named the Fesarius immidiately traps the Enterprise and it's crew.  After trying to reason with the skeleton alien named Balok who threatens the Enterprise that it will be destroyed, Kirk bluffs by making up ""the corbomite manuever"" story.  Balok believes Kirk and decided to tow the ship across space rather than destroy it.  The crew attempts to break free of the Fesarius' tractor beam and in the process disables the alien ship.  After they beam aboard the Fesarius they meet the true suprising form of Balok and make a new space ally.
The two episodes are classic but I agree with the majority of reviewers here.  2 episodes on one DVD!  Paramount could have easily released them season for season like the Next Generation rather than putting out 40 DVDS with onyly 2 episodes each.  Other than that I highly recommend this DVD if you like the Star Trek Original Series.",1023235200,4,2667,4.708423326133909
228796,4,6300213501,"Needless to say Leonard Nimoy's feature film directorial debut was supurb. A very techinical film - it has the gloomy tragic Shakespearean qualities to it that a good drama should. Deep, deep stuff.
Christopher Llod (Doc Brown of ""Back To The Future I, II, & III"") fame, is a brilliant villan. Evil and cunning - he thwarts Kikr many times.
Good does triumph over evil in this one, but there is a valuable cost as Kirk and cCrew find out. This is the detsruction of the original Enterprise (refurbished) and much more.
There is great comedy in this film too. Uhura gets an 'eager beaver', scotty stops up the plumbing and Sulu shows his prowess to being insulted.
Also the sets are interesting and fun to watch. you have gun fights and wrestling but most important is the concept of friendship.

But I will be the one to say that Leonard Nimoy did a fantastic follow-up to The Wrath Of Khan.  The Search For Spock may not have the great enemy, or the great space battles.  But, in the same light Back To The Future II was the perfect sequel to the first, The Search For Spock is the perfect sequel to TWOK.
James Horner's followup score is marvelous, focusing on a more slow paced film.  The abduction, and destruction, of the Enterprise (I cry almost every time) gives it its distinction.  The intro of the Excelsior, Grissom, and klingon Bird of Prey (along with the believable storyline which brings Spock back)  make this vehicle a worthwhile trip.  And yes, the entire crew CAN act.
As far as DVD quality goes, yes, it brings the overall quality of the original movie as I saw it in '83.  Yes, the trailer helps!  Yes, the score is great!  And if the movie itself isn't a good reason to get it, then the latter reasons should be.  It isn't TMP Director's Edition.  But, it ranks up there.",1021075200,5,1086,4.348258706467662
228798,4,6300213501,"Okay, so I missed the fact that both of these episodes include frequent Batman guest stars, but that was only because I was so overwhelmed with the emotional subtext of each episode.
By now, any Trekker can tell you that ""Let that be your last Battlefield"" was a thinly veiled cautionary story about racial violence.  Not playing obvious favorites between the two antagonists - the fugitive Lokei, and his pursuer, Bele (Frank Gorshin) - the script quickly boils down their anamosity to pure hate.  The script tosses in some references - Lokei's people were once held a tier below Bele's, but received less than sincere aid as redress; also we'd sympathize with Lokei who was running - but soon blurs them to assure us that nothing really compensates for their shared hatred.  In the end, Lokei and Bele return to their burned world - with the camera uncharacteristically bleeding in imagery of burned out cities.
In ""That Which Survives"", the landing party (this is classic Trek, man - there are no ""away teams"") beams down to a strangely undynamic world. Unfortunately, the planet is actually a spaceship with its own built-in security system - one capable of flinging the Enterprise across the sector and marooning the landing party.  The system also takes the form of Losira (Lee Meriwether), a the last of the race of aliens who built the planet.  Both the landing party and the crew back on the Enterprise piece together the clues to the nature of the artificial planet and the ghost image that can inflict a very real death on anybody it finds (by ""disrupting"" every cell of her victims with but a touch; I've seen this episode a million times and I still don't know what ""cellular disruption"" means, but I'm sure it's got to be pretty bad).  Yeah, this is another one of those episodes about an ancient or otherwise high-powered computer that achieves sentience (""ultimate computer"", ""Changeling"", ""Return of the Archons"", ""For the World is Hollow"") and the end is again a bit of comedown (Spock to the rescue with a phaser) but the script creates one of the series's more intriguing example of artificial intelligence - you keep thinking that she'll cry before she has to kill somebody.  The real Losira, the crew decides, must have been some woman.  Luckily in recreating her, the computer copied her too well.  (The same concept appears in the first Trek movie). Watch this trek, but make sure ypu've got something light and funny to back it up with Harry Mud or ""A Piece of the Action"".",1020643200,3,2498,4.7772621809744775

228800,3,6300213501,"Plato's Stepchildren has an intriguing set-up, but the episode simply goes way too far in silliness when Kirk and Spock are being forced to perform. Apparently this was necessary in order to fill up time, but it's an insult to the viewers and an example of how the creator's abused the endless possibilities idea of the future. It has interesting moments, though, but forget the infamous interracial kiss--it was forced and completely unemotional. In this episode, Nichelle Nichols is absolutely gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous in that classic gown, but she is outdone by the more stunning Barbara Babcock, who gives a wonderful performance here.
Wink of An Eye is also very intriguing, and superior to Plato's Stepchildren, but it bites off more than it can chew. The situation with hyperaccelerated existence and normal existence is very interesting and fun, but it is carelessly done, and the episode becomes more confusing than anything else. An average, but passable episode.",1016668800,3,977,5.229299363057325
228801,4,6300213501,"Another great pairing of classic episodes from the original Star Trek.  The first ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"" charts the disastrous first attempt of the USS Enterprise to cross a powerful energy barrier at the edge of the galaxy.  Nearing the galactic rim, the Enterprise encounters the flight recorder of another ship doomed in its own bid to leave the galaxy.  Cryptic shreds of the recorder indicate that, though crippled by the barrier, something else caused the ship's destruction.  Encountering the barrier itself, the Enterprise is nearly rendered dead in space.  Worse, two crewmen - Gary Mitchell (Gary Lockwood) and Liz Dehner (Sally Kellerman) - are struck down by the energy.  Mitchell is only temporarily phased, but burgeoning psychic powers and a newly cold demeanor clue the remaining crew that something is very wrong.  (Mitchell's eyes, turned into silvery orbs, is also a tip-off, but the crew's too busy repairing their ship to notice.  Hitting on a plan to maroon Mitchell (who seems to have been driven insane by his newfound power) on a remote Starfleet outpost, Kirk finds he must confront the monster who was once his trusted crewmate and best friend.
""No Man"" was a great episode for so many reasons.  Still bearing the show's original vision, it seems cold, but that only highlights the rigors of deep space exploration, somewhat lost when the show adapted he more light-colored pastels of the late 1960's.  (nothing more exemplified this than the smaller, louder, monotone and more functional bridge).  Though the stars haven't fully established their campier alter-egos, the script deftly highlights their relationships - especially the Kirk-Mitchell relationship.  (At one point, the two were equals, but Kirk exceled when it mattered and now he gives the orders).
The ""Corbomite Maneuver"" is also a classic.  Though the ominous Blalok made a single appearance on the show, his initial image was unforgettable (having it in the closing credits couldn't hurt).  In this episode, the Enterprise is forced to destroy a cube-like probe emitting harmful radiation, and then forced to confront the probe's creators - the hitherto unknown ""First Federation"".  With his ship dwarfed by the First Federation's ship, the ""Fesarius"", Kirk knows he can't rely on technology, and instead turns to the human talent for bamboozling, warning the alien ship of a federation device powerful enough to reflect back any energy directed at it.  (We'll be destroyed, but we won't go alone, Kirk seems to say).  With a simple plot, the script milks gallons of tension.  The premise, relying on pluck excels over latter generations of Trek relying simply on techno-babble.  There's also the character of Bailey - usually side characters are nothing more than fodder (somebody has to die, as long as it's somebody else) - but the script allows him to rise above that.",1014681600,,2875,5.130901287553648

III provides, ST fans with new toys...the Klingon Bird of Prey, science vessels, and the ""great experiment"" USS Excelsior (a far superior ship than the refitted Enterprise).

Okay, so maybe Shatner's display of bare flesh ain't nearly as gratuitous here as it was in `Big Bad Mama' (come to think of it, NONE of `em were!), but, um... where am I going with this? Absolutely nowhere, that's where! Which means it's time to move on the next eppie on this disc...
`The Corbomite Maneuver' was the proper introduction of Dr. McCoy  (the network wasn't showing the episodes in the actual order they were filmed, so this wasn't his first official appearance BUT!...), as well as his second-most-famous (paraphrased) catchphrase,  ""What am I, a doctor, or...?"" Also new to the scene is Uhura, that sultry goddess of the Enterprise communications console, and Yeoman Rand! As most males of the Trekkie Nation will tell you, hailing frequencies ain't the ONLY things that are open whenever these ladies put in their screen time! Strangely enough, Uhura debuts wearing a yellow miniskirt uniform here. Fortunately, the higher-ups in the costume department noticed that she looked much better in red!
Also making one of his earliest appearances here is the false Balok. Actually, it's his only appearance, save for his image showing up as part of the background stills in the closing credits of almost every original `Trek show! He's also been part of a few practical jokes performed by Gene Roddenberry on the show's writers. Then there's the real Balok, played by Clint Howard, who's almost as scary-looking as his false alter-ego!  No wonder big brother Richie- whoops, I mean, Opie- whoops, I mean, Ron throws him small roles in the flicks he directs! Might as well face facts: Clint just ain't got that `leading man' look...

The later ST-TOS episodes began to get trapped in a rut in which the characters were trapped on planet surfaces and tortured by cruel captors; whereas, in the earlier episodes, the villains were not all one-dimensional.
If you enjoy sadomasochistic themes, I suggest you try the much more interesting 3rd-season episode, ""The Empath."" And if you're a newcomer to ST-TOS, try ""The Cage,"" ""City on the Edge of Forever,"" ""Other Side of Paradise,"" ""Conscience of the King.""

228837,4,6300213501,"Another pairing of great if mismatched episodes.  I guess the idea was to pool dissimilar episodes rather than the episodes which seem like slight variations on a single idea (like sending the crew to planets ruled by modern day versions of Nazi Germany or Imperial Rome).
In ""A Piece of the Action"", the crew journeys to Iotia, a planet whose inhabitants prove incredibly resourceful and adaptive.  Based upon a single book on 1920's Gangsters left behind by a previous starship, the Iotians have modeled their entire culture to resemble Jazz-era Chicago - Tommyguns, mob-molls, hits and all.  Landing on Iotia to open contact, Kirk and crew find themselves in the middle of a gang war.  The episode is funny without being too campy (forgetting that this is the story requiring the heroes to sneak around a Paramount backlot in period costume).  Kirk struggles to unite the warring gangs for the good of the planet without taking sides and without becoming another hit.  The last shot is classic - leaving open the possibility that the Iotians may one day demand a piece of the Starfleet's action.
In ""By any other name"", the Enterprise is hijacked by the Kelvan - an advanced race of beings from the Andromeda galaxy.  Having been marooned when their ship was crippled by the energy barrier at the rim of our galaxy (the same barrier that has made appearances in ""Where no man has gone before"", ""Is there no truth in Beauty"" and the fifth Trek film), the Kelvan took on the shape of human beings.  Their actual forms - immense being with many tentacles and huge brains - would have trouble managing turbolifts.  Once past the barrier, the Kelvan use their advance technology to reduce much of the crew into small styrofoam boxes, and otherwise keep the remaining crew in submission.  Their mission is to reach their home galaxy and return to ours with a massive invasion force.  This is a great episode, combining some subtle wit and quick thinking with some matchless direction.  In one excellent cut, Scott, Spock and Kirk weigh their options enroute to the bridge.  With the Kelvan homecoming a possible harbinger of invasion, the crew realizes that more than their own lives are stake.  Yet, against the Kelvan technology, only a single plan is available and suicidal at that.  ""The Kelvan will be stopped here"", Spock intones gravely ""and so will we.""  Kirk is about to respond in fury - there's got to be something else we can do - when the door opens.  None of the nex-gen episodes can touch that moment.

Afet his apparent death in ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,"" Kirk soon learns from Spock's father Sarek(the late Mark Leonard who will be missed very much) that Spock's katra(his spirit) is alive within Dr. McCoy. This leads Kirk to reuniting his original crew, and hijacking the Enterprise to recover Spock's body on Genesis. However, Kirk will soon confront the evil Klingon Commander Kruge(Christopher Lloyd from ""Back to the Future"") who is attempting to steal the secret of Genesis from Kirk's son David; the end of this is not a pretty picture.

228841,3,6300213501,"We are obviously getting near the end of the road here because Volume 37 of the Star Trek DVD series offers up a couple of lesser efforts from the show's final season. ""The Lights of Zetar"" is heading for Memory Alpha, which must be the Federation's version of Asimov's Foundation facility, when an energy cloud appears. After knocking out Lt. Mira Romaine on the ship, the cloud attacks Memory Alpha, kills most of the researchers and wipes out the computer memory. When the Enterprise encounters the cloud again, it is clear that there is some weird link between it and Romaine. Eventually Kirk gets around to exploiting it in order to figure out what is going on and what to do about it. This is one of those Star Trek episodes that just strikes me as rather lame. The explanation is unsatisfying and the resolution is a bit extreme on several levels. Besides which, I do not think energy clouds are this easy to defeat.
""The Cloud Minders"" finds the Enterprise visiting Ardana, a planet rich in the mineral zenite and where the society is divided into those who live on Stratos, a city in the cloud where everyone engages in the mental arts, and the Troglytes, who work in the zenite minds. As Kirk tries to negotiate for the zenite, the Troglytes have started to rebel. Plasus, the head of the Stratos Council, starts torturing Troglytes, with little success. Kirk meets with Vanna, the leader of the Troglytes and offers help: it seems the zenite gas causes ""temporary"" mental and emotional problems and McCoy has whipped up some masks that improve the health of the miners. Of course, Vanna does not trust the strange visitors from another planet and the people of Stratos do not want to give up their belief of superiority over the Troglytes. This leaves it all up to Kirk to show them all the error of their ways. Since there is a planet that needs that zenite I guess playing around with the Prime Directive is okay (this time). ""The Cloud Minders"" is the better of the two episodes on this DVD, but we have seen much better examples of Kirk bringing enlightenment to supposedly advanced but obviously bigoted societies.",1005177600,,2130,4.682666666666667

Lee Meriwether (one of three actresses to portray Catwoman) appears, and disappears, in a severely underwritten guest role in That Which Survives.  Poor pacing, weak dialogue, and out of character behavior by the crew all but ruin an interesting premise.  Spock, in particular, acts rather snippishly throughout the episode, being downright rude to Scott, McCoy, and Chekov.  Leonard Nimoy was so distressed by some of his dialogue he sent third season producer Fred Frieberger a lengthy memo in protest.  It was of no use, as Frieberger had little grasp of what made the first two seasons' best stories so noteworthy.
Let that Be Your Last Battlefield is a very obvious allegory on America's black/white conflict.  Too obvious, really.  As with Patterns of Force, the  parallels are so upfront that the story loses its effectiveness.  Star Trek's social conscience worked best when The Message was integrated into an entertaining story (as in The Undiscovered Country) rather than being shoved down the viewers' throats.

228878,3,6300213501,"Volume 34 of Paramount's complete reissue of Classic Trek contains two episodes which could best be described as fair-to-middling in quality.
Plato's Stepchildren made history of sorts by containing the first interracial kiss (inter-ETHNIC, really, since Kirk and Uhura are both of the same race--the HUMAN race) on network television.  But William Shatner, in his book Star Trek Memories, pointed out that TWO versions of the kiss were filmed--one as a full-on kiss, and one where the actors' lips didn't actually meet.  The second take was used, which means the highly touted kiss is actually a fake!  (Watch the episode and you'll see what I mean.)  Perhaps the publicity mavens connected with Trek actually are referring to the smooch between Spock and Nurse Chapel when they refer to an interracial kiss--which would fit the bill since Spock is half-Vulcan.  The rest of the episode is a mix is sillyness, some cringeworthy moments from the actors, and lightweight sermonizing.
Wink of an Eye is a bit better.  The idea of life-forms existing out of sync with each other has served Trek well and often.  Generally, this episode is well made, although there are inconsistencies.  It is never fully explained how the accelerated Scalosians can function on the Enterprise (the doors to the turbolift and corridors remain conveniently open for much of the episode).  Uncharacteristically, after the Scalosians have been defeated, Kirk does not extend the hand of friendship and offer them a cure for their ailment, but rather sends them on their way.  NBC's censors must have been asleep during the infamous scene where Kirk--after a coital romp with the Scalosian queen--pulls his boots back on.

228907,4,6300213501,"Paramount's complete reissue of Classic Trek on DVD continues with this installment of episodes from the end of the series' second season.
Over thirty years after it was first aired, The Ultimate Computer remains a thought provoking and relevant episode.  The theme of man vs. machine is more with us today than ever before.  D. C. Fontata's excellent script is helped by superior television directing from John Meredyth Lucas.  The distinguished stage actor William Marshall's performance as Dr. Richard Daystrom is rich in foreshadowing the high-strung scientist's impending breakdown.  (Primarily based on the strength of that performance, nearly every Trek incarnation since has referenced Richard Daystrom, and in The Next Generation, there's even a Daystrom Institute.)  Barry Russo makes a brief but noteworthy appearance as Commodore Robert Wesley (Wesley was Gene Roddenberry's middle name).  Finally, James Doohan outdoes himself by playing THREE roles here: Scotty (of course), the voice of Commodore Enwright, and the voice of the M-5 Computer.
The Omega Glory was one of three scripts written for the second Trek pilot, following NBC's rejection of The Cage (the other two were Mudd's Women and Where No Man Has Gone Before).  Though this was the first script written making use of the parallel worlds concept, by the time it was filmed, the idea had been used so many times before (Miri, Bread & Circuses, Patterns of Force) that it was becoming stale.  As in Patterns of Force, the parallels are so obviously drawn that they're not convincing.
There are a few clever visual touches here: In The Ultimate Computer, four Constitution Class starships are shown by creating a split screen effect.  In The Omega Glory, two existing shots of the Enterprise are combined to create the appearance of two starships orbiting Omega IV.
The restored picture is excellent, with deep colors and realistic flesh tones.  The sound has been effectively, but tastefully, enhanced for multi-channel systems.",996624000,9,2003,5.290220820189274
228908,5,6300213501,"Volume 25 of Paramount's complete reissue of Classic Star Trek contains two stories showcasing superior writing and offering plenty of action.
A Piece of the Action remains one of Trek's most popular episodes.  In essence, it's a time travel episode, without the time travel, which frees the story from the usual ""Don't alter the future"" constraints.  The hands of Gene L. Coon, who co-wrote this episode, are evident in the colorful writing, and in the banter between the characters.  Deliberately, the Iotians are all made to speak using a nonstop stream of 1920s cliches.  When Kirk adopts these cliches, and eventually persuades Spock to adopt them, the course is set for maximum comedy.
By Any Other Name is mostly standard action fare, involving the Enterprise being hijacked by an invading force of Kelvans from another galaxy.  These esoteric aliens have taken Human form to be able to function in a human environment.  The solution is to introduce them to the pleasures of the senses, which creates a chance for James Doohan to shine as Scotty gets a Kelvan, and himself, drunk.  This episode also highlights one of Kirk's finest characteristics: his willingness to forgive.  Even after the Kelvan leader has killed one of his crew, Kirk is willing to extend the hand of friendship and offer the Federation's help.
Both sound and picture are fine.",995587200,8,1356,4.995555555555556
228909,4,6300213501,"The crew of the Enterprise visits an idyllic, pre-industrialized world inhabited by the docile hill-people and the greedy villagers.  Not incorporated into the Federation of Planets, this pre-techno world is supposed to be free of any interference by either the Federation or the Klingon empire.  Nevertheless, on a routine survey, the villagers attack the hill people with crude rifles - though that requires technology beyond them.  With Mr. Spock severely injured, Kirk stays behind looking for evidence that the Klingons are illegally supplying technology that will allow the villagers to conquer the planet and rule it for the Klingons.  Reuniting with the Hill People, among whom Kirk once lived, Kirk hooks up with their leader, Tyree and his wife, the bewitching Nona.  Sneaking into the Villagers' stronghold, Kirk finds evidence of non-indigenous technology (carbon-free metal tools are a big tip-off).  Though implicating the Klingons, Kirk now faces an even bigger quandry - allow the rapacious villagers to conquer the planet, or give the hill-people the means to fight back.  Either alternative gurantees bloodshed, with the decision coming down to ensuring either the genocide of the hill people or a ceaseless and bloody war with the villagers.  Dr. McCoy, who stayed planetside with Kirk, provides the perfect moral foil for Kirk who is defiantly pro-defense.
I must have seen this episode a hundred times as a kid, never knowing that it was obviously a take on the war in Vietnam which had already escalated by then.  The weird part is how this film makes as the enemies, the urbanized and technologically advanced villagers, which is more analogous to the Southern Vietnamese regime.  Like the very best sci-fi, when it must be topical, the script is dignified enough to explore both sides.  It's a weak episode of Trek, suffering because the comedy team of Bones and Spock spends much of the time apart (with Spock stuck on the Enterprise, recuperating from the attack in the beginning of the episode).  The script tries juicing things up with the wicked-hot Nona and an attack by the ""Mugato"", a sort of white, horned gorilla with poison fangs, that both seem to distract from the message of the show (which may have been the biggest reason for putting them there - the guys who write for Trek were brave, but to a fault).

They do include the trailer for ""next weeks"" episode which is fun. ""The Ultimate Computer"" provides a predictable warning as to the dangers of technology, and the message is not dated in today's world view. More interesting is the effect this loss of power has on Captain Kirk.  The loss of command is a recurrent theme in the original series. Check out ""The Deadly Years,"" ""The Naked Time"" or ""This Side of Paradise."" In these episodes, Kirk's passion for the Enterprise is clearly established. Another interesting theme is that of the renegade captain, subject of ""The Omega Glory.""  In the tradition of Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" a captain finds himself alienated from civilization and ""goes native"" setting himself up as lord over the inhabitants. Check out ""Bread and Circuses"" or ""Patterns of Force."" The source of conflict, or drama, is provided when Captain Kirk is forced to confront what is essentially a darker version of himself.  He knows his enemy, and his enemy, a former friend has the same training Kirk does.  Remember, there were only twelve constellation class starships in the fleet, so these captains are at the top of their game. This senario is more directly explored in ""The Enemy Within"" where Kirk must literally battle his dark side.

Kirk, Uhura, and Chekov are zapped several light years from their original destination, dressed in kinky S&M obedience collars, and assigned drill thralls--essentially companion slaves (poor Chekov's drill thrall looks like a drag queen from the Jerry Springer show).  Kirk once again gets the girl, and lectures the ""advanced"" race on the errors of their ways. This plotline has been examined--more effectively--in The Cage and Bread & Circuses.  The saving grace of this episode is that Chekov and Uhura are at last given more to do that recite ""Course plotted"" of ""Hailing Frequencies Open.""
The sound and picture are up to the standards of the other issues of this series, but because of the weak writing, this DVD is recommended only to die-hard Star Trek fans.",991872000,3,1380,5.088495575221239

SEARCH picks up right where WRATH OF KHAN left off, Khan is dead, Spock is dead, the Genisis planet is in full bloom and has sparked controversy all over the galaxy, and the Enterprise is chugging home after it's near destruction only to see that it is to be retired with Kirk and his crew having to pursue less interesting work.  The problems don't stop there, Dr. McCoy is slowly going insane from Spocks mindmeld and at the Genisis planet, a Klingon pirate ship led by Captain Kruge are out to seize the secrets of this new planet which Kruge belives is a Starfleet weapon and in the process captures Kirk's son David and the regenerated Spock.
Spocks father comes before Kirk and tells him that if he wants to save McCoy, he must reunite him with Spock and have them taken to Vulcan so that they may both be restored, but Genisis is off limits and Kirk knows this but he can't let his friends down, so he and the rest of the crew assemble to steal the Enterprise, putting their lives and jobs at risk and rescue Spock and end up having to sacrifice the Enterprise to save the day.  A good pace throughout most of the movie, SEARCH is often underrated and overlooked by the other movies, 2, 4, 6, and FIRST CONTACT.  It shouldn't be as it can hold a candle to each of these movies, often a dimmed candle though.
SEARCH does have two demerrits, the sets of the film are worse then any of the other Trek films.  Old Atari style graphics and computers are the computer displays and tacky brick a brak colors and corny lighting to make up most of the ship layouts. Also, when at the end the crew arives at Vulcan, the movie grinds slowly to it's eventual conclusion.  Another minus.
Star Trek 3 is a great film for every trek fan and holds the title probably the best odd numbered Trek.  (Well, lets see how the revamped MOTION PICTURE looks and we can decide further.)",990403200,,2002,4.353887399463807

Although the title may be dumb (if you saw Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, then you are well aware of exactly ""where"" Spock is), this film is just about equal to The Wrath of Kahn.  Part III picks up exactly where part II left off, with everyone saddened by the death of Spock. The Genesis Project is now very controversial because it is known throughout the galaxy as a very powerful weapon.  Enter the Klingons, led by Christopher Lloyd (in a role that had to have been tailor-made for him).  He battles Kirk for the Genesis Project...and so on.
This movie's emphasis on the theme of friendship and sacrifice above all else makes it a winner in the hearts of Trekkers, or anyone with feelings for that matter.  The rescue of Spock and the aforementioned ""sacrifices"" are just as dramatic and haunting as Spock's demise was in part II (there are two really big shockers in this sequel).  The only real weak link in this movie was the replacement of Kirsty Alley by Robin Curtis as Lt. Saavik.  Alley's Saavik in The Wrath of Khan was played surprisingly with a lot of emotion, and that's what made her character likable.  Curtis plays her as being very dry and too ""logical,"" which given who she was in part II, makes no sense.

The Gamesters of Triskelion on the other hand is pure sci-fi. Alien women in gladiator schools falling for Kirk. Kirk having to save the day and out smart the colored brains.

These episodes look and sound better than ever on DVD.  Paramount has wisely released two episodes per disc rather than one, for which we can be thankful.  Sadly, however, there are no extras except for the ""Next Voyage"" trailers.  Like another reviewer, I wish Paramount and the Sci-Fi Channel could strike  a deal permitting the addition of the behind-the-scenes information featuring the actors and guest stars.

228954,4,6300213501,"Star Trek III is the exception to the general rule that the ""odd-numbered"" Star Trek films are the weak entries in the series.  It is ably directed by Leonard Nimoy, in his first directoral effort, and features some excellent performances from a strong cast.
""The Search for Spock"" is part of a loose trilogy that begins with Star Trek II.  Like the earlier film, it builds on the character relationships established in the television series.  At the end of Star Trek II, Spock apparently sacrificed his life to save the Enterprise, and his body was sent down to the surface of the newly created Genesis planet.  But it develops that Vulcans like Spock have a ""katra,"" a sort of spiritual and intellectual essence, and Spock managed to infuse his into Dr. McCoy before he died.  So Kirk and McCoy have to hijack the Enterprise to return to the Genesis planet (with the aid of Scotty, Sulu and Chekov).  Meanwhile, back at that very planet, Kirk's son David and Lt. Saavik (Robin Curtis, the one weak link in the cast) have found a living Vulcan child.  And lurking somewhere out in subspace is an ambitious Klingon (Christopher Lloyd), who is surely up to no good (trust me, this all works better on film than it sounds in print).
Nimoy directs ably from a script by Harve Bennett.  William Shatner turns in his usual solid job as Kirk, while Lloyd is well cast as his antagonist.  With Spock not a presence on screen, other cast members get more of a chance to shine--Nichelle Nichols as Uhura (""You want adventure?"") and George Takei as Sulu (""Don't call me Tiny"") have marvelous moments.  Most important, given Dr. McCoy's central role in the plot, DeForest Kelley gives his finest performance in any of the Star Trek films, if not his entire career.",980035200,2,1753,4.680781758957655

Although III starts off right after the events of II, it really is a prequel to Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. Don't get me wrong, III has some great and classic Star Trek ingredients: A solid villian, a good plot, and a couple of great surprizes. It's just after the wonderful and exciting experience that II provided this seems a little watered down.
One of the highlights of this movie is the Klingon contingent. Led by Christopher Lloyd as the evil Captain Kruge, we're treated to a group of interesting and sometime complex characters. Hidden under all the Klingon make-up is John Laroquette of Night Court fame. Another highlight is the magnificent score of James Horner, which manages to capture the mood of this film better than almost any movie I've seen.

Star Trek III expanded on the Star Trek universe more than any other episode or movie had previously done, which is why this movie is as great as it is.

What follows is a thrilling adventure as Kirk and his crew discover Spock's true condition and what must be done to help him.

These characters haven't been portrayed with such nobility since the ""City on the Edge of Forever"" episode in 1967.

228991,4,6300213501,"Despite the holes in the plot and the need to willingly suspend disbelief at times, Star Trek III is among my favorite of the original cast films.  I even like it better than Star Trek IV.
The special effects in this film  are really good and I love James Horner's score enough to have bought it on  cassette.  There are many dramatic visual moments, including when the  Enterprise approaches the giant space station orbiting Earth and the  destruction of the Genesis planet, and of course, the destruction of the  Enterprise.
The cast is in their usual fine form.  Uhurua gets a smaller  role in this movie because she stays behind, but she does get one really  good scene giving a young Starfleet cadet his comeuppance.  Scottie gets to  shine as temporary engineering officer and vandalizer of the new starship  Excelsior.  McCoy is funny, occasionally slipping into his Spock mode.  One  of his best lines, upon hearing that he is carrying Spock's  ""katra"" inside him is ""It's [Spock's] revenge for losing all  of those arguments!""  William Shatner has a really good dramatic  scene when Kirk learns that his son has been killed by the Klingons.  Christopher Lloyd is good as the Klingon commander Kruge.  Unrecognizable  as one of his subordinates, Maltz, is the guy who played Dan Fielding in  the Nightcourt sitcom on NBC.
Merrit Butrick and Robin Curtis are not  particularly memorable as David and Saavik, but accomplish what is expected  of them.  Another reviewer observed that the film barely hints that Saavik  sleeps with the young Spock as he experiences Pon Faar.  I read the  novelization of Star Trek III, and not only does it make it clear that she  is ""intimate"" with him, if indeed Vulcans can be intimate, but  that she also sleeps with Kirk's son David as well before they go to the  Genesis planet.  Had it been included in the film, it really would have  added another element to it, though in the end it might have been  distracting too.
It is a bit of a coincidence that Kirk gets Spock off  the Genesis planet at just the right age, and the way in which Spock is  brought back is a bit hard to swallow, after all, even the Vulcan high  priestess declared that the process had not been done in ages, and then  only in myth.  Why would Spock then be confident that it would work?  Then  again, since all of us Trekkies wanted Spock back, we won't quibble.  Star  Trek III is a good combination of action, humor and drama.

228992,5,6300213501,"Kirk, Spock, McCoy...the Holy Trinity of Science Fiction.  Their relationship has been the cornerstone of a great many classic Trek episodes, which is why they will be highly regarded by Trek fans all over  the world even without the fancy schmancy special effects present in the  new incarnations.  In my opinion, this movie really hits home the bond  these characters have, both to themselves and us as well.
While I feel  ""Wrath of Khan"" is the best of Trek movies, ""Search For  Spock"" is in a dead heat with it.  The pace is slower, the mood is  darker but the humanity in it has never been better.
In this movie,  Kirk loses probably the only things that rival his bond with Spock...his  son and his ship.  It's wrenching to see unfold.  Yet, as McCoy says in the  movie Kirk always seems to ""turn death into a fighting chance to  live"" and that is definitely shown here.  The movie has some of the  best visuals of any Trek movie. The characters of Chekov, Uhura, Sulu, and  Scottie are still a powerful force in the movie though their screen time is  not as great.  On a personal note, the scene of the Enterprise  self-destruct had a tremendous effect on me when I saw the movie in a  packed theatre in 1984.  Any Trek guru who says they didn't have a lump in  their throat when the blackened hulk of the Enterprise, the symbol for (at  that time) nearly 20 years of imagination and wonder, slowly arcing into  the Genesis atmosphere in a blaze of glory must have been sleeping or dead.  I remember complete and utter silence in the theatre.  It moved  people...big time.  Unfortuantely, with the Next Generation and Voyager  blowing their ships up seemingly every week, the effect has been lost.  The  ships, while as graceful and powerful as ever, for some reason never seemed  to grab me like Kirk's Enterprise did.  But, I digress...
This film shows  vividly the sacrifices that one could have to make for the friendship of  one person.  Kirk for all intents and purposes lost everything dear to him  to try and save the one man he felt closer to than anything else in the  universe.  It's almost Biblical in a sense...a simple question with  tremedously complex answer:  Would you be willing to lose everything for  someone you cared about?

Spock believed that  the good of the many outweigh the good of the few or the one, and, in Star  Trek II, he sacrificed his life to save the rest of the crew. And now, in  this film, quite befittingly, the crew sacrifice their lives and their  futures to save Spock. What a beatutiful, marvelous dichotomy the writers  have presented in these two selfless acts. Early in Star Trek IV, Spock's  mother Amanda eloquently explains to her son why his human friends did what  they did. These are the things that make Star Trek great. Harve Bennett and  Nicholas Meyer, among others, deserve a great deal of credit for making  these movies the gems that they are.

Unfortunately, as others have said before me, there is  little on the DVD besides the two episodes each themselves. Just the  trailer from televison. More could have been done here -- thus I took away  a 'star' for this. However, the quality of the transfer is excellent and  will present you with many hours of re-enjoying the adventures once again  (assuming that you enjoyed them in the first place).
For those of you who  have not seen ST:TOS, I favor it over later Star Trek releases because of  the unique personal interaction between the primary members of the crew  (Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty). This is the strengh of the series, and was  not duplicated in later Star Trek releases.

The Klingon Vessel continues a course to  presue the Enterprise. When it does its all out war the Klingons even go as  far as to kill Kirks son.
  In rage Kirk self disructs the  Enterprise and brings his friend home safely to take vulcan ritual to  restore him and Mccoy back to normal and save there friends life.

This DVD has a lot to offer! The screen quality was EXCELLENT and the music/audio portions were superb as well.  My only reason for limiting  the full 5 stars was the fact that you have to buy the volumes separately,  and not in one box set.

229042,2,6300213501,"First the movie: ""Star Trek III"" is a decent installment in the ""Star Trek"" movie series, even if it is just one big segue.  First-time director Leonard Nimoy does a servicable job in helming the  story of Spock's rebirth.  The premise of the story is quite compelling  (Kirk's crew mutinies against Starfleet and sends the Enterprise to it's  destruction) and the special effects are fantastic.  The movie, however is  far from perfect.  At times, the story isn't too--well--logical, and all  the sacrifices Kirk and co. make in ""Star Trek III"" are pretty  much undone or forgotten in ""Star Trek IV"".  Add to that the  wrong-headed casting of Robin Curtis as Saavik--and especially Christopher  Lloyd as Kruge--and you get a flick firmly entrenched as the ""middle  child"" of the ""Star Trek"" movie franchise.
  As far as  the DVD version, given how much money Paramount rakes in from ""Star  Trek"" would it KILL them to make a Trek DVD with some special  features?  A director's commentary would have been great; a triva section  would have been outstanding.  Instead what do we get?  The requisite  widescreen and theatrical trailer and that's it.  This disk doesn't even  have foreign language captions, for goodness sake!  Like all the Trek  releases before this one, Paramount put as little work as possible into the  DVD version, and frankly that stinks.

229043,4,6300213501,"When I read the review about all the problems this DVD could have I got a bit worried that I'd get very angry when I recived this. But when I inserted it into my PC-DVD it worked perfectly. I'm not doubting that many  of the DVD's might be defect. I don't know anything about that. It worked  just fine on mine at least.
When it comes to the movie I don't think I'll  say anything. I'm sure you know what it's about and so on (if not, just  look above before the reviews) I don't think this is a bad movie. OK, it's  not the best of the bunch, but it's a good movie that holds many memorable  scenes.
When it comes to the quality of the DVD I have to say: Excelent!  The image quality is very very good. It's sharp and shows few signs of dust  or other faults. And when it comes to the audio, the movie has never  sounded so good. The Dolby Digital 5.1 track sucks you into the movie, and  makes the experiance better than ever. The sound is clear and with good use  of the back speakers.
With the everlasing lack of extras on the Star Trek  disc, you get what you see, the movie and some trailers. I'd had loved to  have more extras, but this is what we get, and what we do get, seems to be  presented like it should be.",955929600,,1221,4.012448132780083
229044,4,6300213501,"The Search for Spock is the best of the odd-numbered films.  This is primarily a character driven story which recalls the best episodes of the original series.  Spock's resurrection is handled surprisingly  convincingly--no magical regeneration with a shiny blue matte line here.  In all aspects, Leonard Nimoy does a fine job as director--he can clearly  handle a camera and get good performances from his actors.  The only  complaint I have about this film, and it's a minor one, is the replacement  of Kirstie Alley with Robin Curtis as Lt. Saavik.  Most of the special  effects have held up well over the years, and the few that haven't are not  overly distracting.  Star Trek has never been beholden to special effects,  but has generally relied upon character development and story--and this  emphasis has served it well.  As usual, Paramount has been skimpy with  extras--only a theatrical trailer this time, and an alternate French  soundtrack, and the movie could have used better chapter divisions.  The  picture has improved on both the VHS and Laser Disc issues--the colors are  more vibrant and crisper.  The sound has more impact than the earlier  versions.

To sum up, Trek 3 leaves off and continues perfectly the moods from 2 after Spock has died.  With great  performances from Shatner, Kelley, and crew, Trek 3 is a fabulous trek  film.
Things to nate of:  the score is flawless, James Horner has never  been better.  The effects and battle scenes are top notch, and the moment  when Kirk sits down to enter the destruct sequence is arguably the top trek  film moment of all time.  Plus Spock's entrance at the end is poignant and  emotional.

However, if  Paramount keeps releasing the Star Trek movies without deleted scenes,  commentary, documentaries etc.., then they have to start charging less.  Heck I think Amazon was selling The Abyss double DVD special edition for  the same amount as Star Trek III!  As a previous reviewer had mentioned,  the extra footage and documentaries EXIST.

229089,4,6300213501,"Star Trek III: The Search for Spock starts out with a huge strike against it before the audience even sits to watch it: we know what the basic plot and outcome are going to be.  The greatest thing about this movie is that  the filmmakers are still successful in making it fun and entertaining along  the way.
This is a moodier and more somber story than ""Wrath of  Khan"" and really looks at how the characters have matured throughout  the years. The themes of sacrifice and friendship carry over from the last  film, and are intensified here to give us a warm and engaging story.
There IS a good mix of action and suspense, particularly the theft of  the Enterprise (probably one of the coolest scenes EVER done in Star Trek),  the battle with the Klingons, and so forth. It is all secondary to the  simple but strong story line, however.
This movie represents one of  William Shatner's finest performances and is the best overall-acted of all  the films.  Christopher Lloyd plays the best Klingon yet.  Definately a  great Star Trek movie, but because it is the centerpiece to the Khan  trilogy, it has trouble standing alone.  See all 3!

229091,5,6300213501,"I first began watching Star Trek in reruns.  The print quality was awful in those days:  scratchy, grainy film; poor audio; obvious splices, and the episodes were cut to allow for extra commercials.
I have on occasion  purchased the VHS transfers, but the quality was mediocre at  best.
Paramount is to be commended for deciding to transfer the entire  original series to DVD.  Their engineers have done an excellent job of  remastering the visual images.  (The image is a bit TOO good.  Look  carefully, and you can make out the seam line in William Shatner's toupee.)  But, what is really astonishing to me is what they have done with the  sound.  By separating the various elements (dialogue, scoring and sound  effects), they have been able to present a much more vivid audio image.  Star Trek never looked or sounded better.  True, the visual effects and  sets date.  But have you seen an early episode of Next Generation lately?  They look pretty cheesy by today's standards, and what about those awful  lycra uniforms?
I am aware that there have been complaints regarding each  DVD containing two episodes, but if there had been more the cost would  certainly have been higher.
It has been said that the best special effect  of all is human emotion.  Watching the interplay between Kirk, Spock,  McCoy, and the other characters, one can easily see what has been missing  in the sequel Star Trek series--indeed, in science fiction generally.",953942400,30,1447,4.87603305785124

As to the two  stories on this tape. ""Where No Man..."" is an excellent episode  featuring some brilliant acting from William Shatner - eg when he speaks to  Dehner about the frailties of a human god. This episode, more than any  other, possesses a sense of wonder that was prevalent in the Original  series and even in TNG, but is now sadly lacking in DS9 and Voyager. There  is imagination, intelligence and that little bit extra which makes it easy  to see why Star Trek has become so enduring.
""Corbomite..."" is  another good episode which again features some good moments, especially a  thinking reasoning Captain Kirk rather than the smooth operator of the  third season.

As for the interviews that could be a  problem between the Sci-Fi channel and Paramount I'm sure the Sci-Fi  channel holds the rights to the interviews and perhaps they will come out  on a special interview DVD that would contain the complete interview at  once instead of snippets here and there. Overall I think it is great to  have the series in this format and 2 episodes per disc keeps the price per  disc very reasonable I'm sure not everyone will collect the whole series  and 4 or 6 episodes per disc would probably be giving a lot of people  episodes that they didn't want but had to pay for anyway.

229213,3,6300213501,"I sent the following to Paramount at  webmaster@pde.paramount.com:
I recently purchased the DVD Star Trek: The Original Series, Vol. 1.  The ""digitally enhanced and remastered"" episodes 2 & 3 looked  great.  This is the best that the original series has ever looked.  It  didn't look this good when originally broadcast.  I remember.
As much as  I like the high quality of the video and sound provided by the DVD, there  are a few things about it I don't like.  The main problem is that the DVD  contains only two episodes.  Two episodes per video tape made sense because  that was the most that could be recorded and still provide the best picture  of which tape is capable. That is not the case with the DVD format.  A DVD  could store six episodes without loss of quality. I don't expect that  though, since I understand Paramount wants to maximize its profits from  Star Trek.  However, four episodes could be included on each DVD and if the  price were increased to maintain the cost per episode of two per DVD, the  total price for a four episode DVD would be within the range of DVD movies  and so be practical to market.  Why is it important to me to have more  episodes per DVD, enough so that I am willing to pay more for that DVD?  Partly it is that I hate to see the waste involved in using only a fraction  of the storage space on each disk.  That waste directly effects me by  taking up more shelf space to store the DVDs.  Merely doubling the number  of episodes per DVD would halve the storage space required for the entire  collection.  Right now, I doubt I will buy the entire series because of the  problem of storing them (I never purchased the video tapes for the same  reason).  Instead, I will probably buy just the DVDs that contain my  favorite episodes.  Understand that I am a serious collector of DVDs.  I  have over 50 movies on DVD already, and expect to continue to buy more  (speaking of which, when are the Indiana Jones movies going to be released  on DVD?).  But the size of my DVD collection already means that storage  space is at a premium.  Also, the ineffieciency of using only a fraction of  the DVDs capability offends my conservative nature.  It's bad ecology as  well.
To sum up, I love the quality of Star Trek on DVD but I hate the  packaging (or is it marketing?).
One more thing.  I'd like to see more  bonus materials on the Star Trek DVDs.  Its nice to have the preview  trailers, but there is so much more that could be included.  How about  interviews with the cast, or commentaries such as those shown on the Sci-Fi  Channel when it rebroadcast the original series?  Anything about the  special effects or design of the show would be great.  I have been very  impressed with the DVDs from New Line Cinema or Columbia Tristar and  recommend them to my friends who are just entering the world of DVD.  I'd  like to be able to recommend Paramount also.
Will Paramount pay any  attention to my letter?  Probably not, if it's the only one they receive.  If you feel that two episodes per DVD is a waste, why not let them know?",935539200,30,3074,4.423423423423423
