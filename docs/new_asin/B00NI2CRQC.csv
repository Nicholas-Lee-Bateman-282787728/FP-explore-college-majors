6656983,5,B00NI2CRQC,"I had heard so much hype about this movie from various websites & blogs, that I decided to buy it & see it for myself.  All I can say is, the movie lived up to all the hype (which is rare these days for ANY movie).  Whether you're straight, gay, bi, asexual, or indifferent, this movie will hit you where you live.  I'm turning 50 soon myself, and call it a ""mid-life crisis"" if you must, but everything that 'David' feels in this movie, hit home with me.  Thinking that you have lived more years than you have left, & wondering about the choices you've made & wondering if you made the right ones, & questioning what you will do with the rest of your life, is scary enough!  But falling in love with someone who is younger than you, & that person teaching you that age is only a number, well... it left me wondering if these people had access to my personal journals.  After watching this movie, it left me feeling pretty good about my future & made me lose the regrets of past decisions.  Because of this movie, I'm now a big fan of Mel England, Tom Saporito, & Jeff London!",1420416000,3,1076,4.245098039215686

6656987,5,B00NI2CRQC,"This is a gem of an Indie film.  Intelligently written and superbly acted, this movie goes far beyond my expectations.  This could possibly be Jeff London's finest film yet.  Without a single false note, Mel England in the lead delivers a nuanced and flawless performance paving the way for the other also very strong actors to smoothly play off of his subtle and most genuine style.  England made me feel for his character along with his dramatic circumstances without the usual soap-operatic, over the top, eye-roll inducing performances of so many Hollywood actors these days.  Tom Saporito and Peter Stickles were phenomenal in their supporting roles.  I fell in love with Ace Lundon and Nate Moore made me relish in truly hating his character!  Kudos to the boys on this one.  Buy it and own it because it is clearly a work of art from start to finish.  Love!",1418256000,11,864,4.74496644295302
6656988,1,B00NI2CRQC,I could never say up to this point that I did not like a movie. This movie is boring and poorly done. The acting was awful. Do not waste your money by buying it.,1475798400,,161,3.764705882352941

6656991,1,B00NI2CRQC,"Well I looked at the reviews and saw how everyone was raving about this movie! So I gambled it and bought it.

I met with some friends last night and started watching it. They were complaining how it was dragging on and too
much chatty dialog. So we stopped the movie and put on another. ""Those People"" Excellent movie a much watch.

 We really enjoyed ""Those People"" then I went home and curiosity got the better of me I had to
watch the rest of Best Day Ever to see how it ends it had to get better.

Well it NEVER did sorry. If you want my honest opinion it really sucked.

Great premise a gay guy's dream, gay guy turns 50 has a mid life crisis whines a lot then find a younger guy and falls in love live happily ever after.

Yeah  great Cinderella story every though it's not reality. But my point is, the movie was not well written, it dragged forever in the
beginning, middle and end. The acting was HORRIBLE! These guys can't act their way out of a paper bag.

Cool idea, bad production.

With regards to headline burnt twice, I collect gay movies I have over 600 hundred plus gay movies in my collection
so if anyone reads this and think I am homophobic and hating on gays, far from it. I bought this after seeing how many
great reviews not realizing I already bought the movie on DVD now I have 2 copies of a really bad movie.

Here are the facts, from my experience, I've been collecting gay movies for over 30+ years, 7 out of every 10 gay movies
really suck due to many reasons, but mainly budget, without money they can't hire professional actors
and do a great production. But having said that the 3 good movies out of the 10 will blow your socks off and make you
cheer!!

I have hundreds of movies in my collection that are not worth the disc they are printed on so I am writing the review from
my own experience now just hear say.

It made perfect sense that during the credits, the movie is based on real events and characters.

6656995,1,B00NI2CRQC,"Great concept. Contemporary tale.  It's great to have someone tell a romance from the perspective of ""the rest of us"" (I.E. over 50).  I just can't recommend this film, though.  Within the first 35 minutes, the lead character had 3 monologues covering the same topic: I'm over 50 and I had a rough life, I'm having a mid-life crisis...he does nothing to endear us to him, nor to spur the audience to root for his success.  The acting is  fine - at times great.  The camerawork is average.  This would have been a great movie if the ""real life couple"" had handed this project to film makers who were less emotionally connected to the material.",1448668800,3,642,4.530434782608696

6657002,5,B00NI2CRQC,"Just finished watching ""Best Day Ever"" released by Radioactive Cactus Entertainment.
Based in part on his own life, writer/director Jeff London has created an honest story about a 50-year old man who is at the crossroads in his life and career and soon finds himself falling in love with a much younger man, which creates new self-doubts for him..
I like it when I can relate to a movie on many levels and it honestly dealt with some of the emotions and self-doubts I had about having younger friends whom I'm a couple of decades older than. I got over those phony concerns and so does David - Jeff London's fictionalized version of himself.

6657005,2,B00NI2CRQC,"This excuse for a story is nothing more than a thinly disguised autobiographical piece that quite frankly is of interest to no one but the self-gratifying filmmaker.
REALLY!!!
For the first half, ...no, even more, we are over-subjected to the protagonist's interminable whining about his ageing...he's just turned 50.
OK a bit of ""mid-life crisis"" might be relevant, but this just seems to go on and on.....and on!
Even I wanted to bludgeon him with the nearest damned blunt object just to shut him up!
OK we get the message mate....move on!

He's got a dis-interested (can anyone blame the man?) gym-obsessed boyfriend, who apparently has lots of  ""business trips"" away, ....again if this is the carry- on he gets at home why wouldn't he have a couple of boys on the side? .
The gym-bunny brings his computer to the dining table, and nothing spells ""this relationship is over"" more than that one simple act !
After even more moaning and whinging from birthday boy, they decide to break up......frankly I'd have been off and running LONG before this!
The bloke is still a drifting mental case....at 50!
Anyway, .....enter best friend, who just happens to have an Idaho country boy coming to visit, ....and hopes he might be right for Mr Misery-Guts.
And guess what?
Well duh, the poor unsuspecting bastard IS, and the two almost immediately hook up and depart for ""happily ever after"" out in the plains of Potato-Land!
Spare a thought for the poor farm boy,...it's his first bloke, and he doesn't have a clue what he's really in for.
I'd give it a month at best stuck out in the dull flats of Idaho!
AND THAT'S IT!!! The End!
The story, such as it is, ....is only padded out to any length at all (it's a short, short film!), but all the time given to the above mentioned self-reflections and endless self-doubts and miserable disappointments of the lead over his ageing.
He's nothing short of a monumental downer, desperate to grasp at the lifeboat of any last straw!

Now there'll no doubt be those who will call me cynical, but there just wasn't anything at all here to repay your time even for the short while it takes to watch the damned overly self-indulgent thing.
No real narrative, no likeable characters, ...even a good villain might have added at least some interest.
No tension, no plot development, little characterisation....every one is fairly one-dimensional and there are only five people in it.
The moaner, his fed-up partner, the stock ""best friend"", the potential new love, ...and another stock regular, the ""old gay guy"" .
There were no obstacles at all to the change of partners, and that's exactly what happened.
Instant compatibility, leading to the idiotic and facile pronouncement of the movie's title!
(And couldn't you just see that coming?)

Performances are a little above what we usually see in such gay-themed indie-films, .....that much can be said for the thing, but if you are thinking of purchasing this for some interesting narrative, or even an interesting gay ""love story"", then you will be MUCH disappointed.
I did appreciate that neither of the blokes are buffed, over-waxed twinks more concerned about their hair-product than their acting, however there's just not enough here for a movie.

Sorry folks, but I was MAJORLY disappointed in having bought this, ...all purely on the good reviews it got here.

6657010,5,B00NI2CRQC,"Fifteen minutes into director Jeff London's Best Day Ever, I knew this was the gay movie I have been waiting a long time to see . It has indie budget stamped all over it, and a lot of people are going to say it is boring. It is--but only if you think real life is boring. The actors are ordinary looking and they have ordinary lives, but one of them has just turned 50. A lot of millennials reading this will wonder what's the big deal? Unless you have been there you just can't understand what a powerful event this is.

At this time in life everyone is forced to ask a lot of questions. Is this all there is? Progress in career, attractiveness, the possibility for real happiness, Have I made the right choices?--all these issues become enormous. It's why they call it mid-life crisis. Best Day Ever looks at all this in a forthright, real-life way, and contains a lot of good advice for whatever age you may be. A lot of it seems a little worn, but only because it is so universally true. The most interesting thing about this movie is the interaction of three generations of gay men, each with a different perspective. Every character in it is spot on great, even the muscle-bound boy friend who plays an almost apologetic, total jerk.  What makes this movie look so real is that it is. The story is based on the life of co-directors and life partners Jeff London and James Steven Handshoe. This movie doesn't promise ""happy-ever after,"" but it does show that there are second chances if you take them.

The last 20 minutes of the film really moves briskly and it is very touching, warm and sort of consoling, perhaps especially for older folks (ah, I've heard... actually I passed 50 long before this movie was ever made, and I definitely connect to the David character).

6657014,1,B00NI2CRQC,"Its Never Too Late to Fall in Love is the spoiler on the cover so my review reveals no surprises.

This is an autobiographical film about 2 men (Jeff London, also the writer, director and co-producer and James Handshoe, co-writer and co-producer) who met through a friend and fell in love. You have to know this or it gets confusing because the characters who play them in the film have different names.

The movie opens with David (Mel England plays Jeffs part) laying shirtless on a bed thinking aloud about his upcoming 50th birthday and how he regrets not accomplishing all that he expected; good job, home, husband, dogs, etc. and his failing directorial and producing movie career.

In the next scene David is talking with his boyfriend Greg, played by Nate Moore (Desert Blue). Greg is ambivalent and the 2 spend way too much time voicing their differences when Greg even bothers paying attention to David's whining. Anyone who has ever been there knows that is the beginning of the end of a relationship; if you cant find something in common to share and 1 person does not even care, failure is inevitable. All we are led to believe is that Greg lives in the Gym. I wanted this character to be fleshed-out just a little bit more. His total ambivalence indicated that something other than the gym was occupying his time outside this home (more like an apartment or condo) that he owned.

We then see David talking to his best friend (of just a few months) James (Peter Stickles, ShortBus, The Lair, The Trouble with Barry). He appears frustrated listening to David continually whine about his regrets. I could not blame him because by then, and up until half way into this film, that is all we heard and frankly, by that point, I was so turned off I could care less if David found a real life, love or anything. James suggests that David meet his Indiana cousin Shane (Tom Saporito (It Never Ends) who plays James Handshoes part. I wanted to see James' character fleshed-out as well. It was too one-dimensional and just read the lines emotionless.

James sets David and Shane up on facebook where they share some instant messages. Here is where the film speeds up and starts cutting corners from the real life relationship. What shows as just a few brief IMs, in real life is actually 30 days of 300 chats (revealed on the inside DVD cover)! What is also not shown in the film is that Shane had previously been to Lake Havasu, AZ but returned home to Indiana.  Meeting David would be a return trip for him at a point in his life where he too needed a change.

When they first meet in James apartment, Shane is obviously shy and nervous and David begins looking for differences between them, beginning with the 15 year age difference. Hey, when you are stuck so far down in self-pity, it just snowballs further down the hill. Hence why many people don't see the good things right in front of them.

David begins to think there may be a possibility here and consults with his older friend, Ace Lundon (playing himself) who states the obvious that age differences in relationships are not what they use to be and 15 years is not all that much of a difference. He also pointed out that David needs to stop thinking about his past failures and live for today and not worry about tomorrow. Common sense advice from the man who I credit with being the best actor in this film (and he is not even an actor)!

At this point, if you were not sick enough of David already, he still has his doubts. He is not sure if he likes Shane and he is not sure whether or not Shane is even gay. A bit confusing there as Davids gay best friend introduced them and even James is not sure whether or not his cousin is gay? And seriously, David did not know after a month's 300 IMs?

We next see David and Shane lying on a bed watching horror films, (something they both like but really not much upon which to base more than a movie buddy friendship) and David pops the gay question. And boom, out of nowhere they both get all teary-eyed and admit that they have never been happier. They kiss, strip off their clothes and jump into bed! Just like that and exactly that fast! A little bit of frontal (really just side) genital nudity here and not at all needed or even wanted. It detracted from what the writers were trying to say. In the commentary, someone mentions they were thinking about a ""shower scene"" and decided it was not needed. Neither was the brief genital shot! It gives the impression the director can't make up his mind what kind of film he wants and it does not fit with Shane's shy country boy image.

The main problem is that the first half of this movie dragged on way too long. I just wanted to put David (and myself) out of his misery. Then, it jumps to happily ever after out of the middle of nowhere. I was disappointed that there obviously was much more to it than that but it got skipped. Such is why I watched it again with commentary. Unfortunately, despite their 2 attempts at slowing down the movie to match the commentary, their comments were still 2-4 minutes ahead of it.

Overall, this has a sweet ending but the script was too top heavy, down-right depressing in the beginning and the ending was abrupt. There was a good performance from Nate Moore, especially during the breakup scene but his character needed more development. (The commentary says that his character was fiction and was added. There was no actual bad breakup with a previous boyfriend.) Also, someone in the commentary makes the point that everyone memorized their lines in a short period of time. Believe it! In most of the scenes the actors just repeated what they memorized; they showed little, if any, emotion. More important, there was no real chemistry between Shane and David. They just spoke their memorized lines at dinner, while playing monopoly and while on the bed. A quick jump into the sack does not make chemistry. Just a brief love scene there may have helped. Mel England was not at all believable, especially during the final scene with Shane. That could be because his entire part was just so monotone and blah. If he was really that happy there should have been some noticeable change in his attitude. It was like he was still apprehensive.

I am sure the real couple is very happy as evident from the wedding picture at the end and, as much as I really tried to like this movie because of its message of hope and finding love without all the drinking, drugging, sex parties and stereotypes (Davids character was stereotyped but on purpose), I gave it the benefit of the doubt and watched it twice. After the second, I wanted to trash it. I was way too disappointed after all the hype on the cover and the 5 star reviews.",1422403200,6,6726,4.516844700082169
6657015,5,B00NI2CRQC,I LOVE this film. Jeff London has again written a wonderful story of two very ordinary guys who have the best priorities in life. The cast is amazing. This film is very well acted. The characters have a great sense of familiarity to one's own life. The story of these two men will warm your heart and leave you with an exquisite positive feeling of joy and hope. This is a film you will want to watch and rewatch.

6657017,2,B00NI2CRQC,"A Tale of Two Films
Not the best, not the worst, it was just meh. Well honey, they don't write songs about yer meatloaf! Don't know why not. Meatloaves count, they can be very tasty. Yet to most people meatloaves are just OK. It's not steak, its not beet flavored tofu, its just meatloaf. we need more meatloaves! Its OK to be meatloaf! But: Who strives to be mediocre?

We strive to be the best. The greatest hero, the meanest villain, the sexiest hunk, some even strive to be the most pitiful victim. The operative term here is most, an extreme term. We are told to avoid extreme expressions. For if something is to be the most of anything, it must be compared to something else.  Comparison is the thief of joy, they tells us. You can't compare the two.

Doesnt anyone notice you can't make a decision without comparing? Without decisions, where are we?

OK! Meatloaf and making decisions have nothing to do with movies.
After watching two different videos, the urge is to share the feelings they each evoked and the way they went about their tasks. Can't help it, as a movie buff it's genetic.

Love or Whatever by Rosser Goodman was very different than Best Day Ever by Jeff London.

Both are presented as romantic comedies. At least that is what the write-ups say on the covers.

Where was I? Nope, belly laughs are not to be found in these movies. So maybe their forte is romance. That covers a multitude. Watching Love or Whatever fills one with that great feeling of love. Our hero is terribly wronged. Yet he finds the smile from an unexpected place. A most hansom and understanding man was waiting for him right where he never thought to look. We get carried along with our flawed hero as he is the last one to discover that he has fallen in love. We are warped in the warmth. We feel the anticipated cuddles, the joy. I don't care if that all sounds too much like a formula for you, it makes me feel good!

Best Day Ever takes a different approach. Our hero is facing his 50th birthday. Can you say: Mid life crisis? As he tries to juggle all of life's soul searching questions, his lover decides to leave. In short: the epitome of gay tragedy. To quote George Takei: Oh My!

This could have been a much better film. About 30 or 40 minutes in, I kept thinking how miserable I felt.  Most sane people with a remote control would have jumped channels a long time ago. Being a movie buff implied watching this to the end. Kind of like braving on through sex to get to the climax in-spite of the cramp growing your calf. You know, just get it over with already.  I knew (again from the cover) that all would be a happy ending. The tag line was It's never too late to fall in love.

Best Day has some good acting, some good lines, great production values. What it doesn't have, is an editor!  It is a writers film. More than an hour of a writer listening to his own words.  Great for him, not so great for the viewer. The happy ending, the point of the movie, the money shot only gets the final 5 minutes. One is left thinking this could have been great.  All they needed to do was condense the first hour down to five minutes, throw in some more funny awkwardness in the new courtship, and draw out the ecstasy of finding this awesome new love. Let us feel it.

Oh well, guess this will never be on the cover of the DVD will it? No, just the familiar terms. Have you ever noticed that without the terms witty or Zany we could never find anything funny? that makes us feel good? Or makes our sides hurt from laughing? Or makes us wet our pants? (-hum, let me think about that one.) For that matter what does Zany even mean? Is it full of zanes? Is it more zan-ful than others? That's it! Best Day Ever needs less angst and more zanes!",1420848000,5,3741,4.315263908701854

8678345,2,B00NI2CRQC,"I had great hopes for this film, given the many positive reviews. Unfortunately, the trailer is better than the film itself; if you've seen the trailer, there's no need to see the film. The film needs some heavy-handed editing because the script is redundant and the pacing is annoyingly slooooow. The acting isn't too bad, but the script doesn't give these actors much to work with, as the characters are fairly shallow and one-dimensional despite being based a on true story. I love movies that are character-driven, but I was bored with this film only 10 minutes in, and it didn't get much better after that. At first I thought it might turn out to have some of the same weight and humor as ""Love! Valour! Compassion!"" But it didn't, not by a long shot. Disappointing.",1482796800,,771,4.676470588235294

8678347,5,B00NI2CRQC,"I judge drama/romantic movies by how well they connect me to either my own emotions and experiences or those of others. This did both. Turning 50 was very challenging for me, and I can appreciate the truth of the movie's plot. The unfolding relationships moved me as well. The theme of age being a number reflects both the changing attitudes in our society and the general health of us older folks. We can start over again, or just add a new chapter, at any age. Personally, I liked the plot and found the actors believable. And I was especially touched by the bonus feature interview with Ace Lundon. So, Jeff, I'm taking you at your word and posting a good review that I hope makes your day. You deserve it for having made my day even better.",1477180800,2,744,4.437956204379562
