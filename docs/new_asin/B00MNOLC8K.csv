6590311,5,B00MNOLC8K,"Absolutely loved this! Spent all day watching this. My husband and I love and collect little bears, and it still took a little arm twisting to get him to buy this. He loved this! He laughed at Paddington's antics and adventures. This is fun for all ages and I  definitely recommend buying this!",1425772800,6,294,4.547169811320755
6590312,5,B00MNOLC8K,"With the popularity of Paddington in movie theaters, Mill Creek must have struck gold by releasing this DVD set of the little bear's two fine TV series set. The good news is that great value with excellent content.

The complete 1975 stop-motion British animated TV series is presented, along with three specials. It was produced by Filmfair, which also made the clever short cartoon series, ""Simon in the Land of Chalk Drawings"" that you may remember as a Captain Kangaroo cartoon segment or a Saturday Night Live spoof with Mike Myers.

Each of the 56 episodes of this series runs about five minutes and is unique in that Paddington and his immediate props are three-dimensional puppets while the other characters are ""replacement animation"" cutouts that had been draws in various poses, then cut out, positioned and replaced for each of its movements, which are minimal. The background all have a papery hand-drawn look as well, very much as if the book has come to life.

While these are very low-budget cartoons and the catchy theme music tends to become overused, they're not short on charm. The short length allows for very simple stories that are very faithful to the books but not necessarily word-for-word adaptations. Legendary British actor Michael Hordern (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, The Slipper and the Rose) is perfection as the narrator.

The three specials are about 20-25 minutes each. The highlight -- and reason alone to check out this set -- is the first special, Paddington Goes to the Movies, in which the little bear duplicates Gene Kelly's dance from ""Singin' in the Rain"" as the soundtrack plays!

The third disc contains 13 episodes from the 2008 Canadian/ French cel-animated series, previously aired on PBS and various cable channels. This series is more contemporary than the earlier one, with light jazz music that includes a larger variety of themes and several amusing songs. Each half hour show contains two segments that take several of Michael Bond's stories and expand upon them. Perhaps not as traditional at the 1975 series, this version is more akin to what currently runs on TV for young children.

This is a wonderful way to gear up for the day when the recent hit movie hits the store shelves.",1423785600,7,2243,4.952127659574468

6590315,5,B00MNOLC8K,"While I do recall reading a few of the books during my childhood, I don't recall ever watching the animated series, probably because it originally aired in the UK. The original series mixes in a blend of traditional animation and 3D animation, in which Paddington is a top-motion animated puppet. The episodes run for about 5 minutes each, except for the three specials from the 80s' that run between 21 and 25 minutes. Only the first thirteen episodes of The Adventures of Paddington Bear are featured on the 3rd disc. This series uses a more traditional 2D animation style with three segments per episode. Overall, I have enjoyed watching a handful of episodes on the Paddington Bear: Collector's Edition DVD. This is a great way to introduce the marmalade-craving Paddington to a new generation of fans.

6590316,5,B00MNOLC8K,"This was a gift for my great nephew, who lives quite a distance from us, he's only a year old, but hope he likes it when he is a little older.",1420675200,,142,3.6129032258064515
6590317,4,B00MNOLC8K,"Although the target content of the DVDs is cute & entertaining, the way it is structured is a bit awkward.  For example, on the first DVD there are 44 ""episodes"" (over 3-1/2 hours of episodes).  The problem is each ""episode""  is about 5 minutes long with about 15 seconds of opening credits and about 30 seconds of closing credits.  While that might not sound like excessive credits -- for each ""episode"" you are getting about 4-1/4 minutes of actual content and 3/4 minute of ""credits"".  The credits are basically identical.  The problem (in my opinion) is that after seeing the same credits for the 3rd or 4th time ... you really don't need or want to see them again & again.  For example, it takes about 30 minutes to watch the first 6 ""episodes"" -- in that 30 minutes -- you've seen those credits 6 times -- 4-1/2 minutes of credits.  By the end of the first DVD that's the same 45 seconds of credits repeated 44 times -- over half an hour of credits.  Be prepared to use the ""fast forward"" scan button a lot!

Also, keep in mind that the entertainment is targeted towards small children -- with the content of each ""episode"" limited to about 4-1/4 minutes -- there is obviously not a lot of in-depth plot or ""the moral of the story"" or ""life-lessons to be learned"" involved -- it's simple entertainment:  silly & cute & entertaining for the little ones ...",1420675200,21,1361,4.491869918699187

However, I have played other movies without the surround sound and no issues.  This definitely is a good memory of the classic Padington.  Don't look at the price and feel you are getting a great deal on the new Padington Movie.  You are not, these are classic Padington The Bear movies and there are plenty to watch.  We have definitely enjoyed watching as a family, despite poor sound quality",1444003200,,511,4.696629213483146
