8725100,5,B011TQQUX4,"Years ago, I think I had a VHS tape of this performance. My clearest memory of it was of a Rusalka so clearly a young teenager that it was amazing to hear her sing so vocally mature a role. But, unless there were two separate videos of this celebrated English National Opera production, I think it must have been a false memory. For although the late Australian soprano, Eilene Hannan, was as good an actress as she was a singer, there is no mistaking her for a teen. All the same, the memory is instructive, for it shows how completely I must have bought into director David Pountney's concept of the opera as a Freudian fable, beginning in the bedroom of a young girl just becoming aware of her own body and both terrified and excited by her romantic dreams.

The opening half hour is one of the most exciting opera sequences that I know. Rusalka wakes and looks at herself in a mirror. A swing descends from the ceiling and then raises her high above the stage. The stage floor opens to reveal a pool of water, around which the three Nymphs (here Rusalka's sisters) chase each other on a rocking-horse tricycle and a scooter. The Water Goblin (a splendid Rodney Mccann) enters in a wheel-chair, denying him normal movement on the alien territory of dry land. When Rusalka, following her famous Song to the Moon, calls for the witch Jezibaba to help her become human so that she can meet her Prince and return his love, who should come in but a stern Governess figure (Ann Howard), with more than a touch of the dominatrix. To help her cast her spells, the stuffed toys in the cupboard come alive; they will appear again in the scenes with the Gamekeeper (Edward Byles) and Kitchen Boy (Fiona Kimm), a brilliant piece of slapstick that, though in a different style, is a necessary break from the intense romanticism of the rest.

Rusalka gets her wish; the thick bandage wound around her ankles is unspooled, and she is able to walk on two feet. The back wall of the bedroom opens to a moonlit cloudscape and the Prince appears. Here, I was initially disappointed, for John Treleaven, though as fine a singer as anyone in the cast, is rather pudgy in the face (a little like Oliver Reed in Women in Love), and not every young girl's idea of Prince Charming. [In hindsight, I wonder if Pountney might have thought of going really Freudian and making him a father figure, though this would need to be established more clearly.] But when his first scene with her in Act II almost turns into a rape, I could see some advantages to this casting; it is a gripping moment, especially with the arrival on the scene of the Foreign Princess (Phyllis Cannan), Rusalka's haughty rival. [Or a mother? Here again, there were Freudian implications that Pountney chose not to make explicit.] And, as I say, Treleaven sings beautifully; the final scene, when he repents the error of his ways and dies in Rusalka's arms is beautiful, from both singers.

So what's not to like? Fine though Mark Elder is leading the ENO players, it goes without saying that this is not the Metropolitan Opera version, with that fabulous orchestra, brilliant conducting by Yannick N&eacute;zet-S&eacute;guin, and singers of the caliber of Ren&eacute;e Fleming and Piotr Beczala. Also, it is sung in English -- but the translation by Rodney Blumer flows easily while still preserving the characteristic rhythms of the Czech. Watching them both back to back, I simply find the Pountney a lot more interesting; the Met version is beautiful in a picturesque but utterly static way, and both the sets and I'm afraid the lead singer show their age. Furthermore, the Met has none of the unexpected Pountney touches, such as the white-clad guests descending on swings for the Polonaise, or the bridal chorus shortly after, which he makes into an allegory of the loss of virginity. Given this kind of imagination, I am only sorry that he did not go further, playing more with the Freudian implications of the ""parental"" roles and, more importantly, returning us to the bedroom frame at the end, rather than simply having Rusalka walk offstage, trapped in a fairy tale that has inexplicably become real.

But right or wrong, these are ideas and reactions, actual interpretive thoughts. Pountney has got me thinking about the opera, actively engaging with it rather than passively watching. Seeing the Met simulcast a year or so ago, I was so bored, so completely disengaged, that I left at the second intermission. That would certainly not have been the case here.",1484006400,,4519,4.738246505717916
