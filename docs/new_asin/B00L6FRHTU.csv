6473587,5,B00L6FRHTU,"I have been a longtime follower of Karen Noonan, since we were fortunate enough to have her here in Greer, South Carolina for 5 years. Karen's videotape is a beautiful blend of yoga and meditation and exercises that target all parts of the body while stimulating organs internally and delivering fantastic results and emotional release with a sense of renewal afterwards. This is my ""go-to"" tape when I can't get to the mat at a studio. Karen's teachings are superior to any yoga teacher I have ever encountered, after 15 years of practice. A key part of Karen's skill set is her ability to help you avoid injury. While practicing with Karen, I actually healed my chronic back pain. I know anyone who purchases this DVD will reap similar rewards and seek out great yoga teachers....not 'gym yoga'. Now I just want more Karen videos!",1414886400,6,832,4.744827586206896

8664137,4,B00L6FRHTU,"I love this dvd, she refocuses my mind and the yoga positions are awesome. I do wish there was a bit more time to meditate in between moves but I feel like if I knew the moves well enough to just close my eyes and do them when she told us to change positions it would be better! So I think if you memorize some it is really perfect.",1511481600,,332,3.8260869565217392

8664140,1,B00L6FRHTU,"This is the worst DVD production I've ever seen. This woman might be a good yoga teacher, but I could not tell because the audio sounded like she was talking into a tin can. In the other room. I could not understand her. The more I turned up the volume, the more distorted and muffled it sounded. I would have returned it for a refund but I had already thrown out the packaging.",1459814400,,378,4.191780821917808
