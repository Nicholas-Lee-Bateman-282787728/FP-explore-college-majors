I just wish the whole Elephant Show series was available on DVD...
Good price, just as described, quick shipper.",1395100800,3,211,4.578947368421052
2559242,5,B000FBHCCS,This was borrowed so many times it got misplaced.  I was so happy to be able to find it again for my latest granddaughter.  I am giving it to her next week on her 3rd Birthday and I am sure she will love it ad much as all the other 11 did.,1369872000,,239,3.576923076923077

2559244,5,B000FBHCCS,Just as I remembered! A huge part of my childhood that I'm so happy to share. I hope they release more on DVD!!,1359331200,,111,3.869565217391304
2559245,5,B000FBHCCS,"I grew up with this trio and want my kids to experience the same.  My toddler received this DVD for Christmas and I was a little hesitant because he is so picky with videos.  The second it came on, he was hooked.  My friend was over and we found ourselves being glued to the video as well.

SL&B haven't changed a bit and their skits are still fun.  The colors are vivid and the music is fun.  It's hard to find kids shows that aren't annoying.  Imagination Movers and Fresh Beat Band are fun but seem to appeal more to older kids that can understand what they are talking about.  My son only enjoys certain songs from those two bands so he won't watch much else from them.  This video is skit after skit and song after song.  My 6 month old even enjoys it.  Bram still entertains the same way, Sharon is still an excellent singer and Lois is still a lot of fun to watch.  There is enough video to get a few things done around the house or to catch a good break while your kids are being entertained.

The only thing I found annoying is the elephant is completely different and talks the way Barney characters do.  The good thing is that it's not in every skit.  I could listen to this soundtrack for hours as I did when I was little.  Grab these videos while you can because they don't tour as much as they did and don't make many videos.",1326067200,,1339,4.171875
2559246,4,B000FBHCCS,"I was looking for episodes from the older TV show, ""The Elephant Show"", but could not tell from the description given which show this DVD came from.  It turns out that it is from the newer ""Skinnamarink TV"" show and includes three episodes.  This works for my purposes, although I still prefer the older show and will continue to try to find episodes from it.  My 4 year old friend (for whom I bought this DVD) really enjoys these episodes and we sing the songs together often.",1302912000,5,477,4.459770114942529
2559247,5,B000FBHCCS,"My two oldest children ages 22 and 24 grew up with Sharon, Lois & Bram!  Now my 2, 3 & 4 year old are watching it too!  They love it in the car... you can hear a pin drop when this is played.  Great for all ages... My 8 year old sings along too!",1276473600,5,245,3.5
2559248,5,B000FBHCCS,I used to watch this show all the time growing up!! I wish they still had something like this show on today. I think my favorite part of the show was the end when they sang the goodbye song...I am 25yrs old and can still remember almost the entire song!!!,1267142400,9,255,4.12

2559250,5,B000FBHCCS,"Sharon Lois and Bram are amazing at being fun and engaging to kids without the overstimulation.
