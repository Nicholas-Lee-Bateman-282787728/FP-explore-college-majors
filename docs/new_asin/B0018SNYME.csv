8270973,2,B0018SNYME,"Jill (Brianne Davis), who is blind, inherits a manor from an aunt she never met. She goes out to the manor and stays there with two friends while ghosts and ""imprints"" haunt the house.

The film was rather boring and at no time scary. C. Thomas Howell has a minor role near the end. Made for TV quality.

Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.",1516406400,,340,4.296875
8270974,4,B0018SNYME,"I picked this up when I was admittedly ""killing time,"" and discovered a strangely haunting story, excellent characters, and just enough spookiness (without all the in-your-face special effects we're usually treated with). This plot runs on story, not ghosts.  It's ""something different,"" and if you're looking for something subtle, this one is a good investment.",1455408000,,362,5.581818181818182
8270975,4,B0018SNYME,"While this is a low-budget film, I would place it in the ""B+"", not the ""B"" list. The actors, while unknown, are better than many well-known ones. The story is well-written and well shot.
While it is about a haunted house, it is not a horror story, and there is only a very small amount of blood at the end.
The special effects are not CGI, but done in-camera, and done very well, with soft focus and skilled use of light and shadow.
Expect ""suspense"" rather than horror, and you will probably enjoy it.",1352505600,,502,4.351063829787234
8270976,3,B0018SNYME,"I watched this movie fully prepared for a cheap, trashy shocker of the kind you usually find in the direct-to-video bargain bin. Yes, the movie is incredibly low-budget, but it makes the brave choice to focus on characters and story over effects and horror. What they managed to create is an enjoyable ghost story/light mystery that was a nice evening diversion. The cast is amatueur but likable, and the film even manages to sqeeze a bit of spookiness from its minimal effects. Certainly a cut above most movies of its kind.",1302134400,2,525,4.78021978021978
8270977,3,B0018SNYME,"This is an interesting story despite the shortage of professional actors.  It almost appears to have a religious agenda of some sort. It would be fine for young, vulnrable pre-teens who are home-schooled and not used to regular horror films. In short, it is absolutely safe for family viewing which is what I suspect the film-makers had in mind.",1228694400,,345,4.8474576271186445
8270978,4,B0018SNYME,This movie was not a horror/slasher movie but a really good B movie with a message that was delivered in a unique way.  I highly recommend this movie.  The actors were good and the settings were amazing.,1218153600,2,203,4.45945945945946
8270979,1,B0018SNYME,"I am a huge fan of B movie slasher, horror and suspense flicks.  This movie was terrible and boring.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT!!",1216944000,3,125,4.166666666666667
