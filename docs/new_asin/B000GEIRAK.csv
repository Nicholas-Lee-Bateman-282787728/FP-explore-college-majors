2606182,4,B000GEIRAK,"It's a good starter for people looking for dance aerobic videos.  I think after not too long, it will start to get too easy though.",1166313600,2,131,4.24
2606183,3,B000GEIRAK,"I love the 10 minute soultion series. I have two pilates dvds and the toning dvd. All three are excellent. So, I bought this one as well. The instructor is really cute....she has a good time. But she moved too fast for me to pick up the steps.  They seem simple enough but graceless-but-hopeful-dancerercisers like me need one more set that is slower to learn the moves on. I think repetition would help. This is my fifth viewing and I just can't seem to get one step before she's on to the next one and ""Hey let's add this and turn around and ....""  she was three steps ahead of me most of the time.  If anyone out there can recommend a dancercise aerobic DVD that I could learn from I'd really appreciate it.

I get so much out of home exercise DVD's and thought maybe I'd stumbled on to one that would be for clumsters like me. Not yet....maybe I can learn on another DVD & come back to this one...",1164844800,11,901,4.22093023255814
2606184,5,B000GEIRAK,"I have 3 of the other 10 minute solution workouts and I enjoy those.  This one is not exception.  It's fun, gets you moving and sweating.  Also the moves are easy to pick up as well.  Definite recommendation!",1163635200,89,208,4.394736842105263
2606185,5,B000GEIRAK,"This was a really fun workout. The time flew by and I didn't even feel like looking at the clock, which I usually do with other workouts. The instructor knew how to cue and that helped. Admittedly, this is not a ""play the video and workout immediately"", it took me several times to finally get the footwork down, but it was a fun process which got my heartrate up and made me sweat.",1162857600,8,382,4.2465753424657535
2606186,5,B000GEIRAK,"This workout is both fun and simple to learn, and yet provides good cardio exercise.  I highly recommend it!",1161907200,3,108,4.684210526315789
2606187,4,B000GEIRAK,"I wasn't sure whether I would like this workout--as I've become a more advanced exerciser, I've tended to move away from exercise DVDs which offer short segments, as I have found that these usually aren't intense enough to provide me with a good workout.  Therefore, I was pleasantly suprrised upon trying Fat Blasting Dance Mix a discovering that my heart rate was in my target fat-burning zone for nearly the entire workout!  Plus, the moves were fun and relatively easy to pick up after a few times through.

Overall, this video reminded me a bit of Dance Off the Inches: Calorie Blasting Party.  Instructor Jennifer Galardi is a bit similar in style to the instructor from that video, although more low-key, which I prefer.  Also, rather than teaching the moves at three different tempos as in the Dance Off series (which I didn't like because it causes my heart rate to drop), Jennifer teaches by building on different aspects of each move.  For example, first she'll teach you a simple leg move such as a step out, then she'll incorporate a bit more of a dancey feel, and finally, she'll add arms to complete the exercise.  In each of the five segments, she teaches the moves in an add-on style, eventually taking it from the top so that you can run through the entire sequence (but because each segment is short and there are only five or so total moves, it never feels like the combinations are overly long).

One of the best things about this DVD is that it is programmable--ie, there is a menu which allows you to mix and match any of the five segments to create your own customized workout, which I loved.  Three of the segments are cardio-focused--Simple Slimmer, Calorie Meltdown, Fat Blasting Party--while the last two are more toning-oriented--Butt & Thigh Blaster, Ab Attack--although still intense enough to produce a cardio effect.  The cardio segments gradually get more intense, with SS containing the most basic moves, CM taking it up a notch, and FBP adding a bit more impact with some hops and jumps.  Both toning segments were performed entirely in a standing position, pairing some traditional strength training moves (eg, lunges, crunches) with dancey choreography, which I found to be fun and different.

I enjoyed this video, especially the programmable aspect and the unique, dancey toning segments.  I would definitely recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys dance workouts and who is able to pick up choreography with a slightly-beyond-basic complexity level.

Update 12/11/06:  The more I use this video, the more I like it!  It's one of the only dance videos I've ever owned which gets my heart rate up quickly and keeps it there.  I find myself mixing and matching the various segments often.  If I could change my rating to 5 stars, I would--very highly recommended!",1156550400,492,2801,4.848739495798319
2606188,4,B000GEIRAK,"Jennifer Galardi is an outgoing and motivating instructor and she makes you feel like you're having fun and actually happy to be exercising.  You can buy this workout already on other online sites and I've had it for a week now and I'm really enjoying it.

Three of the 10 minute segments are aerobic and one is butt and thigh and the last segment is an ab workout.  The cardio ones are challenging but short (which I guess is good if you are wanting to get fit or increase fitness rather than maintain fitness).  Obviously you can do all together or mix and match.  The way the dvd is set up, you can arrange to play them in any order.  The routines are all very dancy but yet not tricky and so this is very fun to do.

I recommend this if you are wanting to boost your fitness, but if you are fit already, you may not find this challenging enough.  It's cued very well and enjoyable to do.  Jennifer is a good instructor.",1154131200,192,923,4.228571428571429

2606240,3,B000GEIRAK,"Found out I was not meant to be a dancer with this workout. The moves were very fast, hard to follow, and I got so  discouraged from not being able to follow it that I gave up on doing this workout.",1479859200,,198,3.8292682926829267

2606261,5,B000GEIRAK,"I really enjoyed this DVD. Its definitely for beginners or people who are super uncoordinated. I tried doing Zumba one time and I fumbled through the entire class, then never went back. This is a fun, fast moving workout. I felt my heart rate working hard the entire time, for the reviewers who said theirs didn't increase, they must not have been putting much effort into it. The time goes by fast, I wasn't watching the clock waiting for time go by",1463443200,,450,4.5
2606262,5,B000GEIRAK,"This is my fourth 10-minute solution DVD.  I would put it as an equal top favorite with ""Dance your body thin"". Easy to learn dance moves that get you in shape.",1463097600,,160,4.161290322580645
2606263,2,B000GEIRAK,"This DVD was boring. i have a Fitbit w/ a heart rate monitor but it hardly got my heart rate up. Even though I'm 50lbs overweight, it was way too easy for me. Maybe bc I'm used to doing Zumba that this wasn't intense enough for my body. And the music was boring too.  But I highly recommend  ""10minute solution- high intensity interval training"" its awesome-  you will definitely feel the burn and get your heart up in a very short period of time!!",1462320000,,448,4.309523809523809

2606285,5,B000GEIRAK,Love this dvd. Great way to exercise that really gets your heart rate up.  I like that there are 10 minute segments and i can just do 1 or 2 if thats all i have time for that day.,1454803200,,179,3.58974358974359
2606286,4,B000GEIRAK,Its a fast paced dance mix and if your my age (older) it might be to fast to begin with. Lots of fun to try.,1454457600,,108,3.36
2606287,3,B000GEIRAK,I think something like this is completely subjective.  I'm in my 70's and found this to be too much for me.  That doesn't mean it wouldn't be great for someone else.,1449360000,,165,4.290322580645161
2606288,3,B000GEIRAK,"After reading the reviews of many different dance DVD's, I settled on this one. Some people stated the dance moves were a bit difficult, but I have other dance/aerobic DVD's and I used to do Jazzercise consistency for several years, so I thought I could handle it. I was wrong. I found the moves very difficult, and I spent so  much time trying to copy them, I never really got my heart rate up. I used it a couple of times, then gave up. Unless you are fairly familiar with dance, I would avoid this DVD. You'd get more exercise just going for a walk rather than trying to learn these moves.",1449187200,,592,4.285714285714286
2606299,2,B000GEIRAK,"The DVD was fine, but I'm not coordinated enough to keep up with a lot of it so haven't been using it.  If you like dancing (and are pretty good at picking up the moves) you'll probably love it.",1446508800,,194,3.9743589743589745

2606306,1,B000GEIRAK,"I love the idea of 10-minutes work-outs so that I get my heart rate moving for even a little bit in the mornings before work, but after using this workout video once, I was confused by its high ratings.

I kept waiting to get to the part of the workout where my heart rate would go up but never did - the workout I selected (can't remember which segment it was) was basically just stepping side to side with some arm movements added in at the end.  It wasn't really dancing or a workout in my opinion, and if I am only going to work-out for 10 minutes, I want it to be an INTENSE 10 minutes, and this was not it.",1436313600,,612,4.008196721311475

2606323,2,B000GEIRAK,"Some reviews I read said that she was too hard to follow if you never really danced.  I would counter that if you have ever danced, her routines are far too easy and boring.

I picked up the routines easily, and it provides a good cardio workout.  Between the five workouts on this DVD, your whole body will get some movement.

Love that it is broken into 10 min segments so that each time I exercise I can pick and choose what works in the time slot I have available.  I continue to use this several times a week and I've had this dvd for almost a year.  I'm actually pretty surprised by that since most exercise dvds don't hold my interest.  I like the dance choreography.  It's not that complicated, but just challenging enough.  I also like that the instructor isn't trying to be all sexy and ""clubby.""  I've gotten a few other dvds that I basically have to turn off before the first segment is over because the instructor is SO annoying.  Not the case here. There is only one segment that I haven't really used yet and that's only because it works the lower body on a floor mat and I do my own separate thing for that part.",1406505600,6,894,4.2485207100591715

But I do really like the fact that they use repetition in showing you the steps to learn.  I also liked that each little segment - there are five - is broken down into 10 minutes each.

Being a mother I only have so much time in a day for myself so 10 minute workouts are perfect for me. I favor the Bun and Thigh Blaster over all the other ones. To be honest its the only one I do but its worth the price just for that one workout. Really easy to follow along to and keep up!,1400112000,,397,3.627906976744186

to add cardio to their routine.",1399161600,,287,4.035087719298246

As of this past Saturday, I have lost 75 pounds.  Before going off the diet back in 2011, I had lost 80 pounds.

However, she has a lot of energy and appears to know what she's doing, but did not show slower step by step instruction. She needs to realize not everyone is in fit condition.  That's why we get the DVDs and mine is sitting on the shelf probably going to send it back. This is not what I would consider a workout program for a beginner.",1379462400,4,482,4.127659574468085
2606466,4,B000GEIRAK,"I found this video a few years ago when it was on Netflix Streaming (sadly they no longer seem to have workout videos) and this one was my favorite. It has five 10 minute segments. I have used the first two (cardio dance workouts) on occasion when I can't make it to the gym but still want to do a little something. They take a little while to get used to the moves, but all in all they're a good backup. The lower body workout bothers my hips, so I don't usually use it.

However, the last segment (Ab Blaster) is amazing! Most ab workouts have you laying on the floor, which is fine, but it severely inhibits your range of motion. This video does the ab routine just like the others as a sort of dance with several moves that you learn and add to one another. It mostly centers on isolations (moving your chest without moving your hips) which not only works your abs, but your whole core and back! In only 10 minutes I can really feel that all of my core muscles have been worked hard without anything really burning (a side effect of most crunch related exercises).

After only a few weeks of using the video along with my other exercise routines I found that I had much more definition in my abs, and a measurable difference in the size of my waist. I loved it so much that I went looking for it and finally bought it for myself!",1378598400,2,1333,4.223529411764706
2606467,2,B000GEIRAK,"I was looking for something along the lines of the old Jane Fonda cardio dance workouts, but this isn't anywhere close.  It's not much fun, and she needs to do a warmup section and a cool down and stretch section, otherwise this DVD is fairly useless to me.  I liked the first one and the next to last workouts the best, but even those were only okay.  Pretty much a waste of money.",1378252800,,382,4.205479452054795
2606478,2,B000GEIRAK,Moves are too complicated and too involved - geared more toward a younger crowd or at least those who are already familiar with this type of work out - disappointing for 40-50 year olds - my body doesn't swivel and gyrate like hers!,1378252800,2,232,4.4186046511627906
2606479,1,B000GEIRAK,"This workout DVD is totally disappointing - not a real workout and not a dance DVD either. I am a total total exercise beginner - and this doesn't do anything long enough to be worth it. The cardio moves are not enough to get you going and in between, they stop to do some (standing still) moves so you aren't even getting a full 10 minutes and then there is two minutes of cool down. and then you have to start all over to get to the next one. So you aren't getting much a work out. The music was good, though, and she is very upbeat and all, but if you want some serious dance with cardio, or vice versa, this is not going to do it for you.",1376870400,,642,3.9461538461538463

2606482,5,B000GEIRAK,"After I had my second baby and got the go ahead to work out, I danced to this workout video nearly everyday, and after getting all of the routines down (easy to do with Jennifer's instruction!), I was doing on average 4 out of the 5 10-minute segments.  I particularly enjoy the last segment designated for abs.  After a while, I was in well enough shape that I didn't find the first segment challenging, and it didn't feel like I was working out, so I just did the last four.  I ate right, and did this workout up until Halloween (5 months since starting), when I wore a tight fitting TRON costume and rocked it. I don't actually own the video; it was on Netflix instant streaming for a very long time but was taken off last year for who knows what reasons.  I became pregnant with my third child at the time, so it wasn't a huge deal since I tend to not exercise THAT intensely, but I was certainly sad to see it go.

Now that I need to kick the baby weight out the door again, I can promise you I'll be ordering this VERY soon.

It's a little silly at times, since dance moves age so rapidly.  But it's upbeat and fun and I didn't get bored with it.  So if anyone is looking for a good workout to blast that baby weight off the healthy way, it worked for me!",1376006400,,1261,4.118367346938776

2606484,5,B000GEIRAK,I had a baby and some set backs. 5 months post baby I started this. It was great and I did all of the routines instead of just the 10 minutes. They were easy and easy to learn. I also tried her faster moving video a few days later. Once you master this you should move up to challenge yourself. I would buy this,1374451200,,311,3.875
2606485,5,B000GEIRAK,This video was just what I was looking for--challenging with fun dance moves that have good instruction without a lot of high impact that kills my knees.

Some people have complained that the dance moves are too complicated and they do not give you enough instruction. THAT is what your rewind button is for. Take the time to learn the moves and then it is fun AND you can turn off the sound and play your own tunes. With 10 minute solutions I don't have an the time excuse any more and I love the fact that I can target my abs without having to get down on the floor.

Others like that she builds on each move, teaching the feet first, then arms, then a variation. I prefer to see the whole thing at once and learn it once rather than learn 4 separate variations.

I'm now (6 weeks later) doing 30 minutes 4-5 days a week and using light hand weights for all but the ab workout.  My body is getting nicely toned and I feel great! Thanks for this awesome workout DVD!,1360108800,,551,4.269230769230769
2606561,5,B000GEIRAK,This is a great easy work out. It is very easy to learn and already my abs are sore. I am a new mother and i was looking for a fun workout that would help me loose my lower after baby belly fat!,1359849600,,194,3.5348837209302326
2606562,3,B000GEIRAK,"The 10 minutes go by very fast!  I was surprised that at the end I had worked up a sweat and heartrate.  It is good to do with so little time available, but I had to add some workout time to see a difference, 10 minutes per day wasn't enough.",1359676800,,242,3.82
2606563,5,B000GEIRAK,"I don't exercise much at all, but we all know how important it is.  This is definitely for beginners only.  They are 10 minute segments.  Sometimes I will say to myself, just do one 10 minute segment, and I end up doing 2 or 3 instead.  The host is likeable, the moves are easy to get after a few tries, and you break a nice sweat.  You aren't too sore after doing the dance moves, but you after a few faithful sessions you can tell the difference.",1359417600,,448,4.103448275862069

2606578,4,B000GEIRAK,I am not good at sticking with an exercise routine but I love to dance! I bought this and several other exercise dance dvds at the same time. Sure makes working out more fun....,1354924800,,177,4.235294117647059
2606579,4,B000GEIRAK,"As I've mentioned in other reviews. I'm home workout DVD fiend. I have shelves of different workout DVD's. This is one I've had for about 6 years and it's still in my workout rotation. It's cute, simple and fun.

Just the title alone ""10 Minute Solutions"" sounds too easy, right? But every time I cue this baby up and start dancing along, I work up a sweat. And I always start it thinking I'll just do one, maybe two of the segments, tops. But I always stick it out to the end because it's too much fun. Jennifer Galardi and her two dance fitness buddies are adorable. She's motivational, peppy and easy to follow.

The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that the cool down section actually cuts into the 10 minutes of each section, so it feels like a little bit of a rip off. But I guess you can always look at it as interval training as it does have that ""raise your heart rate, lower it, then raise it again"" effect. But I also find the cool downs to be overly basic. But that's most work out DVD's IMO.

One more thing, if music is a big deal to you, you're not going to like this selection much. You hardly even notice the music because it's so low and so boring.

However, overall I believe you'll love this DVD and not even realize you're working out.",1354406400,,1262,4.202479338842975
2606580,5,B000GEIRAK,"Jennifer Galardi has such an effective teaching style and great energy, which makes doing these routines over and over again possible and still fun after a many times.

I believe this DVD to probably be best suited for beginners to medium fitness levels to be fully satisfied, which I am. You can't blame the instructor if you have 2 left feet and just need to be patient to learn the simple steps but you will work up a sweat if you put the effort into it.",1354320000,,397,4.102564102564102

I thought dance could be within my scope of capabilities. I liked that it was a 10 minute workout as my asthma limits my workout time.

I found the tape too fast paced and the moves were not easy to pick up. Not all of us are dancers. Maybe more attention to the introduction of the steps would be nice.

I am still searching for the dance exercise tape that works for me!",1353456000,,500,4.03030303030303

I really wanted to love this DVD. But the instructor goes so fast, it is impossible to follow the steps. Now I am no slouch. I took dance classes for 8 years in my young days, and though it's been many years, and I've never been the best at following choreography within 4 seconds of being shown a series of steps, I DO have the ability to catch on. I suppose if I watch/use the DVD every day, I'd eventually get it. I've tried 7 or 8 times now, and I'm still not getting it all. I'll keep trying because it's a decent workout. But there must be others out there more appropriate for the out-of-shape boomers.",1353196800,,766,4.289655172413793

2606599,3,B000GEIRAK,"I really liked the thought of having a work out that was fun, but it really didn't work that way. Its a little frustrating to me. The moves are prettyy easy, so I picked them up fine but to put it all together you have to listen to what the instrutors saying as shes moving and apply it at the same time she does and I found it complicated. Im 23, good dancer, and cordinated so I thought this would be a breeze. but I was wrong. I had to back it up like 10 times just to get it all together. One of the reasons I got this was because it said 10 minute workout and im a mom so I don't have alot of time... So from having to keep backing it up, a 10 minute work out became a 45 min workout lol but its pretty fun as long as you don't get frustrated easily. Im just going to keep working at it and Im sure it will get easier...",1345852800,,825,3.7745664739884393

I've done a ton of the Crunch and 10-Minute Solution videos, and they are my two favorite instructors.  I always love Jennifer's choreography.  It may seem difficult at first, but you will learn to love all the routines.  If you're completely uncoordinated, you may not enjoy her dance videos as much as the 10-Minute Solutions.",1345507200,,467,5.012987012987013
2606601,5,B000GEIRAK,Jennifer Galardi gives excellent cues and instructions.  The 10 minute solution dvds means that you have time every day to do at least one routine.,1343865600,,147,4.88
2606602,1,B000GEIRAK,"It was all about teens and twenty-something people---both in music and clothing and dance steps---no mix of different ages, or weights,and the ad didn't describe the music...I hate it when all the people exercising don't look like they need to!",1343001600,,244,5.125
2606603,4,B000GEIRAK,"I really like this DVD workout!  It's actually fun and effective.  There are 5 different 10 minute workouts that you can choose from and mix and match.  I usually do 2-3 at a time, but if I'm in a real time crunch, I can just do 1 and still get my heart rate up.

I have to say Jennifer Galardi is quite possibly the least annoying DVD fitness instructor I've ever run across.  She's ridiculously cute and incredibly likeable.  I have many fitness DVD's that I've given up on because the instructor grates on me so much I can't make myself listen and the DVD gathers dust on a shelf.  I don't have that issue with JG.  I actually look forward to hearing her every day.

This is great for people of beginning to mid-level fitness.  I think if you're a hard core fitness buff, it might be a little slow for you, but if you're just starting out or looking for something different to toss into your routine, this is a good option.

The only thing I wish the DVD had that doesn't (and what kept it from getting 5 stars) is an explanation and practice set of the dance moves.  If you are like me and have absolutely no rhythm (but still love to dance!), a walk through would be helpful.  I've been doing this DVD for a few weeks and I still couldn't get some of the moves because, well, no rhythm and the fact that there's no real step-by-step.  I did pause the DVD one day and then pushed the FF button, which moved it in slow-mo and found this incredibly helpful.  I don't feel like such a goof doing these in my LR.  Of course I wouldn't let anyone watch me do this DVD because it would be mortifying.",1341878400,,1598,4.207236842105263
2606604,4,B000GEIRAK,It's a great dance exercise tape for beginners or for people who don't dance a lot.  The variety is fun and easy.,1341360000,,113,4.136363636363637

2606606,5,B000GEIRAK,"I am 33 with two young children ages 3 and 5, and I really need to lose some weight and get in shape.  I want to be able to run and play with my kids without feeling winded, and also want to lead by example in teaching them a healthy eating and activity lifestyle.  The healthy eating part is easy for me.  I love vegetables and flavorful healthy foods, and so do my kids.  My problem is that I HATE exercise.  And I really want to change that.

It's not in my budget to join a gym or organized classes, so I've been walking, jogging, and trying to find workout videos that are fun.  I thought I would enjoy a dance workout video to add some cardio into my routine.  I tried one of the 'Dancing with the Stars' videos and found the moves complicated and hard to follow for someone without a background in dance, and the Zumba DVDs are a bit pricey.  I also tried a 'Brazil Butt Lift' video, to which I DID work up a sweat, but the moves were a bit hard to follow, and the trainer Leandro Carvalho was so flamboyant and ridiculous that it was distracting.

After doing a search on Netflix, I found Jennifer Galardi.  I tried this video, the '10 Minute Solution: Fat Blasting Dance Mix' and I LOVED IT.

Things I love about this video ... bear with me and my often politically-incorrect way of describing things:

-  The workout is divided into 10 minute segments, each it's own individual workout routine.  You can do just one if you're short on time, or do a combination of several routines.
- Jennifer and her 'friends' wear a different set or outfits for each routine, which makes it easier to know where you are in the video to fast-forward or back when viewing on something other than a DVD player, such as Netflix.
-  Jennifer does a great job breaking down the moves.  It was easy to follow her routine and I was never confused about any particular move.  She will show you a move slowly with just feet, then show you what to do with your arms, then speed it up a little, then show you how to maximize your workout by adding in a little more flair to the basic steps, flair that makes it DANCING, not just working out.
- The dance moves here are great for a novice.  It's a nice mix of relatively simple moves that don't take long to master.  Someone who already has experience in dance workout styles may want to look for something more advanced.
-  Although the video is easy to follow, you really do get a nice workout.  After two 10-minute sessions in a row, I'd worked up a heckofa sweat!
- Jennifer is fun and energetic, but not in an obnoxious way.  I found her to be upbeat and motivating without me wanting to reach through the TV and do her bodily harm!
-  She is trim and athletic and very pretty, but again, not in an obnoxious or intimidating way.  She looks like the nice girl who lives next door, not a supermodel with a boob-job, or one of the she-male weightlifting women.  She's someone I might be friends with, and I like that.

Thanks, Jennifer!  I'll be using this video often, and look forward to trying some of the videos she has done.",1339977600,5,3064,4.290940766550523
2606607,4,B000GEIRAK,"I got this DVD to see if I can break a sweat and maybe loose a few pounds.
Within the first 5 minutes I had alrdy broken a sweat! It's a bit hard to follow at first, I had to keep rewinding it. It's pretty good for some cardio; I had a full work out before the entire DVD was over. I would recommend it to someone that is maybe looking to tone up and is good at following physical instructions and doesn't mind breaking a major sweat.
As for me, I'm totally going to continue using this DVD. I'm sure it'll take me a week or two to get the hang of her moves but it's definitely doable.",1339459200,,585,3.9243697478991595

I currently do Zumba and wanted to have something at home to do.  I found the moves a bit difficult to pick up immediately, but the routines are repeated and extended so you eventually get it (sort of).  It just gives you something to look forward to the next time you do the dvd.  I did break a sweat and will definitely use this dvd when I am in a time crunch or not.",1337126400,,540,4.0
2606621,5,B000GEIRAK,If you love to exercise by dancing you will love this DVD.  The instructions are easy to follow since Jennifer starts off showing the steps slowly before increasing the tempo.  This is the best one I have ever used.,1332374400,2,215,4.487179487179487
2606622,2,B000GEIRAK,"This is the second video with Jennifer Galardi that I have tried, and I will probably not choose her videos again. Galardi is a great dancer but she is not the right instructor for me.

Galardi's videos definitely make you sweat. Unfortunately, I find myself sweating more from trying to follow the moves than from the workout itself. The moves themselves are simple, but her transitions are very awkward for someone who doesn't dance a lot. Galardi does sometimes choose moves that are a little more complicated than a 10 minute work out should have, which I found frustrating. She is also inconsistent. While some moves are too complicated, she over simplifies others (mostly to fit them to the beat). I lost my balance throughout the video during moves that had awkward, standing-on-one-foot pauses.

The other thing that disturbs me about her videos is that I always experience muscle pain in my calves after I finish her workouts. She doesn't warm them up or cool them down properly for at least half of these workout segments.

With practice and better coordination, I think this could be a great workout, especially for those who are looking for quick in-between work outs. Still, I would not recommend this video to someone.",1330387200,,1232,4.885167464114833
2606623,5,B000GEIRAK,"I really like this video. I wanted to get some DVDs so I could get in shape and I figured that I'd try this one. I really like that it's only 10 minutes long; it takes away my excuse that I don't have time to exercise. Plus, if you only have a little bit of stamina, 10 minutes is the perfect length.

The dances aren't too difficult. There are only a few moves that I don't know how to do, so I make up my own thing. It's mostly hip hop style dancing. I should also mention that this is a good DVD if, like me, you have little to no sense of rhythm, because most of the moves require very little of it. (things like the grapevine and kicking)

The only really difficult dance routine is #2. It's fast and has a lot of more difficult hip hop style moves that I can't do. But the other four routines are good.",1328227200,,808,3.9814814814814814

I have some dance background, but you don't really need any with this. Anyway, there are five 10-minute workouts. They WILL have you sweating, and may be difficult at first, but stick with it. The ones I found most difficult to begin with are my favorites now, and sometimes I even get frustrated at the down-time between segments.

Sure, the DVD is a bit annoying, but I care less about that and more about the exercise.

This DVD has been great for me - I was barely making it to the gym twice a week and now on those ""back to back"" errand days I can still get a reasonable (for me) workout in. Short workout is better than no workout!

She uses great isolation techniques to work the abs, and the combinations are simple enough for someone without dance experience, but the combinations keep you thinking, so you forget about time. None of the moves were jarring, (Julienne did this side snake from the neck down that would do nothing but make your neck really sore.), everything was really controlled.

The first segment is easy to learn, fun to do, and you don't need a LOT of space to do it. You will break a sweat by the end of the first 10 minutes. The Calorie burner and fat busting sections are simple choreography used by real dancers: it's mostly hip-hop related but you don't need to have a dance background to get into it. The butt and Thigh blaster Will. Work. Your. Body. It's the hardest segment and it works your gluts, hamstrings, inner thighs and calves. The Abs section was the easiest for me.
There are three great things about this DVD
1. It's fun enough to make me want to do it
2. The instructor's attitude is great and supportive and she is great on cuing
3. As you learn the routines, you can move more confidently and with more control. Five months later, I'm still getting a good workout with it.

Will it work? If you do it. My gluts are almost 2 inches smaller, my thighs have shrunk 1 inch, my abs are tighter and my best friend got herself this DVD after seeing the results on me and borrowing the DVD.",1297814400,11,1373,4.0664206642066425
2606658,4,B000GEIRAK,"As a beginner to aerobics with little coordination or dancing skills, I am enjoying this video and getting a good cardio work out.  The instructor goes through the steps bit by bit so it's easy to learn the routine, but makes it interesting along the way so you're still getting a workout while you're learning the pieces.  I also really enjoy that you can program your own workout of the five segments, so you can adjust to how much time you have available and vary up your exercise.  It's also nice that it's programmable so you don't have to stop exercising to fiddle with the DVD player in between.  My only criticism is that I would have liked to see more side views of the exercisers, as sometimes I'm not sure if my position is right, particularly on the squats and lunges.",1296172800,,780,4.471830985915493

So far I'm doing the entire 50 min. workout, but when I'm not up to par I find it perfect to do 2 of the 1st 3 workouts, and ALWAYS the last two (butt, thighs and abs). They are my favorite. Music isn't very exotic but the dance is fun and easy to learn after the 2nd or 3rd time!",1290729600,,409,3.7674418604651163
2606661,3,B000GEIRAK,"Because Jennifer breaks up the workouts in 10 minute segments, you can do as many or as few as you have time for. The moves are easy enough to follow along with (first time out) and you have fun learning and getting ready to bust a move on the dance floor! I find because I'm dancing, it doesn't feel like a workout. However I am sweating and burning calories while getting into it. I simply press ""play all"" and do as many as I have time for. There are 5 segments in total. Definitely worth the $ and I really love Jennifer Galardi's enthusiasm - she sure knows how to move those hips!",1290297600,,586,4.1946902654867255

I found it very frustrating because she would lightly touch on how to do a move and then move on. Since I was trying so hard to stay with her, it wasn't much of a workout. For people who have prior training, I think it could be a good selection because you won't get bored with instruction on how to do moves.",1285286400,,425,4.132530120481928

The moves are simple to learn and yet fun to do.  As I said, the music leaves much to be desired.  I know it is expensive to use a known artist such a 50 cent or Funk-a-delic for your music but I would pay extra just to be able to dance to someone's music I enjoy.  Enough said.

2606680,5,B000GEIRAK,"I love to dance and have bought several dance dvds to work out too.  Most of them were lame or overtorqued the knee.  This one is PERFECT.  It is only 10 minutes a segment so just when you say ""I have had enough"" it is over.  The moves are not so easy that they are boring, but they are not so complex that you get frustrated.  The other great thing is that there is a learning curve.  The music is generic so you can modify the moves until you learn them.  I do 2 or 3 segments at a time and I am sweating up a storm when I finish.  It is a combination of the moves, your intense concentration, and your movement that causes the workout.

If you lack ANY rythm, this is NOT the workout for you.  Many of the moves (explained technically) don't work unless you have a sense of rthym and can execute what she is saying.  For instance, when she is explaining the moves step by step, I can't get them, but once we are actually doing them, I can easily do them because I incorporate my own rthym into the moves.

I use this more to destress.  I can't imagine it would cause any type of weight loss.",1269820800,,1094,4.05607476635514
2606681,4,B000GEIRAK,"I am a fan of the ten minute workout series, and I enjoyed this one.  The routines are a bit complex, but the challenge of mastering them made the routines more fun to do.  Although the routines are short, due to their intensity, I found myself working up a sweat within the ten minute segments.  This series, and this video, is great for people who are pressed for time, or feeling lazy about working out. It's easy to commit to ten minutes, and the routines on the video are a lot of fun.",1267228800,,490,4.247311827956989

I did, or tried to do, the Fat Burning segment.  After five minutes into it, I was so frustrated, I shut it off.  For starters, the music is super lame and completely uninspiring.  The instructor is way too perky.  But, the real problem I have with it is that she would ""describe"" how to do a move and then just jump in without slowing it down.  Now, I have taken a few dance classes here and there, but this was way too quick to keep up with.  I know it's a 10 minute segment, so they don't have a lot of time to work on the moves, but maybe add less moves and give people a chance.  I will be giving this to my sister, who will hopefully get more out of it than I did.

I have this DVD checked out of the library (and renewed multiple times) and I use it at least every other day for the Abs workout and the Butt/Thigh workout.  They are fun, quick to do, and although it has taken me weeks to keep up with all the moves, they are not too hard for me to follow.  I can't comment on the cardio parts because I do Wii games on my cardio days. The only negative comment I have is that there is not a cool down section, but I suppose that is a necessary trade-off for getting good exercise in only 10 minutes.",1265673600,,586,4.086956521739131
2606684,3,B000GEIRAK,"I have been using this workout DVD for a few short weeks now, and I find it to be extremely challenging. I am coordinated and I like a good challenge, so I'm ok with it. BUT if you get easily frustrated with your lack of coordination, don't go anywhere near this DVD. The instructor has clearly been dancing for years, and she teaches the moves very quickly. One must pick up the routines fast, since these are only 10 minute segments. There are still a couple of routines that I struggle with and find myself tripping all over the room (great comic fodder for my husband). I have vowed to keep at them until I get them.

In terms of results, I break into a good sweat every time I use this DVD and I can feel the burn. I believe that if you stick with the workouts you will see results. I have been interchanging this workout with a Jillian Michaels DVD, ""No More Trouble Zones"" which presents more controlled free-weight mat work (see my review). I was getting a little bored with Jillian's workout so I bought this one to mix things up a bit.

In short, if you have ever danced and can follow a choreographed routine taught in no time, you can do this. If not, try to find something a little more basic.",1265500800,,1206,4.285087719298246

2606698,4,B000GEIRAK,"The ""10 Minute Solution"" series provides 5 10-minute workouts with a certain intructor leading all 5 of them.  Jennifer Galardi is the instructor in this one, and she does a great job leading the following 5 segments:

Simple Slimmer-This routine consists of relatively easy steps such as hip rolls, grapevines, and more with a little attitude twist on them.  It seemed a little too sexy to me, but I still like this routine.

Calorie Meltdown-This is a high-cardio hip-hop routine.  It's NOT street, it's hip-hop.  There are quite a few jumping moves mixed with a little bit of fast footwork to give this routine a pretty high intensity.

Fat Burning Party-This routine seems to be a unique mixture of Latin and hip-hop steps.  It's a medium impact workout that really shows a new way to dance both styles.  Really fun!

Butt & Thigh Blaster-This is a routine that is supposed to focus on moves to tone the legs.  However, I rarely feel any burn.  This is a great warm-up routine, but I didn't find it that halpful in toning.

Ab Attack-This routine focuses in on your abs.  I feel it work while I'm doing it, but I never feel sore the next day.  It is all standing ab moves, so if you're not used to that, it make take a while to learn how to do them.  Great fun, however, and I use it for my cool-down.

All the routines do have a short warm-up and cool-down, but some people won't find it sufficient.  This is a great DVD that is perfect for intermediate dancers!",1260748800,3,1467,4.471698113207547

What this means is that everything in the video is going to be compressed and quick, including the amount of time taken to teach movements. This video was my first foray into this kind of thing, and I found it to be a bit of a confidence-buster, because I couldn't follow the movements easily with the small amount of instruction given, at the pace at which it was given.

The variety of the workouts is good too and the fact that you can do them in whatever order you like also adds a lot of variety.

2606736,4,B000GEIRAK,"This is one of the easier dance exercise DVDs that actually feels like dancing, and not just aerobics.  Several segments are appropriate for beginners, and several are great for intermediate dancers.  If you're moderately well-coordinated and are looking for a fun, customizable dance routine to jump-start your existing cardio, this DVD would be perfect for you.  Personally, I have a strong dance background (but nowhere near professional!), and I picked up the choreography on this DVD pretty quickly while still finding it fun.

As an instructor, Jennifer Galardi is great.  Her cueing is superb, and she goes through each move step-by-step so that you can follow along. Then she brings it up to speed and adds more moves to create a whole routine.  Although there are two backup dancers, they don't show any modifications, and there's no whooping or hollering (phew!).

Here's a rundown of the five routines:

* Simple Slimmer -- Super fun, easy dance moves.  I LOVE this routine as a cardio warm-up!  It's all stylized marching, hip rolls, side steps, throw-downs (a fun hop-kick move), and grapevines.  Calorie burn: 5/10 (where 1 = slow walking, 10 = intense aerobic workout).  Difficulty of moves for someone of average coordination: 3/10.
* Calorie Meltdown -- This intermediate-level routine is the most ""dancy,"" with quick-paced, modern-ish coreography.  It has actually become my favorite, although it took a few times for me to feel comfortable enough with the moves to really enjoy it.  Now I never leave this routine out of my customized workout.  Calorie burn: 8/10.  Difficulty of moves: 7/10.
* Fat-Burning Party -- Another intermediate-level routine, but half dance, half aerobic.  Lunges, salsa steps, and other varied moves work more muscles than the previous two segments (you feel it more in your legs).  Calorie burn: 8/10.  Difficulty of moves: 6/10.
* Butt & Thigh Blaster -- Overall very aerobic but with a few dance-inspired moves.  Nice workout for quads & glutes; not terribly difficult, so no soreness the next day.  (You'll need a separate, specialized ""buns/thighs"" workout if you want to see major improvement here.)  Calorie burn: 6/10.  Difficulty of moves: 2/10.
* Ab Attack -- This segment sadly does not do what it's supposed to.  I have never felt a burn from this (and I have weak abs!); for that I'm taking one star off the rating.  It's all standing and very aerobic, with upper/lower body isolations, vertical crunches, overhead/diagonal reaches, and knee lifts.  It's just not as effective as floorwork.  Calorie burn: 4/10.  Difficulty of moves: 2/10.

The music on this DVD is really not bad at all, except for the abs segment, where the soundtrack is ""sporty"" drumbeats you'd hear during a 90s aerobic step class... kind of cheesy.  Otherwise, the music is pop/dance that goes very nicely with the moves and tone of each workout.

If you're an advanced dancer, this whole DVD will be extremely easy for you.  Perhaps a more appropriate dance workout in this case would be Jennifer Galardi's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hip-Hop-Party/dp/B000TJ6OZ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hip Hop Party</a>&nbsp;or MaDonna Grimes'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/African-Beat-Latin-Heat/dp/B0006H31SA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">African Beat - Latin Heat</a>, both of which I also own and love doing, as they are more involved and have some advanced stepwork.

I was sweating alright, but not because I was doing anything right.  She moves pretty fast and doesn't really explain how the moves work.  She just expects that you can watch and follow along.  I found her annoying at times because she talks to you like it's so easy, no problem.  For people that are good dancers, you would get tired of this too because each segment breaks down the dance routine at the beginning, and if you've already gotten the hang of it, you won't want to keep going over the moves individually.  I tried all the segments just to see if I could benefit from any of them, but I couldn't.  The Ab Attack one, is probably the worst.  I felt absolutely nothing in my abs.  She says, ""You'll look great, I promise.""  There's no way her 10 minute ab workout is going to get you in shape.",1236470400,5,955,4.163934426229508

I was right.  Even if it takes me 15 minutes (an additional 5 minutes to connect my laptop to my television because my stupid HDMI cable refuses  to work properly), the product delivers.  After 10 minutes, I am soaking wet and active.  Sometimes I add another 10 minutes to my workout.

I love the fact that even though I am an experienced dancer and also do a lot of step I can pop in this DVD and still work up a sweat because of the fast movements without leaving my home to take a dance class. I disagree that this is not a good choice for beginners, I think you have to watch the DVD a few times (which is actually recommended by the instructor and is what I do every time I purchase a new workout DVD anyway) and give yourself a chance to improve.

I thought dancing would be fun and it is.  I am using the cardio sections more than the toning sections, but those sections alone would make this DVD worthwhile to own.

The teacher is able to convey how to do the moves so that you can learn them and get to using them in the rouintes, and I am somewhere a bit more coordinated than a total two left feet type but no one would ever mistake me for J.

2606778,4,B000GEIRAK,"I'm not at all what one might consider ""in shape"", but I like to think I'm on my way.  I rent a lot of workout videos so I can switch things up and not get bored.  (And also to try them out.)  I don't mind owning this DVD because it's five 10 minute workouts that I can pick and choose from to keep it interesting.

If you've tried other workout videos you're used to having it start out with a nice slow warm up section.  The first 10 minute section on this DVD is pretty much a warm up, but it was a little faster paced then I expected. (That's why this DVD has 4 instead of 5 stars)  Luckily, if you're tried other workout videos, you already have an idea of how to warm up.  If you're not confident that you know how to warm up, that shouldn't discourage you from using this DVD.  One thing I like to do in the evening is to go out for a walk and then do one or two of the sections on the DVD.  Right before bed.  I sleep really well after that.

The instructor, Jennifer, is upbeat without being annoying.  This is something of an accomplishment considering she's constantly talking. (There's NO dead air during the workouts.)  The music isn't going to have you scrambling for... where ever it is you buy your music.  But it keeps the beat, switches up during each workout so as not to be very repetitive and isn't distracting.

There's no floor work in these workouts, you're going to be standing and moving in some way for the whole 10 minutes of each.  I think that's important.  The hardest thing for me is getting up and moving.  With floor work, if I need to stop, even for a moment, then I'm already laying down and it's hard to start up again.  With this DVD, if I need to stop, I'm at least still standing up and it's easier to get right back into it after shaking out whatever was getting sore.

The moves are sufficiently simple and low impact that it's easy to start up, but they're engaging enough to hold your interest and be fun if you're more experienced.  As time goes on, the routines can become higher impact because you're putting more energy into them.

Even if you're just starting (or restarting) out, I think this DVD is worth your time.  Each segment is short, simple and effective.",1221523200,14,2212,4.27710843373494

It takes me a LONG time to get dance steps!!! Clearly, this instructor is an accomplished dancer. I don't think it's part of the intent on this vid to explain the movements, but just to have fun and develop the steps. It's head and shoulders above the old aerobics, with endless meaningless moves. At least with this you can do something with more variety with a dance sensibility. Chalene Johnson and others explain their  moves at length, if that's more what you're looking for. For variety and fun, this is a great vid to add to your collection, and if you're a clumsy oaf like me, then fine! Just keep doing it.

If my uncoordinated self could get a good workout to this, many more can too. I would say just don't have such high expectations for how good you are going to look doing it. The only bad thing I can say about it, is the music is a tiny bit boring. I wish they were songs you could sing to or something.

2606786,4,B000GEIRAK,"I'm enjoying and benefitting from these workouts. I really like Jennifer Galardi's style and the fun dance choreography. I loved dancing in my youth and missed it. Disabled as a result of botched back surgeries (nerve damage,) I need exercise programs that work within my capabilities. I can't feel my feet so have to be very careful. Some programs contain moves too complex for me to handle without injuring myself.

Because this video is done in five 10 minute segments, these workouts are fairly easy for the beginner or someone like me with limited ability. The steps are manageable for me, although I modify any move that includes turning - those are the kind that can trip me up and send me off balance.

I will say there's a bit of a learning curve to get the moves down and for that reason I didn't give this dvd 5 stars. However, I found it helpful that I also bought Jennifer's Hip Hop Dance Party which includes a whole section of step breakdown for practice. I ran it through twice to learn the moves. That little practice session was as good a workout as running a full aerobic program! Now I'm familiar with most of the moves used in her Hip Hop dance based videos. I will use this dvd many times and highly recommend it.",1208390400,4,1235,4.484444444444445

  When I first started I realized how clumsy I am because I could not do 100% of the moves. I still do what I can and it makes me feel great afterwards.
  My only suggestion to those who are thinking of purchasing this is to take it a little bit at a time instead of jumping into 30 minutes right away like I did. It is easier to get a hang of the kind of moves you'll be doing then. Overall, I'm satisfied with this DVD and I find it kinda fun to work out in this way.",1208390400,4,620,3.7099236641221376
2606788,4,B000GEIRAK,"This video is a good routine to change up your everyday cardio. The moves are fairly simple and the instructor goes over each individual step multiple times before combining anything. Each routine is run through multiple times at the end and also a few times from the top each time the instructor adds a new step. I only have two cons. First, there really is a learning curve. Some of the steps took just a little longer for me to pick up than the time given by the instructor. I did like the fact that she goes through the full routine each time you learn a new step because that gave me a bit more time to firm things up before we moved on to add yet another step. Second, some of the routines seemed a little one-sided. As silly as it may sound, one routine in particular seemed to concentrate on the right side of the body. Yes, this is cardio, but you are still using your muscles, which still means toning. I may be super-paranoid, but I also do not like to tire one side and not the other. My simple solution was to make my own routine going the other way. That takes a bit of coordination, but it worked. Overall, the cuing is great, the instructor is very into her routines and the video was a nice change from your traditional ""boot camp"" or ""aerobic"" workouts. Worth the less than $10 I paid just for the change. Oh, and HUGE PLUS, the abs workout was great! It's all a standing workout, but I really felt it. She uses simple moves, but I am not used to doing any standing abs so it was a great change that I felt in the morning.",1208131200,8,1540,4.206081081081081

2606790,4,B000GEIRAK,"This was my very first dance DVD and I love it.  I've seen others and believe me there are some pretty bad ones out there.

I read a few comments that state the dance steps are too difficult or she's moving too fast.  I know everyone is different, but really...  I don't think she could possibly break the moves down anymore than she does AND everytime she introduces a new move, she goes over it multiple times before incorporating it into the routine.  All DVD players have a pause and rewind...use them!!  Some moves I caught right away, for others I paused it while I practiced until I felt comfortable.

The first 3 dance segments build on each other, so if you suck at the first segment, you are going to really suck on the next one.  Master the moves and THEN move on to the next Blast...stay there until you've master that one.  Even the most inept dancer(formerly me) can't help but get a little better with repetition.

Good Luck and remember, BE PATIENT with yourself.  This is a really fun way to sweat once you get the moves down.

**NOTE: The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that they should have a ""No BS"" segment.  Once you're comfortable with the moves, you want a straight work-out.  Stopping to FF or Rewind past the parts where she is teaching the steps or the cool down can get frustrating when you are trying to keep you heart rate up.",1207008000,2,1366,4.3478260869565215

i love that you can choose the order of the dances, and how many you want to do per workout session.  jennifer is motivating, and not overly cheesy or annoying, as she is in the ""crunch workout series"" dvd.  (that dvd is AWFUL, by the way).  i'll admit that i'm pretty coordinated, so it only took me 1 or 2 workouts to get all the moves down.  i'm no real dancer, but i'd say the dancing isn't anything difficult, but the moves, in my opinion, and at their pace provide a pretty good cardio workout.  my heartrate is up, though nothing excessive, and i break a little bit of a sweat, doing 4o min of the routines each time.  i can't say i like the ""ab"" one, so i almost never do that one.

overall, a decent 'dance workout', nothing too strenuous or difficult, but nothing too simple either.  like i said, i'm no dancer, so i don't know how you'd compare these to ""real"" dance moves, but i'm happy with it b/c it gets me moving, i like the routines, and i don't feel like i'm working out.",1205193600,2,1171,4.191964285714286

Before you even know what body part is supposed to be moving to what rythym and/or direction, she's moved on to add another step and you find yourself stopping entirely so you might be able to figure out each of the moves.

If not for the closed door, I'm sure my family would have been calling the paramedics thinking I was having some sort of seizure.

2606799,5,B000GEIRAK,"I purchased this DVD to get myself moving since starting a fitness regimen this month.  I'm not in great shape and by no means a dancer.  I found this DVD to be fun and fairly easy to follow.  The instructor is down to earth and not the least bit annoying.  Even if you can't get the choreography at first, you can easily substitute your own moves to keep up with the beat.  There are also lots of ways to modify the moves to push yourself when you've mastered the basic steps.  I also love that I can tailor my own workout with the five segments included on the DVD.  So far, I've done the Simple Slimmer and the Fat Burning party.  Both got my heart pumping in the quick 10-minute time frame.  I can't see myself getting bored of this DVD any time soon!",1200355200,,755,4.1875
2606800,5,B000GEIRAK,"For all you who love to workout at home I reccommend this tape highly.  I am not an experienced or trained dancer.  The great thing is that you don't need to be in order to pick up these moves.  The first few times I bumbled my way through it a bit, but now after ten or so times of using the tape I am step perfect the whole way through and I think anyone with half an inclination towards dance would be too.

The magic of these routines, is, the more you know them, the more you can get out of them.  And when that happens, you really see results in the toning and strength of your body.  I also feel there are mental benefits to be gained from learning to follow direction attentively, and, once you get the moves down, creatively breaking out with your own segments that you may prefer to what she is reccommending.

Jennifer Galardi herself is clearly a very experienced and talented instructor.  Also, she is incredibly toned and healthy.  This gives great incentive to get fit yourself.  Seeing other people look good dancing and working out makes you wonder ""Could I ever do that? Could I reach that level of fitness?""

The video is split into five ten minute segments, two of which focus on strength building in the abs and [...]/legs area.  The other three segments are basic workout/dance routines.  They are fast paced, but give you ample time to work up to the routine and lots of repetition to make learning possible for us non-trained dancers.

The option I use the most is that you are able to personalize you own workout by putting the five segments into whichever order you choose.  It makes things more interesting, and is a helpful choice to have.

A great product overall.",1200355200,3,1693,4.483660130718954

I end up spending more time wondering why I can't get it right than actually sweating!  I think if you have any kind of dance background, then you will like this one, otherwise stick to the fitness ball one or the pilates.  They are good!",1199232000,,501,4.134020618556701

The key is to swing your hips, ""throw"" your arms, and be all out with it.  I don't so it every day.  More for when I don't have time for the gym.  One problem, if you can call it that, every segment has a warm up and cool down, so if you do more than one, keep the remote handy to FF trough the cool downs until you are all done.

The only problem that I've found is the instructor moves a little too fast for me to actually catch on to a few of the steps, so sometimes I stay behind for a while.  I've found that it helps to do the same workout a few times instead of mixing it up so that I can get the hang of one routine really good and feel like I am accomplishing something during my workout.

I like to choose 2 of the more intense segments--simple slimmer, fat blaster, calorie meltdown-- and then pair it with one of the less intense segments--abs or butt/thighs. This combination of 3 segments makes a great 30 minute workout routine. The moves are fun, easy to learn, and challenging.

It's not a hard workout, but it makes me sweat and is enjoyable enough that I can do it even on days when I don't feel like doing much.
I like that the dvd allows me to create my own routine with the five, ten minute segments. I also like the instructor, she's pleasant and competent. I don't like that each ten minute segment has its own cool down, so I get a little longer break between segments than I need.",1196035200,3,564,3.8706896551724137

However, I'm a typical middle-aged, overweight, non-exercising woman who is looking for a ""cardio"" work-out that I can really DO...and this isn't it!  Everybody (doctors, nurse practitioners, nutritionitsts, exercise experts, etc.)says that ""cardio"" is what will make the biggest difference in my weight loss.  I agree wholeheartedly but if you can't follow or keep up with the video it is frustrating and disappointing. For those of us who are serious about trying to make a change in our life styles and habits by including exercise along with dietetic changes this video is not motivational as a beginning tool.  It is indeed upbeat, lively, fast-paced, all the things you want in a ""cardio"" video, but for the overweight person at the beginning of the journey it is just not ""do-able"".....I'm still looking for ""the one""......",1194825600,4,928,5.125827814569536

The ab exercises were pretty much impossible for me cuz I don't know how to ""roll"" my abs/upper body. If you're inexperienced and just wanna dance to burn off some fat, I'd recommend this DVD for that. It's definitely funner to do than other workout DVDs.

This dvd is so great b/c you have 5 different 10 minute dance routines to choose from that target seperate areas of the body. Plus there is an option to customize your own workout. I really work up a sweat just doing any one of the 10 minute workouts. Its even better combining 2 or 3 at a time. It is very convenient for anyone who doesnt have much time to work out and can only fit in 10 minutes a day-it gets you feeling so good in my opinion it makes you want to do more than just one 10 minute work out.,1187395200,6,659,3.925373134328358

The instructor is cheerful and motivating, but not annoying and her backup dancers have pretty good dance style. If the choreography was a little cooler and more challenging I would give it 5 stars. The moves can get a little repetitive after doing the dvd frequently, but the good workout makes up for it. I also like the abs section, which she does standing up emphasizing more of the core. I could see though how the exercises might not be effective for someone with no dance training since she does a lot of abdominal isolations.

Overall, great workout and fun to do.",1184630400,,702,4.484375

you'll sweat through all the 3 cardio sections, and then the two toning sections will get you the great body toning you need.  The abs section is unlike any i've had before - first time evergoing through abs routine standing up!
10 minutes for cardio is note enough to burnc alories, so i always do 2 or 3 at once - and it's hard enough to sweat and keep your heart rate up, but not too much that you can't do all of them.  Very often i complete the entire DVD at once, and the ability to mix and match the order of the segments is great!

Being a former ""Club Hopper"" from New York City, I was looking for something ""Stylin and Raw"" not some corney dance steps by a bunch of Barbie dolls!

Although I am very pleased with my purchase, the abs workout was horrible! I do pilates a lot and this was a wreck. The other 10 minute sessions really made up for it though! This is a great purchase all in all! By the way, if you are looking for an ab workout I'd go with Ana Caban's pilates mat workouts.",1182556800,,556,4.0636363636363635
2606828,4,B000GEIRAK,"Set on nice white stage with 2 backup girls. The music could be much better & I think it keeps me from getting into it more because after the 10 min, I'm kinda bored for some reason though I love the teaching style, pace & enjoy learning the good moves. Jennifer in this dvd gives great cues at great timing & has a good attention to detail such as reminding you to turn out your knee in the thigh workout to make sure you're working your inner thighs. I love her best here, in her Prevention: Dance it off! I didn't like the dance moves, in her Crunch: Fat Burning Dance Party in 2005 had good moves, but not enough breakdown or 1/2 time teaching.
There's only a 30 second to 1 min warm up & cool down, but there would be no time in a 10 min workout.
Jennifer starts off with simple step touches, teaches in 1/2 time, build up to bigger moves & more detail, and then adds the arms so you can keep up easily a few times, then goes normal speed a few times. After you learn 2 moves, she puts them together in routine, and so on for about 4-5 moves each 10 min workout.
Any dance move that's good you will not get the first time, as long as you're not staring at the tv totally lost, you will get it, trust me. Everything takes practice. She is only going to show the teaching for only so long so you get to learn more moves & won't be bored once you've viewed this several times.
The Simple Slimmer & Calorie Meltdown is all dance moves. I didn't have to fast fwd or go in slow motion to keep up.
In the fat burning dance party, only in one kick fwd, step back move did I have to go in slow motion since she didn't do it in 1/2 time. At one point, she says ""I'm gong to talk less because instructors get tired too."" I like to see videos where you see the instructor doing it, getting hot (it's harder for them with all the blazing industrial strength lights to kill every single shadow) w/o breaks for makeup & hair touch ups.
The Butt & Thigh blaster is more slow toning moves that turn into very simple, basic hip hop dance moves & was too easy & simplistic for me.
Ab Attack: same style as butt/thigh.. more about slow toning with simple moves like chest circles knee to chest with arms down, etc.

I guess the instructor did not have enough time to get viewers used to the moves, due to the limitation of time -- 10 mins.

2606835,5,B000GEIRAK,"This workout seems quite easy, as the instructor goes through each of the moves with clear instruction, building step upon step.  Each of the 5 workouts are 10 minutes each, which means you can just do a few extra on top of another workout - which is what I often do, or do the whole workout (all 5 sections) in one hit - which is an excellent all round workout..  I find it gets me into a mild sweat - even though it doesn't actually feel like you're doing a whole lot.  It really does 'feel' easy..  and the steps are fun to learn - though a one or two of them I had to try quite a few times before figuring them out.. It's kind of low key but effective - rather than dynamic and lively.  I like it as a follow-on after a 45minute dance workout - to give me a good 90 minute workout..  and what's great about it, is that if I don't have enough time - as sometimes happens - I will just do 2 or 3 of the 10 minute sections on top of my other workout, so from that angle I find it an excellent addition to my DVD workout collection.  It's also good on days when you're feeling really tired - as it's enough to get you worked out well, but without complicated (or highly active) moves that can cause injury when you're tired..  This might not be dynamic and lively like a cardio dance workout, but it has firm strong movements via dance steps, and actually works!  After just 4-5 days of doing this I could notice my body was toning all over - hips, thighs, tummy!  Also I've found that it helps to really do the workout energetically - ie on the marching steps, really get into it and get a rhythm going - and then you'll find you WILL get your heart rate right up and 'feel' like you've worked out!

I've taken fitness classes at my gym and this is the only DVD that compares to those, making me feel as though I'm taking a personal class right in my living room.  Jennifer, the instructor, is great- not at all annoying -and she seems to motivate me just when I need it most.  This DVD really gets my heart rate up, and sometimes I even need to stop to catch my breath.  I workout in the morning, and dancing around my living room to this DVD definitely puts me in a good mood for the day!

The dance routines are extremely fun and definitely more ""current"" than the other DVD's I've tried. I would only advise that you do need to have good coordination to be able to complete the moves, as some of them are definitely more complex.  ""Simple Slimmer"" and ""Fat Burning Party"" seem to be the easiest to pick up for beginners.  My favorite, however, is ""Ab Attack.""  As someone who HATES doing endless crunches and ab-work on the floor, I absolutely love this segment because you're standing, and even dancing, the entire time.  The first time I tried it, it was so fun that I figured it couldn't possibly be working my abs too.  Boy was I wrong - during everything I did the next day, from simple walking to sitting down to working out, I could feel the soreness in my midsection!

I also love being able to program which 10 minute routines I want to do in my half hour cardio workout.  It's so much better than having to fast forward through parts you're not interested in in an hour long DVD.  Being broken into 10 minute segments also seems to make my workout go by faster.  I know how much longer I have to go without having to keep looking at the clock.

Overall, I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone looking for a fun, dance inspired workout that will truly make you sweat!",1171670400,,1927,4.343575418994414
2606845,5,B000GEIRAK,"This is my first 10 Minute Solution workout video, and I like it so much that I just purchased another one of the series.

I am a true beginner - overweight and fairly uncoordinated - but this video really makes me feel confident. I can't do all of the fastest moves yet, but I stumble through them and don't feel bad about it. There are enough simple moves mixed in with the complex ones that you can just dance in place for a second or two, and you'll be back to the easy moves again.

I like the 10-minute segments because I find them convenient to intersperse throughout the day. I can do a quick mini-workout in the morning to get my blood pumping, another some time in the afternoon and one before bedtime, and I know I've exercised 30 minutes in total that day, without the pressure of overexerting myself in one go. You can do anything for just 10 minutes! Even if you're tired, you never have time to think ""God, how long until it's over?"" It ends before you know it, and you feel accomplished after each segment. I feel energized afterwards, instead of exhausted!",1170892800,84,1073,4.414141414141414
2606846,3,B000GEIRAK,This may be good once I get a little faster but I cant do it right now because my legs just don't move that fast LOL. It is def. not for beginners or people who are uncoordinated. This is going to be sitting on my shelf for now because I just cannot physically do it lol.,1170720000,,271,3.857142857142857
2606847,4,B000GEIRAK,Jennifer Galardi is a great instructor. She is peppy and upbeat but not annoying. I have her Crunch Dance Party DVD and i have tossed it. This one is a better work out. The 10 Min Solutions dvd's are a really great solution. You can pick and choose the areas you want to work on most with the time you have. Some of her moves you won't get the first time around but if you stick with it you will see results.,1170201600,,408,3.9878048780487805
2606848,4,B000GEIRAK,"The instructor in this video is high energy and a lot of fun.  The first time going through many of the workouts though I got frustrated because I couldn't get all the moves.  However, after a couple of times through it became much easier.  The ab section is a killer.",1169683200,2,268,4.32
2606849,4,B000GEIRAK,"I picked this video up about a week ago and love it!  The first two days were a bit frustrating, because I have no dance experience other than an introduction to basic ballet class I took in college.  I had never even danced at a school function.  Yet, after a week of giving it this video a try, I find myself following along pretty easily.

The instructor has movements that are clear and easy to follow.  She never gets into a groove and runs away from you with the moves.  Each step is well defined, so if you keep your eyes on her at all times, you should do fine. I also appreciate that while she's upbeat, she isn't ""perky"" and annoying.  I feel motivated when I'm doing the routines, and enjoy the challenge, without the cringe sensation some instructors cause me by their attitude or comments during the workout.  Since it's a video, you have to hear the comments over and over and over again, so that's important.

If you're looking for something you can do quickly as a beginner, that really works up a sweat and gets you moving without becoming dull, I definitely recommend this video.  I feel more coordinated and more fit already. :)",1168819200,31,1147,4.471153846153846
2606850,3,B000GEIRAK,I have never used any of the 10 minute videos before and purchased several at once.  Althought I have really enjoyed the Kickboxing and the Fitness ball ones I have not liked this one as much.  I wanted something fun and different to introduce to my workouts but found this DVD a little hard to follow and hard for me to do since I have knee trouble.  I didn't realize there would be such jumpy aerobic types of moves. Maybe it's better suited for a more coordinated person!,1168473600,8,474,4.363636363636363
2606851,2,B000GEIRAK,"I really didn't think so until I tried this video.  It is a comfort to me that other folks couln't follow or keep up.  By the end of the first ""basic"" segment I felt like a complete loser and hopelessly frustrated.  She'd keep saying ""Did you catch that?"" and by the end my response was, well, unprintable at the least.  The workout definately got my heart rate up, but it was more stress than excersize, as I couldn't follow her at all.  Fuhgettaboutit.",1168387200,18,454,4.421686746987952
2606852,3,B000GEIRAK,"I'm a college student and am determined to keep off the Freshman 15. While I have access to a gym, I've found that I just don't have the time or energy to put in a full workout - so I found that this type of movie is perfect for me because I can do this without dealing with a whole hour out of my day.

But, besides that, I wasn't too pleased with this.  I'm not out of shape, I just wanted something that could keep me in shape with a little fun but out of the 5 exercises, I really only like 3 of them.  One of them I just /can't/ do one of the moves.  It's some crazy foot thing and - well I gave up.  The ohter just doesn't get my blood pumping.  But, I really enjoy the other three.  The problem is that doing the exact same routine every morning can get pretty old pretty fast.

All in all, I enjoyed this DVD but found that while some moves were definitely confusing, it wasn't difficult enough for someone who just wanted to stay toned, not really ""burn fat"".",1167782400,9,968,4.005208333333333
2606853,5,B000GEIRAK,"I have read many reviews and was unsure to buy this product or not..I'm not a big fan of workout videos but I wanted to start.  I'm a great dancer so I had always thought these videos were cheesey aS well as a waste of money..I WAS WRONG.  I ordered 4 videos to start out with and by far..this is my FAVORITE.  I'm sure some are sceptic because of the ""10 Minute"" segments but honestly, if you pay attention, do what Jennifer says, you get a GREAT workout..you can even keep moving once you learn the routine as she's going to the next steps...PLEASE TRY IT, SHE'S GREAT!!",1167436800,9,572,4.277777777777778
2606854,5,B000GEIRAK,"I definitely have 2 left feet, so I was hesitant to buy this video. But, because there are 10 minute segments, I figured I'd give it a try. I'm sooo glad I did. The moves are basic enough for someone even like me. I was so excited when I realized I was able to follow along. I was sweating really good too! I've only done 3 segments so far and looking forward to doing the others as well. Jennifer cues very well too. I'm so glad I FINALLY found a dance video that I can do :)",1166400000,23,476,3.917525773195876
