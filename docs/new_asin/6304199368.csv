The great ""gray wolf"" is also out of the protection list, and I like to know if is going to be an educational program regarding it. Thanks, for the remark that most of the panic regarding wolfs y just plain ignorance.",1371772800,,314,4.147540983606557

7864350,5,6304199368,This is the one of the most enjoyable documentaries that I have ever seen. Wish it was longer and it is really enlightening about the much maligned wolf. I got to know so much about this wild animal and have gained so much respect for this creature. Timothy Dalton is absolutely superb in here as he takes the audience through the lifeline of the wolves in the north pole.,1258848000,,372,4.405797101449275
7864351,2,6304199368,"While Timothy Dalton's name may be a big draw for this film, I was rather disappointed with it, overall. Dalton's enthusiasm for wildlife does lend a kind of charm to the film, though as he accompanies David Mech to various points in North America in search of wolves. Their journies take them to Alaska (where they find bears, but no wolves,) Minnesota (where they see a few, and dart one to more closely examine it,) and finally to Ellesmere Island, a terribly remote place about 5-600 miles South of the North Pole, but where there is a solid population of wolves.
They only film one pack on Ellesmere, two adults and their three pups,) and there is some good footage of social behavior; however, there are numerous factual errors (all Arctic Gray Wolves are not white, and those that are white are not so colored to blend in with their environment - white hairs are virtually hollow, which means they are more insulating than hairs with color. There are more, but that gives you an idea.) The film was made in 1993, and there have been significant advances in understanding wolves since that time, but even for '93, Dalton passes along outdated information.
Still, even with the limited ""natural behavior"" footage and the errors, the film does impart important information about the wolf; Dalton actually demonstrates how wolves are afraid of people by slowly crawling toward the alpha male, who startles and backs quickly away. He passes along good information, such as a wild healthy wolf never having killed anyone in North America, how intelligent wolves are, and how they are very social, gentle creatures.
However, if you're really looking for a good educational film to learn about the wolf and its behaviors and issues, you'd be better off picking up the National Geographic film about the Yellowstone wolf reintroduction project, or even the IMAX DVD, which has an excellent featurette that's actually better than the IMAX film itself. There are also many, many excellent books to review, such as The Wolf Almanac, Wolf Wars, and even Wolves at Our Door. But whatever you decide to read or view, do it! Wolves are fascinating, intelligent, complicated animals well worth studying.",1033257600,4,2193,4.92972972972973
7864352,5,6304199368,"Although some programs where famous people meet interesting animals can be a bit oh-hum.. I found this one surprizingly not so.
I'm not sure if Mr Dalton did his own research on the background, or just used a script - but when he finally came to meet the wolves you could hear the surprize in his voice.
At first he was nervous about meeting creatures with such a darken reputation, but through-out the program you could hear him  change from trepidation to wonderment and awe.
I trust that the producers kept Mr Daltons own observations in the program but here was a man who went in with open eyes and emerged 'touched' some something wonderful.
Its programs like these what can insite the common man to look more closer - rather than feeling isolated by the towers of acadamia.
Certainly this program gets my Rating.",1011484800,4,818,4.641379310344828
7864353,5,6304199368,"Timothy Dalton went in search of wolves in 1995.  In this you can see how thrilled he was at finding them.
I videoed this when it was first on tv, and I've seen it so many times since it's getting a bit fuzzy.
This was when I first fell in love with wolves, and especially 'The Old Man', (also known as Left Shoulder).  This program details the varying views toward the wolf, and how difficult it is to actually find them.  It is filled with beautiful images and heart warming encounters.
It focuses especially on a family on Ellesmere Island, The Old Man's pack.  It shows the obvious affection they have for each other, and how they tolerate the very few people they meet.
L. David Mech was Timothy Dalton's guide and was able to tell alittle of this family which has now been studying for nearly 15 years.  That year there were 3 cubs, all of which survived at least their first few years, as shown in L. D. Mech's book 10 years with the pack.
At a lot has happened to the pack since, as was shown in a program called 'Wolves in white' from 1997.  However that was the most up to date information I have yet seen on this particular pack.
It is a great example of the real personality of wolves, and could change the opinions of many.",985651200,6,1236,4.283261802575107
