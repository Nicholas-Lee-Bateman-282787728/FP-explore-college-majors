8466830,5,B005DHSEX0,"After other reviews, I expected the English subtitles to be unreadable. Perhaps I got a different copy, but I found none of the mistakes anyone had mentioned. I did have some trouble getting it to play on all dvd players (it worked best in the XBox), but it's a clean copy, and the subs are perfectly intelligible, and accurate, to the best of my meager Japanese comprehension. Excellent drama, worth the money.",1454198400,,411,4.722222222222222
8466831,4,B005DHSEX0,"Jin could be just another Japanese TV drama with all the corniness that goes with it. However, Jin stands out thanks to an original story, several decent actors and the period's setting. The story is so because the serial combines medical criminal and jidaigeki period drama, historical elements, romance, bushido, science fiction and a good dosage of soap. Too many cooks usually spoil the broth, but for the earlier reasons Jin's recipe works.

It is the Tokugawa period in Japan and change is afoot. A young doctor - accomplished but due to recent events unsure of himself - has literally fallen back in time after interacting with a patient in modern Tokyo. He has left a life and love behind. His contemporary medical skills are astounding and valuable in Edo, which is where he has landed. From there the drama moves quickly and never gets bogged down. While basically a soap opera, the many innovative elements, period pieces, action and love propel the multi-genre series to a higher plane. The serial also teaches the viewer a thing or two. Otherwise, Jin is a treat for admirers of Edo of the period and Japanese culture.

Jin explores consequences of one's actions. For my personal tastes, there is one too many mentions of God, spirituality and the oddity of a school of medicine, which implausibly is more advanced in breast cancer and surgery than the doctor. The implicit love of the lead female character for the sensei is not a surprise, but his ignorance of it is. In fact, the attractive and dedicated Saki (played by Ayase Haruka) spends a lot of time soul-searching while being inquisitive and longing for love - perhaps not a surprise given how she has just met someone from another time - while Minakata Jin (played by Osawa Takao) looks confounded and confused.

Speaking of Saki-san's attractiveness could Doctor Jin be stalking her? After all, aside from sharing the screen in Jin the two were leads in Ichi&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ICHI-Blu-ray/dp/B002KYIAL0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ICHI [Blu-ray</a>] one year before Jin.

Facetiousness aside, it is not until episode ten of Season One that the good doctor catches on regarding Saki-san's love.
TBS (Tokyo Broadcasting System) offered eleven episodes for Season One of Jin including an extended season finale.  Due to the series' success a second season with eleven episodes appeared two years later and a Korean version was also filmed.",1410566400,,2692,5.448441247002398

8466833,2,B005DHSEX0,"This series ran on a local Japanese-language network and I found it very enjoyable. I bought this product and was shocked at the poor quality of the subtitling -It seems to be translated by somebody with a poor command of English with a dictionary. The Japanese names are translated literally, as pointed out in another review and some of the sentences are unintelligible.

I managed to locate and download a fansub (a version of the series with subtitles added by fans) with superior subtitles and I put in the time to burn my own DVD set using that collection.

If you don't speak Japanese, avoid this poorly-subbed version.",1390089600,,626,4.787037037037037
8466834,5,B005DHSEX0,"a fictional drama based on historical events. however as stated by one reviewer, proceed with caution. this was translated by a chinese translator. through most of the dvd everything if fine and understandable, BUT IN THE LAST DISK (iirc. as it was a few years ago) it's as if they got another translator who's interpretation and translation messes up the storyline. names get changed, dialogue gets change,,,as if from japanese > chinese > english, instead of japanese > english. the last disk is unwatchable unless you speak japanese.

i had to watch the conclusion online at a japanese site that streamed the movie with proper japanese > english translation. the REAL japanese dvd in fact cost $200 back then. which reminds me, i have to ask my friend once again to see if there's a goof dvd set out there :):)",1384128000,,813,4.76595744680851
8466835,5,B005DHSEX0,"Although I didn't purchase this through Amazon I stumbled on this page while looking for recomendations on Japanese drama and, since there were only 2 reviews, I thought I'd add another as I thought this series was superb.

Plot summary without giving too much away - highly qualified surgeon (Jin) from ""today"" falls through time warp into Japan of the 1860's/70's, a period of crucial change in Japanese history. Through happenstance he operates on a critically injured samurai and is ""adopted"" into the family of brother (the samurai) sister and mother. The sister is at first repelled then fascinated by medical proceedures and in effect becomes a trainee nurse and romantic interest. Despite a lot of trepidation on the part of Jin and opposition from those he encounters (the radical nature of today's surgery verses traditional non-invasive/superstition based practices causes much angst)circumstances conspire to make him do more operations and his reputation spreads such that he starts to encounter people he knows were pivotal in Japanese history. He is very worried that he may change the course of history by saving those that would have died.....and his worries are not groundless he finds.

The recreation of Edo (Tokyo) at the time and the habits, beliefs and lifestyles of the inhabitants are done really well to this knowledgeless observer. The acting is great and you are really drawn in, wondering how things will turn out...will he change history radically...should he save a certain life...will he remain and marry the girl...how can he hide where he got all his medical knowledge...will he get back to the present where there is a pressing personal problem waiting...and more!

I can only say that I thoroughly enjoyed this series and would recommend it to anyone. IMHO on a par with any top series made in the West.

Get it.

8466836,5,B005DHSEX0,"Despite the previous ratiings, I found both Jin 1 and Jin 2 very entertaining.  Not only is there drama but also a lot of medical/scientific history in the story.  I thought Haruka Ayase should have had a bigger part in the drama but that is my opinion.  Other than that, I thought the drama was pretty well written and Haruka Ayase really helped the main character, Jin, in getting the drama to the level of a real drama.",1350345600,3,422,4.384615384615385

When we turned on the English subtitles we were stunned.  The English made little to no sense.  My wife said it looks like a Chinese person translated Japanese into English.  It makes very little sense in English.  Charater names have shancged to ""Wind, Laughter, and Dr. Southern Southern""  She was embarrased that someone may think a Japanese national would translate with such an inferior degree of skill.",1341187200,4,572,5.01063829787234
