8393003,1,B003AKJN0K,"I purchased this for a friend who wanted to see it on our giant screen.  Aside from a few very striking location shots, I found it all too clumsy, primitive, and often very repetitive and confusing.  One odd flaw:  English subtitles were often hard to read as they were superimposed over French subtitles.  It seemed that the translator's command of English was very poor, and there were many obvious typos.  I was wondering if being from Brazil, where the film was made, would have made the whole thing much more understandable.",1526947200,,529,4.769230769230769
8393004,5,B003AKJN0K,"Finally, I got my copy. Hadn't seen this movie since probably 1972, and never had the chance to see it again. Transfer quality is not 10/10, but being the only available version, it's OK.",1382227200,,187,4.529411764705882
8393005,4,B003AKJN0K,"I take a star off this superb movie with great regret.  I awaited it with such excitement since I had not seen it since the New Yorker Theater 40 years ago and had such a fond memory of it.  What a disappointment when, upon inserting it in my region 1 DVD player, I immediately saw a screen announcing its incompatibility.  It did play on my computer using Realplayer.  However, I could not devise any strategy to activate the English subtitles.

Now the good news.  The print of the film here had lost none of its rich vibrant color.  The music track is every bit as exciting as I remembered.  If you know the basic story and have even a fragmentary knowledge of Portuguese, it is not hard to follow.  It can be watched as one of the most fantastic music videos of all time.  The glue of the soundtrack is the exultant african chorale music of Minas Gerais (the last film I watched before this was Herzog's ""Cobra Verde"" and this makes a fascinating companion piece to the West African chorale music therein).  But there are also Portuguese fado ballads, something that sounds like Bethany Beardslee singing Schoenberg and a final piece that sounds more like Mississippi blues than anything else I've ever heard from Latin America.  So, if you can stand to watch something incredibly beautiful (the sweeping vistas of the Brazilian Sertao and the aforementioned rich coloration) set to an uplifting soundtrack, I would not be offput by the lack of subtitles (there were some partial French subtitles to some of the songs that helped me).

Finally, someone is going to say ""magical realism""; there is nothing here that violates the rules of realism except that the action is as stylized as a Greek play and the dialogue equally poetic in its flow.  This is not a Caixao Ze (Coffin Joe) movie with demons popping up every few seconds.  The only thing disorienting is that we are kept unsure of what time this is taking place in - it seems 19th century until trucks rumble through.  Someone is going to say ""spaghetti western""; but again the action and dialogue are too stylized to really bear any such semblance - the only similarity is that there are some knife & gun fights.  This is something very original for its time (or this one) and should be taken on that basis.",1300060800,5,2270,4.620947630922693
