8279782,5,B001AUHPWK,"There are two DVD's that deal primarily with Zebra.
This one by National Geographic and ther other by PBS ""The Great Zebra Exodus""
Both follow different Zebra migrations in Africa.  ( see the bottom for a comment on "" Rhino Wars)""
Zebra have a need for the right sort of grass and a good supply of Water. This often determines the route of the migration. They eat the available grass and either move on or move further afield for food. This pushes them to the limit of there thirt, were they return to drink and are straight off again on the long hick to the food. This taxes the old, the sick and the weak ,who often die.
There are many predators around. Loins particularly like Zebra and it is differcult for a zebra adult to survive a attack by a group of Loins working together.
Highlight for me.
Apparently young daughters stay with their Kindred ( Harem ) group.
When seehe becomes of age to mate the most suitable young stallion seeks to lead her away.
Her every vigilant father challenges the Stallion to a test of Strenght and particularly Stamna. The fight is no holes barred, and can go on all day. Basically he is seeing if the stallion has what it takes to defend his daughter and her offspring.
If he is indeed strong enough he get her but she may choose not to mate with him until he has defended her against other challengers..
One she anxious stallions looking for lost family members, be they scattered at a water hole, or after a recent encounter with Loins or from overnight when they are a lot more vulnerable to predators whose night vision is neither than there own.the stallion sea he's hard to find missing members.if mares have died, their ranking may change.
The lead mare and her foal always lead the way,this is the Stallion's favourite mare and he grooms her the most.
The lead mares know the way to food and where to drink.
The lesser mares follow in terms of rank with the most junior at the back.

The stallion is usually at the back, but takes up his position depending on need.
The mare and stallion defend and care for their offspring vigourously.
If a foal loses it's mother no other zebra wll adopt it even if it has lost its offspring.
If an old stallion dies his foal in the womb is at great risk, the new harem Stallion may cause the mother to about, and then mate with her ( mating takes place several weeks after birth.)
The other risk is infanticide as was graphically shown in PBS ""The Great Zebra Exodus near the end of the documentary-- not suitable for younger viewers.
The basic point is that a stallion who is lucky enough to get a ready made harem, does not tolerate the unborn ,or just born foals of the previous, now dead stallion.

One sad point
There is a brief hunting period on zebra, and the great Stallions are in the gun sight for there skins. They are skinned and the vultures remove all the flesh in a matter of minutes.
This brings disaster to many a harem group that loses its leader and defender

The photography is first clas, the commentary excellent.
There are a number of fairly close shots of Zebra, in the savanna, at rivers or watering holes, tracking through bush country. More distant shot may be less distinct, this may be due to dust, sand etc.

I liked both the PBS documentary and this National Geographic Documentary.. I leant a lot from both

Rhino Wars is what it's title suggests.
Black Rhinos are being poaches to extinction.

The horn is much valued in Yemen for the handles of daggers and in the Orient there horn is used in traditional medicine for several centuries.
Details of sexual reproduction were unclear at the time of the documentary ( late 70's to 80's is my guess.)
The gestation period is long and the calf is vulnerable.
The female may well find it hard to find a dominant male to breed with.
One sees various scenes with Rhino but much of it is about poaching and it's severe effect on Rhino numbers.",1436745600,,3900,4.461430575035063
8279783,5,B001AUHPWK,"Zebras: Patterns In The Grass, is the movie I'm commenting on. I saw this documentary on VHS tape years ago, and I liked it. This documentary is about the annual migration of Zebras across the African Savanna. They encounter hungry lions, and other predators along the way, and have to constantly out-run the lions to escape with their lives. This are beautiful animals in their natural environment, that's full of life-threatening danger. These animals are at peace with themselves, not bothering anybody, and will quickly win the sympathy of the average viewer.

Some escape from lion's, some don't, the ones who don't escape you feel sorry for because, they're too beautiful to be killed by lions just for food. I have always been the type of nature enthusiast, that always felt a sigh of relief when Zebra, or antelope being pursued by carnivores, escaped intact with their lives. The Zebras are very likable and innocent, the lions are less likable over the concern for the Zebras safety, and are viewed as a constant irritating threat. I saw this documentary again on DVD, and really wish it was on Blue-ray also.",1314748800,2,1119,4.889473684210526
