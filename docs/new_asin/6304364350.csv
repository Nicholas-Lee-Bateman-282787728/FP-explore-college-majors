849134,5,6304364350,"There is little to add except assent to all the raves about Domingo's Moor. This DVD was taken in 1995 when Domingo's Moor reached the fullest depths of interpretation imaginable, and when his vocal glories had scarcely begun to retreat. It is from a similar period that the greatest CD recording of the opera is taken - Myung-Whun Chung's Paris recording with Studer and Leiferkus (and Ramon Vargas sweet-toned Cassio).
Fleming sings a beautiful line and her mannerisms don't bother me at all. We must remember that this is taken fairly early in her stardom, and she has substantially deepened in her articulation of texts since then.
Morris' Iago is different, lacking high-baritone edge but gaining something else interesting with power and a kind of float. Richard Croft's Cassio is not sufficiently powerful to ride the opening drama (or at least not picked up on the DVD sound well enough).
Brian Large's video direction never gives me cause for complaint; Levine and the MET orchestra are everything you would expect. Picture Format 4:3; Subtitles Italian; English; German; French; Spanish; Chinese. Sound PCM Stereo; DTS 5.1 and Dolby Digital 5.1.
Any preservation of Domingo's Moor is worth having, this one is the best of them. The whole performance is surpassed musically by the Chung recording which has no weak links at all, but then of course it depends how much value you get from pictures!",1088121600,8,1405,5.0085470085470085
849135,5,6304364350,"I've never been a fan of Verdi's Otello, yet I have the recordings with Martinelli, Vinay, del Monaco, McCracken, Domingo and some of today's Otellos (Of whom nobody stands out in particular). My favourite Otello on disc is by far Ramon Vinay who recorded it live with young Renata Tebaldi. (Available here at Amazon btw --> http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0001LYGGW/qid=1087831237/sr=1-4/ref=sr_1_4/104-0578352-6919963?v=glance&s=classical
Domingo is an Otello in the tradition of Vinay, his baritonal tenor (He started as a baritone btw) being perfect for the jealous moor. Of course he lacks the acuti but Domingo never had a rock-solid C. To me it doesn't matter at all because his portrayal of Otello is absolutely stunning. Esp. the finale is moving and the fact that Domingo is a superb actor only adds more (...)here. Maybe not at his vocal best but the total package is absolutely incredible.
Now for his leading lady, a woman who like all great ones has aroused much controversy as well as hysteria. Having heard her live at last I can assert that Fleming's full lyric voice is indeed BIG, bigger than Cotrubas or Gallardo Domas. There's a ping to it now that shows maturity and spinto qualities but thank god she never went Ricciarelli's way who sang Elisabetta, Aida and even Turandot (On disc) in her youth (!). If she continues to look after herself like this she is following Freni's steps. BUT: I have to agree that she sometimes tries too much. Not being a mere deliverer of tones she always tries new ways, new colours and interpretations. Some work, some don't. Her earlier Il Pirata, which I have, was overdone but the late ones at the MET were perfectly balanced and incredibly moving. She is a singer who matures through experience. I found her Bel Canto CD not to be ghastly but refreshingly lucid, if unusual. As her development shows (E.G. the Pirata) she knows perfectly well what she's doing. The Desdemona she portrays here is hauntingly beautiful and vocally impeccable. Add to that she's also a magnificent actress and you have a top notch performer. Someone at ther Belcanto CD suggested she should sing Turandot&Tosca (!) and I thank God that Miss Fleming doesn't heed advice like that. Her instrument doesn't have the steel and column of sound for either role. It is a joy to behold how she revives rarities like Alcina, Rosmonda d'Inghilterra, Rusalka, Thais etc. etc. instead of singing the warhorses. I cannot wait to hear her as Thais next year (Already have my ticket) and add to that that her partner will be Thomas Hampson and you have operatic heaven. The accusation of ""mannerisms"" is as old as singing itself and it's getting stale. Farinelli was attacked with it, Patti was, Lotte&Lilli Lehmann were as were Schipa, de Lucia (!), Hempel, Schwarzkopf, Rysanek (!), della Casa (This wonder of elegant singing!), Pavarotti, Sutherland, Sills  and so forth. It is only natural that a singer has good moments and bad ones. But to declare the entire artist to be mannered is not only unjust but also rather vicious. I for one find Sills' and Sutherland's overembelleshing every belcanto part they ever did (They had extra cadenzas etc. written in case because what the composer wrote wasn't enough) to be mannered but it doesn't bug me so much that I cannot enjoy their artistry. In one sentence: Fleming is a great Desdemona and a great artist.
James Morris is a perfectly nasty Iago, yet I prefer Bruson in this role. Bruson, this Verdian hero, was an elegant villain and stole the show from Cura (At 65) when Cura sang Otello in Vienna. Levine's conducting is bombastic as usual and a great asset. A wonderful DVD of Verdi's masterpiece. Two thumbs up!",1087776000,6,3708,4.9423076923076925
849136,5,6304364350,"I have just finished watching this stunning performance of Otello. The performance is so incredible that I feel absolutely compelled to write this review.
The biggest glory of this set is the absolutely stunning portrayal of the moor Otello by Placido Domingo. I've never been a huge Domingo fan (although I certainly respect him greatly). I tend to think that he has his fingers in too many pies. But this performance has changed my view completely. Domingo is not only vocally in superb form, his intense dramatic portrayal is electrifying! He loses all self-consciousness on stage and becomes Otello - there is no hint that he even thinks he is singing in an opera, he is so absolutely consumed by the role. Every expression on his face is under his absolute control. This is one of the most gripping portrayal of an operatic character I've ever seen. In this performance, Domingo absolutely blasts everyone else away - Fleming, Morris, Croft....
The second glory of this set is the absolutely ravishing soprano of Renee Fleming. Renee Fleming is also very much into her character. It is somewhat cruel to juxtapose Fleming's Desdemona with Domingo's towering Otello. Because you sense that Fleming's characterization is weaker than Domingo's. But that doesn't mean that Fleming cannot act - just that Domingo is simply too good in this role. In any case, Fleming's dramatic portrayal is also very intense - you feel and see her emotions and sorrow throughout the opera. She is a picture of chaste innocence in Act 1. In Act 2, her shock and grief are palpable. In Act 3, she gives Desdemona a somewhat stronger character than usual when Desdemona denies any marital infidelity. Her sorrow is heart-rending when Domingo accuses her of infidelity and finally, curses her at the end of Act 3. In Act 4, her Willow Song and prayer tugs at your heart strings. To top it all, Fleming's voice is absolutely ravishing. In some of her recent recordings, she has adopted some mannerisms. NOT SO DOWN HERE. She sings beautifully, and her singing projects her emotions but she does not overdo things nor does she engage in some of the somewhat irritating mannerisms of late.
James Morris is an excellent Iago. He acts well but certainly falls a little short of Fleming's or Domingo's intensity. Nevertheless, he is vocally excellent.
I like Cassio here. Not only is he really handsome, he is very much into his character and he is vocally in superb form.
The set, by Elijah Moshinsky, captures the Shakespearen atmosphere superbly. It is the exact same set (with very minor changes) as the 1992 Convent Garden Otello with Solti, Domingo, Kanawa and Serkus. It is a fantastic set.
James Levine's conducting is also superb. The tension never slacks and the drama keeps flowing.
An exceptionally fantastic production from the Metropolitan opera.
I've been following the recent Met releases - Fidelio with Karita Mattila and Ben Heppner, Tristan and Isolde with Jane Eaglen and Ben Heppner. And now this Otello with Domingo and Fleming. The Metropolitan Opera has really surpassed itself with all these 3 releases. They are all the best I've ever seen.
The 1998 production of Samson Et Dalila with Domingo & Olga Borodina ia scheduled for release in June 2004. I'm looking forward to it.
Also, the Met has actually videotaped Karita Mattila's stunning 2004 Salome. Because of lack of funding, it is stil waiting to be broadcast. But why wait? Every opera fan should WRITE IN TO THE MET and ASK THEM TO RELEASE IT IMMEDIATELY.
Go to the Met Website and find their contact email, and WRITE IN AT ONCE to ask them to release this incredible 2004 Salome.
In addition, The Met has videotaped the 2003 Ariadne Auf Naxos (Deborah Voigt) and the 2001 Wozzeck - all awaiting telecast due to lack of funding. Write in to tell them we want these on DVD. Show them our support.
Yes, don't even think about not buying this DVD!! In fact don't even think about not buying the Met 2001 Fidelio or Met 1999 Tristan and Isolde. These are already classics!!!",1082160000,17,4028,4.839130434782609
849137,5,6304364350,"This DVD is a new release of a video Otello starring Placido Domingo in the title role. On DVD, there are already at least 3 of his Otellos, but this one surpasses them all.
Domingo is outstanding, a bit better than in the Covent Garden production. He is in great voice, singing and acting magnificiently. There are some few strained passages (""vil cortigiana"", ""venere splende"") but somehow they come out exciting as well.
Morris and Fleming are of equal greatness. Morris has played an evil, manipulant Iago in his voice, and Fleming as Desdemona is the best I have ever heard.
Levine as conductor is great as well. His job must have been ""easier"" with this incredible cast.
The overall ""movie impression"" is worth of a great Hollywood piece of art. Not only is the singing outstanding but the acting of all the cast is incredible. I have never seen that before in any other opera DVD. When Otello slaps Desdemona you would actually jump of your seat as I've never seen such a realistic scene. Otello's fainting in the 3d act couldn't be more realistic. This list is long and encompasses the ""Esultate"", the act1 love scene, ""Ora e per sempre""....and all the great ones.
At the end of the performance, you couldn't but join your screaming and cheers to those of the Met crowd.
Finally, a lot still argue about Domingo in the title role, and compare him to Vickers and Del Monaco. While everyone has his own opinion on the subject, let's be objective for a second:
Del Monaco's DVD in black and White with lips problem cannot compare to this good DVD production. Vicker's with Karajan has cuts, awful overall acting, and again lips problem, even though performance is amazing.
This is the BEST AVAILABLE OTELLO DVD (to date, I have said that same sentence when reviewing Covent Garden's.)
I highly Recommend it!",1082073600,104,1812,4.719242902208202
849138,5,6304364350,"I've seen Domingo perform Otello live about 24 times including being in the audience the night this was filmed as well as opening night.  This was the most magical night in all my years of going to opera.  The electric energy flying around the stage between the principals and the audience was almost unbearable.  While waiting in line to see Renee backstage, the prompter (she has been with the Met some 40 years) asked if we had seen the opening night performance and we answered in the affirmative and she said ""Well, I think tonight was better, in fact, I think it is the best performance of Otello I've ever seen!""  And, I figure she's seen a few including those of Domingo.  His acting in this performance is superb! He is Otello!  James Morris was manipulative, evil and charming at the same time.  Renee was a wonder!  In fact the reviewer at the time for the L. A. Times said it should have been called ""Desdemona"" so enchanted with her performance was he.  She had just given birth to her second daughter 3 weeks earlier and apologized to us for greeting us in her dressing room sitting down!  After she falls on the floor, sings on the floor, runs and puts her entire heart and soul into her performance!  The lady was forgiven!  Domingo was in an extremely good mood after an opera that usually totally exhausts him!  He knew that this was a very special performance.  Thank you Met for broadcasting this as I watch it frequently and my tape is almost worn out!  I've been waiting for this opera to be released as one of the most outstanding productions and casts ever of my favorite opera and now they have done it!  If you can only buy one DVD this year, make it this one!  Also, it's history, as you'll never see him again, or anyone else, I wager, that can come close to capturing the character and singing it as well as he does.  This is opera magic!!!",1081987200,133,1869,4.431085043988269

849140,5,6304364350,"Placido Domingo surpasses himself with the magnificence of his singing. In addition, Renee Fleming proves that the best singers of today can hold up to the best singers of yesteryears. Her Desdemona is incredibly gorgeous. With her glorious and creamy voice, it is no wonder that Otello is so enamoured of Desdemona and so jealous!! Morris is excellent as Iago - he certainly has the vocal heft for the part (but of course, since he is the Wotan of this decade).
Buy this DVD!! It is a superb production not to be missed. While it is true that Domingo's Otello is very well documented (in fact, one wonders if it is too well-documented - shouldn't Ben Heppner have a chance?), this is Fleming's ONLY record of her Desdemona.

849141,5,6304364350,"This is one of the all-time desert island opera films. It catches some of the best recent singers in top form, and in an ingenious production. Obviously, people knew this performance was going to be something special, since you can see royalty in the boxes of the Covent Garden Opera House.
Placido Domingo has ruled Otello for about thirty years, and you couldn't ask for a better performance than he delivers here. He sings with the maturity only a man of his age could provide, but his voice sounds years younger than it really was. His acting and singing are positively Shakespearean.
Desdemona is not nearly so deep a role but it is certainly a beautiful one, and Kiri Te Kanawa gives us some ravishing tones. She and Domingo obviously work well together and they make a wonderful stage couple here.
Sergei Leiferkus is a controversial Iago here as elsewhere, but I've never had the slightest problem with him for these reasons: he's fabulously talented (listen to the perfectly executed runs in the drinking song), he makes his somewhat gritty voice sound appropriately villainous, and his acting is about ten times more nuanced than almost all other opera singers.
Sir Georg Solti leads a typically explosive and dramatic orchestral performance; his dynamism is perfectly suited to this opera, and he shapes the quiet and beautiful phrases well too.
All this takes place in the context of a very well-thought-out stage production, which is basically realistic but full of interesting touches which keep it from being at all mundane.
Performances of this caliber are extremely rare, and we are lucky to have this committed to video (and DVD: I hope to replace my VHS soon). If you love opera, do yourself a treat and get this movie!",1059264000,12,1738,4.875
849142,4,6304364350,"This live Covent Garden performance is a stellar event...Domingo, the most famous modern Otello, the sublime Te Kanawa, the evil Leiferkus and the brilliant fiery Solti all together for a memorable Gala evening of Great Verdi.
In the title role, Domingo sings and acts well, but his Otello is so overly documented (two commercial recordings,the Maazel film and soundtrack, the famous Scala performance and pirate recordings from 1976...did I miss any?), that there really aren't any surprises. He's pretty much at his best here. Too bad there isn't a live Vickers or MacCracken performance for some balance...
Te Kanawa looks and sings sublimely, and this is the true reason to get this tape. Though she has recorded extensively, there isn't a whole lot of her visually, and to catch her live in one of her best roles is a real treat.
Leiferkus, much criticized for being too light weight may be more ideal for the part than he's given credit for. Much of the part is lyrical, with a high tessitura, meza voce in Era la nott, or a light and agile pizzacato in Questa  una ragna. Far too often we're hearing bassos doing baritone roles, and it's refreshing to hear a less heavy or power-house interpretation.
The ever controversial Solti, assistant to Toscanini at Salzburg in the late 30's, conducts with the vigor of a man half his age. It's good to have a document of him conducting a live opera.
Brian Large, to me vastly over-rated, directs with much attention to detail...so much that often the larger picture gets lost. Do we REALLY need an extensive close-up of Domingo's right eye and nostril as Desdemona lays dying? THis would be a case in point for multi-angles in DVD.
All in all, a really good performance of some of the finer interpreters of Otello today. And don't go by a bored Diana's obligatory applause, this is truly a grand event!",1013126400,5,1851,4.766355140186916

849448,5,6304364350,"Domingo has owned this role for decades...no one has ever come close.  The man's looks, his stage presence and the power and beauty of his voice make him ideal for the part.  As for his acting...Laurence Olivier (no mean Othello himself), after seeing Domingo in Verdi's Otello in Vienna, ""ruefully remarked that Domingo acted it as well as he had done himself - 'and,' he added, 'the bloody fellow can sing as well!'""  And HOW he can sing!...with his voice, as well as with the rest of him.  Listening to him sing ""Dio! mi potevi scagliar"" is listening to a man in deepest agony over the betrayal of his wife...the pain in his voice is palpable and real.

This is a superb production with splendid, experienced singing actors all around.  Renee Fleming is a superb Desdemona, and James Morris is wonderful as Iago.

Some reviewers take it upon themselves and try to ""dispel the myth"", so to speak, saying that Plcido Domingo's claim to fame is undeserving. Well, perhaps this could convince them?  If not, then I'll have to assume their convictions are guided by something other than the man's artistic merits. Who knows what it could be.

At any rate, this is the DVD to treasure.  I actually watched this performance and taped it in 1995, and had to live with that old tape for a long while that it took DG to finally release it.  And re-watching it now in splendid color and sound I'm just as awed as I was nineteen (!) years ago.  Back then I already knew Domingo's art having seen him in various productions and the famous ""Three Tenors"" concerts.  But this was still a revelation.  He doesn't just ""act"" Otello, he IS Otello, completely believable from start to finish.  His voice was still miraculously in near-top form, if not quite like in the 70s to mid-80s, when he was a vocal powerhouse, but still very close.  And his dramatic gifts and musicality improved significantly by the time this production was staged.  His partners - Rene Fleming and James Morris - were perfectly cast to compliment his fiery Otello.  She - with sensitivity, vulnerability and gorgeous tone, and he - with suavity, imposing figure, and a pitch-black bass-baritone.

Together they create a world that's dark not only visually, but somehow the very atmosphere seems to get denser and denser.  Under Elijah Moshinsky's splendid direction, every wall and angle, every phrase, step and gesture seem to further box-in the doomed Otello.  This effect is so gradual, it's easy to miss its deliberateness, but it all is so perfectly timed, it's actually distressing.  Several moments are so eerie, it sends shivers down your spine, e.g. Iago's distainful ""here's your Lion!"" or Otello's ravishing ""Dio, mi potevi, scagliar!"" (possibly the best on record), or Desdemona's heartbreaking ""addio, Emilia!"" - just a short recollection of highlights. The sets are massive; the opening storm really does look like a storm, it's a movie-like production, where everything is larger-than-life.

Rene Fleming made the world take notice that night. While her tone may be similar to Te Kanawa's, her acting and dramatic involvement is at a whole another level.  Amusingly, she still had a bit of ""baby-weight"" since this was staged soon after she gave birth to her son, but it was easy to see what an alluring woman she was (and still is!). I don't understand why she wasn't recorded as Desdemona on this set&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Verdi-Otello/dp/B000001GLM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Verdi: Otello</a>&nbsp;just one year prior instead of much older-sounding Cheryl Studer. Her voice and delivery - surreal, one easily understands Otello's love, but his jealousy would still be hard to buy, had it not been for James Morris's Iago.  While he did sing Italian opera before, his most memorable role was Wagner's Wotan.  Turns out, his Iago is superb.  He can sing piano with that subtle snarl or with velvety consoling intonations just as well.  While he isn't downright scary as Milnes, for example, he is very much an evil puppeteer, who easily takes up a center stage (no pun intended) and makes every situation work to his advantage.  Cassio of Richard Croft is also cast perfectly.  Too often this role is given to an average comprimario tenor, but Croft is a good-looking young fellow with an agile bright voice, and it makes Iago's plan all the more believable. Jane Bunnell is a strong and well-acted Emilia, and a fabulous Russian bass Aleksandr Anissimov sings a regal Lodovico.

The role is well performed but doesn't really match 2 important elements of the role of Iago. 1---What is is his motivation to destroy Otello? 2---His complete decent into evil isn't portrayed. Iago is a jerk in this production, no doubt. But he isn't the agent of the devil that Verdi intended (I believe).

A great performance, yes. You'll love it. Don't let me discourage you from buying this beautiful DVD. But as I learn to appreciate opera, I look for characteristics that run deeper than a good performance.

By the way, it's very hard to choose a DVD from the reviews. Now I really do understand why. My own opinion is rather subjective.

The role of Otello, performed by PLACIDO DOMINGO becomes an unworthy heroe, after a glorious militar life. Iago, performed by the great JAMES MORRIS is a proof of how the mankind can make a slaughter with the feelings of the others. Rene Fleming as Desdemona has a sweet voice, worthy of this role, but, in my opinion, there is a lack of power in her presence. Katia Ricciarelli in this role could have been more sensual and perhaps could have made a better performance. I highly recommend this DVD.",1310515200,,645,4.6173913043478265

Having said that, I admit that no DVD compares to a live performance, and to me this DVD (when compared to the version of Domingo/Frittoli/Muti/La Scala) failed to capture a lot of the overwhelming sound effects such as that of the chorus singing full blast or the low register rumblings in the initial scene ""Una vela"".  I don't know if it's a balance problem in the film making, editing or Levine's own judgment.  The Met orchestra itself sounds great, but I would recommend buying the version with Muti and La Scala, instead.  There the brass can get out of tune sometimes, but Muti's tempi are more convincing and the sound of the DVD is a lot richer and more complete.  Finally, I'm only a violinist, but to me Frittoli is also better than Te Kanawa or Fleming in this role. Just my 2 cents.",1278979200,22,899,4.4573170731707314

James Morris is good as Iago, but the part could do with a bit more malevolence. Placido Domingo has virtually owned this role for the past 3 decades and is superb. Compared to the Solti / Covent Garden filmed performance, I found his Met portrayal less engaging to begin with, but it builds up to a shattering climax.

Outstanding video.
The acting and singing are very good and convincing.
Otello's troubled personality which goes from love to jealousy, anger and finally to murder and suicide is well performed by Placido Domingo.
Morris and Renne Fleming are of equally great, he has played a manipulative and evil character and the lovely Desdemona shows her love to Otello until the end.
Levine was great as usual.
The rest of the cast was wonderful as well as the staging.

It is easily the most powerful acting performance by a tenor I have ever seen in an opera.  I also heartily disagree with reviewers criticizing his voice.  If you want to hear a crappy Domingo performance, watch the Karjan Trovatore!  He is sublime here.  Equally so is Renee Fleming, so perfectly cast.  The sets, orchestra, and chorus are stellar.  There are only two things wrong here.  One, is James Morris as Jago.  He's a great bass, but he leaves off the top notes in ""Inaffia l'ugola,"" which is hugely disappointing.  By no means is he terrible, but his acting was minimal at best and he lacked the upper register of better Jago's like Leo Nucci.  The other disappointment is that when Otello stabs himself, there is no blood.  I know it's asking a LOT from an opera house to either show some blood or hide the wound, but here they do neither.  It's a very distracting way to end the opera, if you ask me.  But this DVD will be watched many times!",1230336000,3,1057,4.494736842105263

Domingo is too old for the vocal demands of the role and never had the right voice for the part, anyway. Otherwise, the performance is excellent and Renee Fleming's Desdemona can not be possibly bettered. I must admit to not being a huge fan of this opera, with its moronic hero and bombastic musical writing, but do have a favorite performance, which is a Tokyo production with Del Monaco, Gobbi, and Erede conducting.

Placido Domingo has some  moments in which his voice sounds forced, particularly in ""Si, pel ciel"", but on the whole, the production is excellent, with great, exciting conducting by James Levine, a very good and believable Iago in James Morris, and a really good Cassio and Emilia.
The true star of the production, however, is Renee Fleming, who is simply spectacular as Desdemona. She sings like an angel, with wonderful expression and some ravishing pianissimi. Definitely the best Desdemona I've ever heard.
The staging is very lush and the costumes gorgeous, but I really can't understand why the old Met production, which was beautiful, wasn't kept on for a few more years. I'm sure there are other Met productions far more in need of updating.",1217203200,,792,4.954887218045113

And his second act with Domingo took this to this to another level. It left me breathless. The last act was so moving it brought me to tears. The pace was perfect throughout, and builds to a fantastic climax. I'll probably never get to see Domingo perform this live...but this is a wonderful record of a role that he totally owned.

Domingo's performance of progressively getting more and more distrusting, angry, and jealous was perfect. I thought I was really seeing a man lose his faith in his wife's honesty and finally he lost his mind, only to find the truth too late. His anger left him entirely, with only sorrow on his face. I don't even think the audience would have seen half the detail of the zoom-in shots, but they WERE all their characters, right on the mark. I did not see actors and singers putting some show up, I saw a drama unfolding before me until the last bit of music faded away for the audience to explode in a well-deserved ovation.",1184630400,4,938,4.550295857988166
849819,5,6304364350,"La versin discogrfica de Otello en DVD, del Metropolitan Opera de NYC, puede considerarse como una de las ms vlidas y completas disponibles en video. Las razones son mltiples, y paso a enumerar cada una de ellas; en primer lugar dispone del ms importante Otello de los ltimos veinticinco aos, es decir, Plcido Domingo. El gran tenor espaol logra una de sus ms completas interpretaciones de Otello. Para el ao de 1996, ao de grabacin de este DVD, Plcido Domingo se encontraba en excelentes condiciones vocales, a lo que debe inclursele una profundizacin del personaje, que Domingo no haba logrado en las grabaciones de los ochenta con Levine y Maazel. El personaje que muestra Domingo en este DVD, es mas completo, con momentos de furia como el ""Esultate"", pero tambin evidenciando un falso autocontrol en todo el segundo acto, no estallando en clera con anticipacin, como conviene a un personaje sumamente inseguro y acomplejado como lo es el de Otello. Mientras que en el tercer acto, resulta muy expresivo en el ""Dio mi potevi..."" y amenazante en todo el do con Desdemona. Por otro lado,  Rene Fleming como Desdemona es, junto con Barbara Frittoli, la mejor opcin en la actualidad para este personaje verdiano. Su voz es de muy bello timbre, aterciopelado y con un Mdium importante. Su Desdemona no es nicamente un personaje angelical a ultranza, sin nervio alguno, que si bien no desecha ese lado dulce de Desdemona, resalta tambin de manera muy original la reaccin airada y desafiante del do del tercer acto con Otello. Mientras que su ltimo acto no est cantado solamente con mucha musicalidad y gran tcnica, si no de manera muy expresiva. James Morris como Jago, es todo un acontecimiento, su voz de gran potencia y belleza, logra resaltar muy bien en los principales momentos de la obra. Su Jago es malvolo pero no un ogro de fbula, es ms bien un personaje que en apariencia es muy bueno, pero que en la realidad es un manipulador y detestable personaje. Este es el verdadero enfoque que se debe proporcionar al rol de Jago, si no, como se las arreglara para engaar con sus intrigas a Otello, si resultara tan evidentemente malvado. Su interpretacin del ""Sogno"" del segundo acto, cantado casi completamente en ""mezza voce"" como lo indica Verdi en la partitura, es un acontecimiento. Un gran Wotan, cantando Verdi. La direccin de Levine es increblemente buena, resalta de manera encomiable, pero sin excesos, los muchos momentos impresionantes de la partitura, pero tambin logra dar realce especial a todos los momentos dulces e ntimos de los que la partitura est llena. Entre los comprimarios, Richard Croft es un buen Cassio, de voz dulce y agradable, y de una presencia fsica perfecta para el rol, aunque su voz de tendencia dulce y lrica sufre un poco en lo vasta que es la Sala del Metropolitan Opera House. Alexander Anisimov result ser casi inexistente en el personaje de Ludovico, su voz es realmente poco incisiva e imponente. La direccin escnica de Elliah Moshinsky result ser excelente, los movimientos de los cantantes sobre el escenario fueron todos muy logrados, mereciendo una mencin aparte el magnfico tercer acto, de los ms logrados de los que haya visto en Teatro. Las escenografas de Michael Yeargan son colosales e imponentes, con un uso del color impactante. De hecho los enormes murales del tercer acto, inspirados en el pintor renacentista ""Il Veronese"" son realmente maravillosos. El vestuario diseado por Peter Hall es estticamente muy vlido y de gran calidad. Por lo que un Otello de esta calidad en todas sus componentes, no es algo fcil de encontrar. La versin del Covent Garden, con Domingo, Te Kanawa y Leiferkus, bajo la direccin de Solti, cuenta con una muy buena direccin, pero una puesta en escena menos lucida, y una soprano y bartono menos relevantes desde el punto de vista vocal. La versin de Vickers, Freni y Glossop, dirigida por Karajan, tiene una puesta en escena mediocre y un muy deficiente uso de las cmaras, as como un Jago no solo mediocre desde el punto vocal, sino tambin desde el punto de vista del fraseo. Es necesario reconocer, de todos modos, que desde el punto de vista musical, la orquesta de Karajan es fabulosa y el do Vickers-Freni es realmente magnfico (prcticamente ideal). La versin de la Scala de Milano, bajo la direccin de Muti, cuenta con la direccin orquestal mas impactante que se pueda imaginar, con una excelente Desdemona en Barbara Frittoli, y un vlido Jago en Leo Nucci, pero tambin con una puesta en escena mucho mas esttica que la del Metropolitan y un Domingo ya no tan fresco vocalmente, aunque siempre intenso como personaje. Por lo que la versin en DVD del Metropolitan Opera House es sin lugar a dudas la ms completa, sin tener eslabones dbiles",1171324800,9,4729,4.85997521685254

849910,5,6304364350,Verdi's music is powerful--his best opera in my opinion.  Domingo is THE Otello.  He sets the standard for all others who sing this role both in terms of musicianship and drama.  I can say virtually the same for Fleming.  The staging and musicianship are both outstanding.,1151971200,6,272,4.8478260869565215
849911,5,6304364350,"I've seen three DVD's featuring Placido Domingo in the title role: 1992 (Covent Garden), 1995 (The Met), and 2001 (La Scala). They are all high quality and worth owning but, in my opinion, this Met production has the best Desdemona (Renee Fleming), the best Iago (James Morris), and a stunning performance by Placido Domingo.

Some comparisons. Domingo's voice is clearest and most effortless in the Covent Garden production. But his understanding of the role deepens dramatically between 1992 and 1995. By 2001, he embodies Otello, but his voice is not as full-bodied and is strained in places. His overall best performance is in this 1995 production. This conclusion is not just a compromise between when he's youngest in voice (1992) and most experienced in acting  (2001). In Acts III and IV of The Met production, it feels as if Domingo is no longer performing; he becomes Otello. Words are inadequate to describe him here; it simply has to be experienced. His work in Otello's Act III soliloquy, the brief ""Dio! Mi potevi,"" is one of the finest two minutes I've seen in opera. And he is simply spellbinding in Act IV, as he crawls dying toward Desdemona, crying out for a kiss while the ""kiss theme"" from their Act I duet plays.

The three Desdemona's are Kiri Te Kanawa (1992 Covent Garden), Renee Fleming (1995 The Met), and Barbara Frittoli (2001 La Scala). All excel in different ways. Desdemona is a challenge to play. It's hard to convince an audience that she would so submissively accept the unjust fate she knows is about to befall her. Perhaps her love for Otello is so strong, she believes it will eventually bring him to his senses. Perhaps she's in a steadily increasing state of shock over his irrational behavior, shock that prevents her from acting. Perhaps she sees no choice but to accept whatever consequence follows from her bold move of having left her homeland to follow the Moor. These are but three possible approaches to the role.

For purity of voice and lyrical quality, Te Kanawa (Covent Garden) is unsurpassed, but her acting is weak. Some might call her portrayal of Desdemona restrained; I find it too wooden. But it's worth seeing Te Kanawa to hear the purity of her voice, especially in Act IV's ""Ave Maria"" prayer. Frittoli (La Scala) has a beautiful dark and dusky voice, and her portrayal of Desdemona as young and naive is moving.

But Fleming's Met performance surpasses the other two. Her voice is more expressive and she's a better actress. In Otello and Desdemona's Act I duet, ""Gia nella notte densa,"" I can hardly breathe when Fleming and Domingo get to the kiss. The tenderness between them is palpable. In their duet and her ""first tears"" solo at the beginning of Act III, Fleming's combination of incomprehension, pain, and fear is heartrending. In Act IV, Fleming draws us to her sadly but quietly in the Willow Song only to stun us with her cry of terror at the end: ""Ah! Emilia addio, Emilia, addio."" I've read that this one short cry must communicate all the passion of an entire song. That's a tall order and, in my opinion, only Fleming pulls it off.

Frittoli (La Scala) plays Desdemona as in an increasing state of shock. It's believable and effective, but Fleming's performance is deeper because it's multi-layered. To flesh out the character, I think Fleming incorporates all three of the approaches I described above, making Desdemona a more complex woman.

A performer can take several approaches to Iago. There is no subtlety in Sergei Leiferkus' approach (Covent Garden). He exudes slimy evil intent, looking crazed at times. I think there's also a sexual component to his characterization (whether aimed at Desdemona or Otello, I couldn't say). Leo Nucci (La Scala) takes a more traditional approach to Iago, playing him as a nasty schemer. But once again, I prefer The Met production's James Morris. His Iago is the most frightening to me because he's seemingly so personable around Otello. His smile and his smooth baritone voice run chills down my spine.

I prefer The Met DVD over the others, but you can't go wrong with any of the three. Bottom line, I recommend you don't miss Domingo as Otello in this powerful Verdi opera.",1146700800,38,4197,4.827538247566064
849912,5,6304364350,"Domingo is most certanly the best Otello so far. He really is the angry, jealous Moor. In this recording, from the Met Opera, we can really see that he understands the role and plays it superbly. Altdough a bit older, he still has the power to do it better than anybody else. He is especially good in Act 2, showing all the power (and the dificulty) of the role. With Domingo I like that his superb singing is accompanied by good acting, the fact that he feels tha stage, and all in all gives a splendid performance.

He is accompanied by James Morris, who is a fairly good Iago. When in comes to singing I actually prefer Justino Diaz (because his voice is deeper), but Mooris looks good, looks evil and cold ( especially when he sings ""Credo in Dio..."" and I find him to be good enough. He seems to be a good partner with Domingo, I think because he is a bit taller, that way realy giving the impression of power over Otello.

Rene Fleming is a high quality Desdemona. Her voice is strong when needed and soft when needed. Fleming is also a good actress. Combined with Domingo, they give a hell of a performance.

They are all accompanied by other good singers, making this Othello one that a true Verdian should have.

The Orchestra and the Chorus of the Metropilitan Opera are good, not as good as La Scala, but good. They are powerful enough, and seem to enjoy their work.

James Levine seems to be an expert on Othello. Although he runs it a bit faster (than Maazel or Muti), he makes it a high quality performance.

This is a good performance of Verdi's masterpiece, and especially if you are an operatic beguiner, you should have it.

849913,4,6304364350,"The grandeur of Verdi's late operas cannot be adequately captured on a video screen.  To some extent the closeups compensate for what one loses of the spatial reality of the theater.  In this DVD from the MET the cast is uniformly fine.  All the cast members are musically assured so that they are free to act their roles to the hilt.  They truly ""live"" their roles.

Domingo is superb as the moor.  Fleming, captured before her more mannered recent work, is luscious to hear and to see.  Morris is less convincing, not because he doesn't act or sing well but because he simply doesn't look very malevolent...this is where the closeups undercut the theaterical world of illusion.

The opportunity to see this great work live in an opera house doesn't happen too often and its unlikely that one could run into as strong a cast as appears in this performance.  We must be grateful that the opera is available to us in this form.",1122854400,15,926,4.597560975609756

849915,5,6304364350,"I first saw and heard Placido Domingo sing this role in the late seventies and early eighties, when the role was new to him. His interpretation then was that of a man in his early forties (where I am now), consumed by erotic fire and passion, and by anger at the racism and hypocrisies of the society in which he had risen, all of these emotions came together in his overwhelming and obsessive love for Desdemona.

Renata Scotto and Kiri Tekanawa both sang sensitive early interpretations of this misunderstood character, Desdemona, but Rene Fleming (though she is not a natural Verdi soprano) is simply unsurpassed in the delicacy and fragility of her phrasing, in her understanding of her character's love for this troubled man -- a love which makes her vulnerable and yet gives her strength.

With the passage of the years, Domingo's portrayal has become more sensitive and lyrical. The vocal heroics may not be what they were, though they still are in this late performance, but the infinite resignation and pathos of the final ""Niun Mi Tema,"" would have been utterly impossible for the younger tenor.

The sense of tragedy and loss conveyed in this performance defies description or summary: it has to be experienced to be believed. It ensures Domingo's place as perhaps THE greatest ""Otello"" of the twentieth century. He joins the ranks of his heros -- Ramon Vinay, Giovani Martinelli and Mario Del Monaco in performing this greatest of all dramatic Operatic roles.

849916,5,6304364350,"This 1996 Otello, live from the Metropolitan Opera, was my very first Otello.  It is one of my favorite operas and this production is still among my favorites.

  Domingo gives a great performance.  His moor sounds a little nasal in the Esultate, but settles back into real spendor during the Gia La notte duet.  Clearly his 2 decades as the moor have made him the finest actor of the part in anyones memory.  the second act is a real challange for his

56 year old pipes, and he pinches slighly, seeming highly stressed going into the Si Per Ciel.  this, however, can be forgive, and almost adds to the desperation of the Drama.  Domingo is splendid in the 3rd act, delivering his usual brilliance.  His 1992 Otello, with Dame kiri, shows his voice under better control.

  James Morris, is pushing his Fach a bit for Jago.  Not a Verdian baritone, Mr Morris is more of a Wagnerian.  This causes a few unusual vocal occurances.  It means, to his credit, that his low notes are the firmest of all Jagos in my memory.  The problem is that there is a bit of strain on the top.  He also concedes to the High A's in the first act Drinking Song.  Nevertheless he is a wonderful Jago.  His Jago is not the bruttish monster that some, Like Justino Diaz or Milnes, he is the Machiavellian schemer, much like the Jago of Nucci.  his is a evil and intelligent Jago... very compelling.

  Desdemona is played by Renee Fleming, and played very very well.  She is an excellent Desdemona.. perhaps more Gentle and sypathetic than Kiri TeKanawa.  Her Pianissimo, and her use of chest is appropriate.  She was beutiful foil for Domingo.  (Incidently she looked beautiful in her lavish costumes)

  James Levine gets major credit for a briskly paced Otello (Most likely to accomadate the greatful singers Domingo and morris)  He leads the Met orchestra with his usual competence, and I am greatful for his wonderful, and unpretentious, reading.",1098662400,9,1927,4.673652694610778
849917,5,6304364350,"From all of Domingo's recorded live performances of Otello, this 1996 opening night from the Met is the one that I like the most. It is amazing to hear and see, more than 21 years after his debut in this role, such a well preserved voice, such a complete actor, and such a fantastic rendition of the most difficult tenor role from Verdi's opera. There are no transpositions, and there is only one brief moment at the end of Act 2, where his voice suddenly sounds tired, but this is the only such moment from the entire duration of the magnificent rendition of the score. Fleming, in one of her first Desdemona, sings very beautifully, and with a lot of passion, her opulent voice admirably suited to the role. Morris is trying to cope with notes lying to high for his stentorian bass-baritone, which lacks in some instances the suavity and vocal inflections one would expect, (all the high A-s were also omitted from the drinking song).The other roles are nicely sung, and the chorus and orchestra provide a solid support for the principals under the baton of Levine.",1095033600,13,1067,4.650793650793651

While the audio is very good, I found that I had to adjust the volume during playback.  It would get too loud and then when it was turned down, the softer passages were too quiet.  I realize that the dynamic range of ""Otello"" can be a challenge for sound engineers.  The EMI CD set from the Zefirelli film (which also features Domingo) has the same problem, but most other recordings do not.

7868558,5,6304364350,"I've seen Domingo several times in Otello and think this may be a definitive performance of this great opera. Everyone is in wonderful voice, all can/do act, and the production values are excellent.  If you only have one Otello to have in your library, this is the one.  Highly recommended.",1490918400,,290,4.78
