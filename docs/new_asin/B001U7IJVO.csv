3796821,5,B001U7IJVO,"We took our six-year-old granddaughter to see this movie and we all enjoyed it. I do dog rescue and my heart loved the message in the film that it is not okay to throw away our dogs when we are tired of them.  The kids in the movie get stuck with some horrible foster parents and they want to stay together--brother, sister and dog.  It is not all heart string pulling though; there are tons of funny moments in the film.  A definite family movie worth seeing.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Power-Path-to-Love/dp/1604941987/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Power Path to Love</a>",1240876800,3,618,5.623655913978495

3796823,4,B001U7IJVO,"Well, this movie hasn't totally gone to the dogs. Wasn't it W. C. Fields who said never act up against either a kid or an animal?  ""Hotel for Dogs"" best performances are by the shorter cast members be they two or four footed.

Andi (Emma Roberts) and Bruce (Jake T. Austin) are a pair of orphans living in possibly the world's worst foster home with Carl and Lois Scudder (Kevin Dillon and Lisa Kudrow). Dog food looks better than what Lois serves up for dinner and the music they play as a rock group has gone to the dogs.

Andi and Bruce at first appear to be a pair of cons.  They're selling rocks in shrink wrapped cell phone packaging to unsuspecting strangers. Turns out, they're not doing this for themselves, but to keep the family together and that means feeding Friday, the long gut mutt they've been hiding from the foster parents for the past three years.

When Friday ends up nearly kept by the Animal Control Officers, the sibs decide to make him a home in an abandoned hotel.  What they don't realize until they get there is that two dogs have already claimed the spot.  And well, the more the merrier as they devise a Rube Goldberg type apparatus to keep the animals fed, scooped and entertained while they are gone.

Unfortunately, things go awry. Will the plucky kids and their four legged family be able to keep the home they have carved out for themselves?  Go see the film to find out.  You'll be surprised how doggone funny it is.

3796824,4,B001U7IJVO,"So my brother and sister and their spouses are taking an ""emergency mental health day"" over to the casino boats and I'm pulling Uncle duty for a couple hours. We decide to go to the movies and I try to convince them to go see My Bloody Valentine 3D.
""We don't wanna see it."" they said, ""It scares us.""

""Why, I asked,"" because you're all a bunch of babies?""

""We're not babies! We're this many"", they said, holding up 3 fingers.

""Exactly. You're not babies. You're post-toddlers.""

""Uncle Hammoooooock! We wanna see Hotel for Dogs"".

  Well I thought, maybe it would be for the best to see Hotel for Dogs. If I take them to see it then maybe years from now when I'm a toothless old loon confined to a government nursing home the kids will remember this movie fondly and come around to visit me and shoo the flies off my face and maybe keep the attendents from stealing my teeth and underpants.
Besides, i could teach them how to mix Milk Duds with popcorn and the flask of ""Uncle Medicine"" I carry would smooth over any bumps, especially if I mixed it with a nice fizzy Tab. Okay, kids, Hotel for Dogs it is!

  Well sir, I was flabbergasted. This movie was much better than it looked in trailers and commercials. In the trailers, it looked like your average , dopey, mediocre kid movie. But it's better than that. The fine folks who made this film seemed to have put some actual thought and effort into entertaining our kids.

  Basically, you got these two kids, bother and sister, who have been in and out of various foster homes since their parents died. They are a handful, a couple of smart little con-artists. But they are motivated by the desire to stay together and remain as much of a family as possible, and this desire extends to their dog, Friday, whom they keep hidden from a string of foster parents who won't take kids with dogs.  Most of their schemes involve ways to feed or shelter Friday, but when that becomes too daunting a task they decide to bunk him in an abandoned hotel. One thing leads to another and eventually they are taking care of not only Friday, but  a whole pack of dogs. The stray children have created a family for themselves with other strays. Of course there is a serious threat to their happiness, which(do I need to say spoiler alert) is alleviated in the end and eveyone lives happily ever after. That covers the plot.

  There's a lot to like about this film. The acting is good. Lisa Kudrow and Kevin Dillon are especially funny as Lois and Carl Scudder, the stars of the Carl Scudder Experience, a low-rent rock lounge act that couldn't cut the mustard playing for a back-alley craps game much less at a venue in Vegas. They're more petty and selfish than evil, although Kudrow looks kind of like a white trash Cruella DeVil. Emma Roberts and Jake T. Austin do a good job as the kids. They're smart but not that wise-beyond -their -years smart you see in some movies. They look and act like actual kids.

  I should also mention the dogs. I'm generally not a fan of animals that ""act"" unless they're terrorizing the human population of a small town or island somewhere, but these dogs are often funny, even by adult standards. I think the trick is that the dog scenes are not overdone. They don't wear out their welcome for the grown-up crowd. Kids will love it. The mutts have their own little characteristics and traits but the crowd favorite was Cooper,  a big english bull dog who eats anything and everything, from license plates to ladies shoes.

  The movie was written by  Jeff Lowell,Robert Schooley ,& Mark McCorkle. Schooley and McCorkle created the Kim Possible series and helped write Sky High. They are developing a reputation for making quality family pictures that are fun, smart and imaginitive.

  The plot is simple but it's also well done. It's silly in ways that kids will enjoy but it's never insulting, pandering or overly sentimental.  And really, does a kid's movie need an intricate, detailed plot. Sure any adult who's lives in a country with free electricity is going to know how this thing turns out, but this movie really wasn't written for adults. It has humor in it that will keep an adults attention, but it's meant for th kids. A big part of the fun of seieng a movie like this with the kids is watching them watch the movie. Most of this stuff is new to them. They don't know for sure if the Hotel is doomed  when the dog catchers find out about it. They don't know if the brother and sister are going to remain a family. And they are completely surprised and tickled when the dogs perform cute and funny little stunts that dogs have performed for years. You can get a kick out of watching the suspense, surprise and joy play across their faces as the movie progresses.  It's one of those nice little films you can share with your family.",1233619200,88,4820,4.498277841561424
3796825,4,B001U7IJVO,"Ever since Rin Tin Tin and Lassie America has loved a good dog flick. Some have made us laugh (The Ugly Dachshund), some have made us cry (Old Yeller, Marley & Me), others are just plain fun (Beverly Hills Chihuahua). Nickelodeon/ Dreamworks' Hotel For Dogs falls into this category. Even though it's officially a comedy, there's still some real life thrown in.

Siblings Andi (Emma Roberts) and Bruce (Jake T. Austin) have been in and out of foster homes since their parents died, and up to now they've managed to stay together and keep their dog, a scruffy Jack Russell terrier named Friday, a secret. But the bubble's about to burst. When Friday's picked up by the dog catcher and they barely get him back, they realize he deserves a real home. They can't hide him in parks and behind dumpsters forever. Then one night Andi and Bruce stumble upon an old abandoned hotel, and the adventure begins.

In the vein of 2003's Good Boy (minus the talking dogs), Hotel for Dogs hits all the right notes in the balance of humor, mayhem and drama. Thankfully the film makers resisted the temptation to elicit laughs from potty jokes alone, although there's still a few appropriate gags involving doggie doo-doo that'll please the younger set. The ingenious inventions created by Bruce, like an automatic assembly line dog feeder, car ride simulator, and some hilarious mechanical sheep keep our disbelief thoroughly suspended, but they're also what make this film fun and kid-friendly.

Even though Hotel For Dogs' take-away is never heavy-handed, the subtle message of love for the unwanted, whether they be dogs or kids, isn't lost on viewers. It's a touching theme and the film's more serious element. But let's face it. We're watching Hotel for Dogs for the dogs. And there are enough of them here to fill a . . . er, hotel. Breeds all over the AKC map make appearances, but a Boston Terrier, Mastiff, Bulldog, Border Collie, and a Chinese Crested Hairless take center stage alongside lead dog Friday (played by a shelter rescue named Cosmo) who steals the spotlight even from his young human stars. Which isn't to say Roberts and Austin don't put on a great performance. Roberts, known for her roles in the films Nancy Drew and Aquamarine, plays the ideal older sister who wants to be the voice of reason but shares her brother's soft spot for pups. It won't be long before she's known for much more than being Julia Roberts' niece.

A few tense thematic moments involving the pound and stray dogs being put down (a dog is led out the back door rather roughly by one of the dog catchers and later the man returns alone) could be troubling to younger or extra sensitive viewers. I heard a parent whispering to their concerned child once or twice behind me in the theater. But aside from this, Hotel for Dogs is a wonderful movie the whole family can enjoy together. Be sure to watch the ending credits featuring the cast and crew with their real-life pets.

3796826,3,B001U7IJVO,"""Hotel for Dogs""--based on the book by Lois Duncan--is a cute kids film, but it's so grossly implausible that it's hard to focus on anything else. It tells the story of a group of kids that rescue stray dogs from the inner city and house them in an abandoned hotel. It's a fun idea, but as hard as I tried to suspend my disbelief, as much as I wanted to escape into pure fantasy, my brain would not stop analyzing the logistical issues this film never bothers to address. Maybe I'm too old for a movie like this. Then again, maybe it has nothing to do with age; a film geared towards children doesn't automatically have to preposterous beyond all reason. The people behind ""Hotel for Dogs"" seem to be taking the exact opposite viewpoint, and I find that very problematic. Kids will laugh at the jokes and fall in love with the dogs, but I seriously doubt they will believe that anything happening in the story is even remotely possible.

We're introduced to a teenage girl named Andi (Emma Roberts) and her younger brother, Bruce (Jake T. Austin), who have been foster children since the death of their parents some years earlier. Their social worker, Bernie (Don Cheadle), now has them living in Central City (Los Angeles in real life) with wannabe rock musicians Lois and Carl Scudder (Lisa Kudrow and Kevin Dillion), who don't care about the siblings one bit. For a couple of years, Andi and Bruce have been hiding ownership of an adorable Jack Russell terrier named Friday by keeping him in alleys, garages, and curbs; because the kids aren't given an allowance, they have to pay for dog food by scamming people, and this usually involves putting a rock in a cell phone box, covering the box in shrink-wrap, and taking it to the pawn shop. They haven't always gotten away with it, however, and Bernie is always there to cut them a break. But his patience is understandably wearing thin.

When Andi, Bruce, and Friday find themselves at odds with the law, they hide in a condemned hotel, where they discover two other stray dogs. The next day, when the siblings go to buy food for the dogs, they meet two young pet shop employees, Dave (Johnny Simmons) and Heather (Kyla Pratt), who then follow the siblings to the hotel and offer to help them care for the dogs. So does Mark (Troy Gentile), a teenage boy that has a crush on Heather. At this point, we learn that Bruce is an inventor, and when its decided that the hotel be converted into a dog shelter, he concocts a number of elaborate devices that cater to a dog's basic needs.

And now the questions begin. How were the kids able to turn the electricity and the water back on? Isn't it convenient that a condemned hotel just happens to have furniture, abandoned clothing, and even the old ledger from the front desk? Where exactly is Bruce getting his supplies? His foster parents accuse him of stealing from them late in the film, but I seriously doubt he relied on them for movie projectors, screens, fans, and detached car doors and seats, all of which are used to simulate the experience of going on a drive with the window rolled down. And while we're on the subject, who actually found stock footage of a highway shot from a moving vehicle? Where was it found?

The questions pile up as more strays are taken in. Where did the kids find an empty vending machine, and how were they able to fill it with things for a dog to chew on, like slippers and such? How is it they have enough money to provide the dogs with food? How did they set up the dining hall, which has a miniature train set pulling a series of dog bowls down the length of a massive table? When a dog has to use the restroom, it squats over an open hole and goes into a blue shrink-wrap bag, which is then carried along a conveyer belt, down a pipe, and into a dumpster: How were the dogs trained to go to one specific place for a restroom break? Do the kids really think that tossing dog waste into a dumpster is an adequate way to keep things clean? Furthermore, where did the conveyer belt come from? Or the blue shrink-wrap bags?

I think I've made my point. I'm probably looking too deeply into this, but come on, this is unrealistic even for a fantasy. It doesn't help that all the adult characters are flat, shallow caricatures. Carl and Lois are uncaring and clueless. Dogcatchers are ugly and vindictive. A young man sitting at a park bench is selfish, refusing to let Friday have his hot dog. The only exceptions to this are Bernie and his wife, who are kind, earnest, and accommodating. The kids, on the other hand, are plucky and fresh-faced, which I guess is appropriate given the kind of story being told. Still, it would have been nice to add a bit more depth to these characters. Other than the siblings, Dave, Heather, and Mark and extraneous, serving no real purpose other than to be humorous companions. And I never really bought the puppy love developing between Andi and Dave--if there's anything this story doesn't need, it's a whitewashed teenage romance.

If there is a saving grace for ""Hotel for Dogs,"" it's the fact that the dogs are loveable characters in their own right. It also promotes pet adoption and humane treatment. But that leads me to another thing about this story that bothers me: What about a hotel for cats? Dogs are not the only abandoned animals, you know. If Andi and Bruce were true animal rights activists, they wouldn't be so picky about which ones to rescue. Much like the film's plausibility factor, it was something the filmmakers overlooked.",1232064000,2,5522,4.550301810865191

3797029,4,B001U7IJVO,"Hotel for Dogs is a little sad, funny, and honestly, quite an adorable movie.
It's centered around two orphaned siblings - you never find out how they were orphaned - by the names of Andi and Bruce.
 Andi is the older sister who tries her hardest to keep the two of them together and Bruce is the younger brother who absolutely loves his dog, Friday, and has a knack for inventing things.
Together with a few other dog lovers they run into, turn an old run down hotel into a home for a lot of dogs that they rescue before the pound can get them.
Andi is played by Emma Roberts, the daughter of the famous Julia Roberts. Emma has been in Aquamarine, Nancy Drew, and It's Kind of a Funny Story.
Bruce is played by Jake T. Austin who is probably best known for his role as Max Russo on Disney Channel's Wizards of Waverly Place.
Jake has also voiced several characters such as Diego in Go Diego Go, Fernando in Rio, and Nicky in The Ant Bully.
As Andi and Bruce struggle to take care of the dogs, they run into trouble with the police and the pound. Their foster parents, Carl and Lois Scudder, find out that they have been stealing parts so that Bruce can make his gadgets to help entertain, feed, clean, and just take care of the dogs in general.
Andi and Bruce's social worker, Bernie, and his wife end up adopting them and the hotel is officially up and running as a doggy day care.
The movie is cute and entertaining to watch as a family movie or a kids movie. There are a few scenes that are rather awkward, like when one of the characters tries to hit on another and she's clearly not liking him.
Carl and Lois are ""musicians"" that are tone deaf and don't exactly have the best voices, so if you're musically inclined or even like music, it's kind of hard to listen when they are ""performing"". I suppose that's supposed to be funny, but I found it more painful than anything.
The one thing I hated the most was how heartless and cruel the people at the pound were. Yeah I get that they're just trying to do their job, and I know that they're supposed to be the antagonist, but really? Do they have to be that cruel?
All of the characters are unique, the dogs are adorable, the inventions are amazing, and the story is different. Honestly, my favorite part is when Bernie gives his little speech at the end to everyone in the hotel.",1410652800,,2335,4.306818181818182

3797238,2,B001U7IJVO,"I saw this movie playing on TV a while back. I thought the title and previews made the concept fun to check out since I happen to love any movie about dogs, even silly little kid movies. I didn't expect to be so annoyed and horrified by the depictions. I'm not going into great detail about how the kids act like petty thieves and crooks and never get reprimanded, since there are plenty of other reviews talking about that. No, I'm going to talk about how this film handled their depictions of animal shelters and pet overpopulation.

First the annoying part. Nearly all the strays are purebreeds. It was like seeing a lineup for the best in show at the AKC. Wikipedia has a very accurate list of every single dog that appeared in the film, and there were only two mixed breeds in the entire movie(a puggle and the other an unidentified mutt). This is pretty unrealistic since most dogs in shelters are mixed breeds, and the purebreeds that do show up typically are not obscure breeds like Wirehaired Pointing Griffons (Coco) and Beaucerons (Henry). So the lack of mutts as strays bothered me a bit. At least the dogs used were actually shelter dogs, so that's one good thing. Still, I do wish this movie would have tried to split the difference (maybe half purebreds and half mutts; or the leads be purebreds since they need identical doubles to film, and the rest of the non-important background dogs be mixes).

Next, the horrifying: The screenwriters of this film seriously need to spend some time working at an animal shelter and be properly educated on what shelters do versus pet stores. Pet stores do NOT adopt out cats and dogs. They SELL cats and dogs, and the dogs they get are from backyard breeders and puppymills. No responsible breeder would EVER give their pups to a pet shop. Yet some of the hero kids work at a pet shop that sells (again they call it ""adopt"") puppies. The pet shop and the kids working there are the good guys, the ones who ""truly care about the dogs"" and want them to get good homes. Was it too hard for the writers to turn the pet shop into a no-kill rescue group instead and have the kids be junior volunteers? Why did they think it okay to make heroes out of a business that ends up hurting animals in shelters and adding to pet overpopulation?

Speaking of overpopulation, two of their rescues fell in love and it was implied that they reproduced. And this is all portrayed as a heartwarming moment, instead of an unfortunate accident that will just end up sending more homeless pets to the shelters and eventually to be put to sleep.

The animal shelter workers on the other hand are portrayed like typical Disney villains. They hate animals and their only joy in life is catching and killing them. They practically cackle in glee as they terrorize strays, mocking them as they prepare to haul them to ""doggy jail"". People who actually work in animal rescue love animals and do everything in their power to get them adopted into good homes. No one likes euthanizing them, but is is an unfortunate task that comes with the job due to mass overpopulation. But with TV shows and movies like this portraying people who work in animal shelters as descendants of Cruella DeVille, I'll bet plenty of kids will never want to adopt a dog from Animal Care & Control because ""the workers kill animals"". They'll probably want to ""rescue and adopt"" a puppy from a pet store. Too bad for the animals stuck inside the shelters.

If this was just a cute little movie about some kids and dogs doing fun and silly tricks and such, I wouldn't care about some inaccuracies. But this entire movie is just irresponsible and straight up misinforms children! The main protagonists are idolized crooks and liars, the pet stores are portrayed as animal lovers, animal rescue people are villainous animal abusers and murderers, and dogs falling in love and producing bunches of new puppies is shown as a good thing. I can think of dozens of ways that this movie could have been tweaked to still maintain the main storyline, but be a little more honest and educational.

Don't waste your time with this movie if you are not prepared to sit down with younger kids to explain the truth behind all the inaccuracies of this film. I'd rather parents get the Disney movie Bolt instead. Bolt is a heartwarming and exciting dog movie that portrays a more realistic view of shelters without turning the hard working people there into monsters.",1322265600,5,4448,4.624050632911392
3797239,5,B001U7IJVO,"This is one of the best feel-good movies I've seen in a long time. I'd originally thought that the
plot would be boring, and cliqued. I couldn't have been more wrong! The acting in this film was superb.
(Especially the performances by Jake T.Austin and Emma Roberts.) I also really enjoyed the occassional
but enjoyable presence of Lisa Kudrow from ""Friends."" Two kids, who are placed in an undesirable foster home are
caring for a dog that belonged to their family before their parents' death. The two tweens eventually
seek shelter for the dogs in an abandoned hotel, and little by little, their family grows. There is a slight
romance between Robert's character, and another teenage boy. It's a little cheesy, but also enjoyable and sweet.
Ofcourse, there is a happy ending, and, as always the kids triumph. This is really great family movie for a quiet

3797245,2,B001U7IJVO,"Most of the details of this movie have been covered in other reviews.  There three issues with this movie.  First of all, the kids exhibit criminal behavior from beginning to end of the film.  Apparently, this is all completely excused by the end of the film, because it was all in a good cause.  I would have felt a lot better about the kids if they had actually gone out and got a job and taken care of their dog in that manner.  Second, the whole plot is really weak.  The kids have no money, but some how have enough money to put together an amazing number of contraptions and get the power turned on in an old hotel.  If they had that money to begin with, why are they pawning rocks for twenty bucks?  Finally, the acting is not very good.  Kids exhibit little emotion and the adult characters are two dimensional, to say the least.

The only saving grace of the movie are the dogs which are well trained and cute.",1294185600,7,919,4.2601156069364166
3797246,3,B001U7IJVO,"Maybe I'm taking this movie too seriously, however, the more I see it, the more I'm just not sure about it.  Bruce and Andi are kids going through a hard time.  They hate their foster family and have taken on a huge group of dogs and are hiding them in what becomes called the ""Hotel for Dogs.""  Sounds fairly benign, I suppose.  However, the lengths these kids go to in this movie to save these dogs seems a bit much.  Breaking and entering and assault are only two of the crimes they commit (and belive me there is more done in this movie in the name of saving their ""family"") and it makes me wonder if we are making too light of what they do.  I would feel horrible if I were these children, losing their dogs like that had to be heartbreaking, however, that their combined efforts brought them to the conclusion that it is acceptable to commit crimes and become felons, well...I had a hard time with that.  As my child was watching I got to wondering what message we were sending to her regarding following the law, accepting things we truly cannot change, etc.  Yes, it's a kids movie, and kids love dogs and kids may not view it as we do, but that's what bothers me the most.  I don't know what she took away from that movie really.  What lesson did she learn? Was it that doing whatever you want to get what you want is ok? Although there were other lessons offered, such as the strength of family, I'm not sure that is what she will take away from it. The other lesson was far to exciting and and much more obvious to a child, I think. As I said in the beginning, I'm just not sure about this one, and maybe you won't be either.

so they go to a lot of trouble to take care of it.

3797259,4,B001U7IJVO,"Hotel for Dogs is not really just a childrens movie- adults can easily fall in love with a film like this as well.  In fact, watching the film tonight my entire family WAS in love with the movie.

There's a couple things about the movie that separate it from being your typical/predictable family film.  Even though the build up in the beginning of the movie might lead someone into thinking they'll know exactly what kind of story to expect (because, let's be honest- most dog movies are pretty muh the same) the fact that the film showcases quite a bit of creativity involving the dogs and their talents and behaviors plays an essential part in making Hotel for Dogs a near classic.

What's amazing about the film is how there must be over 20 different breeds of dogs, each with their own personality being given a fair amount of time.  Surely enough time for you to fall in love with whatever breed tickles your fancy the most.

You can tell these aren't ordinary dogs either- the dogs showcased in Hotel for Dogs display a distinct talent and discipline that certainly shows they were trained quite hard before the film.  Alright, so the film DOES mainly focus on one dog (the small white one) but the other dogs get a pretty impressive amount of attention as well.  As you probably know, most dog films tend to focus on one dog while the rest of the dogs serve as small background material, or filler.  Hotel for Dogs stands apart from your ordinary family dog movie with the many dog varities being featured, and I admire that.

Anyway, enough rambling.  This film is GREAT!  It's about a bunch of dogs that live in a rundown apartment building unbeknownst to everyone living around the area.

It's an extremely good movie.  I'm honestly surprised it turned out to be *this* good because the movie writers obviously devoted more time to this movie than most writers would.  So much attention was given to each individual dog... I'm just amazed by that.

Big dogs, small dogs, heavy dogs, cute dogs and one VERY ugly little dog that's extremely funny, haha.  I love the variety.

The story also focuses on the two kids who discovered the dogs, both foster kids going from home to home and never actually settling in one place.

Hotel for Dogs is mostly a fantastic film because it mainly focuses on the dogs who run around acting crazy, doing funny and silly tricks, and the storyline has a lot of creativity dealing with the kids who fix up the apartment and make it suitable for dogs to feel comfortable living there.  I recommend this movie to absolutely everyone, especially dog lovers.  It's funny, cute and great.",1257552000,,2624,4.636363636363637

3797266,5,B001U7IJVO,"""Hotel for Dogs"" is an absolute winner for kids and adults who love dogs (me).  Two children lose their parents and end up in dubious foster care with irresponsible adults.  They secretly acquire a dog and to avoid a dog-catcher the dog finds safety inside a dilapidated former hotel, teaming up with the two other dog residents.  The kids, and friends they meet, conspire to turn the hotel into a haven for stray dogs and this is where the movie takes an extraordinary and interesting twist.

One of the children is an engineering genius.  He devises all kinds of machines to make the dogs happy and lessen the children's workload.  For example, food is automatically poured into bowls and delivered down a long dining room table to each dog.  A fire hydrant appears when a pad is pushed and afterwards, the hydrant is automatically cleaned.  The dogs experience riding in something that looks like the front seat of a car, with wind blowing at them and films of the outdoors shown on the screen, giving the illusion that they are speeding in the country.  There are way too many clever things that the ""kids"" arrange for the dogs to describe here, Suffice it to say they are ingenious and absorbing in themselves.  The dogs are filled with different personalities, and take star turns.

3797280,5,B001U7IJVO,"Andi (Emma Roberts) and her little brother Bruce (Jake T. Austin) are foster kids. Bounced around from home to home, they have always found a way to feed and shelter their dog, Friday. Their foster parents, two self absorbed rocker wannabes (Lois & Carl Scudder played by Lisa Kudrow & Kevin Dillon), wouldn't dream of letting them keep the dog, so they resort to resourceful ways to feed and shelter Friday.

Sometimes the things they do aren't exactly legal, but Bernie (Don Cheadle), their Social Worker, knows that they are good kids. He's working hard to find them a good home, but it is hard to find homes for older kids, and it is hard to find foster parents who won't break up the siblings. They are more than just another file in his over swollen in-box. You can tell he really cares about them.

Andi and Bruce befriend a pet store worker who gets them to take in a few more strays, and then they discover an abandoned hotel with even more strays. The pet store workers (Johnny Simmons & Kyla Pratt) and a kid named Mark (Troy Gentile) all join in to fix up the abandoned hotel for the dogs. Bruce is a mechanical genius, and he creates all manner of crazy contraptions to amuse, feed, and care for the dogs.

Contraptions hurl tennis balls for dogs that like to fetch. Doors rigged with doorbells and knockers are great for dogs that like to bark whenever visitors approach. Treadmills with bones on ropes hovering just beyond the dog's reach get them to exercise. Mechanical sheep keep the herding dogs busy. The feeding contraptions are quite outlandish: dog bowls on a conveyor belt are filled up and then each bowl parks in front of each dog seated at a large dining table.

This scene, as you can imagine, was quite challenging because the dogs would see the food and just leap onto the table. In the film, it looks like they are all quite civilized; but you know from the bonus material that there were tons of dog trainers all just out of the camera shot shouting commands at their respective canines. Madness, sheer madness. The sound had to all be dubbed in later, and so much kudos go to the Foley artists and sound designers.

All goes well at the Hotel for Dogs until the machines malfunction just before dinner time. Dog anarchy breaks out, and the barks, the howls, and the chaos alert the dog catchers (Ajay Naidu & others) to their location. The jig is up. Will they ever break out of dog jail? Stay tuned.

This movie nabs you from the start with an opening sequence seen from behind the eyes (and nose) of Friday. This masterfully done cinematic sequence simulates Friday's acute dog senses that lead him to his target: a juicy hot dog.

Cosmo and two other dogs (his stunt and photo doubles) portray Friday, and they are all quite accomplished canine thespians. Friday says so much with just his eyes. One look from them is worth a thousand words. His barks, though non verbal, also speak volumes. One of the dogs on Team Friday is most often seen from behind, because he is such an enthusiastic tail wagger. Cosmo was a rescue dog, and not four months before filming was languishing in the pound, his immense talent untapped and unappreciated.

The dogs all have distinct and likeable personalities. Lenny, a Bullmastiff, is a loveable lug who howls if he can't look out the window. Georgia is a Boston Terrier, the sort of dog Betty Boop would own. Cooper, an English Bulldog, has a marvelously ugly face and chews up everything that is not nailed down, so Bruce makes him a vending machine that dispenses old shoes. Shep is a Border Collie with a strong instinct to herd. At one point he circles Andi and Dave, the pet store worker, shepherding them closer together like some kind of crazy canine cupid. Romeo is a Chinese Crested Dog -- kind of a Chihuahua on a very bad hair day -- and he makes a very unlikely Romeo for Juliet, a beautiful white Poodle. Soon though Romeo has won us and his Juliet over with his irresistible personality, his charm and his unorthodox beauty.

Nearly 70 dogs were used for the making of this film, many of which were actually rescued from the pound. Several of them were adopted by crew members after filming wrapped.

With a title like ""Hotel for Dogs,"" the story practically writes itself. Lois Duncan, who wrote the book, was very pleased with the resulting film -- unlike what happened with her ""I Know What You Did Last Summer,"" intended as a young adult mystery but filmed as a slasher flick. Though ""Hotel for Dogs"" was renovated, she felt it remained true to her story's spirit. She likes what they've done with the place.

And what's not to like? You've got cute kids, cute dogs, and an abandoned hotel filled with cute Rube Goldberg gadgets. The stray dogs, the foster kids, and even the abandoned hotel, they are all orphans -- neglected but with so much to offer, if one would only take the time. ""Hotel for Dogs"" also has a lot to offer. Please don't neglect it. Unless you really hate dogs, children, and well made films, you will enjoy it.

3797291,5,B001U7IJVO,"First off let me say all of the dogs that are in this movie are really talented and so are the actors and actresses for working so amazingly well with the animals.

With that being said Hotel for Dogs was a GREAT movie. I felt like I could really connect with the storyline as well as with ALL the cast. I have never read the book but I thought the movie was well scripted. This is definetely a movie that the entire family will enjoy especially if you are a dog lover like I am. There is no obscene gestures or language so that was a great plus. I just LOVE all of the different breeds of dogs they added into the movie.

Short summary: Andi and Bruce are brother and sister being moved around from foster family to foster family. Through all of their moving around they still seem to keep their dog Friday a secret from all of their foster parents. Their new recent foster family doesn't care about anything but themselves (Kevin Dillion & Lisa Kudrow) so they decided to make their own ""family"". With the help of their newly found friends they run a secret hotel from dogs. The only problem is the dog catchers are after their dogs so they have a few run in's with them. See if Andi, Bruce, and their friends can save their dogs from the pound and save their hotel for dogs.

Again this is a GREAT family movie. I loved every minute of it.",1242172800,,1342,4.254901960784314

3797294,2,B001U7IJVO,"(1.) You're warned at the start of the movie that it may not be appropriate because of thematic content. Puzzling at first since how can another feel good movie with trained dogs and a couple of kids trying to rescue them be so terrible. Well, since the kids are stealing, selling ripped off items to people, disobeying parents and police as well as any adult with responsibilities and lying for most of the  movie I can see how most parents aren't going to find this movie the best role model. The kids good intentions and cute Rube Goldberg contraptions are not a justification for their methods. Additionally and unfortunately, foster homes again take another cruel hit in the movies. Having had to monitor the foster care of my students for many years I can say that 90% of those homes are a far more positive influence than the alternatives, and under challenging circumstances that only caring people can pull off.
(2.) Acting was predictable, stereotypic, spiritless and dull. Dogs, however, were well trained and are a testament to positive reinforcement and treats. Props to the editor for melding the dogs scenes into a seamless and coherent story.",1241308800,8,1158,4.878172588832487

It's a good caper movie, featuring a teen girl and her brother's solution to keeping their dog in spite of living in a foster home.

One thing I loved about it was the lack of crude humor (except a few dog bodily function jokes), and also the lack of romance.  There was a little bit of romantic interest, but it was not the focus of the story, and I personally don't think that movies targeted to preschoolers on up need to feature a love story (but most of them, from Cinderella on up do).",1241308800,,654,4.0859375
