3725505,5,B001O0Z82U,"As a straight, married 25 year old female, I suppose this is not the typical movie for me. I stumbled upon the music on Napster and, as an author of fantasy books, was intrigued by the cover (a boy wearing an unusual fairy costume). After listening to the soundtrack, I fell in love with it completely. The music is absolutely fantastic, Tanner Cohen's voice is a dream to listen to, and each song plays an important role in the overall movie. I even sing the songs to my 3 year old daughter (who loves the song ""were the world mine"", minus the ""bad word"" at the beginning, lol). Because it left the theater in my area the day I found out about the movie so I missed it, I actually drove all the way to New York City from Kentucky just to see this movie with a friend. It was well worth the drive. Even though it's a very simple premise, each moment is fitting and enjoyable. The only two negatives to me were that the tagline ""If you could make someone love you, would you?"" seemed like a ""duh, no!"" to me (because then it's not REAL love), but to Timothy it was a yes. I disagreed with that and did not truly enjoy the romance between the two boys until it proved real later on. The other disappointment was by my friend, who at the last scene freaked out on me whispering ""You mean, Timothy doesn't sing again????"" We just wanted to hear his voice more, he's so amazing!

I am definitely going to buy the DVD (despite the raised eyebrows I will most certainly get from people here!) because the movie was clean, fun, happy and very sweet. I'm sad it left the NY theater, because I might have taken the 13 hour trek again just to see it!",1230336000,53,1639,4.253205128205129
3725506,4,B001O0Z82U,"The premise of Were the World Mine is romantic comedy trope: character A yearns for the love and affection of unattainable character B, then though a series of hi-jinks, true love wins in the end. That is about where the comparison ends as everything else is turned on its ear in Tom Gustafson's big screen adaptation of his own short film Fairies.

The film's tagline, `If you could make someone love you, would you?' Is honestly, unexpectedly answered, ""Yeah. Obviously.""

The first twist to the romantic comedy trope is that the lead couple is two young men. In the film our put-upon hero Timothy (Tanner Cohen), is cast as Puck in his senior production of A Midsummer Night's Dream. During rehearsal, he happens on the recipe to recreate the flower, here called a pansy in a nice play on words, which Puck uses on Shakespeare's lovers. Timothy/Puck uses the pansy first on his unrequited crush Jonathon (Nathaniel David Becker), then on his classmates, and then the town, allowing everyone to see the world through his eyes. By the end of the film, as in Shakespeare's play, all is peace.

Of course, Timothy is hardly the usual trodden-down gay lead. This is not some Cinderella story with the homely, or even 'Hollywood Ugly' lead forlornly in love with someone quite beyond him; Timothy is a pretty boy himself. The object of his affection, Jonathon is not the typical, unattainable ideal man either. We are shown in subtle ways that he is just as interested in Timothy, as Timothy is in him. Oh, were things only a bit different, eh? Enter the pansy.

This is not an adaptation of Midsummer Night's Dream, but it does have plot points tacked on from that play. Helen Fielding did the same thing tacking on Jane Austen's plot from Pride and Prejudice to the novel Bridget Jones's Diary. Timothy at various points may is Puck, Oberon, Bottom and Helena. Perhaps that is the perfect descriptive combination for a young gay man, part fairy, imp, fool, and unrequited lover.

The musical fantasy sequences are not really fantasy, they are a part of the plot; magic spells that movie the story along.

The music and lyrics are inspired. Shakespeare interpolated and set to music, may hardly be revolutionary, but it is still quite fun and infectious. I find myself listening to the soundtrack repeatedly. Tanner Cohen is wonderful and has a slight sibilant 'S' that is quite endearing.

Tom Gustafson is definitely a director and writer to watch, he spins a fun, engaging yarn with genuine moments of poignancy. Some of the imagery in the film is iconic and arresting. It is hardy without flaws, but the the music and the performances buoy you along over those flaws. Cohen and Becker are especially good. I would not change a frame.",1229731200,70,2735,4.781779661016949

Most importantly I like that they show that Johnathon might already be attracted to Timothy before he ever gets the flower! An awesome job throughout.

This is, what it is, a gay,romantic,comedy, musical. It deals with some serious matters, but as far as I can tell resolves none of them. watch this for entertainment . Not social revolution.

Arc Angel Gabriel? Where was Oberon? Or Hippolyta?Why did Puck have the central curtain call? The verse speaking was excruciatingly
painful even by American classroom standards. The singing was lovely particularly by Tanner Cohen but the talking overall was not. The adults? -

I've seen two performances of his.  This and ""Getting Go: The Go Doc Project"" and he brings such a natural energy to his acting.  There is a scene in the movie where he just isn't getting the rhythm of Shakespeare and he goes home and gets it.  As an actor, he finds the nuance in his part and gets it.  It's not forced.  Two gorgeous performances, and this one with singing, which he does quite well.  I can't wait to see what he does next.",1517616000,,600,4.094827586206897

3725517,5,B001O0Z82U,"Tanner Cohen was phenomenal alternative take on Shakespeare's midsummer's night dream. When I first saw back when it came out in 2008, I. A hard time finding it that I must have watched it a dozen times and when it was on Netflix. When it was first released, they put it up a bunch of times. Open one throughout 2008 till 212. I have gotten several friends to the movie, especially my rc cars straight from an even they like it. Say I like the losing well. So what it was going to? How I described it to me. I saw it and I didn't see it as a game. I saw it as a. A Shakespearean take on the way society treats people and in a way that is not known as well. As far as used accounting a twist. As far put you in this kids shoes whose pole every day? Who is not brilliant. The misfit treated like one is to be accepted and be like his friends, even his mother treats him like that in the beginning. I completely relate to that now watching that. 5 or 6 years after not seeing the.film, I didn't relate so much the first time I saw it, but now after going through so much of it when I had to come out to everybody. In my 20 's, I guess different than to be at a younger age that you get at me here, oh mother to see like that so this movie is a very relatable. Even if you're not a team. This fact of the lateral plus it has this look and feel with the music and visuals. That kind of remind me of like Adam Lambert leads. To pop and. Now that the whole fairy and her mad beacon thing is back in style but make up and how people are into that it failed, it's also stunning everybody in there can sing, even the lady with the eye patch from 20s. Cleaning a shaliach in twin is not this, I just don't know her name. I love this movie. I think its excellent I would buy it on blue ray or DVD, I must so damn expensive. Also the system first time this has been released theatrically on Amazon. Every time I've seen it on Amazon, it's been through  Dekko, which is one of the Amazon Video channels that is for the LBGT. Community or at least the movies and TV shows are geared towards them. Ford Club. Which is the other channel. It's never been for sale so.$6.99 for an excellent HD copy with 5.1 audio. And it looks to brighter and clearer than what was on that they trained on only before so Amazon has a new kitchen LeMaster organs so if you're a fan of it comon it I bought both the sound track which is killer the music is excellent by the way. I bought both for $15.98:):$6.99 for movie 8.99 soundtrack on Amazon music :)

Anyways, I bet no one cause the things to save up to Paracas is greater loveable people on the movie, I guess don't know everybody by name, but I commandments to everybody present Shakespeare fan anybody that hasn't friend that anybody but straight, you don't know why there's not a rating made because of some independent movie rated by the MPAA because I don't want to compromise their art. So if they have a whole bunch of awards like this one had 75, they let that stand as a certificate of approval. However, outrageous and like I said its about a patient, there's no sex. The language doesn't even say the word that begins with the letter f. There is no sexual content that's the the extremely risqu or anything like that.",1508112000,,3249,4.0989010989010985

3725563,5,B001O0Z82U,"If you've seen this excellent romantic musical, or The Go Doc Project, or the premiere of HBO's gay series Looking, you've seen The talented and handsome Tanner Cohen. In every project, he smoulders like every star should, but this put him on the map. With a spectacular voice, he's perfectly cast as the outcast teen in a typical American town of  conservatives who, through an enchanted flower, converts the town from homophobes to homos themselves!

The film centers around the local high school drama teacher's decision to have the drama kids perform Shakspeares A Midsommers Night Dream, and how Cohen's character becomes infatuated with a jock also in the cast.  As he's able to  seduce the jock and turns all of the people around him gay, he has to decide if he should keep everyone under his chemically-induced spell.

If the genial and good-looking cast were not enough, the story is a pleasant trip into sublime and humorous territory, watching former homophobes like the high school basketball coach and the local prude transform, all while a wonderful musical and score magically elevates the entire production past a show like Glee, which has to stop short of being as progressive as this indie film can be.

3725577,5,B001O0Z82U,CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!The story line is fantastic and original. I love Shakespeare and Puck was always my favorite of his characters. The movie did a nice job incorporating Midsummer characters and plot into this modern twist. The story is centered around a private boys school doing A Midsummer Nights Dream and the character Timothy is recruited to play Puck. Timothy is gay and in love with a straight rugby player who is also in the play as one of the lovers. Timothy finds a recipe for Pucks love potion in his script and uses it to get the guy. He also uses it on everyone else in town to help them see things from his point of view. The best twist (I thought) was that the English teacher running the play is actually Puck herself teaching the whole town a lesson about compassion and getting her favorite student the guy of his dreams. And the music just rocked.,1383955200,3,868,4.535031847133758

Although filmed around 2008 it brings a Shakespeare classic to modern day, spotlighting contemporary social attitudes and current gay and civil rights issues: school bullying, discrimination, single parenthood, mixing gender roles through the arts and pre-DOMA same-sex marriage activism.  All this still feel recent and very current to the day.  Other comments written have already touched on its plot and performances by the extremely talented cast...some with a lengthy resum&eacute;.  With all said and done the film focuses on central characters and lovers Timothy (Tanner Cohen) and Jonathan (Nathaniel David Becker).  These two talented young actors' voices blend with angelic harmony, their screen persona is magical and their performance charisma will make you melt (and worth repeated viewings).  The supporting cast and crew in no less inferior...making this the few surprisingly successful low-budget indie production.  Btw, Zelda Williams (Robin Williams' daughter) plays the best friend.  Definitely a 'Must-Own' DVD.",1378080000,4,1125,5.817073170731708
3725582,5,B001O0Z82U,"This movie, oh my!  It achieved so much, I don't even know where to begin? But it's like it managed to cover a lot of ground--giving us the character Timothy.

Timothy goes to a more affluent 'all boy' prep school where he is decidedly an underdog. I'll say this because it's just he and his mom, who is willing to sacrifice for him to go to this school.

He has these two best friends: Frankie and Max (and I'll try to talk more on those two later.)

Anyway, to me Timothy is just a regular guy who just happens to like other guys. Now how his fellow classmates know this is ANYBODY'S guess? Because Timothy certainly doesn't go around letting this fact known. Even though there IS this one guy whom he has a sort of crush on--Jonathan.

Now of course, it's like they come from two different worlds--I'm gonna say that Timothy is more on the academic side of things and Jonathan is more of a jock.

The thing that brings the two of them together is the senior play--a quasi re-working of Shakespeare's 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'.  It's something that neither one of these guys can get out of--the play being a senior requirement.

Now at first, I thought there was a LOT of stuff going on in Timothy's head--like a lot of fantasy sequences that were going on that really weren't happening. This happened in the beginning, but I was glad when the story sort of shifted and it was more reality based.

Anyway about the play, Timothy is cast as Puck--I'm going to say the 'main' fairy and Jonathan is one of the lovers in the play.

While Timothy is going over reading the play at his house, he starts to really 'read' into the play, figuring out how he can make this potion--a sort of 'love' potion.

I don't think he really knows this going in, only when his friend Max, who really is JUST his friend comes over, he accidentally squirts him with this stuff and instantly it's like Max starts going all 'lovey dovey' over him. It gets to the point where it really goes intense--maybe more for comic relief, though there is a sort of intensity that's there just the same--that I don't think was really necessary. (I guess what I'm trying to say is that Max was ALREADY a friend and an advocate to Timothy so to have him go 'gaga' over him was an overkill.)

Anyway as rehearsals start on the play, it's here that Timothy sees where his potion can be of use to him--and in this, I'd say that the film is able to play out the underlying message of this film's theme: tolerance and finally acceptance.

It's like there was a lesson that needed to be learned and in the end...not to give anything away...I think the message was learned.

I think the musical numbers were spot on. I think the kids sounded like kids--the way they were supposed to be. If they were any 'better', it would take you out of the mood of the movie. I mean, there's a certain level that you expect from a student anyway.

Overall, I'd say that this was quite an enjoyable movie musical. It had its message CERTAINLY and I heard it loud and clear!!!

Watch for yourself and enjoy!!!

[This is just an adjunct to my earlier review--but, it's just that I enjoyed this movie so much that I just HAD to get a 'hard' copy of it. And the good thing about having the actual DVD, is that it comes with a commentary track. Unfortunately, there aren't any extras or a gag reel--but I understand COMPLETELY, this being the way of independent film.

The cast is talented, the plot is impassioned, yet the story isn't as strong as it could have been. A teen coming-of age story, that could have used less twink narcissism and more introspection about what drives love (without magic potions) and family/community acceptance.

3725597,3,B001O0Z82U,"My best friend, who adores all things Shakespeare, thought this movie was fantastic and highly recommended it to me because I love musical theater and ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" is my favorite Shakespeare play. The awful scene work (apparently there are only 50 people in the entire town.) wasn't a big deal and the poor lip-syncing was something anyone who doesn't depend heavily on lip reading to communicate could easily miss but the horrible dialogue and sparse attempts at musical numbers made this movie feel about 90 minutes longer than it actually was.

The biggest turn off for me was the unpleasant discovery that, once again, a director couldn't resist the urge to depict every ""gay"" character (temporary or otherwise) through ridiculous stereotypes. The main character tip-toes on the verge of date rape to get a seemingly straight boy to fall for him and, even after problems arise when he accidentally ""squirts"" a friend who immediately falls in love with him, goes on a ""cupid's love juice"" squirting rampage through town turning everyone who crosses his path into obnoxiously limp-wrist-ed fairy boys, tough fire fighting lesbo chicks, or some other awful version of the labels that chase members of the gay community where ever we turn. You might find this hard to accept but, in spite of what movies like this would like you to think, not every gay man is a great dancer and not every gay person is a hyper-sexual make-out machine who can barely resist the urge to hump in public. Believe it or not, there are also plenty of gay girls in the world who don't resort to obsessive stalker-like behavior to find a mate and most gay men aren't so flamboyantly touchy-feely that you could spot their homosexuality from space. Why is it almost impossible to get through a ""gay"" movie without having to put up with these blatant misrepresentations of the gay community?",1363478400,2,1880,4.893416927899686

As soon as the dancing dodgeball players came in and the random shirtless singing on the desk happened, I realized I was in for a s***show. In the beginning I thought the movie was just plain bad, but as it went on I found that I was weirdly into it. I really wanted to see how much more ridiculous and stupid it was going to get, and I wasn't disappointed. The poor lighting, clunky editing, and poor lip-syncing aside, the story itself was incredibly poorly told. I can tell it wants to be a high school-set gay musical fantasy, but it comes off as not being able to decide which exactly it wants to be. The musical numbers are incredibly awkward, and often come out of nowhere. Plus, while there's nothing wrong with having a fantasy element to a story like this, it seems incredibly random and arbitrary. There are no supernatural elements of the story until almost halfway through the film when he magically sings and makes a flower have magical powers to make everyone gay and quote Shakespeare. Not to mention the fact that when everybody turns gay they become really obnoxious stereotypes of gay people.
This movies seemingly endless number of flaws made it a wonderful experience to watch however. A friend of mine were in the back of the room making fun of it the entire time and pointing out the plot holes, ridiculousness, and generally awfulness. When did we determine that the teacher is a witch or whatever the hell she is? Why is his singing voice magical? Why does everybody suddenly accept the gays in the end? Why is EVERYBODY in this town ultra-conservative? (I understand a town can generally be super conservative, but nobody just starts angrily quoting Bible passages when you say your son is gay.)
Like many indie gay films, the whole thing just feels like an excuse to get a bunch of good looking guys shirtless for a while. It is a perfect movie if you're looking for a good movie to make fun of.",1362009600,2,2002,4.517906336088155

However, I was disappointed once again by how amateurish and badly produced gay movies are. They are cranked out on tiny budgets and it shows! If someone would take all that money spent on dozens of cinematic gay clones and use it to produce ONE original movie I would thank my gay stars. God, with all the talented gays out there is this the best we can do?! This movie has a great premise but that is all it has. Apparently when they decided to make a modern gay musical version of Shakespeare's play they didn't put any thought into plot, music, dancing or acting. Perhaps it is just the low budget but I am so tired of that excuse. It is hard to watch this movie. The lead ""actor"" has one expression: slight constipation discomfort. His character attends a school with apparently only 12 students, one principal, one coach and one flaky drama/English teacher.
The music is horrible and I dare anyone to remember one tune after watching this thing. The dancing is laughable, the plot makes the lead character look like a real jerk, the acting by all is yawn inducing. In the middle of all of this crud they throw in a in-your-face gay message that the writer was too lazy to say in a creative way except by TV news reports and long speeches. Another thing, after the lead ""actor"" uses his magic pansy and it causes horrible results he just keeps using it! He is a yahoo bonehead.
Look, I am for gay marriage & gay rights. After all, I am gay. However, we aren't goin' win many hearts over with junk like this movie that has one clunky hammer of a message watchers are hit over the head with in the middle of all the fluff. P-U!",1281052800,3,1718,4.38871473354232

The premise, that if homophobic people could see the world through gay eyes for a day they would be more accepting, is refreshing, and the use of Shakespeare's ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" to convey this idea was inspired.  Yes, it's a low-budget, independent film, so if you think only polished, Hollywood movies are worth your attention, this is not a movie for you.  But I think the quality that the director and producers were able to create in only a few weeks of filming on a shoe-string budget was wonderful.  If you listen to the director's commentary, they basically rented a house and lived in it while they filmed there.  One of the rooms in which most of the scenes take place was literally 12' x 12'!  Amazing!  A few reviewers have called the film stereotypical because of the way the characters begin to dance about when they are ""turned gay"" by Timothy's love potion, and to them I say, get a sense of humor!  This is a farcical musical comedy for God's sake!  The revelation of the film is Tanner Cohen, who has a magnificent voice, and I sincerely hope I will be able to see him in other musical films or broadway shows in the near future.

3725629,5,B001O0Z82U,"I bought this DVD based on a very good review in the New York Times, (of all places), and it didn't disappoint at all.  Our hero is an openly gay boy in a resolutely hetero and homophobic prep school.  Pushed to play the role of Puck in the school play because of his excellent singing voice, he initially resists playing a fairy although he has serious designs on one of the cast, who happens to be the school rugby star.  But our hero is charmed into it when Shakespeare's language leads him to create a magic potion that allows him to turn straight people gay.  Before long everyone in town seems to be mooning over someone of the same sex.  Complications ensue but a happy ending is revealed, with the foolish mortals being restored to their original situations--including the hunky rugby player who, it turns out, was a closet case with the hots for our hero all along!

Although not a real musical, there are several delightful (if somewhat generic) songs which are woven into the narrative.  The cast is uniformly attractive, capable and appealing, and our two leads are really quite good.  The dialogue is not awkward or stilted, and the situation is remarkably literate, with a few inside jokes if you are familiar with the original.  There are also some delightfully funny bits--although this is more of a ""smile"" rather than ""laugh uproariously"" movie.

Were The World Mine is none of the above, except for the gay movie part. Instead it's one of the few gay movies that is well written. And not only that but is also very beautiful in terms of style and song. And yes, while the word song might also make you second guess if it's a good movie or not, here it's actually a good thing because the actors involved are capable of it and know how to get all the emotions out through it. I could listen to the songs alone all day. The dancing? well the few dance scenes are pretty funny but it doesn't matter that much because it is a good movie.

A fun movie that relies on the spoken word to get it's romance across instead of graphic sex, I found it to be quite sweet and something that I would tell everyone to see should they ask what's worth watching.

This music in this musical film is well written, and well sung and choreographed.
The film is a loose adaptation of Shakespeare's ""A MidSummer Night's Dream"". Simply stated is is the story of Timothy, the sole out gay student at an elite boy's prep-school. His drama class plans a senior play, ""A MidSummer Night's Dream"", and as the story progresses his life begins to parallel the play. The lead is a beautiful young man who can sing. The drama teacher is a fabulous woman who any gay man would love. Timothy's divorced mother is strugling to support herself, Timothy, and pay his private school tuition. Like most mothers, she must deal with Timothy being openly gay and being honest about his sexuality. But, she does not reject her gay son: she just has difficulty dealing with it with the usual fears about the consequences of her son being openly gay and being comfortable with his relationships.
The plot is not convoluted or unrealistic, but there are times that you have to suspend disbelief: people do not break out in song to express themselves, but it is a musical.
I do not want to include a spoiler, but I can say that this is a happy film in which people confront their obstacles without any one dying of AIDS or ending up single and lonely.

It involves the love between two high school students, as the movie progresses, it dealves deeply into the love that develops between two high school students, following some magical moments in the film. The school is putting on a production of Shakespeares, ""A MIDSUMMER NIGHTS DREAM"" - the movie revolves around this play and the magic created is reminiscent of the Shakespeare play.  Timothy, played by Tanner Chohen gives an outstanding performance as our young gay man, who is cast as Puck in the High School production.

3725652,5,B001O0Z82U,"I recommend this DVD for a number of reasons, which I will cover later, but potential buyers should keep a few things in mind before making a decision.
1) The director chose to cast the student roles with young men in their late teens and early twenties, instead of the typical twenty-five to thirty-year-old boyish/fitness model type. This gives the movie an element of authenticity, but at a price. After repeat viewings, I noticed that the director had to give some of the novice actors ""cheats"" for a boy-boy kissing scene. Tedious. Also be aware that, to minimize the ""perv"" factor, the bare flesh exposed in the film is nothing more than what you would see at the beach. The focus is maintained on love, not sex.
2) The creative team cut and pasted text from ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" for song lyrics and bits of dialog. I thought it was clever but some Shakespeare purists would probably grouse.
3) The actors in leading roles give surprisingly solid performances. Wendy Robie is the most familiar face, and her character is every gay kid's idea of a dream teacher. As in most independent gay-themed films, though, some of the actors in minor roles are, um...adequate...-ish. As luck would have it, the least talented performer (with a speaking role) got the clumsiest line in the entire script. Yikes!
4) ""Were the World Mine"" is a fantasy, for better and worse. Working under the restriction of a super-tight budget, the creative team hauled out the fifty-pound bag of fairy dust, and somehow found that magical balance between Timothy's soul-crushing reality and the bliss of ""What if...?"" Fairy dust can only accomplish so much, however. I'm not a ""Logic Queen."" I don't obsessively scrutinize a film for flaws--quite the opposite, in fact. But the movie doesn't make sense at times, in ways both big and small, and really could have benefitted from relying a little less on magic and applying a little more reason. For maximum enjoyment, be prepared to accept plenty of things at face value.
5)The old show-biz adage goes, ""Always leave them wanting more."" I can say with certainty that I wanted more. Another song from Timothy...a longer montage of scenes from the performance of the play (those costumes!)...reactions from Jonathon's family (we never meet them or even hear about them)...ah, well.
Now for the good stuff.
1) Tanner Cohen. This is Tanner Cohen's showcase, as it should be. He's utterly charming, charismatic, easy on the eye and he has, as Jonathon (Jock Boy) says, ""nice pipes."" Indeed. Tanner's Timothy is out, resilient, rebellious, but also still vulnerable enough to make you fall in love with him. And, let me tell you, I fell hard. His performance alone is worth the price of the DVD many times over.
2) Nathanial David Becker is an ideal Jonathon, the star rugby player and object of Timothy's longing. He is a lovely boy with a lovely singing voice to match. I enjoyed watching for the little moments when Jonathon shows signs of a mutual attraction, even before Timothy gives him an eyeful of ""Love-In-Idleness."" (If you pay attention, you can catch him staring at Timothy on the sly during an early read-through of the play.) Nathanial does ""smitten"" beautifully, so beautifully, in fact, that his portion of the title number always makes me cry. Who wouldn't want to be regarded with such raw devotion?
3) The score and songs are outstanding, the true magic within the film. I can't stress this enough. Pure magic.
4) For anyone who wore their outsider status like a badge and triumphed through creative expression, this is a must-have film.
Unfortunately, this is sterling example of a type of project that Hollywood (its talent pool and its money) wouldn't touch with tongs. Only a driven independent filmmaker could make this labor of love happen, and I'm willing to overlook a few flaws in order to enjoy the many pleasures that the film has to offer.

3725661,4,B001O0Z82U,"There are plenty of movies about how performing or studying Shakespeare is a life-changing experience. They range from documentaries (""The Hobart Shakespeareans"" and ""Shakespeare Behind Bars"") to features (""Renaissance Man"" with Danny DeVito and the recent ""A Bunch of Amateurs"" with Burt Reynolds). But few are as endearing as ""Were the World Mine,"" a musical fantasy about an oppressed gay teen in a boys' school who ends up playing Puck in ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" and takes the play seriously enough to duplicate the magic love-potion that causes so much trouble among the various major characters.
  No, there's no actual recipe or formula for the potion in the play. (If there were, I wouldn't be at my PC right now--I'd be buying a chemistry set.) And no, Puck isn't really the name-above-the-title star-character in the play. But these Shakespearean liberties aside, the film offers a sly contemporary parallel to the text as just about everyone in the cast must suddenly deal with overpowering same-sex desires or relationships.
  Obviously, the film is aimed at a gay audience---a potion that turns everyone gay would seem less like a subject for farce than a horrific nightmare to conservative straights. But there is little wrong with this film that a bigger budget wouldn't have fixed, and the use of Shakespeare's lines as lyrics in the musical numbers is especially clever. The direction is resourceful, the cast uniformly charming--and easy on the eyes---and the resolution remarkably humane  regarding the former homophobes.
  It's a love story, a social satire and a very, very different kind of high school musical. And it succeeds at just about everything it attempts.",1251849600,5,1691,5.194852941176471

Obviously this couldn't be a mainstream movie, yet the message is relevant and pretty well acted by most involved. As an amusing and light flick, this movie delivers .. certainly if one is unfamiliar ""GLBT themed"" cinema, this would be an excellent first experience.

Let me tell you, DO NOT judge this movie by the trailer and ESPECIALLY don't pay attention to the mediocre reviews. This movie was campy in the best way possible, uplifting, endearing and simply fun. As well as having an amazing soundtrack. This definitely goes on my top five favorite musicals of all time. There seriously needs to be more gay musicals in the world, Hedwig and the History Boys (which isn't technically gay) just aren't enough. I adore both, and this runs neck and neck with Hedwig. One review called this movie shallow, but I have to disagree. Not all musicals have to be Fiddler on the Roof (another favorite). It has a good message of acceptance, of yourself as well as others.

Many will not like this movie cuz its sort of lighthearted with some stereotypical gags (but the film is not offensive).  But it is a refreshing to just sit down and see a gay movie where one of the gay characters does not die, or try to kill himself, and the boy gets the boy in the end. The characters do have their issues still; its  very interesting to see the main characters mom dealing with homophobia, trying her best to understand and love her son.

Dazzling, romantic, and heartbreaking, it's the tale of Timothy, a gay teen who's miserable in his small-town prep school and in unrequited lust with Jonathon, a handsome, popular rugby player.  When Timothy reluctantly auditions for the role of Puck in ""A Midsummer Night's Dream,"" he surprises everyone, even Jonathon, with his talent.  Later Timothy discovers the recipe for a love potion hidden in the script, and creates it.  Does it work?  Wow, does it ever.  Armed with a prop pansy that sprays the magical elixir, Timothy turns the town upside down as starry-eyed same-sex couples snuggle in public or pursue unwilling partners, and Jonathon is finally in Timothy's arms... but is it real love or midsummer madness?

I loved this movie.  The music is wonderful, and the musical numbers in the movie aren't Hollywood-style elaborate; there's a simplicity and roughness to them that really makes them believable as Timothy's fantasies.  The cast is excellent, and I really liked Wendy Robie as Ms. Tebbit, the wise and witchy teacher who might be more responsible for the romantic havoc than she lets on, and Tanner Cohen is absolutely splendid as Timothy...yes, I love watching cute hotties that can sing!(Note: there is boykissing and cuddling, but nothing explicit.)

3725672,5,B001O0Z82U,"Sexy & effervescent, ""Were The World Mine"" puts a gay twist on the play ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"". Tanner Cohen--quite the find--is the lead character Timothy, a gay teenager in a boy's school who is constantly put upon because of his sexuality. Frustrated by his town's narrow-mindedness--and secretly longing for one of the school jocks named Jonathan--he is intrigued by the school play of AMSND arranged by his eccentric but wisely knowing drama teacher. Timothy tries out & is cast as the fairy Puck; it is from his readings that he discovers the ingredients for a love potion hidden within the very script. Embodied within the beauty of a purple flower, Timothy accidentally applies the new potion to his straight friend Max, and he cannot shake Max out of his smitten illusion for Timothy. Thus begins the fun as Timothy forces the town to, for once, ""see things through his eyes"" as homophobic school jocks fawn over each (and dance ballet during rugby practice), the jerk of a sports coach pines for the principal, and nearly all of the town's people are pursuing same-sex romances.
Through all the pandemonium & criss-cross arrows that Cupid fires, Timothy does get his man...but is their love really true? In order to find out, the drama teacher encourages the townspeople to attend the play as the spell is finally broken. The result is pleasing as lessons are learned about accepting each other & various concepts of love...and to Timothy's surprise, does get his wish for true love.
Experimenting with musical formats is nothing new in movies. Remember ""All That Jazz""? ""Pennies From Heaven""? Like the ""High School Musical"" franchise, the musical moments are there to highlight the feelings of Timothy & his wish fulfillment as imagination & fantasy take over. Occasionally, the pacing feels a bit jerky as the film stops & goes between the storytelling & the musical interludes, but it's still a fun & tantalizing movie to watch, with strong messages about prejudice & the dangerous powers of love.",1245542400,9,2015,4.982195845697329

3725678,5,B001O0Z82U,"""Were the World Mine"" uses the notion of bringing plot points from Shakespeare's ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" to life as a way to show the emotional development of prep school student Timothy (Tanner Cohen).  Although DVD menu opens attractively with a musical phrase from Mendelssohn's incidental music for the play, don't expect a disguised rerun of the play itself.

Timothy is an isolated gay student at Morgan Hill Academy.  His best friends are straight students Max (Ricky Goldman) and Frankie (Zelda Williams).  Timothy would like to be with rugby star Jonathon (Nathaniel David Becker), who has a girlfriend Becky (Colleen Skemp).  When rugby players Cole (Brad Bukauskas) or Cooper (Parker Croft) give Timothy a bit of a bad time, Jonathon protects Timothy.  Although Jonathon seems willing to be friendly with Timothy, Timothy expects the worst and keeps slinking away.

The drama teacher Ms. Tebbit (Wendy Robie) decides to put on ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" and recruits Timothy to audition.  Timothy's singing lands him the role of Puck.

Timothy has a vision that lets him concoct a love potion that is squirted from a lavender pansy.  The recipient of the first, experimental squirt immediately falls in love with Timothy, who keeps his distance.  Timothy bikes to Frankie and asks, if she could make someone love her, would she?  She says of course she would.  This gives Timothy-Puck enough permission to try the potion on Jonathon at a rehearsal, followed by targeted doses to confound others.

As love interests switch around, confusion and upset erupts between those who have received the love potion and those who have not.  Adults are included too.  The situation gets so far out of hand that the mayor declares that anyone can marry anyone else.

Timothy gets long, languorous, romantic trysts with Jonathon.  All seems well, but Timothy knows there is a false element in the forced relationship, and Ms. Tebbit suggests it's time to set things right at the academy's climactic performance of  ""A Midsummer Night's Dream.""

At the end not so much has changed, and yet all is different.  Timothy was the star of the show.  The recent events helped Timothy make some additional friends and has strengthened his relationship with Jonathon.  Timothy is not isolated any more.

The concept is interesting, and it is fun to hear some of the familiar Shakespeare lines come through.  While some may quibble on the production values, I thought there was value in not having opulent sets and costumes.  There is meaning that Timothy's mother Donna (Judy McLane) chopped up her wedding gown to make angel wings for Timothy.  The school production looked good and realistically uncommercial.  The musical interludes were striking and engaging; the biggest production piece was a rock band version of the ""Pyramus and Thisbe"" play-within-a-play.

The acting was very good.  Tanner Cohen does a fine job singing too.  The film is balanced so the adult characters actually get a very large share of the action.  This provides some fine character actors and additional humor.  The offset is that many of the student characters have much less definition.  This is an ensemble film rather than a deep-drilling one.

This romantic comedy has no sex scenes or bad language.  It is an enjoyable fantasy.  There are frequent skin shots from students Jonathon, Cooper, Cole, Max, Ian (Zach Gray), Taylor (Alexander Aguilar), or Bradley (Yoni Solomon) and four dancers in the play.  Extras are a commentary track, the trailer, and four Wolfe Video previews.

The producers were ambitious to combine romance, Shakespeare, comedy, and a gay sensibility with a youthful, less experienced cast.  They succeeded in getting the ensemble and balance right.  Congratulations!",1244678400,5,3767,5.15016501650165
3725679,3,B001O0Z82U,"In Were the World Mine, gay love strikes anyone and everyone throughout the all-boys school when the gay boy Timothy, playing Puck (Tanner Cohen), discovers a love potion just like that of Shakespear's Midsummer Nights Dream. Timothy uses his magical potion flower to capture the heart of the school's star rugby player (Nathaniel David Becker), but also to make everyone in the town see the world through his eyes and fall in love with the first person their eyes bestow.

Overall this is much better then most campy, clichd, gay films of late but still has a few sprinkled throughout, but it's really not that bad. It is being way over hyped I think and particular attention has been made of the music and musical numbers which to be honest are few and far between and really not that strong. I was a bit disappointed by that fact. If you want to see a good musical check out Hedwig and the Angry Inch, RENT, and the like.

3725680,5,B001O0Z82U,"Based (very) loosely on ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"", but actually adapted from writer/director Tom Gustafson's successful 2003 short film ""Fairies"", ""Were the World Mine"" is a full length gay musical, being compared as better than ""Hedwig ..."" and obviously more relatable.  It is essentially a fantasy about Timothy, a gay boy who auditions to play Puck in the play at his all-boy private high school, and - in researching the role - finds how to recreate Cupid's love potion, which allows him to have his crush, the school's rugby team star, fall in love with him instantly.  He spreads the ""love"" around by doling out the potion to others, often with unintended consequences.  His drama teacher, a rather weird egg who operates on a different plane than most of her fellow teachers, catches on to what happened, and tries to help.

Word of caution:  If you catch only a few scenes from the film, don't judge it out of context.  There are exaggerated, stereotypical scenes of the rugby team (after the potion) doing ballet moves on the field, the (previously homophobic) burly coach professing his love to the male headmaster of the school, and seemingly ""instant"" same-sex couples kissing all over the place.  It's supposed to be a FANTASY, people, so saying ""That's not realistic"" is redundant!

The cast is mostly unknowns with minimal credits, with the exception of Tanner Cohen as Timothy, who is noteworthy for a fine acting and singing performance, and Wendy Robie as the drama teacher, who ties the story together.  Filmed in and around Chicago, this is delightful, well-conceived entertainment that we seldom get targeting our community.  Winner of 17 awards at gay and indie film festivals, and well-deserved.

3725681,3,B001O0Z82U,"This is a little movie I wanted to love. But in the end I really only liked. I'm happy for those who have written glowing reviews of it and I think it does deserve praise but just not as much as others have showered on it.

Its conceit is clever. Using Shakespeare's ""A Mid-Summer Night's Dream"" as the point of departure it weaves reality and fantasy together by way of a love potion which enables ""straights"" to be ""gay"" and for a brief while to have to walk in the shoes of the main character who is gay. Clever. And the acting of the entire cast is surprisingly good for such a small budget film. But in the end, at least for me, little things like a script which really was weaker than I had hoped, and editing which was sometimes amateurish, made the film less than I had hoped for it.

Is it worth seeing? Definitely. It has things to say that are worth hearing. Is it worth buying? That depends on each individual and what they are looking for from such a film. It is a gay genre film and that's a genre that is still waiting for a writer to pen a master work that captures the gay experience and relates it to the straight world in a way that is true to both and able to dialogue in truth with both.

This was a nice little attempt. Hopefully anyone considering to buy it, or view it, will consider it in proper perspective and not from a starting point of expecting more than it can deliver regardless of how much good will is involved.",1244592000,5,1446,4.212996389891697

It is what makes this movie that MORE incredible to me.

I've also been put off by comments about the ending being seemingly unfinished or unrealistic.  For anyone who knows anything about Shakespeare, and specifically a Midsummer Night's Dream, they would know that, for the characters, it's all about them opening themselves to new perspectives whether that be through disguises that sometimes mean a change in gender or through a magical potion, eyes are opened, perspectives change, and, in the end, the characters conclude where they're supposed to be and with WHOM they're supposed to be, which may not be where or with persons they started out and which made the ending of this movie, for me, very fulfilling.

Were the World Mine, was as much about the supposedly straight rugby jock (played with surprising dimensionality and singing talent by Nathaniel David Becker) opening his own eyes and engaging with his emerging feelings for the boys' prep school queer outcast, Timothy (played melodiously by Tanner Cohen) thanks partially to a new reality made magically available by the mysterious drama teacher (played by the always engaging Wendy Robie) than it was about Timothy fearlessly challenging the status quo in order for him to realize his own dreams and most importantly, wake up his sleeping town so caught up in their own traditionalist behaviour and religious fervor that they forget about the complexities of not only theatre, but of human emotions, specifically LOVE.

That being said, I feel the magic of this movie was even more engaging thanks to a slow build-up from Timothy's own fantasy life to the relationships and realities surrounding the prep school, town, and the friends and family of Timothy, and with the story coming to fruition when fantasy suddenly merges with reality, and conflicts finally force Timothy to confront the consequences of his trickster like behaviour as the town's own Puck, not to mention the maturity he exhibits when he has to give up his fantasy in order to make a life for himself in the realities of a town that is itself in dire need of its own maturation.

All in all, I found this movie to be within a class of its own as far as moviemaking is concerned, thanks to writer and director Tom Gustafson, writer Cory James Krueckeberg, and I will never forget the music of Jessica Fogle, the cinematography of Kira Kelly, nor all the cast and crew that made this movie so spectacular (in my opinion of course, but I believe will be others' opinions as well).

I was a bit dragged the movie when it was showing in Hartford, and I did not know exactly what to expect.  But I was delighted by the whole thing-- from the actors to the dialogue, music, and set.  It was truly amazing what Gustafson did in such a short while with a relatively limited budget.  The movie easily makes my top movie of the year for this genre.

Although the movie has a centrally gay theme, I believe anyone who has ever felt longing for another person who seemed just out of reach, no matter what gender or orientation, will find resonance with the characters and their angst.

3725688,4,B001O0Z82U,"The new film ""Were the World Mine"" can be categorized a number of different ways. Arthouse movie. Buddy picture. Fantasy. Feel-good picture. Gay flick. High school drama. Morality tale. Musical. Romantic comedy. Satire. Screwball comedy. Teen flick. Theatrical play. But, ultimately, it transcends easy categorization and is best enjoyed on its own terms with an open mind toward the unexpected.

It takes as its inspiration William Shakespeare's ""A Midsummer Night's Dream,"" but it also is highly influenced by growing up gay in small-town America. Our embattled protagonist, high-school student Timothy (Tanner Cohen, playing this eager teenaged soul with remarkable sincerity) is constantly ridiculed, rejected by his classmates, criticized by his mother, and leads an isolated existence merely because he's different from everyone else.

He tries out for version of the Bard's play that his school is planning to stage and is cast in the role of Puck. It's an all-boy cast -- the way it would have been done in the time of Shakespeare, as the curiously open-minded theater teacher, Ms. Tebbit (Wendy Robie) points out. But that bears little improvement in Timothy's status as the school outcast. He is left to daydream comically but sadly about what it could be like to be loved, and by whom. And he's left with his comically insatiable crush on the school jock, Jonathon (Nathaniel David Becker).

In the course of preparing for his role, our perpetually love-forsaken hero reads in the play about a strange potion that cajoles people to fall into the most swooning love imaginable. Timothy thinks: How wonderful it could be if I had such a potion, such a magic scent, to make anyone I desire fall in love with me. So, with an innocent deviousness, he follows the recipe so well detailed in the play and, voila, concocts a potion, which he discreetly keeps in a little, old-fashioned perfume bottle that he carries around wherever he goes, its spray tip topped by a flower with lavender petals.

As a test, Timothy first sprays one of his friends who is visiting him in his bedroom, though share an interest in the other. The test passes, to Timothy's dismay; the friend becomes helplessly infatuated with Timothy and, throughout most of the film, he can't help but touch him. Timothy manages to escape his newfound admirer and, in the midst of the rehearsal sprays the object of his affection, Jonathon, instantly making him see Timothy in a whole new, irresistable light. And it doesn't stop there, a spray-happy Timothy eventually turns much of the town not just gay-friendly but just gay, including Coach Driskill (Christian Stolte), the biggest homophobe in the school. His mother's snobbish friend, who routinely snubbed gays, suddenly is overcome with an urgent need to have his mother in bed. His friend prefers Timothy's company over his own girlfriend's. The coach keeps trying to serenade the confounded (and married) school principal. What has happened to people? Confusion begins. Jealousy develops. Love reigns. Especially gay love.

And, it's an exquisite kind of love, as the fantasy expands from a simple lavender liquid in a bottle to take over the entire filmscape with colorful, glittery costumes and sets, like a genie being let out of a bottle to fulfill a much-longed-for wish. The fantasy sequences, like a super-sweet sugar, gradually dissolve the boundaries that limit them to the movie's occasional, and rather catchy musical numbers (the soundtrack is by Jessica Fogle) and become more continually present. The visuals (shot by Kira Kelly with Cory James Krueckeberg's production design) are a sight to behold: quite theatrical, lavish and a bit gaudy, reminiscent of the French photographers Pierre et Gilles, and used to wonderful effect here (especially for a film with such a limited budget).

The actors may appear a little too old to be playing teenagers, but their childlike exuberance and general goofiness help make up for that in this decidedly unusual and uninhibited movie directed by Tom Gustafson, who co-wrote the screenplay with Krueckeberg.

But, what's really wonderful about this film is that it addresses a real issue with which millions of kids suffer in and out of school: the loneliness of not fitting in with anyone and the longing and trauma that go with it. And it has tremendous fun doing so, addressing the issue in a simple, off-kilter, little story, but not taking itself too seriously. Delightful.",1234742400,24,4461,5.111111111111111

8328714,3,B001O0Z82U,"First off, I am writing this review without reading others first.
I think the timing was somewhat off, but it may have just been the way the scenes were cut on the floor.  The music could have been less emphasized, but I have a feeling that the final cut had significantly less.
This is clearly an excellent storyline with a lot of obviously cut scenes to decrease the length of the film, and it leaves the viewer feeling a little bit left-out at the end.  Again, this is a fairy tale, and for the year it was released (2008), it was probably a little more ahead of it's time when you examine where society was, but that by no means says that bullying does not happen today.
Questions I have after watching this (quasi-spoilers, and no--you are not missing a whole bunch)
1.  How exactly did the English teacher/drama instructor go about aiding in the banishment of the spell, assuming she does such a thing?
2.  Does this hold any similarities to magic/mystical work actually applicable from Shakespeare's AMND?
3.  How obvious do you think this movie would flop had it been released today in 2018; more or less ten years later?
4.  How would you have better addressed the societal impact of homophobia instead of merely banishing it?  Isn't it right that there would have still been unfinished conflict at the end?
5.  Is this applicable to other high school themed musical franchise forms of performance?  This is because there was definitely a ""Hairspray,"" and/or ""Mean Girls"" kind of character run-down.
6.  Why did the blonde boy still ""talk gay"" at the end?  (I know this may offend some, but I assure you it is to make you think about what I believe to be the overarching goal of the writer attempted to do).
7.  Was everyone hypnotized, or was it meant to be ""real magick?""
8.  What was the drama teacher growing in the back of her classroom.  Was it really what I think it looked like?
You may be thinking *why did this reviewer give three stars?*...  Two main reasons:
There are a few stellar vocal performances in the show, but I don't think they were meant to be the ""main attraction.""  And although it seemed as if they were at times, I believe the ""main couple"" had legitimate on-screen chemistry.  It almost seemed to be well rehearsed, natural even.

Things I would have liked to see--and be even more hilarious (with ethical boundaries implied throughout):

-More male faculty characters (perhaps 2/3 of them possibly gay).  Add their characters with the already existent drama instructor, and there may very well be even more comedy in their reactions.  Picture it--the teacher's lounge maybe?
Can you imagine?  ""Oh my god, Ms. Tebbit it is under no other circumstances that I beg you to please de-flower the students.""",1525305600,,2738,4.684100418410042

It is an interesting and unique blend of Shakespeare, music, gay coming of age, and acceptance. The actors were all well cast and delivered wonderful performances. The music was enjoyable and enhanced the story rather than detracting from it. This was a truly beautiful movie.",1524614400,,367,4.75
