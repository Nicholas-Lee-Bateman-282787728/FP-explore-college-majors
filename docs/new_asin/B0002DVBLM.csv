8027018,5,B0002DVBLM,"I loved this DVD and learned a lot.  They made it fun and easy.  I am now going to ask my dad to if he would please buy Volume 2 for me!

Marcy is very nice and I am going to write to her to thank her for the great lessons.  I love playing Ukulele and will be able to play at a BlueGrass Jam with my dad.  We are going to play ""My Darling Clementine"" especially with the funny lyrics!  He is going to play guitar and sing, and I am going to play ukulele and sing.  My brother who is 6 is also going to come here us play.

This is a great DVD and Marcy is a lot of fun.  I also have Marcy's teaching on guitar, but my hands are too small yet, so Happy Traum told my dad that playing the Ukulele would be a good idea for me, and I really love it.

I learned to play chords and some fun songs like On Top of Spagetti, Bingo, Mary Had a Little Lamb, Row Your Boat, and others.  I think Marcy is a fun teacher and I like to learn from her.
