524693,4,6302804752,"A Greek fisherman named Demetrios rescues a shipwrecked princess.  He helps her return home and finds himself a slave in the advanced civilization of Atlantis.  Due to arrogant corruption and moral laxity, the country is an abomination before heaven.  Unexpected religious overtones enter the story.  Impending doom hangs heavy in the air.  The birds and animals flee the approaching destruction.  Eventually, the earth moves, thunder crashes, and the volcano rocks-n-rolls.  Others complain that this is an inferior effort from director George Pal.  Comparisons aside, this is a good fantasy adventure story.  The MGM production values are above average for this type of film.  The animal men are demonic in their transition from human to animal.  Demetrios's ordeal of fire and water is exciting.  Take a basic sci-fi plot of a lost civilization, add ""The Island of Dr. Moreau,"" mix with ""Spartacus,"" splice in some costume spectacle, enhance with crisp color photography and you have this movie.  In fact, the director uses footage from historical film epics in the explosive and fiery climax.  The death ray is lethal, albeit primitive.  There is an unfortunate lack of a Ray Harryhausen type rampaging monster.  The grim visage horned idol just sits there when special effects could have done wonders.  Bottom line, this is a ""G"" rated adventure story fine for family viewing.  Baby boomers may recall seeing this film back in the early '60s at a Saturday matinee double feature teamed with some Italian spear and sandal epic.  Nostalgia rules. ;-)",1017014400,61,1553,5.189516129032258
524694,2,6302804752,"Some of the fantasy and SF films produced by the late George Pal in the 50s and 60s hold up well, but this one sure doesn't.  It probably ranks as his worst film.  The basic story (a young Greek fisherman visits the legendary Atlantis shortly before it sinks) has potential, but the movie itself is dismal.  The ""house of fear"", in which humans are turned into semi-animal slaves, is an obvious rip-off of THE ISLAND OF LOST SOULS, with the gimmick reversed, and the ""monsters"" are merely humans with animal heads.  The climactic sinking consists mostly of stock footage from QUO VADIS.  For the most part, just barely passable Saturday afternoon fun.",984873600,2,651,4.776785714285714
524695,4,6302804752,"This film offers a mixed bag for sci-fi and old film buffs.  George Pal  created lavish sets and excellent special effects, and added carboard  actors and a script that will make you wince at times.  However, there is  enough spectacle to make up for the bad dialog.  The House of Pain, where  slaves become beasts (long before Michael York found the Island of Dr.  Moreau).  Deadly Crystal Weapons.  And of course, the destruction of  Atlantis.  Movie trivia buffs might recognize the final moments of Atlantis  - they were reused in a later Tony Randall film!  (I am Lo-the to say which  one.)  Great fun, if not a great movie.  END",906336000,11,634,4.618181818181818
524696,3,6302804752,"I saw the movie first when I was 11 years old and recently was shown on TCM. George Pal was known for his science fiction concepts and special effects. As far as the nature of effects with miniatures, the two natural elements that are hardest to capture with success are fire and water. Surprisingly, Pal did a decent job with his miniature work at the end when the continent goes belly up as a result of the exploding volcano. Some of the fire/water elements are a giveaway, but other shots of the mountains crumbling are well done for a film engineered almost 60 years ago. Not really a 3 star movie, but surely better than two; let's say two and a half to be fair.

For other science fiction fans, keep an eye on the set pieces in the scene with Demetrius and the High Priest in his science laboratory, played by Maxwell Smart's chief Ed Platt. In the background are a few of the pieces that made up the Krell laboratory in ""Forbidden Planet"". Both films were shot at MGM.

While Paul Frees provides narration for the introduction, I believe he also looped some of the dialogue for the other performers. He applied a range of accents but the Frees voice is pretty clear. I then checked the film's IMBd page and that is confirmed.

This genre of film was a mainstay of the late 50/early 60s fare for the Saturday morning kid crowd as sword and sorcery films were churned out on low budgets and many times, stop-motion effects by Ray Harryhausen. Popcorn was priced at 15 cents and a soda was a dime, keeping in mind that you had a lot of buying power in a lucky kid's pocket with an allowance of a buck every week.",1508112000,,1616,4.38

The movie had enough action and adventure in it that the memory of it stuck with me. Unfortunately, I was never able to see it again (this was before the days of DVDs, DVR and even VHS was still pretty rare) So, when I saw it for sale on Amazon I grabbed it. The movie was not as good as I remembered (I was around 9 or 10 when I first saw it) but it is still fun even if it is super cheesy.",1495411200,2,514,3.6396396396396398

524709,4,6302804752,"I really enjoyed this film as a kid but it seems to have disappeared until recently.  I didn't realize it is a George Pal film.  It's very derivative, with  themes from 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, the Island of Dr. Moreau, gladiators, gods and mythology, and even a nifty death ray.

524713,4,6302804752,"OK, even as a small boy, I knew this wasn't a top-of-the-line fantasy film ... but it thrilled me every time I saw it, with that dazzling fish-shaped submarine sneaking up in the background, the giant crystalline death-ray turning people into smoking skeletons, the gleefully sneering arrogance of John Dall, the sonorous nobility & decency of Edward Platt, the slightly stiff dialogue & acting style that all pageant-like spectacle films had in the late 1950s/early 1960s ... ah, memories!

But watching it again decades later, I'm delighted to find that it still holds up as basic old-fashioned entertainment. There's a certain innocent joy & wonder here that you just won't find in modern films, no matter how many millions of dollars went into their special effects. The journey of Greek fisherman Demetrios to Atlantis & his adventures in that magical but corrupt kingdom still provides a carefree afternoon's entertainment -- and not merely because of nostalgia, either.

Good is Good & Evil is Evil here, and that's just how you want it to be in this sort of story. We've seen so much unearned cynicism & morally grey ""entertainment"" in the past couple of decades that this film actually holds up better now than it did in the past, if you take it on its own modest terms. Not for jaded tastes, to be sure, and you probably wouldn't want a steady diet of it -- but if you're looking for sheer fun & classic escapism every so often, then you've come to the right place -- recommended!",1464566400,,1490,4.771317829457364

A good score by Russell Garcia, enjoyable light hearted enough performances and impressive special effects (well, to an 11 year kid at the time), ok, ok, some cheats with Quo Vadis lifted effects towards the end, but still though, like other special effects movies at the time, remain firmly planted in the mind.

The support cast was chock full of very recognizable character actors, who all did a great job except for maybe John Dall, serious overacting ability. he was one of the reasons for the 4 stars and not 5 and the other was Joyce Taylor as the Princess Reptillia or something. She was just plain atrocious. Snotty and above it all at first and then a whiny kitten. Bad transition. She gets lost at sea all alone (how? not explained) she washes up on the shores of a friendly village and suckers Sappy Demetrios to drive her home.

I do not believe that children/teens/tweens would find this movie of interest, other than to laugh at how old-fashioned it is; however, speaking as someone who viewed this film as a kid, I can honestly say that the SPFX were fantastic for its time, and this movie will always hold a special place in my heart.  It so hooked me into the concept of an Atlantis, that all my life I have continued to want to believe that at one time there truly was such an advanced civilization, albeit a bit less corrupt.  This movie had such a strong hold on me that as an adult I visited Santorini, which some geologists believe at one time was the Lost Continent of Atlantis!

524774,4,6302804752,"Tonight's movie was the 1961 celluloid atrocity ""Atlantis: The Lost Continent"" by director George Pal. Many consider this to be Pal's worst film. Worse than ""Doc Savage""? I don't think so. Forgettable ""stars"" (many dubbed with the voice of Paul Frees from Rankin Bass) go bravely into a plot that is both outrageously bizarre and yet tediously predictable. A sexy (in a Frankie Avalon way) Greek fisher-boy discovers a girl on a shipwrecked raft and brings her home. Turns out she's a princess from Atlantis! He sails her back home where they are greeted by a Captain Nemo submarine that takes them to the lost continent as advertised. This is funny because the Atlanteans only possess this technology in this scene- the rest of the movie they are at a sailboat level. Once in Atlantis, the boy is made a slave! Some of the slaves are undergoing a strangely erotic transformation where they are mutated and brainwashed to becoming wild animals like bulls, bears, pigs and dogs! Eventually the boy leads a slave rebelion against the Atlantean snobs and a volcano goes off and most of the cast die. The high priest is played by Chief from ""Get Smart"" who is secretly Christian. There is a brilliant scene where the princess must put on her face in the fisher-boy's house. There is no make-up so she powders her face with flour and reddens her lips with cherries! There is a giant deadly laser ray. All the sets, costumes and props come from better movies set in various time periods. The Atlanteans worship the same god that Lana Turner did in ""The Prodigal""! With John Dall as a vicious and murderous flamboyant gay guy. I loved it.",1390694400,,1631,4.706293706293707

524776,5,6302804752,"This is a cross between a spectacle movie set in the ancient world and science fiction.  The  wizard of special effects before Ray Harryhausen, George Pal, directed the movie.  A Greek fisherman named Demetrios finds a woman floating at sea who claims to be a princess.  She woos him to take her back to her kingdom, Atlantis, past the Pillars of Hercules, the Strait of Gibraltar.  There, he is immediately enslaved because he is a foreigner, and must win back his freedom through a test of physical prowess.  He gains an ally in the priest of Atlantis, who is secretly monotheistic and tells him that Atlantis used to use its technology for good but now wants to use it to enslave the world.  The story is an obvious reflection on Nazism and Hitler, 15 years after the fact.  The plot is filled with action, romance, and deceptive undercover attempts to help the slaves and destroy Atlantis' technology before it can begin a campaign of conquest.

Probably what makes it my favorite disaster movie and my favorite science fiction movie, and one of my favorite spectacle movies, is the high priest who is monotheistic and guides Demetrios to stop Atlantis' ambition.  The fight scenes, special effects, and destruction of Atlantis at the end are enjoyable.  I love seeing John Dall's multifaceted performance as the villain, Zaren.  This is the kind of movie that may seem boring to people who are used to computer animated special effects, but the story is excellent and the special effects are fun to watch!  Movies back then were never intended to look totally realistic, and I think it's better when they look fantastic instead of 100% realistic.  (Due to the budget, most of the fire at the end was taken from the fire of Rome on Quo Vadis, by the way.)  This is a movie that I enjoy seeing again and again.

The ""special effects"" are lame, the monster make-up is pathetic (even by the standards of the time), and then there's that ""pilfered"" footage from Quo Vadis!  Still, it was loads of fun when I first saw it as a kid (back when a movie ticket cost all of 50!).

  But I've always wondered whether there was a sly bit of social commentary mixed in, one I was too young to appreciate.  During the scene when the ""High Priest"" is starting the process of turning a man into a beast, he hypnotizes the victim, slowly intoning:  ""You are becoming a boar.  Every day in every way, stronger and stronger.  A boar, a Boar, A BOAR!""

  Was this perhaps a dig at the mantra of various ""self-help"" movements, which advised people to tell themselves: ""Every day, in every way, I'm getting better and better""?",1381190400,,863,4.532467532467533

I think they (especially my lateDad) watching it now, could appreciate its arch silliness.

A realy rude princess, washed up near a small fishing village. An unbelievable process by which she is returned to her people, via a fish shaped Submarine...cool for its time.

The grave naughtiness of the Atlantans in locking up those who returned her, thence to their enslavement.
Some really naff SFX...bad even for then. Some Harryhausen dinosaurs would have helped.
And a modestly speccy destruction of the Atlantan continent, surprisingly not much of a tsunami. The continent seems to be not much bigger than Manhattan.
I still like the crystal laser device...the notion of LASER was very new then....(there is a brief, surprisingly accurate dialog about laser in a classic Outer Limits Story)

524809,5,6302804752,"As a matter of practice, I swore never to buy a DVD-R product in place of a ""real"" DVD.  I can burn my own DVDs cheaper if I wanted to go that route, why pay more to have someone else do it for you?  As a result, I have passed on buying many movies that I wanted simply because they were only available as DVD-R.  The quality of these types of products are automatically suspect (I have seen some atrocious efforts that helped form this rigid opinion).  However.  When push comes to shove, and something I really really really wanted was only available in DVD-R....  Of course I caved and bought this movie.  And surprise, the quality is quite high (longevity might be another matter but who knows).  So I haven't got that to complain about.  To put it simply, I love this movie and have since the first time I saw it when I was only ten.  It's probably responsible for my love of disaster movies.  It's been many a decade since I last saw it but it still remained fresh in my mind.  It's great to have the chance to see it again (and many times more, as it is a keeper).

This movie is a Sword & Sandal variation common during that era.  It begins with a mock history lesson voiced by the memorable Paul Frees (whose cartoon vocals are quite distinctive and not a little off-putting because of their overuse/familiarity with cartoons).  There's a snotty princess, a happy-go-lucky fisherman, a doddering old king, a sinister/prissy guy who wants world domination, and his sidekick a pirate-guy-soothsayer.  Slaves are turned into beasts not unlike The Island of Doctor Moreau.  There's a gladiator type fight in a coliseum.  Death and destruction abound.  It's cheesy and fun!

It's a very enjoyable, lavishly costumed peplum flick (a peplum is one of those short skirts you see on the weightlifter-types in Hercules/Machiste/Samson/Gladiator films). The hero is a fisherman who rescues a very high-maintenance ship-wrecked Princess, who says she's from someplace called Atlantis. Smitten but skeptical, he agrees takes her back home, where, surprise, he doesn't get the hero's welcome she's promised him, but jailed by brutal guards in bright yellow tights. There are some over-the-top scenes in the House of Fear, where much-abused slaves are turned into (literal) animals by a portly old queen using a thumb-cranked, hypnotic, twirling jewel. The princess' rather prissy fiancee doesn't love her--just himself--he's really after the throne, and he'll do anything--really, anything--to get it. Edward Platt, who later played The Chief on ""Get Smart"", appears as a sort of proto-Pope, complete with white robes, a cross-decorated hat that's never on quite straight, a just-smacked-up-longside-the-head expression, and the definite sense that something's wrong with the very unloving religion on Atlantis. All this enjoyable silliness climaxes with some very lovely miniatures getting covered in pizza sauce as the volcanic Atlantis explodes and, you guessed it, disappears beneath the waves forever. First time on DVD in the U.S., and lots of fun from famous director George Pal (""Seven Faces of Dr. Lau"", ""Babes in Toyland"", and many more).

Since I have not yet seen a box set release of George Pal films I am starting to think that there must be some kind of a prejudice against him as a producer.  Atlantis the Lost Continent, is a fine fantasy film in its own right, suitable to stand against any such films of this period such as the 7th Voyage of Sinbad or Mysterious Island.  Although these two films are not George Pal films, let us not forget the class films that are, such as War of Worlds (1952), The Time Machine and Destination Moon.  If you want to spend a few hours of old time fantasy fun with decent special effects for both yourself and your children then I suggest that the general public push for the release of this classic in the near future.

 ""Atlantis the Lost Continent"" is STILL more fun than sleds FULL of rosebuds!!!!

Any movie with despotic/hammy actor leaders, people being turned into animals, crystal/laser death ray machines running amok,huge tidal waves, and portentous voice-overs is AOK with me, BIG TIME!!(did I say this isn't a documentary?)

I can't WAIT for this to show up on DVD!! MAJOR FUN!!",1141862400,11,403,5.153846153846154
524823,5,6302804752,"I would love to see this film either on widescreen DVD or at a revival house screening somewhere.  Anybody who knows this movie is probably familiar with its production background: George Pal wanted to make a larger scale movie about Atlantis but MGM didn't give him the budget he needed; leftover footage from ""Quo Vadis"" was used in the final scenes when Atlantis is destroyed; Anthony Hall (actually singer Sal Ponti) and Joyce Taylor apparently weren't strong enough actors to avoid being somewhat upstaged by Edward Platt and John Dall, whose campy arrogance as the corrupt warlord is a pleasure to behold; and finally, scenes of flying soldiers were not included in the final film when they tested poorly in test screenings.  Still, this film holds some real treasures: Paul Frees' somber narration before the titles, the powerful Atlantis theme by Russell Garcia, the amazing fish-shaped submarine, that fantastic crystal death-ray weapon, and most of all, the striking depiction of an ancient, technologically advanced but corrupt civilization that was destroyed by a volcano.  Perhaps the fact that this is still the most well-known Atlantis movie is an indication of its strengths.  One final note:  the giant crystal death-ray device reappears as a prop in the Man from U.N.C.L.E. episode ""The Concrete Overcoat Affair""!  Also, some footage of the destruction of Atlantis at the end of the film reappears 23 years later in the Lou Ferigno film ""The Adventures of Hercules"".

Update: the DVD of this film can be purchased on the WBshop website !! Also check out Joyce Taylor on the Bat Masterson episode ""Cattle and Cane"" on the AOL website.",1130716800,85,1651,5.070110701107011
524824,3,6302804752,"Producer/director George Pal is responsible for two of filmdom's best sci-fi/fantasy films: 1953's ""The War of the Worlds"" and ""The Time Machine"" from 1960.  Because of the excellence of those productions, it is inevitable that anything else done by Pal would suffer in comparison.
""Atlantis, the Lost Continent"" sports some of the producer's trademark state-of-the-art special effects (the Nautilus-like ocean craft and the use of other superbly crafted miniatures).  However, the film's shortcomings lie in the cast.
While stars Anthony Hall and Joyce Taylor are good to look at and compliment each other, they just don't cut it in the acting department.  In the aforementioned classic films, Pal had the fortune of having accomplished actors Gene Barry, Ann Robinson, Les Tremayne (all in ""War...""), as well as Rod Taylor, Yvette Mimieux, and Alan Young in ""Time"".
The supporting actors of ""Atlantis..."" score a little better. Edward Platt, later to be ""The Chief"" on the 60's sitcom ""Get Smart"" and Jon Dall, veteran of Hitchcock's ""The Rope"" and the epic ""Spartacus"", do well in their respective roles of ""Azor"" and ""Zaren"".
The great mystery is why several actors' voices were dubbed by voice great Paul Frees (who provided the pre-credit narration). Frees, who also appeared in Pal's ""War of the Worlds"" as the newscaster reporting the impending A-bomb drop, was a staple for many animated features and had only one rival: Mel Blanc. To hear Frees's voice coming from at least three of ""Atlantis's"" characters is a wee bit disconcerting.",1058227200,14,1544,5.192771084337349
524825,3,6302804752,"Anyone that enjoys the older fantasy films like ""Jason and the Argonauts"" or the old Hercules movies should enjoy this movie. It is a well made adventure with the lost city of Atlantis, a fish shaped submarine, mutated animal men, a giant, a crystal ray gun, and beautiful women. What more could you ask for a great Saturday afternoon matinee. Sure it may not be as entertaining to adults as it once was but the kids will certainly love it. The whole family can watch this one. This is at least a couple notches above the B movies. I am surprised this isn't out on DVD since I am sure it would sell. I can't beleive I am the only one that would buy it.",1055376000,12,652,4.224
524826,4,6302804752,"I remember as a kid seeing ""Atlantis the Lost Continent"" along with ""Giant of Marathon"" with Steve Reeves in May 1961 at the Eastown Theatre in Detroit.
Two handsome leading men (Reeves and Anthony Hall) save their kingdoms from doom and gloom and win the love of a beautiful lady in the process.
""Atlantis"" has been panned by critics over the years yet I loved this film as a 12 year old in 1961.  It was science fiction at it's best with colorful costumes, ogres, wolf men, mad scientists, beautiful maidens and villains.  How about the submarine shaped like a fish!!
Anthony Hall as the greek fisherman could have used a little weight training from Mr biceps - Steve Reeves - as he appears a little too thin for a hero.  The staged scene of Demetrious on a boat with his maiden (Joyce Taylor - by the way what ever happened to her?) passing through the pillars of Hercules is hopelessly silly with fake water sounds and fog along with horned owls hooting!  Best part of the movie is Demetrious's fight with a giant ogre in a pool of fire and water. The ogre appears to be about 350 lbs and Demetrious outmaneuvers him and lights his hair on fire with hilarious laughing from the massive crowd in the ""coliseum""
Some spectacular special effects at the end of the film with Atlantis exploding and disappearing into the sea.
The laser ray gun turning hapless victims into skeletons excited the matinee crowd in 1961.
This is a fun film made at a time when fantasy films were in vogue such as ""Seventh Voyage of Sinbad"", ""The magic Sword"", and ""Jack the Giant Killer""  In fact Kerwin Matthews (Sinbad) would have probably been a better choice for Demetrious.
Enjoy this film with the kids and don't worry about swearing, beheadings, and explicit sex.  Good family fantasy.",1029628800,35,1771,4.624203821656051
524827,4,6302804752,"Oh, let's not really be serious about this film, which surely was intended mostly for kids.  I watched it so many times as a kid on local NY TV and was happy to find it on tape.  The story is really hokey.  The villain is a sort of watered down Caligula type and his opponent in Atlantis is Ed Platt, the Chief in Get Smart, as a pacifist high priest in a really silly costume reminiscent of silly high priest costumes in serials of the 1930's and 40's.  He's about as believable as Zsa Zsa Gabor as a scientist in Queen of Outer Space.  The two principles, the Greek fisherman and the Atlantean princess are gorgeous and, to filch a quote, run the gamut of acting skills from A to B, or maybe A to A.  Approach it with the idea of enjoying its silliness and hooting or booing at the screen and you will have a good time.",1025740800,13,821,4.132075471698113

To me, the movie is what I call the ""Ultimate Saturday Afternoon Matinee"". It's got everything - a brave Greek hero, a beautiful Atlantean princess, the ""House of Fear"", the ""Trial of Fire and Water"" in the colliseum, a gigantic crystal death ray and an apocalyptic finale!!!
