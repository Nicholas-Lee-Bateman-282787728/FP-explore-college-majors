5905490,5,B00EE6C3MO,"Just when you thought it was safe to turn on your tap, or hose your car along came Ghost Shark.  With the title, you know what you're getting, the question isn't will it be realistic and have me fearing using my kitchen or bathroom for the rest of my life, the question is will the movie be entertaining.  Yes it is!  The majority of the action revolves around a group of teens being played as usual by actors at the very least in their early twenties. Sure the only actor/actress you've probably ever seen before is the now grown up girl who played Ruthie, the youngest daughter on 7th Heaven.  But for a bunch of unknowns and a former child actor desperate for a comeback role, they all do their job amicably.  Sure the movie is cheesy but that's what you want with these creature attack films to be like.  This one knows the rules, the majority of the shark's victims are the jerks and selfish people, even a group of gang wannabe child thugs don't escape the CGI jaws of Ghost Shark!  I always love seeing people who deserve it get their comeuppance in a horror film and this does that job nicely.  They also die, in usually quite entertaining ways.

There's a lot of blatant homages to the plot of Jaws in this one that operates in the background of the bikini wearing teen character driven human side of the plot.  You've got a rather out of his depth sheriff, a mayor who doesn't want the public to know about the threat even if they are in danger as he has an election coming up, and a few other subtle similarities. You can imagine the cast had a lot of fun making this one, the ones who didn't get eaten were probably vocally disappointed until they were reminded, you know with a film like this, there will probably a sequel!  I'll definitely watch that!  Ghost Shark is a lot of fun, if you've had a long day and just want to be entertained, this is the movie for you!",1414195200,3,1880,4.3247863247863245
5905491,5,B00EE6C3MO,"If you love sci fi shark movies look no farther! This is a beautiful work of art that will grab a piece of your soul and take a bite out of it! Life is turned upside down when some raging rednecks decide to kill a monster great white, but the story doesn't end there. Even after eating a grenade the shark manages to live just long enough to swim into a mystical cave filled with unknown powers. It is there the shark dies and it is there the magical cave brings it back to life in ghost form. Nobody is safe in the water and yes that includes, but is not limited too, toilets, pools, sprinklers, and slip-n-slides. It is up to a group of teens to save the day! It is absolutely magnificent!! If I had five thumbs I would give it five thumbs up! Little Ruthie Camden has grown up and has come back to show off her immense acting skills in this masterpiece. She captivates her audience with her in depth acting technique! By far my favorite movie ever!!! Seriously if you love shark movies this is a MUST!",1414108800,4,1004,4.234375
5905492,1,B00EE6C3MO,"it came in region 2, so I can not see it and the sender did not put in the envelope his complete address or contact information to return it.",1412553600,,141,3.896551724137931
5905493,5,B00EE6C3MO,"This movie is a classic! I mean, a shark coming back from the grave as a glowing ghost shark all because some redneck kills it in a fit of rage? Coming out of any body of water, including a slip n' slide and a cup of water?! This movie is amazing, realistic, and tells you...you shall never be safe in any body of water, as a glowing shark shall come out of it, no matter how small it is, and eat you! And that is in spite of it being pure energy! And the acting in this is absolutely flawless as any other shark based Syfy Movie!!! I highly recommend this to everyone! You won't regret it! Get yourself a copy!",1406764800,7,611,4.0578512396694215
5905494,5,B00EE6C3MO,"Anyone who rated this movie anything less than FIVE STARS is missing the point.  What did you expect?  Shakespeare!?  It's called ""Ghost Shark!""  It's campy good fun with terribly awesome dialog and special bus effects.

If you're looking for a movie which is, dare I say, BETTER than Sharknado (and you know what I mean), then this is the movie for you!",1396742400,11,354,4.645161290322581
5905495,3,B00EE6C3MO,"I knew this was not going to be a great movie, especially seeing as how it's rated pretty darn low on IMDB, but I figured I'd give it a go, seeing a how the trailer didn't look that bad. After seeing it now, it was a bit better than I thought it would be, I honestly thought I'd be reaching for the remote by half way through, but it surprised me to not be all that bad of a flick. Do what I did, and go in with the lowest expectations, and you might be surprised it's not as bad as what you might think? And I am convinced most people who rated it on IMDB did not actually watch it, and rated it on what they expected it to be like.

The story starts with a red neck, his wife and a judge of some sort of fishing contest where first prize is $30,000. The man then begins to reel in a big fish that he is sure will be the victory catch for the money. However just as he is about to snag it, a great white bites it off the end of his line. Thirty thousand down the tube! So the red neck shoots the shark in anger. The shark then dying makes it's way into a cave where anything that dies in it, comes back as a ghost.

The shark then comes back as a ghost, and terrorizes people. Especially the group of teenagers the film, aka the ""stars"" of the show. However, not only is the shark back as a ghost, but it can manifest itself in any kind of water, from bath tubs, swimming pools, fire hydrants, even the toilet! Now it's up to The Mystery Team minus Scooby to figure out how to get rid of supernatural shark.

It sounds pretty far fetched, because it is. However, it's OK for at least one viewing, grab the popcorn and sit back for a few lame laughs, but better CGI then you would expect this thing to be. There are a few scenes here and their that where not edited quite well, or rushed, but overall, it's not bad for one nights viewing. You may never wanna watch it again, least I wouldn't, I can't say it's a keeper, but for one night it's not that bad.",1389657600,,1956,3.9846938775510203
5905496,5,B00EE6C3MO,I watched this movie on TV and I think it is a great movie if you love watching creature movies I think you would enjoy watching this movie. I wish they would get this movie on DVD region 1 so it would play in my DVD player. Hope you enjoy your movie if you decide to purchase it if your into syfy movies and you don't try to pick the movie apart about every mistake you think they made then you will love the movie.,1389312000,2,416,3.9058823529411764
5905497,3,B00EE6C3MO,"The opening scene shows the creation of Ghost Shark when a Great White is killed by a redneck tournament fishing couple on a chartered boat. Said wounded shark swims to a nearby sea cave that behaves similar to Pet Cemetery. The next day the bikini clad daughters Ava (Mackenzie Rosman) and Cicily (Sloane Coe) discover their dad's deserted blood stained boat. It isn't long before a CG translucent shark can appear at will in anything that contains water from a swimming pool to a slip'n'slide.

One man in town, Finch (Richard Moll), a Pinch Scotch (personal favorite) drinking, creepy light house keeper, seems to know what is going on.

The production started out fairy decent freely mixing bad special effects, campy dialog, and cleavage. It included sage truisms such as ""Horny boys will say anything."" When the film turned ""serious"" the bad campy dialogue gave way to simply bad dialogue which lowered the entertainment value of the film and did little to improve its Oscar potential. The movie was filmed in Louisiana. The name of the fictional town was ""Smallport."" The police car said ""Kenner,"" apparently a magnetic sign was out of the budget with all the special effects.

5905501,5,B00EE6C3MO,"I loved every second of this movie.  I saw it when it premiered on syfy a couple of years ago and waited for it to come out on dvd. When I found out that it was never released here and only on foreign countries, I went out and bought a region free dvd player. Great kills, cool special effects, and a couple of outlandish moments. Don't want to spoil it too much, but the ghost shark comes out wherever there is water. Some places are unbelievable.",1443657600,2,448,4.209302325581396
