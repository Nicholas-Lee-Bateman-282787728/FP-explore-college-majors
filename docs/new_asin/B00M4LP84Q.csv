6557620,4,B00M4LP84Q,"""A Most Wanted Man"" (2014 release; 121 min.) is the big screen adaptation of the John Le Carre novel of the same name. As the movie opens, we see some guy entering the port of Hamburg, Germany in a covert way. We later learn he is Issa, an alleged jihadist who has fled Chechnya, Russia for fear of prosecution. In a parallel story line, we get to know Gunther Bachmann (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman), who heads an anti-terror unit in the German security forces. Gunther and his colleague Erna (played by Nina Hoss) are quickly on the trail of Issa. Meanwhile, through mutual connections, Issa is put in touch with Annabel Richter (played by Rachel McAdams), a lawyer defending the causes of asylum seekers. To tell you more of the story would spoil your viewing experience of this plot-heavy movie, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is the latest movie from Dutch director Anton Corbijn, best known for his extensive visual design and video work for Depeche Mode and other bands. He also brought us ""Control"", the biopic about Joy Division's Ian Curtis. In this film, he stays more in the direction of his most recent film, ""The American"" (starring George Clooney). As you can expect, the visuals in ""A Most Wanted Man"" are given plenty of attention and detail. Hamburg (the city) is as much a character in the movie as are the key performers. Second, the movie itself works quite well. Compared to the previous John Le Carre adaptation for the big screen, 2011's disastrous ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"", this movie is a masterpiece, albeit not without flaws. The movie keeps us guessing for much of the time as to what really is going on (primarily: is Issa ultimately a ""good"" guy or a ""bad"" guy?), and that keeps the tension of the movie up (in a good way). Third, this movie is, sadly, best known for being one of the very last on screen performances of Philip Seymour Hoffman. He does his usual great work, even with the funny faux German accent, but I have to say that he does not look well or at ease. The (literally) non-stop smoking during the entire movie surely does not help. There are quite a few other to take note of: Willem Dafoe as the (sleazy? good?) banker, Robin Wright as the American Embassy envoye, Rachel McAdams as the well-intended asylum lawyer, and last but certainly not least, Nina Hoss as Gunther's colleague. She is in my humble opinion one of Europe's top actresses of this generation, with such recent films as ""Barbara"", ""Yerichow"" and ""Yella"". Hoss brings a much needed spark to ""A Most Wanted Man"". Finally, there is a nice orchestral score for this movie, composed by German musician Herbert Gr&ouml;nemeyer.

The movie came out 3 weeks or so ago here in Cincinnati but for whatever reason I didn't get to see it until now. Imagine my surprise that the matinee screening where I saw this at this weekend was very well attended. Mostly an older audience I might add. I surmise that this being a John Le Carre adaptation plays a huge factor in people coming to check this movie out. Bottom line: ""A Most Wanted Man"" is a satisfactory spy-thriller with several stellar acting performances, in particular Philip Deymour Hoffman and Nina Hoss. ""A Most Wanted Man"" is definitely worth checking out, be it in the theater or on DVD/Bly-ray.",1407628800,4,3332,4.684300341296928
6557621,4,B00M4LP84Q,"A MOST WANTED MAN, (2014), is a current-day all-star thriller, set in dark, dense, gritty Hamburg, an ancient German port.  The approximately two hour film is based on the rather recent book of the same name by illustrious British spymeister John LeCarre, he of the long life and long prolific career.  The screenplay was written by Andrew Bovell; Anton Corbijn directed.  The picture tells the story of a young man, half-Russian, half-Chechen, who had been brutally tortured, and slips into Hamburg as a stowaway on a freighter from Turkey.  Once in Germany, he is taken in by its large Islamic community.

The illegal immigrant's arrival is noticed by German and American security agencies, whose interest in him deepens as he gets himself a blond German lawyer/social worker/do-gooder type, and lays claim to his late Russian father's huge ill-gotten fortune.

As is known by many, the movie stars the Oscar-winning Philip Seymour Hoffman, (CAPOTE), the mega-talented actor, in his last towering performance before his recent widely-mourned death. As Gunther Bachmann, obscure German functionary with tiny staff charged with preventing the next 9/11 attack by Islamic extremists, (which had been planned in Hamburg), Hoffman is in most scenes, and, with cigarette always in hand,  carries the picture seemingly effortlessly.  He receives top backing from the rest of the cast.  Grigorly Dobrygin plays Issa Karpov, the movie's tragic titular character.  Golden Globe winner Robin Wright, (THE PRINCESS BRIDE, FORREST GUMP) plays Martha Sullivan, Gunther's more powerful, better equipped American opposite.  The cute Rachel McAdams, (MEAN GIRLS, MIDNIGHT IN PARIS), plays Annabel Richter, Karpov's lawyer, in, to me, the film's only miscasting: she lacks the gravitas for the part, which, I think, needed a young Tilda Swinton.  Willem Dafoe (THE ENGLISH PATIENT) plays Tommy Brue, head of the bank his father founded, which has never been too particular about its depositors or their deposits.  In this typically for LeCarre, low-volume film, Gunther knows what he needs to do in this situation, knows what he needs to get the job done, and knows what he has available.  He must beg for men and materiel to do it.

The viewer gets to see a lot of Hamburg  in the film, and, believe me, it carries its weight with centuries-old muscle .  Officially the  Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg, it is the second largest city in Germany. home to over 1.8 million people, while the Hamburg metropolitan region has more than 5 million inhabitants. On the river Elbe, out of the Baltic Sea, the port of Hamburg, now an affluent industrial/media powerhouse and transportation hub, is the second largest port in Europe (after  Rotterdam). Its official name reflects its history as a member of the medieval Hanseatic League, as a free imperial city of the Holy Roman Empire, and as a city-state, one of the 16 states of Germany; a sovereign state before Germany's1871 unification.

Hoffman turns in a powerful performance in a powerful movie.  A MOST WANTED MAN is an intelligent, dark contemporary tale of intrigue, love, rivalry, and politics.  It is cerebral, slow, no car crashes, gunplay, computer generations or blood, melancholy, and it can be confusing -- difficult to follow.  But it keeps up the tension right through to its last devastating scenes.  Be aware though, it does display the anti-American, anti-Israeli feelings that LeCarre apparently quietly holds in tune with much of the British upper crust, which have been displayed in much of his work.  But the author is a great story teller who knows his spy business, and his novel has here been brought to vivid, moving life.  I don't think you want to miss it.",1407628800,5,3718,5.104132231404959
6557622,4,B00M4LP84Q,"This is an excellent movie of its genre.

As I watched it, I drew comparisons with Martin Ritt's ""The Spy who came in from the Cold""- another superb adaptation of a Le Carre novel, featuring Richard Burton as a world weary spy.

The cast is uniformly excellent, delivering nuanced portrayals of complex characters. Philip Seymour Hoffman portrays the archetypal Le Carre spy masterfully. His performance stands comparison with that of Richard Burton in ""The Spy who came in from the Cold"".

Mr Corbijn's direction is restrained and effective in presenting a realistic picture of espionage. As a matter of interest, Mr Le Carre is an executive producer.

What is the story about? In post 9/11 Hamburg, a tight knit German counter terrorist organisation recruits spies and conducts covert surveillance in the fight against terrorism. Besides the challenge of performing their role, there's friction and rivalry  between the group and other counter terrorism authorities. It's a typical Le Carre tale- not everything is as it seems.  If you like the Le Carre style, you will enjoy this film; if not, you may find it a chore to watch.

Highly recommended for aficionados of Le Carre.",1406937600,2,1179,5.046391752577319
6557623,5,B00M4LP84Q,"Enter and Exit Philip Seymour Hoffman. Alas, this is the last film of the best actor of the last decade.

PSH is Gnter Bachmann, German anti terror spy with smoking, drinking, and weight problems.
On his job, in Hamburg, where 9-11 had been prepared. He is doing reasonably well. His team has found the whereabouts of a suspicious Chechen illegal. They have also made progress in their quest of discovering how a famous liberal Muslim intellectual, a Hamburg resident, manages to channel funds into terror networks...

Where Gnter Bachmann doesn't do so well is cooperation and coordination with other German law enforcement agencies. Even worse is alignment with CIA policies. Enough said.
Brilliant PSH in a typical low key, dark Le Carr story. The whole cast is outstanding., with some German stars in small roles.
Some reviewers have complained that the actors speak with artificial German accents. It is not really a big issue though.
An appropriate special effect: Robin Wright's CIA agent never learns how to pronounce Gnter Bachmann's name. That fits their level of mutual trust.
On the other hand, Dafoe, who plays a banker, should have tried harder to pronounce the name of Rachel McAdams' character Annabel Richter, a lawyer.
And in case that you wondered about my headline: yes, it is irony. Taken from the film. It is said twice, first by the CIA woman, later by Bachmann, shortly before the big betrayal.",1406851200,11,1418,4.9789029535864975
6557624,2,B00M4LP84Q,"Hollywood has never been more enamored with the tradecraft novels of John le Carr than they are right now, having gained in popularity in this post 9/11 society of ours. But for me, I've always had something of a love/hate relationship with his work. While the murky games of spies and dark government assets is one le Carre knows better than anybody, the realism of his writing doesn't always make for the greatest entertainment. Every now and then you wish a car would blow up or somebody would fire a rocket launcher or something. Much like the most recent le Carre adaptation, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, A Most Wanted Man is another pot boiler with a great cast and a story that emphasizes facts, figures, and mood while leaving character in the background.

Philip Seymour Hoffman brings a palpable weariness to the role of Gunther Bachmann, an espionage operative in Hamburg, a country trying to overcome its reputation as a hot bed of terrorist activity. Gunther is part of an organization so secret, so deep in the weeds nobody knows who they report to. They operate on their own, preventing any security threats in a way they see fit. Like many of le Carre's most popular protagonists, Gunther is a shrewd, calculating man who is smarter and tougher than his physical appearance would suggest. He's a man called on to make the hard decisions because he always does.

When a battered and starving half-Chechnyan, half-Russian man emerges out of nowhere seeking political asylum, it catches the attention of not only Gunther's agency, but the CIA (represented by Robin Wright) and other departments in Germany. Gunther's investigation into whether this man is truly who he says, or perhaps a terrorist in disguise, is undermined at every turn by those who claim to be on his side. The ways of spies are often like the mafia; it's your friend with the biggest smile who sticks in the knife. The situation becomes cloudier when a local banker and civil rights advocate (Rachel McAdams) gets involved, along with a shady money man (Willem Dafoe) who is hired to help the refugee gain access to a sizable inheritance.

The second international thriller by Anton Corbijn (he directed George Clooney in The American); the film gets off to a slow start and never gains any momentum. Not that a le Carre story ever aims for big sizzle, the lack of energy is especially burdensome since there is so little interest in developing any of these characters. By contrast, an excellent le Carre adaptation like The Constant Gardener has a central figure with a personal stake in finding a hidden truth. It's no less analytical than A Most Wanted Man or 'Tinker Tailor', but there's an attempt to tell a story, not just go over procedures. And it's a shame because Hoffman really is great as Gunther, a man carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders. The entire veteran cast, and yes that includes McAdams wielding a convincing German accent, fit into le Carre's world perfectly. Ultimately, A Most Wanted Man is too stiff and calculating to appeal to anybody but the most die-hard fan of the genre.",1406678400,8,3097,4.806754221388368
6557625,5,B00M4LP84Q,An outstanding movie. A shocker of an ending. A must see!,1406505600,,57,4.2727272727272725
6557626,5,B00M4LP84Q,"Under the cover of night, a Chechen man quietly enters Germany via the Hamburg port.  He soon becomes the subject of a manhunt and part of German spies' investigation into a wealthy Muslim's humanitarian activity; they believe, amidst many legitimate charities, he is financing Islamic radicals.  The aforementioned spies' leader is played by the late (and great) Philip Seymour Hoffman in his final lead role.  It is a riveting, though largely quiet performance consisting of cigarettes, sideways glances, and an authentic air of old-pro exhaustion.  This suspenseful spy drama is adapted from a novel by the celebrated John le Carr, the 82-year-old anti-Ian Fleming.  Audience members who know past le Carr adaptations, including The Spy Who Came in from the Cold and The Constant Gardener, will find neither the content nor the tone very surprising:  the film is a restrained portrait of espionage agents as grey-scale civil servants forced to weigh the complicated result of their twisted, often brutal actions and responses against the final result.

Here, the Hoffman character's vision of spying (quietly creating, even seducing, a system of informants and watching the streets closely) is compared and contrasted with the Western world's recent embrace of such brute-force and controversial practices as extraordinary rendition, in which a suspect is abducted and spirited abroad for questioning and torture.  American power is represented here by Robin Wright, extra icy.  In general, the film is defined by its parade of old-fashioned, but robust and welcome spy-game pleasures.  Nothing is a particular revelation, but the moral conundrums ring true, the urban spaces have a menacing atmosphere, and the tightly woven storyline draws viewers in early and holds them firmly until the final crosses and double-crosses.",1406332800,92,1827,5.446808510638298

6557630,1,B00M4LP84Q,"A MOST WANTED MAN

An experienced German espionage agent [Philip Seymour Hoffman] trusts his superiors, internal German police and American espionage agents. He tries to conduct a successful espionage operation but in the end everyone he contacts is arrested.

From the beginning a wary German agent [Hoffman] lets his guard down. He is open, revealing everything. The denouement shows Hoffman telling of his plans, including the transfer of money to characters in an office building and how everyone involved with leave. What is annoying is the absence of spyycraft. Most of the people Hoffman meets leave by the front door, together.

More shocking is Hoffman is on the street and does not notice surveillance, or the people ready to make arrests.

If one is a wary spy, supposedly throughout the story, he must be wary at the end. People assembled in the office ought to leave individually by various exits - racing from the garage on a motorcycle, crawling three blocks through air conditioning vents or jumping off the roof and sailing along in a hang glider - that sort of thing, those sorts of thing. None of these happen. Spy Hoffman is surprised and enfeebled. He reveals he is unfit for the espionage business.

Make no mistake, its very intentional that American stars are playing European characters. The modern day dilemmas are what shape the infrastructure of the fictional story: Chechens are constantly suspected, no one wants anything to do with Russia, Germany has an under appreciated role, no one trusts Muslims, and the United States is the revenge-seeking Old Testament God. Similar to Zero Dark Thirty (2013), it emphasizes the tedious time consuming process to legally and efficiently apprehend a criminal. Opportunities will present themselves, act on them. Fans of the television show House of Cards"" should appreciate the superb casting of Robin Wright as the U.S. ambassador.

Even though I couldn't quite figure out why they used American actors to play German people especially actors that are not exactly HUGE box office draws, I still enjoyed this flick immensely.

It's from a John Le Carre novel and the extras threw me for a loop. The guy is still alive and this is a modern book! I thought it must've been some adaptation of one of his Cold War era German spy novels.

Willem Dafoe is in it. I know! Rachel MacAdams. I know! This is a heavy hitting cast and they all hit it over the wall (super special Anton Corbijn Bunnymen shoutout and East German pun for those of you who enjoy that).

The setting of Hamburg is brilliant as the city itself seems (no, is!) like a character in the movie. The issue of fear of terrorists, immigration and the new Europe is really done well with as much nuance as there is in the real Europe of today.

All in all, I was totally surprised and none more so that the guy who photographed two of the most isonic (and greatest!) album covers from the '80s (Echo & the Bunnymen's Heaven Up Here and Porcupine) is now an accomplished movie director. Just fantastic!",1500422400,,1359,4.380952380952381

CIA woman was a flat character played by an uncharismatic actress. Even Defoe is pathetic with his Hollywood-German accent.

The lead actress is a completely awful actress. Really ruins the movie.

Also, this movie seems to simply back up the blind fear of Muslim people, and for most the movie has no evidence as to why we're suspicious of the main Muslim character. The paradigm here is pretty much the far right's tacit attitude.

Finally, they don't seem to have watched any spy movies or read any spy novels. This is basically a cop movie with surveillance. No real espionage intrigue here. Falls far short of the genre.

Also, the moving / wobbling hand held camera thing ruins the experience of watching this movie, and makes you aware that you're watching a movie throughout. This whole new amateurish camera work is really ruining so many movies and show, that otherwise may be tolerable. Bad concept.

6557692,5,B00M4LP84Q,"This is a fabulous thriller/spy movie featuring some of the biggest movie stars; to name a few: Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Willem Defoe, Robin Wright and Rachel McAdams.  It is a story that will keep you on he edge of the seat from start to finish.  Hoffman is feeding the story with so much emotion, it is impossible to let it go long after the movie is over.

Story is set is Hamburg, Germany.  It shows a struggle between various agencies that are fighting and infiltrating terrorist groups that movie around Europe but also support activities around the world, particularly middle east.  German security forces are in alliance with US anti-terrorism forces, but each agency and every player in this game has something at stake.

Rachel McAdams plays a young and idealistic German lawyer from well to do family trying to help Chechen radical change his ways and start a normal life in Germany.  Defoe plays a banker whose deceased father's business connections still have a stake at the bank he is managing.  He is at the crossroads, both personal and professional although it does not take much effort to convince him to work in favor of the German government.

All actors, particularly Hoffman deliver unforgettable performances.  It is amazing to watch this story unfold.  It is almost as if one is watching one of John LeCarre's novels. Only Hoffman's character Gunther is more haunted than any of the characters I have seen in spy movies so far.",1477094400,,1451,4.834008097165992
6557693,3,B00M4LP84Q,"I'd hoped for a better conclusion and the one given, which fails to end matters in a fully satisfactory manner.

6557694,3,B00M4LP84Q,"If a movie is supposed to be in Europe, anywhere, the actors should have good accents. The actors, for the most part, do not have good authentic sounding accents, and they change from one sentence to the next. It's a somewhat interesting story, though.",1476576000,,252,4.75

6557736,5,B00M4LP84Q,"A big, brooding, character Phillip Seymour Hoffman is in this great film, 'A Most Wanted Man"".  Great actor. His presence in this film is, shall I say, is both physically large, particularly the camera angles, but emotionally he is both the paint and the canvas of this film. He and the movie come off as large. The subjects that the film tackles are large. Nifty camera work too. Subtle yet powerful connections between the characters. Unspoken loudness in this one.. Remember that when you see the kiss.  About the kiss: if you aint watching and listening, it happens so unexpectedly that you could miss it. LOL.  This is a thoughtful film. Im kind of reluctant to call it a ""movie"" because its ""no bang bang shoot em up big explosions and fireballs"".  The main actor, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, I knew I'd seen him in something else. And I know that I enjoyed him in his portrayal of that role, which escaped me. Some actors pull you into the film, into the plot. Here the plot is subtle, simmering very very low, like something on the back burner of your stove,  But in this film, the plot has multiple pots simmering Plots at the same time.  Personally my preference is movies that are serious and stimulating.  So many pots of plot simmering that, actually, you don't know what the truth is in A Most Wanted Man. Lol. Even after you watch the movie, I mean, film, you might feel like i felt.. ___Note: Id say take your time with this one. Be patient with the plot. It's twisty. And intelligent.  _i first saw Phillip Seymour Hoffman in the film 'Capote'. I must say in that film I thought he embodied the character, the character being a Writer. Such a great actor. So sorry he came to a tragic end too soon in real life. His acting lives on in film. Enjoy the film. I mean movie. I mean film. lol. --Bill Curtis_writer",1475280000,,1823,4.486404833836858
6557737,1,B00M4LP84Q,There is no substance in this movie to be thrilled. All we see the lead character''s smoke and drinking habit. There is no grip in the story and ending is confusing.,1475193600,,165,4.354838709677419

I'm not a fan of most spy stuff, and I have never made it through a Le Carre book because reading it is like reading The Economist, but at least when I read that I learn things that might be relevant to my life.  We made it half way through this movie before swtiching to Hawaii 5-0.  If you are a fan of spy movies and this author, I'm sure this tour of seedy places in Hamburg will delight you.

6557758,5,B00M4LP84Q,"Engaging spy flick. Probably more 'realistic' than your typical hero spook movie. Hoffman plays a rather gritty lead with a good supporting cast. Plenty of twists and turns with a well developed plot.
No sex, gore or blood and guts, just a few rough visuals and some very colorful language. Probably not for sensitive ears. The ending is not satisfying, but it does end okay. I haven't researched it, but Hoffman's passing may have affected the end.
I would have rated it 4 1/2 stars due to the ending, but Amazon doesn't let us use half stars. Overall, good watch and recommended.",1474848000,,581,4.705882352941177

6557808,5,B00M4LP84Q,"This is classic John le Carre, though it keeps the suspense up to the very end. The actors are excellent; Philip Seymour Hoffman obviously stands out but is quite well-supported. The music is great too- I'm as fond of superspies like James Bond as anyone, but le Carr's stories are simply a class apart. This film captures the spirit of his telling.",1474156800,,349,4.645161290322581
6557809,2,B00M4LP84Q,"It's difficult to review this movie objectively due to PSH's passing.  In fact, he looks ill throughout the movie, and that probably wasn't acting.  At any rate, I couldn't shake the fact from my mind as I watched it.  There's one particular scene where he rolls out of bed, his hair is pasted back, and he shakily reaches for a tumbler of whiskey that seemed absolutely real.  Of course, it could his fine acting ability.  And it's only in honor of talent that I managed to give this film 2 stars.

The plot?  Le Carre used to be good at going deep while keeping up the pace in his books.  Since I didn't read the book on which the movie is based, I can only extrapolate from the film adaptation that he's lost that ability.  I quit reading a few books back when the plots became implausible.  This movie starts out suspenseful, then reaches a plateau where only the early momentum kept me watching--only to discover much of the early action turned out to inconsequential.  One central character annoyingly undergoes a completely radical reversal without much justification.

But it was the abrupt ending that astonished me.  All that emotional build up, the anticipation, then it ended like that????

Frankly, I'm surprised at all the positive reviews, some calling this the penultimate spy movie.  To me, you could watch the first half hour or so and the last 10 minutes and not miss anything other than the dissolution/dissipation of yet another great Hollywood actor.",1474156800,,1472,4.762845849802371

6557858,1,B00M4LP84Q,"Mr. Hoffman was a great American actor. A most wanted man was NOT a venue through which he could command his artistic sense. It's not that it was too dark, when received on my 5.1 system (Multi-faceted Yamaha receiver, with volume controls available for ALL speakers for adjustment), the sound was ridiculously low in volume. I would have to 'ride the POT' as we used to say, to get a balanced output. If  I left it alone, my wife would look at me in the loud parts and complain that I kept it TOOOOO Loud.
Then there was the whispering in German and English. If I can't follow the story as it is being presented on the screen, I tend to FALL asleep. Consequently, what made the story so good for others was wasted on me.  To make matters worse, I woke up in time to see the denoument of the story; not knowing that I had missed so much that the end looked logical to me. ""What happened?"", I asked. he had the whole thing wrapped up and then it fell apart I said joyless. My wife explained it to me. I lied to her. I said I would watch it again.

It was a fascinating suspenseful plot, all told, and for those who have a mind for world politics, the paradoxes of fighting terrorism, this is a terrific novel, and the movie suited it. It has a very human suspenseful mood to it.
The film richly presented the painful journey of the major characters: Hoffman's intelligence agent character as well as the young, troubled immigrant from the Middle East.
This was a book -- and same for the film -- that would greatly appeal to those who aren't pedestrian about the risks and pitfalls to resisting terrorism and extremism, intelligence services matters, government bureaucratic jealousies and crossed interests, civil security paradoxes, and world politics.
It was a rather engaging film to me, not an action flick by any stretch, but good for suspense and intrigue.

It would have been excellent if portrayed as a documentary but this was not the case. The preview clips showed the several shorts that they do but unfortunately in this case.......that was all of them.

While the movie portrays a very necessary and tedious ongoing process of analyzing data regarding rogue elements........it just falls grossly short on delivering enjoyable action. The characters were excellent in their dark, sinister and shadow world roles but there just wasn't enough action to justify the investment in time.

He continues successful recruitment, under the increasingly skeptical watch of the German BND and the US CIA. Yet how far can a turned agent be trusted? And when is it time to stop?

Tense and unpredictable plotting, great cinematography, and brilliant acting combine in this memorable movie. To see it as a political statement is to misunderstand espionage.

The problem is the ending is completely illogical to how the story developed.  The ending is not worth the story nor worthy of the fine performances of the actors.",1462406400,,604,4.616822429906542

I don't know about anyone else but I want to know what happens to some of the characters. The story was built and everything was in place for a decent climax. At the last moment the scale was tipped and left me asking ""Is that really the end? Seriously?"" There was no conclusion so it felt like the movie didn't have an ending. It just stopped. Due to the ending I'm still deciding if I just wasted my time watching this movie...I hate feeling that way.

Also I don't see why everyone is saying this was one of PSH's best. I think this movie was not at his usual level

It's a shame they can't make a second one to answer these questions due to the fact that PSH is the main character and well...yeah. I mean they could if they made Issa or Annabelle the new main character and come up with an excuse for PSH's absence. (but with these reviews I'm sure they won't make a second one. The overall stars I mean)

I think I've come to the conclusion that I wasted my time watching this after typing everything out. This was a one time watch for me

**********************SPOILER ALERT************************

Also the questions that shouldve been answered are:
Who's the bigger fish?
Why did they betray him?
What happens to Issa?
What about the Abdullah's son? Is this going to ruin their father son relationship? Will his Abdullah see this as a betrayal?
What about everyone who believed in PSH's character?
What about he, himself?
Annabelle tried to fight back for once. How will she fight next to try to save Issa?
Does Issa think Annabelle betrayed him now?
Will Issa be proven innocent? Is he truly innocent or is there something more?
Him giving Annabelle his mother's bracelet to me seemed to be his way of saying not only ""I trust you"" but also ""I love you"". I mean honestly I was waiting for a proposal or something though for a movie it fits. In real life it's too soon",1460246400,,2100,4.416020671834626

The movie flowed better than the book, but at the end I still wondered, what happened and was there a point to the story? Other than spy work is difficult and cut-throat.

6558345,5,B00M4LP84Q,"John Le Carre is, in my opinion, one of the best fiction writers of the 20 century. Other than the excellent PBS series Smiley's People, I have not seen his work brought to the screen so well as with this movie. In the case of the former, the story was allowed to develop over many hours while in the case of 'A Most Wanted Man' there are only 120 or so minutes to get acquainted with all the characters as well as the plot, which is a challenge. If nothing else, Le Care develops characters - taking you into their minds and exposing their thoughts. This is not easy to do in a movie format.  Le Carre's novels always have the themes of seduction, trust, conflicting loyalties, betrayal (often by those who are supposed to be 'on the same side'), and of course questioning of the importance of each battle in the grand scheme of things. I must admit that I have not read the novel that this movie is based on, but the Le Carre themes and characters are unmistakable.

Many have already written on the plot and basic merits of the movie. I will only add the following in the hopes that others will not be mislead by the low rating as I almost was. The low ratings are mostly from those who expected a James Bond or Mission Impossible style thriller. Thank God this is not one of those. Instead, if you are interested, you will find excellent, nuanced, performances by all the main characters (esp PSH, who I normally do not like), an engaging plot and a typically Le Carre ending.

In a crowd of people, he would be the one in the corner with his head down, covering his eyes, petrified. I don't get the expense and time that went into the film. It was to be about catching an dangerous extremist, at least what I read implied. Other characters are stereotypical and boring. Pass on it.

6558700,5,B00M4LP84Q,"LeCarre wrote the book on which this film is based, and this is LeCarre distilled and, in my opinion, improved in many ways.  A beaten-down but not bowed German spy, who is not allowed to operated in Germany, under the German constitution seizes a chance event to manipulate events to make the world safer in his opinion.  He must face not only the difficulties inherent in trying to convert the illegal arrival of a Chechen immigrant in Hamburg into a major intelligence coup against a different target (If you are not familiar with LeCarre, it helps in watching the beginning to remember that there are two threads that will come together if one is patient), but also the open opposition of many in his own government--for mixed reasons.  American intelligence plays a crucial role in deciding the ultimate outcome.

This is not James Bond.  This is not Jack Ryan or Mission Impossible.  It is a world of constant and inevitable betrayal.  It is a wold of indirection, misdirection, and deep moral ambiguity, much deeper than even those films and tv shows that allow for moral ambiguity in their portrayal of the fight against terrorism.  It has little or no action.  It can be painful watching the betrayals--and a bit unbelievable in the speed at which things happen but there is always that problem with spy novels.  The dialogue is crisp but much is left unsaid and even contrary to the spoken words.  Hoffman and all the actors are very convincing to me.

As opposed to the book on which it is based, it seems fairer to me on the third watching and more direct than the book.  This may seem hard to believe for some, but LeCarre is a most frustrating writer at times.  He captured the Cold War era beautifully but his subsequent books have been swimming against the tide and also erratic.

Highly recommended if you are in the mood.  If not, stay away.  It will only frustrate and irritate you immensely.",1448668800,10,1911,4.673652694610778

Rachel McAdams' French accent is a little questionable, yet as one of her fans since The Notebook and mean girls she can do no wrong in my eyes. Please be warned there are violent scenes that may make you cringe but beleivable.

A larger official German agency does not like Hoffman and is opposed to his plans. Hoffman is working with a female lawyer who represents foreigners seeking asylum in Germany. The person seeking asylum controls ten million euros. The Americans say they support Hoffman, but based on past experience, he does not trust them.

6559138,1,B00M4LP84Q,"I believe this movie was Philip Seymour Hoffman's (PSH) last movie before he died. It's VERY gritty, has the look of a documentary. It was filmed in Germany in the winter so looks very grey. He did a good, light German accent but the pace of his speech and the 'forward' sound instead of guttural, as many real German accents are, were still American.

The first problem I have with this movie is it's not compelling. The title makes me think there would be some kind of manhunt, and indeed there is, but it doesn't start until more than 20 minutes into the film. Most modern movies set out the story and introduce the main characters in an exciting way in the first 20 minutes so that you want to see the rest of it. This movie doesn't do that. Then, after a slow beginning, it's not clear why the man was wanted. It goes on and on and on and on with mostly incomprehensible plot lines before I find out that the lawyer (played by Jennifer Garner) is, as PSH's character says, a Leftist social worker. She's protecting some guy who says he's Chechin but has a Russian name, a Russian father, is hiding out with a family whose older woman wears a headscarf so might be Muslim, has a bank account with the bank run by Willem Defoe... The plot is so complex that I lost track and ceased to care.

The worst part might be an Amazon Prime Video problem. The movie simply went to black without any denouement. Was it the end of the movie or was it a video streaming glitch? Who knows? Who cares?",1444694400,,1490,4.317857142857143

6559142,5,B00M4LP84Q,"Hoffman clearly was among the greats... this movie was a little harder to follow than Charlie Wilson's War or Capote... but seriously worth it... will watch it again, so many acting nuances. At the same time, one can see the disturbances that led to Hoffman's demise... too bad!",1444694400,,278,4.8125
6559143,3,B00M4LP84Q,Kinda slow and hard to understand some of the accents. A good story overall if you have the patience to watch it,1444694400,,112,4.136363636363637
6559144,5,B00M4LP84Q,"I didn't know anything about this movie going in and had no expectations.  I was really just curious to see Hoffman in his last role.  From the description I had thought it may be some kind of spy thriller along the lines of 24.  That was not the case at all.  This is a powerful drama that moves slowly but steadily through its story.  The story here isn't about action or espionage and that may disappoint some.  The real point of this movie is a look at people.  People who find themselves in a business that is often dark and harrowing.  Hoffman is fantastic (as always) and the rest of the cast does a great job of keeping up.

Definitely sit down and watch this movie with an open mind.  Be prepared to sit quietly, listen closely, and watch attentively.  Don't get hung up on genre conventions or real world politics.  This is a story about characters in a complex world just trying to do the best they can.",1444608000,,914,4.34319526627219

I am not a fan of the frenetic, mindless, action and explosions that characterizes most ""thrillers"" this days, but the pacing of this film was way too slow, and there was not enough dramatic tension, imo, to justify the slow steady march of the plot.
{possible spoiler}
Perhaps most significantly, the anti-climax of an ending was quite a let-down.  Moreover, I would tend to agree with the dour character in the movie who notes that any plan to stop terrorism that includes offering carte-blanche citizenship in a Western Democracy to a man who has spent millions of dollars funding terror is an unacceptable plan. On the one hand, I found myself cheering for the plan to work at the end because I had come to have sympathetic feelings towards Gunther and I wanted to see Abdullah repent and find redemption. Yet, on the other hand, I couldn't get over the fact that Abdullah, up to the end, showed no signs of repentance and that Gunther's plan involved offering Abdullah a clean slate with few caveats. So, after the surprise twist at the end I felt Gunther's frustration and sense of betrayal, but I also could understand why the others had acted as they had, at least towards Abdullah.",1443052800,4,1249,4.729357798165138

It would be healthy to pursue the American follow-up on the real person's events in this fictionalized chain. Then again, maybe that's even worse. I'm ashamed and defensive, at the same time. If a fictional story based on real events in a real world money smuggling, terrorist gangster situation is presented it leaves a lot to be contested.

Maybe it's just a movie. But it seems fictionally negligent. I'd rather have the story continue to condemn (based on real world events) or to explain where the double crossing led to in a court.",1442707200,,662,4.807017543859649

It is a slow dark movie and I wasn't able to watch the whole thing because of Phillip's non-stop, ever-present, INCESSANT smoking.  I'd read the book so knew the story, anyway.

There is simply not enough intrigue in a story about a man most wanted, certainly, but whose crimes are completely unknown to us (if they exist at all). Quite a lot of time is spent in this admittedly well-shot and consummately acted 'thriller' trying to parse out just exactly what the titular wanted man did to warrant such a manhunt as we're forced to sit through. A cold, detached manhunt, mind you, in which most of the would-be spies time is spent smoking, muttering, and listening in on rather large heaphones. I'm not advocating for a Bourne-esque thrill ride--there is certainly a place for quiet, meditative spy films (Le Carre's own Tinker Tailor Solider Spy managed to enthrall without ladeling on too many shoot outs)--but it would have been nice to have some respite from the cold, some reason to keep watching.

I love the actors that popped up in this movie and all gave riveting performances.  Once you find a steady piece to hang onto, you can really get into this movie as vague as the storyline may be. I found myself really connected to these characters by the end of the movie.  Overall, its a good watch and will leave you sad, empty and depressed by the human race when its all over. Im only giving it 4 stars because a lot of this movie is watching Hoffman walk around drinking, smoking, angry and so mumbly you can barely understand him at times.",1442275200,,691,4.251908396946565

Pity the poor fellow traveller, Carre, who just can't seem to come to grips with ""Great"" Britain's loss of power. Confining himself in ever smaller circles of ham-fisted Columbia killing, we end up with A Most Unwanted Ending. If you find enjoyment in warmed over tropes of, shall I repeat myself, the ills of Roman power escaping safe Grecian hands, this then is the film (whoops, Riefenstahlapalooza) for you. Snore.

John LeCarre's strength is character development and it helps the reader understand the character's motivations.  None of that exists in this movie of paper thin characters and it results in awkward scenes where the characters seemingly don't know to look or what to say.  Whoever said that this was Philip Seymour Hoffman's finest performance . . . well, I'll leave out the insult and say his poor performance is probably not his fault, considering the poorly written script.  In essence, this story, as with most of John LeCarre's books, are better off left alone by movie makers unless they are willing to make it into a mini-series.

There are no car chases, no dramatic mass murders, no amazing special effects, just a believably intricate story of betrayal inspired by the real double-dealings of our own clandestine services. Hoffman's performance is one of flawless understatement, creating a genuine three-dimensional person on screen. It is a thoughtful and thought-provoking thriller about layers of betrayal, recommended only for intelligent viewers willing to grapple with the complexities of covert operations as actually carried out rather than splashy cartoon spy dramas.

6559911,4,B00M4LP84Q,"The movie is based on a novel by the spy-thriller writer John le Carr that is very relevant to our time. Even better than the story is the contribution of Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Gnther Bachmann, pseudo freelance spymaster. Every time I see a Phillip Seymour Hoffman film I realize what a great talent we lost. He was so convincing in his characters and this film is testimony to that fact. A Most Wanted Man has an excellent pace and keeps things interesting with a minimum of crashing and banging about. The chases and fights that we do see are believable and realistic. The film ends the story on an inconclusive note, but I think that's the point. PSH aside, Rachel MacAdams was very good in her role as the vulnerable, out-of-her-league lawyer Annabel Richter, and Willem DaFoe overcame his distracting familiarity with a convincing performance of the ber-rich German banker Tommy Brue. The only reason I didn't give it a fifth star is the feeling of dissatisfaction resulting from the troubled ending - wondering what the heck Gnther Bachmann is going to do now and whether the wrongs can ever be mitigated. They certainly can't be righted.",1440374400,,1149,4.808080808080808

There is never a firm footing; we rarely understand the premise of what is trying to be accomplished by the principals.  Finally given something at the end of the film that we can hope for; we are left back in our quicksand pit.  Rachel McAdams plays a reasonable part in this film, but given that it is supposed to be post 9/11 Hamburg, Germany, the actors speaking poorly German accented English adds little to our ability to have empathy for their characters.

The ONLY reason I went back at all to watch the second night (or went as far as I did the first night) was Phillip Seymour Hoffman. I lament his passing. I LAMENT that this had to be his last film!!! In retrospect one can only wonder if the stark dark moroseness of this film, of the story-line! Which, I sadly don't think is untrue as a story-line about an intelligence operation, the operatives and about the USA attempt at worldwide intelligence hegemony. One can only wonder if this dark, morose, crappy-but-real-perhaps, story/film didn't feed into his own personal demons/needs and might have helped push the edge: of care, concern, etc. If you watch this film YOU will want an escape: trust me! [All this said I am aware of the vast timing difference(s) between making a film, its editing, promotion, release, and the time of his passing, etc. I leave it to some art student to see if there is any time-line-connection in the events of his life in regards the feelings I share here and wonder about.]  ALL THIS SAID: Mr. Hoffman plays the part well, OUTSTANDING!

However, for those will to be patient and pay attention to details, A Most Wanted Man is definitely worth the time.

The movie is taut and suspenseful, and somewhere along the way you sense the outcome might not be a good one. The movie illustrates the tug of war between agencies, countries, and individuals in the modern world of espionage.
I liked this a lot. Classic LeCarre. Complex and believable. The people I watched it with did not like it. Their reason was the negative ending. Well, you don't read or watch LeCarre to have a happy story. I gave it only four stars because I reserve the five for my very favorite top movies. This is a personal rating not an objective one.

Others here  have given excellent summaries of the plot, so I will stick to the masterful acting of everyone in the cast. Hoffman is brilliant, conveying wide ranging emotions, subtle and not-so character quirks; DaFoe is an actor at the top of his game, a perfect foil; Rachel McAdams (now starring in HBO's True Detective) is compelling, as is Robin Wright.

I only made it through the first 45 minutes, though. I think this movie drug, and it didn't help that there was something weird going on with the sound, so I could barely hear what people were saying. Also, Rachel McAdams was (I think) trying to do a German accent, but it would go bad German-bad British-American-back to bad German. It was a very distracting flaw in an already boring movie.

I had been really excited to watch this movie, but I didn't like or understand the characters, and the plot was a dud. I like cerebral films, but there was nothing to figure out here.",1438819200,9,726,4.458646616541353

6560390,5,B00M4LP84Q,"Philip Seymour Hoffman was exceptional as the German Case Officer attempting to penetrate and monitor the Muslim community in Hamburg for possible terrorist cells as part of a special unit in German Intelligence that operated on the edge, and often beyond it, of constitutional legality to build his networks. Rumpled, a chain smoker, overweight, he is  the antithesis of popular notions of intelligence operatives who are frequently portrayed as handsome, supremely confident with extraordinary physical endurance and strength.  Despite his everyman appearance he is a shrewd judge of character, as case officers who run sources must be, and possesses a moral code that is revealed as the movie proceeds and for me was the most interesting facet of his persona.  The film takes a deliberate approach to the subject allowing its principle characters to be revealed as much more than the usual Hollywood caricatures this genre of film habitually trots out giving time for the viewer to better appreciate their motivations and the difficult circumstances they find themselves in. Phillip Seymour Hoffman's hard edged empathy is frequently on display.  Hamburg serves as an excellent setting for the story to evolve as Hoffman and his team attempt to achieve their result while others in the German Government and the CIA are watching and waiting.  Not only an exceptional film but a reminder of what film lovers lost in  Mr. Hoffman's tragic death. Please see it.",1438214400,,1461,5.222222222222222

The movie was tense, gritty, well written and well acted, but I had difficulty focusing on the content of the movie itself because of its star:  Phillip Seymour Hoffman.  In every scene and in every action or bit of business that involved the character played by Mr. Hoffman, I was looking for signs of the addictions that eventually took his life.  I parked my rating squarely in the middle of the road as I do not recall anything of a significant negative nature; conversely and due to my distraction with Hoffman I do not recall anything of a significant positive nature either.

This was very much his picture, even though Willam Dafoe, Rachel Adams and Robin Wright also put in fine performances, you can't help but feel that Hoffman is The Man here.  Fans will not want to miss this one.

There is a scene where he's talking with Robin Wright in a bar, and a guy starts hitting a woman.  Hoffman gets up, blithely walks up and socks the guy in the stomach, without saying a word.

I realize this was not one of his cold war novels, but still, the feel of this is all wrong, and the attempt I think was to use a contemporary subject (terrorism) in a format of a cold war spy plot. Sorry, does not fly. Along with many other bad choices made here, this underlying attempt to translate an entirely different period into modern terms has the usual effect: an off key feel to everything. Also while I admire some of the work of PS Hoffman, this is not one of his better performances. Everyone is miscast and poorly directed. Each character is worse than the last.

Philip Seymour Hoffman (as Gunther Bachmann, head of the anti-terrorism group) was fantastic.  Rachel McAdams (as Annabel Richter a human rights lawyer),  Willem Dafoe (as Tommy Brue, a banker) and Nina Hoss (as Erna Frey, second in command of the anti-terrorism group) were all great in their roles.

I felt that the movie wanted to be profound and relevant, however the story fell a little flat to me.  Maybe this was because the characters in the movie were a lot more interesting to me than the movie plot.  All of the main characters had various issues mainly centering around the theme of loneliness and redemption that I wanted more of their stories than I did of the movie plot.

They could care less about the collateral damage they cause to innocent persons who have risked their lives to help us.  John le Carre understands this ""gulf"" too well and brings it to life in this provocative cerebral thriller.

For some reason, the Germans believe he is innocent without checking the facts and help him get asylum. He is an heir to a fortune left by his father, a horrible Christian Russian who raped an innocent 15 years old Muslim girl and so Issa was born. Issa claims the money but then says he doesn't want it because 'it is dirty money' and wants to give it all to Muslim charities (All Muslims are so good and charitable, yeah right)  Enter another "". Enter another ""noble"" Muslim man Abdulla who organizes charities and says that even though the poor Muslims are suffering in Palestine, Iraq and Afghanistan, they are charitable people and should not engage in terrorism. Correction; Muslim in all other 'free' Muslim countries like Iran, Yemen, Syria etc suffer even more and this is because of their backwards religion whose main teachings are murder, repression, destruction and inferiority of women and they DEFINITELY engage in non-stop violence and terrorism all over the world.

Perhaps the weakest aspect of the film was what plagues all productions of Le Carre's books - the loss of the rich detail that contributes to the pleasure of reading the text. But that's how book adaptations go. Although I had read the book, I nonetheless mostly enjoyed the movie. Perhaps the film needed to be longer - two hours might just have done it. The film seems to skip from highlight to essential point, the advantage being the plot's line never lost tempo. The bad with the good.

Hoffman plays the leader of a German antiterrorism group while Defoe is a banker who has inherited from his father, big problems in the form of international money laundering mainly from the Russian military.

Along comes Ivan ""Issa"" (his Islamic name) Karpov, son of said Russian military man and a Chechan woman raped by the man, trying to immigrate to Germany in Hamburg.  Issa stands to inherit millions of Euros from his father.

6560943,3,B00M4LP84Q,"A most wanted man is extremely watchable because it was not only based on a John Le Carre novel but also it was  the last memorable performances by Philip Seymour Hoffman. As Gunther, the German spy who works relentlessly trying to stop another 9/11.
The impressive cast includes William Defoe as a banker and Rachel Mcadams an activist lawyer who wants to help a Chechen immigrant collect an inheritance. However he is suspected of terrorism and questions arise about his true intentions and his inheritance. The immigrant is used as a bait to bust a network of terrorist financing by intelligence agencies.
This film unravels slowly but Hoffman is  as always amazing, as a weary and cynical spy, trying his best to avoid a terrorist attack but the role is such that he cannot do much to save it from mediocrity.",1436140800,,813,4.75886524822695

6560946,5,B00M4LP84Q,"Excellent spy story. Of course, it's by John LeCarre, so one expects it to be first-rate. Hoffman is in his last role before his untimely death, but it's one of his best portrayals. He is very convincing and plays the part to the hilt. His incessant chain smoking, sips of whiskey and coffee with occasional food tells the story of a man consumed by his role and position as the head of the German spy organization focused to protect Germany from another attack by extremists.
The setting for this film is perfect... seemingly cold, damp and cloudy Germany. Hamburg and Berlin.
(Spoiler, sort of, Alert.)
While the ending is a surprise, afterwards one realizes it is not as much of a surprise as experienced. Everyone is out for their own glory at any cost. Bachmann (Hoffman) was used and abused. No one seemingly cared about his real objective in this matter. His superiors, from the moment they appeared in the story, never wanted to share in the success and never cared about the longer-term strategy which Sullivan (Robin Wright) as the CIA liaison identified early on: to save the world. Personal glory was the focus.",1436140800,,1123,4.764102564102564

6560948,3,B00M4LP84Q,"Hoffman's performance was stellar, as was the rest of the cast, particularly W. DaFoe and Rachel McAdams. It's well worth a watch, even more than once, but not really a ""go-to"" movie. The reasons why are pace and storyline. A few reviewers labeled it as ""fast-paced"" but it's quite the opposite - 2 full hours of interesting yet extremely slowly-evolving drama. As for the storyline, I only mention it because 3/4 of the way through I still had no freaking clue what was going on and had to Wikipedia the plot (somewhat hard to do without getting to far and ruining the rest of the movie). It worked, though, and was able to enjoy the ending much better.

A note on Hoffman: it's a terrible shame this was his last major role. I don't know how actors who are able to morph so deeply into their characters are able to cope in a positive way with ""real life."" I don't know if the SAG offers support for their members in this regard, but to me it seems like a no-brainer that it's either desperately needed or in dire need of improvement.",1436054400,,1035,4.4188481675392675

In its clichd way, the film is a good example of the genre, building up suspense gradually until the dnouement when Gunther (Philip Seymour Hoffman) realizes that all his plans have gone awry.  Granted, the action is not without its stereotypes (western filmmakers can never seem to understand the Islamic form of prayer, especially the five-times-a-day worshiping ritual, while the general view expressed by the Europeans is that most members of the Islamic faith are suspect, even if they lead perfectly normal lives).  On the other hand, the direction is pleasantly low-key, with plenty of atmosphere placed on the dank, muddy-colored streets of Hamburg.

In the end A MOST WANTED MAN shows nobody actually winning the battle - or should it be struggle - to ""make the world a safer place.""  The US Embassy (personified by a sour-faced Robin Wright) are shown to be entirely self-interested, more concerned with maintain the country's status as the world's sole superpower rather than worrying about individual people.  Gunther tries to show his humanity, but in the end even he reduces the people whom he deals with to ciphers.",1435622400,2,1378,4.884120171673819

6560995,4,B00M4LP84Q,"There are all manner of spy flicks out there with wildly different approaches and flavors. For my dollar this rang truer than most I've seen and was made much better that others as well.

Here's the scoop. Set in Hamburg, Germany, a fugitive Muslim enters the country illegally. An intelligence unit has their eye on him thinking he might be a terrorist. It turns out he might lead them to an even bigger fish but the waters start to roil as other intelligence networks want to get involved.

This was based on a John Le Carre' novel and it reads like the real thing. This is not slick Hollywood stuff. Some might take issue with the fact that four of the leading German roles are played by American actors, but, were those roles populated by German actors, most simply would not go to see it. Anyway....first is Phillip Seymour Hoffman. What a character. He drinks too much. Smokes too much and hot-boxes his cigarettes. But he's great at what he does and manages to get what he wants from people. He's able to tell them how screwed they are and they nearly thank him for it. Robin Wright plays a CIA operative. She's cold and calculating in here discussions with Hoffman. Rachel McAdams plays a Lawyer trying to get legal status for the Muslim. Willem Dafoe plays a wealthy banker. This is a good cast once you bypass the so-so accents.

The story is believable in the same way ""The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"" is believable. It's intelligence gathering that turns into manipulation once the information is in hand. There is a casual frankness to the dialogue. Those in the know speak to each anther in very matter of fact terms while the subject matter is of the utmost importance. It threw me a bit at first before I realized that's how these people operate. They all know what is going on so why beat around the bushes?

Acting, directing, editing, music all come together in a satisfying whole. Director Anton Corbijn showed the same subtle deftness in his approach here as he did in ""The American."" This might not be everyone's cup of tea but I found it to be one of the best spy films I've ever seen.",1435190400,,2111,4.503916449086162
6560996,4,B00M4LP84Q,"This film is one of Phillip Seymour Hoffman's last films, and it is not a disappointment. His acting is one of the top performances I have seen. He Gunther Bacchman, a German in the high stakes spy game. He has been relegated to Hamburg after a disaster in Istanbul. Hamburg if you remember was the staging grounds for the Saudis who planned 9/11. Bachmann and his team have the Islamic group to follow. They have a highly placed Muslim leader they think is siphoning off funds from charities for other works.

A Russian/Chechnian man named Issa Karpov, played by Grigoriy Dobrygin, arrives in Hamburg, in a most unorthodox manner. Bacchman wants to follow him, other groups in the spy business want him arrested. A truce of sorts is made. So the follow game begins. A banker, played by Willem Dafoe, becomes involved, as does a human rights activist named Annabel Richter played by Rachel McAdams. The other important player is Robin Wright, with dyed black hair that does her no justice, a CIA operative.

So with all of these players, a cat and mouse game begins. This film is from a book by John Le Carre, so that every secret can collapse the house of cards that Bachmann needs to stay upright. As with all of Le Carre's novels, often much is not as it seems.

We knew that the loss of Phillip Seymour Hoffman, would be great, and this film is a testament to his acting.

6561000,2,B00M4LP84Q,"This movie has superb acting, interesting settings, and intriguing characters, but is DULL.

Partly, it's the plot, which is one-dimensional and telegraphs all punches.  The epigraph--the words you see right at the beginning--tells you everything: in Hamburg, inter-departmental rivalry defeated any chance the 9/11 plotters would be stopped.  Same again, same here.  There is no tension, no suspense, just a lot of yawn-inducing waiting for something to happen.

Partly it's the lack of suspense, which is made worse by the shaky handheld camera work throughout.  Handheld is fine if you have a Jason Bourne movie in which cars are speeding around and crashing all the time, punctuated by brief bouts of hand-to-hand ninja combat.  Not here.  Shaky-Cam while watching people in a gloomy office who are just sitting there watching computers is dull and pointless.

Partly it's the writing, which is cryptic and pretentious, but not illuminating.  This may result from the novel.  I gave up reading Le Carre some time ago because of its endless ponderous existential angst.  (Angst over nothing, I might add.  Le Carre seems to have angst in his pants.)

But mostly it's the direction and editing.  If  this movie were half as long it would be twice as good--but it still not very good.  The directing is atrocious.  The very fine actors are left with nothing much to do, and look rightly embarrassed.

Pity that Philip Seymour Hoffman's last movie is such a stiff.  He looks terrific--bloated, washed-up, chain-smoking, pasty, hopeless; but it doesn't help.

Two last notes.

1. What's with the accents?  Hoffman's pseudo-German accent is out of nowhere.  Many of the actors in the film are German, and of course their English has the usual soft consonants and clipped vowels.  Rachel McAdams does pretty well with this, but Hoffman's accent is simply muddy.

(Don't get me started on Hollywood's chronic use of English-speaking actors speaking English with an ""accent"" to indicate they are speaking German.)

2. And what's with Robin Wright's hair??????  This is a fairly high production movie.  Couldn't they afford a good tinting job, instead of the shoepolish black that Wright has?  Or at least a decent wig?",1435104000,,2213,5.117647058823529

6561024,5,B00M4LP84Q,"A Most Wanted Man (2014) is a film based on a novel by the same name written by John le Carre, who is a British author known for intelligent espionage novels.  The film has a very intricate plot and is the opposite of films categorized as action-spy, such as the famous James Bond franchise.  The only other film that comes to my mind and is similar in nature to A Most Wanted Man is The Lives of Others (2007).  Interestingly, both films happen to be German productions.  In terms of atmosphere and intrigue, the film is just like any other film based on the writings of le Carre.  So if you liked: Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy (2011), or the Spy Who Came in from the Cold (1966) than you should not disappointed with the last of the films featuring Phillip Seymour Hoffman.

The setting of the film takes place after September 11, 2001 in Hamburg, Germany.  A German and American internal security agencies take avid interest in a homeless and very religious Muslim Russian-Chechen refugee, who one day shows up on the streets of Hamburg asking around for an information on a wealthy and influential German banker (played by Willem Dafoe).  The German ""ghost-like"" security cell is led by Gunther Bachmann (played by P.S. Hoffman), and his loyal crew of young employees who are savvy in the art of tech-spying and psychological warfare.  Gunther himself is a master at playing mind-games, and his capability to analyze and control people are highly valued by even the American compatriots...

SPOILER ALERT !!!

My question is...did Gunther know about the ""others"" and willingly compromised his own mission, or was he observed by the ""others"" and he did not know about the planned ""kidnapping"" by the rival agency, or maybe he was sold by his female coworker when he gave her that last look before he went inside the car???

Starring the late great master of acting Philip Seymour Hoffman. I still can't believe he is gone. He was such a talented and amazing actor. He was an extraordinary performer at anything he did. He acted in some of my favorite films from Happiness to Doubt and so many other's. This was his last leading role before his untimely death. It's a true shame. We lost a perfect actor to a brutal murderer that has caused so many greats to fall, drugs.

Directed by a perfect visionary Anton Corbijn. Adapted from the book by a powerful creator of story and intriguing imagination John le Carr. A wonderful book writer that has always kept me on the edge of my seat. This is another adaptation of a solid story turned into a thought provoking film. Anton Corbijn directed one of my favorite 2007 films, Control about the life of music pioneering god Ian Curtis of Joy Division.

It stays that way throughout the film. It goes for a quiet, understated approach, which is fine. The problem is the story's characters never become real for the viewer. They go through the motions of building a suspenseful film, but never make it there.

It begins by saying interdepartmental rivalries and intelligence failures prevented the discovery of the 9/11 attacks. Hamburg is now a city on high alert. It shows a man answering a cell phone. A man swims ashore and hides among parked cars. Elsewhere a man speaks to an assembly. Surveillance has recognized a man. They will search for him. Men leave a mosque. Note the passage of a message via a micro SD chip. Next he visits a source. Gunther talks to an official about his operation. Issa helps a woman and gets a meal. Gunther wants more time to watch the suspect. Issa is a member of Jihadists who want to make contact with a banker. He is given 3 days to continue. Elsewhere there is a meeting at an apartment, a man seeks asylum. The lawyer visits a banker about an account number.

The banker looks up old bank records and calls the lawyer. [Note the subtle language.] Gunther talks to Tommy about a job. Later Tommy meets Issa about a letter. [They are under surveillance.] Tommy talks to Gunther, who talks to an American agent. Have a nice day. A student talks to Gunther about his job. Theres no going back for any of us. The banker talks to Issas lawyer, she warns Issa to remove his beard and move to a new place. Issa spots a tail! Then he and Annabelle duck into a club to escape. Gunther explains what he knows about a shipping company, and why he wants to wait. A stranger talks to Annabelle on the street! They know about her. Can I go now? Gunther explains her status. There is a difference between them and us. Who is the solution? [Note the glass block walls for lighting.]

Gunther talks to Annabelle again. Is Issa innocent? She is released and visits Issa. Some men install equipment in that empty apartment. Look at him. Annabelle is advised not to go home because others are looking for her. Annabelle talks to Issa. [They are being watched.] What does Issa want? Annabelle brings news. The banker is given an assignment. He will donate money to Chechnya via a trusted religious man. Issa is questioned by Dr. Abdullah, who accepts the gift. Gunther explains his actions to a board. And what he has planned. Will this make the world a safer place? Issa is given asylum. Dr. Abdullah changes the name of one recipient. [Note the tone of his voice.] Then something goes very wrong! Gunther drives away. [And so it ends.]

This is based on a book by John Le Carr, who was one of the Executive Producers. This was filmed in Hamburg and shows the building styles, one advantage of this movie (once you sit through this movie). I didn't read the book and don't plan to read it; was the book better than this movie? I hope so, or Le Carr needs to plot better stories. This seems to drag on, you keep hoping it will get better, but it doesnt. There is a deus ex machina ending that negates the previous two hours. Whos in charge here? Are those private banks possible in America? Who regulates them? John Le Carr says this story is about extra-ordinary renditions, which deprive people of their natural rights. This movie runs on too long. I think his earlier novels from the 1960s were better. This provides examples of operations that can affect you.",1424131200,3,3203,4.507745266781411

The director is Dutch and he definitely studied Polanski's work.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman is, as usual, brilliant but you can tell that there are a ton of alcohol and drug references mixed in with a few too many super tall and skinny pretty supermodel types -- I couldn't help but think that I was getting a glimpse at the world of Hoffman towards the end.

6561143,4,B00M4LP84Q,"From the novel by John Le Carre's novel `A Most Wanted Man' - we get one of the last films from Philip Seymour Hoffman. We have a refugee arriving in the German port of Hamburg. He is half Chechyan and half Russian and has suffered some full on torture. He also has a claim to a mountain of money that has been bequeathed to him by his father. A man he had little time or love for - he is also a convert to Islam.

This arouses the interest of both the German and US governments. With funds flowing to terrorist organisations they want to ensure that he is not going to be a conduit for more of the same. Hoffman plays a counter terrorism officer Gnther Bachman and he has a team of agents who excel at playing the players in what turns out to be a classic game of cat and mouse.

This is an extremely well made film with a brilliant supporting cast that includes the incomparable Willem Dafoe, Daniel Brhl and Robin Wright. There is also a part for one of my fave Germans Kostja Ullmann (`Summer Storm'). This is a production where everyone gives of their best in a story that is at first glance simple, but gets wrapped in a web of deceit and shifting alliances - it is a great testament to the rare ability that Hoffman had and a film that is easy to recommend.",1422057600,2,1264,4.197530864197531

But I much prefer the kind of Le Carre-esque story of the kind we get in A Most Wanted Man: low-keyed and character driven, focusing on spycraft mechanics. And AMWM does it as well as anything this side of The Spy Who Came in From the Cold. In this, his penultimate film, Phillip Seymour Hoffman does a brilliant job as the frazzled, low-level bureaucrat/spymaster. He's given stellar support from the rest of the cast, and there's also the sinister, unglamorous Hamburg backdrop.

6561149,3,B00M4LP84Q,"The story of A Most Wanted Man centers on the activities of a German team of espionage specialists pursuing in Hamburg a man named Issa Karpov (Grigoriy Dobrygin), suspected of being a terrorist. Led by a hard-nosed German intelligent agent Gnther Bachmann (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the officially non-existent team tracks the man, who contacts with a lawyer Annabel Richter (Rachel McAdams).

Now Gnther, a disgraced agent, wants a bigger catch, while other people tracking down the man, seem to think differently, like a shrewd CIA officer Martha Sullivan (Robin Wright) and slippery OPC chief Dieter Mohr (Rainer Bock).

Based on a John le Carr book, A Most Wanted Man aims for realism, which is not a bad thing. The film is not about action set-pieces and shootouts, but real people and murky morals. Again, that is not a bad thing, but rock artist photographer turned director Anton Corbijn (""The American"") seems more interested in visuals.

With so much attention paid to each characters traits (but not to storytelling which tends to be slow), the film works better as a character study of Gnther Bachmann than as a thriller. Philip Seymour Hoffman is as great as ever, but it must be said that he doesnt look like a German intelligence agent, especially when he speaks in English. Rachel McAdams fares worse, with Nina Hoss, a real German beside her.",1421712000,,1359,4.951754385964913
6561150,4,B00M4LP84Q,The first place I turn to in the newspaper is the sports page so I would be the last person to quiz on International affairs.  If you asked me to distinguish between the Taliban and Al Qaeda you'd be met with a blank stare.  I ventured into this film on the recommendation of a friend hoping for the best.  Considering I'm not a big fan of espionage thrillers I liked the film a lot.  The plot plays like an intricate chess game.  A Russian-Chechen with Islamic sympathies washes ashore in Hamburg and draws the attention of a lot of interested parties.  Who are the players and who's being played?  The German intelligence officer (Philip Seymour Hoffman)? The civil rights lawyer (Rachel  McAdams)? The banker who's been laundering Russian money (Willem Dafoe)?  The American attach (Robin Wright)?  You'll have fun sorting out this cat-and-mouse game and savor the performances none more than Hoffman in his final starring role.  Slovenly looking and drinking and smoking himself into near oblivion Hoffman's Gunther Bachmann projects the assuredness of a chess master in this game of intrigue.  The denouement here falls into the wow category.  Close attention has to be paid but the film works on its own terms.,1421539200,,1216,4.901960784313726

No real intrigue or tension in the boring movie.  Other than occasional moments from Rachel McAdams and Williem Dafoe most of the acting was wooden, especially Hoffmans.  Not an entertaining movie.

6561164,4,B00M4LP84Q,"If you are looking for an action thriller look elsewhere. It is not fair to criticize a film for not being something that it never tried to be.

This is a psychological chess game with some very good acting, smoking and drinking from Mr. Hoffman, with Willem Dafoe as a nervous banker, and others. I am undecided about the girl who plays the stupid immigrants rights lawyer, it is hardly plausible to be so gullible and yet be smart enough to be an attorney, so that is a problem.

The most interesting take-away raised by the film is how are governments supposed to protect us when they put most of their efforts into turf wars and bureaucratic wrangling? The Americans come out very badly in this story, wanting to wield a hammer when a needle is what is necessary, and Hoffman's German bosses are much too eager to accommodate them. I can't say more for fear of giving up the plot twists.

A quite interesting film. If you enjoy it, try also ""The Lives Of Others"" another moral twister set in East Germany.",1420761600,,1009,4.502732240437158

Hoffman, in his swan song, joined Richard Burton, Alec Guinness, Gary Oldman in the exclusive club of actors that masterfully brought JLC heroes to life.

The movie didn't have time for the book subplots. The banker and the lawyer are mere supporting roles. By the way, Willem Dafoe and Rachel McAdams did great with the very little lines they had at their disposal. As a consequence, the story was more concentrated on Hoffmans character.

What is at the core of this movie is how the West sees the Muslims as never worthy to be treated humanely and for just about any reason, everyone is easily stripped of their rights and treated as a terrorist.

I am still in shock by the ending of this story... It is so full of emotions I did not want it to end there... I somehow was hoping that a hero would emerge and make it right... but come on... That would not make it real now, would it?

If you enjoy films that require you to think, that assume you understand from a few clues and visuals what is going on, this is the movie for you. An outstanding cast creates a compelling and suspenseful film with almost no violence. Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays the head of a small, secret German anti-terror unit. The unit detects a Chechen refugee illegally entering Hamburg and begins to track his movements, to determine if he is truly a refugee or a terrorist with a mission. At the same time, the unit is actively investigating a popular moderate Islamic cleric, convinced but unable to prove he is siphoning money from his various charities to fund terrorist activities. Hoffman's goal with both men is not arrests, but using them to find the bigger fish. However, he must combat other German police services and the CIA, whose only goal is to make a splashy arrest. All the actors manage to create very complex characters, especially Willem Dafoe as a private banker, and Robin Wright as the CIA liason. Hoffman is nothing short of superb, and this is one of the best adaptations yet of a Le Carre novel.",1419206400,,1291,4.6173913043478265

6561275,3,B00M4LP84Q,"Note: Even though I will attempt to write around spoilers, one may leak into this review.

""A Most Wanted Man"" is not the film I expected to see. Promotions touted it as a ""tense spy thriller with an unexpected ending."" It's that ending that is so bothersome. I fully expected Hoffman to work in counter-intelligence and be that pusher in the center of the ""unexpected."" Let's just say that the term counter-intelligence goes too far. Hoffman, indeed, goes too far, but (spoiler) not in the way one would think.

Hoffman plays the head of a little spy agency based in Hamburg. While his acting may be intense here and there--but not that much. His acting was neither impressive prize worthy. In fact, his acting was ho-hum, how much am I getting paid for this role? type. Oh yes, there were two really big moments: both times when he lit a cigarette downwind. He had to bend over and stretch his body to prevent the wind from blowing out his light. Not a nail-biting moment.

If I seem to be poking fun at Mr. Hoffman's acting, you must know that I respect his real acting, but this movie doesn't exemplify it. As for other actors, they lend credence to ""A Most Wanted Man"" as a serious thriller/spy film. Rachel McAdams deserves most praise as the illegal immigrant's attorney, while Willem Dafoe turns in a respectful performance as the banker in charge of the suspected terrorist's huge money supply. Terrorist, immigrant--that's the initial question for the little spy agency and the government of Germany at the beginning. Once the immigrant's identity has been established, focus turns on the Muslim cleric to whom he seeks to give money. The actor playing the Chechen immigrant shows little sign of his acting chops.

The more powerful agencies give free rein to Hoffman's agency in locating the immigrant and following his movements. They also latch on to the attorney. By the end all hands are on deck, so to speak, and all truths are out. And it's not what the viewer has come to expect.

The movie is watchable, but expect no awards, even if this was Hoffman's last full acting gig. There is no sense of urgency or thrill or even danger. The action just plods along, teasing that imminent danger is ahead, but when it comes, what? That was it?",1419206400,,2254,4.681818181818182

6561315,4,B00M4LP84Q,"A superbly acted film. Apparently the last film before Phillip Seymour Hoffman committed suicide or over-dosed on drugs. I first became aware of his dynamic and forceful acting talent in the film: The Talented Mr. Ripley. A friend of a man killed brutally by the protagonist, excellently played by Matt Damon as a believable sociopathic guy, Hoffman was aggressively pushing against the paradigm that who the police thought was a suspicious character, was in fact, the killer. The cast included Jude Law, of course, and Gwenneth Paltrow as exasperated participants in a bloody game. Seymour Hoffman in ""A Most Wanted Man"" is relentless as a spy of a special unit in the German Government. This unit was outside the normal intelligence services, part Counter Intelligence, part Operational Intelligence, all of the German bureaucrats acting under the cloud that they had allowed three Al-Qaeda terrorists to plan & operate inside Germany prior to the September 11, 2001 attack on the United States. As such, the Bush assertion that ""you're either with us or against us,"" magnified by an evil Dick Cheney, and the CIA's complete break with past rules on interrogation, rendition, secret prisons, enhanced interrogation techniques and Machiavellian manuvers had put the hammer down, balls to the walls, whatever it takes to round these terrorists up. Hoffman's character is willing to lie and manipulate his own sources, but he is more focused on the ""barracuda"" who is in the film a Muslim cleric with a""moderate"" veneer who others are willing to accept at face value. Issa, the hapless Chechen illegal immigrant, is seen, through the film, as just that ... hapless. Hoffman believes the cleric is a funnel for illegal funds that are laundered en route to al-Qaeda operatives. He seem intent on proving that point. However, the CIA, which is pulling even bigger strings, double crosses him in a deal against other German bureaucrats who want nothing to do with possibly allowing another operation against the U.S. to happen. They will cooperate with the CIA because the CiA has become ruthless & will punish anyone ""against us."" Hoffman's character is a hard drinker, hard smoker. If Hoffman was that aggressive an addict, as a recovering addict, I feel sorry for him. Prior to his death, I may have heard he was an addict in recovery. As with so many actors, they manage to not name the 12 step program they're successful with (which is an adherence to our traditions to not identify our affiliation with a specific 12th group at the level of press, radio, TV, film, internet). If he did that delicate dance, it may have been harder for him to walk in a room of AA or NA. As such, he may have simply begun a long, slow slide to overdose. Too busy with his career, he chose roles, I suspect, that fit the personna of the guy who uses drugs and gains power from that use. He forgot he was powerless. Perhaps, in the end, he represents powerlessness v. hopelessness, when all his efforts disintegrate. Wilhelm Dafoe is also an excellent surprise. Robin Wright plays a superbly amoral CIA agent ...one who will operate with very few rules, to ensure that the world is ""a bit safer"" under the new Bush-Cheney guidelines that THEY define the parameters for such safety ... i.e., the American definition is the one that counts. Anything less, will bring betrayal of even friends who believe they've made deals but want their own payoff ... the ""baracouda"" in this case wasn't enough of a catch. The CIA wanted who fed the baracouda. And even who fed the feeder of the baracouda. Down that road lies torture and Guantanamo. Even at this time, those men like Issa may still linger in Guantanamo. That net caught many who were minor players. But with someone like Dick Cheney still rolling around, pleased with the results of that era, the shadow of September 11, still looms large. Hoffman's character simply couldn't or wouldn't go that far. In the end, he lost. In the end, like Health Ledger, Hoffman may have given up his life for his desire to act so firmly. Personally, I'm always sad to see public figures die because they won't stay with ""recovery"" as their primary mission. Robin Willams and Health Ledger are just two more. All, great losses.",1418515200,,4242,4.84435261707989

Hoffman's last movie and he does a decent job, though his impersonation of the late Welsh actor Richard Burton's speech pattern makes one wonder how the rest of the cast could keep a straight face.  Actually, there's a hint of Winston Churchill too and not a stretch at that considering the similarities of physiques.  But as I said, it's a decent movie and somewhat entertaining.  Willem Dafoe does an ambiguously bad/good guy and the Muslim bad guys aren't over the top villains.  There is an attempt to show they are, well, at least half-human.  The really bad, good-guys are, you guessed it, Germans.  But they too are just doing their jobs, and come to think of it, aren't any worse than the, ahem, American(s).  The only physical intimacy occurred during a couple of mock links usually shown in movies when a man suddenly embraces a woman so he can't be identified by someone else passing by.

6561348,4,B00M4LP84Q,"As someone who enjoyed TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY, I basically knew what to expect with this film. Instead of bombastic action, John Le Carre goes for a more subtle approach involving duplicity, backstabbing and double-crossing. Philip Seymour Hoffman leads the cast as Gunther Bachmann, a veteran German spy who runs a small outfit that uses informants as a way to catch bigger fish. And in a post-9/11 world, this represents a more scaled-back method than more controversial ones used by countries such as the US. The cast is rounded out by Willem Dafoe, Rachel McAdams and Robin Wright, who all give incredible performances alongside Hoffman, in one of his last film roles. In particular, Hoffman was excellent in portraying the world-weary spy. At times, it almost seemed like he wasn't even acting, with his heavy breathing and wheezing. The plot was rather straightforward, which was a nice change of pace from TINKER TAILOR. It tackled a timely subject with eloquence and simplicity, which I admired. The score was never intrusive, and came in at just the right moments. Overall, I quite liked it. I can understand if certain viewers might find it dry or boring, but for those who enjoy this type of spy movie that requires more of your attention, I can heartily recommend this.",1417737600,,1287,4.962962962962963

6561365,3,B00M4LP84Q,"If you're like me when you think of spy films the first thing that pops into your head is James Bond. You think of the gadgets, the girls and the suave, sophisticated agent doing his all to save the world. Rarely does someone think of characters like George Smiley, the docile looking bureaucrat from the John Le Carre novels that looked more like a banker than the spies we were used to. But chances are in the real world thats what spies really look like. And Le Carre has made a career of writing about spies like that.

A MOST WANTED MAN gives us another spy of sorts from the real world in the person of Gunther Bachmann (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Gunther is the head of an elite group in the German government in charge of seeking out possible terrorists and preventing them from attacks like those witnessed on 9/11. But the problems that occurred prior to that date continue in this country where various organizations fail to work together, each one wanting to take credit for the capture or killing of anyone deemed dangerous. Gunther is more in line to try and put the person hes after to use where as his counterpart sees termination as the best possible solution.

Most of the movie revolves around Gunthers team trying to find and handle a young man named Issa, an illegal immigrant who has come to Germany to collect an inheritance his father left him years ago. Where they first suspect him of being dangerous the more they find out about him the less they believe him to be a threat. Instead Gunther wants to use him to reach the people hes talking to, a banker and another man believed to be the main man in Germany funneling funds to terrorists. Gunther wants to use this man as a means to an end. His counterpart just wants to take him down immediately so he can take credit for one man eliminated from the list; he has no concept of the long term goals that can be achieved.

The story offers a back and forth on two levels. The first is the day to day handling of Issa and the people around him. How the team convinces others to work with them, making promises they might not be able to keep while influencing people with no known contacts with terrorists, make for an interesting topic in the film. The second level is between Gunther and the lead of his opposing team. Gunther wants to do the best work possible and prevent any attacks in the long run, his opponent just wants praise for taking someone out now.

While these stories are interesting in the long run they make for a very dry movie. There is almost no action involved in this film. There is plenty of discussion between characters and groups involved in the story as well as with participants dragged into the skullduggery involved in spying. Its more of a wordy film than one might expect when the word spies is used. If you know going in that the film moves at a slow pace then you will enjoy it. If Bond is what you're seeking then avoid it.

Many are flocking to this film and praising it solely because it is considered the last starring role for Hoffman who died of a drug overdose last year. Hoffman had a long career that had some great roles and others that in my observations didn't deserve the praise they received. Here he turns in an admirable performance as the chain smoking tired looking government bureaucrat trying to do his best and finding opponents on his side as well as those against his country.

In the end I cant recommend this movie for everyone but fans of Le Carre will want to check it out. Fans of Hoffman will want to see the movie as well. It isn't a bad movie but you have to know what to expect walking in. If you do youll find an entertaining evening here.",1417564800,2,3679,4.4188790560471976

6561414,4,B00M4LP84Q,"A Most Wanted Man,"" based on the 2008 John Le Carre bestseller, stars Philip Seymour Hoffman as German intelligence agent Gunther Bachmann, a heavy-drinking chain smoker whose attempts at exposing a Muslim terrorist ring are hindered by other agencies eager to root out the ring and score. Less about foiling terrorist plots than about differing approaches to dealing with the threat, the movie co-stars Robin Wright (House of Cards) as the face of the CIA, an ideologue eager to dictate how Bachmann should pursue a likely Al Qaeda middleman.

Director Anton Corbijn sustains suspense by focusing on how Bachmann and his team go about discovering the real identity of Issa Karpov (Grigoriy Dobrygin), a Chechen Russian from Turkey who turns up in Germany seeking political refuge. Karpov engages German human rights lawyer Annabel Richter (Rachel McAdams) to help him collect his deceased Russian fathers fortune from a German bank run by Thomas Brue (Willem Dafoe).

Inspired by true events, the film tracks the methodical, often tedious work of many individuals and organizations as they keep tabs on suspects and try to ferret out nefarious schemes, determining when to wait, when to follow leads, when to corroborate intelligence, and when to close in.

Hoffman looks very much the rumpled bureaucrat on top of his game. Hes no James Bond. In fact, hes exactly the opposite  sedentary, overweight, whose weapons are computers, intercepted communications, informants, and experience.

Bonus features on the Blu-ray edition include a digital copy, making-of featurette, and profile of John Le Carre in Hamburg.",1417046400,,1613,5.309803921568627
6561415,5,B00M4LP84Q,"It's a story with many subtle layers, and is definitely a film for the thinker. The movie is very well made, because it makes you think and leaves you no choice but to do so. However, it achieves this without being forceful about it. It's the kind of film where hours later you still pick up on nuanced exchanges between the characters. The acting was adequate all round, but Hoffman and his character stands out above the restwell acted. I would classify it as a drama/spy thriller.

****Semi-spoiler alert:*****
The story revolves around a German agent who collects information by making deep connections with people in the informant networks he builds up, caring about them, and tries to help them as human beings. He accepts that reality is complex and refrains from applying hyperbole and overreactions onto them, while keeping perspective of what the true, broad goals of intelligence collecting is. Ironically, he instills into his co-workers that there is no place for emotion and weakness in their jobs, and distances himself emotionally from them. Devastatingly to his emotional well-being, he gets betrayed by an American counterpart who he allowed himself to trust, despite initial reservations based on a previous incident. The end result is his guilt at having exposed his informants and players to harm after promising them a safe outcome. The film maintains a good pace and tensions throughout.",1417046400,,1410,5.103896103896104

6561423,4,B00M4LP84Q,"A MOST WANTED MAN is a 2014 British slow-burning spy thriller film based on the 2008 novel of the same name by John le Carr.  The novel is loosely based on the true War on Terror story of Murat Kurnaz, a Turkish citizen who was arrested in Pakistan in late 2001 and held by the United States at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp for five years. (Kurnaz was released and arrived in Germany on August 24, 2006.) The film premiered at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival.  Directed by Anton Cobijn, the Dutch photographer and film director of THE AMERICAN, the film is star-studded:  Philip Seymour Hoffman, Rachel McAdams, Willem Dafoe, and Robin Wright.  It is the last of Hoffman's films released in his lifetime.

The setting of both the film and the novel is in the post 9/11 city of Hamburg, the German port city where Mohammed Atta and his collaborators planned the 2001 American attacks. The plot is not complex. A half-Chechen, half-Russian, brutally tortured immigrant (Grigoriy Dobrygin) turns up in Hamburg's Islamic community, laying claim to his father's ill-gotten fortune. Both German and US security agencies take a close interest to determine this most wanted man's true identity.  Is he an oppressed victim or destruction-bent terrorist?

Gnther Bachmann (a grizzled and perpetually smoking Hoffman) leads a covert German intelligence organization that seeks to develop intelligence from the local Muslim community.  The identity of the immigrant is soon revealed: one Issa Karpov who is considered by many to be a potentially dangerous terrorist. Karpov contacts an immigration lawyer (Rachel McAdams) though a local Muslim family.  The lawyer visits a banker (Willem Dafoe), whose father laundered money for Karpov's father, and verifies the inheritance.

While director Cobijn captures the mood and atmosphere of post 9/11 Hamburg, A MOST WANTED MAN is not a nuanced character study like his 2010's THE AMERICAN with George Clooney. Once used to the German accent, you'll be impressed by Hoffman's rare leading man performance, which won raves at the premiere of the film weeks before his death.  He brings a world-weary quality coupled with a ""deep understanding of human complexity and the reality that no one is either fully good or fully evil"" to the role.

With the help of a young lawyer (whom he calls a social worker for terrorists), a cagey CIA agent (Robin Wright in a hideous black wig), and a shifty banker/money launderer, Bachmann conjures a convoluted and dangerous trap for a Muslim academic who's been backing terrorist activity via donations to a Cyprus-based shipping company.

Reason being was that I saw Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy in theaters a while back hoping it was going to be good but was a disappointed. But because this was Hoffman's last leading performance, I figured I should try it. I was pleasantly surprised! The cast is solid inlcuding Ms. McAdams and Defoe! The story is relatively straight forward. It's at a slow pace but it picks up towards the end! It's definitely worth the wait! I was never a die hard Hoffman fan or a fan of John LeCarre and spy movies for that matter. But everything came in an awesome package! The film ends with an alternate version of one of my favorite Tom Waits songs ""Hoist That Rag""! I loved that the director included this. The soundtrack itself is great with some regular songs and a full score with some accordion. Ultimately, I was left satisfied and sad that this was Hoffman's final performance. I really liked him in the recent ""The Master"". The film really adds an eerie undertone to the ending of Hoffman's life. He was a fine actor and will be missed. The general negative critiques of this film are that it's too slow and the performances aren't great, specifically Hoffman's German accent. Well, since movies are like eye candy nowadays for people who want something fast-paced and action packed, a slow thoughtful film like this will leave the average person ""bored"". With regards to the German accent, I thought it was well executed. I'm sure there's no ultimate German accent nor do I think American viewers are experts in this matter. But if you like Hoffman, John LeCarre novels, spy thrillers, good acting, politics, or maybe just good music, this film is for you!

6561444,5,B00M4LP84Q,"John le Carr&eacute;'s brilliant novel A MOST WANTED MAN has been transformed into a screenplay by Andrew Bovell and Stephen Cornwell and as directed by Anton Corbijn the very complex story works well - primarily because of the performances of a near perfect cast. The theme is in keeping with John le Carr&eacute;'s loathing of the Cold War spying crimes and this particular story, though difficult to follow at times (a factor that helps the innate confusion of the spying and counterspying - a process examined by the film) it is a piercingly indictment of the machinations of the spying and terrorist techniques of all countries.

When Issa Karpov (Grigoriy Dobrygin), a half-Chechen, half-Russian, brutally tortured immigrant turns up in Hamburg's Islamic community, laying claim to his father's ill gotten fortune, both German - G&uuml;nther Bachmann (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a worn-out, beat-up, used-up operative and his aides Irna Frey (Nina Hoss) and Maximillian (Daniel Br&uuml;hl) - and US security agencies - Martha Sullivan (Robin Wright) take a close interest. One Human Rights Lawyer (Rachel McAdams) attempts to help Issa with the aid of Bachmann and Frey. As with almost all evil acts the villain is money - Issa has come to inform his father's best friend, banker Abdullah (Homayoun Ershadi) that the money he is to inherit must be given to charities (Issa vehemently disapproved of his father's ill-gotten gains). As the clock ticks down and the stakes rise, the race is on to establish this most wanted man's true identity - oppressed victim or destruction-bent extremist? A MOST WANTED MAN explores the dirty side of intelligence work complicated by counterspying and is a contemporary, cerebral tale of intrigue, love, rivalry, and politics that prickles with tension right through to its last desperately surprising scene.

Philip Seymour Hoffman is brilliant in this downbeat, distrusting, disheveled, difficult role and is well supported by a fine cast, including Willem Dafoe, the underused Mehdi Dehbi and Neil Malik Abdullah. The film is choppy, the accents and all spoken dialogue is rather difficult to follow, but the impact this anti-spying statement makes is well worth the time invested.

6561575,5,B00M4LP84Q,"""A Most Wanted Man"" is directed by Anton Corbijn from the screenplay (Andrew Bovell) which is based on the John le Carre' novel of the same name. An intriguing spy thriller that will seduce you slowly as this storyline is unafraid to take its time.  The suspense builds within the plot of cohesive storytelling. This film's direction is quite clever with its cast as they can leave you guessing from scene to scene. Philip Seymour Hoffman is Gunther Bachmann, who heads up a small ""unknown"" security division that carefully and methodically spies on new suspects coming into Hamburg, Germany.  Entering in under the cover of the nighttime is a half-Chechen and half-Russian man, Issa Karpov (Grigoriy Dobrygin).  He has been horribly tortured and has come to claim his late father's money from the banker, Tommy Brue (Willem Dafoe) while slipping into the Islamic community.  Gunther is on the case.  Hoffman is once again able to completely chameleon himself into another character and champions each and every nuance of his role.  His performance rivals anything he has done previously as Hoffman is a master of his craft and here he is again.

I was interested from the very start as the story added a new character and then another into its plot.  As on top of this as Gunther is American security agent, Martha Sullivan (Robin Wright).  They must know the true identity of Issa, who is he? Why is he here? What does he want?  Who is he really?  To help get some of these questions answered is Annabel Richter (Rachel McAdams), a ""pacifist"" lawyer, human rights activist hired to aid him by people in the community.  Gunther works tirelessly with Irna Frey (Nina Hoss) to stay one step ahead at all times and this is certainly not their first waltz together.  The film is generously cast and beautifully scored (Herbert Gronemeyer) with a soundtrack that ticks with its own tension adding to a potboiler at times.  This is a careful spin on a chessboard, a thoughtfully crafted piece in comparison.  It twists and turns right up to the ending, the ending that I will not even flirt with except to say, it cannot be missed.

I usually don't care a whole lot for spy thrillers as I get lost trying to follow difficult plotlines, twists that take me way off base or just plain confusing situations.  I did not find that here.  This is easy to follow, although it is still quite intricate, once you start becoming vested in the characters in the storyline. It almost transcends what you might expect from this type of film as there are no huge explosions or overblown anything. This is a mind craft.  One of this year's best in suspenseful views, ""A Most Wanted Man"" plays fair, not predictable but surely does not spin you away from the action and this is mainly all in the acting.  I was completely hooked from the point of pushing play ...",1415318400,2,2842,4.691532258064516

The plot moves along deliberately, no ""Hollywood flourishes,"" which may be why some people find it ""slow."" If you like cerebral spy movies with great performances, I highly recommend this.

6561611,4,B00M4LP84Q,"I've read the other reviews here and I've got to agree with one thing that the ""most critical reviewer"" said. This was that although it is accurate and realistic to the bone, it drags in the middle because of its earnestness in covering such important material. He further contends it loses some of its entertainment value when it does this. I agree but I cannot grade it as low as 3 stars as he did. But that sagging in the middle should knock a star off.

I cannot fault any actor in the movie itself. They are all top notch. Hoffman has the lead and it is his final lead. He does a great job. As i understand it, he was already deeply in the throes of substance addiction but that sure didn't hinder his acting in top form, as per usual. Willem Defoe plays a German banker. I didn't believe he was German but otherwise he was fine. Actually, the only American I  came close to believing was German was Hoffman and even that was a stretch. But this could be from decades of watching foreign movies with subtitles so I know what a ""real"" German movie sounds like.

The plot is post 9-11. Germany is concentrating on Islamic terrorists just like everyone is. We are there, of course, in the form of Robin Wright and are ready to jump all over any government not ""on"" Islamic terrorists 24-7. The Germans have one lined up and they proceed to run him. They do all the things spies do minus any of the glamour. Hoffman looks like an unmade bed most of the time. He knows what he's doing but if you saw him on the street you would never think he was a spy. I am sure that is what real spies aim for as a goal. He is completely convincing.

Except for the dragging in the middle of the film, it is really quite good and I do intend to watch it again. It may even go up that final star on a second watching.

P.S.  I watched it again and it is still 4 stars.

This is about the 1000th movie since 9/11 that focuses on hunting terrorists. For some reason they all seem to drag to me. I can't help but think of The Good Shepherd every time I see a movie like this. I think the problem with these are that they are very serious in tone to the point of almost being too serious. By that I mean that they try and show step by step what happens when the look for someone and that really tends to slow the movies way down. In terms of importance these movies are toward the top. In terms of entertainment they are near the bottom. This genre starts off strong and ends strong but the middle hour and a half really drags to the point of making it a struggle to get through.

It is a slow moving spy drama (not a thriller) with few action scenes and not a lot of suspense. The film is set in Hamburg and follows the activities of Philip Seymour Hoffman's unhealthy,wheezy anti terrorist chief who sets up an elaborate sting operation to entrap a suspected Jihadist financier after a young Chechen illegal immigrant arrives in town. The rather plain looking Rachel McAdams plays the Chechen's lawyer , or terrorist social worker,as Hoffman labels her. The film plods along slowly as Hoffman sets up his sting which culminates in an unexpected dramatic ending. Hoffman doesn't look a well man in this film,chain smoking ,whiskey drinking and generally looking knackered throughout. I think this film is a reasonably intelligent,moderately interesting one, but one lacking in excitement and suspense. Not particularly memorable.",1410566400,3,979,5.163522012578617

(Too bad, because he's pretty good.)

A major flaw, though: Karpov. The lurking, menacing, sullen, silent, facing-the-wall refuge from Chechnya. It's a role we've seen so many times, in so many films, it's become really, really annoying and it's all the fault of director Corbijn.",1410393600,6,640,4.663716814159292
6561624,5,B00M4LP84Q,"""A Most Wanted Man"" is one of those stories where even though this particular event did not occur you get the strong sense that it's filled with truths. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Gunter Bachmann whose job is to run a small secret-from-the-public group in Hamburg, Germany to keep abreast of and address  potential terrorist threats. Much like the movie Captain Phillips, this film lets the viewer see all sides of the story. It breaks down the concept of ""Good-guy"" and ""Bad-guy"" into its more complex components. The movie starts with Issa a 1/2 Russian, 1/2 Chechen man sneaking into Hamburg; Issa has been imprisoned and tortured for the crimes of his Russian father, he's either been released or escaped and is a potential terrorist threat. Gunter and his female partner Irna, who he works with closely and loves deeply, immediately get Issa on their radar and start following his movements.

It becomes a game of ""using the minnow to catch the barracuda to catch the shark."" The film keeps the audience guessing as to which person is which fish. All the while the German and US officials are threatening on the side lines to jump in and knock down mid-step the intricate house of cards that Gunter and Irna are building. We find out mid-movie just why there is this bad blood between Gunter and the US through an official (played by Robin Wright of the show House of Cards) admitting to a past US mid-step that did much personal and career damage to Gunter. Now Gunter (as well as the audience) is all the more wary of who he can trust, with the government officials being arguably harder to decipher and read than the terrorists.

The film does a wonderful job of explaining new and complicated political concepts and spinning an intricate mystery in a palatable and understandable way. Highly recommend this topical film for both the entertainment, characters, fine-acting (with Hoffman at the top of his game), story and mystery side as well as to get a better grip on the world we live in today in terms of terrorist activity and untangling and combating it.",1410220800,10,2070,4.776536312849162

A Chechen Muslim illegally immigrates to Hamburg seeking his fathers ill-gotten fortune, where he gets caught in the international war on terror.

What did I think?

Anton Corbijns background in still photography for lots of famous bands has clearly influenced the visual aspect of this film. Coupled with the mastery of Andrew Bovell (make no mistake, its nothing like his earlier effort Strictly Ballroom), John le Carres story and characters suck you in. The tension in this film is delivered subtly, before you know it you are on the edge of your seat. Anton, John, Andrew and Philip all in one place made this reviewer a very happy camper.

Directed by Andrew Corbiin and based upon a John Le Carre novel, the film is set in Hamburg after the events of September 11. It portrays the conflicts between several anti-terrorist agencies, German and American, as they disagree about the means of uncovering a large terror-based organization with roots in Hamburg. The cast features a suspected terrorist who has been smuggled into Hamburg, a left-leading young attractive attorney who tries to help him, a Muslim leader in Hamburg who speaks of peace but who smuggles money to terrorists, and a woman operative from the U.S. State Department.  The movie develops slowly and carefully with a gradual increase of tension. The plot is easy to follow. The film offers as well excellent views of contemporary Hamburg. The movie has a highly topical interest with the continued threat of terrorist groups around the world. But the central attraction of the movie is Hoffman.  He portrays the chain-smoking, methodical, and disheveled Gunther Bachmann in a way which slowly develops his character and his experience together with his quiet strength in fighting terrorism. Bachmann is a figure with both substantial depths and substantial wiles in this, Hoffman's last role. ""A Most Wanted Man"" is well-worth seeing.

6561627,5,B00M4LP84Q,"Anton Corbijn's ""A Most Wanted Man"" is a well-made, suitably depressing adaptation of a John Le Carre novel. Set in modern-day Hamburg, it stars Philip Seymour Hoffman as Gunter Bachmann, a cynical, hard-drinking intelligence officer heading a special anti-terrorism unit. His latest assignment is to track the movements of Issa Karpov (Grigoriy Dobrygin), a suspected Chechen terrorist who has literally washed up in Hamburg for reasons unknown. Others involved in the story include Annabel Richter (Rachel McAdams), an idealistic civil rights lawyer who tries to help Issa; Tommy Brue (Willem Dafoe), a shady banker who holds the secret of Issa's presence in Hamburg; Martha Sullivan (Robin Wright), a CIA operative with her own agenda; and Dr. Abdullah (Homayoun Ershadi), a Muslim philanthropist who may be funding more sinister projects than hospitals and orphanages.

Corbijn and screenwriter Andrew Bovell tip us off early, via the film's palpable sense of impending doom, that nothing good will emanate from the collision of these people. Nevertheless, the film is compelling, particularly as a showcase for excellent actors playing fascinating characters. As sad as ""A Most Wanted Man"" is, the saddest thing about it is that Hoffman, who so masterfully inhabits the skin of Gunter Bachmann, is no more. This is one of Hoffman's finest performances, and it is unbearable to think that, except for a handful of movies still awaiting release, we will not see him again.",1410134400,5,1475,5.330472103004292

6561630,5,B00M4LP84Q,"A Most Wanted Man - Phillip Seymore Hoffman's last movie before he OD'ed on heroin. John LeCarre has been writing spy books and movies since the fifties. He was an ex-MI6 agent, England's CIA. didn't care for Ian Flemings ""silly"" James Bond and his description of the activity of spies so he wrote books about real spycraft and spies, the arguably most accurate ever written. His first book made into a movie was, ""The Spy who came in from the Cold"" which came out about the same time as ""Dr No"".  He wrote ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" (the First six part Alec Guinness series is perhaps the best spy series ever done) and ""Smiley's People"". He wrote ""Russia House"", etc. Le Carre still keep writing them, fifty plus years late. He also directs this one, set in Germany.

Hoffman plays Gnter Bachmann. The German gov't can't spy on it's own people, by law. So they fund secretly Hoffman's group to spy on suspected  Taliban agents and Taliban supporters in Germany. The CIA and MI6 are also interested. Hoffman and his group carefully go after ""minnows to catch sharks and sharks to catch whales"". Consistently suspenseful like a pot of water brought to a slow boil. Le Carre himself says Hoffman's portrayal of the German spymaster is as good as Alec Guinness's wonderful portrayal of George Smiley, or better, and that is saying something. The first movie I've seen this year with an acting job worthy or a ""best actor"" award.

It is often hard to tell if Hoffman's character Bachman is old, tired, fat, overweight and smoking because of really superb acting or if the soon to be dead Hoffman was in that bad a shape.

Don't go expecting a lot of car chases and shootouts. LeCarre and Hoffman build tension gradually like in ""Argo"".

Recently a Russian-Chechen Muslim (Grigoriy Dobrygin) illegally immigrates to Hamburg. His father was a bad guy and his motives are suspect. He is represented by a lawyer (Rachel McAdams). G&uuml;nther Bachmann (Philip Seymour Hoffman) heads up a local agency that is in charge of anti-terrorism. He has ties to the CIA and has bigger fish to fry.

This is not an action spy film. They don't shoot guns. The first 50 minutes or so build up the story and characters before it gets into gear and once in gear, it moved slowly along. I love Hoffman, but he sounded like he was attempting to do Churchill. The film has some good drama scenes, a few good lines, and a WTF ending I didn't see coming.

For those who loved the novel, or ""Tinker, Tailor..."" this should be perfect for you. Lovers of action spy films will find themselves dozing off as we see a more realistic story.

Parental guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. 3 1/2 stars",1408233600,,1058,4.557894736842106

In one of his last performances, Philip Seymour Hoffman, shows off his mastery of the acting craft as Gunther Bachmann, the leader of a small spy unit of the German government.  Assigned to Hamburg where the 9/11 terrorists hatched their plot against the United States, Bachman and his small squad are charged specifically with watching for evil doers within the Muslim community.

We see Issa Karpov (Grigoriy Dobrygin) slip into the country but he is soon identified as a possible Islamic extremist coming from Chechenia by way of Turkey.  Rather than pick him up, Bachmann allows him to ""walk"" as he puts it.  Followed all the time, Issa finds refuge with a Turkish family, then obtains legal help from a human rights lawyer (Rachel McAdams).  Is he a terrorist or not?  He is found to be the son of a deceased Russian general.  The general, it seems left a large fortune for the son with a bank now run by Tommy Brue (Willem Dafoe), himself the son the original banker and a friend of the general's.  But what is the money to be used for?  We find out as soon and Bachmann and his crew do at the same time.

Tightly directed, with the use of many hand held cameras, by Anton Corbijn (""The American""), the film bogs down slightly during scenes where Bachmann has to refocus his plan.  But make no mistake, each scene moves the story along, pretty rare these days.  If you are looking for a shoot-`em-up action film, this isn't it.  In fact the only violence has Bachman throwing a punch in a bar.  This is a scene-by-scene procedural that raises the tension level with each event.  Hoffman is brilliant as the slovenly Bachman.  He chain smokes, drinks whiskey in his morning coffee and has a hard time keeping his shirt tucked in.  He doesn't look well but plays the role to the hilt.  This is a very good, intelligent spy thriller.",1408147200,173,1880,4.605421686746988
