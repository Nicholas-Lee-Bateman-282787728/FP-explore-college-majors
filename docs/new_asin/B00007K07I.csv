Miss Rogers is stunning in her beauty and charm in this sort of dual character performance.  This songs by Jerome Kern and Dorothy Fields are some of the best of Ginger's career, and her delivery of them is beautiful and soulful.  This movie is very ""meta"" in that there seems to be a semi-autobiographical element.  Carol Corliss' career seemed to really mirror Ginger's career at the time.
My only complaint is that this film is not available in the United States.  As an American, I'm super annoyed that a film by my favorite actress, who is the epitome of the all-American girl, is not available here in the US.  Annoyed that I have to watch this wonderfully American film through Spanish subtitles.  Makes absolutely no sense.  Come on US film distributors, get it together.  The same thing can be said for Miss Rogers' other films 'Tender Comrade' and 'Professional Sweetheart', which are also only available in region 2 Spanish.",1431993600,,1100,4.742105263157895

And even though this is a VHS tape the quality is very good. I have a Spanish released Disc but am unable to remove the subtitles, so this was my next choice to see this rare movie. Come on commercial release companies, get your act together and get these rare Movies of Ginger Rogers out onto the market place.",1391126400,3,449,4.487804878048781

7977151,5,B00007K07I,"This is a wonderfully funny and pleasant romantic comedy, which is under-appreciated today.  No high-quality dvd release from a major US studio exists, which is a shame because ""In Person"" shows Ginger Rogers at the peak of her beauty, in a plot that allows her to display all of her many talents, including singing and dancing.  And George Brent unbends and gives a fine comedic performance of a man who falls in love with a movie star but pretends not to so that her head won't get any more swelled than it already is!

This Spanish dvd offered by vendor DaaVeeDee is the best version of the movie ever made available.  Although the film has not been restored, it is of good quality visually, the sound is excellent, and there is included a fantastic booklet (in Spanish) about the film and its importance for Rogers' career, the stars and supporting cast, and the director, with excellent glossy photos and lobby cards.  The dvd is Region 2, so requires an all-region or PAL player.",1323734400,3,985,4.670520231213873
