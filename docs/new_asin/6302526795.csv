475911,4,6302526795,"Most Christmas movies make me want to run for the insulin because they are so sappy sweet. Not this one! This modern remake of the old classic is just what today's Christmas movies needed. Dyan Cannon is smart, savvy, and willing to own up to her mistakes. Kris Kristofferson is the perfect earthy foil to be the hero, and Tony Curtis' masterful comedic rendition of the interfering obnoxious boss adds just the right amount of spice.

For those who like good feelings without the overdone sugar, this movie is a perfect holiday favorite.",1122940800,11,538,4.78494623655914
475912,5,6302526795,I loved this movie. I think it is so much better than the original. This movie is so Christmassy. With the snow and the deorations. It is a cute love story. It is just a real feel good movie. I recommend it highly!,1105056000,12,214,4.0
475913,4,6302526795,"Okay - I admit it, I love Dyan Cannon and even though this doesn't have the depth or sentimentality of the original, this more contemporary version is still a great holiday film. Cannon's comic timing here is great and the best reason to get this version.  Yeah, it's cute, but it is also charming and good fun.  Recommended for your annual holiday viewing.",1096675200,22,357,4.650793650793651
475914,5,6302526795,I love this movie and it always gets our family in the mood for the chaos of the Holidays. I have never seen the original but would watch this movie many more times that I would watch Christmas Story which is relentlously shown a bazillion times during the holidays. I am very excited about this moving finally coming out on dvd!!!!!!,1095379200,6,334,4.491803278688525
475915,4,6302526795,"While I agree with the previous reviewer regarding the original movie being a classically better production, I must say that I find this remake with Dyan Cannon and Kris Kristopherson a delightful and light holiday movie.  It is one of those ""feel good"" holiday movies that gets you in the spirit of Christmas.  Tony Curtis is halirious as the producer who is worried about ratings and network politics; the side stories are light and provide comic relief every few scenes.  If you are looking for a deeply emotional movie like ""It's a Wonderful Life"", then this movie is not for you.  However, if you, like me, want to intersperse George Bailey (admittedly a humourous movie in many areas) with a few laughs and a simple, light hearted movie during the Christmas season, give this movie a chance.  If you're looking for light-hearted romance based on the spirit of Christmas, you won't be disappointed with this remake (or the original) Christmas in Connecticut.",1090108800,30,963,4.919753086419753
475916,1,6302526795,"Okay, so this isn't a review of the DVD, since it won't be released until October - but can anyone tell me why this awful 1992 television remake is being released on DVD but NOT the wonderful Barbara Stanwyck original from 1945? Please tell me it's not to ""cash in"" on the new-found popularity of its director, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (or however you spell his name). It was a most inauspicious directorial debut for the California governor, notably NOT propelling him into a directorial career. Film buffs can only hope that this release gets swept under the carpet quickly and that Warner Home Video will come to its senses and release the delightful original in time for the 2004 holiday season.",1089763200,4,701,4.801652892561983
475917,5,6302526795,This version makes for a fun filled afternoon of holiday viewing. Never taking itself too seriously Arnold does a wonderful job in his directorial debut. Dyan Cannon is wonderful as the cook who really can't. Makes you wonder if other cooking shows are real! Real or not I gurantee they are not this much fun! I really enjoyed the fact that when people are outside you can't see their breath. Like I said just a fun movie. Highly recommended!!!,1011830400,9,444,4.632911392405063
475918,5,6302526795,"I actually rented this movie the first time by mistake after a freind had recommended the original with Barbara Stanwyck. After viewing both versions (both are excellent) I decided that I prefered this timely updated version. Dyan Carrol is charming as the Martha Stewart-type hostess of a tv cooking and  home-craft show who dispite being unmarried and living in a sparse city loft, broadcasts a quite different image to her viewing audience. She talks  on her show about her (totally fictitious) daughter, grandchild, husband and her big country house in Connecticut while cooking up gourmet dishes that are actually produced behind the scenes by her assistant. Her producer (played  with hysterical results by Tony Curtis) cooks up a publicity scheme involving a live Christmas show broadcast from her Connecticut ""home"" where she will be surrounded by her ""friends and family"". When he also arranges for her to be playing hostess to a reluctant local hero (played by Kris Kristofferson), who is unaware that this is all a charade, an already humorous plotline becomes a series of hilarious mixups, mishaps and mistaken identities. This truly wonderful, heartwarming and funny movie is sure to become one of your holiday favorites too.",1008720000,30,1238,5.211055276381909
475919,4,6302526795,I enjoy watching this remake as much as the original. Well worth watching for the whole family. It used to be on TV several times during the holidays but I haven't seen it the past 2 or 3 years.

476052,5,6302526795,"I enjoyed Dyan Cannon's performances as Judge Cone on ""Ally McBeal,"" and I also enjoyed Barbara Stanwyck's version of Christmas in Connecticut (1945), so, of course, I wanted a copy of this version.  I enjoyed this version so much that, when I misplaced it, I ordered another copy.

Director Arnold Schwarzenegger and writer Janet Brownell put several twists into this updated version of the 1945 classic. For one thing, Elizabeth Blane (Lane in Stanwyck's version) is a television cook, similar to Paula Deen, instead of merely a writer.

Also, Mr. Yardley, played by Tony Curtis, is in on the hoax (Elizabeth doesn't cook!) and pairs himself with Elizabeth as her husband, with no planned wedding or officiant; he just pretends to have been married to Elizabeth for an unspecified amount of time.  His competition is Oprah, and he has a boss, a network executive named Mr. Prescott, played by Richard Roundtree, who is the head honcho kept out of the loop.  In the 1945 version, Mr. Yardley was the top dog, and kept out of the loop, while a sincere suitor, Mr. Sloan, spends most of the film engaged to Ms. Lane, but still trying to win her heart.

Instead of playing a U.S. Navy Sailor stranded on the high seas when a German submarine sinks his ship, Kris Kristofferson plays a Jefferson Jones who is a forest ranger whose cabin in the Colorado mountains burns down while he's rescuing a little boy in a blizzard.  While the 1945 version of Jones was a sincere fan of Elizabeth Lane and wanted to taste her cooking, Ranger Jones had never read any of Elizabeth Blane's material, but by some odd chance, one of her cookbooks was found among the remains of his cabin, so he accepted a $25,000 offer from Mr. Yardley to play himself on a Christmas special starring Ms. Blane, because he (Jones) needed the money to rebuild his cabin.

Instead of having a male friend who cooks, Elizabeth Blane has a female friend named Josie, who, instead of being a single and uncomplicated chef like Ms. Lane's friend Felix, has a significant other who works waving a sign in a chicken costume for a restaurant while waiting for his big break in the film and television industry.  To complicate matters, Josie wants children but her man doesn't.

Norah is Elizabeth's housekeeper in this version, instead of Mr. Sloan's.

Elizabeth Blane is a shopaholic with an eye for knickknacks, whereas Ms. Lane was merely in debt six months for one mink coat.  This is one way in which the updated version panders to the modern liberal media.  Can you imagine Oprah's competition getting away with purchasing a mink coat and remaining competitive?  Another way this version panders to liberals is by having Elizabeth Blane startle Ranger Jones so he misses his shot when he tries to hunt the goose she's supposed to cook for Christmas.  I'm surprised our hero and Mr. Yardley weren't castrated for even thinking of hunting anytime of year!

As someone who wore a costume (Lady Liberty's) while waving a sign within sight of the Hollywood sign, and, as someone who worked in the film and television industry for five years in Hollywood, I could relate to this film in ways which people who never worked in the industry might not appreciate as much as I do.  I soon discovered that ""reality"" T.V. is about as real as the ""faux"" jewelry you see in commercials.  The most real reality shows I worked on were those of talk show hosts Jay Leno, Craig Ferguson, Jeff Probst, and John Kerwin (Anthony Jeselnik and Steve O., not so much).  Those guys do their shows in one ""take.""  Directors of other reality shows just make stories up as they go along.  ""Who's going to win this bid?"" asks a reality auction show star before the camera starts rolling... ""Hey, it just so happens that about half a dozen of our background extras are Asian today; even though they've never seen each other before, let's have them form an Asian gang which tries to intimidate our star bidders!""

Although I don't remember working for a Director as asinine as Tony Curtis' Mr. Yardley, I saw firsthand how they let their production assistants be ""the bad guys,"" bullying minor cast members and crew, over the most minute and ludicrous details.  For example, Mr. Yardley does not allow Ms. Blane to call pesto ""pesto,"" because the word ""pesto"" is too passe, and Oprah would never say that word.

""Move closer to the camera!  Why are you guys standing so close to the wall?""

""Because someone else is having us hold this door shut, since it won't stay closed on its own!""

The film and T.V. industry is also full of pathetic, bottom feeding losers who don't recognize a good deal when it's slapping them in the face.  Josie's man was so concerned about an audition for a role he probably wouldn't get, that he didn't want a supporting role in Ms. Blane's Christmas Special.  He apparently missed the memo that a bird in hand is better than two in the bush!",1449619200,,4902,4.68065268065268

476122,1,6302526795,"Horrible.
Like others i thought a modern take on the beloved classic would be fun.  This is unwatchable.  In addition to the perfunctory, flat updating of the storyline (mountain man saves little boy, becomes acclaimed hero, somehow ends up with homemaking expert for holidays) the dialogue is uninspired, the chemistry is lacking, the supporting characters are annoying and moronic. Dorky, unsuitable and overly amplified music doesn't help, nor do the constant scenes with characters hollering and shouting over one another, the crying baby, etc.

Bellowing, hollering, screeching, startled outbursts, mugging, goofy behavior and implausible interactions abound.  It's crass and low-class.  What a waste of an opportunity.

The classic ""tell instead of show"" mistakes are made -- for example in the set-up scenes, there is a dull conversation between Lane and her assistant with the assistant urging her to look for love and Lane replying ponderously that following her divorce she enjoys being single and uncomplicated.  Contrast to the original where the mise en scene, deft camerawork (panning to the laundry on the apartment rooftop) and Lane's solo purchase of a mink coat gave what we needed to know about her lifestyle, marital status and tastes.  Multiply the same ham-handedness throughout.

This isn't really a remake, more a theft of a name and vague idea.  Ugh!",1419984000,,1375,5.3534883720930235

476296,2,6302526795,"I had been wanting to see this movie for years, but somehow had never gotten around to it.  I love the original from 1945 with Barbara Stanwyck, and since I'd always found Dyan Cannon hugely appealing (I loved her in DeathTrap), I decided to order this from Amazon based solely on my desire to watch it.

It has a great comedic premise, somewhat updating the plot of the original. Cannon is the host of her own television cooking show, and of course - she can't cook.  Therein lies pretty much the entire source of humor for this 1992 TV movie.  Since she, or her show's producer (Tony Curtis) will do pretty much anything to improve her ratings, they latch upon a plan to use a media hero (Kris Kristofferson, whose character lost his home in a fire) to boost viewership.  Their plan is to invite him to Cannon's perfect home in Connecticut (which doesn't exist - she lives in a NYC apartment), meet her perfect family (which also doesn't exist - she's single), and enjoy a perfect Christmas dinner to be cooked by Cannon (good luck with that!), all on live TV.  Sounds pretty funny, right?

Of course, everything in this particular universe of television entertainment is a masquerade and a lie.  With a better script, and in the hands of a more competent director (which in this case was Arnold Schwarzenegger), this could have been a lighthearted and sophisticated romantic romp, with Cannon and Kristofferson unexpectedly falling in love.  Unfortunately, this train wreck of a movie turns out to be a largely boring and disappointing exercise in slapstick.  Sure, the 1945 original had its share of slapstick situations and misunderstandings, but it still pulled things off nicely without anyone embarrassing themselves.  Poor Tony Curtis, whom I've always enjoyed, was asked to mug his way through this entire remake, turning in probably the most embarrassing performance of his career.  I couldn't help but feel sorry for him.  The rest of the cast didn't fare much better, with Kristofferson typically wooden, though I still somehow came away enjoying Dyan Cannon's performance.

I really wanted to like this movie a whole lot more than I did. Honestly, the whole thing just seems tired and predictable.  And yes, I realize I'm quite familiar with the basic plot, being a fan of the original.  But this 1992 version of Christmas in Connecticut simply did not bring anything new to the table.  I guess I was expecting something fresh and funny, rather than worn out and basically tedious.  I'm not a big fan of remakes anyway, and if the truth be told, this is one that really has no good reason to exist.  Sorry, Arnold.  I've always been a big fan of your movies, but in a case such as this, you'd have been much better off leaving the directing to the pros.  Maybe if you'd had some gunfire and explosions, it would have been a bit more palatable.  Or it might have been pretty funny to have the Terminator show up at the house in Connecticut and noisily terminate all of these annoying people (except Dyan, of course) just in time for Christmas dinner! But as it is, I'm afraid this version Of CIC in my DVD collection will have to remain a one time only viewing experience.  Not totally unwatchable, but very nearly so.",1352073600,2,3231,4.720142602495543

Sadly, there are not many movies which actually relate to the True Meaning of Christmas (the birth of Christ).  However, if you are wanting a light-hearted, comedy around Christmastime, this might just be for you.  I agree with other reviewers that this is a, ""feel-good movie.""  Sometimes something like this is just what the doctor ordered to counter that holiday stress.

I was never a fan of Dyan Cannon (until this movie) nor K. Kristoferson.  I felt that Mr. Kristoferson was somewhat rigid in his portrayal of the Ranger but feel that it did not detract from the movie.  All of the other characters were absolutely delightful & funny (not belly-laugh funny but funny never the less).

FOR AMAZON:
My only real complaint about this movie is:  why is it not on Amazon Instant Video for those of us who like to buy & store the movies on our hard drives?

476334,1,6302526795,"I love Christmas movies, and any movie that has even a minor Christmas theme to it I'm going to like at least a little.  But this version of CHRISTMAS IN CONNECTICUT was a major disappointment.  It's true I'm a huge fan of the original.  But I was still prepared to enjoy this one and judge it on its own merits.  I knew it was directed by Arnold Schwarzenegger and thought perhaps - being the multi-talented man that he is - he might have done a good directing job.  But...I won't address that now.  This movie has far more important things to gripe about.

The acting in this movie is sub-par at best but mostly way over the top.  Failed attempts at comedy breaks revolve mostly around the son-in-law-to-be sporting a spiked mullet, leather jacket, and acting ambitions.  So he is always in character practicing for his next big gig (preparing to play a serial killer).  At one point he even grabs someone's shades and says (imitating the director's famous role), ""I'll be back.""  This guy soon becomes the Jar Jar Binks of this movie, and it's likely you'll cringe every time one of his scenes appears and sigh with relief when its over.

Tony Curtis's performance is very overacted as well.  And most of the film consists of bland and unauthentic ""family"" moments along with the awkward, forced romance which blossoms between Dyan Cannon and Kris Kristofferson.

This film has absolutely none of the delightful charm of the original.  There are many great Christmas movies out there.  Fortunately, there aren't that many duds.  But this is one of them.",1263513600,,1556,4.724907063197026
