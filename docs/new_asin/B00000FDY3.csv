1212688,5,B00000FDY3,This DVD is my favorite just laugh after laugh. He is so funny and keeps it moving and it never lulls.,1208736000,,102,3.9047619047619047
1212689,5,B00000FDY3,"I can't get tired of watching this dvd, I've watched it so many times now and it still makes me laugh out loud.  Earthquake is the perfect name for this brother, cause he'll have the house shaking.  I caught one of his shows at the improv this year and I don't remember laughing so hard, he put on some show, The funniest and most underrated urban comic in the business, should've been on kings of comedy.",1207872000,,405,4.315789473684211
1212690,5,B00000FDY3,I enjoyed every moment. Thought provoking as well as funny!,1175126400,4,59,5.0
1212691,4,B00000FDY3,Earthquake is one pf the top comedians right now and this DVD once again proves the man is funny. One setback is that some of the jokes are in his other DVD from platinum series but other than that it is a must if you're a fan.,1164153600,4,227,3.851063829787234
1212692,5,B00000FDY3,"I saw this years ago when it showed on HBO, it rocked. He does the BEST impressions and makes timely comedy about current events. Buy this tape and unless you have no sense of humor you will love it! Blake Clark was great too! Let's just say I was looking for a DVD when I found this tape and I WISH I could pay more to get a DVD but it wasn't available!",998611200,3,354,3.863013698630137

1212830,2,B00000FDY3,"The platinum comedy series that he did had everything this one had & more, I bought this DVD for nothing",1378339200,,104,4.25
1212831,5,B00000FDY3,"BUY THIS DVD.

Laughing-Out-Loud!

He is truly funny at his craft, and this DVD would be a great addition to any comedic collection, you may already have.",1335312000,,154,4.666666666666667
1212832,5,B00000FDY3,"Earthquake is hilarious! The 30-min show plus the extras are more than worth the price of admission. Would be nice if the extras were not edited out of the show, they'd fit right in. Very satisfied with purchase. This is just what I was looking for. Very satisfied with purchase and would recommend and do business with seller again.",1327536000,,333,4.661016949152542
1212833,3,B00000FDY3,"Don't be fooled, this video is old. Still funny just old. I thought it would be a recent video. Earthquake new stuff is funnier. It's worth the money I paid for it.",1322438400,,164,4.15625

1212836,4,B00000FDY3,"I first saw this performance of television and I said to myself, 'I have to own this.  It's one of Earth Quakes' funniest pieces.  You will stay in stitches.",1266364800,,157,4.379310344827586
1212837,3,B00000FDY3,"It is evident that HBO edited out quite a bit of this show which was quite dissapointing. I saw other parts of this exact stand-up on YouTube and unfortunately some of the funniest stuff that he said wasn't even included on the DVD! I felt a little ripped-off. At the end, I said to myself, ""this can't be it"".  But oh well. You can't win 'em all.",1256256000,3,347,4.17910447761194
