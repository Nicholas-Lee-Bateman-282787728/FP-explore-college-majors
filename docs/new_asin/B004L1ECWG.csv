8433714,2,B004L1ECWG,"I've seen quite a few documentaries about Ralph Baer online. I was hoping that there would be more to this DVD, but sadly, there isn't.

The production company that made this documentary is clearly an amateur:
- There is bad 90's weather report style music randomly interspersed over Ralph Baer's dialogue
- The Nintendo Wii is referred to as ""the Nintendo""
- The Magnavox Odyssey is referred to as the ""Odyssey Magnavox""
- In the extras section of the DVD, there are profiles of the amateur production crew. I don't care about them. Yet their bio's are there. Some are even set to music stolen from ""The Exorcist"". The photos of Ralph Baer's prototypes in the extras section are bad, low resolution jpegs. The production company visited Ralph Baer's home... yet couldn't take their own high resolution photos? The extras section also has laughable navigation buttons that get lost on some backgrounds.
- More and better details can be found in documentaries found online. The interviewer did nothing to bring any new stories to light.
- The scripting for the prologue and epilogue are also laughable bad and amateurish

Seriously, save your money and look for the many Ralph Baer interviews freely available elsewhere. There's really nothing to see here.",1459555200,,1255,4.9714285714285715
