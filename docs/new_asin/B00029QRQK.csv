8024835,5,B00029QRQK,"A truly amazing work of art, beautiful story. For English speakers, the story is very easy to follow without being able to understand the text, especially as there is not much dialogue throughout the story anyway.

Excellent service regarding postage. Prestivo let me know straight away via -mail that there had been a slight delay with the shipping of my order (especially as it was over Christmas) and then let me know what was going on the whole time there was a delay. I then received it very promptly in the mail in perfect condition.",1390089600,,539,4.673684210526316
8024836,5,B00029QRQK,"There are very few full length animation features that tackle the social issues of living under totalitarianism.  I can only think of two - this film and  ""Animal Farm""  the British cartoon from 1954. Both use animals to show the harsh nature of these social realms.  The story in the British film is easier to follow ... but ""Le Roi et l'Oiseau"" is richer in meaning.

This film is so loosely based on the Hans Christian Andersen tale, the original is unrecognizable.  The tyrant - monarch King Charles of Tachycardia uses mechanical gadgets and spies in black coats to find and quash any threat to his power.  The irony is that the ruler is actually killed by his own picture - and the picture becomes alive and turns into the same tyrant.  (The symbolism makes me think of Stalin and Mao, rulers who insisted their portraits be put up everywhere).  Two of the persons he has ordered captured are the only other characters who have magically come alive from their paintings. They are in love with each other but the King desires the woman for himself alone. Will love triumph? Can the monarchy be overthrown?

The castle of King Charles has endless chambers and trap doors...and operates as a complete city.  The animator is not only critiquing modern style communism but old style monarchy.  He would fit in quite nicely as part of the intelligentsia during the French Revolution.

Overall, the animation is brilliantly colorful and endlessly creative...with the crow (the L'oiseau) being the voice of conscience in mocking the King. As others have noted, the language is ""French Only"" as there are no subtitles.  Since the story is superbly revealed through the animation itself, it should be relatively easy to follow the narrative.

Recent animation from Pixar or Disney are far less ambitious.  For something entirely unique in the genre...I can highly recommend this offering",1368662400,,1883,4.9113924050632916
8024837,5,B00029QRQK,"Animator and actor Paul Grimault, who appeared in Vigo's 'L'Atalante' (1934), suggested to Jacques Prevert just after the last war that they tackle an adaption of the Hans Christian Andersen story The Shepherdess and The Chimneysweep. The result was a remarkably little-known (at least amongst English and American film lovers) animated feature, La Bergre et Le Ramoneur,(1952) reissued as Le Roi et L'oiseau (1979). It has also been called by the considerably more crass title 'The Curious Adventures of Mr. Wonderbird', or even the bald 'Mr Wonderbird To The Rescue', for its rare surfacings on video. The title tangle reflects the film's obscurity in the English speaking world, as well as the difficulty in categorising a work which is at once a children's film, a polemic fantasy and a uniquely French cultural piece.

Prevert, better known as the collaborator with Marcel Carne on such films as Les Enfants du paradis (1945), brought a distinctive brand of poetry and wit to the project which, in its first incarnation took six years to complete. Money problems and disagreements with the producers caused it to be issued, but with Prevert's name removed, in 1952. It was only after twenty years that Grimault was able to see the project completed to his full satisfaction, whereupon it promptly won the prestigious Louis Delluc prize.

The action takes place in the imaginary kingdom of Takicardia, ruled by the unpopular King -whimsically named `Charles V and three makes eight and eight makes 16'. The action is narrated in retrospect by the cheerful, omnipresent Mr Bird, who supports and guides the hero and heroine. King Charles (a curious mixture of Mayerling's Crown Prince Rudolf, Ben Turpin and Mussolini) is a squint eyed, conspicuously vain, autocrat who `hated everyone, and everyone hated him right back'. He is fond of shooting and capturing birds, living apparently without queen or immediate family in a labyrinthine palace.

After an abortive, shooting interlude, (Mr Bird has already shown us the grave of his wife 'killed in an unfortunate hunting accident') and a witty scene during which he confronts a nervous painter, Charles retires to his 'private and secret apartments' on his palace's 96th floor. Here he contemplates his latest portrait, and those of a chimney sweep and shepherdess already hanging there. He is in love with the image of the girl, viewing that of her painted companion with disdain. That night, while the King sleeps, all of the portraits come alive and, to avoid an impromptu marriage with the royal, the sweep and shepherdess make off. Meanwhile the King's own portrait has become animated, discovering its own love for the sweet girl. He disposes of the real king down a convenient trap door, assumes the throne and pursues the elopers with all the apparatus of the state.

The pursuit, and eventual capture of the two, is what occupies the rest of the film. Grimault sets the action amidst the passageways, steps, waterways, roofs and basements of the grand palace. Its baroque setting, with its distinctive use of perspective, recalls the paintings of Giorgio de Chirico. The design of the palace, and its roof top scenes, probably influenced the great Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki's realisation of Cagliostro's castle in his 1979 anime of the same name. For Charles' castle is a wonderful invention, characterised by floating and elevating thrones, bowler hatted policemen, huge galleries, canals, and an exotic skyline of spires, balustrades and minarets. It is also a place of danger. Trap doors open at the touch of a button, eliminating those who displease the king - another element taken over by Miyazaki, incidentally. The king also uses a robot, the machinery of repression made concrete, to pursue his love. Its lumbering yet delicate presence reminds the viewer of the metal gardeners in Miyazaki's Laputa: Castle in the Sky (1986) as well as the more recent American release Iron Giant (1999).

Prevert's script juxtaposes different values, or 'arts', and asks us to draw our own conclusions. Do we prefer the vanity and artificiality of portraiture, self-indulgent architectural follies, and grandiose self-admiration? Or the simple charm of a bird call, a blind street beggar's hurdy gurdy, the simplicity of true love? Prevert has his answer ready: he clearly values spontaneity and truth over artificiality and obsequiousness. Wojciech Kilar's superb score complements this with a lovely, plaintive piano main theme, as well as a range of parodic marches used for 'royal use'. (One especially relishes the automated band in the metal giant's chest.) Prevert's script is also concerned with the atmosphere of oppression, and the struggle for liberation. In the aftermath of the Second World War, life under The Occupation was still fresh. King Charles' secret police (who at one point develop the disconcerting ability to fly like black bats) are bumbling, but undeniably still intimidating. Takicardia may be an incompetent state, but one whose determined overthrow will reduce everything to rubble.

In the basement of the palace, where the two lovers eventually are cornered, are starving lions and a blind musician. `Does the world really exist and the sun really shine?' he asks plaintively before adding `They saw a bird - there must be hope'. In an extraordinary scene, the beasts waltz to the hurdy-gurdy man's instrument, being dissuaded from eating the chimneysweep by the power of music, before the bird's propagandistic speech raises their ire and they assist in the royal downfall. Theirs is a literal underworld. One whose muted despair and foreboding recalls Prevert's scripts for Quai des brumes (1938) or the doomed waiting of Le Jour se lve (1939), redeemed here by the power of art.

In an interview (Jeune Cinma, n 128) Grimault stressed the importance of the film as not just being for children but, in its way, as unique a work as the animations of the Americans, a radical and long lasting achievement. Viewing it today it is hard not to disagree with him, and one is glad it now appears on DVD to delight a new audience.",1337731200,2,6120,5.12012012012012
8024838,5,B00029QRQK,"Well, first, you must get the French version, as it is the best available. This film is easily the best animated I've seen in a while. The Kingdom of Tachycardia is ruled by King Charles the First plus Seven and Eight Makes Sixteenth. I'm really not kidding with that name. Either way, just get a copy. By the way, the DVD doesn't have any subtitles, but the film's Imagery really make up for that.",1325116800,,398,4.391891891891892

8024840,4,B00029QRQK,"Le Roi et l'Oiseau (King and Bird) is the achievment of a lifetime: the life of Paul Grimaud, ""The"" reference of French animation for the 20th century and still nowadays. As Disney did, many animators having contributed to Paul Grimaud's masterpiece, have produced, in the late years of the century , valuable films, including full length features (Henri Lacam, and quite recently: Jean-Franois Laguionie, Jacques Colombat for instance).

This film is remarkable to several aspects:
First of all, a maturation time of more than 30 years (1948-1978)
- a first version was released around 1952, under the title ""La bergre et le Ramoneur"" (Sheperdess and the Chimney Sweeper), realised in cooperation with the French Poet and writer Jacques Prevert, with a talented music of Wladimir Cosma.
- This first version, considered by Grimault as uncomplete, was re-authored and widened during the Seventies, with reviewed backgrounds and animation, new sequences, but in keeping the same spirit and poetry as the first issue.
Some prominant characters were introduced. For instance, a tremendous and convincing iron made gigantic Robot, as cold and impersonnal as can be, built to serve the ""villain"" of the story, namely ""King Charles V et III font VIII et VIII font XVI de Tachycardie"" (quite long, isn'it?).
Curiously, this Robot has his copycat in the Warner Bros 1999 production ""The Iron Giant"". No chance that it would be found shoking in the US, since ""Le Roi et l'Oiseau"" is - I suppose without being too risky - totally ignored in this country...
But, since even in France, one cannot say it was a commercial success, one can easily understand that US film distributors are not willing to lose money, and the american spectators are not even given the chance of seing the film. It is that simple! I hope they will have the opportunity to acquire the DVD - if released in English version ( difficult to achieve, I guess, but who knows!)
A great film:
Despite very little finance and banking support, and hampered by a totally ""non commercial"" approach by Paul Grimault, this film is, to a great extent, to be compared more than ""honorably"" with much more expensive American productions, in regard of the quality of the animation, the backgrounds and the accurate continuity of the story. Many sequences are pure jewelry, real gems! The firts 15 minutes are really paramount. My only hope is that some day, I could hear that ""Le Roi et l'Oiseau"" is at last known and appreciate in the US.

Just a final ""cons"" (after the tremendous ""pros""): the weakest part of the film is encountered in some animation sequences of 1950 where Grimault tried to animate lions, tigers ans bears like - according to european interpretation - Disney would have done!... Very poor and pityful. Grimault is not Disney (and vice-versa!). Let's forgive him, since we can find so many treasures. But I regret that it had not been improved in the Seventies and final version.
This is why, I gave a ""4 stars"" mark, instead of the deserved ""5 stars"".
