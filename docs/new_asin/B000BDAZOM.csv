8085705,4,B000BDAZOM,"A set accomplishes films produced by Werner Herzog in cooperation with Klaus Kinski:
Aguirre, Cobra Werde and Fitzcarroloo are about colonization and further development of Brazil
Woyzeck is about Chech mature mentally-disturbed soldier of the WWI
Nostratu is about vampire (sorry, this film is off my interest at all)
My best fiend is telling of K. Kinski as a person and artist and of time W.Herzog worked with him and admired him from his early years.

The doco is the most interesting in this set as psychotic performing by K. Kinski, reflecting his personal mental state, is mostly attractive for very interesting in his style, perhaps.

In general, very educative and informative as for a reviewer, stories of Latin American history.",1239580800,,739,5.099173553719008
