7167136,5,B00XC9Q1SQ,"Really good...Three generations of hurt, centered in a native american family.",1475539200,2,78,6.181818181818182

7167138,5,B00XC9Q1SQ,A ok,1474761600,,4,1.5
7167139,1,B00XC9Q1SQ,I'm embarrassed to say I watched this. I kept fast forward through scenes to get to the good part never found it. About an exceptionally dysfunctional family way too negative for me. If I want that much negativity I can read or watch the news online.,1473033600,,250,4.456521739130435
7167140,5,B00XC9Q1SQ,It feels like a True Story.,1469491200,,27,3.6666666666666665
7167141,5,B00XC9Q1SQ,I had come across this film a few weeks ago searching for new movies to watch but didn't watch it then due to not thinking it would be entertaining but boy was I wrong. I thought what the heck and short story short it is well written I felt the acting was raw and genuine and storyline definitely gets right to the point. It depicts reality for many people not just native/first nations people. Enjoyed the movie and will definitely watch it again.,1468627200,,448,4.409638554216867
7167142,3,B00XC9Q1SQ,the movie was ok,1465776000,,16,3.25
7167143,5,B00XC9Q1SQ,Must see movie.,1465171200,,15,4.333333333333333
7167144,5,B00XC9Q1SQ,"Dirty, gritty and violent. It needs to be in order to properly tell this story. I was fully drawn in to this story. It's worth watching.",1458086400,3,136,4.269230769230769
8715696,5,B00XC9Q1SQ,"If you watch the whole movie, there is a very deep message on many levels. It is kind of hard to watch the lead actress's pain, but you find out later where it is coming from, and this story actually is playing out in reality for many women, unfortunately. I am a fan of ""The Expanse"", and googled one of the actress's and stumbled onto this obscure and little known drama. Maybe not a masterpiece, but well acted and a deep message. Suffering, redemption and second chances. On a side note - Native Americans deserve a lot more respect then we have given them. I feel ashamed for our North American culture's continued lack of that basic understanding.",1530057600,,653,4.5423728813559325
8715697,5,B00XC9Q1SQ,good movie.....it just ended when I didn't expect it to.,1504396800,,56,4.7
8715698,5,B00XC9Q1SQ,Deals with complex family relationships especially between mothers and daughters.,1497830400,2,81,7.2
8715699,2,B00XC9Q1SQ,"I may try again, but I didn't like anything about this film and didn't finish.  Really didn't connect with the characters at all or care about them enough to continue on.",1492646400,,170,4.483870967741935
8715700,4,B00XC9Q1SQ,"I give this movie a 4 out of 5 stars. Its a great movie, great actresses.  Maternal storyline about a daughter, mother, and grandmother that have issues with eachother. The mocie is somewhat slow, but is still a great drama",1492473600,,223,4.575
8715701,4,B00XC9Q1SQ,Makes you think about family. You can run. Yet thats who your part of. Good..bad.,1486339200,,81,4.466666666666667
8715702,5,B00XC9Q1SQ,"I found this movie to be quite realistic even with 'B-List' actors, their emotions were real",1485129600,,92,4.8125
8715703,5,B00XC9Q1SQ,Very relatable.,1484352000,,15,7.0
8715704,4,B00XC9Q1SQ,story line could be todays. Videography was as much of the show as the show itself. entertaining but hard to watch.,1484352000,,115,4.523809523809524
8715705,3,B00XC9Q1SQ,kind of slow leaves ya hangin,1484092800,,29,4.0
