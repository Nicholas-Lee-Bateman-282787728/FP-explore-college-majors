2423957,5,B000BMCY5G,"This DVD : Lymphatic Massage for the Body is excellent. As a qualified holistic therapist this a very informative, detailed and easy to understand DVD. This is great for anyone who is just starting out in this therapy or as a refresher for someone that is already qualified or even for someone that is interested  in the subject. The demonstration is set at a good pace so you could take notes while you're watching it. I would recommend this product to anyone.",1415232000,8,461,4.621951219512195

8088959,2,B000BMCY5G,"As someone said, lots of ads in this one.  I should have listened.
I am not interested in vacuum pressure and equipment - and this is at least 1/2 of the DVD.
The part that helps me is the 'hands-on' technique although that is squeezed in the middle of the rest of it.  And, some of the techniques are shown so close up that I can't tell exactly where the massage therapist is.
It is not worth scrolling through this DVD to get to the part that is helpful.
The educational information that one could get from a book goes like the road runner (too fast) - so better to read all about lymphatic system in a book.
It feels like this is a company that wants to sell equipment, products and focuses on some kind of ""Salon"" sales.  Not my interest.
If I had seen the DVD before buying it, I would not have bought it.
The massage therapist showing technique appears nervous to begin with although I sense she knows what she is doing and I got used to her style.  The other one in the 'white doctor's coat' was reading a script and did not feel 'there' or present.
Perhaps I'm a wee bit hard in my assessment.  I would not recommend buying it.  Get from a library or watch You Tube videos instead.",1500422400,3,1189,4.215859030837004

8088962,1,B000BMCY5G,"The first half of this DVD is advertising for other products.  The actual massage part is not the best, and seems really old. YouTube has better videos for free!",1483056000,4,161,4.551724137931035

8088965,5,B000BMCY5G,"As a qualified massage therapist I wanted to add another treatment to my repertoire and this instructional DVD on how to perform a lymphatic massage did not fail to deliver. The instructors are clear, detailed and very informative throughout the demonstration of lymphatic drainage massage. The video is a step-by-step guide and covers all the basics, the benefits of the treatment and all the techniques required to perform this treatment. I recommend this DVD to any massage therapist starting out or experienced and I have very satisfied clients since offering this massage",1415404800,8,576,5.271739130434782
8088966,5,B000BMCY5G,"Lymphatic Massage is very useful to me as a therapist because I like to work with the elderly, and their immune systems can be very weak.

Going step-by-step through this DVD helped me help others. It's so rewarding to see the smiles of the elderly in hospitals, and to be able to benefit them further by using this training.

My patients feel better, look better, and perform better when I use the magnificent lymph techniques in this DVD! Words cannot describe what this product has done for me, my career, and my patients. I highly recommend it!",1415318400,7,548,4.639175257731959
