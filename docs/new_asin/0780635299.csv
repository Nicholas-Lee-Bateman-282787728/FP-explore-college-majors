36248,4,0780635299,"The effects of lacking the fortitude and conscience to make the right choices in life are examined in ""Blow,"" directed by Ted Demme and starring Johnny Depp as George Jung, a young New Englander who decides early on that living week to week and barely being able to make ends meet is not the kind of life he wants.  George grew up in the `50s, in a decent, middle-class family, but was deeply affected by the fact that his father, Fred (Ray Liotta), worked his fingers to the bone as a plumber, sometimes fourteen hours a day, seven days a week, and it was never enough, especially for his mother, Ermine (Rachel Griffiths), who complained endlessly about not having enough money.  More than once she abandoned her family, only to be taken back every time upon her return by Fred, who adored her.  Then, in the late `60s, George, along with his childhood friend, Tuna (Ethan Suplee), moved to Southern California and quickly discovered the freedom of the beaches and a lifestyle conducive to his idea of paradise.  That ""paradise"" being anchored in the realization of the big, easy money to be made at the time selling marijuana; and for George, it was only the beginning, the on-ramp to the freeway that would ultimately take him to the top of his ""profession,"" and which was destined to define his life.
 It's a tale as old as time, the lesson of which is destined forever-- unfortunately-- to be ignored by those who seek the quick and easy road to wealth and happiness.  Courage, it has been said, has many faces; one kind earns soldiers and citizens medals for rising above imminent danger.  Another can be defined as being able to decline the carrot of ill-gotten gains when it is dangled before you.  George lacked that kind of courage, and instead grabbed the promise it proffered with both hands, only to discover-- too late-- that it was empty indeed, and laced with unhappiness.  It's a classic rags-to-riches-to-oblivion story, with a moral that will be embraced by those with the wisdom to build their house of brick instead of sticks and straw.
 As George, Depp turns in a convincing, believable performance, portraying him as a misguided, rather than ""bad"" person.  You sense that George's naivete enabled him to take chances and enter an arena to which common sense would otherwise have dictated avoidance, and because of that you are able to sympathize somewhat with him.  Depp lends an innocence to the character in which you can find the kid next door, the good kid you grew up with and knew throughout your school years, and in retrospect, it would seem that George, a reasonably intelligent young man, simply made some very stupid decisions.  And, as they say, the prisons are full of those just like him.  But the most telling indication of who George really is and what he could/should have been, comes through his relationship with his father.  And it is that which becomes the very core of the story.
 As Fred Jung, Ray Liotta gives a poignant performance, presenting a very real person in a very real setting.  completely avoiding any kind of stereotype into which this character could easily have fallen, Liotta plays him with a depth that averts  sentimentality and makes the unconditional love he shows for his son entirely believable.  It's a direct and understated performance that so clearly defines the true character of the man, and it is in the scenes between Liotta and Depp that the true nature of George is revealed as well, in which you begin to understand that he was just an ordinary guy who got caught up in extraordinary circumstances of his own design.
 The supporting cast includes Penelope Cruz (Mirtha), Franka Potente (Barbara), Paul Reubens (Derek Foreal), Jordi Molla (Diego), Cliff Curtis (Escobar) and Max Perlich (Dulli).  A cautionary tale for those who allow themselves to stray from the straight and narrow, the real impact of ""Blow"" is ultimately contained in the final frame of the film.  It is a still picture of the real George Jung; and to fully realize what his life has been about, you need look no further than into the eyes of the man in that photograph.",987292800,3,4119,4.763713080168777
36249,5,0780635299,"Johnny Depp stars in a biopic about George Jung and the  rise and fall of one man's life, there is an 85 percent chance if you were doing cocaine in the 70's and early 80's you probably want to thank him because he was the force of your nickel a day drug habit.  I have to give credit to Nick Cassavetes the co-writer whose father is the great ""John Cassavetes"" Nick is on his way with this film who i thouht should have directed this film even though it is solid directing, Nick Cassavetes has a gift for bringing out the humanity in to his characters with relationships the main one that got me was George and his daughter which made the drugs and the money not real, not worth what ever the price was not to have what he lost (his heart) bottom line depp is one of the best actors of all time he has ""Buster Keaton's"" soul. Blow is not a great film but it is very good and worth watching if your sick of watching cookie cutter films ,watch blow with a open mind.",986515200,7,965,4.127659574468085

36279,2,0780635299,"An okay movie, seen it twice now. Starts off well enough but by the second half it really fizzles out and I just stop caring. To me, and this is a big problem in the movie, is that it doesn't really grab you the way it should because it doesn't go deep enough into characterization, and it doesn't really show the viewer his rise to the top. Instead It kind of glosses over potentially interesting and important things to keep the plot and timeline moving. We literally go from the 50's to the 90's in this movie. That's not a particularly easy way to tell a story, especially with many of the same actors, but you'll notice they use quite a few tricks to make it seem like a substantial amount of time has gone by. But even though it's no easy task it still tries to cram too much in and it really suffers for it. I found it tough to care about most of the characters because there's just too much going on and at the same time not enough. It just doesn't go deep enough.

The acting overall was fairly good with Depp and Liotta standing out. Penelope Cruz or whoever she is (not familiar with her) was absolutely dreadful, she was over acting like crazy. Overall I feel like if the movie had about 30 minutes added on with some tweaks to script it could've been better and more fleshed out. As it stands it's not a bad flick by any stretch of the imagination, but in the world of crime movies it would rank very low with me.",1493337600,,1426,4.2234432234432235

36281,3,0780635299,"A very mediocre movie.  An ordinary story told in an ordinary way.  If you've seen a movie about drug kingpins, you've already seen this one.

In particular, Depp's character never takes the ""downward spiral"" we expect from people who do drugs all their lives.  Yes some rubber makeup makes his face look older, but his personality never seems to change... just his luck gets worse.

Although ""based on a true story,"" I didn't fine the story very believable.  Depp (""George"") could move incredible quantities of drugs to just one person.  There must be a hell of a story as to how THAT person distributed the nation's cocaine, but that story isn't in this movie.

I recommend Blow Out or Blow Up or ""The Falcon and the Snowman"" far over this movie.",1492300800,,748,4.656488549618321

36507,4,0780635299,"Though I'm not drawn to drug dealing themed movies I watched this movie because a couple of other family members had seen it and gave me the, ""I can't believe you've never seen it"" when it came up in conversation.
They insisted that I would like it and that I should watch it; and I do like Johnny Depp so I gave it a try. I wasn't expecting to really get into it because my taste differs from what I read in the movie summary. However, I was pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed it. The fact that it is based on a true story was appealing to me as I am very interested in real crime stories made to movies. There was a good cast of main characters and good acting. George Jung (Johnny Depp) talked about what he learned and what he lost near the end of the movie which was a nice change from the attractive glitz & glamour of the drug dealing lifestyle some movies usually leave in young people's heads. I recommend watching it, even if it doesn't sound like your style. You might be surprised.",1439164800,,998,4.257894736842105

Johnny Depp gives a great performance, as do all of the cast, in this film about a guy (Depp) who gets into the cocaine business.  The storyline keeps moving along at a good pace, and it's one of those that if I see it on cable, I watch it, plus I have the DVD.  Ray Liotta plays Depp's father; he is always good.  Penelope Cruz is beautiful and plays her part extremely well.  Good action and a really good script.",1434672000,,483,4.150537634408602

After watching this I was able to find several interviews related to this story and found that most of the details were accurate, or close enough to tell the story.  This movie should be shown again on television with commentary from the central figure and from others who who were in and around the story as it happened - to clarify where the film departs from the real story.  The events here were instrumental in changing American culture and American history.  We are all different today because of the events related in this movie.",1434499200,4,694,4.702479338842975

I think Blow deserves much more from the critics and to be recognized more due to the perfect story which is based on true story, the sequence in the film is written and directed very well. Johnny Depp's acting was spectacular as usual. the ending made me feel sorry about Jung's life ""Depp"".

36702,4,0780635299,"This movie, surprisingly, had fatherhood at it's moral center.  We see Jung's childhood and how, despite the best efforts of his father (Ray Liotta), his son's life (and Jung's own opportunity to be a good father) went crazily out of control. And at the end, we are shown that involvement in the narcotics business is not compatible with fatherhood. The movie asks to be judged on that moral conclusion, even though the subject could have explored in various other directions, it only briefly touches on other themes. The morality and consequences of creating a culture of addiction is barely explored- not that I think the movie is obliged to address that, but the viewer should be aware that the subject is not explored, and was a bit disappointing in that area.  It doesn't go after big, grandiose themes of greed and betrayal like in Scarface, in part because Jung doesn't have an epic tragic end, he just fails when he tries to do some right things too late. After making moral compromises, he is unable to put anything in his life right. At least in the movie's version of the events, Jung could have started a drug war to defend his ""honor"" and status among the cocaine dealers, but instead he drops out and is punished with the consequences of doing so. It occurred to me during the film that, ironically, he might have had better opportunities of being a better father if he were a more ruthless, vengeful figure in the vicious business of drug dealing. Like real life, the moral choices are messy and untidy and not satisfying. Maybe if the film focussed more tightly on the themes of redemption and forgiveness, it would have been a great film. As it is, only a good film that still raises interesting questions, but it doesn't do much to motivate the audience to reflect.",1399161600,2,1783,4.67515923566879

It's based on a true story and interesting, although it was slow in a couple spots. It's a movie you watch and think, ""I would have done that different and got away with it"", or ""I would have quit while I was ahead and enjoyed the money"". But the movie keeps it real and shows just how dangerous it is with all the back-stabbing greed and such. It's a decent movie and the end is quite emotional imo.

George despite his search for money and possessions, understood what was important in his life. The loss of his relationship with his daughter was probably more devastating than his incarceration.

It is indeed smart, sexy, and dangerous and  I recommend it to anyone who likes true story drama movies. And also the dvd makes a fine addition to movie collectors.",1385424000,,480,4.052631578947368

For example, according to what I read, George himself later testified against ""Diego"" (i.e., Carlos Lehder).  This somewhat contradicts the movie's portrayal of George as the ever-faithful friend who never rolled on anyone (although to be fair, the movie never dealt with Diego's eventual arrest/extradition to the U.S.).  Also, per what I read, George kept dealing even after being cut out by Diego, whereas the movie shows him as going into retirement after Diego's portrayal.

36767,4,0780635299,"I have always believed, with an exception here and there, that Johnny Depp was extremely overrated as an actor. His good looks, combined with his outlandish characters, often earn him more credit than he deserves. Having watched the film, Blow, for the first time this weekend, It was very easy to see that Depp does in fact have a lot of talent, and can play more than just a Disney character with too much make-up. I though Depp was good in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, but he gives, by far, his best performance to date in Blow. For those unfamiliar with this true story, Depp plays George Jung, an American who worked for the Median Cartel and was responsible for bringing in an estimated 80% of all the cocaine in The United States, during the 70s and 80s. The story starts with his suburban upbringing and follows his rise to power and finally his fall from grace. Blow was very reminiscent of the kind of film you usually see from Leonard DiCaprio, and while he would have done a nice job in the lead, even he would be hard pressed to top the performance given by Johnny Depp. In the performance of a lifetime, Depp takes you through every aspect of this mans life with ease and really gave us a rare, inside look into Pablo Escobar's operation. He's paired with the lovely Penelope Cruz, who was a disaster playing Jung's wife. Her performance was nominated for a Razzie, as the worst female performance of the year, with good reason. Throughout the film, She's hard to understand and often times screaming like a lunatic. Her character was a very important part of Jung's life and they couldn't have done a worse job of casting. They needed a good looking Latin American woman to portray the part and Cruz was the top name at the time, but her sloppy performance really takes away from an interesting film. I found Blow to be a fascinating look into the other side of the war on drugs. Often times we only hear about what the FBI is doing, but not about the trade itself. Blow is original, cutting edge, and really a terrific film that shouldn't be missed.",1374537600,,2065,4.524064171122995

Based in the 1970's George Jung (Depp) and Tuna head out to California to find themselves in the thick of a drug infused environment. The two east coast guys find themselves in Derek Foreal's eccentric salon discussing how they want to sell pot. Eventually George Jung becomes the name to buy from at that time and expands. He eventually is selling Coke to all the people of California in the late 70's and becomes the king pin of coke in California. Based on a true story George Jung and Pablo Ecobar go through a lot of rough patches together after meeting in prison.

I found this movie to be quite entertaining. The cast is very good and work very well together. This is one of my favorite movies because it is a funny and entertaining movie. The movie itself is has a good plot and has its ups and downs. All in all a very good movie and worth the money on BluRay.",1361145600,,933,4.301136363636363

Johnny Depp is a brilliant character actor but I have never been impressed with him as a leading man.  His performance here is kinda a exception.  He shows how a basically good human being can get caught up in a whirlwind beyond his control. Greed, adventure, love and the love of the good life surface through the performance.
Paul Reubens is adept at showing Derek Foreal as a real person behind the ruthless,powerful, gay facade.
Again, never got off on Penelope Cruz, but she fit here and did a yeomanlike job.
Each and every supporting performance is without peer.

36829,4,0780635299,"Johnny Depp is excellent playing dope-dealer George Jung who despite making millions of dollars ended up penniless and in a Federal prison until 2015, plus was abandoned by his wife and daughter. While the script doesn't portray George as a hero it constantly distorts the truth. For example, early in the film, after George is busted in Chicago with 660 pounds of marijuana, he skips bail supposedly to be with his then girlfriend who allegedly was dying of cancer according to the film. Complete hogwash: she is still alive and was interviewed by the book author of Blow. Moreover, George was never ""faithful"" nor monogamous: he was continually ""shacking up"" with any girl who wanted to get high.

I give Johnny Depp credit for taking such a role because it isn't easy playing a loser without any redeemable traits. The best parts of the story are: Panama's Manny Noriega screwing George out of $30 million; George set-up by his long-time friends who previously had been arrested by the Drug Enforcement Agency; and, George in prison imagining his daughter will visit, which is reason alone to watch this movie.

36834,5,0780635299,"The film opens showing cocaine production in South America and it being smuggled via airplane.  George is shown testing the product for its authenticity and quality.

George Jung (Johnny Depp), moves to California with his friend and they meet an airline stewardess, Barbara (Franka Potente) who introduces him to the main drug dealer Derek Foreal (Paul Rubens).  They go into the drug business and they make a ton of money while learning the business of selling pot.  George is into smuggling pot big time and he opens up a ring back in Boston where they came from on the advice of a friend who says the colleges are a hot market.  They use stewardesses as mules but they sell so much they can't even carry enough with both of their suitcases full.  He becomes known as Boston George, the pot dealer.

They bypass source and go directly to Mexico to stop buying retail and to buy the drugs directly from the Mexican dealers.  He gets hooked up with the right guys finally and they start flying small planes across the border loaded with pot.  He plans on marrying Barbara but he gets caught with 660 pounds of pot and faces going to prison for 2 years. Barbara is dying of cancer and he skips bail to stay with her until she dies.  He is caught at his parent's home by the DEA after his mom turns him in and he has to serve his time.

While in prison he learns about the cocaine business......

This is an intriguing movie based on a true story.  George Jung makes over $100 million smuggling cocaine but his life is hard as he spends time in jail and his personal life is a wreck.  He is always facing betrayal from his drug partners and the life is dangerous.

This is a good movie and it is worth watching.  Johnny Depp does a great job in this movie and it is one of his best roles.  Depp just plays the cool drug dealer, even when going through customs.

36844,4,0780635299,"I saw Blow (2001) in the theater when it came out and liked it.  This movie stars the versatile Johnny Depp, who, in my opinion, is the best actor of our time.  The guy can do anything.  It also stars the stunning Penelope Cruz, Paul Reubens, and Ray Liotta, another versatile actor.

The movie is based on a true story and is about the rise and fall of cocaine dealer George Jung (Johnny Depp).  He at one time was the biggest importer of Colombian cocaine to the U.S.  His partner in crime was the extremely dangerous Pablo Escobar, the famous Colombian drug lord.  In order to achieve his remarkable feats of importing cocaine undetected, Jung had to have great courage, confidence, and determination, which he did.  He seemed to have TOO much confidence.  He paid the price when he got caught.  He gets out of prison and just repeats the very things that landed him in prison to begin with.  The guy's a total loser, one of those repeat offenders that doesn't learn his lessons.  His cocaine dealing dramatically affected the U.S. in that the supply of cocaine on the streets of the U.S. skyrocketed during the 1970s and 1980s.

Ray Liotta (Unlawful Entry, Field Of Dreams, Article 99) plays Jung's father.  Penelope Cruz (Vanilla Sky, Nine) plays Jung's wife.  Watching this movie will bring you back to the '70s and '80s.  The clothing, cars, and overall society as it was back then are portrayed accurately.  You'll also hear some rock songs from that era.

The acting is very good, especially by Depp and Cruz.

It is at least a full second out of sync with the video, making it seem almost like a cheap kung fu movie that has been dubbed in English.  And no, this isn't a problem with my equipment (PS3), which has successfully played over 100 other blu-rays without audio sync problems.",1277251200,,405,4.386666666666667

The only thing you have to keep in mind is just because it is actually based on a true story & actual events does NOT mean it is an autobiography. In other words, there are of course going to be both added events & deleted ones as well. So, if you're looking for more of a biography &/or autobiography my advice is to purchase the book. However, this is a good movie & if you can just go into it either not caring that it's not a story told verbatim/word-for-word, or if you can separate the two, (book & movie) then, I really feel almost anyone will very much enjoy this movie. Besides, if you buy it on here you can purchase a used one for close to nothing, so if you end up to hating it then you at least you haven't lost much. I say go for it.",1273276800,,829,4.0
36847,4,0780635299,"Fabulously acted and completely worth the time and money.  I loved this movie.  It's a little like the book ""Lolita"" though - you have to pay attention to realize quite how awful Jung is and infer the countless lives he has ended and ruined because of his ""WTF"" attitude to making more money than he (literally) knows what to do with.  All the actors are superb, and I was riveted throughout.  I will now go an read the book that it was based on.

Warning - spoilers follow about some of the history, though I don't think it will affect your enjoyment.

Jung comes across as a very likeable guy, and according to the real George Jung in the commentary Depp nails his portrayal to an almost scary degree.  What is also horrifying in the extras is how the director's genuine liking for the real George Jung seems to have completely removed his compassion for George's victims.  A 25 minute long, subtitled, tame, and somewhat confused documentary on the Colombian drug story does little to redress the balance.  On the commentary Jung manages to contradict and indict himself all in about 30 seconds when he actually blames the *parents* of the kids doing drugs, rather than his committed partnership with Escobar to ""invent"" cocaine for the US.  Comparisons with ""Scarface"" are inevitable and though most of the story is different, the understanding that there really are people out there like this, that they are not *too* different from the rest of us, but they have something very important that is missing, broken, or deeply corrupted is very valuable.",1272326400,,1555,4.768656716417911
36848,3,0780635299,"This starts off really well, with a guy who kind of stumbles into drug dealing and then applies his great natural talents to it with innovative audacity.  For the first half of the film, it portrays the whole hippy-to-coke era as a a kind of almost innocent frolic.  Then, once some real baddies emerge, it get really rough in the second half, leading to the downfall of a more or less good natured guy who wants to get out and raise his daughter, but cannot.  In other words, this is pretty cheaply romantic, almost making George into a feckless victim of the more ruthless players he is forced to deal with, to ever worsening betrayals.  That is what hollywood did to the story of a criminal who helped bring Escobar's cocaine into the US at horrendous cost to the society.

That being said, the film is fun to watch.  You get a feel for the 60s-80s, music, fashion, and all.  For the first hour or so, the acting is also extremely good, particularly with Depp as the young George, and tightly edited.  Once the downward slide begins, however, the film's tone becomes rushed and sloppy.  That makes the second hour boring in addition to dreary and depressing.  OK, it does become a kind of morality tale, but it is rather heavy-handed to say the least.  Finally, it is not an interesting portrayal of the drug industry.

I would recommend renting this, as you may not want to watch it over and over.",1269561600,,1401,4.515873015873016

36864,5,0780635299,"The movie Blow is based on the story of George Jung, who played a major role in the United States cocaine trade.  Certainly, the movie authentically represents the cocaine trade, and the people that Jung dealt with, but it was not as loyal to the portrayal of Jung's emotional side (i.e. his obsession with women and sex, his strange habits, and his total pleasure seeking life style). Instead, Johnny Depp portrayed the role of a good hearted man with good values who got into the business as a result of being mistreated by life events. I couldn't help but bonding with, and relating to this supposedly bad character.

Regardless of how faithful the movie depicted real life characters, I know that the moral lesson of crime and punishment was delivered through a wonderful touching acting of the entire cast.
Johnny Depp and Ray Loitta delivered an amazing performance. The scene of the old father listening to a tape of his son's voice is one of the most powerful scenes I've ever seen. The love Jung has for his daughter and his suffering because of his absence from her life was very credibly delivered by Depp and little Emma Roberts

The final scene with Depp's introspection is very touching; I still remember his voice saying:
""Through out my life, I gave pieces of my heart to people I loved, that I don't have enough of my heart to keep me living"".

I watched this movie at least 10 times since 2001 and I know it will remain one of my heart's dearest movies. Today, I made the surprising discovery on Wikipedia that Kristina Sunshine actually visited her father in jail after watching this movie. Now that the man is paying for his mistakes, it's really good to know that his daughter has decided to visit him before he dies.",1231891200,,1738,4.633116883116883
36865,5,0780635299,"""Blow"" is basically a glorification of the drug trade. Principles are shown in a glamorous light throughout most of the movie. They get all the girls and are awash in money. Even after they are arrested and confined to prison their only real crime portrayed is the loss of family life and strained relations with parents. In prison George Jung is portrayed as a counter culture icon, a wronged, flawed hero. The negative effects of the drugs upon the society as a whole are never broached. The killings, the crime, the destroyed lives, the waste are not examined. It is truly a movie about our times. A valuable movie to watch to see what has happened to our moral compass. It is another Hollywood view of the state of the union.",1230768000,,729,4.572519083969466

When I first watched blow I was blown away by the story line it's just incredible. The man of gorge Jung  who persuade happiness or though he thought. It shows how it is easy to get rich selling drugs. But the

consequences are permanent. I would encourage little kids to watch this and decide for them self ""do want two lives like this?"" It's true that money is not everything George Jung thought he had a perfect wife and the perfect life. But with selling there's always twist and turns, it would

 of bin a lot worse for George Jung. George Jung did crash on burn but he did not stop there. He tried to make things better but at the end he was set up and went to jail for the last time, for a long time. It's not easy

 to get away from cops; they will always nail you for the big stuff. This is why I encourage for kids to watch this and see what kind of destruction the life of drug dealing can cause. The movie did paid respect to the chronology of George Jung's career. George's chronology is base on his life. The movie shows a lot of respect to George and

everything he did. It show respect to Jung's fans, the movies he been on and the people he was with. Jung has respect for Blow and his cast members and the director. Once I saw Blow, when George was an undercover cop. He really got in his character and he does show a lot of respect for

 the movie. George's career might have some defining moments and significant events for his life and the movie.",1226016000,,1474,4.176678445229682
36871,4,0780635299,"This film takes a great pleasure in depicting a mediocre criminal, a drug dealer actually, who considers himself a hero, a genius and maybe even a god on earth. His initial success he analyzes as his own and does not see it is the success of a system and when he fails it's because he crossed a line somewhere: too much and too sure of himself maybe even arrogant and condescending. Then his story is a story of successive failures in between short periods of success and long periods of prison as a result of it all. He ends up betrayed by his own partners who deliver him to the FBI and DEA one night in order to get themselves out of the business clean and unharmed. Finks, that's what his friends were. But he deserved it. Then the story seems to support him on the other side of the coin: his daughter. He loses his wife and his daughter in order to go and by going to prison a first time. Then he re-conquers his daughter little by little and he promises to take her away from the squalor her mother is providing. But that's when he decides to do one more trick to get the money he needs to kidnap his own daughter. That's when he is picked up, lower than him you cannot fall, by the police and sent to prison for so long that he will never see his father alive again. So he dreams his daughter comes and visits him. But that's a dream, an illusion, a mirage. He was not able to deliver his promise and he has been discarded like an old shoe or a worn out sock. Sad but after all very moralistic. Crime does not pay and only brings deception, disappointment and suffering. Too moral maybe to be as good as it could have been. How can we support or sympathize with this selfish and arrogant p**** of a man?

coke dealer met unfortunate ends probably at the dope dealers orders or his accomplishes.  You can't be in the hard drug dealing world without
deadly violence.
But we don't see any of this. In fact a early character is said just to vanish.  Yes. well most likely jung had him killed.  When the late coke addict director of this movie ( he died overdosing on coke) wanted to tell Jungs story he presented a much kinder version of reality than existed.  A true bloody tale would have been more accurate and entertaining but director instead tells us a version of drug dealing that is like a fairy tale in some ways.  That's nothing new for hollywood.
Many biographies are so whitewashed that the real person would be amazed that this person on screen is supposed to be him!.  The reality though is that coke and it's children have laid waste to millions of lives and to make a movie that doesn't show this destruction is rather strange. But then the director was a coke addict.  he's dead and long after the real jung is dead the damage he did to the world will be with us. still the movie is entertaining because it has good sctors in it. The blu ray looks great too.",1222732800,2,1303,4.395833333333333

I skimmed the info, but mostly purchased the film based upon the cover shot.  When I watched the film, I felt my self drawn deeper and deeper into the story.  The initial interest in Penlope Cruz subsided, as I became more an more interested in the escalating business practices of our hero played by Johnny Depp.

I was rooting for our Business man, throughout the film, and I think he got the shaft.  I loved the movie until the end, but they were working with biographical material so they closed the story as best they could.

Suffice to say, this guy is no Scarface; he is just an entrepreneur who enjoys living it up.  I think the guy should have made friends in Congress, so that he could have ended his run and kept his fancy homes, et al.  C'est la vie.",1206144000,,837,4.292993630573249

36882,2,0780635299,"As George Jung, Johnny Depp dons long blonde hair, a Boston accent and dark glasses. He portrays a man, who fearing poverty as a boy, makes all the wrong choices in obtaining wealth - first as a marijuana importer and finally as the kingpin in the rise of the cocaine empire.  Because he is a decent sort of fellow, not a monster, he is ousted by his Latin American contacts and winds up three times in prison, where he remains today, serving a sixty year sentence, until his planned release in 2015.

It isn't until 42 minutes into the two hour film that cocaine even enters the picture (suggested by his cell mate during his first stay in prison, once he learns of George's marijuana empire). Jordi Molla as the cell mate, Diego, delivers the best performance in the film. He is riveting in all of his guises as friend, confidante, opportunity provider, and ultimate betrayer.  Equally good in support are Rachel Griffiths as George's loud mouthed, bitter mother and Ray Liotta as his long loving and long suffering father - a poignant betrayal.

Unfortunately, the film has little value other than providing a history lesson in the rise of cocaine as an underworld marketing empire.  TRAFFIC is an interesting companion film to see.  Depp is most affecting in his last scenes, now sporting a paunch and dirty long hair, delusionally expecting his daughter's visit, an event which never occurs.

The problem with the film in my opinion is that it lacks tension - it is too matter of fact.  We never see George's ambition - he is always too calm about everything that happens to him, good and bad.  We care about him but we don't engage with his character.  It is a marketing lie to show Penelope Cruz as his co-star. She doesn't appear in the film until the second half and then only in a few scenes as his second wife, a foul-mouthed five letter word.

To sum up, it's a valuable history lesson but not great film.",1194739200,3,1917,4.592375366568915

Really, I'm surprised more people didn't love this one. How many more winning attributes can a film possess? It's based a true story about famous people with tons of action and great characters. Depp, of course, was superb, but Jordi Malla as Diego (really Carlos Lehder) is almost as good. The scenes of Escobar stood out as well. I would place this one in my second tier of mafia/action movies.",1188691200,,551,4.257142857142857
36886,5,0780635299,"What George Jung did was illegal.  But why George Jung did it, is really and truly an inspiration!

George Jung vowed never to be poor, and he would do whatever it took to make sure that he (and eventually his family) had the best life they possibly could.  Sadly, Jung suffered the consequences after being caught, and ineveitably lost more than his money and freedom.  It is this that makes the story of George Jung so riveting and true to the heart.

He did what every red-blooded American wanted to do, make money without really having to work to make it.  Is there anything wrong with that?  No.  Dis he get caught?  Yes.  Was he man enough to stand there and take the punishment?  Absolutely.  Jung may have sacrificed quite a bit, but he did it all, not for him, but for his family; for his daughter.  For that alone, George Jung is really an American hero.

Johnny Depp has always been my favorite actor, because of his versatility and ability to make you believe that he ""is"" the character.  No surprise here that Depp puts on a stunning portrayel of Jung!  Also, I'm really not a fan of Paul Ruebens, but his character Derek was amazingly funny, as well as true.

The rest of the cast was also just as solid.  Ray Liotta, Rachel Griffiths, and of course Penelope Cruz, all do wonderful and spot-on jobs as their characters!  The directing in this film is also a top-notch acheivement and stands alone as a historical mark.

This film ranks right up there with ""Goodfellas"" for me as one to become (or may already be) a classic!  I urge anyone to at least rent this movie, and see why (I believe) George Jung is a great man!",1187308800,,1633,4.430976430976431
36887,4,0780635299,"Every time I watch one of those prison documentaries, the same question comes to my mind: How could someone keep committing crimes, knowing they're going back to prison again and again? Having watched *Blow,* I now know the answer: It just sort of happens.

George Jung as played by Johnny Depp has a wheeler-dealer mentality--always out for the next score; getting high on risk-taking; willing to walk into situations that could go seriously wrong at any moment, and roll with whatever happens. How could a guy like that put in his 8 a day at a regular job and be satisfied? Even though George gets ""out"" of the business periodically, he's only really happy when he's in. It's like his life in the drug business was technicolor and he's trying to live in black and white. Not gonna work.

The characters in the film are pretty one-dimensional, which is fine because the movie is really about the story, not the people in it. The only casting I didn't like was Penelope Cruz as George's Colombian wife. I didn't find her character very believable at the beginning; however, she does work out better later on in the movie as the worn-down, disgusted single mom stretching everything to the limit just trying to keep her and her daughter's life together.

As far as things to watch out for, there is a lot of swearing, violence, and drug use, which makes sense given the subject matter. Also, if you just quit smoking you might want to wait a few weeks before watching this one as all the characters seem to be puffing on cigs 24/7. But do watch the movie, because it grabs you from the word go and keeps you fascinated the rest of the way, even though you basically know how it's going to turn out. It's also one you can watch more than once or twice, so worth the money to get the DVD.",1185753600,3,1785,4.503086419753086

36889,2,0780635299,"I bought this the other day on a whim at a garage sale.

First off, a technical matter:  where the hell is the closed captioning on this DVD?  I have a hard time understanding what's being said unless I can also read someone's lips.  On a 14"" TV, that's not always possible.  Thus, I appreciate closed captioning. I am sure deaf people do too.  This is the first DVD I've seen in a long time that does not include it in the standard features, or if it does, I sure as hell couldn't find it.

Second, the movie itself:  at a certain point I lost all sympathy for George Jung.  You can root for a small-time pot dealer who is in cahoots with a stewardess to smuggle marijuana cross-country.  Even as his greed gets the best of him, nobody's getting killed, nobody's dying of overdoses.  But it's hard to have much sympathy for a character who works for a drug lord who shot a man in cold blood at the ""job interview.""

Jung knew firsthand the damage cocaine was doing to his friends' and wife's health.  He saw with his own eyes the damage it was doing to innocent people in Columbia.  He wasn't just an addict without the willpower to stop himself from doing another line.  He was running the largest drug-smuggling ring in the country.

Boo hoo.  He lost his daughter's trust when he didn't show up to take her to California.  That trip wasn't meant to make Kristina Jung happy, it was to prove to himself that he was at heart a good dad.

This is one of those movies that irritates me precisely because it could have been excellent.  I don't mean that it should have become an anti-drug screed (few things are more tiresome than those), but it could have been vastly improved by the director and screenwriter having more emotional distance from Jung.  The problem is not that Jung believes the things he tells himself about himself, it is that Ted Demme does too.

Also, I have yet to see a movie with Penelope Cruz in it in which she does not completely annoy me.",1181520000,,1965,4.3850415512465375

36892,5,0780635299,"I have to admit I passed this one by for quite a few months at Blockhead. I was intrigued by the stars, put off by the topic... until I read further into it and discovered this movie was not some drug culture self-glorification eulogy. And then I discovered it was about George Jung, the real life character who introduced Columbian cocaine so devastatingly onto the American drug scene. Rather than repeat the synopsis already presented in the Editorial Reviews, I'll just comment on the things that struck me most poignantly in the film.

1) If ever a young man was influenced by his mother's faults, George Jung was he. George had the same personality as his father--hard working, good hearted, and loyal. But the father was condemned to a life of poverty, damned by his refusal to leave a losing plumbing & heating business. ""Without us, people would freeze to death!"" The mother, I believe, knew in advance that the father would never be a financial success, and that is exactly why she married him. As long as he was around never earning quite enough to satisfy her, she had a crutch, her eternal 'but-for.' ""But for that loser, I coulda had a nice house. But for that bum, I coulda had new drapes."" This sick, symbiotic relationship did a lot of damage to young George. When he was growing up he did not have access to the pop psychology books that could have alerted him to the debilitating scripts that his parents wrote for themselves. The precise damage done to young George was in convincing him that adequate money could cure any shortcoming life might saddle him with. And that shortcoming leads me to Point 2, George's monster-wife-from-hell, Mirtha, beautifully rendered by Penelope Cruz.

2) In marrying Mirtha, George married his mother. George was the modern day equivalent of the Greek tragic hero, Oedipus. The only difference was that where Mom needed a nice brownstone to wow the neighbors, Mirtha needed a nice palace--Versailles will do--to wow the jet-set. When George stumbled, and both the Jung men were genetically programmed to stumble, Mirtha, the monster wife, was there to rub his nose in it right on cue. Did you happen to pick up on the first two times George got busted? He was ratted out by first his mom, then by Mirtha. His mom did it not because she thought he was doing something wrong, but because she had to regain her stature in the community. After all, everyone already knew about George's drug doings, so what better way to shut the neighbors up when George came home for an illicit visit than to dial 9-1-1? However, when Mirtha did it, it was out of pure meanness. She was mad and she had to take it out on George.

3) George was basically a good man in spite of his misplaced business focus, and that goodness was also his fatal flaw. George was loyal to a fault, not a good quality in an industry plagued by disloyalty. He'd been ratted out by his mother and his wife, so it stands to reason that the third time George got busted was when his closest, lifelong friends set him up with the feds. Where's the honor among thieves? Perhaps there never was any.

36895,4,0780635299,"In BLOW, Johnny Depp gives us one of his earlier but no less brilliant performances as George Jung, the premier American cocaine importer of the 1980s.

A film heavily influenced by Scorsese's GOODFELLAS and CASINO, BLOW is as frenetic as its namesake drug. We watch Jung grow up in a stressful household with a shrewish mother (Rachel Griffiths) and an easygoing father (Ray Liotta); Ms. Griffiths' characterization as Ermine Jung is so reminiscent of Lorraine Bracco as Karen Hill in GOODFELLAS that I initially confused the two actresses. Liotta of course, played Henry Hill.

George flees his childhood home for the endless sunshine of Southern California circa 1967, where, dedicated to the proposition that he will never be poor, he begins to deal drugs. A minor pot bust leads to an association with Pablo Escobar's Medellin Cartel, and George soon builds his small-scale operation into the major North American llello pipeline.

His vast wealth (literally hundreds of millions of dollars over the years) leads to the predictable vast excesses (think Tony Montana in SCARFACE) and George's hedonistic lifestyle comes crashing down in a white cloud of confusion, betrayal and self-destruction. Depp captures it all perfectly, without caricaturing any of it, an impressive accomplishment when one considers how easily the Cocaine Universe lent itself to cartoonishness in the mid-Eighties. George Jung ultimately was convicted of smuggling and was sentenced to a horrifying sixty years.

Despite George's Colombian connections, he remained a small-town American boy at heart, and Depp deftly and subtlely demonstrates to us George's increasing sense of isolation and disorientation in the midst of the drug culture. In the end, George Jung is left nothing but his sense of aching emptiness as he pines for his daughter Kristina, who, the film tells us as it ends, has never visited her father.

George Jung is seen in the Special Features as a broken, sad and lonely man, condemned to spending most of the rest of his life behind bars. The hardest blow fell on George Jung. Was it worth it?",1170028800,2,2095,5.168141592920354
36896,4,0780635299,"Depp always commit full heartedly to his performances and this film is no exception.  His near flawless performance as the very unlikeable George Jung, for me, is jaw-dropping as it is aspiring.  There is no real point to this story other to just let us peek inside the life of a man who establish the cocaine trade in America.  The director is careful to keep you at arms length while adding subtle touches to humanize Jung.  The best way to do that with an American audience is to throw in a sad looking kid.  We're suckers for children.

Maybe the message is: If you're not careful, you too can make a career out of bad choices or maybe it's just fun to watch Johnny Depp do his thing.",1169856000,,688,4.3359375

36901,4,0780635299,"Blow portrays the life and times of one George Jung, a real-life drug dealer currently serving a long prison sentence and not eligible for parole until 2015.  Ted Demme presents Jung's life as a series of montages, growing up in Massashusetts son of a hard-working man and a shrewish wife, moving to California with a childhood friend and becoming immersed in the marijuana trade, serving a stint in jail and meeting a Columbian who introduces him to cocaine, working his way up in Pablo Escobar's Medellin cartel and making more money than he can spend, betrayal by his colleagues and leaving the business, busted again with large amounts of cocaine in his house during his 38th birthday party, out of jail making amends with his daughter, doing one last job so he can retire to California with his daughter, getting busted yet again and sentenced to 60 years.  It's hard to tell how much of the stroy is real and how much is a product of George Jung's imagination, but in the end Demme had no choice but to trust Jung's portrayal of his life.  To Demme's credit (and maybe Jung's) the movie doesn't deify Jung's life.  He made his decisions for whatever reasons good or bad.  We can guess what his motivations were, and decide whatever we want to about his decisions.  In the end, Jung's life is yet another largely wasted by drugs.  Whatever your opinions are on drugs, this movie's portrayal of Jung's life is largely neutral on the political questions.  That's one reason I rate it so highly.  It doesn't glamorize drugs, nor does it make any judgements on the penalties that Jung ends up getting because of his involvement in the drug trade.

George Jung is played masterfully by Johnny Depp.  Is there any question who is the best actor of his generation?  Depp is brilliant in this movie.  Ray Liotta is superb as Depp's father as well.  The rest of the cast was good except for Penelope Cruz's incoherent portrayal of George Jung's drug addled wife.

The movie covers a lot of ground and lacks some of the detail you might expect because of it.  But it's a well made, thoughtful and haunting movie that will stick with me for awhile.

I definitely recommend this one if you are looking for something a little different than your average Hollywood fare.",1160956800,3,2261,4.66919191919192
36902,4,0780635299,"This film is far from perfect but it certainly is a time capsule of the 70's annd 80's growth of cocaine culture in the US and the story of one man who played a key role in it's spread. Johnny Depp is fabulous in the lead role as George Jung and the supporting cast is solid, with the possible exception of Penelope Cruz who is ok but probably the weakest performer in the movie.

The story follows the unlikely rise of a middle class kid from the east coast who moves to California in 1968 and begins to make easy money dealing pot. The growing drug culture coincides with his meteroric rise and incredible wealth. Like all morality tales the guy falls just as quickly as he rose and winds up with shattered family relationships and in prison.

Well written and plotted, the film moves briskly through 2 decades of George Jung's life without feeling choppy and the story is always intriguing.",1158537600,2,893,4.506172839506172
36903,5,0780635299,"This is one of my all time favorite movies.  Why would a movie about a notorious American drug dealer be one of my favorites? Simple: the filmakers manage to make you feel sympathetic for George Jung and that, to me, is pretty amazing.  Here's a guy who's wrecked millions of lives by distributing and selling cocaine over many years(inbetween prison stints) and 'we' manage to feel sorry for the guy.  One example would be the scene where George talks to his wife over the prison phones.  She drops the phone, walks away and his young daughter appears standing in the back looking at him.  He talks to his daughter, who is angry at him, and after she walks away, George looks up at his wife and violently hits the phone against the glass.  Very moving scene... but remember we are talking about a DRUG DEALER(!). Depp is incredible in this, the way he makes you feel sorry for his character, who wants to spend time with his young daughter and manages to keep breaking promises to her.  But ultimately it's himself that did him in and he ends up right where he belongs.  Prison.  I think years down the line Depp will be recognized for this film, not to mention Paul 'Pee Wee Herman' Ruebens and Ray Liotta.  Great movie, not so great human beings(in the movie).  How ironic that the director of this movie died of a drug overdose.  That in itself is pretty sad.  Great bonus features-one of the best I've seen on a DVD.  Any Depp fans MUST by this.  You won't be sorry, not even for a second.",1154131200,,1494,4.4411764705882355
36904,4,0780635299,"This is one of those movies that had no immediate appeal to me and I never planned on seeing it. Then one day I find myself watching it and being riveted by the story and Johnny Depp's performance.

Depp plays George Jung who according to the film hooked up with Pablo Escobar and the Colombia drug cartel to bring cocaine into the U.S. Jung was responsible for the cocaine explosion in the 70s and 80s by providing a better product than had been available before. Jung makes millions, gets married to a crazy latin woman played by Penelope Cruz and is living (no pun intended) the high life.

Eventually there are plenty of betrayals and paranoia and Jung gets out of the business and tries to live a normal life with his wife and daughter. But when he needs money he goes back to the only thing he knows, smuggling coke which leads to several arrests, the last with a sentence of 60 years.

I guess part of the reason that movies like this are fascinating is that you know there are people like Jung out there doing these things, but its enlightening when you get to see how they did it and the effect it had on their lives. Jung is portrayed in the film as a decent guy who loves his daughter deeply but who can't stop making stupid decisions that ruin his life.

The performances are very good throughout and the movie moves along at a brisk pace until the last act when it slows some.",1153008000,,1389,4.351351351351352

36906,5,0780635299,"Well, I have to say first, I was sad to hear that the director of this movie had passed.  I don't know the exact circumstances of his demise, but suffice it to say, he'll be missed.

This is one of only 10-15 movies I've seen in the theater over the last 5 years.  I pretty much stopped going to the movie theater, and enjoy saving lots of money, while still getting complete enjoyment from DVD viewing on my wide screen HD television.

However, I'm very glad that I chose to see this one in the theater.  It was definitely worth the effort.

Re-watching this movie multiple times, and enjoying the DVD extras really is quite a treat.  I like DVD's that include lots of extras, and this movie certainly is one of them.  And if you're wondering why my title centers on the Director, it is from viewing the extras.  You really can tell what a caring person he is, watching him interact with the cast and crew, and especially the actual person the movie is about.

You get to experience what a crazed and varied life Jung lived through the eyes of the director in the movie, and than again, from his words and video on the bonus features.

Great movie!  Highly recommended.

He should have gotten Oscar consideration for this part. You also have excellent performances from other actors such as Jordi Molla, Ray Liotta, and Penelope Cruz.

36909,5,0780635299,"George Jung is not your typical drug lord.  And Blow is not your typical drug-bust movie.  This film neither glorifies nor criticizes drugs; it simply shows you the rise and fall of a drug lord's empire.  Although it still condones the idea that ""if you deal drugs, it won't end well,"" you can't help but like George Jung, the main character.

 Based on a true story, Blow tells the story of George Jung, an American boy born into a middle-class family in the 70's with dreams of breaking away from the blue-collar struggle.  George, played by Johnny Depp, and his accomplice/best friend, Tuna, begin their adventure by smuggling large amounts of marijuana from the west coast to the east coast.  After doing time for a bust in Chicago, George elevates his ambitions to smuggling cocaine into hijacked airplanes across the border of Mexico.  In fact, he acted as an innovator by introducing America to Columbian cocaine.  He became a legendary cocaine kingpin, climbing his way to the top.  In his venture for fortune, Jung is faced with decisions that will inevitably result in his ruin.

At the end of the movie, you are left to wonder if the protagonist, Jung, is a criminal or a hero?  Although Jung made poor decisions, and he must face the music, you're left with the feeling of regret and sympathy for him.  In many ways, Jung was simply trying to live the American dream-rising from poverty to fortune. Jung was a businessman, merely pushing a product that the era welcomed with open arms.  To quote the real George Jung himself, ""I felt that there was nothing wrong with what I was doing because I was supplying a product to people that wanted it and it was accepted.""  It really makes you question the morality of Jung.  The events that seemed the most ""wrong"" were not that of his drug trafficking, but that of his friends, partners, mother, and wife betraying him throughout his life. Drugs are peripheral in this movie.  I feel that Jung lost himself in the wealth and power that the world of cocaine introduced him to.  His ambitions blinded him from the important things in life, such as his daughter.  He simply went too far.  Perhaps it was not the drugs he was addicted to, but rather, the prosperity of his drug career.

The supporting characters were complex and intriguing, making the film more real.  George's father, a hard-working and devoted man, stands by George in his ups and downs, despite the fact that he disagrees with his son's career choice.  George's money-driven mother seems like no match for his father.  The woman George eventually marries, Mirtha, is a replica of his mother.  She is a crazed, money-hungry firecracker, responsible for one of his arrests.  In fact, there is a scene in the movie where George and Mirtha are fighting in front of their daughter that mirrors that of a fight his parents had in front of him.  His friends start out as likable characters.  Tuna, his lifelong friend, remains true to George, but eventually fades into the wild lifestyle.  Diego, Derek, and Pablo all seem like loyal partners at first, but they all eventually betray him.  It is because of them that his final bust took place, putting him in prison for 60 years.  These characters, especially Diego, are the type of conniving criminals who come to mind when you think of ""drug dealers,"" not Jung.

At the end of the film, you are left to question the moral of the story.  By portraying the life of George Jung is the filmmaker inadvertently saying, ""if you deal drugs, this is what happens?""  It seems doubtful considering Ted Demme, the director, died of drug overdose shortly after his film was released.  However, I think the old saying holds true for this movie.  The bigger you are, the harder you fall.  As Jung said, ""Sometimes you're flush and sometimes you're bust, and when you're up, it's never as good as it seems, and when you're down, you never think you'll be up again, but life goes on.""",1128384000,5,3937,4.694890510948905
36910,4,0780635299,"If you're looking for a moral from Blow, it's ""dealing hard drugs never ends well."" Not exactly the Dalai Lama at his finest.

But if you're looking for an interesting story, movie and DVD, you might find this quite satisfying.

The story is pretty simple. George Jung, deciding he didn't want to rerun the woes of his father, whom he loves, leaves home and winds up in the drug dealing business. He graduates from marijuana to cocaine and becomes a major league cocaine dealer, a move that dictates the course of his later life.

Johnny Depp as George, Ray Liotta and Rachel Griffiths as his parents are excellent. Penelope Cruz's character is annoying, but what's worse is so is Penelope. By the end, she truly reminded me of a chihuahua.

Demme gave the scenes in each period of this tale, which goes from the 1950s through the 1990s, the texture identified with that time period. For example, in the late 1960s California scenes, you feel like you're watching the outtakes from Pepsi ads from the era.

The DVD extras, besides the commentaries, include interviews with the real George Jung; a documentary on the Colombian drug trade; and the infnifilm feature, which lets you click onto deleted scenes when the spots they would've been in come up in the movie, but click on ""interviews"" with the characters (pretty fun).

36912,5,0780635299,"I checked the program guide, and saw that BLOW starring johnny depp and peleope cruz, only got 2 stars from critics and i know why. Because they don't want to make it sound like George Blung was some kind of a hero. But it deserved at least 3 stars, because of the excellent acting, and cast, and the way the biopic was written captured the sadness of the true story, and focused on what drugs do to a person's life, and how drug dealig is a path you never want to go down. I think that this guy wasn't a bad guy, and the only reason he got a harsh sentence in the end is because of the 3 strikes you're out. After being in and out of jail he continued to pursue his drug dealing ""career"" because in a way it's as addicting as drugs can be. And that's all he knew. After stopping the ""business"" he only went back to get money for his daughter, so he can see her and take her to california because that was the agreement he made with mirtha his ex wife. So the ending to me was very sad. And i don't understand why he said at the end that he would do it all over again if he had a second chance, that did defeat alot of things that the movie had suceededly made clear about that kind of life will never end with anything good. It's like stealing, it gets addicting after the first time you get away with it. Getting caught, the possibility, gives you a rush of adrealine. Like drug dealing, getting all that money. I mean come on george had 60 million bucks, and he still kept at it, and didn't want his partner to have his california connection source. It's the addiction of the drug dealing. It had to take him getting beat up and betrayed by his partner, to realize he should stop, and then he went broke, and wanted to do one final retirement score, and that happened to be THE bust, and sting set up by the fbi. But anyways, i think depp was fantastic in this film, and it's very entertaining i especially liked the cuban guy, who was depp's drug dealing partner. What a great great actor he is, and who could forget pee wee herman, hehe. Also did an excellent job. And last but not least, penelope cruz who is so beautiful and such a great actress did her part well as usual.

36913,4,0780635299,"When I think of Ray Liotta,I  think of the smiling Henry from Goodfellas. I think of a guy with a life full of youth no matter how old he is. In Blow, Liotta plays father to a kid (Johnny Depp) ""George"" and husband to a nagging wife. Liotta played his character with a lot of conviction. It was sad to see an old man listening to a tape recorded by his son. It was also sad to see him play his role as well as he did. To his son, he's the strongest man on earth. His character was extremely well painted & I don't think they could have possibly done any more justice to him.

When I would think of Depp, I would think of Edwards Scissorhands. He plays George in this movie and almost every scene in Blow revolves around him. I must say I liked his introduction to the film. This movie is about a kid who grows up watching his mom leave his dad every now and then. They would quarell over money matters and he wished at that time he never was like them. He also decides to never be poor no matter what may come his way.

I never thought Penelope Cruz (was almost in love with her) could play the role of a whiny wife as well as she did in Blow. She was good as she managed to make me grind my teeth each time she spoke harshly to George Jung in the prison. I also liked the fiance stealing scenes.

Some of the high points of the movie came towards the end. Most films like to conclude with an endnig of dire sorts. Blow has a tragic yet believable ending. Depp became what he hates and it's quite amusing to see him realise at the same time he's lived the life of a man who's ambitions exceed his talent. Yes,I thought the film was about Cocaine but no! it's about the wrong steps a man takes in his life. Another heartbreaking scene was Depp acknowledging the fact that his dad (Liotta) was always right at the age of 42. Money is nothing.

Pardon me for the random takes but it's not easy writing a review for Blow. It made me smile and it made me sad but on the whole it was a bit of a lesson in it's own way. Blow had a good ending(appropriate)I would recommend Blow to everyone who doesn't like over mushy endings and for those to whom reality matters.

Excellent direction and good screenplay.

36915,3,0780635299,"What I liked about 'Blow' was the intersection of protagonist George Jung's life with kingpins like Pablo Escobar.  These events help put into perspective the dangerous game that Jung was playing.  The introduction of Escobar into the tale (and what an intro) is meant to show the Johnny Depp's character has crossed a threshold from lifetyle choice into serious nacrotrafficking.

What's strange about 'Blow' is some of the casting choices.  The late Ted Demme obviously liked to go against the grain.  I can respect that.  The Johnny Depp of 2000 was known for his risky role-taking, so having him carry the lead isn't a problem (and, as a native Bostonian, I think he put on a fairly credible Massachusetts accent...certainly light-years better than Laura Linney's savage botch job in 'Mystic River'). And, Jordi Moll&agrave; is outstanding as he is everything he does.

But Kiwi Cliff Curtis (of subsequent 'Whale Rider' fame) as Escobar?  Maori...Antioquian...what's the difference.  What an odd choice.

Likewise, getting me to buy off on Ray Liotta as Depp's father (eight years in age difference between the two) was a stretch.  Liotta looked 45 throughout the film (his age at the time), regardless of the amount he spent in the make-up trailer.

And, 'Blow' was another in a string of movies from that period (along with 'Woman on Top,' 'All the Pretty Horses' and 'Vanilla Sky') designed in part to force-feed Penelope Cruz down the throats of the American public and make her a bankable Hollywood star.

But, it's a good thing he and most other criminals do; otherwise, how would the cops ever catch them?

In Blow, we learn the mindset of a young person who wants everything handed to him. Jung decides to take the ""easy way"" to riches and it worked for a very brief, fleeting moment.

He had it all. A nice looking babe, cars, mansion, and money. Trouble is he got it all illegally and there's no way you can get away with that kind of life style very long before the Cops come and kick in your door; especially if you're snorting your own product.

Like I said, let's be grateful Mr. Jung wasn't more careful. If he were, America's drug problem might be even worse than what it is now.

36922,5,0780635299,"""Blow"" is the kind of movie about drugs I can respect in one sense: it neither glorifies it nor condemns it, does not for one second pull a DARE moment on us, and yet allows us to see the essentially destructive nature of the indisputable scumbag George Jung's lifestyle.

Johnny Depp did a great job portraying Jung, and I'm sure if Jung had somehow slipped out of his cell and played himself the movie would have gone nowhere--keep in mind while watching Jung go from being a twenty year old with money on the brain to middle aged wreck, to the ultimate b**ch, that this is JOHNNY DEPP, not George Jung.  I'm sure it was quite a bit less glamorous and charming in actuality.

Jung was moving weight.  Serious weight.  Weight enough to get him screwed over by his equally strung out friends and land in jail till 2014.  He had his good times, but they were all predicated on fear and paranoia: you can practically sense the impending doom from every wonderfully hedonistic moment in this film.

Ray Liotta, as Jung's father is touching.  His subtlety and seemingly endless empathy for Jung's skewed plight in life strikes a moving contrast to his mother, who after awhile simply wants nothing to do with Jung.  He sticks (in a sense) with Depp's Jung right till the very end.  The last few scenes are chilling and disturbing:Jung is betrayed by his friends in a cinematic moment few will forget.

My only problem with this movie is that it generates actually sympathy for George Jung as a man (the last picture of him flashed as Depp is hallucinating that his daughter is speaking with him is grotesque and shows the very real nature of the toll the use and decades of hustling took on him) and one wonders if this is appropriate at all.  I tend to doubt that Jung cared that much about his daughter.  If he did, maybe he wouldn't have wasted the best years of his life slinging coke.  Plus, no major drugdealer would ever behave like this.  During the course of the movie he is screwed over a billion times by just about everyone and seems pretty friendly about it afterwards.  If Jung in fact conducted his ""business"" this way,

he was either really looped out on his own product or simply a stupid kid who was in the right time at the right place to sell tons of cocaine and had no basic idea of what he was doing.

This movie is a work of art, though, for all the moral ambiguity involved.  Penelope Cruz is a delight to watch as his really nutty temporary wife.  However it may be judged ethically, this is better than ""Traffic"" or ""Requiem For a Dream"".",1098230400,5,2560,4.476293103448276
36923,4,0780635299,"For the movie Blow, the old saying holds true:  The higher you go, the further you can fall. George Jung was the typical American, wanting nothing more but to get rich quick.  The dramatic sequence of events summarized the history of cocaine in America and the biography of George Jung (Johnny Depp), largest American drug lord in the late 70's and early 80's.  The drama just sucks you in filled with disappointment, lies, betrayal, deceit, money and drugs, the essentials that made Blow so well directed.

 The main thing that makes this movie so interesting is the reality of it all.  A lot of it is twisted a bit by Hollywood, but you can't help but watch in awe that this happened.  This man was responsible for the drug of choice by the rich and famous three decades ago.  If you bought cocaine in the late 70's, early 80's, chances are you got it from him.  Jung trafficked more than  of all cocaine that circulated America.  This documentary leaves you stunned, keeping you tuned for was happens next.

 It started off like most that spend their life, striving for prosperity. That's about the only connection I can make to my real life.  His father didn't provide enough money for the family though he worked hard at it.  Then you had the dissatisfied mother.  George never wanted to be like that, so he took the fastest way to wealth.  He started small time with marijuana on the California coast.  Through that he found people to help with his smuggling operations.  The story bases on his many mistakes that imprisoned him from time to time.  That only gave him an outlet to bigger and better crimes.

 Throughout the movie you're not sure whether you feel bad for the man, or whether he was simply not careful enough.  For example, the one scene where his wife, Mirtha, purposely gets him arrested ironically gives you remorse.  The director did a great job with the importance of money.  Money is such a big theme all the way through.  Millions of dollars are presented in your face to make a huge impact of what George has gained, yet what he could lose.  It's basically how the small town kid made 100 million dollars and lost it all.

 As far as acting goes, again Johnny Depp stars in another great movie.  Penelope Cruz co-stars as his flamboyant, deceitful wife, Mirtha.  The characters they act are artificial to each other, bringing the main point across.  Realistically, the tie between them was only of money.  When the money was gone instantly, so were they, showing how unhealthy their lifestyles were based on.

Like they say, more money, more problems.  Blow focuses on the dramatic aspects more than anything.  There's a little comedy and a little action with gunplay but that's it.  They don't take much distraction from the drama.  It makes the movie seem about an hour longer than it really is because of all the problems.  Jung lost his money, his family, his business, he lost it all.  The film puts out a heavy message about what you can lose.

There are few movies that get me as emotionally connected to the characters as this movie did. I knew from the beginning that, after earning tons of money from drug smuggling, he was going to fall hard.

The movie takes a unexpected turn towards the middle, where instead of the fun partying, or negotiating with columbian drug lords, it is more about his relationship with his daughter, and his relationship with his father.

36927,4,0780635299,"I rated this movie 5 stars, until I got a load of the DVD extras.  These extras actually serve to drag down the enjoyment of the movie.  First, there are the ""character outtakes"" whatever that term is supposed to mean.  These consist of various characters being interviewed about George Jung - the character, not the real person.  They say poorly thought out and inarticulate things like, ""This guy... he's like... this guy don't care what anybody thinks, you know?""  My impression was that the actors just got in front of a camera ""in character"" and extemporized.  The results are pretty ghastly.  Also, there is the jailhouse interview that director Ted Demme makes of George Jung, the real person.  This is also pretty disedifying, consisting at the end of Demme sitting next to Jung on a bench and saying similarly inarticulate and poorly thought out things, like, ""Yeah, its like schoolteachers make minimum wage and there's truckdrivers making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year...""  Now, I am an ex-schoolteacher and though I did not make a mint at my job I certainly did not make ""minimum wage"" and I worked for one of the most underfunded school districts in the country.  One has the impression of being a witness to a guy blowing his mouth off on the balcony of somebody's post-college get-together.  Not pretty.  How Demme ever got people to trust him with millions of dollars remains a mystery: the man is simply not preposessing intellectually.  Also, his world is morally vague and equivocal.  He tells Jung he takes a non-judgemental stance to his crimes and then says that he himself has skeletons in the closet, its just that his are not so well known.  Now, I kind of doubt that Ted Demme is himself a serious criminal who has simply evaded discovery.  But that is what he is in effect implying, in bad faith to George Jung - a hardcore criminal.  The real implication is that any degree of malfeasance is equivalent to any other.  If one man has smuggled enormous quantities of drugs, and another man has left the cap off his toothpaste well, they're pretty much the same: we all do bad things.  Interestingly, the stance that Demme takes is NOT that what Jung did was not morally wrong.  His stance is that, though it was wrong, so what?  I can respect and perhaps agree with someone who says that smuggling drugs, though illegal, is not immoral.  I can understand the argument that by and large it is an utter liberal myth that anybody is forced to use drugs by anybody else.  Peer pressure?  One gravitates to ""peers"" with similar interests.  If you get into drugs and your friends don't, you find new friends:  druggie friends.  This happened in my circle of friends and I have seen it happen first-hand.  I had many druggie and non druggie friends and I never saw anybody use drugs who did not want to.  And there is simply no substance so addictive that it turns a straight arrow into a degenerate against the straight arrow's will and inclination.  Drugs simply help you along in the direction you are inclined.
All this being said, I can agree with someone who does not morally judge George Jung.  Personally I am morally indifferent to his actions.  But this is not the same thing as saying that what he did was wrong but so what we all do bad things.  If I once ignored a parking ticket, is this the same thing as being a murderer?  I suspect that Demme's thus cozying up to Jung actually lowered him in Jung's regard.",1088812800,2,3453,4.634266886326194

36929,5,0780635299,"This is a remarkable film about an exceptional story based on an eventful life. I'm surprised by the number of critics. Does this film try and glorify the drug dealer? No. Is George Jung a hero? No. Is the film's purpose to make him one? No. This is why I have problems with a majority of the critics of this excellent film. Why the criticism? The subject matter? The fact that it was based on a true story?
At any rate, back to the film, which is wonderfully shot backed up by great performances from Johnny Depp, Ray Liotta and Jordi Molla. The film is told from a narrative perspective by George Jung (Johnny Depp) tracing the spectacular rise and fall of the pioneering US cocaine distributor of the 1970's / 80's.
The film moves seamlessly from George's adolescence to adulthood through a number of locations and vividly captures the essence of that decadent era. The sets, costumes and music all work perfectly.
The audience takes an incredible journey, pulled into a world of drug smuggling / distributing, the illusion of 'easy money', ensuing greed and finally betrayal. While many are quick to point out the fact that this person was a ""drug dealer"" and ponder, ""why feel sorry for him?"", this misses the point. His story doesn't search for sympathy from the audience, although it is a sad one. It is an unapologetic look at an unapologetic life.
The greatest takeaway from his experience was that he realized too late what was truly important in his life. Simple things, not the money, not the cars, but ""real"" things as foreshadowed by his father's speech to him as a child. A point that is continually being underscored by his father's unconditional love (wonderfully played by Ray Liotta, a refreshing character change for him) and culminates in his own unconditional love for his daughter - although he is too late to recieve it.",1084233600,2,1844,4.729813664596273

36932,4,0780635299,"George Jung is the focus in this film by Ted Demme. It's about the rise and fall of one of the country's biggest drug dealers. Johnny Depp is at it again playing Jung with a vulnerability that's easy to like. Ray Liotta co-stars as Jung's father. A man who tried as hard as he could, but never quite made it. Jung's mother ( played so good by Rachel Griffiths) is the example of what happens when a child doesn't exceed the potential of a parent.
After being caught with 660 pounds of marijuana and sent to prison for 26 months, Jung meets Diego. A Columbian who has a dream of bringing cocaine to the mainstream and getting rich while doing so. When Jung gets released he comes into contact with Diego and the great Pablo Escobar. The three form a partnership and everyone is filthy rich. However, Diego steals Jung's ""California Connection"" played by a welcomed Paul Reubens.
Penelope doesn't fit in this movie at all. Almost like a Highlights book. What's wrong with this picture?
Overall, this film was a great look into the mindset of a driven person who's ambition far exceeded his talent. Even though I felt sorry for Jung throughout the movie, I had to tell myself that he put himself in those situations. No one forced him to do what he did. So goes the cliche, ""You play with fire... you get burned"".",1080691200,,1310,4.508403361344538
36933,5,0780635299,"""Blow"" is based on the true story of George Jung (Johnny Depp in one of his best roles), the loving son of a struggling businessman (Ray Liotta) who, as a child, upon seeing his family struggle to make ends meet and witnessing his mother's (Rachel Griffiths) resentment for his father because of their low income, vows to never be poor.  Thus ensues Jung's descent into the world of drugs.  He begins his three-decade rise and abrupt fall as a drug lord smuggling pot into the US in his early 20's during the pot-crazed 60's, which garners him an enormous amount of cash.  After landing a lengthy jail sentence, he meets Diego Delgado (Jordi Moll) in jail who introduces George to the far more profitable world of cocaine dealing.  He soon shoots to the top of the game and his biggest problem becomes where to put all of his cash.  It is said that if you used cocaine during the 70's and 80's, there's an 85% chance it came from Jung.
Over the years he struggles with a crack-addicted wife (Penlope Cruz as you've never seen her before), the relationship with his young daughter, and maintaining his relationship with the only person who truly cares for him in the world, his father.  Additionally, Jung is portrayed in a sympathetic light as a nice guy who just makes some bad decisions.  Usually I disagree with this type of ""glamorization"" of criminals, but I feel that in Jung's case it is truly deserved.
""Blow"" is not only the fascinating, pulse-pounding, and historically informative chronicle of the rise and fall of one of America's most influential drug lords; it also the exploration of some very deep personal connections, such as very deep father/son connection between George and his father.  In addition, George's love for his daughter, who ends up being the single thing motivating him to stay alive throughout his jail sentences, delivers a powerful emotional impact in the film's final scenes.  I also appreciated how director Ted Demme delicately showed us the parallels between George's mother's resentment for his father and George's wife's resentment for him after he loses most of his money as well as George's struggle to be a good father just as his own father did.
The final scenes of ""Blow"" are surprisingly moving, which ultimately distinguishes it from all of the other crime films out there.",1079654400,11,2322,4.828715365239295

The typical movie about drug lords and dealers tend to be stark and violent.  Even though this movie has its share of violence, the movie humanizes Jung to show depth and feeling.  We see his motivations and concerns.  Although we don't condone the behavior, we have a better insight into why this happens.
The DVD has some interview footage with Jung to provide the viewer with some background information.  I found this interesting, but Jung is not very animated, which can be expected from the long time spent in prison.

Similar material has been shown in a more original, interesting way in some Martin Scorece`s movies, and director Ted Demme eveen creates a couple of scenes that bring the master to mind. However, ""Blow"" lacks a point, it`s never that engaging and doesn`t have great moments or sequences to deliver, becoming tiresome and too long.
Also, it`s a movie that relies more in style (camera angles, soundtrack, clothes) than in substance, never developing its characters beyond two-dimensional figures that don`t make us care about their fate. Even Penlope Cruz, who plays Jung`s wife, doesn`t have much to do here apart from talking loud and looking sexy. The results are just average, offering a shade of what it could have been if handled properly.

 George Jung was a notorious drug dealer in America. In fact George makes connections with drug lord Pablo Esbar. Esbar was a Columbia drug lord, he is said to be the most dangerous drug dealer ever. George and Esbar are both millionaires when it came to the drug game.
 The movie talks about George at a younger age. Georges' father had his own successful construction company. When business was slow for his father, Georges' dad filed for bankruptcy. George Jung at that point decided as a young child, that he always wanted to have money.
 George Jung started selling Pot which later turn into him selling Cocaine. He transported Cocaine from Columbia to Holly Wood, California. Blow is a interesting an educational movie. What I mean by educational is it shows you ups and downs of the drug game. The most interesting thing about this movie is trying to figure out weather or not, if George would get caught by the law from selling drugs.

Director Ted Demme who sadly passed away shortly after filming was completed painted a real and all too scary account of of a man who scored big and made millions as one of the biggest cocaine dealers in the 70's but like everthing that is illegal crashed and burned in a spectacular and sad way. BLOW, is the true story of George Jung who as a young boy watched as his parents fought over money and lived O.K. but nothing out of the ordinary. One day when his father lost his job and had to file for bankruptcy young George said to his father that he ""never wanted to be poor"" to which his father responded ""than you won't"". Jung, wanted a lot of money and he wanted fast without going thru the trials and tribulations of getting a real ""decent"" job and settle for a less than ordinary life. This film is excellent but a little tough to watch especially as Jung's life and glitzly world of money and coke spirals out of control and worst of all gets turned over to the police by those he thought were his friends. Johnny Depp is the main reason to see this movie, here he gives his greatest performance yet and he is compelling as he is beliveable as Jung. You sometimes feel sorry for him, you know that he's done wrong but thru it all he is really not a bad guy just got caught up in a life that moves too fast and too dangerous.

The rest of the cast includes Penelope Cruz as Jung's wife, Paul ""Pee-Wee Herman"" Ruben, Ethan Suplee, Cliff Curtis, and Ray Liotta as Jung's sympathetic, loving father.

36951,2,0780635299,"This is a story of a ""good boy"" turned into a big drug dealer, including all the usual elements- the way up, the pretty wife, the cars, the riches, the betrayal of a good friend and then all the way down. Sounds familiar? Yes, you have seen it in ""Scar face"" and other movies of the same kind, only there the story was more interesting; Cruel maybe, but with some reasoning - you could understand the motives behind the actions of the heroes (be it to advance, to prove their power, to control) and you got immersed in the logic of the drug world.  This movie on the other hand is neither convincing in its logic or characters nor presented in an interesting manner. Contrary to what we expect the movie is also non violent and this fact (which in other cases could have been appreciated by me) makes it not credible, or rather covering up the truth more then disclosing as we know the events have truly happened.
George, the `good boy"", played by Johnny Depp is presented as some kind of tragic hero. Someone who got involved in ""bad things"" but really just wanted to live in peace and quiet with his family...The only explanation we get for his turn to crime was that his mom always used to nag his dad for money...Everything his dad earned was not enough. George then promised himself that he will always have money.
George gets into the drug business as if by mistake, just to earn some quick money for him and his friends (""these were great days""...he says with nostalgia). He was the mind behind the group of good kids and devises techniques of drug delivery while using his girlfriend Barbara as a carrier. The drugs are sold to other ""good kids"" from universities and colleges and the techniques of drug delivery grows more sophisticated as there is rise in demand. We never get to see the ""end customers"" or the final sale process which I assume could have been interesting to watch. Barbara dies from cancer (""I really loved her"") and George starts making big money by joining with the Boss, the famous Escobar, a symbol of the drug world and its corruption. However, not in this movie... The drug world presented here is clean of violence. The Colombian farmers are nave and nice and even the scene with Escobar is quite mellow, besides maybe one shot.  In George's jail periods we learn about the qualities of cocaine (good cocaine melts only in 86 degrees) but these facts seem to be the only gain from this movie.
I have just seen Johnny Depp as a charming Pirate in the new film ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" where he just shines through - here however, except for his beauty there are no signs of the famous Depp magic. Here his beauty is not enough to save his role from total shallowness. His gestures and facial expressions are void of any true feelings.
Penelope Cruz who plays the beautiful wife is one of my favorite actresses. However, I have to admit that even she does a lousy job here. Maybe it's not her fault as her role is of the spoiled rich wife who does nothing but be pretty and smoke drugs - however, her part is a pale replica of the part Michelle Pfeiffer does in scar face and she does not manage to look convincing, nor is it clear what besides her looks, drew George to her. Penelope Cruz hardly appears in the movie and I did not appreciate the fact that her picture is the one appearing on the cover of this movie. Ray Liota and Rachel Griffiths play George's parents, and although Ray Liota is convincing as the father, the mother seems the same age as her son and she does not seem to bring anything to this role.
I must confess that in several parts this movie seems like an ""ordered movie"" to clean the name of George Jung or at least present him in a human light as the movie is so one sided and unconvincing. In the end we see George in prison, waiting and hoping that his daughter would come to visit... the movie is filled with manipulations such as this one who are meant to make you feel sorry for this man.",1061078400,,3955,4.423868312757202

I just wanted to comment that this not only is a story about the rise and fall of a notorious drug dealer, but also the story of a man and his family. It's about the love a father has for his daughter and the promises that he tries but in the end can't keep. In the beginning of the movie, George Jung(Johnny Depp) deals drugs to make money. After his daughter is born though, he gets out of the business and tries unsuccessfully to lead a more 'normal' life with his wife and kid. In the end though it all falls apart for him since he's penniless and dismissed by both his wife and daughter. It's a tragic story that will leave one with the pangs of regret for not only the mistakes that Jung made but also of the love he missed out from his daughter,ie. his whole world.",1034294400,2,854,4.181818181818182
36961,4,0780635299,"""Blow"" is neither the most innovative or well made movie about a the ups and downs of being a drug lord, but it succeeds as a docudrama about a drug dealer who's short lived success hardly made up for all the wrong choices he made. Johnny Depp, as usual, has the art of character acting down to a fine art.
Depp plays George Jung, an ambitious kid who became a drug czar in America in the 1970's and 1980's. He came from a working class background where his father (Ray Liotta) worked like a slave to support the family. The catalyst was when his father filed for bankruptcy, and there Geroge vowed never to live in poverty. He moved to California, made connections, including a flamboyant hairdresser (Paul Reubens, in a standout role), and started the drug trend in America that ""exploded like an atomic bomb"". The movie has it's share of ups and downs, and George learns that maybe drug dealing isn't a wise career choice. He only learns this through a series of betrayls and blunders.
""Blow"" is directed in a retro style similar to that of ""Boogie Nights"". The wild music, the over-the-top acting and characterization, and the stylish dialogue. While heavily dramatized, ""Blow"" is based on a true story, and according to the real Geroge Jung, was pretty accurate. Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz both excell themselves in their excellent performances. Ted Demme, who died after ""Blow"" was released, did an excellent job. He was definitely a rising star in the Director's Guild.
The Infinifilm DVD package is a must own. The entertaining movie aside, it is crammed with extra features which are just as entertaining as the film. It has the usual featurettes, plus the examination of the story behind the movie. It shows the real George Jung, and the director's commentary is very insightful. In short, ""Blow"" is a fun and wild movie worth repeated viewings.",1031184000,,1858,4.773291925465839

36964,4,0780635299,"Johnny Depp is Blow. The movie like the intrinsic narcissism of the drug, spirals out of Depp's eye. J.D. is fast becoming a hell of a character actor a la Val Kilmer. Only stylized acting like this transforms such a script into a movie I'll watch every few years. Depp's sensibilities, the cat-house cool, the vaunted respect balanced with a well hidden cockiness are all the vital inflections needed against the drug lords and soldiers he encounters in the movie. George Jung's ambitions far outweigh his talent. The gringo-makes-nice with a far-off world. Yea the documentary facade of the film is obvious, and all the nasty trappings of the Life are well delivered, but to rest on this is missing the point. Blow is a metaphor for the edge, Kristeva's semiotic unspeakable. Like any Eastwood movie, character, not the voice tracking of mainstream acting, is the true anima to an new economy. The late Ted Demme's eye for character is astounding. Jordi Malla's part as Depp's partner is brilliantly creepy and cloying, the devil in disguise. Cliff Curtis, who plays Escobar, is necessary, beedy eyes and all; not to mention Paul Reubens, the Bobcat and even Ray Liotta, who brought something essential.

36966,5,0780635299,"After reading the mixed reviews on this movie, I watched it with a high level of skepticism, but was quickly impressed by this movie, except I do have to say that Penelope Lopez's character got under my skin pretty quickly....perhaps another actress could have brought more depth to the role...?  Anyway, it kind of reminded me of watching Miami Vice, only from the other side and it was fascinating to watch how a small time drug dealer came to have one of the largest drug empires in U.S. History in such a short period of time.  I especially like one of the first scenes when they show cocaine being made in Columbia....leaves are ground up, turned into a paste, spread out on a table to dry, thus turning it into a powder firm which is then measured out to be distributed. It also causes you to feel for the Columbian people who are poor, and thus reliant on exporting this drug for economic survival....makes for a complicated political/moral situation.  I even felt myself feeling a little sorry for George Jung towards the end, but I could have felt more so if he had displayed more emotion throughout the film. It was sad to see his friends of all those years suddenly turn on him in order to save themselves from the Feds.  Just goes to show you what a ruthless business drug dealing is and like his dad said in the begining ""money isn't all that important....it only seems like it is""...this could also be seen when he lost nearly all his money when his foreign bank was taken over by the new government. I was also pleasantly surprised to see that the movie wasn't as overly violent as it could have been given the subject matter...I think only two people were shot during the entire movie. Just goes to show you that a movie doesn't have to rely on violence and gore to be good...a good storyline can support it alone.....other movies today could learn from this.  The only thing I couldn't understand is why Johnny Depp bleached his hair blonde for the role when according to the photo shown at the end, the real George Jung was a brunette....?",1025827200,,2057,4.533692722371968

Depp struggles with an amusing, forced, and marginal Boston accent. He seems to have copped it by watching Good Will Hunting about six times. He should have watched it six or eight more times.

36970,5,0780635299,"Director Ted Demme died from a drug overdose around a year after finishing Blow.  One suspects that the highly talented Demme desired to confront his own demons while putting together this first rate film.  Johnny Depp aptly portrays George Jung as a man who subtly, but most assuredly chose the path to self destruction.  He is not a victim and deserves no pity.  Is Jung a monster? Perhaps not, but he made his own bed and now has to lie in it.  Jung is greatly responsible for introducing the horror of cocaine into the United States.  He starts out as a typical teenager from a blue collar family.  Jung's father (Ray Liotta) and mother (Rachel Griffiths) raises their family in a struggling middle class environment.  During his early adult years, Jung travels to California and starts enjoying the wild parties, easy sex, and mind altering drugs.  He eventually meets a major drug seller (Paul Reubens) who partners with him to market very large quantities of marijuana.  Common sense dictates that sooner or later Jung will be arrested.  Sadly, however, Jung is not only personally addicted to drugs but also the accompanying risky lifestyle. Rational considerations therefore will not stand in the way of Jung's slide into evil and debauchery.
We eventually accompany Jung to Columbia where he is promoted to the major leagues of drug running.  Betrayal and back stabbing become the norm.  He meets and marries Mirtha (Penelope Cruz), a woman is also a coke junkie and out of control pleasure seeker.  Hedonism dominates their lifestyle, and money is so plentiful that neither knows how to spend it all.  They flippantly make large purchases which soon bore them.  Bringing a child into the world does little to encourage prudence.  Their train is going to crash, and one can only hope the collateral damage is minimal.  Our eyes are riveted to the screen as Jung is ultimately brought to a bad end. Ted Demme may have been too conflicted to unambiguously present George Jung as a moral monster deserving of severe punishment, but we never mistake him for some sort of misunderstood folk hero.
Blow will force you to wonder if our drug laws make any sense.  Is it truly worth the damage to our political and public institutions to continue criminalizing such activity?  Jung, after all,  may be still be in jail, but his successors remain on the street.  I also recommend Traffic and the utterly fantastic and overlooked masterpiece, Rush.

Having said all that, this was a great film to watch though it did surprise me somewhat. Basically, this movie is about a guy named George Jung who was the first american to smuggle cocaine into the US.
It shows his life story from humble beginnings in dope selling to the high rolling stakes of cocaine smuggling. As to the reason why this filmed surprised me ? It is because I wasn't interested in the fact that cocaine had dealt the US with a major drug problem, rather the plight of George Jung himself ( and his parents ) and what he was like.
At best, this movie portrayed George Jung as a humble kid who turned into a drug lord ( in which he deserved what he got ). Johnny Depp, Penelope Cruz and the two Aussie actors Cliff Curtis and Rachel Griffiths played their characters well enough for all of us to believe that George Jung was only trying to earn a living at what he did best: selling drugs.

At the peak of his power, George Jung estimates he was responsible for supplying 85% of America's cocaine demand. The movie traces George's life from his early childhood, through to his final incarceration at the OTIS Correctional Facility.
The movie has an excellent cast with a very powerful performance by Johnny Depp. He successfully portrays both the fun loving, carefree George as well as the older, hardened, more serious George. Even though it is difficult to condone George's lifestyle choices, I think everyone can empathise with his desire to ""take nothing...and turn it into something"". Isn't that after all what we are all trying to do? The movie moves along at a fast pace and you are constantly kept on the edge of your seat.

They signed a terrific lead actor, and a great supporting cast that reminded me dead-on of several people I knew in college.  Very watchable, and a good biography.
What keeps it from a higher rating is partially the bad luck of it being released around the time of the far superior ""Traffic"".  But besides telling you that one man was more responsible than others for the explosion of cocaine in this country 25 years ago, there's not much else.  While the movie certainly doesn't portray George Jung as a hero, it is asking for sympathy when things important to him are finally taken away.
However, here is a person who did NOTHING but deal drugs for a living all his adult life.  Now I can buy the arguement that he was just supplying what the people wanted, and the purchasers are just as guilty as the supplier.  But there are two problems I have with this.  First, the movie goes to great pains to show that he wasn't necessarily a violent man, although he did carry a gun and threatened people with it.  But his close association with Pablo Escobar, who was a merciless killer, puts Jung big time in guilt by association.  For this I have no sympathy for the man.
Second, this guy did his second swing in prison because he was under surveillance for his first pinch.  He knew very well the cops were watching him, yet practically sets himself up for the bust.  With all that, and knowing that the government was REALLY observing him after his second visit to prison, what does he do?  Goes out and becomes part of another big deal. Like Henry Hill in ""Goodfellas"", it never occurs to him that there are other ways to get money, albeit not as quickly.  I think society sometimes has to lock up stupid people to protect them from themselves.
Overall, I did like the movie, and recommend it.  But for someone who has lived totally for himself all his life, and in his forties all of a sudden has a child, this doesn't make you a nice person.  Yes, prison is bad when it takes away the things you like, but then that's the point.",1015804800,,2156,4.434010152284264
36987,2,0780635299,"""Blow"" is Ted Demme's attempt to be Martin Scorcese for a couple of hours.
Demme borrows so much from Scorcese's style in 'Goodfellas' (the flashbacks with 50's-60's music on the soundtrack; freeze frames and voice over narration) it's as if Scorcese is in the wings shouting instructions.
""Blow"" details the story of George Jung, who, growing up watching his hard working father drowning in both a sea of debt  and the constant nagging of a shrewish wife, vows never to experience poverty himself.
Jung goes from peddling pot to college kids to become a full fledged drug kingpin doing business with Pablo Escobar and the Colombian cartel.
Johnny Depp is a fine actor, but the screenplay doesn't give him all that much to work with...Penelope Cruz as Jung's Colombian wife is gorgeous, but she can't act and when she's emasculating Depp in one particular scene, the result is almost laughable (""you are a Poosy!"").
The whole thing leaves you with an empty feeling buoyed by the realization that you've just watched a two hour film about a guy whose chief accomplishments in life were dealing drugs and going to prison.

36989,4,0780635299,"I initially had no interest in this film, thinking who wants to see a movie about some two bit dope dealer? My teenage son, however, rented the DVD, and I found myself a captive audience. To my surprise, it was a riveting, well done film. Sure, it was about a two bit dope dealer, but what a story. George Jung, an all American kid from a hard working, hard knocks family, begins dealing marijuana during the 1960s. He develops his business into an empire, and then he decides to branch out into the sexier world of cocaine and really big money. Using his considerable entrepreneurial instinct, he makes a deal with the Columbian drug cartel. Before you know it, he is raking in millions. Unfortunately, the best laid plans often go awry, and there is no fairy tale ending for George. This is a story of hopes, dreams, violence, greed, and betrayal.
Well directed by the late Ted Demme, the film is compelling and absorbing as it recounts George Jung's incredible odyssey in the drug trade, tracking the rise of the cocaine industry in the United States, attendant with all its violence. Johnny Depp, in the role of George Jung, makes him into a likable guy who has bitten off more than he can chew, with ultimately dire results. His is a search for the American Dream, a dream that forever remains elusive.
Ray Liotta is terrific in the role of George's father, Fred Jung, a sensitive and devoted everyman married to a hard, selfish woman, Ermine Jung, a woman who lacks all motherly instincts and is played with gritty determination by Rachel Griffiths. Jordi Molla is excellent in the role of Diego, George's entre into the world of high stakes, cocaine dealing, and Cliff Curtis is excellent as Escobar, the Columbian drug cartel's main man. Penelope Cruz is terrible as George's beautiful Latina wife, Mirtha. She is simply a bad actress whose English is often unintelligible. With the exception of Ms. Cruz, however, the cast is uniformly excellent.
This is the story about a young man who, faced with choices in his life, made the wrong ones and lived to regret it. Johnny Depp captures the pathos of Jung's wasted life. That his characterization is dead on is brought home by Ted Demme's wonderful interview of the real George Jung. This interview is one of the numerous bonus features on this DVD and is well worth watching. It is a poignant interview, as it underscores that Jung's was a life wasted. It also serves to illustrate just how remarkable Depp's characterization of Jung really is. All in all, this is a vibrant, informative, and entertaining film.",1014076800,142,2569,4.749440715883669
36990,3,0780635299,"This is a review of the DVD, not the film itself--which has its own set of problems in this fascinating true story delivered in a very inconsistent, flawed fashion. But I digress...on to the DVD. ""A"" for concept, ""D"" for execution. It's hard to believe that anyone actually reviewed and checked the results before this went into production.
Both Video and audio are quite good--a very clean, impressive job that truly makes watching this film enjoyable and worthwhile.
It's on the Infinifilm extras where this DVD comes up extremely weak. Though a few are terrific additions--the interview/comments with the real George Jung, for example--others appear to be slap-dash efforts at filling up the disk and giving the impression that there's real quality within. A good example is the so-called ""Fact Track,"" which is designed to play as subtitles in the Infinifilm version of the movie. ""Fact Track?"" Hah! Loads of typos/spelling errors (heroine instead of heroin in one passage, for example), factual errors (Woodstock Festival--""Three Days of Peace and Music"" as it occurred in 1969--has an extra fourth day added here by the creators of the ""Fact Track""), random ""Facts"" that come in places that often demonstrate little rhyme or reason for their location in the film and hop all over the map without any real sense of organization, bio subtitles about some of the cast but not others, a blatantly unbalanced anti War on Drugs message which is rendered so via tons of stats on (what I agree is) the huge waste of federal monies and effort in this regard WITHOUT ANY mention or statistics on the still ongoing devastation wreaked upon our country by cocaine and, by his involvement, George Jung.
The Documentary on the effects of cocaine on Colombia is pretty good and important given the lack of mention in the film itself, but at times the people speaking (in Spanish with English subtitles) talk so rapidly that in some spots it's nearly impossible to both follow the dialogue and the picture without watching again. (Maybe that's the trick! ""You'll watch it over and over again!"")
The Production Diary--short video excerpts on various random days of the 63-day shoot--includes an excerpt from one day which consists entirely of an audio track that is normal like the rest but accompanied by video which consists entirely of the camera pointed down at the pavement. Intriguing.
Last but not least, the Infinifilm feature itself--think VH1's ""Pop-up Videos""--is fabulous in concept but a failure too often in execution to really be worthwhile. Some extras (most deleted or alternate scenes, for example) appear exactly where logical, such as the alternate Intro. Others pop up in places that seem to be entirely random (Ted Demme's filmography, which pops up not with the opening credits, but instead somewhere deep within the film.) Some just don't fit where they are at all in a fashion that leaves one believing that the creators weren't even paying attention (or perhaps had just done some BLOW) when they inserted them (a jump to a spot about Otisville FCI pops up early in the film when George is sent to Danbury FCI instead of at the end when we see him in the Upstate New York slammer.)
The most useful and enjoyable part of Infinfilm (an overall concept which has the potential to be phenomenal!) is the ability to see alternate versions of scenes in direct A/B comparison to the ones that made the final cut.
Look, I don't HATE this DVD package and did enjoy the film and exploring the disk, but its features are WAY OVER-HYPED and fall short of the sell-job done on them. Unabashed fans of the film will probably love them all regardless of the ""Facts."" Do other Infinifilms have similar problems? This is the first Infifinifilm I've seen.
One note about the film and its screenplay. Both contain an error early in the film (in the mid 1960's) when George, Tuna, and his other bud from Mass. are discussing the colleges back in Mass. where they can sell their weed. One school that they mention is Hampshire College, which didn't enroll its first class until 1970. FACT CHECKING, FACT CHECKING. Can't believe no one in production caught that, given the comparatively large number of Hampshire grads who work in the film industry. OK, OK, I'm done....",1012262400,,4263,4.897648686030429

36993,5,0780635299,"I got this DVD for Christmas. It's two days later, and I've already watched it three times, including the infinifilm inserts. I'm a big fan of Johnny Depp, but that's not it. I love the music, but that's not it. And I'm no big fan of cocaine.
I like the movie because it does not glorify, nor does it condemn, drug use per se. In many ways it just is, and has been, for a very long time. It has a lot to do with the 'market' that exists, and that has been exploited for the money.
I loved Jung's relationship with his father, as it was portrayed. His father did not understand what he was doing, but did not judge him. It was clear to me that, at least as the story was told in the movie, Jung was trying to make enough money to keep the women in his life happy, having experienced recurring abandonment by his mother over the issue of money. Drugs are, if nothing else, about money and power. Just ask anyone in the government who will tell you.
I also liked the awareness I got about the drug economy in Colombia, a basically poor country without the economy of drugs. Dig a little deeper, though you won't find the information in this movie, and you will know why. My country creates these economies, and then exploits them. Why? For money and power. This is supposed to be a democracy, but nobody asked me. I would have voted against anything like that. Lots of people would, if they understood it.
At a time when the cocaine explosion took off, there was a great deal of support for it. Without that support, it would not have happened. It then got corrupted, but you would have to read the book *Barry and the Boys* to see how that happened.
Still and all, though, I liked the message of the movie. There is money and power in the industry, but it costs a lot more than it is worth, depending on what you value. It's a powerful movie, though perhaps not for everyone.
I particularly liked the cameo appearance by Bobcat Goldthwaite. I didn't even recognize him until the third time around. He doesn't look good. But then, in the movie, he wasn't supposed to.",1009584000,,2064,4.335917312661499

This is a true story of Americas most infamous cocaine dealer, George Jung.  In about 2 hours of time you see the rise and fall of this legendary man.  The director also deserves a hand.  The way this movie was filmed really gave you a good piece of what was happening in his life, but left some things in the dark, which made the movie all the more intriging.  This movie shows the roller coaster type of life George Jung had at an interesting perspective.  All of the massive massive amounts of drug dealing that was going on didn't seem like the works of a hardcore street hustler, but like the works of a man with ambition.

36995,5,0780635299,"Blow is a story about the biggest drug dealer on the West Coast, George Jung. It takes place in the 70's and early 80's and Jung is played by Johnny Deep.
There are several aspects to this film that make it great.
1. No matter how hard he tries George Jung can never get the approval of his parents, because he is making money illegally.
2. The more money Mr. Jung makes, it never seems that he is happy with his life.
3. When the characters start using drugs more frequently, you see them start to look worse and worse because of this.
4. No matter who he considers a friend, there are no friends in the drug business and George finds this out the hard way. When he is in jail the first time he forms a partnership with Diego, who has ties in Colombia and wants to move Coke. His other buddy Derek (Paul Reubens) helped George when he was dealing Pot, also gets involved because he helped George move 50 kilos (110 lbs) of coke in little over one day. Diego then decides to hook up with Derek and together fade out George, they basically cut out the middle man. His two friends stab him in the back and this is when he decides he is out.
5. One of his old buddies is part of a crew he works with towards the end, so he can have one last score and start a new life in Cali with his daughter. Little does he know that he will get stabbed in the back again because the crew is paid off by the FBI and DEA and bring George down for good!
Those are just some of the things, but there is plenty more in this movie especially his wife Mirtha (Penelope Cruz) who sets him up as well. You owe it to yourself to watch this movie at least twice and then buy because it is that good!",1009324800,3,1672,4.054380664652568
36996,3,0780635299,"I'm impressed with Infinifilm's presentation style in their DVD efforts.  I really loved 13 Days (see a prior review), and if there is one thing worthy of notice in ""Blow"", it is the presentation, technical style and DVD extras.  No attempt is made in the actual film to explore the horrors of cocaine, but the two
documentaries make it clear how the 70's drug of choice has devastated the culture and society of Colombia, along with the lives of many.  Ted Demme, a fine director, explores what scenes were left on the cutting room floor in an entertaining piece, and the real George Jung gives a film interview that makes the ""goings on"" in Blow seem a little closer to reality.
That said, the film was a disappointment to me - well filmed, with no seeming point or passion.  I felt that Johnny Depp was
believable and totally in character for the role, and perhaps he
and Demme meant to have him exhibit little or no passion or chemistry with the central women in his life, his mother, his wife, his daughter.  He's believable in the youth scenes and the drug trafficking scenes, in prison....but seeing him try to make us believe that his daughter is the central focus of his life...well, it just didn't feel that way on the screen.
Ray Liotta is miscast and subdued as Jungs' dad, and, with every passing flick I grow more and more disenchanted with Penelope Cruz, who just seems to show up on the screen, emote a little, and hurry to get back to her film trailer.  Capt. Corelli was disastrous, she is strident and unattractive in Blow, and, intuition tells me that Vanilla Sky will fall on its face.
So, you take a bit of pop culture, add an incredibly talented leading man and director with little support from the other cast, and perhaps not enough of a tale to tell, and you get ""Blow"".
Not a favorite of mine.",1007596800,2,1820,4.5167173252279635
36997,4,0780635299,"I have to admit, I did find this film very entertaining. It does steal it's cinematography, direction, and soundtrack style from 1990s Martin Scorsese classic ""Goodfellas"" in a very obvious rip-off though. Let's face it, that's part of what makes it entertaining. What a compliment, over a decade and someone is still trying to capture that magic.

There IS some magic herein. The film moves along interestingly, doesn't really have any dull moments, and is easy to follow.  This is a very watchable cast as well.  I personally found this film far more interesting than ""Traffic"", which felt slow, and too convoluted.  I will say that Johnny Depp was somewhat annoying to me in his role as main character George Jung. He wasn't a sympathetic character, he just seemed like a moron who managed to accrue a ton of money illegally, only to ""Blow"" it.  I didn't care about him or anyone else in the film, due to the one big fault here, poor character development.  Everyone in the movie seems empty, with the exception of Ray Liotta, who did a fine job as George's dad. I disliked Depp's bogus New England accent, it was annoying to listen to his narrations of the events.  This only thing worse?  His moms annoying nasal whine.  I lived in New England at one time, nobody sounded like this!  I also can't fathom why George evolves into such a doofy goofball toward the end, after having been a fairly cool guy at the beginning.

The plot develops heat in the form of beautiful Mirtha (Penelope Cruz). She is a hedonistic, self indulgent Columbian coke family princess.  There is some steamy sexual chemistry as the two meet at a wedding of Georges closest  Columbian associate.  George steals Mirtha from a rival who can't fight his good standing with Pablo Escobar, famed (or so they say) lord of the (drug)rings. The two words ""I Do"" turn George into more than just a ""gringo"" to the cartel.  He becomes part of the family too.  Of course, that's not ALL he becomes as a result of this union.  Watch and see for yourself.

Something I found funny, is the not so coincidental casting of Ray Liotta as Georges n'er do well Dad, and the goomah(girlfriend) he kept on the side in ""Goodfellas"", playing Georges Dad and Mom respectively.

For the most part, watching the rise and fall of Jung from the 60s as a drug dealer who starts with marijuana, then pushes the envelope to a 70s Cocaine empire, is fun. You get an excellent feel of those eras in time, the clothes, hair, music ect. Again though, a similar agenda to ""Goodfellas."" The only difference?  One was the rise and fall of a ""mobster"" the other a ""drug dealer"" but still, chronicled in similar fashion during the same eras. However, since Henry Hill and associates did traffic and sell cocaine in a major amounts, the only difference is with ""Blow"" is, that's the ONLY basis of the story.

That said, although one dimensional in its plot, not delving too deeply into who anyone actually is, or really getting any feeling for the characters beneath the facade, surface fluff this colorful, is STILL fun and entertaining. That means, it's definitely worth a look.",1007596800,6,3117,4.682568807339449
36998,2,0780635299,"Coming as it does so hot on the heels of the brilliant, multi-leveled ""Traffic,"" ""Blow"" emerges as a superficial, shallow and second-rate survey of the drug-dealing world.  Spanning close to five decades, the film chronicles the true-life account of one George Jung, a hotshot cocaine trafficker from the 1970's who is currently serving a 60-year prison sentence for his crimes.
Very little about this film feels original or authentic, as it travels a dramatic arc that seems totally predictable for films of this genre (""Traffic,"" by the way, did NOT follow this path).  We start with George's unhappy home life growing up in Massachusetts in the 1960's, then it's onto his introduction to drug selling on the beaches of California, his trips to Colombia for meetings with the famous drug cartel leader, Pablo Escobar, his seemingly endless arrests, imprisonments and releases from prison and finally, of course, his too-late realization that the only thing of any value in his life is his little daughter whose life he is managing to screw up in a royal way.
The early days of his ""career"" - when he is just a young punk making his connections and getting his feet wet in the ""glamorous"" world of the burgeoning late-60's drug culture - are dramatized on screen with tedious predictability.  Even the youthful looking Johnny Depp may be getting a bit long-in-the-tooth to be portraying a late teen, early twenty-something beach bum.  The film picks up a little dramatic energy when George is introduced to Escobar, but this aspect of the film is dropped almost immediately in order to concentrate on the tiresome interpersonal backstabbing between George and a number of his drug-running cronies.  I realize that this is supposed to be based on a true story, but it is still a shame when the movie ends up having to downplay and eventually even jettison the one subplot that carries with it at least some dramatic validity.  Equally uninteresting is George's relationship with his wife, Mirtha (Penelope Cruz), a stereotypical cocaine-snorting, Latina sexpot, more concerned with her drug supply than with her husband and daughter.  The filmmakers even try to draw some heavy-handed parallels between George's family (weak but loving father, emasculating, self-centered mother) and the family he has formed with his own wife and daughter.
The biggest failure of the film comes in its clunky attempts to make George into some kind of admirable, sympathetic figure.  Fully the last half hour of the film is spent showing us just what an ""innocent victim of circumstance"" George turns out to be.  Even when he is trying his damnedest to go straight, the vagaries of fate keep conspiring against him to draw him back into the world of crime and prison.  We are supposed to feel sorry for him because he can't seem to get his life together well enough to be able to raise the daughter he so obviously loves.  Yet, when he is finally given the chance to prove his love to her by supporting her and her mother financially, what does he end up doing but arranging for yet another (and in this case abortive) drug deal.  It is one thing to provide us with an emotionally complex, morally ambiguous character.  It is quite another to expect us to feel pity for a man whose modus operandi is that of sheer stupidity.  All our empathy for the character ends up flying out the window and all we can do basically is to feel that the character got what was coming to him.
As George, Johnny Depp seems to be sleepwalking through the part, although it may not be entirely his fault.  Writers Bruce Porter and David McKenna and director Ted Demme never establish that feeling of explosive dramatic intensity so crucial to a film of this nature.  In fact, for a film dealing with the dangerous world of drug trafficking, ""Blow"" seems to just sit there lackadaisically on the screen for most of its duration, devoid of energy, tension and drama. Needless to say, ""Blow"" ain't no ""Traffic.""",1005350400,9,3971,4.85207100591716

The movie plods along slowly, without any real purpose. Sure, there are some fun scenes along the way, but the movie doesn't seem to have a real point. I'm not going to tell anyone not to watch it; everyone should form their own opinions. But I'd definitely suggest renting it before splurging on a DVD.",1005264000,,522,4.5638297872340425
37000,4,0780635299,"""Blow"" is a very good biopic on the life of cocaine kingpin George Jung (Johnny Depp) who rose to prominence in the 1980's as one of the largest cocaine traffickers in the United States.  The story is an interesting character study of Jung, who started selling marijuana to pay some bills and found that demand continued to outpace his ability to supply until he had built a cocaine empire.
In an interview from prison included on the DVD, Jung states that the story was very true to actual events and that in certain cases it was like a flashback.  Jung appears from this interview to be a hapless soul who was willingly swept along by a riptide of forces that were beyond his sway, which is exactly how Depp portrayed him.
Johnny Depp is an excellent character actor who relishes playing odd and offbeat characters.  In this film he gives one of his best and most nuanced performances with a clear understanding of the motivations and circumstances that spun Jung out of control.  He plays Jung with naivet rather than giving him the sinister character that one might expect from a drug lord.  After having seen the interview with the real Jung it seems Depp was right on target.
Penelope Cruz also expands her horizons, shedding her normally sweet persona to take on the part of Jung's shrewish, drug addicted wife.  Cruz plays the part with great force and emotion, like a woman possessed.  It is a fantastic portrayal of a bitter, self centered woman with a drug problem.
Paul Reubens continues his comeback from the ill fated Pee-wee Herman days with a solid portrayal of Derek, the double dealing hair dresser who becomes Jung's primary distributor.  Rachel Griffiths and Ray Liotta also give fine performances as Jung's clueless parents.
This character study is well written and sympathetically presented by director Ted Demme.  I rated it an 8/10.  It contains standout performances by both Depp and Cruz and is well worth seeing.",1005264000,,1939,4.813253012048193

37007,4,0780635299,"Starring Johnny Depp, this story is based on the life of George Jung, a drug dealer who made millions of dollars in the 1970s and is now serving a long prison sentence. As a young man, George goes to California and teams up with a flamboyant gay hairdresser, played by Paul Reubens, to sell marijuana. After a short prison sentence where he meets Jordi Molla, a Colombian drug dealer, he graduates to cocaine. All this is done with relative ease against a background of the exaggerated hairstyles and clothing that seem like artificial props. His first girlfriend, Franka Potente is a stewardess who helps him get started by smuggling marijuana in her travel bag; his second girlfriend, Penelope Cruz is enamoured by his money. All of this casting is excellent and the craziness that was the 70s comes through loud and clear.
I liked the cinematography. The period of the 1950s was shot in an over-exposed brightness. And there were quick snapshot montages which were well done. The action moved quickly and I was intrigued throughout although the presence of Ray Liotta, cast as George's father, kept reminding me of ""Goodfellas"" which was a much better film. It is hard to relate to the Johnny Depp character however. His life was a tragedy but yet he seemed shallow. Perhaps this is by design because the writers did not want to glorify a drug dealer. It did glorify the money though, and the high-living lifestyle that it brought even though it blew away just like everything else. Even though I wasn't deeply moved, I do recommend this film.

37008,3,0780635299,"This film presses all the right buttons, but being touted as basically the true-life story of George Jung, I was disappointed that the film paid little respect to the chronology of significant events and completely overlooked many of the defining moments of George's career.
Having already read the book ""Blow"" - available from Amazon and an excellent biography - perhaps I found it more difficult to get ""into"" the movie, often asking myself ""why is this happening/not happening now?"" amongst other things...
A few obvious changes for dramatic effect, perhaps.....
1. George's first girlfriend (played by the babelicious Franka Potente) tell's George she has an incurable disease, so he skips bail to hang out with her in Mexico until she dies. In actual fact, the girlfriend was dumped pretty quickly, was never fatally-ill (interviewed for the book) and was one of a long, long succession of girls that George used and discarded during his ""career"". He skipped to Mexico purely because he didn't want to go to jail, and move into ""quantity"" smuggling of marijuana.
2. George is basically kidnapped and taken to Colombia to meet Pablo Escobar, - a test - and this meeting ""starts"" the whole coke business. In fact however, George had been importing/dealing large quantities of coke for a few years before going to meet Pablo - something he did voluntarily on his own, to gain status among the Florida-based Columbians and gain favour with Pablo in his problems with Carlos Lehder - a cartel member.
The movie ignores or trivialises many of George's character traits - huge long-term coke usage and the resultant psychosis and paranoia, his life-long addiction to hookers, kinky sex, including masochistic tendencies played-out by cross-dressing (french maid)and being dominated and ""spanked"" by his wife while tied spread-eagled to their marital bed, among many others.
The turning point, the start of his ""real"" troubles is when George confides his secrets to an undercover cop whom he meets one afternoon on the beach out-front of his house. In short-order, George invites the guy into his house, tells the cop that he's a big-time smuggler and immediately makes him part of the ""operation"" without knowing anything about the guy. This of course brings big heat onto George, and the good-guys start engineering George's downfall.
The movie omits this entire pivotal event however, perhaps because the real-life event, that for a genuine big-time dealer with $30m stashed in the house,at least, displayed a degree of stupidity and naievety that would make Johnny Depp's George (smart, hip, trusting)look stupid and just too unbelievable to be sympathetic.
Nor is there any factual basis for the whole father/daughter interplay in the movie, which I personally think is overdone, and is pretty out-of-character anyway.
Finally (at least for this review) the money George had stashed away in Panama, approx. $50m apparently, was not confiscated by the Panamanian Govt (Noriega)- George never visited Panama - but was stolen by the pilots who opened the bank account for George, (co-signatories) and flew the cash down on a regular basis over several years. It defies belief that over several years, George never thought to enquire about the balance of his account, and just kept shuttling the cash into the account, but that's what actually happened.
Carlos Lehder was arrested in Colombia - basically fingered by Escobar for bringing the heat down on the cartel because of his loopy political beliefs, extradited to the States, with George being the main prosecution witness. This gained George early release, and it was actually another bust in the mid-80's that reulted in George's present incarceration. Again, none of this was in the movie, although I think it would have brought another perspective to George's characterisation, and also given George some revenge for his beating by Carlos' thugs on Norman Cay (never happened) had it been included.
I guess all these and many more factual inaccuracies in combination with Johnny Depp's overly sympathetic portrayal of George - almost a victim of circumstance - and definitely too ""nice"" to be in the drug business, are so far off the real-deal that it made it very difficult for me to give this movie the respect that so many others think it deserves....
All this doesn't stop the movie being good entertainment but I can't help thinking how good it ""could"" have been, had it been a little more true to George's real story.
The cast is generally outstanding, the look and sound of the DVD transfer never less than luscious, and the soundtrack really brought back the  70s / early 80s for me - a time of bad fashion, worse haircuts, and for most of us, a time probably best forgotten.
Buy the DVD. The book ""blow"" is definitely worth reading, and if you're still interested in the whole coke thing, consider checking out the book titled ""Killing Pablo"" a factual look at the the coke business, the Medelin cartel, and the hunt-for and eventual killing of Pablo Escobar. Now ""there's"" a movie just begging to be made......",1003190400,79,5078,5.052443384982122
37009,4,0780635299,"Review is divided into two parts:  Movie itself, and DVD extras
Movie:
Explain to me for whom I am supposed to feel sympathy or empathy?  Jung?  I don't think so.  He created his dilemma through his own actions, without any regard for the effect of his actions.  I guess I have a hard time enjoying a movie with neither a sympathetic protagonist nor a social message.  This film lacks both.
That being said, the filmmaking side of the movie is impressive, from cinematography to soundtrack.  Depp does a serviceable job with the material with which he is presented.
DVD:
This DVD features Infinifilm, which can best be described as VH-1's pop-up video experience transferred to a DVD.  The feature is quite impressive (and would have been more impressive if I had liked the movie).  It seems best suited to this type of film: historical.  Put another way, I don't need to see the Infinifilm version of ""Dude, Where's My Car?""
The DVD also features (as part of the Infinifilm) characters comments regarding other characters, deleted scenese, George Jung interviews, and various other minutiae.  This concept is quite impressive, but it would be better with a better film to supplement.
The film is a 3 star, the infinifilm a 5 star, for a 4 star average.",1003104000,3,1253,4.78139534883721
37010,5,0780635299,"Wow...I have to tell you that as much as this was compared to other recent cocaine movies, like Traffic, this movie reminds me of nothing less than Goodfellas.  The characters are very much brothers from different mothers.  Very good comparison.  And to anyone who has entertained notions about Penelope Cruz' sexiness, you may be in for a rude surprise.
Having said that, since Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz are dating, well, doesn't it take a special kind of ego for someone to date someone else because their last names are pronounced the same?",1002844800,,546,4.849462365591398

The supporting cast members were excellent and more importantly, they were totally believable.  Depp does an incredible job of portraying an individual that gets caught up in making money the easy ""illegal"" way.  I am glad that the movie did not have a glamorous ending so people will not think there is an actual pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.  This film is rather long so I advise against watching it while you are exhausted.  All in all, this is an excellent flick.",1002758400,,620,4.531531531531532
37012,5,0780635299,"blow is one of the best films of 2001. blow is not traffic, ive heard the comparisons a thousand times. yes, they are both about drugs, but so is requiem for a dream which are totally different films.
johnny depp is, as always, incredibly good in this film. you can understand where he's coming from and why he does what he does. the reason for watching this movie, is not because it has an original story, it is because it has really good acting. i challenge anyone to not feel for depp's character at the ending when he ""meets"" his daughter in prison.
this is a sad movie, but it's not without comic relief, which is always good.
the only thing i didn't like, which isn't enough to ruin the movie, was penelope cruz. she's a great actress, but in blow she was a little over-acted on most parts, but again nothing which would ruin the movie, since she's in like the last 30 min. of it.
ray liotta is as always phenomenal, he seems to be just as good in every movie he's done way back to goodfellas, he's just incredible.
this movie has been compared to tons of movies that this movie really has nothing to do with. for example, boogie nights. they both take place in the 70s and they both have drugs. boogie nights was great (5 stars), but the comparison is lax, same with the traffic comparison. traffic was lack-luster (3 stars), douglas's worst performance to date, but im not going to go on about traffic.
blow is at least worth a rental, if not a buy. buy it.",1002585600,,1465,4.350364963503649
37013,5,0780635299,"BLOW is surprising - I'm not sure what I expected but what I got was a well thought out and well told story. Depp's character (George Jung) was very believable and for once makeup aged the key character without making him look like he was wearing a wig and several pounds of latex on his face.
The story showed interesting parallelisms between his parents life and relationship to those Jung grew into as he pursued a career of smuggling drugs and getting the US hooked on cocaine. Surprisingly I felt a strong emotional response to Depp's character and the effect he had on his family whereas I didn't have a strong reaction to the drug scene perse.
While covering a large and busy lifetime the movie never seemed to slow or stall rather it seemed move along at quite a pace - all 124 minutes of it.
A few nights later we watched the Infinifilm version (the first one we've actually watched) and I was impressed with the quality of the additional content and its integration.
Depp did overshadow the other talented members of the cast but didn't detract from the movie - I can highly recommend BLOW to anyone that likes a good story telling that provokes emotional reactions while making you think about what you value in life.",1002585600,2,1228,4.586363636363636
37014,4,0780635299,"This is a solid drama and action movie.  What makes it unique is that it is based on a true story.  The music is incredible and just makes this a wonderful drama and action film!  The music makes you re-live the 60's and 70's.  Johny Depp is outstanding.  Absolutely wonderful extras on this DVD, including an excellent documentary on Colmbia and COCAINE.  This movie carries a wide variety of emotions.  You'll be sure to be moved.
As entertaining as this movie is, it just goes to show how that drugs and self destruction go hand in hand.  Blow definitely exceeded my expectations.",1001980800,,583,4.647058823529412
37015,4,0780635299,"OK, so Blow doesn't support a huge all star cast, or an ambitious multi-angled plot, but to be quite frank, I thought most of Traffic was a load of pretentious, preachy Hollywood smarm. With the exception of Benicio Del Toro scenes (which were fantastic and well deserving of an Oscar), the movie had all the personality and believability of ""As the World Turns.""
Blow is much less ambitious in it's scope and cast, but what it lacks in sophistication, it more than makes up for in it's charm and honesty. That's not to say that facts weren't changed for whatever reason, but the protagonist isn't made out to be some herculean character. He's just a normal, likeable guy who made lots of tragic mistakes in life that lead to a path of self destruction. The movie doesn't preach or try to be all things to all people. It is what it is, and the people act like, well... people. What they do they do for their own reasons, not to further the plot. That's what makes the movie great, it's about people being people and all the stupid, unpredictable things they do.
Oh, it's also about drugs, how could we forget. But the whole drug aspect seems very secondary to the human aspect. There are no grandiose speeches abut the War of Drugs and how we should spend more money on treatment than prevention or anything even close to that, but it also doesn't portray drugs in a glamorous or friendly way. Drugs can never be human, and this movie portrays them as neither evil, misguided or liberating. They are what they are: just another inanimate substance with a disproportionate social significance.
Kudos as usual to Johnny Depp. After seeing the interviews with Jung in prison, it was almost creepy to see Depp mimic him. Depp does his best work when portraying real people like Hunter S. Thompson, Donnie Brasco, Ed Wood and the like. Depp goes so far as to adopt every subtle little nuance of a person making his performance completely believable. It was impossible for me not to sympathise with Jung, regardless of his selfish behavior.

The DVD boasts some great special features that I have only begun to explore. Chief among these is the aforementioned prison interviews. There is also a host of deleted scenes and a commentary with both the director and Jung. Good Stuff.",1001808000,,2273,4.6825
37016,3,0780635299,"Movie Summary: George Jung moves to California and discovers drugs. He is an ambitious young man and soon takes to selling pot. He quickly builds a large marijuana business and gets rich. This operation gets broken up when George gets busted and sent to prison. He goes to prison with a bachelors degree in pot and leaves with a PHD in cocaine. Once out of prison George hooks up with his former cell mate and starts building an immense cocaine empire.
My Opinion: The music in Blow is awesome. It is what stood out the most for me. It adds depth and excitement to the film. I was tapping my foot more than once while watching the movie. The story was engaging while I was watching it, but didn't stay with me after I was done watching it. It fails to make a stand on what it is saying. It shows George's life and leaves the viewer to make any decision. It leans towards showing him as a good guy who just keeps screwing up. I got the feeling that he saw his only mistakes as getting caught. Johnny Depp is excellent as the main character. He is very cool and likable. I have a feeling he makes George look way better than he actually was. I found Penlope Cruz and her character to be very annoying. Her character was suppose to be a reflection of George's mom, but I still found her lacking. Paul Reubens is great as the California drug connection/hair dresser. This should help his career a little. The story and direction are very stylish and smooth. The scenes that were removed help fill in the plot, but they would have slowed things down. Overall I found the movie lacked punch. The music made it good while I was watching it, but I quickly forgot it when it was over.
DVD Quality: Video: Widescreen Anamorphic 2.35:1 Excellent video quality. Sound: DD 5.1 Extras: This is an Infinifilm edition. This means that it is packed with extras that are accessible while watching the movie. These extras include: Deleted scenes that help fill out the plot, interview with the real George Yung (man is he ugly!), commentary, documentaries, trailers, character outtakes, and production diary. This is a fully packed DVD release.
What You Should Do: Rent it. It's a decent story to see once but it doesn't have repeatability. The extras make it a really great DVD release, but I can't see wanted to watch the real George Jung more than once!

37019,5,0780635299,"I'll admit the only reason I originally wanted to see BLOW was because Johnny Depp is in it.  I have been a fan of his for a long time.  I think he is so underrated as an actor, and for those die hard fans of his -- this is worth a viewing.  He is totally mind Blowing in this movie.  Words can not describe how wonderful I truly think this performance is.  If I could pick the Oscar winner for best actor this year, I'd gladly give it to Depp.
As far as the movie goes, this is a very fast paced, comedy/drama that has a lot of great music. It's the story of George Jung, who was born and raised in Weymouth, Mass. His parents dreams are shattered when he grows up to be a drug dealer.  Jung didn't want to work a real job, so he got into drugs and selling them as a means to make money, good money.
He is hardly a sympathetic character nor is he the greatest person in the world.  He isn't a bad person either, I think.
He made very bad choices with his life, and his priorities were totally out of whack.  The film goes through his ""career"" of being a drug lord and pretty much starting the cocaine trade in the USA.  It's a very interesting and entertaining look into the seedy world of drugs.  ""Peewee Herman"" aka Paul Reubens is also extremely good in this movie as one of George's first drug dealing friends.  This was a good role for him, and I think he did a great job.
Rachel Griffiths (of most recently, Six feet under) and Ray Liotta play George's Parents.  I am from Massachusetts and to hear the Boston accent so poorly acted out by these two was excruiatingly painful.  I like Griffiths, she is a good character actress.  I've never liked Liotta, he is just not a good actor at all in my opinion.
BLOW is a good rental.  It's one of the best movie's I've seen this year, and has the best performance by a male lead.",1001203200,4,1830,4.144475920679887
37020,2,0780635299,"Based on the book: Blow: How a Small-Town Boy Made 100 million with the Medllin Cocaine Cartel and Lost is All' by Bruce Porter, Blow is an overly familiar, overly slick, docu-drama of  real life legendary drug dealer George Jung's life. It's a second rate cable movie with Johnny Depp added to upgrade the package.  The film seems all set up to be an interesting character study, but the character is too bland to be very interesting and everything about the story is overly familiar.  The few opportunities the film sets up are squandered beneath the stylistic re-treads and multiple montages that we've seen used much more effective in films like: Scorcese's Good Fellas and Casino;  in De Palma's Scarface and in Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights.
However, you might find enough redeeming value in the film's good performances which include worthwhile work from Ray Liotta, Johnny Depp, Cliff Curtis (who too briefly plays Escobar) and  Franka Potente (the Run Lola Run star making her American feature film debut here).  If you can somehow overlook all of the recycled ideas borrowed from the Scorcese/Tarantino/Anderson/De Palma stylistic tricks and homage to great directors of the past book... you might not find the film the pointless waste of time that I found it to be.
That said the DVD does have some much better than average extras, the documentary on the effects of cocaine on Colombia is very well done, the interview with currently imprisoned real life George Jung are among the highlights.
If the subject matter , the rise and fall of drug dealer holds any interest, the extras on the disc are definitely worth seeing.  In fact the extras are far more interesting and compelling than the film is itself.  You can watch the extras integrated into the film via the Infini-film gimmick (previously used in the 13  Weeks, and 15 minutes DVD's) or Separately accessible via the menu options.  HINT:  Make the film more interesting by making sure you turn on the Fact File feature which will give you subtitles full of interesting stuff throughout the film.

37021,4,0780635299,"Ok, maybe my review title ain't all that accurate. Nonetheless, I enjoyed this movie immensely.
Its not perfect, treats some of the subject matter a little more patly than I would have liked. You would think a movie like this would be a film about the coke industry of the 70s and 80s. Instead, the film is a tragedy, Jung's meteoric rise to fame and fortune, his crash and burn, his numerous attempts to right himself, his numerous failures.
You wouldn't know it going into it, but this film is about a man (albeit through some illegal, immoral, and unethical means) trying to provide for his family. Don't go into this looking for the next ""GoodFellas"" or ""Boogie Nights"". It's a single-man character study, and as such (IMHO) succeeds admirably.
The ending of the film still haunts me.",1000512000,,788,4.717391304347826
37022,4,0780635299,"""Blow"" is a well done film depicting an era. Though the point of ""blow"" is kind of hard to figure out, it is an interesting movie to watch, and you find yourself mysteriously rooting for Jung as he rises and falls.
The best part of this film is the first part detailing Jung's rise to fame, and his doomed relationship with his first girlfriend. The shots of California and the beach are the quintessential way that we all wish it truly were.
Somewhat depressing, somewhat amusing, and always entertaining, you won't go wrong adding ""Blow"" to your collection. Depp is always good in all his roles.",1000425600,,597,4.6415094339622645

The whole story is great and the script is very, very well developed; fast-paced but never loosing its sense of order; the lessons it teaches about life and about destiny will impact you, mostly because of the great acting by Depp and Liotta; and the movies follows itself throughout with good music and greatly created scenes.

And once again, I am impressed with Depp's work, this time in the movie Blow. Depp's portrayal of legendary cocaine dealer George Jung is wonderful. He makes Jung such a likeable person that you don't want to see anything bad happen to the guy, even if he is waste deep in cocaine. Another thing I found interesting about this movie was its almost non-existent use of sex and violence. The story itself, of a middle class kid from Massachusetts growing up to be America's number one coke dealer with simple business savvy is so intriguing that it didn't need the usual drug-dealer movie cliches.

37026,5,0780635299,"With all the accolades of 2000 going to ""Traffic"", I was left with the usual disdain for an ignorant industry, public, and media.  Then along came ""Blow.""  Despite the absence of the same slick production and large celebrity cameos (unless you consider Bobcat a major celeb), this film is incredibly versimilar to the real characters and settings upon which it is based.  The film's basis is a major reason to praise it, it is not a moralistic attempt at presenting a pro/con, two-hour-exclusive on the world of drugs, it is the story of a real anti-hero.  Of course it does not hurt that George Jung is portrayed by the finest actor of our time, Johnny Depp.  But Depp is not the only one doing a stellar job, Ray Liotta and Paul Ruebens also turn out noteworthy performances and Penelope Cruz demonstrates much more talent here than in any of her other films.  Top to bottom, ""Blow"" is well done and well performed, but the basis in the real story of George Jung is what distinguishes it from other movies made about illicit substance in the United States.  A study of the real story presents an almost identical account to those shown in the film (check out the DVD for an even more in-depth depiction in the deleted scenes and a peek at the real story from the real George Jung) and this is critical in entertaining and provoking thought in anyone with the most elementary understanding of drugs in the United States.  This film should and does stand on its own merits, but it is almost unavoidable to compare to ""Traffic"", the Substance Abuse 101 as compared to this film marvel, which is more like a graduate course.  ""Blow"" is worth a look as both a story and a commentary, perhaps even to those who are not interested in the subject that deals with one of the most important legal, social, economic, and international dilemnas that we face today.",1000339200,2,1854,4.6109422492401215
37027,3,0780635299,"Johnny Depp proves once again that he can portray just about anyone in ""Blow,"" a story based on the life of George Jung the first American drug traffiker to bring Cocaine into the USA from Colombia on a major scale. Depp's style of acting is really anti-acting in that he literally becomes the part he is playing much like Marlon Brando, James Dean and Paul Newman who came out of the New York's Actors Studio. His style of acting is very natural, though with little of the seams and krinkles we see in Brando or Dean's performances. Depp also makes daring choices: how different can his chracter in ""Sleepy Hollow"" be from his character in ""Chocolat"" or here in ""Blow?"" Depp is the best thing about ""Blow"" despite director Ted Demme's dreary, lackluster pacing. Penelope Cruz who plays Mirtha, Jung's wife, heretofore has been a whirlwind of talent and sexiness, but in ""Blow"" she is merely drugged out,petulant and mostly boring. Check her out in ""Woman on Top"" or ""Some things about my Mother"" to witness Cruz at her best: earthy, smart and sensual like a young Sophia Loren. Franka Potente as Barbara comes off best after Depp proving that she can also play a kind, warm-hearted chracter very much in love with George. ""Blow"" only succeeds because of Depp and Potente and to a smaller degree Paul Reubens as Derek.

Having read the book by Bruce Porter* (higly recommended), I was disappointed how it didn't dive into the inner workings of the drug world. It kind of tapped along the edges and sometimes threw a little stereo-typical outlook on these illegal workings. However, the movie was extremely strong on ethics and morals. Johnny Depp gives a great performance while Ray Liotta swallowed the scenes with his stoic character. Penelope Cruz didn't and never has impressed me much. With her consistent portrayal of an average ""Latina-chick"" she has yet to crack through the envelope of being more than a person with an accent. She has yet to take scenes and have a presense. But she didn't ruin the movie by any means and for that the movie holds a pretty credible foundation. Now, The book didn't go deep enough into George Jung's feelings on matters. As for Demme's film, I do not know if his feelings are accurate, or just an artificially Hollywood-created personality  but by the end I kind of felt sorry for him. Regardless of the drugs and deaths involved. And regardless to the drug wave that he helped sweep into this country.

You really don't get to know George Jung as a person instead of a big drug dealer.  That is what this movie is lacking, characterization.

For those who like movies like Traffic & Scarface, this is a must see! For those that dont,I still recommend it. You'll love it! It WILL be a classic. And finally, to everyone out there, ""we""-Colombians, really are NOT bad people AT ALL!!",991008000,2,561,4.509803921568627
37038,4,0780635299,"Johnny Depp did a terrific job acting, while Penelope Cruz did not. This movie focused on one line said by Johnny's father when he was little, when you are high you don't realize it, and when you are low, you think you will never get better. The story was about ups and downs in life. Drug business as portrayed here was a tremendous wealth machine, yet very treacherous, riskier than all else. Johnny played a kid from a poor family with little education but a huge dream and much intelligence who went to LA, and searched for a new life of happiness and wealth. He soon found his dream selling drugs, it was the 60s. With friends help, he became rich in a short time. This first up seemed so attractive, so wonderful, that I for a while was confused about whether the movie was promoting drugs or not. The girls, the houses, the parties, the coolness, everything was perfect. But the movie then took a down turn, Jonny was arrested. The prison, which he fondly called as the ""criminal school"", kept him for two years. With friends made there, he started new ventures with the columbia drug lords after getting out. It seemed so easy, so safe, a plane, a pilot, and off you go, make millions of dollar everyday. His business became bigger, and was for a while the major dealer in US with his old LA connections. Then, Penelope Cruz came in. It was a very sudden thing, I almost forgot she was in the movie. The happy days went on. He smoked more, had a kid, old partner betrayed, got out of the business completely. From then on, what seemed to be a happy ending went down hill. He for different innocent reasons went to prison two times, the second time serving for 60 years. His kids would not talk to him, wife divorced. The movie ended in prison.
  It was a very fascinating story, better than most of the non-sense now days. The directing and acting was superb too, and with a meaning. I believe, with this condensed life from paradise to hell, people would think twice before they decide to be a drug dealer or use drugs. What I didn't like was that the story seemed a bit passionless, and didn't really show the ture nasty things that drug could do to you like Traffic did. (But the movie over all was better than Traffic). ...the bad actings from Penelope, the role she had was not of her type. But I do suggest you to watch this movie, get entertained and educated. I didn't want to give it a perfect 5 star, because I think there is much room for better drug films.",990921600,3,2476,4.392156862745098
37039,5,0780635299,"Johnny Depp gives an excellent, believable performance as a drug dealer in ""Blow"", which contains many very realistic scenes. The movie begins with Depp's character as a young lad being taught to do the right thing by his loving, caring father, who also teaches his young son about the facts of life. Depp's boy character also fantasizes about becoming rich, after seeing first-hand his parents financial struggles. Later on in the movie, Depp's character, now an adult, hooks up with an old friend, and they contrive on a get-rich-quick scheme. The two then hook up with another old friend, who is into selling illegal drugs, and the three go into business together. But, when things go dry in the U.S., Depp and friends find themselves heading for Mexico to score yet more deals, and eventually get busted, except for the third party kingpin dealer. Depp then finds himself in hot water and winds up in jail for illegal drug possession, much to the displeasure of his parents, especially his mother, who disowns her own son and attempts to kick Depp's character out of her life. Meanwhile, his father, although he too disapproves of his son's money laundering schemes, tries to talk some sense into Depp's mom, but the father's pleas fall on deaf ears. Depp's further travelled road does not get any easier, for he doesn't win any popularity contests with his young, school aged daughter, and at times, including his wife, played by the talented Penelope Cruz, througout the latter half of the film, and gets busted another time for the same crime. The ending of ""Blow"" is a must see, and its dramatic ending will most likely leave you in tears. So, with this in mind, I'd highly recommend a purchase of either the video or DVD, because the video stores pretty much already have a major hit on their hands, for sure!",990576000,3,1818,4.7746031746031745
37040,5,0780635299,"Blow is a movie that ranks up there with the best of the best drug movies and rightfully so.  It shows the story of George Jung, which has not really been touched on before in the media or in movies, and while some might think the story isn't interesting, I found it fascinating, sometimes quite sympathetic, and cool.
Johnny Depp gives possibly his best performance to date as the drug dealer, who started out as a pot dealer in California (then sending the weed to Boston and gaining a fortune).  Then after prison time, gets a newfound drug dealing venture- cocaine, which he supplies to America via Pablo Escobar and in the process of making 85% of cocaine users in the 70's and 80's, also became a millionaire.  But like a certain other film (best film ever) GoodFellas, this film gets the sad juices and flowing and even though some might think it shouldn't be used on a man such as Jung, it didn't matter to me.
I saw it as a really good look at the guy who tries to find redemtpion and in the process looses everything, but find out who he is and should be some day.  Brilliance achieved in great craft-like filmmaking, fine acting and a good script, plus a mindblowing soundtrack.  Exceptional cast includes Depp, Potente as Jung's first love, Cruz as his second and unfortunate love, Pee Wee Paul Reubens in his best role in 16 years as a coke and pot dealer and Ray Liotta in a swuitcheroo role from GoodFellas as Jung's father.",989884800,11,1439,4.498084291187739
37041,5,0780635299,"Blow is just a few weeks old and already it's drawing comparisions to such contemporary classics as Boogie Nights and Goodfellas, to which it's not entirely deserving of but the mere mention of those far superior films is flatterment enough.  Johnny Depp stars as George Jung, a small time pot dealer who after taking his first collar flees on bail and winds up serving hard time.  As it turns out prision does little to deter his appetite for his profession (that is if you consider drug dealing a ""profession"") and after five years inside he promotes himself to cocaine, which at the time was pretty obscure in the states.
The first half hour of the film deals with his humble beginnings as a child, which leads him to make a deal with himself that he'll never be poor like his father whose been made to live from paycheck to paycheck all of his life.  So as soon as he's old enough he flees to California with his lumbersome friend Tuna (Ethan Suplee of American History X) and the two take up dealing on the beach.  They're brought into the business after meeting a bisexual hairstylist with an antrepreneurial spirit (Paul ""Pee Wee"" Reubens), whom they're introduced to through George's girlfriend, Barbra.
Being as it's the 60's and the marketplace has exploded they move the ""stuff"" with ease, until they decide to expand eastward.  Getting enough pot to supply the New England states and then finding a way to transport it there proves to be difficult.  But George's ambition won't let little details like this get in the way of his dream of financial independence.  So he steals a plane, flies over the boarder, flies back, and lands in an uninhabited desert out in the middle of nowhere.  It's really very clever and given that Johnny's such a charismatic character we're rooting for him all the way.
But if things were always great for George a movie wouldn't have been made about his life.  He's caught with two suitcases of marijuana at O'Hare in Chicago and while he's out on bond discovers that Barbra's dying of cancer and will likely die while he's incarcerated.  Faced with a moral dilemma George does the noble thing (or at least in my mind anyway) and flees to Mexico with Barbra so that he can see her through her final days.  And upon returning home his image-conscious, money-driven mother gives him up to the police.
It's then, while serving out this sentence, that George meets up with a Columbian cellmate who introduces him to the world of cocaine smuggling.  As he puts it, ""I went in with a bachelor's in pot and came out with a master's in coke.""  After being paroled just three years into his five year term, George begins running errands for his new found partner which eventually lands him a duffel bag full of blow.  With serious money staring him right in the eye, he violates parole, returns to Los Angeles and discovers that the demand for his product has skyrocketed, now in the 1970's.  He's moves three hundred thousand dollars of nose candy in just three days.
So now he needs a Columbian connection, leading him into a professional friendship with the now infamous Pablo Escobar (vividly potrayed by Three King's Cliff Curtis), and the two team up to puportedly supply eighty-five percent of the country's coke (I wonder if that's including the handiwork of Ronald Reagan and company during Iran-Contra?).  Either way this is an extraordinary entertaining movie that since I've seen it I just can't stop thinking about.
Johnny Depp is nothing short of a marvel as George, keeping the ship afloat during the lulls in the story and breaking our hearts at it's conclusion.  You know you've seen something special when after watching a film about a remoreseless drug dealer you're wiping away a tear that you've shed on his behalf.  This is a superb movie that I'm convinced will only endear itself to me more as time goes on.",988416000,26,3864,4.716196136701337
37042,3,0780635299,"Is it Ted Demme's fault that Martin Scorsese came out before him? Of course not! But, we can't help but think back on Scorsese's films, mostly because we've seen what happens in ""Blow"" in movies like ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"". It's the same old premise with movies like these. Small town kid who grew up poor, decides that he will make it big one day. He later then gets involved with the wrong group of people. He or she finds that they can make quick easy money by either selling drugs, or getting involved in gambling or owning a casino, as long as they have all the angles figured out. Once they get a small taste of this new lifestyle they automatically want more, and there's always someone around who knows how to help them. Later we find that they now have a big house, lots of cars, meet beautiful women, and have more money than they know what to do with. There's actually a scene in this movie where Depp's character and a friend have a apartment room that is full of boxes and this those boxes it's filled with money! Now, once they get to the top, everything must crumble. That's the premise this film takes. We learn about George Jung (Johnny Depp), a poor kid who rew up watching his father work hard all his life, but it was never good enough for his mother. She would constantly leave them, telling his father (Ray Liotta) that they need more money. After seeing the way his father had to struggle George decides that that will not ever happen to him. He soon goes away to the west coast, it's here he first comes into contact with drugs, and it will ultimately change his life, for better and worst! George soons discovers what sort of demand there is on drugs. He starts selling his own stuff which he gets from Derek Foreal (Paul Reubens! Who actually delivers quite an amusing performance). As the film later goes on George is caught for carry over 600 pounds of the stuff with him. When in jail he meets Diego Degado (Jordi Molla) who knows a thing or two about the drug business himself. Once he gets out of prison with the help of Diego, George now is amazing importing 85% of all cocaine that enters the U.S.! To steal a line from Maxwell Smart, would you believe it? 85%! The screenplay by David McKenna, and Nick Cassavetes based on the book by Bruce Poter, which of course is based on the actually life of George Jung is amazing. The writters have managed to display all of Jung's bad sides and still have us at times pulling for him. The first hour of this movie blew me away! I enjoyed it so much. If I could only review the first hour I would give it 4 stars. It's not that the movie is long, but the film takes an unexpected turn. But you can't blame the film for this. If that's what happened in real life to George Jung, what can you do? ""Blow"" is a very interesting story that I think people are going to want to see. It's a well made film that had very good acting by Depp. It's not as entertaining as ""Goodfellas"" or ""Casino"" but it stands very well on it's own. And that's all that counts. A MUST!",987984000,,3035,4.326315789473684
