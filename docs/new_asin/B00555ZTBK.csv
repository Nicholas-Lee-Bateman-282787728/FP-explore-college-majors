4572287,4,B00555ZTBK,"Said it before, every once in a long while, SciFi picks up one for their Weekend Specials that hits the mark.

Like a blue moon, it's not often. So I give full props to the filmmakers: Director Tibor Takcs for guiding the featured players Michael Trucco and the incredibly delicious Kari Matchett toward a very respectable product.

It helps that 'Storm' was carried by a surprisingly adroit screenplay and a very decent slate of special effects, including the destruction of the Golden Gate Bridge. Nice.

And for some reason I really enjoyed the daylight meteoroid strikes; in addition to being very realistic, there was a sense of sinister purpose behind them. Excellent.

'Storm' is better than most disaster filcks by virtue of its timing, editing and movie-believable script. Directed with the right amount of action without losing pace, delivering the right doses of mystery and terror at the right moments.

This production is superior to others in the genre for many reasons, but one that stood out was that the filmmakers, and writers in particular, held back the big punch for the climax. Too often the desire to showboat the 'scary monster' defeats its purpose. You want the dark antagonist to be hidden from the audience until the very last moment - the final confrontation. It's really that simple. But I'm always dazed at the amount of movies, from a spectrum of themes and styles, which suffer from Premature Edification.

Unfortunately for them - there's no pill that will fix it.

Now, admittedly there were some weak spots - i.e. Cheap sets. But most were minor and forgivable. And there were only slight dalliances with clich, but nothing that would completely derail the film's energy.

Had a very good time with this engaging little B-Movie. If you're a fan of SciFi's Disaster/Monster/Aliens Weekends - I recommend it.

Movie Note: An excellent comparison of similar themes and budgets yielding vastly differing results, after screening this film, check out 2009's '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Meteor/dp/B002C6VMIE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Meteor</a>' with Jason Alexander. Then you'll understand why I gave this production four stars. <g>

Personal Note: I will never understand why some fellow motorcyclists ride bikes with highway/crash bars. The only time I ever saw a major (and truly horrific) bike accident was due in part to those nasty chrome plated ""road hooks"". Will never understand why anyone would ever choose to use them. If you're going to drop the bike - drop the bike. Better than completely losing control and having hundreds of pounds of blazing hot metal twisting and torquing off in every direction with you blending into it and then... yikes.",1327708800,21,2732,5.245412844036697
4572288,4,B00555ZTBK,"I too was pleasantly surprised as to how entertaining this movie was.

I was expecting the usual SyFy fare and what I got was a decent movie with reasonable and believable special effects.  The lead actor does more running around after his family than saving the world but that was neither here nor there.

The movie moves at a quick pace and the acting is pretty good.  All in all it was, as I said, a pleasant surprise of a movie.",1325980800,8,432,4.296296296296297

4572297,5,B00555ZTBK,"Although I did not get this on Amazon.com, I watched it on YouTube and LOVED it! Normally SciFi Channel makes mediocre films at best but 2 out of 10 times they make a really good movie and this is one of the two out of ten! Shockingly good special effects for a TV movie with excellent color, CGI, and locations. I still cannot believe this was made for SciFi Channel! Looking at other reviews for this movie confirms what I say when I say that this film is MUCH better than what the makers and channel normally issue. I would rate it PG for action sequences.

Whoever wrote the script didn't have oscars for best actors or actresses in mind, there are no real big names in this movie and it shows in the acting....Michael Trucco, however, did an outstanding job in this movie.
But I can't, in my heart, give this any more than three stars because of its less than believable climactic ending involving the final Astroid approaching Earth. It was not at all believable.",1437523200,,570,4.826530612244898

4572304,2,B00555ZTBK,"This movie has no ending. No ""This is how we are saving San Francisco"". Unless I went brain dead my brand new DVD is a good movie up to the ending or conclusion that has no ending. If there was a part two film that explains questions that linger from watching ""Meteor Storm"" then I can understand the way the movie ended but there is no part two film. Syi-FI channel usually puts out a good and interesting films. Even the garbage, boring movies will close and leave you saying to yourself, ""So that is how they saved Earth"". Amazon is sending me a return to sender label because this was like watching a $1.50 bargain basement, bluelight special from K-Mart. Someone please tell me how the movie was supposed to end. I feel like I read a book and come to find the final chapter is missing and you look for the same story and come up empty. 90 minutes of nothing.

4572329,4,B00555ZTBK,"I gave this movie four stars for the human element as well as the effects, the science of meteror showers, I am not qualified to comment on.  It is a fast moving adventure, the reporter was, well, unbelieveable, I liked the engineer camera person, technically, that had to have been the most powerful microwave transmitter I have seen to date. I say this, because having operated an electronic news van, the advancement in the technology was interesting. The frightening aspects of meterors raining down from space is unnerving, but who's to say it won't happen, it is good escapism for a couple of hours.",1386547200,,605,4.8173076923076925

4572332,4,B00555ZTBK,"So what else is new?

Meteor Storm/Showers.............whatever, there are lots of meteor fragments zipping through cars, heads, buildings, requiring very little in the way of extensive F/X.  And apparently, they show up like clockwork in waves.  Not so surprising, they are only attracted to one location in the entire world: San Francisco.  Think magnetic only different because this involves element 120, also called Unbinilium, which is a temporary designation as it's only a hypothetical chemical element but it is still featured prominently in this story.  (I'm not certain I needed that much of a scientific explanation because I wasn't prepared to accept the logic of this story in any regard.)  I just wanted mayhem, destruction on a grand scale, people running for their lives, screaming.  As a disaster flick, it's par for the course.  There are the aforementioned meteors plus a gigantic asteroid named Apophis on route to poor planet Earth.  Naturally, the military only have one solution: ICBMs.  The hero of the story is a motorcycle riding Colonel who loves taking off his helmet and posing dramatically (Michael Trucco).  He has a wife or ex-wife (Kari Matchett) or whatever, who shares a couple of kids with him.  As luck would have it, she just happens to be an astro-physicist with an attitude who knows just about everything about everything including element 120.  Their kids are dumb as dirt and require constant supervision and rescuing.  Happily, there's comic relief in the form of a vain newscaster (Eric Johnson) who coins the phrase, ""flaming rocks from the sky.""  There are a few sarcastic potshots taken at faith and hope.  There's not nearly enough destruction to suit me, but one landmark does take a tumble.  It manages to do exactly what it was designed to do, no more, no less.  I've seen much worse.

I'm keeping it to watch again because it's pleasantly hokey.",1379894400,3,1898,5.0256410256410255
4572333,4,B00555ZTBK,"You know, this is kind of scary. It is something that can really happen. This is a pretty good movie for sci fi and action. The movie plot's pretty good too. Hey, enjoy. Thanks.

4572336,5,B00555ZTBK,Very interesting disaster movie. It's not one of the most moving but it does have scenes that are truly captivating.,1369180800,,116,4.85

4572338,5,B00555ZTBK,This was a good movie. Action packed and I could really see this happening. Its scary when you realize how much can go wrong and how little control we have. I just wish movies like this would show other scientists trying to figure out the problem. I don't think we would leave a serious issue like meteors to just one scientist.,1362096000,,328,4.39344262295082
4572339,5,B00555ZTBK,"Meteor Storm is an excellent made for T.V. movie. It's strong male and female leads (Michael Trucco: New Battle Star Galactica -- and Kari Matchett: (Invasion and Cube2, also 24) are believable as estranged spouses struggling to balance demanding work and two teenage kids. Both have the skills and authority to help fight the bizarre meteor storm.

Matchett plays a Dr of Astronomy and meteorology (something like that) and is working with her college students at night to view a meteor storm passing through our solar system very near earth. The event is supposed to be spectacular but turns out to be shockingly dangerous. Instead of the ""amazing light show in the sky,"" the meteors break into small pieces and travel to earth, destroying whatever they hit, leaving only small marble sized holes. (Hint -- they'll keep getting bigger).

Meanwhile, Matchett's children are at the pier watching the events. Suddenly people are screaming, some being killed by the tiny meteors. The kids see first-hand how deadly the storm is. They find the daughter's boyfriend injured and the three stay together.

There is a third interest in the story between a news reporter and his camera woman. They play a unique roll in the show, ther reporter acting as the calloused, ""We need the really big shot,"" guy who becomes human. Other relationships work throughout the story with the military called in and working with Trucco and Matchett to find a way to save San Francisco from the next three waves of the meteor storm.

This is a family friendly, enjoyable story. It examines relationships, friendships, relationships with superiors, and just what someone will do to help another. There some holes in the story -- things not quite thoroughly explained, but suspend disbelief and have a fun time watching. Add it to your collection, especially if you remember and love the movies ""The Towering Inferno"" (this is mentioned in the movie), ""Earthquake,"" and all the other ""natural disaster of the week"" movies, this will fit your tastes.

Oh, and ladies, Michael Trucco is HOT! :-)  :-)",1356566400,14,2072,4.991304347826087
