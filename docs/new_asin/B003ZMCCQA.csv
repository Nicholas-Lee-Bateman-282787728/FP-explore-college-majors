4234930,5,B003ZMCCQA,"I bought Beneath the Blue because I'd seen some other movies and shows with the two main actors in them (Paul Wesley and Caitlin Wachs). I enjoyed both of their performances because they maintained the message of taking care of the dolphins and not exploiting our animals while creating an interesting and heart-warming story around it. They worked well with one another and seemed very comfortable and had good chemistry. The supporting cast around these two did not include many people I'd heard of or seen before but I thought that no character was wasted and that each brought something different to the table and added to the story line. Overall, I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anyone who likes a good story and enjoys animals.",1309132800,8,755,4.815384615384615

After several references to sex, sexy, and porn, I turned it off. I do not know who the appropriate audience for this movie is, as the dialogue was exceedingly bad - as far as I could tell, the best thing about this movie was teenage girls in bikinis so maybe it is intended for adolescent boys.

Kudos to environmentalists Kenneth Balcomb and the Natural Resources Defense Council for their persistence and the Los Angeles Federal Court ruling.

This movie was great! a perfect family movie.

I love and respect all of Gods creatures, but must admit dolphins are one of my favorite!  This movie shows the love toward family and mammal - and at the same time expressed the cruelty to the creatures of the sea.

4235049,4,B003ZMCCQA,"The dolphin, Kate a.k.a. Rasca, as the humans call her, is a disputed property, indeed. The U.S. Navy claims her, having trained her for their military purposes, as Kate, and wants her back, to the point of kidnapping the charming creature; a cetacean research centre, initially unaware of Kate's Navy connexion and now calling her Raspa, has done advanced intelligence and human-cetacean communications research with her willing coperation; and, atop all that, an animal liberation front wants to ""free"" her from alike the research centre and the Navy. The film essentially develops these narrative strands as well as the actions and incentives, variously legitimate and devious, of the humans who struggle over Raspa/Kate and who woo and flirt with each other. The results are mixed, but worth viewing, anyway.

This film (also known by another title, ""Way of the Dolphin"", being under either title a sequel to ""Eye of the Dolphin"") was well researched and planned; that becomes especially obvious in the ""special features"" that come with the DVD (at least in the Canadian bilingual English-French edition that I purchased, V.V.S. Films 1506). The movie really does take its subject seriously as well as for the sake of some reasonably good ""family entertainment"".

I had many encounters with dolphins when I was in the U.S. Navy, especially in Caribbean waters; the animals are wonderfully playful and friendly to sailors, interacting with  members of the crew by mime as they follow and even circle about their ship joyously as it moves through the water, at least at the speeds at which W.W. II vintage ships, such as the destroyer on which I served, plow through the sea. Dolphins scare off sharks, which makes their presence and vigilance around ships something of real tangible value to men at sea. Even then, back in the early 1960s (Kennedy years), the intelligence of dolphins was widely acknowledged and much further research over the decades has widened and verified to ever greater extent those early observations of dolphins. The two best of the DVD's special features go into this and other matters of scientific and Naval interest very perceptively.

What holds back this motion picture from full ""5 stars"" rating is the scanty quality of the dialogue and of the acting. Both of these aspects of the film are stiffly wooden, clichd, and rather juvenile. The plot, per se, actually is quite good and engrossing, with some surprises here and there, especially regarding what motivates the young Naval ensign (presenting himself to the family at the research station as a civilian tourist on holidays and as amourous bait to the daughter) to undertake his undercover surveillance and machinations. (He redeems himself by film's end.)  As for Raspa/Kate, she and the other dolphins are magnificent. The scenery is great, mostly (but not entirely) filmed in the Bahamas, as I well know from many visits to the Caribbean islands, and the film's colour camera work makes the most of those assets. So, ignore the stilted acting and dialogue and just sit back and enjoy this delightful film and pay keen attention to those special features singled out here as being of so much interest.",1398297600,,3194,5.053130929791271
4235050,4,B003ZMCCQA,"Caitlin Wachs could pass for Jennifer Aniston's daughter anyday!

Got a look at David Keith, who plays dad, you remember him from the Officer and a Gentleman days? Oh yeah, and Michael Ironside wearing white, does that mean he is a good guy this time?

4235055,4,B003ZMCCQA,"While this film was obviously lower budget than others, at least the script and the acting was well done. I realize that our military may have done some unscrupulous things in the past, but I grow weary of the unrealistic views/light that Hollywood paints our military to be. They were not so grievously off in this movie though. But the haircut of the young male Ensign was a tad long even for the Navy. And the plot of the female Navy officer to sell the dolphin to the highest bidder seemed far fetched....the thought that she could actually get away with pulling that off was a bit over stretched. Overall, well done script and acting. Had the actors been less known, I might not have watched the film at all.",1392854400,,713,4.492307692307692

4235059,1,B003ZMCCQA,Even with Paul Wesley thrown into the mix this movie was hard to watch. I found myself fast forwarding through the movie because it was soooooo  predictable.

4235091,4,B003ZMCCQA,"Beneath the Blue was a good, clean, family movie. The underwater filming was great and as someone who knows of a teen who died of a blackout I appreciated the warning about free diving.

I rented this movie because I volunteer a lot with ocean conservation efforts. Apparently this is a sequel to ""Eye of the Dolphin"" which I will watch soon to better understand some of the character backgrounds. There were definitely a few moments when I felt like the third person left out of insider information. But, overall, I enjoyed meeting the characters and thought all the acting was well done. Some of the lines made me roll my eyes, but I assume the target audience is young teens. I did wish some of the scenes between Alyssa and Craig would have been longer to flesh out their attraction to each other (I wanted to know what was going on in their heads more). Also, I had no idea how old Alyssa and Craig were supposed to be... originally I thought teenagers, but Craig is in military and Alyssa doesn't seem to attend any kind of school. Could they be older than 18? I don't suppose age matters too much, but this is one example where a couple longer conversation scenes could have fleshed out the characters. The romantic storyline seemed very choppy to me.... probably for the sake of the ecological message.

The ecological message in this movie is based on Navy sonar testing that harmed dolphins and whales in 2000. I thought this movie would show the scientist's campaign to hold the Navy accountable to better precautions, but I was wrong. This storyline is overshadowed by a rouge navy officer who wants to make a profit by selling one of the wild dolphins--who was previously trained to be a military asset (what?).  The ""villian"" rouge navy officer attempts to frame an animal rights group and overall the rouge officer's character was very awkward (can't say if it was the script or the actor).  The audience never sees how the two storylines work together--even at the end.

Overall a good movie. All the elements for a great movie were there, but a little more character and story development could have made this a great movie.",1314748800,16,2141,4.6534391534391535

8410628,4,B003ZMCCQA,"RELEASED IN 2010 and directed by Michael D. Sellers, Beneath the Blue chronicles events in the Bahamas when dolphin researchers clash with the US Navy over the latters sonar program, which is killing dolphins. Caitlin Wachs plays the main protagonist, Alyssa, daughter of the dolphin expert (David Keith) while Samantha Jade & Leah Eneas appear as her besties. Paul Wesley plays Alyssas mysterious beau and Ivana Milicevic his sister. Michael Ironside is also on hand as a Naval captain.

This is a stand-alone sequel to 2006 Eye of the Dolphin with Caitlin Wachs overtaking the role of Alyssa, which was previously played by Carly Schroeder. Caitlin is superior IMHO; shes just all-around beautiful, inside & out. The only two returning from Eye are the peripheral characters played by George Harris and Christine Adams.

In any case, this is a solid marine/island drama/adventure. Its similar to Into the Blue (2005) and Into the Blue 2 (2009), but less of a thriller and more family-oriented; not to mention the focus being on dolphins. Dont get me wrong, there are some thrills and even a crime element, but Beneath the Blue is decidedly mild by comparison, with a heartwarming cast of protagonists and a perceptible reverent ambiance. While this wasn't a major release its not exactly a cheapo flick either with its $2.5 million price tag.

Australian singer and co-star Samantha Jade performs the song that plays over the end credits, Whatever I Can.

THE MOVIE RUNS 92 minutes and was shot in the Bahamas (Grand Bahama Island) and Santa Catalina Island, CA. WRITER: Wendell Morris.

8410629,4,B003ZMCCQA,"I love Dolphins so I loved this movie.  After the movie, I researched where it was filmed and who provided the dolphins.  Apparently filmed on the island of Grand Bahama, Bahamas and dolphins provided by Unexsco.... who offer tours where you can meet the dolphins.  I'd love to find out whether their dolphins are, as Rasca is portrayed in the movie, ""free to come and go"".  Although I love dolphins I have refused to ever go to a facility where the dolphins are held in large tanks and you can get up close and personal; when you see the dolphin in this movie swim at great speed for miles, you understand just how awful this is.

I particularly appreciated the dig at the Navy Sonar program - I sign all the petitions demanding they stop this dreadful procedure as hundreds and sometimes thousands of dolphins and whales and other marine life is damaged by this.

Overall it was a good story, at times a little unlikely, but no matter.  The dolphins, the water, the overall feel of the movie is heart warming and good and that's what's important for me.  I enjoyed it, it is suitable for all ages and so yes, I recommend it.  If you love dolphins, please sign the petitions online to prevent solar testing, to stop tourist attractions that feature captive dolphins and don't support Sea World in San Diego who are responsible for killing so many dolphins and whales!",1506384000,,1368,4.573770491803279
