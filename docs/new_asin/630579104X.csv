On this DVD you'll find out why Voomers (not Boomers as so many beople think) go rouge in the first place, you'll see Golatia get a lot nastier, Nene do a lot more goofing off, but most importantly... You get to see the new hardsuits, which kick butt!",990230400,,290,4.388888888888889
1069989,5,630579104X,"BGC: Tokyo 2040 is a continuation of a great cyberpunk series Bubblegum Crisis/ Crash. This anime is telling a story about four brave girls fighting crime in MegaTokyo (everyone have their own reasons). Their 'crusade' is possible thanks to advanced Power Siuts they're wearing. There's only one problem - limited armour's power supply of and countless enemies to fight! Main plot in earlier series was berserker boomers (technologically advanced androids) - but only on the first sight. Everything was schemed by powerful yet mysteriuos international corporation - GENOM. In this bunch of new episodes our girls are still dealing with boomers, but this time their madness is caused by horrible work conditions and their treatment by humans? Want to know more - WATCH IT YOURSELF! Excellent graphic, good music and great story are undeniable advantages of this series. However, orginal Bubblegum is still much more better. If you haven't seen any of BGC saga episodes try to watch them from the begining (Bubblegum Crisis/ Bubblegum Crash/ Bubblegum Crisis: Tokyo 2040). You'll be amazed how good can be OLD, REAL ANIME!",989539200,,1120,5.227777777777778
1069990,4,630579104X,I just got this fifth installment of the new adventures of the Knight Sabers last night. I have greatly enjoyed this new rendition of the classic anime story set in Mega-Tokyo. This tape contains two episodes (EP11:Sheer  Heart Attack & EP12 Made in Japan) that supply additional insight into  the backgrounds of Linna and Sylia. There is also plenty of action when the  shorthanded Knight Sabers take on a gigantic military boomer. Nene finds  out a secret and the second episode ends with you wanting the sixth tape  ready to stick in the VCR.  Enjoy!,958435200,,553,4.768421052631579

Hay una nueva coleccion de BCG2040 con mejores graficos y muchisimo mejor audio, pero sin el doblaje en espa&ntilde;ol. Si quieres o necesitas el doblaje en espa&ntilde;ol, esta es la coleccion que debes comprar.

ENGLISH HERE:
About the items: If you are buying this in 2017 (or later) you already know all there is to know about BCG2040. I'll be a nice addition to your collection, or to scratch your nostalgia itch.

This collection is inconsistent in the DVD menu, and the chapter divisions may be better, but otherwise, is ok, on par with (or slightly better than) the BGC2040 you remember watching on a CRT TV in the late '90s

*** Two words of advice. ***

1.) There is a newer version of this collection, with slightly improved graphics, and massively improved sound (from 2.1 to 5.1). Unless you are a Packrat, the new collection is the safer bet.

2.) BUT, the new collection DOES NOT HAVE a Spanish dub. If you want/need the SPANISH dub, this is the collection you want!!!!.",1493251200,,1023,4.661111111111111
7894514,3,630579104X,Never grasp it's true potential but robot suit fighting monster robots is okay. Animation isn't mind blowing but isn't horrible.,1375574400,,128,5.45
7894515,5,630579104X,"In the year 2040, Tokyo is booming again after the great earthquake. Humanoid machines called boomers have rebuilt the city and it's better than ever. Except for 1 little detail. Some of the boomers go out of control and attack people. Along with the A.D. Police, the Knight Sabers are a vigilante group that destroy the rogue boomers. What these 5 women are doing is noble, but the police don't like having their toes stepped on. Despite that, the Knight Sabers are the best equipped to deal with the problem. They don't have any idea that a sinister plot is in the works. A plot so devious, that maybe even they won't be able to save the planet.

Bubblegum Crisis is really cool. The futuristic neo-punk setting is unique and the characters are awesome. This was one of the first anime I ever bought and now almost 300 series purchases later I have to say it's still a favorite. This anime is timeless. I've probably watched it through 50 times or so and it never gets old. There's nothing stopping you from buying and loving this show so go for it. You'll really like it.",1354060800,,1074,4.507692307692308

7894517,4,630579104X,"Bubblegum Crisis: Tokyo 2040 (2000): Vol. 5: Blood & Steel is the next to last DVD in the cyberpunk anime series about a team of four female vigilantes in cool hardsuits, fighting robots gone mad in the Tokyo of the near future.  Vol. 5 has lots of playing time, with five episodes.  The episodes are:

Episode 17: Moving Waves - The Boomer invasion becomes more than attacks by individual robots.  With Galatea now awake and communicating with them, the boomers are a seemingly unstoppable wave of mecha, fusing with any machine they encounter.  Their target: AD Police Headquarters.  Nene, the chief, and a low level engineer are trapped inside.  With communications to the outside world cut off, and the television media sending misinformation about the situation, what will happen to our heroes?

 Episode 18: We Built This City - Finally getting a brief signal out to their comrades Leon and Daley, who have to figure out what is really going on with only the TV News pretending everything is fine, Nene and the tiny group of humans continues to run from the encroaching boomer wave.  The Knight Sabers, still raw from their recent fight with Sylia, want to help too.

Episode 19: Are You Experienced? - The TV news can no longer pretend everything is sunny in Tokyo.  Leon and the remaining officers in Tokyo come together to try to fight the Dragon Line, Genom's massive underground power cables, which have come to life.  Since the Boomers no longer need a core to function, all previous weaponry is useless.  Even the Knight Sabers' hardsuits need remodeling.

Episode 20: One of These Nights - Linna, Priss, Sylia, and Nene have finally overcome their disagreements and are reunited in the new hardsuits.  But the massive Dragon Line looms over a now deserted Tokyo, the citizens having fled for their lives.  Only Leon and Sylia's group remain, Sylia confident she is safe in her heavily fortified building headquarters.  How can they defeat the Dragon Line when it is seeking to fuse with their hardsuits?

Episode 21: Over the Edge - Romantic tensions between Sylia and Nigel, Priss and Leon come to a head as they all face an uncertain future in the eerie urban landscape that was Tokyo.  International armies are massing in Japan.

The animation in this series is extraordinary.  The backdrops of an empty Tokyo are eerily fascinating.",1112918400,,2350,4.866498740554156
7894518,5,630579104X,"A year ago, I've been hearing so much about the Bubblegum Crisis series, including the new Tokyo 2040 series. When I saw the old one, I was not amazed. Back then, they didn't know how to translate an anime very well, and the action was pretty choppy. Finally, during my 17th Birthday party, my best friend Eric gave me ""Bubblegum Crisis: Tokyo 2040 Volume 5"" as a present. He should've gave me Volume 1 so I can understand the first part of the story, but it's still a good start ! Two episodes are included in the video. ""Ep. 9: My Nation Underground"" and ""Ep. 10: Woke up with a Monster"". When I popped the video into my VCR, I was very amazed with what I saw in this anime. The animation is top-notch. No flaws over here ! Just pure clean looking animation. The action is without a doubt, amazing. It totally surpasses that of the action of the old Bubblegum Crisis. There is even more violence packed in each episode and not to mention, some good ol' traditional comic humor, and an amazingly cool cast of characters. After all of the excitement I have experienced in this 2 episode video, I have decided I want to buy all of the Bubblegum Crisis series so I can understand the rest of the storyline. So far, this happens to be my favorite 2 episode anime video. Bubblegum Crisis 2040 rulez !",1006646400,,1296,4.381742738589212
7894519,5,630579104X,I think this was way the best becouse it had the mast fighting in it and the story focust on nene,1002499200,,97,3.6666666666666665
7894520,4,630579104X,"This series continues to get better and better and with the fifth DVD installment, the series focuses on relationships and betrayal.
This DVD features five episodes (episodes 17-21) and do things get interesting.  With the first few episodes continuing where it was last left off, Nene stuck in the AD Police HQ with a few of her bosses trying to fend off boomers, you have the Galatea and Mason storylines.  This is where the biggest difference between the old series and this series is evident.  Although Mason is a baddie, the true baddie is Galatea.  Also, the secret is pretty much revealed who the Knightsabers are.
People might be upset that the these episodes somewhat end the storyline for a few of our male bad guys but the concentration is on Galatea.  I'm enjoying the progression of these episodes and I enjoyed this DVD.
As for the DVD itself, the menu is pretty cool and the sound is great for a TV series.  Colors are beautiful in terms of video quality.  As for special features, as before....hardly anything.  Character design sketches for each character.  Not much.
All in all, I'm used to anime DVD's having squat in terms of special features and another thing, I know there are previews for AD vision series, but I guess I'm not finding them anywhere on the series DVD's.
All in all, a must have for BGC 2040 fans.  A great series!",994118400,4,1352,4.642857142857143
7894521,4,630579104X,"This fifth disc (of six total) is the most disappointing--but only because the previous discs were so good.  The chief problem is that it seems drawn out.  There's a lot of fighting, but it doesn't really go anywhere.  The creators may simply have moved too quickly toward the climax in earlier episodes, and realized they still had quite a few to go.  A second problem is the new hardsuits: they're clearly designed to be sexy above all else (they just *try* too hard to be sexy), and they lack the cleaner, simpler look of the originals.
That said, this is still a good disc, with important plot points revealed.  In particular, we see why Mason wanted to free Galatea, and how she and the boomers operate.  The artwork remains good (even if I don't like the hardsuit design), and there are some nice visual effects and interesting boomer designs.  Even if it doesn't have all of the magic of some of the earlier discs, you'll still enjoy these episodes if you like BGC 2040.  These are not BGC 2040's finest episodes, but they are an integral part of a good show, and they shouldn't be missed.",990748800,,1096,4.5561224489795915
7894522,4,630579104X,"This DVD is a great value with 5 episodes.  The girls get new suits but the action seemed to slow down a bit and the story dragged.  Still, fans will enjoy this set of episodes and the nice cliffhanger at the end will leave you wanting volume 6.  So long = )",990489600,,258,3.923076923076923
