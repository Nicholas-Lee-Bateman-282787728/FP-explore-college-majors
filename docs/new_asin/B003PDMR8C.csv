This pathetic megalomaniac is delusional and in total Denial--or else just a smirking con-artist. How she managed to trick Amazon into carrying this (and for TEN BUCKS yet!) is a mystery I hope never to solve. Pointless, stupid CRAP and boring, boring, b-o-r-I-n-g. I swear, I have never seen anything like this stupid inane babbling--doesn't even qualify for SoBadThatIt'sGood. Fat, unattractive uninteresting boring ""actors""--Lousily filmed in somebody's apartment. Bad sound et cetera ad nauseam--look, I'm not kidding. I hope nothing I've said is provocative enough to spark any interest in this total waste-of-time...",1362700800,,725,5.6
