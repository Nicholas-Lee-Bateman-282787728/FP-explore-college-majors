8341815,4,B001TK5WU8,"A band of indigenous tribes-people begin to camp out on the fringes of the land of a
European descended farmer, whose land was once the tribe's burial ground.

There are places where the film seems to repeat itself, and could probably have
been tighter, but the deliberate, hypnotizing pace helps captures the more
spiritual life of the natives.

Some of the conflicts are obvious.  What's more interesting is the curiosity
and attraction each side also holds for the other in counterpoint to the anger
and mistrust.  Specifically sexually, but also as human beings.

The head of the European farm is a bit of a caricature, but many of the other
characters are surprisingly complex for a film of such sparse dialogue and
ultimately simple story.

This didn't blow me away emotionally, the way I think it was intended to.  I
could see the political points coming a mile off.  But as a document on how
the clash of two cultures leaves marks and changes on both, it's pretty impressive.",1324512000,2,983,4.775147928994083

8341817,4,B001TK5WU8,"I got this as I have a Brazillian friend, who I thought would enjoy it, he preferred watching 'Up' he later told me. Well I like 'Up'too, but this is way different.
This is a really unusual film for many reasons and all of them good. It tries to convey the seemingly hopeless plight of one of the indigenous ""Indian"" tribes in Brazil (as they are referred to in Brazil) the Guarani-Kaiowa, to give them their full title.

They want to get back to their roots which are tied up in their ancestral land, and so leave the reservation, which they feel they must do or all the future holds is death. Their lands have been taken and turned into farm land and they are clearly not welcome.

Their struggle to make sense of the new world whilst wanting to have one foot and preferably both firmly planted in what was clearly a better past is boiled down into the microcosm of this small band.

They are portrayed as regular people and not the freak show that is often the depiction of indigenous and 'non westernised' peoples. I think a lot of this is down to the excellent work of Marco Bechis whose vision and direction is responsible for the film.

Amazingly this was shot in just ten weeks with an entire cast on non actors and with no script, but as mentioned earlier this adds to the authenticity and quirkiness of the film. It is miles away from the much more famous 'City of God'City Of God (Cidade De Deus) [DVD] [2003] which is how a lot of people think of Brazil, that or street parties such as Mardi Gras. But as Brazil moves ever closer to becoming the world's fifth largest economy, films such as this become ever more important. On reflection 4.5 stars would have probably been fairer, but this will not be a film to everyone's tastes. This is not an action, thriller etc. But it is moving, thought provoking revealing and it treats the viewer as an intelligent individual and does not preach, well not until the end when it asks for contributions to the 'survival' appeal, but by that time you will be converted to their very real and deserving cause.",1302566400,2,2059,4.453580901856764
