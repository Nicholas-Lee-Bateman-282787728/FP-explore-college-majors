1900755,5,B0000A1HVR,"Finally, a break for the usual whiney, silly girl, magical situations, mecha loaded anime that is out there.  Hana Yori Dango or Boys over Flowers is a school setting drama about a young girl trying to fit in yet remain true to herself at any cost.  The series will hook you in by the first episode.
Based on a hugely popular Manga in Japan, and most of Asia, HYD follows the adventure of Tsukushi Makino, a poor girl from the wrong side of the track who enters the Elite School of Eitoku. Her one wish is to pass the two years she has left in high school quietly and unnoticed.  If that happened, this series would only be only an ova.  Eitoku is a miniature society ruled by the intimidation of the most powerful sons of Japan, Sojirou Nishikado, Akira Mimakasa, Rui Hanazawa and their volatile leader Tsukasa Domyouji.  Collectively they call themselves the F4 or the Flowery Four.  Lame name for really tough guys. (Looking beyond that, you see that it's a metaphor for the story.  Tsukushi's name is a horsetail weed in Japan.  Therefore she is a weed among flowers) Within 10 minutes in the anime, Tsukushi brings herself to the attention of the F4 by standing up to them while they bully her friend.  Unable to standby and watch as the rich and powerful flaunt their wealth and mock those of lower status, Tsukushi insults the F4 infront of the student body.  Only after she has opened her mouth and finished her insults, the realization of what she had done sinks in, and the battle begins.
The anime is a softer palette of color than most shoujo anime.  Opting for more earth toned, the colors fit for the mood of the story.  This is not a bubble gum romance. The characters are presented in a realistic setting facing problems of fitting in and dealing with peers and hazing.  The story line varies from funny to serious and the colors seem to go with the themes.
The music tends to go towards the melodramatic.  I simply turn down the volume at times.  The music theme reminds me of 1950 sitcoms. The music does help enhance certain moods quite successfully.  On a whole, the music is not very memorable. It's the story lines that makes this Anime move along.  After one episode ends, you can't wait to see what will happen next.  (Sound familiar soap opera addicts?)
As in most anime that is based on manga, a lot of information is lost and holes in the storyline is obvious.  How does a girl like Tsukushi get into such a rich school like Eitoku?  In Japan, one has to take a test to enter most high school. In the Manga, Tsukushi scored high enough to gain entrance into the school and her parents make sacrifices to pay for her tuition. This goes to show that Tsukushi has a high intelligence.  Why does Tsukasa become obsessed with Tsukushi, you'll understand when you meet his sister Tsubaki.  Why do the other F3 help her while Tsukasa continues to harrass her...they're more mature than him.  Why should you watch this?  For one hell of an emotional roller coaster ride it will give you unlike any other Anime out there.",1064620800,10,3039,4.523809523809524
1900756,5,B0000A1HVR,"Knowing precious little about this series, I jumped into it based on a friend's recommendation. And what an outstanding series it is. I was immediately hooked. We have a completely satisfying story based on one the more impressionable characters I have seen as of late. The orchestral based music is absolutely sweet and gorgeous, befitting the style and mood of this series. This shojou is right up there in the ranks of Marmalade Boy, Kodomo No Omocha, Kare Kano, Fruits Basket, KOR in depth of story telling, character and plot development. with well written scripts. Very highly recommended!",1061596800,5,595,5.081632653061225

7995346,5,B0000A1HVR,"This is one of those rare anime's that is truely a diamond in the rough.  I was rather hesitant to watch it, not being fond of the overly girly Shoujo genre, but gave it a try anyway, I have a soft spot for a little romance.  To my surprise, I found Makino Tsukushi to be everything I imagined a good female lead character should be: strong-willed, independant, cheeky, and flawed, and I found myself able to relate to her imediately.  If you're looking for a good-natured anime without the abundance of violence, foul language, and nudity that is so common in anime (not that I'm against any of it completely) with a message, Hana Yori Dango (Boys over Flowers) is for you.",1260230400,,674,4.508196721311475
7995347,5,B0000A1HVR,"I've started watching Boys Over Flowers in the summer of 2003. Got in it, couldn't get out. I'm about to finish collecting the whole series. You don't want to miss out on the anime series. It's just anime, but once you watch it. It will bring you memories both bad and good memories and make you rethink thoughts over. It's one of the many different and not too popular stories you hear everythime.  It's cheap at discountanimedvd.com. So I recommend it for all who's love and or love romance. It's one series you'll never forget.",1128729600,,530,4.578947368421052
7995348,5,B0000A1HVR,"I saw it on sale one day and just decided to try it.  The next day I ordered the following six volumes.  It is a sweet, yet slightly corny, show that is all about following your heart, even if it is sending mixed signals!  If you like something that is romantic and bold, this is an anime for you.  But if you are looking for something full of adventure with a side of love, then skip this and head on over to Fushigi Yuugi!",1095292800,4,424,4.011904761904762
7995349,3,B0000A1HVR,"Bought DVDs in this series on a whim and I am definitely liking the story. The only problem I have is that the translations could and should have been done better. I'm a subtitle-only anime fan so this is of particular importance to me.

First problem I had...no subtitles provided for the opening/closing songs which I've never seen any other anime DVD not provide.

Secondly, even though I'm far from being fluent in Japanese there were any number of places where I could easily tell that the translations were inaccurate, or did not capture the meaning of the moment, or were just plain wrong.

Thirdly, there were not any translations of the Hiragana and Kanji writings that were sometimes viewable during the episodes. The option was supposedly available on the DVD, but it was mutually exclusive from the subtitles and I could never get them to work.

Finally, I implore VIZ to stop ""western-izing"" the subtitles. Don't constantly replace the use of a family name with a first name (i.e. when it's Makino say it's Makino...don't say it's Tsukushi!). Don't alter the meanings of situations by adding in English words that aren't really there...this was particularly annoying thing to do to try and explain away all of the Kanji mistakes that Doumyouji was making. Just provide a direct of a translation as possible and give explanations where necessary if something might not make sense to a non-Japanese. Take a look at the series ""Kimagure Orange Road"" by Animeigo to see how subtitles should be done.",1091318400,9,1508,4.901960784313726
7995350,5,B0000A1HVR,"The Amazon editorial review does not do this series justice...the parts of the show that they consider ""plot gaps"" are, in fact, logically explained as the series progresses.  I've been watching anime for over 10 years, and I have seen this entire series (fansubbed), and I can safely say that Hana Yori Dango, aka Boys Over Flowers, is easily tied for top position as my favorite anime series.
The (melo)drama level can be very high at times, but the believability is always there, because the characters act in realistic ways.  As time goes on throughout this series, the main characters all develop in a complex and realistic manner, which always leaves the viewer both facinated and curious.
The music, played throughout, is perfect...quirky and happy at times, but almost always with a vaguely melancholy air, as if echoing the tired determination of the main character, Tsukushi.
The Viz translation isn't perfect, and they have a habit of switching the first and last names around in the subtitles to ""Americanize"" them, which can be a bit odd...even if you don't know Japanese, it's pretty obvious when you get familiar with the names, and they're saying one thing and you're reading another.  Nevertheless, this show is so fun, so engrossing, so facinating, that they could do an absolutely terrible job with the subtitles (which they don't), and it would still be a bargain at twice the price.
This is simply a must-buy for any serious anime fan.",1080432000,2,1456,4.9346938775510205
7995351,5,B0000A1HVR,"I have had the good fortune of seeing the entire series of Hana Yori Dango. I own it on fansub. When I finally got through the final episode, I realized that I had enjoyed it more than any other anime series I've seen. If you are hesitant to watch it because of the shoujo stigma, you really HAVE to give it a chance. I'm a 26 year old male, and I feel no shame in saying that this show was just the greatest thrill I've had watching anime. It's actually not quite like other shoujo series that I've seen, like Marmalade Boy and To Heart for example. Romance isn't really the central theme for most of the series, as it is more about Tsukushi's trials and tribulations in school. Of course, there is romance in this show, and it just wouldn't be as good without it. You see, this show does one thing phenomenally well that almost no anime does right: character development. By the end of the show, you will care about the characters, deeply. I think the reason shoujo anime is so appealing to me and others is because you really get to know the characters and feel like they are friends. You just don't get that in run of the mill anime, and certainly not in regular TV shows. If you are sick of seeing walking stereotypes in anime, you really need to see Hana Yori Dango to see a truly engaging series. Another thing I love about this show - it's intelligent. It will make you think. The characters in Hana Yori Dango are not ""good"" and ""bad"", they have a little bit of both in them, just like real people (imagine that!) There are no easy answers in Hana Yori Dango - Tsukushi, and all the other characters, make mistakes and do terrible things at times. There are some episodes that utterly shocked me, and I that almost never happens to me anymore. You see, even though the bad things that happened in Hana Yori Dango weren't as gruesome or outlandish as the things that happen in, say, Berzerk, it is much more shocking because they are happening to people that I cared about. Hana Yori Dango is, simply, a slice of real life. To that end, it is the best anime I have ever seen. On a side note - Amazon, please fire Charles Solomon now! Why does a guy who hates all anime review the majority of it? The only time I've ever seen a remotely good review come out of him is for Trigun, and I mean, come on! It's as if he picked one out of a hat to give a good review to. I'm not saying Trigun sucks, but it's just doesn't compare to some of the series he's made his smarmy negative comments about, like this one and Key the Metal Idol, for example. I think everyone should email Amazon and tell them to get rid of that hack.",1078444800,43,2625,4.252
