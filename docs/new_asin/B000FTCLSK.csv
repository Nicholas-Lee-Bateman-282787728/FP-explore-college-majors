2585263,4,B000FTCLSK,"I am an old movie buff, will not watch anything rated above a PG rating,

I love collecting the oldies, have favorite leading stars, Doris Day, Cary Grant, Debbie Reynolds, James Garner, Gary Cooper (the collection now offered does not have of my favorite movies.) Clarke Gable, Audrey Hepburn, Lucille Ball to name a few. Thanks Amazon for being so prompt on your deliveries, and the prices are great.

I would love to purchase ""Magnificient Obsession"" w/Jane Wyman and ""Bundle of Joy"" staring Debbie Reynolds please notify me if these become available. I had been waiting for ""The Winning Team to be released so when the package was offered I jumped on it. Thanks again for being so prompt and great prices. Television has gotten to where it is not fit to watch, so I collect old movies for the decency and enjoy watching them. this may not be the kind of review you were looking for but, I just wanted to thank you.

2585264,5,B000FTCLSK,"An excellent choice of Ronald Reagan Films. Especially ""Storm Warning"" which had never even been released on Video. A very enjoyable collection.",1162684800,2,144,5.590909090909091
2585265,4,B000FTCLSK,"There are those who write off Ronald Reagan's acting talent as minimal, and his Hollywood career as a long list of 'B' movies, like ""Bedtime for Bonzo"". Nothing could be further from the truth, and ""Ronald Reagan - The Signature Collection"" offers the future President in movie roles that display his charisma, charm, intensity, and integrity, over a 14-year span. The choices made are all exceptional, and certainly worth watching (The only reason I don't give the collection 'five stars' is the lack of commentaries for any of the features other than ""The Hasty Heart""; certainly, ""Knute Rockne"" and ""King's Row"" deserve them!)

The titles include:

""Knute Rockne All American"" (1940) - Lloyd Bacon's sentimental, rousing biopic of the legendary Notre Dame coach became the signature role in Pat O'Brien's long career, and launched Reagan to stardom (with only ten minutes of screen time!) With script and actor approval, both Notre Dame and Rockne's widow, Bonnie Skiles Rockne, made casting difficult (James Cagney, the first choice for the lead, was nixed by the Catholic university for his liberal political stands), but O'Brien, a gifted mimic, could match the coach's staccato vocal delivery flawlessly, and with bleached hair and a false nose, made a convincing Rockne.

Reagan actually 'tested' for the role of George Gipp (Dennis Morgan was his major competition), and his natural athletic ability and likable cockiness won him the role. His 'dying' scene with O'Brien would become the stuff of legend, introducing the phrase ""Win One for the Gipper"" into the national consciousness.

While the film has glitches (the studio football uniforms don't match the actual game footage ones), and Rockne is incorrectly credited as 'inventing' the forward pass (it had been legal since 1906; his contribution was in using it as the major offensive weapon), the film, and the famous school fight song, have become a genuine part of our heritage!

""Kings Row"" (1942) - Reagan's favorite film, and finest performance, in Sam Wood's moving production of Henry Bellamann's 'unfilmable' novel. Much as ""Peyton Place"" would cause an uproar, a generation later, ""Kings Row"", a thinly-disguised version of Fulton, Missouri, Bellamann's home, exposed the seamy underbelly of respectability, with incest, rape, medical incompetence, and malicious gossip...little of which would reach the screen. What did, however, made for great melodrama, with a starring cast of some of Warner's best young actors.

While Tyrone Power was the original choice for Parris Mitchell, with Dennis Morgan as Drake McHugh, Darryl F. Zanuck, remembering MGM's less-than-stellar treatment of Power during the filming of ""Marie Antoinette"", refused to 'lend' him to WB, and the studio went with Robert (later 'Bob') Cummings as the idealistic young doctor. Reagan, who had seen the script, knew he'd be perfect as McHugh (the likable wastrel who would lose his legs, and nearly his soul), and lobbied hard for the role; his instincts proved correct, as he was unforgettable, with incredible chemistry with both Cummings and Ann Sheridan (unforgettable as Randy Monaghan, the love from the 'Wrong Side of the Tracks').

While Cummings' character is 'too good to be true', and his dialog, a bit stilted, Reagan and Sheridan, with a supporting cast including Claude Rains, Charles Coburn, and Judith Anderson, make the film a classic...featuring a spectacular score by Erich Wolfgang Korngold.

""The Hasty Heart"" (1949) - The finest of Reagan's post-WWII WB films, this Vincent Sherman-directed drama, based on a modestly-successful Broadway play, tells the story of a British M.A.S.H. in Burma, as the Japanese surrender, and the patients (led by likable 'Yank', played by Reagan) await transportation home. A new patient arrives (Richard Todd), a Scot wounded that last day, bitter about his situation, and in store for even worse news...he has only weeks, maybe just days to live. Under the care of nurse Patricia Neal, Reagan, and the other patients, Todd must come out of his shell, learn to accept his fate, and find redemption.

The often somber, yet moving tale, filmed in England, benefited greatly by 'discovery' Todd, who was brilliant in the central role, and would achieve stardom. Both Reagan, who had just been divorced by Jane Wyman, and Neal, separated from her love, Gary Cooper, while unhappy about working overseas, would match Todd's performance, and garner some of their best reviews.

The film was a hit (especially in England), and certainly discredits the claim that Reagan's career was 'finished' when the war ended!

""Storm Warning"" (1951) - In, essentially, the kind of 'topical' crime film that WB specialized in, back in the 1930s, this drama of the vise-like grip the KKK has on a small town after a reporter is murdered, has terrific elements of Noir, and some genuine suspense, until the predictable climax.

Model Ginger Rogers (in a role intended for Lauren Bacall), in town to visit pregnant sister Doris Day, witnesses the Klan killing (in a frightening scene of building lights going out, and deserted streets), but discovers the killer is her brother-in-law (played with ignorant malice by Steve Cochran). Despite the earnest pleas of prosecutor Reagan, she refuses to identify the killer, and even recants a statement that the Klan was involved.

But things begin to unravel, as Cochran attempts to rape Rogers, and the Klan bull whips her (both depicted pretty graphically for a 1951 movie!) Can Reagan save her from the KKK? Are you kidding? This is the man who defeated Communism!

Reagan's role is decidedly secondary, and the studio 'cops out' a bit, in ultimately placing the blame on the greedy Klan leader (Hugh Sanders), rather than the organization, but the film does have it's share of great moments...

""The Winning Team"" (1952) - In his last film at WB, Reagan was again teamed with Doris Day, in this glossy biopic of early baseball legend, Grover Cleveland Alexander.

The real Alexander's life was the stuff a great movie could be made from; beaned by a baseball, his head injury was aggravated during WWI, resulting in epilepsy and acute alcoholism. Despite all this, he'd make a comeback, becoming the hero of the 1926 World Series, and one of the first inductees into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Sadly, much of his later life would be tragic (dying in a flop house, in 1950), but this being the 50s, expect the edges smoothed over, and a happy ending!

Reagan is actually very good as Alexander (if the oldest-looking 'rookie' since Redford in ""The Natural""), as he captures both the pitcher's love of the game, and self-destructiveness that would wear him down. Even better is Day, as his loyal wife; their scenes together have a remarkable warmth and depth, and she captures the real Aimee Alexander's devotion to her ailing husband (she would actually marry him three times!)

With a terrific supporting performance by the wonderful Frank Lovejoy (as Rogers Hornsby), ""The Winning Team"" may not be the most accurate baseball movie, but it is one of the more entertaining ones!",1155945600,24,7102,5.139514731369151
2585266,5,B000FTCLSK,"While never having been a huge fan of Ronald Reagan either as an actor or a politician, I've been waiting for several of the titles included in this set to be released for some time. Fantastic that they're being released in the one well-priced collection.

Those that are the most anticipated for myself are 'King's Row' and 'Storm Warning', both long overdue in my opinion. There'll be a great many excited about the release of 'Knute Rockne', a definitive classic sports-themed film.

2585267,5,B000FTCLSK,"here's the rundown from Warner's Home Video press release about this collection.

The Winning Team and Storm Warning both come with a trailer and feature subtitles in English, French and Spanish.

for those of you wondering about why certain titles aren't in this boxset ""Bedtime for Bonzo"" came out from Universal. ""Hellcats of the Navy"" is owned by Sony.",1149292800,26,1103,5.209039548022599
2585276,4,B000FTCLSK,"I always loved Ronald Reagan both as an actor and being a great president. Let me start off with the excellent quality of this collection. It doesn't advertise that the movies are re-mastered but they sure look like they were. He didn't spend much time in Knute Rockne All American but thee time he was there was great as in all 5 films. I know this sounds like I am prejudiced in favor Reagan and I am. Be that what it may, I think you'll love this very fine signature collection of the late, great Ronald Reagan at a great price.",1369267200,,531,4.267326732673268

2585278,3,B000FTCLSK,"These are three of Reagan's B movies plus the well known films Knute Rockne All American and King's Row. If you have seen neither of the two then this might be a reasonable purchase for you. Or if you simply want a ""set"" containing Reagan's work, this would also be a good set. It does not contain Bedtime for Bonzo. Storm Warning is interesting Hollywood commentary on the US southern states before the civil rights movement had a good foothold. The Winning Team is a heart warmer.",1363737600,,482,4.551724137931035

2585282,4,B000FTCLSK,"Yeah, sure, Ronald Reagan was some great Thespian! Snicker, snicker, chortle, chortle. But he did appear in several really fine films. The most famous. KING'S ROW, a sort of prehistoric PEYTON PLACE, looks like fine old Americana, sliced the way only Warners  could do in the forties, and that's really something. THE HASTY HEART is an excellent adaptation of a play that is full of emotion and great performances from Patricia Neal and Richard Todd. It NEVER shows on tv and is a real gem, but very much a filmed play rather than a movie, and that probably why it remains unknown.  The real prize, and one that never was amply promoted or shown, is STORM WARNING, an anti hate-group piece that is the working man's version of STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE, with all the poetry thrown out and replaced with Warner Bros  whitewashed passion. Ginger Rogers is the Blanche DuBois figure who comes to visit her sister, Doris Day, and that hunky moron she married, Steve Cochran. It was made the same year as STREETCAR ('51) and the similarities are all there. Vulgarity replaces artistry on every count, but this is fun, and it's obvious they thought this was big social commentary. Definitely an update of the thirties film, BLACK LEGION. The other two are sports films, ROCKNE is fine, but THE WINNING TEAM is very ordinary, boring, bland.

The set is worthwhile, three really good films, a staple sports film and a dog.",1226534400,,1411,4.770491803278689
2585283,4,B000FTCLSK,"Warner does another stand-up job with the Ronald Reagan Signature Collection.  Some of these films are well known and a couple of them are not, making it a great collection worthy of a spot in any serious DVD collection.

8126420,3,B000FTCLSK,"The movie selections provided do represent the better pictures that #40 starred in with one exception, in my opinion.  ""Storm Warning"" showcased a mediocre supporting role only, and I think there could have been better choices for the boxed set (such as 'Hellcats of the Navy', 'That Hagen Girl' or several others).  However, none of the movies are remastered, which is disappointing.  In some videos, you can see how the film template used for reproduction has caused the quality to deteriorate.  Still, the boxed set is enjoyable simply because it is another part of our endearing 40th President.  It can safely be said that Ronald Reagan was a better President than movie actor, and I think he would laugh and then agree.
