8527188,5,B008ERNLSY,"INVASION OF THE REPTOIDS:  This movie is cool right from the opening scenes.  I love the way  Ol' Bob answers the door when the alien comes knocking. It's only an hour long but there are many good scenes; one of my favorites is the woman taking the clothes off the wash line and is confronted by the alien. Her redneck husband comes out the door without seeing her lying there and goes to the grill complaining loudly about wanting steak for dinner.  After watching this my 7yr old grandson, out of the blue, repeated out loud what he said - it was so funny.  Conrad Brooks gives a convincing performance as an old hunter.  The background music maintains an eerie feeling throughout the movie but also has a catchy beat at times.  This movie is one of my favorites.
ZOMBIE ON THE LOOSE:  Again, Conrad Brooks gives a good performance, but the movie itself is too dark and creepy.",1454371200,,879,4.484276729559748
