8287577,3,B001CG8ZEY,"This film was originally entitled as Buon funerale amigos!... paga Sartana (Have a Good Funeral, My Friend... Sartana Will Pay), and directed by Italian director Giuliano Carnimeo (""aks Anthony Ascott) in 1970. The film has a good story, where a town banker does whatever to pay a bargain for a property he strongly suspects has gold in it. Here comes our hero Sartana, played by Gianni Garko to settle things as they should. This film is good paced, with a good body count, yet little blood, something that makes it rather unrealistic. Our hero always gets away and wins all the battles in the movie. So, here we see a major difference with Leone and more so, with Corbucci traditions where heroes typically are beaten and even shot. The overall mood of this film goes more to the side of the typical American western than to the greedy Spaghetti westerns. Overall, the film remains entertaining and a good addition to fans of the genre, I give it 3 stars.

Technically, the DVD transfer by Suevia Films comes in nice widescreen format, with a very good image quality. Audio is available either in Spanish or Italian. No subtitles are provided. Too bad, as even Spanish speaking viewers like are not fan of hearing cowboys speak Spanish from Spain. I recorded a total duration of 92 minutes, not 95 as indicated on the case. Please, note this is a PAL, region 2 DVD. Extras are rather poor: movie records of Giannu Garko, Giuliano Carnimeo, and music composer Bruno Nicolai.",1422835200,,1475,4.739299610894942
