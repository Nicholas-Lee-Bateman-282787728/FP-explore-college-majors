8610824,5,B0016MXKEY,"Mostly B&W footage of two class acts, Jackie & Pee Wee, and their almost mythic cast of characters. Nothing new here, same old footage, same old boring narration, but still worth seeing. Seeing how it was in that summer of 1947, does my soul good. Back when the only real democracy existed in a Brooklyn ball park, Ebbets Field, a micro-cosm of Democracy. Immigrants in the seats, Italians, Jews, Irish, Blacks and Hispanic, trying to assimilate to America, and those same ethic groups on the field as a team playing for their fans and for each other. No two players illustrate this better than Pee Wee and Jackie. This stuff is the poetry of the game, the ""life"" metaphor played out before our eyes. I'm not one to get too corny, but their story is almost like a morality tale, I get a little ""misty"" watching it, and it DOES make me feel proud to be a kid from Brooklyn, proud to be a baseball fan and proud to be an American.  --- Lou Russo",1250294400,,943,4.388571428571429
