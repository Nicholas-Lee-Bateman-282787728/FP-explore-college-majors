8462434,5,B0058YPK26,This series was just cancelled because there were not enough young viewers.  How absolutely stupid.  If the critics did everything by age there would not be much on TV.  I think the people who decide to cancel programs should re evaluate there reasons and stats.  So far the list is almost all I watch.  Time for a hobby.,1337817600,5,321,4.4655172413793105
8462435,5,B0058YPK26,"A Gifted Man is/was a GREAT SHOW! Unfortunately,the studio execs seem to be under the delusion that if a show doesn't score HIGH RATINGS-it must be cancelled. They'll most likely replace it with another ""Reality"" show - NONE of which have ANYTHING to do with reality ( Playing to a camera is SOMETHING every two year old knows how to do! ). So,once again a GREAT show is cancelled,following many others: Lie To Me,The Cleaner,Awake....  Decisions such as these are the reason people stop watching Network TV and instead watch Cinemax,HBO,Showtime... Because these channels allow a show to gain a following.",1336694400,12,606,5.0
8462436,5,B0058YPK26,"This is one of the best shows on  TV.  I hope CBS decides to bring this show back in the fall. There are so many reality garbage shows on TV which they should cancel, not an entertaining show like A Gifted Man. A very good cast and good story lines. Every week the hour would fly by and I couldn't believe the show would be over.  If you are looking for a GOOD story and something interesting you should watch this show.",1331856000,6,420,4.097560975609756
8462437,5,B0058YPK26,"In the desert that's the bulk of what is being offered on TV, this show is an OASIS.

The writing and character developement is outstanding - the characters are 'real' people, not just someone's idea of what the general public wants to see - or thinks real people should be. Every episode has had me on the verge of tears by the end, (and I don't cry easily) - not because anything sad was happening on the show - although that has happened. But rather, because the writers have taken the time .....and have the talent..... to inject each story with honest interactions between the characters - letting us (the audience) 'feel' along with them, what is happening in each show.

The story lines aren't all fuzzy and cutsey - people are sick - some die. Just like in everyday life. But most of what is on TV these days makes me yawn and turn it off, or fall asleep from sheer boredom. This is a show I have enjoyed since the first episode, and I hope it will continue. Unfortunately, I find most shows I enjoy don't get renewed. We need a new rating system - shows that appeal to the intelligent, mature watcher don't usually make the cut. Wake up advertisers - it's not how many people have their TV turned on - it's how many people watching will buy your product, (or can afford to). (I'm not even going to go into the insane ads on the airwaves - some definately make me NOT want to buy a product or shop in a particular store).

I really enjoy watching the interaction between Michael and his dead wife - he doesn't want to accept she's there, but allows himself to anyway. She has been written as slightly confused about the whole thing .... why she's come back, what she's supposed to be doing..... no angel wings, just ""I don't know why I'm here, but listen anyway.""

The addition of a Shaman in the cast is fantastic - he's 'A Gifted Man' in a different sense than Michael Holt and a great addition to the show - a totally opposite side of the 'healing profession' than the high tech world of Michael Holt's facility. And in one show, he even makes a 'house call'!

These characters have feelings - and portray the medical profession in a totally different, and much more desirable light that most 'medical dramas'. For that matter (no offense meant to the medical profession) in a better light than a few 'real' medical persons I've had the misfortune to meet (professionally).

This season has just scratched the surface of the potential of this series - let's hope it continues for several more seasons.",1331510400,6,2512,4.485776805251641
8462438,5,B0058YPK26,"This show is absolutely fantastic!  I liked it from the frist episode back in the fall and it has only gotten better each week.  It is refreshing and different from most of what is on TV now -and I for one am glad for the change.  The plots are intriguing and highlight many different situations and rare medical conditions making it applicable to a varied audience.  As a medical professional, I normally don't go for medical dramas, but this show has enough going on to keep me interested week after week.  The characters are realistic and interesting and seem to be more human than many of the characters on similar type dramas.  The supernatural angle of the ghost ex-wife adds to the wide variety of things that makes this show exciting.  The character development is excellent so far.

It seems that most of what is on TV is targeted to the same audience and that the networks don't realize that there are many different types of people in the world with a variety of interests.  I have never believed that the ratings were an adequate indicator of what people really liked or disliked, but that may just be becasue the shows I seem to love get bad ratings or cancelled!  I really hope the network gives this show a chance and it goes to a second season.  I will definately buy the first season on DVD as soon as it comes out and look forward to seeing more of this fine program!",1330387200,24,1385,4.4563492063492065
8462439,5,B0058YPK26,"The CBS TV drama ""A Gifted Man"" stars Patrick Wilson as Michael Holt, a talented New York City doctor with an unusual problem: he sees and talks to the ghost of his deceased ex-wife Anna (Jennifer Ehle).

When we first meet Michael Holt, he is a highly sought after neurosurgeon running his own clinic, catering to an elite clientele.  He is also self-absorbed, emotionally sterile, and estranged from his surviving family, a sister with a troubled son.  His seemingly chance encounter with fellow doctor and ex-wife Anna outside a restaurant takes on shocking meaning when Michael discovers that Anna has been dead for a couple of weeks.  Michael will learn that Anna was running Clinica Sanando, a walk-in free clinic for the poor; he is reluctantly drawn into its operation.

Each episode of ""A Gifted Man"" finds Michael juggling one or more medical crises as he divides his time between Holt Neuro and Clinica Sanando, now run by the fiesty redheaded Kate Sykora (Rachael Lefevre).  Anna's unpredictable visitations challenge Michael's assumptions about his life, even as his new and less fortunate patients at her clinic open his eyes to the emotional side of his profession.  A strong supporting cast helps flesh out the stories.  A slowly developing relationship with the unhappily married Kate will further complicate Michael's life.

""A Gifted Man"" bears some resemblance to ""A Christmas Carol"" in the sense that Michael is being given a chance to change his life for the better.  The show really hit its stride in the later episodes, wisely not overdoing Anna's presence while forcing Michael to work through his relationships in the here and now.  ""A Gifted Man"" is highly recommended to viewers looking for a medical procedural drama with an unusual twist.",1330214400,15,1768,5.041237113402062
