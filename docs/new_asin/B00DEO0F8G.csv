8592648,2,B00DEO0F8G,I was disappointed in this DVD mainly because after the first few minutes the narrator's words didn't match up when he talked - it was very distracting!  I was also disappointed in the discussions at the sites.  I had hoped to share this video with friends but I did not do so since it fell short of my expectations.,1382313600,2,316,4.338983050847458
