4989271,5,B006H9VSPE,It tells the story of Wrestlers working them selves to something they love. Its Great! But i feel like it concentrated on just Lance more than it did on his team and or his brother.,1377993600,,181,4.2
4989272,5,B006H9VSPE,"This movie tells it like it is and you can not ask for any more.......  Since my team fell to that mighty St Ed's program, I can relate to  this movie.  It was just an awesome movie to view and every wrestler should watch this one early on in their wrestling.......",1375488000,2,265,4.1568627450980395
4989273,5,B006H9VSPE,"Motivational, gritty, real-deal depiction of ins-and-outs of wrestling realities. 11 more words are required to be written, 3 more words.",1374192000,4,137,5.9

4989276,4,B006H9VSPE,This movie showed my son who is a new JV wrestler what type of sacrafice and determination he could look forward too as a Varsity wrestler.  You can't just practice during season and expect to win State.  It is a year round commitment.  This movie motivated him to work harder in practice and understand what it takes to win.,1358121600,7,325,4.47457627118644
4989277,5,B006H9VSPE,"This film is a factual story in terms of the positive and negative experiences that are encountered on a journey to national prominence in an extremely competitive sport. Wrestling is a sport that involves a very special group of individuals, it's definitely not for everyone.",1352851200,14,276,5.155555555555556
4989278,4,B006H9VSPE,"I bought this video for our HS sons who wrestle who have struggled this year with cutting weight.  After a couple years of cutting, we decided that our second son is planning not to do much cutting next year and will get stronger and be able to defeat anyone at whatever weight he comes in at next fall, but for this year, we needed something to help him realize he wasn't alone.  My husband and sons sat and watched this movie from beginning to end and they were able to relate to all of the things that the boys talked about.  Some of the stories were very inspirational as well and after watching the movie, they researched both teams that were described in the film.  If you are a wrestler or part of a wrestling family, you will 'get it'.  Those that don't wrestle or don't understand wrestling will have a hard time with this movie given they don't understand why someone would put themselves through so much to achieve a wrestling title.",1331510400,34,944,4.433526011560693
4989279,4,B006H9VSPE,"Low quality, good film. Documents 2 tough schools and wrestlers as well as what the rigors of wrestling life",1455235200,,108,4.7368421052631575

4989281,2,B006H9VSPE,"OK seriously, as a high school wrestler, and now a dad, I don't get the moral of this story.  Basically, hold your kids back from advancing to the next grade sometime before high school, and they will be bigger and stronger than their classmates.  Also, the whole state champ coach using bear wrestling to train his team is a cliche at best, let alone animal cruelty.  He actually had African lions and Bengal tigers in tiny cages in Ohio as part of his animal show.  I think that movies like this glorify the abuse of animals and overworking of young kids and should not be on everyone's watchlist.  This movie did have decent wrestling scenes and commentary...hence the 2 stars.",1446336000,4,680,4.633333333333334

4989284,5,B006H9VSPE,"Great respresentation of the best sport on the earth. Details the true grit and dedication that all wrestlers endure...including the psychology of cutting weight, the hours put in during th off season, and the wearing down from the grind of the season. A must watch for both wrestlers and parents.",1431907200,,297,4.96
4989285,5,B006H9VSPE,Great documentary that my son and I watch before each season.,1426982400,,61,4.636363636363637
4989286,5,B006H9VSPE,"I've got a son that wrestled in high school, and is still wrestling in college, so I'm just into this sport. I've actually met some of the coaches that are in this movie at various tournaments over the years. One of the featured wrestlers is a coach now too, he's a real nice guy. So, I've just got a lot of ties to this movie and its content.",1426032000,,343,4.0588235294117645

4989289,5,B006H9VSPE,Great product!,1424736000,,14,6.5
4989290,3,B006H9VSPE,"Poor quality video and sound and as is the case with many wrestling movies, fails to capture the true heart of wrestling. Movie tended to focus on the more negative ie excessive weight cutting.",1424390400,2,193,4.705882352941177
4989291,5,B006H9VSPE,"My two boys started late at age 8 and 11 this year.  They're growing to appreciate the sport each day.  How it makes them feel about themselves both physically and emotionally, as well as how they see the respectability of their opponents.  They see other kids bustin their chops and sweating rivers and realize the kind of work it takes to just participate much less win.  Who would want to work that hard if there wasn't something profoundly rewarding in just participating?  There's no immediate gratification to this sport.  No mediocracy.  If you get a metal it's because you earned it.  But they have their days they want to slack off.  So, on a day they did just that and skipped practice, they were required to watch one of 3 documentaries I purchased about the sport.  Not crazy about the idea of essentially being ""preached"" to, they soon found themselves subtly interested in some of these boys lives. How driven some of these boys were, how strict some parents could be.  This particular film provides differing and often polar views on what means should be taken to reach the kinds of goals wrestlers want to achieve...thus leaving THEM (my boys) to form an opinion.  They aren't being preached to after all in this film.  There was even a little chatter for a few minutes after. Wrestling a bear cannot go without notice.  That's a good sign that the video can effectively communicate the struggles of the sport without discouraging kids from hard work and determination.  A lesson too rarely found.",1421539200,4,1513,4.765384615384615
4989292,5,B006H9VSPE,Good movie that provides wrestlers and their parents and coaches with sine nice do's and don'ts.  Really insightful when you take a look at their legacy.,1420070400,,153,4.884615384615385
4989293,3,B006H9VSPE,Good documentary. A lot of real boys wrestling and how they train. Recommend it to boys who are interested in  trying out for wrestling.,1419984000,,136,4.666666666666667
4989294,5,B006H9VSPE,Good movie/documentary of the true trials and tribulations of wrestling!  May not be appropriate for younger kids,1419984000,,113,5.647058823529412

4989298,5,B006H9VSPE,"This is a great movie that was filmed in Ohio. It's a tale of 2 kids: (1) This kid goes to a private school and has a helicopter parent who dominates his life. His only purpose in life is wrestling. This kid succeeds at wrestling, but you wonder how his relationship with his dad is not that he's older. The kid says in the movie that when he has kids, he won't let his kids wrestle. In other words, he doesn't want to repeat his dad's helicopter parenting. (2) This kid goes to a public school in the same town. He doesn't have a helicopter parent. This kid succeeds at wrestling, but makes a major mistake in his high school career that costs him a big title. He makes no commentary about his future parenting.

In real life, both of these kids when on to NCAA wrestling and coaching. One of them, (1) is also a professional mixed martial arts fighter.",1411776000,4,854,4.304347826086956
4989299,3,B006H9VSPE,"As a father who wrestled in high school and college with two sons who now wrestle in high school, we all thought it was about okay...  It is a low budget documentary based around two specific high schools in Ohio, and not a movie.  It does not go into deep detail but does mention some of the extremes that some wrestlers put themselves through, whether their driven by parents, coaches, and/or their own desires for winning.  It stresses the fact that to be a great wrestler, you cannot just come out in November and expect to start winning.  Training needs to be year round if a wrestler expects to reach greatness in this sport.",1411689600,2,631,4.508771929824562
4989300,5,B006H9VSPE,"If you enjoy High School wrestling, then this is an excellent documentary, as an almost 10 year wrestling parent I found this documentary to be accurate, factual and enjoyable.",1409788800,,176,5.103448275862069
4989301,4,B006H9VSPE,Great for a young wrestling  team to watch,1405728000,,42,4.25
4989302,4,B006H9VSPE,"If you have even a fleeting interest in high school wrestling, perhaps as a sport for your son, you cannot get a better look at the rigors and demands of the sport than this view of a full season at Lakewood High School in Lakewood, Ohio. The movie exposes the time pressures, competitive pressures, and physical demands faced by high school wrestlers as they struggle in the shadow of the mighty St. Edwards High School wrestling program just a few blocks away. You'll get to know most of the team members on a personal level and come to appreciate the struggles faced by each. Only one other movie approaches the quality of ""Pinned,"" and that is the movie ""Takedowns and Falls"" which chronicles an unexpectedly stellar season at Central Dauphin High School near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. ""Takedowns and Falls"" is probably a bit more entertaining in that it is better filmed and has a happier, more successful ending, but ""Pinned"" is probably a more realistic view of the sport.",1403395200,3,979,4.833333333333333

4989305,5,B006H9VSPE,"Bought this for my little brother, who is a wrestling prodigy. He lost his first match in two years and was a little bit disheartened. This documentary motivated him and gave him back his desire to compete and get better. Very inspiring.",1394668800,,237,4.666666666666667
4989306,3,B006H9VSPE,Its a documentary so it was ok. I expected more in a form of a movie but all in all it was interesting.,1389916800,,103,3.5217391304347827
