8264274,5,B001706GBE,"This is my go-to video to give anybody an introduction to the breed.  It covers everything, is beautifully done, and I never get sick of watching it.  A must have for the Icelandic horse lover!",1312329600,3,193,4.485714285714286
8264275,5,B001706GBE,"This video was my introduction to the Icelandic horse.  Before viewing it, I didn't even know what they looked like.  Now I am in complete awe of these horses, and their incredible history of surviving in such a harsh land.  They are very beautiful, and in this film we learn about how they are trained (with great care), bred, we see them as work horses and show horses.  We even see them being lifted with pulleys onto ships to take them to foreign lands.  They are most popular in Germany.  I did find it sad that in the past they were exported to work in mines.  They are not drudge horses in the least, and I think that must have been very hard on such free spirited horses who, we learn in the film, do best if allowed to roam free part of the time.

Now if a person is an owner of an Icelandic horse, this film may be too rudimentary for him/her.  But for a novice like myself, I found it an incredible and joyous experience to watch.  Well worth the cost!",1236988800,5,963,4.184782608695652
8264276,2,B001706GBE,"I'm sorry to the two previous reviews who really enjoyed this dvd. It was an ok video, but not anywhere near worth the $40 I spent on it. I'm upset at myself for buying it as that $40 could've been spent more wisely on something else for my sweet little icelandic filly. I learned some, but not $40 worth. Sorry.",1228176000,2,312,4.216666666666667
8264277,5,B001706GBE,I bought this on the basis of Steven Barber's review and wasn't misled. It's a beautiful introduction to the horse and its importance in Icelandic culture.,1219795200,5,155,5.0
