7485945,5,B0170Y5M6U,"I'm not particularly deep into coffee culture, but I do love a good documentary and this one is great. If you're looking for (or fearing) a film where people compare coffee tasting notes for 90 minutes, this isn't it. Instead it shows us what it means to be extremely dedicated to your craft (and for everyone in this film coffee is very much a craft) in a job where your work is lionized by some (coffee connoisseurs) and dismissed by others (including friends and family who ask you things like ""so, have you started to look for a job""?) The movie brings us into the lives of five talented baristas as they make their way to the national championships and shows us what their dedication to coffee means to them and their families as they try to win the top spot.",1447200000,3,764,4.425531914893617

7485947,4,B0170Y5M6U,I enjoyed this movie. It gives a thorough run through of everything it takes to compete as a barista from start to finish. I believe it's a film to inform people that there actually are professional baristas. The men and women in your local coffee shop may not just be doing it for the money but because they love coffee. I would reccomend the film.,1447113600,,349,4.384615384615385
7485948,5,B0170Y5M6U,This film is totally worth watching. It's a fun documentary that really sheds light on a cool subject. It's playful and will draw you in.,1447027200,,137,4.52

7485950,5,B0170Y5M6U,"If anything, this is not a ""How To"" type of a film.  You're not going to learn how to select beans or how to use a Chemex. The film is an acknowledgement of people, against all odds, pursuing their dreams and wanting to make a career of an establishment that most people take for granted.

It will remind you of your own dreams & goals and give you positive reinforcement to follow your own footpath.",1446940800,4,400,4.32
7485951,3,B0170Y5M6U,"Being a coffee aficionado, I was excited to see a documentary on the National Barista Championships. Sadly, the editing, pacing, and direction of Barista makes this a difficult piece to sit through. Instead of focusing on coffee or the actual trade of being a barista, the filmmaker fixates primarily on two particular baristas from Intelligentsia (it's supposedly dedicated to five baristas, but Eden and Charlie seem to be the real main characters, even though Babinski should be the real star) and has far too much screen time devoted to them musing idly in various talking heads (I'm not sure why we need to hear multiple meandering childhood stories, as it doesn't lend the characters any depth nor does it relate to coffee in any way). At some points, I wasn't sure whether I was watching a parody or not.

It was frustrating because it felt like the filmmakers had the raw material to make this a great representation of the industry, but the execution was deeply flawed. The last half hour of the documentary, where we actually get to see the baristas presenting at the National Championship, is the only part of this worth watching. But you could just watch the livestreams of the National Championships instead, for free.",1446854400,7,1231,4.889952153110048

7485953,5,B0170Y5M6U,"amazing movie. I am always moved by people, who go for their passion rather than money. A must watch for people who love what they do.

7485959,4,B0170Y5M6U,"As a barista, this film was fun for me to watch and very informative about the high-level barista competition going on... But the production of the film itself kept me from giving it 5 stars. It dragged on a bit too long in the middle, and some of the transitions were really clunky. I also wish we had a better view of the final competition (camera above the table so we can see their drinks??). All together though, it was a nice effort that makes me proud to be a coffee slinger. :)",1473206400,,485,4.225806451612903

7485966,2,B0170Y5M6U,"Eh, i wanted to like this because I'm a coffee freak but it was just way too much talking for my taste.  It dragged on in some spots and even when i skipped ahead to the actual competition, they were again taking. lol  Also I think the story-telling and following of each of the top competitors would have been better had i actually been able to relate to them.  But they seems a little too trendy and also oddly uninteresting- for being so trendy- for me to invest in.  two stars just for the coffee alone :)
A much better documentary on here is called Caffeinated. It talks about not only the art of making coffee, as told by baristas and coffee freaks, but also the origin of different beans world-wide.  this doc just made me want to re-watch Caffeinated and that's what i'm about to do :)",1469836800,,793,4.331081081081081

Four stars because this will likely be of limited interest to anyone not a coffee addict. So, not much fun for my wife, for example.",1467504000,,329,4.672413793103448
7485975,5,B0170Y5M6U,"Who knew there was a competition for espresso pros who'd be so devoted to capturing and embellishing the essence of that tiny bean they'd spend months preparing their drinks with the most exotic and unexpected of ingredients?. This documentary follows avid baristas over a period of time as they prepare for an annual regional,then a national contest. Not only are the competitors judged on their creations, they  receive points for showmanship, creativity and other qualities having nothing to do with coffee, making three cups for each judge in a time limit of 15 minutes.
I was completely engaged in the drama and humor, as I found myself hoping a particular person would win over another, and being disappointed when one didn't advance past the regional level. I think it's a fascinating  look into a sub-culture that's not widely known, and yet is so crucial to these connoisseurs.
Whether or not you like coffee, it's an interesting look into the science and chemistry of how these people meld ingredients into the concoction for which they are searching, often making many, many attempts.
I learned a lot about coffee, and I doubt I'll ever drink another cup without being reminded of the different layers of taste, smells and drops of ingredients in a single cup. And I thought a Venti half-caff, vanilla, no foam latte was complicated.",1467331200,,1344,4.9688888888888885

7486004,4,B0170Y5M6U,"Overall, I found myself inspired by the passionate people in this film about competitive baristas. This subculture of taste lingo and refined palates coupled with mastery of barring skills is simply mind-blowing. Who knew that spaces are converted and devoted to practicing for these competitions? I certainly did not realize the skills, beyond making pretty foam and tasty espresso, that were required at these show-downs. Combine the best barista with a creative presentation and an in-depth knowledge of coffee with a flair for the culinary arts and you may have a competitive barista.

I enjoyed the individual vignettes, delving into the lives of these coffee aficionados, allowing the viewer to appreciate the sacrifices each person was making to continue in their quest for top barista. I also enjoyed the scrolling updates of the baristas at the end, especially Babinski. It did leave me feeling like there was more to tell.

One thing I did not solely agree with is that yes, coffee is complex but not the most complex thing. There are lot more complex and difficult things such as quantum physics. However, I do really admire the barista's passion and making coffee greater everyday.",1457481600,,600,4.759615384615385

I saw how they see themselves as craftsmen and so do others.

My only complaint was the difficulty in following the story of each barista independently.
