741151,5,6303962270,"This made for TV movie was a wonderful surprise! The production is superb and the cast outstanding. In fact, I believe that it would have done well as a theatrical release!

I only take issue with two things:

1) This fine movie has never been released on DVD and it is certainly worthy of such a reissue -- hopefully with some special features.

2) I am a Mormon Studies Scholar and I purchased this video to get acquainted with what is considered one of the definitive, watershed pieces of period fiction literature commenting on Utah Mormonism from a ""Gentile"" perspective.

This aspect of Zane Grey's novel is hinted at but not explicit in this production - I assume to not offend the Mormons in the 1996 nationwide broadcast audience. However this aspect was a big part of Zane Grey's novel:

""Riders of the Purple Sage was written in 1912 to partly present the influx of Mormon settlers into Utah (1847-1857) as a backdrop for the plot (1871). The Mormons had built the Kirtland Temple in Kirtland, Ohio in 1831, and Zane Grey would have been familiar with the Mormon sect given that he grew up in Zanesville, Ohio.

Plural marriage was only officially prohibited by the Mormons with the issuing of the First and Second Manifesto in 1890 and 1904 respectively. In 1871, mainstream American society found plural marriage offensive. Even after the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act was passed in 1862, Lincoln had no intent to enforce it and the practice had continued. Therefore, Zane Grey described the distaste of the institution through Lassiter in 1912 only after the practice had ended.""
[...]

So Grey was not only attempting to write a riveting story, he was also attempting to voice his objection to the cruelty of Mormon polygamy - which continues to this day. Just consider this excerpt from the novel:

""I'd like to tell you why I'm goin',"" he continued, in coldness he had seldom used to her. She remarked it, but it was the same to her as if he had spoken with his old gentle warmth. ""But I reckon I won't. Only, I'll say that mercy an' goodness, such as is in you, though they're the grand things in human nature, can't be lived up to on this Utah border. Life's hell out here. You think--or you used to think--that your religion made this life heaven. Mebbe them scales on your eyes has dropped now. Jane, I wouldn't have you no different, an' that's why I'm going to try to hide you somewhere in this Pass. I'd like to hide many more women, for I've come to see there are more like you among your people. An' I'd like you to see jest how hard an' cruel this border life is. It's bloody. You'd think churches an' churchmen would make it better. They make it worse. You give names to things--bishops, elders, ministers, Mormonism, duty, faith, glory. You dream--or you're driven mad. I'm a man, an' I know. I name fanatics, followers, blind women, oppressors, thieves, ranchers, rustlers, riders. An' we have--what you've lived through these last months. It can't be helped. But it can't last always.""
(excerpted from Chapter 23, ""The Fall of Balancing Rock"")

Without these themes the story is simultaneously more confusing as well as less powerful and socially relevant. I can certainly understand the producer's decision to make this 1996 production ""politically correct"" but I really think that the movie would have been even stronger if he hadn't.

Never-the-less, this is one the best westerns that I've ever watched. I can hardly wait to buy it on DVD!",1219017600,6,3468,4.72682119205298

The plots became formulaic after a while?

As when the Italian westerns with Clint Eastwood came out,

I had thought they just couldn't do anything new in a western.

This one put a cork in that.

The book was first published in 1918.

There have been several cowboy bands named after this novel.

Loren Zane Grey has resurrected Lassiter in a continuation

of his father's work ( and was successful doing it because this is a classic).<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lassiter-Gold/dp/0671607804/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lassiter Gold</a>

It stands as characteristic "" American Literature"" as a culture:

like Jazz. The honorable warrior and his noble love are strains of literature

going back in time to the Greeks. The ability to capture

that feeling in a movie is very rare. This one does it!

I'm sure I'll watch it again:

that seems to be the test of quality.

It is worth watching again.",1177459200,4,984,5.217948717948718
741154,3,6303962270,"Perhaps I should not have read the book first.  The book was terrific: colorful characters, beautiful descriptive passages of the Utah country (as only Zane Grey can write), great story lines.

The movie, while hitting on all the main points of the story, left out a lot of detail that made the book so wonderful, and helped to tie things together. I was really disappointed. The characters of Lassiter and Venters, although heroic in the movie, were much more colorful in the book, especially Venters.  I won't go into any more details here (there are too many), but anyone who has seen this movie should read the book and judge for themselves.  The only reason I gave it 3 stars is for the actors, Ed Harris and his wife Amy Madigan - I've always been fans of theirs (and they're the producers of this movie) - but they really should've taken the time and made this a little longer movie (it's only 90 minutes) in order to make it more true to the book.",1148947200,,955,4.471264367816092

741156,3,6303962270,"Zane Grey had the unique ability to paint pictures through words of a world he experienced first hand in a time before television.  Riders of the Purple Sage missed a great opportunity to literally show the Purple Sage and create a pictorial reference to time and place. The casting of Harris and Madigan was acceptable as they appeared to be instrumental in bringing the project to the screen. However, Grey's writing is not at all comfortable on television, it is big screen, big, big screen and the environment that Grey so lovingly described all but vanished in the clunky directing and the overuse of dissolves in the editing process. David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia is a Film I would have suggested they try to emulate. Grey created balances of character and place and this film badly missed. The casting of the young couple was SOOO Hollywood. I can almost see the casting session ""but we need to attract a younger audience, let's not get too real with this and alienate the viewer and the Mormons"" Yawn!",1105833600,6,1011,4.744318181818182

Format: Color
Studio: Turner Home Video
Video Release Date: March 4, 1997
Cast:
Ed Harris  Lassiter
Amy Madigan  Jane
The rest of the cast: unidentified
The original story is about Latter Day Saints in the story by Zane Grey.  They are not so identified in the film version.

Lassiter, a feared gunman seeking the gravesite of his sister, who had a daughter before she died.  Upon coming onto the ranch of Jane, he finds a situation where a young man is being held by an apparent lynch mob for his friendship with Jane.  Lassiter frees him.  When the pastor hears about Lassiter's mission to kill his sister's abductor, he tries to kill Lassiter, who wounds him instead.

This is an interesting story by the old master of Western stories, who once lived a few miles from here on the Rogue River of Oregon.  If you've never read Zane Grey's stories you have a great experience in store.

741158,5,6303962270,"I cannot say how pleased I am that I succumbed to temptation, and ordered this tape. It is wonderful--will be one of my favorite Westerns.
I saw this film with my sweet grandmotherly mom, who is a big Zane Grey fan. She loved the film too, but she said she would have liked to seen two younger stars, instead of Ed Harris and Amy Madigan (real-life husband and wife). I quickly disabused her of her absurd notion that these two fine actors were miscast. They are wonderful, and give real and exceptional performances. Their maturity is an asset to the film. (I confess, I envy Madigan's ability to look so lovely and natural without any noticable makeup!) And Harris is an Oscar-nominated actor, to boot! They are both very capable actors, attractive and well-suited for this film.
The story is unusual in my opinion. A female (Madigan) is the central character, and she is a strong, independent person. I found her to be a refreshing change from the typical ""macho"" male-centered Western we are often used to seeing. She is a member of a close-knit religious sect (in the book they are Mormon, but the film does not specify). She is being pressured by some in her community to marry a particular man, who makes it obvious that he just wants her land and cattle. This fellow does many devious and underhanded things in his attempts to coerce her to marry him. A total creep.
In comes Harris's character, Lassiter, with his own agenda of revenge. He's a mysterious and seemingly formidable character, with a reputation as a dangerous gunman. He hangs around to help her out and to protect her from those who wish to control and dominate her. Lassiter also wants to glean some answers from her--things only she knows. And, of course, along the way, he develops feelings for her.
Henry Thomas (little Elliot of ""E.T."", all grown up now) does a wonderful job as a youthful friend of Madigan, and his romance with a mysterious girl is very sweet as well.
Another thing I kept on appreciating throughout this movie is the outstanding scenery. True, if the story had been stale or acting been bad, the scenery wouldn't have made up for it, but as it was, it was a sublime icing on the cake. Beautiful photography, all through the film.
This movie was gripping, had some pretty exciting plot twists along the way, and kept us hanging until the end.
Highly recommended--a good western drama and romance. I look forward to seeing it again!",1040256000,61,2429,4.664335664335664

I hope the movie sometime comes to DVD, and I wish one could purchase a CD of the score. Actors are well chosen, effective in performances. Obvious attention to detail of dress, speech, daily life and such things as value placed on horses, religious beliefs, and faithfulness to family and friendship bring much to the story. Ed Harris and Amy Madigan are great. Henry Thomas, Robin Tunney, and each other actor--especially G.D. Spradlin--are believeable.

The opening scene of the movie is absolutely spellbinding, equal in every respect with the scene from Lawrence of Arabia in which the man in black robes rides through the shimmering desert air and eventually comes close enough to be seen clearly.  Ed Harris powerfully portrays a compelling and driven character, by far the most thought provoking character in any western I've ever seen.

The Moab, Utah scenery was spectacular, lots of red rock, canyons, cliffs and of course sage.  The costumes and horse gear are authentic.  Miss Madigan's hair is spectacular and deserving of some kind of movie award. The house was just as I pictured when I read the book as a teenager.

7857132,5,6303962270,"I think the movie distilled the best parts of the novel and acquited itself admirably -- those who have not read the book will still have a good viewing experience and not miss all the extraneous information (at one point I was threatening myself to count how many times Zane Grey wrote ""purple sage"" in the novel).  I read the novel six months ago with the full intention of seeing this movie adaptation, now on DVD.  Of course reading the book first is recommended, as the viewer will have a lot of background information that a 95 minute adaptation cannot have.

As the novel was set in 1871, I was particularly impressed with the accuracy of the weapons, clothing, and horse tack used in this movie -- all very authentic to a pre1873 era.  The pistols were cap-and-ball, the Winchester rifles looked like the 1866 model, saddles looked like the 1870 stock saddle with ""A-fork"" (slick-fork) high-backed cantles.  The ONLY criticism I can render is that the gunsmoke was smokeless -- a necessity for clarity in movies; smoke produced by black powder from the cap-and-ball pistols used would have been noticeably thick (and acrid).  However, the lack of smoke should not really be considered a criticism ... it's just something I noticed.
