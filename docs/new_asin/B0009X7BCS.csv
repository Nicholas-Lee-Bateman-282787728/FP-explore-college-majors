8069325,3,B0009X7BCS,"If you want to watch a movie that depicts the media as the driving force for control of our world, this is the one!  Fairly predictable.  Michael York was wonderful.",1381017600,,165,4.466666666666667
8069326,1,B0009X7BCS,"Some movies I see, I wonder why anyone could greenlight them for production. How could a producer get the ""Crusader"" script and say ""Yes, let's make the movie""? Because the script is what ruins the movie. Half of the time it feels like you don't know what's happening up there on the screen. Bo Derek and Michael York and Richard Tyson and most other actors do their best, but they can't save the movie.

I thought the movie would be an entertaining low budget action/thriller, but it was just a mess of a movie, and failed to entertain. Not recommended.",1187481600,,554,4.54
8069327,1,B0009X7BCS,"Bryan Goeres shouldn't be directing films. After the infamous ART HEIST, he scores this media thriller. A B film made in Spain with terrible local actors, and Andrew McCarthy wishing he was doing Manequin 6.

The plot is ridiculous. A terrible waste of time.",1132012800,4,258,4.863636363636363
8069328,1,B0009X7BCS,"This is an average action movie. The story is okay, media companies try to buy each other to dominate the industry and hire hit man. Young journalist from America finds himself in the trouble and solves the puzzle. It is an action movie but action scenes are far away from action. If you really have time and really like the action then buy it, otherwise you are not missing a lot.",1125360000,4,381,4.380281690140845
