8226757,5,B000X2W7W4,"This is a really fun series.  Be warned, it's a very dramatic drama.  For those of you who don't mind having the actors over-acting a bit, you'll likely enjoy watching, but if you do mind then probably give it a miss.

There was only one problem that I noticed; near the later episodes on the disk, the subtitles get a little iffy and it's a bit hard to understand what the characters are supposed to be saying.  If you know Japanese that might not be a problem, but if you don't, then it's a pretty big problem.

Overall, good series, a fun one, with comedy, romantic, and sad elements.",1309219200,,587,4.348623853211009
