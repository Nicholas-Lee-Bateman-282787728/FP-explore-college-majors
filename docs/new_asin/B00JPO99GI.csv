6388435,4,B00JPO99GI,"A refreshing film that touches on the best and worst of humanity.  In the end, a ""feel good"" film that makes for an excellent teaching tool.",1426723200,2,140,4.384615384615385
6388436,5,B00JPO99GI,I'm actually cheating with this review. I am in the movie playing opposite Mark Ginther and going nose to nose with Roy Lynam. :-) Does my 5-star review still count?,1426291200,,165,4.533333333333333
6388437,5,B00JPO99GI,"Not your typical special effects, but it is what it is intended to represent.  A movie with a documentary feel and a message about what God can help you do and help you through, if you place your faith with him when faced with major challenges. We have passed our copy on to someone else to view with hopes that they in turn will pass the movie on to someone else.",1426204800,4,364,4.126760563380282
6388438,4,B00JPO99GI,This movie was filmed in my town.  We are very proud of the locals involved. Great movie.,1420588800,2,89,4.235294117647059
6388439,4,B00JPO99GI,Nice movie showing values for a change. Actually kept interested throughout the movie.,1416787200,2,86,5.6923076923076925

8652885,3,B00JPO99GI,"Viewing this movie was a challenge. After leaving my Church years ago after so much conflict, it hit home: emotionally. Yet I can not give my Review 5 stars. Throughout the movie, I thought ""that is one perspective"". In any relationship, there will be conflict. How it is resolved can lead to so much damage. I am thankful to see great truths displayed but less so to see real hurt and conflict portrayed like this. If I were a Pastor, I would have walked off when invited to a shooting range. Women telling their husbands what to do, changing bylaws like that. Sure this Church had real problems but having the former Deacon live but all gathered around his bed at the hospital and waiting for The Holy Spirit to move his heart and mind would be better. Grace was missing in that relationship. I do not think any One person can decide if this movie was good or necessary but I felt it to be over the top. Trying to fit into today's mind set of power moves. The ending gave me the creeps! This portrayal of one Pastors journey to try to save a dwindling congregation and Church building left me thinking ""I am so thankful I am not a member there"". The Pastor had his issues too.",1513900800,,1178,4.359090909090909
8652886,5,B00JPO99GI,"Everything in this movie has happened to me as a Pastor except for one.  Great film to show to churches when they are between pastors, or in Bible Study as a discussion starter",1512950400,,176,4.333333333333333
8652887,1,B00JPO99GI,Disappointing movie :(,1504569600,,22,6.666666666666667
8652888,5,B00JPO99GI,"If you are a pastor or pastor's wife, this movie will assure you that you are not alone in your struggles. Hang in there! God has a purpose for what you are going through; and though it feels like these conflicts are holding you back from accomplishing His will, you may be exactly where He wants you, doing exactly what He sent you to do. For those who are not pastors, I believe this movie will help you to more accurately understand the unique challenges and burdens your leaders carry.

This movie wasn't made with the highest quality of cinematography, but please don't let that hold you back from watching it all the way through. There's something for everyone to learn about love and unity within the church; so much depends on it! (John 17:20-23)",1503532800,3,754,4.5851851851851855
8652889,5,B00JPO99GI,"Thank you for making this available to view on Prime.  What a POWERFUL movie about the will of God vs the will of men.  I will make this one part of my personal library as soon as possible! Our Heavenly Father is an AWESOME God, as is his son Jesus Christ. May we all CHOOSE to walk in Christ's footsteps, follow His example and love one another as He has loved us. By doing so, our lives (and the lives we touch by example) will all be blessed more than any of us can possibly imagine. Those ""Seven Deadly Words"" will NEVER be part of my thinking or language. I strife daily to live by this motto: ""God is FIRST, others are SECOND, I am THIRD"" .  What a different world this would be if ALL leaders of nations followed this simple rule. I hope I live long enough to witness this change!!",1500595200,2,788,4.137254901960785
8652890,5,B00JPO99GI,I loved the ending! I also loved how the movie progressed. I liked how it showed the difficulty of a struggling congregation but related to leadership. I thought it shed some light on what it is like being the pastor of a struggling and dying church. It is something that is often not shared.,1500508800,6,292,4.425925925925926
8652891,4,B00JPO99GI,Good movie.  Deals with people's reluctance to change.,1500336000,,54,5.75
8652892,5,B00JPO99GI,Good movie with practical and spiritual messages,1485129600,,48,6.0
8652893,5,B00JPO99GI,Great movie for small churches. I attended one very similar to it. Helped me understand the inner workings of the people involved.,1477612800,2,130,4.954545454545454
