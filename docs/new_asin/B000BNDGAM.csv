8089244,5,B000BNDGAM,Sorry for the bad pun. The animation is first-rate. The story starts off with Bonkers getting fired from the stuido then he ends up saving the life of Donald Duck later he gets hired as Lucky's parther in the police force. They have to find out who's been kidnapping toons. It has a twist ending. It's a great story from start to finish. I give this tape a 10 out of 10.,1314662400,2,370,4.152777777777778
