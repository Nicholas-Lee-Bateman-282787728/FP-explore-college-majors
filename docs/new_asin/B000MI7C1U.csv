8169327,4,B000MI7C1U,I thought this was really good for a TV movie. I didn't know anything about the case before I watched the movie and now I can't get it out of my mind...I think the movie was better that way.,1523232000,,190,3.8974358974358974
8169328,4,B000MI7C1U,"This is certainly not a blockbuster hit but it was good. The acting is very good, the story was engaging, it's factual compelling.",1519948800,,130,4.695652173913044
8169329,5,B000MI7C1U,Very good acting.  Very sad story.,1517356800,,34,4.666666666666667
8169330,3,B000MI7C1U,"Although this was a well done movie, I found it frustrating to watch in parts.  It's a true story so you can't think, well, that would never happen. Unfortunately, it appears that it continues to happen.",1514419200,2,203,4.638888888888889
8169331,3,B000MI7C1U,"I worked on this made - for - TV film in the middle 1980s. I've been looking for a VHS copy of it for years but have never found one or, if I did, it was unreasonably priced (I've seen it priced at well over $40 - ridiculous!). I've finally found a copy under it's alternate name (My Sweet Victim) through another source (not Amazon). I'm currently waiting to receive it. I've only seen the film once (at the crew screening at the Director's Guild in Los Angeles) so I really can't review the actual film but I do remember that it was much better than most of the films I worked on during my time in Hollywood.",1350086400,7,610,4.177966101694915
