7993045,4,B00009UWE7,"There are two sections: Bogota (22 minutes) and Coffee (30 minutes).

First section, Bogota - altho like the other DVDs in the series, it has excessive attention devoted to things imposed by the spanish (painting, theatre, bullfighting, lititure in Spanish), you do get to see some intersting things like processing cut flowers for export

The second section includes picking and transporting coffee beans, processing them, sending them to where they are graded, tested, tasted, and repackaged for export.  (""Jardin"" is a town in the coffee belt.)  The Coffee section is of the most interesting sections in the 6 DVDs in the series I've seen.

A reminder - there are hardly any indiginous people left in Colombia.

Narration in Spanish; subtitles in Spanish, English, French, Italian. On the computer, Japanese subtitles are listed, altho don't seem to work. Good for learning Spanish.

This is the same DVD as the ""Enhanced CD"", which is actually two separate discs, the DVD, and a CD of music which isn't really my style.",1134086400,2,1023,5.053571428571429
7993046,1,B00009UWE7,"Unless you are from Bogota, do yourself a favor and stay away from this DVD. It's Bogota, Bogota and Bogota, and small filmstrips of other regions. If you would like to know more about Colombia, stay away from this title, there might be others out there that might be worth it. On a side note, this film was made by Spaniards, which probably explains why they couldn't get farther than Bogota.",1130803200,2,393,4.549295774647887
