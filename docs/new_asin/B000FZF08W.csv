2593755,5,B000FZF08W,"This DVD is mesmerizing, beautiful, and astounding. The postcard (motion) pictures from USA (New England, California, Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Hawaii, and Washington), Africa (Morocco, Tanzania) and Asia (Tibet, Bhutan) are breathtaking. - Louis Schwartzberg created a wonderful work of art. - I love it and encourage everybody to watch it. - If you don't know where to spend your next vacation, here you'll find some extraordinary suggestions.",1170201600,9,448,5.701492537313433

8127881,5,B000FZF08W,"After watching Oprah special on Louie Schwartzberg, I was fascinated by the image of nature. So I decided to orders a few DVD and OMG this is so peaceful and beautiful... I love it Truly amazing photography and scenery",1497052800,,218,4.615384615384615
8127882,3,B000FZF08W,"I guess I should have read the details of the item, but I was SHOCKED when the video was done in less than an hour! And too much of it was of the videographer talking about himself. Sure, the imagery is breathtaking, but for the price I expected at least an hour and a half of video. I feel badly because I asked for it as a gift, and now my mom paid too much for something I only like and not love.",1461024000,,399,3.819277108433735
8127883,4,B000FZF08W,"I'm sure this is going to be a great film. Anything by Louis Schwartzberg is going to be spectacular. This was a pricey(to me anyway) DVD. Normally don't spend $20+ for home movies. Just for other folks to be aware of, it arrived on time(early actually), brand new, beautiful, etc. It didn't come in the standard sized DVD plastic case. It's in a little cardboard envelope, about CD size. That's why only the 4 stars instead of 5. Not impressed with the sleeve/container that it comes in.",1457654400,,488,4.620689655172414

8127886,5,B000FZF08W,"The ""moving art"" series by Louis Schwartzberg:  ""Flowers"", ""Desert"", ""Forests"", ""Oceans"", and this one, ""Chasing the Light"" all showcase this filmmakers unlimited talent and ""deep feel"" for his work.  If you're into wild country photography and films, these might make you glad you went there.  Sometimes, one feels the need for excitement when watching films.  But sometimes, as I do often, one needs just to be taken out of here and dropped down into some beautiful, tranquil place or idea to spend some quiet time seeing things and places you'll never find on your own, no matter how extensive the travel.  There's always something new out there, something never captured on film before, and this photographer finds them for you.

These films have no - or very limited - audio, just sweeping visuals of magnificence; and while I think I know what he was doing with it in that regard, I do feel it would have been enhanced dramatically by a few sounds of nature thrown in here and there.  The ""Oceans"" is something so far out of the ordinary it's hard to describe, but ""breathtaking"" comes to mind.  The only critique I will offer is:  when viewing ""The Deserts"", how in the world do you need a caption insert telling you there are ""seals barking"" and ""gulls cawing"", and especially ""whales moaning""..! right in the middle of canyon lands?  I think the editing crew may have been hungover that morning..... but forgive it, for it doesn't detract from the beauty of the work.",1389312000,,1476,4.775590551181103
8127887,3,B000FZF08W,"Warning: If you want to see any kind of detail, watch using a Darbee Darblet!
Pros: Good subject material and energenic background music
Cons: Serious lack of detail due to ?
#1 - Intentionally wanted a Soft look and Feel - wasn't a Good Idea!
#2 - From watching Louie squinting, he needs prescription glasses in order to Focus his Camera correctly.
#3 - Was Originally filmed in Low Res, then bumped up to Blu-ray Output - didn't work!

Wanted to turn off half way through due to lack of detail. Being out of Focus like this, any kind of camera
panning created a dizzy blur. Any kind of motion of the subject being filmed, same blur.
Best part, the faces, in focus, of Morocco Men!
Was a HD Camera even used?
Watched the whole thing due to it only being 57 minutes long.
You might as well buy the DVD, instead of Blu-ray, because of this detailing fault.",1357862400,,855,4.377358490566038
8127888,5,B000FZF08W,"This is an awesome DVD to get. If you love nature, you HAVE to get this. It is a DVD of images in nature through awesome camera photography. The music's good. It's a good DVD to watch also if there's a language barrier because it's images versus speech. I highly recommend this DVD!",1220745600,5,282,4.339622641509434
8127889,4,B000FZF08W,the professionalism of the photographer wo ventured into so many places to capture these images shows through in evey area of this disc. only reason for 4 rather than 5 stars is the thought of what the blu-ray edition would look like. still a visual experience in either format.,1218499200,,278,4.6938775510204085
