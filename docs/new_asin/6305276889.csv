1007250,5,6305276889,"This is my favorite Wrestlemania. Alot of good interviews back stage with Bob Euker and Mene Gene, especially Hulk Hogan's. The only thing bad about it was that you never seen bad guys vs. bad guys or good guys vs. good  guys. I loved the commentary from Gorrilla Monsoon & Jesse Ventura.  You'll be surprised who wins the Greg Valentine/Ricky Steamboat match. I  would definetly recomend this Wrestlemania tape.",960595200,,412,4.942028985507246

1007307,4,6305276889,"I actually liked this WrestleMania because of its really long tournament. Here are the matches.

 1. 20 Man Battle Royal 10/10

Good choice for a opener. Although I was not such a fan of some of the competiters or the winner (Bad News Brown) it was a good way to kick off WrestleMania 4.

 2. Hacksaw Jim Duggan vs. Ted Dibiase 6/10

Dissapointing match. Probably would have been better if it was longer.

 3. Dino Bravo vs. Don Muraco 7/10

Decent match. A couple of good moves here and it was good to see these two fight since they are both classics. Good ending as well.

 4. Greg The Hammer Valentine vs. Ricky Steamboat 8/10

Really good match. A little suprising thought that the hammer won, but that is good that some kind of change occured other than the fan favorite or good guy winning.

 5. Butch Reed vs. Macho Man 5/10

I hated this match so much because itwas really boring evne though it was still really short.

 6. One Man Gang vs. Bam Bam Bigalow 10/10

Why did I give it a 10/10, well its because I thought it was hilarious to see the way Bam Bam Bigalow lost. Other than that, it finished a little too quick.

 7. Rick Rude vs. Jake The Snake Roberts 9/10

Excellent match. Went so long that it came out to a draw and no one advanced.

 8. Hercules vs. Ultimate Warrior 2/10

WORST MATCH OF THE NIGHT! Nothing to say here other than the Ultimate Warrior won and that it sucked really bad.

 9. Andre The Giant vs. Hulk Hogan 6/10

Extreamly over-hyped. This was a terrible match, and it ended at a double DQ. At the end Hulk Hogan was also posing to the crowd for a REALLY long time and made it look like he won the match. That was annoying.

10. Don Muraco vs. Ted Dibiase 8/10

Good match, decent ending, but it finished a little too quick. This would have been a 10/10 match if given more time.

11. Greg The Hammer Valentine vs. Macho Man 7/10

Sort of a good match. I thought Valentine was going to win but Macho Man got REALLY lucky and won.

12. Honky Tonk Man vs. Brutus Beefcake 8/10

I actually liked this match. It was also funny to see Jimmy Hart get his hair cut. But I think Beefcake is stupid because he seemed like he cared more about cutting someone's hair rather than winning the Intercontinental Title.

13. Haku, Tama, and Bobby Heenan vs. British Bulldog, Dynamite Kid, and Koko B. Ware 10/10

Great match. I thought Bobby Heenan did really well in this match even though he only went in only like one or two times. Heenan also makes the pin to win.

14. One Man Gang vs. Macho Man 5/10

Bad match. One Man Gang is stupid because is got DQ right in front of the referee. See, One Man Gang was trying to hit Macho Man with some oblect and the referee saw him doing it the whole time.

15. Demolition Ax and Demoltion Smash vs. Rick Martel and Tito Santana 9/10

Good tag team match. Excellent efforts on the part of both teams. Even though Demolition kind of cheated, I was happy they became the new Tag Team Champions.

16. Ted Dibiase vs. Macho Man 7/10

An okay ending match. Macho Man won well-deserved match. And he also won the WWE title. I hated Hogan because he came in during the end of the match trying to steel Macho Man's spotlight acting like it was he who won the match.",1108684800,,3224,4.262809917355372
1007308,4,6305276889,"The fourth Wrestlemania was another unique one in that they held a one-night tournament for the vacant WWF title featuring 14 top WWF stars.
The tournament itself moved kind of slowly but other great historic moments like the first tag team title win by my favorite team, Demolition, and a classic battle royale featuring Bret Hart's infamous post-match tirade were great.
The tournament featuring many great 80's superstars like Hulk Hogan, Andre The Giant, Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage, ""Million Dollar Man"" Ted Dibiase, Jake Roberts, and others. As a kid, this was a favorite event of mine and is worth checking out.",1062201600,,615,5.03921568627451
1007309,4,6305276889,"After a very successsful year the WWF (now WWE) had finally secured the ground beneath their feet and became the top wrestling promotion.  PPV's like Wrestlemania III and Survivor Series 1987 had made the WWF simply out rate the NWA and other promotions.  However it was now 1988 and Wrestlemania was just around the corner.  The WWF had a lot to live up to since the monsterous success of Wrestlemania III.  So they decided to make this years event bigger than last years.  They held it at Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino, added a 14 man tournament for the (then vacant) World title, An Intercontinental and a Tag Title match, A 20 man Battle Royale, A six man tag, and a nice little grudge match to even thngs out.  It seemed great but bigger doesn't always mean better.  Wrestlemania IV was very long and the wrestling was average and somewhat disappointing.  Nonetheless it made great WWF history.
-The 20 Man Battle Royale opens the night.  A very entertaining match although most of the WWF Superstars were thrown into this cause they weren't Wolrd title material...yet.  It comes down to a young heel Bret 'Hitman' Hart against veteran heel Bad News Brown.  Bret gets shafted and turns good after the match by smashing Bad News' victory trophy. ***
-'Hacksaw' Jim Duggan vs. 'Million Dollar Man' Ted Dibiase- Basically you know who's going to win this one.  Every time Hacksaw's in the ring it's time to hit fast forward. *
-Don Muraco vs. Dino Bravo- The battle of steroids.  Not breathtaking at all, both men past their prime years ago.  Muraco takes it. *
-Ricky 'The Dragon' Steamboat vs. Greg 'The Hammer' Valentine- Finally a good match!  Well this one has a disappointing ending though.  Don't ask me why The Hammer was chosen to go over The Dragon. **1/2
-Macho Man vs. 'The Natural' Butch Reed- Macho had turned face and was so over that they shoud have just handed him the match.  Butch Reed's WWF tenure was a joke anyways. *
-Bam Bam Bigelow vs. One Man Gang- This was the Gang before he found his `african roots' and became that joke Akeem.  They two giants had been fueding all year.  The match ends in Bigelow being counted out (even though he was on the apron).  Anyways this was Bigelow's last WWF ppv until 1993. Not bad for two big guys. *1/2
-Jake `The Snake' Roberts vs. `Ravishing' Rick Rude- These two fueded for a long time and the match seemed pretty even.  However this match is very slow and it makes it feel long.  Which is probably why both men are eliminated by hte time limit.  That was stupid. **
-Ultimate Warrior vs. Hercules- This non tournament grudge match was interesting.  Warrior was a relative new comer and Herc was a vicious heel at this point in his WWF stint.  Warrior wins it.  The match isn't fantastic by any means but it's got a neat little ending. * 1/2
-Hulk Hogan vs. Andre The Giant- Second round begins.  Both these guys got a bye in the first round.  Both being favourites to win the whole thing.  This match is nowhere near as great as the WM 3 match.  Mainly cause both men are DQ. Awful *
-Don Muraco vs. Million Dollar Man- It's amazing Muraco made it this far. Ted takes it with ease and gets a third round bye into the finals. *
-Macho Man vs. Greg Valentine- This is a pretty well fought match.  Macho wins of course but this may have been the best tourny match of the night. **
-(IC Title Match) (Champion) Honky Tonk Man vs. Brutus Beefcake- Pretty bad match.  Glad Honky got to retain the title.  Brutus never did anything for me.  Chaotic ending too. *
-British Bulldogs & Koko B. Ware vs. Islanders & Bobby Heenan- A 6 man tag upset here.  The match is obviously in the Bulldogs favour but sure enough chaos erupts and in the confusion Heenan scores a pinfall on Koko. Typical upset. *1/2
-One Man Gang vs. Macho Man- The semi final match.  Gang had a bye in the third round so he has the advantage.  He pummels Mach and ends up with a DQ for trying to hit him with a cane. *
-(Tag Championship Match) Strike Force (Champions) vs. Demolition- Demolition had only been around for a few months and already they were the most feared tag team in the WWF.  Although they are supposed to be the heels, the crowd obviously wants them to win.  And they do.  Good tag match Martel and Santana were talented as were both Demos so this is probably the best match of the night. ***
-WWF (World title match) Macho Man vs. Ted Dibiase- Both men made it to the finals.  This is a good match but it ends with Hogan and Andre being involved. Still both men really put on a decent closer to this lengthly Wrestlemania. ***
Overall Wrestlemania IV was too long and not enough good matches to hold the event up.  However the WWF proved that they were what the world was watching.  Recommended to wrestling fans.  Higlhy recommended to fans of WWF in the 80's.",1053561600,3,4810,4.466743119266055

1007312,1,6305276889,"If this isn't the worse Wrestlemania then it's pretty close to the bottom.  This show had a lot of promise with the WWF World Heavyweight Title Tournament but came no where close to delivering.  Legend has it the wrestlers were out on the town, this WM was in Atlantic City, the night before and they seem to be a step behind...showing the effect of their nights out.
  Hulk Hogan ends up nowhere near the finals which should have made this more exciting because it seemed that anyone, well atleast one of three guys, could win.  The final match of the tournament is good but some of the other matches are either OK or just downright dull.
  During this time period the WWF had a roster full of stars and they had to find spots for all of them on the biggest show, and 1 of only 2 ppv's, of the year.  As with the title tournament there are a couple of good matches but there are others which are best viewed on fast forward.
  If you are debating to choose between two WM tapes and this is one of the two tapes I'd pass on this one.  Best for serious wrestling fans or someone just interested in seeing the title tournament or if you are short a gift during the holiday season for that lovable ol' insomniac in your family this would be a perfect choice.",988848000,,1255,4.27542372881356

WRESTLEMANIA 4

Spoilers

This is one of my all time favorite Wrestlemanias. I am a huge fan of tournaments and an even bigger fan of The Macho Man Randy Savage. Naturally you can tell why I love this event so much.

1. BATTLE ROYAL-great start to one of my all time favorite Manias. I am a huge battle royal fan so it takes a lot for me not to enjoy one. This match was full of talent, some of the all time best including the last three guys who do battle. The JYD was looking to be one of the favorites to win this and came close but eventual winner Bad News Brown and the legendary Bret Hart teamed up to get him out of there. Brown would double cross Hart and wins the trophy, Bret of course would ruin that for him.

2. TED DIBIASE VS JIM DUGGAN-the first match of the WWE Championship tournament would see the Million Dollar Man take out Hacksaw. This was a great opening tourney match that was back and forth and fast paced until Andre grabbed Duggans leg when he was poised to win. He would nail Duggan at the same time DiBiase would leading to DiBiasies win.

3. DON MURACO VS DINO BRAVO-this was a good battle for two guys who have a similar style. It would end in a DQ for the original Rock, Don Muraco. Still it was a good contest between the two.

4. RICKY STEAMBOAT VS GREG VALENTINE-this was possibly the best match of the first round. These two legends gave the audience a great competitive contest from start to finish. The Hammer would get the win with a hand full of tights but it was a great match. This was a back and forth bout that had the fans all into it.

5. RANDY SAVAGE VS BUTCH REED-one of my all time favorite wrestlers the Macho man would see his first victory in this match that Reed controlled for most of the match. Savage would win with his elbow drop off of the top rope. His run her in the tournament is clearly the reason I love this Mania so much.

6. BAM BAM BIGELOW VS ONE MAN GANG-this was a fun but short match watching Bam Bam flying all over the place. He dominates the match mostly but ends up getting counted out thanks to Slick.

7. JAKE ROBERTS VS RICK RUDE-one of the best  matches of the night that goes to a time limit draw. These two put on a great back and forth match for a full 15 minutes, great match.

8. ULTIMATE WARRIOR VS HERCULES-this match was a power versus power match which was basically a brawl. It was a good change of pace in my opinion. Interesting ending in which both men have their shoulders down but Warrior gets his up. He moves on after they brawl a bit more once the match is over.

9. ANDRE THE GIANT VS HULK HOGAN-one of the biggest rivalries in the history of the WWE would kick off the second round. This was the third match between these two with Dibiase and Virgil in Andres corner. The crowd was really into this one as they did battle. Now I still believe that Andre should have moved on in the tournament. Hogan hit Andre with a chair first so the match should have been called right then with Andre winning by DQ. But Andre nailed Hogan with the chair afterwards and they ruled it a double DQ, both men eliminated, Hogan should have lost.

10. TED DIBIASE VS DON MURACO-this was an entertaining match that started before the bell even rang. The Rock took it to the Million Dollar Man early but would fall in the end. Great match like most on this event.

11. RANDY SAVAGE VS GREG VALENTINE-this match would see two all time greats go at it. The Hammer really dominated most of this match controlling The Macho man. Valentine takes it to Savage in the way Macho usually goes after others, still Savage wins with a well timed small package.

12.[I-C TITLE]HONKY TONK MAN VS BRUTUS BEEFCAKE-the I-C title was on the line here as the greatest Intercontinental Champion of all time would defend against The Barber. Pretty good match that ends with a DQ win for Beefcake.

13. THE BRITISH BULLDOGS & KOKO B. WARE VS THE ISLANDERS & BOOBY HEENAN-this was a super fun match with Heenan wearing a protective jacket to help against the actual bulldog in the match. This was a great match full of action and very entertaining. In the end The Brain would actually get the win here, fun match.

14. RANDY SAVAGE VS ONE MAN GANG-this was a pretty quick match as Gang tries to beat Savage down with Slicks cane. That causes a DW win for The Macho Man who now goes onto the finals against the Million Dollar Man.

15.[TAG TITLE]STRIKE FORCE VS DEMOLITION-man I miss these old tag matches, tag team wrestling is one of my favorite things about the sport. This was a good match with the quicker Strike Force using the double team moves while the bigger Demolition tried to out brawl the champs. This was a fun match that would see new champs crowned as Demolition walk away with the belts.

16. RANDY SAVAGE VS TED DIBIASE-the final match of the night that would crown the new WWF champion. Luckily for me Hogan was not in the match and one of two of my all time favorites would be champ. This was a really good match that had back and forth moments but Andre at ringside put the favor on Dibiases side. Of course that was all the excuse they needed to bring Hogan out. I hate that they made it look like Savage needed Hogans help to win the title. Anyway the great Randy Savage wins the title for the first time.",1467244800,,5286,4.294472361809045

What were you thinking WWE? The Hogan-Andre utterly,totally,royally failed to live up to their WM3 match. Like ECW's first ONS event,the matches only lasted from 6 to 10 minutes with only the Jake Roberts-Rick Rude match lasting 15 minutes and that ended in a time limit draw and there were simply just too many matches in 1 night. While bring the first WM to have a tournament to crown a WWE championship it's still pretty forgettable. I give this PPV a 4 and a half out of 10.",1277337600,,728,4.360294117647059
7887286,3,6305276889,"WrestleMania 4 had a good idea but the execution of matches made the event a bomb.

20 Man Battle Royal- It just shows you how much talent WWF use to have in the 80's and early 90's. A decent battle royal with alot of mid-carders and not many big names. Bad News Brown wins after eliminating Bret Hart.

Round One Match Ups

Ted DiBiase VS Hacksaw Jim Duggan: DiBiase comes to the ring with Andre, who is wrestling in round two. This match, like every other first round match expect one, is very short. A decent little match but the ending was stupid as Andre punched Duggan in front of the ref. DiBiase disqualified? Nope, he kneed Duggan in the back and hit a fist drop for the win. The endings would just get worse.

Dino Bravo VS Don Muraco: I never cared for either man. Bravo moves the ref in the way of Muraco's move and gets disqualified.

Rick Steambaot VS Greg Valentine: The best match-up of the first round with Valentine winning, a big surprise even watching it today.

Randy Savage VS Butch Reed: Reed looks like Shelton Benjamin, could have been his dad. Someone at WWE watched a Reed match and thought it would be perfect for Benjamin. Anyway, Reed dominates Savage thru out the entire match. Reed talks to Liz, Savage drapes Reed's throat across the top rope and hits an elbow smash. Huh?

Bam Bam Bigelow VS One Man Gang: A great match but the ending was one of the dumbest finishes in WWF/WWE history.

Rick Rude VS Jake Roberts: After rushing thru the first round comes a draw to the end the disappointing first round.

Ultimate Warrior against Hercules. A bad match with Warrior winning.

Round Two Begins!

Hogan starts the second round by facing Andre The Giant. This match ended in a double DQ, what the hell?

Ted DiBiase VS Don Muraco: A good match with DiBiase winning in the end.

Randy Savage VS Greg Valentine: Anther good match with two men I enjoy watching. Savage wins with a small package to advance. The first round sucked and the second round had two good matches and Hogan-Andre was just dumb.

Brutus Beefcake VS Honky Tonk Man: The IC title is up for grabs in a entertaining match but the end is a DQ.

Islanders/Heenan VS Koko B Ware/British Bulldogs: A decent match but prefered Heenan and Ware left out of this match. Speaking of that, Heenan wins by pinning Ware.

Round 3 begins!

Randy Savage VS One Man Gang: A quick, useless match. Gang gets a DQ for tryung to use a cane, so Savage-DiBiase in the finals!

Demoltion VS Strike Force: This would set up the feud of Strike Force, Martel and Santana. It was a pretty good match overall with Ax and Smash winning the tag titles back.

Round 4

DiBiase VS Savage: A classic match up with Hogan helping Savage win his first world title.

Overall, a pretty forgetable event. The first round of the tournament was a complete bust. Savage winning the world title is the only reason to watch this event.",1204416000,,2890,4.487571701720841
7887287,4,6305276889,"This event was a mamoth four hours long, even after being edited for home video release. It was the only WWF PAL tape that was released on 2 tapes as part of a box set.

The other matchees weren't bad either, the 'Mania started off with a good battle royal which was a good gimmick opener.

7887288,3,6305276889,"WM 4 isn't quite at the bottom of the worst WM list but it leaves with sort of a sour taste in your mouth.  The show contains a championship tournament which sounds cool to have on a wrestlemania, but with a few worthy names and not enough good action, the show ends up just dragging on and not necessiarily putting you on the edge of your seat.  However, it was better than the Survivor Series 98 tournament in my opinion.  Here's the card and my ratings.

1.  20 man battle royal
- this was just a match to give those wrestlers who weren't championship material something to do.  The match was important b/c it helped start Bret's career and turned him and the Jim Neidhart into good guys.  Match had greats like Harley Race, JYD, George Steele, and Hillbilly Jim.  After Bret and Bad News Brown eliminated JYD, they celebrate until BNB cheapshoted Bret with the ghetto blaster and eliminated him for the win.  Bret got mad and smashed the trophy.  I don't like to rate battle royals b/c their not real matches but this was pretty entertaining.  I guess I'll give it a **

2.  Hacksaw Jim Duggan vs Ted Dibiase
- the first round of the tourney.  With the push Dibiase was getting, it was obivious who would win this one.  Dibiase looked good but it was overlooked by Duggan's poor wrestling ability.  Luckily, it ended quickly when Andre attacked Duggan long enough for Dibiase to knee him in the back and hit a fist drop for the win.

Rating: 1/2

3.  Don Muraco vs (late) Dino Bravo
- Match at the beginning had potential to be good but they missed up some of the moves, bravo selling was poor and had a poor ending when Muraco went to nail Bravo with a forearm only for bravo to pull the referee into him for the DQ.

Rating: 3/4

4.  Ricky Steamboat vs Greg Valentine
- Finally something good to see in the tourney.  The match wasn't as good as some of steamboat's other matches but both guys worked well.  Match moved at a good pace with good wrestling.  I just love watching Valentine sell moves b/c sometimes he goes overboard with it.  I wished we would've had a Steamboat/Savage II but instead Valentine gets the pin and moves on.

Rating:  *** 1/4

5.  Randy Savage vs Butch Reed
- Nothing really worthing mentioning.  Reed dominates the match until he gets distracted by Elizabeth long enough for Savage to throw him off the top rope and hit his trademark elbow drop for the win.

Rating: 1/4

6.  Bam Bam Bigelow vs One Man Gang
- this is just sad to watch.  Bam Bam was getting a good push up until the last few months before he left and came back five years later.  The match was too short, the action was horrible, and it ended in one of the most stupidest and embarassing ways possible.  Bam Bam got counted out despite being on the apron and the Gang would not let him back in.

Rating: DUD

7.  Jake ""Snake"" Roberts vs (late) Rashving Rick Rude
- This looked like it had potential to be another good match up to watch but it wasn't the case.  The problem I had with this match is that they repeat moves over and over again!  Rude would use 2 moves then go to a chinlock and repeat this process for about 7 minutes.  At the beginning they kept taking turns bodyslamming each other and Jake would constantly use the armbar.  By the time the match started getting interesting, the time limit expired and both men were eliminated to give the OMG a bye.  God helps us!

Rating: *

8.  Ulimate Warrior vs (late) Hercules
- this was a non tournament grudge that saw Warrior just starting out his career.  Match was nothing spectular both it did have a few cool parts to it.  I loved the part where it took Hercules 3 clotheslines to knock the warrior down and how warrior countered Herc's full nelson for the win.  Other than that, this would've been another DUD

Rating: 1/4

- well the second round of the tourney is about to begin and only one good match. NOT LOOKING GOOD.

9.  Hulk Hogan vs (late) Andre The Giant
- all I can say is if you thought their wm 3 fight and others before this one was bad, wait till you see this.  Match lasted 5 minutes with barely any action.  Both men were DQed for using a steel chair.  Hogan posing was longer than the match.

Rating: DUD

10.  Don Muraco vs Ted Dibiase
- On paper, it looked like it was going to suck but this was shockingly a decent matchup.  Muraco looked way better here than in his previous bout.  It's a shame it couldn't of lasted longer but it's still worth seeing.  Dibiase wins with a hotshot (catching a guy and dropping his neck on the top rope)to get a bye and be in the finals.

Rating: **

11.  Randy Savage vs Greg Valentine
- another rushed match that barely got started.  However,  Savage's quickness vs Valentine agressive techinical wrestling make this watchable.  Savage used a small package to counter the figure four to meet the Gang.  Would it have killed them to have him face either Jake or Rude?

Rating: ** 1/4

12.  IC title Brutus Beefcake vs Honky Tonk Man
- I won't waste time talking about this garbage.  Beefcake dominated the match and had it won with a sleeperhold but Jimmy Hart ambushed the ref with the megaphone for the DQ finish.  Only entertaining part was when Beefcake gives Hart a haircut.

Rating: 1/2

13.  Bulldogs and Koko B. Ware vs Islanders and Bobby Heenan
- the story behind this was Islanders stole Matilda the Bulldog's mascot.  Koko and Bobby were thrown into the mix somehow.  Match wasn't that bad although it did look like a remake of the Bulldogs and Santana vs Harts and Danny Davis b/c Heenan got the pin over Koko.  Still a fun match.

14.  Randy Savage vs OMG
- All you need to know is that the Gang got DQed for trying to hit Savage with a cane.

Rating: 1/2

15.  Strike Force vs Demolition for the tag titles
- Demolition were the newest dominating force in the tag team divison.  The fans were behind them despite being heels.  Santana and Martel worked arem the arms of the challengers for a few minutes.  Demolition would work over Santana for a few minutes and then Martel would clean house and put Smash in the boston crab but Axe would hit Martel in the back of the neck with Fuji's cane and score the pin and we have new champs.
Match had a good beginning and ending but the middle was a bit too boring.

Rating: ** 1/4

16.  Randy Savage vs Ted Dibiase
- Finally at the end.  Dibiase and Savage put on a great performance despite a bit of interference by Andre and Hogan.  Dibiase had the million dollar dream slapped on but Hogan hit him with a chair and Savage would capitalize on it with a flying elbow for the win and the new champion.

Rating: *** 1/2

Overall, WM 4 was too long and didn't have that much good action.  A few good non tournament bouts and a few good tournament matches but that was it.  I think if they would've gotten rid of the 1st round of the tourney, that would've provided more time in making longer and better matches.  The show wasn't bad, but it isn't highly recommended.",1126310400,,6962,4.352574102964119

I really loved this one, first tournament for the WWF Championship.

This actually started  with Ted Dibiase obsession to buy the WWF

Championship from Hulk Hogan. The drama was done in good WWE fashion. Hogan eventually gives the famous Hell No!!! speech but Ted isn't finished yet.

Later, in the Main Event , Andre through a deal with the referee

wins the WWF Title for the first time. Andre as the late Gorilla

Monsoon says holds the title for two seconds before handing it over to Ted. The title is vacated and thus the Tournament is born with Savage winning it all.

According to the rumors Dibiase was supposed to win it but

because Honky Tonk Man didn't want to drop the title after

winning it from an unsuspecting Ricky Steamboat, the script

was changed.

Pretty great matches from classic WWF wrestlers like Don Muraco,

Greg Valentine, British Bulldogs and so forth.

The Battle Royal was also awesome.

Hogan vs. Andre the rematch was equally memorable.

Jake The Snake vs. Rick Rude saw signs of that rivalry that would eventually involved Cheryl Roberts.

Ultimate Warrior vs. Hercules was good.

The WWF obviously wasn't going to turn down the change to promote This feud a second time. This time the results were different but it was still fun to watch.

Overall Wrestlemania IV is a great Wrestlemania to check out again.",1121212800,,1382,4.804255319148936
7887290,4,6305276889,"At Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, NJ, in March of 1988, the fourth annual rendition of Wrestlemania took place, as a new WWF World Champion was crowned.  Move over, Hulk Hogan -- this event became Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage's shining moment.

This is a rating scale of 1 to 10 of the event's matches:

1. 20-Man Battle Royal: (mostly grade-B wrestlers): 8.5/10
This one is actually pretty good, as Bret Hart is the last man out after being eliminated by Bad News Brown.  It sets up the Hart-Bad News feud, with Hart as a new crowd favorite.  Also, the Junkyard Dog noticeably fares well against the competition in his final Wrestlemania appearance.

The WWF World Title Tournament (Round 1):

1. ""Hacksaw"" Jim Duggan vs. Ted DiBiase: 5.5/10
With Andre the Giant and Virgil at ringside for DiBiase, it seems inevitable who will win in this decent brawl between two former UWF mainstays.  DiBiase advances, while Duggan becomes embroiled in a feud with Andre.

2. Dino Bravo vs. Don ""The Rock"" Muraco: 6.5/10
Bravo is DQ'ed for throwing the referee into harm's way.  Muraco moves forward to face DiBiase.

3. Rick Steamboat vs. Greg ""The Hammer Valentine: 8.5/10
In the night's best singles match, Valentine steals the win after reversing Steamboat's signature high-flying move.

4. Randy Savage w/ Elizabeth vs. Butch Reed w/ Slick: 7/10
Savage survives a pounding to eliminate Reed with his famous  flying elbowsmash.  Savage will next face Valentine.

5. Bam Bam Bigelow vs. One Man Gang w/ Slick: 2.5/10
The Gang quickly gets a dubious count-out win.

6. Rick Rude w/Bobby Heenan vs. Jake Roberts: 7.5/10
In the only time-limit draw of the event, both of them are eliminated, which means the One Man Gang will get a free ride into Round 3.

Hercules vs. Ultimate Warrior (grudge match): 4/10
The Warrior gets his first big push by knocking off Hercules in a forgettable brawl.

The WWF World Title Tournament(Round 2):

1. Andre the Giant w/ DiBiase & Virgil vs. Hulk Hogan: 3.5/10
Over-hyped and disappointing. Bashing each other over the head with a chair gets them both DQ'ed (and eliminated).  Hogan (being Hogan) celebrates, anyway, after disposing of Virgil.

2. Ted DiBiase vs. Don Muraco: 7.5/10
Surprising good!  DiBiase bests Muraco to jump into the finals.

3. Randy Savage w/Elizabeth vs. Greg Valentine: 8/10
The ""Macho Man"" survives a possible upset by pinning the wily ""Hammer"" with a small package.  Savage moves forward to face the One Man Gang.

Brutus Beefcake vs. I-C Champion Honky Tonk Man: 7.5/10
It's yet another of Honky's cheap finishes.  Brutus gets a meaningless win, after Honky Tonk as DQ'ed seemingly for the one millionth time.  After the match, Brutus has some haircutting fun at Jimmy Hart's expense.

Islanders/Bobby Heenan vs. The British Bulldogs/Koko B. Ware: 7/10
Decent match, as Heenan (wearing attack dog handler's garb) gets the pin on Koko B. Ware.

WWF World Title Tournament (Round 3):

1. Randy Savage w/ Elizabeth vs. One Man Gang w/ Slick: 6.5/10
Savage gets a fast DQ victory after the Gang repeatedly tries whacking him with Slick's cane.  The villains also share a fun pratfall, as the Gang inadvertently squashes his own manager (courtesy of Savage's help).

Demoltion vs. WWF Tag Team Champions Strike Force: 7.5/10
Better than expected, as the lowly Road Warrior knock-off's inevitably overwhelm Rick Martel and Tito Santana to win the titles.

WWF World Title Tournament (Round 4 - The Finals):

1. Randy Savage w/ Elizabeth & Hulk Hogan vs. Ted DiBiase w/ Andre: 8/10
Not a superb match, but very entertaining.  Savage finally and deservedly wins the World Title! The show ends with the Megapowers' celebration.

Overall, there aren't any necessarily great matches, but the WWF definitely gives its fans their money's worth for nearly four full hours.  If you can find this vhs for a reasonable price, Wrestlemania IV is an excellent investment.

However, beware of the product's cheap EP mode, as the picture quality will not likely hold up over time.",1115164800,7,4008,4.9624624624624625
