1662280,4,B00005TPCC,"A sublime and subtle movie that brings out the chills rather than the gore. AMERICAN NIGHTMARE is a welcome change of pace from the hack-and-slash (which I also enjoy) that usually dominate the horror genre. First time director Jon Keeyes did his homework and learned from the directors and artists who came before him, putting the emphasis on mood and character rather than gouts of Kayro blood.
By now, the plot has been well established - killer with an unknowable motive is stalking seven friends on Halloween, their deaths set to the tune of an amoral shock disc jockey. All the reasons to love this movie are the same reasons others will hate it. Those raised on a steady diet of gore - and trendy psychos spouting Henny Youngman's greatest one-liners - will think the movie tedious and that, as a few have written...
The acting is terrific across the board, particularly, and she's been singled out in countless reviews, lead actress Debbie Rochon, who turns in a powerhouse performance as the mentally and emotionally gone Jane Toppan. She is present in every scene in the film, whether physically or as only a key element of menace.
Keeyes and company have added multiple layers of dread onto the narrative, resulting in near-claustrophobia. Occassionally, AMERICAN NIGHTMARE's modest budget allows the viewer to glimpse some seams, but all in all, this is a terrific film and well worth a couple of viewings.
Highly recommended.",1015459200,10,1438,4.946280991735537
1662281,5,B00005TPCC,"This movie is one of those love-it-or-hate-it films.  Yes, the film seems to copy a lot of elements of Halloween.  But so what?  Yes, certain scenes seem familiar, but the plot on the whole is pretty original and well done.  I especially give kudos since the director of this movie didn't go to film school and just kind of did things his own way.  That's something you've got to respect.  Also, Debbie Rochon is wonderful as always; she's one of the best actresses out there today.  Too bad mainstream Hollywood hasn't really used her to her full potential yet.  Check this one out! :)",1014940800,4,586,4.5673076923076925
1662282,1,B00005TPCC,"My friends and I rented American Nightmare expecting that it would be pretty cheesy.  In fact, we have spent many weekends watching obscure films, many of which have been horror films.  As a supporter/participant of independent film, I was also interested in seeing this movie.  However, American Nightmare was probably the worst movie I have seen in a long, long time.  Now, there are horror movies that are so bad they are good because they are funny. (Evil Dead is a great example)  After a while, American Nightmare wasn't even funny anymore.  The plot didn't make any sense AT ALL, and although most of the actors were fairly decent (and that might be a stretch), the dialogue was so poorly written we spent more time laughing at what they were saying than watching their performance....  At first I hoped that the bad script was just tongue in cheek due to the whole, predictable concept (used millions of times before)... but it's doubtful.  The whole movie seemed to be taking itself very seriously, without a right to.  The beginning of the film- the flashback to the original killing spree- starts a trend in the movie of just not making ANY sense.  Although I fully believe that audiences should not have things spelled out for them, a little help would have been nice to make the movie watchable.  The movie played on every cliche in the horror movie book (the characters, needless nudity, really typical scenes), which if used properly can make for a pretty decent(funny)film.  But as the movie employed every bad horror film technique there is, it also tried desperately hard to be an ""artsy"" or ""innovative"" film, by not explaining the murderer's motives at all, and then giving a ""twist"" ending that didn't answer any questions.  If we don't know anything about these people, why should we care?  This movie lacked organization, A DECENT PLOT, characterization, creativity, and was really over the top and melodramatic. (and it didn't resolve anything)  There also seemed to be a lot of extra, needless characters.  It was very bad.  I understand that this was a low budget film, and I do appreciate what it was trying to accomplish.  However, a low budget is not an excuse for alienating an audience that truly wanted to see this film succeed.  The pyschological quality of it could have made for a great film, despite its many faults. And on a techincal note, the most creative thing may have been the lighting, although I feel it made it look as if it was filmed in a Wal-Mart.  (the sound effects were so predictable, and often drowned out dialogue)  AVOID THIS FILM.  It's not even good for a laugh.",1013904000,,2620,4.762749445676275
1662283,4,B00005TPCC,"American Nightmare is one of the best small budget movies I've ever seen.  The look, and feel, of the movie is as good as any big budget film you're going to come across.  The Director, Jon Keeyes, obviously takes a great deal of pride in his work, which comes shining through from beginning to end.  And all of the cast do an equally fantastic job with their characters, and make you wish you could get to know them better before they are sent on their way by psycho nurse Jane Toppan.  All the way around this is a movie that you need to check out.  You'll be glad that you did.",1013385600,7,580,4.1891891891891895
1662284,4,B00005TPCC,"Reviewing a movie is always a fun task, don't start thinking I'm a professional.  I'm not, just look at my grammar.  But I enjoy reviewing movies as an avid movie fan, so that other fans like me get the ""real scoop"" on a movie not the scoop Pepsi wants you to know.  So with that said and you have an idea of where I am coming from...
So I watched American Nightmare after a friend told me to check it out.  At first the acting was a little cheesy (first impression)  Good use of lighting, it was actually creepy the way the director chose to use the lights, they fit right into the genre of movie.  So even though the acting and the lines were somewhat cheesy at first I continued and oddly enough the lines and the acting fit into the theme and I couldn't stop watching.  I felt myself understanding the characters more as if they were my friends, cause those cheesy lines...that's the same sh*& we say.  I never really realized that movies portray to many punks, losers, hippies, surfers, jocks and cookie cutter geeks to the extreme form.  My circle of friends consists of at least one or two of each of those and we all sound and talk ""pretty much"" the same, using the same words and phrases used in American Nightmare.  So it wasn't really cheesy lines, it was an unexpected realism in a movie (imagine that!).
The killing scenes were realistic but not ultra-blood, ultra cheese.  As a matter of fact I was surprised at the lack of gore in the the movie.  If your expecting a gore flick, then change your expectations and watch it anyway.  This is a movie that was made to send shivers down your spine and make you want to sleep with the lights on.  So you ask, then why the title of this review.  I went back and rented the original Friday the 13th, Halloween, Phsycho and a couple other classics and guess what...very similiar.  Maybe a little more gore in a couple of those however, they were made by production companies.  The were all similiar in the way that they don't attempt to scare you with the villian so much as to you weren't sure what the villian was going to do next, maybe come after you not with showing what the villian could do to you with special effects.
So here is the guts of my review.  It's realistic, great lighting and sound and does a good job of making you think ""what's going to happen next, do I need to turn on some lights"".  I have and will reccomend it to my friends, family and coworkers.",1012867200,10,2430,4.336283185840708
1662285,5,B00005TPCC,"This is a fine example of what can be accomplished with a great vision, some great talent, and a low budget. This movie will make you have chills, laugh, and even...well, I'll let you find that part out yourselves. I would recommend this film to anyone that enjoys psychological thrillers, or horror in general. This has not been corrupted by the glam of Hollywood and the mass media industry, it's true to the director's initial visions and ideas, which makes it raw and true to life. I think what makes a great psyhchological thriller is it's ability to make you realize that the things that happen in the film could very well be happening next door, or across the street, or even to you. In a Psycho(Anthony Hopkins) kind of way, films that get under your skin as something that actually could happen are the true ""horror"" genre to come. The Freddies and Jasons were fun and all, but their time is past. If all we can get out of Hollywood is N'... and 97 degrees and Lucas, then I say issue everyone a camera, and get the most intense, intriguing, honest interpretations of life out there for the masses to view at their discretion. Down with the MPAA!  Randysan",1012867200,8,1165,4.5476190476190474
7953801,5,B00005TPCC,"Out of the great Debbie Rochon's movies, I much prefer Colour from the Dark or Richard the Lionheart: Rebellion.  But, as far as Debbie's Mad Slasher films, this one is the best.  I've always said Debbie Rochon would make a good Mad Slasher.  This movie helps prove it.

It is hard going through a movie knowing who the killer is, but Debbie makes the mysterious air work quite well.",1510704000,,383,4.507246376811594
7953802,1,B00005TPCC,This movie is a cheap knock off of Halloween and Urban Legends. The script and acting was corny. I was only able to tolerate about 30 minutes of this so called horror movie. Couldn't bear to waste any more of my time.,1500681600,,217,4.190476190476191

7953804,3,B00005TPCC,i haven't watched the movie yet. but i am definatly going to buy it. i was actually their when they made it i got to help work the smoke machine. we live right down the road from where it was filmed. so im hoping it is as good as i have heard it is from my point of view back then all i got to see was what was happening on the outside and people being running around outside. lol. if it was scary for you guys think what it will be like for us since the building is right down the road. lol.,1231113600,,492,3.7403846153846154
7953805,2,B00005TPCC,"Before making a movie, you should have some idea of what you're doing. Now,durign the opening scene, a killer jumps on a victim and shouts something like 'you think you're better than me, %^*%?!"" For no reason we ever learn about.

The plot concerning people being killed off by things they fear most isn't used as much as you'd think and all of their 'fears' are either very generic fears or things that can fit into a very generic slasher. And halfway through the movie this plot is ditched so some crazy family plotline can be brought in that doesn't actually go anywhere.",1167696000,,575,4.58252427184466
7953806,3,B00005TPCC,"I personally thought this movie had a lot going for it. First off we have a great (female) killer with Debbie Rochon, who was shown as the killer in the first scene. The movie had many clichs, many scenes that directly reminded me of movies like Scream, Halloween, Friday The 13th, and even cheesy scenes that look like they were ripped right from Friends. The movie had a lot of action, suspense, blood, some boobs (courtesy of Debbie Rochon), humor, a very fitting and neat score, and a very well done, and well entertaining climax in the movie.

Some complaints that I had was the whole motive of Jane, and how she fit in with the group of friends. I thought a lot of it was far-fetched and unbelievable. But it is a movie, so I let it slide. One other thing was that the movie could have been a lot more violent and bloody. There were a lot of missed opportunities with it. Finally, the killer. I know she was supposed to be known right off the bat as the killer, but I would have much more preferred that anyone in the gang could be suspected.

I watched Suburban Nightmare before I watched this, and I really didn't care too much for it. The movie wasn't at all bad, I just didn't like the story. Buying this, and knowing it was written and directed by the same guy (John Keeyes) I expected the same style of movie. After watching it, I felt that the movie was not only much better than Suburban Nightmare, but better written, directed and with better actors. Debbie Rochon really set this movie apart, and made the movie great. Her masturbation with the knife scene was a bit unnecessary, but very warmly welcomed. I think this is one of her finest movies from start to finish. I would highly recommend this movie, especially to slasher fans and fans of Debbie.",1140393600,4,1768,4.436923076923077
7953807,1,B00005TPCC,"This is such a bad movie.  And not bad in a funny or cheesy way.  It's just bad.  The acting and dialogue between characters was naseuating.  I kept watching and waiting for something good to happen and nothing did.  There is no action in this movie at all.  They tried to make this movie a  psychological thriller, but it fails miserably.  Save your money and don't buy this movie unless you need something to bore you to sleep.",1128556800,,429,4.410256410256411
7953808,1,B00005TPCC,"I cannot believe how bad this film was. Most of my time was spent hitting the fast forward button hoping there would be something, anything that made it all worth while. There wasn't. I generally love low budget horror flicks which is why I gave this one a try. There wasn't a single scary moment or even much blood? I even watched the making of the movie hoping there would be something that would give me a clue regarding a ""plot"" or what the movie was even about. We knew who the killer was immediately but never found out why? The making of the movie was actually more enjoyable to watch than the movie. I don't usually review films but if I could save just one person from seeing this, it's worth it. I actually purchased this movie based on a review that I had read. I've learned my lesson, always read all the reviews for a movie you've never heard of. Needless to say, my copy has been recycled.",1022716800,4,903,4.317647058823529
7953809,5,B00005TPCC,"I am a huge fan of actress Debbie Rochon and her work and I know I'm not the only one. She has being doing awesome acting in independent films for years and stands out in any role she is cast. Both American nightmare and her portrail of twisted killer Jane Toppan have won much praise and acclaim from audiences and rightfully so.

American Nightmare a well shot and all round well acted independant slasher film that is fresh and original and has clearly being crafted with love and care not seen in many indy films by the director. The film relies more on psycological horror rather than buckets of blood, which is terrible when it is done baddly but here it works brilliantly due to competant directing and Miss Rochon's amazing performance.
Debbie Rochon seems to completely dissappeare into her character, she done plenty of prep work and research to get into character and that is completely visble on screen. Occasionally Jane Toppan goes into a kind of psychotic outburst, I especially like these scenes the raw energy and anger is so genuine that we truely believe that what we are seeing is a disturbed murder.
The fact that we believe so much in the Jane Toppan character makes the film so very much more suspenseful to watch as she stalks and destroys her prey. The unfortunate victims are all nice looking completely innocent every day people, which makes as feel sorry for them as they are slain. So many slasher movies expect us to feel pity for the total jerk characters when they are mutliated by mask wearing indestructable killers, and thankfully American Nightmare is completely free of these common slasher cliches. All the actors are great and characters are fleshed out blelievably. After seeing the making of documentory I realise that this is due to a thorough casting process under taken by the director.
I guess that anyone who doesn't like this very cool and well made film has a problem with the some what abstract type ending. I personally liked it as it also doesn't have a quick fix now we can live happily ever after ending and also the surviving victims at the end of this film are visibly distraught, unlike other slashers where they are like happy ""we got away"" as though they forget about all their friends who were just killed the last couple of days. Also we get a gilmpse into the killers own life and heartache.
I must say that anyone who apperciates a well crafted and thought out horror film will enjoy american nightmare immensely. And words or at least my words, cannot completely praise the amazing performance of Debbie Rochon.",1021852800,9,2574,4.72
7953810,1,B00005TPCC,"I rented this movie primarily because I'm a huge fan of horror movies, and I didn't expect much  because I had never heard of it before. Fact is, I found this movie terribly boring and disappointing. It is probably due to the fact that its director never heard of the word ""originality"" in his life. In fact there are many obvious things which were literally copies from other far better horror films. The protagonist of the movie is a baby-sitter that is chased by an unknown murderer. Does that ring a bell? If it does not, watch ""Halloween"" and you'll know what I mean. And of course, the murders all take place on Halloween night. The girl whom the protagonist babysits is also shown watching ""Halloween"" during the movie. Wow, what a coincidence! Shame that this same thing was previously shown on ""Scream"" when a couple of teenagers are hanging around in a house also watching ""Halloween"" together. Oh, and by the way the girl killer in the movie is a mentally-ill woman who manages to escape from a mental institution. Again, an obvious ""Halloween"" copycat.
Apart from all this, the movie does not even manage to catch your interest. Character development is practically non-existant, and you'll just don't care about all the victims slaughtered throughout. Not to mention the supposed climatic ending which this movie features. You'll just stare at the closing credits asking uselessly yourself ""What is this supposed to mean?""
I'll tried to be as helpful as possible to make you open your eyes and stay away from this trash. Buy this movie only if you like to waste your money.",1017619200,3,1586,4.788321167883212
