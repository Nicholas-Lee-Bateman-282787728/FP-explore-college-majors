5510600,5,B00AVYY2D6,"This is just outstanding - this is the definitive telling of the story of Pablo Escobar and the Medellin Cartel.  Hollywood will never ever equal this - no way.  One part that was missing though was the part about "" La Macua' "" and how he bought real estate for Escobar and helped set up routes in Europe - I was surprised they left this piece out.  Also it needs to be made with English sub-titles for Americans that don't speak Spanish, and maybe come with a little dictionary to translate ""Paisa"" into English.  Brillantly done !",1362873600,11,532,4.453608247422681

The delivery process doesn't take long, over all, I'm very happy with this product.",1362096000,,364,4.983606557377049

5510605,5,B00AVYY2D6,"Five starts should only be awarded to truly exceptional works and there are many so-called five stars out there that while they may be very good, may not warrant a bona-fide 5 star rating. This said, in this case, I do not recall a Hispanic ""soap opera"" production, not based on romance, but on historical facts, that is as comprehensive in examining an individual and a ""trade"", like the Colombian drug trafficking of the period. Escobar and his organization were able to not only challenge the Colombian government, but controlled most legal and enforcement organizations during his reign.  But for his arrogance of power where he ""lost it"" when he began to ""take out"" his own partners, at which time, organized crime AND the government began pursuing him as the #1 threat to Colombian society, he may still have been in control.  With his policy of ""plata o plomo"" -- money or lead, he was able to either BUY or SUBJECT cooperation from powerful individuals, entities, and politicians. In a desperate effort in reign in Escobar's power with the government unable to contain him due to vast corruption and fear, LOS PEPES -- Los Perseguidos por Pablo Escobar -- Those Persecuted by Pablo Escobar -- began their own campaign of seeking out Escobar and his associates, then the government along with A LOT OF HELP from the USA, finally were able to bring him down.

The epic begins with a brief history of his childhood and youth and follows him to his final demise.  A monumental work produced by Caracol TV in Columbia using the works of major reporters and historical records of the period. Of course there will always be some Hollywood-like liberties taken for effect taken in most films, however, this could be as close as it gets to the real thing.

Without question 5 Stars...",1361145600,14,1783,4.775974025974026

8558111,5,B00AVYY2D6,"I loved it.

Pros:-
1- Most of the show is based on historic events. I kept on googling the events thinking it was made up for drama effect but I was floored to find it actually happened.
2- Superb acting! all of them. I laughed, I cried, I liked Pablo, I hated Pablo, I despised Pablo... it is all there.
3- They focused extensively on his victims. Yes, the first 20 or so episodes they ""Robin hood"" him but by the 30th episode he is despicable, unlikable person and most importantly his way of life is not glorified and by the end you do not relate to him or to the rest of the cartel.
4- Historic footage blends seamlessly with the show.
5- Colombian accent + english subtitles

Cons (I personally looked past the cons, they bothered me a bit but not enough to take out a star)

1- Some cheesy special effects, especially in bombing scenes.
2- Some inconsistent things. For example, a prisoner was being transported blind folder.. when they went in the car it was blue.. when they reached the destination it was red!
3- some long unnecessary sences

Over all this is an amazing show.. american shows can learn from these guys.",1465430400,,1129,4.4396135265700485
