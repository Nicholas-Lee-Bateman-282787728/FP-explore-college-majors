8278265,3,B001AO018Q,"This is Jodorowsky's first full length feature film from 1968, which is something of a homage to the silent era of  films, as well as to films by surrealists, such as Luis Bunuel (Un chien andalou,1929) . In 1957 he did direct a short film, ""Les tetes interverties"" which was a mime adaptation of Thomas Mann's 1940's play ""The Transposed Heads"" (La Cravae, The Transposed Heads, The Severed Heads).

""Fando Y Lis"" is a road story, which follows Fando, and his paraplegic sweetheart Lis, through urban rubble, and desert badlands, looking for an unattainable, enchanted city, called Tar. This surreal adventure is full of odd events and unusual people. There are some cinematically interesting shots where time is reversed, such as when a charred piano appears to be animated to life after crumbling to the ground, or when a doll is unburied from its grave of dirt. This later sequence  reminded me of a scene from ""Vampyr"", where a shadow of a grave digger has the earth falling back onto his shovel. Jodorowsky's film is largely linear, but it does have these passages where time reverses that emphasizes the dreamlike, nonlinear, or surreal aspect of the story.

Jodoroswky has influenced other directors, including David Lynch (Eraserhead), and E. Elias Merhige (Begotten). He later followed this film with several others, including ""El Topo"" (1970), and ""The Holy Mountain"" (1973). ""The Rainbow Thief"" is scheduled to be released in 2010, which will star Nick Nolte, Asia Argento, and Marilyn Manson.",1259798400,3,1505,5.056451612903226
8278266,5,B001AO018Q,"Fando Y Lis is a kaleidoscope of controversial, mystical, and brilliantly original storytelling and has some of the most beautiful imagery ever filmed in black & white. This film is extremely artistic and has a brilliant creative arrangement. I love all the hidden symbols, and metaphorical structures and patterns throughout this wonderful motion picture. Alejandro Jodorowsky is one of the finest directors of our lifetime. Consider your self lucky to be able to experience this incredible treasure. The director's commentary track is highly entertaining and incredibly funny. There is also a fantastic documentary called ""La Constellation Jodorowsky"" which features an interesting look at Jodorowsky's other works like Tarot reading and Psycho-Magic, and the gone astray project of Dune that will blow you away.",1257120000,2,814,5.626016260162602
8278267,4,B001AO018Q,"while not as epic as el topo or as surreal and transcendental as holy mountain, fando y lis is still a beautiful film and one worth watching.  if i bought it again, i would just save some money and get the three together in the collection.  the film is black and white, so although it lacks some of the wonder of the other two, its still beautiful in its own right.  if you enjoyed the other two, definitely give this a shot.",1241654400,,425,4.158536585365853
