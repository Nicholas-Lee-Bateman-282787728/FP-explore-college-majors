8748630,5,6303928196,"This video should be re-released on DVD! the film dates back to the 90s, yet this film features cutting edge technology, flawless eloquent narration and much more than one can ask for. Life on the Reef is way more than your average reef fishes film; it delves into marine science featuring oceanography, geology and more. Wish the maker of this film reconsider releasing it on DVD or make a new complimentary film like this! I'm an u/w film buff and this one surpasses all my expectations! *****",1287532800,,495,4.7011494252873565
