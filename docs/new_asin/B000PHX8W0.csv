8191545,4,B000PHX8W0,This video is lovely but shows just overhead views of the Holy Lands without anyone talking about the Bible or the significance of the locations.  It is beautiful but was not as full of teaching as the other Footprints of God DVD's have been.,1436659200,,242,4.5

8191548,2,B000PHX8W0,"I thought there would be more to this film, but it's only a compilation of fly-by shots of different parts of the Holy Land. There's no dialogue, no interesting facts, no stories, no scriptural attachments...only footage with text here and there (indicating where one is).",1354665600,4,272,5.066666666666666
