3480835,5,B001B3LIP6,"Brought back memories. Watched the early episodes on PBS and hoped this would continue the kind of fun we enjoyed then. It was a great ending to a long, entertaining, experience.",1222732800,3,178,4.774193548387097
3480836,5,B001B3LIP6,"""You are cordially invited to celebrate the silver wedding anniversary of Mr. and Mrs. Richard DeVere."" ""To the Manor Born Siver Wedding Anniversary"" takes us once again to the Grantleigh Estate, this time to celebrate the silver wedding anniversary of Richard DeVere and Audrey fforbes-Hamilton. As Richard and Audrey are making surprise party plans for each other, Richard's long kept secret comes out into the open. Where upon Audrey leaves him and Grantleigh Manor to return to ""the lodge"" which is now occupied by old school chum, Marjorie until things blow over. From here we have the classic comedy of Penelope Keith, Peter Bowles and Angela Thorne written brillantly by Peter Spence and directed by Gareth Gwenlyn. On a sad note many of the series character actors have passed on, John Rudling as Brabinger, Daphne Heard as Mrs. Polovicka, Micheal Bilton as Old Ned, and Anthony Sharp as Brigadier Lemington.
In the end true love does prevail Audrey and Richard style of course and the couple celebrate their silver wedding anniversary amongst family, friends and a new addition to the family, Bertie II.",1222128000,8,1112,5.081967213114754

3480838,5,B001B3LIP6,"Beautifully captured. Characters have really aged gently. First class production. Genteel, Upperclass Brit.
Enjoyed the humour as always.",1221350400,4,137,6.666666666666667
3480839,5,B001B3LIP6,"This new episode was truly a delight!  It was like a reunion of old friends who have not seen each other for years, but once reunited all time between seems to have vanished and it was only yesterday.  The sets and use of the manor house interior were handled very well, like any home would change through the years.  The actors lost none of their magic and had the same repoir as they had all those years ago. They handled the absense of Mrs. Poo and Bravenger extremely well and they were mentioned, although they had passed away. Those who already have the entire series appreciate that this episode has been made available by itself.",1221264000,17,637,4.521739130434782
3480840,5,B001B3LIP6,"I am so very excited to see this reunion special.
For longtime fans of this series it's the best present ever.
To new fans, well, watch the original series from the beginning and you'll soon understand why the rest of us are thrilled to see these characters once more.
Penelope Keith can do no wrong in my book!",1218412800,12,311,4.379310344827586
3480841,5,B001B3LIP6,"For those, like me, who bought the original series DVD box set, the producers have decided to be nice and release this special seperately.  Thank-you!!!

For the most part, the gang is back.  Penelope Keith, Peter Bowles and Angela Thorne return 25 years later for an hour Christmas special.  It's Audrey and Richard's silver wedding anniversary and the couple prepare to celebrate in style. However, something is about to disturb life at the estate and Audrey, with the help of her old friend Marjorie, has to rescue 400 years of history. She also has to defend a community and save her marriage at the same time.

This show has not been shown on American TV (maybe this year on BBC America or PBS.)  But if you cannot wait, buy the dvd!  What is amazing that everyone is still around.",1217116800,48,786,4.611510791366906
3480842,5,B001B3LIP6,"Very fun follow-up to find out what has happened with Audrey and Richard. However, the best part is the ""other"" stuff on the disc. They have an interview with several cast members that talk about making the series and the follow-up that is fascinating. The director also talks about the challenges of re-creating the sets, etc. The extras on the disc are the best part for me and other family members who have watched it.",1412640000,,421,4.626666666666667

3480844,4,B001B3LIP6,"If you can recall the early British comedy, To the Manor Born, you will likely enjoy this return trip to the Manor and more humorous events with the original characters.  British comedy the way it used to be!",1397001600,,208,4.473684210526316
3480845,5,B001B3LIP6,"I have the whole series from 1982 and it is so funny, I watch them about every 6 months that's how much comical it is.
Very clean series without sex, blood and guts. My grand children will be able to watch it without asking questions what did they mean.",1377129600,,253,4.183673469387755
3480846,5,B001B3LIP6,I enjoyed watching the Silver Anniversary Special of one of the British Comedies I love. I hope more of these delightful comedies will be offered for sale.,1376265600,,155,4.777777777777778

3480848,5,B001B3LIP6,"I watched this program many years ago on TV and even though it is now very dated, it still is quite funny and interesting.  Peter Bowles was always good in all the shows he was in, even 'Rumpole of the Bailey,' it is great to see him in this program.  We take it out every so often to watch and since I am English, I love all the British programs.",1363996800,,347,3.942857142857143
3480849,5,B001B3LIP6,Thank you so much.  It arrived promptly.  We have not watched it yet as we are waiting for my in-laws to arrice from the UK,1358726400,,123,3.88
3480850,5,B001B3LIP6,"Richard and Audrey agree on very little, except that they love each other. So getting through twenty five years of marraige is indeed an accomplishment. But celebrating it, is as always, fraught with misunderstandings and well intentioned chaos. What fun!",1296950400,,255,5.4
3480851,2,B001B3LIP6,"I bought the original series DVDs when they first came out and watch them one or two times a year. I especially like the final episode which is much like the fairy tale about, ""They lived happily ever after.""

Not so. To understand part of the plot you should watch the 30 minute special first. It describes the increasing number of government regulations that are putting small, independent farmers out of business.

The most depressing part of the presentation is that the marriage has gone sour and Audrey and Richard have been reduced to the culturally lower class practices of keeping secrets from each other and playing underhanded, harmful tricks on each other. What is unforgivable is that Richard has made Audrey get rid of her dog. Fortunately there is a happy ending which I do not believe based on the 25 years of past experience. Any psychologist will tell you that the best predictor of someone's future behavior is their past behavior.

Then you need to have a lot of suspended disbelief. Richard, the experienced business tycoon is faced with a lack of staff. He does not have the gumption to (1) hire more on his own, (2) do his own laundry or send it out, and (3) do his own cooking, even if it is TV dinners cooked in a microwave.

Then you have to have business disbelief. Audrey owns the property yet has no control on what happens on it. A concert is to be held on the estate and yet there is no written contract. Richard can on a whim back out of the agreement. Another is that carrots that are not straight enough to be sold intact can easily be sold to be diced and put in soups etc.

One minor irritation is that there are several continuity errors. Another sad part is that in the rare shots of the outside of the mansion you can see serious degradation to the building that has not been repaired because of deferred maintenance. I feel sorry for heirs of wealthy people. They get an albatross (stately mansion in this case)that drains what little wealth they have.",1292112000,,1992,4.537604456824512
3480852,2,B001B3LIP6,"I enjoyed the series and didn't know of this episode
I bought it and watched it and decided, ""That's it?""
It's alright if you're into the series, but otherwise leave it where you find it.",1286668800,,187,4.371428571428571
3480853,4,B001B3LIP6,"This 25th Anniversary ""Silver Wedding"" special is a nice little coda to what remains one of the Beeb's best and brightest comedy series.  Peter Spence's TO THE MANOR BORN ran for three series, starring the inestimable Penelope Keith as the staunch Audrey fforbes-Hamilton, a woman who knows her place in the world (the historic Grantleigh Manor and Estate no less), but financial hardships prevent her claim to it!  Millionaire grocery store magnate Richard DeVere (Peter Bowles) snatches up the Estate and earns Audrey's wrath from the get-go with his grand plans of dragging Grantleigh - kicking and screaming if need be - into the hustle of the 1980s.  The final episode of TO THE MANOR BORN (watched by a record-breaking 24 million people during it's original transmission!) saw Audrey win back Grantleigh, and marrying Richard in the bargain.  Which sets the stage for the Silver Wedding special...

Whilst preparing for their silver wedding celebrations, there's trouble brewing for Audrey and Richard.  All of their neighbours' estates have been swallowed up by wholesale food company Farmer Tom's (""And what's wrong with wibbly-wobbly carrots?"" quizzes Audrey).  Richard knows exactly what's wrong with them...and the revelation he has for Audrey will send her into a tailspin!  Good old Marjory Frobisher (Angela Thorne) has taken residency of the Lodge - complete with her menagerie of stray animals.  And Audrey welcomes the arrival of nephew Adam (Alexander Armstrong).  Of course the passage of time has also meant the loss of beloved characters Brabinger and Mrs. Poo; however the script includes some nice remembrances of them.

Penelope Keith looses little step in re-assuming the character of Audrey.  She's still the glue holding the entire premise together.  And her chemistry with Peter Bowles is as palpable as ever.  Angela Thorne and Gerald Sim (as the Rector) add a nice touch of nostalgia.  Curl up and reunite yourself with the ""Manor"" family...it's every bit as magical as the original series.",1283558400,,2020,5.229813664596273
3480854,5,B001B3LIP6,You see them married and happy then something happens.  I do not like to give it away but it certainly well worth buying if you already have the series!,1282262400,2,152,4.241379310344827
3480855,1,B001B3LIP6,"This was a sad ending to an otherwise-wonderful series.  I mean SAD - I couldn't even bring myself to give it to my parents, for whom the DVD was originally bought since they adored the original series, to view; it went straight to resale.

Please understand: this series was the first VCR set I ever attempted to purchase, and I've worn out the tapes watching them over and over again because of the many facets that made the recordings great.

What possessed Keith and Bowles to give in to the making of this ""special"" with the writing and the directing offered is a mystery to me.  It was an amateur fabrication with an obvious plot lacking the timing and the character-appropriate approach of the original production, contrived to meet the Silver Anniversary criterion only.  Even worse, it gave cameo appearances to two of the remaining original characters that were ridiculously patronizing considering the amount of line(s) given them.

I'm not even going to read the others' reviews, since people are giving this four- and five- stars.  Me'thinks the reviewers are like me, sentimentally longing for more of the greatness that is normally a Keith and Bowles performance set in a traditional British background.

With apologies to the four returning stars: please don't buy this DVD - you'll not get tears of laughter but of regret for these perennial performers for not being given a more mature group of experts to make this idea actually work into something worthwhile for everyone involved.",1279584000,11,1501,4.952191235059761
3480856,2,B001B3LIP6,"For waiting 25 years it could have been a bit better.  It was good to see the old characters and missed the ones no longer with us.  It's inexpensive enough to purchase, but think you may only watch it the once and pass it on.  Great ideal, very lackluster execution.",1259625600,3,267,4.3
3480857,5,B001B3LIP6,"This was my favorite British comedy for years,  Also enjoyed Good Neighbors, Fawlty Towers, The Vicar of Dibley.
The humor was perfect, the situations incredible.  The wit excellent.
Do not care for the obvious [...], but these hit the nail on the head for pure entertainment.",1257120000,,276,4.978260869565218
3480858,1,B001B3LIP6,"I have the complete ""to the manor born series"" from the 70's  LOVE it and watch it frequently.

I was thrilled to see the Anniversary special and popped it into DVD as soon as I got it.

Very disappointing - the characters seem to have lost some of their ""pizazz"" and didn't click as well as they did in the original series.

The story line was very weak and the DVD much too short, I think they should have made it longer and put more story into it.

I wish I had found it used instead of paying full premium price.",1250553600,2,516,4.069306930693069
3480859,5,B001B3LIP6,"This was refreshing! To watch the entire series of, ""To the Manor born"", was delightful. Most of us always wondered if they would ever marry, and finally on the last episode they did. After that, we sat contemplating what would happen next.
  What a treat! Thank you!!!! Finally the writters realized that we wanted more and they came through for us. What a treat to find a special edition sequal to the years and years of watching the entire series over and over again.
  The Silver Anniversary special has a lot of twists and turns. Dear old Bravenger is no longer around but he was getting up in age as we all are...Margerie lives at the old lodge and as usual Audrey takes charge of the Manor and all that goes on.  Unfortunately a problem with the villagers makes for an interesting twist of fate. Who is the secret ""green farmer"" who so underhandidly is taking over the crops? What is happening to every one that has Audrey up in arms, and actually force her to move back to the lodge as an irratating house guest to Margerie? Is Deveres marriage to Audrey over? you'll have to watch the movie to see what happens.  The only thing wrong with this picture is there's only one! OK writters, do your thing and lets get some more episodes!",1249948800,2,1241,4.469026548672566
3480860,5,B001B3LIP6,I love this series and missed it when it went off the air.  I was so excited when I saw this dvd.  I rented it from Netflix but I couldn't resist adding it to my library.  I already own the series.  Since I'm an Anglophile I love most of the Britcoms.  This special about their 25th anniversary was fun and they still have the chemistry.  If you love the series you will love the 25th anniversary special.  Watch and see!,1239580800,2,421,4.1875
3480861,3,B001B3LIP6,"I expected the same quailty of humor in the amicable tension that occured between the main characters in the original series (circa late 1970's). I was disapointed.  While the 25th anniversary special was enjoyable and I DO NOT reget purchasing it, I wasn't as pleased with the comedic situations in which the characters were placed.  Rather than appearing to be a natural consequence of the character's circumstances, the tension between the main chacters (Audry and Richard) in this 25th anniversary special seemed contrived; therefore, the comedy was less satisifying.",1239235200,5,571,5.404494382022472
3480862,5,B001B3LIP6,"If you have not seen the full 3-year series, then I recommend buying the complete set. See my review of ""To the Manor Born-The Complete Collection"" which includes the Silver Anniversary Edition. It's all a 5-star.

This Silver Wedding Anniversary segment was done in the style of the original series created in 1979 through 1981. Even the canned laughter is included, as was done in typical fashion for BBC and USA television back then.  Not true for theater films.  So, the canned laugh addition to the more modern Silver Anniversary segment, just makes it fit so well after watching the previous 20 episodes and the Christmas special. It's all included in the Complete Collection. So unless you already own the original portions, buy it all and start from the beginning. You'll have a long hilarious time of it, promise.

This disc has English subtitles (SDH), a plus for some while watching British television.",1233100800,2,913,4.947712418300654
3480863,2,B001B3LIP6,"This silver Wedding anniversary edition gives the viewer the impression that it was written by a pepetually angry 10 yr old.  While the acting was as it was back in the ""old days"", the story line was just silly and even annoying.  Not at all like the regular series that ran years before this publication.  Too bad they didn't hire good writers with more imagination and maturity.",1231804800,4,380,4.641791044776119
3480864,2,B001B3LIP6,"When I heard that this DVD was out I ordered right away as I enjoyed the series years ago. I was very disappointed, however, as I felt there was too much bickering. There is enough trouble and disagreement in the world today without incorporating it in to what could have been a lovely cap to the series.",1231718400,5,304,4.350877192982456
3480865,5,B001B3LIP6,"This is one of my favorite British programs.

Although some of the original characters have passed on, it was so nice to have many of the original ones still acting as stately, yet silly as they were 25 years ago...
Highly recommended to anyone who loved the original.",1231286400,2,353,4.53125

Those who hadn't viewed the original series borrowed our DVDs to watch them too!

Penelope Keith is the best.  She once made a show called Spider's Web.  It was filmed more like a play than a movie and was very enjoyable.  Why isn't it on DVD?",1225411200,,365,4.042253521126761

Seeing the original characters/actors after all this time was truly a treat but we found the story for this special to be disappointing. The disaagreent between Audrey and Richard was contrived, to say the least and why introduce a new central character, the nephew (played well by Alexander Armstrong) and not give him anything to do other than being ""eye candy""?
