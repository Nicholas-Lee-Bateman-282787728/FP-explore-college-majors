8184197,1,B000OC12TW,"This was a sad excuse for a ""country"" workout.  There's no country music and only a small handful of the moves have a country feel to them.  The video seems barely rehearsed as the two girls supporting the instructor often struggle to get the choreography right.  She seems to make the routine up as she goes along and mumbles a lot.  I suppose I could recommend this to a beginner who doesn't need a very complicated workout because it was extremely boring for me and not at all challenging.  I had to put another workout video in right after this to make up for the lack of a decent workout.",1232582400,3,593,4.3545454545454545
8184198,1,B000OC12TW,"This video was one of the WORST I've ever used.  The instructions are poor, there are times where you can barely hear the instructor, and I became so disgusted with it that I turned it off a third of the way through and hopped on my treadmill instead!  Just NOT a good workout!  If you are looking for a great workout to dance music, I highly recommend MINNA's Cardio Emergency Workout.  It's to Latino music, and is fantastic.  You'll love the instuctor and can follow along very easily while still being challenged!",1200355200,6,517,4.576086956521739
8184199,1,B000OC12TW,Want a fun 45 minute dancey workout to country music.  You won't get it with this DVD.  The music is not country and the only thing country about the whole thing is the instructor has pig tails and boots on.  Even the people behind her can't follow her instructions and the moves are basically aerobics.  I bought one for myself and one for my neice as a Christmas present.  I just called my sister and said to throw it away before even opening it.  What a waste of money and time.,1197763200,7,481,4.230769230769231
