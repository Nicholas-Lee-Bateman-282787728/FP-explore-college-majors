7998628,5,B0000CBXYS,"There is no greater topic to discuss than eternity since you will be spending all your time there after you die. The deal is that you alone and only you can determine where you want to go. This documentary is divided into three sections: Revelation, Hell, Heaven. It discusses hell in a way that you'd never want to go there - no hope or love. It discusses heaven in a way that makes you feel elated and excited to go there - joy, comfort and hope. The music also creates such a longing for heaven near the end. I felt this was very well done and the facts are based on biblical references. I hope you will watch this and choose heaven as your eternal home. After watching this I'm buying a copy for a friend. This makes a perfect ""eternal"" gift.
