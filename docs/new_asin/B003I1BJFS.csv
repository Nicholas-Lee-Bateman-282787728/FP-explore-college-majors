8397246,5,B003I1BJFS,I purchased this DVD and I see no difference in the movie. All I know is that I inherited a master classic! My computer is set up to play these region 2 DVDs. This is a really cool movie! Rose is the best!,1363651200,,205,3.7906976744186047
8397247,2,B003I1BJFS,"unless you want  to get ripped-off please stick with the original 92minute of this film. this region code 2 edition is only 88minutes long. because i bought a copy
thinking it was 101 minutes, but its not!

be careful of european prints of certain films, not everything in europe is better then that of the united ststes. the only reason to really own an all region dvd player is the occasional difficult to find or hard to reach import dvd which may contain additional material banned from american prints.

improperly loading= region 0 and dvd-r discs don't always work in region 1 dvd players. i have found some 0 discs to be tempermental in loading time and incorrect
disc warning poping up onscreen.repeat loading doesn't always work.

failure=some dvd-r will read as no disc meaning the clone-copy coding in a region 1 dvd player not turning on properly and the disc having to be loaded multiple times to be able to get playback, this doesn't always work.

this can happen with both types of dvds depending on your brand of domestic dvd
