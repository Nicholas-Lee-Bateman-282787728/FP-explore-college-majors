7815292,5,6301785029,"The original film ""The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams"" was a success and now the tv series with Dan Haggerty and Don Shanks continuing their original roles.  This episode, ""Blood Brothers"" is mostly a re-filming (99% new footage) of the motion picture in a condensed form.  This episode concentrates more on the story of James Adams helping the Indian, Nakuma, heel after a bad fall, saving his life, and learning survival skills from the Indian.

  The ""Blood Brothers"" ceremony has been changed for the tv series version.  There is no cutting alove the arm, instead a leather string is cut by Nakuma, and symbolically wrapped around the mens hands together.

  Grizzly Adams daughter is not mentioned in this episode.

  Denver Pyle begins the story as he has written.

  Very Suitable for children to watch.

  More of the tv series is available on VHS.",1098489600,4,857,4.833333333333333
