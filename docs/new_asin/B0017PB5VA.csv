3174786,5,B0017PB5VA,"My kids and coaches enjoyed this entertaining and instructional video. It's great to see ball control skills broken down, but then also to see them from actual Premier League matches. This DVD will keep the attention of younger viewers.",1244937600,20,236,5.076923076923077
3174787,5,B0017PB5VA,"This DVD is great for the soccer fan who wants to get started in learning the game. I'm not a great soccer player, but the video helped me learn a step or two, and it was pretty cool to watch.",1209945600,5,192,3.825
3174798,5,B0017PB5VA,"Great clips of live action shots that are recreated through computer animations. The reviews on this were solid and they were not wrong. My son watched it and started practicing some of the moves right away. He would go back to it and review some of the shots to ""get them right."" This was well worth the money and gave him a chance to see some of the English players, even if it was a little dated.",1381622400,,399,4.194805194805195
3174799,3,B0017PB5VA,"This DVD is decent, but certainly nothing special.  Many youtube channels do a better job of explaining and breaking down the moves. This disc often leaves out crucial details, like when kicking the ball hard you should land on your kicking foot, or what surface of the foot to use at the end of the move to accelerate away.  As everyone else says the computer animation spins around way too much--making it hard to tell which direction the player is moving after  he completes the move.

Watch some decent youtube channels (online soccer academy, skillz and drillz, etc.) first.  If you've seen and practiced all that, then consider this DVD.",1372464000,7,643,4.8090909090909095

3174801,5,B0017PB5VA,"Although all the clips are reasonably old, they were all performed by great players.  The animated demonstration is good and reasonably helpful but does not always match exactly the moves.  Plan on watching the whole program into at least 2, if not 3 or more, different sections 'cos the moves are displayed 1 after another and each of them only takes up ~2-3 minutes so there are a little too many moves to go through all in a single shot.",1363046400,,440,4.4875
3174802,4,B0017PB5VA,"The video is a good overview of all the various kicks. I do think the digital images that show the kicks in slow motion could be done a little better...maybe a tad slower or in increments, but overall a worthwhile video to own.",1360886400,,227,4.3023255813953485
3174803,5,B0017PB5VA,"This was a great x-mas gift for my daughter.

3174804,4,B0017PB5VA,this video was a great video for my son to watch to get an idea of what kinds of skills he'll be able to pick up.  not very practical for actually teaching the skill.,1356739200,,166,3.8823529411764706
3174805,1,B0017PB5VA,The animation is terrible and a waste of time because it is too fast and too difficult to follow. - I just wonder what age group they thought they made this for. I have coached from 6 year olds to college students and probably couldn't use this even to train or teach adult coaches. Long video that looks like a bargain at the price but save your money and keep looking. I can't find anything out there worth paying for and 20 minutes for $25 is a real wast particularly if it is no better than this.,1355616000,,500,4.164948453608248

3174807,5,B0017PB5VA,I bought this DVD for my boys who play soccer and they just loved it.  They spent a whole day watching it repeatedly.  It was very important to us that it was in good condition. We are very happy with our purchase of this DVD.,1328832000,,226,4.0

The actual footage combined with instruction offers a great balance for learning and entertainment!  I'm so glad I bought this as a Christmas present!

3174821,5,B0017PB5VA,The format of this DVD is very conducive to learning moves that will improve your soccer skills. It shows a move broken down in animated form and then shows a pro player putting it to use in an actual game. It also tells when to use a particular move and when not to use the move. It has really helped me as a coach to show young players how to improve.,1316736000,7,353,3.9859154929577465
3174822,4,B0017PB5VA,"Entertaining, some of the animations make you a little dizzy, but overall its a good video.  Many great shots and moves even from a while back.",1316736000,2,143,4.5
3174823,3,B0017PB5VA,"I bought this DVD at a recent soccer convention.

I have lots of soccer coaching DVDs but I asked the salesman for a DVD that would teach the players skills, but the kids would also enjoy watching. He recommended Skill Factor to me.

General Idea:
The idea is EXCELLENT! The DVD combines computer animations of the skills with narrators instructing how each skill is done - and in a fun, bullet-point way, rather than a bland step by step format; that is then topped-off by video clips of the skills actually being put to use in the English Premier League.

Pros:
- Excellent general idea. I've found that kids today relate very well to computer animations in general, and the video clips show them how the skills are used in games.
- Huge list of skills covered. Lots of dribbling moves, but also tackling, juggling, receiving, etc.
- Entertaining narration. Most instructional soccer DVDs consist of someone demonstrating a skill and explaining it. This video does that, but there is less focus on the finer aspects, and more on the general principle, instead, the narrators often explain WHEN to use it: for example ""the 'double tap' is best used when the attacker and defender are square""; and also with a little humor: for example, while covering (I believe) the ""back door"" dribbling move, a clip is shown of it being used unsuccessfully against Patrick Vieira. The announcer then says something to the effect of, ""Remember, don't ever try to use the move against Vieira."" Despite how it may sound, the delivery of it is not at all lame or cheesy.
- Good clips
- Each move and skill is broken into a separate chapter, so it's easy to navigate. You can easily find specific skills from the menu, and can skip ones while playing it.

Cons:
- The only major con is in the computer animations.
-- First, some of them are hard to follow. You may need to play in slow motion if you really want to try to learn the skills.
-- Second, and most importantly, while their goal is no doubt to make the animations easier to follow, they inevitably begin to spin the screen during most of the animations. I have watched this DVD 3 times, and every time I have gotten dizzy from this after about 10 skills (and there are over 50). To be sure it wasn't just me, I watched it with other adults once and they both complained of dizziness from those scenes as well. I can imagine that it would be worse for children.

- Also, because so many skills are covered (and perhaps because of the dizziness factor as well), the DVD drags. Sure it's great to get so much packed into 1 DVD (they definitely give you your money's worth), but it is difficult to finish in 1 sitting or even 2.

Bottom line:
The dizzying effect is a MAJOR drawback. This would easily be a 5 star choice if it didn't give viewers a headache.",1297641600,45,2797,4.506903353057199
