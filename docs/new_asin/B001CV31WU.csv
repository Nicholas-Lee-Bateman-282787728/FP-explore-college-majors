8290076,4,B001CV31WU,"So this is an older episode of the God Rocks cartoon series.  While the storyline and music are great, the animation is odd.  We still enjoyed it very much, but the newer episodes are more visually pleasing.  My kids like it, but not as well as some of the newer episodes.",1296777600,2,272,4.294117647058823
