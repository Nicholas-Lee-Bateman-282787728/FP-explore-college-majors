8749156,4,B01B2QFMB2,I just bought this on 2/26/2017. The discs I received were marked NTSC and work in my mac dvd player in US. The video quality is typical of this type of instructional. Not overhyped music and HD like P90x but not like old VHS tapes either. Its true DVD filmed in a studio. I bought it to use as a refresher. I took Mas Oyama Kyokushinkai many years ago and it was a great work out. Looking to re-explore the discipline. The kata's are spot on and the instructor is informative. He is overdubbed with a womans voice as his original language is French. Moves are traditionally named in Japanese.,1488240000,,593,4.4
