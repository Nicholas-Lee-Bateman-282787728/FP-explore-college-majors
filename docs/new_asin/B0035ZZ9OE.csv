4071794,2,B0035ZZ9OE,"Gintama is one of my favorite series that was taken to the states, not only did they not dub this series, but charge as much as it would cost to buy a dub, but only add 13 episodes with some of the worst subtitles I've ever seen. Yellow Subtitles? Seriously? That's hard on the eyes and makes it even less fun to watch. This is the first product I bought from Sentai Filmworks, and I will say, I am severely angry how they portrayed this awesome anime.",1322265600,6,452,4.206896551724138
4071795,3,B0035ZZ9OE,"With all the praise I've been hearing, I expected more from this anime, but I found that it's just mediocre.
There's just so much better anime out there, that my expectations might be a bit high.
I'd give 2.5 stars for average, but I can't really do that, so I'll round up to 3.",1321660800,,278,4.166666666666667
4071796,5,B0035ZZ9OE,"Do you enjoy historical-esque anime? What about comical ones? & action anime? What if i told you this, Gintama, was a combining of all three!? Well it is. it has rich characters living in the period of Japan when the U.s. forced open the borders to trade, only instead of other people it is now aliens. Gintama is a ""jack-of-all-trades"" and will do anything for money. thats the basic premise without delving too deeply. This is one of those anime's that doesnt take itsself seriously, much like the manga, and will make fun of other popular anime and manga while poking fun at itsself. it has lots of japanese word play so watching subbed is a must. i cannot recommend this series high enough. watch the first episode on the net somewhere& i can asure you that you'll be laughing 3minutes in.",1310688000,,793,4.591549295774648
4071797,2,B0035ZZ9OE,"I read somewhere that Gintama was a good series so I decided to give it a try. I found it online, and at a very good price, but I didn't notice that it was in Japanese Audio with English subtitles. It was hard the follow all the action, take in the graphics, which is what I value most in Anime. The subtitles move pretty fast on the screen so it is pretty hard to take every thing in. If you can get the English audio versions, look for them first, even if you have to pay a little bit extra.",1287792000,2,493,3.94
4071798,5,B0035ZZ9OE,"Gintama is historical show that talks about the samurai story,but with a twisted aliens invades them, then the aliens when and the city become a futuristic place,like in all the other movies we watched. So, its about a guy name Gintoki,who does any job that pays,but except paying his rent! He meet a nerd name Shinpachi who gets beat up by his boss for spilling juice on this alien,which the alien cost the spill in the first place by tripping him. Time to skip to Kagura a alien whos body is much stronger than a human, she can break boulders,and she can move half as fast as sonic the hedgehog or the Flash. Also this show makes fun of every anime we have ever watch, and some times horror movies to day make fun of, overall I give this a 10 out of 10. Best anime ever!",1285027200,4,772,4.258503401360544
4071799,4,B0035ZZ9OE,"Since 2003, ""Gin Tama"" (which means ""Silver Soul"" has been a manga series that has entertained many ""Shonen Jump"" fans.  Written and illustrated by mangaka Hideaki Sorachi, the popular manga received an anime adaptation and has aired in Japan since 2006 on TV Tokyo and has since surpassed over a 100 episodes.  The anime series now makes its debut in the US on DVD courtesy of Sentai Filmworks with the first 13 episodes in ""Gintama - Collection 1'.

The series is directed by Shinji Takamatsu (""After War Gundam"", ""School Rumble"" series, ""SD Gundam""), series composition by Akatsuki Yamatoya (""Buso Renkin"", ""Blue Dragon"", Soul Eater"", ""Transformers: Cybertron""), character designs by Shinji Takeuchi (""Geneshaft"", ""Heat Guy J"", ""Planetes"") and music by Audio HIGHS.

""Gin Tama"" is a series that takes place during the Edo Period (Tokyo - 1860's) but in this alternate reality of the Edo Period, aliens known as Amanto have conquered Japan and because of the war against the samurai's, the Amanto have banned swords in public and are now co-existing with the humans (more like humans are forced to co-exist with the Amanto).  Also, technology has been shared with the people of Japan allowing space travel, giving them access to cars, mopeds, television and more.

The series focuses on the silver haired Gintoki Sakata and his two freelancers who will perform odd jobs for a fee, but sometimes these odd jobs turn out to be more destructive than realized.

The main characters of ""Gin Tama"" are:

  * Gintoki Sakata - The owner of ""Odd Jobs Gin"".  Often lazy, likes reading manga, picking his nose and is late on his rent payments.  Willing to take on odd jobs for a living but is also an excellent swordsman who despises the Amanto and those who co-exist with them.  Despite the sword ban, Gintoki is defiant towards the Amanto and carries a sword.
  * Shinpachi Shimura - A teenager who wants to learn the ways of the samurai and thus becomes a freelancer at Odd Jobs Gin.  Often the voice of reason but is hardly listened to and is often a person who receives some sort of punishment.  Lives with his sister Tae.
  * Kagura - An alien girl of the Yato Clan who looks human but has tremendous strength.  Kagura flee to Earth to earn money but also to get away from her violent Yato heritage.  In Earth, she has to hold an umbrella to prevent sunlight from damaging her translucent skin.  Loves pickled seaweed, eating, money and often has a temper.  She also is blunt about things that women don't say in public.

Other characters in the series include:

  * Sadaharu - Kagura's pet, a large dog looking inugami.  Loves to bite people and Kagura loves it because she takes his wanting to eat her as a form of playfulness.  Often used as Kagura's vehicle.
  * Otose - Owns Otose Snack House and the landlord for Gintoki.  Loves smoking and doesn't appear to be offended when Gintoki refers to her as an old hag.
  * Catherine - The feline female thief who works at Otose Snack House and at first, she seemed like a nice woman but in reality she's a trash talking person who can easily get into trouble.
  * Ayame Sarutobi (Sachan) - An elite ninja who loves Gin.  Only problem is that she's nearly blind without her eyeglasses.
  * Isao Kondo - Commander of the Shinsengumi.  A confident leader who has a low self-esteem when it comes to his rear end sprouting like an afro.  Infatuated with Shinpachi's sister Tae.
  * Toshiro Hijikata - The vice-commander of the Shinsengumi and loyal to Kondo.  An excellent fighter.
  * Sogo Okita - The best swordsman of the Shinsengumi but prefers to carry a bazooka.  He appears to not like his vice-commander.

VIDEO:

""Gin Tama"" is presented in 4:3.  Because the series is a comedy, character designs range from being detailed to being simple, depending on the scene.  But there is a good amount of detail on the backgrounds but if anything, the anime series is respectful towards the illustration and artwork of creator Hideaki Sorachi.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

As for ""Gin Tama"" is in Japanese Dolby Digital 2.0.  Voice acting is well-done and for the most part, the audio is clear and what would expect from a TV series.  For a more immersive soundscape, I chose to have my receiver set with stereo on all channels.  But overall, the 2.0 track is good.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Gin Tama - Collection 1' features trailers for upcoming Sentai Filmworks releases on disc 1 and on disc 2 are the clean opening and closing animation.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Gin Tama"" is a hilarious anime and I have to say that it is quite unique and breathes new life to action/humor-based anime series that are featured on ""Shonen Jump"" such as ""Bleach"" and ""Naruto"".

The fact that ""Gin Tama"" takes place during the Edo Period and humanity was beaten by aliens and now co-existing with them and sharing technology is quite unique.  But it's the characters that bring something different to the series.  Unlike other ""Shonen Jump"" heroes, the characters of ""Gin Tama"" are just odd.  The main protagonist, Gintoki is a booger picking, manga reading, lazy hero but when in battle, he's quick during his sword fights.  Kagura seems like a sweet girl but she's perverted (although her bluntness is more of naivety) in the manner she speaks and has this intense strength that makes her quite scary and then you get the character Shinpachi who tries to be the voice of reason but ends up being the person who gets the raw end of the deal.

But what can you expect when you have an anime series titled ""Gin Tama"" which is an interesting name by Hideaki Sorachi which is used as a pun on the word ""Kintama"" which means testicles.  ""Gin Tama"" is pretty much a comedy series as we see these odd people being lazy or on missions.  There are jokes that parody Japanese pop culture and even several nods to other Shonen Jump titles in the series.  But along with the comedy, there are episodes that have quite a bit of action scenes as Gintoki encounters quite a bit of alien enemies.

If anything, ""Gin Tama"" is a fun, hilarious and action-packed series but it's one of those series that is going to require your patience as there are over a hundred episodes in Japan.  This first collection only contains the first 13 episodes and the fact the series is not yet completed in Japan, similar to other ""Shonen Jump"" series such as ""Naruto"" and ""Bleach"", this is a series that you want to make sure you are in it for the long run.

Overall, ""Gin Tama"" is a series that is unique and a lot of fun to watch. I definitely look forward to the next collection.  Definitely recommended!",1272412800,31,8047,4.606638418079096
4071800,5,B0035ZZ9OE,"Gintama will parody anything and everything and every episode is hilarious.  Gin and his two associates take on any job to try and keep from being eternally penny-less and make fun of both Japanese and Western culture while doing so.  Some arcs have extremely good battles, up there or above any other shonen titles.

The quality on these two DVDs is excellent.  Subtitles seem accurate.  Note, it only has Japanese audio track, but then again it'd be too hard for anything to really translate over.  Another thing is that they have subtitles that explain some of the inside jokes and references, but those do seem to disappear too quickly, so you'll likely have to go back and pause it to read that.

I highly recommend this series.  Right now it's taking a break in Japan since it ran too close to the manga material, but it will take a while before these catch up and by then they'll be doing more episodes there.",1272326400,18,916,4.576687116564417

8389325,5,B0035ZZ9OE,This anime is awesome. I can never get enough of watching it. Anyone who loves comedy should watch this show.,1386806400,,109,4.5
8389326,5,B0035ZZ9OE,"Came on time, no damage, nice package. All in all I am happy with it, they did what they would said they would do.",1365638400,,114,3.7916666666666665
8389327,5,B0035ZZ9OE,"Just like what mifty said, gin tama means 'silver balls' but the japanese kanji that the author used literally means 'silver soul'. Keep in mind that the Japanese can say a word that homonyms but has a different meaning altogether.

As for my review, when I first saw Gintama 4 years ago, I thought it was about a man who has to fight the evil using his trusty sword along with his companions. I was half right and half wrong. Gintoki already fought the evil guys but failed, so now he's living the life of a lazy bum.

Gintama contains comedy and pure awesomeness, drama and spine-tingling fights. It will make you roll on the floor while laughing but when it comes to drama, it will make cry or shed a tear. I'm pretty sure that some of the heavy parts are not included in this set since the first and second episode are just fillers (or special), which means that it never happened in the manga. The actual canon episode starts at the 3rd episode. It is where Gintoki and Shinpanchi are introduced. 4th is where Kagura is introduced. If you really wanna know just how good and awesome gintama is, I suggest that you just continue on watching Gintama until you get past the 50th episode. Or if you want to see some action, watch the 58th-61st episode or the movie Benizakura.",1364342400,2,1277,4.452991452991453
8389328,5,B0035ZZ9OE,"Just a correction.  Gintama means silver balls, as in testicles, not silver souls as another person euphamistically said. Silver balls being less important than ""kin tama"" golden balls.",1359158400,,185,5.607142857142857
8389329,5,B0035ZZ9OE,"I am not that much of an anime fan, but THIS anime is my favorite TV show of any kind, EVER. GinTama is pure genius from beginning to end; I can stream anime for free all day long if I want to, but GinTama I will spend money on just because it is THAT. FREAKING. GOOD. It deserves to be supported; that's why I spend money on it.

GinTama is unlike most anime in that there is no central plot; there is no core goal toward which the whole series is driving. This is a purely, beautifully, wonderfully character-driven series. As an editor, I found this concept both dubious and daunting. As a fan, I cannot imagine this series being any other way than it is while retaining all its brilliance.

For the most part, GinTama is known for its comedy. This is certainly deserved; it's the funniest mass-media entertainment of any kind that I have ever enjoyed, although I realize that cultural bias and squeamishness will damage the impact of the hilarity for a lot of Americans and possibly other Westerners. I doubt many of those types will be looking into anime anyway, though.

GinTama is not all comedy, however; there are several serious arcs throughout the series which have powerful emotional impact, particularly for fans who have grown to love the characters. I actually have no idea if there would be any emotional impact at all for someone who is *not* a fan of the characters, because I cannot effectively put myself in that position at this point.

I am a writer and an editor; I've always loved books, still do, and am building a library of hardbacks that gives me a lot of satisfaction. However, I have to say in all honesty that no book and no other form of media has ever been able to plumb the heights and depths of my emotions to the extent GinTama does. When it's funny, I laugh until my sides ache; when it's not funny, I cry like Paris Hilton finding a wrinkle on her plastic face. Even the second and third times, when I already know what's coming.

People here have complained about the subtitles - I have no sympathy for anyone who gives bad reviews on that basis. If you have no capacity for cultural diversity, GTFO and go watch Jersey Shore. Dubbed anime is uniformly horrific, as far as I have seen, and the voice actors for GinTama in particular are - seriously - irreplaceable. Whatever it is, whether it's the actors themselves, the script, the material, all of it together, some mystical force, whatever - the characters drive the plot (if you can really even say there is a plot...?), and the voice actors have given life to those characters in ways no dubbing can duplicate. So yeah, learn to read faster. It's worth it.

I've had no technical difficulties whatsoever with the DVDs themselves; I love GinTama, love this first collection, and intend to buy them all.",1348272000,6,2796,4.559760956175299
8389330,3,B0035ZZ9OE,"I own many japanese audio anime. With this one however, I found myself rewinding to many times to watch the action after I read the subtitles.
  Obviously, I am not a purist. I prefer to watch the dubbed version of any anime. I do not understand why Sentai is putting out so many Japanese single audio releases. They would sell many more copies if they would release a hybrid format, and both groups of fans would be happy.
  Anyway,I have decided not to buy anymore anime without an English audio track.
Everything about this anime is awesome, and I mean Everything......except for the above mentioned distraction, otherwise this would have been a top star rating.",1343692800,,665,4.756521739130434
8389331,1,B0035ZZ9OE,"By this point I would hope that no one would argue that if you really felt like reading every single line of dialogue for a series it would be easy enough to simply buy the manga, it's fairly easy to find, however if you're going to charge this much money for a series, have the courtesy and decency to spend the money and have it dubbed into the language of the country you're attempting to market the product in!  I'm fairly sure this is the US Amazon site and until the wack jobs have their way, English is still the official language of this country.  Bottom line is you buy video to WATCH the video, no matter how fast a reader you are, you will miss something every time you glance down to read the dialogue, the only way to avoid that is to pause the movie every time someone speaks.  Which completely sucks if you are watching it with someone.  To deny this is only an attempt to lie to yourself.  I am not going to spend my money for any series not dubbed into English, I'm talking to you Sentai, get with the program.  You've finally started releasing great new material, stop ruining the experience for us or let someone else release it who will properly dub it.  Thank you, that is all.

**
Ya know, I knew there was going to be some shallow individuals who feel the need to try and attack others with a view point that is different from their own. For those people, so there is no misunderstandings, let me spell it out:

  If you are going to charge this much money for a series, spend the money on dub'ing it!

That's all I have to say about the matter. Deal with it, and trying to say that only slow readers would have issue with original score's + subs is like saying everyone who rides in taxis must suck at driving. Get a clue.",1338422400,7,1746,4.241691842900302
8389332,5,B0035ZZ9OE,"I loved this show since I first saw it on youtube, before it became popular on Crunchyroll.  It makes so much references to older anime shows that many people in the US aren't familiar with.  Many people I know had a hard time understanding the show, or trying to get why it had so much anachronism.  I made an ""Americanized"" explanation for those people:

'Let's imagine that Abe Lincoln wasn't killed by the actor who killed him, but by aliens. Those aliens took over the US, and brought all their technological advances to the country, making guns and cowboys obsolete. So, cowboys had to rely on more ""creative"" ways to make money. Because guns are now illegal, the main character uses a paintball pistol.

Then I tell them that if they find that explanation interesting, just imagine it in a Japanese setting; and it works!'

Makes sense, right?",1333843200,2,850,4.70945945945946
