3953165,5,B002MZZU1K,"Oh la! La! and Hot cha cha!  I really love these historical flicks and the accuracy of this film is dead on!  It's not well known among historians that German Women spent most of their time running about the landscape naked and schtupping every German lad they could.  This movie shows the truth brother!  The dialogue is mesmerizing as Col Von Whoever guides one his female charges into a hard fighting private's bed with crisp lines like ""Do him!  He's pretty cool!""  And, ""he Furher expects you raise a little Heil!  So get balling!""  Pardon my French.  I don't know who any of these lovely actresses are but each one has two wonderful assets fully on display!  Such talents ought not to be hidden!  What should be hidden perhaps are some 70s era butts and some, shall we say foliage?  Some wild foliage better left to no man's land.

3953167,4,B002MZZU1K,"I'll go along with Anthony's 4-star review, with these additions:
Video quality is very good, crisp and clear. No burnt out highlights, no blocked shadows. This is not a cheap burn. Sound quality is decent, easy to understand.
What surprised me about this film was the accuracy of the details. The Russian equipment was the genuine stuff, not repainted US Army surplus tanks and such. Real T-34s, PPsh submachineguns, etcetera. Same with the German equipment- MG 42s and 38s, MP 40s, antiarcraft guns- all real. Pity we didn't get to see any German armor. I would have loved to see a working MKIV, V or VI...
Anyway, this movie is well worth buying.
All of those beautiful woman in full-frontal nudity are just a bonus.
And it is funny in many places.",1300492800,90,751,4.696969696969697

If you really want to waste your money, throw it in the street -- Maybe a homless person will find it and purchase a bottle of Ripple with it -- Your money would then be of some use to someone.

Also, I guess my definition of ""Language:English"" is different than Amazon's!  When I see ""Language:English"" in the Product Details, I expect the performers (notice I DIDN'T say ""actors or actresses"") mouths to move in ENGLISH, and I expect the language that comes out of their lips to be ENGLISH!  I guess I was mistaken.  Amazon seems to think that as long as English is on the sound track, it is O.K. to call it ""Language:English"" -- Even if their lips are moving in German!  Funny, I always thought when a performer's lips moved in one language, and it came out in a different language, it was called ""dubbed.""  Sorry -- My mistake!",1388188800,6,987,4.438888888888889

3953229,1,B002MZZU1K,"Did not expect much. T&A flic. Pretty girls overacting. Typical for such. Production and  quality of original film quite good. DVD virtually unwatchable. I've not a high end player, but it would be nice if the video would play better than broadcast TV in a hailstorm.  I don't leave reviews typically, but this product deserved some criticism.",1320624000,20,343,5.0
3953230,3,B002MZZU1K,"After reading some of the reviews for this DVD, I decided to buy it, but was rather disappointed in the movie after viewing it. I guess part of the problem was not hearing the actual dialogue, as some things get lost in the translation. Another thing was it did not seem realistic to me as I wouldn't think there would have been that much nudity, and open sexual encounters back in the old days. However there was viewing excellence in the beautiful women, that really did not seem to care if they were wearing clothes or not.",1317427200,3,526,4.43298969072165
8374384,5,B002MZZU1K,"A lighthearted movie about a World War 2 German Luftwaffe camp filled with beautiful young women who prefer their clothing on the floor rather than on their bodies. The picture quality is very good, it's in widescreen format and the sound is clear (I have the Sinister Cinema version pictured above, so I can't speak for the other companies that have released this title). This is not a nasty exploitation movie like Ilsa or SS Hell Camp, Frauleins In Uniform is a fun, sexy romp that serves no purpose other than to show naked women and show them often.",1501977600,,554,4.606060606060606

8374388,5,B002MZZU1K,"First off, this movie was excellent. A truly riveting, emotional portrayal of young German men and women during the late years of the war. The struggle and the horrors these individuals chose to endure, both for the love they felt for their Fhrer, and the nationalistic pride they had for their Homeland. The icing on the cake was the extraordinarily beautiful, sexy, natural women. The female form shown in this film was a work of art in its own right. This is quite possibly the greatest film ever made. It was, and is worth every penny I paid for it... 100 times over.",1471392000,,571,4.553398058252427
