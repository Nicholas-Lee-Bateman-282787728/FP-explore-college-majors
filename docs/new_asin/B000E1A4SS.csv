However , I would order again !",1357603200,,169,4.121212121212121
8103786,5,B000E1A4SS,"I purchased ""Freedom is Paradise"" and ""Lessons at the End of Spring"" a couple of decades ago, and these are among my most treasured films.  Thanks to reviewers on Amazon, I purchased ""Greenhouse Effect"", and it proved to be an equally stunning movie--very touching, quite exotic, true to life, and mesmerizing. Highly, highly recommended!!!!!!!",1351296000,,344,5.37037037037037

A nice touch was the seller included a 'cheat sheet' on what the Russian DVD menu system means in english (I think the film has English subtitles, but you have to navigate in Russian, that I remember).",1281916800,2,245,4.23404255319149

The set-up:  Rita, 18 years old, pregnant, and a new arrival in Moscow. Her belongings, papers, and money are stolen. She has no way of contacting her Moscow friend. A desperate phone call to mother ends in abandonment. Mute, a 14 year old street kid does what he can to survive. Their meeting seems inevitable. He shares with her his shelter, a greenhouse.
The storyline: Rita adjusts to being a street person while Mute adjusts to an adult in his life who soon turns to be his charge. Mute loses his best friend, another street kid, for lack of an operation. No one of 14 years should have to undergo holding the ashes of his friend. Rita supports him through the ordeal and their relationship is further solidified.
The denouement: Mute takes a radical and violent step to save Rita, and perhaps himself. As he is spirited away by the police he leaves with Rita a chance to save herself. She takes it. Now, in Greece, expecting her child, she finds a warm refuge and tells Mute, in her thoughts, that all is well and she awaits him.
This film just drips Russian soul. I was so happy to understand the dialogue that did not make it to the subtitles. Also, as mentioned by another reviewer, Western film makers would not make a film like this. Or perhaps the truth is that they cannot make a film like this because they have never experienced such a universe of hardship and absence of sexual overtones. I dunno, just a thought.
Again, please buy a 'region free' DVD player so you can experience a world of film.",1197936000,6,1571,4.473867595818815
8103789,5,B000E1A4SS,"This is an edited version of the plot synopsis hidden within the page, which some people don't bother to read. It's a story of two teenagers; a small-town girl alone in an unfamiliar city and a 14 year old boy who makes his living on the streets, showers in a car wash, and sleeps in a greenhouse. When the girl arrives at the train station, her baggage is gone. She has no papers, no money, and she doesn't know the address of her new friend. But it's the boy who comes to her rescue. Interesting relationship film! The ending demonstrates the sacrifice that some will make to ensure the future of the one they care about
This is a great Russian film. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Foreign film makers have the courage to make good movies about children that the American studios are afraid to make.",1194652800,2,802,4.462585034013605
