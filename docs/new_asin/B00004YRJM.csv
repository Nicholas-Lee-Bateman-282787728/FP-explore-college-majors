7927431,3,B00004YRJM,"I am one of those 'hard core anime fanatics' that likes to watch everything from Inuyasha to Trigun to Cardcaptor Sakura, but I still can't help but love this series! To me, it has a charm that other series that people tend to compare this to just don't have. I've never cared for Pokemon, but I love Flint!
The only major failings that I feel these DVD's have is one: the fact that they don't include a subtitled version with an original Japanese audio track. That made it very unpopular with people such as myself, who tend to dislike american dubs. I believe that since this series aired on FOX kids, they should have included a subtitled version to make the series worth buying on DVD. After all, if you just wanted the dubbed version, you could have recorded it off TV.
The other problem that I had was that I also don't care for the fact that they released so few episodes per disk.
Overall, if you just want a series that will make you smile, roll your eyes, and laugh, this series is the one for you!",1086220800,,1008,4.338624338624339
