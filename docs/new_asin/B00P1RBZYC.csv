6781082,5,B00P1RBZYC,"Supernatural is a good action packed television series about hunting demons. It is never boring because there are always different kind of demons that they fight or there are old enemies. There is a lot of comedy in it so it won't become boring once watching it. It's about two brothers who travel to different states to uncover mysterious deaths, they meet new people and fight demons to prevent any future deaths. Its has pretty good acting in it and they try to make everything look very real. I would recommend this show series and it should be added to your watch list.",1457568000,2,574,4.58252427184466
6781083,5,B00P1RBZYC,Amazing show.  Love the box set. It keeps all seasons in one neat box and each season only has about 4 discs each.  Great picture quality and sound from the blue ray discs.  Would highly recommend for any fan that doesn't want to take up a lot of space in the shelf for all of the seasons.,1457136000,,289,4.035087719298246

6781085,1,B00P1RBZYC,"Product advertised in pictures and description do not match product sent!! Buyer beware!!! Seasons 3 and 4 discs have no menu, and seem to have been edited together in one long movie style where you cannot select a single episode. Final episodes on both seasons are missing the season recap portions at the beginning of the episodes (3.16 and 4.22). Product packaging states product is from UK not USA. These are not the full seasons of Supernatural!!",1451606400,26,451,4.87012987012987
6781086,5,B00P1RBZYC,"as i start season 10 on Netflix,i must say it has been a fun ride with the Winchester Brothers in the back seat of Dean's Impala ""Baby""
The first few seasons had them fighting mostly Demons,Monsters and then some. Now,towards the end it's about heaven and hell and the battle between Angels & Demons. Some exciting and funny episodes in between.
Crowley,the king of Hell is fun and Cas,their Angel friend has been with them a while now.
great fun!",1449964800,,447,4.6

When I first started watching Supernatural, I thought that I wouldnt like it. But I kept going and I ended up loving the show!!! I do have some bad things and good things though

THE SUMMARY:
 Sam and Dean, who are played by Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles, go around the country saving people from supernatural beings.

THE GOOD:
 I love the two main characters, Sam and Dean. They share such a good chemistry on and off of the show.
 Deans instinct to protect Sam at all times caught my attention at the first episode, and after that too.

THE BAD:
 The Cliffhangers!!! They always had me at the edge of my seat.
 The Characters dying!! I didn't like how they (the directors) were always taking off a bunch of good characters.
COMPARING TO OTHER MOVIES/SHOWS:
Supernatural is often compared to Arrow, Once upon a time, and Game of Thrones, and The Flash.
SPECIAL EFFECTS:
Some special effects are where the show was filmed, how many cameras they used to film the show, and the negative format they used to film the show.

OVERALL RATING:
I would rate this show 13+ because of the language and the fighting.  Otherwise, this is an amazing show and I would watch this all over again if I could!",1449705600,,1216,4.583333333333333

6781090,4,B00P1RBZYC,"everything is perfect except the edges on the box Were kind of dented, like the box fell or something but that's fine and for some reason on season 3 disc 3 the disc was unreadable on my playstation 4 but every other disk work just fine. Kind of weird, but other than that it was good. P.s. I love the way that the box smells on the inside lol",1443052800,2,343,3.9855072463768115

I recently ordered both 4&5 and they should be arriving today, June 23rd so that I can at least, see what happened during the missing episodes.",1466640000,5,310,4.535714285714286
8686097,5,B00P1RBZYC,"This is a great binge watch. I have completely enjoyed it to the point that I am at- (Season 5). I am looking forward to more.

Seasons 1-3 are probably fine for most young pre-teens to watch. Is there some swearing? Yup. Is there some blood? Of course there is- this is two men in their early to mid twenties, brothers, fighting monsters. Each week brings a new monster of the week, while at the same time they are searching for their father and the demon that killed their mother. But mostly the shows are predictable and enjoyable. The camaraderie between the brother's is strong and they grow closer as they work together.

And while this is Near the end of season 3 and through out season 4 the show gets darker in nature. Dean and Sam, the brothers start fighting. The shows get bloodier. In one scene, for example, Sam drinks blood from a demon and eventually he is addicted to demon blood. Each brother is convinced they are on the side of right in an epic battle of good vs evil. This is not something I would allow a young preteen to watch.

I like that there are references to movies I know. I also like that some of the music I know from the 80's is played. I really like that this is a long running series, even though it does get darker. Most of the shows have a sense of humor sprinkled through out which makes them much more enjoyable. Even at some of it's darkest moments there are still those moments that will make you quirk a smile or chuckle. That is a plus.

Most of these shows, especially the further I watch the series have a more tense feel to them and many of them end on cliff hangers. In fact, I would stop several times to see if I was watching a season finale the cliff hangers are that big. One of the other things I don't like is that there are so many levels and layers that you never really know where the show is going at any given time. This ramps up the stress and keeps me up too many hours late at night watching the show.

Well worth the time to watch. Enjoy!",1464393600,,2000,4.211488250652741
