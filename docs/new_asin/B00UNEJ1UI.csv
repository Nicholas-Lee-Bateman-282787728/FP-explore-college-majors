7062461,5,B00UNEJ1UI,"Movie is very well done and closely follows the Sylvia Nobel book.  Have read all of Sylvia Nobels  books.  Love the Arizona setting of Wickenburg (Castle Valley) and live in Black Canyon City, Az. where much of the movie was filmed last summer.",1435276800,2,245,4.651162790697675
7062462,4,B00UNEJ1UI,"This movie was excellently done and match the book written by Sylvia Nobel.  We enjoyed the great Arizona scenery in the movie and the actors were very authentic.  I really felt like I was right there with Kendall O'Dell in her investigations throughout the movie. Highly recommend this movie!""",1434153600,2,294,4.979591836734694

7062470,4,B00UNEJ1UI,"LOVED THE MOVIE , but then, I read the book prior to seeing movie!  The book was much better, because it was so well written by the one and only Sylvia Nobel.  Movie lacked good direction;  actors did the best they could to handle the missing link. Will see it again because the Arizona landscape was worth watching over and over again",1441843200,3,335,4.370967741935484
7062471,5,B00UNEJ1UI,"This is a great little movie with action and suspense, beautifully  filmed in the Arizona desert. A modern day western with a surprise ending. I thought the acting was exceptional considering it was a modestly budgeted indepent film. particularly noteworthy was the performance of Teri Lee as Ginger the busybody secretary at the newspaper. Suitable for my teenaged granddaughter too.",1441238400,,384,5.4
7062472,2,B00UNEJ1UI,The sound quality was terrible. Someone fired what looked like a cannon and it sounded like a cap gun. The girl's make-up at times made her look like Tammy Baker. She sneaks into the sanctuary in a totally unblleivable way & suddenly its night & walking around with a flash light trying not to be seen  geez. I felt like I was watching a high-school play rather than a movie. The scenery was pretty & so was Daniel in shots where she had little makeup.,1440201600,,452,4.317647058823529
7062473,5,B00UNEJ1UI,good product good service,1440028800,,25,5.5
7062474,1,B00UNEJ1UI,"This is the stupidest movie! The big name actors , (Daniel Baldwin, Dean Cain, Eric Roberts) along with the nearly 5 stars caught my eye! What a waste of money and time. The acting is amateurish, the script is corny, and the plot is predictable! Bushwa",1439683200,,252,4.5
7062475,3,B00UNEJ1UI,not much depth but a good one to watch if you have nothing else to do,1438905600,,69,3.375
7062476,5,B00UNEJ1UI,"Very good. I enjoyed story, scenery and acting. I love all of this series of books. Lived in AZ and know most of the places described in Kendall O'Dell books.",1438732800,3,158,4.3
7062477,5,B00UNEJ1UI,"I loved it. I may be slightly biased, but I really do love this movie. Rebekah Kochan was amazing as always. She pulls off every emotion. What a great cast. And way to take Sylvia Nobels fabulous novel and turn it into a wonderful movie.",1438646400,3,237,4.288888888888889
7062478,4,B00UNEJ1UI,"If you like thrillers based on factual events, this first movie installment of Sylvia Nobel's ""Kendall O'Dell"" series is for you.  The intrepid investigative reporter finds herself in the middle of a murder mystery in a small Arizona town.  This is a ""little movie"" that mixes intrigue, humor and romance but has its share of ""star power"" as well. It is also suitable for family viewing.  We're looking forward to the next book in the series coming to the big screen.",1438646400,3,467,4.7407407407407405
7062489,5,B00UNEJ1UI,"This movie stays true to the storyline of the original novel by Sylvia Nobel.  It does a great job portraying a serious subject matter while being entertaining.  It is unique in that it is clearly an Arizona tale, shot in Arizona and made with the help of those who know Arizona best, like Sylvia Nobel.",1438646400,4,303,4.490909090909091
7062490,5,B00UNEJ1UI,"The book is wonderful and the movie lives up to its original, the first book of the series. A great mystery well presented and put together. Thoroughly enjoyable.",1438560000,3,162,4.821428571428571
7062491,5,B00UNEJ1UI,"I rented it first, I enjoyed the story line, loved Kendell's character, I had to buy it at the video store where I rented it! Definitely enjoyable to watch!",1438041600,2,156,4.413793103448276
7062492,5,B00UNEJ1UI,Great suspense and thriller. Acting by well known and new actors and actresses was done well.  Meet new actors and actresses local from AZ and well known from California,1437609600,3,169,4.827586206896552
7062493,5,B00UNEJ1UI,Great Writer! Perfect depiction of the book! Loved watching it unfold in the movie! Can't wait for Devil's Cradle! Bring on the 5 part movie series! :-D,1437436800,,152,4.666666666666667
7062494,5,B00UNEJ1UI,Great Movie! Enjoyed it!,1437436800,,24,5.25
7062495,5,B00UNEJ1UI,Enjoyed this movie because it followed Sylvia's book closely and I love that it has a heroine!  Girl power!!  The scenery was beautiful and makes me want to take a drive through the locations where the film was shot.  Good family friendly film.,1437004800,3,244,4.627906976744186
7062496,4,B00UNEJ1UI,Great flick.  Watched twice,1436918400,,27,5.75
7062497,1,B00UNEJ1UI,Absolutely HORRIBLE acting even from the REAL STARS!! Disappointed!,1435968000,,67,6.555555555555555
7062498,5,B00UNEJ1UI,This was a great mystery!  We enjoyed it very much.  OK for the whole family.,1435536000,2,77,4.066666666666666
8707535,1,B00UNEJ1UI,Anyone giving this movie more than 2 stars is not being honest. The main actress is absolutely horrible and the entire movie is cheesy at best. The storyline was there and the scenery is nice; however the terrible acting and ridiculous scenes ruined the possibility of a good film.  Complete waste of time. Wish I had read the book instead.,1490745600,,340,4.666666666666667
8707536,2,B00UNEJ1UI,"It was obviously a good story but the movie was sadly terrible....It was so bad it was almost funny. The production was terrible, the actors mediocre, was there ANY direction?  Too bad, but the budget must have run out to do it right because the story line was great.",1488758400,,267,4.448979591836735
8707537,4,B00UNEJ1UI,"beautiful desert scenery, good story, adequate directing, good acting be the ""name"" supporting actors, sometimes frightenly bad acting by others, mediocre performance by the lead. The last 15 minutes are painful to watch with lame action and pathetic dialog.
The script is ok but starts interesting threads that go nowhere.
So why give it 4 stars? Good mystery, a heroine that is not the standard skinny Hollywood type, and a distinct lack profanity and nudity.",1487376000,,461,5.16
8707538,4,B00UNEJ1UI,good actors for the most part.,1482364800,,30,4.166666666666667
8707539,1,B00UNEJ1UI,"The book was excellent and I felt like this could have been so much better. This movie was a waste of time. The acting was terrible. Kendall's red hair and makeup made her look a lot older than she is. There are a lot of good ""cheap"" movies out there, but this one missed the mark. Not worth my time or money.",1454630400,,309,4.0
8707540,5,B00UNEJ1UI,"So pleasantly surprised to see how much the story line of the book was followed. Loved the acting, the gorgeous Arizona scenery and absolutely can't wait for the next one! 5 Stars because of how totally enjoyable it was to watch...",1452297600,,231,4.658536585365853
8707541,2,B00UNEJ1UI,Mediocre was disappointed looked forward to seeing Eric Roberts and he seemed to be in poor health.  Received the movie well packaged and early.,1449446400,,144,5.0
8707542,3,B00UNEJ1UI,"Well, folks, . . . this little movie ""gem"" may not be what you would expect. The movie title, cover art, PG-13 rating, and actors involved, would likely suggest to you that this is an hour and forty minute B-grade action thriller. That is simply not even remotely the case. This movie can best be described as a very low budget, campy, ""Hallmark-esq"" style mystery (with very slow pacing). There is very little ""action"", save for the final fifteen minutes, and virtually no ""thrill"" whatsoever. During the mid point of this film, there is actually a scene involving dialogue between the primary female character and Dean Cain's law enforcement character, and she completely ""flubs"" her delivery of a line. Being such a well rounded pro, Dean Cain does his best to cover for her in a way that helps mute the damage, but the simple fact that they didn't bother to re-shoot that segment pretty much tells you all you need to know about this little movie. I have absolutely no earthly idea how this film received a PG-13 rating, as it plays out much more in the way that a mild ""PG"" flick would. If you happen to be conditioned to watching Lifetime and Hallmark movies, you'll probably come away from this thinking that it was ""okay"", but not great. If you don't necessarily enjoy sitting through that style of a film, then you should probably avoid this. If you're looking for a family compatible film, you would be far better off with ""Facing Fear""(Dean Cain), ""Storm Rider""(Kevin Sorbo), ""Avenging Angel""(Kevin Sorbo), or any of the ""Goodnight for Justice"" series by Luke Perry. If you happen to be looking for a film that is primarily ""guy"" compatible, virtually ANY other science fiction or action film would be a better choice than ""Deadly Sanctuary"". Quite frankly, I'm a little surprised by so many 5 star reviews. Even if someone happens to like this ""type"" of film, this particular one just isn't that well done.

I primarily wish for you to understand, that this movie is likely very different from what you would expect given the title, cover art, PG-13 rating, actors involved, the offered description, and overly generous 5 star reviews. In actuality, it is very much an ""average"" grade Hallmark-esq style movie (with all of the campy elements and slow pacing that you would expect from that ""flavor"" of film).

Choose accordingly, and GOOD LUCK ! ! ! ! ! !",1448668800,,2367,4.742718446601942
8707543,5,B00UNEJ1UI,"Sylvia Nobel""s Arizona based mystery Deadly Sanctuary gives us the sights and sounds of Arizona as they really are. True to the book, great for families to enjoy together.",1445558400,,171,4.931034482758621
