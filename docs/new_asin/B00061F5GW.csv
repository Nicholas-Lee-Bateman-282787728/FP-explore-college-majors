8036349,4,B00061F5GW,I like the Bible and so I would rather have the real thing but this animated version was enjoyable. Great for the children.,1392422400,,123,4.391304347826087
8036350,5,B00061F5GW,This is just one of multiple titles from this same series. My kids and their friends love all of these. They watch them over and over with renewed interest each time and we discuss them afterwards.,1381881600,2,197,4.5
8036351,5,B00061F5GW,"I really have to commend NEST on this series of animated Biblical stories. They are well done, high quality animation, and are very respectful of the source. This story is one that no one seems willing to tackle, Elisha did so much in the bible, you don't want to leave anything out. This is a great opportunity to finally see the great acts of the prophet in a visual form, and it is well done. I have 2 minor issues, the first is that in the attempt to cover as much as they could they and to rush through some incidents, but if they had spent more time on each and skipped some I would probably not have liked that either. You just can't have it all in the short time frame they had. I suppose the story could use a feature length film, and 30 minutes is not enough. The only other issue is that they show Elisha's helper time and again hoping to profit himself from situations, when it is only recorded once in the Bible. I am sure they did this to better explain what happens to him as a result, so I do not fault them for this and will keep the video for repeat viewing. Some of the NEST titles are on DVD, but are very expensive so mine are all VHS for now. My favorite in this series is the prophet that came before Elisha, that is Elijah. If you start buying these, to me that is the best story they have done of the ones I have seen so far. If you like Biblical animation, another series to check out is the Testament Bible in Animation series from Wales.",1263600000,5,1465,4.125874125874126
8036352,5,B00061F5GW,"This was a great animated feature, and I look forward to seeing other titles from this company. First of all, the story of Elijah and the prophets of baal is one of my favorites in the Old Testament of the Bible. I have another animated feature of Elijah from ""Testament: Animated Stories of the Bible"", that is terrific and did not think this could match up to it, but it was great.
The animation, characters, sound, and story quality were all very well done. Believable characters, and very exciting. All animated and live action features of the Bible stray from the scripture in order to fit the story into the allotted time, and the changes they made in this short episode are not offensive at all. I bought the VHS as the DVD was too pricey for me right now. The picture was clean and crisp on our big screen. About 30 minutes, and I recommend.",1260921600,2,849,4.448717948717949
8036353,5,B00061F5GW,"These Bible videos are some of the very best we've seen.  They are accurate, and are beautifully animated by the former director for Walt Disney productions, Richard James Rich.  He's known for The Black Cauldron, The Fox and the Hound, Pete's Dragon, Winnie the Pooh and The Rescuers.  The story of Elijah is very exciting, and includes such miracles as the jar of oil and the flour that didn't run out and the challenge to the prophets of Baal.  I highly, highly recommend these videos, and this story in particular is a night time favorite in my home!",1139529600,5,554,4.622448979591836
