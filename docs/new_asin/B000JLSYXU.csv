2676874,5,B000JLSYXU,"I purchased this entire collection and I advise you to do the same.  It is a great educational and entertaining experience.

Marty Stouffer is a very likeable host and narrator.  He is a teacher and also enjoys the wonders of the wilderness in a way that really speaks to the heart of the viewer.

I've been waiting for this series to hit dvd for years.  So instead of haveing to buy a ""thousand"" vhs tapes wih inferior quality- this set was a great choice.  I'm happy they finally got around to it.

You know, it is the photography that really brings the show to life.  Especially on a big screen TV.  You will see creatures you have seen before and other creatures that you did not know.

Where do they live?  What do they eat?  What about mating season? Even what kind of personality they have.

After watching so much junk dumped onto the big screen these days, the is an extremely welcome alternative.",1173571200,24,906,4.451219512195122
2676875,5,B000JLSYXU,"As a professional biologist, it is my view that one cannot say enough good things about the complete 12 seasons of ""Marty Stouffer's Wild America"" series that are currently available in two separate 12-DVD sets (seasons 1 - 6 and seasons 7 - 12).  Both volumes, collectively containing some 120 half-hour episodes, cover a great breadth of North American wildlife (and, given their high level of educational entertainment, they are notably very affordable).  While the focus is largely on birds and mammals, there are several episodes devoted to reptiles, invertebrates (e.g., butterflies and mollusks), National Parks, human-wild animal interactions, animal adaptations, and plants/trees.

Having been produced primarily through the 1980s and aired on PBS, the greatest strengths of the ""Wild America"" series can be summarized as follows:

*educational family entertainment par excellence

*riveting wildlife-in-action scenes throughout; this often consists of a predator in pursuit of prey (almost always shown in both real time as well as slow motion), foraging activities, mating behaviors/rituals, and newborns exploring their environments

*superb environment or habitat scenes that function to give us a better sense of how the organism under consideration survives

*interesting, clear, concise narration delivered in Marty Stouffer's uniquely relaxed manner; Stouffer's judicious and intelligent use of commentary allows the scenes to largely speak for themselves, yet one always feels informed on some important basic biological aspects of the organism

*minimal intrusion of the film crew upon the wildlife; we generally sense that every effort was made to capture the organisms in their natural state, independent of human influence (there's no jumping on or wrestling with alligators)

*Stouffer's simple summary at the conclusion of each episode, always made with a view towards appreciating and conserving the featured organism(s) and its/their environment

*pleasant accompanying music (the theme ""tune"" for the series is catchy)

*the capacity to continue to inspire new and future generations to better know and appreciate the native North American wildlife while also taking up conservation as a cause

*a documentation of much late 20th century North American (mostly macrofauna) wildlife

Because the episodes are almost all of excellent quality, it is rather impossible to decide just which ones to discuss in a bit of detail.  Thus, I'll focus on a few that I recently watched.

""Cliffhangers"" (season 7, episode 1) introduces the viewer to the mountain goats of Montana's Glacier National Park.  The animals are seen up close and gingerly moving about on some extremely sheer cliffs.  A newborn ""kid"" is doted on by its mother as it tests its new legs for the first time.  She intervenes when the baby's unsure initial footsteps take it too close to the cliff's edge.  The golden eagle is shown soaring among the valley walls as we are informed that this bird, capable of knocking the baby animal off the mountainside, represents the greatest predatory threat to the newborns.  The baby goats grow throughout the spring and summer and, following the adults, descend to salt-lick areas to obtain vital minerals essential to their coats.  This makes all members susceptible to predation by bears.  But it is the winter avalanches that claim more mountain goat lives than anything else.  Such is the price that must be paid to occupy this niche that is generally unavailable to other mammals.  We see also that as many as 80% of the born-this-year mountain goats do not survive the cold of winter, their body mass often being too small to retain sufficient heat for this season's duration.  In the spring, we again see newborn mountain goats, and the cycle begins anew.  The viewer comes to realize that life for the mountain goat is constantly beset with danger and that nature has not lessened her hardships for this magnificent animal, despite considerable human encroachment on and destruction of its habitat.  This is nature and, characteristically, Stouffer does not shy away from its stark reality.  One thus realizes that the mountain goat, like all wildlife, is a treasure that, as citizens of world, we all need to preserve.

""Birds of Prey"" (season 8, episode 4) has an incredible scene in which a hare is simultaneously chased down a mountainside by both a fox and a red tailed hawk.  The viewer actually sees all three animals (again, in slow motion) in one of the shots.  Who do you suppose emerges victorious in this scramble?

""Olympic Odyssey"" (season 8, episode 7) introduces us to the environment of Olympic National Park in Washington State.  While focusing on the dramatic and diverse animals residing there, certain close-up scenes of water-laden plant life poignantly draw us into the details of this unique rainforest realm.

""Feathered Jewels"" (season 3, episode 2) showcases the various species of hummingbirds that live in North America.  While of course showing excellent footage of these tiny birds, this episode is also remarkable for the clear explanation it provides of their distribution.

In ""King of Snakes"" (season 5, episode 3) we are shown the five striking color patterns of the king snake.  What might you guess happens when the non-venomous king snake encounters the highly toxic Pacific rattle snake?  The result might surprise you!

Episodes 4, 5, and 6 of season 4 are devoted to the cutthroat trout of Yellowstone Lake and the upper Yellowstone River.  Given that within the past 10 years or so these fishes have been greatly reduced as a result of the illegal (accidental?) introduction of the lake trout to Yellowstone Lake, it is commendable that this document of the Yellowstone cutthroat trout in its ""hey day"" exists for the general public.

""Marty Stouffer's Wild America"" series deserves a place in every naturalist's/conservationist's/biologist's video library.  I anticipate that it will continue to inspire conservation ideals among generations for countless years to come.  Indeed, with its profuse employment of up-close scenes and replays in slow motion that allow the viewer to both savor and study the many natural dramas presented, it easily earns a five star rating.",1172016000,23,6250,5.289766970618034

2676887,5,B000JLSYXU,"They came very quickly and in mint condition . The whole family loves these . They portray the reality of nature with tact , awe and the beauty and majesty of nature . The music and voice of our old friend ( if you were privileged to grow up in this era as I was ! ) Marty Stouffer and all the familiar focus on education , while a humorous , pleasant attitude permeates as well . We love them . If we are avoiding  the jarring action and music so common in movies these days these are perfect for a calm and entertaining evening . We also come away with interesting information on nature we had not previously known . Have had them and viewed so often the cases fell apart and scratched  a few DVDS , so these are replacing those . A better price then in the store as well . The one little qualm is they can be a little tricky getting out of the case . The DVDs are all stacked on one side in the hard plastic case and have that pop out aspect common in DVD cases , older children and adults may be best at putting them in . Oh one more nice feature , there are many shows on one DVD so you can plop down and watch a few without changing the DVD . Kinda nice .",1453507200,,1161,3.8945147679324896

2676918,2,B000JLSYXU,"At best this series has stunning actual wildlife footage, e.g. Bighorn Rams dueling.  At worst there are many seemingly staged scenes of semi-domesticated animals set upon each other, e.g. tame cougar killing tame deer.  (These allegations have been made by collaborators on this series.)  In the middle there are many good scenes of possibly semi-domesticated animals in natural settings with good information about the natural world.  These don't seem gratuitous like the staged ""fights"".

With that in mind, just know what you are watching.  Staged scenes may not represent natural behavior at all.  (Will a Bobcat go after a Kit Fox?  I don't know, but I've been made to doubt the truth behind such scenes.)

In the end, this series was a bit of a ego-project for its maker.  Each episode starts and ends with ""I'm Marty Stouffer...""  He is front and center all the time.  Less Marty would have been preferable for the rest of us.  Nevertheless, I give credit for some nice footage of some spectacular nature.  Even if I can't trust it as representing true nature.",1402272000,,1068,4.893854748603352

I found it when I Googled it, hoping for just such a thing. This is a rock bottom basement bargain at 19.95 for seasons 1-6 compared to Marty Stouffer's price.

He does not seem to be bothered by some of the scenes where predators are eating and attacking their prey.  He finds it very fascinating, and has learned so much from these shows that he is very advanced in his grade in Science.  I have always tried to be as scientificly correct with my children (ages 6, 4 yrs and 4 months) when ythey ask questions, that they can understand.  And this program has brought on some questions I hadn't expecting so soon (mating for one), but they took the explainations well and understand the concepts of how nature works and differs from our lives as well.
I recommend this for everyone, but do know that some children may have a hard time dealing with the predator/prey scenes.",1298332800,3,831,4.405228758169935

I have a 32 inch Sony LCD flat screen with HD. The picture quality is NOT what I was expecting as the picture ratio for HD flat screens is totally different. This is NOT HD digital quality!!! So my rating is on the picture quality. One other item is that Marty does go on and on about evolution. I personally am not big on the whole evolution thing...species can and do evolve and adapt to their environment but I don't buy into animals completely changing... you are not convincing me that a manatee is a close cousin of the Elephant. One more item if you buy these, you get what you pay for. $39.00 is not bad for the 12 seasons but be real careful removing them from the containers! I cracked my first season DVD and I was trying to be careful in removing it. They are really tight. So glad I did not pay over $45 for this series.",1297641600,8,991,4.221052631578948

Cost me about $26 for the complete series and its worth every penny. Very informative, its great learning about the animals that live on my land in upstate NY. Amazing how they filmed the chase scenes, especially the Lynx chasing the snow rabbit.
If you love the outdoors and watching wildlife, this video collection is the best wildlife video you can ever buy.

I have both sets containing all 12 seasons of the original series and grew to treasure these purchases.

If you want to relax and take a trusted, enjoyable trip to the backwoods with an expert guide and family man, this is your ticket! You and your kids (or pets) will be hipnotized by the many species presetentd, all photographed in their natural habitats along with enough zoological detail to afford you an uderstanding of each animal's unique behaviors and charactoristics.",1262995200,13,749,4.976

2677064,5,B000JLSYXU,"Excellent wild life films for the entire family (family friendly). Marty Stouffer narrates each film in his unique way. Season 1 includes ""Watching Wildlife"", ""Swamp Critters"", ""Wild Dogs"", ""Mountain Monarchs"", ""Time of the Grizzly"", ""At the Crossroads"", ""Bighorn!"", ""The Wolf and the Whitetail"", ""Living with Wildlife"", and ""Wild Babies"". This is approximately 5 hours of viewing.
There are a total of 12 dvds in the set (two for each of the first 6 seasons), for a total of 30 hours of viewing all about North American Wildlife. Very interesting and educational. If you like these, I would also recommend the Seasons 7-12 Collectors Edition of Wild America.",1253664000,2,659,5.168224299065421

I recieved the order quickly, but the DVD's package was torn and absolutely not in ""like new"" condition. I was a little dissappointed because I paid a lot of money for something that appeared used/damaged. The DVD's worked fine, but the appearance was most ertainly not NEW.",1232755200,,387,4.705882352941177

2677068,5,B000JLSYXU,Marty Stouffer does an excellent job capturing wild animals in their natural habitat. He mixed educational facts about the animals with excellent footage. I recommend this set for all ages.,1203120000,5,189,5.333333333333333
2677069,3,B000JLSYXU,"Like the first set, this collection of ""Wild America"" contains twelve DVD's with about thirty hours of programs. The slim cases each hold two DVD's, but the discs will sometimes come loose inside the cases.  The outside box, made of thin cardboard, can easily be damaged and offers little protection to the cases inside.  There are no bonus features in this set, although it includes many episodes.  Some interviews with Marty Stouffer and the team which produced the programs would have been interesting.  But we have only a large collection of episodes in this set without any extras, which is somewhat of a disappointment since ""Wild America"" was one of the best wildlife documentaries ever made.

If you love the ""Wild America"" series I would recommend this set, but you might be a little disappointed in the quality of its packaging.  The DVD's are okay for sound and picture quality and the programs are complete. It is not an expensive set if you purchase it from one of Amazon's sellers. But it seems we could have been offered something better and more durable since it is supposedly a collector's set, which people will want to own for many years.",1200355200,11,1157,4.788944723618091
2677070,5,B000JLSYXU,"My neices and nephews loved the DVDs.

2677071,3,B000JLSYXU,"I gave this DVD set a three star rating because I thought the discs could have been placed in better, more durable cases, which would hold the DVD's securely in place.  The outside box, made of thin cardboard, doesn't offer much protection to the set.  The price of the item was low enough, but what the set came in was not of the best quality. The twelve DVD's, however, were in good condition and had a clear, bright picture.

The series itself deserves a five star rating, being one the best nature documentaries ever made.  And now you can own all of the complete episodes, which is much better than watching the edited version shown on television.  Marty Stouffer's wildlife photography is something to behold, and his lively, personal hosting and narration are the best invitation to enjoy American wildlife. Therefore I must highly recommend the series for anyone who loves the natural world.",1184198400,6,899,4.811688311688312

All of the little nubbins that hold the discs in place broke off during the shipment or within days of receiving it.  Since it was a gift, that kind of sucked.

Marty Stouffer is a great representative for the series, obviously passionate and dedicated.
Some may say he is not on par with the great narrators from BBC etc but I would disagree, he is excellent, an American icon.
Some of the specials were pretty corny, (not included in this package) but overall a great show.
This is one of the greatest nature series ever produced, your kids will love it and you may find the dated clothing entertaining as well.
