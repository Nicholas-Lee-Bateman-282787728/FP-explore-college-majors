8744825,1,B019D3J4X8,"Haliburton (Evan Tyler Stallone) and Geoffrey (Jeffrey Swisher) are the exorcist guys, except they cure cancer (plastic slag bubbles in flesh color) by removing the demon. Hal wears the red suit while Geoffrey is the pitch man who hands out red cards. They don't work cheap, but Geoffrey always manage to dress poorly. (Plot point or low budget?...low budget.) Ally (Kristin Ann Teporelli) is coughing up blood from terminal cancer...in come the Cancer Demon guys. They must perform this alone and not be disturb, a plot point that is quickly violated letting the cancer demon loose in a warehouse needing a host.

In the first two minutes you realize the acting and sound track are horrible with corny dialogue. The red suit and light bulbs must have by far been the most expensive props. At one time Star (Caitlyn Fletcher) breaks down and laugh as Ernie (Michael J. Panichelli Jr.) delivers his lines. They used a demon voice enhancer.

We had that funny ""50/50"" Cancer film. Then we had ""Love Story"" which tore at us for decades. ""Erin Brockovich"" was cancer for everybody. Of course there was ""The Fault in Our Stars"" which allowed teens to play the cancer card to have sex...like they need an excuse. Now we have a slasher cancer film with cancer running around with a pizza face. My advice is the next time you go drinking with your ex-JW buddy and he pitches you a film, don't actually take him up on it.

Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity. Has some camp value.",1462147200,,1467,4.678294573643411
