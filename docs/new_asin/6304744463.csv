1113595,1,6304744463,The title pretty much says it all there is not still a remastered version of ninja checkmate AKA The Mystery Of Chessboxing the cover has a better picture than the one in the Martial arts theater Tai Seng version and it is printed by the bootleg company of RED SUN or Bonzai what they call themselves these days it is overall one of the greatest martial arts movies ever though and recomend anyone to watch this film and maybe hope to one day be letterboxed and remastered also a good site to look for kung fu movies is [...],1256169600,6,525,4.313131313131313
1113596,5,6304744463,"I rushed out to get this flick based on the hype!! I was truly impressed with this one.  It was entertaining from the start to the finished,,great story line,,,and the many fight scenes,there are absolutely no boaring parts. If you walked away at anytime, more than likely you may have miss something sweet!!!!  I now have two new martial arts hero to my collection, Jack and Mark Long,,simply amazing!!!  I said it before, and will say it again,,,3 words for this flick ""TOUGH, TOUGH, TOUGH!!

This flick is easily up there among my top 5 best flicks ever, I would not be surprized if this movie is not even better than 7 Grandmasters,,which has always been my personaly favourite!!!

This is definately a must have,,no matter what the cost,,there will be no dissapoinments!!",1147305600,3,776,4.804511278195489
1113597,3,6304744463,"I bought this DVD based on the reviews. After watching it I have to agree that this movie is overrated. It's worth watching and the fight scenes are well choreographed but too much time was spent on comedy I was beginning to wonder when he was going to settle down to some serious teaching. I prefer ""Flying Guillotine II"" over this one anyday.",1050883200,2,344,4.476190476190476
1113598,3,6304744463,"Mystery of Chess boxing contains good fight scenes, well choreographed and well executed, but not much else. The acting, cinematography, costumes, sets, and story are all average and not very good. The movie contains a good amount of ""comedy"", which I do not really like in kungfu films. The hero, played by Lee Yi Min, is not good at acting, and his kungfu is nothing special. The Ghost Faced Killer however, is a good fighter, and the fight scenes with him are excellent. If you enjoy good fight scenes but do not enjoy good movies, I would recommend this movie to you.",1041638400,2,571,4.607843137254902
1113599,5,6304744463,"If your a fan of older kung fu movies buy this film, it's awesome. With Sam the Seed,Jack Long and Lee Yi Min you can't go wrong. The fights are great,creative and are really over the top. So if you liked Drunken Master or Snake In The Eagles shadow, ( also starring Sam the Seed )get it now.",1033084800,,292,4.051724137931035
1113600,5,6304744463,"This is the best movie I've ever seen.  The amazingly high levels of wonderfulness it contains will astound you.  The rice bowl scene is perhaps one of the best images ever captured on film, and there's a guy in it that looks like an asian version of Wierd Al.  Mystery of Chess Boxing is a tribute to the human race.  If you do not watch it, your life will most likely be bad.
  But beware the ghost faced killer.",1007078400,,414,4.177215189873418
1113601,5,6304744463,"The movie ""Mystery of Chess Boxing"" is one of the best works of motion picture I have experianced in my entire life.  The movie, simple yet poignant, delivers in a way every movie should.  The action sequences in this movie are the most amazing I have ever seen and show the true beauty of the art of Kung Fu.  The movie's plot really sucks you into the story and is by itself a reason to watch the movie.  To accompany the plot, the fighting scenes are just spectacular and will leave you shocked.  These men defy the rules of gravity and no one should go without seeing this film.  It's obvious this movie did not have much money poured in it however it is better than any big budget movie i've ever watched.  Chess Boxing RULES.",972000000,3,731,4.330882352941177

1113663,3,6304744463,"It's OK. Lots of fight scenes, no ""cable fu"", all bare hand except for one guy who used a staff. Actors freeze moves and countermoves, which may be good for showing the applications of postures in routines. Not as much fun for me as Jackie Chan's ""Drunken Boxing"" films.",1471824000,,270,4.530612244897959

1113719,4,6304744463,I have always liked this movie how ever there some points in which there was skipping around. any way that was the only thing that was wrong about it Though one person said it was missing the ending the ending was there in my dvd although it was a good dvd. I say to get this would be an added crown to any Martial arts collection.,1344988800,2,331,4.03030303030303
1113720,3,6304744463,"The Mystery of Chessboxing (also known as Ninja Checkmate) was a very fun movie. It is the type of movie that does not take it self seriously. Choreography in this movie was outstanding. The story was one of your generic revenge stories. I absolutely love how the ghost faced killer meets his victims. His quotes are awesome. Great flick, good movie.

The dvd that I purchased is terrible. It seems to be a vhs trasnfer from an Ocean Shore recording. Many scenes are missing, including; the end of the movie! Restored picture would be nice, but it was acceptable for me. The sound definitely could be remastered, but it was also acceptable for my tastes. In the dvd there were options such as: Play, Scenes, Trailers, Commentary, and English. The trailers worked and so did the scene selection, but the commentary and language options are non existent. The main problem that I have with this version is the missing scenes and the misleading menu options.

If you are a kung fu fiend, I recommend that you watch this movie. I have not checked to see if the Xenon studios Wu Tang Collection version or the Tai Seng Ninja Checkmate version is any better. If you know for a fact please send me a message so that can know. Hopefully down the road some company will choose to release a remastered, restored, enhanced dvd of The Mystery of Chessboxing.",1329350400,,1345,4.647058823529412

The movie's image quality is ok but there are visible scan lines when it was transferred from analog to digital, from interlaced to progressive scan.

At $5 it would be a good purchase, nothing more.",1522540800,,305,4.62962962962963
