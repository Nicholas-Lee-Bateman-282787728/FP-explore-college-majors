8142505,3,B000HXE5PG,"This was a nice addition to my growing collection of 70s Formula One DVD reviews.  It seemed to be fairly standard as far as coverage of each race, though a few seemed too brief (barely any time on the Nurburgring although we saw a neat angle from Breidsheid that was nice) and they skipped over Watkins entirely (the credits roll at the end of Monza, when Lauda had sealed the championship).  But I love 1975 because of those tall air boxes on all the cars, and occasionally you get some really good engine sounds.  It was also nice to see how much camaraderie there was between drivers, including Lauda and Hunt who seemed happy for each other's victories when sharing podiums (particularly when Hunt won his first race for Hesketh, with Lauda 2nd).

Like I said, a little too much brevity here, and by skipping or abbreviating coverage of two of my favorite tracks, I have to take the rating down to 3.5 stars.  But for F1 collectors who love the classic years, it's a no brainer whether to buy these old DVDs - especially now that they can be had for much more reasonable prices than just a few years ago.",1441238400,,1109,4.47029702970297

8142507,5,B000HXE5PG,"I love Formula One. Sadly today's version of it is a far cry from the truly great eras and drivers that graced the sport throughout the years. Through the cleanly painted rear engined racing cigars of the 1960s, through the wingy ""pack of cigarettes"" monsters of the 1970s, and through the super-fat 1,000 HP turbo beasts of the 1980s the sport always seemed to know no bounds as cars got faster and faster and things more out of control in terms of cost going forward into the future. That is why those who love this sport and its history do so. The sheer madness of it all coupled with the competition spanning the globe vying for the title of Driver's Championship as country against country fight to produce the greatest chassis, the greatest engine, and the greatest driver all culminating in the epic soap opera of testosterone and oil. Sadly we are not all in the same boat when it comes to fandom of F1 in this country and the scarcity of F1 titles available on DVD is a direct result. So, we must be happy with the few options thrown our way and that is why I give 5 stars to this series of short 50 minute films covering the F1 seasons from 1970-1980. The picture quality is great as is the rare ability to see these classic cars we cherish at different angles. Quite a treat for F1 nuts. I've rewatched each film several times and they NEVER get old.",1379030400,4,1361,4.404761904761905
8142508,3,B000HXE5PG,"A typical overview news report on the season, not all that complete.

I love Lauda so I bought it to complete my collection.",1369699200,3,124,4.391304347826087
8142509,4,B000HXE5PG,"I was happy to get this tape into my F1 video collections. Its has great video clippings from drivers of yester years. Its a nice to have video.

  I would like to see the video updated with drivers from 1993 onwards as I am a huge Schumi fan and I consider him right up there with all the others in the video.",1073433600,,310,3.967741935483871
