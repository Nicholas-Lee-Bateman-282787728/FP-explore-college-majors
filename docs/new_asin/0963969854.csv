And for the price of this video, which was...... when I bought it, it comes to just over a dollar a minute. 27 minutes is on Stand Watie, the rest is all commercials on other videos available from Tully Entertainment. 8 minutes on the Navajo Code Talkers, 5 minutes on War Dogs-Canines in War, and the last 4 minutes on Seawolves of Vietnam. A total of 17 minutes of commercials. I could see paying...... at Wal-Mart for the video but no more than that.",985737600,,561,4.564356435643564
7793724,5,0963969854,How many of us in school were ever told about Stand Watie? The video covers his life as a Cherokee leader until his final surrender to Union  forces. Anyone who has any interest in the Civil War or Indian affairs  should buy this video. It will open your eyes to history that we were never  taught. A truly moving experience.,966124800,10,325,4.383333333333334
