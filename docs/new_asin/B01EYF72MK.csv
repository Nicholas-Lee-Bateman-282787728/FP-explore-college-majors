7741409,5,B01EYF72MK,"Great Blu-ray presentation of a John Wayne classic with ""The Duke"" in a bit of an off-beat role, and rising to the occasion. This film has always been a favorite of mine, and I've never seen it look as great as it does on this new Blu-ray release. I've seen the film in ""HD"" before on television and streaming, where the film looked better than DVD, but film damage (and digital noise reduction) were highly evident in many places. As I read in several reviews, Warner gave the film a brand-new master for this Blu-ray release, and it excellence shows through as the image quality sparkles and handles the dark indoor scenes as well as the outdoor Seattle location photography with perfection. Great action, and able direction from John Sturges make ""McQ"" on Blu a must.",1466812800,4,770,4.669117647058823
7741410,5,B01EYF72MK,"After a spate of overnight cop-killings on the streets of 'Seattle' head-of-homicide' 'Kosterman' (Eddie Albert) orders a dragnet
believing the killings are the work of street militants .
'McQ' (John Wayne) who's close friend and colleague 'Boyle' was among the  victims he wants to lead the investigation believing
the reason behind the killings more likely to be drug-related.
However 'Kosterman' tells 'McQ' he's too close to one of the victims to become involved, after a threat to have 'McQ' desk-bound
during the investigation the veteran cop turns in his badge.
'McQ' is old-school and has his own way of doing things, under the cover of being a licensed private investigator he'll  dig out the
truth himself.
'McQ' is convinced a high-profile drug lord is behind the killings, however as he digs deeper the truth will be far less comfortable
for him.
'John Wayne' trades in his horse for a high-powered fast-car in this cop-thriller which has some good car-chase and fire-fight sequences
to enjoy along the way.
Though probably not the best cop-movie of the early 70's it is enjoyable, and an essential addition to ones collection if a fan of 'The Duke'
'John Wayne' of course is best remembered for his many Westerns he did of course star in many other films such as this.
Good Blu-ray upgrade
The Film is ''Multi-Region'

Featurette - 'McQ'  John Wayne in Action

8759775,5,B01EYF72MK,I'm not a John Wayne fan per say. But I do like this one and Brannigan. The two cop flicks are some of John Wayne's best. His Cowboy films and Army films were okay. McQ and Brannigan were a different twist for. Me.,1532390400,,214,4.0

8759779,4,B01EYF72MK,Everyone thinks this film sucks. A misguided attempt on Duke's part to make up for passing on Dirty Harry. I think it sits next to Hickey & Boggs as prime  early 70s noir. Watch it more than once to see the layers of this movie. Not saying it's a neglected classic but it has a quality.,1513036800,,286,4.107142857142857
8759780,4,B01EYF72MK,"Good direction and cinematography, and as-always solid acting from The Duke. I particularly enjoyed Duke's gun handling; he's so big he just looks more natural in the wide expanses of the Old West. His handling of modern weapons looks like he's playing with really dangerous toys, so that it's somehow ironically funny and extremely competent at the same time.",1502841600,,360,5.11864406779661
