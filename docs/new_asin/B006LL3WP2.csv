5002874,5,B006LL3WP2,I rated it a five because when I watch the movie it was phenomenal. I like it so much because it is funny it is adventurous and it has the right actors like Jonny Depp and Adam Slandler.,1328572800,2,186,3.9210526315789473
5002875,2,B006LL3WP2,"Adam Sandler plays dual roles in ""Jack and Jill,"" as twins Jack Sadelstein / Jill Sadelstein. Jack is a successful commercial producer living in LA, happily married to Erin (Katie Holmes). But now he is not a very happy man as his twin sister Jill (Sandler wearing a wig and women's clothes) is paying his family a visit for the Thanksgiving holiday. And Jill is very, very annoying.

In the meanwhile, Jack wants Al Pacino to be in the TV commercial for Dunkin' Donuts, but knows there is little chance that the Oscar winning star would accept the offer. But things start to seem better when, believe me or not, Al Pacino - playing a knowingly (I hope) exaggerated version of himself - fell for Jill.

It is not the film's non-existent story or countless stupid jokes that I find annoying. I like stupid jokes, but when they are done by someone like Jill, an irritating and obnoxious character, her antics are unfunny, even unpleasant. Yes, I know, as it turns out, Jill is really a woman with a kind heart, and Erin and kids like her, but Sandler's one-note performance doesn't just convince.

The only thing I find mildly amusing is Al Pacino playing himself, though it is obvious that comedy is not his forte. His energetic acting in the ""Dunkaccino"" part will either entertain you or make you sigh.

Directed by Dennis Dugan, ""Jack and Jill"" is yet another Adam Sandler-Dennis Dugan collaboration that started with ""Happy Gilmore"" back in 1996. There are lots of cameos - Johnny Depp and John McEnroe among others - but all those amusing cameos are not just enough to make us forget the fact that this is arguably the worst of their films.",1327622400,10,1644,4.639175257731959
5002876,4,B006LL3WP2,"To heck with the critics.  This is a sweet, hilarious movie that speaks to unconditional love. The audience (including myself) with whom I viewed this film laughed uproariously throughout.  The kid who played the adopted son was fantastic - he's a star in the making. Al Pacino was all-out hysterical. I didn't know how prominently he'd be featured in this movie and I was delighted.  There is nothing funnier than grown men being down and dirty silly.  Congratulations to Adam Sandler. I love his work and am so grateful to him - to anyone - who can make me laugh that hard. (And still be laughing several days later.) P.S. Doesn't everyone know a Jill? I may even be one.",1327190400,3,673,4.583333333333333
5002877,5,B006LL3WP2,We took our 9 year old boy/girl twins and we ALL loved it!  We haven't laughed that hard in a long time ~  Very much recommend this movie and can't wait to buy it !,1323907200,3,164,3.657142857142857
5002878,2,B006LL3WP2,"How can an Adam Sandler film be worse than usual ? Easily, in Jack and Jill, Sandler plays twins and dresses in drag to play the sister Jill. While Katie Holmes plays Jack's wife Erin who gets to be on the list of pretty actresses in one dimensional roles as Sandler's wife who are just there to act like he's a great husband and father when he always plays a jerk and bad example.
  Sandler must be the nicest guy in person though, because he got the great Jack Nicholson to work with him and now got not only Johnny Depp to make an appearance as himself but Al Pacino as well. Pacino probably only read the parts of the script with him in them and thought this is great stuff because his scenes are the only ones that work and that are funny. He plays himself and we're supposed to believe that he's obsessed with Jill. Jack loves that since he films commercials and wants Pacino in one and wants to be on his good side.
  Sandler shows some talent as Jill but the movie resorts to the same sort of jokes you can expect from a Happy Madison film and this one is PG for some reason but what jokes are aimed for kids ? None I can think of since there's  a lot of scenes where people either get punched in the face or hit with something and fart humor. David Spade in a cameo in drag might even give them more nightmares than Sandler in drag.",1322870400,7,1341,4.142307692307693
5002879,5,B006LL3WP2,Adqm Standler is wonderful. I love the fact that he would play a female. It's absurd and entertaining.  Any thing he does I will watch. The taste is in the palate. The world needs humor.,1321920000,6,186,4.314285714285714
5002880,4,B006LL3WP2,"I take pride in liking bad movies. One man's trash is another's treasure. With that being said, I actually liked this movie. I'll admit some scenes toward the beginning were painful to watch, but it gets better later in the movie. To me, Adam Sandler becomes believable as both Jack and Jill. The Jill character was the funniest because she's always moody and very masculine. During Thanksgiving, Jack is forced to bring his sister over for just a few days. She's drives him crazy, and stays up until New Year's. Jack is an advertising executive and needs Al Pacino for his business. Soon, Al becomes obsessed with Jill and tries to get with her. (There are many hilarious nods to Scarface and The Godfather trilogy) If Jill doesn't date Al, then he won't do business with Jack, but he soon realizes that family is forever. If you want mind-numbing comedy, then you'll enjoy JACK & JILL!!!",1321315200,3,889,4.705128205128205
5002881,1,B006LL3WP2,"Stay away from this movie.  The overall movie had 4-5 funny parts, the rest was just filler from some black book of unused comedy skits.",1321228800,11,136,4.44
5002882,1,B006LL3WP2,"Armpit stains! Falling into the pool! Body sweat! That's the kind of humor the latest movie asks the viewers to laugh at. I admit, some scenes are amusing, but mostly, it's the scenes where Al Pacino goes out of his way to make fun of himself.

About the only thing that this movie has going for it is Pacino's turn as himself. Pacino is a great sport for agreeing to do this movie. I guess he feels like he should since everyone else seems to be doing comedies - Robert DeNiro and Dustin Hoffman have certainly done well for themselves with comedies lately.

Sandler's latest flick isn't as bad as some of the terrible stuff he's released in the past several years, but only because his work has been abominable in the last decade.

the plot

Jack Sadelstein was born in the Bronx along with his twin sister Jill. As they grew up Jill was a constant hindrance to her brothers social life, although she honestly meant no harm. Jack moved out to California and started a successful advertising business while Jill stayed in the Bronx with their aging mother. Jack married a beautiful woman, had a child and adopted another. His business is doing very well, except he may lose Dunkin Donuts as a client as they are determined to get Al Pacino in their commercials pushing their new product the Dunkaccino. This will be a major challenge for Jack to nab such a huge movie star to peddle cappuccino products in a dinky commercial, but he doesnt want to lose his biggest client. Meanwhile, the Thanksgiving holiday is upon us and this means its time for his annual visit from his twin sister Jill who proves to be more than a handful with every visit.

Jack and his family have guests over for dinner including an invited homeless man to eat with them. Jill ends up embarrassing Jack and when he cant take it anymore he yells at her. When Jill runs into the woods to cry, this extends her stay until the end of Hanukah. One night they go and see The Lakers play and Jack notices that in the front row sitting next to Johnny Depp is Al Pacino. Jack takes this opportunity to reintroduce himself to Pacino, but the legendary actor is taken with his twin sister Jill. Even though Jill is desperate for a man, she doesnt like Al Pacino. He constantly makes plays for her, but she doesnt seem interested. Al tells Jack that if he can make this happen with Jill then he will do the Dunkin Donuts commercial. Can Jack pimp out Jill against her will just for a client?

the breakdown

Sandler films are often hit or miss. You Dont Mess With the Zohan is awful while Just Go With It was pretty funny. The problem is that the trailers for all of his films make it look like the upcoming movie (no matter which one it is) is going to suck. When I saw Sandler hideously dressed up as a woman and sitting on a colt breaking its legs, I immediately passed it off as another stupid Sandler movie. So it was to my surprise that I really liked it and laughed all the way through this comedy. I like comedy films that have to do with crazy families. Not the fake Brady Bunch types but stuff like Jack and Jill, where the ugliness of a certain relatives behavior or even yourself just comes through as truth. Adams portrayal of Jill is hysterical as he gives her these super-annoying idiosyncrasies that should ring true to most of us. Whether its someone who speaks too loud and doesnt seem to realize that they are talking that loud, they're inappropriately rude, inconsiderate of anothers feelings  when looked at through a comedic aspect, it comes across as very funny.

Having said that, I confess that Im aware that this film has gotten panned for the most part. I believe this comes from the fact that Sandler in drag is truly disgusting, not only in appearance, but the mannerisms, the extreme sweating while sleeping, the farting, the potato farm growing in her ears, the voice, the idea of Jill as a sexual being, these things can be overwhelmingly too horrific to take in. I had to remind myself constantly that Jill is really Adam Sandler and that she doesnt really have a vagina, this left me relatively at ease. Sandler was his usual crazy self, yet somehow convincing as a twin female. Perhaps it was the seamless movie magic constantly pairing the two (Jack and Jill) on screen together handing each other things, high-fiving each other, cuddling with each other, the special effects were fabulous.

It feels like Katie Holmes role was to simply look fantastically attractive, as she didn't really have too big of a role. The joke about her in the film was how she who wasn't Jewish had converted to Judaism for Jack which gives him a super hot Jewish wife who doesnt look Jewish. If you compare Katie Holmes with Adams Jill, then this rings true, but in real life I know really pretty Jewish women, so while the joke didn't fully make sense to me, I understood what he was trying to put across. Sandler once again surrounds himself with his usual supporting cast members, as well as some of his favorite people. He had a slew of SNL folks like Rob Schneider, David Spade, Tim Meadows, Norm Mac Donald and even Dana Carvey. The number of cameos here even outdoes the few he had on Funny People. Johnny Depp was the best out of all of these, giving us a brief but very funny scene. Al Pacino plays himself, albeit a much more eccentric version of himself. Pacino was hilarious in his self-mocking performance. While he makes fun of himself, its really the bigger joke of how a huge celebrity of his caliber is believed to supposedly behave. The scenes that are guaranteed to get a huge laugh out of me were the ones with Jills cockatoo; the bird would imitate her voice and repeat the things she says over and over, when I heard the birds voice I would just lose it.

Jack and Jill is on par with his best hits like Waterboy or Anger Management so you won't be disappointed; yet if even these movies mentioned above are also beneath your palate, then please go elsewhere.

5002995,1,B006LL3WP2,"I will start by saying that I have enjoyed many Adam Sandler movies and have found him to be a generally funny guy when I've seen him interviewed and when he was on Saturday Night Live.
I laughed gleefully through Anger Management, Mr. Deeds, Billy Madison, 50 First Dates, and Happy Gilmore. Funny People and Just Go With It were awesome movies! I was brought to tears in Sandler's emotional portrayal in Reign Over Me.
I have great respect for the man as a comedian and actor. But Jack and Jill is abysmal. The ""jokes"" are not only bizarrely misplaced - THEY ARE NOT FUNNY. I did not hear a single laugh, not even a slight giggle from any audience member in the theater. In fact, almost 1/3 of them walked out before it was over. Those who stayed, openly derided the flick as we all exited the theater in utter disgust and sadness.
I don't know why Al Pacino was in this movie, his acting made it seem like he was forced at gun point to do this movie. Nick Swardson and Tim Meadows are way too funny to be in such a disaster. Especially given Swardson's stellar performance in Just Go With It.
This movie is not a flop, its not an ""oops"", its not a mistake - it's a career ending pile of trash. A career ender that started with Sandler's god awful ""Grown Ups"" and climaxes with this revolting hunk of garbage.

5003104,1,B006LL3WP2,"Could ""Jack and Jill"" be Adam Sandler's worst movie ever? Yes (though I've never seen ""Little Nicky."")

Here Sandler plays both Jack, a successful advertising executive trying to convince Al Pacino to do a Dunkin' Donuts television commercial, and Jill, his uber-annoying twin sister who travels with her bird, which is the only character in the cast remotely as grating as Jill. What does this film tell us about family? Nothing. This is a blight on the film industry and is nothing but an hour and a half of cinematic fingernails on a chalkboard. I cannot imagine why Pacino agreed to be in this movie, but I suppose he counts as the highlight of the film. Sandler is decent as straight man Jack, but is unbearably annoying as Jill. I seriously had a tough time getting through this one, and I have seen ""Tiptoes.""

I can find nothing to recommend this movie. It has a big cast of people you know, but there's no saving this Titanic twaddle from itself.

5003141,1,B006LL3WP2,"This movie is by far the worst movie I have ever seen, it should be up there with Gary Johnson III: the story of Stanley Hudson as the worst movies of all time. If anything made this movie watchable was from my favorite character was Davelle Garcia. The most genuine scene in this movie was portrayed by Davelle Garcia when he was eating pizza all day, every day! I heard from a reliable source that he was even awarded with an Oscar for that 40 minute scene. It is a shame that he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes after the production of the movie was over Another reasonable character was from my old buddy Bill Cosby. The space launch when him and Octavius the Bear flew to Robot Pirate Island was so unpredictable and absolutely genius. This movie also had a couple of hidden Easter eggs in it too, like the time Davelle followed @SIR_LOUISIII on instagram from his real account @DAVELLE_GARCIA. Overall this film was terrible, just down right awful! To top it all off Lil Shawn kept claiming girls were staring at him while at the mall. My wife and five children all regurgitated on our new $5,000 carpet while their eyes bled from the pure stupidity from the movie. I am currently writing this review in the hospital from 4 broken ribs, kidney failure and Insomniak. Thanks Adam Sandler for ruining me and my family's life!",1419552000,,1331,4.55

 This latest Adam Sandler effort will satisfy his fans.  It does have some funny moments which we appreciate in a comedy but do not always get.  This is a well oiled production which runs smoothly down the familiar Sandler track.  Director Dennis Dugan has directed many successful films including five blockbuster comedies.  He has directed Adam Sandler several other times.  The script writer, Steve Koren has also penned Click, an offbeat look at a photographer and the highly successful Bruce Almighty.  The whole package is organized by Sandlers own Happy Madison Productions.  We get a tightly focused experience in packaging and providing the Adam Sandler movie viewing opportunity.  Oh, I guess we have done this before-many times before.
 The jokes are a little more frequent and better than usual.  This is a PG-13 film so we do not have any really filthy stuff (but thank goodness, we do get a very funny, extended flatulence sequence.  We would be lost without fart jokes for the middle school audience.)  We see Adam Sandler play his usual self and also his identical twin sister.  The sister gets the better lines.  She is a messed up, crazy, irritating piece of work, which gives Sandler a real chance to get his freak on.  Sandler fans will enjoy seeing him twice as much.
 Besides Sandler twice, the cast list is long and famous.  Sandler puts his old pals from Saturday Night Live in many of his films.  In this one we have small cameos by Dana Carvey, Tim Meadows and Norm Mac Donald.  Katie Holms plays his wife with a warm smile for everyone in all circumstances.  She is the stabilizer in the family and with the impatient Jack and the neurotic Jill needs to be.  Even Regis Philbin has a quick appearance as himself.  He is funny and charming as he was fifty years ago when I watched him on local TV in San Diego.
 The only notable acting credit must go to Al Pacino.  Pacino is the lion of the current generation of actors.  His movies are sometimes not worthy of his talents (like this one) but that does not negate his talent.  He plays himself, and part of the time he plays himself playing Richard III which must have been fun for him.  Happy Madison Productions are nothing if not fun.  They are good for a few laughs and a good feeling to take with you when the lights go on.  That is not a bad thing in this day and age.
 Jack and Jill gets an average three saw blades, which is above my usual grade for a Sandler film.  It runs for an hour and a half plus one minute.  It has taken in a substantial $46 million in two weeks.  This is a good accomplishment with Twilight sucking up all the ticket booth oxygen for the last few days.  It might not be enough.  The producers went nuts and spent $79 million to make this one and will have to work very hard to get their money back.  Sandler is worth $300 million.  Maybe he can afford to wait until the TV re-runs pay off somewhere down the financial road.",1417219200,,2948,4.461538461538462

The entire audience was spellbound and silent, except when we were laughing raucously! What a side-splitter! The only time I got distracted was when someone coughed loudly behind me, but I turned around at glared at the offender. That put a stop to that! *Nods, pleased with herself* The movie was wonderful, and I remember walking out of the theater and telling my husband that Sandler deserved an Oscar for that performance. To delve so deeply into two psyches is very impressive work, and I feel that Adam Sandler did a marvelous job. He was ROBBED at the Oscars in our opinion. Also, Mr. Pacino rarely mentions the movie in interviews, so I HAVE to wonder if there's something fishy going on. I'm not trying to start any rumors, but you can't argue with FACTS, right?

Al Pacino is fantastic, as always, and delivers a fair amount of laughs himself. The children in the movie are full of adorable one liners that will leave you smiling.

I didn't think I'd like the film, but since I really enjoyed him in 50 First Dates I thought I'd give it a look see.

It's a great family movie that's just plain silly.  The characters were well developed and the plot was outrageous.

You will see Al Pacino like you've never seen him before.  Who knew this dramatic dynamo had a funny side.  He was wonderful as Al Pacino having a nervous breakdown.  He was crazy and you believed him as his crazy self.

It's that bad. To be honest, I don't even what log term effects this movie could have to an infant that views it. Every copy of this movie deserves to locked up in a vault, and sunk to bottom of the ocean. To give you an idea. I attempted to watch this movie three times. The first time I had to turn it off after 10 minutes. The second time I lasted a little longer, but turned it off after 30 minutes. And the third time, lasted a good 50 minutes. I can't believe a movie of this caliber is this bad. It honestly amazes me. Adam Sandler may not be known for making cinema masterpieces, but I never expected him to make a film that completely insults the intellect of his audience.

On a side note. I'm actually amused at the price listed by amazon. They're practically giving it away. But whatever you do, don't take the bait! It will be the worst five bucks you've ever spent on a film. Don't even watch this film on TV. Don't come back to me saying ""You Were RIGHT!!""

What fun seeing HIM have fun - and it took me awhile to recognize David Spade, but he was right in there with the rest of them. Mr. Sandler tends to casts his friends in his movies, which works for me. The little kids were great and Katie Holmes was fine.

As a fan of serious/dramatic movies, the comedies she tapes often sit in my house for months (as this one did) before I watch them. Once I finally got around to watching this movie, however, I found it pretty entertaining - despite some of the childish jokes.  This view is in part due to Al Pacino's ""over the top"" performance in the movie (& I really enjoyed his all too brief ""Donuts"" commercial.)  I thought Adam Sandler was great too - especially in his versatility as Jack AND Jill - though I have admittedly not seen too many of Sandler's movies.  ""Jack's"" adopted Indian son was also good in his role, as was Jill's eventual ""Prince Charming"", & several other ""extras"".  Katie Holmes wasn't bad - but almost anyone could have filled her role.  The script intentionally (it seemed) cast her as nothing more than a ""place holder wife"".  Anyway, I will definitely watch the movie again - & may even buy a copy of my own.",1363392000,,998,4.480662983425415

Its as if Sandler said to himself how can I get paid extra for this movie.  The answer was naturally to play two parts and get a bigger check.  The film also seems to be a nod to all his buddies to get them a paycheck.  All the usual SNL / Happy Madison actors are present so you won't get let down there.

Sandler's acting is just miserable and I doubt you're average person will ever laugh during the movie.  For some reason beyond anyone's knowledge comedy writers keep insisting on fart and poop and throw up jokes.  Is anyone getting a chuckle from this outside of the grade school audience?

So for the love of all that is holy just don't watch this film.",1363132800,2,913,4.195402298850575

You take a minute's worth of scenes that might appeal to a broad audience out of a 90-120 minute film.  The film in question could be the most gawd awful dreck in the world but no matter how bad, a skilled preview maker can skim enough material to make the movie at least marginally intriguing.  Then you get they guy with the deep voice to present the premise in a voice over.  I've been lured to many a bad movie by previews and I can say with embarrassment I've never walked out on them because I love movies.  But the Jack and Jill previews were on par with watching someone's face get cut open with a chain saw in slow motion.  One minute of excruciating horror that made my eyes water and my stomache clench.  I can't imagine what seeing the whole movie would be like.

Anyone that bought this movie should sleep with a gun in their mouth. This dogshit movie on your shelf means you no longer can be trusted with money and you now have to barter for services.

What the hell was Al Pacino smoking when he agreed to be in here??? He must have been down to his last 500 billion,and needed some more cash.

I suppose if you were to grade it strictly on the ""trick"" of Sandler playing two separate roles within the same movie (male and female twins), it would not fare particularly well. But if you were to rate it only on that single aspect, you would be forgetting a critical element- it features Al Pacino! Imagine my surprise, when I realized that ""Jack and Jill"" features none other than this acting legend. And not in a cameo or some limited role- this guy has prominent screen time in the movie. And for any fan of Pacino with a good sense of humor, the results are hilarious. And don't forget- Pacino plays HIMSELF! This guys has serious juice, and it was so much fun to watch him let it go and have a good time, without the slightest attempt at being serious. His ability to perform well in a slapstick comedy speaks volumes about his acting chops!

Over the course of ""Jack and Jill"", we get to witness such comedic gems as Pacino suffering a breakdown while partaking in a Shakespearean play, smashing chairs over his romantic interest's back, and getting funky in musical commercials for Dunkin Donuts. Sound outrageous? It is. Perhaps the best part is when he channels the spirit of ""The Godfather"", and puts he who dares to talk back in his place. Hilarious for any fan of Pacino, and who can appreciate this legend cutting loose for a while.",1351382400,4,1423,4.536964980544747

I laughed a lot in this movie, and after discovering that it was pretty safe for kids, I let them watch it with me the next night. Big, big laughs from my kids!

I would classify most of the humor in this movie as ""Slapstick"" or ""Stupid""... And I love both styles - especially when used together

The movie isn't very deep, but it's non-stop laughs. There are a few draw-backs. For one, we all know 'Jill' is Sandler in drag, but the fact his jack character goes drag as Jill in the movie undercuts the believability of the thing. Secondly, a couple of the jokes are of bad taste, or inappropriate. I appreciate the fact that Sandler likes to stand up for freedom of speech or push boundaries or whatever, but bad taste is bad taste. Thirdly, the Mexican guy in it is a rip-off of the guy in Ben Stillers' 'Heartbreak Kid'.

If you can get past those few problems, it's pure fun. Al Pacino is great as an eccentric version of himself, and Jill is an hilarious character who can't stop doing something stupid or down right hilarious.

This movie is a giant, moving product spot promotion for a number of companies, mostly terrible ones with large advertising budgets. It also features walk-ons from a number of actors, and marketing shills, like Subway's ""Jarod"".

I will never buy a movie with Adam Sandler in unless its ratings are favorable. This movie, I will remember. ""Click"" was funny and heart-wrenching. ""Jack and Jill"" is moronic. I will, also, never go to Radio Shack again, or trade with any of the other companies that ""paid"" for ""advertising"" in ""Jack and Jill"". Most of them are, in fact, companies I never had any interest in buying products from, but this movie clinched it. Hollywood, to allow this kind of tripe on the screen, must have a very low regard for the intelligence of movie-goers. The marketing geniuses that thought advertising in a movie-billboard should be horse-whipped and deported to a planet that lacks an atmosphere.

With the exception of the short scenes of Adam Sandler's character work place and the short scene with David Spade, this movie was so contrived and forced.  I know it's a comedy, but Sandler has done some quality stuff in the past.  It seems like such a ""crap shoot"" with Sandler.  He will make a quality movie like ""Spanglish"" then turn around and do this piece of work.  Adam Sandler playing his sister was so bad, during the movie I really wanted Adam Sandler's character ""Jack"" to boot Jill out and never see her again.  It wasn't a happy ending when we continued to see her.  There was no sympathy that could be felt for this horrible character.  It would have been better if Jill had been Jack's twin brother, Jim, and was dressing up as a woman and he had difficulty accepting his brother/sister and it would have been more believable.  I digress.  As your mother would say to you about an annoying cousin/brother/sister/etc. ""Don't laugh (or give money to this movie), it only encourages them.""",1336348800,5,1092,4.5487179487179485

Unlike movies that really shouldn't exist like Date Movie, Meet the Spartans, Dance Flick, Epic Movie, Disaster Movie, and Monty Python and the Holy Grail (all of which I feel made me dumber for having watched) Jack and Jill has a plot and puts humor to a situation that many people could relate to.",1335744000,,602,4.336283185840708

I love stupid comedies, so I usually dig Adam Sandler movies (Happy Gilmore, you are my hero when I need to zone out), but this one bit the big bull bottom!

The trailer has all the best parts in it.  Looked like it would have been funny, but it seemed forced from all angles, even Pacino's role. (Really Pacino?  You may have well done a commercial, I would have respected you more, but this??????)  and Katie Holmes? WOW.. you chose this project for taking a little time off from the fam? Running another marathon would have earned 100% more praise dear and no jeers.

The one role I liked, was Johnny Depp (ahhhh....bummer, lasted less than a minute? but hard to screw up a minute of face time).  How Sandler got all these A list stars to be in this movie is beyond me?  I love Adam Sandler, and just wanted a few laughs, but this whole movie seemed to try to hard and totally unbelievable.  (The Sandler acting like twin sister concept was ok, it was everything else that was really out there if you can believe that.  Her character dragged on and on in some spots making me say ""JUST GET ON WITH IT!"")

Purchased this for rental on Amazon Prime, feel like I wasted my $3.99 because the kids wanted to see it and I like Adam.

The kids (ages 12 & 15) even BOTH fell asleep and didn't want to watch it!  This is coming from the kids who watch either Mr. Deeds, Happy Gilmore and the Water Boy OVER and OVER and OVER when they are bored on streaming video occasionally for a silly laugh.  Wow!  Even THAT right there speaks volumes at how this just does NOT hold attention.

Al Pacino ends up having the hots for Jill and I don't want to give away the whole movie, but Jack, Adam Sandler, ends up learning that he does love his sister and that he should be kinder to her, Jill falls in love.

5003401,5,B006LL3WP2,"When I saw the preview for this movie, I immediately thought ""this looks like the dumbest movie ever, even for an Adam Sandler movie. Who wants to see Sandler channel his 'inner-Tootsie' for cheap laughs."" The movie proved my right, tanking at the box office and then earning several Razzie awards as the worst movie of 2011. JACK AND JILL, where Sandler plays an ad exec Jack Sadelstien, and Jack's twin sister Jill is exactly the type of movie Sandler made fun of in Judd Apatow's FUNNY PEOPLE.

One day, I realized there could be worse movies that I could watch. Sure, I knew it would be stupid, but I also knew that Sandler has delivered the laughs consistently through the years. So my family and I watched it. We laughed out loud many times, especially my fourth grader at the innocent fart jokes.

So, I can honestly agree this movie deserves the one star reviews and the Razzie, but it also deserves respect for being a movie the entire family can watch. It has a good message, no sex, violence or bad language, and plenty of cameos. I enjoyed looking out for the Sandler buddies like Allen Covert, Tim Meadows, Norm McDonald, David Spade, Dana Carvey, and Peter Dante. There are also many celebs that play themselves and add to the enjoyment of the movie. There are several slow parts, especially when Jill and Al Pacino share screen time, but the movie moves briskly enough.

Look, this is far cry from Happy Gilmore or Billy Madison, but this is a safe family movie that made us all laugh, and sometimes that's all you should really judge a movie by.",1334361600,2,1561,4.567857142857143

5003409,3,B006LL3WP2,"The bottom line of this movie is that Jill is over the top annoying, but there are laughs and hilarity in this movie. But Mrs. Doubtfire this is not.

So after Adam Sandler won the most Razzies (bad movie Oscars) in history, I thought I'd give this movie a try. Adam Sandler plays what seems to be every role he plays and that's a mildly angry family man that works at a marketing company with big clients like Dunkin Doughnuts. Adam Sandler has a twin sister played by Adam Sandler himself. She's a big oafish woman with a very annoying voice that works on your nerves. Her job is to be the most annoying person as possible. Personally, if they put someone less annoying who wasn't Adam Sandler, fans would have enjoyed it more.

The cast is full of quirky characters like Jack's adopted son from India that tapes things to himself including bread and birds. Jack's gardener with a family named Juan. Jack's karate daughter and bum cousin. Katie Holmes plays the normal person in this movie. Then there is Al Pachino who plays Al Pachino and quickly falls in love with Jill and Jack needs Al to be in the new Dunkin Doughnuts commercial. Al will only agree to it if he gets Jill. That results in Jack having to put up with his sister staying with him and even Jack pretending to be Jill at some point.

If you like cameos, this movie is full of them. David Spade, Tim Meadows, Norm McDonnald plays Jill's blind date and even Jared from Subway. There are just as many product placements in the movie as well. From Pepto Bismal to United Airlines. It makes me wonder if I wasn't saying 'hey its that guy,' would I have enjoyed it less?

To be honest this movie does have laughs and moments of hilarity, yet because of Jill being such an over the top annoyance and being played by Adam Sandler, this movie will go down as one of the worst movies of all time. This won't warm your heart and it is full of quirky or gimmicky character with no real substance.",1333843200,,1954,4.389502762430939

If you watch this movie, you are looking for silliness and laughs and what's wrong with that?  My family and I enjoyed this film and loved seeing ""serious"" actors poke fun at themselves.  I loved when Johnny Depp said he had been a member of Duran Duran while wearing a Justin Beiber t-shirt.  Sometimes you wonder if serious actors can appreciate Sandler's silliness.
No, Jack and Jill is not oscar material, but it does have classic moments of humor and we enjoyed it.  And I'm glad Al Pacino didn't feel that he would besmirch his career by being in such an ""awful"" movie.",1333238400,,882,4.509433962264151

The gist is that Jack is an overachiever who does not enjoy his his twin sister, Jill's, offbeat approach to life. In general Jack appears to be a nice guy, who is shallow and motivated by surface perceptions and goals. Jill seems deeper, but somehow disturbed (I am not a psychologist) Asperger syndrome? Anyway she lacks the ability to see when she is saying or doing something inappropriate. My beef or discontent with the movie, is the that Jack choose to mock and humiliate Jill rather than be understanding or try to work with here, in a meaningful way. Again, this is my personal bent and it is more at the movie makers who have created this genera; that believe making fun of or humiliating is cool and funny.

There is a shining star in the movie, Al Pacino!!! I have always liked Al's work, but he is beyond hysterical in this movie and I love ever scene he was in. Is he insane and out of touch; absolutely, but in a funny and quirky way that seems harmless.

Conclusion, if you want to see Al Pacino being awesome and hysterical, this is a must see. The rest of the movie is just sad.

We'd just watched ""The Thing,"" and she decided to go for comedy next.  I am not exaggerating when I say that it was literally painful to watch this movie.  It gave me a headache.  The beyond stupid jokes, the utter lack of likable characters (seriously - they're all just completely horrible). I was explaining it to a coworker, and trying to express what an idiotic concept, and even dumber execution it was ""Adam Sandler plays fraternal twins Jack and Jill.  Jill is Adam Sandler dressed like a very unconvincing, unladylike woman, who Al Pacino is inexplicably obsessed with.  At one point, Jack makes Jill angry, so then Adam Sandler's male character is actually playing his female character, and there is no change, other than some pithy remarks from Al Pacino about him being less masculine."" - it's convoluted and really, it's just plain stupid.

We turned it off after the Adam Sandler plays a man who is dressing up as his identical twin sister who is also played by Adam Sandler on a date with Al Pacino.

I am an Adam Sandler fan. I enjoy his comedy and can always find a laugh in what he does.
Not this time folks. I have no idea what happened to him. JACK AND JILL was absolutely the
worst movie I've seen in my 64 years. I can not believe that Mr. Sandler had the guts to actually
put this out for the public to view.

Adam plays Jack and his twin Sister. He should have found a female to be his sister. It might have
made this flop a slightly bit less terrible. I found nothing funny with his portrayal of a female / sister.
Sandler just doesn't do women well or funny.

We all know that Adam Sandler can be very funny and very believable. I would like him to go back
to doing those things. I sure wasted my money this time. I bought this video based on his name.
What a mistake that was.

I've only watched a few Sandler movies, but this is one I intend to share with anyone who is in need of total silliness. Anyone in need of a good laugh.

Physical comedy is supposed to be absurd - think Lucy, Sid Ceasar, even Sandra Bullock in Miss Congeniality - and this movie falls right into that category in my opinion.

The star cameos were in themselves hilarious - Shaq's cameo, while strangely disturbing was hilarious! And bravo to Mr. Pacino, who showed he is not ""too lofty"" for such a goofball spoof of himself. I thought he was great!

  There are a few good laughs, I'll grant you that, but Adam Sandler's female role as his character Jack's sister Jill was completely over the top in every sense of the expression.  True, you can expect gross jokes from Sandler about body (mal)functions, but the idea of a woman being so disgusting as to leave an imprint in her bed (and the bird) made me want to vomit.  The funniest part of the movie was when Jack's adopted son pointed out to him that he and Jill were so much alike, he denied it, and then they did practically mirror image movements while watching a movie.  Unfortunately, we've seen this before in old I Love Lucy and Abbot and Costello reruns.  In fact, we've seen everything here except the disappointing surprise of Al Pacino stooping to playing a rather large role in this fiasco.

This one may not of been the best, but it's definitely not near as bad as people are making it out to be! Give it a try :)",1331337600,,563,4.174311926605505

At first I thought the movie might be interesting because it opened up like a documentary where they had interviews with multiple different twins (not sure if they're really twins or a lame camera trick). I was hopeful that the movie would be funny yet mentally mature enough to give an educational viewpoint of the relationship of twins.

WRONG! It's an ADAM SANDLER movie and one of his worse ones yet. As a viewer I was highly disappointed and actually stopped watching 25 minutes in because of all the horribly lame jokes. If I were a twin, I'd be offended by such a horrific portrayal of it.

I watched this because of curiosity to see Al Pacino's role, and I was horribly surprised to see an actor of such a great caliber to go so low and take part in this awful project.  I guess Pacino owed Sandler some kind of favor in order to accept and participate in such a piece of trash movie.  Bad bad bad.  The part that hurts the most is seeing Mexican great Eugenio Derbez negatively represent his own people here.  Derbez is one of the top rated comedy geniuses in Mexico; he does both acting and producing his own shows and successfully produces other high quality comedy shows as well.  Derbez has an endless portfolio of high quality TV shows, and movies under his belt.  But well, his star didn't shine this time.  Is hard to believe how being so big and suceessful he went even lower than Pacino and chose this project as a crossover for the English speaking audiences.  He not only made a fool of himself in playing such a low third-rate role, but he added fuel to the fire as well by representing his own people in such a negative and unreal way.  Derbez probably doesn't know that George Lopez' already beat the horse to death by using the embarrasing task of discriminating against your own race.  Derbez will probably regret being part of this project for the rest of his life becuase as the saying goes, it's better to be a Mouse's Head (in your own turf), than a Lion's Tail.",1331251200,8,1468,4.436567164179104

Adam Sandler's portrayal of Jill was frightening, creepy, and awful at the same time.  It was so ridiculously over the top, that it failed to make any sort of positive impression whatsoever from a comedic standpoint.  It was like a 90 minute SNL skit gone awry.

I'm trying to take something positive away from this film, and I just can't.  Al Pacino wasn't terrible.  That's about the best thing to come out of it!  Katie Holmes and Adam Sandler's character had zero chemistry, and they were supposed to be husband and wife.  Awful casting there.

I still give Little Nicky the nod as Sandler's worst film, but this one is RIGHT up there.  Sorry for the poor descriptive detail.  I'm still in disbelief from what I just watched!

The most recent condemnation came when the Adam Sandler vehicle racked up a whopping 12 Razzie nominations, a feat made even more impressive by the fact that there are only 10 categories. Directed by Dennis Dugan, who has inexplicably cobbled together a career out of several terrible films, Jack and Jill is a screwball comedy about an advertising exec who receives an annual visit from his twin sister, who happens to drive him crazy. Despite an amusing extended cameo by Al Pacino -- playing himself -- Jack and Jill failed to impress me.

The movie is also openly racist in addition to thinking it is funny to knock over old people?  Where is the joke and why is that funny? What does that say about the American psyche that thinks that?

This one is almost as bad as what you have heard about it. There are a few parts that made me laugh, but when the best part is a little kid taping animals to his back that shows you what kind of movie this is. On a side note Al Pacino is my favorite actor of all time, but the last scene with him made me cringe...watch it and you will see what I mean. The only reason I kept watching was because of Pacino, but that scene almost made me regret it. Overall, a movie I can't really recommend...""Just Go With It"" was much, much better. I give it a C-.

I thought nobody would want to see this film, but working at a movie theater, I saw this film get quite a lot of business. People flocked to it, and there were a lot of other decent movies out the time to compete with it. I brought my oldest daughter to watch it ourselves. It was ridiculous, but we both liked it. My daughter actually loved it. This kind of ridiculous humor fits the audience of pre-teens that might be drawn to it. No, this isn't Sandler's best work (though typical to his traditional style), but if you put your criticism aside and allow yourself to just be entertained, it does do the job. I think that's why it made far more money than anyone expected. I don't think anybody saw an advertisement of this film and thought that this was going to be a masterpiece.

With that being said I am not going to make any execuses that this is most likely the low point of Adam's movie Career (At least in which he starred in, For just producing a movie that goes to Bucky Larson) but in the end what actually saves this movie is Adam Sandler's on screen comic insanity that will still get you a laugh even if the material that is based off of should have never seen the light of Day.

Anyways, the plot of this gem (yes there is a plot, even if it a very vague one) is about a self made obnoxious advertising executive named Jack (Adam Sandler) who always dreads the holidays due to his even more obnoxious twin sister Jill (Played also by Adam Sandler) making her yearly visit from New York (It could be New Jersey, all I know it's somewhere on the east coast) who decides to extend her vist from Thanks giving, through Hanukah , and even further until after New Year. While Jack is trying to conteplate how to deal with getting Jill to leave his home before she destroys Jack's family life he most also find away to get his biggest client (Dunkin Donughts) from not going to another advertising firm by trying to hire Al Pacino (Yes, the Godfather Al Pacino)to do a comercial for them. The real kicker (Hold your stomach for this one) is that Al Pacino (Who is playing Al Pacino)has fallen head over heels for Jack's sister Jill.

This also has Cameo's by Johnny Depp (Playing Johnny Depp), Regis Phelbinn (Playing Regis Phelbinn), and of course the rest of Adam Sandler's dead beat entourage  (David Spade, Nick Swardson, and so on) who have various small parts of the movie in order to recieve thier meal tickets.

While the movie clearly try's to get you to hold endearmeant to what is meant to be a brother and sister reconciling there past differences you only get the guilty pleasure of seeing Adam Sandler viciously toturing himself/herself and at the end you clearly are laughing at parts that you were not meant to.

So in conclusion is only buy this movie if you are a true fan of Adam Sandler and enjoy guilty pleasures like I do, enjoy at your own risk!",1330473600,,2262,4.414868105515588

Jill's neediness and passive-aggressiveness is maddening to Jack, turning his normally tranquil life upside down.

I remember my first movie featuring Adam Sandler was Billy Madison. That is a classic in the world of comedy, but recently Sandler has taken a turn for the morbid, masochist side of humanity or comedy whichever some of his mess of his films are now. He seems to take pleasure in exploiting people that are weak or dimwitted and make them do stupid things. I get the whole drag thing,, He had to do one movie where he was in drag eventually, but the whole movie is just one dark, sad, and just plain unfunny movie mainly because of Sandler's absolutely no skill in writing now. I mean he used to have decent comedic chops, but now it just seems he takes a film role just for the money.

Like I said, his previous films he just has characters that are so pathetic that the other characters need to exploit them for the comedic value. I mean, I understand now why he had to play both parts himself, because maybe, just maybe any actress that picked up the script and read it found it to be damaging and just plain sad because Jill is just this scapegoat for all the lack of humor. Every line, every situation is to poke fun at her, it seems there is no letting up on her. I mean there are practically no other jokes except about her/him/her or whatever. I just found myself sitting there, going ""why did I watch this when I could've watched something better or done something more productive?"" It's not even a fun movie, yet there is numerous groan inducing slapstick moments that almost just made me turn the movie off. I mean anyone remember the movie Funny People? Well all those fake movies Aptow that he made up for Sandler are coming true.  I mean that's just it, Sandler is not doing drama anymore, he's just doing these terrible headache inducing comedies that most people in this country or in the world expect him to do.  I liked him in his dramatic roles, but yet he doesn't do them anymore because he has no credibility as a actor. He is just a one-note mess in every movie now. It's not Sandler playing a character. It's a character playing Sandler.  Hey, he has all the money, a hot girl, and gets to work with some big stars so that must get him credibility because in Hollywood, Money = Power.

If you enjoy the past tense Adam, then don't watch this, but if you do enjoy this kind of movie, just go see it. I mean it's no harm to you.",1329782400,6,2704,4.463562753036437
5003492,2,B006LL3WP2,"The failings of the movie Jack and Jill are already well documented here.  As with most recent Sandler product, bathroom humor is the main plot device; the vast majority of this comedy centers on Sandler in drag having constant issues with gas, diarrhea, and profuse sweating.  But I must admit I laughed a few times at this (even if I immediately felt guilty about it).

But the scenes with Al Pacino drag this movie into two-star territory.  And not because Pacino is a bad actor, but that he is a great actor and it literally made me cringe when he had to portray having a meltdown on stage, slobbering over Sandler in drag, or lovingly burying his face in Sandler's sweat-soaked mattress.  When a scene that is expected to make you laugh makes you squirm in your seat instead, that's not a good sign.  And Jack and Jill made me squirm far too much to call it anything other than a failure.

Mr. Pacino - what the hell were you thinking?
