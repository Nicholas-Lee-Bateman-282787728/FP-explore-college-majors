7837228,5,6303101917,"The title of the tape is Golf with Al Geiberger.  Unfortunately, this tape is exactly the same as the Cybervision video featuringl Al Geiberger.  I had thought the Golf with Al Geiberger video would be instructional and somehow related to Geiberger's book Tempo.  There is noting wrong with the video, and I like the Cybervision video very much.  I was disappointed the video wasn't labelled more accurately so I that wouldn't have purchased a video I already owned.",1249084800,,466,4.935897435897436

7837230,5,6303101917,"Not a ""do this, then that"" instruction, but,
you'll swing better, and enjoy the game more.  This
is about the love of golf.
Buy it, enjoy it, you CAN'T go wrong.",1024012800,,161,4.193548387096774
7837231,5,6303101917,"After seeking a solution to my ball striking woes in tape after tape,I became so MECHANICAL from all the instruction,my swing became a total mess. Enter Al Geiberger's video. No positions to study. No endless verbage. I relaxed in my recliner and simply watched a beautifully flowing swing...OVER and OVER and.... After 4 consecutive viewings and no range work, I played 9 at my usual course and hit 6 of 7 fairways,6 of 9 greens,and shot 41 ! This tape isn't the greatest in terms of visual quality,BUT IT WORKS !I'm buying several to give at Christmas time. Buy it.",973987200,3,567,4.68
7837232,2,6303101917,"This video is obviously a reprint of the original SyberVision video.  While the content is helpful in viewing the smooth swing of Al Geiberger, the quality of the video is very poor.  It is very washed out and is not  crisp.  I was extremely disappointed with this quality, especially after  comparing this tape against the original version.",949104000,3,341,4.912280701754386
