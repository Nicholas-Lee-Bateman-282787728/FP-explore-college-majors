7112098,4,B00VUK4YN8,"The story does a good job of showing what anxiety and depression can do to people.  Not only the person suffering but the friends and family around them.  It was great to see Cory Monteith in another role (besides Finn Hudson on Glee), he would have been a great actor.",1448409600,,269,4.36

8711321,5,B00VUK4YN8,"I truly enjoyed this show... a good old fashioned movie where you feel as though you build a relationship with the characters.  It was nice to see Cory Monteith in something other than Glee.  Karine Vanasse did a great job portraying a woman with post traumatic stress disorder.  I did feel that the story line behind the post traumatic stress disorder could have better explained the history behind it.  She was unable to make physical contact with anyone, but that seemed distant from witnessing her sisters death without knowing more about the death.  Cory played a great businessman disengaged from his wife.  Kevin Zegers was a great addition with his own issues and understanding of Karine's.  Movies with Canadian actors seem to have something that US actors no longer have and I greatly enjoyed this show.",1469923200,,813,4.9338235294117645

8711327,3,B00VUK4YN8,"its just a so so movie. very predictable given the characters and their current marital status. if you don't mind sitting through a predictable situation and waiting for it to develop, then its an ok way to spend an hour and a half. but, personally, i wouldnt want to do it again. there are better movies to spend your time on. I did think the lead female actress did a good job, but thats about all",1449619200,,399,4.2631578947368425
8711328,4,B00VUK4YN8,"It's a quiet and different movie, but that's the kind I like. Interesting to see Cory in a different role like that. I'm becoming a big fan of Kevin Zegers too.",1449014400,,160,4.193548387096774
