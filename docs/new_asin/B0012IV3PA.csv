3089782,5,B0012IV3PA,"O.K., so they don't set the world on fire with every show, but the preparations and work the kids go through is a recommendation in itself. The professionalism of the group was surprisingly good. Some of the shows weren't as good as the others, but none was boring. I missed a couple and can't wait to see all of them on the DVD set. I'm betting the bonus features will be interesting, too.",1209340800,2,390,4.3561643835616435
3089783,5,B0012IV3PA,"I am a pure beliver in the paranormal because I personally have seen ghosts in my lifetime that is what makes me curious watching these ghost hunting shows.  For me it all started with the U.K's Most Haunted, it was a very entertaining show until they started with their fake table movings, knocks and personal attacks. Then there is Ghost Hunters. Ghost Hunters usually have alot of nothing going on, but still is interesting when they do catch something. Now there is Paranormal State. Why is Paranormal State so great. First of all not much happens here which leads me to believe that nothing is staged or fake on the show. The Best part of the show are the psychics who come in for a visit. Chip Coffey is overdramtic and funny when he demands, We Need An Exorcism. I get really excited when psychic Lorraine Warren pops on in an episode here and there.  I loved when Chip was in a trance and Lorainne smacked him in the face to wake him up. Funny Stuff Here. But the main characters are the people themselves. Half of them are crazy and looney and our host Ryan usually feels sorry for them by the end of every episode. There are plenty of scares and interesting findings in the show. I just hope they keep it real and put Chip and Lorainne on every episode. Better than Most Haunted and Ghost Hunters.",1207526400,20,1307,4.441666666666666
3089784,1,B0012IV3PA,"Produced and over-acted purely for ratings, Paranormal State is one of the many reasons the field of paranormal studies will never get the credibility it deserves. Funny how much 'ground breaking' evidence just happens to show up when the cameras are running. They should admid to the public that this is an obvious sham and let the real investigators do their job. Most Haunted opened the door for theatrics and fakery and Paranormal State blatently walked through. Jerry Springer would be proud as his audience now has even more bad acting and low budget directing to follow. Buy this and spit in the face of all that's scientific and genuine in the field of paranormal research. It's a shame that they set the field back 100 years for a paycheck. A&E should be embarassed!
AWFUL! AWFUL! AWFUL!",1207008000,19,796,4.817518248175182
3089785,5,B0012IV3PA,"I have been very impressed with Paranormal State for many reasons.  They do more than go into a situation and find evidence of spirits, a haunting, etc., they then try to solve the problem.  They don't just say - ""yeah, you've got a ghost, bye now."" They help the family understand what is happening and why, they help the spirit move on (or not, if the family decides letting it remain is the right thing to do).  It is all handled with sincerity and professionalism and great decorum.  When they do ""dead time"" and ask questions (hoping to get answers on the EVP recorder), they don't bombard the entity with questions, they ask a question, then give it an opportunity to respond.  They don't joke around when on site.  They don't yak to each other.  They focus totally on what they are doing.  They are so polite and caring.  Chip Coffey, the medium they bring in on some of the cases, is wonderful.  He is very talented and I like him a lot.  Although I do enjoy Ghost Hunters, too, the two series are as different as night and day.  I look forward to Paranormal State II coming out on DVD as well when the new season ends.",1205452800,23,1127,4.365384615384615
3089786,5,B0012IV3PA,"I won't bother recapping what this series is about as Amazon's description does a pretty good job laying out the basics, but I will say that the ""dating"" aspect of the description is very minute if not non-existant.

Now then, the difference between this show and Sci-Fi's Ghost Hunters is that they actually have access to and use the professional resources of two of the most famous paranormal investigators.  One is Chip Coffey.  He is a ""medium"" who can supposedly communicate telepathically with the dead.  And Lorraine something or other who was the lead investigator of the original Amittyville Horror case decades ago.  They also use what they call ""Dead Time"" which is 3:00am which has been said to be the most active time in the spirit world.  How spirits know what time it is in the real world in any given time zone, who knows?  But it is a fascinating idea and usually produces results.  Something I wish Jason and Grant would use in T.A.P.S.  They also use a variety of religious ceremonies/rituals to rid premises of the unwanted or trapped spirits, which in of itself goes one step further than T.A.P.S. does.

In one of the most recent episodes, they've used a new device called ""Frank's Box"" which apparently combines white noise, pink noise and several other spectrums of sound waves and outputs them through its speaker.  It is essentially a ""telephone to the dead"".  Because you can get instant EVP feedback and actually get direct real-time answers to questions.  The session in which it was used, it got clear feedback that ""there is 7 [spirits]"", one was named ""Lucy"", and that there was ""a demon"" present.  Very spooky stuff.

Now then, the episodes are of the 30 minute variety.  Yeah, I know, I wished they were an hour long, but they're very entertaining and unlike Ghosthunters, you actually get to see and hear ""actual"" paranormal activity.  The episodes have aired on A&E in full HD widescreen so the DVDs should be very excellent in terms of video quality.  Which is good because one of the female investigators looks like a cute earlier version of Avril Lavign (sp?), masquera and all. LOL!

Anyway, I've been DVRing these episodes and I'll probably buy this set just so I can clear off my DVR.",1205020800,11,2227,4.752604166666667

3089805,5,B0012IV3PA,"I've been a big fan since the first Season aired on TV back in 2007. Then a few years later I was able to watch and view all season on Netflix in 2010 but I never had a chance to watch Season 5 until now in 2015 on Amazon stream.  I'm a big fan and really like the documentary show with the characters (original Pen State team) and all their interesting paranormal cases, but now that I finally had the chance to watched all of Season 5, I was extremely disappointed in (Episode 21 ""If I Should Die"") with the New Class/ new Pen State team. None of them look like or sounded like they had any kind of paranormal experience, or they didn't even provided any kind of entertaining value.  Thank god A&E did not produce another season with the New Pen State team.  Please bring back the original team, please add a new season starting in 2015 or 2016.

3089848,1,B0012IV3PA,"When you read this review, take into account I only watched one episode of it.  I admit that it isn't a great way to judge a series, because many good series had a less impressive start.  I watched one of the later episodes in Season 1 about a condo that had been converted from an old school house.

This show may represent what ghost hunting is probably really like.  They went to this place.  There had been no history of violent or premature deaths.  They had one EVP supposedly and a motion sensor go off--but they couldn't tell what had set it off.  It was very scientifically done.  None of this ""I'm so scared!"" stuff you see that can be silly but at least entertaining.  In the end, they didn't find much, and they just did a house blessing.

Now, I do believe in ghosts.  I also know that real life ghosts are never as interesting as the movies make them out to be.  This show probably does show the true reality of ghost hunting--from what the episode I watched.  On that merit, it may be a good documentary.  However, if you want entertainment, it makes for really boring TV.",1412899200,,1087,4.37

3089852,3,B0012IV3PA,"I love this show. It's the only show of its kind I've found that is of quality and substance. The people involved seem to genuinely care and know what they're doing. I particularly like Ryan which is why I'm so sad to know that he is facing terminal illness. God bless this man! Also, I feel having Lorraine Warren on the show adds a fair amount of credibility to their work. The big, and only, problem I have is that it doesn't have nearly enough of the actual footage of their explorations conducted during the cases. Even if, God forbid, Ryan was to pass, I would still watch the show if they would show more of what happens as they search, run tests, and attempts to communicate with the spirits, etc. All of it is definitely interesting, but without more of this content being shown to the viewer it feels as though the middle of the story is completely cut out. Who wants the beginning and the end without the middle? I don't.",1399161600,,932,4.393063583815029

3089854,1,B0012IV3PA,"I'm not sure what bothered me more about this show, the frankly exploitative treatment of its clients, some of whom are obviously people in great emotional turmoil, or its patently right-wing Christian solutions for everyone's problems. Either way, there are better examinations of paranormal phenomena on most cable channels without the smarmy elements contained in this particular series, and if you're interested in this sort of thing, I recommend you start with those.",1391904000,,472,5.47945205479452

3089867,5,B0012IV3PA,"These episodes go beyond finding a ""thrill"" in various dwellings...

They show empathy for those effected by entities or imaginations or infestations...
They remain and do follow up sessions to make certain that lives in disorder are restored or that the living can find peace...

It's not overdone, and the psychics they often call upon are well known and effective.  They aren't there to sensationalize the event, though ratings may be boosted by some hollywood style FLUFF... they manage to keep it real.

Another aspect that makes the series strong, is that the participants and members of their Paranormal Research Institute are likeable and lack the robust ego that one often finds in ghost hunting documentaries or reality programs.

Paranormal State has been my personal favorite...  I wish they were still making episodes...

3089951,4,B0012IV3PA,"This is by far the least scripted ghost show I've seen, and I've seen every one of them I can find.  It has real people in it who have lives other than the PRS which is a real thing as well.
This show was a breath a fresh spooky air when I saw it.  I was so sick of shows where a few guys film themselves at yet another obviously haunted location. If a place makes money off their reputation of being haunted its not all that exciting to watch three guys spend the night there and get maybe one EVP.
The PRS goes to remote places to investigate hauntings of both locations and people.  Then they'll try to help make things better. Every episode brings a totally new situation and keeps your eyes on the screen hoping for a glimpse of a ghost.
The absolute WORST thing: Only season 1 is on Prime! If the had all the seasons I would be completely in love. Get all the seasons on Prime PLEASE!!!",1377648000,,892,4.144508670520231

3089962,2,B0012IV3PA,"So, this gets two stars because that represents ""I don't like it."" I feel like it's deserving of one star or less, but one star stands for ""I hate it."" I'll at least say that I don't HATE it, but that's about the only positive thing. I bought seasons 1-3 for $10 (which would be a good deal if this was anything worthy) at a yard sale. I've seen all the episodes from those seasons and repeatedly found plenty to be disappointed in.

Originally, I posted this with a whole lot of information, but it was getting so long. . .and I keep finding more and more. Thus, I removed a lot and will be making a video instead that will eventually be here or elsewhere.

Here are a few annoyances:

- You see moments after what would have been the commercial break that are different. For example, in one we have this 'psychic' talking about feeling a little girl who was murdered. Before the break, Ryan took off the hood of a jacket from his head. Afterwards, it was already off and the 'psychic' said the same words of how 'I think she was murdered.' So, she repeated her words at different times and the hood was off at different times. Also, things said at times include MORE information than the first time they were spoken. With episodes having about 20 minutes of time, except for the occasional double-length ones, obviously a lot is cut out. The retakes of scenes should at least be more accurate.

- I think it's silly that the 'psychics' are usually spot-on with many things...and then we frequently see members of PRS doing historical research to validate what they heard. Of course, the 'psychic' could easily have done the same thing first or found something on the internet before visiting a place. It always shows whoever the 'psychic' or 'medium' is pulling up to a place in a vehicle -- so they surely knew the address and might have researched or called someone up. Or just gotten details from people involved in the show. In every instance, team leader Ryan asks the guest ""I haven't told you anything about the place, right?"" and the visitor would say that he hasn't mentioned anything. Maybe so, but it's not proof that the 'psychic' definitely has no knowledge going into the location.

- The stupid audio-effects are annoying to the extreme. I don't want to hear fake heartbeats or whatever. Let me have total silence. Let me hear what is being heard in the room where everyone is, for crying out loud. I can't count the times someone said ""Did you just hear that?"" and I responded ""No...there are stupid sound effects interrupting."" I remember a time where they played a couple creepy music notes and I was saying ""Wow...that's a pretty-impressive for a ghost. I guess it's carrying a piano around.""

- In one episode, I was so surprised to see what looked like a person on the team WHO WAS JUST A CLIENT IN AN EARLIER EPISODE! To see her sitting at this table -- and it was the only time I saw her in the episode (and her name was different) -- was amazingly terrible. The likeness was completely similar and I thought right away 'Oh, come on! It's that same person I saw before!'

Oh, there are SO many thing in this to make it one of the worst in TV history, but I again wanted to keep this shorter. This is just a bad show. Cramming stuff into 20 minutes is stupid. The silly sound effects ruin everything and the creators are just trying to make the atmosphere more suspenseful and have it seem like the team is capturing more phenomena then they are. ""Did you hear that?"" statements run rampant and many times the viewer didn't hear what the participants supposedly heard because of an added audio effect or music. It's extremely rare when you can actually hear what is supposedly happening and there's nothing interfering.

""Ghost Adventures"", only in the first few seasons, genuinely had this skeptic curious and I was even spooked watching it the dark. I don't believe everything that's in that show either, but I surely enjoyed it more (again, only in the early seasons) despite all of the incredibly terrible EVP's they frequently have and claim to understand.

""Paranormal State""'s a TV show; it's meant to just entertain. There's a lot of ridiculousness and it's not that entertaining to begin with. Apparently, there's now a followup to this show (since it's over) called ""Paranormal State: THE NEW CLASS"" (something like that). I have no interesting in finding out if it's as terrible as this is.

I think it's interesting to hear certain stories from the PS show, but there's so little 'evidence' ever captured/shown. In my own investigations, the stories and history are the most interesting to me and not the moments of just speaking to the air or taking photos. I had the most fun with this show when I was noticing how bad it is with mistakes/fraudulent moments/dumb ideas and realizing how I -- even as a skeptic -- do better.",1373500800,5,4861,4.596309111880046

3090015,1,B0012IV3PA,"When I picked up this DVD for a bargain, I thought it was going to be the best bit of pocket change I had spent in a long time on a movie. Even my g/f was excited to start watching this. I mean, how can you go wrong, people investigating haunted places and over analyzing every little sound heard around the place at night... even tho I don't beleive any of these kind of things are real, and are just playing it up in order to make entertainment, this one here, I am sad to say, has got to be the most annoying of them all.

Why? Too much religious nonsense, that's why. Now the show itself would be ok, if they didn't have a bunch of useless people who are part of the posse and giving unneeded, and unwanted input into ""this place is creepy, I want to leave"" lines, and they usually do leave. But what makes me cringe more, is that this is, and I swear it's true, this is the kind of paranormal show for born again Christians. Being an atheist, it's just eye rolling to me that this guy's intro to every show is talking about how something happened to him as a kid, and he's been investigating paranormal activity since... but get this, get this.. it's hilarious... as you progress through the first season, a psychic picks up on the presence of a demon... wait, stay with me here... but this demon is not actually haunting the place they are in... no, it's following the main investigator around, and telling him to get ready to battle, because the time to square off is coming... I swear, I may have re-worded that a bit, but that's exactly what is going on in this season! To paint a better picture, imagine you are watching Ghost Hunters, and then Zuul and Goza start issuing challenges to the group, and saying, SOON we are going to battle. BWUAHAHAHAHA... Oh man, this show is pathetic.

The other thing I could not stand was that at the end of each show, which is usually a victory for them somehow because they have exorcized the demons to go away, they all huddle and pray... yes, you read that right, they pray and thank god. I may be atheist, but I know so many religious beliefs don't even beleive in demons or the devil, but this team here and their ghost-busting leader of prayer sure do. It becomes too annoying after seeing this in every episode, so annoying that I could not finish watching the rest of the season. I don't even care if it does build up to a big show down with this apparent demon that is following him around and issuing open challenges for a shot at the world title. This show just has way too much BS in it for my liking... and it's far from entertainment, as most of it is just this moron talking about his past, present and future, and just standing around staring with the exact same blunt look on his face when someone else is talking. This guy has had a complete charismatic bypass.

So if you think you would enjoy Ghosthunters with prayer and a demon stalker thrown in, by all means, check out the show... but if you think that sounds like a really lame idea for a show, then yeah, don't bother.

P.S: Anyone want my DVD copy? Just pay for the P&H and it's yours for free. They might make really a good Frisbee or a drink coaster.

P.P.S: I just read the other reviews here about this show being proven to be a scam. I must be psychic myself, i didn't even need to know there is confirmation about the show being a scam to know it was all complete BS. I might go use my newly discovered psychic powers to pull the mask off of ""The Biggest Loser"" being a show that promotes being fat is bad, being skinny gives you instant confidence.

1.  Google ""Paranormal state fraud"" and/or ""Chip Coffey fraud"" and just research for a few minutes the many hits that will come up.

2.  Read about the two former clients that have come forward with claims of fraud Episodes ""The Messenger"" and ""Hell House"" I believe.  One of their former clients is a self proclaimed psychic.  However before you dismiss her complaints as trying to get ""15 minutes more of fame"" read the whole story.  She was one of the clients in a episode called "" The Messenger"".
This episode had so much evidence that was, let's just say, unfavorable to PRS's credibility that this episode, despite been listed by Amazon as being on the second DVD of Season Two, had been removed from the DVD and you will NOT find it anywhere on Season Two.

All the posts were quickly removed for ""legal reasons"", despite the fact that other episodes on YouTube have not been as closely guarded by the producers of PRS.

4.  If you search the IMDB website on Chip Coffey, you will find out that he is, and has been, a professional actor all of his life.

Paranormal State, Season 1 is an excellent, excellent collection for anyone who has an interest in understanding those who have left this world, yet do not even know that they are dead. Yes, there are some ""good"" & there is ""Evil"". Understand this before watching, this is not just entertainment, this 3 DVD set of Paranormal State Season 1 is also a teaching tool. You will figure that out quickly. MAKE SURE YOU ARE PURCHASING THE 3 DVD COLLECTION OF PARANORMAL STATE. I was not disappointed with my purchase at all.

Mr. Buell & another of the team, will discuss one or more of the cases under the ""Comentary"" section on each DVD. Do NOT skip the commentary section, as you will miss important information which helps the watcher understand that PRS Research is not a straight line. Things may go bump in the night, but the PRS crew led by Ryan Buell do not just look to find spirits & the paranormal. I'm amazed at how careful, how intuitive, how respectful, and protective PRS are about the clients. I'm glad that I chose to watch the comentary, as I had been scratching my head wondering why certain conversations appeared stumbling & out of whack during one episode. Apparently, as the team is older then younger & older again, the episodes are not always in chronological order; but that takes nothing away from the experience. I highly recommend this Paranormal State Season 1 collection for anyone interested in or experiences the paranormal. This is the real deal, unlike the copy cat type shows who show or say nothing about their ""findings."" GET THIS COLLECTION OF PARANORMAL STATE SEASON 1, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT-BUT YOU WILL JUMP & you might want to leave a light
on a night or two.

The PRS Team have their own websites, one in conjunction with the channel that airs the show & another, where one can get written information about certain shows that may not be on the DVD. There is plenty of extra information on the ""Commentary"" section on each DVD of Paranormal State Season 1. It's also interesting watching the PRS team grow, while watching. They each refine their interview skills, learn respect for elders (I don't want to spoil it), learn to become comfortable in their own skin. Each member brings various skill sets with them, watching each hone those skills is incredible. Ryan Buell's faith, along with the faith of others, aids him along the way.

IMPORTANT:Paranormal State (any season) SHOULD NOT be shown to any child under the age of 15-17. It does not matter how great you are at explaining to your children about tv, etc., these experiences are REAL!",1270598400,,2713,4.659707724425887

I've been watching Ghost Hunters (via satellite and in the States) from almost the very beginning. I've now seen the original programs and have read the books of Jason and Grant too. I have to say that I believe that ghosts may exist, but I want some kind of evidence. Some kind of proof. These investigators -- and their paranormal investigation team -- work on the same premise. They attempt to ""debunk"" paranormal claims, but when they gather evidence that is hard to ""debunk"" or ""dispute,"" they are left with evidence that may actually support life after death (i.e., ghost, paranormal activity).

While Ghost Hunters works with a scientific leaning by utilizing technical equipment from EMF meters / K2 meters, digital thermometers, night vision cameras and thermal sensor equipment, etc., other paranormal programs utilize spirit mediums and the like. While I do not discount psychic mediums and sensitives, their evidence is hard to prove or ""debunk."" Nevertheless, programs like ""Paranormal State"" and ""Paranormal Cops"" (broadcast on A&E) have their place as well. They are certainly interesting. Psychic mediums like John Edward and Chip Coffee are quite interesting. In fact, I've been watching John Edward for many years. He's gotten a bit ""mushy"" as of late (even for WE) -- his original program on SyFy used to display his medium abilities more readily. In short, more readings.

Paranormal State also leans a little bit too much, perhaps, on Catholicism, but I love the protection chant: ""The Light of God Surrounds Us. The Love of God Enfolds Us. The Power of God Protects Us."" It's a great mantra!!!

Writers and psychic researchers like Peter Cayce are also quite interesting. Peter Cayce utilizes Science, Philosophy and Religion to come up with explanations for the afterlife and reincarnation and Karma. Interesting material.

In any case, the paranormal field is an interesting one. I'd really like to see more programs about legitimate psychics and paranormal investigators like Ghost Hunters, John Edward and Peter Cayce.

My question is, if the lady was psychic, why did she need PRS in the first place?  Shouldn't she be able to handle one ghost ""who has a message to pass on""?  Any rate, I like the approach taken here.  They seem to genuinely want to help the people in the cases.  If they are in over their heads, they say so and get someone in who can help them.  I do think they do try and debunk as much as possible, however it is only a half hour show and they can't show everything.  So I think they only show what they believe to be paranormal.

That said it does not mean I agree 100%. The differences being the Protestant / Catholic view. Some have said that this is a better series than TAPS. I agree but they have two different approaches to this subject. TAPS tries to disprove a haunting first. It takes alot to convince Jason before he claims a haunting. The fact they don't try to ""Clean up the mess"" is due to their Belief system (Spiritual) or lack of.  I too have experienced some paranormal events in my life. Thankfully not as extensive as some of PS cases but enough to know somethings out there. I do advise that children do not view this show till they are spiritually mature. You do not want them to ""Open Doors"" as some episodes will reveal. I really enjoy this series the PS crew is professional and compassionate. They clean up the spiritual mess left behind by diabolical forces. They do follow up with their clents and don't leave them hanging.",1256601600,,1074,4.536082474226804

Something was off on the show and I did some research. Low & behold the same lady ranted about the show, the host and Chip the ""psychic"". She explains how Chip knows everything ahead of time because you have to give that information when you are accepted onto the show, that's how Chip is always so spot on about everything. She told how they faked their findings of the ghost by using a cold beer can on the infrared camera as a cold spot. How 1 of the crew members ran around outside to create shadows in the house. Basically, she exposed the whole show. She had to call in someone else after they left because she truly had an experience in the house and Paranormal State made it worse. I don't watch anymore. They shouldn't advertise it as a ""reality show"" if there's nothing real about it.

These kids have a method, they follow it every time, and they seem to get results, so it's well worth a look.

He takes this stuff very seriously and I like the fact that he calls Lorraine Warren and also the Catholic Church into the most disturbing and troublesome cases.  Ghost Hunters or TAPS are great but they don't help to free the spirits from their earthly presence.  They don't clear out a demonic spirit or hold exorcisms to help homeowners which is usually needed.  Ryan and his team will do that.

3090067,2,B0012IV3PA,"First let me say that our family are experienced(30+ years) paranormal researchers as well as deeply religious and spiritual people. We bought this product in the hope that these episodes would have a ring of authentic paranormal ghost research experience without all the silly dramatics and ridiculous interpersonal highjinks of some other series of this type.  It seemed at first, that there was a sincerity and a professional attitude among Ryan and his group.  Soon however, we noticed that time and time again Ryan was inserting his own personal bias and religious beliefs into the investigations from the begining. He seems especially focused on findiing ""demonic"" explanations for what he hopes to encounter and lays that conceptional grid over everything.  One of the people watchiing with us asked jokingly;""Is this guy working for the Catholic church?"" Sure enough, time after time, he goes and gets his favorite demonologist and inserts her profoundly biased viewpoint into the equation, all the time manipulating the people involved and upping the drama factor in a really immature manner.  Any sincere paranormal researcher knows that in order to make sense of and an accurate diagnosis of a particular situation, these factors must be held in check and the observations must be as thoughtful and as critical as posssible.  It is not inappropriate to call upon Divine energy for help at the end stage but, to go in with your ""demon goggles"" on is just dishonest and potientially harmful to the people you are attempting to help.  At the end of the episode we saw tonight, Ryan dramatically asserts that he thinks he is somehow personally being tracked and will be battling a demon in the future. Oh Brother! What's next? Spinning heads and pea soup?  Give yourself andd the rest of us a break. Have you ever considered that you are, perhaps unconsciously, manufacturing and transporting your own ""demons"" into the situation and thereby ruining the integrity of your investigations leading another reviewer to state ""Its all about Ryan.""

I don't however, as do some other reviewers find Chip that inauthentic or distracting. Mediumship is an honorable and ancient tradition and it takes a personal toll on those who have the gift. They can't be like regular folks. What is imprortant is not his demeanor but the amount of correct information he appears to get(providing he isn't coached)

Just once, I'd like to see a thoughtful, caring, doctrinally unbiased examination of this unique, subtle human experience conducted in a focused, professional manner. Is that too much to ask?",1220486400,14,2593,5.111111111111111

The best part is the commentary, which I think shows Ryan and his crew as much more detailed, balanced, realistic and less dramatic than the 30 minute A&E editing suggests some times. The commentary answers a lot of concerns some other reviewers have. The shows ought to be 60 or 90 minutes.

A bunch of college kids with some video cameras and other ridiculous instrumentation trying SO hard to convince the audience and themselves that something paranormal is going on.  They never come up with anything that could remotely be considered as plausible evidence, just a bunch of suggestions, and speculation that they don't even bother to dignify with additional research.

I caught a couple recent shows and now they've added this other fraud, Chip Coffey, a ""medium"" who in BOTH shows I watched, happened to have something ""move"" unexpectedly near him.  Both times it was obvious that it would have been easy for him to move the item himself, and his acting was so bad that it convinced me that was the case.

3090071,5,B0012IV3PA,"This series captivated me from the very beginning, choosing to focus far more upon cases that require prolonged involvement over running through with equipment and calling it good (like ghost hunters).  Ryan heads up a quality team and focuses on cases where they actually stay the night (in most cases) and continue to keep in touch with the people they help.  If there's actually something going on that the client doesn't like, they actually make attempts to remove the spirit from the property, whereas Jay and Grant from TAPS simply say, ""Yep, your place is haunted.  We're out of here.""  Not once have they actually confronted and defeated any of the spirits they investigated.

This is Paranormal State's first season and they knocked it out of the park while still figuring out what worked on film and what didn't.  The second season ought to really sharpen their skills and test their metal.  I will recommend this season to anyone interested in the Paranormal.

This is a thirty minute show. Many critics juxtapose this series with other shows that go on for an hour. Yes, you are able to fit in a lot and show the skeptic approaches before finalizing any decision that the case is truly paranormal. I believe that prior to the airing, they have already preselected the cases to be the worst. Therefore, it does go through a priliminary skeptic approach.

Most people who do not like this particular show are probably people who do not believe in God. PRS (Paranormal Research Society) utilizes religious faith to rectify people's issues with the paranormal so people can go along with their normal lives. It is not like the ghost busters where you can vacuum them up. It's a different type of battle, it is intellectual. Nuff said!",1214611200,,776,4.698529411764706

3090095,1,B0012IV3PA,"I am a paranormal enthusiast. I enjoy Ghost Hunters because of their approach to the investigation and the fact that, as is to be expected, they don't always get results. They don't call a place haunted lightly (although they seem to be calling more places haunted in later episodes, as though they are selling out for the ratings). Paranormal State (which could be renamed B.S.U) however apparently knows just where to go to get an alleged hit EVERY time they go out. They show nothing to support their claims that something is actually happening. Film evidence? Nope. Infrared camera? Nothing. Their EVPs, when they have them? Questionable. (And don't even get me started on the Frank's Box that allows them to talk to the ghosts AND get immediate responses) What do we have to go on? Their on-call psychic, Chip Coffey(?). He is the type of psychic that gives the few legitemate psychics out there a bad name. I found myself getting so frustrated with these people and their alleged findings that I wished I could reach into the television and smack them. At one point I thought that maybe I was wrong in thinking that this was a reality show. I thought that it must be a television series about a reality show. Nope. It's a reality show. I will except having to give it a one star rating because I did actually think that the first episode was good. If you want to enjoy this series, stop at the first show. If you want a good investigative show, go with ""Ghost Hunters"". If you want good documentory type shows, I'd recommend ""A Haunting"" (but realize that they do tend to over-dramatize the events) and ""Haunted Histories"".

3090096,2,B0012IV3PA,"I picked this up to quench my thirst for the paranormal between Ghost Hunter DVD releases.  I was hoping for something that would continue in their vein of ""skeptic"" research.  When I saw the Penn State name attached to this series I actually hoped for progression.  In my wildest dreams an actual professor/doctor had decided to conduct some real research into the paranormal.  Boy, was I a fool.  ""Paranormal State"" is nothing more than a group of very young college kids (no Ph. D.s here) who drag paranormal research back down to what it was before Ghost Hunters started airing.  Psychics and witches rejoice!  Anything and everything goes.  Did I just hear a mouse fart?  No!  It was a ghost!  They even give serious consideration to a game called ""100 Candles,""  which I would've thought was ridiculous if I'd played it when I was twelve.  Very little is presented in the way of objective evidence.  A few EVPs come up, but they're unconvincing.  Someone ""sees"" a shadow, but it's never caught on tape (again: see Ghost Hunters for impressive, somewhat objective evidence).  And my favorite:  motion detectors that go off, but you can't see what tripped them because... the camera is in another room!  Are you kidding me?  How do you set up a motion detector and not have a camera next to it to see what set it off?  I know this is far-fetched, guys, but maybe, just maybe, there is a mouse or two in a house that has been deserted for six months.  And then there are the psychics.  Chip Coffey actually started to impress me until he started communicating with the dead.  Dead dogs that is.  Then they found a grave of a dog and dug it up.  Very disgusting.  It's head was missing, which I guess made it paranormal.  Or maybe it had something to do with that highway running through the front yard.  They never present this fact, though.  You have to look to notice that the house is in the country and that there is a highway about 50 feet away from the front door.  Way to present the facts, guys.  It's things like this that will insult you if you're intelligent.  You'll eat it up if you're not.",1211760000,8,2106,4.5186170212765955

However, I was not surprised as this is an A & E release who along with Picture This!, Acorn, Koch Vision, BBC America and Anchor Bay lead the way in releasing non-subtitled or closed captioned dvds.  I mention BBC America because it is most interesting that BBC releases in the UK are subtitled or closed -captioned but the same releases here are often not.

  Paranormal States is a superior show. Why is this and other quality shows not released with closed-captions or Subtitles.  All these companies engage in interstate commerce so why does the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) not apply to these releases which, when not subtitled or closed-caption, disenfranchise a large group of persons nation and world-wide?  Either this is deliberate flouting of the law or the law does not apply.

The one thing that is likeable is the praise and prayers to St. Michael but I wonder if he is paying any attention to this phony dramatized dribble.  Show some type of physical evidence. Use less ""psychic"" evidence.  And when I see Lorraine Warren all I can think about is The Amityville Horror Hoax that was pulled off on Long Island.  Why doesn't the lovely Ryan reinvestigate that hoax.  The only reason to watch this is for the hottie Ryan and Sergie  the dramatization of Saints, Catholic Church, and yes demons.  By the way supposedly A&E wanted to force some type of romance between Ryan and one of the girls....great for tv...Lousy for true paranormal investigating.  I also find it disigenious for Ryan to mention his parnormal experience without giving even a small hint of what happened. Why not help others who may have experienced something similar.  Oh he has that B named demon after him. The one you are not to suppose to say out loud.  Yet he has given this demon more attention to millions of people.

Ghost Hunters usually have alot of nothing going on, but still is interesting when they do catch something. Now there is Paranormal State. Why is Paranormal State so great. First of all not much happens here which leads me to believe that nothing is staged or fake on the show. The Best part of the show are the psychics who come in for a visit. Chip Coffey is overdramtic and funny when he demands, We Need An Exorcism. I get really excited when psychic Lorraine Warren pops on in an episode here and there.  I loved when Chip was in a trance and Lorainne smacked him in the face to wake him up. Funny Stuff Here. But the main characters are the people themselves. Half of them are crazy and looney and our host Ryan usually feels sorry for them by the end of every episode. There are plenty of scares and interesting findings in the show.

They should admid to the public that this is an obvious sham and let the real investigators do their job. Most Haunted opened the door for theatrics and fakery and Paranormal State blatently walked through. Jerry Springer would be proud as his audience now has even more bad acting and low budget directing to follow.

They do more than go into a situation and find evidence of spirits, a haunting, etc., they then try to solve the problem.  They don't just say - ""yeah, you've got a ghost, bye now."" They help the family understand what is happening and why, they help the spirit move on (or not, if the family decides letting it remain is the right thing to do).  It is all handled with sincerity and professionalism and great decorum.  When they do ""dead time"" and ask questions (hoping to get answers on the EVP recorder), they don't bombard the entity with questions, they ask a question, then give it an opportunity to respond.  They don't joke around when on site.  They don't yak to each other.  They focus totally on what they are doing.  They are so polite and caring.  Chip Coffey, the medium they bring in on some of the cases, is wonderful.  He is very talented and I like him a lot.

3324283,5,B0012IV3PA,"I won't bother recapping what this series is about as Amazon's description does a pretty good job laying out the basics, but I will say that the ""dating"" aspect of the description is very minute if not non-existant.

Now then, the difference between this show and Sci-Fi's Ghost Hunters is that they actually have access to and use the professional resources of two of the most famous paranormal investigators.  One is Chip Coffey.  He is a ""medium"" who can supposedly communicate telepathically with the dead.  And Lorraine something or other who was the lead investigator of the original Amittyville Horror case decades ago.  They also use what they call ""Dead Time"" which is 3:00am which has been said to be the most active time in the spirit world.  How spirits know what time it is in the real world in any given time zone, who knows?  But it is a fascinating idea and usually produces results.  Something I wish Jason and Grant would use in T.A.P.S.  They also use a variety of religious ceremonies/rituals to rid premises of the unwanted or trapped spirits, which in of itself goes one step further than T.A.P.S. does.

In one of the most recent episodes, they've used a new device called ""Frank's Box"" which apparently combines white noise, pink noise and several other spectrums of sound waves and outputs them through its speaker.  It is essentially a ""telephone to the dead"".  Because you can get instant EVP feedback and actually get direct real-time answers to questions.  The session in which it was used, it got clear feedback that ""there is 7 [spirits]"", one was named ""Lucy"", and that there was ""a demon"" present.  Very spooky stuff.

Now then, the episodes are of the 30 minute variety.  Yeah, I know, I wished they were an hour long, but they're very entertaining and unlike Ghosthunters, you actually get to see and hear ""actual"" paranormal activity.  The episodes have aired on A&E in full HD widescreen so the DVDs should be very excellent in terms of video quality.  Which is good because one of the female investigators looks like a cute earlier version of Avril Lavign (sp?), masquera and all. LOL!

I'm a big fan and really like the documentary show with the characters (original Pen State team) and all their interesting paranormal cases, but now that I finally had the chance to watched all of Season 5, I was extremely disappointed in (Episode 21 ""If I Should Die"") with the New Class/ new Pen State team. None of them look like or sounded like they had any kind of paranormal experience, or they didn't even provided any kind of entertaining value.  Thank god A&E did not produce another season with the New Pen State team.  Please bring back the original team, please add a new season starting in 2015 or 2016.

3324345,1,B0012IV3PA,"When you read this review, take into account I only watched one episode of it.  I admit that it isn't a great way to judge a series, because many good series had a less impressive start.  I watched one of the later episodes in Season 1 about a condo that had been converted from an old school house.

This show may represent what ghost hunting is probably really like.  They went to this place.  There had been no history of violent or premature deaths.  They had one EVP supposedly and a motion sensor go off--but they couldn't tell what had set it off.  It was very scientifically done.  None of this ""I'm so scared!"" stuff you see that can be silly but at least entertaining.  In the end, they didn't find much, and they just did a house blessing.

Now, I do believe in ghosts.  I also know that real life ghosts are never as interesting as the movies make them out to be.  This show probably does show the true reality of ghost hunting--from what the episode I watched.  On that merit, it may be a good documentary.  However, if you want entertainment, it makes for really boring TV.",1412899200,,1087,4.37

I particularly like Ryan which is why I'm so sad to know that he is facing terminal illness. God bless this man! Also, I feel having Lorraine Warren on the show adds a fair amount of credibility to their work. The big, and only, problem I have is that it doesn't have nearly enough of the actual footage of their explorations conducted during the cases. Even if, God forbid, Ryan was to pass, I would still watch the show if they would show more of what happens as they search, run tests, and attempts to communicate with the spirits, etc. All of it is definitely interesting, but without more of this content being shown to the viewer it feels as though the middle of the story is completely cut out.

They show empathy for those effected by entities or imaginations or infestations...
They remain and do follow up sessions to make certain that lives in disorder are restored or that the living can find peace...

It's not overdone, and the psychics they often call upon are well known and effective.  They aren't there to sensationalize the event, though ratings may be boosted by some hollywood style FLUFF... they manage to keep it real.

Another aspect that makes the series strong, is that the participants and members of their Paranormal Research Institute are likeable and lack the robust ego that one often finds in ghost hunting documentaries or reality programs.

This show was a breath a fresh spooky air when I saw it.  I was so sick of shows where a few guys film themselves at yet another obviously haunted location. If a place makes money off their reputation of being haunted its not all that exciting to watch three guys spend the night there and get maybe one EVP.
The PRS goes to remote places to investigate hauntings of both locations and people.  Then they'll try to help make things better. Every episode brings a totally new situation and keeps your eyes on the screen hoping for a glimpse of a ghost.

3324459,2,B0012IV3PA,"So, this gets two stars because that represents ""I don't like it."" I feel like it's deserving of one star or less, but one star stands for ""I hate it."" I'll at least say that I don't HATE it, but that's about the only positive thing. I bought seasons 1-3 for $10 (which would be a good deal if this was anything worthy) at a yard sale. I've seen all the episodes from those seasons and repeatedly found plenty to be disappointed in.

Originally, I posted this with a whole lot of information, but it was getting so long. . .and I keep finding more and more. Thus, I removed a lot and will be making a video instead that will eventually be here or elsewhere.

Here are a few annoyances:

- You see moments after what would have been the commercial break that are different. For example, in one we have this 'psychic' talking about feeling a little girl who was murdered. Before the break, Ryan took off the hood of a jacket from his head. Afterwards, it was already off and the 'psychic' said the same words of how 'I think she was murdered.' So, she repeated her words at different times and the hood was off at different times. Also, things said at times include MORE information than the first time they were spoken. With episodes having about 20 minutes of time, except for the occasional double-length ones, obviously a lot is cut out. The retakes of scenes should at least be more accurate.

- I think it's silly that the 'psychics' are usually spot-on with many things...and then we frequently see members of PRS doing historical research to validate what they heard. Of course, the 'psychic' could easily have done the same thing first or found something on the internet before visiting a place. It always shows whoever the 'psychic' or 'medium' is pulling up to a place in a vehicle -- so they surely knew the address and might have researched or called someone up. Or just gotten details from people involved in the show. In every instance, team leader Ryan asks the guest ""I haven't told you anything about the place, right?"" and the visitor would say that he hasn't mentioned anything. Maybe so, but it's not proof that the 'psychic' definitely has no knowledge going into the location.

- The stupid audio-effects are annoying to the extreme. I don't want to hear fake heartbeats or whatever. Let me have total silence. Let me hear what is being heard in the room where everyone is, for crying out loud. I can't count the times someone said ""Did you just hear that?"" and I responded ""No...there are stupid sound effects interrupting."" I remember a time where they played a couple creepy music notes and I was saying ""Wow...that's a pretty-impressive for a ghost. I guess it's carrying a piano around.""

- In one episode, I was so surprised to see what looked like a person on the team WHO WAS JUST A CLIENT IN AN EARLIER EPISODE! To see her sitting at this table -- and it was the only time I saw her in the episode (and her name was different) -- was amazingly terrible. The likeness was completely similar and I thought right away 'Oh, come on! It's that same person I saw before!'

Oh, there are SO many thing in this to make it one of the worst in TV history, but I again wanted to keep this shorter. This is just a bad show. Cramming stuff into 20 minutes is stupid. The silly sound effects ruin everything and the creators are just trying to make the atmosphere more suspenseful and have it seem like the team is capturing more phenomena then they are. ""Did you hear that?"" statements run rampant and many times the viewer didn't hear what the participants supposedly heard because of an added audio effect or music. It's extremely rare when you can actually hear what is supposedly happening and there's nothing interfering.

""Ghost Adventures"", only in the first few seasons, genuinely had this skeptic curious and I was even spooked watching it the dark. I don't believe everything that's in that show either, but I surely enjoyed it more (again, only in the early seasons) despite all of the incredibly terrible EVP's they frequently have and claim to understand.

""Paranormal State""'s a TV show; it's meant to just entertain. There's a lot of ridiculousness and it's not that entertaining to begin with. Apparently, there's now a followup to this show (since it's over) called ""Paranormal State: THE NEW CLASS"" (something like that). I have no interesting in finding out if it's as terrible as this is.

I think it's interesting to hear certain stories from the PS show, but there's so little 'evidence' ever captured/shown. In my own investigations, the stories and history are the most interesting to me and not the moments of just speaking to the air or taking photos. I had the most fun with this show when I was noticing how bad it is with mistakes/fraudulent moments/dumb ideas and realizing how I -- even as a skeptic -- do better.",1373500800,5,4861,4.596309111880046

3324512,1,B0012IV3PA,"When I picked up this DVD for a bargain, I thought it was going to be the best bit of pocket change I had spent in a long time on a movie. Even my g/f was excited to start watching this. I mean, how can you go wrong, people investigating haunted places and over analyzing every little sound heard around the place at night... even tho I don't beleive any of these kind of things are real, and are just playing it up in order to make entertainment, this one here, I am sad to say, has got to be the most annoying of them all.

Why? Too much religious nonsense, that's why. Now the show itself would be ok, if they didn't have a bunch of useless people who are part of the posse and giving unneeded, and unwanted input into ""this place is creepy, I want to leave"" lines, and they usually do leave. But what makes me cringe more, is that this is, and I swear it's true, this is the kind of paranormal show for born again Christians. Being an atheist, it's just eye rolling to me that this guy's intro to every show is talking about how something happened to him as a kid, and he's been investigating paranormal activity since... but get this, get this.. it's hilarious... as you progress through the first season, a psychic picks up on the presence of a demon... wait, stay with me here... but this demon is not actually haunting the place they are in... no, it's following the main investigator around, and telling him to get ready to battle, because the time to square off is coming... I swear, I may have re-worded that a bit, but that's exactly what is going on in this season! To paint a better picture, imagine you are watching Ghost Hunters, and then Zuul and Goza start issuing challenges to the group, and saying, SOON we are going to battle. BWUAHAHAHAHA... Oh man, this show is pathetic.

The other thing I could not stand was that at the end of each show, which is usually a victory for them somehow because they have exorcized the demons to go away, they all huddle and pray... yes, you read that right, they pray and thank god. I may be atheist, but I know so many religious beliefs don't even beleive in demons or the devil, but this team here and their ghost-busting leader of prayer sure do. It becomes too annoying after seeing this in every episode, so annoying that I could not finish watching the rest of the season. I don't even care if it does build up to a big show down with this apparent demon that is following him around and issuing open challenges for a shot at the world title. This show just has way too much BS in it for my liking... and it's far from entertainment, as most of it is just this moron talking about his past, present and future, and just standing around staring with the exact same blunt look on his face when someone else is talking. This guy has had a complete charismatic bypass.

So if you think you would enjoy Ghosthunters with prayer and a demon stalker thrown in, by all means, check out the show... but if you think that sounds like a really lame idea for a show, then yeah, don't bother.

P.S: Anyone want my DVD copy? Just pay for the P&H and it's yours for free. They might make really a good Frisbee or a drink coaster.

P.P.S: I just read the other reviews here about this show being proven to be a scam. I must be psychic myself, i didn't even need to know there is confirmation about the show being a scam to know it was all complete BS. I might go use my newly discovered psychic powers to pull the mask off of ""The Biggest Loser"" being a show that promotes being fat is bad, being skinny gives you instant confidence.

Paranormal State, Season 1 is an excellent, excellent collection for anyone who has an interest in understanding those who have left this world, yet do not even know that they are dead. Yes, there are some ""good"" & there is ""Evil"". Understand this before watching, this is not just entertainment, this 3 DVD set of Paranormal State Season 1 is also a teaching tool. You will figure that out quickly. MAKE SURE YOU ARE PURCHASING THE 3 DVD COLLECTION OF PARANORMAL STATE. I was not disappointed with my purchase at all.

Mr. Buell & another of the team, will discuss one or more of the cases under the ""Comentary"" section on each DVD. Do NOT skip the commentary section, as you will miss important information which helps the watcher understand that PRS Research is not a straight line. Things may go bump in the night, but the PRS crew led by Ryan Buell do not just look to find spirits & the paranormal. I'm amazed at how careful, how intuitive, how respectful, and protective PRS are about the clients. I'm glad that I chose to watch the comentary, as I had been scratching my head wondering why certain conversations appeared stumbling & out of whack during one episode. Apparently, as the team is older then younger & older again, the episodes are not always in chronological order; but that takes nothing away from the experience. I highly recommend this Paranormal State Season 1 collection for anyone interested in or experiences the paranormal. This is the real deal, unlike the copy cat type shows who show or say nothing about their ""findings."" GET THIS COLLECTION OF PARANORMAL STATE SEASON 1, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT-BUT YOU WILL JUMP & you might want to leave a light
on a night or two.

The PRS Team have their own websites, one in conjunction with the channel that airs the show & another, where one can get written information about certain shows that may not be on the DVD. There is plenty of extra information on the ""Commentary"" section on each DVD of Paranormal State Season 1. It's also interesting watching the PRS team grow, while watching. They each refine their interview skills, learn respect for elders (I don't want to spoil it), learn to become comfortable in their own skin. Each member brings various skill sets with them, watching each hone those skills is incredible. Ryan Buell's faith, along with the faith of others, aids him along the way.

IMPORTANT:Paranormal State (any season) SHOULD NOT be shown to any child under the age of 15-17. It does not matter how great you are at explaining to your children about tv, etc., these experiences are REAL!",1270598400,,2713,4.659707724425887

I've been watching Ghost Hunters (via satellite and in the States) from almost the very beginning. I've now seen the original programs and have read the books of Jason and Grant too. I have to say that I believe that ghosts may exist, but I want some kind of evidence. Some kind of proof. These investigators -- and their paranormal investigation team -- work on the same premise. They attempt to ""debunk"" paranormal claims, but when they gather evidence that is hard to ""debunk"" or ""dispute,"" they are left with evidence that may actually support life after death (i.e., ghost, paranormal activity).

While Ghost Hunters works with a scientific leaning by utilizing technical equipment from EMF meters / K2 meters, digital thermometers, night vision cameras and thermal sensor equipment, etc., other paranormal programs utilize spirit mediums and the like. While I do not discount psychic mediums and sensitives, their evidence is hard to prove or ""debunk."" Nevertheless, programs like ""Paranormal State"" and ""Paranormal Cops"" (broadcast on A&E) have their place as well. They are certainly interesting. Psychic mediums like John Edward and Chip Coffee are quite interesting. In fact, I've been watching John Edward for many years. He's gotten a bit ""mushy"" as of late (even for WE) -- his original program on SyFy used to display his medium abilities more readily. In short, more readings.

Paranormal State also leans a little bit too much, perhaps, on Catholicism, but I love the protection chant: ""The Light of God Surrounds Us. The Love of God Enfolds Us. The Power of God Protects Us."" It's a great mantra!!!

Writers and psychic researchers like Peter Cayce are also quite interesting. Peter Cayce utilizes Science, Philosophy and Religion to come up with explanations for the afterlife and reincarnation and Karma. Interesting material.

In any case, the paranormal field is an interesting one. I'd really like to see more programs about legitimate psychics and paranormal investigators like Ghost Hunters, John Edward and Peter Cayce.

My question is, if the lady was psychic, why did she need PRS in the first place?  Shouldn't she be able to handle one ghost ""who has a message to pass on""?  Any rate, I like the approach taken here.  They seem to genuinely want to help the people in the cases.  If they are in over their heads, they say so and get someone in who can help them.  I do think they do try and debunk as much as possible, however it is only a half hour show and they can't show everything.  So I think they only show what they believe to be paranormal.

I agree but they have two different approaches to this subject. TAPS tries to disprove a haunting first. It takes alot to convince Jason before he claims a haunting. The fact they don't try to ""Clean up the mess"" is due to their Belief system (Spiritual) or lack of.  I too have experienced some paranormal events in my life. Thankfully not as extensive as some of PS cases but enough to know somethings out there. I do advise that children do not view this show till they are spiritually mature.

She told how they faked their findings of the ghost by using a cold beer can on the infrared camera as a cold spot. How 1 of the crew members ran around outside to create shadows in the house. Basically, she exposed the whole show. She had to call in someone else after they left because she truly had an experience in the house and Paranormal State made it worse. I don't watch anymore.

3324564,2,B0012IV3PA,"First let me say that our family are experienced(30+ years) paranormal researchers as well as deeply religious and spiritual people. We bought this product in the hope that these episodes would have a ring of authentic paranormal ghost research experience without all the silly dramatics and ridiculous interpersonal highjinks of some other series of this type.  It seemed at first, that there was a sincerity and a professional attitude among Ryan and his group.  Soon however, we noticed that time and time again Ryan was inserting his own personal bias and religious beliefs into the investigations from the begining. He seems especially focused on findiing ""demonic"" explanations for what he hopes to encounter and lays that conceptional grid over everything.  One of the people watchiing with us asked jokingly;""Is this guy working for the Catholic church?"" Sure enough, time after time, he goes and gets his favorite demonologist and inserts her profoundly biased viewpoint into the equation, all the time manipulating the people involved and upping the drama factor in a really immature manner.  Any sincere paranormal researcher knows that in order to make sense of and an accurate diagnosis of a particular situation, these factors must be held in check and the observations must be as thoughtful and as critical as posssible.  It is not inappropriate to call upon Divine energy for help at the end stage but, to go in with your ""demon goggles"" on is just dishonest and potientially harmful to the people you are attempting to help.  At the end of the episode we saw tonight, Ryan dramatically asserts that he thinks he is somehow personally being tracked and will be battling a demon in the future. Oh Brother! What's next? Spinning heads and pea soup?  Give yourself andd the rest of us a break. Have you ever considered that you are, perhaps unconsciously, manufacturing and transporting your own ""demons"" into the situation and thereby ruining the integrity of your investigations leading another reviewer to state ""Its all about Ryan.""

I don't however, as do some other reviewers find Chip that inauthentic or distracting. Mediumship is an honorable and ancient tradition and it takes a personal toll on those who have the gift. They can't be like regular folks. What is imprortant is not his demeanor but the amount of correct information he appears to get(providing he isn't coached)

Just once, I'd like to see a thoughtful, caring, doctrinally unbiased examination of this unique, subtle human experience conducted in a focused, professional manner. Is that too much to ask?",1220486400,14,2593,5.111111111111111

3324566,5,B0012IV3PA,"I like this set a lot. The best part is the commentary, which I think shows Ryan and his crew as much more detailed, balanced, realistic and less dramatic than the 30 minute A&E editing suggests some times. The commentary answers a lot of concerns some other reviewers have. The shows ought to be 60 or 90 minutes.
I would detract a half point for the shows not being closed-captioned. I have to turn the sound way up for me too.",1218672000,,429,4.308641975308642
3324567,1,B0012IV3PA,"I've watched this show a few times just due to the ""train wreck"" effect.  A bunch of college kids with some video cameras and other ridiculous instrumentation trying SO hard to convince the audience and themselves that something paranormal is going on.  They never come up with anything that could remotely be considered as plausible evidence, just a bunch of suggestions, and speculation that they don't even bother to dignify with additional research.

I caught a couple recent shows and now they've added this other fraud, Chip Coffey, a ""medium"" who in BOTH shows I watched, happened to have something ""move"" unexpectedly near him.  Both times it was obvious that it would have been easy for him to move the item himself, and his acting was so bad that it convinced me that was the case.

The greatest achievement here is that these kids are getting paid to put this crap on the air.",1217894400,17,887,4.733766233766234
3324568,5,B0012IV3PA,"This series captivated me from the very beginning, choosing to focus far more upon cases that require prolonged involvement over running through with equipment and calling it good (like ghost hunters).  Ryan heads up a quality team and focuses on cases where they actually stay the night (in most cases) and continue to keep in touch with the people they help.  If there's actually something going on that the client doesn't like, they actually make attempts to remove the spirit from the property, whereas Jay and Grant from TAPS simply say, ""Yep, your place is haunted.  We're out of here.""  Not once have they actually confronted and defeated any of the spirits they investigated.

This is Paranormal State's first season and they knocked it out of the park while still figuring out what worked on film and what didn't.  The second season ought to really sharpen their skills and test their metal.  I will recommend this season to anyone interested in the Paranormal. You will NOT be disappointed.",1215820800,4,1000,4.916666666666667
3324569,5,B0012IV3PA,"All,

This is a thirty minute show. Many critics juxtapose this series with other shows that go on for an hour. Yes, you are able to fit in a lot and show the skeptic approaches before finalizing any decision that the case is truly paranormal. I believe that prior to the airing, they have already preselected the cases to be the worst. Therefore, it does go through a priliminary skeptic approach.

Most people who do not like this particular show are probably people who do not believe in God. PRS (Paranormal Research Society) utilizes religious faith to rectify people's issues with the paranormal so people can go along with their normal lives. It is not like the ghost busters where you can vacuum them up. It's a different type of battle, it is intellectual. Nuff said!",1214611200,,776,4.698529411764706

3324591,3,B0012IV3PA,"Good show!  This DVD eliminates the commercial interruptions so that is a plus.  Only bad thing is that it is not closed captioned, which I need in order to watch it without having the volume up high.  Why are all my favorite shows on DVD (Paranormal State, Ghost Hunters) not closed captioned?  They are when shown on TV!  Otherwise it is a great DVD if you don't need the captions.",1213142400,2,383,4.414285714285715
3324592,1,B0012IV3PA,"I am a paranormal enthusiast. I enjoy Ghost Hunters because of their approach to the investigation and the fact that, as is to be expected, they don't always get results. They don't call a place haunted lightly (although they seem to be calling more places haunted in later episodes, as though they are selling out for the ratings). Paranormal State (which could be renamed B.S.U) however apparently knows just where to go to get an alleged hit EVERY time they go out. They show nothing to support their claims that something is actually happening. Film evidence? Nope. Infrared camera? Nothing. Their EVPs, when they have them? Questionable. (And don't even get me started on the Frank's Box that allows them to talk to the ghosts AND get immediate responses) What do we have to go on? Their on-call psychic, Chip Coffey(?). He is the type of psychic that gives the few legitemate psychics out there a bad name. I found myself getting so frustrated with these people and their alleged findings that I wished I could reach into the television and smack them. At one point I thought that maybe I was wrong in thinking that this was a reality show. I thought that it must be a television series about a reality show. Nope. It's a reality show. I will except having to give it a one star rating because I did actually think that the first episode was good. If you want to enjoy this series, stop at the first show. If you want a good investigative show, go with ""Ghost Hunters"". If you want good documentory type shows, I'd recommend ""A Haunting"" (but realize that they do tend to over-dramatize the events) and ""Haunted Histories"". As for Paranormal State, don't waste your time or money.",1212105600,23,1686,4.6610738255033555
3324593,2,B0012IV3PA,"I picked this up to quench my thirst for the paranormal between Ghost Hunter DVD releases.  I was hoping for something that would continue in their vein of ""skeptic"" research.  When I saw the Penn State name attached to this series I actually hoped for progression.  In my wildest dreams an actual professor/doctor had decided to conduct some real research into the paranormal.  Boy, was I a fool.  ""Paranormal State"" is nothing more than a group of very young college kids (no Ph. D.s here) who drag paranormal research back down to what it was before Ghost Hunters started airing.  Psychics and witches rejoice!  Anything and everything goes.  Did I just hear a mouse fart?  No!  It was a ghost!  They even give serious consideration to a game called ""100 Candles,""  which I would've thought was ridiculous if I'd played it when I was twelve.  Very little is presented in the way of objective evidence.  A few EVPs come up, but they're unconvincing.  Someone ""sees"" a shadow, but it's never caught on tape (again: see Ghost Hunters for impressive, somewhat objective evidence).  And my favorite:  motion detectors that go off, but you can't see what tripped them because... the camera is in another room!  Are you kidding me?  How do you set up a motion detector and not have a camera next to it to see what set it off?  I know this is far-fetched, guys, but maybe, just maybe, there is a mouse or two in a house that has been deserted for six months.  And then there are the psychics.  Chip Coffey actually started to impress me until he started communicating with the dead.  Dead dogs that is.  Then they found a grave of a dog and dug it up.  Very disgusting.  It's head was missing, which I guess made it paranormal.  Or maybe it had something to do with that highway running through the front yard.  They never present this fact, though.  You have to look to notice that the house is in the country and that there is a highway about 50 feet away from the front door.  Way to present the facts, guys.  It's things like this that will insult you if you're intelligent.  You'll eat it up if you're not.",1211760000,8,2106,4.5186170212765955
3324594,1,B0012IV3PA,"This show appealed to me as a 'Ghost Hunter' fan.  Wow, was that a mistake.  While the 'Ghost Hunters' enter a site wearing their skepticism and ready to debunk anything they can, THIS program has college kids who go into the site assuming it is haunted, possibly cursed with demons.  They don't even attempt to look for other explanations, they just sit around deciding whether to call a priest to exorcise the place.

Seriously, this is not a good program, save your time and money...",1211414400,25,486,4.682352941176471

I am really into the paranormal and spiritual so I thought I'd give this series a shot. I was NOT disappointed at all! It is extremely well done. The re-inactments are very real-looking, and very scarry. I am a big fan of ""Ghost Hunters"" on the Sci-Fi channel, and even though ""A Haunting"" is not technically a reality show, it is sure to please any fan of this same subject matter.

3324596,4,B0012IV3PA,"I too had looked forward to the release of this series on dvd.  I am disappointed that even though the series was shown on TV with closed captions, the dvd set does not have them.  However, I was not surprised as this is an A & E release who along with Picture This!, Acorn, Koch Vision, BBC America and Anchor Bay lead the way in releasing non-subtitled or closed captioned dvds.  I mention BBC America because it is most interesting that BBC releases in the UK are subtitled or closed -captioned but the same releases here are often not.

  Paranormal States is a superior show. Why is this and other quality shows not released with closed-captions or Subtitles.  All these companies engage in interstate commerce so why does the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) not apply to these releases which, when not subtitled or closed-caption, disenfranchise a large group of persons nation and world-wide?  Either this is deliberate flouting of the law or the law does not apply. If the former then Congress should have an investigation into this matter and if the latter than Congress should amend the law to require these producers to release all dvds with closed-captioning subtitles.  Other than sheer greed combined with inconsideration I see not reason why dvd releases should not be.",1210809600,2,1289,4.876146788990826

However, I am deaf, and while the TV series is closed-captioned, the DVD isn't. What the....? Extremely disappointed with whomever made that decision. I like the series because they don't pretend to ""know it all"" (they do research and learn more as they go along), they do seem to want to help the people involved(even though the people have to pay attention and want to help themselves first), and it deals with people and their situations, not empty haunted buildings. Also, if Lorraine Warren is willing to work with these folks, that gives them credibility as far as I'm concerned. Amityville was not a hoax. Do your research. And read the Warren's book.",1210464000,3,766,4.723880597014926
3324599,2,B0012IV3PA,"This show can not hold a candle to Ghost Hunters.  I have never seen one shred of credible evidence.  Why do they not call this the Chip Coffey show.  They have never capture evidence of a demon.  I am a Catholic I find it very interesting how they use the religion on this show( its very dramatic...great tv)The pagan is boring. The one thing that is likeable is the praise and prayers to St. Michael but I wonder if he is paying any attention to this phony dramatized dribble.  Show some type of physical evidence. Use less ""psychic"" evidence.  And when I see Lorraine Warren all I can think about is The Amityville Horror Hoax that was pulled off on Long Island.  Why doesn't the lovely Ryan reinvestigate that hoax.  The only reason to watch this is for the hottie Ryan and Sergie  the dramatization of Saints, Catholic Church, and yes demons.  By the way supposedly A&E wanted to force some type of romance between Ryan and one of the girls....great for tv...Lousy for true paranormal investigating.  I also find it disigenious for Ryan to mention his parnormal experience without giving even a small hint of what happened. Why not help others who may have experienced something similar.  Oh he has that B named demon after him. The one you are not to suppose to say out loud.  Yet he has given this demon more attention to millions of people.  Hopefully people will be more interested in the POWER of St. Michael than of evil B. I suggest that Ryan and the gang start looking in St. Dymphna who is also very helpful(look into it) Until I SEE some type of small real-world evidence I will rate this show as more drama than true paranormal invesitating.

So I watched.  And realized I HAD watched so many years ago.  And forgotten it completely.  Each and every episode had been forgotten.  In fact I have to write faster because I am starting to forget them again!
You know the episodes you find in some television series where they needed filler?  There is always a few episodes where they had a story on the sets they already paid for using costumes they already had and using props they found in the greenroom.  It is a way to keep you glued to the screen waiting for the REAL episodes to show up, without using money or talents.
This WHOLE DVD set felt like it was all filler.  Like they were just keeping you glued to the  television till they could think up some good ideas.  I would watch a whole episode and feel like I had fallen asleep - I remembered nothing of importance about the episode.  Maybe I did fall asleep?
If you want ghost hunters buy...well, Ghost Hunters.  This just feels like a A&E was trying to cash in.  And before I finish let me say I have nothing against the PRS of Penn State.
