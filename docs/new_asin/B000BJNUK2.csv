8087420,2,B000BJNUK2,"While I am grateful that Amazon sells esoteric videos of all kind, no one liked this DVD and the bar is pretty low on videos in our media-free house.  A friend with an autistic daughter recommended this to us since my son got interested in bodily functions, and I got the DVD without finding any youtube clips to preview.  It's a mistake I regret!  Perhaps because we are neurotypical, the video seemed to be mostly someone shouting dictionary definitions at us while the music blared in the background.

We loved TMBG's ""Here comes Science"" and this DVD is nowhere near that.  If you are just looking for a sciency DVD, I recommend trying them out first.

I gave this an extra star because they were at least shouting factually accurate things at us.",1474761600,,751,4.609022556390977
8087421,5,B000BJNUK2,"All of the Squibs videos are advanced and they attempt to simplify subjects as much as possible. The animations aren't great, but they are creative and there are some catchy rhymes and songs in each video. When I was a medical student, I bought the Squibs video on the body systems and I absolutely loved it. My son (3 at the time) wouldn't sit down and watch it, but I would play it in the room while he was playing with his toys. Occassionally he would look up at it for a bit and keep on playing. Because of comments he would make to me, I was sure that he was inadvertanly retaining some of what he was hearing on the Squibs video. So I bought more. After I started doing the same thing with the Squibs Chemistry, he told me that, ""when wood burns it's undergoing a chemical reaction."" I now have the entire Squibs set and I am very pleased with everyone of them. They are really fantastic learning tools and give a nice overview of many different subjects. Just don't expect mindless ""educational"" cartoons like Little Einsteins (I was never happy with any of that line) because this is certainly way beyond that.",1233187200,2,1118,4.432038834951456
8087422,5,B000BJNUK2,"I absolutely love to show this DVD to my 7th and 8th grade students.  They remember the lyrics to the catchy tunes, sing along, have fun, and learn science all at the same time.  I've even heard them humming the tunes to these songs in the hallway!
Some of the chapters (songs) are more entertaining than others, but overall this is an outstanding video to help children understand and enjoy science.

8087423,4,B000BJNUK2,"If you want your child (and probably yourself!) to be challenged by an educational science video, this is the series to get.  Squibs covers detailed concepts and terminology from a wide range of sciences.  I am reasonably well versed in the sciences, yet I learned new facts right along with the kids.

The Squibs producer don't pull any punches when it comes to providing correct information and terminology.  In fact, unlike many other science videos for kids that I've watched, I have yet to see inaccurate information in any of the Squibs videos.

The only negative aspect I see on these shows are some of the songs themselves.  In an effort to diversify the music and connect with modern music, some of the songs are hard to understand and feel disjointed.  One complaint I have seen is that the videos gloss over too much information to be useful.  One reviewer stated, ""It attempts to cover an entire textbook or two of material in seconds"".  This is a valid concern although I think misguided.  It does indeed cover a large amount of information in a short time, but it is not intended to be used in a vacuum.  Books, games, discussions, and repetition are critical to help your kids understand what has just been presented.  No video alone can teach them all they need to know about science.

Despite being a bit over their heads, my children (age 5 and 8) love these shows and watch them whenever they can.  They enjoy them, but most importantly, they are learning and remembering.

Yes, it's complex; yes, it's challenging; and yes, you may occasionally feel stupid watching it; but if the show doesn't challenge your kids to think and learn, what's the point of watching?",1183420800,5,1683,4.715753424657534
8087424,1,B000BJNUK2,"Don't waste your money - this video teaches nothing.  It consists of a series of obnoxiously loud, often unintelligible songs comprised of an absolute hodgepodge of fairly sophisticated and yet undefined scientific terms.  Even with a reasonably firm scientific background, I found the songs incomprehensible.  There is no introduction to any of the concepts, merely a sudden and complete immersion into terms, terms and more terms.  I wish I could articulate more clearly what a complete waste of time this video (and one of the others in the series, as well) is, but I am left speechless after the verbal barrage I have just been subjected to.  It's too late for me, but not for you!  Save yourself!",1150156800,20,701,4.898305084745763
