8699413,5,B00SVBVEK0,It's a great documentary film. The picture quality is good and the picture is good. It would have been better if I only had a live performance. I feel so much less mysterious because it shows too much.,1514246400,,201,4.315789473684211
8699414,5,B00SVBVEK0,It is a charming story of the beginning of a brilliant career. I rate it higher than similar story about Kissin,1504051200,,111,4.333333333333333
8699415,4,B00SVBVEK0,Enjoyed Daniil's playing but had difficulty understanding some of hi dialogue. Enlish subtitles would had helped. till I highly recommend this DVD to show the artistry this extraordinary pianist.,1491264000,,195,5.758620689655173
8699416,3,B00SVBVEK0,"They put every subtitle except English. . Daniil Trifonov is a brilliant pianist but hard to understand when speaking. It would have
Been nice to be able to read subtitles so we can get to understand his genius .",1465862400,6,212,4.461538461538462
8699417,3,B00SVBVEK0,"This is a disappointment.  The second film is not the promised full recital but four shorter works that may have been encores.  The auditorium must have been very warm inside because Trifonov drips sweat from his hair and forehead while he plays.  It's so much of a distraction that he's hard to watch.  The playing of course is superb, but you can get that with just an audio CD.  The first film is worth watching, but there's nothing truly insightful there.",1448236800,7,459,4.617283950617284
8699418,5,B00SVBVEK0,"There is no question that Daniil Trifonov is ""the"" pianist of this generation.  The documentary gives and insight to his training, concert preparation and learning process, and his personality.  The latest is quite enjoyable as he is able to convey so many emotions with his hands and the keyboard sometimes in subtle ways, mastering such way of communicating more so than his peers.  In addition, the recital is amazing and shows him at his best.  Without a doubt, he is one of the best in the world.",1446681600,9,501,4.724137931034483
8699419,5,B00SVBVEK0,"Daniil Trifonov is incredible!  If you've never seen or heard him you are missing an absolutely fantastic pianist.  I've been fortunate to see him twice in concert, and look forward to many more.  This DVD is only a small fraction of his greatness!",1444953600,9,248,4.72093023255814
8699420,5,B00SVBVEK0,He is the best pianist I ever heard.  Fantastic!,1443225600,4,48,4.333333333333333
