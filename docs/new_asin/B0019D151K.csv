3432624,5,B0019D151K,"First there was Cain and Able..Then there was Felix and Oscar..and Now there is Charlie and Alan Harper.

Charlie Sheen and Jon Cryer play the Harper Brothers. Season after season the show has gotten better and better. I don't think that this season, shorted by the writer's strike , did they reach the comedy heights of previous seasons..but the humor is one of the best sexual farces TV has to offer.

The One reason I love this show on DVD is it is like watching a great one act play. This may seem like a sitcom but it tramples boundaries of great farces. It can grab you and reel you into laughter in moments.

The supporting cast is just as sharp as Sheen and Cryer. Agnus Jones plays Alan's son Jake, who is smarter than his uncle Charlie. Conchata Ferrell as the housekeeper Berta wisecracks her way into your heart. Melanie Lynskey is Charlie's stalker and neighbor Rose. Holland Taylor steals every scene she is in as Charlie and Alan's mother.

This show is not for kids. I still wonder why the reruns are on at 7p when kids are around. This, in my opinion,  is a very  adult comedy in the vein of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superbad-Unrated-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000WZEZGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superbad (Unrated Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;.Boy I laugh a lot when watching this show!

3432626,5,B0019D151K,"It's good to see that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Two-and-a-Half-Men-The-Complete-Fourth-Season/dp/B0019D151K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Two and a Half Men - The Complete Fourth Season</a>&nbsp;is coming out on DVD, for (in my personal opinion) it's the best and funniest sitcom series of this decade. As a single father, this viewer can find much to relate to... and laugh about.

For those who haven't had the pleasure of seeing this top-rated series on TV, it's about the lives of two brothers, one of the brother's son, and the many people, especially women, who surround them. When his wimpy younger brother Alan Harper (Jon Crier) becomes separated from his wife and moves out of their house, he has to move in with Charlie, his older brother (played by Charlie Sheen). Alan shares custody of his son Jake (Angus T. Jones), who was 10 when the series began and who stays with them part-time. The ""half a man"" in the title of this sitcom is in reference to the fact that Jake isn't an adult yet.

Charlie Harper is a successful bachelor with a house on Malibu Beach, a Mercedes in the garage and an easy way with women. His easygoing, often hedonistic single lifestyle is interrupted when his tightly-wound brother, Alan (a chiropractor), and Alan's son, Jake , move in with him. Alan's hung-up ex-wife Judith (Marin Hinkle) frequently makes matters worse, as does the brothers' narcissistic mother, Evelyn (Holland Taylor), whose wide-ranging sex life is a recurring gag throughout the series. The brothers' housekeeper Berta (Conchata Ferrell) is unapologetically sarcastic, and often has the best one-liners, trading insults with Charlie referring to Alan as ""Zippy."" Their household can't function without her.

There are a number of other series regulars, but in this viewer's opinion, Charlie's wacky neighbor and female stalker Rose (Melanie Lynskey) is one of the best. She has a habit of popping over Charlie's deck railing and sometimes enter his house at inopportune moments. It's alluded that she had a one night stand with Charlie shortly before the show started, which she believed to be more significant than he did. Rose's father Harvey is played by Martin Sheen, and in one episode he asks Charlie of his intentions with his daughter. At one point Harvey meets Charlie and Alan's mother and has an affair with her, and popping in and stalking her just like his daughter does with Charlie.

It should be said that this series and its actors have won a number of Emmy Awards and nominations. Those who are familiar with it can well understand why. This series is well worth it, and if you do like it, there are other seasons available:

We have laughed ourselves silly through every vicarious second of it. We just bought the first dvd series of this show and can't wait to watch it from the start. I have been watching series 4 in reruns on tv. I don't know if it is season 4 but my favorite episode is when Charlie becomes the hapless victim and sex slave of a witch's coven. He is saved by his mother who strikes fear into the coven ending the show perfectly dressed as the Wicked Witch of the West. This is not a show for kids, but adults, especially those with and ex or two, or crazy relatives should love it.",1212796800,12,717,4.240875912408759

3432729,5,B0019D151K,"Two and a Half Men was really funny when Charlie Sheen was in his role on the sitcom, and Angus Young was also priceless as the young kid. Charlie of course did a terrible thing reciting his own anger at one of the producers. Anybody, technical people or actors, that you definitely do not offend a producer of a show. I half wonder if Charlie and Angus knew that Angus' age would make him not a little kid anymore, and the show would not be nearly as funny, so they made a pact-decision with one of the producers of the TV show. Charlie would be upset, he would be fired from the show, Angus didn't have to be on the show nearly as much, and the show would deal with the outcome of any ""shenanigans"" that the public might perceive happened. In my opinion maybe, that one of the producers wasn't really mad, Charlie didn't really offend one of the producers, and the show has gone on regardless of how Charlie's' character would be ""eliminated"" from the cast. I have not liked the show since. It's not nearly close to being funny anymore, which is probably what the producers, Angus, and Charlie knew it would be, and they decided to make a ""disaster"" of Charlie's character going away, dying as it was made.",1378598400,,1208,4.42152466367713

3432744,4,B0019D151K,"Chuck Lorre is a brilliant man; a complex but calm man who has realized that as the boss in a performing arts company he must remain calm and staid because almost no one else will, He got his start, as most of the Hollywood writing staff did, on Roseanne, where his writing skills were honed under the demands of a woman who planned out an entire series between season two and three.
Roseanne was making a plug for women's rights and it centered on the fact that women were capable of doing just about anything. Sadly, in the late 80'ws and early 90's the methods she used were by making men seem like idiots. John Goodman is not only a brilliant actor and a man who clearly wanted out of his  contract in season nine, managed to come across as a wonderful man; a feminist who refused to give up his maleness. Still, we watched Roseanne hit him in the head with a cast iron skillet one too many times. When Roseanna (who had a philosophy that any writer had one or two good season in him and then it was time to cut him loose- she was wrong) released Lorre, he went on to create Dharma and Greg, Becker, Two and a Half Men and The Big Bang Theory. Lorre manages to do well by surrounding himself with outstanding people and allowing them to do their jobs. There is plenty of laughter on the set and Charlie Sheen aside, there are no ""stars"" on his shows. The Big Bang Theory is an excellent example of ensemble work we haven't seen since Marta Kaufman and David Crane gave us ""Friends.""
 Two and a Half Men is about two unmarried brothers. Charlie (played by Charlie Sheen), two years older, who has managed a career as a musician writing jingles for advertising- bringing in vast amounts of money, a house on Malibu Beach and an endless supply of single malt scotch. Alan (Jon Cryer) is an anal retentive chiropractor- not quite a doctor- who was kicked out of his home a la Felix Unger by his wife of twelve years named Judith.(Marin Hatch) They share custody of a boy, Jake (expertly played by Angus T. Jones) whp is lazy, fraqnk and has the typical locker room humor of a young adolescent. The premise- at first- was to see how an adolescent boy would co-exist with a single uncle who is living with a Peter Pan comp-lex, bringing in woman after woman foir meaningless one night stands, developing a reputation where by almost anywhere he goes woman are saying ""Hi, Charlie"" or ""Charlie, you filthy creep! You ruined my life.""
 On the surface, Alan comes across as the better behaved of the two and we strongly suspect that Lorre intended this. However, Alan begins to make up for last time and despite the many jokes about Charlie thinking with his penis, we noticed that soon enough Alans penis was doing all of HIS thinking and at a substantially lower IQ than that of Charlie's. Aolan spends all of his time comp0laining about how easily things come to Charlie while he has had t5o dfight for every single failure in his life. What is left to us to see is that Charlie has just as many challenges and failures as Alan but has learned not to complain about them. His relaxed attitude serves him better than Alan's constant anxiety and explosive diarrhea. Still, it is often Charlie who gets a surprise trip to the Emergency room. Charlie is the one who's got a stalker and had his testicles super glued to his thighs. Charlie is the one who is a kind man and wants nothing more than kindness in return. Alan is unable to see this and thus feels great jealousy about the fact that he feels that he struggles and struggles, loses everything, while Charlie has gold falling from the sky.
 Alan wastes every opportunity he has. His second marriage comes about a year and a half after Judith has thrown him out and he ends up in a weekend long sex marathon with a girl whose body is spectacular and her very loe I.Q. somehow makes her even more sexy. She is enamored by Alan;s sweetness and doesn;lt mind that she is half his age. She struts around the house in a bikini, to the delight of young Jakes and, during a foolish moment in Las Vegas, Alan marries her. Fifteen minutes later a single coin in the slot wins him a half million dollars and then four months after that she has thrown him out and he has eleven dollars left.;
 And Charlie is the fool?
 The show doesn't make any attempts to teach us lessons and this is nice. After all we wept through Family Ties, M*A*S*H*, Designing Women and even Roseanna, but it is nice to have a TV series where there is never any growth- a pure half hour of comedy.
 As each season passes we see that both men are destroyed by childhood issues stemming from a terrible mother played expertly by the clkassic Holland Taylor). The boys father died when they were swtill in elementary school by food poisoning of fish. ""( I was a new housewife and learning to cook, "": Said Evelyn- their mother, ""How was I to know that fish couldn't be kept in a drawer? ""
 Charlie contends that his father KNEW the fish was bad and he ate it anyway. Alan refuses to discuss it. After his death came a string of ""Uncles"" who helped to raise the boys. Alan became the type A child who did anything he could to please but never succeeded. Charlie simply began to drink and have indiscriminate sex. They endured boarding school, Charlie got out as fast as he could and Alan married a duplicate of his mother. Alan gets reamed for both Alimony and Child Support. He loses the house, all the money, the furniture and the car. Why? Because Charlie couldn't heolp himself and slept with, then dumped, Alan;s attorney.
 Similar episodes occurred with Jake's Karate teacher, den mother, fifth grade teacher and countless others. Charlie falls in love more often and Alan ends up in terrible situations because off his loud but stupid penis. (a true highlight is his venture into computer dating when Alison JAnney plays a date who leaves, saying good night to Charlie, explaining she has to get up for work and that Alan has turned into bed for the night. Charlie who is plagued by being in love with a ballet dancer who will be traveling, enters Alan's room to see him cuffed at fours in red stockings, arm gloves and leather corset and panties.
 Alison Janney is an excellent example of the remarkable guest stars that visit this show. Martin Sheen plays an emotionally unbalanced father of Charlie's stalker, Rose (perhaps the gem of the series), Robert Wagner plays the boys father and as a result of a fun conversation between Chuck Lorre and the creator of CSI, a switch of writing staffs occur creating a hysterical episode here and a wonderful CSI parody. CLoris Leachman  moves in next door, Sean Penn and Elvis Costello play themselves in a support group with Charlie. Martin Mull is a remarkable pharmacist trying to compete with the larger chains and copes by delving into the sample drawers. He pays three sets of alimony but not a cent of child support. It goes on and on.
 The gem of the series is Conchetta Ferrall who plays Berta, Charlie's housekeeper who does much more than keeps house. She is part of the family and her wit and wisdom is curt and cute. Nothing disgusts her (one morning after finding a bra abd panties on the kitchen table with the bananas and the butter says, ""Good God, I'm workin;' for Caligula."" She's a good woman, the mother of a handful of failure girls for whom she'd face a meth chemist to extort $5,000 in pre-paid child support. She could have only five lines in a scene and still manage to steal it. The house can't run without Berta and she and Charlie have a strong relationship, well defined and honed over the course of many years.
 Okay. The writing is full of 8th grade fart jokes but they're cleverly written so that one must delve into intelligence to get the meaning. There's a great deal of gas, as a result of a 12 year old boy who will (and can) eat anything and has no shame. We have watched only up to season six and we suppose that there's not a soul in America who has not heard of the medical condition that crashed Charlie Sheen. We have not seen that final season as his illness took him down nor have we viewed any of the new seasons with the adorable and perpetually adolescent Ashton Kutcher. The series is approaching it';s 200tgh episode, something rarely seen in television so that there are 8 seasons before Mr Sheen's illness affects the show- if at all. We will revisit this subject when the time comes, but in the mean time, score this one as a way of understanding men- of making up for the men hating Roseanne and at looking at two emotionally damaged men and why. All the women in this series are depicted as equally damaged with the expception of Berta and Charlie's stalker. There is the regular appearance of a therapist- a [psychiatrist who still does therapy at $250 an hour and from time to time all two and a half men have sat with her. She played a phys ed teacher on Old Christine and now has a lead in the show Glee- the only actress in Hollywood taller than Alison Janney, she spends most of her scenes seated in her expensive chair making jokes at the expens fo Charlie or Alan and helping them to come to terms with what haunts them.
 Yes, it took us years to open our arms to Two and a half Men because at first, it appears to be arm-pit farts and network Pokys, but it is ever so much more. This is a good one for everyone and even more so for any man who has been under the control over the stronger sex.",1356652800,,9421,4.438150289017341

3432834,5,B0019D151K,"One of the few American series that transcends the fascist mentality of political correctness. It is a yes, very sexist look at the world of men and how we see ourselves and the fairer sex. I mean let's face it, self delusion and self deception is the basic mantra and physic of (really) every male. An... hey I am not really going bald..... For most guys add great deal of being shallow and there you go. Men. I don't see this show as a statement about women, but one of how stupid guys can be when it comes to life and the le femme. When it comes to women, let's face it we are idiots. It would be so easy if like the chimpanzees, all a guy had to do to impress a female is climb all over the monkey bars or in the branches of a tree. I own all four of the current seasons that are out and they made great presents for my buddies and their open minded ladies. So if you are looking for a great laugh or a reason to get pissed off Two and a Half Men should fit the bill. Enjoy.",1231718400,,978,3.9444444444444446

3432850,5,B0019D151K,"This show is funny.

The story is this, Charlie Harper is a bachelor living in California. His brother Alan got divorced and moved in with him along with his nephew Jake.

Last season Charlie had gotten back together with his former flame Mia. They almost got married in Vegas, but instead Alan and his 22 year old girlfriend Kandi got married before winning a half a million dollars in the slots.

During this season Alan's marriage is over and he moves back in with Charlie. Also during the season Alan's ex wife Judith gets married to Jakes pediatrician Herb Melnick, and Alan and Charlie's mother has a new flame in Teddy (played by Robert Wagner)

The season is a hoot with good acting by Charlie Sheen, Jon Cryer and Angus T. Jones.",1226102400,,738,4.568181818181818

3432853,5,B0019D151K,"Charlie Sheen and Jon Cryer have a chemistry that's nearly unmatchable. Putting these two guys together was a stroke of genius...there's a temptation to compare them to Matt Leblanc and Matthew Perry and their chemistry on ""Friends"" amped up a notch or two. The character of Jake is the perfect foil for these two, and the sarcasm of their housekeeper all seems to be perfectly timed. The writing is edgy and truly funny, and just when you think they couldn't come up with anything wilder...they have. Family friendly? Doubtful...drop dead funny? You bet.",1225324800,,555,4.978494623655914

3432855,5,B0019D151K,"If you liked the first three seasons you'll like this one too. More of the same kinds of fun. Sexually suggestive humor and good looking women, sign me up! I thought the kid (Jake/my favorite character) might be getting too old to be as effective, but he still pulls it off for the most part. I think the writers will have to start changing his lines a little in season five. Things that were cute/funny when he was younger might come off as just a rude/disrespectful teenager as he gets older. The only negative so far is I waste too much time watching tv when this is on or in the dvd player.",1225065600,2,594,4.265486725663717

8273468,5,B0019D151K,"The fourth season might be the best of the twelve seasons with great guest stars like Brooke Shields as a rich divorcee; Robert Wagner as Evelyn's newest boyfriend, Teddy; Steven Tyler as himself renting the house next door; Katherine LaNasa as Lydia; Sara Rue as Berta's pregnant daughter, Naomi; Jessica Collins and Susan Sullivan in the Christmas episode; Ryan Stiles as Herb Melnick, Judith's second husband; Tammy Lauren; Judy Greer as Myra, Herb's sister; Allison Janney playing Beverly, Alan's online date; Morgan Fairchild; Lee Garlington; Matt Roth; Jane Lynch as the psychologist; Joel Murray and Enrique Inglesias as Fernando.

The fourth season started with Alan being dumped again by his second wife, Kandi (April Bowlby) and goes through a painful divorce. Charlie recovers from his breakup with Mia at the alter. Judith remarries Dr. Herb Melnick. Rose leaves for London, England. Evelyn started dating Teddy Leopold (Robert Wagner). There are plenty of funny and wonderful witty episodes with typical raunchiness in every episode. There are extra features such as a gag reel and a featurette with Chuck Lorre and another producer. Jake is growing up too with a crush on a girl named Wendy Cho at school.

The fourth season has four DVDs and a booklet with every episode summary. I always watching the series even in repeats or running syndication. I used to enjoy watching it for an hour every night until they replaced it with another series. I enjoy the raunchy humor. Surprisingly the series did well with the elderly population according to the show's creators. There was something smart and witty in every episode.",1525478400,,1635,5.119850187265918
