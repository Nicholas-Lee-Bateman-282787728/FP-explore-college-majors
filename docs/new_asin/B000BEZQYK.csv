8085803,2,B000BEZQYK,"If my memory serves, I saw this on one of the local Spanish language television stations in 1991 or 1992. It seemed like an attempt to cash in on ""Lethal Weapon,"" with a ""masked man"" (he initially wears a motorcycle helmet--for no apparent reason) who comes to the aid of a damsel in distress. (I can't remember why the mob wants her dead, but they do, and luckily Cuervo is there to save her.) It's bottom-of-the-barrel low budget, and there are continuity errors galore, but I actually had fun watching it in an Ed Wood sort of way.",1459468800,,534,4.459183673469388
