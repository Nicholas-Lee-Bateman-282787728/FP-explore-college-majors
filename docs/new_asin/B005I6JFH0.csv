8474310,4,B005I6JFH0,"Old footage. However,as a student of ""old school"" I found it really interesting and well worth the money. As a karate practitioner I think it is my responsibility to study and absorb as much of the origins as I can find. I know I'm certainly not alone in that. Therefore, if research is your thing,this is a good buy. Even if you only find one or two items of interest in it. Just be prepared. It's not HD or anything approaching that. Some of the footage is quite time worn.",1444435200,,475,4.288888888888889
8474311,4,B005I6JFH0,It was what I expected I studied with Mr. Odo and this was a good review for me. Liked the DVD and the way it was made,1362960000,,118,3.4074074074074074
8474312,3,B005I6JFH0,"Was a bit disappointed in that I already had the recordings on this DVD, but I had gotten the same recordings as a VHS tape quite a few years ago. There was no mention that it was a release of the same items. Since I had not transferred that tape to digital format, I rationalized the purchase as being okay. I never got to see Odo in person having started my study about a year after his final US visit about 18 months before his death. It's too bad that there are not earlier recordings when he was younger.",1357776000,,509,4.151515151515151
8474313,1,B005I6JFH0,"I have been waiting for someone to put together a set of tapes on the different Okinawan Masters but so far the tapes are very disapointing. Most of the ones that I have recieved skip or don't do anything.
The one I am reviewing here on Master Seikichi Odo is a total waist. It plays for about 3 minutes and completely stops. I have tried cleaning, but nothing works.
Be very careful with this series of videos!",1355097600,,411,4.35064935064935
