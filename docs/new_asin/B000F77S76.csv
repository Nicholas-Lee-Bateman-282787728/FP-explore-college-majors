I saw it on cable years ago and recently wanted to see it again.  Now I can watch it whenever I like since the DVD will live on my wall.",1407456000,,273,3.8214285714285716
8118466,5,B000F77S76,"The humor is side splitting. For a long time, I haven't laughed so much while watching a movie.

The acting of both main actor and actress  is gripping. The character development of the main actor is interesting.

The kung fu fighting scenes are some of the best that Ive seen. Theyre exciting and suspenseful, especially the last scene.

In short, its one  of the BEST that my MONEY can GET in terms of Korean movies.",1382918400,,418,4.52
8118467,4,B000F77S76,"Nerdy rookie policeman Sang-hwan, in pursuing a purse-snatcher who drives a motorcycle, ends up badly hurt. He's taken by the woman martial artist, who has caught the purse-snatcher, to be revived and healed by the Five Masters ... who recognizes, in Sang-hwan, the most powerful of chi - the makings of a genuine warrior. As they groom Sang-hwan (still a nerd) to become a legend, an outcast Master returns to modern-day Seoul to - among other things - enact his revenge on the Five Masters who used to be his comrades. Funny, exciting, and with great fight scenes (especially at the end), the film works largely due to the great performance of Seung-beom Ryu as Sang-hwan.",1356998400,,674,4.818965517241379
8118468,4,B000F77S76,I deducted a star for the drawn-out climax.  Fans of Steven Chow are in for a treat.  Korean movies always provide peerless acting with humor and subtlety of plot.  The basic storyline falls under the Novice to Master category. The English translation is solid (I do not speak Korean).  Best viewed with Korean dialogue subtitled.,1352937600,,330,4.945454545454545

Note:  The main character is one UGLY dude but the leading actress is cute.",1338508800,,209,4.447368421052632

8118471,4,B000F77S76,"Let me start out by saying that I am fully on board with Korean movies now.  Between the Vengeance Trilogy, City of Violence, The Host, Guns and Talks, and Arahan, Korea has shown they can do all the genre's really, really well.  They very much have their own style and feel that is unique in the international film world.  Glad I finally figured it out.

First off, Arahan comes to us from the same director/star of City of Violence.  You can expect the same well-choreographed and stylish action, all captured with a slick visual style.  Engaging characters are another trademark you'll run across in this film.  Only here, the mood is lighter than COV and there are quite a few genuine laugh-out-loud moments.  I was really surprised how many times I heard myself cracking up.

Anyways, the story is similar to that of the Matrix except for the fact that these people are funny and don't take themselves so seriously as opposed to chewing up the dialogue with psych 101 teachings.  Plus, this entire cast has some serious martial arts chops, none of them learned everything in the few months preceding principal photography (a side note: I love the Matrix, just trying to make distinctions.  Matrix is a 5-star in my book).  Also, the story takes place in modern day Korea, not the internets.  But it's about a  boy finding his untapped potential with the help of a hot chick and some ""masters"" that must fight their own Mr. Smith.  You get the point.

The story, although not anything complicated, is fun and quite entertaining.  The true gem of this film is the character interaction.  The comedy is genuinely funny.  The love/hate relationship between the male and female leads is brilliantly done.  The interplay between all the characters it really a treat.

And that more than makes up for the fact that the first half is light on action.  This director tends to backload his films with action because he wants to draw you in and get you invested in the characters during hour one. . .and it works.  Understand though, once he turns it on, it doesn't stop.  The second hour is one great sequence after another.  It's mostly all live, with some wire-fu and CGI spots.  All three elements are exceptionally well-balanced.  He doesn't over-rely on CG or Wire to make up for any deficiencies in skill or creativity.  It's fast, graceful, creative. . .these are phenomenal fight scenes.

Lastly, the contemporary setting adds a nice element.  Watching people hop from skyscraper to skyscraper while the regular folk go about their business below is very creative.  While the story is normal, the outstanding action and great three-dimensional characters (and their funny and caring interplay), along with some new perspectives on things, really make this a stand-out in the martial arts film genre.  Like my business partner always says, ""I'm not trying to reinvent the wheel.  I'm just trying to put a new rim on it.""",1217116800,2,2922,4.814889336016097
8118472,5,B000F77S76,"This movie is fun to watch. There is a good mix of comedy and action. This is a lighthearted movie, don't expect your typical Korean melodrama. The actors are great and the special effects are awesome.

The story is basically about a weakling young cop who discovers his inner martial arts powers. It's hilarious what he goes through. He then battles a powerful enemy who has awakened after years of being sealed away.

The action is pretty good too. In the world of this movie people can use their ""chi"" to perform superhuman feats and moves. Lots of CGI stuff and some wire effects. Sword fighting and chi attacks lifting objects and throwing them Darth Vader style.

If you like Asian movies you'd probably like this one too.",1189036800,10,728,4.671875
8118473,4,B000F77S76,"Review: ARAHAN Urban Martial Arts Action- At first glance, some people can be reminded of Stephen Chow's KUNG FU HUSTLE, this Korean installment can hold its own. This is a comic adventure/fantasy in the similar vein as Stephen Chow's classic, but believe me when I say ARAHAN can stand on its own.

The story is about a goofy cop named Sang Hwan. Although he can be deemed as incompetent by his superiors, he is honest and has a good heart. You might even say he is too good for his own good. Anyway, upon chasing a purse snatcher, he crosses paths with the beautiful Eui-jin(beautiful So-yi Yoon)who is a training martial arts/tao apprentice who accidentally hits him while pursuing the same snatcher. Sang-hwan is revived by the remaining 5 Chi masters who unlocks all of Sang's chi flow. It was quite entertaining to see him go around trying to control this new found abilities. After Sang Hwan gets beat up by thugs in a club, he decides to join the 5 masters in training.

One of the masters holds the key to enlightenment, and this is where the story really takes off when an exiled evil lost master is set free by a bunch of innocent subway workers. The key in defeating lies within Sang Hwan--but can he achieve the state of Arahan and become the next Maruchi to save reality from chaos?

The opening wherein the masters are discussing the difficulty in training as well their statement that some people reach master level without even knowing it is a nice touch.

The film is very entertaining, although you are reminded of KUNG FU HUSTLE and BULLETPROOF MONK. The action makes use of wires, but take my word for it, the EFX are nicely done. You can just watch this film for the action if nothing else. The characters are well rounded and they grow on you. The villain is evil enough so it doesn't get boring.

Directed by known action director Ryoo Seung-Wan(Crying Fist), the fight scenes may make use of some wires and CGI. However, the director didn't lose respect for ""old school"" martial arts and he makes good use of his knowledge. Arahan has solid commercial appeal and although, it may have the usual cliches in martial arts movies, the movie is solid with its hard-hitting fight sequences and humorous moments.
The casts' performance is decent, and the audience can actually witness the improvement in martial arts prowess throughout the length of the film until they get better and better. Newcomer cutie So-yi Woon(Shadowless Sword) fills the screen with her charisma. The development of the 7 masters are interesting but we don't get to see too much of them.

I have the Korean 3-disc region-3 release that comes with a poster, postcards and a CD soundtrack. Packaged in a wooden box, the presentation is exceptional.
PICTURE/AUDIO: 1.78 Anamorphic widescreen. The picture is very sharp and clean. Colors have that softer touch but it fits the film. Blacks are solid and detailed. The Korean DTS-ES track is very powerful. Subtitles are very good.
EXTRAS:Making of/ training/commentary

In Closing:
This film is worth a look if you like great hard-hitting martial arts action with a touch of humor. Though a lot of people may consider KUNG FU HUSTLE is superior, it is whole lot better than most action films and can definitely stand on its own. It is definitely one of best to come from South Korea.

Recommended!!(a solid 4 stars)",1154476800,13,3355,4.752577319587629
