4187884,4,B003SDDFYO,I'm pretty excited about this DVD. I'm a long time Kids In The Hall fan and am really glad that they still get back together every now and then to produce new projects. I watched part of this on IFC before my DVR crashed and ate the rest of the series I had recorded. How nice that I am able to buy the DVD and see the rest. There are countless shows from my childhood I wish I could do that with!,1295308800,2,397,3.8536585365853657
4187885,5,B003SDDFYO,"I've been a huge Kids in the Hall fan for many years and was thrilled to see them come out with a new show. In fine KITH style, their wit, timing, and outrageous humor didn't fail! Excellent, fun, irreverent show and highly recommended.",1289347200,,236,4.511627906976744
4187886,5,B003SDDFYO,"If you like the Kids in the Hall you'll love Death Comes to Town. If you don't like the kids, well thats your own tough luck. Showing that they still have it after almost 20 years since the end of their series the kids perform what could be called one LONG sketch about murder in a small town and all the eccentric characters that this murder affects. A must see for any Kids fan.",1288051200,3,380,4.148648648648648
4187887,5,B003SDDFYO,"I first saw this series on IFC and couldn't stop laughing!  So creative and very clever, and the cast of characters are so totally convincing, even though they are played by the ""kids"" (guys, who play multiple characters). The comedy keeps coming at you in the most unexpected ways, and from all angles.  You really never know what is going to happen next. I am so glad this is available for purchase - I can enjoy it over and over again!",1284249600,,438,4.395061728395062
4187888,5,B003SDDFYO,"I caught some of this series on the CBC in the spring and thought it was very funny.  When the DVD was released in Canada, I just had to get it, even though it meant purchasing outside of Amazon.  If you liked the old Kids in the Hall TV series, you will love this.  While the ""Kids"" may not be young anymore (I'm guessing they are all in their 40s or maybe even 50s), they still have genius comic timing and great writing.  They play most of the roles in this 8-part mini-series themselves, both male and female roles (even though they are all men).  The series is a ""murder mystery"" of sorts -- the mayor of a small Canadian town is murdered, and the series revolves around finding the murderer, in hilarious fashion.  Quirky small-town characters abound.  My favorite is Dave Foley as the mayor's perpetually tipsy widow (watch for the garbage disposal margaritas and the ""power shake"" martinis).  And for fans of the old KITH series, there is even a cameo by the Chicken Lady as a potential juror in the murder trial.  How funny is that?!  I know I will watch this series again and again and will never stop laughing.  What higher praise can I give?",1283904000,15,1153,4.442857142857143
4187889,5,B003SDDFYO,"totally recommend Death comes to town!!
saw the first two episodes on IFC and i cant stop watching them over and over
Mark Mckinney as ""Death: is consummate Perfection
ENJOY!!",1282435200,3,175,4.866666666666666
4187890,5,B003SDDFYO,"I love Kids In The Hall & didn't know anything about this show.
But now I am holding it & love the hell out of it.",1443139200,,114,3.423076923076923
4187891,5,B003SDDFYO,"Great mini series.  Classic KITH characters with refreshing takes on pop culture.  Watched it three times already, tend to catch something new every time.",1436140800,,154,5.375
4187892,2,B003SDDFYO,"Goodness...where do I start? I'm a huge ""kith"" fan from way back and just recently was lucky enough to see them at the HardRock Orlando(only 10 US cities were on their tour).  I didn't read the bad reviews before buying this and wanted to view something I hadn't seen to get my psyched for their upcoming performance. I hate to say, but this was kinda awful. I don't know if you can return things like this, but in any case I will keep it just to watch the Dave Foley parts. He really has aged into an attractive ""older woman."" I think all the ""kids"" are hugely talented&my favorite kid has to be Scott Thompson; but this was thoroughly dreadful, and not in a good way. I hate having to leave such a terrible review for a comedy troupe that is near and dear to my heart, but like a reviewer mentioned; it was like they edited out all the funny parts and then released the movie. Brain Candy was a lot better than this one. I was hoping this one woulda been better than Brain Candy.",1435190400,,981,4.245989304812834
4187893,5,B003SDDFYO,Loved it,1426809600,,8,3.5
4187894,4,B003SDDFYO,Perfect for long time fans that want more!,1423612800,,42,4.375
4187895,3,B003SDDFYO,It just OK nothing great some funny moments. Might of been better if they did it as a TV movie instead of a mini series.,1422057600,,120,3.84
4187896,5,B003SDDFYO,Love it!,1418774400,,8,3.5
4187897,5,B003SDDFYO,"In my opinion this is the best work The Kids in the Hall have done, admitting to not generally caring for the group in general.",1417910400,,127,4.12
4187898,5,B003SDDFYO,KITH are so funny and they don't disappoint with Death Comes to Town. I laughed from beginning to end.,1414022400,,102,4.421052631578948
4187899,1,B003SDDFYO,"I don't know how anyone could like this.  I'm a huge Kids in the Hall fan.  I loved the original series, as well as Brain Candy.

The only way I can describe it is that they made a very funny movie, then edited out every scene that was not funny whatsoever, took the worst of that unfunny stuff, and made a movie out of it.  It was really that bad.",1412294400,,348,3.9285714285714284
4187900,5,B003SDDFYO,Fun and hilarious!!! I can never get enough KITH!,1410393600,,49,4.555555555555555
4187901,5,B003SDDFYO,Loved it!,1407196800,,9,4.0
4187902,5,B003SDDFYO,I Saw this on tv one time and look it up and seen it was on dvd so i got it i love this tv show its not for everyone but it is funny as hell to me,1398816000,,146,2.8684210526315788
4187903,4,B003SDDFYO,"Got this three days ago and have watched it three times. It was so fun to see some new Kids in the Hall characters that were equally as bizarre as some of the old favorites. The entire story line is great - totally moves from epidsode to episode, with a few twists and turns, and then reveals all the secrets. It is a bit raunchy, but as I watched, it made me recall that the original KITH were pretty raunchy at times. But always clever. And that every Kid is playing 3 to 4 characters is truly amazing. You know it, but they do that so well. I think the only reason I'm giving it four stars and not five is that I wished it were longer.",1393804800,,638,4.031496062992126
4187904,4,B003SDDFYO,The Kids haven't lost a step.  This is bizarre and hilarious like all of their classic output.  Each member shines in multiple rolls.  I laughed quite hard through most of it.,1388793600,,175,4.580645161290323
4187905,5,B003SDDFYO,"This is one of the best series that people haven't heard of.  Not advertised at all in the states except for IFC, this is one to own.",1381104000,,133,3.925925925925926
4187906,5,B003SDDFYO,Great DVD for any Kids in the Hall fan. I would recommend this to any one who want to laugh.,1377043200,,92,3.65
4187907,4,B003SDDFYO,"If you're a fan of Kids in the Hall already, you will love this. It's not their best work, but it's still got plenty of hilarious moments and characters (the mortician is by far my favorite). There are also some appearances by some beloved characters from KITH's past that are pretty good. The comedy in this is a bit more of a slow build-up than in the shows or in ""Brain Candy"", as the lads had more space to develop things. AS a result, it does lag from time to time, but not for long. The end result is a funny reunion of the second best comedy troupe of all time that was definitely worth the price. If you're an old fan, this will be completely enjoyable. If you're a new fan or just getting started with KITH, I would recommend either ""Brain Candy"" or better yet, watch the old tv series.",1364774400,2,795,4.2368421052631575
4187908,3,B003SDDFYO,"i purchased this based on the running time listed at 500 minutes,in fact the running time is less than 180 minutes.please change the listed running time so the product is not misrepresented to other customers.",1360022400,,209,5.0
4187909,5,B003SDDFYO,"If you loved Kids in the Hall on TV then you cannot miss this. More ridiculous antics, hilarious characters, and a story that makes you wince and laugh hysterically. So glad I got this movie!",1357516800,3,191,4.485714285714286
4187910,5,B003SDDFYO,"Death really is an awesome show, I watched it when it came out on IFC and taped it. Sadly my dvr screwed up and couldn't rewatch it. The Kids play their parts well and minus the cops in town and a surprise juror, everything is fresh and new. I highly recommend watching it if you can and getting this on tv dvd is a must.",1356652800,,321,3.953846153846154
4187911,5,B003SDDFYO,"If you are a fan, this is great.  She has all their movies and continues to enjoy all of them year after year.",1356393600,3,110,3.782608695652174
4187912,5,B003SDDFYO,"What a fantastic and fun mini-series(!)  This is KITH in top form!!!  I recommend this to anyone interested in an interesting and entertaining little story.  I appreciate that all 5 original KIDS take part!!  Again . . . I recommend this!  I sincerely think they've still got it (even after America's influence on all of their careers.)  Time well spent, money well spent!!  Thanks - pick this up.  As well, it was delivered in 'new' condition and in prompt timing!!",1335139200,,466,4.7375
4187913,4,B003SDDFYO,"Almost a lifelong KITH fan. When I heard that they were doing a new project together, I was extremely excited. And worried. I wasn't a huge fan of Brain Candy, and was partially expecting something along those lines. I think the format here serves the material well. Comparing the show and this mini-series is comparing apples and oranges, but they really nailed it.",1331424000,3,366,4.825396825396825
4187914,5,B003SDDFYO,"If you're a fan of the original, you'll more than likely approve of this. It's not as good as the original series, but at worst it is entertaining, and sometimes will have you laughing out loud.",1328486400,2,194,4.416666666666667
4187915,4,B003SDDFYO,"Much of my enjoyment of the series was simply the novelty of getting to see my beloved Kids on the screen again. The series is definitely funny, but there aren't a lot of laugh-out-loud moments.  Most of the humor comes from the characterization, which develops over multiple episodes.

Sadly, only 3 of the 8 episodes have commentaries, with the other special features being an outtakes reel and deleted scenes (no Making Of featurettes or anything).

If you like The Kids in the Hall, you'll enjoy the characters they play in Death Comes To Town. But don't expect any genre-blowing comedy; it's good, not great.",1326412800,,613,4.875
4187916,5,B003SDDFYO,"If you like smart and edgy, or at least the TV show ""Dead Like Me""

you'll love this.

It's like Dead Like Me, but seen from the POV of a natural causes reaper working on the bad side.

It's a send up of small town, family secrets, big city stock characters and is uplifting for those of us who've retreated from life, in that even being a shut in doesn't mean you can't interact with the outside world.",1319414400,3,403,4.141025641025641
4187917,5,B003SDDFYO,"As a fan of their earlier work, I was excited to see this DVD on my 'recommendations' page.  It was HILARIOUS!  My husband and I absolutely loved every episode. I can't adequately describe how talented these guys are at writing such outstanding comedy. I think I actually laughed harder at these episodes then at their earlier works.  Time has only made them even better.

I highly recommend this to anyone who is a Kids in the Hall fan.",1314921600,11,437,4.564102564102564
4187918,5,B003SDDFYO,"I never watched any of the Kids In The Hall before seeing this on CBC, and I loved it! I am looking forward to sitting down and watching it all over again.",1314576000,,155,3.875
4187919,5,B003SDDFYO,I had read that the other release of this show had video quality issues and just wanted to state that this releases video quality is perfect.,1306108800,7,141,4.461538461538462
8404160,4,B003SDDFYO,"If you like the Kids in the Hall, and you tried to like Twin Peaks but couldn't, this might be the perfect combo for you.

It took about 2 or 3 episodes to get adjusted to the new storytelling style, but after that I found it ridiculous and hilarious. The Kids play all of their characters really well and Its definitely weird, but worth a watch for any fan.",1515024000,,358,4.188405797101449

8404167,1,B003SDDFYO,"Comon guys! Really?! I've been a fan of Kith since I was a kid. They changed my life. I thought Brain Candy was bad, oh boy, Death Comes to Town takes the cake. I didn't laugh once and by the end of the series I was completely depressed. Such a let down. Total face palm.",1459641600,,271,3.9454545454545453
8404168,5,B003SDDFYO,"Wonderful and funny -- a must-own for any KITH fan!  Had a long weekend away and enjoyed this in the evenings between long walks in the woods.  Great characters, a return to the brilliance of what these were before the split.",1453939200,,225,4.463414634146342
8404169,2,B003SDDFYO,"I have watched about 3/4 of the episodes and I am not impressed.  I loved the Kids in the Hall, but this is not on the same level.  It seems to depend on weird costumes and characters, but the dialogue is short on laughs.  Would I buy this again?  Probably not.",1444003200,,261,4.0588235294117645
