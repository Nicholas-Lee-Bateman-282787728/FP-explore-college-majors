4663459,5,B005E7AODW,"Remember Robert Opel?
  Of course you do.
  He was the man who streaked across the stage during the 46th Annual Oscar telecast back in 1974. His nephew, also named Robert Oppel (the uncle later dropped a ""p;"" no intended?), has made an uneven, but fascinating, documentary about the Man Behind the Bareass, Uncle Bob (Breaking Glass Pictures).
  The film is much more than a rehash of that famous night. And it proves that David Niven's quip about ""shortcomings"" should be hung on the fallacy list. No wonder Liz taylor tittered.
  Opel was a die-hard gay activist and photographer---causing commotion and frequent public indecency for the cause during its early San Francisco daze---when he wasn't running an art gallery that exhibited all kinds of odd art.
  Uncle Bob had balls.
  So does Uncle Bob.
  The film is sprinkled with famous names and faces (including a nifty vintage interview of Opel interviewing Divine) and archival footage of such icons as John Waters and Mike Douglas, who winds up one of his shows singing to Opel in a bit that's campy, corny and oh-so-very watchable.
  Oppel goes so far as to become his uncle; some of the gimmicks he uses work, some do not. And pity those who think ""watersports"" are activities played during a cruise ship's stop-over in Bermuda.
  Opel was murdered in 1979, and the film offers more questions than answers, painting a questionable portrait of our ""legal"" system: The man accused of Opel's murder was/is willing to speak with the filmmaker yet prison officials refuse. Again and again.",1319500800,12,1543,4.9147286821705425

4663476,2,B005E7AODW,"In the hands of a more experienced documentary filmmaker, this might have made for a decent short film.  The subject matter just isn't compelling enough to construct a feature lenght narrative around. Instead, the filmmaker piggybacks onto other figures of the time (Harvey Milk, Anita Bryant, Divine, et at) both to give his film and its subject matter a heightened sense of importance.

That alone would at least make the film interesting enough to sit through (and should have provided enough material to fill out the scant 80 min running time).  Instead, Oppel sloppily re-enacts moments from his uncle's life and events going on at the time (ostensibly to save on footage? I can only assume, since every time they cut away to a ""photo"" of Robert Mapplethorpe, it was a stand-in with a huge RE-ENACTMENT stamped across it for a split second).

Even worse, Oppel hasn't even hired real actors for these segments.  He himself plays his uncle and a mix of friends and what I am assuming are people he pulled in off the streets play the other characters, the result being sub-elementary school play quality.  These pieces are an absolute chore to sit through, they offer NOTHING of value to the story and I would guess that if you removed them all, you might find the film had been cut in half.

The film isn't a total waste of time.  it has a lot of fascinating archival footage, some extremely rare, so that alone makes it worth viewing.  Just do it with the fast forward button very close by.",1394928000,,1495,4.675572519083969

4663478,5,B005E7AODW,"Uncle Bob is a highly charged collection of interviews from radical artists and activist who fought the sexual revolution against the so-called liberal establishment in San Francisco & nationally.

Uncle Bob was murdered by the establishment that killed Mayor George Moscone & Supervisor Harvey Milk. Fortunately his equally talented nephew Robert Opell discovered his roots, his passion for life, truth, & activism with probing artistic expressions in this film.

Uncle Bob, shows how we all have a chance & the ability to stand & make dramatic marks on a country that has lost its way drenched in corporatism & blood.

Take off your clothes and go for a walk...! Wake citizens up...!",1324252800,5,685,5.098214285714286
4663479,1,B005E7AODW,"Does the name ""Robert Opel"" ring a bell?  Not surprising if it doesn't, since his ""15 minutes of fame"" was back in 1974.  That was the year he became an instant media darling, after having streaked naked across the stage at that year's Academy Award televised ceremony.  An early scene in the documentary shows him being interviewed on the Mike Douglas Show, sitting next to Mike's other guests Elizabeth Taylor and Bea Arthur.  Strange company, indeed.

So, why a film 38 years later?  His nephew (and namesake) Robert Oppel (the original streaker dropped one of the letters in his last name) decided to do a film documenting his rather colorful life over the following five years, until his murder in 1979.  He brings out old footage, creates reenactments of other footage, and interviews those who knew him well. Opel went on to be a gay activist, an advocate for sexual expression, and owner of a rather eclectic San Francisco gallery that supported those other endeavors. In covering that era, the film also provides a look at the overall look at San Francisco arts and politics of the time, up to the murder of City Supervisor Harvey Milk, and the gay community's reaction to the light sentence given to his admitted killer.

The filmmaker's main concentration is on painting the prevailing attitude of San Francisco police as rather homophobic, to the point where they - at best - did not adequately investigate or prosecute those responsible for Opel's shooting in his gallery, in a reported robbery. At worst, it is hinted that the police may have had even a role in Opel's murder, and perhaps Milk's as well.

Overall, it is a rather murky and disjointed 80 minutes of film, which I feel would only really be appreciated by those with an interest in the specifics of the period and its challenges in San Francisco.  Would be rated R for abundant frontal nudity, and some simulated sex. I give it just one star out of five.",1320710400,3,1932,4.740298507462686

The movie itself is kind of crap film making like most porno films are. Just showing body parts as much as possible. I couldn't even see a point to it. I only watched it part way through.
