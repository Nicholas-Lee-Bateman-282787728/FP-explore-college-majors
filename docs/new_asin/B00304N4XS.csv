8385474,5,B00304N4XS,"If you know about anime this is a GREAT one! I had seen a clip of this one 10-12 tears ago (at a reccacon). I looked in stores for it but no one had it. Till I found it here. If you love cute story lines this is one you will love! I love buying as they say... a pig in a poke, cause this poke didn't let me down!",1347580800,,312,3.4714285714285715
8385475,1,B00304N4XS,"I purchased this anime, and it was put out by a Malaysian company, which was fine, but the English subtitles are SO AWFUL, that it's incomprehensible!! Plus, there is advertisements from Japan in it as well, so I guess that would make this something of a bootleg, even though the packaging was really nice. But I couldn't understand the subtitles at all. Avoid this one until it's fixed!",1343174400,,387,4.705882352941177
8385476,5,B00304N4XS,"This is a very good anime one of my many favorites, its a bit serious in parts, a little sad as well but theres fun too and its well worth watching.
I started watching this series 1 at a time an it became addictive, i just had to see the next episode sometimes i'd wait a bit but i just kept coming back.
I almost want to call this a soap opera its a lot diferent from my normal anime like Tenchi, Photon, ect.

As the review says the main character is sort of a high school play boy an then he ends up having to take care of a little girl which brings him, the little girl, and a girl he likes closer together slowly, with some twists and turns along the way.

i'd recomend this its a good anime as long as you don't mind the seriousness and sadness here an there its well worth the watching.",1276992000,,793,3.981132075471698
