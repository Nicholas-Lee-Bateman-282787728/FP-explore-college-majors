8447427,5,B000L3A17I,"David Cole's film is essential viewing for anyone seeking to understand why revisionists question the standard story of the ""Holocaust,"" but since the original version of this film runs for 61 minutes, and this one is only 50 minutes, I can't recommend the purchase of this version. If 11 minutes of footage have been deleted, the film has probably been seriously compromised.

I first saw this film on Google Video, and was amazed by its revelations. Being Jewish, and wearing his yarmulke, Cole was able to visit Auschwitz and ask questions that would have had other researchers kicked out.

Visiting the ""homicidal gas chamber,"" David asks his guide (Alicia) whether any alterations have been made to the ""chamber"" since the Germans left, particularly referring to 4 short, lidded ""chimneys"" through which the lethal Zyklon B was supposed to have been poured. Alicia says that no changes have been made and the ""chamber"" is in its original state, which is what visitors to Auschwitz were routinely told at that time. After more questions from David, she gets a senior guide to assist who reveals that the ""chimneys"" were added by Polish authorities AFTER the war. David later speaks to Doctor Franciszek Piper, curator of the Auschwitz Museum, who admits that the ""gas chamber"" was an air raid shelter at the end of the war which was converted by removing walls and adding the ""chimneys."" By way of explanation, Piper claims that the air raid shelter had been a homicidal gas chamber, from the autumn of 1941 until December 1942, and the alterations ""reconstructed"" what had once been there.

In conclusion, David gives his reasons for believing that no one was gassed at Auschwitz, and points to the history of questionable propaganda in this area including ""Nazi hunter"" Simon Wiesenthal's written account of ""soap made from Jewish bodies"" (Wiesenthal said the boxes bore the initials R.I.F. which stood for ""pure Jewish fat"").

 He also discusses the Katyn Massacre, where about fifteen thousand Polish officers were murdered by the Soviets. At the Nuremberg Tribunal, the Soviets accused the Germans of having committed this crime, and produced the required ""evidence."" Earlier they had publicly hanged several captured German officers at Leningrad for supposed involvement in Katyn (see; page 157,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nuremberg-The-Last-Battle/dp/1872197167/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nuremberg: The Last Battle</a>&nbsp;by David Irving). The British, and American, prosecutors and judges at Nuremberg knew the truth about Katyn but kept silent for obvious reasons. The lie was put to rest when the Soviet government publicly acknowledged in the late 1980s that the Katyn Massacre was committed by the Soviet NKVD.

After making this film David became the focus of an intimidation campaign by the Jewish Defence League led, at the time, by Irv Rubin who would later die in prison after being charged with conspiring to bomb a Californian Mosque, and the office of Arab-American congressman Darrell Issa, among other targets. In 1992, while attending a meeting at the University of California, David was viciously assaulted by members of the JDL and left with facial injuries. Rubin attempted to push him down a flight of stairs.

As the film became better known, the harassment got worse. In 1997 an ""essay"" with statements including the following appeared on JDL's website:

""What is David Cole? Is it a sickness? Is it a mental disease? Is Cole merely a human parasite who clings to his ardent Nazi supporters and friends who back his ideas wholeheartedly? After all this Cole mania that the media have played on, don't you think it's time we flush this rotten, sick individual down the toilet where the rest of the waste lies? One less David Cole in the world will certainly not end Jew-hatred, but it will have removed a dangerous, parasitic, disease-ridden bacteria from infecting society.""

""Just as we must get rid of this monster, Cole, we must also get rid of the word ""revisionism"" from our vocabulary. This awful word and Cole, too, must be eliminated altogether. There is no argument. There needs to be no more debates, only the elimination of Holocaust deniers...""

""An evil monster like this does not deserve to live on this earth. All the news stories about his life only encourage Cole to feed his sick ego even more, bringing attention to his depraved lifestyle. Cole is an abominable psychopath who must be stopped.""

Beneath the ""essay"" was a ""Reward for Information"": ""JDL wants to know the location of Holocaust denier David Cole, pictured above. Anyone giving us his correct address will receive a monetary reward. Contact us through email immediately if you have information leading to the current location of David Cole.""

By this time David was living in hiding. Soon after, he signed a long statement for distribution by Irv Rubin repudiating his film and apologising for making it. Rubin triumphantly announced that David had given him two hundred dollars to help remove the film from circulation.
