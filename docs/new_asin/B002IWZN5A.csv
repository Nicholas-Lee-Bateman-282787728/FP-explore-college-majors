3937528,5,B002IWZN5A,I really enjoyed this DVD. It's easy to follow and offers great techniques that you can incorporate into your massage routine. I am always researching for new modalities. Thai is a great addition to offer clients besides the normal Swedish and Deep Tissue massage.,1398643200,,264,5.0227272727272725

8371248,5,B002IWZN5A,I have alway given massage to my family and friends for the past 4 years after my wife developed some issue with her back and I could afford to send her to the massage therapist every other day.  I never charged anyone but I have has become so requested that I desisted that I could makes so money at this. I have a table and I got a few books and some videos for training so I could bone up on some skills if I was going to charge.  After a month of research I believe this version and the others from the same company have been the best resource that I have found.  I have a good client base now that pay and I have to turn people down every week because I just don't have the time. This is a great video that will help you learn those few tricks that really make the difference.,1473724800,,781,3.961783439490446

8371252,5,B002IWZN5A,"Free video in exchange for this 5-star review. I feel pretty bad giving this rating since I've never actually seen this video. If this video is anywhere near as brilliant as the marketing ploy that got me to write this review then I can hardly wait to watch.

8371254,5,B002IWZN5A,Dr. James had a very nice approach in his teachings.  I especially like the simple controlled methods that I find to be very effective in treating a client.  He also does a very nice job of not rushing through his routines so that it is very easy for even a novice to follow even if they do not fully understand the physics of what they are doing.  As a therapist this gives me ideas of new moves to incorporate in my massages.  I look forward to see more videos from Dr. James.,1398729600,,478,4.163043478260869
