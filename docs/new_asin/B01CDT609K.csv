7673457,4,B01CDT609K,"This is an uncomfortable story. It is about people who survived World War 2.
A movie to remember what man has done to his fellow man, is essential,
especially today, where it appears hatred is again spreading across the world.
A dramatic, moving piece, with several actors and actresses in it whom are seasoned
and deliver the flawed and imperfect human qualities to the story.
They give amazing performances.",1462233600,12,409,4.942028985507246
7673458,3,B01CDT609K,"Zev Guttman (Christopher Plummer) and Max Rosenbaum (Martin Landau) are a pair of Holocaust survivors who plan to exact revenge from the Nazi who played a key role in the extermination of their families at Auschwitz.  Unfortunately, Zev and Max face daunting obstacles that, under normal circumstances, would prove insurmountable:  Max is wheelchair-bound and too ill to leave his oxygen supply; ninety-year-old Zev suffers from dementia.  Both live  in a facility where, presumably, the staff keeps an eye on what they do and where they go.

Director Atom Egoyan and screenwriter Benjamin August gloss over these and other improbabilities in ""Remember,"" a road picture that has elements of humor--whether intentional or not is up to the individual viewer to decide.  The filmmakers would have us believe that Zev, equipped with a stash of money and detailed written instructions provided by Max, would be able to navigate by bus and taxi from New York to cities across the country and Canada.  Zev's mission is to find one of four men, all of whom are named Rudy Kurlander.  Max hopes that when when his friend locates the correct Rudy, he will recognize his enemy on sight and kill him.

Off goes the frail nonagenarian, with little more than a vague understanding of what he is meant to accomplish.  Plummer's impressive acting saves the film from complete absurdity. Thanks to him, we grow to care about this lost and confused soul who is emotionally drained and barely able to function. The implausibilities multiply as the movie progresses, and the proceedings conclude with a shocking twist that some, but not all viewers, will see coming.  ""Remember,"" in spite of Plummer's evocative portrayal, is too far-fetched and exploitative to rate more than a marginal recommendation.",1461715200,3,1783,5.113793103448276
7673459,5,B01CDT609K,"Atom Egoyan (One of my personal favorite directors), made a mesrmerizing, intriguing and first-rate tension motion picture. A very old man (Chris Plummer) suffers of Altzheimer. He receives clear instructions, in order to put on order certain disajudments of a dark past. And -at the end- he really will confront himself.

Brilliant script, memorable photography and superb edition process, a film that will keep you hold to your seat. Fascinating all the way through.

PD Just a question. Why wasn't Chris Plummer nominated as Best Actor in a leading role for this one?",1460937600,15,570,5.118279569892473

7673461,5,B01CDT609K,"No need to repeat the plot; others have stated it quite well. An excellent movie, keeps you on the edge of your seat. Christopher Plummer is, of course, excellent. I just saw this marvelous film in Aix-en-Provence, France, and the theater was full of French speakers, even though the movie is in English. (The French sub-titles leave out the F words, a totally unnecessary addition.)  But, I don't think the movie has been shown in the US, or at least not in Pittsburgh. We send the Canadians so much of our garbage and ignore the many excellent movies and TV shows they produce, it's a mystery. In any case, if you can't see the movie in a theater, at least watch the DVD.",1459641600,5,673,4.471544715447155
7673462,5,B01CDT609K,"Zev Gutman (Christopher Plummer) lives along with his friend, Max Rosenbaum (Martin Landau), in an older-aged assisted living facility. These men happen to be the last two still living that had been from a block within the notoriously malevolent German concentration camp of Auschwitz. Max and Zev have shared their indelibly personal stories while in the facility which obviously proves that they were each there.

While Max is wheelchair bound, Zev remains ambulatory, although, he suffers from progressive dementia including many of the confusing symptoms. His illness is to a degree of advancement that he must be reminded constantly that his wife has passed away just about two weeks earlier. With her now gone, we understand that a plan has been made, arranged, and financed ahead of time by Max for Zev to go out into the world to find the one remaining German officer from Auschwitz who took the lives of their families. Telling anymore of the storyline, but for the basic plot, would spoil the whole elaborate and genius tale of Zev being on the hunt for that certain vile person

What I found so difficult, at first, and equally compelling for Zev to accomplish with dementia, was trying to understand how he could even assume the responsibility of the journey itself; therein lies the brilliant telling of Zevs tale. He does have the instructions from Max, but does he even have the cognizance to use them? His story begins less menacing in its tone along with the adorable children and considerately helpful people. I did catch a vague glimpse of humor, but don't be fooled, this became quite dark and on the edge of your seat suspenseful for me. I don't believe there is a scene that Christopher Plummer is not in or does not completely make his own while portraying Zev in Remember. This is suspense filled drama at its finest with the necessary cringe worthy effects added in; artifacts, a frightening barking dog that has an interesting name, fearful traveling, many faces and many places for a man with dementia to navigate. You could say I white-knuckled my way through this film and you would be right.

It is said that sound and music are the last to leave a memory and Zev proves this time and again as we also watch him seated while playing the piano which befittingly adds to the lovely music of the film (Mychael Danna). This, along with the jumpy sound effects shared with what Zev recalls himself, elevates the suspense to new heights. Benjamin August writes this awe-inspiring work as Atom Egoyan directs the movie that had me glued to my seat while viewing Christopher Plummers heightened and mesmerizing performance with a Masterstroke",1458000000,7,2664,4.863436123348017
7673463,5,B01CDT609K,"Will I ever tire of Christopher Plummer? This time he is a man who suffers from senile dementia but he sets out to find the former Nazis who killed his family (and the family of another man in the same senior facility) at a long-ago concentration camp. The movie opens with him awakening and calling for his wife. Alarmed, he leaves his room and finds himself in some sort of quasi-medical facility. One of the women who works there has to tell him that his wife died two weeks earlier.

With a wonderfully unpredictable script by Benjamin August (""Class Rank"") and cleverly directed by Atom Egoyan (""The Captive""), we are on a hero's journey that goes from gently humorous to white-knuckle tense.  The people he encounters are consistently helpful and kind. The children in this one are particularly good: smart, polite and considerate.

The cast:
  * Christopher Plummer (""Elsa & Fred"") Zev Gutman is a survivor of Auschwitz (with the tattoo to prove it). Max has given him a set of instructions, unlimited funds, transportation and hotel reservations: all the help necessary to fulfill his mission. He forgets at times what he is about, but every time he re-reads Max's letter, he gets back on track. We are pulling for him all the way.
  * Martin Landau (""Entourage"") Max Rosenbaum never forgets his mission - revenge - and he won't let Zev forget his promise. Health failing, he is restricted to his wheelchair and his room, but he has his telephone and ample funds, powerful tools indeed.
  * Henry Czerny (""Revenge"") Zev's son Charles is concerned about his father's dementia, but he's furious when Dad goes missing from that home for seniors.
  * Bruno Ganz (""Vitus"") Rudy Kurlander #1 is the first person Zev contacts. I can't tell you about it because it would be a spoiler.
  * Dean Norris (""Secret in Their Eyes"") Sheriff John Kurlander has lived all his years in the United States. The fellow Zev seeks is his father. Another sure-fire spoiler, so I can't say more.
  * J&uuml;rgen Prochnow (""Hitman: Agent 47"") Rudy Kurlander #4 is happy to see Zev. That's all I can say... you know... spoiler...

This is an impossible review to write because I would be spilling the beans, no matter what I say about most of these characters. As I said, this script is unique and unpredictable. Plummer is flawless, with a slight hint of a German accent, the right amount of missing hair and confused eyes. We feel his anxiety in the passenger bus, at Customs, with that barking watchdog, and amid a family crisis at that mountain retreat. Like him, we loved the children.

The movie is R-rated (threatened violence and understanding of concentration camps), so expect some tension, very little profanity, no blowie uppie stuff and limited but effective gun play. Our screening audience was vocal and excited as we exited the theater.

This one is outstanding.",1457136000,181,2859,4.811860940695296
7673464,4,B01CDT609K,"Zev Gutman (Christopher Plummer) has severe dementia. Everyday he wakes up and rediscovers his wife Ruth has passed on. He still remembers most people including his son Charles (Henry Czerny) and good friend Max (Martin Landau). Max is wealthy and is in a wheel chair, although he has all of his marbles. He convinces Zev to hunt down Auschwitz block guard, now using the name Rudy Kurlander and kill him. The problem is that Zev forgets his task every time he goes to sleep and must rely on a lengthy letter Max has composed with detailed instructions. The other issue is that there are multiple people who might be Kurlander.

Not since Michael Caine played Harry Brown have senior vigilantes so terrorized the world of entertainment. You feel sorry for Zev and you have to wonder about the revenge and justice factor for people in their nineties. The film has a virtually clueless twist that it springs on you. The acting was decent and the movie keeps you engaged as you not only wonder about the next encounter, but how Zev can make it through the day.

Good drama.

7673465,4,B01CDT609K,"""Remember"" (2015 release from Canada; 96 min.) brings the story of Zev (played by Christopher Plummer). As the movie opens, Holocaust survivor Zev, also suffering from mild dementia, laments the passing of his wife. After the funeral, Zev, with the help of Max, another Holocaust survivor (played by Martin Landau), leaves/escapes from the senior home, vowing to find the German officer at Auschwitz who was responsible for murdering their families. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from noted Canadian director Atom Egoyan, yes! he of ""Exotica"" and ""The Sweet Hereafter"" from 20 years ago. This time, Egoyan dives into a thriller-type movie with some very serious undercurrents, namely to what extent Holocaust survivors can or should take justice into their own hands. all the while realizing that time is running out for the few remaining survivors, both on the Jewish and the German sides. The movie is plot-heavy, so the lesser said, the better, although I will say is that the packed theater gasped hard on more than one occasion. Christopher Plummer, now a crisp 86 years young, is nothing short of amazing in this film. He appears in virtually every frame of the movie, and literally carries this movie on his shoulders. Amazing.

I recently saw this as the opening movie of the 2016 Jewish & Israeli Film Festival here in Cincinnati. (The movie, which opened in Canada last Fall, was (is?) supposed to get a short theatrical run in the US this month before getting a DVD/Blu-ray release.) (*UPDATE* March 15, 2016: I just read that it will be released in a few theaters on the East and West coasts this coming weekend, no idea if it'll go wider after that.) After the theater lights came back on at the conclusion of the movie, people simply couldn't stop talking about what they had just seen. Suffice it to say, ""Remember"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1457049600,59,1982,4.8609467455621305

7673482,5,B01CDT609K,"I'll chime right in with disagreement with the thought that killing of John Kurlander (anti-semetic trooper) didn't seem real..also that justice is served only when the purpetrator knows what they did ( and isn't suffering from dementia)..true...but that doesn't apply here.

As far as realism...you need to see the whole film, and consider who this really was, to comment about the realism of his firearm handling.  The film gets you to love this elderly man and root for him.  When the film is over, you realize that this was a hardened war criminal...aparrently worse than the person he was seeking out ( ""YOU SAID, we we're WOLVES!"").. meaning, it sounds like Otto spurred-on Kunibert back in the day..a fact that Kunibert threw in Otto's face and got himself shot.

Knowing now who Otto was.. consider with what skill and disregard for life he fired a gun at people in his past..and even with the dementia, he could have some break-through of this ability..How easily he reacted to stop the dog attack, shoot Kurlander once, and then a perfect head shot when Kurlander wasn't stopped... Consider how easily, when called ""crazy"", he proved that that part of him was functional by easily pointing the gun at the young girl and threatening her life with a 3- second countdown.
A demented, sweet old man who who was completely gone, wouldn't do that.
( Did Zev seem ""truthful"", or evasive, when the gun store owner asked him if he knew anything about guns... brilliant Christopher Plummer acting.)

As far as him not knowing what he did 70 years ago.. yes, the dementia had him making statements that in a twist, really applied to himself... Statements such as, ""living a lie is not a life""... Or that , ""you lived this life so long you believe it to be true""..
As stated above, that old part of him can be functional with a gun when in a situation..and right after shooting his old friend, he shook his head ""yes"", and said, ""I remember""..then he shot himself.  So, maybe justice wasn't served with a court sentencing, but he did recall what he did in his past and killed himself as result....not paying like his suffering victims who didn't get to live 70 years did..but paid.

Anyway...so who thinks Max isn't charged in conspiracy when they find that letter on Zev?",1525392000,,2270,4.7316455696202535

7673499,3,B01CDT609K,"- despite the old Klingon proverb?  Good acting went into this (Plummer as always) and the script-writers tried very, very hard. Hence the three stars.  But in the end, the project fell through.  For one thing, the son-of-a-Nazi whom Plummer offs in the house is not really believable at this point.  The legacy of the Holocaust has been so ingrained in modern culture that no ""ordinary"" American - like that state trooper - would openly justify its ideology or advocate its actions, any more than the KKK.  The caricatured anti-Semite of yesterday is a trope that's outlived its usefulness as of the early 21st century.

Most importantly, my own father suffered from dementia in his 90s, and conning someone who already has a confused grasp of what's real and what's not is no justice and removes all ethical and legal justification for whatever you're trying to prove.  Moreover, the film conjures up stereotypes of the ""cunning Jew"": why stain our hands with their blood when you can con the goyim into killing themselves?  Thus the purity of The Law is upheld.  Well, maybe this makes MOSSAD or SHABAK operatives chuckle - like they do already when sidestepping the old graybeards of the Israeli Supreme Court or the Shabbat doofuses in Washington.  But justice is *not* served, in my humble view, until the guilty  clearly knows who he is, what he did, and why he has his punishment coming.  Decent people don't play games with real justice.",1520467200,,1446,4.833333333333333

Complicating matters are Zev's dementia and his adult son Charles (Henry Czerny), who of course wants him to come home. While it has an implausible premise, the movie still ends up being a tense and thrilling contemplation on old age, racism as well as the complicated relationship between mercy and justice. Without spoiling it too much, there is a scene featuring Breaking Bad's Dean Norris that is one of the most intense scenes I have seen since, well, Breaking Bad was on the air.",1510617600,,830,4.9784172661870505

Even though the Plummer character had agreed to the mission while he was still of sound mind, we get the very uneasy feeling that the Landau character is so determined to punish the Nazi, that he is manipulating the man with dementia, using his dementia to control him and to put him in harm's way. But we find out that despite his dementia, the Plummer character is far less helpless and far less harmless than we thought, and that the Martin Landau character was in fact manipulating him in ways we never imagined, and in an odd way, for his own good.",1510272000,,964,4.578034682080925

Max cannot fulfill the promise because he is on oxygen and is wheelchair bound, so he guides Zev through the process, writing a letter of instruction that Zev keeps with him as he starts on his journey.  The problem is Zev has dementia worsened by his wife's recent death and although he refers to the letter often he slides in and out of clarity, often with subtle facial expressions and body movements that demonstrate the brilliance of Plummer's character portrayal.

But nothing is as it seems. Direction and misdirection abound as Max travels by bus/train, stays in hotels, buys a gun, and meets various people, both incidentally and by following his instructions.  Frequent calls to Max keep him on track while Zev's son desperately looks for him.

Zev's journey is a constant struggle to remember both his life and his purpose, culminating in his final haunting 13 minute scene in which he does both.  Beautiful scenery, innocence, and evil intertwine until he finds the full clarity at last.  It is spine tingling, and it will stay with you for a long time.

Neither Christopher Plummer, still active at almost 88 nor Martin Landau who died in July 2017 at 89 considered retiring from their craft. Thankfully we have the full body of their work to view and this is a wonderful but heartbreaking movie to see the two of them together teaching every actor how it is done.

Thanks to the writers, director, producers, and supporting cast for doing such a phenomenal job in getting this just right...",1504137600,,1896,4.8390092879256965

7673721,5,B01CDT609K,"A remarkable film that is ostensibly about two very elderly Holocaust survivors who live in a nursing home.  The able-bodied one suffers from dementia and has difficulty remembering anything for more than an hour or so.  His wheelchair-bound compatriot conceives an elaborate plot whereby the two men can finally get revenge on an Auschwitz SS officer who'd murdered both of their families.  This Nazi officer had managed to sneak into America under an assumed identity.  Problem was there were four men of the right age and nationality who shared that same name.

The film is not just about Holocaust survivors.  It deals with the tragic consequences of dementia very realistically.  Modern day anti-semitism is also dealt with.  There are numerous twists and turns culminating in a final one that is a real shocker.

All of the acting is superb.  Christopher Plummer, best known as Baron von Trapp opposite Julie Andrews in ""The Sound of Music"", stars as the dementia suffering survivor with a mission. Martin Landau is his wheelchair bound co-conspirator.  The supporting cast is equally strong with special mention given to Dean Norris, Jrgen Prochnow and Henry Czerny as the son of one of the conspirators.

This is a smart, well-thought out film. It's not an action movie but one must pay close attention so as to not miss any of the subtle clues given along the way.  It's a movie about revenge, family, history, and I was absolutely riveted every moment.  Highly recommended!",1498435200,6,1483,5.0

7673755,4,B01CDT609K,"This is the guy who played Captain von Trapp in The Sound of Music with Julie Andrews!

***SPOILER ALERT***

This is a good movie, not the usual Holocaust or WWII movies (which there are plenty of); at times it's a bit slow. The movie itself is only 90 minutes long. The twist in the end is what makes it good; basically the old man (Zev) is suffering from dementia and another elderly man (Max) in the senior center recognizes him as one of the SS man (Otto AKA ""Rudy"") that killed his family. Only because of his dementia, Zev forgets a lot and has to constantly read a detailed letter that Max wrote.

The plot twist is that Zev is Otto, and the man ""Rudy"" that he eventually tracks down is his fellow SS at Auschwitz that committed war crimes with him. The whole thing was an elaborate scheme created by Max, who was determined to seek vengeance for the murder of his family by two SS guards at Auschwitz.

That's the best word to describe this movie. It's the one word everyone I know (who's seen it) says when it's over. What an undiscovered gem!
I never heard of this film, but seeing it's rare to find an Amazon movie rate over 4 stars (especially with that many reviews), and with an intriguing premise, I gave it a shot. Was I ever surprised. Why has no one been talking about this film?

Those of you looking for the usual action-packed, ""former CIA agent/Navy Seal/Special Ops dude goes head hunting"" revenge movie - this is NOT it. And that's part of it's beauty. There's more to it than raw revenge, and I'll leave it at that.  It takes a little while to get going, and at first seems like it will be quite predictable (as many revenge movies are), but enough suspense and things happen along the way to keep you engaged, and by the time it's over I predict you'll say ""wow"", too.

I've never seen Christopher Plummer in a role like this but he was fabulous. Viewers sensitive to people with dementia might find his role too close to home.  He did a superb job portraying the part. Martin Landau's part was smaller, but he did a good job as well.

As Zev made his way across country in search of the first Kurlander and the way the scenery was filmed, Boys From Brazil. The way the story was written, the plot, the theme, I'm thinking Boys From
Brazil. When Zev went to John Kurlanders home, the Sheriff, and you could hear the dog inside, then when he went inside the home with the Sheriff and said he's afraid of dogs, please put him away, The Boys From Brazil. I just couldn't get Boys From Brazil off of my mind, and it distracted me. There is no doubt in my mind that the writer of this film saw, liked, and was heavily influenced by Boys From Brazil. How the story slowly unfolds, the tension it slowly builds up is very similar to Brazil. I loved Boys From Brazil, and I also loved Remember. While very similar, it is also very different. The acting was superb and the plot very well executed. I loved the twist at the ending. Usually films are very predictable, I never saw this coming. And I loved the double meaning at the end of the story. In the nursing home when the old folks who lived with Zev watched the news account and one says ""Zev didn't know what he was doing."" And then Max said, ""He knew exactly what he was doing."" Yes.

I almost wanted to turn it off, but the determination of the main character  (Christopher Plummer) keeps drawing you back for a few more minutes until you're totally involved.

7673960,5,B01CDT609K,"Zev Guttman (Christopher Plummer) calls out for Ruth every time he awakens in the nursing facility, forgetting her recent death. He is 90, has dementia, and his friend Max (Martin Landau), also German-born, and fellow resident at the nursing home and fellow survivor of Auschwitz, guides him, serving as backup for his failing memory.  Max, wheelchair-bound, on oxygen, and seeming to be coughing out his end of days, instructs Zev in letter form so with "" see letter, "" inscribed on his wrist,  Zev can connect the last directive preceding another memory lapse. He has an assignment and a plan, Max reminds him: he must find Rudy Kurander, the SS Nazi officer and blockfuhrer who exterminated both their families at Auschwitz. Even the name of Simon Wiesenthal is invoked. Such a knockout premise---2 nonagenarian residents of a nursing home, 1 dramatically physically compromised, the other mentally, enlist the 2nd to  assassinate the assassin of their families. Spellbinding!  We root for Zev worriedly, hoping he won't lose all orientation as he first confusedly purchases a pistol and proceeds on his cross-country odyssey.  Christopher Plummer is outstanding in this role, as is Martin Landau in his. All the acting is top-notch, as are the writing, directing, cinematography, editing, music, all of it. The twists and turns in the storyline are stunning and developed without histrionics, rather methodically and carefully measured. The ending is a total stunner. And that's a welcome bonus in a thriller--  to have a completely unanticipated shocking outcome. Highly recommend.",1486166400,,1586,5.298804780876494

7674055,4,B01CDT609K,"REMEMBER is an interesting movie that has and extremely surprise ending.
Christopher Plummer plays a man who recently lost his lovely wife and is suffering.  He surely is grief stricken as the movie stats with him sleeping and waking up calling for his deceased wife.  He is suffering from dementia and goes to find the man who was a Nazis who killed his
 family (in Auschwitz the concentration camp) and the family of another man in the assisted living type facility (could be a hospital or apartment type nursing home or care facility).  The movie is very deep and explores some very strong issues.
  At times the movie makes you laugh and is funny.  The people he encounters for the most part are very helpful and kind souls.  The children he meets are delightful.  At other times extremely tense scenes.  Very unpredictable.
  The play of using aging, failing health, wheelchairs, not leaving a room all day and so on of one character is a real life sad but true statement of some folks aging process.
  This movie is extremely unpredictable and it is very challenging to leave a full review because it would be a spoiler to the movie if there were details about most of the characters.  It is a pretty unique show.  However is is so unrealistic and not plausible.
The movie is R-rated -- there is a violent scene and lots of adult issues -- so NOT A CHILD'S MOVIE.
  The actors and acting are top notch (and five stars).  However, the movie is extremely unrealistic and unbelievable and would be three stars, so put those together to rank this 4 stars.",1485820800,,1557,4.596363636363637

My only criticism was the shooting of the policeman in his home without much affect on him; I didn't find that believable even though the character was struggling with mental issues.  Often he seemed unable to cope and then at other times capable of pretty dramatic things.  Perhaps this is a symptom of the disease and I admit that I have had little experience with it.

7674260,4,B01CDT609K,"What a great script!!  If you give up on it in the early going, you will be disappointed.  It doesn't look like much of a movie in the beginning, as you are watching a stumbling old man hobble around looking for the Nazi soldier that killed his family,  But settled in, I promise it will pay off.  First you think that this is nuts because this old man having dementia will never be able to pull it off.  But as he goes from one man to the next you can see he is determined and then you get absorbed into wanting to know if he can really pull it off.  There are enough red herrings to keep you interested and the ending is a slam dunk.  Won't tell you to spoil it.  If you like Plummer then you will not be disappointed; he can still bring a film home on his acting alone, but he didn't have to stretch much with this script,  I have seem TOO MANY Nazi movies to ever be interested and I kept putting this one off, thinking, not another one, I've seen them all.

7674658,5,B01CDT609K,"I lucked on to this movie when I had some time to burn. It is quite simply a masterpiece. The best. Do not let Christopher Plummer's age and his acting of a bona fide dementia patient fool you. Do not let current bad and predictable writing lull you into a sense of "" I know what's going to happen next; you do not"". This is true craft MASTERED in Mr. plummer's twilight years. He is as good as it gets and he HAS aged like fine wine in his craft. The supporting cast, while minimal, is outstanding, too. Look at everything and see everything and see if you can figure out the ending aforehand.. The ending is as realistic to human nature as it ever gets and utterly realistic. I cannot say enough about this movie. Urinate before watching so as not to miss a word or jesture. I am a retired commercial pilot from Aspen and now retired to the Islands while still young with a young family. I am an accomplished writer, was a famous DJ and producer and KNOW the great from the absolute greatest attainable. I have met men such as these portrayed from around the world. This is the real deal, but father time is running out the clock, big time, for these men. SEE IT NOW, while you can still imagine them actually still alive today. and ""REMEMBER"" what happened. It could easily happen again. I know. I give it 5 ++++++ stars. If you are intelligent and better still a are well traveled, it will knock you down and get you THINKING! Besides, it's a very easy watch (no thinking necessary if you do not want to), and suitable for the whole family. They have to learn sometime. This is true craft. Mr. Plummer is unbelievable. Martin Landau is superb. The ORIIGINAL Hawaiian Kawika  (David, me), requests that you to watch it.",1483660800,9,1722,4.398119122257054

7675434,1,B01CDT609K,"Entire film lacks a realistically written character or palpable scenario for that matter. The main character doesn't posess a spot of appeal on any level. Even with the big ""reveal"" at the end, couldn't at least one of these damn characters be relatable?? I could only imagine this movie was written by a stoned teenager about a grumpy demented neighbor, or a disgruntled parient at an assisted living center with an overactive imagination. The story lost my attention several times as the writing was sloppy and sparse. The painful amount of ""suspense"" provided by implausible scenarios made me regret clicking on this absolute mess. I'll credit where it's due, the cinematography is decent and the effects and sets were surprisingly well done. Also, although the portrayal of an old and belligerently senile man couldn't have been done better, the acting couldn't save the contrived plot and stop-slow-go pacing",1481241600,4,913,5.175675675675675

7675916,5,B01CDT609K,"Atom Egoyan is a masterful cinematic story teller, who's patience and focus seems almost agonizing, but always yields powerful emotional rewards.

In Remember, all of his artistic cylinders are firing as he gently brings the audience into the confusion, loss, and desire that blankets the mind of an elderly man with dementia. Armed with a letter, written by his friend, Zev embarks on a journey to find a Nazi war criminal who escaped justice.

It is easy to draw comparisons to other films - perhaps the twists may not surprise some - but the mastery with which Egoyan's direction gently coaxes heart-rending performances from the cast is, alone, worth the price of admission.",1477699200,,678,4.991150442477876

7675965,3,B01CDT609K,"I feel like this film is a rather mediocre issue from the so-called ""Holocaust Industry."" As the last of the Holocaust survivors pass on, the ""industry"" punches out films regularly which keep the Holocaust in mind. I've read and studied the Holocaust since Eichmann was captured/abducted in Argentina. The primary character shows us initially that he has a pretty bad memory. And yet, he's sent on this expedition to come to terms with one of his abusers. I just don't believe it can be both. As fine an actor as Christopher Plummer is, this just seemed too much, too far. Sorry, but there have been far greater, more impressive films created than this one. There are many I've seen & ""starred."" This isn't one. Don't waste your time.",1477267200,,734,4.7421875

When considered in retrospect, the plot is somewhat implausible insofar as Zev, while knowing his true identity, continued that assumed identity which he needed to escape beyond his need for it - he went on to live it.

In sharp contrast with Otto Wallisch, Kunibert Sturm changed his name to hide his past, but he did not become what he was not.

This hindsight does not detract from the outstanding performances or from the remarkable intrigue, the interplay with and the portrayal of the trappings of dementia and the repeated ""close calls"" - any one of which would have prevented Zev from finding the real ""Rudy Kurlander"".

The pacing does not match the music, like all of a sudden this Hitchcock type suspense music happens as the main character walks through a hallway, and nothing happens. Yes, there's a twist at the end, if you made it that far. It's kind of like getting that weird pasty gum at the end of a stale lollipop.

The only redeeming factors have got to be the acting which was on point. All characters were believable and beautifully portrayed in all their realistic, bluntly genuine ways.",1476662400,,550,4.612244897959184

7676082,5,B01CDT609K,"An excellent film in both concept and execution, understated in many ways, and yet surprising in others. Kudos to the writer who dreamt up this plot and its most-unexpected twist at the finale. Christopher Plummer does a fine job of carrying this film, easily drawing us in and convincing us of this characters motivations, though we wouldn't expect anything less from him.

This entire film's construction does well at finding small ways to make us care about our main character, from an interaction with a child, to someone who is bigoted against him. While it may seem to be slow-moving at first, it builds in a subdued manner that allows you to feel as if the events portrayed are entirely possible, so kudos to the director, editor, and production teams as well.",1476576000,,767,4.8106060606060606

Plummer excelled as expected in his role of a survivor suffering from dementia who is tasked by a fellow survivor and nursing home resident (Martin Landau) with avenging the deaths of their families in Auschwitz. What was unexpected was how compelling the plot became as it unfolded.  I won't elaborate, but be prepared for a ride.",1476144000,,535,4.944444444444445

I found it a little bit slow in the beginning, but then I started getting interested in what was going to happen next. Can you picture a hitman with dementia? Yeah, it does get interesting.

This war survivor is at a senior house and makes a promise to his inpatient friend, who is in a wheelchair, to kill the man who killed their families. He escapes the facility with some money and a detailed letter written by his friend describing and explaining everything in case his memory fails.

This is a nice movie if you like to be surprised. I must not spoil it, but it ends with a brilliant twist. I didn't see that coming...",1476057600,,842,4.25

I feel we may have reached our limit, not because the event lacks relevance or is unimportant. Hardly. The problem becomes how to tell the story in a new way. This film manages to do that. It's unusual and finds one more way to tell the story and for that it deserves praise. Also, the performances are excellent. And yet, when it was over, I found myself thinking less of the horror than of the fact the storyteller had found another way. In other words, not a profound experience. I would actually rank it 2.5 were that a choice.",1475539200,,708,4.48062015503876

Funny thing is, I had a fleeting thought that ""Zev's"" friend, ""Max"", was taking advantage of ""Zev's"" dementia but I couldn't figure out how.  I also thought it was strange that the tattooed numbers on ""Zev's"" arm varied greatly from the numbers on another man's but I just chalked that up to the fact that there were several Nazi-scum responsible for the macabre ""cattle"" branding.

A sign of a great film? That after the credits roll, the story still goes on...The questions it raises about how he ""became"" something/someone that he had despised.  The fallout from the discovery of who he really is; causing his family to question their true heritage and whether or not they, themselves, are living a lie?!  The questions just keep coming; compounding exponentially!

And the use of the ""air raid"" sirens and the barking dogs; especially a German Shepherd with a foaming mouth!!  The awesomeness of this film never ceases.",1475193600,,1053,4.773480662983426

7676437,1,B01CDT609K,"Despite Plummer's thoughtful performance the story is annoyingly contrived. It tries to make a deep point about memory and shame, but the effort is muted by the story's elaborate contrivances. Equally worse is the direction: flat and sleepy and causing a wayward drift. There are moments of intensity, but they are isolated by longer moments of plodding camerawork and sameness of location despite all the mileage traveled. The good news is, one can always get better next time aroundbut then may not.",1474848000,3,501,5.121951219512195

7676521,4,B01CDT609K,"Unpredictable films are enjoyable because they can rip the expected plot trajectory in the viewers mind away and placed somewhere they didn't expect. The master of this is David Lynch. But while does not go to Lynchian levels, it will likely leave the viewer saying, ""Whoa."" more than once.

It plays like a small film because the plot starts that way. Christopher Plummer plays Zev who recently lost his wife while falling deeper into the throws of dementia. He conspires with Max, another resident of his nursing home played typically well by Martin Landau, to kill an SS guard from Auschwitz believed to still be alive in the U.S. There are four men who have the same name as the one they believe the SS guard was using. Max, wheelchair bound, is the brains. Zev is the brawn.

It all starts almost glacially slowly but it constantly gains momentum through the remainder of the film building to a nearly denouement when the confrontation with the guard ultimately occurs. Although more could be said about the unfolding plot, it cannot be done without revealing spoilers. Remember, there are plot twists to come.

While the slow starting pace may be off-putting to some, viewer will be rewarded if they see it though. It doesn't rate five stars because some of the plot moves are quite predictable. Some but not all. It's redeemed by the things mentioned earlier along with an overarching humanity that can normally only be achieved smaller films like this. This is not a popcorn movie but it is worth an hour and a half of the viewers time.",1474416000,,1544,4.732342007434944

7676695,5,B01CDT609K,"The topic interested me and Christopher Plummer is a good actor, so I thought  I'd watch it.  It was a very well done movie, with a great ending.  It is not an ""action"" movie yet there is action.  You get pulled into the story and what seems like just a couple of older men in a nursing home, gets compelling.  Plummer, plays a man with dementia who is sent on a deadly mission.  What, how, when, why  are not the simple questions with answers they seem to be.  This is more for adults or teens looking for a serious topic movie.  It is not comedy or light viewing.  The suspense and story line kept me engaged and I was very glad I chose to view this movie.",1473984000,,658,4.110236220472441

7676703,5,B01CDT609K,Terrific movie and presentation.  I enjoyed every minute.  The actors were great and the story was mesmerizing. The truth was not revealed until the very end.  Landau's character never let go in his mind the atrocities committed against his family and the two Nazi SS men primarily responsible for his family's death at Auschwitz.  He depended upon the degrading memory of Plummer's character to lay out a well-calculated plan that he could no longer carry out himself.,1473984000,,469,5.0519480519480515

7676907,4,B01CDT609K,"Excellent work, Atom.  The film took me back more that fifty years when, in ""The Sound of Music"", Plummer's character (naval Capt. Von Trapp, based on a real-life character) declined and ultimately defied the Nazi invitation into their circle of evil.  In life as in film it is comforting (to me, anyway) to see the continued recognition of evil deeds & intentions as an early step in dealing with them.  Here, however, he is somewhat manipulated (by Landau's character) to commit, alternatively, acts of kindness, courage, & unbridled violence.
  Wikipedia has complete and thorough history/biography pages of many of the ""worst of the worst"" who have lived the remainder of their post-war lives unapologetically for the evil they cast upon German-Jewish citizens (as their time comes, they pass, many times silently to the rest of the world).  Shown by the film's conclusion, however, there were non-Jewish German citizens with moral consciences.",1473292800,,948,5.245033112582782

Plummer is driven to complete his task before time runs out in spite of suffering from dementia and occasional lapses of memory.  What an incredible, unexpected ending!  Definitely worth watching.",1472860800,,585,5.202127659574468

7677133,3,B01CDT609K,"Egoyam is always spoken about in Canada as something of a film genius. I was surprised at how unplausible this movie's story line is. The main character remembers people from his past, i.e., his dead wife, but can't remember his own name????? The main character has dementia or Alzheimer's and most people with Alzheimer's in the early stages can remember details from their distant past but not new memories. This character has forgotten his past completely. If I can't find the plot plausible then the rest of what is presented falls apart for me. Plummer is great as usual. Bad cinematography. I have watched and read a lot about the holocaust but this film adds nothing to what already exists. Three stars because of the actors and curiosity.",1472774400,,746,4.8359375

7677148,5,B01CDT609K,Christopher Plummer is AMAZING in this part as a man fighting dementia as he tries to avenge the loss of his family in the Holocaust.

7677265,2,B01CDT609K,"This movie is intended to be a drama. But it quickly turns ridiculously silly. It's about a demented old man who gets sent out of his nursing home to find and kill the man who was his concentration camp jailer. Understand: A man who can't take his own medicine is told to follow instructions to take a train across the country, find his way to several hotels in several cities, buy a gun, track down the one-time camp jailer and kill him. It is so far beyond the realm of possibility that it became, for me, laughable. Oddly, this movie -- which intends to deliver high drama and not comedy -- offers great performances by a great cast: Christopher Plummer, Dean Norris (the brother-in-law DEA agent in ""Breaking Bad""), Martin Landau as the manipulative fellow nursing home resident who sends Christopher Plummer on his ""mission,"" Bruno Ganz (who played a breathtaking Adolph Hitler in the sensational German language docudrama, ""Downfall"") and Jurgen Prochnow (the captain of the U-Boat in ""Das Boot."" ) With a cast like that, what could go wrong? If you like these actors -- and I do, a lot -- maybe it's worth your while to sit through it. But, if it's tight storytelling you're after, you'd do better to move on. (The 2-stars are for the casting; I'd actually give the movie itself less than 1-star -- and a pie in the face!)",1472428800,,1329,4.6118143459915615

But the realistic depiction of the ravages of dementia were simultaneously moving and frightening ( as one who is moving into that potential age category). If you are looking for action / adventure, forget about it. But if you are looking for mindful and realistic depiction of justice and human struggle, this is a movie that is more than worthwhile watching.

THIS IS NOT AN ACTION FILM. Be forewarned. I would add that the plot twists are... a cheat. A better writer wouldn't have done it the way this was done. To throw further insults, Egoyan is one of the most over-rated directors of all time.

That said, the acting and the ideas being worked make it worth it. So to be fair give Egoyan credit for nurturing the performances.

Now, after you've screened this, the same ideas of revenge and dementia are worked out a thousand times better by a real director: Macau based Johnny To in ""Vengeance"" where French singer/actor  Johnny Hallyday stalks professional killers while moving.

Plummer is a dementia patient, Zev, who recently became a widower. Each time he dozes off, he tends to forget that. His friend Max, on O2 in the same nursing home, has money and his wits so he writes each step of the quest Zev promised to embark upon once Ruth (his wife) died. He and Zev have agreed that Zev will track down the Nazi SS Officer who killed their families at Auchewitz. His research has narrowed it down to 4 men with the same name scattered around the states. Zev encounters so many helpful people along the way who assist the elderly confused man that he is without realizing he is considered a missing person.
The thriller aspect of this movie was exceptional. I enjoyed it so much, I spent the next day telling everyone I spoke to to look for it. Rare to find a non Hitchcock movie this good.",1472169600,,1076,4.402010050251256

7677440,4,B01CDT609K,"Although slow moving (what do you expect...both primary characters are in their 90's), the tension created by the pace and plot content was unnerving by itself. As the story moves towards the climactic ending, it's a surprise that gives one pause to consider the potential of the human mind to be so self-deceptive. We must remember the capacity of man's inhumanity to man as such atrocities as those committed by the Nazi regime still echo through the halls of history. The aftermath of such evil cannot be overestimated.",1471737600,,522,4.943181818181818

7677449,5,B01CDT609K,"Another brutafully twisted orchestral experience by Atom Egoyan. I would recommend going into this movie with as little knowledge as possible about its plot.

It's certainly a slow burn, but it's meant to be heartbreaking and to have this underlying musical quality to its pacing. It's very operatic, very very tragic, and boundlessly meticulous. There's a strange specificity of normalcy that Egoyan's films all seem to exude in spades. And, as ever, the acting is immeasurably through the roof. It's bizarre, it's complicated, and yet it's so subtle and mundane in its brutal and terrifying tragedy.

It's an Atom Egoyan film, and either that appeals to you, or it doesn't. This is no different; but just as fascinatingly magnificent.",1471737600,3,736,5.176470588235294

At 86 years young, he carries this movie with all the authority and skill of his extensive body of work to back him. Aside from that ~ this is a fantastic movie, an easy 4-4.5 stars. It starts out gently but don't be fooled. The tension mounts until I was glued to my seat and the ending literally made me gasp out loud and clap my hand to my mouth in disbelief.

I was watching several tv episodes and had to crank the volume up to hear it. In between was an Amazon ad so loud I thought it was going to blow my tv speakers. Now I'm groping for the remote to mute the blasted thing. If this isn't fixed I don't think I'll be getting this for a third year.,1470700800,,573,4.171171171171171

It is not a Holocaust movie, in that it shows the atrocities of the Holocaust (for those who don't watch those kind of movies).  Plummer is an elderly man with Alzheimer's (or other dementia), who is tasked to find and kill the monster that killed both his family and that of fellow nursing home resident, Martin Landau.  This is a movie you will not soon forget.  The only people that may shy away from this movie are those with close ties to Alzheimer's disease and to whom that is a sore subject.  Otherwise, go for it.  It is an excellent movie.",1470700800,,788,4.531914893617022

It's actually a slowly developing revenge movie that builds suspense as the main character (Plummer) get closer and closer his goal.  The only problems I had with it was that it didn't show how Plummer left the hospital near the end; would they have just let an old confused man check himself out?  And at times he seemed a little too lucid, especially when the scene needed him to be.  Also, I didn't buy the possibility of a person with such severe dementia actually accomplishing all that he did.

The film kept my interest from the first scene and was utterly unlike anything I'd expected--or anything I'd seen before. In fact, I can't think of any movie to compare it with. Plummer and Landau give, as one familiar with their work would expect, amazing performances; their talents have aged well. But so much depends on a screenplay, and this one is brilliant. You follow two friends, quite old, at an assisted living home, one who is afflicted by physical problems, the other with dementia who escapes to follow his friend's instructions to take revenge, which he supposedly (and may well have) agreed to earlier. But there is absolutely nothing there to prepare you for the twists of the screenplay, though they certainly seem to be in keeping with everything you know until the final moment.

I strongly recommend this movie. It is highly intelligent and paced to hold the viewer's interest. And if Ben August never writes another screenplay (I'm unfamiliar with his work), this one would be justification for his time on Earth.",1469923200,,1186,4.871287128712871

BTW, Plummer does all his own piano playing in this film, and even demanded to handle the stunt on the couch so that it would appear more realistic. Landau said that when their characters were talking over the telephone in the film, Plummer stood just off-screen and prompted Landau, because the aging Landau had a hard time remembering his lines and hitting his marks.

Plummer was excellent in the role, moving and speaking so true to what I would expect of an old man who had been through horrific times. Thankfully, there were no scenes from concentration camps (not that those would be inappropriate, but I have a difficult time with those), and the story was more character-driven than historically pungent.

Just press play. This movie did in 90 minutes what most movies can't do in their extended versions in this day and age. Told a cohesive story that brings you in. And they did the old fashioned way, with great writing of a character driven story, intimate directing ad cinematography that makes you feel close to the story and last, but not least the acting. Christopher Plummer and Martin Landau are two of the all time greats, actors who can make you feel, really feel something. There's a great cameo in there too, I picked this movie based on the image and tag line alone, so I didn't know who else was in it. I won't give it away for those of you like me, who would rather be surprised.

7678824,4,B01CDT609K,"Each of of Egoyan's last two films has been far more ""accessible"" (a poor descriptor, but apt) than any of his previous work, and are especially story- and character-driven.  His earlier films tended toward the oblique, the distant, and the ambiguous.  These last two, ""Remember"" and ""The Captive,"" are a radical departure.  ""Remember"" is an adaptation of a thriller; ""The Captive"" was co-written with David Fraser, whose metier, judging by his credits, is the thriller.  The dreamy quality of ""Exotica"" and ""The Sweet Hereafter"" is largely gone, and while I'm a huge fan of both films, I applaud the newer work--among which I include ""Where the Truth Lies"" (also based on a novel, and a rather good one, too).  Story matters.  So does plot. And they are not the same.  Egoyan proves himself deft with both in ""Remember.""  This is a story that, at first blush, appears to be Your Average Holocaust Revenge Story, but 10 minutes in, you start to realize that something else has been added to the mix -- actually, several elements have been added.  And they converge at the end in a plot that has taken several left-hand turns that you never see coming; yet when you walk it back, you realize that's where it was headed all along.  Will this end up in anyone's pantheon?  Naw.  But watch it anyway.  Like ""Spotlight,"" ""Remember"" is about trauma, memory, and the repressed; the difference is, it does it about 100 times better.",1468886400,,1424,4.763265306122449

""For each question there is only one answer"" is part of the hellish brainwashing evil of the Nazis, transmitted from generation to generation.  Be on guard because it still lives among us (in the facist islamic jihadis, in the facist top leaders of the american democratic party, and in the various varieties of the loveless hearts of men).  How nicely tidy the Nazis looked on the outside and how evil on the inside.  NEVER assume that the way something looks is the way it really is.  People are truly measured by their love, and love means self sacrifice.  There is a difference between power grabbers who serve themselves and public servants who work to serve others.

Yes they are actually older men, but these excellent actors, project personalities of intimate deeply felt emotions. Often sad, and lonely feelings are on display.  As you follow the path they take you also want to see them complete the task, to accomplish their vow. This is a dangerous, and risky choice they are determined to do, you fear for these men, and there fragile minds and bodies, but at the same time root for them to get it done. Plummer struggles with his failed memory, and Landau supplies the means to keep him on track. Tense, suspenseful, Plummer moves through, you follow with him knocking on doors and never knowing if he has found what he seeks.

7679026,4,B01CDT609K,"REMEMBER  was an unexpectedly interesting film. The first half hour or so, I wasn't sure if I was going to watch it all the way through because it seemed rather slow-moving, but Christopher Plummer's performance had me riveted and I'm glad I stuck it out as the film does pick up its pace, in a shocking manner by the way, until the totally unexpected, did-not-see-that-coming climax.

In a nutshell the film centers on senior citizen and dementia patient Zev Gutman (Christopher Plummer) who lives in an assisted-living facility. He is tasked by a friend, Max Rosenbaum (Martin Landau) with a very serious mission: to track down and kill a Nazi SS officer who had been responsible for murdering their families during WW II in Auschwitz. Rosenbaum (Landau) is not able to carry out this mission because he is confined to a wheelchair, so it is up to Gutman (Plummer) to see the mission through. Now obviously this poses complications as Gutman suffers from dementia and frequently forgets where he is, let alone what he is supposed to do, so as the film progresses, we get to watch the whole painful process of Gutman trying to figure things out, his only link to the present being a letter written by Rosenbaum with detailed instructions.

Plummer delivers a compelling performance in the main role - and I won't go into details here to avoid spoilers. This is one of those films where the payoff comes even after the credits have rolled as you will reflect back on the plot and kind of connect certain dots. Final verdict - rewarding for the discerning and patient viewer.",1468713600,2,1574,4.758241758241758

So, having both of them playing these roles was fantastic!  Yes, I'd highly rate this.

This movie also caused me to rent another movie, Mengele....because Dr. Mengele was one of the Auschwitz genetic doctors at Auschwitz.  He escaped after the war to South America, as did Eichman.

I don't think I will give too much away if I say that not since The Six Sense has there been an ending that I never would have anticipated nor considered.

7679999,4,B01CDT609K,"In this captivating drama we have senior survivors of the holocaust plotting revenge on the tyrannical SS Nazi officers that have enslaved and murdered their Jewish families. The main protagonist is an elderly member of a senior retirement center who is experiencing early stages of Alzheimers and embarks on a journey hunting down the nazi WW2 soldiers who killed his family. With the help of another senior resident (also a holocaust survivor) he is provided a list of instructions that helps him ""remember"" what he promised to do..
The film is filled with a lot of suspenseful character interaction. The acting is above par and you will see noticeable actors from popular tv and film. Somewhat of a slow burn at times, but the wait is well worth it.
If you are a fan of emotional war films as well as plot twists you will want to see this one through til the end.

7680118,5,B01CDT609K,"This was one of those movies that has a few twists and turns you don't see coming. A story of a man who's lost his wife and because he has dementia he doesn't remember. After sitting SHIVA (a practice by the Jewish people when a loved one dies) he goes on a quest to find the NAZI who killed his family; his friend encourages he do this for himself, his friend and all the others that lost so many by the hands of the Nazi's.  His search leads him to several people but none turn out to be 'the one he is looking for.' Then he believes he has finally found 'the one' and the story twists around again. Christopher Plummer does an incredible job as does  Martin Landau who is the friend who lives in the assisted living home with 'Zev' and is the friend that gives him written instructions of how to go about catching this man they are both yearning to be caught and punished with the maximum penalty of the law. Martin writes a letter giving Plummer the instructions where to go to find the hated Nazi and thus begins 'Zev's' quest. This movie was a bit slow but the premise was something I've heard about, I've read about and that the Simon Wiesenthal Center has worked tirelessly on; to find Nazi criminals thought the world and this organization has captured, tried and convicted many these Nazi criminals.

So Zev begins his journey and as stated above there are a few twists you never see coming. The movie at first I thought could be true of many seeking to get justice for what the Nazi's had done but this story had a different twist, a well done, well acted and though a bit  slow, kept your attention throughout.

I would like to think that all the Nazi criminals of World War II would all be captured and are given what they deserve. This movie though a bit different has a lot of truths to it. I'd recommend it to all as a quality piece of film-making!",1467676800,,1864,4.314285714285714

7680241,5,B01CDT609K,"""Never shall I forget that night that first night in camp that turned my life into one long night. Never shall I forget the small faces of the children whose bodies I saw transformed into smoke under a silent sky. Never shall I forget those flames that consumed my faith forever""
From the book ""Night"" by Elie Wiesel

Oh the pain.
The pain of not remembering.
And the pain of reliving a past that would best yet mustn't be forgotten.

I did not expect to appreciate the movie ""Remembering"" as much as I did because I honestly did not expect any characters played by Christopher Plummer and Martin Landau to be anything more than secondary and predictable. The plot itself initially seemed to lead you to believe that it was a recycled, reused, or re-purposed sad revenge story of a man with a history. (What does the cover photo showing an elderly Plummer with a gun suggest to you?) I hung on for nearly all of the movie's entirety because of the engaging chemistry between the two benign old men. I didn't mind watching the suffering progress--Landau with his committed guidance to aid Plummer in fulfilling his self-promise and Plummer with his resignation to accomplish what he wholeheartedly believed he must do. I'm glad I stayed to the conclusion because weeks after watching, the impact is still embedded in my mind.  Even though they were conspiring to commit a crime, they were calm and comforting.  I actually wanted to see them succeed. Is there such a thing as benevolent revenge?

Go ahead and watch the movie.  If you are a person unafraid of thought and emotion you will not be disappointed. In fact with this day,July 2, 2016, marking the death of Elie Wiesel, Holocaust Survivor and Nobel Laureate, you may contemplate the question, ""When will the suffering ever end?""

I propose that the question be left unanswered until the world first acts on the problem of why must any people even be forced to endure such suffering.",1467504000,6,1940,4.72189349112426

I fell asleep on it twice and had to get back to where I fell asleep at both times because I didn't' want to miss anything.  Just about every scene was important for different reasons.  They were just slower than molasses unfortunately.  The ending---  WHOAH!!!  What a twister!

I am a nurse practitioner and his portrayal of an elderly gentleman suffering from Alzheimer's-type dementia is spot on. Plummer's character, Zev, starts a journey to find a former Block Fuhrer from Auschwitz.  It's definitely not what you might expect: This movie takes a some surprising twists and turns.  It's hard to imagine watching an old guy with dementia fulfill a promise could be so exciting, but his character is so likable and engaging I couldn't help myself!  During the course of the film you are lead to believe that Zev is a Jew and he is seeking revenge against the Block Fuhrer who murdered his entire family.  While I won't give away the ending, it's certainly not what you think. Superb acting! I literally gasped during the final scene.  Absolutely Riveting.",1467244800,11,846,4.971631205673759

According to Landau there were four persons with that name came to the US, he has tracked them down and now it's up to Plummer to find the right one and keep the promise.

7680394,5,B01CDT609K,"This is a riveting suspenseful film with one of the greatest almost mesmeric acting job that I ever saw. Christopher Plummer should win the academy award for his performance of a 90-year-old man suffering from dementia, who sometimes realizes who he is, where he is, and why he is where he is. He looks like a 90-year-old man and acts as one, and does a perfect job impersonating a Jewish man who came to the US from Germany, who suffered in the holocaust, and spoke with a slight Jewish accent appropriate for such a man.

Most times when he awoke, he did not know where he was and why. He thinks his wife Ruth will come soon. He calls for her. He does not know that she died of cancer a week ago, while he held her hand.

He is in a nursing home. Ruth brought him there because of his dementia.

In the home, he meets a holocaust survivor, another old man, Martin Landau, who tells him that like him he is a survivor of Auschwitz.  He tells Plummer that those who have been searching for Nazis know that a Nazi took the name Kurlander, they know there are four Kurlanders, but do not know which of them is the Nazi. Landau gives Plummer a letter with information about each of the four Kurlanders and money and makes reservations for him at hotels and for taxis that he will need during his search. Plummer accepts the job to find the right Kurlander and kill him.

Frequently Plummer forgets his mission. He writes on his wrist read the letter to cause him to remember. Once he needs a young girl to read the letter for him. He promised her that his wife Ruth will come soon with candy for her.

The meetings of Plummer and the men he is searching for is eventful. The film has a surprise ending.

This is a film everyone who wants to see a drama with superb acting should see.",1467158400,3,1780,4.295522388059702

Moving throughout though it assumes historical knowledge that younger folks have not really been exposed to and may not understand the gravity of what ""prisoner"" means when places like Auschwitz are referenced. It just happened to be the worst. But I can't think of any more misleading term for what was done to the Jew, disabled, gypsy, homosexual,  than calling them ""prisoners"" inferring they were simply in a jail environment rather than the hellish inferno of physical and psychological pain that has left a permanent stain on humanity.  The depiction of dementia was spot on both as metaphor and real issue.  The plot, in fact, used it well as a device propelling the story. The story touched on many ideas briefly but in memorable ways, anti-Semites, perception, justice, lies, memory and how that effects lives beyond ourselves. It was a deep story told in a knowing and heartfelt way. Christopher Plummer carried the entire film with grace and the acting that has been his incredible hallmark for years. Martin Landau was wonderful as was the rest of the cast for so many reasons. Surprising and touching until the end.",1467072000,2,1191,4.974874371859296

Christopher Plummer plays a survivor (Zev) of Auschwitz who has a touch of dementia.  After his wife dies, his friend sends him on a mission to search out a gestapo guard responsible for killing his family. The friend gave him a list of four addresses, one being the residence the the guard, living under an alias. The movie follows Zev as he visits each address, encounters each individual and tries to determine if he has the right person to seek revenge against.

After watching, I went to work the next day, recommending the movie to everyone who would listen.  If you haven't seen it, rent it or buy it and see it.",1466899200,,753,4.548148148148148

This movie is a complete waste of the talents of two magnificent actors, Christopher Plummer and Martin Landau.  The premise is somewhat interesting, but taking the law into your own hands is never a good thing.  There are a few other things that just don't fit.  The killing of the State Trooper in his home with no apparent ramifications or consequences.  Really?  Also,  the idea that a Nazi officer ( Plummer) would pass himself off as a Jew for 70 years is a bit too much to swallow.  And in the end,  Plummer's character was just being manipulated by Landau's.  Just pathetic",1466812800,,700,4.476190476190476

The acting was superb; the story line enticing and the scenes appropriate to the emotion and theme. Throughout the movie, I questioned the ""R"" rating but quite understood more than midway through the movie with the very foul language and ""adult"" ending.  The drama was appropriately written, acted and emotionally charged. The end of the movie was chilling and disturbing but well understood and ""put together.""

First of all, Christopher Plummer and Martin Landau are top-notch in my book, so I couldn't NOT watch a film starring those two. The Holocaust has always fascinated me since I was a child and first read ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" in elementary school. I could not fathom how one group of people led by an insane tyrant could treat another group of people so barbarically--and I still can't.
The film was a bit plodding in parts (my boyfriend fell asleep at one point) but it picked up when Zed began visiting his ""candidates,"" all of whom turned out to be the wrong one.
I won't spoil the ending but it was a complete surprise and left me saying, ""Wow!"" I would watch it again just to see what I might have missed to leave me so unprepared.",1466380800,31,826,4.267515923566879

7681183,5,B01CDT609K,"This movie came to town a few months ago. I saw that Christopher Plummer was starring in it so I thought this would be a great movie. I have been reading many books about WWII and I looked forward to seeing it. But the local theater said the movie was not captioned so I wasn't able to see the movie in the theater. I was annoyed to say the least.
Recently, I checked on Amazon and noticed that this movie was not only listed but captioned also. I was really happy and I rented it. The ending to this movie was unexpected. I will not share that piece of info....watch the movie! If you are knowledgeable about WWII, this is a great movie.",1466380800,2,638,4.195121951219512

It has to be done before the Nazi he's hunting dies of natural causes.
But the hunter (Christopher Plummer) has dementia so he has to keep reminding himself of his mission.
A very good story with unexpected twists and turns.

The pacing was deliberately slow, building to an impeccably-timed and well-disguised twist. Breaking Bad's Dean Norris was the proverbial cherry on top. His brief scene with Christopher Plummer - wow. His vitriolic dialogue was paced much like the film, slow at first but building to the explosive end. The palpable loneliness and hatred he spewed lead to the necessary conclusion, again, much like the rest of the film.

7682425,1,B01CDT609K,"What a hopelessly convoluted and pathetic plot. Really! For those looking for a far better plot with mistaken identity, I heartily recommend Edgar Hilsenrath's ""The Nazi and the Barber"". Unfortunately not made into a movie yet! The overdramatisation in ""Remember"" is completely pathetic: the Holocaust isn't bad enough for some, apparently. No, we have to weave it into a completely incredible plot about someone who has Altzheimer and nevertheless goes on a mission to punish some Nazi's that got away. On the way he shoots a contemporary Nazi, or the son of one, who just happens to get in his way. Never mind about the ethics: Nazi's are the bad guys right? Doesn't matter when or where or who... I am sorry if I offend someone out there, I am Jewish myself, and an Israeli too, but don't you all think its kinda time to stop writing crap about the Holocaust and start writing some real drama again? By the way, my Aunt was a survivor of Auschwitz and I assure you all, she had better things to do than hunt Nazi's and take revenge on any racists she happened upon. She had a life to live and a story to tell and she did those things without all the pathos that Shoah revivalists seem to think is necessary.",1465603200,,1210,4.529680365296803

7682446,2,B01CDT609K,"Sorry but a compelling story does not always equal a good movie.  The script and parts of the story line are so predictable or unbelievable that it takes away from the real story and the brilliant acting of the main characters.  It is hard for me to believe that anyone would let a total stranger into their home and send them down stairs without knowing their name or why they are there or even announcing their presence.  The children are cute and acted good but do parents not tell their kids to not to talk to strangers any more.  Yes he is an older gentlemen but most kids are afraid of their shadows much less form friendships with older people in minutes on a bus or in a hospital room.  I really thought  Christopher Plummer's character was going to say ""do want some candy little girl"" Really? the story is just not believable.  The son does not act really worried about his dad when he arrives near the end of the movie and the final scene was unreal.  No one ran to call 911, cried or really responded in any emotional manner and the daughter accepts what a total stranger makes her father say while he has gun pointed at him. This could have been a very moving story and a wonderful film.  This is an example of how we have been dumbed down and conditioned to accept and praise  mediocrity for the sake of a noble subject matter.",1465516800,3,1341,4.349397590361446

7682471,4,B01CDT609K,"""Remember"", was a pleasant surprise I thought. Christopher Plummer is great as man on a mission to kill a former Nazi SS prison guard who murdered his family during the holocaust. CP was the epitome of cool when he was doing films in the 60's and he still can act. This film does an amazingly accurate portrayal of what 'dementia' looks like as we see Plummer struggle with his memory and mobility one minute, then be lucid and capable the next. Supported and directed on his quest by Martin Landau (who remains at the rest home they both reside in), Plummer eventually finds his prey, and that's when the film gets REALLY interesting.

7682498,5,B01CDT609K,"With the gradual dying out of the people who lived the Second World War stories and remembrances of these times start to fade.  In this remarkable movie in which Christopher Plummer plays an elderly Jewish man seeking a Nazi who was responsible for the deaths of his family in Germany more than 70 years hence we see that what transpired has not been forgotten by the participants.  Well in seeing this movie that may not really be true.  Memories sometimes play tricks on ones mind and remembrances may not be what they seem to be.
 The film has the character played by Plummer being guided by a disabled friend played by Marin Landau to follow all leads in search of this Nazi tormentor.  The story seems to be very predictable but in fact has many twists and turns made during his cross country search.  Plummers character has the beginnings of dementia so the instructions given by his disabled friend must be concise and clear.
 With all the twists and turns, the finale will leave you stunned.  This movie was well done and it is well worth watching.  To this day the search for these criminals continues as we see men and women in their 90s being tried and convicted of Nazi War Crimes.",1464912000,,1193,4.563380281690141

7682545,4,B01CDT609K,"Christopher Plummer plays an aging Holocaust victim who has dementia and has just lost his wife.  Prior to losing his wife, he promised to himself and a fellow resident (Martin Landau) at his nursing home to find the Nazi who killed his family at Auschwitz.  Since he has dementia, Landau writes down the steps in a letter, and Plummer follows them across the country to try to find the Nazi and kill him.
  I found the movie engrossing because of Plummer's performance, and I was willing to suspend my disbelief that a person with dementia would act this way or be able to cross the country with or without instructions--it's like the Bourne Trilogy in which the Bourne loses all his past memory for dramatic purposes, only more so because Plummer is supposed to be debilitated in the present by his disease and yet accomplishes some difficult tasks.  If you know someone with dementia, however, this particular trope may be too much to accept.
  Unlike many reviewers, I found the climatic ending unsatisfying.  It's not so much that it's been done before and the climatic scene was a little stilted in my opinion, but that Plummer's character was unmotivated by anything other than shock and maybe one earlier scene.  That's not enough.  We need to know more about his life after leaving Germany.  Having written that, it was an interesting movie about revenge and justice.  The only scene I could have done without was Landau explaining everything at the very end.  I suppose the director thought it necessary to show it wasn't dementia and who plotted the whole thing, but I didn't like it.",1464393600,,1595,4.7773722627737225

The filmmaker just added a piano?  Like a person would walk into somebodies house and just play Wagner ? The film dragged on in my opinion and the characters were not developed at all.

befriends fellow patient 'Zev Guttman' (Christopher Plummer) who he's recognised from those those dark days of
70 years ago.
'Zev' has dementia and forgets things very easily including the loss of his wife 'Ruth' in recent times.
'Max' continually reminds 'Zev' that their families were murdered at the camp by Blockfuher 'Otto Wallisch' who
had emigrated to America all those years ago and has lived there ever since avoiding detection and punishment .
Revenge is very much on 'Max's' mind, though he is unable to seek out 'Otto' himself he convinces 'Zev' that he
should take up the challenge of hunting-down and administering justice on the war-criminal.
Much information has been gathered by 'Max' as he's found numerous locations where 'Otto' may be under an assumed
name, he writes down the locations and detailed list of instructions for 'Zev' to read over and over again to remind him of
his task.
He's been given the addresses of four possibles living under the name of 'Rudy Kurlander' and sets off on his journey....
he will frequently forget where he is or why he is there, only the letter will remind him of his aim.
He has purchased a firearm to carry out the task if and when he finds the target, his travels take him far and wide including
over the border into Canada though his first three contacts prove to not be who he seeks.
Meanwhile back in New York his son 'Charles' is going frantic, his father has walked out of the care-home and disappeared
without warning, the one pe, rson who has the answers 'Max' is saying nothing.
When 'Charles' finally gets a hint of where his father is, 'Zev' is on his way to confront a fourth 'Rudy Kurlander'.....will he
get there in time to prevent his father from administering justice ?
This is a superb tense and well portrayed drama with veteran actor 'Christopher Plummer' playing the role of 'Zev' magnificently.
A suspenseful  film with an unexpected twist in the tail......well worth a viewing.",1463875200,61,2066,4.869318181818182

I thought it would basically be about an elderly Jewish man, living in a nursing home, who, after reading a letter, decides to get his vengeance on the Nazi who murdered his family. Well, yes. It is about that, but very different in character studies, with more than one twist. You know that the movie will not be elating, nor is there any humor. It is however, extremely emotional, leaving me weeping. It is filled with jarring scenes and some of the best acting you'll ever want. I strongly urge you to see this movie.

7682597,1,B01CDT609K,"I love Christopher Plummer but this movie was a waste of his talents. I knew the entire story line within 10 minutes of the start. Christopher Plummer's character didn't seem to know it because he stumbled through the film like he was in a daze even though everyone else who watches the film should know immediately what's going on. If you ever saw the movie ""Angel Heart"" with Mickey Rourke and Robert De Niro or ""Memento"" with Guy Pearce and Joe Pantoliano then you know how Remember will end. Unfortunately though, unlike those movies, this film has only a few dramatic moments and the best one doesn't come until the very end of the movie.

Some people might think I'm being insensitive because this film deals with the Holocaust, but I really am not. I've seen tons of Holocaust movies that were extremely powerful and moving. But Remember isn't one of them. There is no character development at all so you have no emotional connection to Zev Guttman, the character played by Plummer, or his son, or Martin Landau who is one of Plummer's friends in the nursing home. And after about 20 mins, you get tired of watching Plummer try to figure out what is happening to him. He's losing his mind and you are being bored to tears. There is a surprise character by Dean Norris who played the DEA brother-in-law in Breaking Bad. In fact, the scenes with Plummer and Norris are some of the best ones in the movie. But they come too late in the film.

I'm sorry, I cannot recommend Remember. It's very important not to forget the subject matter, but the movie will vanish from your memory shortly after you see it.",1463097600,2,1609,4.56401384083045

Christopher Plummer is Zev Guttman, an old man suffering from senile dementia.  He is an Auschwitz survivor who recently lost his wife Ruth. He is in a nursing home in which he befriends Max (Martin Landau), another Auschwitz survivor who lost his entire family.  Max convinces Zev to hunt down Rudy Kurlander, the man responsible for killing off their families, but there are five Kurlanders across the country.  Which one is the one?  He visits each one and crosses them off the list.

Zev has a mission to fulfill and despite his dementia, remains calm and committed.  People are willing to help him.  His search takes him across the country and even into Canada.

When he finally meets the real Kurlander, well, pay attention.",1528416000,,936,4.75776397515528

And no you cannot just stroll into a gunshop and show your driving license and walk out with a Glack 9mm, while displyng obvious signs of dementia to the shopkeeper, and no he will not thrust a gun upon you to make a quick buck.

I am familiar with EVERYthing portrayed in this piece of crap, and was a private eye for decades (know where everything is and how it all works), and I can tell you this plodding mess seems to be a bunch of made up garbage that should not interest even a Captain Planet/Mr. Rogers Millennial. It distorts reality beyond a breaking point and is clearly part of what has sunk America into utter confusion and chaos, to the point where They will now be mixing Mileys urine into the plastic of her next CDas a marketing Plus (benefit).

Good Luck with that....
