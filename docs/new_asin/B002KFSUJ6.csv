3940200,3,B002KFSUJ6,"I see how this could be good for someone at the very beginning stages of playing the bass, for myself I'm just a couple of notches above that and it was too elementary.  I watched about the first 3-4 lessons (weeks) and realized it was not for me.  I did send it back to Amazon within 2 days and was charged a 50%restocking fee, read the return policy, my bad!  Knowing that I should have kept it and given it away, live and learn.  For Jason Shepard, I think the camera position could have been placed better to see your fingers more easily",1393286400,3,541,4.223300970873787

3940202,4,B002KFSUJ6,am fairly new to the bass and this helps with lessons that I haven't tried and am still working through it,1382054400,,106,4.095238095238095
3940203,5,B002KFSUJ6,"This is a bass guitar course for folks who don't like to mess around. It gets right to the lessons with little if any needless banter from the talented instructor. It's broken up into eight ""weeks"" or lessons, designed to get you up and playing in said amount of weeks. I find if you study each lesson for a few weeks to a month you will get more from them. All told, this is a solid, well laid out approach to learning the basics of playing a bass guitar, and you can't ask for more for the price. Try this one out, you won't be disappointed.",1380844800,5,543,4.132075471698113

3940206,5,B002KFSUJ6,I ordered this for my friend.  He is loving it and thinks that he will be playing real good in no time.  It came even faster than we thought.,1368144000,,141,3.8275862068965516

3940208,4,B002KFSUJ6,"Jason, the instructor, is sincere and easy to follow.  It appears he is producing this DVD himself.  I have just started with the program so more comments are sure to follow.

Initially, I had thought there was a missing lesson.  All eight lessons are included.  It is the labeling scheme that makes the trouble.  Chapter 3 has Week 2.  Chapter 8 has Week 7, etc.  There is no Chapter 9. The chapter that has Week 8 does not show up on Windows Explorer.  Using Media Player 11, Week 8 shows up as Chapter 1 of Title 2.  Seems like a complicated way to solve a simple problem.

The lessons themselves cover about ten minutes each.  Within each lesson, Jason shows tablature for the exercises for each lesson.  The tabs and other info are in .sxc format rather than the widely used .pdf. Jason includes the program for Open Office 1 which will display the .sxc files.  One file alone with this program is over 132,000 kb.  This is many times larger than the whole set of tabs would be in .pdf. If the files were in .pdf, the user would not have to add yet another uncommon program. This is another case of using a complicated way to solve a simple problem.

For the price, though, an excellent bargain.  I will give it four stars, primarily for the quality of the lessons themselves but minus one for the technical errors. Credit Jason though.  He is working to solve the problems and I am sure he will succeed.",1335484800,7,1409,4.416342412451362

8371949,5,B002KFSUJ6,"After I borrowed a copy from the local library, I bought this directly from Jason's website. I am a brand new beginner and found the lessons easy to understand and the material very useful. I especially appreciated the large-print tablature sheets of the exercises and songs he has for download. It's giving me a good start already.",1429228800,,332,4.842105263157895
8371950,5,B002KFSUJ6,"""Learn To Play Bass Guitar in Eight Weeks"" by Jason Shepherd

If you are new to the bass guitar, get this video and practice, practice, practice. Eight lessons for the cost of  'one private lesson', plus email support with the teacher. If you are serious about playing bass guitar... Buy it!

I bought a bass guitar a few years ago and never got the hang of it. Although I play six-string guitar and understand music fundamentals, I could not get a technique that was good enough to play in a band. I soon realized that I needed basic instruction on how to play correctly. I can't read music, however with Jason's video reading music was not totally necessary. Jason's ""Learn To Play Bass Guitar in Eight Weeks"" gave me the instruction that I needed to progress. He starts out slow the first two weeks with the very basics and by week eight, you can play some cool bass lines. 12 Bar Blues, triplets, slapping. He starts out slow but moves along pretty quickly to Week Seven and Eight to more advanced bass playing. In Week Six he teaches some very cool bass parts, Power Chords, it was very cool. The instruction kept me interested enough to progress and be a better beginning bass player. You need to practice the lessons over and over or you may not make and progress. Buy the video, practice with your friends and stay commited to playing and start a band. Just Do It!

PS If you can get the exercises perfected, you will be playing bass guitar.",1428537600,2,1449,4.498098859315589

8371955,5,B002KFSUJ6,"I was quite impressed by the content of this DVD. Jason seems to have a real passion for teaching others and is quite thorough, yet to the point, which makes things easy to understand for the beginning learner. I appreciate the time and effort he has obviously put into this, which will (hopefully) allow for this mother of four to fulfill her dream of being able to play the bass guitar. I like that, with this DVD, I am able to practice at home without having to spend time and money on a private tutor. One thing that I feel would be an improvement, however, would be a slowed-down repeat at the end of the lesson, showing what to practice for the week. I found myself skipping back on the DVD a few times during the lesson to make sure I was doing it correctly. Keep in mind, that I am completely new at playing bass, so I am sure that I will gain confidence and get better/faster with practice.

I have just begun the program and will edit my review if my opinion changes once I have completed it.",1393718400,3,1002,4.273684210526316
8371956,5,B002KFSUJ6,Learned more than I thought I would...I just started playing the bass right when i received this lesson video and I can't even believe that I was going to try to learn through YouTube tutorials..I didn't even know where to begin with tuning let alone playing..I've learned a tonnn!
