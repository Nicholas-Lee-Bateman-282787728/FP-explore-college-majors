7983898,2,B00008G8Q4,"The animation looks like horse garbage or at least like some lame cut scene from a then current era video game. Most of the story line is a little jumbled due to this being tied to a game. The acting isn't very good on either version of this thing, though the English dubbing is worse. This actually manages to be worse than ADV's Tekken The Motion Picture. Why is there a mercenary guy (voiced by Spike ""Shinji Ikari"" Spencer) in this fantasy RPG anime that has a gun and looks like he belongs in a Resident Evil game? The bad guy is also very cliched but that's only a minor thing. The whole thing looks like an eyesore at multiple points that I can only compare to the equally awful OVA Early Reins which had similar visual problems.",1498003200,,736,4.340579710144928

For centuries they ruled, and now a hero has discovered a sword that could kill their master, and give the humans an edge in the war. -summary

Neverland... heh, lol. Wow...

...Anyway, I still can't believe ADV films would actually allow their name to be mentioned on the same cover art as this monstrosity, not to mention even green lighting this thing at all. Make no mistake, Spectral Force is nothing short of a disaster that goes completely wrong in every category you can think of. I still hold Art of Fighting as the absolute worst anime I have ever seen, and its held that title on lock for about well over a decade. At this point, I kind of think it's never going to be dethroned; but Spectral Force is one of those anime titles that introduces whole new levels of suck in its own way, and it's pretty damn close to giving the aforementioned title a run for the championship. In any case, it's definitely in my top 3 of worst anime I have ever seen and this is no exaggeration.

Spectral Force is a fantasy anime based on a video game (well imagine that!) that suffers from a very poor sense of direction. The anime has enough plot twist and characters to fit a 26 episode series format, which is beyond bad since the thing clocks in at 50 minutes. Many situations occur, many characters attempt to do different things, many battles take place, and almost nothing is properly fleshed out or concluded all that well.

Let's see, I'll begin with the characters. Well for one thing, there are just way too many of them, and none of them are interesting in the least. They're just all around terrible and only one is somewhat developed. I already forgot the name of the main character, and I can't quite recall if all of the others were even named at all. The anime attempts to accomplish so many things, but turns out rushing and cramming everything in by the end, which results in a truncated opened ending.

For a fantasy anime, there is just no creativity or imagination at all. The broken and busted plot limps into one segment after the other, and the horrendous character interactions have absolutely no energy; this is mainly due to yeah, the horrible characters of course, but it's also because of the atrocious dialouge and voice acting. The writing is just awful; characters who appear to play in the major story, soon fall into bit roles after playing in a major sequence, and it's also unclear on who is the real threat. Supposedly, the humans are the worst of the three evils, while the demons are the worlds best hope. If this is the case; then why is the human who discovers the sword considered a hero? Could this thing be playing off the adage; one person's patriot is another ones terrorist? I doubt this completely since the entire work has been mapped out so poorly.

Visually, it's just as horrible as everything else. For a 2003 anime OVA, there is just no excuse for visuals like this. The animation does not blend well with the CG, in fact, I don't think they tried to blend it at all. The backgrounds are CG and the character designs are just there, it's hard to explain just how bad this looks at times. Forget about decent action scenes, a lot of it is poorly choreographed, while the rest is unseen with stills on static backgrounds, and if that isn't bad enough, there's even one scene where a still character is slowly moving in the background to its desired point. Can you believe something like this? Outside of the wretched ending theme, I didn't even notice the BGM.

It's said to understand Spectral Force one must be familiar with the game. This is never a good approach. Video games to movies really should have content that appeals to both parties; fans and non fans. If developers are only going to bother with fans of the game, then perhaps they should start bundling these movies with their video game counter-part, to spare the non fans unnecessary suffering; but seriously speaking, even if this wasn't based on a video game it really wouldn't be any better.

After watching more than 400 anime titles, I can say Spectral Force is too close to the very bottom of the barrel. Honestly, the only reason why I consider Art of Fighting worse is because I would have to watch it again to be completely sure, and I have no desire to do that. All jokes aside, you can walk into any anime section and pick up something better than this blindfolded. Avoid.

7983901,1,B00008G8Q4,"This has to be the worse ""anime"" I have ever seen in 17 years of watching anime. Not only didn't the story make any sense the animation has to be some of the worse I have ever seen. Not just bad animation, but poorly lit, I swear a few of the pieces were cut outs. I generally will do everything I can to watch an anime, and rarely turn it off midway, but this garbage I did. Avoid this title at all cost!!!",1358899200,,407,3.9156626506024095

It also features Chick, from Spectral Souls 3 along with some other notable characters from that title. My gripe is that this is a 2002 ADV DVD, which means it was a straight transfer from VHS to DVD, no clean up, or quality check. I own quiet a few DVD's from ADV that are from that time period and most of them are crap quality. The saving grace? It cost me a dollar, yes a dollar. So any fan of the Games who wanted to learn more about Hiro/Hillo and the events of the Overlords death (because the games were vague on some points)then you should buy this, it answers questions and won't break the bank.",1219622400,3,1340,5.638613861386139
7983903,1,B00008G8Q4,"This anime barely rises to the level of mediocrity. There is nothing truly objectionable -- it only feels like you are watching over the shoulder of someone playing a (boring) video game! There are only two episodes on the DVD, so there is little to watch in any case.
The Heroine's father, Demon King for 999 years, sits in a deserted castle and allows four (4!) humans to kill him with a magic sword. He can teleport away, but decides to let them stick him so the ""too powerful"" weapon is removed from the world. How (ahem) noble! The heroine's older sister, the only other person in the castle, gets cut down as well... The King's army is off chasing the routed human army it seems, but where is the domestic help?
With such oddities as a short human mercenary with a automatic pistol in each hand -- but no other firearms of ANY type... An insane elder brother who shows up to derail the battle in Episode 2 after the usual ""Evil Tyrant Oration""... Bah! Save your money for some other DVD...
I would suggest ""Iria:Zeiram the Animation"" if you want to see a spunky girl kick alien butt. Or ""Shadow Skill"" for magic and martial arts, or ""Outlaw Star"" if you would like some zany fun. But run, do not walk, away from this one!",1060819200,9,1227,4.409691629955947
