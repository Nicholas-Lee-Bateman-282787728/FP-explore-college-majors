3118877,3,B0013PSTMC,"Gattaca is not original aspect ratio (1.33:1 rather than 2.35:1). You can see this if you zoom in on the product photos, but just thought it should be noted. I think we are missing out on a lot of film screen. Otherwise, the movies provide some good reflection time on one's own life possibilities.

I prefer the alternative ending (included) for The Forgotten because it is more consistent with the rest of the movie. A real ""downer"" but necessarily so.

Appreciating Gattaca is enhanced with some basic knowledge of genetics. It, too, is a dismal world, but that's what makes it interesting.

Good acting all around.",1384473600,3,618,4.811320754716981
3118878,5,B0013PSTMC,I show this movie to my AP biology class each year and I used to rent it each time. I finally decided to buy it and this copy works great!,1372982400,2,138,3.6333333333333333
3118879,5,B0013PSTMC,"You can't go wrong. They're both awesome movies and putting them together makes this even better. The two movies are a bit different from each other, one being a little more supernatural and the other being sci fi, but the complement well. Plus, the actors who star in both are amazingly talented and put on a good show.",1369094400,,320,4.5344827586206895
3118880,4,B0013PSTMC,"The Forgotten is a very interesting concept and a good film, Gattaca is OK not much more than that. I would say to scifi fans it is worth the price.",1368921600,,148,3.966666666666667

8252669,5,B0013PSTMC,I use Gattaca in a lesson plan wrapping up genetics and generic engineering in my high school Biology classroom. Highly recommended!,1500681600,,132,5.333333333333333

It stays with you. Valuable insights.
Both movies are interesting.",1451520000,,124,5.578947368421052
8252673,5,B0013PSTMC,"The Forgotten-story is electrifying and Julianne Moore has become one  of the few actresses on my list of SEE EVERYTHING.
The sci fi nature of the movie is very important, of course, but Julianne as a distraught mother who never gives up is astonishing.
Worth every viewing--many many times.

8252675,4,B0013PSTMC,I teach a Biomedical class and it is perfect to show genetic selection of individuals and what we may be looking at in the future. My students really like the movie. I have never heard a complaint about it.,1410912000,,206,4.3076923076923075
8252676,4,B0013PSTMC,"Jusr loved the movie,  both Uma and Ethan are really cute!!! Great off beat plot!!!
I am a SYFY nut....so really enjoyed it!!  Also, was surprised that it was a double
feature, did not expect The Forgotten with Julianne Moore.  So, again, it was double
the fun!!!!",1396915200,,264,4.574468085106383
8252677,5,B0013PSTMC,"This is an incredible double feature, but especially when it comes to Gattaca, a favorite of mine, it is so pertinent to today's questions of ethics and personal determination.  Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, and Jude Law do a beautiful job acting.  If we have all of our genomes mapped, will this happen to us in the future?  This is thought provoking and enjoyable to talk about.",1394668800,,376,4.666666666666667
8252678,5,B0013PSTMC,"Bundling of movies at a good price always works...you get more bang for your buck. Definately Julianne Moore and "" Forgotten "" is the headliner of the two however Uma Thurman and Jude Law in "" Gattaca "" is right up the Blade Runner's alley.
