8370290,5,B002HFWB0I,I received all 3 blu ray in a bundle like shown. Although my husband did bring to my attention that it was in English but also French. As a DVD enthusiast he did not want to add this to his collection and is in the process of returning. For someone who does not mind having both versions this is exactly what it should be.,1389744000,,322,4.046875

8370292,3,B002HFWB0I,"I am always looking to buy the best product for my money.  In this case i was excited to find a triple pack of these great films being about under $15 each. My hesitation was that it was a mixed region collection and i was worried that they would not play on my Bluray player.  So when i was finally got them i was eager to test them. Everything turned out good except the disc region notes telling me that the disc's may take longer during chapter sequences to load depending on the Bluray player models.  Kill Bill vol. One had a ""skip"" like problem during the beginning of the movie but other than that all three disc's where good.  It did worry me so i felt like that was the chance i had taken being this a mixed U.S/Canadian region combo pack.",1302220800,2,749,4.216783216783217
