8481171,5,B005OCJRI0,"Coming from a known/respected reporter, as something he himself experienced, along with the fact that the subjects ALL were disbelieving themselves, had it not ended up happening to them as well, made this a special report/documentary.  The reporter (who before it happening to him would probably had not had any interest in doing this filming) gives his own account of his own Near Death Experience in addition to interviewing others.

I'm sure that people who ""hear"" of such experiences and that are intelligent, logical-brained people such as i consider myself, might blow them off as crazy and not worthy to know.......this report, and so many others that have surfaced, will change your mind, most likely, in blowing off the idea of a near death experience being ""real"".

This ""news"" could be, quite possibly, the biggest discovery, with real PROOF of some sort, that we have for the biggest subject known to mankind since the history of mankind - what happens after death?  The reporter didn't cover this, but the Egyptians  knew of this ""phenomenon"" and killed thousands to study it and the Egyptian scribes WROTE IT DOWN back then - this isn't ""new"" - but it IS more common due to the great ability, nowadays, to bring back a flat-lined person.  The Egyptians knew of this, as did Elisabeth Kubler-Ross (famous psychiatrist/medical doctor), who did the second very comprehensive world-wide study done int he 40's? (not sure of the decade) - it's not ""new"" and it's not ""new age"" bunk - it's somethign that has been known to happen WAY back and written/studied even, only NOT to the degree it does nowadays...why?  Nowadays we can shock hearts back to life, and medical technology has made sure that many CAN ""come back"" - something we couldn't do to this degree, a century ago - so that is why it's become a ""thing"" - but no, it's not new, it happened to our ancestors' generations....and since the dawn of mankind - and there are ancient studies to prove that as well.

Strange, but seemingly true.  Biggest news of the world, as far as I can see - which many are blowing off because they haven't looked into it or know the long histoiry of it.  This series and the others done on it in the ""I Survived...Beyond and Back"" are must-sees to see what the ideas of this are - see for yourself.",1523232000,,2298,4.708229426433915
8481172,4,B005OCJRI0,"Primetime Nightline's Beyond Belief: Near Death Experiences aired on August 3, 2011 but it is still very relevant years later. Bob Woodruff hosts this program and he himself had an out-of-body experience. So he interviews a variety of people who either believe what happened to them was a dream or a real experience.

Don Piper was interviewed for this program and I've seen his movie. It is truly a miracle that he is alive and walking around. As he says: ""It was the most real thing that ever happened to me."" Don would rather be in heaven but he is well aware of his mission while back here on earth. This program also has an interview with an atheist minister. She believes we have no control over where we go in the afterlife but most religious people would disagree with her.

So this program is balanced with beliefs from both sides. If you don't believe near-death experiences are real this might help shed some light on the matter. I found it was very well done and interesting.

8481175,4,B005OCJRI0,"This episode was hosted by Bob Woodruff (who as a reporter almost died in Iraq in 2006), and included interviews with Maryjo Papini a former nurse who dismissed dying patients comments about seeing the other side. Don Piper who wrote the books '90 Minutes in Heaven', 'Getting to Heaven' and 'Heaven is real' - about his car accident in 1989. Atheist Margaret Downing and her input, 'Erin' a 17 year old who was shot in the head and survived., Jake Finkbonner (sp?) who as a young boy suffered a flesh eating bacteria. Donna Morgan (a black lady) who sometimes speaks in tongues - goes through an MRI or Cat-scan to have her brain compared to (Atheist) Margaret Downing's brain - this performed by Dr Andrew Nuberg (sp?). NDE's are researched about them possibly being chalked up to biological reactions. They show the setup for an experiment - where they placed images or pictures in facing up at the ceiling in an operating room - in case the patient has an Near-Death experience - and can later confirm what the pictures are (I am not aware of an outcome/follow up to that). There is also a man - Chris Walker - who had a close call flying a helicopter. He didn't have an NDE - but his experience was parallel to those who do. Running time on this DVD-R is 40:36.
I think of this episode as a good general overview of this topic, to really do it justice I think it could be (should be) done in like a 4+DVD set. I have read many books on this topic - and was just left as how I started - wanting more.
On my personal ratings scale of 1 to 10 - I gave this one a 6.5.
I'm a bit torn - on one hand - it is well done - yet I want a longer deeper investigative story on this. If you haven't read on this topic - I think you will be pleased.
