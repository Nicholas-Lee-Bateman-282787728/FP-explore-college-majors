Body in numbers: our life in numbers  (1 episode). This part gives a bunch of totals, such as how much time sleeping in a lifetime, how much food eaten, how many heartbeats, enough breaths to power a plane so far,

Human body: Pushing the limits:
Sight  (1 episode)  interesting

Strength  (1 episode) interesting

The ultimate guide: human body  (1 episode)  haven't seen yet

The body invaders: allergies  (1 episode)  This one tells all about allergies & how sufferers can avoid coming into contact with them, how they cope.  Of course this being Discovery Channel it says nothing about  diet or artificial environments (so - 1 star).",1396569600,4,681,4.8
