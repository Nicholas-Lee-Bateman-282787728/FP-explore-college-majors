I don't understand where your head's at, but there's proof of teenage mental breakdowns because of your lack of action. I do not appreciate this lack of action, and want this to be addressed immediately.

film involves a serious topic which is bullying and the boy laughs at his uncomfortable situations,the kids around him are very mean and uncaring except for the blonde girl and his friend Rowley. The people that play his parents don't help him at all with his dilemma in school, and neither with the bullying from his brother. They are not good role models for them,they are not vigilant nor protect their older sons nor tutor them. They totally ignore his dilemma. Also his mother has her head in the clouds she worries too much about what others think of her. She is nevertheless a great cook and loving with her youngest son. The kid needed desperately counseling and switch to another school, one with a good atmosphere and isn't extremely strict. Those things are never mentioned in the movie. The boy plays anyway a very insecure and friendly kid though has too much time for mischief.",1481587200,,974,4.6686046511627906

Another dislike of mine was the elimination of the Angie Steadman character. In the original film, smart, witty, fasionable Angie was defintely my favorite character, hands down. She had great look on life and, let's face it. Chloe Grace Moretz is a revelation. I hated the fact that they replaced her with perfect, Mary Sue-like Holly Hills in this film.

The reason this movie gets a pretty good rating (for movie standards) is because it's a great look on how relationships with siblings and how crappy middle school can really be. 100% accurate on all accounts.",1369094400,,838,4.894366197183099

I really don't like Rodrick, but the movie is about siblings coming together to get along. I think all in all it's well cast, I love mom and dad.

4506549,3,B004Z7AHTI,"I found the picture to hit some of the high points of the novel but not enough. That said, it was innocent fun with some lightly amusing moments but nothing in regards to big time humor. Children will probably appreciate it more than adults, well, unless you like goofball and somewhat lame humor.

This is basically the life of Greg Heffley who talks about his trials and tribulations and the various family members holding him back in his life. There's a lot of twists and turns and as I already said I think the humor is more for the kids than the adults.

The budget for this film was $15M and it made over $75M at the Box Office. Based on a novel of a similar name by Jeff Kinney.

In this film, young Greg feels tortured by his older brother, Rodrick.  When their parents go out of town, Rodrick throws a party and Greg helps him hide the evidence.  When their parents find out, they both get in trouble and turn on one another.  Will they reconcile in the end or remain sworn enemies for life?

Sure, these are oft-used plot points, but they are tried and true for a reason.  Call me sappy, but I love to see sibling rivalry shine through in the end.

4506556,4,B004Z7AHTI,"""Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Rodrick Rules"" is one of the more under-rated surprise hit films of last year.  It made the number 1 slot for it's opening weekend at almost $25,000,000.00, a score very few films achieve.  It stole the opening week away from the favored and heavily marketed, lingerie clad bevy of beautiful Hollywood starlets who got ""Sucker Punched"" by ""The Wimpy Kid"".

The sequel to the very popular 2010 ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" movie, Rodrick Rules focuses on a different element than the first movie.  In the first movie, we find the main characters focus on surviving Middle School, relationships, bullies, family dynamics and popularity.  Both Wimpy Kid movies have been totally under-marketed and definately under-rated as films that are laugh-out-loud funny, relatable and deeply emotional to the masses of theater goers.

In a ""John Hughes"" style, Rodrick Rules focuses on family dynamics, relationships, sibling rivalry, and parental frustration at it's core.  Instead of a ""High School"" setting that Hughes found so relevant, Wimpy Kid goes deeper into the most troubled and difficult times of our lives -- Jr. High School/Middle School.  This is the jumping off point from childhood with no-where to jump for most of us.  You are no longer treated like a kid, yet your still not old enough to be a teenager or adult.  This is truely ""no-mans"" land and the both painful and growing up lessons we learned during this period have etched their mark on our very souls.

In DWK, Rodrick Rules, Mom (played delightfully by Rachel Harris), is trying so hard to get her two older sons to ""bond"" with one another.  She goes so far as to offer ""Mom Bucks"" (a sort of money payoff) if they spend time together or help each other.  This makes for a very funny ongoing set of comedic circumstances since the two brothers are about as far apart from each other as can be.  The middle son Greg Heffley (played brilliantly by an excellent kid actor - Zachary Gordon) is tormented most of the time by his older brother Rodrick (played wonderfully by Devon Bostick).  Rodrick would prefer to have nothing to do with his younger sibling, but Mom intervenes and forces the issue because it hurts her to see that they are so disconnected.  Dad (played understatedly well by Steve Zahn) sort of supports the mothers efforts, but really believes in his ""heart of hearts"" that mom's plan isn't going to work.  The whole cast is really exceptional and makes you believe in their struggles without much effort.

There are so many funny scenes in this movie, you have to pay attention or you will miss alot of them and the adult inuendo's that fly by at a moments notice.  The story is sensible, realistic, relatable, emotional and heartwarming all at the same time.  We have all lived thru these well played out scenarios in real life and it just makes the connection that much better for us in the film.  There is nothing, not to like about this movie or the first one.

This is a movie for all ages, well, let me qualify.  You have had to have survived or have an undertanding of Jr. High School or Middle School and some family dynamics in order to really connect with the first movie.  This doesn't apply as much to the second movie - DWK Rodrick Rules.  Also, you don't have to have seen the first one to enjoy the second.  If you allow yourself to slip into the movie, you will find yourself caught up in it's web of entertainment.  The movie is simply enjoyable, ""laugh out loud"" funny, it will keep your interest, it is paced well, and offers wholesome solid entertainment!

If you are looking for a 3D, computer animated special effects film, you won't find it here.  Instead you'll find a wholesome emotional rollercoaster of enjoyable film entertainment at it's core level.  They have cleverly crafted interactions of live action characters with some of the cartoon characters from the actual Book for a rather interesting effect.  The adaptation to screen is very close, probably the closest I have seen in a book adaptation to screen.  But don't worry, you do not have to read the books to understand these films.  These films are about life, growing up, heartbreak, and finding oneself.

You can watch this movie as a family, with a friend, or simply by yourself...you won't be disappointed!",1328745600,,4298,4.740242261103634

We don't have a Blu-Ray player yet, so I can't comment on the quality of the movie itself at this point. :)  The DVD when inserted starts buzzing wickedly and won't load on either a stand-alone DVD player or my computer drive.

Bought it for $10.99 on Thanksgiving and there's no way I'll find that price now.  To Amazon's credit, they did refund the difference to me to basically get me an even exchange, but now that the second one is bad too I'm not sure I want to risk it again.

4506566,5,B004Z7AHTI,"Alright, so perhaps I'm a wee bit too old to watch a movie like Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules.  I'm 30 years old.  Oh well.  For a fun and innocent teenage comedy, it's totally worth watching.  It's about a young man in 7th grade who has two problems.  One, he has a major crush on a beautiful blonde-haired girl and he wants to get her attention any way he can, and two, he gets picked on by his older brother *constantly* and frequently seeks out to try and get along with him (and their parents have the exact same desire).

Well the problem is, every time the boy tries to impress the girl, his older brother does something to humiliate him, which then usually shifts into an embarrassing adventure (for example, in one scene the older brother manages to get his younger bro to walk through a hotel in his underwear and threatens to spill the beans concerning this news to the blonde-haired girl at the end of the hallway involving a video tape that recorded this little mishap).

The best segment however, is the one where the parents force the two brothers to get along while the parents are out of town, and the parents are hoping spending much needed time together will finally make their relationship better, but... the brothers go against their parents wishes and throw a party at home, haha.  This turns out to be a pretty popular chunk of the storytelling- this one huge party, which translates into the two boys trying desperately to keep the news hidden from their parents and clean up the after effects of the party before the parents make a surprise phone call and announce they're coming home early.  A lot of funny things happen at this party, though.

Also some of the 7th graders friends are hilarious too, especially the one who unintentionally sits on a spiked ball!

What I find extremely bizarre is that the older brother looks EXACTLY like a young Mick Jagger!  Seriously, check out Mick Jagger from circa-1963.  You'll see a facial similarity!  Also, the father (played by Steve Zahn) looks exactly like an old friend of mine from 11th grade environmental science class who used to make funny/scary faces whenever I entered the room, lol.  Good memories.

Overall, Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules is most certainly a family movie, or more specifically, a movie for kids in between the ages of 5-15.  It's really funny though, and I wasn't expecting this at all.  I recommend it.",1324771200,,2414,4.626760563380282

4506568,3,B004Z7AHTI,"I didn't ever see the first Diary of a Wimpy Kid movie, but when my kids picked up Rodrick Rules, they insisted that I watch with them. I must admit that I found this to be more entertaining than I expected.

While it was filled with plenty of juvenile humor (which is alright...and I can enjoy it...hey, don't judge me), it also had some pretty witty writing and good acting to carry off both the verbal and physical jokes. As might be expected, the general plot was somewhat thin but still put forth an alright message to kids who were watching. While the family situation shown was somewhat dysfunctional, we have to acknowledge that every family is dysfunctional in some way. Thus, even through the slapstick and over-the-top story we can learn things about family values and loyalty and have a lot of fun laughing at the ridiculous situations.

Definitely not for everybody, but if you're willing to put up with middle-school humor and attitudes, you don't need to run away if your kids ask you to watch this with them.

Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules is a kid's movie, based on a book series written for kids but I have to say that both are thoroughly enjoyable for adults. I find the characters and their experiences relatable and even the most obnoxious characters (well, maybe not Patty), likeable. I do think that for the money there could have been more extras. I would have liked a little comic insert from Jeff Kinney or a Diary of a Wimpy Kid short at the beginning- something to justify the $16.79.",1316995200,,1050,5.55625

4506573,5,B004Z7AHTI,"The book was great, and the movie was good fun too, being a bit more plot-driven but with strong deviations from our visual/mental image of the characters. The interesting thing about the movie is that the people who play the characters are all the ages that they're supposed to be: the kid who plays Greg is 13, the kid who plays Roderick is 19, the woman who plays their mom is 43, and the guy who plays their dad is also 43.  Good casting, in other words.

Lots of funny moments, and Greg and Rowley's magic show is pretty classic: Rowley wants to make it serious, but of course with class clown Greg as his assistant it will never be that way. I like also the Loded Daiper song. But what I don't get is the fear that the kids show for their parents - these people are not scary parents!",1314230400,5,790,4.225165562913907

4506575,3,B004Z7AHTI,"Unlike the first Diary of a Wimpy Kid movie, the filmmakers were a little more brave this time around and strayed further away from the book. My main problem with the first movie was that EVERY joke and scene was from the book, and they often wern't exectued as well as they should have been. Rodrick Rules improves, but it still needs work. This time around, Greg is trying to impress Holly Hills and sometimes the movie turns a bit absurd. For instance, the party scene from the book goes WAY too far in the movie. I also thought the church scene was way too unrealistic. It's okay, though, and the story can be described as ""heartwarming"". Not a bad rental for families.",1312934400,2,673,4.479674796747967

Enjoyed this movie more than the original Diary of a Wimpy Kid movie.
Found it refreshing to watch a story about 2 brothers who learn to get along, as there aren't too many of those around.

Kids:
No need to close your eyes during the ""horror scene"", it is not scary.  Well, unless feet creep you out.
Story line doesn't follow book completely.

Parents:
This movie is PG for a reason, so watch it with your kids.  You'll want to stomp out any ideas that your kiddos get from watching this movie.  Rodrick is a prankster and poor role model.
I know my older boy had a glimmer in his eye when watching these boys pull over a few things on their parents.  Stomped those ideas out best I could.  Only time will tell.
I highly recommend you read these books if you haven't already.  We read these books out loud as a family and the Wimpy Series is the funniest material I've read in recent times.  Not sure you should be too impressed with that statement, but there it is.

Overall: I had my expectations set pretty low and walked away delighted with this movie.",1309910400,,1179,4.333333333333333

Wow, this movie was better than the first. I liked the first one, I thought the first one was good enough to buy on Blu-Ray, but this one, I would buy for regular price on Blu-Ray. It was really, really good. I really liked the relationship between the brothers.

If you have not seen the first one, then I highly recommend you do so before viewing this one. The first Diary of A Wimpy Kid was funnier than this film and also remained closer to its book counterpart. Rodrick Rules strays from the book, but shows more character development and plot than the first one did. The character development in this film is way better than the first installment. In Rodrick Rules, we get to watch Greg and Rodrick develop as not only brothers but as friends. We learn more about the characters and care about them more than ever. One problem is that Rodrick Rules is not as funny as the first film. Rodrick Rules has it fair share of jokes but it didn't have as many as the first. Whether this is a bad thing is entirely up to you. Another problem I see is that this movie does have its fair share of cliches which most movies now do have. The only other problem I see is that the dialogue can be corny and cheesy at times. The acting in this movie is fairly decent, not fantastic but not terrible. It gets the job done for a kids movie. Overall, I recommend you see this movie if you like the books or liked the first movie. Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules is a good family movie that people of all ages can enjoy.

8449481,5,B004Z7AHTI,"If I could rate something higher than five stars I would. This is simply masterful filmmaking and expert comedy, and it also has topical social commentary. This movie's stance and depiction of racism is highly commendable with the ""Invisible Chirag"" side-plot - metaphorizing how minorities often feel ""invisible"" in western cultures. The movie also gets a lot more enthralling and thought-provoking when you take into consideration the fan-theory that Greg, our lovable pre-teen protagonist, is actually a sociopath. This is where the acting comes in as my boi Zachary Gordon does an excellent job at portraying a young man who lives without guilt, always calculating his next victim to exploit. In fact, based on the performances and the fact that many mental disorders are hereditary (according to the diathesis-stress model), I would say that most of the Heffley family is suffering from mental illness. Greg's older brother, emo zaddy Rodrick Heffley, is likely also a sociopath as he shares Greg's tendency of pathologically lying; however, it's also evident from his poor judgment and that Rodrick suffers from intellectual disabilities (yet another amazing milestone as not many films are able to handle such topics). I would say that he's suffering from savant syndrome, which entails that while someone may have a low IQ, they are incredibly gifted, even genius, in one particular field - and if you've seen the finale of the film, you can clearly tell that Rodrick Heffley is prolific in singing, songwriting, and percussion in his musical stint ""Loded Diper"" (the spelling again showing that he's one cognitively deficient boi).  His father, Frank the dilf, is overly neurotic and most likely has Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (who can forget when he was not only upset that Greg had moved his high-quality porcelain Civil War-era figurines, but he was also overly-insistent that his family not refer to them as ""toys""?). And his mother is just a plain biotch. This movie - no, this film, illustrates so many complicated social issues, develops nuanced character arcs, and displays pitch-perfect relatable humor (sometimes all at once), all components that make this novel adaptation an adventure for the family to enjoy!",1524268800,,2233,5.254901960784314
