8045044,1,B00076R686,"Three bitter young men without any real message or artistic inspiration insulting two entire counties while managing to miss everything that is actually interesting, humorous, unique or annoying about said counties. On top of that, the video has the worst production value in history.  I could make a better film in ten minutes using my phone's video function.  Quite possibly the stupidest thing I've ever seen in my entire life.  You are better off wasting the hour watching you tube videos.  At least there you will get some variety.",1417564800,,536,4.98876404494382
8045045,3,B00076R686,"Being from Humboldt County, I've always been fascinated by the absolutely absurd combination of people found there:  lurker hippie scum, ruthless white trash, and clueless yuppie-hippies.

Having found ""The Humboldt County Travelogue"" out there (albiet a few years after it came out) I was immediately excited.  Finally, I figured, someone has taken it upon themselves to document exactly how strange this obscure piece of California is.

What I was hoping for was a documentary that examined the descent into self-parody that Humboldt County really is, along with a simultaneous descent into despair, regret and drunkeness on the part of the documentors as they got deeper into it.  When they went thru that debacle that the Drive-Thru Tree is, I felt like they were off to a good start.  Then, with several near altercations with hippies caught on film, there was definitely potential to take the film over the top -- but fuled by the poor editing and lack of balls of the film crew, it never happened.

I can only hope that a Part II or something along those line will eventually be made, and if this is the case, with a better plan, more variety of debauchery, and a little more ""take charge"" attitude on the part of the participants.  I know it will probably never happen, but I can only appeal to the producers of this DVD:  This is an idea that absolutely NEEDS to happen.  The world really needs to know the truth behind Slumboldt County.

Unfortunately, this documentary fell short.",1136246400,3,1491,4.830708661417323
