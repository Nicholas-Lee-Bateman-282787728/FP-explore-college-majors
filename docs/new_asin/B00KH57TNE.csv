6426436,4,B00KH57TNE,"====UPDATE====
Having had a chance to actually watch this box set, I have to update this review because I am greatly disappointed by the subtitle quality. There is absolutely no consistency in the translation effort. Why the heck did you translate it to Queen, Prince, and all other English title but kept ""mikado"" (emperor)?
This surfaces in other places like names of destination as well. They kept almost every place (e.g. Yashiro village) in its Japanese name, yet, translated Aogiri into ""Misty Blue mountain."" I'm not saying these translations are not correct, but it's not consistent. I mean, if you were a first time viewer and had absolutely no knowledge of the Japanese language and read ""the mikado wants the prince dead"", you'd wonder who the heck is this ""mikado"" guy is. At least, put a note overhead the first time to note ""mikado"" is the ruler of the state.

Seriously, I never considered watching dub save for the really good work in Cowboy Bebop (and maybe Black Lagoon), but I might have to switch to dub on this blu-ray. The subtitle just annoys the hell out of me. Took one star off for this very reason.

======================
Original review:

Excellent series. Others have detailed nicely about what the show entails so I'll spare you my writing. I wanna note about the quality of the Blu-ray (which I got on sale for $27 - awesome value!).
Very crisp, nice quality picture. I have just a slight complaint about the package is that it's surprisingly fragile. The outer edge of the box broke as I tried to open the plastic wrap. Not a huge deal broker but I wish it was more durable.",1505088000,,1607,4.691489361702128

6426439,5,B00KH57TNE,"I have this on DVD, but I had to get the Blu-ray version because it is one of my favorite animes. The story is terrific and the voice acting (in English) is outstanding. I love the drawing, and how the story paced itself. There are many likable characters and they all played well together. This is something I almost wished that Harry Potter had been done in this manner. (As many of us believe, the first couple of movies of Harry Potter  the acting of the young actors were pretty much horrible.)",1478131200,,499,4.423913043478261

6426520,5,B00KH57TNE,"This has to be my all time favorite series, due to many different reasons. I'll go into why without giving away too much story plot.

Balsa: She is the best female lead I've seen in anime so far. She is such a wonderfully layered woman. Strong, intelligent, kind, empowered, and doesn't seem to let anyone drag her spirit down.
The characters are lovable/fascinating, and there is great character development.
Art style, action sequences, sound quality, voice acting, and story is simply superb.
The story is very well done, and draws you inside the world very quickly. No weird loopholes/stuff that just randomly happens with no explanation.
There are many metaphysical hints dropped throughout the series.

I've recommended this series to many friends, and all of which enjoyed this series immensely. I wish I could give it a higher rating.",1423267200,6,842,5.0503597122302155
6426521,3,B00KH57TNE,"I just wanted to write a quick bluray spec info review for those interested in buying this Viz Media Edition of Moribito Complete Series Colleciton.

As most should know, the older, superior Media Blaster releases are I believe out of print and are extremely hard to come by. Volume 2 not so much, as it goes for an incredibly cheap price, but Volume 1 goes for a ridiculously high amount, why I'm not sure.
Viz Media obtained the video rights to Moribito after Media Blasters and decided to put out a complete collection for those who didn't have an opportunity to get the now ""rare"" Media Blasters set.

The video is 1080p as opposed to the previous 1080i (although if you read the bluray.com review of the older set, the reviewer goes on for great detail as to how despite the video being interlaced, it is one of the best interlaced productions he had seen and could not imagine it looking better than what it was already at), and though it should ideally be the same transfer just in progressive, I'm not 100% of the quality of the re-encode.

The sound is the biggest kicker, however, despite the fact that you still get English subtitles. The older release had DTS-HD MA 2.0/5.1 for both English AND Japanese. This new set is simply ""English and Japanese 2.0 Audio"" on the slipcover. Again, this information I only found on bluray.com, but I will try to upload the image from said site so all can see! Now, what this means is anyone's guess, 2.0 Stereo Dolby Digital (a  lossy audio format) or TrueHD 2.0, DTS-HD MA 2.0 or PCM 2.0 (these last three are lossless audio formats). If you are of the type that wants discreet surround sound and an immersive experience, it might be worth hunting down the older Media Blaster set. If not, and you're happy with running the 2.0 audio through an AV Receiver and turning on Dolby Pro Logic II and matrixing the audio to 5.1, then this set should be good for you.
I'm of the true 5.1 discreet variety, so I went and hunted down the older set which I know has the outstanding 1080i (yes, interlaced) video and the DTS-HD MA 2.0/5.1 Audio for both languages.

In terms of extras, everything from the older set seems to have been carried over, which is good, since we anime folks like our extras!

Finally, the series is spread over four bluray discs, just like the old set, so hopefully quality is maintained and not lost, when going from interlaced to progressive during re-encoding. It shouldn't, but sometimes these companies don't have access to the original HD masters and they have to work off of the 480p DVD masters instead or re-encode a 1080i master, which isn't a true 1080p source as far as I'm concerned.

All in all, this should be useful for those trying to decide between hunting down the older set or if they want to save some money and go for the newer one.

Again, not a review in terms of the show, you can read other people's reviews for content, this is merely a bluray spec review. I hope it's been helpful! If you have any questions or comments or corrections, please let me know in the comments below! Thank you!",1420156800,9,3082,4.520646319569121
6426522,5,B00KH57TNE,Fantastic series!!!!!  I am not as avid an anime watcher as my boyfriend but even I enjoyed this series immensely!,1419811200,,114,4.7
6426523,5,B00KH57TNE,"First, there is NOTHING at all wrong with the show. In fact, it is one of my all time favorites. However, I must say that if you are someone who wants to save money, then this is why the DVD and the Blu ray must be studied. I have both versions, since this show is so dear to me, and I hardly notice a difference in picture quality in the blu ray. The bluray ONLY has stereo tracks, the dvd has both stereo and surround. To change the languages, you have to stop the anime, go back to the menu, switch the languages and start over. It can get pretty annoying. The older DVD version has NONE of these setbacks, and the quality is not drastically different. Regardless, the DVD quality is pretty amazing, and if you are someone who appreciates amazing scenery and gorgeous, detailed animation, you cannot go wrong with the DVD. If none of the setbacks to the blu ray bother you, then I urge you to pick up an anime that deserves to be on everyone's top list.

Why watch? Steeped in Japanese folklore, and having similar vibes to Princess Mononoke and Avatar the Last Airbender and The Legend of Korra, you already are having high expectations. This is one of those hidden gems in anime that for some strange reason, never got the attention it rightfully deserved. My parents are appalled by my love for anime, so when I say that they sat down, watched this with me IN JAPANESE and said that they actually ENJOYED it...well, what can I say?  So, I finally got my friends to sit down as well, and they ALSO LIKED IT!! Who knew? :D

Chagum is the second prince, and Balsa is his bodyguard. She once killed 8 very dear people, and vowed to save the lives of eight people to make up for her sins. So, the Queen entrusts her with her son, because his own father must kill him, for a water spirit is inside the prince. This water spirit is thought to be the cause of the droughts that happen every 100 years, and according to tradition, the father must kill the son to vanquish the evil spirit. But is this really true? This is a show that boasts an epic story and soundtrack, some of the BEST characters in anime, amazing animation and stunning fight scenes. Granted, the show likes to develop its characters more and explore the legends surrounding the water spirit and the world, but when the fight scenes happen IT IS FREAKING EPIC.

Dub or Sub? To be honest, you can choose either as they are pretty good! However there are a few things the dub has that might cut it: Prince Chagum is whiny in the dub and sounds....really bad to be honest. Balsa is very emotionless as is Tanda, and that might leave you wondering if they really care about what's going on. It feels a little awkward listening to such monotone voices. In the Sub, Balsa does have a strong, somewhat detached voice, but it's more human and has emotion. The Prince sounds dignified and perfect for his role. I am not one to dismiss a good dub when I hear one, but I did have to point these out.

If you liked Princess Mononoke, or Avatar, or Korra, or are looking for a hidden gem that will keep you mesmerized after the last episode, that will crush you, rip your feels out and question what it means to value someone's life, this is your anime!",1414800000,25,3207,4.365159128978225
6426524,5,B00KH57TNE,"This is a remarkable story to say the least. no amount of superlatives do it justice. It is an original story, that it beautifully written directed and voiced. As a martial arts instructor and practitioner for over 2 decades, I found this story exceptionally moving and inspirational, with regards to its themes about duty, bravery sacrifice and combat in general. Truly well-done.",1411516800,5,381,5.161290322580645
6426525,4,B00KH57TNE,"The story of Moribito revolves around a body guard named Balsa (who is like a female version of Rurouni Kenshin). The story takes place in a feudal era type setting except that there are many mystical element involved with the plot. I really enjoyed the story this series tried to tell and the characters are quite interesting as well. The only downside of the series is that it tends to do more explaining than actual showing. From what I remember, there were a few slow episodes, but this is more than made up for by the beautiful action sequences. I also loved how this series never gave into a lot of the anime tropes that we see now days. There was never a moment or a scene that felt out of place or unnecessary. The series is really nothing ground breaking, but is definitely worth the watch.",1411084800,,799,4.442176870748299

8658619,5,B00KH57TNE,Being a male animae fan. This series has the strongest female lead character I have ever seen in animae.  She does not have magical powers nor some predestined lore.  She is just woman.  Powerful and respectful.  By journeys end and throughout series the emotional roller-coaster you will have will be amazing.  This series was on Netflix but removed.  You can see it on amazon prime video. I had to have physical copy.  This masterpiece needs to always be with me.,1516838400,,465,4.7375

8658622,5,B00KH57TNE,"One of my favorite anime series for sure. Only one season, but a great story nonetheless. I couldn't find it to stream anymore so I had to buy the complete series. This isn't like Fairy Tale or other anime that rely on cleavage and innuendo to carry the story in between low points. This has great dialog explaining many aspects of the world they live and how everyone came to be. I put this in the same group as ""The Hakkenden, the eight dog warriors"" and ""The irregular at Magic High School"". I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",1515283200,2,532,4.2254901960784315

I have been a an anime fan for almost 30 years and have watched an endless amount I cant even recall them all but after seeing this I bought the Blu-ray and put it on my PLEX server immediately so I could watch it on any device any where.

8658625,4,B00KH57TNE,"This is not your average anime; most of the popular anime tropes are absent. This series is a great story with some meaningful, well-done fight scenes. Just don't get this series if you need constant action to be entertained. The disks are a little odd in that you can only change the subtitles by using the popup menu and not the usual subtitles and audio buttons on your remote. That quirk and the light extras are the reason I subtracted one star.",1505692800,,450,4.5
