facilities for re-formatting.  Hope that didn't cost her a lot -- it was a gift!",1371168000,,168,4.25

8389095,5,B0035KN02C,"Though not really what I would call a musical, there is a lot of very good music here.  Made in Germany with ENGLISH and GERMAN dialogue. Takes place in decadent Germany just before the rise of Hitler.  David Bowie, Kim Novak, Marlene Dietrich, and Synde Rome all give sterling performances. I think it was Dietrich`s final film. Too bad it isn`t available in the U.S.",1337126400,3,368,4.6461538461538465
