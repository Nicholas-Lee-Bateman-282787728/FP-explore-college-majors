7883047,5,6305110255,"This is a lovely and funny film. It explores fidelity and independance as well as the idea that love can be washed in by the sea - and this film has a charming twist at the end.

PLEASE BRING THIS FILM OUT ON DVD !!!!!",1191369600,4,218,3.8444444444444446
7883048,4,6305110255,"I caught this film the other day on Romance Classic's sneak preview on AMC. I don't ususally watch any of the Romance Classics, but being a Roger Moore fan, it grabbed my attention. I really enjoyed it. Great performances all around, and especially by Moore. I never thought that he was capable of such a subtle performance. A beautiful film just to look at the landscape. A great ""slow"" film. Obviously, you cannot buy it, but definitely rent it if you can. It's perfect for those rainy days when you just want to stay in.",974592000,8,523,4.515789473684211
