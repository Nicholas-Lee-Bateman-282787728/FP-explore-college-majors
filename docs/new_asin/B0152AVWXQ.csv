7426853,5,B0152AVWXQ,"A well told story. Although it differs from the Disney 'Sword in the Stone' version of my childhood, there is a place for both. As an Adult, I find this movie quite charming and more believable than the cartoon version of my youth. I encourage others to enjoy the storytelling and judge for themselves if they were entertained..",1451260800,4,328,4.672413793103448

7426855,5,B0152AVWXQ,"I like the way Marco van Belle movies the narrative along.  The acting was the best I've EVER seen, they brought LIFE into the characters.  The narrative gave a true sence of taking a narrative and shaping it to meet your requirements (one big one: 1 hr and 49 min.).  Great movie!",1449792000,,281,4.365384615384615
7426856,5,B0152AVWXQ,We enjoyed the movie.  It was a completed new way of telling the story of Arthur and Merlin.  Thought it was refreshing to see a completed new version of the story.,1449014400,2,164,4.258064516129032

7426858,5,B0152AVWXQ,There were only four reviews when I viewed this - and three of them were ones. But the movie  was absolutely charming.  In many ways it was like reading a good book that you can't put down.  It lacked the sex and gore of today's movies which I liked.  Very entertaining right up to the end.,1448064000,10,290,4.125

7426862,3,B0152AVWXQ,"Acting was OK.  Historically about half right based on myths we have today.  I was looking forward to it, but it didn't feel my need.  It really wasn't a bad movie, but as I walk the Druid path, it's inaccuracies threw me.  Someone else may like it more.",1447545600,,254,4.229166666666667
7426883,5,B0152AVWXQ,"This is nothing like the original. In a lot of ways it's better, in some not as good.
Merlin is a reclusive hermit with no desire to rejoin humanity.
Arthur is a loyal kings man banished forever by a king under control of an evil druid.
I won't say more, but it is very well done.
It seems to fit the modern hero as a bumbling idiot format.",1511395200,,340,4.014705882352941

7426917,2,B0152AVWXQ,"Okay, I really wanted to like this movie.  It had intrigue, historic story, myth and magic.  But it also had crappy CGI, crappy writing and even a little crappy story telling.  The other thing that bothers me, and this is evident in most Saxon vs Celt stories it that all the women are hotties.  C'mon Movieland, not there's more of us regular people in the world.

The druid in this movie, and they use the term as a position, not a religion, is boring.  Worse, his acting sucks.  In the movie he is the voice to and of the king.  He wants to raise an underground god to work on his behalf.",1468713600,2,591,4.214285714285714

7426953,3,B0152AVWXQ,"This is an enjoyable grade G movie, but kids should not watch it because there are lots of killings. It is unlike the usual version of the legend of Arthur and Merlin. The two have similar but different names in this version. Merlin was born without a man's sperm entering his mother; the father was some sort of good God who marked Merlin's forehead with what looks like a clawing. Merlin shows an ability to produce magic, such as causing flowers to bloom, since he was a child. Enemy forces kill Merlin's mother. Merlin is captured - he is just a boy at the time - but Arthur - also a boy - helps him escape.
The good people in England at the time are the Celts. Their king has virtually lost his mind due to a war wound and dementia. He is controlled by a man who goes from town to town seeking sacrifices of people. He says it will cause the god to make the land fertile. But the land remains in a draught.
It is now fifteen years later. Arthur seeks out Merlin who has been hiding in the woods all this time. He wants the wizards help to save his king and the Celts. While searching he finds a sword in a swamp that says it has the ability to kill a god.",1465776000,3,1160,4.11453744493392

7426963,3,B0152AVWXQ,"This is an interesting departure from the usual Arthurian story. With a small budget and adequate cinematography, the director does a generally good job of bringing this tale to life. Despite the poorly executed sword fights and fisticuffs, the story of a young Welshman marked at birth by destiny and the bastard son of a Cornish chieftain, the tale of Myrddin (Merlin) and Arthur unfolds. In the 2 hours of its running time, the necessary 15-year jump between meetings is glossed over and the title characters' history brought full circle.

At best, i'd give the movie a C. The effects and acting are amateurish, but enacted with gusto. Olwen's part is a throw away and her actions as transparent as a first time supporting role, but little else can be said in her favor, other than that she is pretty with lovely dimples. The costumes are crude and to be expected of poor villager and extend even to the noblemen and king. Must be a very poor kingdom indeed, especially since the Druid is depopulating the land of souls, though I would've thought 10,000 men would take less time. Evidently not in this version of Vortigen's time. The historicity is lacking, but the point is to give the tale of Arthur and Merlin new life by creating a different origin story. Vortigen was a Saxon chieftain, not Celtic, but the writer and director were playing with the facts -- or such facts as can be known as others have done previously. No harm or foul there.

To sum up: small film on a small budget with ill prepared actors and nebulous motives in a world that is as small as the film. Adequate characterizations and performances with a new spin on the Arthurian mythology.",1462752000,8,1666,4.663265306122449

The story isn't the best but still good, the acting isn't Oscar caliber but it is still fairly good, not great but good. The leads of Arthur and Merlin needed to have a bit more chemistry than was portrayed on the screen, Merlin just seemed annoyed all the time. There were a few cute bits but not enough.
