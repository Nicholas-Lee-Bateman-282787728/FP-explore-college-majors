5315371,5,B009CI8RS8,I saw this long ago and really couldn't forget it.  When I saw it was available I ordered it and unlike a lot of my movies I watched it right away.  Still fascinating.,1376092800,,167,4.03030303030303
5315372,5,B009CI8RS8,"I loved this book, NO, I didn't like the fact that this book is based on a true story but I loved the reality of it. I am a true crime buff...I get drawn in to the puzzle of how different minds work. While reading this I couldn't grasp the thought of this ever happening to my family or myself treating family like this but I couldn't stop reading because I was fixated on what could have possibly being going on in his mind to think that he could have legitimate reasons for the things that he had done.

 I watched the Lifetime movie with Robert Urich and Gweneth Paltrow back in 93 and just happen to come across it on the internet somewhere and it peaked my interest again. I would love to find the movie and watch it again.

Very interesting read. Twenty years has passed since I first heard about this family and my heart still breaks for them.",1375401600,3,850,4.234567901234568
5315373,5,B009CI8RS8,"A story of a controlling, manipulative father who stops at nothing (even murder) to get what he wants & tries to hide his evil deeds under the guise of ""doing it for family.""  Very entertaining & absorbing, even though Robert Urich sometimes forgot his accent.",1375056000,,260,4.777777777777778
5315374,5,B009CI8RS8,"A great made for television movie starring Robert Urich, based on a true story where he plays against the nice guy roles he usually does. In this one he plays a former military service member who is still so tightly wrapped and regimented in his outlook on life that he runs his house and family in a boot camp like fashion tolerating no transgressions. His downward spiral continues to the point where he even kills his son-in-law for monetary gain. A gripping, riveting drama with tour de force performances by Urich, and Gwyneth Paltrow, in an early TV role as his daughter caught up in the family mayhem and madness before she branched out out in theatrical released movies. Highly recommended viewing!",1373932800,2,706,4.795081967213115

5315378,5,B009CI8RS8,"A coworker recommended the book, which I found fascinating. I just had to see the movie to see how close it was to the book. I was just a bit creeped out because it happened where I live and I was able to drive by the house to see it after reading the book and the first time I saw the movie.  A little freaky.",1367625600,4,310,3.769230769230769

5315386,5,B009CI8RS8,"This movie and Blind Faith are two of Urich's best movies other than the Spenser series and movies.  Have wanted it for some time and finally was able to get it.  My wife and I enjoyed it as much as we did the first time.  Some problems with print quality, but older tech doesn't always translate when duplicated.

A really great movie.",1389312000,,336,4.370967741935484

were very good in it. It's sad it was a true story but it was done very well. Glad I bought it. Love Matthew Perry in it and Robert Urich. Even though Matthew had a bit part in it. Still it was a great movie.
Great to watch.",1474934400,,306,3.873015873015873

8539618,4,B009CI8RS8,I was an extra in this movie when it filmed in Atlanta.  Gwyneth Paltrow was an unknown at the time.  Robert Ulrich was so handsome but stayed to himself.  I had a scene with Shelley Fabares and she was very cordial.  She was the mother of the bride and I was the mother of the groom...the no dialogue mother.  It was one of the more enjoyable movie extra roles.  The movie itself was very interesting.  I ordered it to keep as a memento for my grandchildren.,1457827200,,459,4.267441860465116
