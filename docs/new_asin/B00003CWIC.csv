7917260,3,B00003CWIC,"I bought this DVD with the idea of introducing to my grandchildren the ""real"" story behind Robin Hood. I was able to not only show them the story but to discuss with them (9 year old grand daughter and 4 year old grandson) the idea of injustice, helping those less fortunate than you, what to do when you have a problem - gathering like minded people to form a group (""band of merry men""). Overall, they were entranced by the story itself: particularly parts like Little John and testing Robin Hood at the river crossing, the idea of the Holy Wars in Jerusalem (they are not yet old enough to understand a lot of this) but they certainly love the story. Introducing Maid Marion, the helpers that Robin had in Sherwood Forest, the naughty Sheriff of Nottingham and the good Prince John and Robin of Loxley. A compelling story with all kinds of life lessons for this and almost any age group.",1320451200,,890,4.5
7917261,2,B00003CWIC,"Wow I just decided to buy this DVD only because there wasn't other cartoons on the rack with a familar story.  However, certainly this isn't the disney version.  It is rather old.  I would say more Scooby Doo quality, or the old Super Friends quality.

The only good thing about this old cartoon is that it was during the days of more lax regulations, so the story seems a bit more realistic.  So for adults, it's probably more enjoyable.  Without the story, I would say it's a dull DVD.

I would recommend the Disney's Fox Robin Hood over this one.  But that's only if you don't mind animals always playing a lead role in American cartoons.  Sometimes its just good to see humans on cartoons.",1113782400,,693,4.48
