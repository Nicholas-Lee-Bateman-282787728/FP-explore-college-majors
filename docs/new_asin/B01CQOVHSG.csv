8753809,5,B01CQOVHSG,"I purchased this collection as it had the modern (1957/58) suspense film Man In The Shadow with Jeff Chandler and Orson Welles . It's not a men on horses western but rather the story of a small town sheriff (Chandler) investigating a Mexican worker's death at a massive ranch owned and operated by Welles' character .
Unfortunately , my favorite classic film streaming channel (ROKU's Classic Reel) has a badly butchered version of the film that runs only 68 minutes AND has several brutal and obvious cuts to this 81 minute gripper .
This is a great price for this film alone + you get several other fine classic films as well . All with English subtitles .",1502928000,,658,4.584745762711864

8753811,1,B01CQOVHSG,"AVOID
This release crams two dual layered DVDs onto one disc which results in single layer inferior transfers for previously dual layered films. I purchased this release for Man in the Shadow at a big savings over the MOD version but did not realized they had squeezed four films onto two discs.
I own the Far Country original release and this one is less than half the size of the original.",1491696000,,391,4.52112676056338
8753812,4,B01CQOVHSG,"Classic westerns and James Steward is always watchable. Not the cream of the crop, however, which accounts for the great price.",1487116800,,127,5.095238095238095
