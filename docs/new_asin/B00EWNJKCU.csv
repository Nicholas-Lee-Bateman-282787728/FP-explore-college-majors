8610114,5,B00EWNJKCU,"Ordered as a Christmas present for my sister. We watched both movies and they were great ... I especially loved the ""A Song for the Season"" (I cried at the ending). Good family-oriented movies. Highly recommended!!!

Please note that the DVD itself was not in the case but sealed in plastic BEHIND the cardboard cover that wrapped around the plastic case! Interesting. Drove me crazy wondering where the DVD was!",1426636800,,412,4.885714285714286
