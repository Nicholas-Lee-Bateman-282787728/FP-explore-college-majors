171568,5,0849986761,I bought The Nativity VHS tape and and donated it to a school. The company was fast on filling this order and any questions afterward. Satisfaction was very high.,1232150400,2,162,4.620689655172414
171569,4,0849986761,"Good film but not one I'd keep in my personal library. I felt it left out some important points of the story. Mary was depicted as incredibly soft-spoken. I think she was more dynamic and had greater concern for what would happen to her if she did as the angel instructed.  Afterall, in her culture it was very likely she would be rejected by everyone including her fiance, Joseph who would suspect her of infidelity, for becoming pregnant during their engagement.  Additionally, it leaves out that Joseph knew Mary was pregnant before the angel appeared to him and intended to break their engagement privately so as not to embarrass her. It does include the angel of God but doesn't depict the emotion that would have been following... should he obey God or trust human emotions, writing it off as a strange dream & do what would be easiest for him.  The shepherds in the fields risked their livelihood in coming to see the Christ. The angels appeared as a Chorus after the 1st angel announced the birth. The wise men arrived when Christ was probably between 1 & 2 years old as it was a long & dangerous journey to get to Jerusalem.  Although it was a night departure from Bethlehem at the angel's direction, it's very unlikely Herod's soldiers were already killing children under 2 as Mary, Joseph & Jesus left Bethlehem for Egypt. (Matthew 2:13)

However, it is a good film & worth viewing with your children.  They should enjoy it up to about age 8 I would expect.  Animation quality is reflected in the cover of the video.  Good, not overly stimulating like many films today & enjoyable for a 30 minute escape from daily life.

171570,5,0849986761,"This new documentary is a surprisingly compelling look at the true story about the birth of Christ, and the deeper meaning of that birth and its impact on the world. With a fine cast of experts, teachers and authors, especially Peter Kreeft, Tim Gray and Fr. Mitch Pacwa, who offer powerful insights into the many important, but often not known, details about the birth of Christ, this film tells the ""story behind the story"" that includes the many significant events leading up to the Nativity, as well as those crucial details connected to this amazing historical event that have impacted our world ever since. Plus a lot of fabulous classical art, and some great footage from the Holy Land. This excellent documentary really does a great job of presenting a wonderful overview on this stunning event in history that we celebrate every year but sometimes forget the incredible spiritual meaning of it. Highly recommended.",1185926400,37,923,5.0
171571,5,0849986761,My 2 year old son loves this video.  He's been watching it almost every day for the past month.  I highy recommend this video.,1158105600,,126,4.208333333333333
171572,5,0849986761,"I am a Catholic who also reveres the Blessed Mother, and I was not offended at all by the depiction of Mary.  My son still watches his ""bible videos"" at age eight and this one is one of his favorites.  He has also shared it with his classmates in Catholic school almost every year, and I have never had a teacher object to the depiction of Mary as regular person.",1128643200,7,363,4.171428571428572
171573,1,0849986761,"I have allowed my five year old son to watch most of the Beginner's Bible Series videos and most of them are very good. However, this one does not get a good rating from me because as a Catholic who reveres (not worship) Mary the Blessed Mother I cannot accept big hoop earrings and the subtle innuendoes that she was not much different than other women of her time.",1121644800,3,366,4.318840579710145

7793181,4,0849986761,Great video that captures the passion of Christ in a kid friendly manner. An annual viewing around Easter has become a family tradition.,1403222400,,136,4.956521739130435
7793182,4,0849986761,"This 60-minute documentary features Catholic scripture scholars explaining the Old Testament and historical context of the birth of Jesus Christ. It's all pretty ecumenical and standard Christian typology, i.e. a study of Jewish messianic prophecies and how the incarnation fulfills them. The DVD also features some ""extras"" consisting of a few longer interviews with some of the scholars and a Catholic cardinal, as well as a little promo for the highly dull ""Footprints of God"" series. Overall, the content here is rock solid, but the presentation style is dry and unlikely to engage the interest of younger viewers. The visuals consist entirely of static art photography, a few images of scripture passages, and scholars sitting before the camera in their offices. It's excessively talky and just rolls along without any particular organization of themes or topics. In short, it's a 21st century (2007) documentary filmed with 1990s History Channel-style blandness. While full of solid scholarship and suitable for an adult Bible study or academic scripture class, I would not show it to college undergraduates or adolescents unless they had an above-average passion for scripture study.",1396483200,3,1190,5.437837837837838
7793183,5,0849986761,I never tire of watching this again and again. The strength of Mary and the loving sacrifice of Joseph are depicted in ways you can't forget! Have given it to friends as a Christmas present - affordable and beautiful.,1392940800,2,217,4.589743589743589
7793184,5,0849986761,This is great for children to learn about the birth of Christ. Can be used for Sunday School Teachers. You can't go wrong. A great buy at a great price. 2 Thumbs up.,1379635200,,165,4.03030303030303

7793188,4,0849986761,"During these times when the religion behind this holiday can be lost in campy holiday specials this is a great documentary.  Perfect for the holidays. By all means watch all those terrific Christmas movies (Rudolph, White Christmas, Wonderful Life, Frosty, Lemon Drop Kid, Charlie Brown, even Shrek, etc, etc.) I do; they are a staple in my house but do not forget how Christmas came to be.  I know I don't.",1275609600,11,407,4.71830985915493
