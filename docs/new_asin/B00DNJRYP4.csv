8595068,5,B00DNJRYP4,Benny Meng is an incredible master of martial arts. Specifically Shaolin Wing Chun. Very inexpensive for the knowledge shared.,1515110400,,126,5.684210526315789
8595069,1,B00DNJRYP4,"I have now purchased and watched all three of this series.  While I find the information interesting about a different style of Wing Chun, I find there is not enough actual instruction to make these usable.  The first disk, ""Basic Skills, has less than 30 minutes of instruction;.  The whole disk is only 36 minutes in length.  The first five minutes are Master Meng introducing Black Flag Wing Chun.  I love Benny Meng and his Ving Tsun Museum and I understand the need to introduce the idea and lineage of Black Flag Wing Chun, but in a 30 minute DVD, it uses 5 minutes.  The instruction in the Basic Skills Disk is done classroom style with three practitioners doing the techniques. It was interesting to watch, but there is almost no instruction verbally and the movements are done at speed.  Again, interesting to watch, but without some verbal instruction and and actually DEMONSTRATING the techniques it is not helpful.

The Second Disk Basic Applications, shows the theory behind Black Flag Wing Chun.  That was quite interesting and their views on how to make maximum efficiency make a lot of sense.  This second DVD is mostly lecture, aided by some graphics to explain the concepts.  I liked the video, but again, there is little to no instruction in movement, forms, etc.

The Third Video has the 18 Lohan Suann Sik in it.  All 18 are demonstrated but again with little to no verbal instruction.  There is no break down of the technique, why the hands strike the way they do, how to do the strikes, posture, and anything else that would be useful in actually learning this.

Do not purchase these DVD's on Black Flag Wing Chun thinking you will learn any Wing Chun. Even for very experienced practitioners there is little usable here. At the end of the video it directs you to their website for more instruction, which you can buy. I understand that you need more instruction than some DVD's, but For 30 dollars for each of these videos, I am deeply disappointed with this video, and the whole series.",1498176000,,2012,4.676136363636363
8595070,5,B00DNJRYP4,Sifu Benny Mehg does an excellent job of instructing on this DVD.  I have long known there were methods of wing chun other than the hong kong style made famous by Yip Man.  This set of DVDs helps you to see how the ancestor of hong kong wing chun moved.  I first played wing chun back in the 60's with a person whose training was not the hong kong system and could clearly see that his method was just as effective in combat as it's hong kong cousin.  The film quality and sound quality are excellent and sifu Meng does his usual excelent job of teaching you the basic moves of Black Flag.,1496707200,,589,4.185840707964601
