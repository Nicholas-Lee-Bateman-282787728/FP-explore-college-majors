4486375,3,B004WD1J10,"I'm torn on how many stars to give this movie...  so, I'll just leave it at 3.

On one hand, it's a nice mix-up of like a female Punisher crossed with a little Kill Bill and maybe even some Equilibrium in there...  That said this same story line has been done to death...  going all the way back to Mad Max or like Death Wish and whatnot...

Camera work was ""o...k...""...  Sound quality was ""meh""...  I really wish indie flicks took some time to work on their audio...  When 2 people are talking a room, they should have approx the same levels...  not sound like one guy is shouting while the other is whispering...  better audio could have helped this movie a LOT...  Soundtrack was ok though...  maybe even a little conservative for this movie...  but ok...

I also think the movie tried to do too much in the final fight scene...  I get it that they wanted to have some kind of huge fight scene...  but without a proper stunt coordinator, having limited budget, limited fx, etc...  most of it came out pretty cheesy...  I'm sorry, but if you're going to try to pull off fight sequence moves from a Jet Li movie or something, you have to have trained stunt-men and an excellent camera crew doing this stuff...  not to mention, some wire-fu set-up...  it had none of it...

Really good effort...  and not bad at all for an indie flick...  but I think it kinda fell short, and could have been a lot better had the team worked on stuff that was plausible and still within budget ( ie, better audio, better ending, etc... )",1507334400,2,1521,4.392086330935252
4486376,5,B004WD1J10,This movie kept me on the edge of my seat with the constant tension and upping of intensity.  It is the best revenge indie film I've ever seen and another classic in the Woodell collection.,1492646400,,189,4.4
4486377,5,B004WD1J10,I really enjoyed this revenge flick.  Grindhouse style.  Sexy and violent.,1427760000,,74,5.636363636363637
4486378,4,B004WD1J10,"I love this movie!!  December is so hot, and she's almost super human in her ability to deduce and to whoop some serious @ss.  It's awesome.",1370390400,,140,4.346153846153846
4486379,4,B004WD1J10,"December is a sexy, sexy girl hell-bent on vengeance.  This movie follows her story from innocent child watching her parents die, to super talented assassin/investigator.  She's smart, and you just can't wait to see what happens to those that have done this girl wrong.  I'll just say...it's not pretty (for them).",1368316800,2,314,5.117647058823529
4486380,3,B004WD1J10,From the time I ordered the movie to receiving it was fast and I enjoyed the movie.  I was told if there was any problems to wait so many days.  My movie came intact and on time.,1322524800,,178,3.7837837837837838
4486381,3,B004WD1J10,"I've always loved revenge and vigilante movies. I grew up watching Deathwish, Carrie, Mad Max, and just about every martial arts movie. Most revenge films have a male lead, but in Death Angel December it's a feisty and sexy woman. In the movie this girl watches her family brutally attacked and killed. This would mess with anyone's head! Instead of going in for counseling though, she decides to become an assassin when she grows up. Revenge is the only thing on her mind and she doesn't disappoint when she finds the scum bags that killed her family. The ending is both outrageous and satisfying. Who wouldn't want to be able to single-handedly kill off a small army of men?!",1314489600,,677,4.697478991596639
4486382,4,B004WD1J10,"Having seen her mother and little brother brutally murdered, Angel December grows up to become a one-person killing crew, eliminating bad guys, using her pretty face and incredible body as her principle weapon.

The production values are terrific for this sort of thing and the lead actress (Leena Kurishingal--a real find) delivers the goods.  There's plenty of action, blood, gore and gunplay.  As a stone-cold killer, Angel builds the body count high and fast, but all that's preliminary--eventually she works her way around to a gang led by a man by the name of ""Law.""  He and his sadistic henchmen are the ones who killed Angel's family long ago.  Angel now intends to take her time stalking, torturing and killing each one, but things aren't quite that easy.  The film ends with a spectacular running gun-battle, then sword-fight--more than you would have expected.  But the real star of the finale is Angel's costume, hair, makeup and personal training regimen.  Throughout the slaughter she manages to stay super hot-looking (okay, I admit it--I'm in love).  This isn't the most original of films, nor the most expensive, but it delivers on the action without going (way) overboard, pretending to be more than it is, or camping it up, all of which I appreciated.",1313193600,2,1270,4.981042654028436
4486383,3,B004WD1J10,"This Bennie Woodell as a director,writer ...so on and so forth can make a movie with nothing into something.
He also made Fast Zombies With Guns,See our review of it elsewhere.
D.A.D. is pretty incredible with nice death scenes and chases and acting that is NOT wooden or amatuerish.
The lead,Leena Kurishingal , Is pretty and amazing,She shows emotion,physicality in action scenes and just has a look that smacks of a star.
With all the women as weapons films,This one has to have earned a spot no matter it's budget and those that maybe consider STUDIO ""A"" films.
Filmed near Chicago,It has a much grittier look with rain and bad weather obvious to filming.",1310774400,,659,4.7894736842105265

8444968,1,B004WD1J10,"* 0 (that's zero) Stars *  Amateur torture-porn garbage masquerading as a revenge flick.  The story is dirt-simple.  Production values are sub-amateur (the cinematographer may never have held a camera before) and the acting is even worse.  The audio is so muddy you need to turn on subtitles, and that still won't help in many scenes, where the incredibly loud music drowns out the voices so completely that even the subtitles fail.  Honestly, this is as dumb, bad and ugly as a film can get, and it's actually boring as well.  Run away from this stinker.",1510185600,,555,4.729166666666667
8444969,1,B004WD1J10,"Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. It takes itself very seriously which is probably it's greatest flaw considering the poor writing, acting, directing, production, etc.  Overly gory, trying to highlight special effects and makeup, but cinematography/editing lingers too long on the wounds as if to say, ""hey, look what we did here with his eye!!"".  The music isn't bad, but isn't good.  There are moments where the music is louder than people talking.  All in all, pretty painful to watch.",1508716800,,501,5.073170731707317

8444971,2,B004WD1J10,"Watch ONLY if one wants a first effort indie-like flick about a psychopath who justifies the psychosis by blaming it on something she saw as a child. It would help if you are using a B&W TV/monitor because a lot is B&W and the colors are terrible.
I watched ~half thinking it would get better (due to the positive ratings) then realizing the BAD video quality, phone quality audio, repetitious dialog, low-q acting was permanent.
I fell asleep before switching it off. That's 50 minutes of my life I can never get back but I wish I could. ...",1508544000,,542,4.484848484848484
8444972,1,B004WD1J10,Everyone involved with this movie should be restricted to watching movies only and forbidden to make one.  Think about the worst movie you've ever seen...  This one is 10 ten worse.,1508025600,,181,4.806451612903226
