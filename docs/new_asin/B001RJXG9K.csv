8338148,3,B001RJXG9K,"I loved this movie, historical inaccuracies included, because Ramirez is one of my heroes. Despite its flaws, this movie portrays Richard in an overall positive light. I've seen it three times on Netflix and decided I wanted to own  a copy, hence my purchase.",1416355200,,259,4.886363636363637
8338149,1,B001RJXG9K,"Awful. Slow, bad effects, bad acting, bad writing..... Not even historically accurate. Really says everything right there. The entire movie is just 'satanic' music/chanting with Ramirez walking aimlessly while sucking on a lollipop. There are some 10 second kill scenes and some random flashback fillers. And oh yeah, throw in some garbage inner monolague and you come up with this waste of 85 minutes. So coming from an avid horror/thriller/B-movie fan, just don't bother.

PS. If you do make the mistake of watching this. Listen for the amazing sound effects of the mob beating Ramirez. It is literally the sound crew popping bubble wrap!",1346976000,5,640,5.153846153846154
8338150,1,B001RJXG9K,"This is the worst ""based on a true story"" serial killer movie ever.  Don't waste your time or money.",1275436800,3,100,4.2631578947368425
8338151,1,B001RJXG9K,"......made another sick, repulsive and boring movie.  Based on a true story he has made a film about a psychopathic serial killer who sucks lollipops while he blows the brains out of his victims, but there is no story, just a series of scenes where some pretty awful actors are just sitting ducks waiting to be slaughtered.  The best actor in the movie is the lollipop.  So that's about it--one star for the tootsie pop-and down the toilet for the rest of the crap on screen.",1253318400,4,475,4.5
