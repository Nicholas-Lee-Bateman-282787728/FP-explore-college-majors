8162956,5,B000LP5D6K,"Legend Films present  ""THE THREE STOOGES: TRIPLE WHAMMY"" (197 mins) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) --- now in COLOR and Glorious Black and White --- Greatest Routines - 35 hilarious misadventures that'll make you laugh till it hurts. Extreme Rarities - Extremely rare routines in color for the very first time. Take a privileged look behind the scenes, with rare interviews, specials and three classic appearances on the Steve Allen Show. Live & Hilarious - Rare trailers and live appearances, including a hilarious and extremely hard-to-find turn on the Ed Wynn Show. This title only available in the 3-Disc Box Set. --- Renown Legend Films was given the wonderful task to restore, colorize and release some of their earliest black and white films, as well as episodes of their television releases and movie series, The Three Stooges Collection --- a patented coloring and remastering process makes for a  picture perfect side splitting experience even more enjoyable than ever.

The Stooges' hallmark was extremely physical slapstick comedy, mixed with one-liners, the introduction of additional characters and outrageous plots --- The Three Stooges started in 1925 as a raucous vaudeville act called Ted Healy and His Stooges (also called ""Ted Healy and His Southern Gentlemen"", ""Ted Healy and His Three Lost Souls"" and ""Ted Healy and His Racketeers"") --- Lead comedian Healy would try to sing or tell jokes while his noisy assistants kept ""interrumping"" him. Healy would respond by abusing his stooges verbally and physically --- Brothers Moe Howard (Moe) and Shemp Howard (Shemp) were joined later that year by violinist Larry Fine --- Later they signed with Columbia Short Subjects (1934-1957),  best known for their numerous short films were commonly known by their first names: Moe, Larry, & Curly; Moe, Larry, & Shemp; and other lineups --- Originally they featured the three-man line-up of brother Moe Howard (born Harry Moses Horwitz), long-time friend Larry Fine (born Louis Feinberg), and brother Shemp Howard (born Samuel Horwitz) --- Shemp was later replaced by brother Curly Howard (born Jerome Lester Horwitz) in 1932 --- When Curly suffered a stroke in 1946, Shemp rejoined the act and replaced him --- After Shemp's death in 1955 he was replaced by bald-headed sissy comedian Joe Besser, and eventually by Joe ""Curly-Joe"" DeRita (born Joseph Wardell) (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

First up we have - THREE STOOGES: THE GREATEST  ROUTINES (79951) (60 mins) --- Join Moe, Larry and Curly Joe for 35 hilarious misadventures! --- Youll laugh until it hurts as the boys do their best to run an ice cream stand, go on a seemingly simple fishing excursion, or do the old spit and polish on a dilapidated house --- all with disastrous, but side-splitting results!

8162957,3,B000LP5D6K,"EXTREME RARITIES is the only disc on this DVD set that is worth getting and it is cheaper to buy it separately.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Three-Stooges-Extreme-Rarities/dp/B000LP5D6A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Three Stooges: Extreme Rarities</a>

Several people are suggesting this set because of the low price, which is low.  But first ask yourself if you really need another copy of the Ed Wynn Show (disc 2) and the 1965 color intros shot for the cartoon show (disc 3).  These are pale imitations of the original routines.

If you don't have the Ed Wynn Show, you might want to consider either of these other DVDs that also include material not in the Triple Whammy box set.

THE MEN BEHIND THE MAYHEM is a documentary that also includes the Ed Wynn Show as well as radio interviews with Moe & Larry from the early 1970's:

There is also another GREATEST HITS & RARITIES DVD than includes ""Knife of the Party"" as well as the Ed Wynn Show, but the quiality is quite inferior.  You also get the usual 4 public domain shorts on this DVD.

Here is my review for the third disc ""GREATEST ROUTINES"":

  Re-issue of the inferior color intros to the 1965 cartoons., April 30, 2007
Reviewer: Paul J. Mular (San Carlos, CA USA) - See all my reviews

This is FAR from their greatest, it is their 1965 re-performance of their classic routines. Moe & Larry are much older and Curly has been replaced by Curly-Joe, their comedy pacing is off and slow. Also why buy these 16mm prints when you can get the original uncut versions on the cartoon releases?

Watching this will only make you yearn for the original classic performances of the 1930's & 1940's.",1177891200,5,2469,6.594427244582043
8162958,1,B000LP5D6K,"This is all old recycled shlock, very poor quality and colorized to boot.  Most of it is so late in the Stooges career, it is almost sad to watch.  Save your money and spend it on a beeter package.",1176508800,3,197,4.0256410256410255
8162959,5,B000LP5D6K,"I wrote reviews for the discs seperatly but wanted to state that this box set was pretty god,the weakest disc was the ""Live and hillarious"" dvd which only had the ed wynn show (B&w and color) and a bunch of trailers (not colorized and in typical shape for trailers)I wished that they could have placed a colorized ""Jerk of all trades"" on here to kind of fill it out a little bit...now as far as the other 2 discs the ""extreme rarities"" is the best one with alot of rare footage and the imfamous ""Heavenly Daze"" short where shemp dies and returns as a ghost (in color and b&w)..the other disc is just ""New Three Stooges"" shorts from the cartoon series and is the same as the version from ""Goodtimes"" just clearer.so all in all I would say that it's worth buying the set as opposed to the individual discs..",1176508800,3,805,4.373333333333333
