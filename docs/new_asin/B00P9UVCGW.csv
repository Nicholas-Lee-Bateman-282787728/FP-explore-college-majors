8687096,5,B00P9UVCGW,"Netflix suggests it for 5-7 yr olds, however my 10 month old is in love with Jasper and his friends .  I don't know if it is the voices, or the  animation, but Claire gives it 2 thumbs up.  We have watched it dozens of times, instead of being sick of it the hubby and I find ourselves quoting this movie in conversations.",1434067200,,321,4.063492063492063

Penguins live a simple life, believe the world is flat and nothing exists beyond the icebergs surrounding them. Jasper is a young penguin that doesn't conform to their beliefs. One day he sees a huge cruise ship which disproves the theory that only penguins exist. Jasper, unfortunately, does not succeed in his attempt to show this to the other penguins. In doing so, he is shunned.

While being tasked to watch his brother, Junior, Jasper loses sight of him. He later finds him making his way towards the cruise ship. Junior boards it followed by Jasper. While onboard, they meet nine-year old Emma and a cat named Lucifer. Together, they all vow to help the Kakapo parrot retrieve his stolen eggs from a passenger named Doctor Block and his helper Rolf. Can these four misfits work together to save the eggs from harm? Can the penguin brothers and Emma each earn their parent's respect? You'll have to watch the eighty minute DVD to find out.

While Jasper: Journey To The End Of The World is family friendly and earns its ""Family Approved"" seal on the front of its case, I did notice a couple of issues.  There is a scene where the Kakapo parrot falls down a laundry chute and into a washing machine.  Emma shouts OMG, spelled out.  In another incident the parrot says ""Oh ca ca.""  Last but not least, there's a margarita reference in the end.

Overall my kids enjoyed Jasper: Journey To The End Of The World.  There's plenty of humor and my kids laughed throughout the entire movie.",1426204800,,1547,4.616788321167883
