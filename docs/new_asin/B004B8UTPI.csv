8421762,2,B004B8UTPI,"Compared to the first 4 seasons it was rather drab. Not as much partying, drug use, or excitement that gave the first 4 seasons their allure. None of the characters were very compelling & I was honestly bored throughout.",1329350400,,220,4.666666666666667
8421763,5,B004B8UTPI,"Series 5 does not disappoint...this series like the others turn what we know of todays youth on it's head. The new generation is likeable, lovable, while infuriating as hell. These new kids bring their own style and flavor to an established show that makes this show a joy to watch. I found myself in the beginning picking who I liked, who I loved and who I hated. By episode 8, I had a new found respect for every character. That's what makes this show brilliant. If you love Skins...Series 5 doesn't disappoint.",1302393600,4,513,4.586956521739131
