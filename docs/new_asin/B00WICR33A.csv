7132582,5,B00WICR33A,"Four more classic Esther Williams titles find their way to the TCM Greatest Films Collection.  Although these are reissues from larger Esther Williams sets, it's always good to see them being offered at lower price-points in these economy-minded collections.

First up Esther is paired with frequent leading man Van Johnson in 1945's THRILL OF A ROMANCE.  This film was amongst the top 10 grossing films of that year, and it's easy to see why.  Dumped on her honeymoon, Cynthia Delbar (Williams) despairs until she meets handsome soldier Johnson.  Extra features include outtake musical numbers, short subject ""The Great American Mug"", cartoon ""Wild and Woolfy"", and the trailer.

FIESTA (1947) is one of Esther's more unusual films.  Set in Spain amongst the world of the matadors, Esther is Maria, who secretly replaces her twin brother Mario (Ricardo Montalban) in the bullring when his dance ambitions grow stronger than their father's efforts to train him in the old family tradition.  Cyd Charisse co-stars.  Extra features include short subject ""Goodbye Miss Turlock"", cartoon ""Hound Hunters"", and the trailer.

PAGAN LOVE SONG (1950) is one of several films Esther made with Howard Keel.  In this one she plays island beauty Mimi Bennett, ready to return home to the mainland, but she thinks twice once she meets Hazard Endicott (Keel), newly-arrived to take over his late uncle's plantation.  The musical score includes the delightful ""House of Singing Bamboo"".  Rita Moreno co-stars.  Extra features include outtake musical numbers, Pete Smith Specialty short subject ""Curious Contests"", cartoon ""The Chump Champ"", and the trailer.

Finally in 1952's MILLION DOLLAR MERMAID, Esther has the perfect vehicle to combine her underwater prowess with a solid, dramatic story.  Playing real-life champion Australian swimming star Annette Kellerman, Williams co-stars with Victor Mature.  Extra features include audio of the ""Lux Radio Theatre"" presentation of the film starring Williams, cartoon ""The Little Wise-Quacker"" (with Tom & Jerry), Pete Smith Specialty short subject ""Reducing"", and the trailer.",1437868800,13,2108,5.496894409937888

Tracks 13 and 25 are out of focus. Close inspection shows that the DVDs in the two set are identical - they never corrected the mastering problem. So, back it goes.",1514505600,2,531,6.91044776119403
