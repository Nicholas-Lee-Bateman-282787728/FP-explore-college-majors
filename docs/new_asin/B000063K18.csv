As for myself the story was great. The acting was..? Well, sometimes it felt like I was listening to amateurs. Maybe I'm being too picky there, but it kind of threw me off a little.",1387584000,,373,4.328571428571428
1690724,5,B000063K18,"This is one of those stories you don't see very often. A true story of a grandson's love for his grandmother.  A story of a young man who wanted to play football all his life made the decision to give one of his kidneys to his grandmother to save her life knowing he would never be able to play football again . Debbie Reynolds is excellent as the grandmother.  The best part of this movie is the ending. I have watched it over and over again. I highly recommend it.

1690727,5,B000063K18,"I happened to find a used VHS copy of this movie years ago, cheap, so bought it and have really enjoyed it. Decided I wanted a good copy on DVD so ordered it on Amazon. It's nice to have a good copy of this lovely little film. It's just one of those ""based on a true story"" movies that you can really enjoy. Good acting. None of that cheap labor, stilted performance stuff like you find in a lot of ""family"" movies. This was very well done. Well, Mariouchi may have overacted just a bit as the coach but that was alright.",1328659200,,521,4.117647058823529

1690729,5,B000063K18,"This Hallmark film, apparently made for Showtime, is based on the true sacrifice of high school junior Daniel Huffman (Elden Henson) who donated a kidney to save the life of his beloved grandmother Shirlee Allison (Debbie Reynolds), even though it meant giving up his boyhood dream--now within reach--of playing on a winning high school football team.

This is a sappy movie, to be sure, such as one would expect from Hallmark. But it is also educational, and inspirational. My high school student especially loved it, maybe because it was a gift from his beloved grandmother, who fortunately does not need a kidney.",1177804800,3,616,5.03921568627451

1690731,4,B000063K18,"Based on a true story, ""Gift of Love"" tells the story of a high school student, Daniel Huffman (played by Elden Henson), who looks to have a promising future in football.  He is very close to his grandmother, Shirlee Allison (Debbie Reynolds), who helped to raise him.
Shirlee becomes quite ill, and is in desperate need of a kidney transplant.  Daniel selflessly gives her one of his, a choice that results in him never being able to play football again.
The movie was obviously made to ""tug at the heart strings""; it's packed with saccharine, if you catch my drift.  The acting, however, is top notch - with fantastic performances from Henson and Reynolds, especially.  Ed Marinaro also stars as Daniel's coach.",997574400,20,713,4.819672131147541
