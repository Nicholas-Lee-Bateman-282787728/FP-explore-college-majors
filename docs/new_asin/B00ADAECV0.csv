5409062,5,B00ADAECV0,best exercise program ever.,1408233600,,27,6.0
5409063,5,B00ADAECV0,"I recommend this for anybody with knee, foot, back, or other joint pain, or just plain stiffness. I have had no recurrence of my plantar fasciitis since I started this program nearly two years ago and I can tell that my core strength has improved.",1404000000,30,247,4.511111111111111

5409065,5,B00ADAECV0,I have two of Miranda's Classical Stretch DVDs and love them so much I give them to others as gifts.  They are very special!,1389744000,8,124,4.166666666666667
5409066,4,B00ADAECV0,"I've seen and felt difference in my body after 2 weeks and will continue to improve. My posture is a little better and I do feel more flexible and slim. I like that she's not perfect , nor am i :-)",1372118400,17,197,3.8292682926829267
5409067,5,B00ADAECV0,"I own just about everything Miranda produces, especially her ""Series"" collections. The technique is different from other methods and actually it's hard to put it in a category. Her method absolutely stretches you but there is so much more. You strengthen your muscles as well and are challenged in flexibility, balance, etc. All without using weights. As you learn the techniques, you will work harder. I never feel tired after her routines, rather energized. NOTE: The prices at her site are much more reasonable than here. This particular dvd is well over priced as you get the ENTIRE season series from her site, for the same price. Buyer beware, check her site first before purchasing elsewhere.",1370044800,74,699,5.0344827586206895

5409069,5,B00ADAECV0,"I love Miranda, Essentrics, and Classical Stretch. They have truly changed my life and deliver what they promise...fun, stretching and getting in great shape.

I am extremely satisfied and recommend this to anyone interested in getting and staying in great shape and having fun with low stress.",1459987200,5,372,5.114754098360656

5409071,4,B00ADAECV0,"Easy to follow, we just need to use it regularly.",1448236800,,49,4.0
5409072,5,B00ADAECV0,"I have watched Miranda on PBS and that is what prompted me to buy this series.  I have series 7 although I think that probably any of them would be comparable.  She combines ballet moves with tai chi to make the most amazing stretch workout.  I do one everyday.  They are each about 23 minutes and work different areas.  There are 30 episodes in the disk set so you never get bored doing the ""same old"" workout daily because you do each one once per month.  You will not believe how good the stretching makes you feel.  It loosens up everything and as you keep doing them, your whole body feels and moves much better.  Don't think twice---buy a set",1447804800,5,648,4.341666666666667
5409073,5,B00ADAECV0,Great product - so many different exercise routines I haven't even tried yet.,1446768000,,77,5.0
5409074,5,B00ADAECV0,"I saw this on PBS and thought it looked better than most workouts for the living room. And, yet. I still have to actually watch it and work out, don't I. Well, I can't blame the video. Miranda did her part quite well. It's me.",1446336000,,226,4.044444444444444
5409075,4,B00ADAECV0,"I was hoping for a little more explanation of the technique, but it's ok",1444521600,,72,4.214285714285714
5409076,3,B00ADAECV0,"I give it a 5 star for content, but not for the discs. None of the discs will play on the television, I get an error message ""incorrect disc"".  I can only play them on my computer.  Problem is with floor exercises because my computer is on my desk and I'm on the floor.  Extremely difficult to follow along when the computer is so high.  Disappointed!",1443744000,,351,4.2727272727272725

5409082,1,B00ADAECV0,Not what I expected. Is not appropriate for my age group. Could not get a clear description,1436832000,,91,4.411764705882353
5409083,5,B00ADAECV0,I love this dvd! It's a great whole body workout.,1435449600,,49,4.0
5409084,5,B00ADAECV0,"This seems perfect for me.  All cds provide areal gentle stretch.  If I want a stronger stretch, the instruction provides for this.",1435190400,2,131,4.909090909090909
5409085,5,B00ADAECV0,"I love everything about this workout.  Miranda explains the body parts and reasons for certain exercises; each workout session is a mere 23 minutes which you can fit in easily everyday, and add more as desired.  I feel like these sessions are for life and will not become outdated.",1433548800,8,281,4.714285714285714
5409086,5,B00ADAECV0,My daughter is a chiropractic assistant and cares very much about her mother's well-being. She told me that Classical Stretch would not hurt my joints. She follows Classical Stretch on PBS and says that she feels so much better. I have started using the DVDs and am very happy to have them on my time schedule.,1431043200,4,310,4.553571428571429

From my experience, it is appropriate for most everyone . . you just do what you can.  My daughter is using the videos and my 2 and a half year old grand daughter enjoys doing them with her.  Yeah. . . Movement for all ages!",1429142400,9,392,4.1866666666666665
5409088,3,B00ADAECV0,"Really have not got into the dvd too much. I think she moves along too fast.  Maybe after I have watched videos more, I will catch up with what she is deomonstrating.",1428192000,,166,4.1875
5409089,5,B00ADAECV0,"These exercises truly change your body, change your attitude, and the way you are able to live life.  Wonderful.",1427846400,2,112,4.894736842105263

5409091,4,B00ADAECV0,Have almost made it through the whole series. I have noticed a difference in my well being already. The only complaint I have: Ms. Esmonde-White talks to much and forgets to instruct. Remember we are trying to watch the video and do the exercise at the same time - more instruction when it's difficult for the viewer to see is needed. She is very positive and encouraging.,1426723200,10,372,4.567164179104478
5409092,4,B00ADAECV0,"I would have given this a five star rating IF the procedures were a little slower for first time users.  I find it difficult to follow ""at my own pace""",1426377600,,151,4.033333333333333

5409095,1,B00ADAECV0,"I was disappointed with this purchase. The imaged quality is dismal. It looks like a copy of a copy, etc.
I would advise not buying this item",1425859200,13,141,4.2592592592592595

8550055,5,B00ADAECV0,usually watch on my local PBS channel and found her exercises beneficial for an entire body workout. On the days her show is not broadcast or I over sleep( it comes on at 6am) I don't miss a workout. within a few short weeks I noticed improvident in my back /shoulders and hands especially.,1524700800,,290,4.388888888888889

8550059,4,B00ADAECV0,"I am enjoying the exercise sessions, especially since they are geared toward a mature audience.  I am approximately Amanda's age.  I would have given this purchase five stars except that in two of the DVDs I have come across sections that get stuck and jerk through for 10 to 20 seconds which is annoying.",1474070400,2,305,4.62962962962963
