5636111,3,B00BKG6S0O,"If you are looking for an ideal Cenerentola, this is not it.  In fact, you will not find it on any available DVD.  When this production was first shown in theaters as part of the Met's HD Opera series, I pulled out my video tapes of previous productions, featured in PBS telecasts--a 1988 Salzburg Festival airing, La Scala's made-for-movie presentation, Cecilia Bartoli's American debut from Houston in 1995, and the Met's 1997 telecast of this same production.  While this is not the ideal, it is the best of what is available.
The strengths of this production: the sets and costumes; the most beautiful Cinderella, Elina Garanca, although vocally Bartoli's 1995 effort is better; the best Alidora, John Relyea, on DVD; the best Don Magnifico, Alessandro Corbelli, who interestingly was also the best Dandini, in the 1997 Met telecast; the best Ramiro, Lawrence Brownlee (even though he was almost a head shorter than his Cinderella) followed closely by Ramon Vargas.
The problems: Alidora's sprouting angel wings; the men's chorus who, except in the wine cellar scene, just walked or marched onto the stage, stood there, sang, and walked or marched off (try the La Scala version--at least they gave the men a little something to do); the distracting ""musical chairs"" business during the dinner scene at the end of Act I; the giant wedding cake; the cartoonish stepsisters (the Salzburg version is the only one that presented them believably).
Again, while this is not the ideal, it is the best of what is available.",1266278400,5,1518,4.992094861660079
5636112,3,B00BKG6S0O,"I must confess that I felt disappointed with the performance. We need to remember that the days when Caballe could perform on stage LA TRAVIATA or PAVAROTTI LA BOHEME are probably gone. Indeed these two had such stupendous voices that we forgave them everything. There are still some famed singers who are ""monstrously obese"" but they are having a rough time- see the Debora Voigt affair.
Elina Garanca looks gorgeous and has a gorgeous voice but acting? No way !
Lawrence Brownlee has a very good voice and even his acting is not disastrous, but choosing him as Don Ramiro stretches our credulity a bit too thin. First, he is much shorter than Garancha,and rather plump and this is and looks ludicrous.  An African-American singer, at least as tall as Garanca, with a good voice and some acting knowledge, would have been perfect.
The rest are excellent and so is Benini .",1266105600,9,873,4.743421052631579
5636113,5,B00BKG6S0O,"I love opera but have been hesitant to introduce it to my daughter due to the mature subject matter of many Met productions.  La Cenerentola was the perfect choice for viewing by my 8 year old.  She's hooked!!  Right now she's watching the DVD La Cenerentola for the 2nd time and loving it!  The cast is wonderful, the story lines are interesting, and the scenes move quickly enough to keep the youngest of viewers entertained.  The only thing that I would warn about is that the labeling on my DVDs is backwards.  Disk 2 is labeled as Disk 1 and vice versa.  Also, the DVD does not automatically set the subtitles so you'll need to add the english subtitles each time you play the DVD.  I consider that to be a small price to pay for a well done production.

5636116,5,B00BKG6S0O,"I first saw this production broadcast on television, and was instantly captivated. I have been waiting impatiently for it to come out on dvd ever since. Cenerentola has long been one of my very favorite operas, and I tend to be a very critical viewer. I have seen some wonderful interpretations of this beloved classic, but this production, for me, remains at the very top of the list.

All the singers are phenomenal, both the leads and the supporting cast, and the acting is first class, all around. Elina Garanca looks the part of Cinderella perfectly. The Prince has some peculiar facial expressions at times, but really, his singing is utterly superb. I cannot say I have had the pleasure of hearing a better tenor leggiero than this, not even in Juan Diego Flores, who is likewise fabulous. The entire cast and crew had a blast with this production, and it shows. The image of the tall, broad-shouldered Alidoro sporting his tiny little angel wings during his first act aria never fails to amuse.

I could not be more pleased with this dvd. Take it from one who is very hard to please in the opera dvd department - this is a must have! Whether you are a long-time lover of opera, or just beginning to find appreciation for this art form, this dvd comes very highly recommended.",1263859200,33,1283,4.62280701754386

Visually it is as good as high def, which I don't have. The singing and acting are as good as it gets.

5636119,5,B00BKG6S0O,"This is an excellent version of one of the greatest of all comic operas.  For me, it is the equal of the Barcelona production with Di Donato and Florez  in terms of the singing and overall musicality, although I find the Met's rather conventional staging less fun to watch. Even though Brownlee is a bit too short in height to be an ideal prince, his singing is magnificent--he is every bit the equal of Florez on the Barcelona set  (and Gimenez on the very fine  Houston Grand Opera production which also features Cecilia Bartoli).  In the title role, Garanca is sheer delight, with a voice effortlessly able to scale the heights of Rossini's most dazzling passages.  As an added attraction, she looks and acts the part as well.  Corbelli's Don Magnifico all by itself would be more than worth the price of  the DVD.  In every way, he confirms his reputation as one of the greatest Rossini singers.  The rest of the cast perform well, giving first rate support to the principal singers.  Highly recommended  both to those already in love with Rossini and to those new to him.  Because it features great music, great singing, and a classic story, it would also be an ideal place to start for newcomers to the world of opera.",1411084800,,1224,4.611111111111111

5636125,3,B00BKG6S0O,"I'm probably going to hate myself in the morning, but it must be said.  Lawrence Brownlee has a superb voice but is physically miscast, a fact emphasized mercilessly in this opera where he plays opposite a taller (blonde--shadows of Verdi?) soprano and towering, much handsomer males who are supposed to be his servant and his mentor. The production is aptly farcical, transposed as it is into the 20's.  Garanca is stunningly beautiful--how I wish she could play Desdemona!  Maybe Rossini's. But the show really belongs to John Relyea and Simone Alberghini as Alidoro and Dandini respectively. Durkin and Risley are perfect as the rival siblings, and Corbelli does a decent job.  In this case, though I have my serious reservations about Cecilia Bartoli overall, I prefer that more traditional and equally funny production.",1400025600,2,824,5.172932330827067
5636126,5,B00BKG6S0O,"Dramatically, many of the most highly rated operatic performances are disasters. In a highly rated performance of Wagner's Ring cycle, one of the giants - fitted with abnormally long artificially arms - inadvertently cups the diva's breast with his artificial hand for an extended time during an aria, producing an awkward effect to say the least. Oh well, an audiophile may listen to opera but not care about the drama, but the absence of the dramatic element can render the production uninspiring. Perhaps that is why opera puts most people to sleep. This 2009 performance of Rossini's La Cenerentola is an outstanding exception. This delightful video would be an excellent introduction to opera, or a game-changer for someone who thinks the medium is not for her.

As noted by others, every singer is musically satisfying, fully up to Rossini's challenging runs. The pit orchestra is equally competent. The staging and camera work are stunning, providing many delights for the eyes.

But what makes this performance stand out is the enchanting Elna Garana in the title role. In her mid-thirties at the time of this performance, she is lovely and radiant, not only in appearance but in manner. Without denigrating the exceptional mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli, who also performs La Cenerentola on a currently available recording, Garana's acting makes the role of the ingenue approachable and believable. Simply put, she brings good theatre to the opera house. Her acting ability, coupled with her movie-star-like beauty, could easily land her a leading role in a popular film.

The supporting cast is equally fine. Opera can be stilted (no one sings as people lay dying) but this cast has fun with Rossini's variation on the classic Cinderella tale, making the awkward moments more than tolerable. The final enjoyable touch is Lawrence Brownlee as the prince. A fine tenor and a reasonably good actor, for an opera singer, his genuineness makes us root for romance to triumph, and of course it does. Where, in the illusion-spinning arts, does a black man, several inches shorter than the leading lady, win fair damsel's heart and hand? That never happened on Lawrence Welk's show. Perhaps justice is possible, and dreams come true after all.",1391299200,4,2244,5.1256830601092895
5636127,4,B00BKG6S0O,"Until about a year ago I had never heard of Elina Garanca but after watching her in the Baden-Baden Operafest, I would go out of my way to see her, she even managed to outshine Anna Netrebko that evening, and that takes some doing!

I have seen a number of performances of Cenerentola, both live and on video, and all of them have them seemed to combine great singing with less than stellar staging.  What is it about this opera which brings out the worst in opera directors?  However I will put up with it to hear the likes of Garanca, Bartoli, Berganza, Von Stade, Corbelli, Montarsolo etc.

So why should you choose this performance?  Elina Garanca is not a natural Rossini singer with the very rapid vocal flexibility that is required, as she admits (and which is why she has dropped them from her repertoire.)  Cecilia Bartoli and Teresa Berganza are technically more traditional.  Frederica Von Stade gives a much better sense of a young girl falling in love, but there is something a bit hypnotic about Elina Garanca's assumption of the role of Angelina.  She certainly inhabits the role even if she looks more like a glamour girl than a kitchen maid.

Alessandro Corbelli as Don Magnifico is terrific and a lot of fun to watch and listen to.  He is almost the ideal Rossini buffo and can reel off the patter songs and make them sound easy.  I say 'almost' because nobody does these roles the way that Paolo Montarsolo did, but here is one case where there is no stigma to being second best.

Lawrence Brownlee has to be one of the best Rossini tenors that I have ever heard, he has everything that it takes, power, flexibility and beauty of tone, and he is clearly having a lot of fun - something not to be ignored.

The rest of the cast are good and the orchestra and chorus under Maurizio Benini generate the sense of sparkle and fun that the score requires.

All things considered, ignoring the silliness of the staging, I would consider this to be the best all around Cenerentola.  There are other performances where one or two roles are better sung but none at this consistently high level.  So why only 4 stars?  I would give it 5 if I didn't have to watch that silliness, but I am not going to close my eyes when Garanca, Brownlee or Corbelli are on the stage!  Call it 4.5

P.S. There is a YouTube video of Joyce DiDonato, another great Rossini mezzo, talking with Alessandro Corbelli about how to learn and sing Rossini patter arias.  It is worth finding and watching.",1388620800,,2485,4.516778523489933
5636128,4,B00BKG6S0O,"Other reviewers have captured what's great about this production but the only thing holding me from a 5 star award is the casting of Brownlee as the prince - great voice for sure with good acting movement but just does not quite fit this role. Everyone else is just perfect: special mentions to Garanca, well voiced, pretty, coy but defiant and loving when she needs to; Alessandro Corbelli as the father - is there a better living character bass actor? his movement and facial expressions are perfect; Simone Alberghini as Dandini - excellent; Aussie Rachelle Durkin as Clorinda is one of the best female buffo character actors/singers around (her performance as Norina in Sydney Opera's 2013 Don Pasquale was fantastic!). With many versions of Cenerentola, this one is still my favourite!",1381708800,,790,5.038167938931298
5636129,5,B00BKG6S0O,this opera dvd is a real pleasure to watch. beautifully sung and staged.  one can't go wrong with acquiring this blu ray disc. the principal singers are superb and certainly know their way around this rossini score!,1381276800,2,215,4.8108108108108105
5636130,5,B00BKG6S0O,"Cenerentola, to me, is one of those special operas where multiple versions on the opera shelves are justified, if not a necessity. Operas like Boheme, Lucia, Manon and Traviata have such musical and theatric variables that viewing different performances is a delight. This is one of four Cenerentolas I treasure and watch a lot.

So, what's so special about this one?

First is the quality of the singing; there ain't a less than splendid voice in the cast. I first experienced Mme Garanca in the Baden Baden gala (which is still available on DVD and is a must-have). The fact that she sings a fabulous Cenerentola here and and equally fabulous Carmen on another disc should be sufficient evidence of her vocal and acting talents. Brava!!

Lawrence Brownlee (Don Ramiro) is one of the new breed of bel canto trained tenors so essential to these roles. Traditional tenors, such as those whose work I first experienced as a much younger opera-fan-in- training, cannot manage the extended range and devilish coloratura which Rossini and others composed. Brownlee does and in fine style. Bravo!!

Alessandro Corbelli (Don Magnifico) is probably the best buffo basso presently on stage. He has perfectly mastered not just the vocal complexities of the part, but the acting, which dates way back to the commedia dell'arte of the 15th century. Any time one sees him in a buffa role, the performance is going to be special. His scene in the wine cellar is definitive.

Simone Alberghini is a great Dandini. It is a part that demands acting skills as well as vocal ones and he does not disappoint.

John Relyea is a truly neat Alidoro. Too many portrayers of this role make it too formal and stiff. Relyea brings warmth and humor to the part.

The sisters, Clorinda and Tisbe, do not usually get much critical notice, but Mesdames Durkin and Risley are definitively mean spirited air heads.

Orchestra and chorus? This IS the Met, gentle reader, with arguably the best of both in today's opera world, and their Rossini sparkles.

Picture and sound are near perfect, which is what knowledgeable buyers expect from DG.

There are at least four renditions of Cenerentola availble on DVD, all of which are excellent. You cannot go wrong with this one, though; it's a near perfect performance from overture to finale.",1371686400,8,2303,4.8820512820512825
5636131,5,B00BKG6S0O,"This has already been released in Europe and despite a couple of small reservations is a sparkling and highly enjoyable performance. The singing is brilliant throughout with the Latvian mezzo as Cinderella as beautiful to look at as she is to listen to. I did not care too much for the sets and costumes which have been updated to what I guess is early 20th century Italy as this deprives Dandini and Don Magnifico of their bizarre costumes that both characters usually use to great effect to add to the humour, and as usual the Met cameras seem to of lower quality than say Opus Arte where the bit rates are at least 25% higher on the Glyndebourne release and it shows. Despite this however I enjoyed the performance very much and this is a strong rival to the Opus Arte disc.",1369872000,5,777,4.47887323943662
5636132,5,B00BKG6S0O,"After viewing a number of versions of La Cenerentola on YouTube, I finally decided to buy this one, and the more I watch and listen to it, the more impressed I am with it, both for the singers and for the staging. I do have a couple of quibbles, which I'll mention at the end, but on the whole this is the best Cenerentola I've ever seen. I've watched it all the way through four times since I bought it, and it improves with every viewing.

The voices, of course, are wonderful; Brownlee is unquestionably one of the best Rossini (and Donizetti and Bellini) tenors today, and Garanca's voice seems to soar effortlessly from her. But the amazing thing is how well the characters are developed vocally and emotionally. Most importantly, this is the only production I've seen where I've actually believed in the reconciliation at the end, and in Cenerentola's ""happily ever after."" In some productions, for example, Don Magnifico is so maliciously abusive all the way through that it's impossible to believe in his ""repentance"" at the end, any more than in his tears earlier when he claimed that the third sister had died. In one version, Cenerentola was so beaten down and hangdog all the way through that I couldn't believe she was capable of being happy, even after her marriage to the prince. But the worst, I think (and some people here will probably jump all over me for this), was the ending of the Florez/DiDonato version. No, I didn't mind the crazy costumes in this one, and I even liked the mice; they helped keep everything light-hearted. And of course Florez and DiDonato sing beautifully. What I hated was Cenerentola's being left alone on stage with her mop at the end, with the implication that the whole thing has been just a dream. (Okay, so she's still wearing the bracelet. The fact remains that we've just SEEN the prince leaving her alone on stage and everyone carting off all the furntiture. This is a visual message of abandonment and deprivation. The message seems to be: ""Dream all you want, but when you wake up you'll be back in the ashes again."" This is especially cruel after Cenerentola's aria in which she sings that her years of pain were all a dream.)

Oops, I seem to have strayed from the Brownlee/Garanca production. Sorry. I spent thirty years teaching medieval and Renaissance drama, and I tend to be very conscious of visual messaging in staging.

So. Back to the production at hand. One of the things that makes the ending of this version so believable is that all the way through, the sisters and father have knocked each other around as much as they've knocked Cenerentola around, and a few minutes after smacking, kicking, shoving, and otherwise ""abusing"" each other, they're showing great affection for each other. They're a very physical, rough-and-tumble family -- and in the way Garanca plays Cenerentola, not just feisty but with a touch of mischief in the way she sometimes actually goads the sisters, it seems as though what she really wants is to join in the fun, i.e., get the affection along with the fighting. The ending, then, is brilliant: Cenerentola serves her stepfather and stepsisters slices of the wedding cake -- not as a servant, this time, but as a hostess -- and then Tisbe feeds Cenerentola a forkful of cake from her own portion. Bingo. Brilliant. The family has accepted Cenerentola's forgiveness, and Cenerentola has been accepted into the family. I love it.

In this regard, I think the ""cartoonishness"" of the sisters that a couple of people have noted here is part of what makes the ending work. (And in fact Rachelle Durkin, who sings Clorinda, strikes me as a natural comedienne, something like Imogene Coca in her best days.) Also, casting Corbelli as Don Magnifico instead of as Dandini works as well: he, too, is too buffoonish and out of his depth to be taken seriously as a villain, especially with Dandini tamed down to a more subtle brand of comedy by Alberghini. Everything is just marvelous about this production ... except ...

Okay, two quibbles. First, Alidoro is too young and attractive. It's unsettling when someone apparently Cenerentola's age calls her ""figlia,"" and when I first saw her snuggle up to him after the first part of his ""La del ciel"" aria, I was a bit taken aback; she seemed to be switching her affection from one young man (Ramiro) to another (Alidoro). At least they could have greyed Relyea's hair. (But I loved the visual pun on his name: ali d'oro = gold wings.) Second, and I hate to say this because I love both Brownlee and Garanca, there just doesn't seem to be much chemistry between Cenerentola and Ramiro until halfway through, when Ramiro sidles up to her during the banquet at the ball. Sigh. Other than these two quibbles, though, this is a brilliantly sung and staged La Cenerentola, and I keep watching it over and over again.",1364515200,2,4849,4.733727810650888

5636136,3,B00BKG6S0O,"The performance here is a very fine one. The leads sing wonderfully, with Elina Garanca the best ever Angelina on DVD (she surpasses Frederica von Stade with her exalted level of singing and beautiful timbre).
That said, this production is problematic, not in musical terms, alas, but in dramatic terms.
The resultant problem begins with the casting of Lawrence Brownlee as Prince Ramiro.
Brownlee is a very capable tenore di grazie. If this is a CD recording, he would have passed the test with flying colours. In visual terms,however, his casting posed much problems, as other reviewers noted.
The major impact is that La Cenerentola has become a moral play instead of a romantic story with this casting - the Prince (not Charming) is noble and intelligent, aided by the wise Alidoro, his mentor, in his choice of the most 'eligible' (in terms of character as well as looks) spouse. That Prince Ramiro has chosen a wonderfully charming 'substitute' to attract those who look for exterior qualities is without a single question in this production: Simone Alberghini's Dandini is such a fabulous looking 'imposter' that he practically supplants Brownlee in the role of 'Prince Charming'.
'All that glitters is not gold' is the new theme for this MET La Cenerentola.

With this new approach, the traditional expectations of a La Cenerentola fall flat on the face. Those who have viewed Ponnelle's film version of 1980 are undoubtedly particularly disappointed with this MET twist.

This is particularly regrettable that the cast performs so well overall!",1350345600,,1553,5.110236220472441
5636137,5,B00BKG6S0O,"This 2009 HD version of MET's Rossini's popular piece has since generated much controversy and debate.
I for one approached initially this with much caution, having been forewarned by the considerable informed reviews of this, principally on the sets and then on the protagonist, particular in the person of Brownlee's Prince Ramiro.
I owned the Bartoli-Gimenez 1980's DVD, and the DVD of Didonato-Florez also of 2009. I have also seen, though not owned, the deluxe Glyndebourne production, with also Alberghini as an outstanding Dandini.
I must say that this MET version clearly outshone all the other three by far.
First about the production. This certainly lacks the sheer visual splendor of the beautiful Glyndebourne production, but is still well above the acceptable level considering the Liceu production's bizarre sets.
In the lead role, direct comparisons may be made between the illustrious Bartoli/Gimenez and Didonato/Florez with the present production.
I find both Didonato and Garanca to be superior to Bartoli in terms of vocal performances, both being more florid and well-articulated. In the visual terms, Garanca is a stunning Cenerentola, appropriately tuned-down in the earlier part, but amazingly gorgeous in her scenes of glory. Bartoli is also very convincing, much more so than Didonato in the Liceu production.
But what gives this MET production its flying colours is the wonderful teamwork put in by ALL sectors - director Gary Halvorson, conductor Benini, the MET chorus, and ALL those taking singing parts, be it leading protagonists or those in supporting roles.
As the major supporting roles, Alessandro Corbelli and Simone Alberghini deserve the highest credit as the vainglory father and sham prince. Both Italian baritones sing in great bel canto style, with spitfire agility and terrific articulation. Their solos, duets, ensembles are all coupled with thoroughly hilarious vocal and physical acting, presenting the Italian buffo operatic style in the most exemplary sense. Both men look their parts, sing their parts, act their parts with flying colours.
As the weird sisters of La Cenerentola, Risley and Durkin are both highly effective, pouring in every ounce of their musical and dramatic commitment into their performances. John Relyea was luxurious casted in the relatively small role.
Then we come to the leading roles, Elina Garanca as Angelina and Lawrence Brownlee as Ramiro.
Garanca is probably without a doubt the best Cenerentola currently available. Her understated and natural beauty lends much credibility to the role of the underdog daughter of Don Magnificio. She sings with wonderful agility and precision the treacherously difficult arias and ensembles of Angelina. If there is anything to quibble, it is as some reviewers have rightly noted, her relative `uninvolvedness', which may be deliberate, given the underdog character of Angelina in the plot.
The biggest reservation shown in this illustrious performance has been to Brownlee's Prince Ramiro. Brownlee is certainly no Prince Charming in the traditional sense. However, Ramiro's role is not as big as some might have thought. Brownlee sings in great style, and owns a very beautiful voice. The resultant effect of Brownlee's casting is not damaging at all.
The ensembles are wonderful, be it duets, trios, quartets or choral. Great efforts have been spent in rehearsing this, and much credit goes to conductor Benini.",1345507200,6,3431,5.414953271028037

Cinderella:  Fantastic.  Great vocals and she fit the mold.  Well done.  What a tonal range!

The Prince:  He is terrible and facial expressions are empty, I've heard him in several opera's produced by the met including Armida.  His voice is strained and weak.  His tonal range is very small.  I think he is the weakest link in the chain.

Supporting Cast:  There are some great performances by the supporting cast.

I would recommend finding one with a bit more of a production/set.  This one was very plain and boring.  Also look for a better performer for the prince.

WITH all of those negatives, it is a great opera and can entertain younger kids, which is always a plus with an Opera.  The sub-titling for english was ok, but not really filled out well enough.",1325721600,2,846,4.601351351351352
5636140,2,B00BKG6S0O,"I have just finished watching this opera DVD. I would like to write a lot, but my bad English (I'm living in Lithuania) limits me... Well, if you have seen Jean - Pierre Ponnelle production - you have seen the best possible version of this opera!!! I have bought a new DVD just because Elina Garanca is singing there. I'm a great fan of her not to mention she is Latvian and I'm Lithuanian! I have read reviews where spectators were complaining THE PRINCE is not tall enough, ect, they say  they would better turn off the TV and just listen to soundtrack... In jazz music (I'm a fan) there was a tenor sax player Johnny Griffin, his colleagues called him ""little giant"". So in this opera performance LAWRENCE BROWNLEE is ""little collosus"", the only one who is ""at home"" with Rossini music! Even my favourite Elina Garanca doesn't fit! Just listen how she sings Carmen, or in Anna Bolena!
The stage design is pure catastrophy - look at the final scene where a giant wedding cake is being rolled on the scene - it is in the best tradition of ""Americana"" - coca cola, mcdonnnalddss, ect! When Lawrence Brownlee is being left to stand alone on that cake it looks like the producer wants to make laugh at him - the singer is black, small, ect. - in any words different from all the other characters... And yet he is the real star of this cast!

When you watch J.-P. Ponnelle version, you encounter such giants as Frederica von Stade, Paolo Montarsolo and particularly Claudio Desderi. The scenography is top class, costumes - too. Here, just watch the scene in the first act with choir where Dandini & Prince appear for the first time: in Ponnelle's production it is breathtaking, and here you can see a pair of clowns with a Rene Magritte style choir in the background standing and doing nothing...

Elina Garanca (my favourite mezzo-soprano) is not a Rossini singer... Just listen to Frederica von STADE OR TEREZA TERGANZA! In Rossini operas ""bad guys"" are maybe not that bad, just funny (Bartolo, Don Basilio). Here Don Magnifico and particularly his doughters make me sick!!!!!! Dandini is ZERO if to compare him to Claudio Desderi! In general - acting on this production is next to ZERO! and that bad are costumes and decorations!
If you will ask: well, what is resume - I'd answer: from all of the opera DVD recordings I know just Pucinni's TOSCA with Catherine Malfitano, Shirley Verrett and Anghella Gheorghiu, also R.Strauss Salome with Teresa Stratas and Catherine Malfitano are equil to each other. For other recordings - if you have your favourite, I doubt you will find anythig as good...

Once again I apologize for bad English... I only wanted to share my point of view with those who these days still listen to such an ancient thing as OPERA!!!!!

5636141,5,B00BKG6S0O,"The Met's 2010 production of Rossini's La Cenerentola has quickly become one of my favorites ... thanks in most part to the splendid performance of Elina Garanca.  Her singing is top notch and her acting is quite compelling - the moment she first sets eyes upon the prince (in disquise as the valet) leaves me breathless, as she falls in love at first sight, as does he. Ms. Garanca is well deserving her ever-growing acclaim.

The rest of the cast performs admirably as well. Lawrence Brownlee, starring as the prince is as fine a bel canto tenor as I've heard, and acts the part of the prince nicely.

Simone Alberghini stands out as Dandini (the prince's valet) for his fine comic acting, and the Don Magnifico role is performed well by the great Alessandro Corbelli.

While some reviewers felt the production to be ""over the top"" at times, I feel that it was wonerfully done.

As to be expected, the video and audio are of a high quality.",1312502400,4,942,4.583333333333333
5636142,4,B00BKG6S0O,This performance is a splendid version of Rossinis opera. Elina Garanca is our favorite mezzosoprano and as usual she made a fantastic performance. Suprisingly the men voices were almost at same level.,1300924800,,201,5.3125
5636143,5,B00BKG6S0O,"This is a GREAT La Cenerentola!  Elina Garanca does a wonderful job of interpreting the role and of singing.  Her voice is pure, clear, sweet, acrobatic and pitch-perfect.  The production is just right, with minimal costumes/make-up and scenery.  The ugly step-sisters (beautiful women who used facial expressions, costumes and body movement to make them appear unattractive) are hilarious, as is the step-father.  Although he is a real buffoon, he is frightening when threatening Cinderella and pushing her around.  Lawrence Brownlee does a charming job as the prince and can really sing coloratura.  I didn't like this opera much the first time I watched it because I'm not much into buffo, but watched it a few times because I like Elina Garanca. It has become one of my favorites!",1288569600,,784,5.078125
5636144,5,B00BKG6S0O,"Elina Garanca and Lawrence Brownlee enter the the first rank of Cinderella stars as the Principal and her Prince in this vivid production of Rossini's comic classic. Together with a fine cast of adept performers they give life and spirit to perhaps the happiest of opera's in any House's repertoire. It should create a glowing aura round any TV monitor when shown at home.
The scenic design, which deliberately dwarfs the players, will suit the tastes of some but not of others; similarly, the fact that Mr. Brownlee is shorter than the woman he loves, and hopes to marry, may bother some. For me these were suitable attributes of a fairy tale. The colors are rich both in scenery and costume,the voices admirably adept in handling Rossini, there is never a stagnant moment.
All in all, something for all of us to cheer about and an entertaining family evening. It joins that group of recordings of a favorite opera which are reliable choices for purchase or rental.",1270512000,,966,4.790419161676646
5636145,4,B00BKG6S0O,"Like many other viewers, my first experience of this performance was live at a local movie theater (and a glorious afternoon it was).  While Cesare Lievi's production utterly misses the mark (I will explain why later on), this performance of LA CENERENTOLA boasts one of the strongest casts for the four principals which you could find today.  Elina Garanca gives the best interpretation of the role of Angelina - vocally and dramatically - in my experience.  Her dark, rich voice sails effortlessly through the most grueling passages of coloratura with not a hint of aspiration.  And she is an enchanting stage presence in the role, modestly radiant and unpretentious.  American tenor Lawrence Brownlee, who is quickly becoming one the world's great bel canto stars, has a glorious, robust tenor and etches his coloratura with fearsome precision.  While his acting is not his strongest point, he puts across the Prince's anger and authority convincingly at the opera's denouement.  Italian bass-baritone Simone Alberghini makes a charismatic Dandini, one who fully enjoys the comic implications of the master/servant exchange.  That Alberghini's voice may lack brightness and agility for the role doesn't seem to matter, as his looks and gestures fit the role like a glove.  Don Magnifico is played by buffo extraordinaire Alessandro Corbelli.  Really, nothing more need be said, but I will nonetheless: this is a magisterial buffo performance, a marriage of balletic physical comedy (just watch his drunk act during the wine tasting aria) and rich, intelligent vocalism, with a disturbing hint of Magnifico's impending dementia.  I found Canadian bass John Relyea's Alidoro wanting, woolly-voiced and a bit awkward on stage; meanwhile, Rachel Durkin and Patricia Risley, the two stepsisters, are saddled with overdone comic shenanigans.  The Met Orchestra is up to its usual high standards under conductor Maurizio Benini.  One objection from the historical-performance fanatic in me: when is the Met going to buy a fortepiano? A harpsichord tinkling away in the recitatives of an opera written in 1817 sounds anachronistic, to say nothing of its acoustical disadvantages in an opera house this size.

Cesare Lievi's production discards the deeper emotional and spiritual resonances of Rossini's dramma giocoso in favor of a superficial, comic book approach.  Set in a vaguely 1920's milieu, the production is dominated by oversized striped walls and other set pieces which rob the opera of any intimacy.  This is a reductive understanding of ""Rossinian comedy"".  If you want to see what LA CENRENTOLA can be in the hands of a director who understands its intellectual and historical context, then get the 2005 Peter Hall production from Glyndebourne on Opus Arte.  That performance again features a wonderful Dandini from Simone Alberghini and is filled with an excellent young cast.  That said, the splendid HD medium lends itself well to Lievi's sets, and the production is a pleasure to watch.",1267228800,8,2999,5.315677966101695
5636146,3,B00BKG6S0O,"This is a beatifully sung, but, on the whole, unremarkable performance.

Elina Garanca is the highlight in the title role.  She exhibits a lovely voice, excellent technique and beguiling acting.  Indeed, she's the best part of this persentation.  Lawrence Brownlee sings beautifully, but it's hard to overlook the disadvantages of his stature.  His Dandini towers over him and even Cenerentola is much taller than he.  I'm sure I'll return to this DVD to HEAR him, but I think I'll just play the music and not watch the video.  Alberghini, Reylea and Cobelli are fine in their respective roles.

The production is inoffensive, if just a bit silly.  Like another reivewer, I didn't like Alidoro's angel wings, espcially as Rossini intentionally left the supernatural out of this opera.  I also thought the oversized wedding cake in the final scene was over-the-top rather than entertaining.

On the whole, the DVDs with von Stade (my personal favourite) and Bartoli (before mannerisms overtook her obvious intelligence) are to be preferred.",1266710400,18,1039,5.198795180722891
5636147,4,B00BKG6S0O,"I saw this production live onstage in 1997 with Cecilia Bartoli in the title role (Alessandro Corbelli was the Dandini, Ramon Vargas the prince, Michele Pertusi the Alidoro, with Levine conducting), and have to say that I'd rather have had that cast on DVD. That said, there is some wonderful singing and music-making among this cast. Corbelli, one of operatic history's greatest Dandinis, is now very much in demand as Don Magnifico, as is Lawrence Brownlee as Prince Ramiro. Garanca is a physically lovely and vocally elegant Cenerentola; her heroine is both touching and strong. Brownlee possesses considerable musicality and a formidable technique, despite his tendency to sing with his head a bit sideways; and Corbelli displays his usual undisputed mastery with character and text, creating a more ""human"" and less farcical Magnifico than is more often seen. The Alidoro and Dandini are quite serviceable, if unremarkable.

Soundwise, there seem to be some problems with the mics downstage left--whenever the singers have to go to that quadrant of the stage, they suddenly sound as if they're singing in an adjoining bathroom with a very echo-y shower.

As for the production, I didn't much care for it in 1997, and it still hasn't grown on me. Visually cartoonish, there are too many predictable moments in the staging. For example, in the famous sextet ""Quest'e' un nodo avviluppato"" (""This is a tangled knot""), Ramiro winds a rope around the other singers. And at the end, he and Cenerentola appear on top of a huge wedding cake. How imaginative is that??? I've seen much better. Still, for over-all singing and Corbelli's Magnifico, this is a good DVD to have.

BUT FOR A BETTER ALL-AROUND PERFORMANCE, stick with the 1995 production from Houston Grand Opera with Bartoli, Gimenez, and Corbelli (as Dandini).<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rossini-La-Cenerentola/dp/B00005BEYB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rossini - La Cenerentola</a>&nbsp;The singing is more stylish, and the ensembles much more razor-sharp in the Houston production than on the Met DVD.",1266451200,31,2101,5.498452012383901

If there is any problem, it is with the opera itself, which after more than two hours of musical pyrotechnics has a rather long and flat denouement with the prince noticeably having little left to do except gaze at his bride.

Ah but when that bride is the staggeringly beautiful and talented Elina Garanca, even the end of La Cenerentola works out well. This is Garanca's show, and she does not disappoint. She is for me the finest mezzo soprano working in the biz today.",1517875200,,613,4.614678899082569

8569972,4,B00BKG6S0O,"La Cenerentola is one of Rossini's most popular operas. It is unlike the fairy tale, but is a beautiful story about character and the triumph of good or beautiful character over selfish greed. In the MET production, the singers have great voices and the opera is done well. But, it has some defects due to the staging, costumes, gimmicks that do not fit the period. It appears that it is stages in 1920 NY. However, there are costume changes of the step sisters that do not make sense, nor does the the writing with quill pens fit the modern period period. Overall, the staging seems cold in comparison with other versions I have seen. In some ways the production departs from the sentiments in the text. I do not regret purchasing this opera, but I have other versions that I think are better. The sets and staging of the MET production create some awkwardness I think for the actors. The productions I enjoyed most of La Cenerentola are the Glyndeborne and Salzburg productions. They have more warmth and the acting is more effective. There are many productions available of La Cenerentola available, because it is a true masterpiece. But, check out carefully before buying, because you will find some newer productions, which attempt to make the opera contemporary. However, in my onion, these trash the original opera. You can find video clips of many productions. Check those to see if you like what they did.",1431734400,,1414,4.775510204081633
