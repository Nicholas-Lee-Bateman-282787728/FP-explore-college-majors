7998902,5,B0000CBXYZ,"The topics well explained and very interesting, the format of the show, which was recorded with a studio audience, is excellent. People participate in asking excellent questions which leads to further explanations and is quite informative. The program is excellent and the music at the end very good. Church pipe organ, classic hymnal.

It cannot ever be much better for an uppity agnostic even in a documentary format. That's for PBS or NPR radio program.  I came away from the DVD proud of the purchase since I was going to order the book. After the DVD, I order the book since it contains more information. The DVD covers a lot and Jeffrey uses his book throughout since the DVD is of the book itself. To be  ashamed that a Christian writer did much more to promote his book is silly, DVD is the book. Jeffrey has many books and never pitches for his books. He should since they are all very informative books and does help in understanding the Bible. Furthermore, he makes the Bible a must read. Seek and you will find. These books and the DVD here assist the seeker.

His Prophesy Bible is great. I managed to obtained one a few years ago. A good used one through Amazon. It's well researched and extremely helpful. His book ""Creation"" is a fantastic book so is the Bible Code book recently I obtained called "" The Handwriting Of God"". Agnostics hate it. So do liberal Jews.

His weekly show is gone. However, Hal Lindsey is available and well made, full of wisdom and extremely informative. His program is available several times a week at Hallindsey.com.  Jeffrey should do as Hal Lindsey via the Internet and not depend on false Christian Networks for air-time. Heck, Hal Lindsey moved away from California after years there. About time.

The program would have been much better in a documentary format. I came away from the DVD ashamed that a Christian writer did much more to promote his book than do similar secular programs.",1112054400,6,312,4.796296296296297
