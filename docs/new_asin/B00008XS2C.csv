1866432,5,B00008XS2C,"Lexx is so far the best show I ever liked. I even wrote Brian Downey and Michael McManus, trying to get them to say ""yes"" to my oncoming new ideas for animation Lexx. Since Lexx couldn't produce a spin-off, I asked Brian if Lexx can be animated and he said ""yes."" 2 months later after I mailed my first script, he turned me down and rejected the script. Me and Brian had a common email relationship to bring back Lexx how ever I wanted. I am not trying to hate him for what he did. I was just wanting to bring back Lexx for the sake of the fans.",1056153600,2,545,4.009174311926605

1866445,3,B00008XS2C,"Love LEXX, but as I've read elsewhere tis difficult to find a DVD copy that is mastered properly, and this one is certainly a very poorly mastered edition. It is watchable, but only just barely; fuzzy, out of focus, and issues with resolution inasmuch as I had to force my player to show this in the original standard 4:9 instead of the badly encoded widescreen. Non of the seasons of LEXX were ever produced or filmed in widescreen. This makes me wonder if these are even legal copies, or counterfeits.",1455062400,,503,4.6

1866457,3,B00008XS2C,"I am a big fan of the LEXX but these DVDs are a cheap. They don't even have a HD format to cover my TV screen.  They must be some kind of black market version because of the way they packaged with no way of knowing what disc you are starting with. I had to label and store my disc in blank DVD / CD  disc case, I had bought at Wal-Mart for computer burn CDs.

1866460,1,B00008XS2C,"I purchased Lexx- Season 3 just last week and was told to wait 7 to 10 days for shipment.  To my surprise the bubble taped package was in my mail on Saturday.  So to start with the delivery service was awesome but when I took the package out of my mail box it rattled like a box of rocks.  Having watched this series on Prime Star years ago and not being in a hurry I waited a couple days before inserting what I thought was disc- one in my dvd player and for a couple seconds I had a picture  I hit the play button and started the first disc.  That lasted maybe 10 seconds and suddenly my dvd player quit.  It is a new player, maybe not the best but new and it said I had a bad disc so I fought with it to give me the disc back and it finally did.  I looked at the disc and found scratches on the side of the disc from bouncing around in the mail.

1866493,2,B00008XS2C,"My purchase was the first 4 full length episodes of season 1, not sure why it keeps coming up here. Anyway season 1 first 4 episodes was not for a ""squeamish"" viewer like myself. I found nothing clever or entertaining. The beginning with Barry Bostwick had some potential but then everyone gets killed off except for the chosen few to carry the story lines. I thought each episode failed to bring me to any conclutions about what I had just viewed. The eating brains and flesh and the ""matter of fact"" slicing up human bodies while they are still feeling and breathing got old fast. The episode with the internal parasite snake creatures was so over the top I got totally turned off. Sorry just didn't like them at all.

1866501,4,B00008XS2C,"I don't know what you guys are watching this on but I watch it on a 16x9 TV with an HDMI dedicated DVD upscaler and there is nothing wrong with the DVDs. In fact they look better than Season 1 & 2 due to being filmed digitally. Star Trek the next Generation was filmed on Tape, Lexx season 1 & 2 were filmed on Tape. Season 3 & 4 were filmed digitally and transfered to Tape. Which is also the reason you will never see HD versions of this series, the same way you don't see HD versions of Star Trek TNG.

With a modern DVD player and TV you shouldn't have any over-scan and if you do it's a simple matter of adjusting your Picture size. I was disappointed about the Episode labels missing from the disks, as they were labeled on Season 1 & 2. That's easily resolved by looking under the Echo Bridge logo at the Numbers, the numbers get higher in value which is how you can tell. Also by default they are in order, so it's a simple matter of labeling them with a marker. Problem is resolved with a marker as the Episodes are labeled on the back of the box.

It also should be noted that even though this is Echo Bridge, the same people that bring you VHS quality to DVD (ugh) they actually did an OK job on this. Also Season 3 & 4 look better than Season 2 and in fact the quality is the same as I originally watched it on TV. If it looks better from some OOP (Out of Print) copy, it's probably artificial enhancements. And since those other copies are OOP, you can pay $10 for the Echo Bridge season 3 & 4; or you can pay almost $50+ for an OOP copy of just Season 3 -- nevermind Season 4. I've seen it as high as $100 in some places. Is it worth $100 for Lexx? Not for me and since Echo Bridge now owns distribution rights, you better get use to it or just forget about it. I'm totally satisfied with this release, far more than I can say about anything else Echo Bridge releases.",1394755200,4,1882,4.070080862533692
1866502,5,B00008XS2C,"No complaints, it's been fun to revisit this series, I'm not about to comment on the ""packaging"" because; duh, that not why I bought it!

I am so very sorry and regretful that I cannot recommend this work to my friends or children. What am I to say to my children and my friends who also have children? This topless nudity and sex engaged in as if there are no considerations about this behavior that a responsible and mature person should consider (especially considering all the trouble the characters usually get into after seeking it) says that there is no one in your production who is mindful or empathetic to the dangers as well as the challenges of life especially where our natural desires are concerned that loving parents want their beloved children not to suffer or be destroyed by.

I love these characters and this show but there was none of this that I can remember when seeing when I watched the show. And though I quite concerned by the frivolous way that sex was handled in the show at least I didn't see R rated scenes in it at the time.

Once again I commend the talent, the characters and the wonderful actors who portrayed them but I am compelled as a responsible parent to put these discs in the garbage for my children's and my coming grandchildren's sake because I want them to have the wonderful gift of sex within the bounds that will strengthen them and give them a joyful life and not one filled with trouble and grief.

With much love and regret,

1866506,5,B00008XS2C,"How the *beep* isn't this more famous?

ATTENTION TO ALL SCI-FI FANS LOOKING FOR AN AMAZING SHOW: This is the ONE show where they don't spend 99% of the time talking inside a spaceship. On this one, we actually discover a wide-range of new, strange, bizarre and original worlds and locations. OH YES.

It's ten times more entertaining, creative and imaginative than every other sci-fi series out there, except maybe for Farscape which I also bought the complete series and will begin watching when I'm done with Lexx.

Really though, I know some effects aren't good but if you can get past that then this is by far the best sci-fi series you'll get. With every new episode they dare to go even further instead of spending 99% of the episode inside the ship like all sci-fi series do and it's just so original you can't help but be enthralled by it.

You've got so many spots on the journey: they go to The Cluster, to Brunnis, to Pattern, then to Mantrid's Ice Planet, MedStat (space hospital), Luvliner (space brothel), TV World, the space jury, 791's industrial planet, Nook, Ruuma and then Woz, and that's only until season 2. Then you've got the BEST season which is S3 with the epic saga between the Fire & Water planets and its entire metaphysical plot about Heaven & Hell, plus all locations on Earth in the 4th season, like the stylish Transylvania episodes and the tropical beach in Xevivor, to name a few.

Lexx has something going for it that's rare and even exciting: it's just so damn imaginative. The plot can be hard to follow, the acting isn't always great, and the direction can seem pallid at times... but the art direction and just basic inventiveness and originality are remarkable. What Lexx does so well that few others shows can do is introduce you to a completely new world, something so fresh and bizarre that you can watch the same episode several times in different moods and have different experiences as a result.

And again, the art direction is ASTOUNDING: there are many scenes in this show, particularly the first and third season, that if frozen as a still and mounted as a poster would be better than the art in most people's homes. Lexx is like nothing you have ever seen before, or will again. It's very, very hard to describe it. You have to see it for yourself. You'll either hate it or, like me, join thousands who still think this is a series way ahead of its time, and the best & most underrated and underseen sci-fi to have ever graced the little screen.",1390867200,,2497,4.5874439461883405

1866508,4,B00008XS2C,Video quality was superb for a DVD type format. Don't know if you can get this series on Blue-Ray. No playable errors in this seasons shows.

1866509,5,B00008XS2C,"This is one of the best TV series ever produced.  It's funny, perverted, weird, and maintains a mature them without getting too corny with the comedy.",1387756800,,150,4.769230769230769
1866510,5,B00008XS2C,"Season Three takes place on two different planets circling each other. Not much space travel
goes on during  this season. The planets are called 'Water' and 'Fire'. I do not think there is a
need to describe what the planets are like. Needless to say Fire invades Water occasionally
using balloons. There's a joke there, somewhere, but I will restrain myself.

I have to say symbolism and sexiness run amok in these episode as the gallant three, Xev, Kai
and Stanley are split up and have individual adventures. Don't get too deep into the meaning
because perhaps all three will return to Lexx and travel onward. Or not. Leave the depth finders
to the sonar intelligentsia and just enjoy the ride. It is a real good one too.

The crew meet some people they knew from the Light Universe but those survivors do not have
a remembrance of their past. Amazingly their personalities stay the same though, it is just their
memories that dissipate. ""Alas, poor Yorick, I don't remember him Horatio.""
...............................................................................................................................
Let's take a break here and say that Season Three contains only 13 episodes on 4 DVDs, has
Dolby Digital Stereo 2.0 and the aspect ratio is a Full Screen at 1.33:1. Okay, break over...
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once on the planets the crew visits aptly named burgs called, 'Gametown', 'Garden', Boomtown'
and 'Girltown'. All listed, and more, are specialty towns, as each name implies. Among some of
the problems you will encounter is that Kai (the dead assassin) has trouble functioning without
his com-padres, Xev (pun alert!) is courted by the 'Prince' from, where else, the Fire planet,
and Stanley dies.

Oh darn, forgot to yell Spoiler ALERT! Oh well. Things happen; actors are replaced, guest stars
continue to not appear and the Lexx travels on gobbling planets and looking for a home. Yes, the
adventure continues to the other side of the sun and to another planet that looks suspiciously
like...no it can't be. Little blue orb in the spacious sky, is that you?

Just to help you understand why this other planet was not so noticeable think of the sun being
the size of a door and this other...bluish planet...is the size of a nickel. Puts things into
perspective doesn't it?

Well, hurry up and finish Season Three because once they hit the planet on the other side of
the sun things get really weird. And you thought things were already '9' on the Weird Scale?",1387670400,,2558,5.224390243902439

1866512,3,B00008XS2C,"The quality of the DVD is OK, not perfect but good enough, specially considering the price.  Just putting a dang number on each disc would have been a great improvement.  The episode lists are on the disc, and a serial number that is in order with the shows, but a simple ""disc 1 of 5"" would have gotten this an extra star rating.  And a season number would be nice too.  As for the show, season 3 was excellent and told a great story.  Season 4 seemed more like a sit-com.  Both seasons were entertaining, but in very different ways.  Glad I bought the cheaper version of this show.  I was hoping for more of the season 3 type sci-fi.

1866540,1,B00008XS2C,"Season 3 of Lexx is somewhat interesting, as we get a continuing story arc involving the ""nice"" planet Water and the ""evil"" planet Fire.  Prince, apparently the ruler of Fire, wants to destroy Water for reasons you'll discover later.  In this season, he's ominous and intimidating, but as Season 4 progresses, he just gets increasingly campy.

""South Park"" and ""Red Dwarf"" are crude, clever, and funny.  ""Pee Wee Herman's Big Adventure"" is silly and funny.  ""Dumb and Dumber"" is stupid and funny.  ""Lexx Season 4"" is crude, silly, and stupid, without being very clever or funny.  ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" is good because it's bad.  Season 4 is just bad.  This is surprising, since Season 3 was much better, and was largely written and directed by the same people.  The only Season 4 episode that approaches the quality of Season 3 is the series finale ""Yo Way Yo.""

This Season 3/Season 4 pack contains no extras, and I'm surpised that they can cram so many episodes on just 5 discs, which aren't numbered so you can't tell which is which.  There are 4 episodes across the two seasons that contain nudity (less than 5 minutes each episode).  This is not a sufficient reason to buy the set (you never see that much of Xev).  In these two seasons, 790, the insane robot head, who has transferred his infatuation with Xev to Kai, simply isn't funny.  At all.  Ever.

Season 3: 2.75 stars.  Season 4: 0.5 stars.  Average: 1.625 stars, rounded down.",1337126400,5,1445,4.662698412698413

1866542,1,B00008XS2C,"The loathsome Echo Bridge strikes again!  Here's everything you need to know:

- Five single-sided discs for 37 episodes stacked on a spindle
- The discs AREN'T NUMBERED, nor do they indicate which episodes are where, nor is there an insert provided with this information.  Think about this: THEY COULDN'T NUMBER THE DISCS
- At least one disc (4) has a whopping ten episodes crammed onto it!  This makes no sense given the episode-to-disc ratio
- Per above, there is noticeable pixelation/image break-up whenever several objects are on the screen and for fast-moving objects
- No extras (expected)
- For one last insult, the final episode (one of the series' finest) is actually OVERSCANNED.  The top and bottom of the image don't touch the screen edge and there are junk artifacts playing across the top, ala something you'd see on a bootleg or a work print.  I also noticed the first episode of Season 3 has the same issue, minus the artifacts.  No doubt other episodes have similar problems, but I wasn't about to waste my time on this set anymore

The above, coupled with the fact that EB couldn't be bothered to number the discs, and gives you a monochrome cover with images from the first season (for third and fourth season content) is beyond incompetence.  Fans are better off paying for the out-of-print Acorn releases which have a superior presentation.

UPDATE: I bought the Alliance version of Season 3 (http://www.amazon.com/Lexx-Season-Boxset-Brian-Downey/dp/B0040MGVE8/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1333499347&sr=8-5) and was relieved to discover that the image quality is on par with the Acorn release.

1866544,3,B00008XS2C,"Now in the Dark Zone, the Lexx crew are awakened after 3750-ish years (must be a kind of TV SF record) near a binary system of planets Fire and Water, both with towns with equally allegorical names and satirical functions, some more farcical than others. This season's adversary is (Isombard [sp?]) Prince, a constant tempter and trickster who dies a lot and will not stay dead. Paced rather like a comic strip or a soap opera sometimes, so certain episodes have very little happening. Even so, you have to watch all 13 episodes to get the full impact of this very long story.

All of ""Lexx"" 's previous strengths continue here, more drama now than comedy, with shifting characterizations and changing alliances, and the first hints of the show's guest cast entering multiple roles, for those who've watched the whole series so far. (also includes more fun recognizable guest cast, too)

I videotaped this season off satellite dish many years ago- it's definitely in stereo.  If you can't afford the older more expensive boxset, it's acceptable to watch. Just be aware shortcuts were taken for whatever reason.  Another note: there are obvious interlacing problems with the video, but I suspect the original source is the problem because my taped copy shows alot of the same issues.

1866551,4,B00008XS2C,"The end of season 2 saw the cast in the Dark Zone far away form any good planets.  They put themselves into cryo chambers with 790 watching the bridge.  As the season opens, four-thousand years have passed and the Lexx is very hungry and unable to fly.  They are stuck between two planets that share a common atmosphere.  These are the planets Fire and Water.  Fire is a roasting desert with tower cities and Water is a ball of water with floating cities.  The only apparent source of food for Lexx is one of the planets.  Travel to either planet is easy using a moth or a balloon.

But these two planets are strange in other ways as well.  People, particularly the ruler of Fire, don't stay dead.  There are no children and no one seems to know what they are.  Fire keeps trying to conquer Water as it has all of the resources.  Prince, the leader of Fire, is particularly interested in the crew and keeps trying to get them to blow up Water.  Eventually the true nature of the planets is revealed and the crew need to make some tough decisions on how to handle things.  The final episode ends with the crew heading for their next adventure.

This season is a single story in thirteen parts.  This can make it seem like things are not moving very fast at times.  Two episodes, Gametown and Boomtown, have huge amounts of nudity but most are similar to the previous season.  The strange nature of the planets, and some flashbacks, enable us to see many characters we thought were long gone from the show (you have to watch to find out who).  Our main characters also undergo some changes.  Right at the start 790 switches its affection from Zev/Xev to Kai.  Kai is colder, more machine-like, and rather indestructible.  Xev goes through quite a few mood changes.  Stanley is the most stable although he does manage to get lucky in a couple of episodes.

All in all it was an interesting season but quite different from what has gone before.  Fire is populated by very industrial images (even the balloon gondolas seem to be heavy steel) which is a change from the more organic look of previous seasons.  Overall I felt it was a little slow in parts and too much time seemed to be spent with part of the crew looking for a missing member.  I think the Fire and Water story could probably have been done in five or six episodes but then I was not in charge.  Each disk contains part of a Making Of special for the season.  This can provide spoilers so you may want to wait to watch them.  Also included on each dis are trivia, interviews and production designs.  Check it out.",1182297600,,2574,4.424307036247335
1866552,5,B00008XS2C,"Let's face it. Making an original AND entertaining sci-fi series is no small feat.  LEXX excelled those standards in its 3rd year of stories, or rather, the third adventure.  Whereas the four television movies established the origins of the Lexx and crew, and the 2nd series was a typical year of science fiction television, year 3 delved into a strong, never-disappointing subject matter - the elemental rules of good and evil and cause and effect.

Thousands of years adrift, the Lexx has almost no power and cannot escape the shared orbit of planets Fire and Water.  The  inhabitants of both planets have opposing ideals and ways of life, and some of them look familiar. Both planets would also make a good snack for the Lexx - but which one?  Here is where our favorite motley crew will come face to face with who they really are, and what they really want.

This show has got it all, and the actors are PERFECT for these characters. Xev looks as sexy and as gorgeous as ever, Stanley still longs for acceptance, Kai is one bad mo-fo, and 790 gets a bit reprogrammed, which introduces a whole new level of irony.  The introduction of Prince solidifies the cast and brings the show to a new level of class, (while remaining crude as always!)

1866554,5,B00008XS2C,"This was a big change from the campy season before and the surreal set of movies that happened in the season one.  The episodes in season 2 were like Red Dwarf.  Where they seemed to bounce randomly from one spot to another, and had little in realm of a long running plot until the later seasons.  Season two was a random bunch of episodes with only Mantrid and the Lexx crew binding them together.

This season not only had a long running story arc, but the humor was more subdued and focused on the surreal imagery and spiritual idealogies it presented.

The crew was shot into the dark zone after the destruction of the light zone.  You find that they were stranded in an empty area with no planets nearby, and no fuel for their ship.  So they go into sleep and drift until they find a decent planet.  But they are found before they have a chance to wake, but a strange individual named Prince.  He and his roadwarrior like lackeys take Stan prisoner and becomes interested in Xev.  He takes them to Princetown, his town on Fire.

Fire and Water are a pair of planets that circle each other and share atmosphere that can be traversed by balloons.  Fire is hot and unable to sustain life on the surface.  So the towns are tall stacks that lift them high enough to make it livable.  The areas below are filled with devices to keep the city cool by using slave labor.  Water is all water, dotted with towns on the surface.  The inhabitants are all living in luxury, giving little thought to the world around them, the future, or the past.  They seem to live for the moment and whatever passion drives them.  The towns on both planets are named for their leaders or their obsession, Gametown is filled with sports fanatics, Garden with the plant obsessed, Girltown is a matriarchy, and Boomtown where everyone has sex all the time.

But that isn't the end of the weirdness.  People seem to have little recallation of the past or who they are.  No one is born, they just remember when they were and nothing else.  The two planets have been fighting for ages but don't know why.  The crew see quite a few people that they knew in the Light Universe that are all dead, some with the same names.  They see Bunny, Schlemi, Mantrid, and Gigarotta that have no memories of their previous lives.  Plus Prince seems to know the most, but has his own agenda and is obsessed with getting the crew to fullfill this.

I didn't like this season when I first saw it, but it grew on me.  The humor was more subtle, darker, and surreal than the first one.  It was also more philosphical and spiritual than the previous series.  Dealing with re incarnation, planetary genocide, damnation, and eternal paradise.  The big bad wasn't standard as he wasn't out to kill the crew or the universe.  But he admitted repeatedly that he was neither good nor trustworthy, but wanted to make a deal.  plus he was harder to figure out than the other two, and even by the time the series is over you still don't know for certain what he is.

This was a great season that tends to grow on you.  The imagery and well thought out plot was worth the price alone.",1095638400,24,3125,4.424561403508772
1866555,4,B00008XS2C,"4.5 stars.  I can't give this volume 5 stars mostly because of yet another lack of reasonable plotting found mostly in the first episode ""Fluff Daddy.""  Also, while some of that episode qualifies as over-the-top parody of the Porn Industry, other portions are once again just plain dirty.  Here are the episodes:
4.09 Fluff Daddy--Stan thinks he has found his long-lost love, Lyekka, who apparently now works in the Porn Industry as an ""actress.""  He convinces everyone at the location that he is the new ""fluffer.""  If you don't know what a ""fluffer"" is, you will after watching this episode.  The other half of this episode shows Xev' Cluster Lizard half going through a reproductive cycle when she comes across her potential mate: a performance artist who looks similar to Kai.  Kai recites parts of ""Henry V"" while throwing tomatoes into a large fan while wearing a loin-cloth.  Bizarre.
4.10 Magic Baby--This episode is entertaining for the most part, but some of the plotting goes unexplained by the end.  Vlad is loose on The Lexx enslaving Moth Breeders while the three main characters return with two Druids with whom a deal was made for getting them back on board.  There are some humorous moments here, but the ending is a head-scratcher.
4.11  A Midsummer's Nightmare--Yes!  The show has characters singing again!  This show is a disturbing parody of Shakespear's ""A Midsummer Night's Dream.""  Oberon, Titania, and Puck are all, shall we say, ""flighty.""  Oberon wants a new ""wife"" and tries to recruit Xev, at first, then Stan after his first proposal is revoked.  This is a classic Lexx episode with singing, dancing, disturbing yet veiled dialogue, and some great character acting from the supporting cast.  A gem!
4.12  Bad Carrot--I am chuckling as I remember this episode.  Some of the humor in this one is so foul that it crosses the line from bad taste into the realm of outright hilarity.  The entire main cast is now on The Lexx with a carrot-shaped alien probe violating each memeber it comes into contact with.  I really can't explain further because I want this review to be posted.  Sufficed to say, if you love crude humor, then this episode is sublime.
This is easily the best volume in the series, thus far.",1086739200,4,2235,4.826315789473684
1866556,4,B00008XS2C,"This third season was where I was initiated with ""The Lexx.""  I came in completely bewildered and at the same time fascinated by what I was seeing.  I consider this show to be one of the most original sci-fi programs ever created, and this third series continues that tradition with some excellent computer graphics and bizarre yet mesmerizing scenarios.  What is different in this series as compared to the last is that while the second series was a collection of twenty singular episodes with a through-line plot, this third series is more like a single, long adventure story in 13 parts.  There are very few moments in this series that I thought the story was meandering or losing focus of the motivations of the main characters.  Also, many of the new character actors are superb.  All give memorable performances, with a particularly enthralling performance from Nigel Bennett who plays the character ""Prince.""  While the surreal, often nightmarish, story unfolds there is an underlying mystery that is gradually revealed.  The ""Making of..."" section on the DVDs are both informative and entertaining with shots taken from filming on location in Berlin, as well as on the sound stages in Nova Scotia.  This third series is an epic adventure that stands on its own once the main characters become familiar.  Newcomers to ""The Lexx"" should start with the original first series which consists of four 2-hour-long films for a more detailed backstory.  The second series also has some great moments and is certainly worth obtaining, as well.  This third series should be watched as a whole, and that is why I chose not to write reviews for each particular volume.  Let the journey begin...",1085875200,19,1689,4.967971530249111

7987805,3,B00008XS2C,"I would say this is the season that Lexx started to lose it. The Fire and Water story arch is still watchable, however it wasn't as exciting anymore and the lexx start to change from Scifi to more fantasy. I would keep to Season 1 and Season 2.",1503878400,,244,4.104166666666667
7987806,5,B00008XS2C,"Lexx is a weird TV show. And I loved it. The only show that even came close to the weirdness on display in Lexx was Farscape, also a four season sci-fi show. There is nudity in Lexx, but not in Farscape. The first actress playing the Zev character, Eva Habermann shows her breasts. The second actress playing the Zev character, Xenia Seeberg, from season two to four, doesnt. Other women are shown nude, but not Seeberg. Her character teases the Stanley Tweedle character for three seasons, but never gives the poor guy any relief. Bad Zev.

The best character is Kai, played by Michael McManus. Jeffrey Hirschfield and Tom Gallant also do outstanding work voicing the fourth and fifth characters, 790 and Lexx, respectively, and many other fine actors and actresses appear, including Rutger Hauer playing an absolute evil dweeb character.

Most sci-fi shows don't contain any nudity. Exceptions are, the pilot of Stargate SG1, Odyssey 5, some episodes of the second Outer Limits series from the nineties, Westworld, etc. Theres plenty of good stuff out there if you want to avoid nudity, but youll be missing out on some great sci-fi.

When Im not watching sci-fi and fantasy shows Im reading sci-fi and fantasy. Authors I like include Douglas Adams, Taylor Anderson, Isaac Asimov, Paolo Bacigalupi, Jack Campbell, Orson Scott Card, Arthur C. Clarke, Earnest Cline, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Joe Haldeman, Robert A. Heinlein, Frank Herbert, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Larry Niven, Andre Norton, Patrick Rothfuss, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, John Steakley, and Andy Weir.",1491091200,,1581,5.143968871595331

7987808,4,B00008XS2C,What can I say. LEXX says it all,1485129600,,32,3.125
7987809,3,B00008XS2C,I have to say that some of the series episodes were very boring. I know its tuff to keep the balls in the air. The first episodes with and involving the shadow were outstanding. I thought I would try the rest of the series. These actors were outstanding. However over the series and the arrival to earth just did not resonate well with me. Lexx 4 was not better. A few of the 46minute episodes were entertaining. Especially the one about the BruenG home world. Then these small one armed robots destroying the Universe seems silly. Lexx1 and Lexx 2 were good.,1481328000,,559,4.490196078431373
