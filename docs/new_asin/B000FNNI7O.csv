8124836,5,B000FNNI7O,"I just watched A Century of Quilts, and as an artist, I loved it.  I found it inspiring and uplifting visually even though I have no desire to make such elaborate quilts myself.  I would tackle making an Amish style quilt, and enjoyed learning more about them and the beliefs of the Amish reflected in their traditional, and very beautiful quilts.  For those who felt discouraged by seeing these exquisite quilts:  take heart!  Everyone starts as a novice.  While some possess astonishing talent, those who achieve wonderful works are those who persevere.",1412467200,,555,4.978260869565218
8124837,3,B000FNNI7O,"This is a PBS documentary of a show that was done by four national quilt organizations to choose the 100 best quilts of the 20th century. I remember seeing a book of the entire collection back in 2000 or 2001. Of course there are some marvelous quilts here, although I would not necessarily agree with the judging in all cases. For one thing, there is a decided emphasis on applique, and I am more fascinated by piecework. Nevermind; they are all exceptional, that can be said for sure. I don't think the entire 100 quilts are shown here; I didn't count.

There are a few from the earlier part of the century, but of course quilting exploded as an art form late in the 20th century, so the majority of the show are fairly recent quilts. They also express a wide variety of techniques, design concepts and themes. There is much on which to feast the eyes.

I suppose some quilters would find this film inspiring, but I find it intimidating. How could I ever hope to do something as exquisite? The answer is I can't, and in fact I'm not interested in making art quilts as such. I love the old piecework techniques, and the only quilt top I still have to work on is done with paper piecing, a technique that was not represented in the show at all. It is often called English paper piecing, and I suspect it was indeed invented by the English. In fact, I remember a story about a soldier who either invented it or made it popular who put together thousands of small hexagons from wool scraps from military uniforms. Paper piecing is about the only good way to work with hexagons, although it also works with other geometric shapes.

If you're a lover of art and appreciate hearing artists talk about their best works, you will love this documentary.",1336608000,,1745,4.481132075471698
8124838,5,B000FNNI7O,"A Century of Quilts: America in Cloth is a documentary about a juried exhibition of the best quilts of the 20th century. The interviews were limited to a few quilters because of time restraints of the video and also because many of the quilters are no longer living to tell their stories.  The quilters led us through their creative processes as artists beginning with the initial vision of their project, describing with passion the painstaking detail that goes into their craft and ending with their feelings about the final project.  I found it facinating and inspiring to be allowed into another person's intimate world of  creativity.",1241481600,8,639,5.009433962264151
8124839,3,B000FNNI7O,"A century of quilts is about a team of quilters who gathered together to select and assemble the 100 best quilts of the 20th century. The artists are discussed briefly, and their quilts and techniques are showcased.

I admit, I prefer more traditional piecing. Most of the quilts shown in the exhibits were way too modern for my tastes. I would really have liked to have seen more quilts from the depression era, more quilts with blocks, and traditional piecing methods. Also the vast majority of quilts are appliqued. I just am not into applique that much. The quilts, showcased towards the ends in which people paint on quilts, and in which quilts are designed to look like photos just don't resonate with me.

This video didn't enthuse me. It is short (1 hour), and seemed to feature way too many modern artists. I would've liked to see more traditional quilts which were functional as well as beautiful.",1160870400,28,907,4.734177215189874
