7901803,3,9870520847,"As an Argentino who grew up on asado I thought this would be interesting to watch. This s a beautifully shot DVD of high quality. The editing is outstanding. The manual that it comes with is printed on very nice paper. The asador clearly knows what he is doing. You can learn a lot of the basics of Asado Argentino but do not expect to go further than the basics. The style of teaching here is a lot more Emeril than Alton Brown. There are a lot of general remarks with no specifics (What kind of salt he uses, how much, amount of ingredients are never given). Which is not really a criticism, that's really how asado should be made. I'm just warning that if you are looking for exact measurements and detail instructions, this is not for you. But Marcelo Blanco makes it clear a the very beginning that there are many ways to make an asado and he is only showing one. The viewer is free to tweak the process. In fact, the encourage viewers to share their tips on their website. So buyers keep that in mind. There are 40 million Argentineans hence 40 million ways to make asado. You will not learn comprehensive knowledge from this DVD but you will get the basic idea.",1214524800,3,1168,4.362385321100917
