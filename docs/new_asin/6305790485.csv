7897502,1,6305790485,"This is a poorly done unprofessional tape with a strange opening and three of Ricky's songs repeated over and over--cutting off abruptly in the middle of a song!  Don't buy it!  There are excellent tapes available, and you should buy ""Ricky Martin: One Night Only"" and ""The Ricky Martin Video Collection""--both of which are excellent 5-star videos!!!",970790400,20,350,5.12280701754386
7897503,1,6305790485,"As mentioned in another review, this tape is not what I expected.  It is the same 3 videos over and over, obviously recorded over some other video  presentation.  It looks like this tape was part of a mass production  involving used videotapes!  My intent was to write to the production  company involved to complain, but I didn't see an address on the video  cover. If you don't already have these Ricky Martin videos, you may want to  have it, but it certainly is not worth the price asked, considering that  Ricky's videos will probably all be available soon from a credible  production company.",966556800,10,598,4.718446601941747
