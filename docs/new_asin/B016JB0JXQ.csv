7473110,5,B016JB0JXQ,"The US govt is worried about the possibility of the Apollo 11 mission being an embarrassing bust, so the Pentagon decides to have a Plan B: fake footage of an American moon landing. To do this, distressed CIA agent / Vietnam vet Kidman (Ron Perlman) travels to Britain to find Stanley Kubrick, all the while suffering from *vivid* war flashbacks that keep him from having anything resembling a normal life. After arriving in the UK, Kidman instead finds an incompetent stage manager Jonny (brilliantly played by Rupert Grint) who introduces his flatmate Leon (Robert Sheehan) as an imposter Stanley Kubrick. What starts off as a seemingly lackluster plot quickly becomes fraught with tension and, more importantly, a boatload of insane humor (Moonwalkers is absolutely a comedy).

I haven't seen Perlman in a film with so much grim humor since his role in the 1995&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/La-cit-des-enfants-perdus/dp/B0145H628M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">La cit des enfants perdus</a>. There was nothing remotely funny about Perlman's violence in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sons-of-Anarchy/dp/B00S9S12R0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sons of Anarchy</a>, but the brutal violence he perpetrates in Moonwalkers is oddly hilarious (kind of like The Three Stooges, updated for the 21st century by not holding back on the blood). The icing on the cake is Kidman being dosed by the blissful counterculture girl Ella (portrayed by the astonishingly beautiful and seductive French actress Erika Sainte), an ""act of kindness"" that actually does unintentionally help the vet deal with his debilitating 'Nam flashbacks.

Probably coincidentally, Ron Perlman's memoir&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Easy-Street-the-Hard-Way/dp/0306824183/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Easy Street (the Hard Way)</a>&nbsp;would seem to indicate the actor doesn't buy into the conspiracy theories about a faked moon landing, per part of a passage where he puts the year 1969 into context: ""A man had actually walked on the moon.""

Over the years I've seen sooo many renditions of acid or mushroom trips presented by different directors (just in the past month or so I watched an acid trip in the excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Diary-Of-A-Teenage-Girl/dp/B019HR55OW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Diary Of A Teenage Girl</a>&nbsp;and a mushroom trip in the anemic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bad-Roomies/dp/B018EZBRIG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bad Roomies</a>); just as IRL, no two trips are the same. Kidman's trip here is one of the best renditions of a psychedelic experience I've seen at the movies since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fear-and-Loathing-in-Las-Vegas/dp/B00007ELDF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</a>.
Moonwalkers is somewhat of a satire with social commentary between the lines, yet isn't particularly deep in any way. But, I couldn't wipe the grin off my face for most of its duration (despite a distaste for Robert Sheehan), so Moonwalkers gets 4.5 stars in my book.",1452902400,6,3271,6.801909307875895

How is this movie so unpopular? First of all, the story is great with lots of fun moments. Really funny, great actions scene, lots of artistic visuals and amazing acting. I am very critical when it comes to movies since I do storyboarding, but this one was shot so well that I was able to sink in and switch off my analytical brain and enjoy it. This became one of my favorite movies.",1462579200,,433,4.280487804878049
7473135,2,B016JB0JXQ,"Ron Perlman and Ron Weasley fire large guns, drop acid and fake the moon landing, not necessarily in that order. The concept brims with absurd potential, with Perlman's flashback-plagued war vet hoodwinked into taking a sleazy band promoter (Harry Potter alumni Rupert Grint) as a serious filmmaker and friend to Stanley Kubrick, but it loses most of its shine in the leap from paper to screen. The jokes fall flat, the satire lands limp and the cast, for all its unusual promise and zany unpredictability, is usually just going through the motions. There's a decided lack of urgency to this caper, even when two separate gangs of gun-wielding maniacs descend upon the production, and that spells doom for any film of this type. I may have smiled once or twice - the colossal screwup of their final film makes for some occasional fun - but its failures in the suspense genre are evenly matched by its shortcomings as a comedy. Seriously disappointing.",1458518400,,951,4.8765432098765435

7473149,4,B016JB0JXQ,"If weve got a guy that can make things look like they're on the moon then doesnt it make sense to film a pretend moon landing, just in case the real one doesnt work? Apollo 11 is about to launch and NASA is worried. If the Americans don't make it to the moon the set back could ruin the entire space program and the Russians will have the upper hand. In order to hedge their bets they ask CIA agent Kidman (Perlman) to travel to England and ask if director Stanley Kubrick if he will film a movie of men landing just in case. When Kidman meets Jonny (Grint) things get a little off track. This movie is hilarious, it makes you wonder and is very psychedelic. I really loved it and laughed a lot they entire time. On the other hand this is not a movie that everyone will enjoy. There is a little Oliver Stone (a la Natural Born Killers) vibe to this and I really enjoyed that aspect. This is a very funny but different type of comedy that many people will love, but just as many either won't like or won't understand. Overall, a movie that I enjoyed and fans of psychedelic comedies will as well. I give this a B+.",1456099200,2,1113,4.181395348837209

7473155,4,B016JB0JXQ,"In 1969 the US wants a backup plan in case the moon landing fails. Special Agent Kidman (Ron Perlman) with a suitcase full of money is tasked to go to London to convince Stanley Kubrick to make the film. Kidman doesn't like the British and through a series of events, Kubrick is out and Kidman is forced to make a production that had all the worse elements, with the director (Tom Audenaert) having to be told ""There are no Jellyfish on the moon."" Jonny (Rupert Grint) is a band manager for the ""Yellow Blackguards"" and is the go between for Kidman and the director ...and the mob is also after him.

What can I say, this is a stoner film. Kidman goes into a berserker mode as music from ""Clockwork Orange"" play in the background. Perlman, who played ""Hellboy"" is called an angel. The production has substance abuse written all over it.

Guide: F-bomb, no sex. Topless hippies (no silicon) Drug use. Blood and killing. Heads being blown off.

At one point in the film Rupert claims someone defecated on his Jimi Hendrix record. The label was Atlantic when Hendrix recorded on Reprise. Made the whole thing unbelievable.",1454371200,,1119,4.641414141414141

7473172,5,B016JB0JXQ,"I've seen Moonwalkers twice in the theater & several times at home, & I have laughed out loud every time. It is an incredibly fun film with a great cast. Ron Perlman is as always a force to be reckoned with. His character Kidman is powerful & sexy & complicated, but he is extremely funny as well. Rupert Grint & Robert Sheehan are a charming pair who give you the giggles & make you fear for their lives at the same time. The writing is quick & clever. There is plenty of eye candy in this one for you men out there, & there is a treat in store for you ladies with Perlman donning a bearskin once more. **Quest for Fire, anyone?** I haven't even mentioned the clothes! Far out, man.

Watch this movie. As someone I know & love says...If you don't like this one, you don't like ice cream. 5 STARS

Perlman's Agent Kidman is tough, violent, and obviously suffering from PTSD.  Grint's Jonny is a hapless fellow, but he does try his best.  The story is as advertised, ""based on an actual conspiracy theory"".  Zany and colorful, and lots of fun, much like the era it depicts.",1453161600,2,457,4.604938271604938

8736524,4,B016JB0JXQ,"I'm not sure what I can say about this film that hasn't already been said, but if you're on the fence about whether or not to watch it I would definitely recommend. Ron Perlman is really the glue that holds this movie together. He pretty much plays the straight man to a cast of characters who are mostly tripping on drugs and have little clue as to what is going on. His timing is great and his deadpan performance makes the entire plot almost believable.

To be sure, this is a period piece set in London in December 1969. The sets, costume design and soundtrack are all on point and incredibly well done. The movie really captures the look and feel of the era and place which is about as far from the seriousness of the race to the moon as you can get at the time. The movie drags a bit in parts, but never gets dull. If you have a bucket list for movies this one definitely belongs on it.",1526774400,,892,4.186046511627907
