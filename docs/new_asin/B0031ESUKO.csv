8386977,1,B0031ESUKO,"I trust the Universe but I could have spent $7.99 on much better things.  This is not at all what is presented in the description. I firmly agree with the other two reviews I've read. I bought this because another yoga teacher asked me to review it to see if it was acceptable to show at a teacher training. No, no ma'am, it is not. I've never complained to Amazon about a streaming video purchase but the title of this is so misleading that I'm submitting a complaint.",1391731200,,469,4.329545454545454
8386978,1,B0031ESUKO,The contents of this video are not worthy of being viewed and in no way represent yoga. Very misleading video.,1386979200,2,110,4.55
8386979,1,B0031ESUKO,"I went on this video hoping to hear more about the History of Yoga. The nice cover on the video box is totally misleading.
What you get is some Howard Stern wannabee that is doing a TV style show that rambles on as if he has no script and then he brings on two other people that are equally unimpressive. (A singer and a yoga teacher) First of all aside from a couple of times where they casually mention the history of yoga (60 seconds at tops), there is nothing on this tape that is about the history of yoga. The authors need to repackage this to be more honest about this program.  This gives yoga a bad name.",1378598400,3,613,4.151260504201681
8386980,1,B0031ESUKO,"I thought this product was a waste of time and money.  It is a very amateur interview by someone who knows next to nothing about what he's talking about.  The yoga teacher he ""interviewed"" was at least qualified and there was a demonstration that might be of some use to older beginners.  However there was only about thirty seconds at the end discussing the history of yoga.  To make it even worse, there were a couple of music interludes by a young woman who must be related to the producer.",1343433600,2,493,4.444444444444445
