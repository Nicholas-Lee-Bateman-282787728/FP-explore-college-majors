8496472,5,B001OPUWO4,"If you love punk/ska, you will LOVE Citizen Fish! These guys are one of the absolute best bands out there! The live footage and candid, ""behind the scenes"" action on this DVD are loads of fun to watch. This is a combination of two DVDs, the first ""Gaffer Tape"" being mostly from their 1999 US and UK tours, and the second, ""Underwater Overground"" is from tours 2007/2008. This is a band of fun loving musicians out on the road, in the studio, and beyond... A very good buy for those who love good music and good fun!",1399075200,,516,4.329896907216495
