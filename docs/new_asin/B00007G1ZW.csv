7976070,4,B00007G1ZW,"The truth about this film will be hard to swallow for the young ones. One reviewer said it shows others animals outside (and a baby elephant) waiting to get in the ark but got washed away. So I went onto YouTube to find this film. She's right. The scripture says God closes the doors of the ark. In this film noah pulled them closed him self using ropes. There were animals on wooden tree trucks or rafts floating past the ark (sad). And people on treetops about to get covered up by the water.
This DVD was in my shopping cart. I took it out.
I gave it a 4 stars because its pretty on point, but not 100% accurate.",1389139200,,615,4.133333333333334

7976072,4,B00007G1ZW,"I purchased this DVD for the Wednesday evening Children's class at my church, as we're currently studying stories in Genesis.  This is biblically accurate, the animation is classic, and the narration by James Earl Jones excellent.  The children seemed to really enjoy it and were able to put visual pictures with the story we have been discussing.",1327363200,2,347,5.0701754385964914
7976073,4,B00007G1ZW,"First off, great production values all the way around. But the thing that makes this version stand out is some of it's mildly disturbing aspects which surprised me.

Here we see that there were many more animals than would fit on the ark. We even see Noah actively pushing some out! Then we see many animals lined up outside hoping Noah will let them in. We even see a mother elephant try to comfort her baby elephant by hugging him with her trunk a la Dumbo. Then we see them, still standing in line, as water rises around them. It's kind of upsetting because we know all those animals are about to drown, even the babies!

We see this happen with people to, but that doesn't hit quite as hard as the animals.

Noah's sons don't wear shirts which isn't really disturbing, just kind of weird.

Lastly, once the animals leave the ark on Errarat...we see that the ark is full of poo! It's in piles all over the place and even dripping off the railings! We get extended shots of several locations of the ark with poo all over the place. What a strange thing to focus on!

Aside from these few bizarre items, it's a well-produced and engaging telling of the story.",1288051200,3,1160,4.401869158878505
7976074,5,B00007G1ZW,"Our family really enjoys this version of the Noah story. It does not have dialogue, but is narrated by James Earl Jones. The animation is high quality, very beautiful. It is 48 minutes long, and definitely good enough for viewing multiple times.  This was also shown on the animated series, ""Long Ago and Far Away"".",1262736000,2,315,4.7272727272727275
7976075,5,B00007G1ZW,"I just LOVE James Earl Jones---mainly thanks to Darth Vader, but that's a different matter---and the illustration is so artistic.",1222214400,,129,5.5
