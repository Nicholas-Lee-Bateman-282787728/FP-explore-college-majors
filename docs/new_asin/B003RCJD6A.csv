8403588,2,B003RCJD6A,"While not the classic of the 1944 original (Titled Murder My Sweet with Dick Powell as Philip Marlowe and Claire Trevor as the  femme fetale) I remember liking this film if only for Mitchum's performance as a world weary private eye. Perhaps because this is a British production with a British director, it has been unavailable In the US for some time. Out of print copies of the original US DVD release sell for exorbitant prices: I was not up to paying over $100 for a decent copy. Even the  British DVDs appear out of production and also sell high. Since I use an all region DVD player, I was quite receptive to locating a reasonably priced European issue.

I thought I had found  such a copy when I saw this DVD listed for the first time on Amazon, and at a decent price. The title was in French  but that must mean French sub-titles but with the original dialog-- or so I thought. The good news it is in NTSC format, so it will play on any US DVD player. The bad news is that it was issued for the French speaking Canadian market, largely in the province of Quebec.  Apparently these good people prefer their American and British movies in French only; no sub-titles, please. All the voices are overdubbed in French--I assume Quebec French. So unless you are bilingual or have a French poodle that can translate the dialog for you, avoid this issue. This was issued quite recently, in 2010. Hopefully, the distributor will reissue a DVD with the original actors speaking for the rest of the US and Canada.",1368835200,3,1510,4.492700729927007
