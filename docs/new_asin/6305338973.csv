7888333,5,6305338973,"This martial arts series, made almost 20 years ago, is still one of the most popular anime in Japan, and for good reason. The soundtrack, voice acting, and action are all top-notch. It follows the story of Kenshiro, the inheritor of the Hokuto Shinken martial art, and the savior of the post-apocalyptic world the story takes place in. Hokuto Shinken is an art that shatters the opponent from within, causing their body to explode. Needless to say, the anime is ultra-violent. All fans of anime and action should buy this, but don't buy the dubbed version.",992908800,,556,4.802083333333333
7888334,4,6305338973,"Any fan of martial arts needs this anime. Since it first aired in 1984, the artwork is showing its age, but this series is regarded as a classic, and still widely popular in Japan, even after almost 20 years. The opening sequence is completely scrapped and replaced with some Americanized garbage, all the music is changed in the dub, and the ""next episode"" previews at the end of each episode are taken out. The dubbing is good, but when compared to the original Japanese version, a lot worse. Get the subtitled version by all means.",992908800,,534,4.631578947368421
7888335,1,6305338973,"This is the popular TV-series based on the manga by Buronson (story) and Tetsuo Hara (art). The story follows the manga very, very closely. Each chapter has been turned into one episode and partly it seems as if the manga was actually used as the storyboard for the animators. The animation quality is not that good since this is, after all, a TV series from 1984. There are more quiet, even thoughtful moments and beautiful depictions of post-apokalyptic rural life than in the theatrical movie (which was released in 1986). NOTE: Everything I have written so far is based on the ORIGINAL VERSION and not on the one released by Manga Entertainment. Manga Ent. replaced the complete soundtrack (on both the dubbed AND the subtitled versions!) with material from underground ""musicians"" like 4Hero, Tek9, Sonar Circle, Seiji, Alpha Omega and DJ Stretch! - the cover of this video credits Reinforced Records for the music which is simply the record label all these artists have contracts with! In addition to that they cut the entire opening sequence and replaced it with a crude ""rock video"" that shows numerous images of exploding heads etc. probably to attract those who liked the movie only because of its over-the-top violence. The ending sequence was also altered: They replaced the original Japanese song with a newly composed, US-produced ""song"" with differt Japanese lyrics. To tell you the truth, I kicked this video into the garbage can right after viewing it. It might still be acceptable if you have never seen the original, unadulterated version but I nonetheless recommend you avoid this one at all costs!",984700800,4,1618,4.996296296296296
7888336,1,6305338973,"This anime was very violent and bizarre.  I had trouble understanding the plot, if there was one.  I was confused with the excessive amount of  violence in the fight scenes, how exactly did the bad guy jam his fingers  into other characters chests and then cause them to erupt in massive  volcanic-like fissures of blood?  Maybe it's me, but I like a little  realism in my anime.
The dialog was written so that a three year old  could follow it, but unfortunately the film is much too violent for a three  year old to view, so I guess the film's writers need to sharpen their  writing skills.
I don't understand how films like this one can make it  into the ""cult classics"" genre.  If you view the film without  bloodlust on your mind, you will be impressed at how stupid the story  actually is.  Do people really write this stuff!
Save your money, if  your looking for violence rent a live action adult oriented film instead of  this drivel.",966384000,2,942,4.479289940828402
7888337,3,6305338973,"The animation is great, the story andthe fights are awesome BUT the movie is better. There isn't as much blood as in the movie of the 80's. The background colors become dark and the blood white. In each fighting  movement there's a stop and a voice shouting the name of it, it's like an  advertisement of each punch, kick, etc.  All they tell is true about the  series, BUT the movie is better.",956966400,,394,4.3561643835616435
