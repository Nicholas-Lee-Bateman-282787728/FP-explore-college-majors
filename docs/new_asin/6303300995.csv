Suzanne Somers was looking stunning in the 90s, so if you liked beautiful women, it's worth watching. Suzanne is in almost every scene and looks stunning. It's worth a watch to see a quick scene of her in a bra and underwear. Suzanne really didn't do many scenes in a bra or bikini top, sometimes a one piece swimsuit. Her body is incredible! Suzanns is the best actress and most stunning beauty. However even Meryl Streep couldn't do much with this awful and boring script.",1430870400,,602,4.4818181818181815

Suzanne Somers climbing a mountain (only experienced rock climbers could do this!) in the summer in the New Mexican desert in a long suede fringed coat with mocassin boots is worth the good laugh that this movie will get out of you - she gets to the top of the mountain with maybe a speck of dirt on her face, makeup and clothes perfectly in tact.  Terrible acting, no chemistry between Vargas and Somers, and ridiculous storyline.  Did Somers need money at this time?  I would hae given this movie no stars, however, there's no choice for that!!!",1185667200,,592,4.663461538461538
7843084,3,6303300995,"I have just recently seen this movie on regular television and I have to say I disagree with the bad reviews this movie has received.  Could this movie been better? Yes and I will agree that at times the dialogue is bad and the acting by Mrs. Somers could of been better but the story itself is wonderful and the actor, John Vargas, who plays the Brujo is absolutely mesmerizing.  He is the bad guy but those eyes literally draws you in so that deep down you almost hope that he wins.
The story line is about a 17th century healer that turned his powers to evil and in the process his lover turns from him and runs. So for centuries he has hunted her spirit and soul and eventually finds it in the 20th century in Lee Lindsay (Somers) a modern day wife, mom and journalist who is interviewing him for the magazine she writes for.  From here the story is about him using all of his power to gain possession of her and Lee discovering this inner spirit and soul that eventually gives her the strength and power to defeat him in the end.
The ending could of been better for this is a powerful witch that is easily defeated in the end - which was not acceptable.
After seeing this movie on television though I knew that it was one that I must add to my collection.",982022400,8,1260,4.241666666666666
