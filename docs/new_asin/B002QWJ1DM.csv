Whether your a novice or a seasoned tuner, this is money well spent. Wayne talks to you in easy to understand layman's terms.
Being able to jump directly to the section you want is a huge plus also.
This is some of the best money I've spent!!!!",1256256000,,339,4.230769230769231
3969016,5,B002QWJ1DM,"This is an excellent instructional and informative video. I've built several engines over the years so i'm no novice but admittedly learned several new ideas from Wayne's tutorials. Lots of in depth explanations with a laid back style that's both refreshing and entertaining. I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who's serious about building a top shelf mild to wild engine. Nice work Wayne....looking forward to future releases. You hit a home run with this one !

3969017,5,B002QWJ1DM,"I just finished watching this DVD and it is AWESOME, great reference tool for any amature or pro needing guidance on a particular subject or a quick second opinion.

It's like having them there with you during a build or tune with their Q&A sessions and easy menu access to a topic of interest. This DVD is and will be the best investment you'll ever make!

I've known Wayne and Randy for over two years and this DVD is a testament to their passion for the preservation of muscle cars.

Can wait for the next one to be released!

GREAT JOB Wayne and Randy!!

3969018,5,B002QWJ1DM,"I just received my copy a couple days ago. The most informative
engine building video there is. A must have for the average guy trying to build there engine and understand how things work. This not only covers everything you need to know about engines but it also covers why and how. From the crank to the heads this video covers it all .

First class video !!

Very well planned and put together video !!",1255651200,,405,4.315789473684211
3969019,5,B002QWJ1DM,This was an excellent video.  It is the best $25 I ever spent on my car.  After watching this video in 5 mins. I had my car running a lot better.  I can't recommend this video enough for anyone interested in tuning their hot rods.  Joe Whitaker,1255478400,,244,4.127659574468085
3969020,5,B002QWJ1DM,"I was fortunate to actually meet Wayne Smothers and attend his engine building class in person. I wish this video had been available to us at the end of class then. I am constantly referring to my notes from class, now I can just go to the video and watch everything that I have forgotten since taking his class. There is more content in the video than when I attended class with him and I can see it any time that I want to now. I highly recommend this video to anyone wanting more than your average high school auto mechanics knowledge. Great job Wayne!

3969021,5,B002QWJ1DM,I have been building engines and working on cars for years. This really opened my eyes up to potential power gains and preventing problems. I wish I would have had this about fifteen years ago!,1254873600,,193,4.542857142857143
8378060,4,B002QWJ1DM,"As a mechanic for a hobby, I found this video helpful and the tips are practical. I would recommend this video for anyone who has mechanical knowledge that might need some practical tips and a maybe a reminder for those who knew it, but forgot it.

If it has to do with tuning engines that are older carbureted engines, then this might be what you are looking for.

I would really like to see a video like this for the newer ECU engines out there. That would be awesome!",1446336000,,470,4.269662921348314

8378063,3,B002QWJ1DM,"There was a lot of good information on this DVD.
The sound qualilty was not very good, captions were provided for this reason I'm sure, but sometimes the captions covered what was being shown.",1355097600,,192,4.676470588235294
8378064,5,B002QWJ1DM,"I have been around muscle cars,street rods and working on motors all my life and considered myself to know a little about motors in general, but Wayne Smothers is the man.

8378067,5,B002QWJ1DM,"This DVD is GREAT. Wayne tells you the ins and outs of building a SUPER PIMP motor. He is Very knowledgable and knows what he is talking about. Everything you need to know is in this video. He explains things very well and in depth.

After watching the video, I had a few questions. I was able to call Wayne and talk to him, and he was more than happy to answer my questions. You can definently tell this is not just a job, its his passion.

I would recommend this video for anybody who enjoys GOING FAST and BUILDING IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME.....

8378068,5,B002QWJ1DM,"It's obvious that lots of thought and planning went into this DVD. Wayne presents the info really well, and his knowledgeable and likable style makes you feel like you're not being ""taught"" the material. You feel like you're in a casual conversation with a buddy who has been doing this for a long time, a buddy who answers all your questions.

There's so much great material here: the info given is well-organized and presented in a logical fashion. A lot of the terms and techniques used in engine building were REALLY explained to me for the first time!

A first-class video.",1257120000,,578,4.712871287128713
