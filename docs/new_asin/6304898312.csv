7878822,4,6304898312,"I was present during the Felix Art Store scenes. That porton was actually filmed at Carter Sexton Art & Engineering Supplies in North Hollywood, California. I was a manager, and was assigned by the owner to be on set for the entire filming at the store, which took place over Super Bowl weekend 1996. Three days to be exact. I have a fondness for this film because Moira Kelly was exceptionally nice to me during filming, so much so I actually wrote producers Abra Edelman and James Dodson a note commenting on just how pleasant both Moira Kelly and Dylan Walsh were. Moira was very outgoing and usually came over and talked to me, made sure I got food when the crew ate, and dropped in after the production ended. I believe this was Dylan Walsh's first role. He was very polite but also very shy. The moment his scenes were done shooting each day he was outta there. Both have had good and respectable careers. I remain a huge Moira Kelly fan to this day because of my very pleasant experience with her during those 3 days of filming at Carter Sexton. Moira Kelly wherever you are... You rock!",1363910400,2,1094,4.475

7878826,4,6304898312,"Changing Habits is a great vehicle to show the superb talents of actress Moira Kelly.  She shows all facets of her acting ability from being mad, sad, hate and love throughout the movie.  It is an excellent movie to see  how a person can come about 180 degrees and it also gives us all hope and  faith.",963619200,7,302,4.245614035087719
