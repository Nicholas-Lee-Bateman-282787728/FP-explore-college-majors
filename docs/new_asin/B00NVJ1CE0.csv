6681096,5,B00NVJ1CE0,"Another Hanna-Barbera toon classic from my 80's childhood.  This offering is just like the others from the Warner Brothers Archives.  It's remastered and it looks excellent.  I guess this is now standard from the archive.  You can see grains at times but nothing to get you upset about it.  The Shirt Tales was an 80's cartoon that took animals that lived in a park with Mr. Dinkle (Park Ranger) solving crimes and just good ole fun PSA episodes told in story form.  Mr. Dinkle never knew that his animal little buddies were the famous Shirt Tales gang but certain law enforcment agencies knew them by reputation.  Their shirts would indicate what they were feeling.  This is a great show for children of all ages.  Innocent fun on Saturday morning cartoons.  I use to watch this show in between watching my action cartoons on Saturdays.  This is one I never forgot.  Season 1 & 2 are on 3 discs.  Can we get Galtar and the Golden Lance, The Atom Ant/Secret Squirrel Show, Fantastic 4 (1967), The Super Globetrotters, Clue Club, Jeannie, Finish The Richie Rich/Scooby-Doo Show and Scrappy Too!, Snorks and the Smurfs?  Lets not forget the Paw Paws and Fantastic Max.  I'm looking forward to seeing what WB Archives puts out next.  I want all the HB cartoons released.  Keep in mind that these are Videos on Demand, DVD-R.",1411862400,7,1321,4.698689956331878

6681107,5,B00NVJ1CE0,"I have looked EVERYWHERE for the Shirt Tales!  I am so glad that Amazon have put them out and have added them to my collection which now includes Gummi Bears and Captain Caveman :)  Essentially it is a cutesy cartoon set of 3 discs, that I feel is similar to Scooby Doo at times.  I played the dvd's for a 7 and 9 year old who also loved them, in fact they asked for them the next time they came to visit.  A piece of my childhood that I was happy to be able to share and enjoy.  This is as good a quality as you can expect considering it's now being played on a large HD TV and the kids didn't seem to mind it not being sharp.  I am so happy to own it that I can forgive that it is not the same quality as the modern day cartoons.",1455235200,,731,3.776315789473684

6681111,5,B00NVJ1CE0,"Shirt Tales is a Hanna Barbera production from the early 1980s. It has the same animators as from the 70's. The main characters are a Panda, Racoon, Monkey, Ground Hog, Tiger and Kangaroo. They mainly solve mysteries like a lot of H-B cartoons, the mysteries are easy to understand and less monsters like Scooby Doo. Their shirts flash different words throughout the show, depending on what is happening. Also, the series is based from Hallmark greeting cards from that time. The DVD's are DVD-R and 'Made On Demand', the picture is as good as normal DVD and is made and shipped just as fast. I would recommend this and other Hanna Barbera Made on Demand DVD's.",1443398400,,661,4.706896551724138

6681125,5,B00NVJ1CE0,This has always been a Hanna Barbara top favorite of mine as a child.  While I always wish the series would of done a episode that actually introduce Kip to the team instead of suddenly having her there in season 2  it is a great classic HB toon with all the elements.  Part Scooby Doo  Part Batman  the Shirt Tales are crime fighters working under the orders of the commissioner and have to sneak out of the city park past the ranger to solve the mysteries and crimes since nobody but animals seem to know their true identity. The series have two different opening sequences each of which i never tire of watching,1413936000,5,614,4.398230088495575
