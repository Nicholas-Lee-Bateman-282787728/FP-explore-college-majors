She cuts a cute figure in her cowboy ""duds"".Wild Bill Elliot does a masterful job of switching from poker swindler to evangelist of Christ's words; very suspensefull and morally uplifting.",1100476800,2,283,5.454545454545454
237471,5,6300208419,"Wonderful movie I enjoyed seeing it.
And enjoyed seeing GOD'S word work in a gambler and a women who has killed.
And using her body to seduce a man to get at what she wants.
And seeing lives changed in the end building a church is only a building.
GOD'S real church is in a persons life being changed.
For their good and for the glory of GOD would I see this again.
Yes I would and that others would take a chance and see for them selves.
Color in this movie was fine and my favorite actors and actress in it.",1446595200,,509,4.0
237472,3,6300208419,"Hellfire is a surprisingly good western with a better than average script,  a number of good performances, and excellent direction.  The film stars William ""Wild Bill""  Elliott  as a gambler whose life is saved by an aged, broken down  preacher, who takes a bullet for Elliott's character.  Elliott's character who is not a religious man, promises the dying preacher that he will fulfill the dying man's last wish to build a church.  Elliott, as the story progresses, becomes a preacher himself,  and winds up involved with a young woman (played by Marie Windsor) whose hard life has turned her into  a  robber and gunslinger with a large reward on her head.  The relationship between Elliot and Windsor is far more complicated and compelling than is found in most B Westerns or even large budget movies.  The screenplay is very good with sharp dialogue and a powerhouse ending.  William Elliott  was the star of the Red Ryder serials (with Robert Blake as his Indian sidekick Little Beaver) along with many B westerns.  He is quite good in this film keeping his character low key but effective throughout.  I would have preferred Randolph Scott in this role, but Elliott comes through with perhaps the best performance of his long career.  Marie Windsor plays the female lead and she is terrific here.  Forrest Tucker is also excellent as Elliott's close friend, a federal marshall, on Windsor's trail.  The supporting cast includes such pros as Jim Davis, Paul Fix, Grant Withers, Denver Pyle, and Trevor Bardette  who add to the quality of the picture. Veteran helmer of westerns R. G. Springsteen's  direction is very good here getting excellent performances from his cast and excellent pacing of the story.  Check this film out if you like westerns, but you will enjoy it even if you are not a fan of the genre.",1445904000,,1816,4.846905537459284

Directed by R. G. Springsteen

Our story deal with morality and revenge, with our hero Wild Bill Elliott is a gambler who is saved by H.B. Warner a preacher stopping a bullet meant for Elliott.  The heroine is Marie Windsor a loose woman on the dodge, in order to build a mission Elliott must capture Windsor for the reward.  Marshal Forrest Tucker who is bent on killing Windsor for past actions.  Elliott turned minster sees his way clear to redeem both Windsor and Tucker, but will this happen before the final reel -- great supporting cast of Jim Davis, Denver Pyle, Harry Woods, Grant Withers, Paul Fix and H.B. Warner.

This film was in tribute to the classic ""Hell's Hinges"", featuring William S. Hart, who was Elliott's favorite silent film Western Star ... outstanding screenplay and great direction by R.G. Springsteen ---- they just don't make 'em like this anymore and Republic Pictures was one of the leaders of exciting B-Westerns and Serials.

7805624,3,6300208419,"The late great Marie Windsor cited HELLFIRE among her three favorite performances, alongside THE KILLING and NARROW MARGIN (to those add NO MAN'S WOMAN and SWAMP WOMEN). Second-billed, she dominates this Republic B-Western solidly directed by Robert G. Springsteen and produced by its scenarists Dorrell and Stuart McGowan. Photographed by Jack Marta in glorious but unfaithful Trucolor, the film has a surreal, trancelike feel because of the unstable Trucolor wobble, Windsor's evasive genderbending and especially in the pages of dialogue Windsor swaps, in measured deadpan monotone, with her measured deadpan lead Bill Elliott (a sinful cardsharp turned sky pilot, evangelized by the magisterially godlike H.B. Warner). HELLFIRE opens with a fine hellfiery montage of Western sinful behaviors, then morphs into a mostly-indoors morality play with some few exterior cutaways shot by Yakima Canutt at Chatsworth and Sedona.

Windsor appears butch and sullen, en travesti in shotgun chaps fashioned by Adele Palmer, in the eerier first half, then is transformed in calico and satin frocks and predictably goes undercover as a cheesecake hotel chanteuse. Windsor's leggy production numbers, dubbed by Virginia Rees, are ""Shoo fly, don't bother me"" and the ironic ""Bringing in the sheaves."" The final showdown choreographs butch Windsor, Elliott and Forrest Tucker in a cellblock gunplay triangle, and Windsor is transfigured in huge closeups over her heartfelt reading (Windsor trained with Maria Ouspenskaya) of Psalm XXIII, beautifully staged by Springsteen. After Tucker and Warner, the castlist authentically ropes in Jim Davis, Paul Fix, Grant Withers, Denver Pyle and uncredited Hank Worden.

HELLFIRE is not as nuttily offbeat as Republic's unofficial 1953-54 sequels WOMAN THEY ALMOST LYNCHED and JOHNNY GUITAR, but in its 1949 context this film hints at the more daring feminist themes and unforced genderbending those later films elaborated. Many viewers concur that Windsor presents even more fetchingly in cowboy drag (a stylistic issue briefly and comically addressed in her first townie encounter) than in her more stereotypical Wyoming-showgirl spangles and bustiers. Significantly, Windsor's conversion and transfiguration occur after her reversion to practical, nontraditional fashion modes (darted workshirt, polo trousers and a contrasting slinky hairdo).",1502928000,,2373,5.816091954022989
