8237273,4,B00106MGWI,This is an excelent series that has aired on the military channel.  It does a very good job of recreating the historical events in dramitic format with just enough commentarty to fill in the fast forwards that go with telling a story in a one hour format.  It is a shame that it is not available to the American market.,1225152000,7,319,4.3
