8020812,3,B00022LIEI,"Specifically regarding volume 1 (of 8) from Alpha Video. This single disc contains four episodes but they are not the first four episodes from the 1952-54 television series and Steve Kaplan, Alpha's owner, does not provide original episode titles except for the third episode which has an on-screen title card. The first episode (Nosed Out, season 1, episode 6) has the best picture quality and the other three are soft, slightly overexposed/thin contrast, and missing frames.

Episode 2 is ""The Frightened Bride"" (season 1, eps. 22); episode 3 is ""Target"" (season 2, eps. 2); and episode 4 is ""The Third Eye"" (season 1, eps. 18). The Frightened Bride has a poorly written script from M. Coates Webster with major flaws.

This is the first of eight volumes (discs) released by Alpha which are also available as an eight volume collection. It is the best price deal.",1217376000,11,865,4.917808219178082
8020813,3,B00022LIEI,"This'll date me: I used to watch Pam and Jerry North on black and white tv as a kid.  So this is a bit of a nostalgia trip for me, and I may rate them higher than I should.  But in my opinion, they definately stack up well against the likes of ""Monk"" (which I also mostly enjoy).  The humor is a little corny.  Pam is a Gracie Allen type ""screwy dame"", but the mysteries are ok, and you enjoy spending time with the people.  It's hard to say better than that about any entertainment!",1167955200,5,483,4.042105263157895
8020814,4,B00022LIEI,"More over Jonathan and Jennifer.  The 1950's TV equivalent of ""Hart to Hart"" was the offbeat murder-mystery series MR. & MRS. NORTH.  When it became apparent that Richard Denning wasn't going to be automatically re-cast opposite Lucille Ball in ""I Love Lucy"" (the show inspired by the radio serial ""My Favourite Husband"" in which he had starred with Ball), Denning took the role of Jerry North, a publisher who also dabbles in sleuthing with his lovely wife Pamela (Barbara Britton).

MR. & MRS. NORTH was based on a series of novellas written by Richard Lockridge; the characters were later featured in a long-running radio serial, which started out in 1946 and ended up airing concurrently with the TV series (which debuted in 1952).  The TV series of MR. & MRS. NORTH, sponsored by Revlon Cosmetics, played on CBS from 1952-53, and was later picked up by NBC for additional episodes in 1954.

Episodes:

""Nosed Out"" - The Norths spend a day at the racetrack but they didn't bet on finding the bludgeoned body of a jockey in the trunk of their car.

""The Frightened Bride"" - A pleasant trip to Aunt Clara's deserted country house turns into a nightmare of unexplained screams, a closet full of human skulls and a mysterious old codger armed with a shotgun.

""Target"" - Jerry North becomes the target for an unknown assassin. Someone tries to push him off a train platform and he narrowly misses getting shot while relaxing on the beach with Pam. Just who is gunning for him - and why?  This episode also includes original Revlon sponsorship bumps with Britton, Denning, and Julia Meade.

""The Third Eye"" - Pam and Jerry are treated to a private fashion show that turns deadly when a pretty runway model is stabbed with a pair of sewing scissors.",1124668800,6,1747,4.735973597359736
