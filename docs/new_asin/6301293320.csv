324622,3,6301293320,"Based upon a story by William Mercer and Annabel Ross, this flick is a bit overwrought, perhaps - but quite entertaining nevertheless.  Russell is fine as a frustrated stage star who kills her producer because he threatened to prevent her from marrying and staging her own production of HEDDA GABLER.  Circumstances provide Roz with an airtight alibi and she seems to get away with murder...The denouement occurs as a result of Russell's involvement with her character-in-the-play-within-a-movie performance of the famed Ibsen play.  This was the first independent production for the husband-and-wife team of Russell and producer Frederick Brisson.",1030406400,6,648,5.591836734693878

7810889,4,6301293320,"I enjoyed seeing this again after many years.  enjoyed the drama, the sometimes hammy acting, but most, the honesty of the performance by Claire trevor who (because of too many female stars at the studio) got too few parts in films she could sink her teeth into. yes, she got an Oscar for key largo. not enough.",1509494400,,311,4.456140350877193

7810892,5,6301293320,"I have watched the old VHS tape of this movie for years.  It is fascinating to watch this wonderful actress - Rosalind Russell - perform a
rather unusual role for her.  She had always been known mainly as a comedian, and now, suddenly, she appears as a stern, vulnerable,
actress - in a serious role.  I wish this movie were more widely known, as Rosalind Russell was a great gifted and versital  actress.
Compare, if you will, this dramatic role in 1948 to her magnificent portrayal  of Auntie Mame in 1958.  Ten years later, she shone as THE
definitive Auntie Mame - Patrick Dennis dedicated the sequal book to her.  What else can be said.  Love this movie.  It is well worth
the time.  You will be hooked.",1462752000,2,708,4.4609375

7810897,3,6301293320,"For me the fascination is watching this film as a precursor to ALL ABOUT EVE.  Dan Tobin in George Sanders' role, Leo Genn even physically resembling Gary Merrill a bit, etc.  Leon Ames never looked better (also with physical hints of Merrill but with Hugh Marlowe's rakish coif).  Roz didn't seem right for the part at first, but she handles it well as the plot continues to parboil.  But it's also fun to pick out other familiar faces in the cast, including an Apple Annie newsie who'd all but stolen BORN TO KILL from Claire Trevor (fine and wrought here as always) the previous year.",1154131200,2,587,4.561904761904762
