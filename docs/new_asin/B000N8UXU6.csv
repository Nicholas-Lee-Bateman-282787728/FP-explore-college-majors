8175683,5,B000N8UXU6,I loved Sean in this role.  He did a wonderful job of building his character.  Wonderful story line of different character lives become intertwined.,1369785600,,148,5.125
8175684,5,B000N8UXU6,"Its about losing people you love and dealing with that. It is slow and quiet and emotional. I really love it.
I got it because it is SPF and he is adorable in it <3  I think its one of his better movies.",1366934400,,203,3.7209302325581395
8175685,4,B000N8UXU6,"I enjoyed this movie. Not the greatest movie in the world but worth a look. Sean Patrick Flanery is very good as Walter a man who can not forgive himself for his sisters death. It does not run as smoothly as I would have liked. Flash-backs and memories keep the movie jumping around a bit too much for my taste. That said, it was still an enjoyable movie.",1313020800,2,355,4.235294117647059
8175686,2,B000N8UXU6,"For the caliber of actors (Sean Patrick Flannery, Melina Kanakaredes, JoBeth Williams), this was highly disappointing.  Story is exceedingly slow to develop and scenes leave you hanging without resolution.  The characters are connected but the ending leaves a lot to be desired (quite literally) as I wanted the story to continue and bring the life-stories to closure.  Had so much potential but was disappointingly boring.",1184112000,5,423,5.476923076923077
