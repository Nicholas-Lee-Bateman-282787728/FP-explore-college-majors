7909560,5,B00000I4OR,"What a shame it is that this movie has not been released on dvd. ""Scarred"" is an excellent movie, and deserves a remastered/restored release. Instead it seems to have been forgotten. This low budget, independent film tells a fascinating story about a single teen mother who resorts to prostitution to support herself and her bi-racial baby.  ""Scarred"" is filmed on the famed Hollywood Boulevard, and the look is wonderfully grimy and atmospheric. Similar to another movie that came out around that time, ""Angel,"" which dealt with the same subject matter, but in a much lighter way. ""Scarred"" holds nothing back, and does have a similar feel to it as such films like ""Taxi Driver."" Not to mention it features an incredible 80's soundtrack, mostly punk and new wave bands, and the music works perfectly with the imagery. This would look amazing in it's original widescreen picture ratio. I do hope some dvd label that specializes in cult films, will give new life to this fine movie, so a new generation can discover this forgotten gem..",1486598400,,1035,4.914285714285715
7909561,4,B00000I4OR,"Poor A/V quality. Besides the amateurish acting and directing, this movie actual has a pretty good script. Grimey flick that I wish would added another 10 minutes worth of dialogue to showcase more of the game between pimps and hoes. But if you wish to learn more about their POV, get you coat pulled.",1247616000,,301,4.592592592592593
7909562,1,B00000I4OR,"i clicked on the best available copy of the DVD, but then it suggested i go to another page ""to get the best/lowest shipping charges"", i did that but when i came back to the main page it said my cart was empty.  so i went back and repeated the process without going to the 'best shipping cost' diversion. then amazon said you have purchased the DVD.  there was no final look at the bill to OK it.  a week later TWO DVDs came--2 of the same movie.  before i even opened the first package i could hear the disc rattling around in it's package.  and when i did open it and it fell out because it hadn't been securely attached to that center spoke. i saw it was all scratched up from rubbing against that center post.  so i opened the second package and played that one.  it worked fine until chapter 7 when it reverted to the beginning.  after several attempts to get past chapter 7 i gave up.  so i paid for 2 DVDs instead of one and neither worked. i am not intersted in any more copies, thank you, i got the jist of the film (i knew the lead actress back, jennifer mayo, in the 80's and since i am writing my bio i wanted to see her again.  i saw her; mission accomplished, however i would appreciate a refund for one of them since your purchasing system is fraught with confusion. then perhaps i would use amazon again.  but why don't you offer the customer a look at the bill before we agree it's correct.",1238198400,,1407,4.154981549815498
7909563,5,B00000I4OR,"A revealing portrait of life in the underbelly of America with a gripping, hard edge look at Hollywood's meanest streets. It chronicles the trials and tribulations of a teenage mom who turns to prostitution to support her baby. Beautifully shot by Michael Miner (who co-wrote Robocop), it has an explosive noir street look that reminds one of Taxi Driver and Midnight Cowboy. Jennifer Mayo delivers a remarkably natural performance, and Jackie Berryman is quite endearing as supporting lead. The story spirals through a strange, lurid demi-monde of pimps and degenerates, both frightful and hilarious, but what prevails is the stubborn core of truth in Rose-Marie Turko's writing and directing. An impressive first feature with lots of pizzazz and invention. The barber shop pimp scene is a must see. Repo Man's Alex Cox served as assistant director and has a couple cameos. The film features a driving, at times excellent rock score, including the Plugz who scored much of Repo Man. A classic piece of Hollywood Boulevard history.",1197676800,2,1031,5.179640718562874
