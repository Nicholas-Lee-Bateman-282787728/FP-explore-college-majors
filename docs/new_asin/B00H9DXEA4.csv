8631155,5,B00H9DXEA4,"Yang Choon-dong (Kim Kang-woo) is a police detective in Seoul known for a weak record of arrests. When a little girl goes missing and Yang is the only one who thinks it's a possible kidnapping (instead of the girl just running off), he talks his way into being the lead investigator on the case.  When the little girl is found dead, Yang's reputation is further damaged - a situation made worse when he realizes the crime scene's been depicted in an alley wall mural, done by a graffiti artist way before the girl had been found, but no one on the force will believe him.  Yang sets out to find the graffiti artist, and discovers a young man named Jun (Kim Bum) with the gift of ""psychometry"" - the ability to see person's past just by touching their hands.  But as another little girl goes missing, a disgraced Yang finds himself also fighting to save the reclusive Jun - who the police now think is the killer - as the two race against time to find a child killer in one of the best, most emotionally engaging thrillers (films, period) I've seen in some time.",1423267200,,1061,4.430769230769231
