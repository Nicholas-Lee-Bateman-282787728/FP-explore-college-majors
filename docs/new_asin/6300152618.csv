212732,3,6300152618,"Ok. This forgotten Christmas special features the voices of Tommy Smothers and Barbara Feldon as two bears in a mythical bear world, and it's Tommy's character who longs to find out about this so-called ""Christmas"" that he heard about once. The problem is all bears fall into hibernation in this bear world, and can never really find out what this strange ""Christmas"" is.

Not a bad seasonal special from the early seventies that deserves to find additional life on DVD. Especially since it's no longer telecast regularly, and hasn't shown up on the cable channels recently.

It may not be in the same league as the Grinch or Charlie Brown, but it definitely deserves to get a second chance.

Nice. Warm. Fuzzy.

Sincerely,

JThree

212733,4,6300152618,I remember seeing this as a child (I'm 33 now) and thought perhaps it would be on DVD.  I see that it is only avl used through Amazon.  I know it's not Amazon's fault and used is better than it not being avl at all....  I remember this being a very sweet and gentle story of a bear trying to avoid sleeping through Christmas as he makes his way to the city.  Great memory!

212908,5,6300152618,"This is a real treat.  I remember reading this book to my kids years ago and they and I still remember it.  The movie is a careful, loving adaptation of the book and the voice-overs are superb.  The producers couldn't have picked better actors and actresses to portray Ted Edward Bear, his girlfriend and his boss.  Poor Ted.  He looked so hard for Christmas, tried so hard to stay awake that you pull for him all the way.  This is a Christmas movie classic and is right up there with the best of them: Frosty the Snowman, Rudolf the Red Nosed Reindeer, Miracle and 34th Street (OK, this isn't animation, but it's a classic none-the-less) and, of course, ""It's a Wonderful Life.""

213027,5,6300152618,"No other TV special in history gives the best interpretation of what Christmas is all about, than this 1973 Christmas holiday offering ""The Bear Who Slept Through Christmas.""  You'll know what I mean if you get a lump in your throat as you watch, or if you end up bawling your head off at the end. as may be the case with some.

Theodore Edward Bear (Ted E. Bear, get it?) is about to go into hibernation for the winter with his fellow bears, including his ladyfriend, Pattie Bear (voiced by Barbara Feldon).  But for years Ted has heard about something called Christmas, which in the past, he's attempted to find but always falls asleep.  Not this year.  Ted is determined once and for all to find out what Christmas exactly is, and nothing or no one is going to stop him.

I watched this TV Christmas special the night it premiered on NBC forty years ago this month, and I have never forgotten it.  As a child you can't appreciate the true message behind it like you can as an adult.  Now that I am a half century older, and I've seen Charlie Brown and the gang a thousand times, I see the real beauty behind Ted E. Bear's frantic quest to find out what this thing called Christmas is all about.

Like so many, I too am disappointed that no one has seen fit to release this classic on DVD.  However, I am thankful to Amazon for offering this as a streaming video, which I saw earlier this evening.  By the way, there is another Christmas program that follows if you stick around to watch it.  I don't know what exactly it is, but it appears to be some kind of pilot for Ted E. Bear and his further adventures, which perhaps the producers were hoping to land more deals for.  It's about 25 minutes in length, and features drawings and narration to two additional stories involving Thanksgiving and ""How Christmas Came to Monster Mountain,"" the latter which eventually was turned into a 1983 TV special.

It's nice to know I am not the only one who holds Ted E. Bear and his gang close to their heart.  Merry Christmas!",1387670400,,2019,4.389784946236559

213029,2,6300152618,"Santa Claus meets the bear and explains that the meaning of Christmas lies inside the bear's heart; it's all about what he feels. This sent a confusing message to my kidsso whatever they feel about Christmas gives it meaning and it's ""all about me"" and nobody else?

At least more recent films at turn Christmas into merely a moral holiday say that Christmas is about how you make other people feel. That's a little better than the message of this video, though it still falls short of stating what the true meaning of Christmas is.",1387584000,2,532,4.6

213062,3,6300152618,"While the idea is sweet, I thought the main bear character's voice and behavior was annoying. As an adult, it was really hard to like him. My 4 year old lost interest about halfway through, maybe because the cartoon drawings are rather old fashioned and there is not much action (not a bad thing per se, in my opinion).

The story is really cute, and it's a quick watch.",1356480000,,205,3.7674418604651163

213100,5,6300152618,"The dvd,""The Bear Who Slept Through Christmas,"" is an excellent movie.  The picture and sound was amazing it made me feel like I was Ted E. Bear and that I wanted to know about Christmas and what I was missing out on.  This is an excellent movie for the entire family.  It helps to really get the true meaning of Christmas.

Thanks for a wonderful family movie.",1349308800,3,361,4.343283582089552
213101,5,6300152618,"This has been a favorite holiday movie for years.  The other VHS tape we had of it finally wore out; so glad to find another one.  Really enjoyed watching it again; it brought back great memories of when we watched it with our children when they were small.  I wish they would put it on DVD since everything is going that way.  Thanks so much.  Sincerely, RL",1327190400,,358,4.2835820895522385
213102,1,6300152618,"Groovy! Psychedelic! Post-modern! And a total consumeristic ploy to teach the children of the early 1970s that Christmas is when you get stuff.

I kept waiting for a Linus VanPelt moment, where Ted E. Bear would be taught about the birth of the Messiah and his promise of redemption. Instead he meets a hippie Santa Claus who tells him that the meaning of Christmas ""comes from inside you!""

Why Ted E. Bear, didn't you know that you can be your own personal Jesus. Can you dig it, Daddio?

Add to this the astrology-spouting, all-knowing voice of reason secretary at the Organic Honey Co, and you've got a perfect opportunity to teach your kids about new age theology while fueling consumerism and greed EVERY holiday season.

Maybe it's a good thing this stinker is so hard to find in production.",1292803200,9,798,4.719424460431655
213103,4,6300152618,This is one of my favorite cartoon Christmas story that I have not seen in many years. It's a story of a bear trying to find Christmas by not hibernating like the other bears. Very good movie for the children,1292716800,2,208,4.225
213104,5,6300152618,Had searched for this for years after seeing it on television in 1999. Finally found it in 2009 and purchased it for my daughter and myself.,1289865600,,140,4.423076923076923

I always watched it with my own Ted E.  I got the stuffed version of the bear from the show when I was one, I still have him.  He's been my favorite toy my entire life.  He's a bit worn in places.  I think my mom said he was the K-Mart bear of the time.  It would be great to find another of him, in better condition to give my little boy.  Combine that with the DVD of the show, it would be wonderful!",1199059200,3,552,3.6810344827586206

We are all just hitting our 30's and we're starting to miss the things we grew up with and cherished in our younger years - and as some of us are starting our own families, these are things we want to share with our children. I would rather have my kids watching this than most of the new junk they put out there nowadays. When is someone going to get off their butt and put this on DVD?! If Family Home Entertainment would combine this with a few other of their heartfelt Christmas classics, like The Teddy Bears' Christmas (1992) and The Velveteen Rabbit (1985), they would have a much wanted product.",1196208000,9,647,4.311475409836065

7803703,5,6300152618,"Literally just scrolling through Prime and found this neat little gem of a Christmas special. VERY 70s, in music style and animation, as well as some of the gender roles and the very anti-corporate sentiment, but on the whole that just adds to the charm. I didn't grow up with this, but if I had, I'd watch it every year  I might do that now. Sweet voice acting over a script with more than a handful of clever lines, it's a simple joy around the holiday season.

Take note: it's only 25 minutes long. The second half is some strange live-action with illustrations story that, while also somewhat charming, isn't as good as the first short.",1513728000,,640,4.508620689655173
