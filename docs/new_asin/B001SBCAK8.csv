8339636,5,B001SBCAK8,"This a clever, original, funny and thoughtful film.  It's all about how ""familiarity breeds contempt"" and that ""the grass is always greener.""  Anyone who has been married for a while will understand.  In the film a man who is bored with his wife ... falls in love with another woman who looks like his wife!  The other woman behaves nothing like the man's wife but she seems different and enticing to him.  The problem gets worse when it seems the ""other woman"" may in fact be his wife living another life without his knowing.  It's great fun to watch him try to prove the truth of the matter and interesting how much he lusts after this new person while ignoring his wife who could almost be her twin.",1493424000,,702,4.4453125
