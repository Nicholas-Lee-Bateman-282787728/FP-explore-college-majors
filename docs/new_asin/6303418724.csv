638831,5,6303418724,"Since childhood, I've always felt that the most aesthetically beautiful people that have ever walked the earth are the original inhabitants of the Western Hemisphere, so this series, so wonderfully photographed and researched, is one I appreciate. It's a superb overview of a history not to be missed.

Tape # 1: ""The Ancestors."" Explores the creation stories of several tribes and continues with the early inhabitants, from the Anasazi of the Southwest to the glory of the Mayan cities.

Tape # 2: ""Mexico."" Starts in 650 A.D. and continues with ""The Rise of the Aztecs,"" ""The Invasion,"" ""The Fall."" This is the most fascinating and my favorite of the series. The complex history is captivating, and heartbreaking as the bloodthirsty horror of Cortez is told, and the commentary by Nahuatl anthropologist Eustaquio Celestiano is enlightening.

Tape # 3: ""The Clash of Cultures."" Columbus' landing on Hispaniola and the conflict that ensues, the ""Gulf Coast of Florida"" and de Soto's marauding army.

Tape # 4: ""Invasion of the Coast."" The Inuit vs. the English, the East coast peoples vs. the English.

Tape # 5: ""Cauldron of War."" Trading with the white man and how commercial hunting changed the face of the Indian Nations. The Iriquois: The leader known as ""The Great Peacemaker"" and his ""Great Laws"" which created the first democracy in America.

Tape # 6: ""Removal."" War and exile in the East. The story of Tecumseh and his heroic challenge. The 1830 ""Indian Removal Act"" and the journey West.

Tape # 7: ""Roads Across the Plains."" California. The building of the missions and the gold rush. What happened in these events will be new information to a lot of people. Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse: ""Standing Against the Tide.""

Tape # 8: The wise and great Chief Joseph. The Apaches. The Reservations. The ""Boarding Schools"" where children were stripped of their identities. It ends with present day Native Americans speaking about perspectives today. As Mario Gonzalez, an Ogala Sioux says, ""Destiny is not a matter of fate, it's a matter of choice.""

Jack Leustig's incredible work is hosted by Kevin Costner and narrated by Gregory Harrison. The excerpts of written documents are superbly spoken by such actors as Wes Studi, Edward James Olmos, and Patrick Stewart. The score by Peter Buffet is also excellent. These tapes are also available singly, and are 49 minutes long apiece.",974246400,302,2388,5.01010101010101

638897,2,6303418724,"This is merely a chronicle of SOME Native Peoples' encounters with white European Military leaders fashioned 'explorers'--though the series doesn't really explain in any significant detail the nature of visits. It's also peculiar that vast and significant historical events were completely omitted, namely that of present-day Cuba, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico...all having a SIGNIFICANT influence on events recounted in Mexico.  The Bahamas and other Caribbean nations, Alaska and the city incredibly vast Inuit and other Native Peoples are relegated to a ""they were never really conquered"" status before moving on...if not completely omitted.

To say this series has no value or merit would be untrue. However, I would strongly encourage all to view this entire series for free in the Interwebs. You'll find the whole thing there.  I'd also recommended completely skipping Costner's speaking parts as they ad nothing to the work.",1486771200,,927,5.514084507042254

The Iroquois Confederation had a system of government on which the US Constitution is based.  The Indian nations fought alongside of the colonists against the British.  The Lenape tribe [Delaware Indians] fielded a regiment in the Continental Army.  Their chief was one of Washington's colonels.  You will change your view about Columbus.  After the Nations helped to create the USA, the new American government stole their lands and moved them from the east coast to Oklahoma by force.

To realize that if it wasn't for the First Nations, the Pilgrims never would have survived that first winter at Jamestown. So many ""treaties"" between the Native Americans and the ""wasitchu"" (whites) were broken almost as soon as they were signed; it is mind-boggling to think how different this Nation would be if the English had held up their end of the bargain (or bargains). We need to come to a less prejudicial state when, after watching this documentary, what the Native Peoples have been through and what their still dealing with even today.

The Native blood mixed with the rest of my ancestry curdled at the atrocities recanted here. My White ancestors met my Menomonee ancestors and tears poured from my heart, for this is surely the saddest story ever told on this earth.

Every schoolchild in America should see this. The lesson offered by 500 Nations is not learned to this day and it must be learned if this world ever hopes to achieve some form of peace.

I hope you will all buy this for your children and grandchildren. We cannot fix the past, but we can fight the future.",1345593600,4,894,4.241176470588235
639366,5,6303418724,"Always wanted to have my own copy of this great series. Viewing it again is fascinating, challenging and emotional. The set is inclusive of a cd with archival and source based information. The plight of the last plains Indians who struggled to retain their rightful heritage - their tribal land - reminds us that money, profits and greed are powerful agents in the destruction of histories and societies. The Indian nations fought and fell as victims of a massive theft of their identity, culture and the places they owned by right of birth and centuries of habitation. The series covers first contact for many American Indian nations and examines their various tribal cultures and built environments. What dignified and poetic statements many tribal leaders made as their dwindling numbers forced them to bargain for the rights of their people. The ""civilizing"" white soldiers, settlers and governments embarked on a process of extermination by massacre, lies and re-location and disease; sure makes you wonder who the ""savages"" were. Well worth watching.

639367,5,6303418724,"These films tell us what actually happened as our country (and others) were 'settled', not what politicians made up.  A real eye opener, it's very sad what we did to these people.",1328918400,,179,4.59375
639368,2,6303418724,"I agree with the stated intent of this series. We (speaking of Americans in general) need to know more about our history. Years ago I realized there was a big hole in what I knew about indian history. I had a vague image of the first thanksgiving, knew that the U.S. calvary chased indians across the west, and that was about it. I tried to fix that but I couldn't find any straightforward texts at the college I was going to. I found enough to come to the conclusion that ""people were being people"" and left it at that. Lately I've been dissatisfied with that and started researching again, which is why I've been watching these videos.

The videos are well presented, have a lot information, and do a good job of distinguishing between different indian tribes (one of my pet peeves is we tend to talk of ""Indians"" and ""Europeans"" as if they were two homogenous groups - every contact was different because the groups of people involved were very different). Unfortunately they portray Indians in general as innocent victims living in practically utopian societies while the Europeans were monsters. European atrocities are given in gory detail, without proper context, while indian atrocities are only mentioned in passing, if at all. Some examples: the Mayan civilization is described with admiration without mentioning their human sacrifice practices. It says (more or less in passing) that the Aztecs performed human sacrifice on special occasions but doesn't go on to say that was at least eighteen times a year, in several cities, sometimes thousands of people at a time (oh, and when several hundred Spaniards attack with over 75,000 natives, that's not a Spanish invasion, that's an uprising of an oppressed people). To be fair, it did describe the first recorded Aztec human sacrifice. It describes the Great Swamp Massacre of the Narraganset in detail and portrays King Phillip in the best light possible without ever mentioning any of the atrocities committed by his forces or discussing the traditions of torturing prisoners that the tribes in that area had.

It would also help if histories made clear the devastating effect of disease on Indians. When the pilgrims established Plymouth there were an estimated 5,000 Wampanoag (and that was after they'd already had a smallpox epidemic). By the time of King Phillip's war there was only 1,000. That's without any major war (the pilgrims got on well with the Wampanoag, it was the puritans that came after that soured relations).

I don't think history is served by whitewashing either side or any group. Nor is it served by sitting in harsh judgment of situations or people we don't really know or understand. I'm still looking for a straightforward, general history of the time period that tries to be objective and fair to all sides.

BUT what I was HOPING FOR was a deep journey into different Native American tribes, cultures, diets, farming and/or hunting and gathering practices, social structures, language groups, religious beliefs, etc. There is SOME of that here, and a bit more in certain episodes than in others, but usually it is only touched upon very briefly in order to set up the endless stories of how they were trampled on by various groups of Europeans.

639426,5,6303418724,"Great documentary. This really fills a gap in U.S. history. It tells the story of American history from the perspective of Native Americans. The documentary is well-done. It makes good use of contemporaneous paintings of Native Americans, as well as footage from the sites involved. This makes the film visually more interesting than most historical documentaries, which typically just focus on a picture or historian's commentary.

Predictably, the series does gloss over some of the less pleasant facts from Native American history, such as human sacrifices in the Aztec Empire. However, given the fact that U.S. history has traditionally ignored Native American history, and given our ancestors' crimes against Native Americans, this can be overlooked.

A more serious problem is that the documentary does not provide much background on commentators. The series often interviews anthropologists or Native American activists without mentioning who they are, which institution they are associated with, etc. It would have been easy to include a subtitle under the person's name stating his institution. It may seem small, but would have made the series a bit more authoritative.

I also recommend Charles Mann's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1491-New-Revelations-of-the-Americas-Before-Columbus/dp/1400032059/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus</a>, which provides a fresh look at Native American history before Columbus.

I most certainly agree that more ""anthropological""-type media should be made to understand and appreciate so many cultures; for they are interesting at the very least.

Reviewers who give this production low stars don't understand the impetus of this DVD collection.  Costner sponsored this collection but he did not speak in every episode in every scene.  As he should not, since he's not Native American.  (He's a German-Irish American born in California)

None of the DVDs are very thorough, I grant that.  But for the layman this collection of four DVDs is a great start to become familiar with the Natives of North America.  This covers big events of all the tribes, from eastern clans to Alaskan tribes to the tribes of Mexico and the Southwest.

The graphics are great and the photography at times breath-taking.  Most of the narratives are from real Native Americans who tell their side of the story, using archival photography when necessary.

My one complaint is that for the price there should be at least one more DVD with two more hours of documentaries describing in more detail some of the lesser-known events of the Native history.  That's why I give this four instead of five stars.  HOWEVER what is presented here is well worth the time to sit through and absorb.

Anyone who feels this is a biased documentary should just buy a collection of US Military documentaries where the ""heraldy and heroism"" of the frontier soldiers are glorified.  I've yet to see one US military history documentary that portrays the US soldiers as fumbling, racist exterminators. But who am I to judge?  I wasn't around in the mid 19th century.

How did they know so much to be able reconstruct their towns with computer graphics.  It made me wonder if I was being fed bologne or not.
  I was questioning myself through out the whole thing.  How did they know so much and how did they know exactly what happened and what things looked like?  How do they know so much??  I mean this was hundreds of years before the white man came. I think the documentary was very good and well worth the watch.  I just could not get over the first part,  how did they know so much about indians ancient history and how they lived and what their ancient towns looked like. It just seemed a little overly speculative is all.

  And the next big question is how could this be a complete documentary about the American Indians without talking about the destruction of the Inca Empire of Peru. And talking more about the Indian tribes in South America??",1168732800,2,1055,4.455497382198953

Truly, I was naive about so many aspects and networks of information that segued seemlessly into one another. The more I viewed the more I continued to ask myself and shake my head...what are we (White people)about to do next.

There are so many jewels of information in this that I will have to watch it many more times to gain further insight.

Yes, it is worth your time to purchase this and become a discoverer of untold history,...at least in the concept of American History as we have been shared with through our classrooms and our TV and movies.

There is one last thing that, while ,not the experience of the pain, is most readily the cause for such. Observing the Spaniards and English expeditionary forces who came to the new lands with some supposed idea of promoting Jesus I was appalled, aghast...near tears.

They found a sweet and loving people who, without ever hearing of God's Son were far more emulating of His nature and ways than they ever showed in their dealings with Native Americans.  In the name of Christianity they butchered God, the land, and those Native Americans who were here long before we were.

This documentary not only informed me but also showed me what the conquistadors and Indians looked like back then and proved that mounds signify the thousands of innocent Indians that have been slaughtered, and killed! Through this documentary I learned about many different tribes Indian Nations. One of the main points that I learned though this tape that really kicked-off this major dilemma was when Columbus was given a golden tiara. He believed it was a crown and viewed this gift from the Indians as a symbol of authority. This began the Spanish War with the Indians. I would recommend this book to a friend.

I've learnt a great deal that I didn't know from watching and listening to the commentary. My only criticism (and it's only a small one) is that I heard little mention of some of the more recent tribes including the Comanches, and I always thought that they would have featured rather prominently, however that's only my own opinion.

1) Advertised as ""Kevin Costner explores America's Indian Heritage"", it only has very brief comments from him (around a minute or 2 at best per episode). The actual commentary is done by a somewhat monotone lifeless droning voice, and is nothing like the emotion that should, and I expect would have been put into it by Costner. The advetising is just totally misleading.

2) The first few episodes show text dating the eras being covered starting around 800AD or later, but in the actual commentary, there are statements like ""around the time of"" and ""long before"" Christ. These comments are just thrown into the narrative oout of the blue, make no sense whatsoever, and give one a sense of total confusion when trying to follow the cronology of the things being shown and discussed.

The content on this subject may be some of the best available on DVD, but my experience with it so far, will probably stop me from even finishing it.",1119398400,23,1079,4.668421052631579
639511,3,6303418724,"Over all a solid series (Though I could do without the Costner introductions which seem crow-barred in, and do little to advance your information).

It's well researched but not balanced, and not accurately advertised. This series is not about Native Americans, but about Native Americans in contact with Europeans and Americans. The Europeans are characterized as almost entirely evil and exploitative and the Natives as victims more often than not. This may have something to do with Jack Leustig and Kevin Costner's political leanings which Costner hints at in his introductions, and an overly sympathetic view of the Native American's conquest.

The first thousands of years before European contact take up about half an hour and centers mostly on Central American cultures. The rest of the whole 6 hours is a catalog of the destruction of nation after nation, from 1492 to 1890. Not to say I didn't learn something. But if you want to learn about Native American societies, traditions, histories and are interested in their daily lives and beliefs, archaeological and anthropological information...this is not the series for you.

While this may be the ""most comprehensive effort of it's kind""...it's definitely not what the box promises....and I wish they had taken a little more time and and done a bit more justice to the 500 nations by telling more of the whole story. This is the soap opera version of their history, and after all their cultures have seen and have done and been done to, they deserve better than to be patronized as well.",1116720000,66,1548,5.01556420233463

As a 1/8th Shawnee, I especially liked the section on Tecumseh, especially that his name is pronounced correctly.  My only criticism would be that Tecumseh's remarkable prophecies, such as predicting a massive earthquake that occured in the Missouri area and changed the course of the Mississippi River is not touched upon, but the film will lead you to read biographies and other histories of the remarkable lives of these great leaders.

For the first time, through the stunning computer graphics of the Santa Barbara Graphics group you will see Cahokia, the valley of Mexico and the Anasazi heartland at Chaco Canyon as it was in Indian times.

639540,5,6303418724,"I learned a great deal from this video.  In one condensed hour, the film discussed the life of many Northeast ""Indian"" nations encountered in the years before and during the American Revolutionary War.  The film is clear and easy to understand, yet explains the changing political and economic terrain of Indian nations as they confronted the arrival of ""Whites.""
With clear maps, plain-spoken narration, and lovely illustrations, the film evokes a time when Indians chose military alliances with French, British, and American forces--a time when Indians had to come to grips with the power of several European forces encroaching on their lands.  We learn of changes in the Indian political-economy (as trading with Whites took precedence over normal activities), the slaughter of wildlife for gain in trade, and the vicious enslavement of Indians by Europeans.
The film is sympathetic to Indians, without being nostalgic or naive.  Indians are not victims or monolithic in the film.  They are political actors trying to survive.  At times they are at war with one another, at times they effectively resist European power, and at times they are brutally slain and attacked with a cruelty mastered by Europeans.  For example, the film discusses biological warfare (blankets w/ smallpox were given to many tribes), and George Washington's all-out assault on Indian villages and crops. (See Max Mintz's _Seeds of Empire_ for a rich account of Washington's brutal campaigns.)
Many more topics are briefly addressed: Pontiac's Rebellion, the US Revolutionary War, and the political amalgamation of Indian nations (who formed confederacies).  And, in a refreshing change, White-Americans are given their voice in 18th century quotes, rather than 20th century ones.  In other words, they are not politically corrected--Whites are given their full racist voice and hatred of Indians.
As a college instructor, I am buying this film (and perhaps others in the 500 Nations series) to show my students.  I'm sure that they will benefit from this honest, complex, and rich look at early encounters between Europeans and Native Americans.  Hopefully they will learn as much as I did.",1071878400,4,2169,5.312865497076023
639541,4,6303418724,"Produced and directed by Jack Leustig, and hosted by Kevin Costner, this second volume is one of the best of the 8 tape series, and though it has a horrifying tale of slaughter and conquest, it also has much beauty as it shows the artifacts of the Aztecs and illustrates their history with excellent paintings, graphics from many sources, maps, and the cinematography of Gary Steele; the score by Peter Buffett also enhances the film.
It is narrated by Gregory Harrison, and the readers of the manuscripts, many written by eyewitnesses of that era, are Edward James Olmos, Tony Plana, Castulo Guerra, Alma Martinez, Robert Beltran, East Carlo, and Jesse Borrego.
Nahuatl anthropologist Eustacio Celestino, and Nahuatl village leader Marcial Camilo are interviewed, both speaking in their native toungue, which is an intriguing and lovely language.
The record of events begins with ""The Valley of Mexico (650 AD)"", where ""cycles of nations had been played out"", # 2 is ""The Rise of the Aztecs (1300 AD)"", and the building of the massive city of Tenochtitlan, and the powerful empire that thrived there. # 3, ""The Invasion of Mexico (1519 AD)"", with the landing of Cortez, and # 4, ""The Fall of the Aztec"", with its many massacres, the murder of  Moctezuma, and the end of the empire, though as Sr. Celestino explains, not of the people or the culture.
I recommend viewing the entire set, as each volume is a facet of this dramatic past, and though much of it is  unpleasant, it is a part of our heritage, and the knowledge and understanding of it enriches our future.
