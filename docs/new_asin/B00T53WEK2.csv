7000208,5,B00T53WEK2,Terrific movie for the whole family. Depicts the days around Pearl Harbor from the perspective of a young boy with a Japanese blood line. Very engaging and educational. Beautifully shot and directed. The movie opened some great discussion with our teenage girls. Highly recommend for the family or for educational purposes in the classroom.,1424908800,,340,5.314814814814815
7000209,5,B00T53WEK2,"Under the Blood Red sun is a captivating novel which was made into a mavelous movie! The story line starts with a hook where Tomi (the protagonist) is fighting with his nemesis. It turns out that it was a dream and that none of it actually happened. Tomi is a Japanese boy who is living on the island of Oahu during the beginning of the United States entrance into WWII. He and his friend, Billy, watch in awe as the Japanese fighters drop bombs onto Pearl Harbor. I will say no more because I do not want to ruin the movie but I can tell you how wonderful it was. My class skyped with the Producer (Dana Hankins) and the author (Graham Salisbury) who are just amazing people, inspirational people. They did an absolutely sublime job with this film! This movie is definitely worth watch, and I give it 5 stars.",1424908800,4,810,4.370860927152318
7000210,5,B00T53WEK2,"This movie was exteremley captivating. I have not read the book yet, but hopefully I will one day. If the book is nearly as interesting as the movie, it will definitely by a great book. It taught about honor, pride in your family, pride in your culture, and bravery. We watched this movie in school because the older kids have read the book, and I want to buy it so I can watch it again and my whole family can watch it. This movie is my favorite movie I have seen all year! I love all the charcters and the setting. It is a great movie for the whole family. Please buy this movie you won't regret it!",1424649600,3,601,4.101694915254237
7000211,5,B00T53WEK2,"Under the Blood Red Sun is a VERY good book about a boy named Tomi and his experience as a Japanese kid during Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. My class read the book last year, but I wasn't at the school I am at now then. I was worried that if I watched the movie and didn't read the book, I wouldn't understand what goes on in the movie, but with Under the Blood Red Sun, I had nothing to worry about! The movie was very easy to follow and the story about Tomi and his experience kept my eyes glued to the screen... I did notice other students doing the same thing! The movie itself was amazing, but my favorite scene was when Tomi went to see his father... I'm not going to spoil it, GO WATCH IT! You won't regret it!!",1424304000,2,712,4.02112676056338
7000212,5,B00T53WEK2,"I loved the movie! I saw it with my teacher, Mrs. Donofrio. I read Under the Blood Red Sun in 6th grade and I saw the movie in 8th grade. The was really good by the way! The movie really matched what I thought while reading it which is weird, because most times the book is different from the movie and the movie is different from my imagination! Anyway, it was a must see! I'm going to ask my parents to buy it because I loved it so much!  Thanks for making a great movie! -Johnny",1424304000,,481,4.010416666666667
7000213,5,B00T53WEK2,"This historic film offers a depth of understanding to the many human lives affected by the Pearl Harbor bombing. It movingly portrays the innocent families and children whose lives changed so much during that time and how important friendship and loyalty was. Author Graham Salisbury, Director Tim Savage and Producer Dana Hankins did a fabulous job of keeping it real and local, using all Hawaii actors and locations. A fabulous young cast brilliantly delivers a heartwarming story the whole family can watch for a deeper look at this important time in history. Highly recommended!",1424217600,2,582,5.202127659574468
7000214,5,B00T53WEK2,"I have had the good fortune to have found Under the Blood Red Sun as a novel to share with my middle school classes.  We read the book in grades 6, 7, and 8 in a three year cycle.  By the time the kids graduate 8th grade, they have read 15 novels with the class, and 15-20 more independently.  Under the Blood Red Sun is a perennial favorite.  The last time we read the book, we learned a movie was in the midst of being filmed, and we have watched it unfold in bits and pieces until, finally, we watched the movie together last month.  All of the students, those who read the book and the new students who had not, loved the film.  It taught them not only about an important piece of our country's history, but also about friendship, family, and honor.  I loved seeing some of the most impactful lines from the story come to life on the screen: ""Nakaji must always be a good name.""  I have read the book many, many times, with hundreds of kids, and I was engrossed watching intense scenes that I have imagined appear before my eyes on the screen: Ojii-chan waving the flag as Japanese planes fly low overhead; Tomi swimming to Sand Island; the pigeons.  Under the Blood Red Sun is a wonderful film for a family or class to watch.  The beautiful Hawaiian scenery, the characters so convincingly portrayed, the realistic footage of Pearl Harbor, the emotional scenes of Tomi and Papa, the humor of the ""Rats"", the life lessons kids really need today all make this a 5 star movie complimenting the award-winning novel.",1424217600,6,1516,4.44043321299639
7000215,3,B00T53WEK2,This is a fantastic and important story well told by award-winning author Graham Salisbury (who also adapted the script). I loved the book and have read it many times. The movie doesn't quite live up to the book (but isn't that what we always say). The cinematography and effects are well done and I thought the acting genuine and heartfelt. I would have given the film four stars had it not been for some inaccuracies in the clothing and sets. This is a great film for kids.,1424131200,,475,4.471264367816092
7000216,5,B00T53WEK2,"If you are looking for a story that is of friendship through the changing times...and different cultures. This story is for you. This movie is a adaptation from the book with the same title. As one that has also read the book this movie has been successful adapted and it is awesome to see the story come more alive through the art of motion-picture. The movie along with the great story line, exhibits great cinematography. This can be seen through how the movie was shot, directed and edited.

For those of you who are commentary buffs and inspiring movie makers the extra features contain a behind the scenes featurette and also a very good but technical commentary.

Overall, this is a very good story, very well shot and directed movie, and best of all a very local production and you can see the ""love"" for the project throughout the story",1424131200,,845,4.626666666666667

8700299,5,B00T53WEK2,Showing the video allows my students to see what they heard read to them as I use the book as a read aloud.

8700303,5,B00T53WEK2,"I was a little girl, living in Honolulu and lived through the years of blackout, soldiers stationed in the empty lots next to our home in the hills and practicing wearing gas masks.  This movie was so real about the times and needs to be seen.  It is a movie of cultures clashing, living together and healing.  Give it a chance.  I still make Hawaii my beloved home.  I saw it and purchased the DVD in Honolulu",1429833600,,410,4.2727272727272725

8700305,5,B00T53WEK2,"The first thing that I have to say is wow. I got to watch the movie for a party at school and I was on the edge of my see the whole time. I loved see in the pigeons in the movie. I also thought that it was cool the author of the book was in the movie! That was so cool!!! All I really have to say is it was an amazing movie and book, and I highly recommend it.",1425340800,,360,3.45679012345679
8700306,5,B00T53WEK2,"This movie was great! I loved how it really showed the grandfather's conflict of being Japenese but having to move on from his old traditions. I would imagine that it would be very hard to let go of something that you had been doing your whole life. I also like how the movie sort of acted as a documentary of life during Pearl Harbor.

8700307,5,B00T53WEK2,"The reason why I gave this movie 5/5 stars is because of the storyline. If you knew me, you would know that I'm not the best reader, but I was really looking forward to reading this one. I've been looking to it because I have heard so many good reviews about it, and when I  found out there was a movie coming out gave up on my search for the book. When my class and I watched the movie, all we could say was how great the movie was.

Thank you",1425254400,,444,3.868131868131868
