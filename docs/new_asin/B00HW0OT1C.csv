Walter, John Heard's character, is infinitely likable! The laughs are mostly comfortable and at times a much needed release from a difficult situation.

A true joy, Stealing Roses is a film about love, moments, and adventure told in a refreshingly relatable way. I loved it!",1417737600,3,511,5.071428571428571
6230119,4,B00HW0OT1C,"Stealing Roses is a hilarious look at sad state of our broken healthcare system.  Though filmed before Obama's fated heath care system more of benefit to insurance companies than the people, it still rings true.",1399334400,4,211,5.0285714285714285
