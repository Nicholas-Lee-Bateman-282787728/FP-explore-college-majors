2922919,3,B000UNYJVI,"Based on the jacket of this DVD, I set my expectations for ""a bloody gore fest."" Trust me, Welcome to the Jungle qualifies more as a bore fest than a gore fest.

I didn't say it was a bore fest exactly. But the Welcome to the Jungle cast doesn't even run into their first native tribe member until about an hour into the film, and the film is only about an hour and 20 minutes long.

Back in 1961 Michael Clark Rockefeller (heir to the Rockefeller fortune) disappeared after a boating accident during an expedition in the Asmat region of New Guinea. It was speculated that Rockefeller drowned, but sensationalized by the theory that he was abducted, living among or perhaps even eaten by cannibals.

Welcome to the Jungle is about two young couples that get the bright idea to take their inexperience and hike into the Asmat jungles to see if they can find any proof of Rockefeller's true fate. Going back to the jacket of the DVD, it tells you that trouble starts when the couples run into ""a fierce tribe of cannibals deep in the jungle."" This gives you the impression that our couples are indiscriminately attacked while on their innocent trek. But everyone knows that today's Asmat Tribesman would only attack if provoked, right?...Like, say, because some knuckle-head desecrated an Asmat gravesite.

Some of the cast do indeed get brutalized. But a gore fest? No.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-the-13th/dp/B00001MXXM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday the 13th</a>&nbsp;has *a lot* more slicing and dicing than you ever see in Welcome to the Jungle.

Yes, when things finally get ugly in this movie...it ain't pretty. It's R-rated stuff, but probably tamer than you're thinking it is.

So all in all...it's an okay movie. I'm no gore-monger, so the lack of it was just fine with me. With the underlying sense that something horrible is going to happen, Hensleigh does a masterful job of quenching the boredom of what amounts to more of a jungle expedition documentary than an all out Horror film.

2922920,3,B000UNYJVI,"This film had potential to really be better than it was. It wasn't bad by any means though. The basic idea is 4 friends who set sail to a new guinea port to explore the new guinea jungle to try and find Michael Rockefeller,hier to the Rockefeller throne. He supposedly went missing 40 years ago and there supposedly have been sightings of a white man with the natives. Is is still alive?did natives who are known to be cannibals eat him?did he die some other way?The one friend knows a helicopter pilot who has flown over this area and supposedly seen a white man. They get the coordinates(also a van) and before long the 4 friends are out looking for him. They end up getting shot at at the one border. Before long the friends(2 couples) are arguing and split up. I say it had more potential because a couple times it seemed like something was happenning and it would just cut to the next day. It did that a couple times. Also this movie  had possibly the most annoying character ever in a film. The one friend Mikey is so annoying,ignorant and stupid you almost want to kill him yourself.

Jonathan Hensleigh conceived of the film, about two couples who head into the jungle of Indonesian-controlled Papua New Guinea to find a decades-lost Rockefeller son. See, the seed of this tale is the real-life disappearance of Nelson Rockefeller, son of the U.S. Vice President at the time. Nelson was an anthropologist lost in a cannibal-infested jungle. Maybe he got eaten by a shark. Maybe he got eaten by people. Maybe he got made king by a man-eating tribe and lives to this day as a grizzled white man among his dark subjects.

The ride is a fun one, even if it is predictable once things start to go downhill for the quartet. The improvisational work before the camera is fairly good, although four super-good-looking people willing to throw themselves into certain death - or at least terrible risk - is a bit baffling. A little bit more characterization needed to be established to make us really believe these kids would go this far all alone for $250,000 individual paydays.",1194825600,6,1387,6.338624338624339

2922926,1,B000UNYJVI,"SPOILER ALERT.
Man oh man what a bad film. I hope these people who were in the movie don't call themselves actors after this farce. Four `college' age youths who meet up in Fiji decide to track down a vice President's son Michael Rockefeller who disappeared in 1961 off the coast where the Asmat tribe reside in the Papua province of Indonesia. These kids think that by finding proof that he is still alive will bring them at least a million bucks so they decide to leave the comforts of Fiji and head off to Papua New Guinea. Well the movie up to this point had really sucked so I thought maybe now that they are headed into the danger that it may (for the love of all things holy) get better-it didn't. First of all, they all load up with back packs not much larger than what I used to take to school on a daily basis.  Second, with the available information given or lack thereof they do not have much hiking experience. Third, they are quoted as saying that the Papua province is the second most dangerous place in the world only behind Iraq yet they feel with their limited hiking experience, a single firearm and no guide that they might be `ok'. Now I know if horror films all made sense then there would be very few of them but I can state this in the case of this film because it is not horror, not suspenseful but just extremely boring. The four cant stop bitching at one another till one couple decide to leave on their only raft and leave the other couple stranded in order to get more of the money-plus they are tired of the other couples crap. They start to see natives along the shoreline and think that this might be a good time to get off the raft (bad idea for any of us) even though they have not been shown any signs of aggression. Once off the raft and into the jungle they are confronted and that's when Mike starts firing at the natives killing a couple but since there are twenty of them who have been trained their whole lives to use a bow and arrow, they make Mike pay for his wrongdoing. At this point the girl is running through the forest back to the river (that they should have never left) and this is when the `documentary style' filming hurts the film because no one (especially her) in that position is going to continue to film while running for their lives. Well rewind the tape now because the other stranded couple decides to make a perfectly good raft and proceed to do the exact same thing as the first couple including getting off the raft in a hostile area!! They find the bodies of their two friends and then some newly killed missionaries that they ran across earlier in their trip. Funny thinking about it now is that some were eaten and some were just killed. The other guy finds Mike half eaten so he does him a favor and shoots him with a gun in the middle of the night. Nothing like keeping a low profile when you are in a cannibal infested jungle!!. Finally the couple that is left find what appear to be different natives and these natives act like their friends until they kill them and cut them up. The end. And then I died................",1335225600,5,3092,4.321858864027539

The first part is like watching a bunch of college age back packers taking a camping trip.  Only when it pans to shots of pissed of spear carrying natives, does it get interesting.

2922932,2,B000UNYJVI,"An 80minute cannibal flick from Dimension Extreme?  Sounds like my kinda senseless gorefest.  Well, don't believe the bloody hype.  This handheld camera venture is more of a documentary on human stupidity than on barbaric cannibalism.  For shame....

The setup is pretty interesting, and is rooted in fact.  In 1961, the Vice-President's son Michael Clark Rockefeller disappeared after a boating mishap during a little expedition in New Guinea.  A massive manhunt ensued, but after the diligent search proved unsuccessful rumors surfaced that he drowned, was shredded by crocodiles, or even devoured by cannibals.

So, four decades later a group of young whippersnappers get the brilliant idea to go into the jungle searching for some clues on Rock's fate.  They have outrageous dreams of selling the info to the tabloids for a million bucks.  Yee-haw!
Of course, this was a bad idea.

Bad things could happen....  Really bad...

Most of this movie is about two couples walking through the jungle, bitching and moaning.  Unbelievably uneventful.  Not to mention the quest is entirely incomprehensible.

Not much action here at all.  No nudity.  No human devourage shown either.  We basically are just shown glimpses of the aftermath, which is of course pretty brutal looking.

After I saw the movie, I felt a complete deception. Not only because the region of New Guinea is spectacular and in the movie you can hardly observed its beauty, because of the superficial, vanished and wrong way to present such tribe know as Asmat. Being these facts not enough, at the end of the movie appears walking giving his back an old man, which we; the spectators, are supposed to think as Mr. Rockefeller. What a bluff !!!

2922935,2,B000UNYJVI,"As you've no doubt read from previous reviews, the DVD packaging and description of Welcome to the Jungle would make you think that this is a 21st century Cannibal Holocaust.  Well, as you've no doubt figured out by now, it ain't.  Welcome to the Jungle is instead an ill-fated semi-character study that follows a group of people (Sandy Gardiner, Callard Harris, Nick Richey, and Veronica Sywak) as they head into the New Guinea jungles in search of the heir to the Rockefeller fortune, who has been missing since 1961.  We get to know this crew, for quite a while, before there is any action with cannibal tribesmen.  All the build-up would be acceptable with we actually came to like the characters here and there were ample amounts of blood and gore (which are usually synonymous with cannibal flicks), but alas, the characters are annoying (and the acting is pretty bad to boot), and there is barely any blood to be found.  Written and directed by Jonathan Hensleigh (the writer/director of 2004's The Punisher), Welcome to the Jungle is dreadfully underwhelming to say the least.  While Hensleigh's filming technique offers a bit in the realm of suspense, it doesn't last long.  Not to mention that at a brisk 80 plus minute running time, the film just feels poorly conceived.  All in all, Welcome to the Jungle is an example of not judging a book by its cover.  The film isn't scary, and old fans of the cannibal genre will be extremely disappointed with the end result here.  That aside, the film may be worth a look at the very least for horror fans, but there isn't enough here to really recommend it.",1203379200,5,1610,4.697508896797153
2922936,3,B000UNYJVI,"Well it definitely ain't Cannibal Holocaust, that's for sure,
but it's does have a few of it's own moments.
None nearly as graphic or remotely as brutal, mind you.

Four morons set out into the jungle in search of the lost Rockerfeller,
in hopes of rescuing him, and claiming the million dollar reward.
What they find instead is hostile, blood-thirsty, cannibals who paint themselves white, and well.....they eat morons.

The dialogue is juvenile, but it keeps the story moving.
Struggles within the surrounding communities, as well as highway robberies, prevent the viewer from losing interest before entering the jungle.
Once inside the green labyrinth away from civilization confrontations flare, and the stupidity flows in abundance.

Obvious connections will be drawn between this and ""The Blair Witch Project"" due to the identical style and pace.
But this flick had one thing going for it that it's predecessor didn't.
A visible, tangible enemy.
If ""Blair Witch"" ended with cannibals, you'd essentially have this flick.

Sadly though, none of the violence takes place onscreen,
all you're ever witness to is the bloody aftermath,
(chick hung from a pole through her head, various organs and limbs scattered about, and a writhing, limbless wonder)

My one major gripe is that they don't even bother to show the cannibals eating people.
Which is insane, considering this is a cannibal movie!!

Unlike most of the reviews, I found this film to be disturbing and horrifying. Horror is my genre that I love to watch and I love special effects, but this film had an eeriness about it that caught me off-guard. It starts out in Suva, the capital of Fiji. Maybe it was the fact that I had been to Suva, and to one of the Fijian islands that affected me. Aside from that, the hurky-jerky video cameras that taped the ordeal of four very ignorant twenty-somethings, was, I agree, similar to the Blair Witch Project, but lent a feeling of authenticity to the ""vacation"" the foursome was on. It reveals the division between the two couples--one couple very rationale and cautious, driven by the goal to find Michel Rockefeller who had disappeared in 1961, and the other couple who viewed the journey as a lark and partied hearty every night, which underscored their inability to take anything seriously and led to their demise. The four are pulled into the jungle by their morbid curiosity and ignore the ""signs"" that would send most people running in another direction. That's what makes it ""real."" They are driven, ignorant city dwellers who have no concept of the area or its flesh-eating inhabitants. The movie slowly builds, but if you put yourself there, on the raft, in the jungle, this film will grab you. But, I also liked Open Water which bored most people.

Not only does it start out awful and get worse... it gets downright ridiculous.  This is the single worst movie that I have ever seen in my entire life.  The plot is absolutely ludicrous.  It is literally unbelievable.  I honestly can't believe that Dimension Films green-lighted this project.  ""Hey... I got it... let's make a film about four idiots that are on vacation in New Guinea, and arbitrarily decide to go searching for Michael Rockefeller... you know... that guy that was the son of the governor of New York that disappeared in 1961 that four different governments were unable to find... better yet, let's shoot it on a couple of handycams like the Blair Witch Project... sound good?""  Uh, no.

Honest to God, there is actually a part in the movie where the four main characters are given a traveler's advisory that says, ""if you see a child or a woman in the middle of the road, either drive by or turn around, because they just want you to stop so that they can rob you.  Serious harm and/or death can and usually does result if you stop.""  About 3 minutes later, this very thing happens, and what do our heroes do?  You guessed it... stop dead, and talk about what to do for a couple minutes.  Of course, four guys with guns come out and start shooting at the car.

This movie is so incredibly bad, that I wanted to drive back to Blockbuster and start slapping people that were standing anywhere near the other copies of this movie and were contemplating renting it.  I can't even find the words to describe how bad this film actually is.  I sat there after the movie ended and racked my brain about what movies I've see that are actually worse, and I couldn't think of a single one.  It was so bad that it wasn't even fun to make fun of it... it was WAY too annoying for that.  Every minute of that film that I sat through was more annoying than the last.  I'm so bummed that I wasted an hour and fifteen minutes of my life, along with $2.99 and however many IQ points I lost.

2922940,1,B000UNYJVI,"This is one boring, frustrating mess. Probably the worst thing about this very short movie is the hand-held camera technique used throughout. Think ""Blair Witch"" without the suspense and talent. You follow two couples who spend their time bickering and bitching and lose any interest in them as people. Then you never see any cannibals--all suspiciously caucasians wearing dark make-up--until the very end. There's zero gore or suspense. For long segments there's pitch darkness when the camera lays on the ground. As for the jungle, it all looks like it was filmed somewhere in American canyons. The people never emerge as real people but only as stereotypes of shallow, unlikeable American kids. The box illustration is completely misleading.

Some viewers will be disappointed that no one gets eaten, decapitated, raped, or eviscerated in this film. And the killings occur mostly off camera. So what makes this film worth watching?

8213980,2,B000UNYJVI,"The disappearance of Michael Rockefeller in the jungles of New Guinea in 1961, is the key event in Welcome to the Jungle (2007), an adventure that follows two couples who trek into the jungle, in search of the missing man.  The movie consists entirely of video segments shot by the explorer's cameras.  The ""found footage"" aspect has a certain sense of ""realism"", which is countered by the camera operating at the most unlikely and dangerous times.

Colby (Callard Harris) and his girlfriend Mandi (Sandy Gardiner) and their friends who have just become lovers, Bijou (Veronica Sywak) and Mikey (Nick Richey), come to New Guinea, bound for a location where Michael Rockefeller is rumored to have been sighted.  After nearly being killed by natives, the group heads into the jungle on foot.  The couples soon become polarized, and spend much of their time constantly bickering with each other.  Unable to resolve their differences, the couples part ways at about the two thirds mark, and the final act features them on their separate journeys.

Some four decades later, the possibility that Rockefeller might be alive is already infinitesimal, but the farfetched premise soon becomes increasingly ridiculous, as the explorers are revealed to be clueless, and completely unprepared for a trek into the wild.  The fact that the cast is being shot on live video in a real jungle, gives the movie a certain sense of realism, but this is countered by characters who behave in unrealistic ways, and live like they are on Gilligan's Island.  The explorer's backpacks are bottomless, with an inexhaustible supply of food, booze, and spare camera batteries.

Perhaps to make up for a lack of a more coherent story, much time is devoted to random travels and petty squabbling, which only serves to make the characters more unlikeable, and emphasize the absurdity of the tale.  The video camera aspect makes for some interesting images, and there is eventually a payoff in the final act, as tension rises, and blood is spilled, but it's not enough to make the video a recommended watch, despite some rather shocking images.  The actors really aren't to blame for the story's deficiencies, or for doing what was asked of them.",1410652800,,2213,5.0
