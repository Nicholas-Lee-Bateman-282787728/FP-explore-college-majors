  What a cool day & age we live in where technology lets us be a ""fly on the wall"" and observe a pro mixing engineer go through the entire process of mixing a song.  Shane talks about his strategy, his use of computer based effects, and integrating outboard gear.  I am a better mixing engineer because of what Shane taught me during this video.  I teach classes at a local university and I have included this video as a part of my syllabus for my audio students.

  The inclusion of all the audio tracks for the session, so you can practice the mixing techniques .... that's pretty killer too!!

  It's also very interesting to check out the summing shootout provided, in-the-box vs. out-of-the-box methods.
