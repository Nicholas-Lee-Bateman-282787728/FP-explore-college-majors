2345354,5,B000A0GXGU,"These teaser/taster/tester compilations are things that people love to hate.
I love them because-----as a CASUAL fan of the show----- compilations let
me re-visit a show one rainy Saturday afternoon...
IF-----I say if...-----I enjoy my ""visit"", I can always buy another season... or
whatever the heck IS available.",1413158400,2,314,5.5625

2345359,5,B000A0GXGU,"Oh, how these shows bring me back to my childhood years. I'm 32 now and I still love watching them. I only hope that my kids will enjoy them as much as I did. I wish they were all filmed in their original location (Covington, GA). I also hope that they release the reunion movies on DVD soon. I believe my hometown was mentioned a couple of times in the shows also. I'll always be a loyal Dukes of Hazzard fan!!!!",1129507200,,413,4.111111111111111
2345360,5,B000A0GXGU,"The opening comment clearly states that the disc has 3 of the best episodes of the first three seasons.  Since those seasons are available in their entirety and for a respectable price each, need I say more? This is yet another disc which was only manufactured in the SLIM chance the shopper needs to replace defective discs already in your library.  As a separate purchase in general, it's a waste of money.  As Peter Yarrow, Noel Paul Stookey and Mary Travers would say, ""Oh when will we ever learn...."":-).  Buy the complete sets 1, 2 and 3 and you'll get these episodes and then some.",1126828800,11,588,4.571428571428571
2345361,5,B000A0GXGU,"I remember this show from when my grandpa used to sit down in our livingroom and turn on The Dukes of Hazzard County. I would be amazed by the excitement. Not just the people but the cars! Oh my God! When that car first made its trademark jump you knew that this was something special. The big thrills out of this show was enough for the rest of my life. I will never forget those times and you shouldn't either! Take this oppurtunity and purchase the best of the best episodes made! This will not be a regreted descision.

  The Dukes, a crooked sherrif,beautiful women, awesome cars! and of course....J.D. Hogg.

  Shows like these are fading. Don't let it die. I have waited a long time for these to finally come to dvd. Now it's here and I LOVE it.

I hope this helps you decide......",1126224000,7,788,4.3561643835616435
