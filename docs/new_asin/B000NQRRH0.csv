8180889,2,B000NQRRH0,"I needed a video which would be helpful in making a 7-9 year old into a QB.  I needed a video which would go over the details of taking a snap, footwork, hand-off, cadence, timing, and all of the other things I don't even know I should know about.  At this age level, passing is the least I need to be working on.

This video did not meet my needs; although on the surface it appeared as if it would.  The picture on the case shows (or looks like) a 7-9 year old focused on making a hand-off.  The title talks about youth development.

What the video contains are mostly QB drills (and the reason behind them).  The drills are being executed by 13+ year olds.  Over half of the video covers passing.

If that is what you are looking for, I would give this video a solid 3 for the $40 price.  If you are looking for a video on developing 7-9 year olds, this is not going to be very helpful.",1198454400,5,889,4.086705202312139
