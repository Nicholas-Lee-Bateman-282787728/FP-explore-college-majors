8017204,5,B0001WJMTM,This is a fabulous film.  It has some humor but is mostly a serious film.  It's a great film to use with students to learn something about Puerto Rico.  The only problem is that it's pretty long so you certainly cannot see it all in class. There is very little that is not appropriate for classroom use.  Mostly I believe profanity is the issue.  Also good film for recent history of Puerto Rico.  Subtitles seem to be accurate.,1288828800,,428,4.423076923076923
8017205,1,B0001WJMTM,"This movie stinks!  The acting is horrible--phony and insincere.  The story line could've been done better.  Don't waste your money.  I wanted to love it, but I couldn't even bear to finish it.  I would much rather watch a Dominican comedy instead...better acting and at least if I'm laughing, the humor was intended, as opposed to laughing at the horrible acting.

Horrible!  Los actrices son de los peores que hay.  Por mucho que quisiera que me encantara...yo ni pude terminar esta vaina.  Sorry!  Wish I could say something positive.  Hay alguien que me puede recomendar una buena pelicula boricua!  Que horrible introduccion al cine boricua!",1261267200,,646,5.0476190476190474
