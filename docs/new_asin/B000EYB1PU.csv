8115779,5,B000EYB1PU,"This is drawn from a story written by Robert Sheckley in 1958-- made into a TV show in the seventies, then into a movie in 1983.

Check your history books.

There was no reality television in 1958-- or in the early seventies-- and nothing in 1983 is anywhere near a tenth as wild or powerful as shown in this movie.  Set in a Unified Europe with a single currency, multiple shared television channels, bank failures and massive unemployment, while it sounds almost like last week's headlines NONE of it existed when the story was written.

The US VHS tape is dubbed well in English, and it is almost too ""current and on breaking news topics"" to believe it has been over twenty five years since it hit the theaters.

A very strange and frightening tale of reality television getting completely out of control, so out of control contestants die-- it's more believable now than when it was released.

And that's interesting all by itself.
