Like others have shared, the [lack of] editing is absolutely cringe worthy - it's like a really bad 1980's home movie (REALLY BAD).  I mean, you might get entertainment out of it from a 'omg, they really put this out there?!?' perspective...but not looking for information on living a healthy lifestyle.  As well, this family has scammed a LOT of people out of a lot of money...taking no responsibility.  I highly recommend saving your time and money and putting it towards documentaries that do good in this world.",1493510400,,625,4.923809523809524
8189838,1,B000P7VA20,"I have never watched a more boring DVD in my life! I was SOOOO looking forward to this DVD but it is so long & drawn out, most of it is Storm & his wife playing VERY new-agey music. Every monologue needs editing. EG: Storm tells a story of his son racing him up a hill - it went on & on & on with lengthy descriptions of his son gaining on him, running, running, running - I started fast forwarding - the story was still going - fast forward again - still going - it must go for 10 minutes & all it is about is his son's stamina in running up a hill! It is a very self indulgent amaturish video of Storm's rants about, well, everything & I suspect it's real aim is to flog their music. Do not waste your money there are far better, more informative & more interesting DVDs on the raw lifestyle!",1260489600,10,794,4.0
8189839,3,B000P7VA20,"All this documentary really was, was a guy talking about everything that pisses him off about food in America... And it shows his kids climbing up rocks, and you get to hear his wife mumble about how bright and aware and brilliant their kids are, and how her raw pregnancy was really amazing, and she only had 2 or 2.5 hour labors & the babies came out like ""little lambs"".. It's got A LOT of VERY new agey music, which not everyone likes... and by A LOT, I mean at least 1/2 the documentary is of the guy and the wife playing music, and no one talking about anything... About the only people that DO talk are the guy & his wife (storm & jinjee).. and Storm rants and raves about all sorts of stuff and getting back to nature and all that. They give you no information about how you can be raw, they don't show you any recipes, they did show some people (in their family) that have lost about 75 lb or more, and one girl was from Sweden & she took raw food back there..

Jinjee I guess had a lump in her breast before she went raw (like 30 years ago), and she stopped for a while & the lump came back, so she started raw again and it went away (I found that out on a YouTube video she had posted).. But there was not much on here that was really very profound, and unfortunately Storm was very difficult to understand in a lot of the film... It's like he does not open his mouth to enunciate words. He couldn't even pronounce Mono Sodium Glutimate (MSG), which he ranted on for about 10 minutes. He sounds very mumbley, which was very frustrating for me. He is OBVIOUSLY an incredibly intelligent individual, he just does not enunciate is words very well & it is difficult to understand, until you get into how he talks. When I first heard him talking, I thought he was high.. By high, I mean smoking marijuana high... Which may or may not be what you want in someone who is representing raw food to people. lol

On the up side, their kids are awful cute, and don't have ADD or any kind of health problems a lot of children who eat a SAD (Standard American Diet). They are very intelligent kids. Storm and Jinjee took a trip to the doctor and showed how the kids normalized in height/weight, and one was even taller than 90% of kids his age, which I thought was pretty neat.

But this film is basically just hippy rants about society and the way we eat. I am already interested in raw food, so you don't have to preach to the choir. The film left a lot of questions unanswered, and I was pretty disappointed by that.. However, I guess you can go drop a hundred bucks or so on their website (for all their books, dvd's and etc) to find out about the stuff you want to know.. Like weight loss, curing disease, recipes and raw pregnancy. Had they talked more about any of those things, or shown any scientific evidence for raw food or anything, it would have been a lot better, in my opinion (but opinions are like butt holes, as we all know!)..

I am not saying, by any means, that you should not purchase this DVD. It is good. Storm does go over some nutrients of cooked vs raw foods, but I just don't want anyone to be disappointed about what the film really is.. Hippies ranting about food. If you expect that, then you will not be disappointed. If you like really new agey music, and recorder duets, then you will love the music in the film. I didn't think it added anything to the film, except maybe a ""you can buy my album on my website"" kind of shameless self promotion.

3 stars, because it is a good documentary, has some relevant information, and the kids are uber cute... 2 stars taken off for SO much music, Storm being so difficult for me to understand and for all the rants without the proof (I believe what he is saying, and I have the same thoughts, but for skeptics and people that want more proof and evidence, who may be more analytical about stuff, this was very lacking!)

I subscribe to their newsletter and I love what they are doing, so I hope no one gets me wrong on this. Would I recommend this DVD, YES I WOULD! I even called Netflix and requested that they carry it, so MORE people can watch it!",1247011200,14,4121,4.25
8189840,4,B000P7VA20,"I really want to like this film but it has some flaws.  The film quality is not great so some of the audio is hard to  hear.  I think that a lot of footage could have been edited down a bit to avoid some long, often times, boring scenes of Storm and Jinjee playing music and rock climbing.
I also hoped for information regarding detoxing, transitioning from cooked vegan to high raw, etc.
Complaints aside, this film is beautiful to watch, the family is healthy, strong and active.  As a child of the '70's and '80's who grew up watching tons of t.v. eating sugary cereals and chef boyardee I could see the difference in the health of these children and my own childhood that was riddled with ear aches and other illnesses.
I think that if you are interested in the raw food lifestyle this is a must-see, however, split the cost with friends or loan it to others.  I probably would only watch it once.",1241740800,8,901,4.37125748502994
