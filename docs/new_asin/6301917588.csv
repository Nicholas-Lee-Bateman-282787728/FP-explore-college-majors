384409,2,6301917588,"the VHS came wrapped as if it were new but the box was marked ""used very good"" I paid 14.99 for what I thought was a new VHS.
I will not do business with MWMDVD any more.",1371168000,,170,3.6216216216216215
384410,5,6301917588,I had seen this movie on TV and enjoy the fall up from the Great Escape original movie.  I had told my mother about it and was glad I was able to get it.,1357603200,,153,3.5
384411,5,6301917588,I just got this movie today and I was shock on how well its condition is. It looks brand new I have a feeling the picture quality is going to be just as good,1339113600,,157,3.6470588235294117
384412,3,6301917588,It was an interesting way to have a follow up with the escaped prisoners.  How much of this was actual fact and how much was hollywood hype is up in the air.  It was an entertaining movie overall.,1335571200,,196,4.131578947368421
384413,2,6301917588,"I'm a real history buff, especially for WWII related subjects & I saw the original mini-series The Great Escape the Untold Story. This true story is a great addition to the original movie because it completes the whole saga that took place during & after the war & definitly needed to be told. But when it came out on video I was dissapointed with the extreme editing which essentually ruined it. In my opinion don't buy this video. I hope that they release it on DVD fully unedited.",1305244800,2,483,4.5
384414,4,6301917588,HAVING SEEN THIS PROGRAM ON TV I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE SOME OF THE BEST PARTS HAS BEEN ELIMINATED.THEY ADDED A LOT TO THE UNDERATANG OF THE FILM. IT MADE STATEMENTS IN THE FILM HAVE MORE MEANING. IN THOSE SCENE IHE PRESENTATION MADE ON SENCE. S.G.K,1283558400,,247,4.391304347826087
384415,1,6301917588,"The VHS recorded tape of this made-for-tv movie was a travesty.  The original film was shown in 2 nights. The running time of the original was 178 mins.  Vidmark's VHS version is 93 mins. You do the math.  What is left is a film that makes absolutely no sense to a first time viewer. Some of the scenes are spliced together with no thought to continuity, jumping from one scene to another.  Viewers are bound to wonder ""what did I miss"". I would highly recommend giving this VHS version a definite ""miss"".  If I could rate it lower than 1 star I most would do so.",1136419200,5,563,4.273584905660377
384416,1,6301917588,"The original miniseries was a really good show . . . all four hours of it.  But this release has been so severely slashed [to just 93 minutes, less than half of the story] that the story makes no sense.  Actions seem to be taken for no reason at all [when the basis for the action was dropped to the cutting room floor].  The people who made this travesty ought to be ashamed of themselves.",1130112000,8,390,4.173333333333333
384417,2,6301917588,"Apparently D. Brown never saw the original release on TV.  (And Wings Day did NOT escape to Italy; he was re-captured, and sent to Sachsenhausen concentation camp -- from which he also tunnelled out.)

  I wish I had read the review of ""A Viewer"" before ordering.  The commercial version omits several scenes, including ""Mike Corey""'s arrival at Sagan and a large chunk of him being re-united with the French Resistance agent, ""Marie"".

  If this is re-released on DVD, I hope Vidmark will use the original version; then I will definitely upgrade my review.",1116115200,10,557,4.913978494623656
384418,5,6301917588,I enjoed this movie a lot.  It's hard to beat the 1963 Great Escape but this one is good.  I thought this movie was very accurate.  I recommend it for Great Escape fans!,1101772800,,169,4.0606060606060606
7817691,5,6301917588,A gift and was much appreciated,1513814400,,31,4.333333333333333
7817692,3,6301917588,"I wish I had known or remembered the original edition was longer.  I am a long time WW-2 history buff, and was severely disappointed this was edited with so many scenes omitted.  Why would anyone want an edited edition of this event.  Since, after reading some of the other reviews, I find I am not the only one who feels this way.  I would suggest the seller make it more plain this is NOT the unedited original.",1500163200,,413,4.324675324675325
7817693,3,6301917588,"It's ok, just wish it was full length. 90 minutes of a 3 hour movie. It's all cut up.",1484697600,,85,3.526315789473684
7817694,5,6301917588,saw this on tv and loved it wished it was on dvd,1475107200,,48,3.0833333333333335
7817695,5,6301917588,That was a good movie.  They went through a LOT in Nazi Germany!  It was riveting.,1462665600,,82,4.0625

7817698,1,6301917588,This was NOT the real story of the Great Escape but a fictionalized film!  I was very disappointed!  The original film was better even if it included the Steve Mcqueen bit!,1401667200,,172,4.516129032258065
7817699,5,6301917588,"My dad was looking for this movie, The Great Escape II: The Untold Story. I found this on this website and it is a good movie.",1395360000,,126,3.8846153846153846
7817700,2,6301917588,"The VCR that I have was made to run on a low speed, and was apparently cut to make it fit a time schedule for media showing.  Still the story and the acting are excellent.  It is an excellent followup to the original ""Great Escape"" and well worth watching.  If it were possible to find all the missing parts and put it in a DVD format, it could be truly outstanding.",1373760000,,366,4.126760563380282
