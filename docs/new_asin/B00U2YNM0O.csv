7028735,2,B00U2YNM0O,"The DVD reminds me of a a Neil Diamond fan's Internet video play list.  The performances were not all filmed or taped at the same time or place.
So the audio / video varies from recording to recording.",1432252800,5,201,4.2894736842105265
7028736,2,B00U2YNM0O,Quality of video was very poor also most songs were on other Neil Diamond dvds.,1431734400,3,79,4.333333333333333
7028737,1,B00U2YNM0O,"This is a young Neil Diamond singing 11 of his songs from various venues.  As a warning this DVD is of poor audio and video quality, which was a great disappointment.",1431475200,5,166,4.354838709677419
8704363,3,B00U2YNM0O,"A nice addition to the collection, but didn't recognize a lot of the songs,  That could be a good thing and it's all Neil Diamond.",1501804800,,130,4.2

8704368,3,B00U2YNM0O,"The quality is terrible, but there is some very interesting vintage footage here that I'd love to see in original quality.",1445644800,,122,4.857142857142857
8704369,4,B00U2YNM0O,"Despite the negative reviews I read on Amazon, I like this concert film and I am glad that I bought it.  The picture quality is okay but the soundtrack could be better.  The tracks on this DVD are: Cherry Cherry, Sweet Caroline, I Am I Said, Beautiful Noise, Cracklin Rosie, Dancing Bumble Bee, Say Maybe, Play Me, Sweet Caroline, Longfellow Serenade, Shilo, and I Have Been This Way Before.  Neil is accompanied by Shirley Bassey on Play Me, not on Longfellow Serenade as indicated on the DVD.  Sweet Caroline is a great song but one version per concert film is enough.  Two versions of the same song on one concert film is unnecessary.  All of the songs are on other Neil Diamond concert DVD's except Dancing Bumble Bee, Say Maybe, and Shilo.  The performance of Shilo is from a very early and vintage Neil Diamond appearance.  Each song is performed at different venues and times.",1435536000,8,883,4.651612903225806

8704371,4,B00U2YNM0O,"Yes, some of the clips are of poor quality but the ones of Neil Diamond in 1971 are great to see and worth having the DVD. (One clip looks as tho it could be even earlier). Technology wasn't what it is today. So who cares about sound quality!?",1433376000,2,243,4.083333333333333
