It is English sub's with Chinese audio. The characters are referenced under the Guan Yu/Lu Bu translation style.

I've been a big fan of the three kingdoms epic for quite some time.  After watching a great deal of these discs, thus far, I would have to say I am quite pleased with this series.

If you're a fan of the three kingdoms, then I'd highly recommend it.  I'd also note that if you're not a fan of reading, then this is quite a good substitute to digest a masterwork of literature.",1457049600,,656,4.408333333333333

8181449,1,7799008261,I ordered this and waited way to long for it to arrive then when it did I got two of the same volume clearly I wanted volume 1 an 2 but got two of volume 1. Not only that but the serial numbers where tampered with and the spine to one of them was completely torn off. I wouldn't recommend buying from this buyer.,1406937600,,312,3.890625
