3666667,5,B001KNAI2Q,"This is a great fireplace DVD, although I cannot compare it to any others because it is the only/first I have owned. It features real wood, which is great because it crackles just like a normal fire. The sound quality is pretty good I'd say, and the video shows up very nicely even on my 42' 720p plasma (albeit using a Blu-ray player, which up-converts the signal). I find it a very relaxing way to fill in the silence when I'm just reading/studying on the couch. Very nice product overall!",1235520000,,491,4.466666666666667
3666668,5,B001KNAI2Q,"The full-screen fireplace shot makes your t.v. seem just like a real fireplace; you almost want to back up to it!! It creates an especially cozy feeling on gray days and cold nights.  This product is much better than the other DVD's in that it shows only the fireplace opening; not some cheesy mantle or other decoration.  Another plus is the realistic sound; much preferable to background music.
A really great DVD, and exactly what I was looking for.",1233446400,2,452,4.708860759493671
3666669,5,B001KNAI2Q,"This is a great alternative to the real deal. The quality is good and it almost makes you feel warmer. I love to put on the stereo, my new fireplace dvd and have a glass of wine. That's what I'm talkin bout.",1233273600,,207,3.9523809523809526
3666670,5,B001KNAI2Q,I have a small condo and have always wished it had the space for a fireplace.  I discovered this Fireplace DVD and am so pleased with it...it is the next best thing to having the real thing.  I can almost feel the heat.  It creates a relaxing atmosphere complete with the crackling of the wood as it burns (but without the mess of cleaning up afterwards!).  This is perfect for a quiet day curled up with a good book or a beautiful background for a party.,1230422400,4,455,4.255813953488372
3666671,5,B001KNAI2Q,"We don't have a real fireplace, and missed the ambiance a fire provides. When reading the other reviews I decided to give this DVD a try, and I am thrilled. It gives us the feel of a real fire on our big screen, and adds the perfect touch to the room. You can set the DVD to play the full flames, low flames, full flame to embers or cozy fire, and it will loop for you. There are no distractions with hearth's, cheesy christmas music or other distractions. Just the wood burning fire, and soft crackling. I am extremely pleased with this DVD, great job, and it will provide many hours of relaxation. Shipping was quick, we are very satisfied.",1229126400,12,642,4.358333333333333
3666672,5,B001KNAI2Q,"I was very impressed with this video.  I actually ordered 2 others and was not satisfied.  I liked this Fireplace DVD best because 1. it was a real fire and 2. it fills the screen.  I really didn't like the cheesy foregrounds of another DVD I bought.  Whenever we have people over to the house and want some background, but not a distraction we put this on and people always love it.",1226966400,52,383,4.277777777777778
3666673,5,B001KNAI2Q,"This dvd only offers 1 fire, which is kind of nice because you can tell the producers went for quality over quantity.  The fire really gives off a nice natural warm glow.  I really like that you can see the whole fire from when it starts to where it burns down to glowing embers.

I love putting the dvd on and curling up with a book on a rainy day. Ahhh so relaxing!",1226534400,18,367,4.0
3666674,5,B001KNAI2Q,"My wife and I traveled to Pennsylvania last Christmas to visit family. We were excited about enjoying a snowy white Christmas (we live in Florida) but were disappointed when we learned my sister did not have a fireplace. We feel the presence of a fireplace during the holidays is a total necessity.

Before our departure we found Plasmacandy's DVD surfing the web. I haven't watched any other fireplace DVDs, but this one is great. It simulates a real fire with real wood, it even has all the sounds. This DVD is great for the holidays and for romance; five stars.",1226016000,11,564,4.64

3666680,5,B001KNAI2Q,"I purchased a Polaroid 24"" HDTV w/DVD player which I put in my fireplace.  I used this DVD.  It worked great.  The whole arrangement cost us about $150.  The wonderful thing is that I used to go through 4 cords of wood a season when I was in Bentleyville, OH.  Now we are in Sylvania Twp., OH.  There is still a lot of wood here, but in our new house there is not the room to put all the wood and we are not getting any younger.  This is a wonderful substitute.  It is not the real thing, but close enough.  We like it.",1512086400,2,519,3.9134615384615383

3666683,4,B001KNAI2Q,"This DVD is pretty neat. It has 3 sections; high flame, medium flame and low embers. You can continuously loop any of the 3 sections or loop the entire DVD. Would be better if it was in Blue Ray or even 4K UHD but standard DVD is still OK. Turn the volume up and listen to the crackling and popping of the wood. Very nice ambiance with absolutely no hassle. Perfect for when the snow is falling and you're snuggling with your honey.",1508630400,2,432,4.216867469879518

3666691,5,B001KNAI2Q,Saw this in a gift shop in Branson. The crackling sound really sells the realism. I plan to get a flat screen that will fit inside our fire screen. They are under $170 now and disk players for $39. So I'll have an electric fireplace that people will have to walk over to feel the lack of heat to believe it's not real. It even burns down to embers after an hour or two. - Great.,1481587200,,378,3.986842105263158

There are no noticeable delays from looping and the sound and image seems natural enough that one can be entertained simply staring into the flames and drifting off into thought as I often do at a campfire.  I can't think of anything to complain about save for the lack of heat and failure to smell roasting pine logs.  Perhaps in the Oculus Rift edition.

I usually set the program on the three-stage fire and enjoy the sound of the fire crackling (I set the volume low).  If anyone feels annoyed by the fire sounds being artificial, the visual of the fire with the sound off is a nice way to enjoy also.
Ironically, the tv is adjacent to an actual gas fireplace that I never use due to high mountain winds in my area necessitating temporarily sealing off the chimney due to wind-whistling sounds!!  The fireplace video means I don't have to remove the sound-proofing material from my fireplace and I can still enjoy an easy to use ""fireplace"".

The entire thing runs about 30 minutes. Then the screen goes black for about 30 seconds and starts up again. The various stages (high, medium and low) also can be looped. They go for about 10 minutes then start up again at the beginning of that phase without more than a slight pause. It is very relaxing and fun to watch. My partner and I looked at electric fireplaces and found some that were very good furniture but the ""fire"" itself was so very feeble and phony that we opted for this instead. The picture (the TV is set on full screen) fills the screen completely and the color is bright and sharp. The sound is mostly roaring, but some snapping also occurs.

The DVD will automatically loop after the 30 minutes. There are several options on the DVD. You can loop: Hi Fire, Medium Fire, or Low Fire...or you can loop the entire fire. I prefer the option of looping the entire fire. I love to put this on after a stressful day when I don't even feel like watching TV.

I disagree with the folks who remarked on the soundtrack problems, and with the ones who have a problem with the transition between loops.  This is a beautiful fire, peaceful, and I love being able to have the fire burn from full to nearly out and then starting over again.  Yes there is a small pause when it loops between nearly depleated fire back to the full burn, and towards the end the sound track is a bit glitchy, but nothing to write home about as far as I'm concerned.

Amazing how the mind plays tricks on you.  I swear I smell smoke, and I definitely have warmed up since putting this video on.  By the way, if you want music with this, there are some pretty good free Radio stations online.  I'm streaming a beautiful jazz channel through my laptop while I just sit in the dark and watch this amazing fire.  It's a 5 star in my book.

3666814,5,B001KNAI2Q,"I looked for a long time for a fireplace DVD.  I wanted: Real wood, no gas, real sounds of a fire going, no music.  And that's just what I got.  If you've spent any time at all looking at all the fireplace dvds on Amazon, you'll see tons of them... to me it was getting overwhelming.  I finally settled on this one because it met all my criteria.  I didn't want the music because I wanted the real fireplace feeling.

I like that this DVD gives you 4 options on the main menu: Large fire, Med fire, small fire and then a fourth option of all three together.  #4 is my favorite.  I like watching the logs burn down to nothing and shift position as they burn apart.  That's what a real fire is supposed to look like IMO.

I found the picture quality to be excellent.  I have a 42"" screen and it fills it perfectly... the description says the DVD is fullscreen but that it fits any tv and it really does.

The sound quality was perfect to me too... it's what a natural fire would sound like, because it is real, so I had no problem with the sound.

Someone said something about the flames are cropped off at the top of the screen on the large fire... and I can see what they mean by that, but it did not bother me at all.  Everyone is different and some are going to nitpick just about all these kinds of dvds apart, so just decide what you want in a fireplace dvd and give that one a chance.  The majority of the reviews are very positive on this one and there's a reason why... this is a fine DVD and I'm very pleased with my purchase.

It became the joke of the night! Ping pong is exactly what it sounds like. The fire is pretty cool except for the skipping when it loops.

This is the first home I have had that did not have a fireplace and I miss one terribly in the winter.  I would say a camera was placed in front of a fireplace and recorded.  It looks exactly like fire burning in a fireplace to the degree I almost can feel the heat.  I always play it on the complete cycle.  I love the crackling sound of burning logs.  I have to turn the sound fairly low on my TV otherwise it is just too loud.  I do not hear the other sounds that other reviewers say they hear.  Mine is just the sound of wood burning. At the end, I find myself waiting for the burned off log to fall.  There is a pause for when it cycles back to the full flame, but after all. it is a new fire.  Not a problem for me.

3666830,3,B001KNAI2Q,"I carefully looked at quite a few of the reviews for this product before deciding to give it a shot.  I figured, what's a little skipping, what's a little too much orange, and can the hissing noise actually be that bad?

I am an Eagle Scout, and have had quite a bit of experience with real fires.  This dvd is acceptable, but not outstanding.

Yes, the sound does skip quite a lot at the end of the ""low"" fire loop.  It's very noticeable.  If you are just playing this fire as a background effect for other activities, it should not be too detrimental.

The entire screen is a bit more on the orange side than a normal fire, but it is not terrible.  It may have been a deliberate tint effect applied by the producers.  The purpose would have been to give a warm glow to the screen, specifically when playing in low light.  I don't feel that it is too distracting.

In addition to the crackling and popping of the wood, several reviewers complained about a hissing, static, or ambient noise.  Part of this is due to the nature of the product.  All fires naturally produce a hissing/roaring noise.  I say hissing/roaring because the comforting sound of a fire burning brightly is actually being reproduced faithfully by the dvd.  The only difference between real fires and this dvd is that the microphone is unable to translate the full effect into what our ears are used to hearing.  Thus, it will merely sound like an annoying hissing.  Once you tell your ears to adjust, and listen for the roaring sound, the hissing magically fades away.  It's just a trick of the perception.

The framing of the fire on the dvd is good.  However, on my 15 and 13-inch laptop screens, and my 21-inch external monitor, the anamorphic display had to settle for small black bars at the top and bottom of the screen, rather than the promised full screen fire.  I assume this is due to the different aspect ratio for a computer screen compared to a tv.

All in all, this is certainly an acceptable product.  I would never pay over $20 for it.  But it does a decent job of bringing a fire to your screen.  Just make sure you listen for the roaring fire, instead of a hissing noise.",1289433600,6,2161,4.451530612244898

3666834,4,B001KNAI2Q,"This real wood fire is perfectly framed, showing a handsome brick fireplace interior behind the fire, and just a little at the sides of the logs.  In many ways, this appears to be the best production of a fireplace DVD, including lighting and other techniques.

The fire appears to be gas-assisted.  At the start, the flames are large, even under the grate, where there appears to be no fuel.  It appears that new logs have been stacked up, the gas fire started, and recording started soon thereafter.  Other reviewers have commented on the loudness of the pops at the beginning.  They sound metallic, and may be the cold grate expanding with the heat.  As the wood burns, the gas is turned down for a natural effect, and the sounds become more natural.  The great framing was created by almost doubling the length of wood used, with two logs in front - unusual until you get used to it.

As others have noted, you have the choice of looping through the whole fire, or the first, second or third parts of it (10 minutes each).  When you start the DVD, the menu comes right up, you make your selection, and the loop starts.  There are a few glitches in the sound, mostly at the end of the third segment, and the transitition at the end is rough.  Viewing only the middle segment omits the distracting sound glitches, and the transition from end-mid to begin-mid is less startling.

The fire burns without interruption behind a screen.  On my 46-inch Samsung LCD, I can see thin, horizontal rectangles of what appear to be fine wire, perhaps embedded in glass, especially in large flame areas.  The vertical lines are occasionally distracting.  There are no options for music or other distractions.

What makes a good fire?  Is it just a feeling, or can you describe it?  Does the fire on a fireplace DVD have to be a pure wood fire?  How much of a production should be made of it?

We can probably agree that most fires, even with the same wood pile and fireplace, are going to be different.  As such, having more than one fireplace DVD can make sense.  On special occasions, we have gone to a B&B, just to have an evening together by the fire.  You can buy a handful of DVDs for far less than one night at a B&B, and have your fire at home.  Unlike a movie DVD, you may use it often.

We gave the Yule Log as a Christmas present, but watched it first.  That prompted my wife to buy this product.  I was bothered by the sound glitches and artificiality I mentioned above - after investigating, I bought the other two.

3666835,5,B001KNAI2Q,"I bought this DVD to mask background noise in my city apartment and lend a relaxing ambiance. It succeeds on both accounts. The DVD has three modes; you can cycle through the fire when it is burning moderately, when it is more subdued, or my preference, get the whole cycle (from bright to subdued). It will cycle through indefinitely more or less seamlessly. It isn't exactly like a real fire but filming a fire has to be a real challenge so I am reasonably satisfied.

The sound of the fire could be better and there is a slight hiss in the background. I would have preferred more popping and lapping tongues of fire noises. But overall it is adequate. I am probably more sensitive to hissing and buzzing than most people so it probably won't be a problem for most.

But if the hissing bothers you I suggest playing the DVD simultaneously with an MP3 thunderstorm soundtrack.

I play the DVD while adding the thunderstorm with iTunes. It works great and will give you hours of pleasant ambient sound. Makes for a great night of reading.",1267574400,3,1038,4.56989247311828

3666853,3,B001KNAI2Q,"I've never had a fireplace DVD before, so my only reference base was a day long burning fire that's broadcast on a local cable channel on Christmas day.  I guess I was spoiled by that, because the cable version was better than this DVD, but... I still like to play it.

I'll tell you my complaints first:

1. The sound takes some getting used to.  The popping wood echos pretty loudly and gives you the impression the fire is burning in an empty room with hard surfaces (not exactly a cozy feeling).

2. The looping is jarring.  There are four choices in the menu, a high fire, a medium fire, a low fire, and the full fire (from hi to low).  Of the first three choices, the fire loops every ten minutes, but the loop is noticeable.  The frame freezes for a few seconds, the sound stops, and then it starts over again.  I've made smoother transitions in my amateur home videos, so not sure why they did it this way. Would be better if you didn't notice the loop at all.  The fourth option, the full fire, is even worse.  It plays for a full 30 minutes, but towards the end of the low fire the sound starts to skip a little.  Then the screen goes to black for quite a few seconds (and is silent) before starting again with the high fire. Again, very jarring.  I almost fell asleep, but this woke me up. Seems they could have made this less noticeable.

3. You feel the urge to stir! During the low fire part, a log (or a piece of a log) falls out of the firebox and no one puts it back!  It really drives home the point this fire is not real because you're dying to jump up and put it back!!  (this is another thing I liked so much about the cable version - a guy would come by every so often, stir the fire, add more wood, so it was tended to and you therefore didn't worry about that.

But... in spite of my complaints, I have to admit I still watch the thing and I do find it relaxing, once I got used to the idiosyncrasies. The colors are warm and glowing.  The fire is kind of hypnotic to watch. Your brain even tricks you into thinking it's giving off heat! And it is framed just exactly right, so that it fills up your TV screen as though that were the firebox itself. No annoying music, just the sounds of popping wood and the updraft.

For ten bucks I guess it was a decent buy. If I had paid more I would probably be less accommodating. But if you simply want a basic, no frills fire to watch, this will do the job.",1260662400,87,2423,4.117021276595745
3666854,1,B001KNAI2Q,"I don't write reviews as much as I'd like to or should, but this item has me so fired up that I feel the urgent need to post my thoughts before another minute passes. PlasmaCandy and their Fireplace DVD duped me into buying their DVD with their fancy boxart and glowing product description. I have been on the hunt for a DVD featuring a soothing, crackling burning fire for years. Most appeared cheesy or were noted as featuring silly backdrops and goofy music. So to find this DVD which is noted as being ultra high quality, featuring a burning fire, and only a burning fire, had my interest peaked. As did, of course, the many five/four star reviews. I honestly feel as though I bought the item from a street vendor selling a copy filmed via a cheap video camera with a shoddy microphone.

The quality of the image isn't stunning by far, but given that it's being upscaled to 720p, I can't fault it for not looking superb - though it could definitely look better. I can get over the state of what's displayed, I must note. What I can't get over, however, is the ridiculously poor audio. The roar of the fire is muffled so heavily, that to ""effectively"" hear it, one needs to raise the volume to an excessive degree. Yet, this poses another problem. Raising the volume couples together the poor roar with a high pitched whine of sorts (imagine turning up cheap speakers as high as they'll go, with nothing playing from them). My speakers aren't cheap, so I can't fault them (though, they certainly aren't the best either, I might add). While this sad sounding roar isn't something I could get over, the worst part is actually the snap, crackle, and pop of the fire - something I was really looking forward to hearing and enjoying. Wow. This DVD's title is, ""Real Wood Burning Fire,"" but I have no reason to believe these sounds to be coming from a real wood burning fire. The crackling is so distracting, so completely jarring that I cannot enjoy the DVD at any volume level. Each pop, each snap, each crackle is so loud and so generic sounding that I cringe with each. I could mute the DVD, sure, but that would take away what I wanted most from this DVD - a gimmick-less real wood burning fire, both in terms of sight and sound. There is even an audible defect heard within seconds of the DVD's start. It also sounds like there are people in the background walking around - a rustling noise if you will. I just don't get it. Did they film this in mono? Or with just a really, really bad microphone?

How hard can it really be to accurately duplicate a real fire? As someone that has built, maintained, and enjoyed wood burning fires for years, I expected so much more. Not necessarily the exact same experience of course, but certainly something close or even remotely related. This DVD is so pathetic in quality, that I do not want it in my collection. And since I cannot return it given what kind of item it is, I'll be giving it away to anyone unlucky enough to take it. Perhaps I'm just too picky, but in this case, I think I have just cause to be wholeheartedly disappointed. Thanks, PlasmaCandy, for sending my hopes of a real wood burning fire to enjoy on my TV during the holidays and beyond up in flames.",1259625600,15,3216,4.458404074702886
3666855,5,B001KNAI2Q,"I'm going to go out on a limb and say this is David Lynch's best film. Sure, ""Wild At Heart,"" has those great close-ups of freshly struck matches and cigarettes being sucked on like torches overgreased by insecure cavemen; the Mystery Man in ""Lost Highway"" lives in a shack on fire; and all the cool, sadistic scenes in ""Blue Velvet"" are preceded by cute, little, cuddly flames. And in ""Freeway Walk With Me,"" there were all those cars blowing up in the merge lanes. But here we have the holy, unforgiving, almighty FLAME: ""Real Wood Burning Fire"" is nothing but flame right in your face. ""Flame on,"" as the pretty boy from ""Fantastic Four"" would say.

RWBF truly is a bold statement on the End-Times in which we live; how we in America consume, consume in an unsatisfied Rage. It's also Lynch's most spontaneous and improvised work to date, even more so than his meat paintings.

In conclusion, let's just let Mr. Eraserhead speak for himself (from an interview posted on [...]): ""I love building fires in a fireplace. It's startling what a unique texture it is. Fire is almost ethereal. There are so many things it causes to happen inside you when you're watching a fire. I think for human beings, always, when you get down to the pure things that exist, like lightning and fire and rock, each one holds so much. It's just closer to the source or something. Wood is beautiful stuff. I could talk a long time about wood.""

I have a more than a few different fireplace DVD's and the write up on this seemed very promising.  I bought this for a 42 inch Plasma.  My first problem was that the color tones are WAY too red/orange.  I tried every adjustment on my TV and it was either red or washed out.  I could not get it to look natural at all.  My second issue was that there is a constant odd eliptical illumination in the background.  It looks as though there is a spotlight on it all time, not the natural glow that would be naturally given from a fire.  Also, the logs and fire were sort of hazy and did not look nearly as crisp and realistic as some other videos.  I actually play this on a TV that's nestled in a real hearth and behind a stained glass firescreen (safer than a real fire when you have little tots!) and it was so bad that I couldn't even play it partially hidden behind the glass.  The only good part of this DVD was the audio of the fire and the ability to play the fire at different levels or the whole cycle of the fire.

3666867,5,B001KNAI2Q,"As others have said this is my third fireplace. First I had a VHS. It had a bout 6 seconds that looped and it was a gas fireplace....big disappointment, showed an ugly mantle. Second was a Holiday DVD with really bad sountrack of Christmas carols and about a 10 min loop of same fire...gas again.

Plasma Candy got it RIGHT! This is a real wood fireplace. No mantle, no music, just the sounds of flames the sound of updrafts and pops and crackles. The wood turns to ash and breaks off. One log falls forward and it's so real I thought it was going to hit my floor.
I am totally enchanted by this DVD it is so real and relaxing.

I was sure it was going to be good due to 2 things. I have the Aquarium by Plasma candy and it is also wonderful and the good reviews of folks who have went the route I had trying to have a realistic fireplace to relax by when you infact do not have one.

I highly recommend this. If you want music you can have whatever you want you are not stuck with the same tune each time you have it on.",1253232000,3,1021,4.019704433497537

3666869,5,B001KNAI2Q,"I bought two different fireplace DVD's and this one was far, FAR superior to the log cabin one. This shows the fire as it swells to a roar and then simmers down again. I feel refreshed, warmed and comforted after seeing it.

I am buying more of ""The Fireplace DVD's"" for gifts that I KNOW my family and friends will enjoy. Now, I don't feel the need for the portable fireplace I almost bought for $200.00!",1251504000,,405,4.328947368421052
3666870,5,B001KNAI2Q,"I had been searching for a good ""background DVD"" for parties for years and years.  Everything I came across seemed to be hokey, cheesy, or just plain corny ... and then I found the fireplace DVD.  Based on reviews by other customers, I decided to give it a chance and I was NOT disappointed.

The DVD is very low-key, non-intrusive, and classy.  I put it on as background when I have friends over for wine, or whenever its a cold winter day and I feel like having a ""fire"" as I read.

The cinematography is subtle, and (thankfully) doesn't show a corny fireplace surround, rather just the hearth and the flames.  Viewer has the option to start the fire at any phase (middle is ""roaring"" to end ""glowing embers"") OR just loop through the entire thing and enjoy a relaxing evening.",1240012800,,779,4.48936170212766
3666871,5,B001KNAI2Q,"I suppose it could be like some of the other fireplace DVDs out there that have different hearths you can choose and different music and all that...but after doing some research, I chose this one.  I'm so glad I did.  At first, I was a little bummed because I was thinking, ""Those other features might have been really cool..."" but after watching this one, I'm glad I bought this dvd and not one of the others.

The fire starts out freshly ablaze, popping and crackling.  There were no annoying bars on the top and bottom of the screen.  It filled our widescreen, plasma TV with a fire that eventually dwindled down to small lickings of flame and ash.  Then, it looped back to the fresh blaze again.  It's not quite HD crystal-clear, but it's good enough.  The camera is steady the whole time.  No crazy panning or close-ups.  Just a steady, roaring fire that fades like a real fire would.

This one is definitely good for those who want the most realistic option available over the ones with hearths, music, and where the camera does close-ups and pans.  While all that seems neat, it just becomes cheesy on the actual screen.  This brings the bonfire feel to our living room.  I also have a husband who likes to turn the TV on and then walk around the house doing other things for inexplicable reasons.  If the TV has to be on, I like just putting this on and looping it.  Then, he has his background noise and I have some tranquility.  Perfect for turning on at night, curling up with a good book and foregoing the depressing evening news.",1239148800,,1542,4.469534050179211

3666873,5,B001KNAI2Q,"This is an actual woodburning fireplace, as advertised. The options for looping are: whole fire, high, medium and low, complete with natural sounds. My favorite is looping the medium. On the high, the screen isn't quite big enough to accommodate the top of the flames i.e. there was a misjudgment in the way it was filmed. I put this on with a candle that smells of ""woodburning fireplace."" Ambience without the work!!",1235692800,,418,4.819444444444445
