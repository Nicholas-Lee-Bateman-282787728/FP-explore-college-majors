2906941,5,B000TM1CKG,"This is a great kids movie. The old care bears are back, but looking
modern and vibrant. The premise is that Grizzle the bad bear is trying
to steal the bears 'Belly Badges'. The story revolves around Oopsy Does
It, a care bear that has no belly badge because he is so clumsy. He
draws his feelings on his blank belly. My kid loved the movie and is a
big fan of the resurgent care bears. The Grizzle scenes are a little
scary, but not too bad. I had to explain that he is a bear who is
lonely and wants friends. There is a huge care bear amusement park that
the bears are building that my kid loves. They do a great job of taking
you on the ride with the bears. It looks great on a big screen TV. I
give it a 10. It is very well drawn...do we even say that? Very well
CGI'd",1202601600,,773,3.8987341772151898
2906942,5,B000TM1CKG,"I got this for my 4 year old daughter, who has every care bear EVER made big or little...I was glad to see that they updated the C.B. and remade the villian..not so scary as ColdHeart. I just need for then to produce more of the new bears..she wants them for Christmas..we have to settle on taping them on Saturdays on CBS. I love the new look..and the movie is too cute too...",1196294400,,377,4.178082191780822
2906943,4,B000TM1CKG,"I bought this for my daughter who is 3 years old and really likes the Care Bears. For reference, she now has 9 Care Bears of various sizes. Anyway, she really likes the parts of this movie that aren't scary, but I end up fast forwarding through all the scenes with Grizzle, the villain. She really likes Oopsy, the new Care Bear.

The Care Bears are redesigned for this movie, and it is now possible to tell who is a girl or a boy by looking at them, based on their hair. Girls have ribbons and bows, Boys have sloppy hair or hats.

The movie is neither great nor horribly bad. If you really like Care Bears, especially the new CBS show, then it is worth getting. If you are looing for an introduction to the Care Bears, get the original Care Bears movie, the the Care Bears Big Wish movie.",1193961600,8,790,4.225165562913907
2906954,5,B000TM1CKG,"This was the only movie my 6 month old daughter liked when it was streaming on Netflix.  At the end of February 2012, it was removed from Netflix, so I had to buy this DVD for her.  She is now a year old and still loves this movie.  She gets excited when the bad bear Grizzle does his like song and dance routine.  It's a fun movie and is definitely her favorite.  She lights up when she hears the opening song title start to play.",1330819200,,431,4.023529411764706
2906955,5,B000TM1CKG,This is a great movie for kids.  The picture is much better then the old care bear movies.  The only complaint I have is that since I bought it I've had to watch it every single day!!  My 3 year old girl loves it though.,1288742400,2,220,3.8444444444444446
2906956,5,B000TM1CKG,"My three year old loves this movie. We were constantly renting it, and she would cry when we had to return it. Thank you Amazon for carrying movies we can't find in stores!",1285459200,2,172,4.242424242424242
2906957,4,B000TM1CKG,"My daughter's into the Care Bears, so I purchased ""Oopsy Does It"" for her. She absolutely loves it, right down to the songs and all the jokes!! I have to admit it... I like it myself.",1272499200,2,183,4.111111111111111
2906958,5,B000TM1CKG,Great video for her.  She loves Care Bears and this one is in animated 3D.,1271203200,,74,3.933333333333333
2906959,5,B000TM1CKG,"Care Bears are slowly but, surely becoming a standard much in the vein of Aesop, and Sesame Street with a smidgen of Mr. Rogers thrown in for completion. They have stood the test of time and still provide a medium for strong, meaningful, and quality content delivery.

The whole message of the Care Bears calvacade is a bit diverse and thus may be mis-understood as being a bit fragmented or loosely woven. The series addresses diverse issues and cultural beliefs in a methodology that is consumable for developing minds teaching things like: generalized team work, seing the power in being different and how it compliments and strengthens any team, how to turn fantasy into proof of concept, thinking outside the box safely exploring alternative choices,  and applying what you learn addressing real world situations.

I would recommend this article/book as a great ice breaker for the parent, to include grand parents as well as aunts and uncles, when wanting to engage in your child's life commanding a bit more social excellence in their development. It takes a community to raise a child right because that child is going to be a constituent in the society that he/she engages; we've noone to blame but, ourselves for the ways that society travels now. It is our responsibility solely to insure that the child of tomorrow not only knows and understands right opposed to wrong but, also how to enlighten the generation springing forth from them else, we have failed.

Sesame Street, The Electric Company, Romper Room, The Care Bears, Mr. Roger's Neighborhood -- all are good in my book.

I learned how to read on my own as a toddler watching the Emergency Broadcast Systems alerts on T.V. back in the seventies at the age of three. I know what I'm talking about -- get them started down the right paths in life ASAP don't wait -- you'll regret missing the opportunity. The first word I learned to read was ""this."" Studying programming and the use of ""this"" I found the word to be pretty powerful as it pertains to self-registration or identity. The concept of the word ""this"" brings us right back on being a proper individual so that society -- the team, can benefit as a whole from our efforts.

The use of pictures/color graphical illustrations in alot of, if not all, the toddler series is quite stimulating and the animated cartoons and sci-fi stuff all the same. The age of three was very good to me as my father still retains a picture that I drew at that age of a rainbow trout from the cover of Field and Stream with a ball point pen. Get them involved with the humanities but, don't push. Provide them with an onslaught of cheap but, meaningful alternatives/choices then spend the bank on the items that inspire them through their process of natural selection. So, children of any age are accued graphically and the visual is a way to approach them at their core complimented heavily by the audible.

It is not about being a genius or intelligence it is about opportunity and inspiration as learning will just happen. My parents were kind of hippy and did not believe in making up the kids mind just making sure they were in bed when thay were supposed to be, fed, and safe. Compliment the opportunities that inspire your child to act and you will be remembered in a positive light forever -- in this you achieve immortality for the right reasons with deeper meaning and gratus.

In closing, the Care Bears teach a young person about empathy but, often overlooked is the total teachings of the series as inclusive of all things I've touched base upon above. These types of documents are foundary to the institution of development and learning only making us a stronger race of humans.

The Great Race -- the Human Race. It isn't about ethnicity, is it?

The sooner that we start filling their minds with right, the less time and room there will be for the wrong. We must eliminate the obscure that leads us to mis-interpretation and inpropriety. The Care Bears are ready to be armed in your attack on ignorance and ""this"" is the time to engage.

Take care.",1252800000,,4069,4.700842696629214
2906960,5,B000TM1CKG,"The kids loved this video.  Of course, who doesn't love these bears.  It was easy to pick up at a specific scene when not watching the whole thing in one sitting.",1242604800,2,162,4.193548387096774
2906961,5,B000TM1CKG,"I loved Care Bears as a child and it's nice to see both my son and daughter getting into them.  This DVD is the best one available fr Care Bears - because it features new digital animation rather than the old cartoon-style.  But, nothing is lost in terms of the Bears' features.  The kids and all their cousings love this movie - age range 2 to 9 !!!  (Shhh - don't tell the 9-year-old's friends!)  The colors and graphics really take the cake.  Plus the storyline isn't too cheesy but actually it is rather suspenseful.  I'm buying more copies along with the Oopsy book for their friends' birthday gifts.  I think they'll really enjoy it.",1220313600,,639,4.495652173913044

8210156,3,B000TM1CKG,The movie is good but when I got it the circle in the middle that holds the DVD was broken so the DVD was inside moving around and got scratched so half way through the movie I have to skip a chapter  I never sent it back because my autistic 3 yr old is obsessed with this particular care bears movie and watches it like 5x a day more if I'd let him.  So I could never pry it out of his memory to send it back or wait for a new one. Oh well,1333238400,,440,3.6210526315789475
