4134969,4,B003L20ILA,"Robert Duvall is one of the best American actors of the past half century.  Witness his roles in To Kill a Mockingbird, The Godfather I and II, The Great Santini, Apocalypse Now, Open Range, and a full TV resume including Lonesome Dove.  In Get Low, he gives a measured, understated performance as a mysterious, old hermit who makes an unusual, life changing decision.  This independent film is deceptively simple and honest.  Yet it is done extremely well and leaves a deep feeling about life's regrets.

After the brief image of a house burning down, we flash forward to a rural setting in the 1930's to see an old home inhabited by a reclusive, elderly man, Felix Bush (Duvall), whose disheveled appearance and reputation are the stuff of rumor and legend.  Are the stories about him true?  Is he a killer?  Haunted by visions of a woman, he decides to arrange his own funeral before his actual demise.  The funeral home is run by Frank Quinn (Bill Murray) and his loyal assistant, Buddy Robinson (Lucas Black).  Felix wants to invite everyone who has a story about him to tell.  He sweetens the pot by offering to raffle off his vast acreage of property.  He also runs into an old acquaintance, Mattie (Sissy Spacek), who has strong ties to him from way back.  He later pays a visit to a preacher in another town in hopes of having him conduct the eulogy.  As the plot thickens, we find that Felix is hiding a painful secret that will have the town reexamining its prejudices and assumptions about a tortured soul who is struggling for his own redemption before it's too late.

Novice director Aaron Schneider, whose previous credits were as a cinematographer of various TV shows and movies, does a solid job with a modest budget and a lean story and script by Chris Provenzano and C. Gaby Mitchell.

It's nice to see veteran actors like Duvall, Spacek, and Murray play older characters, wrinkles and all with enthusiasm and conviction.  Duvall does a splendid job of presenting a cipher of a man whose words are sparse and direct and slowly, as the story develops, begins to open up to reveal a complex person replete with feelings of guilt.  There are reasons perhaps for why he is the way he is.  Duvall is destined for an Oscar nomination, and Spacek arguably deserves a nod for strong support.  Bill Murray as the funeral director does a convincing job as a businessman who isn't quite a villain or hero.  He is carving a nice career niche as a dramatic character actor (aside from being a comedic superstar).

The film successfully evokes the period of depression era, small town USA.  There are few items to quibble about; however, a violent break in at the funeral home doesn't really forward the plot and is never fully explained.

There are similarities in Felix and the noble character in The Ballad of Cable Hogue.  In both films, the protagonist is an aged, stubborn loner, and in the end, as his life is in its twilight, the truth sets him free.  Perhaps the lesson here is that each person has a story, and some of the stories are not always evident.  With Get Low, we get to see the bittersweet tale of a broken heart.  Your heart will be moved too.",1284768000,9,3169,4.610714285714286
4134970,5,B003L20ILA,"""Get Low"" takes place in the thirties and is about Felix who lives in the Tennessee woods for forty years as a foul-tempered recluse having little to do with the local townspeople. The old bearded coot is played by Robert Duvall who does a great but effortless-seeming acting job. He has a guilty secret which has driven him into seclusion. When an old acquaintance dies, he decides to have a funeral, but he decides he wants it to be a party, and he wants people to tell stories about him, and he wants to be there while he's still alive. Felix infrequently comes into town with his old mule. It's fun looking at the old thirties cars and the period hearse.
It's only later as the movie moves along that you realize this is really a mystery movie. One of the first clues comes when an old flame Sissy Spacek runs out on Felix after seeing a photograph on his wall. As a viewer you wonder what gets her so agitated. What Felix wants is one particular friend, an Afro-American minister (played by Billy Cobbs) to tell what he knows about him. Not that Felix built a beautiful church for the minister but what he confessed to him.
As the funeral director, Bill Murray is very winning playing the part of a man who is funny, sly, maybe a bit of a crook. He is only too happy to get paid for the strange funeral party because his business is tanking, not like his former home in Chicago where people were regularly getting bumped off.
It's actually a tour de force role for Duvall, but movie acting has gotten so deeply ingrained in him that he can make it seem organic. The movie is about peeling away layers of humanity in each character, and we slowly see them evolve into better people that we can admire.
It's a piece of magic storytelling which moves at a stately pace, a measured pace, but you don't get bored and you don't want it rushed because it is inevitably going to be revelatory, and Felix's secret is going to be eased out.
Basically it's a very simple story concerning a man who does not want to go to his grave with a guilty conscience.
Murray's young assistant, the deus ex machina, the catalyst, for a lot that happens in the story, is well-played by good-looking young Lucas Black. It's a movie of subtlety, humor, and deep human emotion, but I do have a lot of trouble remembering what I think is a lousy title.",1283558400,68,2329,4.406032482598608
4134971,5,B003L20ILA,"Robert Duvall should have been in contention for an oscar with his complicated portrayal of Felix Bush, a 40-year hermit from the mountains of Tennessee. Bill Cobbs' performance was also remarkable as an Illinois preacher. In actuality, all the acting was stellar. Bill Murray was worth his weight in yen as the more-than-happy-to-oblige funeral director. This innovative storyline of Felix's wish for his own funeral service during his lifetime was perfectly-paced to let each character unfurl. And it was just the right length. Both the photography and costuming were stunning and gave the impression that this really was bound by that period in time. Even the currency had a look of authenticity from back in the days of the Great Depression. And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the soundtrack, especially Alison Krauss' splendidly apropos ""Lay My Burden Down"".",1283558400,75,866,5.192857142857143
4134972,3,B003L20ILA,"Surprisingly, surprisingly good.  Ultimately, this story is about repentance and preparing to meet the Creator....

One hesitation which I had was an uncertainty as to whether the wrongness of adultery was being adequately conveyed.",1283040000,8,232,5.794117647058823
4134973,4,B003L20ILA,"Aaron Schneider's ""Get Low"" is a slight, unpretentious film that would blow away in the wind if it weren't anchored by some truly wonderful performances. Based on a true story, ""Get Low"" is set during the Great Depression, in the Appalachian hills of Georgia. Felix Bush (Robert Duvall) an old hermit feared and despised by his neighbors, hires the local funeral director (Bill Murray) to organize a ""funeral party"" so he can hear what the locals have to say about him before he's actually dead. That climactic event proves the occasion for Felix to make a full confession to his neighbors about the horrific event, forty years before, that cost him his reputation and has haunted him ever since.

Frankly, not much happens in ""Get Low"" before that climax, but it's mostly a pleasure to watch, thanks to Schneider's deft, low-key direction and the extremely fine acting, especially by Duvall and Murray. Duvall has made a career specialty of backwoods eccentrics, and his Felix Bush is one of the more memorable of them. The pain in Duvall's eyes blasts away any suggestion of mawkish sentimentality that might be inherent in the film. Murray is equally fine as a man who has more than a little con man in him, but who also has seen enough sorrow in life to spark his essential decency. The earnest Duvall and the roguish Murray play beautifully off each other, as fellow travelers on the Train of Sadness.

Sissy Spacek, as an old flame of Felix's, doesn't have much to do, but it's nice to see her anyway. Bill Cobbs is tartly amusing an a preacher who knows Felix's secret, and Lucas Black is extremely likable as Murray's assistant. ""Get Low"" is a gentle, poignant film, memorable for the acting.",1281830400,197,1700,4.759322033898305
4134974,4,B003L20ILA,"Robert Duvall is called a hermit in this nice slow funny mystery, that could be seen as a Southern Gothic revival attempt if it were not so unassuming. As hermits go, Duvall does a great job and would deserve an Oscar nomination. His Felix Bush character has lived solitary 40 years alone in a cottage in the woods in Tennessee (not so sure about the geography though). The villagers tell stories about him. He is the evil old man who will shoot at children who dare to pester him. Maybe he shoots above their heads. All know that he must have killed somebody in the past.
Bush comes up with the entertaining idea to have himself a funeral party while still alive and he asks Bill Murray, a splendid funeral director, to arrange it. The main attraction will be a lottery: a ticket costs 5 $ and the winner will own Bush's land. After he dies for real, that is.
The main theme then is the unravelling of the man's past: why has he been a hermit? I will not say a thing about it, as this film is not of the kind that you would want to watch it again when you know the ending. Let me just say that his past crimes don't quite seem to justify his radical self-punishment.",1281398400,7,1167,4.261261261261262

Robert Duvall is obviously the star but there are very good supporting roles by an impressive list of actors.  It's uplifting, but bittersweet.  There is some language, but I didn't see anything that I would stop say a 10 year old from watching with me.  It is about life and death... so there is an opportunity for conversation about living your life and about dying.  But honestly, I just loved the story.  I hate reviewing movies because they are sooooo subjective.  To each his own.  I am very happy to own this movie.  I don't watch it every day...hahaha.. but felt it was worth of purchase to view every so often.",1516233600,,758,4.522058823529412

4135034,5,B003L20ILA,"Robert Duvall is the best at presenting a character and making it stick in the viewers mind. This character has so much depth and quirks and deep history, that you will never forget him.  He wants people to think well of him and the town and area have a low opinion of him and don't realize the truth of what happened long ago in his life. He wants to clear that up before he dies and he makes a very definite plan to accomplish his goal. It is heartwarming, hilarious at times, and heart wrenching at others. But you will enjoy all the characters in this story. Well played and well produced. A treasure.  Pure Duvall here.  See Gee",1493942400,3,633,4.302521008403361

There was that season that Rod Serling's original Twilight Zone tried to jump from a half-hour format to a full hour, and jumped the shark instead. Rod and his people were geniuses at taut 30-minute thrillers. At a full hour, there was always a half-hour of useless, repetitive padding and throat-clearing in the middle, stretching things out to the gotcha at the end. Same here. It starts off well, with Duvall as a mysterious old coot with a dark, dark secret he promises eventually to reveal. Then for maybe an hour it wanders in circles, shifts from one foot to the other, clears its throat, twiddles its thumbs. And when they FINALLY get around to revealing his secret, it's a giant let-down. No big deal, nothing you didn't surmise back in the first 15 minutes of the movie.

4135464,5,B003L20ILA,"Get Low

 This is the kind of wonderful low budget art house film that you get to do as an actor if you have had a spectacular career and God loves you.  The producers spent a tiny $7 million on this film, an amount that a huge powerhouse like Iron Man might have spent of sushi for the cast.  Star Robert Duvall has turned in what might be the capstone performance of his long run in Hollywood.
 It was the script and not the cash that attracted Duvall, Bill Murray, Sissy Spacek, Bill Cobb and Lucas Black to the film.  Murray has a strong supporting role as a grasping funeral home owner in depression era Appalachia.  Black, Cobb and Spacek have smaller but very strong supporting roles and fill them right up.  The confident, sophisticated, mature acting in this film is seldom seen these days.
 Director Aaron Schneider is known primarily as a Cinematographer.  He has two other little known feature length films to his credit but this will be the one he becomes known for.  His expertise with the camera is shown in every cut of this finely crafted film.
 The story itself, somehow billed as a comedy when it is in fact a heart wrenching tragedy, is told slowly, carefully and mysteriously.  Duvall is an old man, a hermit in the hills, frightening, distant and alone for some forty years.  He comes to town to arrange for a funeral which Bill Murray agrees to oversee.  Duvall wants to have the funeral party, as he calls it, while he is still alive, which is unconventional even by the standards of the folk in the remote mountain hollows.
 The extended unfolding of the hermits mystery is never hurried and never dull.  We get to the conclusion eventually and I at least was mightily moved to find out why a man would live his whole life in isolation.  It is a heartbreaker.  Duvall is being touted for an Oscar for this role.
 Four strong saw blades for the PG 13 tragedy, Get Low.  It runs one hour and 40 minutes.",1411257600,3,1926,4.461318051575931

wrong Get Low starring Robert Duvall, Sissy Spacek, and Bill Murray was very goodbetter than
most movies today. It has all the ingredients of a superior film: excellent dialogue, some of the best
performances from a stellar cast, and beautiful cinematography. But maybe there was too much
exposition, maybe there was too little interest in a core story event. Whatever the case, the movie fell a
little flat when it started with such effervescence.
That said (and I repeat), its still better than most films out there. Robert Duvall gives one of the best
performances as outcast town hermit Felix Bush. Town folk tell stories about Felix, although none of
them have particularly outlandish stories to tell. Felix wants them to tell all their stories at his funeral
with him present! Bill Murray plays Frank Quinn, the local undertaker who complains about how slowly
people die in this town. Hes approached by Bush to host the funeraland he is more than willing to
oblige.
Sissy Spacek is also wonderfully cast as the Felixs long-lost companion, Mattie, who stirs up the secrets
of Felixs past. But I wasn't so impressed with those secrets as I was in the slowly crafted (maybe at
times too slowly) and wonderfully shot sequences leading up to it. The rest of the cast was all properly
placed, especially Bill Cobbs (one of the busiest and finest character actors in history) as Rev. Charlie
Jackson, who seems to know the secret to Felixs past. The film was directed by Aaron Schneider, a
relatively new director who won an Academy Award for his short film Two Soldiers in 2004.",1408406400,,1678,4.710884353741497

4135594,5,B003L20ILA,"With the presence of Robert Duvall and Bill Murray, I was expecting an enjoyable dark comedy. What I got was a particularly well-written dramatic mystery with comic elements. My initial expectations were immediately changed by the opening scene, a burning house with a man in flames escaping from a second storey window. Forty years later, Felix Bush, ""The Hermit of Caleb County"" (Duvall), approaches the funeral home operator (Murray) about a ""funeral party"", which the hermit proposes to host while he is still alive. But this is no joke, it is a serious request from a man with a dark secret of forty years that he wants to reveal.

The finely crafted script develops the story meticulously, taking such care that one would think time would crawl, but so well told that the time flies by. The supporting cast is superb, with Lucas Black as the assistant at the funeral home, Sissy Spacek as the old flame who remembers the hermit from forty years ago, and Bill Cobbs as the preacher who has known the hermit's secret for all those decades.

Based on an actual incident and shot on location in Georgia, the ambience of the film feels entirely authentic.

The cast is superb and Bill Murray once again exhibits his ""serious acting"" chops. Robert Duvall is, of course, phenomenal.

The movie isn't for everyone and I have friends, acquaintances and family that probably wouldn't like it because there's no nudity, car crashes, or gore and they would probably not be able to stay focused on the tale. However, if you appreciate a good story then this is it.
