8520593,4,B007PSGK7C,"A really powerful and gritty war film, especially for the early time in which it was made.  I don't mind the ""N"" word when used for comradre, which it's used here for...But the amount the white soldiers use it negatively is a bit off-putting.  Still, I guess it's just staying ""true to the time.""  Once the white soldiers see how brave and upfront the black soldiers are, it dies off almost entirely.  I do believe this was the first large-scale attack that negro soldiers were permitted within, and they more than proved their bravery.  The final war sequence will leave you in tears.  Ranks up there with ""Saving Private Ryan.""",1516060800,,629,4.672727272727273
