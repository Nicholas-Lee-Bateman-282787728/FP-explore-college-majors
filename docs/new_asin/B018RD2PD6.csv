8742750,5,B018RD2PD6,"The Families of the World videos are excellent educational tools. In each video, which is thirty minutes long, we follow a day in the life of two children, one from an urban area and one from a rural area. A narrator explains, in English, what the child is doing and explains any cultural points of interest. These videos are great for giving children a brief glimpse into life in another country.

The main drawback to these videos is the cost - most educational videos are a little over-priced. Also, don't expect high production values or anything, and there's nothing flashy, so if your children are being raised by TV, they might find the video not stimulating enough.",1408579200,,673,4.752136752136752
8742751,5,B018RD2PD6,"Our class did a cultural study on Japan. My students - 1st, 2nd and 3rd graders enjoyed it.  As a teacher what I liked is that it showed what life was like for a Japanese kid from their point of view. There is a movie out there has 2 white kids visiting Japan - lame. It shows what life is like in the city and what life is like on a farm. I like the comparison. I do think it is a bit pricy for just a half an hour show. I would have liked to see a bit more since finding quality cultural videos is so difficult.  Otherwise helpful and informative and totally kid friendly.",1343001600,,574,3.939655172413793
