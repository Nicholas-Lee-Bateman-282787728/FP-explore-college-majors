8217576,4,B000V9KF7I,"This biopic was based partially on Phyllis Gates' book and on Marc Christian's story, so it is told from their point of view. It is a fairly well-balanced portrait of Rock Hudson, although the actor portraying Hudson does not resemble him at all. Still he does a credible job, along with the other cast members.
If you read Hudson biographies, there is still some conflict about Marc Christian and whether or not he deserved to win his case against the Hudson estate. This movie does a good job supporting his side of the story.",1217030400,3,528,4.627659574468085

I don't think he was as sad as the movie reveals, but still we love Rock Hudson until the end of times, and I would like to perpetuate his personality as one with a good sense of humor, always smiling and cracking jokes!",1198022400,7,298,4.155172413793103
