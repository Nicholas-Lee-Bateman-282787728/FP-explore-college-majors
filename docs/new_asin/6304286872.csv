829312,3,6304286872,"This film version of the hit Broadway comedy came out when producers were trying to lure the public away from television and into the theaters. CinemaScope, Cinerama, 3-D, and other novelties were introduced. ""Top Banana"" offered its own new twist: it was an exact replica of a Broadway play at moviehouse prices. So the film is deliberately stagey, with veteran film director Alfred E. Green at the helm. Phil Silvers is virtually the whole show, as a self-centered TV comedian who depends on his beleaguered writers and stooges -- to keep his ""real life"" patter charming and amusing, and to keep his hectic schedule on track. Silvers's patented machine-gun delivery is hilarious (watch for a burlesque scene where he wears a ridiculous toupee and serenades a group of bored chorus girls). There are some clever songs (with Johnny Mercer lyrics), and strong support from Rose Marie, Jack Albertson,  and burlesque veterans Joey Faye and Herbie Faye (no relation). (Herbie and Phil went way back, and Herbie was featured in the ""Bilko"" TV series).  The movie was filmed in an inexpensive but effective color process; the video edition is missing a little footage (the old black-and-white TV prints ran a little longer) but it shouldn't matter much.  The technical quality is very good. A good show for Broadway buffs and especially for Phil Silvers fans.",1032480000,22,1354,5.035714285714286
829313,4,6304286872,"It is rare for a film to preserve a hit Broadway musical intact.  Moreover, it is even more rare for them to do it with the entire Broadway cast.  Not only has this been done with Top Banana (although some would argue that there are more deserving shows)it has been done as a record of the actual stage performance because it was filmed in the actual theatre (the Winter Garden where Cats had its record-breaking run) in front of an audience.  We are so fortunate to have this record of one of Phil Silver's greatest triumphs (he won a Tony award for it).  He is nothing but brilliant in his ability to make us laugh.  We also now have a reliable record of classic Vaudeville performances by the people who made the routines famous.  As icing on the cake there is lovely Rose Marie in her pre Dick Van Dyke Show days singing some great Mercer music.  The only problem I find with the transfer is that it is not letterboxed which causes some unfortunate panning and scanning choices.....perhaps if the DVD comes out that will not be an issue.  Have fun....watch....laugh....enjoy..and remember the masters.",988588800,9,1105,4.630769230769231

I grew up watching Phil Silvers as Sargent Bilko, and I adored him and his amazing talent. Years ago, I worked with a gentleman who did this show, and he told me glowing stories about working with these old professionals. I'll go with the version that puts a smile on my face!

829495,5,6304286872,"I think I saw the original telecast of this in the 50s when I was a child.  I didn't like it.  I only remembered 2 things from it.  The title song and the scene where they're climbing into the house - but not the hilarious gymnastic bit, and the house looked different.  Watching it yesterday, again I disliked it until it was partway in.  I thought the songs (except the lyrics) were unprofessionally bad.  But NY has put up with Sondheim's tunes for 50 years.  The acrobatic bit at the house was great.  Which reminds me, like that bit, everything in the show was performed to perfection.  I also liked the bawdy burlesque looking back number.  Especially the girl with the twirler and Phil Silvers' reactions and facial expressions.  That proved that Silvers has soft and subtle side, not all fast and loud.  It was odd to me, that they included all the blatant sex bits in this flick, but changed ""hell"" to ""heck"" in a song in ""Conn Yankee"".  Both done on TV in (I think) the 50s.  About 1/2 the songs were left out (the OBC is on CD).  There were several strange cuts from the middle of one scene to another.  Was this intended?  It was in color.  Picture and sound were fine.  The highlights of the show to me were the old vaudeville routines.  I'm glad I watched it.",1421452800,2,1273,4.381974248927039

829602,3,6304286872,"Phil Silvers (Sgt. Bilko of the 50's TV classic ""Phil Silvers Show"") stars in this parody of ""Uncle Milty"" (early television's first comedy superstar Milton Berle.) Very funny film shot in 3D and color, though the the 3D footage has been lost. Apparently, so has much of the 2D movie also, leaving out a key scene where Silvers and his entire cast have been fired by his show's sponsor, in favor of his tenor vocalist. That makes the story a bit hard to follow, especially in the last half. Co-star Rose Marie (The Dick Van Dyke Show in early 60's) is funny, but she doesn't get enough lines. Enjoyable song & dance sequences, but some of the arrangements on the Johnny Mercer tunes are square.
Packaging is TERRIBLE, and the DVD may not perform on some players, though it worked fine in my disc player and PC. Film print is fair-some scratch lines and of course incomplete, but decent color.",1389916800,2,892,4.58125
829603,5,6304286872,This is one of the oddest movies ever made.  It is simply a filmed version of the stage comedy Top Banana.  And I mean a filmed version of the stage play.  They simply do the comedy ON A STAGE for the camera.  I've never seen anything like it. And the film quality is very poor.  However it's better than nothing because this is the show that launched Phil Slivers and it's nice to have.,1377043200,,387,4.175675675675675

829605,3,6304286872,"By my objective standards, Top Banana is mostly a tiresome, almost embarrassing production, even though the stage version ran on Broadway for almost a year in the early 1950s and netted star Phil Silvers a Tony. That was, however, the only award that the show garnered, I believe, and one go round with this disc is perhaps enough to understand why. The best portions are the interactions of Silvers with supporting actors Jack Albertson, Rose Marie, Herbie Faye and Joey Faye, with the Top Banana song skit the best of the better. And, amid all this, Silvers himself makes the show, period. I did find interesting the fact that a couple of the lines from Top Banana -- ""Eat your heart out"" and ""Look alive, look alive"" turn up later as continuing catch phrases in Silvers' Sgt. Bilko series. For Silvers lovers, this professional milestone is a must. It may also be of interest to those interested in why Burlesque went away. Fun in some places, but a tough slog in others.",1368835200,2,974,4.6686046511627906

829607,2,6304286872,"In 1952, the Broadway musical ""Top Banana"" would win a Tony Award for comedian Phil Silvers.  The comedy parody musical by Paula Stone and Mike Sloane which was thought to be modeled after Milton Berle would feature music and lyrics by Johnny Mercer and inspire a book by Hy Kraft.

With the popularity of the Broadway musical, in 1954, United Artists hoped to cash in by creating a movie version featuring the original cast and with technology at the time, to shoot ""Top Banana"" in 3D but also release it in a normal version as well.

MOD PLAYABILITY:

Part of the worry of viewers who had bad experiences with MOD DVD's are the printing quality. There are some who can't get them to play and are literally now just coasters.

With ""Top Banana"", its printed quite well with printing on top of the DVD, it's not a plain silver disc with letters. If you didn't know it was MOD, you would think it was an actual DVD release.

As for playability, I played it on my Sony PlayStation 3 with no problems. I then played it on my Mac, no problems whatsoever. .

VIDEO AND AUDIO:

As far as picture quality goes, the film has been manufactured using the best source available.  ""Top Banana"" actually looks very good for a film that is over 55-years-old.  But it's not pristine.  It's important to remind viewers that this is a low-budget film.  Nothing shot on location but on a Los Angeles stage requiring not much in terms of production.  The film has the style of other films shot in Eastmancolor, colors are still good, mild flickering and white speckles can be seen but for the most part, picture quality is still very good and the film has its fair share of grain.

It's important to note that the original elements (primarily the 3-D version of the film) is lost an the original stereoscopic form (the lab that processed the film went out of business a year later) and the only material that exists is a 16mm print of one side and this is the version that is featured in this DVD release.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

MOD's or Video on Demand DVD's most often don't carry special features.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Top Banana"" is an interesting film as it is primarily a highlight for Phil Silvers and also showcased the fears that Broadway had towards television but most importantly, its a Broadway play that is adapted into a film.

Everything is shot indoor, nothing shot outdoor, if anything, the film is literally bringing the popular Broadway musical to a larger audience through film and reaching out to the masses who can't attend the Broadway musical.  It was literally shot at a Los Angeles theater and not spending too much in movie production.

Unfortunately, I have not seen the Broadway musical but reading reviews of those who are familiar with the original claim the film version fails because chunks of the storyline that were shown in the Broadway musical is lost.  In fact, I felt lost in the storyline and had to rewind quite often to see if I missed something in the story. So, a lot of the music from the musical is not on this film.

So, while the musical numbers are quite interesting to watch and Phil Silvers did a magnificent job, I felt that the storyline with Sally and Cliff went nowhere.  If anything, the scenes with Biffle and the comedy numbers were possibly the most effective moments of the entire film.

I could imagine that those who loved Phil ""The King of Chutzpah"" Silvers and his comedy would love this film.  In fact, after this film was released, he would literally become a household name appearing on the military comedy, ""You'll Never Get Rich"" which would eventually become ""The Phil Silvers Show"".  He does show off his brilliance as a comic actor in the film and if anything, he's probably the main person that made this film entertaining for me.

Overall, ""Top Banana"" is not an easy film to review.  For those familiar with the musical, they dislike the number of songs (important songs) that were cut, while for me, not knowing the musical, I was more displeased with the overall pacing of the film and compared to other musicals made during this time, it seemed rather low-budget and relied too much on Phil Silvers and the others appearing in the film, were forgetful.

But if anything, the film and the Broadway musical would prove to be a big catalyst for Phil Silvers, while the film is more or less a B-movie film adaptation of a Broadway musical.",1335571200,4,4389,4.611325611325611
829608,2,6304286872,"I was looking forward to viewing the Broadway show ""Top Banana"" on DVD because I had missed it at live theatre. What a disappointing DVD. The sound and visual quality was poor, and some premiere songs were left out. This was supposedly recorded from the stage version, but when the actors took their bows, there was no audience applause, which was eery. Whom were they bowing to? All in all, a waste of money. Saw it once and gave it to the charity pile.",1325635200,,454,4.416666666666667
829609,3,6304286872,"Should you buy or watch this film? If you are a theater, film or Silvers buff, then yes. Otherwise you may not like it.
This was not filmed like South Pacific. This was an attempt to film a hit play as it was on stage. Plus,
they shot it in 3-D!
Before they released Top Banana most of the songs were cut (including the best tune, A Word A Day). They cut the 3-D idea.
Still, it's great that this and the cast LP exsist! This show was a big hit. It ran on B'way for over 350 shows. Phil Slivers was great in it. The audience understood
that it was a bash on Milton Berle. This launched Silver's career into high gear.
If you think that Phil is doing Bilko here, realize that this was BEFORE Bilko. Silver's fans
will love his performance (though he later said that he wasn't his best Top Banana performance. He was unhappy about the low production values and
the 3-D idea. He was right). By the way, they didn't have an audience. This too was a great mistake!
The film was shot during the play's run in LA. The story isn't as good as the complete play. Both the picture and audio have problems. The lighting is often off (and what a flat look much of the film has). But for the most part, the color is pretty good.

Rose Marie's part is, sadly, much smaller here. Too bad because she always knocked 'em dead. Silvers asked her to leave LA and come to NY to do this part!
She did it for him. He is the star, but Rosie is the second banana. Most of her role was cut along with her songs.

Still, for historical purposes, we should be pleased that this film exsists. The pace may seem a bit slow but this was 1952 and it was shot in a very odd manner.",1264377600,,1648,4.099071207430341
829610,3,6304286872,"This is the only movie of a Broadway musical filmed as an audience would view it from a seat in the theatre.  The VHS is considerably shorter than the original show which ran about two and a half hours. The movie was made in Hollywood, though there is a shot of a real audience in a real theatre. It was filmed at the end of the national tour of the Broadway company. The original sets and props were used to create the stage exactly as it looked had you seen the show at the Winter Garden in NYC. The VHS leaves out ""Flash Hogan,"" the singing dog and other ""acts"" that were part of the TV show within the show. The full length Broadway show made the storyline a little more clear. Actually, the earliest film was complete but was cut when it played on TV. I recommend this to Phil Silvers buffs and to musical theatre history teachers as well as those who enjoy looking back at the way things were.  The information in this review was gained first hand.

829611,3,6304286872,"TOP BANANA was an interesting experimental project...a stage play shot in color and 3-D in an attempt to recreate the experience of seeing a Broadway show from the front row for the moviegoer.
I don't think the film was ever released in 3-D format, though, as the film was released after CinemaScope had won over Hollywood. Reportedly the 3-D elements are likely lost forever, though a few 3-D clips survive. That's a shame.
Watching it flat the camera angles seem a bit odd and static, certainly something not helped by the loss of the intended stereoscopic aspect. The VHS isn't complete either. Obviously an edited and modified flat presentation on VHS isn't an ideal way to see a movie intended for 3-D theatrical showings.",1085616000,7,727,4.870967741935484
