8370104,1,B002GZF7W8,"Gomorra (2008) is based on a book from Robert Saviano that touches
upon the Camorra.

The film's important moment is when the central character, played
by Toni Servillo, suggests that Italy's economy is failing from a
competitiveness point of view in a world global market, from costs
attributable to a higher priced currency  (Euro) resulting  in a
much higher cost of living, while the earnings  of the working
class has either stayed the same,  gotten worse or been made more
difficult.

More to the point, views are asked  on what are the consequences of
unmonitored, laissez faire economics in regards to society,
especially in the total absence of morality and fair-play between
businesses.

It succeeds in showing a microcosm where people severely lack
mental, emotional and  character depth. Viewers are not told
whether the people are to blame, the lack of local opportunities in
a unified Europe and free trade world, or simply the deteriorated
quality of life for the working class in Italy overall.

The work is too long, lasting well in excess of 2 hours.

The soundtrack lacks conviction, sophistication and character.

The director insists in placing horse blinds on viewers, with a
one-trick pony zoom of Naple's inner city, its housing projects and
poor in the outskirts of the city, where there is rampant
unemployment, poverty, criminality, petty thievery, low-end housing.

As a form of entertainment, the film struggles in showing a
socially redeeming value or humor, not offering a single laugh.

It succeeds in showing the human dependency between various
individuals, a social hierarchy such that extortion payments are
enforced from some to others. The author zooms into aspects of
misery, drug trafficking, unemployment, lookouts and pushers on
street corners, and rooftops, the childen looking up to gangsters
as their role models, unrealistically, a complete lack of any
religious, or educative instruction in the citizens, admiration for
Al Pacino's Tony Montana character, consumption of narcotics, large
cash sums exchanged, drug burns, punks and delinquents disturbing
the peace, industrial espionage, alien labor factories bidding on
clothes contracts with legitimate fronts, certified garbage
disposal companies hauling toxic and radioactive waste to gardens,
small farms, quarries, etc.",1264982400,,2321,5.446927374301676
