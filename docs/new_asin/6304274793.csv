835629,5,6304274793,"The story is so simple that you have little excuse for not understanding it. Nothing is distracting you from it. There are no special effects, no built-up set, no fancy wardrobe. There is only one little girl on the street and people around her.
This little girl is in the center of the story.  The whining makes her universal. Have you never seen a girl who is quick-witted, cute, and spoiled by her older brother? He is very macho, but she knows how to play him. She wants what all other girls have. Selfishly, she refuses to realize that her parents have little money and can barely afford such necessities as school shoes for her brother.
Although the whole film happens on the same strip of Teheran street, you will see many colorful characters: tailor-shop owner, street-performing dervish, goldfish seller, and of course, the seller of the white balloons.
You may wonder why the film is called ""The White Balloon"" instead of ""The Goldfish"", for example. After all, the goldfish, not the white balloon, is the object of protagonist's desire.
Let's think about that...",960854400,,1073,4.831521739130435
835630,3,6304274793,"This film is a nice ""slice of life"" of a culture different from my own.  I can compare and contrast.  I liked this movie.  It is a simple story simply told.  Incidentally, it is told in real time.  The little girl  who is the star is a fairly unsympathetic character.  This is mainly  because of her whining performance. This appears to be the only flaw in the  film, but it is a major one.  The young actor who plays her brother  practically steals the show.  I hope to see more of him in the future.  Performances by the other actors, the mother and the tailor, are  particularly good.  All in all, I liked this movie and I recommend it.",960595200,,639,4.2521008403361344
835631,5,6304274793,"As with most Iranian made movies there is a deeper message or lesson you might say to be realized.  This movie is no different.  It is not an action packed movie that would rumble your house with it's base and keep all the  neighbors on their toes. Rather this movie shows the suttle bond between a  brother and sister and it's growth through one of their daily hardships. I  should add that the director is in no hurry either to show this.  A movie  with some depth to it needs to be at a so called ""slow pace""  inorder for the viewer to absorb and comprehend the ideas and thoughts that  are being introduced to them.
 If you like to watch a movie alone or  with a small crowd of patient viewers you will come out of this movie with  a big smile on your face and a happier heart :)",947548800,8,783,4.112582781456954
835632,5,6304274793,"I have been a fan of persian films for a long time.  Mostly, because I was born in Iran and remember watching films as a young child.  I loved this movie because of it's vivid color and poetic dialouge.  It's unlike  american films because it shows every possiable detail and has a slow pace.  It's not a fast pace action triller.  But it is a delightful story about a  girl and her adventure to buy a big goldfish.  You won't find american  films that pay this much attention to such a simple topic, but that is what  makes Iranian films standout from the rest of the films made around the  world.",922320000,5,598,4.297297297297297

7867296,4,6304274793,"This charming and thought-provoking Iranian film follows the story of a little girl named Razieh, who wants a big, white goldfish to celebrate Nowruz (spelled in alphabet in various ways), the Iranian New Year. Her family already has small, red ones - and Razieh's mother, busily preparing for the celebration that is just around the corner, doesn't listen. Undaunted, Razieh persuades her older brother Ali to talk to her mother for her.

Razieh's mother finally gives in. With a 500-toman bill in hand, Razieh goes out on her own to buy the goldfish. At the shop, however, she discovers that she has lost the money, her family's last banknote.

With an unpredictable story that unfolds in real time, and realistic characters (two snake charmers are really wonderful), ""The White Balloon"" is more than a feel-good, slice-of-life movie. Not everything in the film is sweet. Razieh, after all, gets into trouble partly because of her own carelessness.

The most brilliant part of the film is its ending. Director Jafar Panahi (later to be known for his ""The Circle"" and ""Offside"") gives a twist to the deceptively simple story at the end of the film, where you will be made aware who is truly in need.

Like ""Children Of Heaven,"" the story (written by Abbas Kiarostami) is slow compared with that of American or European films, but ""The White Balloon"" is worth watching as a parable told with a naturalistic touch.",1338940800,,1413,4.899581589958159
7867297,5,6304274793,"Maybe I got it wrong, but I saw the story as an allegory about modern Iran - represented by the little girl who wanted to keep in touch with this tradition of having a new goldfish for nouruz. The people that she met on her journey I saw as representing aspects of government, or philosophies of government. The soldier could represent the military option that some countries adopt, the Sufi could stand for some charismatic knid of Islam, etc.
I understood the film to be an exposition, to the established order in Iran and to the world, that Iranians must find their own way to decide who they are now, in the 21st century. Not a puppet state to the US, nor a revolutionary Islamic state. Something better, I hope.
Regrettably, such observations must be made as obtuse as possible, so no-one has to go to prison for criticising the powers that be.
Or maybe I got it all wrong. Maybe it's just a boring story about a spoiled little girl.",1242432000,,938,4.491228070175438
7867298,5,6304274793,"Through this curiously simple story, Abbas Kiarostami displays a breathtaking exploration around the social body of the Iranian nation, about a seven years old girl who, in the eve of the New year- 1374 according the Iranian calendar- in her desire to buy a goldfish, loses her money on the way.

Meanwhile, two dervishes, a gentle old lady, a distracted tailor, a talkative soldier, her brother and an afghan refugee will accompany her in order to help and comfort her, around that unpleasant fact. Apparently, it's a comedy, but there is a lot of nestled issues around, becoming a true beautiful story loaded of peerless humanity.

The main highlight is the overwhelming natural performance of this actress Aida Mohammadkhani who really stole the show all the way. After you watch it, you will agree with the fact this movie deserved Camera d' or in Cannes 1995.

It's absolutely incredible how this film has not been translated into DVD format.",1169856000,2,947,4.943396226415095
7867299,5,6304274793,"Simply put, determined seven-year-old girls are one of the constants of the universe, and little Razieh is an excellent example of this.  While not exactly spoiled, she is nonetheless sheltered from some of tense dynamics within her family --- and unfortunately, a stressed out mother and a father prone to violent outbursts also are far too easy for people across the world to relate to.
For Razieh, it is all pretty simple --- the quest for the extra-chubby goldfish, and dealing with the twists and turns of achieving her goal.  Every child has been a situation like this, and for those of us who can remember how it felt, this movie is a fascinating and deceptively simple tale.
The world can be a pretty scary place for a seven-year-old, and this movie brings that home quite powerfully.  One feels especially the ominous presence of a not particularly benign government. in the form of an intimidating military presence.
The movie's success rests on the ability of the girl playing Razieh to deliver her lines while retaining that natural little girl quality.  This she does magnificently.  She is irresistably cute (and knows it) but also can be a real pain in the ass when she doesn't get what she wants.  She is also overwhelmed by the world outside, but has enough resourcefulness to stick up for herself when she is being dealt with unfairly (as with the snake charmer).
She also conveys the power of loss, and reminds the viewer that just because an adult may regard something as trivial, it is nonetheless very real and very devastating to a child, and that the despair of loss for the child is as real as anything an adult might experience.  The moment when Razieh is at the pet shop and realizes that she has lost her bank note --- where she realizes that she is really screwed and also in big big trouble --- is as moving a scene in the cinema as I have seen.
Some viewers may find life as it actually happens to be pretty boring cinema, and I suppose in the wrong hands it could be extremely boring, but not in this case.  This has remained one of my favorite foreign films of all times.  I look forward to my not-quite one-year-old daughter reaching Razieh's age, so that I can begin to appreciate the similarities.  I sure she will drive me crazy just like Razieh would.",1081814400,14,2289,4.601965601965602
7867300,1,6304274793,"Boring.  The whining little girl was just plain annoying.
Other Iranian directors have been successful in getting around the censors while telling an interesting story.  This director has failed.  People who insist on seeing this film as artistic are trying too hard.",1053820800,,267,5.309523809523809
7867301,4,6304274793,"I have become quite fond of Iranian films--many of them, like ""The White Balloon"", are charming and simply told, portraying real life without much of a plot or any special effects. It is interestingly done in real time.
Children seem to be the focus of many of these films, as they are in this one. The little girl was so appealing, despite her whining and pouting, that and I found myself aching for her when she lost her money and was trying to find it.
A good, slow-paced movie...glad I saw it.",1017792000,5,497,4.413043478260869
7867302,4,6304274793,"The Iranian cinema industry is filled with charming films like this one. It is very subtle and understated... a tale of a little girl who wishes so much for a goldfish she sees when she and her mother are passing through the city together. She is convinced that the goldfish they see in the shop is fatter, more beautiful and superior to the goldfish they already have swimming in the pond in their courtyard at home. She begs her mother for the money to get the goldfish, but her mother denies it. The little girl then enlists her older brother's help to get the money. Eventually she succeeds in getting the money, but this is only the beginning of her adventure. At many times throughout the film, an odyssey through Tehran on Iran's New Year's Day (which I believe falls in March), the little girl and the money part company, and she has to struggle to find it and retrieve it. The story is charming and heartwarming. Iran's film censors are very strict about what they allow, so films like this are the standard fare. The films themselves are actually quite telling about everyday life in modern Iran, and I think these elements are the most telling of all. Unlike in western (particular American) cinema where you are beat over the head with parables and themes and lessons, these Iranian films just present a story simply and let you conclude whatever you like.",982368000,22,1368,4.633744855967078
7867303,5,6304274793,"This movie, although set in a culture that may be foriegn to many of us, crosses these boundaries.  It reminds us that all children have many of the same qualities.  They are all innocent and see life different than adults do.  The little things are not so little to them.  What may be insignificant to adults may mean the world to them.  Watching this movie made me stay glued to the set.  I couldn't wait to see how the children fared.  I was actually finding myself nervous for the little girl, as though I were the child who lost what seemed to her like all the money in the world.  I could watch this movie again and again, inspite of the fact that it has a slower pace than most popular movies of today.",974160000,8,709,4.2388059701492535
7867304,2,6304274793,"It's not anything I would see twice. I guess that it was a movie aimed for  the Nickelodeon channel.  Unfortunately, most children would find it boring  since most of the film centers on how this little girl is going to get her  money out of a gutter. And unless you are an adult who looks at many things  at an artistic perspective, you would rather wash dishes. If this movie  wasn't set at a foriegn country, I don't think I would have watched it for  as long as I did.  I soley liked this movie because of the adorable and  whinny little girl starring in it, not to mention that I learned that  ""Vali"" or ""Bali"" means ""yes"" in Iran.  I  especially enjoy the conversation she had with the soldier and the way she  questioned everything he said to her.  Cute girl, but the movie is too  empty and, except for the dialogue between the little girl and the  soldier,it was a little too dim witted and simplistic for my taste.",968716800,,924,4.315789473684211
