8312895,5,B00004TL88,"Sangam was a great blend of art, glamor and entertainment. This love story occupies a unique place in the annals of Hindi film history.
It is a beautiful tale of love, misunderstanding, separation, sacrifice, rejection, backed by great performances and melodious music that simply mesmerized the moviegoers.
The love triangle of Sangam was an appropriate analogy for the confluence of the 3 rivers Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati. Saraswati has to sacrifice himself for the sake of the 2 other rivers.
Sangam fetched Raj Kapoor the coveted Filmfare Award for Best Direction and Best Editing while Vyjayanthimala walked away with the Best Actress trophy.
The story line could be somewhat difficult for people in the west to grasp.
The strong male bonding has absolutely nothing to do with homosexuality.
It is a pure strong bond between 2 male friends, both of whom are in love with the same woman.
One of them has to make a great sacrifice to let his dear friend have the love of his life.

The DVD is subtitled. However, I was disappointed that the songs, with the greatest lyrics, do not have subtitles.
I have to go back to Google to look for tranlation of the lyrics.",1186790400,8,1167,4.8059701492537314
