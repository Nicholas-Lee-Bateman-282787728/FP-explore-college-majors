8091312,5,B000BRBAEM,"I am a big fan of Urusei Yatsura.  It is one of the most outrageously funny shows I've seen in a long time.  This disc, along with virtually every disc in the series, contains four episodes.  If you don't like to read subtitles, then this isn't the DVD for you.  But, I would suggest that you overlook the subtitles and watch this series from beginning to end.  I believe it's worth the time and money.",1417219200,,402,4.306666666666667
