Movie Review: If you like slap-stick comedy and rape, this movie is for you. This is the 3rd and final installment of the Rica trilogy and is by far the worst ever. Most of the fight scenes (and there are only few) suck a$$ because it's mostly done out of humor. The blood spillage is very minimal as well. The story sucks based on it's conception even though the storytelling is a little more coherent than the previous Rica movies (which is not saying much). The only thing this movie has going for it is Rica's butt. Her butt is curvy, round, tight and picture perfect but it's not enough to keep me interested. Not unless, however, if I got to see her naked butt for like maybe 10 minutes straight, I might of liked this movie but unfortunately it's irrelevant. BOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

Conclusion: 4 stars for the DVD and 1 1/2 stars for Rica 3: Juvenile's Lullaby.",1425859200,,948,4.603550295857988
