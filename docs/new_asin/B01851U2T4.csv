7539285,4,B01851U2T4,"It must suck snowballs when your own agent ends up firing you. Such ignominy befalls struggling off-off-Broadway actress Beth Baker (Sarah Lancaster), she with her big dreams gone to crap. Beth is in such a poor way that she every night crashes on her successful actress friend's couch. The holiday season can't come soon enough, and there's Beth with New York in the rear view as she makes for her tiny hometown of Kern to spend time with the fam and forget about her woes for a bit.

Only, it's been a long minute since Beth's gone home last, and things have changed. Her high school sweetheart is now happily married and with an adorable little girl. One of her very best childhood friends, Dean (Brendan Penny), is now a local fireman. In Kern, Beth is a big fish, but it doesn't take long for her to get fed up with everyone asking her to regale them with her big New York adventures, what with Beth trying her durndest to keep mum about her Broadway suck. And then there's that imposition of being asked to direct a children's holiday program and that open invitation to come on as the school's drama teacher. I guess these offers offend Beth's restless, ambitious spirit. But maybe that mysterious Santa at the Christmas tree lot can open her eyes to the possibilities, what with his sage advice and the keys he doles out with which one can go to sleep and dream of a better life. And who knows? There may be unexpected romance in the offing and performance opportunities just around the corner. If Beth could just stop... and breathe... and reassess.

'Tis the Season for Love kicks off Hallmark's 2015 Countdown to Christmas, and, yay, Sarah Lancaster's back! Man, what is it with Hallmark's leading actresses? Autumn Reeser. Cameron Candace Bure. Rachel Boston. Sarah Lancaster. Hallmark is borrowing from John Ford's habit of always hiring the same leads. I'm cool with it since I fancy them all. Hallmark is pretty incestious when it comes to plot, and this one's pretty rehashed. I will say that there is this bit of misdirection as the viewer is at first led to believe that Beth's love interest is this guy when, really, it's this other guy. Brendan Penny's pretty good, never mind that I don't much buy him as a fireman (maybe he should've done more firefighting stuff). He just doesn't carry that weight about him. To me, it's about Sarah Lancaster and how effectively she sells her role. Expect a holiday festival (there's always one). Expect that the show must go on. Expect a late plot swerve in which Beth must choose between a shot at happiness in her cozy hometown and a sudden boost in her acting career in New York.

Listen, we've seen this story so many times before, with other actors and on other channels and on THIS same channel. Come the holiday season, Hallmark is like that pair of cozy slippers you slip your feet into when it's chilly outside. You crave the warmth and the comfort of those slippers. Last thing you want is a swerve where you slip into your slippers and someone had snuck ice cubes in them. I say, during the holidays and with these holiday movies, you have to be forgiving. What matters is the execution of that same old story. The cast is nice in this one. Props not only to the leads but also to two supporting actors in particular. Garry Chalk generates serious gravitas as the tree-lot Santa, and no wonder Beth thinks there's something magical about him. He is that convincing. Anna Van Hooft is also excellent in the minor and thankless role of Nicole. Nicole is Beth's successful Broadway star and roomie. I love how Nicole is never catty but, instead, is endlessly supportive and non-judgmental of Beth. Honestly, as likable as Beth's hometown buddies are, Nicole is the one who impresses me most as that person who'll always have your back. Don't tell Beth, but I actually think Nicole is the more interesting character. She deserves her own fireman.",1448928000,2,3911,4.665217391304348
7539286,5,B01851U2T4,"Tis the Season for Love is about a woman named Beth Baker (Sarah Lancaster) who is a struggling actress who returns to her small hometown.  When Beth returns she thinks everything would stay the same but she is wrong.  Beth discovers that her old boyfriend, Barry (Andrew Francis) who was planning on going to New York with after graduation is married. Beth gets a call saying she does not get the part in a play that she thought she would get. Beth starts hanging out with a old friend, Dean (Brendan Penny) who has always loved her. Beth starts having these dreams of what the future will or what would of happened if she did not go to New York.  Watch this movie to see who Beth marries at the end of the movie!",1448582400,5,714,4.313432835820896
7539287,5,B01851U2T4,"I love taking the time during the Holiday season to warm up to what Hallmark has to offer in its countdown to Christmas. I found this out-of-work New York actress, Beth Baker (Sarah Lancaster)  who had been really trying along with her agent to land a ""Mamet"" Broadway play (I am not sure if they are meaning a David Mamet play, although I know no other). Without knowing anything really final, her friend gives her a lovely gift of a ticket back to her quaint and visually pleasing small hometown which she left ten years prior. While talking with her mother, Shirley, after arriving, she is already planning all of the Christmas things that the two need to get together, but really Beth kind of wants to rest. She does wish to see the town's Santa Claus (Gary Chalk) as that has always been her favorite part of the season - and she has said he has always given her everything she has ever asked for. When she actually does see him, he has a bit of a secret that leaves Beth always questioning.

She also meets up with her old friend, Dean (Brendan Penny) who had a crush on her while back in school as she was with Barry (Andrew Francis). According to Dean, he thinks they were definitely a mismatch and that they never really belonged together. The feeling is mutual with these two and their significant others way back then. Now with Dean being divorced from Melinda along with  having his twins and working as a fireman, Beth is finding him all the more interesting. He helps to boost her floundering self-esteem over not landing the acting roles she desires. While these two are undergoing a growing friendship and respect for each other, that Santa Claus has been up to something quite baffling for Beth and things get a little awry at times. Possibly something to do with being alone during the night?... After all, Beth did say he has always granted her everything she has wished for.

Since Beth has the acting chops, she is helping the town with some possibilities for performing together with the children and directing. Beth is finding out how much she has really been missing and now a seed has been planted in her mind if she should have ever left the place that she has missed so much and gave her so much happiness in her past... When things may start to get confusing now, then what may come of her future?

This is another visually pleasing and colorfully easy to view film that I have come to look forward to from Hallmark. The type of story with an uncomplicated plot that is what I like when I don't wish to think about anything but to just sit back and enjoy... Merry Christmas!",1448150400,10,2602,4.4926004228329806
7539288,3,B01851U2T4,"It's time for Countdown to Christmas again.  A combo of light comedy, romance, hometown coziness, and finding one's true self(sounds familiar) are wrapped up again by Hallmark.

In general, we enjoy this ongoing genre of movies, some much more than others, and look forward to the new offerings.  Here, New York struggling actor, played affably by Sarah Lancaster, returns to small town USA for the Christmas holidays only to find herself longing for what she appears to have missed when she ran off to the Big Apple.

A magical Santa (sure can't get enough of those), allows her to see what life would have been like if only...  Shades of It's a Wonderful Life- extra light and sugery.  Will she discover the truth and possibly a great and unexpected(not really) love in the process.  Wait and see.

Expect the usual Hallmark quality of film making with nice to look at actors, like Ms. Lancaster and love interest fireman(can't get enough of those either- see The Nine Lives of Christmas- recommended), Canadian actor Brendan Penny, definitely help a tepid storyline.  Yes, yes, of course, it's predictable; we don't mind that, and overall, not a bad flick, just needs more punch and less rehash by the numbers.  Just my opinion, now, on to the next CTC offering.",1447804800,4,1265,4.841860465116279

7539294,3,B01851U2T4,"Almost an actress, Beth (Sarah Lancaster) abandons her acting dreams and flies home for Christmas.  She meets up with her high school chums, now leading responsible lives with actual careers, and lies for all she is worth about how well she is doing in New York.  But, it is worse than she thinks when her agents calls and tells her she didn't get the part she wanted, a part that actually isn't a part, in an upcoming play.  Its a paid position to be on hand as an understudyjust in case.  And by the way, I quit, find yourself another agent.  Stuck in nowhere, Beth contemplates her life decisions and decides to take counsel from a tree-lot Santa.  She uses this poor man as her shrink!  In turn, he gives her sage advice and a key on a chain.
Theres a romance of sorts, acting as filler.  The story and outcome are fairly obvious at the outset.  Hallmark stories are not known for their variety.  All their plots run the exact same course.  Boy meets girl..
At 35, you would have thought this woman would have figured out if she was going to make a career in the theater or not.  By 35 her ingnue roles would have been in her distant past.",1512518400,,1143,4.314553990610329

7539296,3,B01851U2T4,"It's a Christmas movie with a happy ending.  So that in itself may be enough satisfaction for many viewers.

I look for a bit more - I like to feel like the story is really unfolding, not actors just saying their lines.  I have watched the two leads in other movies, and they are always the same in every role.  This might be okay, except they always come off as actors just trying to act.  I have not seen either one have chemistry with any other lead in other other story.  The makers of this movie decided to put two people who have zero chemistry together.  Mathematically, this could only turn out one way.  I watched it on two separate occasions, several months apart, and felt the same.

 I rarely leave reviews less than 4 stars, but I just had to vent my disappointment.  (By the way, Sarah was great in a sitcom I saw a few years earlier.. it is the drama roles that leave a lot to be desired.)",1506643200,3,904,4.228070175438597

You might think you want one thing but what you really want and what your heart needs is different from all of those long ago goals you have set for yourself.  When Beth comes home for Christmas she finds her high school love married to someone else but then there is Dean.  This story tells you that some times you have to go back and look at what your life was before you came home for that visit and then maybe you can see fully where you should be.  It's worth watching and I'm sure will become on of Hallmark's Christmas standards.,1473811200,31,641,4.221311475409836

So, any movie she is in seems to be better, because she does well in her role and I feel she is a real human. Not a size 0, blond like most of Hollywood. I also love this movie. I like how she has to make hard choices between her career and the man she loves. Another great Christmas love story with a wonderful actress. I only wish Hallmark would bring her back each year.",1522108800,,473,4.042553191489362
