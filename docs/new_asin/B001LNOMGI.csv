8319100,4,B001LNOMGI,"""The Lion of St. Mark"" is interesting and fast moving enough to watch more than once. I didn't notice anything  that would make it offensive for a family viewing. It's a pirate story set in the Renaissance Mediterranean world featuring Gordon (Tarzan-Hecules) Scott that won't put you too sleep.",1358208000,2,295,5.020408163265306
8319101,2,B001LNOMGI,"I too am bemused by the 4 and 5 star reviews of these Sinister Cinema DVDs.  Yes, they are low budget; yes, they are foreign films; yes, the prints are far from pristine.  However, these considerations don't entitle the films to rave reviews.  To argue that they do is to say, ""Sure the story is terrible and the production execrable, but the film makers had no money (and little talent) so they deserve 4 or 5 stars just for giving it that old college try!""

""The Lion of Saint Mark"" is better than the egregiously bad ""Pirates of the Coast"", but it's still mind-numbingly boring.  Perhaps it's an Italian thing, but have these film makers ever heard of pacing?  The story, such as it is -- and it is preciously scarce -- crawls along molasses-like.

The costumes and locations are excellent, the hairstyles preposterous, the acting generally okay (but with some notably awful exceptions), but the storytelling is all but absent.  With a decent screenplay this could have been a quite enjoyable swashbuckler.  Unfortunately, it lacked the former and thus proved not to be the latter.

I will conclude by mentioning that I am a big fan of swashbucklers.  I have dozens of them on DVD that I simply adore.  This is my favorite genre when it is done well.  However, I'm not willing to dole out stars to sub-par films just because they fall into my preferred genre.  If you want a good spaghetti swashbuckler (available from Sinister Cinema, no less) choose ""Seven Seas to Calais"".  While overlong and flagging in pacing in parts, it has a rousing opening with a chase through the city of Plymouth (England) and a sword duel among the ship skeletons at the wharf.  Rod Taylor and Keith Michell star, along with Irene Worth as Queen Elizabeth and direction by Rudolph Mate.  Again, it still suffers from a touch of Italian Sleeping Sickness, but is largely redeemed by its capable cast, humor, and some marvelous action pieces.",1336608000,,1923,4.726726726726727
8319102,5,B001LNOMGI,"""Lion of St. Mark"" (A.K.A. Il Leone Di San Marco) is a 1963 film that stars Gordon Scott; Gianna Maria Canale; Alberto Farnese; Giulio Marchetti; Rik Battaglia; Franc Bettoia; Feodor Chaliapin Jr.; John Bartha; Mirko Ellis; Franco Fantasia; Giulio Maculani; Anna Maria Padoan; Attilio Severini; directed by Luigi Capuano.  It is Italian people making a film about 1620 pirates.  Gianna Maria Canale plays the role of Rosanna Melzi, an implausibly beautiful pirate, who wins the heart of Gordon Scott in the role of Manrico Venier who at first seeks vigilante justice against the pirates who raid his coastal town on a weekly basis.
All Sinister Cinema DVD's are rescued films that were made 25 years ago or more, most of them never made it to the top ten box office list of blockbuster notoriety, but still were fairly decent works of cinematography that are worth watching when you are looking for an average adventure / thriller / mystery / suspense or whatever type of film that doesn't require paying a lot of close attention to, but still entertains.  The films are often grainy like late-night TV movies from the attic storage vault.  Many of the Sinister Cinema DVD's (like ""Lion of St. Mark"") heavily rely upon the surrounding landscape of near tourism beauty and sentimental architecture.  Some people tour historical homes or old ghost towns, some people visit cemeteries for genealogy research, some people restore vintage cars, and other nostalgic people collect old movies regardless of if they are B-movie quality or not.
I agree that for the price, Sinister Cinema should make these old films a little better quality in picture and sound, but this ""Lion of St. Mark"" film has the yesteryear theater opening of suggesting to patrons if the baby is crying, take them to the lobby please.  It is the novelty of these old films that make people interested in collecting them.  I chose to watch mine on Amazon by instant video.  If you know what a spaghetti western is, then you'll understand right away when I say this film is a spaghetti swash buckler epic for more reasons than that it was produced in the De Paolis Incirs Studios of Rome.  The canals of Venice and the costuming are nice, but if you study what the canals really were for, you also know there are times when the stench is unbearable; not so romantic.
The French and Italian courts of the seventeenth century being steeped in ritual, pomp, and stuffy politics of legendary betrayal and scandal, arranged marriages, and grand gala dance parties where people wear the very best they have, both of clothing and of conduct.  But of course it doesn't take a genius to figure out there is often more integrity and loyalty among whores and thieves; therefore the premise of this film, where one of the royal court takes an interest in a pirate.  Which is okay because his betrothed is hot to trot for somebody else anyway.  Romance, adventure, suspense - and of course in a movie the leading characters all need to be highly desirable and attractive, physically fit, and politically powerful people with something to risk; and something to gain.  This film has all the traditionally expected elements for yesteryear film buffs, and although it may not be as crisp and powerful as movies made with 20 million dollar budgets, the ""Lion of St. Mark"" IMHO is only missing one thing, the dialogue exchange where somebody asks, ""Where's your buccaneers?"" and the response given back is, ""On me buckin' head.""
The minuet played upon a harpsichord with royal court attire and dancing being one side of the film, the other being sword fights on board pirate ships and by the waterfront docks where it is difficult to differentiate between friend or foe - ultimately you still need to be a fan of old films and the nostalgia of the past.  Otherwise you're going to stay frustrated, disappointed, and upset about spending an hour's wages on a DVD.  Excuse me for being so blunt, but I have learned that no matter what achievement or recognition you earn, at the end of the day it is still your turn to empty the litter box.  Living in the real world, I give this film 5 stars.  To the castle!!",1319932800,5,4154,4.771269177126918
8319103,4,B001LNOMGI,"I am an avid collector of movies made during the period 1940s to 1970s, mainly costume period films. Luigi Capuano's film focusing on the pirates and court of medieval Venice starring Gordon Scott and lovely Gianna Maria Canale is a joy to watch.  The transfer is very good and film has not lost any of its charm. This will be a nice addition if you are collecting films covering European medieval period.",1301270400,3,405,4.625
8319104,1,B001LNOMGI,"I recently purchased Sandokan Pirate of Malaysia, The Executioner of Venice , and  Lion of St Mark.  Stay Away From These Titles From Sinister Cinema!  First of all the movie prints are of such bad quality you can barely watch them!  The colors are faded, and dark, which means the original print must've been pretty bad to begin with .  All three of these movies have been reviewed by one reviewer, Paul Scott , who gave 4 out of 5 stars for each movie.  After seeing how truly awful these movies are ,one has to wonder how unbiased Mr. Scott's reviews are?  Hopefully Amazon will have their movie review staff rereview the brand of movies being offered by Sinister Cinema, and check these movies out with unbiased reviews. The movie copies look like they've been recorded by some cheap home processing as the menus were done from a person using a home dvd recorder .  Very tacky!!  Buyers Beware!!!! I feel like I've ripped off, and you will too!",1295740800,4,948,4.562130177514793
