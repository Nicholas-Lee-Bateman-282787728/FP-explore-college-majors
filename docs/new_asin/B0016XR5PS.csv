8264220,5,B0016XR5PS,"A great dvd from this polish brutal-technical death metal band. It consists of 3 separate gigs; it starts off with a studio-live performance filmed at Krakow in a TV studio with audience brought in for the ocassion, which might explain why they are so quiet, with just some people headbanging front-row. Not a problem since despite a sloppy and lighting-bolt fast editing -the cameras are rarely on the fretboards or the drums when they should be but the sound is nothing short of fantastic, which together with an incredibly energetic performance more than makes up for the not-so-good filming.

A short 15', 3-song set from a polish edition of the Ozzfest ensues and it is on par with the other one but shot on fullscreen with just one guitarrist.

The icing on the cake IMHO is a 26' set shot at Metalmania which features the most recent tracks and the best versions of the older ones I've ever had the pleasure of watching. This particular portion of the dvd left me in awe.

Extras are overwhelmingly abundant and include a great-sounding live videoclip with studio sound, a comprehensive (writen) bio, a discography, an hour worth of interviews with members of the band and an extensive photo gallery.

The interactive menu is intricate but a breeze to navigate since it works perfectly.

There is a 5.1 option and a dolby D 2.0. The sound is levelled throughout the whole dvd so no adjustments are necessary which is a blessing. The tuning of the bass-drums is weird, since unlike other bands of the style, emphasis is not put there, and they sound as if the skins were tighter to provide a dryier sound but maybe it's just the mix.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did",1252540800,2,1677,4.62962962962963

8264222,5,B0016XR5PS,"There is no loss in the transition from cd to live.  The performance maintains the same intense sound and the instruments are tightly played.  Amazing to see early footage of Vitek, who truly was a fantastic drummer and performed so on this dvd.  Many performances, a few interviews, and a great reason to buy it to help out Covan in his recovery.",1219708800,3,347,4.564516129032258
8264223,2,B0016XR5PS,"this is a must for any decapitated fan that loves the band to death. however don't expect to be watching the live concert more than once, or even the whole way through. the camera men that taped the show all decided to catch Parkinson's disease before they went to work.

they do everything they possibly can to ruin it. from horrible camera angles to constant zooming in and out. if there is a cool guitar solo, you won't see it. if they ""focus"" on the drummer, it won't be on the drums that hes playing on.

the only thing that saves this dvd from being a complete waste of time is the fact that they interview vitec alot. they give some kinds of background info on the band, but nothing real in depth.

even if your a hardcore decapitated fan you should think twice about buying this dvd.",1218153600,3,791,4.331081081081081
8264224,5,B0016XR5PS,"Decapitated dvd is a great look at this bands power, and how brutal this is they were on the ozzfest  which is pretty cool. I have never seem them live,  this was worth seeing on dvd so fans of deicide and cannibal corpse and a little touch of morbid angle!!",1216339200,3,258,4.14
