740845,4,6303929982,"Mad About Music is one of Deanna Durbin's best films.

Durbin plays the daughter of a middle aged movie star, and to protect her mother's youthful image, she's sent to a girl's school in Switzerland. Here she writes herself phony letters from her imaginary father, a heroic explorer and game hunter. When a stranger (Herbert Marshall) comes to town she pretends he's her dad, to satsify her doubtful shoolmates. It's a typical comedy plot that gets a bit moving near the end, but Durbin's fine singing raises it above the level of the plot.  In one of my favorite scenes she's about the get thrown off a train, and sings loudly to attract attention.",1148083200,9,649,4.684210526315789

740847,5,6303929982,"Durbin's best film, a totally illogical piece of nonsense set at a totally impossible girls' school in a Switzerland which only has existed in gingerbread houses.  Parts of the school look like it was designed for the  Seven Dwarfs.  The plot, which has Deanna raised apart from her movie star  mom who doesn't dare let the world know--gasp!--she has a teenaged  daughter, makes NO sense at any level.  Playing the mom, Gail Patrick looks  like she's about to pause at any second, look straight at the camera and  say, ""How the Hell am I supposed to play this poor woman--she's an  idiot and I'm obviously supposed to make her sympathetic.""  Durbin is  darling, delightful, all pep and carbonation, and sings like an angel.  She  suffers beautifully when she suffers and can ride a bike and give out with  the vocals at the same time (!).  I love this totally screwy film.  Did  ANYONE believe ANY of it when it came out?  Dunno but it was a GIGANTIC  hit.",940636800,29,956,4.583333333333333

7857095,5,6303929982,"Taking a break from watching latest movies in Multiplex,which may turn out boring and you may doze off in between,I decided to watch some classics I had for a long time.""Mad about Music"" turned out to be refreshing with Deanna Durbin and her classmates singing ""I love To Whistle"" just after the rolling titles. Film is really pleasant and Deanna looks utmost beautiful and effortless in her singing. Deanna Durbin left us on 20 th April 2013.

Deanna who plays Gloria Harkinson makes up wild stories about her non-existent father and later on in the movie she speaks umpteenth lies to hide this one lie. Her mother played by Gail Patrick

is glamorous actress in Hollywood who has to hide that she has a fourteen year old daughter studying in a boarding school in Switzerland. Since Deanna had told this fib that her Father is a explorer cum hunter she asks her mother to ship various trophies of a hunt like ivory tusk. I was so surprised by such amount of lies told by everybody,I don't think in any other movie I have seen people lie so much.

A boy named Tommy played by Jackie Moran {Tom Sawyer (1938), Since You Went Away (1944)} takes a liking to Deanna and ask her for a date at a coffee shop. She lies to the head-mistress that her father is coming to meet her and to let her go. Now her class-mates follow her to the coffee shop where the boy gives her a bouquet. Her friend Olga { Marcia Mae Jones} comes and tell Deanna that her classmates have followed her to see her father on insistence of Felice {Helen Parrish}Felice is convinced that its all a lie a cock and bull story.

From there she goes to railway station to meet her father who is non-existent and not coming. When the train arrives she hand the bouquet that her boy-friend gave to the person who seems most like her hunter father,Richard Todd played by Herbert Marshall who actually is a Music Composer ,saying its a Swiss custom to welcome guests. And later on accompanies this man and his secretary to his hotel just to convince her friends.",1378166400,4,2019,4.493188010899183
7857096,5,6303929982,"This is a very enjoyable film with Deanna Durbin still in her middle teenage years as she was in ""One Hundred Men and a Girl"" directly before this one. She is the daughter of a Hollywood actress going to a girls' school in Switzerland, which gives her many chances to sing, whistle and yodel . . . . and I particularly enjoyed her performance of the Gounod ""Ave Maria"" supported by a boys' choir. Herbert Marshall as her ""adopted"" father helped to create some interesting ""comedy of errors"" type jokes about mistaken identities while giving the film a certain respectability (as Leopold Stokowski did in her film right before this one). The print is quite good, although it is in PAL format and can be played only by the latest generation of DVD players. Arthur Treacher and William Frawley have opportunities for their own comic turns. Highly recommended.",1376524800,2,856,4.79054054054054
7857097,5,6303929982,Just to hear Deanna Durbin sing Ave Maria is worth the price of the video. It's a shame she made so few movies.,1370131200,,111,3.869565217391304
