8181798,4,B000NVL8KW,"Wages of Sin is an independantly made flick. It's got an intelligent storyline, interesting divers characters and cool martial arts. It's obvious that the film was an ambitious learning-while/by-doing-project. So there are a lot of things one could mention about the insecure novice things that are also part of the movie. But what made me happy about it, is the passion and dedication that Nathyn Masters and his microbudget cast and crew put into this film. That shows. That inspired me. And it entertained me, of course. (Four out of five stars, in its context. Expect the next one to be six out of five.)",1283990400,,608,4.8
8181799,5,B000NVL8KW,"This movie was amazing not just because it was done and on shoestring budget but because it's a great movie! Of course, if Masters had millions like the fat cats it would have been super sleek. But because it isn't made me love it more-made me believe that all anyone has to do is believe in himself.
The camera angles, the editing, the locations, the camera work, the acting, the marital arts sequences, though I found sometimes too dance like, I loved it because there were these guys committed to making it believable.
I can't say enough about this new filmmaker or his cinematographer, or his crew. Being able to make a film is incredibly challenging. The director has to find people to do everything-in this case-Masters did MOST of the jobs a bigger budget would have handled. Still he got it done with the help of mentor and friend, John H. Rogers III and others listed in the credits. You have to have the ability to communicate your ideas to your collaborators. That's just what Master did.
Oh, yeah, buy the double disc so you can see ""how"" they planned those scenes. Personally, I wished he would have included ""Behind the Scenes"" with the Actors too. I thought CiCi Foster, Riti Madugula, Michael MacRae-loved them. Of course, I can't mention everybody, I want to-I want say how I loved the multi-racial, multi-cultural casting. Yeah! I can see budding film careers for Tonee Dang, Foster, MacRae and others. Well rounded cast.
About the Director/Writer/Marital Arts/Actor, Nathyn Brendan Masters (long name), but long on talent too- is a good actor. As a director, he clearly knows how to get his actors to believe in his ideas and script. His film plays well. I've watched it a number of times and even with some flaws, it's still better than the high gloss flops I've seen with 100 million budgets with special effects. Masters methods and story and faith comes through on screen. Buy it! Then tell your friends.",1242172800,,1927,4.738095238095238
