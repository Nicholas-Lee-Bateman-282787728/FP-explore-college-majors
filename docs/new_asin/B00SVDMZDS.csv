8699449,5,B00SVDMZDS,"This Made in Japan DVD is a re-issue of the original DVD from the
Deep purple made in Japan super Deluxe edition box set from May last year which had the 4 Discs + 1 DVD in the box
well the record company that released the super Deluxe box set decided to reissue it again seperatly this time
with it's own case and cover art back in December

the Rock milestones-Made in Japan dvd that was released years ago is an Unauthorized 60mins Documentary
which had no interviews with the band members, only had interviews with Music critics, and Rock Journalists
waste of money for sure
