I was really conflicted; Paris Hilton has come to symbolize all that is bad
(Nottie) about TV and the Movies today. So liking this movie went against my grain, but I did. Christine Lakin and Joel David Moore put this movie over
despite the other actors. It comes out a heart warming romantic comedy
for the geeks of the world.",1210291200,,520,6.442857142857143
3116192,3,B0013LL2ZW,"This movie is not nearly as bad as everyone would lead you to believe.
If you liked the recent movies like Superbad & Knocked up then this would be right up your alley. Paris' acting is not that bad though it is not good, either. This is your typical teen movie with better jokes then i've heard in Juno or other so called comedies as of late.
It's easy for people to bash Paris...believe me I could care less baout her. She did an average job and the other actors are really good. The first hour was better than expected, the last half hour was a bit of a stretch, but hey ...whaddya expect.
If you like teen type comedies ala American Pie, Mean girls, Superbad then you should really give this at least one viewing. Don't hop on the band wagon of ""one star"" movie. This is not too bad.

PS - why do people think Paris is ""sexy"" and ""hot"" ? The close-ups of her in this movie just confirm that she has the body of a tall 12 year old. Nothin sexy about that!",1209081600,4,958,4.122994652406417
3116193,2,B0013LL2ZW,"Unkind Paris Hilton jokes aside, this wasn't the worst movie ever to come out of Hollywood, just the worst so far this year. It had some laughs and geeky Joel David Moore has the makings of this decade's Tom Green. (Left-handed compliment, huh?)

I'd have given TH&TN a second star if it had been only a little bit less inclined to fall back on shallow gross out material, but truth be told that's about all it had going for it. There's also something abrasive about movies that feature a message of conformity-via-individual-transformation as the answer to life's problems. Frankly I thought June, the titular ""Nottie"" character, played by Christine Lakin, though replete with bad teeth, facial hair, mole, leaking nose, toes from Hell et al, had a lot more individuality than the version of herself she became later. Not unlike Marcia Brady's friend Molly Webber, whom Marcia helped become a self-confident beauty back in the `70's, or the ugly duckling-to-swan Tai character in Clueless thirteen years ago, under the tutelage of Joel David Moore's Nate and Paris Hilton's Christabel, Christine Larkin's June becomes appropriately and acceptably gorgeous by present standards, and ONLY then does her inner beauty become apparent to all.

Yawn!

Sure, June may have needed a good shave and maybe her teeth put you in mind of Austin Powers, but, come on, isn't being proud of who you are the very basis of all those After School Specials we used to watch in sixth-grade health class? Um, no? Well, anyway, I got on The Breakfast Club's case about making its message ""conform through image"" and yet The Hottie & The Nottie goes about a hundred times farther with that theme and is a hundred times less enjoyable.

Forgetting all that for a second, TH&TN probably doesn't deserve the scorn it's gotten. It does have some legitimate laughs, the cast does earn its paychecks, and there's no malice in Paris Hilton's performance or character. I somehow doubt this flick's going to be much of a force to be reckoned with come Oscar Night, but it's no worse a time waster than 90% of what the movie industry churns out every year.

3116195,1,B0013LL2ZW,"Hey, I like to endulge in a bad movie once and a while but this movie is so bad it makes you question your existence after seeing it. This is not a so bad it's good. This is so bad its shameful.

Premise: Christabel(played by Paris Hilton)took a vow of celibacy but afetr meeting up with her high school heartthrob, Nate(played by Joel David Moore) she plans to break that vow. The problem is her Rumplestiltskin looking friend June(played by Christine Lakin) tends to chase away any man Christabel's life. So Christabel promises Nate a romp in the sack if he can find June a man. Later on Nate falls for June as he realizes that she was a hottie after all.

Opinion: This ugly duckling turned beautiful swan story falls flat on its face. I won't waste time saying that this is the worst movie of all time because I'm sure you heard that from EVERY reviewer on Amazon. I'll just tell you what stinks about it. The plot(if you can call it that) is a joke and the acting is terrible. Paris can't act(she cant sing either but that's another story) and seeing her in The House Of Wax, National Lampoons's Pledge This and The Simple Life solidifies that point perfectly. She is basically a female version of Butthead(of Beavis and Butthead. She cant take full blame for this movie being abysmal. Joel David Moore and Christine Lakin cant act either. This movie goes through great lengths to get laughs and it comes off as desparation. Like all the things Nate does to help June change her appearance to get a man or Nate mistakenly smelling June's funky feet while trying to sniff(?) Christabel's butt(PLEASE don't ask) or a mentally handicapped albino stalker thrown in the picture for good measure. Plus the idea of Paris being a hottie is laughable. She looks like a cracked out Fabio in drag. In closing this movie is the pits. Dont let curiosity overwhelm you enough to see how bad this movie is because it's not worth it. You'd rather watch Mr Magoo(the movie) till you turn blind then sit through this. This movie has been out for a while and I'm the fifth person to review it.

3116197,1,B0013LL2ZW,"Out of all the movies that I've ever seen this past year, this is definitely one of the worst and most pathetic movies I've ever felt like I wanted to go away. Paris Hilton gives a very unconvincing performance as she tries to do whatever it takes to make her friend a better attractive woman to men. Sadly, for someone who really never learned her lessons and lied about giving back to others on Larry King Live, Paris Hilton showed no effort of changing her ways, and also showed she really doesn't have the drive to act. Not even die hard Paris Hilton fans would even come close to being interested in this movie.

3116221,4,B0013LL2ZW,"I can honestly say that the only reason I purchased this DVD was because Paris Hilton is in it. I thought the movie was gonna be a drag to watch but I am a fan of hers and went on with it anyway. I recommend buying this mainly if you like Paris Hilton or if you enjoy simple retold stories.

Now before I go on, I rated this DVD four stars because I enjoyed Paris in this movie. If it was not for her, this movie would probably have been very boring to me and gotten 2-3 stars for a cute SIMPLE story. To go further on, it might even have recieved a 1 for being TOO simple.

It was a surprise! Like others said, the story doesn't have a lot of depth to it but it is a fun story and entertaining to the bored mind! Its true that this movie, like others featuring her are just to parade Paris around but this one does at least a decent job where others fail. For example, this movie is totally steps above her other movies like Bottoms Up, The Hillz, Pledge This! and Nine Lives. I can tell you for a fact that those movies sucked beyond any acceptable limit! They all also had her printed dead center on the covers when she was gone halfway through the movie! At least she made it to the ending in 'The Hottie and the Nottie'.

Although I haven't had the time to enjoy them yet, special features include: Production commentary, actors commentary, personal video dating ads from the actors, and also a featurette with Paris Hilton applying makeup to co-star Joel David Moore to make him a 'hottie'.

3116223,3,B0013LL2ZW,"""The Hottie and the Nottie"" is a peculiar subject. A way to describe it is a very painful endurance test with a somewhat tolerable reward. This could've easily been the worst movie I've seen just for the first hour alone. It's about&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norm-Spellman/dp/B002VPE1B6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norm Spellman</a>&nbsp;playing a dopey loser who can't find the right girl in his life, because the one he was unconditionaly fancied over was an eight-year-old girl he knew decades ago. And so out of the blue, he drove thousands of miles from his old home, to meet with his equally pathetic friend who literally had a caseload of everything about his girl-turned-Paris Hilton. He decided to stalk her, bump into her, and wanted to date her, but she won't let him unless her best friend (Christine Lakin) since childhood gets a guy. But her best friend is, quite frankly, ugly as sin...which I had to wonder if Paris was hanging out with her for charity or she just needed security from the perverts.

The whole first half is so sickening and unethical.  The impetus of the humor is these characters describing just how repulsive the Nottie is, while I had the watch the desperate and superficial lead bribing people to date the ugly chick just so he can be with Paris. I hated these character and the ugly jokes got really obnoxious after half-a-second.  Although, I have to agree that the best friend, June, is repulsive. She's not one of those ugly TV/movies girls that otherwise have a hot body like the hunchback woman from ""Transylmania"" or that ""Splice"" chick: she is head-to-toe horrendous; her body is a series of warts, fungus, and British teeth. But at least she's better than Raspuita from ""Norbit"", at least she's not ugly on the inside as well as the outside.

While I was about to berate this film, it pulled a fast one on much.  When the movie arbitrarily gouged a solution when an extremely talented and handsome blonde named Johann came to June's rescue, he happened to give her the makeover of a lifetime.  He happened to be an orthodontist and has several connections with professional dermatologists, so she went through with significant changes.  Weeks later, the Nottie changed from being fugly to fabulous...though in my opinion, the actress looked average; she's not hot like Monica Bellucci or cute like Natalie Portman, Christine is somewhere down the middle.  Still, the character's new look is more appealing than Paris, and her face wasn't the only thing that's changed.  The whole structure of the movie changed as well.  ""The Hottie and the Nottie"" pulled a ""District 9"" on me, changing the mood and format as it went from being a gross-out, trashservice comedy to a competent but predictable romance flick.

The genre-shift is so significant, it's practically a whole new movie; seriously, watch the last few minutes of this film, and you wouldn't think it has something to do with the lady troll. The characters also made some changes with their personalities: June somehow knew the lead dork's plan but decided to be friends with him, the lead is becoming less selfish and more honest with the people involved, and Paris became extremely coy. Once June got hot, the lead started to have feeling for her, though I presume he was just physically attracted to her much like he was to Paris. Y'know, the guy doesn't seem to have any genuine feelings for these ladies outside their looks, so him being less of a creppy stalker doesn't make him less likable.

For those that were forced to watch this film, do yourself a favor and skip to the 45-minute mark; that's where the suffering ends, and the humility begins.  In a nutshell, ""The Hottie and the Nottie"" went from ""There's Something about Mary"" to ""Shallow Hal"" in a rather confounding ye seamless way. The characters seem to know very well just what they're doing, so it's rather moot to complain about their actions; plus, I did find June to be rather interesting, both before and after the change. It's easy to waste this film because Paris Hilton is in it, but once I look past her (which is hard to do since she's like to hog as much screen time as her tabloids), I could say this movie ended up being almost sincere.  Facetious, but sincere.",1281571200,,4296,4.8994490358126725
3116224,5,B0013LL2ZW,"I thought this movie was very sweet. I hadn't seen a movie like it before, it was refreshing to watch an unfamiliar plot unfold. I loved the fact that June was given a chance to shine. It would be so hard to be constantly compared to your friend as the ""nottie"". I think something we can learn from this movie is that you should make the most of who you are, don't put yourself down. If you don't believe in yourself, who will? I know a lot of people hated this movie because of Paris Hilton. If you focus on the story, its far better than most movies today. I'd definitely recommend it, especially to teenage girls. Go on, its worth it.",1275523200,2,637,4.229508196721311
3116225,5,B0013LL2ZW,"I mean, it was an horrible movie of course, but cute at the same time.

Paris Hilton (who I love for being so dumb) was dreadful, and the one that played Johann too. Luckily, Joel Moore and Christine Lakins comedy skills saved the movie.

I know it's not like that The Hottie and the Nottie will be remembered as a good move, but I think the reason so many people hate it is because Paris Hilton's in it.

It was awful, but it was a whole lot better than the Scary Movies (and all the ones from those writers) and A Cinderella Story. It deserves a 5 at least.",1275264000,,559,4.110091743119266
3116226,5,B0013LL2ZW,"OK lets be fair here. I bet that the MAJORITY of the bad reviews here came from people that have not watched this movie and/or have cold hearts. I happened to watch this movie with and open mind and guess what? I loved it! Sure this movie isn't Oscar material however, it's a fun, warm movie. The acting is OK and even Paris does a decent job. Her character is perfect for the role. The character of ""June""(Lakin) was done well but I feel that they did go a little overboard with her ""flaws"". I know girls that have friends like that and it was pretty much on par with how they act. I'd be bitter and angry too! As for Joel Moore, I just couldn't stop thinking about ""mmmm I HATE YOUR FACE!"" and ""How can they see me!??"" from Grandma's Boy! Haha, I guess that's burned in my mind forever.

Anyway, This is a super cute movie and any decent-hearted person would appreciate it even if you do not like Paris Hilton which I personally do not like NOR dislike.

This movie is pretty strange but sort of funny, I won't give away anything. I give this 4 out of 5 star rating.",1270339200,,375,4.529411764705882
3116228,2,B0013LL2ZW,"I watched this when I was really bored, had a bad cold and it was rainy out...Not that this is any excuse to volunteer oneself to this type of torture! I guess too, I can always blame it on my fever and use the excuse ""I was very ill and not right in the head."" which must be the case because in a normal state, I don't think I ever would have watched this wreck! I am not a huge Paris fan but I am not a Paris hater either. So curiosity got the better of me and I decided to see what all the fuss was about.

So is the movie really as bad as people say? Yes and no...It wasn't the worst movie I have seen but it fell short of being ""So bad, it's good"" material. It wasn't an Epic Fail of the Laughable kind either...It was bad in a mediocre way. Epic Badness occurs when a movie sucks so much it literally has you rolling on the ground laughing...With this movie though, you'll probably just be rolling your eyes. Or writhing in pain at all the corny dialogue!

The acting is bad and alternates freely between wooden and overdone throughout the movie. The actors did the best they could but it wasn't a good script and the director didn't seem to be picky either. Usually a director will shoot multiple takes of a scene then use the best one. I figure either: 1) He took one take of each scene. 2) The other takes were WORSE and he did use the best ones...a frightening concept but certainly believable. 3) He didn't care and could not tell the difference and used whatever footage.

Now the storyline, if you can call it that is not a new concept: Hot girl Christabel has ugly friend June and she won't date until June finds a guy. Nate Cooper has had a crush on Christabel since 1st grade and tracks her down (in a creepy, stalkerish way) as an adult. Naturally, his quest becomes finding a guy for June so he can date Christabel...You can probably guess the rest and the ending is pretty predictable too! I would call it a sappy chick flick but I don't want to insult sappy chick flicks!

This movie sends a mixed message and the plot isn't realistic at ALL! The actress who plays June (Lakin) in reality is a pretty girl. They gave ""June"" thinning hair, a gross fake mole on her chin, a body hair issue, all kinds of skin problems, toenail fungus and ridiculous looking GREEN teeth! Her ""beauty issues"" are things that have supposedly plagued her all her life and we are supposed to believe she did NOTHING about this, THEN it magically clears up with a few treatments and June is transformed into a ""hottie"" at the end of the story. Like, if this was so easy to fix why would June not do it sooner? Did she live under a rock in California and never hear about Rogaine, tooth veneers or laser treatments?

In reality, if the Christabel character was any kind of friend she would have been like, ""Sweetie, I am helping you get that FIXED!"" and done this years ago! But instead, Christibel has this ugly friend and she gets ALL the attention from guys for years before finally deciding to go celibate ""Until June has someone special in her life"" Um...Hello...If Christabel cared so much why wouldn't this ""hottie"" who obviously is stylish not give her ""nottie"" friend a makeover so she can find a man? Instead of giving June some beauty tips, she gives her some corny ""Beauty is on the inside"" line and we are supposed to believe this gives the movie some deep message. GIVE ME A BREAK! Forget the fact that Nate doesn't fall in love with June until AFTER the makeover...A supposedly ""sweet"" nice girl like Cristibel would have helped out her frumpy friend...Friends don't let friends walk around in granny swimsuits and horrible clothing while sporting facial hair, skin lesions and infected toenails!

I think the writers thought the gross out factor would be funny...Really it isn't. People have all kinds of medical problems that can disfigure them and it certainly doesn't make good comedic material. There are treatments out there and not everyone in the world can afford them. If you are going to make a movie about loving a person on the inside that is fine but I think that message was lost in this movie. I honestly feel some of the jokes were in poor taste, immature and could be offensive to some people especially people with a not-so-fixable problem!

Overall I think the reason this movie bombed so badly was because you can't laugh with it and it is hard to laugh AT it too! If you are a die-hard Paris Hilton fan you might like this movie. I will give it two stars based on the fact that Paris looks great. If you want to see some shots of her looking great in a bikini and in ""Hot"" outfits this might be a good movie...if you leave the sound off! Christin Lakin also did an ok job with the script she had to work with, I would like to see Lakin in some better movies in the future! As for Paris, I think she should STOP acting and music altogether. Honestly, some of her perfume smells nice. Maybe she should get into making fragrances and cosmetics instead. She seems to have much more talent when it comes to fashion, makeup and things regarding appearance...And at least it would keep her from making more movies like this trainwreck!",1265068800,3,5158,4.411764705882353

Far from being a rich, spoilt brat, Paris has got natural talents as an entrepreneur. That I admire.
She's a natural actress, very comfortable in front of a camera, very cool, calm, cheeky and captivating.

I enjoyed this fun-filled movie from it's beginning.

What I like about the themes of this particular movie:

-> Paris' character of being a faithful friend to someone unfortunate.
  I wonder if Paris Hilton can stay in any long-term relationship in real-life?

-> Paris' philosophy about the human soul vs body and how we look on the outside.

-> The revealing ""flashback"" story-telling technique that is used to explain
  present relationships in relation to the past.

If you want a good laugh and a little learning philosphy in how humans judge others,
watch this movie. I also recommend the movie ""Shallow Hal"" which is just as good.

""The Hottie and the Nottie"" is one of those hypocritical films that pretends to make the case that beauty is only skin deep - only to turn right around and prove the opposite.

Cribbing at least a portion of its story from ""The Taming of the Shrew,"" the movie stars Paris Hilton as Cristobel, a drop-dead gorgeous ""hottie"" who has put her own love life on hold until her grotesquely unattractive best friend, June (""the nottie""), can get some guy to go out with her.  This is bad news for Nate Cooper, a first class dweeb who's had a major crush on Cristobel ever since the day she sauntered into his class in the first grade and ignited his passion.  When he finally finds her again after all these years, he's stuck with having to come up with a guy who'll be willing to date the nottie - that is, if Nate is to have any chance at all of making it with the hottie.

I suspect that ""The Hottie and the Nottie"" was originally designed as some sort of bizarre vanity project for Ms. Hilton, showcasing just how much better looking she is than the rest of the human race by placing her side by side with the most unattractive woman the filmmakers could possibly come up with.  But I believe there's something more insidious at work here, in that, in the end, the movie endorses the very thing it is supposedly arguing against.  Through all sorts of unlikely cosmetic alterations, the ""nottie"" is miraculously transformed into a ""hottie,"" making her at last an acceptable object for love - thereby assuring that all is indeed right with the universe.  The movie also labors under the double standard of requiring that the women all be beautiful and sexy while the men are allowed to look as dowdy and disheveled as they please and not be judged for it.

Still, there's probably no point in over-thinking a movie that's as featherweight and insignificant as this one is.  And bad as it is, there are a few genuinely funny moments when Nate finds himself competing with an impossibly handsome, blonde, granite-jawed, muscle-bound ""doctors without borders"" dentist for Cristobel's affections.  Nate gets a bit of his own back in these scenes and they are well-played and clever, at least compared to the rest of the movie.  Hilton doesn't exactly disgrace herself in the role of the hottie - she actually has a certain innate sweetness that is rather disarming at times - but her acting has yet to go much beyond simple posturing and posing.  Joel Moore, Christine Lakin and Johann Urb can't be blamed for the material they've been handed, so we can be generous in our assessment of their performances and simply note that all three have their moments of likeability and charm.

If you liked the recent movies like Superbad & Knocked up then this would be right up your alley. Paris' acting is not that bad though it is not good, either. This is your typical teen movie with better jokes then i've heard in Juno or other so called comedies as of late.
It's easy for people to bash Paris...believe me I could care less baout her. She did an average job and the other actors are really good. The first hour was better than expected, the last half hour was a bit of a stretch, but hey ...whaddya expect.
If you like teen type comedies ala American Pie, Mean girls, Superbad then you should really give this at least one viewing. Don't hop on the band wagon of ""one star"" movie. This is not too bad.

3350690,2,B0013LL2ZW,"Unkind Paris Hilton jokes aside, this wasn't the worst movie ever to come out of Hollywood, just the worst so far this year. It had some laughs and geeky Joel David Moore has the makings of this decade's Tom Green. (Left-handed compliment, huh?)

I'd have given TH&TN a second star if it had been only a little bit less inclined to fall back on shallow gross out material, but truth be told that's about all it had going for it. There's also something abrasive about movies that feature a message of conformity-via-individual-transformation as the answer to life's problems. Frankly I thought June, the titular ""Nottie"" character, played by Christine Lakin, though replete with bad teeth, facial hair, mole, leaking nose, toes from Hell et al, had a lot more individuality than the version of herself she became later. Not unlike Marcia Brady's friend Molly Webber, whom Marcia helped become a self-confident beauty back in the `70's, or the ugly duckling-to-swan Tai character in Clueless thirteen years ago, under the tutelage of Joel David Moore's Nate and Paris Hilton's Christabel, Christine Larkin's June becomes appropriately and acceptably gorgeous by present standards, and ONLY then does her inner beauty become apparent to all.

Yawn!

Sure, June may have needed a good shave and maybe her teeth put you in mind of Austin Powers, but, come on, isn't being proud of who you are the very basis of all those After School Specials we used to watch in sixth-grade health class? Um, no? Well, anyway, I got on The Breakfast Club's case about making its message ""conform through image"" and yet The Hottie & The Nottie goes about a hundred times farther with that theme and is a hundred times less enjoyable.

Forgetting all that for a second, TH&TN probably doesn't deserve the scorn it's gotten. It does have some legitimate laughs, the cast does earn its paychecks, and there's no malice in Paris Hilton's performance or character. I somehow doubt this flick's going to be much of a force to be reckoned with come Oscar Night, but it's no worse a time waster than 90% of what the movie industry churns out every year.

Premise: Christabel(played by Paris Hilton)took a vow of celibacy but afetr meeting up with her high school heartthrob, Nate(played by Joel David Moore) she plans to break that vow. The problem is her Rumplestiltskin looking friend June(played by Christine Lakin) tends to chase away any man Christabel's life. So Christabel promises Nate a romp in the sack if he can find June a man. Later on Nate falls for June as he realizes that she was a hottie after all.

Opinion: This ugly duckling turned beautiful swan story falls flat on its face. I won't waste time saying that this is the worst movie of all time because I'm sure you heard that from EVERY reviewer on Amazon. I'll just tell you what stinks about it. The plot(if you can call it that) is a joke and the acting is terrible. Paris can't act(she cant sing either but that's another story) and seeing her in The House Of Wax, National Lampoons's Pledge This and The Simple Life solidifies that point perfectly. She is basically a female version of Butthead(of Beavis and Butthead. She cant take full blame for this movie being abysmal. Joel David Moore and Christine Lakin cant act either. This movie goes through great lengths to get laughs and it comes off as desparation. Like all the things Nate does to help June change her appearance to get a man or Nate mistakenly smelling June's funky feet while trying to sniff(?) Christabel's butt(PLEASE don't ask) or a mentally handicapped albino stalker thrown in the picture for good measure. Plus the idea of Paris being a hottie is laughable. She looks like a cracked out Fabio in drag. In closing this movie is the pits. Dont let curiosity overwhelm you enough to see how bad this movie is because it's not worth it.

Sadly, for someone who really never learned her lessons and lied about giving back to others on Larry King Live, Paris Hilton showed no effort of changing her ways, and also showed she really doesn't have the drive to act.

I thought the movie was gonna be a drag to watch but I am a fan of hers and went on with it anyway. I recommend buying this mainly if you like Paris Hilton or if you enjoy simple retold stories.

Now before I go on, I rated this DVD four stars because I enjoyed Paris in this movie. If it was not for her, this movie would probably have been very boring to me and gotten 2-3 stars for a cute SIMPLE story. To go further on, it might even have recieved a 1 for being TOO simple.

It was a surprise! Like others said, the story doesn't have a lot of depth to it but it is a fun story and entertaining to the bored mind! Its true that this movie, like others featuring her are just to parade Paris around but this one does at least a decent job where others fail. For example, this movie is totally steps above her other movies like Bottoms Up, The Hillz, Pledge This! and Nine Lives. I can tell you for a fact that those movies sucked beyond any acceptable limit! They all also had her printed dead center on the covers when she was gone halfway through the movie!

3350720,3,B0013LL2ZW,"""The Hottie and the Nottie"" is a peculiar subject. A way to describe it is a very painful endurance test with a somewhat tolerable reward. This could've easily been the worst movie I've seen just for the first hour alone. It's about&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norm-Spellman/dp/B002VPE1B6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norm Spellman</a>&nbsp;playing a dopey loser who can't find the right girl in his life, because the one he was unconditionaly fancied over was an eight-year-old girl he knew decades ago. And so out of the blue, he drove thousands of miles from his old home, to meet with his equally pathetic friend who literally had a caseload of everything about his girl-turned-Paris Hilton. He decided to stalk her, bump into her, and wanted to date her, but she won't let him unless her best friend (Christine Lakin) since childhood gets a guy. But her best friend is, quite frankly, ugly as sin...which I had to wonder if Paris was hanging out with her for charity or she just needed security from the perverts.

The whole first half is so sickening and unethical.  The impetus of the humor is these characters describing just how repulsive the Nottie is, while I had the watch the desperate and superficial lead bribing people to date the ugly chick just so he can be with Paris. I hated these character and the ugly jokes got really obnoxious after half-a-second.  Although, I have to agree that the best friend, June, is repulsive. She's not one of those ugly TV/movies girls that otherwise have a hot body like the hunchback woman from ""Transylmania"" or that ""Splice"" chick: she is head-to-toe horrendous; her body is a series of warts, fungus, and British teeth. But at least she's better than Raspuita from ""Norbit"", at least she's not ugly on the inside as well as the outside.

While I was about to berate this film, it pulled a fast one on much.  When the movie arbitrarily gouged a solution when an extremely talented and handsome blonde named Johann came to June's rescue, he happened to give her the makeover of a lifetime.  He happened to be an orthodontist and has several connections with professional dermatologists, so she went through with significant changes.  Weeks later, the Nottie changed from being fugly to fabulous...though in my opinion, the actress looked average; she's not hot like Monica Bellucci or cute like Natalie Portman, Christine is somewhere down the middle.  Still, the character's new look is more appealing than Paris, and her face wasn't the only thing that's changed.  The whole structure of the movie changed as well.  ""The Hottie and the Nottie"" pulled a ""District 9"" on me, changing the mood and format as it went from being a gross-out, trashservice comedy to a competent but predictable romance flick.

The genre-shift is so significant, it's practically a whole new movie; seriously, watch the last few minutes of this film, and you wouldn't think it has something to do with the lady troll. The characters also made some changes with their personalities: June somehow knew the lead dork's plan but decided to be friends with him, the lead is becoming less selfish and more honest with the people involved, and Paris became extremely coy. Once June got hot, the lead started to have feeling for her, though I presume he was just physically attracted to her much like he was to Paris. Y'know, the guy doesn't seem to have any genuine feelings for these ladies outside their looks, so him being less of a creppy stalker doesn't make him less likable.

For those that were forced to watch this film, do yourself a favor and skip to the 45-minute mark; that's where the suffering ends, and the humility begins.  In a nutshell, ""The Hottie and the Nottie"" went from ""There's Something about Mary"" to ""Shallow Hal"" in a rather confounding ye seamless way. The characters seem to know very well just what they're doing, so it's rather moot to complain about their actions; plus, I did find June to be rather interesting, both before and after the change. It's easy to waste this film because Paris Hilton is in it, but once I look past her (which is hard to do since she's like to hog as much screen time as her tabloids), I could say this movie ended up being almost sincere.  Facetious, but sincere.",1281571200,,4296,4.8994490358126725

I loved the fact that June was given a chance to shine. It would be so hard to be constantly compared to your friend as the ""nottie"". I think something we can learn from this movie is that you should make the most of who you are, don't put yourself down. If you don't believe in yourself, who will? I know a lot of people hated this movie because of Paris Hilton. If you focus on the story, its far better than most movies today. I'd definitely recommend it, especially to teenage girls.

I happened to watch this movie with and open mind and guess what? I loved it! Sure this movie isn't Oscar material however, it's a fun, warm movie. The acting is OK and even Paris does a decent job. Her character is perfect for the role. The character of ""June""(Lakin) was done well but I feel that they did go a little overboard with her ""flaws"". I know girls that have friends like that and it was pretty much on par with how they act. I'd be bitter and angry too! As for Joel Moore, I just couldn't stop thinking about ""mmmm I HATE YOUR FACE!"" and ""How can they see me!??"" from Grandma's Boy! Haha, I guess that's burned in my mind forever.

3350725,2,B0013LL2ZW,"I watched this when I was really bored, had a bad cold and it was rainy out...Not that this is any excuse to volunteer oneself to this type of torture! I guess too, I can always blame it on my fever and use the excuse ""I was very ill and not right in the head."" which must be the case because in a normal state, I don't think I ever would have watched this wreck! I am not a huge Paris fan but I am not a Paris hater either. So curiosity got the better of me and I decided to see what all the fuss was about.

So is the movie really as bad as people say? Yes and no...It wasn't the worst movie I have seen but it fell short of being ""So bad, it's good"" material. It wasn't an Epic Fail of the Laughable kind either...It was bad in a mediocre way. Epic Badness occurs when a movie sucks so much it literally has you rolling on the ground laughing...With this movie though, you'll probably just be rolling your eyes. Or writhing in pain at all the corny dialogue!

The acting is bad and alternates freely between wooden and overdone throughout the movie. The actors did the best they could but it wasn't a good script and the director didn't seem to be picky either. Usually a director will shoot multiple takes of a scene then use the best one. I figure either: 1) He took one take of each scene. 2) The other takes were WORSE and he did use the best ones...a frightening concept but certainly believable. 3) He didn't care and could not tell the difference and used whatever footage.

Now the storyline, if you can call it that is not a new concept: Hot girl Christabel has ugly friend June and she won't date until June finds a guy. Nate Cooper has had a crush on Christabel since 1st grade and tracks her down (in a creepy, stalkerish way) as an adult. Naturally, his quest becomes finding a guy for June so he can date Christabel...You can probably guess the rest and the ending is pretty predictable too! I would call it a sappy chick flick but I don't want to insult sappy chick flicks!

This movie sends a mixed message and the plot isn't realistic at ALL! The actress who plays June (Lakin) in reality is a pretty girl. They gave ""June"" thinning hair, a gross fake mole on her chin, a body hair issue, all kinds of skin problems, toenail fungus and ridiculous looking GREEN teeth! Her ""beauty issues"" are things that have supposedly plagued her all her life and we are supposed to believe she did NOTHING about this, THEN it magically clears up with a few treatments and June is transformed into a ""hottie"" at the end of the story. Like, if this was so easy to fix why would June not do it sooner? Did she live under a rock in California and never hear about Rogaine, tooth veneers or laser treatments?

In reality, if the Christabel character was any kind of friend she would have been like, ""Sweetie, I am helping you get that FIXED!"" and done this years ago! But instead, Christibel has this ugly friend and she gets ALL the attention from guys for years before finally deciding to go celibate ""Until June has someone special in her life"" Um...Hello...If Christabel cared so much why wouldn't this ""hottie"" who obviously is stylish not give her ""nottie"" friend a makeover so she can find a man? Instead of giving June some beauty tips, she gives her some corny ""Beauty is on the inside"" line and we are supposed to believe this gives the movie some deep message. GIVE ME A BREAK! Forget the fact that Nate doesn't fall in love with June until AFTER the makeover...A supposedly ""sweet"" nice girl like Cristibel would have helped out her frumpy friend...Friends don't let friends walk around in granny swimsuits and horrible clothing while sporting facial hair, skin lesions and infected toenails!

I think the writers thought the gross out factor would be funny...Really it isn't. People have all kinds of medical problems that can disfigure them and it certainly doesn't make good comedic material. There are treatments out there and not everyone in the world can afford them. If you are going to make a movie about loving a person on the inside that is fine but I think that message was lost in this movie. I honestly feel some of the jokes were in poor taste, immature and could be offensive to some people especially people with a not-so-fixable problem!

Overall I think the reason this movie bombed so badly was because you can't laugh with it and it is hard to laugh AT it too! If you are a die-hard Paris Hilton fan you might like this movie. I will give it two stars based on the fact that Paris looks great. If you want to see some shots of her looking great in a bikini and in ""Hot"" outfits this might be a good movie...if you leave the sound off! Christin Lakin also did an ok job with the script she had to work with, I would like to see Lakin in some better movies in the future! As for Paris, I think she should STOP acting and music altogether. Honestly, some of her perfume smells nice. Maybe she should get into making fragrances and cosmetics instead. She seems to have much more talent when it comes to fashion, makeup and things regarding appearance...And at least it would keep her from making more movies like this trainwreck!",1265068800,3,5158,4.411764705882353

Far from being a rich, spoilt brat, Paris has got natural talents as an entrepreneur. That I admire.
She's a natural actress, very comfortable in front of a camera, very cool, calm, cheeky and captivating.

I enjoyed this fun-filled movie from it's beginning.

What I like about the themes of this particular movie:

-> Paris' character of being a faithful friend to someone unfortunate.
  I wonder if Paris Hilton can stay in any long-term relationship in real-life?

-> Paris' philosophy about the human soul vs body and how we look on the outside.

-> The revealing ""flashback"" story-telling technique that is used to explain
  present relationships in relation to the past.

If you want a good laugh and a little learning philosphy in how humans judge others,
watch this movie. I also recommend the movie ""Shallow Hal"" which is just as good.

Cribbing at least a portion of its story from ""The Taming of the Shrew,"" the movie stars Paris Hilton as Cristobel, a drop-dead gorgeous ""hottie"" who has put her own love life on hold until her grotesquely unattractive best friend, June (""the nottie""), can get some guy to go out with her.  This is bad news for Nate Cooper, a first class dweeb who's had a major crush on Cristobel ever since the day she sauntered into his class in the first grade and ignited his passion.  When he finally finds her again after all these years, he's stuck with having to come up with a guy who'll be willing to date the nottie - that is, if Nate is to have any chance at all of making it with the hottie.

I suspect that ""The Hottie and the Nottie"" was originally designed as some sort of bizarre vanity project for Ms. Hilton, showcasing just how much better looking she is than the rest of the human race by placing her side by side with the most unattractive woman the filmmakers could possibly come up with.  But I believe there's something more insidious at work here, in that, in the end, the movie endorses the very thing it is supposedly arguing against.  Through all sorts of unlikely cosmetic alterations, the ""nottie"" is miraculously transformed into a ""hottie,"" making her at last an acceptable object for love - thereby assuring that all is indeed right with the universe.  The movie also labors under the double standard of requiring that the women all be beautiful and sexy while the men are allowed to look as dowdy and disheveled as they please and not be judged for it.

Still, there's probably no point in over-thinking a movie that's as featherweight and insignificant as this one is.  And bad as it is, there are a few genuinely funny moments when Nate finds himself competing with an impossibly handsome, blonde, granite-jawed, muscle-bound ""doctors without borders"" dentist for Cristobel's affections.  Nate gets a bit of his own back in these scenes and they are well-played and clever, at least compared to the rest of the movie.  Hilton doesn't exactly disgrace herself in the role of the hottie - she actually has a certain innate sweetness that is rather disarming at times - but her acting has yet to go much beyond simple posturing and posing.  Joel Moore, Christine Lakin and Johann Urb can't be blamed for the material they've been handed, so we can be generous in our assessment of their performances and simply note that all three have their moments of likeability and charm.  Here's hoping they have better luck in their future projects.",1216166400,3,2746,4.658385093167702
3350761,3,B0013LL2ZW,"Ok...to start with - I cannot stand Paris Hilton. I still have not figured out what business this woman has still getting headlines - Isn't her 15 minutes up yet? Anyway, I watched this film and was actually humored and entertained. Paris played the part very well and convincing and the story line was cute. Not an award winner but also not a waste of time.",1216080000,4,358,4.4393939393939394
3350762,4,B0013LL2ZW,"People just seem to buy into whatever the critics tell them to like or not like. If you listened to the critics, you went out and saw Juno, which, in my opinion, sucked. This movie is actually better, funnier, but, because Paris is in it, people have to treat it as if it was the worst movie ever made. Watch it for yourself, before listening to others. I'm not a Paris Hilton fan, at all, by the way.",1212969600,4,401,4.153846153846154

The Nottie is just plain likeable and you want to root for her. Yes, it's been done before but this is 2017 [now] so what hasn't been done before? I bought it over 5 years ago and every once in awhile take it out for some light hearted fluff. If I feel down in the dumps this is the cure. I like the soundtrack as well. And at least they put some effort into making the homely girl actually homely. They didn't just slap some nerdy glasses on her.",1512086400,2,620,3.9285714285714284

8251820,5,B0013LL2ZW,"I absolutely love this movie!  Teaches you that beauty really is only skin deep and it is important to remember to see what type of person one is,  rather than quickly judging someone's appearance. Plus there are super funny parts in this movie! Real laugh out loud moments! Highly recommend! Age 13,14 & up",1506038400,,307,4.666666666666667

8251822,1,B0013LL2ZW,"A young boy (Nate) who is still in love with his 1st grade crush Cristabel (Paris Hilton) tracks her down 20 years later, to find out that she is still as beautiful as he remembers. Blah blah blah, he finally gets the balls to talk to her, but she refuses to go on a date with him unless he finds someone to go on a date with her less than attractive best friend, June. Blah blah blah, he finds someone to go on a date with June who just so happens to be an extremely attractive dentist. Said dentist wants to give poor little June a makeover and SURPRISE! Turns out June is a stone cold fox with a little help from Rogaine and veneers (no joke). Nate then falls in love with June. Moral of the story.....don't judge a book by it's cover? I don't know if there is a point to this movie, this is just my best guess.
I had to take a xanax 10 minutes into this movie, just to calm my nerves from listening to her voice, which is not much different than nails on a chalkboard.
Turns out, Paris Hilton won the Golden Rasberry Award for Worst Actress.  My opinion? She should've stuck with the adult film industry.",1454889600,,1108,4.177570093457944
