8082539,3,B000B6OG08,"A long time ago I did Tai Chi with Joey Bond on a TV show on PBS, every show he would teach a new move for a total of 24 and the last show he put them all together. I got away from Tai Chi over the years, and recently thought of it, and how good I felt while doing it, so looked for Joey Bond online. I came across this DVD, and going by some of the info describing it, I thought it was the series with all the 24 moves. I should have read the reviews!  though they don't all say what it is, it's only the first 3 moves of the 24 and it takes him a 75 min DVD to go over (and over) this. Plus his talking and ""Chinese Wisdom""  I would stand there waiting for the moves to start. Then I waited for the NEXT ones that aren't there.  There is an option to ""play all"" and chapters 1-6 but they are all basically the same 3 moves (which are very simple, like ""sink to the ground"" which is raise the arms up and then lower them, bending the knees) Even though the DVD info doesn't say, apparently this is only the first DVD of the tv series, which goes over and over the first 2 (simple) moves and than shows (briefly) the 3rd, something about waving the crane's wings. If all 24 moves were on it, and once one is mastered,move on to the next, putting them all together in the end, than all the slow, talking, correcting the mistakes of the ones doing it with him, etc might not be so bad. I like how Joey does it mirror image, but I have found simple and easy to follow Tai Chi instructions on You Tube that have more to them than this DVD. It doesn't even give any info about another DVD that might have the NEXT  3 movements on it, though even if it did I wouldn't buy it, there must be DVDs that have more to them than this. I kept trying to go overr the DVD to see if I was missing something else, like another segment, but it says it is 75 mins long and it seems to be all used up with what I already saw.",1491609600,,1905,3.8894601542416454
8082540,2,B000B6OG08,"This is prbly as good as Tai Chi gets but I tried Tai Chi at the gym too & it's not for me. I'm way too hyper for this kind of work out. I rated it 2 stars but I guess that's not fair because you should judge for yourself on this one.  I do Aerobics & Zumba, so to slow down for Tai Chi is too hard for me. I did the entire hour at the gym but it was excruciating & when it was over I couldn't leave fast enough.",1381017600,,412,3.4782608695652173
8082541,5,B000B6OG08,I've been looking for Joey Bond's Tai Chi since I wore out my VHS copy years ago. This is great for every level from novice to pro. His teaching is very easy to follow.,1363305600,,168,3.9705882352941178
8082542,5,B000B6OG08,"So  glad I find out about Joey Bond.  A Tai Chi Master who is English and speaks Mandarin Chinese!  He is an an true example of practicing what you preach.  He is simply the best out there and his teaching style is presented with high tech animation, which supports his precise approach to a complex set of movements.  He covers physical dynamics in a unique way.  Chinese philosophical, medical and and cultural education is also included.

Everything is so easy with him, both his good  looks, and what a mind!  I wish I had found him before, because it is a pleasure to watch him move, and his instruction is slowly, deliberately and beautifully delivered.

His Tai Chi television show was on pbs for 8 years and he is on the UPS network throughout Europe. WOW!

What a beautiful & dedicated human being!",1264636800,2,807,4.573426573426573
8082543,1,B000B6OG08,"This is a crappy DVD.  Bond spends 45 minutes going over a single Tai Chi move.  You spend all of that time and don't know any Tai Chi when you're done.  Plus Bond is annoying.  Also, when I got my DCD there was a big scratch on it and it didn't work very well.

I suggest Scott Cole's DVD (Discover Tai Chi for Beginners).  Scott also does the mirror image style that is easy to follow... and you actually get a real work out.  You actually learn several moves, step by step.  Scott takes you though the moves and then gives you 2 separate routines (a warm up and a work out).  Once you get the moves down you can skip straight to the workouts on the menu.  There is also an added feature with about 6 extra moves that aren't in his workout. Scott isn't bad looking either, and the scenery is great.",1201651200,4,800,4.136363636363637
8082544,4,B000B6OG08,I bought this in the one-dollar bin at Walmart and was surprised by the great quality.  The instruction is very clear and easy to follow.  The instructor takes his time to make sure everything is understandable.  My only complaint is that I would like more.  I'm debating about whether to buy the longer version for $26.  I do think I'll go back and get more $1 copies for other members of my family.,1146268800,7,400,4.424657534246576
