1219462,4,B00000IBXV,"I had been looking for this DVD for a very long time and was very happy to find it, since I had read the book One Survivor Remembers several times. My only wish is that the DVD could have been longer, 43 minutes is too short to tell such a moving story. But, it was effective.",1171065600,6,276,3.9464285714285716
1219463,5,B00000IBXV,"This documentary, and a wonderful curriculum and packet of primary sources, is available for teachers through the Teaching Tolerance program for FREE.  It is a perfect fit with an Anne Frank unit or any unit dealing with the Holocaust or genocide.  Visit [...] for more information.  The Teaching Tolerance project is part of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Alabama.  If you know how they are primarily funded you may enjoy the irony of getting free materials to teach tolerance and combat racism and prejudice.

I am using this film with my 8th grade class. The film is simple and eloquent and I remember seeing excerpts of it at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. It is a must see. No wonder it was recognized by the Academy Awards.",1130889600,14,759,4.8076923076923075

Her story is a witness and a cry for justice for the millions of others whose voices were forever silenced by the worst evil the world has ever known.  Every person alive should be required to watch this film, because those who forget history are doomed to repeat it.  ""Never Again"" indeed.  Thank you, Ms. Weissman.",1490659200,,374,4.796875

7909704,5,B00000IBXV,The movie is an excellent documentary of a little known atrocity from WW II told live by the one survivor. I had no idea this existed.,1390262400,2,134,4.1923076923076925

7909707,5,B00000IBXV,"I purchased this after reading All But My Life. I wanted so much to hear the voice of Gerda Weissmann Klein and see her.

It was truly a wonderful experience to share her life story in this way. I highly recommend this tape as a companion to her unforgettable book.",1331769600,4,265,4.3
7909708,5,B00000IBXV,Each year this is one of the videos that I show my high school students when I teach about the Holocaust. Personal stories seem to work best and this one is done well. It has an impact on the kids and they talk about it long after they see it.  Thank you Gerta for telling your story!!,1268524800,,285,4.0
7909709,5,B00000IBXV,"A great documentary about the life of Gerta Weissemann Kleiss during World War II. From her being shipped from her home in Poland as a pretty young teenage girl, to her trials and tribulations while working in forced labor camps for Nazi Germany, to being liberated by a young American Army officer who later became her husband. It is an uplifting story about a very special lady. It is a great documentary and I highly recommend it to anybody. It should be required watching in all schools to show the true horrors of the Holocaust. A true story about courage and the will to survive.",1235433600,2,585,4.580952380952381
