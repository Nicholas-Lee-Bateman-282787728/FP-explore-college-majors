1957681,4,B0000WN13G,"I like Donnie Yen is always putting in alot of effert in either Directing or Acting or fight Chor.,This film really did have a couple of problems much being little short scenes maybe 10 or so seconds that made no scence. Other than that the only other complaint is the fight scenes in the first half of the movie are nothing compared to some really awsome fight scenes in the second half of the film! Here are the Pros and cons
 PROS
1. Donnie Yen's on screen presents
2. In the film his character fights and becomes buddies with the ever so popular Wong FE Hong(should have been played by Jet Li)
3. The fight scenes in the second half of the movie are awsome especially the last one with tons of on screen fighters.
CONS- theres really not many
1. The english dubbing is not so good, give me the original language or nothing i hate dudding especially in this one!
2.fight scenes early arnt great but they get much better

Last note buy this if either you are a Donnie Yen or Yeun woo ping fan,or you just collect decent martial art films. Rent if your a casual movie goer.",1082851200,3,1074,4.311881188118812
1957682,4,B0000WN13G,EXPERT FIGHTERS MUST JOIN FORCES WHEN SOUTHERN CHINA'S HIGH OFFICERS BEGIN SMUGGLING OPIUM OVER THE BORDER. THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I EVER LOOKED AT A DONNIE YEN MOVIE AND I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH HIS AMAZING FIGHT SKILLS. THIS MOVIE HAS SOME OF THE BEST FIGHT SCENES I'VE SEEN IN A WHILE. MARTIAL ARTS FANS SHOULD CHECK THIS ONE OUT.,1077062400,,333,4.475409836065574
1957683,2,B0000WN13G,"Woo Ping really can't direct.  I absolutely love his fight choreography, but this is one awful movie.  I just wasn't able to get past the terrible sound quality, acting, and sheerly baffling moments in the script.  Do yourself a favor and don't see this one.",1074038400,2,258,4.688888888888889
1957684,3,B0000WN13G,This movie appeared to be o.k. A lot of action. Story's seemed to be confusing. Donnie Yen has recently become a rising kung-fu star. I enjoy his movies. It's fun and entertaining.,1349740800,,180,4.65625
1957685,5,B0000WN13G,"The best action kong fu ever. They don't made movies like that anymore. That's too bad. Donnie Yen got some moves. Oh, baby!",1344211200,,124,4.434782608695652
1957686,4,B0000WN13G,I am becoming a great big fan of Donnie Yen.  He is a mixture of Jet Li and Jackie Chan in his moves.  His fighting style is superb and he talks with a mild calm voice and he is quite good looking.  This was the first of his movies that I purchased and I plan on getting more.,1333843200,,276,3.7241379310344827
1957687,3,B0000WN13G,"Also known as Hero Among Heroes, this is a fun little movie. The most disappointing thing was that it was not in Cantonese with subtitles. Fans who want to see a little of Donnie's silly side, in addition to his amazing kung fu, will not be let down. Donnie is great as So Chai. There is a scene with Donnie vs. Hair?? Funny! Drunken Fist, and also well done serious scene of So Chai withdrawing from opium.

I could have done without the buck-toothed aunt, but I have a feeling it was funnier in Cantonese. I agree with another review who stated that Once Upon A Time in China 2, Wing Chun, or Iron Monkey were the best films from this period of collaboration between Yen and Yuen Woo Ping.",1317772800,,691,4.315384615384615
1957688,2,B0000WN13G,"This sounds great and looks great but the movie is laughable. I would only give this 1.5 stars if the option was available. This is a goofy, clumsy film that is not new by any means. Not that it has to be new to be good. I am a huge Donnie Yen fan but wow, what a disappointment.. Save your cash. Buy Chocolate instead....the movie, not the candy.",1292025600,2,347,4.117647058823529
1957689,4,B0000WN13G,"Well... Lets see, for starters the acting was horrific. The plot was a little cliche, but the fights were AWESOME. Many of the fights were VERY UNIQUE, but interesting. Although I gave it the 4 stars for the final fight scene with the drunken style fighting. You may find yourself laughing at the horrible acting though.

I recommend 36th Chamber and The Invincible Pole Fighter for a really good plot and fight scenes.",1110499200,2,419,4.739726027397261
1957690,4,B0000WN13G,"Like many people have said in earlier reviews, there is a lot of ""junk"" to get through in the beginning of the movie.  First you must endure the notorious aunt, who is indeed very annoying.  I like it best when So's dad slaps her teeth out at the end.  However, I found that the opium parts were not too bad since they were a central point of the plot (no matter how hobbychobby it may have been).  I also wish that wong fei hung could have been a better actor as well, since he seemed to take a second seat to Donnie, even though he is supposed to be the superior fighter.  Most parts with Donnie in it are tolerable, if not humerous.  Like when he skips around the city dressed as a peasant and throws cooked goose around to the beggars, and when he is locked in a room to break his opium habit, hehe.  One particularly entertaining part is when he starts beating that drum in the beginning to defy that female-led clan, and then kicks everyone's ass.  I think that the Beggar So character is interesting, so the somewhat dumbed down plot is not all that terrible.

Aside from that, the movie is completely redeemed at the end with Donnie's drunken style, which is without a doubt amazing.  It is the sole reason why I like this film so much.  If you are a Yen or Yuen fan, then I would suggest buying this movie.",1099526400,4,1315,4.262096774193548
1957691,2,B0000WN13G,"If you want to see 'old-school' Kung Fu, then get the classic Shaw Brothers movies starring Gordon Liu and others.

If you want to see the more modern approach, check out the ""Once Upon A Time In China"" films produced by Tsui Hark and which star Jet Li. The OUATIC series has better acting and much more interesting and inventive fight scenes. The comic relief is also handled much more deftly.

I even found Iron Monkey which has the same director and stars to be a better film. Don't waster your time - there are better movies out there!",1099526400,7,539,4.434343434343434
1957692,2,B0000WN13G,"The fight scenes are excellent, the rest of the movie blows chuncks.",1095638400,4,68,4.75
1957693,3,B0000WN13G,"I bought this movie without ever having seen it which is always risky.  I am not disappointed.  It is not the greatest ever but definitely worth seeing, especially for fans of Donnie Yen.  A simple, yet good story and fairly realistic fighting, aside from the giant leaps around the room or one man holding a table top above his head while two men fight on it, will keep your interest.

Donnie Yen stars as the over confident and somewhat naive young man who thinks he can do no wrong.  He goes through his ups and downs and learns an important life lesson: DON'T GET HOOKED ON OPIUM!  His kung fu is still full of flare and power as he takes on everyone he meets and actually shows a bit of acting range.  There are some great match-ups for fight scenes, it just needed a couple more fights overall to make this one of the best.  He still throws a better kick than anyone, and you can't argue with that!  Maybe you can, but it will fall on deaf ears.  I'm not listening!

As for the DVD itself, the picture is good and sharp and is widescreen.  The audio is done well and the sound is clear.  The dubbing is average, no better or worse than most movies made around this time.

This movie really deserves four stars but the comedy relief by the woman who plays his aunt is terrible!  It really takes away from the otherwise highly entertaining film.  Just try to ignore it.  You don't watch these films for superior acting, but for the kung fu wizardary, and this one will not let you down.",1090540800,7,1490,4.32129963898917
