5570027,1,B00BBEFD2Y,"We waited a long time for this Blu-Ray 3D to be delivered.  Of all the 3D movies/documentaries we've seen, this is by far the worst!  I have never been to Yellowstone and was looking forward to seeing some footage that would make me want to go!  This is not it... Other than the pictures of the buffalo, there is no reason I would want to travel across the country to see this place based on this video.  My husband has been there and was looking to see some spectacular video of the place.  60 minutes of boring snapshots with no people and no Old Faithful...what is Yellowstone without the geyser? The background music (flute) gets to be obnoxious, but not as bad as the ""narration""  (I think it's computer generated).

..Epic FAIL, folks.  If I could give it zero stars, I would!  Wish I could get my money back on this one.",1382659200,36,827,4.3881578947368425
5570028,1,B00BBEFD2Y,"Living in Montana and having seen Yellowstone many times I was excited to have a 3D movie of the sights. Unfortunately I was disappointed after the long wait for this DVD. There are nice pictures in this but most don't look like 3D. The scenes are arraigned so there are no people seen and believe me there are people at these sights. The camera is stationary and there is little depth of field to show a 3D view in many scenes. Some 3D is good but not enough of it. If the camera moved in on the views they would show the 3D better. The music is flute. A close up of a gyser would have been nice and a few people watching would help show depth. Too many mountain views and not enough of the beautiful colorful hot pools. A fly over would be nice.
Maybe they didn't want to get their cameras too close to the steam because it can ruin lenses. This is a Blu ray dvd and can be watched in Blu ray and/or Blu ray 3D. It reminded me of the old 3D viewmaster because most of it is like still pictures but only some look 3D. A panorama would have helped. Too many falls, not enough sights that make Yellowstone so unique. Your best bet is a visit to this beautiful treasure. You can see elk, moose, deer, antelope, wolf, grizzy bear,mountain goat, sheep, marmots, buffalo, coyote etc.in Yellowstone but you won't see them all in this DVD! Don't miss morning glory pool when you go! I give them credit for trying with this film but, not my cup of tea, missed too too much. Watch out for those 5 star reviews from people who have not seen this!!!!!!! Same on their other 3D's!!!!!!!",1382659200,22,1574,4.25

5570035,1,B00BBEFD2Y,"Minus 5 stars, if only it was possible. After watching some of this film I was feeling insulted & getting angry. Before it ended I decided to look up the reviews, OUCH! Having purchased this film strictly for its subject matter and 3D effects, bypassing the reviews, I now know that I was hornswoggled. The one star reviewers are mostly dead accurate. If you want to be entertained by a cartoon voice with a weird accent and strange pronunciations (computer generated), static pictures along with more pics without explanations, & a hideous generic music? soundtrack, then perhaps you will find some humor in it. The 3D effect was very weak, in a word, putrid!
Stick with IMAX or another major studio for proper 3D. Never again will I skip the reviews. Lesson learned!",1420243200,,768,4.7819548872180455

5570041,1,B00BBEFD2Y,This was produced by 4 people according to the credits.  It was worse than watching your coworkers vacation slides.  Worse because the thing is narrated by a foreign speaking person with a heavy accent.  My kids started laughing once he started talking.  It was funny at first; but got quickly annoying and unbearable.  I'm pretty sure a couple of guys just bought a 3D camera and turned their vacation into this work of junk.

Two of the three pictures on the back cover on the case are nowhere to be seen in the video.  3D effects are rare.  English is obviously a second language for the narrator who sounds like a bored flight attendant announcing the rules before takeoff.  And then there is the monotonous and irritating music which makes you wish for ""It's a Small Small World"".",1396569600,,500,4.847058823529411
5570047,1,B00BBEFD2Y,Computer generated voice?  It's awful. Even the 3D effects are underwhelming.  Mute button helped.  Whoever filmed this is a moron.  I could do better with a regular camera.  Where are the animals?  Where are the natural sounds of the geysers?  Where are the people?  I want my money back.,1396483200,,289,4.755102040816326
5570048,1,B00BBEFD2Y,"We waited a long time for this turkey to arrive, and were sorely disappointed in it when we finally watched it.  The narration is done in a droning, German-accented voice.  The narrator sounded as though he would rather be doing something else.  This being one of America's treasures, is it too much to ask for an American narrator?  The music was repetitive and contained a lot of flute and tom-tom sounds.  Paying homage to the area's Native American past is one thing -- this went so far as to be annoying.  Also, some of the park's best features like Morning Glory Pool, the historic hotels, and the major geysers in full eruption are missing.  As others have noted, the 3-D effect is either in-your-face or barely noticeable depending on the scene.  I have seen much more skillful use of 3-D in other productions.",1395446400,,818,4.671328671328672

5570053,3,B00BBEFD2Y,"I had recently explored the park om my motorcycle, so I figured film crew with more access to the various areas of the park would have more to show.  Seeing the Buffalo sorry Bison on the cover I figured at least there would be good coverage of the wildlife that I saw a plenty as I rode thru the park. Nope let down again.  Okay at least they will show the full 90 second run of the Parks main star, Old Faithful, but nope not there.

5570055,1,B00BBEFD2Y,"SHOULD BE ZERO STARS!!!

These 3D blu-rays (also have one out on the Rocky Mountains) are some of the WORST 3D and some of the WORST representations of these BEAUTIFUL National Parks.

Don't CONFUSE this video with the IMAX video about the Grand Canyon (which IS a great 3D video).  You will be DISAPPOINTED if you purchase this thinking you will get a true view of Yellowstone.  I've visited there 5 times and this video has almost NOTHING of the grandeur and spectacular sights you will see there.",1391817600,,499,4.636363636363637

5570061,1,B00BBEFD2Y,"I had five 3D nature movies on my Amazon wish list and my girlfriend pre-ordered them all for my birthday. The movies were: AMAZON 3D - In The Heart Of Wild Nature, ROCKY MOUNTAINS 3D - The Impressive Natural Paradise, GALAPAGOS 3D - Charles Darwin's Big Adventure, GRAND CANYON 3D - The American Masterpiece and YELLOWSTONE 3D - Americas Greatest Wonder, all apparently produced by the same company. After the original release dates for these movies was postponed several times, I finally have received all except for GRAND CANYON. GALAPOGOS and YELLOWSTONE are the better of the four and AMAZON is the worst, but that being said, they are all terrible documentaries. They all come across as being low budget films. It does not seem as if the cameramen in these films put much time or effort into the scenes. It does not appear that they got off the beaten path to get true nature shots, i.e. scenes in the movie AMAZON of a jaguar and a howler monkey were taken at a zoo instead of in the wild. YELLOWSTONE does have some animal scenes which includes bison, pronghorn antelope and elk. YELLOWSTONE also has a scene with a black bear and her cubs, in which the narrator incorrectly identifies as grizzly bears. Other than that, the movie comes across as a picture slide show with a narrator who has a high pitched British accent. The 3D effects are not that impressive. I'm not sure if this film was shot in true 3D. The over dramatic background music's volume is constantly changing from low to too loud. As with all these movies, YELLOWSTONE was shot over a short time period. This being spring or early summer, due the only scene with bull elk are in velvet. There are not any winter scenes etc. Most of all, this movie doesn't even show Yellowstone's most famous icon, Old Faithful. Don't waste your time and money of this film, you will definitely be disappointed. Although they may not be shot in 3D, there are much better Yellowstone films out there i.e. Yellowstone: Battle for Life.",1389657600,,1992,4.661931818181818

5570065,1,B00BBEFD2Y,"I was at Yellowstone in late 2012.  When I saw this DVD for sale I got so excited that I forgot to do the usual reading of the reviews.  That would have saved me some money.  The 3D is the draw card to buying this product, but even that is not that great.  The whole 60 minutes is utterly boring, boring, boring.  It is like a bad home movie taken in snapshot format.  It does not showcase Yellowstone very well and most of the film is the same photos repeated at different times throughout.  Yellowstone has so much to offer and it was very disappointing not to see it in all its glory.  It doesn't cover the seasons which is a shame as it is truly amazing in late autumn early winter.  As for the animals, well don't blink or you will miss them.  I also have to agree with some of the reviews that the narration is robotic and the music back ground became very annoying.  What were they thinking releasing this poor excuse for a DVD.
There are several documentaries on Yellowstone which are fantastic.  Thought this would be a good one to add to my collection, but sadly it is not worth the time.  Do not waste your money.  I have also noticed that there are other DVD's  just released on the Rocky Mountains and the Grand Canyon which look like the same company, so I will now with draw them from my cart.",1388534400,,1308,4.238866396761134

5570067,1,B00BBEFD2Y,I've always wanted to go to Yellowstone. I figured I would settle for a 3D movie until I could actually afford to go. I made the mistake of thinking the 3D film would give make it that much more like I was there. But it didn't. They were all wide still shots that don't take advantage of the 3D at all. The only action shots in the whole film were of some flowers that were in the wind. My father-in-law who loves not only reads or watches some of the most boring documentaries around was having a hard time staying awake. The only thing that kept us slightly entertained was the computer voice they used to narrate the film.,1388016000,,625,4.260504201680672

Ok, short and sweet: Very few animals are shown (Bison, antelope, elk, and maybe some distant bears--the bear they call a grizzly is actually a black bear). Much of the footage are just still shots. The narration is done by someone who is not a native English speaker (I'm guessing Chinese). The 3D was done by a computer and is very poor).

Even much of the filming that actually IS from Yellowstone is fairly amateur. The lighting is wrong is many of the shots. And what you DO see is very ordinary footage. Much of the spectacular of Yellowstone is not included. And, yes I have been to Yellowstone, so I know what is really there. There have to be MANY BETTER videos out there.

The narrator's voice is awful. I never experienced that with a documentary before and the music, you got to be kidding!  How can anyone enjoy a drum beating in the background all the time a video is playing.",1383782400,,509,4.347368421052631

5570089,2,B00BBEFD2Y,"It's unfortunate that 3-D Media seems to be putting out titles which are very alluring, and in which I have high interest but that are produced with quite a lack of skill in 3-D production and even story-boarding. Yellowstone in 3-D? Of course I want it! But, as some others have mentioned, one of the primary and elementary rules of shooting 3-D that I learned in the '50s with my Stereo-Realist camera is that you should have objects in the foreground to accentuate the 3-D. Aside from that, angle shots and other routine photographer and cinematographer tricks of the trade keep visual interest alive, even in a place as surfeited with beauty and wonder as Yellowstone. They  seem not to understand how to use the camera. Similarly, their Papua 3D--The Secret Island of the Cannibals, lacks the same skills and reuses footage in a place where there is so much more to see!

This title is not awful beyond words, it's just a pale shadow of what someone with a decent 3-D camera  and the required professional skill could do in a scenic wonder rife with so much possibility. I won't buy any more of their titles until I've seen a lot of positive reviews indicating they've gone to school and learned how to shoot a documentary.

I won't criticize the narrator, but they needed someone with a livelier voice and an apparent interest in the subject. Perhaps he was lulled into a hypnotic state by the flute and tom-toms that, used more sparingly, would have been quite  effective.

And not to have shown even one eruption of Old Faithful??? Are they kidding?",1383436800,,1557,4.684981684981685
5570090,1,B00BBEFD2Y,"Movie is nothing more than a glorified slide show. The voice over is more like a robot than a person. It sounds like your computer talking to you.

The 3d effect is minimal and trivial to say the least.  Most of the DVD is like static shots of the same sorta boring scenery with a couple of animals thrown in just to make sure you know you are actually looking at a movie VS a screen saver.  And the narrator they choose, to me, sounds like a bull frog with a cold.  The ""AMAZON 3D - In The Heart Of Wild Nature"" by the same company, is somewhat better. Maybe,  two stars for it....",1383177600,,610,4.198275862068965

5570093,2,B00BBEFD2Y,"Imagine a video of Yellowstone without any geysers.  This is it!  Viewing the geysers in 3D would have significantly enhanced the enjoyment of the production.  The scenes of Mammoth Hot Springs are perhaps the highlight of the production.

It appears that the production crew had limited understanding of Yellowstone or perhaps Old Faithful Geyser was on vacation.

A 3D production of Yellowstone should have featured those attractions that include depth, such as geysers.  That is not the case for this production.

A quality 3D production of Yellowstone is needed.  This one doesn't measure up.",1383091200,,596,5.26595744680851

5570095,1,B00BBEFD2Y,"My wife laughed when she opened the Amazon package on October 26. The invoice wished her a ""Happy Birthday,"" which would have been appropriate if this item had been delivered back in JULY as originally promised. Thank goodness this item was only intended as a small ""stocking stuffer"" in addition to her real gift!

After waiting for 5 months we were both highly anticipating a 3D video on Yellowstone, one of her favorite places in the world. Priced at only $13.49 we weren't expecting National Geographic, but we weren't expecting THIS, either! A few of the highlights:

SCRIPT - Not much of a script is actually required for a video like this, but in this case perhaps less would have been more. Why even bother to mention the winter snows of Yellowstone and the park's return to life in spring when your whole video is made entirely of footage that was obviously shot during one single summer weekend?

VOICEOVER - The entire voiceover is done with a strange accent, a combination of British and Slavic (East German? Polish? Latvian?) influences. Or, as someone else mentioned, perhaps it's all computer generated text-to-voice. Bizarre mispronunciations abound throughout. My personal favorites were ""moun-TANE-us"" for ""mountainous"" and ""teaks"" for ""peaks.""

MUSIC - Three or four pieces of low cost stock music repeated ad nauseum over the 1 hour running length of the video. Almost sounds like they dusted off the old Casio keyboard and pressed the ""Demo"" button on a couple of tracks. Honestly, the sound of the wind blowing through the microphone would have been less annoying.

HD VIDEO QUALITY - Most of the shots are of solid HD video quality, but a few shots appear to be dull or greyed out for no apparent reason. Odd.

VIDEOGRAPHY - Almost all shots were taken with the camera locked down, suggesting perhaps the cameraman was using a consumer or pro-sumer 3D camera on which the automatic depth adjustment simply couldn't respond quickly enough for any zooms or tracking shots. To compensate, the video shows the same subject matter several times from slightly different angles or distances. This gets old very quickly.

SUBJECT MATTER - Lots of streams, mud pots, hot springs, wildflowers, mountain vistas. Almost no wildlife except for the occasional fly zipping through the image and a couple herds of sedentary bison and elk near the end of the video. These poor beasts looked almost as bored and confused as we were.

3D EFFECT - Roughly a third of the shots appear to be 2D HDTV with no 3D effect at all. No surprise here, when you're shooting wide vistas where everything focuses at infinity, there's just not enough parallax between the left and right camera lenses to create a decent 3D effect, even when using a stereo base extender attachment on the camera. About another third of the shots appear to have had some crude form of 3D processing performed on them, creating a flat appearance in the middle of the screen and something of a 3D effect around the outside edges. Not so much a true 3D effect, more of a fishbowl appearance. If they were going to do any 3D video processing at all, they should have separated the mountains from the sky; that would have been relatively easy, but instead the sky and background look like part of the same flat, painted backdrop. The remaining third of the shots are close ups of wild flowers, mud pits or streams in which the 3D effect is actually pretty good. And of course, if you can't create a 3D shot any OTHER way, just shoot the waterfall in the distance through some foreground pine trees, that always works.

I just cancelled my order for the Grand Canyon 3D Blu-ray disc produced by this same company (the Grand Canyon disc was ordered at the same time as ""Yellowstone 3D"" and was intended as a small additional gift to my wife for our October 15 WEDDING ANNIVERSARY but is now only scheduled to arrive some time in December). The next time I feel like throwing my money in a hole, we'll just go back to the Grand Canyon in person.

Long story short, don't bother ordering these 3D discs online. If you're still interested just wait for them to show up in the $1 closeout bin at Walmart.",1382918400,,4164,4.731034482758621
5570096,1,B00BBEFD2Y,"My friends and I were horrified at how amateurish this was.  The music is quickly monotonous and it will surely get on your nerves.  The narration would be laughable if it weren't so dull and lifeless.  The narrator (sounding a bit like a computer-generated voice) often gets pronunciations wrong.  At least once I heard him say, ""Yeelowstone"", and that's just one of many examples.  The video, while it looks good, is nothing more than static shots of landscape.  You do get movement within the shots (animals eating in a field, bubbling pools, etc.) but not once does the camera move, so much of the time it's just a few seconds of a near-photograph.  It gets better.  The one thing that Yellowstone is most-known for, the Old Faithful Geyser, isn't even mentioned.

The 3D effects often look good but it's literally like looking at a 3D photograph so you'll get some depth of field but with a non-moving camera, you're not getting what you think you are.

The back of the case lists a running time of 62 minutes when it's actually only 50 minutes.  Halfway through, and it's a chore to finish it, I jokingly said to my friends that this is so embarrassing poor that I was sure several people involved insisted on leaving their names out of the credits.  When it was over, there were only four names in the closing credits.  Four.  Save your money and your time and look elsewhere for images of this beautiful National Park.",1382918400,6,1426,4.629482071713148
5570097,1,B00BBEFD2Y,"I spent 5 summers and 3 winters living in Yellowstone, so I was excited to see this on my recommendations. I preordered in April for an expected May delivery. Instead, I waited until October 25th to receive it. Well, I decided to throw it in and watch it with some friends last night. None of them had been to Yellowstone, and I thought this would be a good way to show them what I experienced. I was sadly mistaken. Very bland videography, and the annoying flute soundtrack became like nails on a chalkboard shortly into the video. In addition, with all the intriguing noises of Yellowstone, the makers of this documentary didn't include a single track of natural sound. I can't believe I bought this, that I waited 5 months to receive it, or that I wasted my friends' time with this garbage.",1382832000,2,793,4.5524475524475525
5570098,2,B00BBEFD2Y,"After watching the Ken Burns National Park series, I was anxious to see the beautiful flora, fauna. and vistas of this park in full 3D.  What we get, instead, is a mediocre video ""slide show""... by that I mean EVERY SHOT is a (frequently dull) static tripod shot.  No panning, no dollying, no zooming.  None of the visual movement that helps make 3D interesting.  If it weren't for the moving clouds, water, and limited wildlife, you'd never even know this was a video. Ironically, the Ken Burns series uses his ""panning photo"" effect to get more movement than this film offers. The 3D, while present, doesn't really add much to this.  Lastly, I was less than impressed with the narration.

After waiting quite a while for this, and putting up with the silly pre-release ""reviews"" about the delay of this release, I was very disappointed.",1382832000,3,838,4.744827586206896

I've been to Yellowstone several times and the pictures and video that I took on my Ipad are ffffaaaarrrr better than those shown in this movie.  The music is extremely irritating, the announcer is hard to understand due to his accent and mispronounces words, and they keep showing the same sequence of still shots over and over again.  I also don't know how you can have a movie about Yellowstone without even mentioning Old Faithful!  I honestly cannot say anything positive about this movie, I will definitely be pursuing a refund on this purchase (which I waited MANY months to be delivered!!) A total disappointment, Amazon should discontinue sales of this item.",1382832000,,789,4.772058823529412
5570101,1,B00BBEFD2Y,"Yellowstone 3D -- Americas's Greatest Wonder is without doubt, the worst movie I have ever purchased -- BluRay or DVD. I've been to Yellowstone over seven times in my life and the splendor of the park is somehow missed by Preston Daniels, the director. The sense I got was that this movie was created by someone who just purchased a consumer-grade 3D camera and pulled off the side of the road and shot footage that was later compiled into this movie. Much of the beauty of the park is simply missing here. Rather than trying to compensate with a first-rate narration we are given a voiceover by an articulate reader who could possibly be a computer-generated voice -- there is no humanity or feeling in the spoken word. But how is the 3D? Terrible. Perhaps this is because most of the shots are wide angle -- there really is no real depth of field. The only time 3D is really apparent is when we see some petrified trees or fallen stumps. Much of the video is over-exposed or with bad contrast.

If I could get my money back I would. I give my highest recommendation NOT to even borrow this movie from your public library.",1382745600,6,1123,4.478048780487805
5570102,3,B00BBEFD2Y,"I'm writing this review from the perspective of someone of who places a great deal of emphasis on 3D.

There a lot of stationary shots that do little or nothing to utilize 3D. It seemed to me the producers would set up a camera, let it run for a few minutes, and then change to another still shot. Were it not for some minor geyser bubbling or wind blowing the grasses, you might think you were watching a still picture.

Also, there is large difference in the loudness between the background the music and narrator, nearly to the point the volume needs to be changed when the voiceover appears.

Certainly the landscapes are very pretty. I feel, however, the film's producers got lazy and relied too much on that rather than finding shots to really make use of the 3D moving picture format.",1382745600,2,791,4.5174825174825175
