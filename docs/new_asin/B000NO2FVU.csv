8179588,5,B000NO2FVU,"I've always wanted memorable Diana Taurasi games, while she was in college at UCONN. This DVD gives you the great NCAA National Championship game from 2004, between UCONN and Tennessee. I've always wondered why Tennessee and UCONN were rivals and now I see. This DVD is one of many that showcases why. For two straight years UCONN beat Tennessee to win the National Champion. I can't put into words how great this DVD is, you get to watch a great game minus commercials. Plus if you miss part of the game or see a play unravel that you think deserves to be seen again, all you have to do is press rewind.

One of my GREATEST purchases!!!",1253664000,,637,4.444444444444445
