8463865,5,B002T4UE42,This DVD is excellent for any size group or individual for singing/music worship. The music is professionally done and the photography that goes along with each song adds to the full worship time especially if you are playing for a group. I like that it has a mixture of popular western praise songs in Japanese and original Japanese songs. Well worth having this in your music worship collection!,1361318400,,397,4.852941176470588
8463866,5,B002T4UE42,"I viewed this for the first time last night and really appreciated it.  A mixture of contemporary western worship songs and some ""home grown"" worship that along with the video images makes for a ready made worship DVD.  And with the Romaji it is very useful. I would recommend it for personal worship or for a gathering of worshipers and can be used for Japanese and English speakers simultaneously.  Excellent!",1360886400,,411,4.8428571428571425
