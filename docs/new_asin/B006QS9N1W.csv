It is a bit raw and uncut in style but I find that only feeds into the energy and plays into the almost-like-you-are-there feeling.  Of the 15 or so surf videos I own this is one of my most-played ""go-to"" flics when i need to unwind.",1486252800,,330,4.306451612903226

8503197,5,B006QS9N1W,"Didnt know what to expect. But overall a very awesome dvd. No real music soundtrack so its very different from the traditional movie. Its literally just video shot from boats and jet skis, you can hear the click of cameras while photographers snap photos at some points. A lot of wipeouts and great footage from all angles. Extremly raw, shows the real world of surfing!
A must own for any true surfer.",1339977600,3,402,4.597222222222222
