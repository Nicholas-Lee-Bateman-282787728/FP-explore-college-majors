Unfortunately, I didn't have a chance to try it for a few months for some physical reasons & when I did, it was disappointing.  I should have known better than to buy a VHS!! I didn't feel it was Amazon's fault I made a bad choice.",1340928000,,369,4.183098591549296
7803699,5,6300167372,"If you are into a good solid workout without the frills, you can count on Jazzercise founder, Judi Sheppard Missett.  Jazzercise Fitness Formula was made in 1987.  With the help of other top jazzercisers around the country, Judi takes you through an excellent program for aerobic toning.
With so many exercise gurus competing for the almighty dollar, Judi's workout aims for quality that includes a lengthy workout(50 minutes.)  The steps aren't difficult and with any new workout, you may need to do the program a few times to follow consistently.
A warm-up that lead into a 25-minute aerobic workout with light cool-down.  It isn't tough, and one instructor will guide you through a lower impact version.
Following that is a muscle toning floor work that concentrates on strengthening inner and outer thighs; abdomen, derriere, etc.  She may lift those thighs about 50 movements each.  One step I rarely see in newer instructors is toning the upper torso with a plain old ""push-up"".
This 50 minute program ends with good stretching and cool-down.  The music is instrumental ranging from few different styles.  I like that other instructors lead the program ntermittently.  Occassionally the skin on Judi's arm looks so darkened; it must be some bad lighting.  The outfits are pleasing to the eye without looking too dated.  It's a good workout!  .....MzRizz",1017446400,18,1359,5.099547511312217
