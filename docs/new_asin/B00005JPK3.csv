1598755,4,B00005JPK3,"Johnny Truelove (Hirsch) is pushing weed to local teenagers and everything seems to be fine in his quiet life till his authority is questioned by a fascist jew(!) Mazursky (Foster) who furthermore is not giving Johnny back $1200 he borrowed. Truelove and his friends then kidnap Mazursky's 15-year-old brother Zack (Yelchin) and hold him as a hostage. Zack is OK with being a hostage - parties, booze, weed and girls are definately better than sitting home with wonk parents. Everybody's having a great time, kids fool around and it seems like we observe ordinary teenagers' life, only sometimes captions appear at the sides of the screen calling every new character number next witness. And it makes you feel uneasy. We know the film is based on true events, hence we know something bad will happen, but till the very end I personally refused to believe it actually will.

Alpha Dog is a movie about a crime which was commited not by some malicious intent, but rather by an absolute bluntness and with a total recklessness of the characters involved. These 20-year-olds behave like small kids - having commited something bad they are afraid of upcoming punishment and descend deeper into crime. They don't believe themselves they're capable to do something terrible and they can't stop when it's not yet too late. They are just a bunch of silly kids hence the outcome is utterly disturbing although we saw it coming.

Alpha Dog is a remarkable film, but to tell the truth - it's overshadowed by such works as The Chumscrubber or Bully. Nick Cassavetes did a great job, but still Larry Clark's movies, for instance, have a greater impact on you. Alpha Dog's impact is based more on the fact that all the ivents shown here really happened some time ago. And I'm sure they still take place in different corners of our world. So it's another flick for you if you want to know what modern youth is. It won't leave you indifferent for sure.",1173225600,48,1935,4.755952380952381
1598756,5,B00005JPK3,"Recently our cinemas have been packed with high concept ""product"" that caters to the lowest common denominator of entertainment and to the least discriminating film goer. What this says about our culture is distrubing at best. How thrilled I was then to see Nick Cassavetes brilliant ""Alpha Dog."" It must have taken guts to make a film this bold and unrelentling. From the opening credits with the late Eva Cassidy's haunting rendition of ""Over The Rainbow"" to the final denouement I was entertained, laughed, cried and moved beyond imagining. Justin Timberlake was very good as was Anton Yelchin. Ben Foster looked like he was living the part of the drug addled Jake. Robert Fraisse's cinematography was stunning as well. Southern California's sun drenched decadence gleamed like a jewel unable to concel the rot at it's core. This is a movie people will love or hate. All the best ones are like that. Nick Cassavetes is taking an interesting path in his work and I'm looking forward to what he has in store for us next.",1171756800,25,1021,4.84
1598757,4,B00005JPK3,"Interesting movie based on the real life case of Jesse James Hollywood one of the biggest young lowlifes you'll ever see. Having seen various news segments on Unsolved Mysteries and America's Most Wanted, I felt I had a decent background on what to expect here. For the most part, it's not a bad movie but it does have a couple of flaws. In the end though Cassavetes does a good job of showing his own interpretation of what happened.

For instance, he uses Bruce Willis and Sharon Stone to play the parents of Hollywood perhaps hinting that bad parenting was a factor in his pathetic behavior. With this I disagree because Hollywood (looking at home videos shown on UM and AMW) really looked like an evil punk. My opinion on this is that it really wouldn't have mattered if he had great parents or not, this idiot would have turned out to be trash either way.

Now, I have to agree with the other reviewers that Justin Timberlake in was great. In fact he's perfect for this role Frankie Ballenbacher. He is brash, arrogant, a loudmouth but can also be serious in his songs and interviews. He plays this role as best as anyone could playing a real punk who thought. He may not have had the lead role in the movie but in my mind he's the one that stood out. Cassavetes changed the names too but he didn't need to do it. Jesse James is called Johnny TrueLove here, and the victim Zach in real life is called Nick Markowitz.

The stories is still the same too, Nick's brother, Ben had a drug deal with Jessie and had a falling out and thus Jessie wanted to collect the money in one form in another. Another thing that the movie shows in consensus with real life case is that Nick Markowitz perhaps didn't take the whole kidnapping thing as seriously as a victim would. He is seen hanging out with Jessie's friends and blonde bimbos. Hell he even tries to pick up the bimbos himself. In all, Nick acts more as a guest than a kidnapping victim. I guess his expectation was that it was all a game and that it would never go as far as it did.

Cassavetes presents Hollywood's hoodlums as the news reports did as accessories to a crime who were too afraid to stand up to Hollywood. It's clear by watching the movie and a couple of the reports that Hollywood wasn't well liked which makes him getting away with the crime at the time equally disturbing. However, for my money I don't feel sorry for these losers since all of them participated in the crime and they all deserve to be in jail.

Summing up then, ""Alpha Dog"" is a decent recollection of the events about the real life kidnapping/murder case of Nick Markowitz. Cassavetes does add some things like the parents interview that adds unnecessary details for the movie and scenes could have been taken out , but I have to say it was a decent movie.",1171584000,11,2795,4.419417475728156
1598758,1,B00005JPK3,"do not wast your time watching this movie is it is very bad, I do not want to write a long and confusing feedback like other people but take my word for it, IT IS BAAAAD",1170633600,11,169,3.7222222222222223
1598759,4,B00005JPK3,"Based on the true Jesse James Hollywood story, writer/director Nick Cassavetes' ""Alpha Dog"" is at least as good as most true crime books in convincingly portraying the triggers that led to the central crime and recreating the atmosphere surrounding events.

  In this case, the crime is the real-life spontaneous kidnapping of a 15-year-old boy over a drug debt, which spirals further out of control, with ruinous consequences for most of those involved.

  Justin Timberlake, playing Franki, Anton Yelchin, as Zack, and Shawn Hatosy, as Elvis, give the movie's strongest performances. For those who are critical of Sharon Stone because they find her implausible, there are such mothers out there, and they carry some of the responsibility for their children's failures, and that's the point.

  As a published true crime author, I found ""Alpha Dog"" extremely successful in blaming horrible parenting and in showing how many people can witness a tragedy in progress without attempting to do anything to stop it. These are facts of real life that happen repeatedly in real life crimes.

  The twist in ""Alpha Dog"" is that when someone actually does half-heartedly try to get help, the parents decline to give it. This left me wondering if anyone would have actually helped in other cases where teens have been criticised for failing to do anything to stop a heinous crime.

  Like many movies, ""Alpha Dog"" makes rampant drug use, alcohol abuse and sex for its own sake look like fun. It would be nice to see more movies evoke the less pleasant consequences of these choices. It would be nice to see these choices romanticized less often, or at least shown more realistically.

  The movie is heavy-handed in places and not all of the acting is especially good but it succeeds in portraying a completely pointless crime and all of the listless, directionless, undisciplined, blind lives surrounding it.

  ""Alpha Dog"" is heavy on drug use, profanity, violence, sex and nudity -- but, then again, so were the real life events on which it is based.

  Once again, it seems that some reviewers slam the movie because they are offended by what it portrays. What it portrays is offensive, no question -- but that's the point. If you don't want to know about the ugliness that sets people up to get more easily sucked into murder than they would have ever predicted, then don't watch this movie or others from the genre.",1169856000,7,2412,4.913366336633663
1598760,3,B00005JPK3,"""Alpha Dog"" is not as bad as I was expecting it to be. Written and directed by Nick Cassavetes, son of Indie maverick director John and actress Gena Rowlands, this film works on some levels and not on others. This seems to be par for the course for this director, who has had mixed success with his films. Best as a visual reenactment of the events surrounding the crime, ""Dog"" tells a shocking story.

The Inland Empire. 1999.

Johnny (Emile Hirsch) is a young hoodlum who runs a drug empire, selling the contraband his dad, Sonny (Bruce Willis) provides. Johnny is building a little empire of his own; owns his own home, has a posse of `friends' who hang around, party and get high, enforces his debts with the use of junior hit men, has a bunch of loose girls hanging around, the like. Dad and Grandpa (Harry Dean Stanton) treat Johnny like the adult he is, prodding him to ""get some tail"" and to forget about his steady girlfriend. Life is too short. One evening, Jake (Ben Foster) arrives, strung out, to talk to Johnny. He is unable to collect a debt owed to Johnny and now Johnny holds him responsible. Jake becomes angry and threatens Johnny. The next day, Johnny threatens Jake's job by calling his boss and telling him about Jake's drug use and the violence escalates. Later, Johnny and his crew, including Franki Ballenbacher (Justin Timberlake) and Tiko Martinez (Fernando Vargas) are driving around and spot Jake's younger brother, Zack (Anton Yelchin) walking around. They snatch him and decide to use him as a hostage, until his older brother forks over the money. But Zack actually enjoys the company of the older guys and goes along willingly and also enjoys the local notoriety of being a hostage. But Johnny doesn't have anywhere to hold Zack and they make the circuit of all of their friends, paying them off in weed and/ or attention. When Olivia (Sharon Stone) hears Zack, her son, has been kidnapped, she becomes distraught. When she learns Jake, her step-son may be responsible, she goes ballistic.

""Alpha Dog"" is set-up as a faux documentary. The film opens with an off-camera interviewer questioning Sonny (Willis) about his son and we quickly learn the real reason behind the events of this tragedy; no parental supervision. As Sonny speaks, we quickly realize he should have been given an involuntary vasectomy. As the story progresses, the various days and times appear onscreen, to help us navigate the events. Also, as new people enter the story, we see their name, and in some cases ""Witness #1"". As the number of characters increases, so does the number of witnesses. If this film presents a fairly accurate depiction of the events surrounding this story, the number of people who participated in the abduction, or saw Zack, or could've helped by calling the police is simply staggering. But considering the fact most of the people are young, frequently high or drunk, and have little supervision and too much money, it is, well... still simply staggering.

Emile Hirsch plays Johnny and he does a good job of showing the character's toughness, bravado and a need to maintain a certain image. He isn't as tough as he looks and uses his posse of friends to make him appear more formidable. Even among his friends, he is more talk than anything else. But he has been exposed to too much easy money and too little supervision, so he runs a bit wild. Naturally, kidnapping the younger kid seems like a perfectly natural solution to his problem; he needs to get Jake to pay him the money he owes; most importantly, to maintain his image, but also because it is a lot of money. Jake is a psycho, so he comes up with what seems like the only plausible solution.

Justin Timberlake plays Frankie, Johnny's good friend. Initially, he goes along with the idea, more out of novelty, but as the situation starts to turn dark, he becomes less interested in helping out.

Shawn Hatosy pays Elvis, one of Johnny's friends, who also owes him some money. Unable to pay him back, Johnny has him perform housekeeping and other chores in his house, in front of their other friends, as a way to demean them. Later, he takes on a job for Johnny, clearly meant to erase his outstanding debt. This is one of the more interesting characters in the story; throughout Johnny and his friends demean Elvis, slinging insults at him, yet he sticks around, so desperate for their `friendship'. When he ultimately agrees to do something for Johnny, it makes sense. His soul is that empty and he is that hungry for attention.

Bruce Willis does a good job of portraying one of the worst parents ever to appear in a film. From his first comments, at the opening of the film, we quickly realize this is not a man we would ever want around our kids. He and Stanton make a good team, quickly illustrating the reason Johnny has turned out as screwed up as he is.

Anton Yelchin is also good as Zack, Jake's younger brother. He feels smothered by his mother, so he actually thrives on being around a group of kids his older brother's age. When they learn who he is, and why he is hanging around, he becomes a sort of mini celebrity. People who are older and probably deemed `cooler' suddenly want to hang around him. It also makes him catnip to a couple of older girls, who clearly are attracted to the young celebrity.

If all of the performances were of this caliber, the film would be a lot better. But then we have Sharon Stone and Ben Foster, both of whom do some serious scenery chewing. Ben Foster plays Jake, the strung out step-son of Olivia, played by Sharon Stone. Foster plays the role broad, very broad. Michael Caine once said if you play drunk, it will look like you are playing 'drunk'. His words are very true, because whenever he plays a drunken character, he seems like a real person who has just had too much to drink. His actions seem authentic. When an inexperienced actor plays drunk, they toddle around; slur their words, bump into things and act like a drunken cartoon character. Foster could've benefited from following Caine's advice. From the moment he first appears on screen, he looks and acts like a ""strung out drug dealer"". He plays the role way over the top. Even when he is at work, he is clearly strung out. When Johnny calls his boss to inform on Jake, we are amazed that his boss didn't pick up on it before he received a confidential call. Sharon Stone plays Zack's mother and clearly dotes on her son, perhaps because she is thankful he didn't turn out like Jake. Before he is even kidnapped, she is way over the top, almost to the point where she might start cutting up her son's food and feeding it to him. Zack rebels by hanging out with Jake and his drunken girlfriend, smoking, hiding a bong in his room. When he is kidnapped, she is naturally distraught, but she almost starts flailing about, her arms waving wildly. These are not subtle performances and bring the rest of the film down.

Throughout the film, various kids go to their parents, looking to talk about the situation, looking for advice, trying to get some help, but they don't get far. One kid knocks on her mother's door, interrupting her having sex with her husband on their anniversary. ""Mom, can I talk to you for a moment?"" ""I just asked for one night to make love to my husband, one f***ing night of the year"" before she slams the door. This is not the only time something like this happens and it only serves to slam the message home; these people need to get some counseling on how to behave like human beings.

This is not a film for immature teenagers to see, despite the appearance of Justin Timberlake, which will, no doubt, draw a lot of teenagers to the box office. There is a lot of material that would be unsuitable for many ages and maturity levels; drug use, nudity, swearing, treatment, violence and more.

""Alpha Dog"" works best as a sort of chronicle of this event, showing the who, what, why and where of the situation. The performances are mixed to adequate, and serve the story, but the two over the top performances by Stone and Foster bring the film down a couple of notches.",1169683200,42,8105,4.605263157894737
1598761,1,B00005JPK3,"Dear Sir:

Your movie ""Alpha Dog"" mixes the very worst of the youth and drug culture into a disgusting orgy of idiocy, sex, and violence.  In a shameful display of anarchistic and narcissistic youth run amok, you have given us quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made.  Since your father, John Cassavetes was an established director and actor; the critical establishment did not check and see if your other movies were ever good.  Not that the ""critical establishment"" has done the American public any favors as of late.  Your cinematic canon has included the instantly forgettable ""John Q."" and the nearly unviewable ""The Notebook"".  This train wreck of a movie is more of the same.  The opening credits of childhood home movies with an awful ""Over the Rainbow"" rendition should put the viewer on notice right away that this could be a long night.  The movies follows a bunch of spoiled kids as they deal narcotics in an operation that an average street junkie or public defender client would critique as ""amateur.""  After some brief character introductions, the movie delves into a kidnapping sequence that degenerates into something resembling a narrative.  I believe there was a part where a crack head/dealer and apparently martial arts expert kicks everybody in a bar, but by that point in the movie, I was concentrating solely on how I could convince the rest of my party to leave, so I'm not entirely sure.  There was also a scene where this same character took a dump on a carpet, but, again, at that point, I was feeling like you were taking a dump on my carpet and the smell was starting to waft into my bedroom.  The story, or lack thereof, according to reports is supposed to be ripped from the headlines about an actual case in California.  Next time, instead of ripping out this headline, rip out your notebook on which you scrawled this junk of a screenplay, and start over again.

You know, Nick, It is fitting that two formerly `good' (and I do use that term loosely) actors, Sharon Stone and Bruce Willis, are at their worst in this film.  It's perhaps justice that these two people should be given a movie like this to work on, being at the end of their sad dead end careers.  Maybe you have a future doing Basic Instinct 3?  You never know.  You could then make the worst movie ever made then, maybe perhaps topping this.  Oh, and here's a hint the next time you make or attempt to make a movie, save the split screen for the opening credits of the Brady Bunch, and try not to pretend like it's a original thought.  You're not adding anything pleasurable to the viewing experience; you're just prolonging the torture.  Oh, and Nick, while you are taking notes, when you are writing a screenplay, try and use a four letter word every other maybe...ummm...5 words instead of every other word.  Without the ubiquity of those four letter words, your movie would be a collection of prepositions.  Now, don't get me wrong, even with that suggestion the viewing experience would be very painful, so the next time that you think of making a movie...don't.  Spare the viewing public your drivel.  The people that spent $ 10.00 of their hard earned money will be more then willing to forgive you.

Unfortunately, your movie is just one in a long line of exploitative films designed for middle class white kids that for some reason, worship ghetto (or inferior) culture.  The best movies that deal with gangs/drug dealers ultimately and I know this is a hard thing to do for Hollywood, make judgments upon the characters they portray.  For some reason, the critics have given you a free pass with this movie.  Perhaps it's your father.  (Hey, if it worked for the chief executive, it will more then likely work for a third rate filmmaker.)  Perhaps its the topic of drugs in this film.  A topic that Hollywood is all to eager to promote, market and sell to middle America.  Hey, I can't complain, it puts a young criminal defense lawyer like me in business.  Nick, look at the reviewers of this movie on a web-site such as imdb.  You can tell by their gnarled syntax and grammar that these are indeed products of our excellent American public education system.  They're the ones writing such memorable lines as ""However, once the movie begins, it doesn't stop until the end.""  They are also the viewers who eat this garbage up like candy.  You and others of your kind may not think you have a responsibility to make good films.  You've been to film school, and you realize, unfortunately, that there is a market for a movie like this.  This market is composed of white suburban kids with plenty of money who tell their clueless and self-obsessed parents that they are going to see ""Happy Feet"" tonight.  So, let this letter be a turning point in your role as a filmmaker, but after you realize this epiphany sitting ensconced high in your resort home in the mountains, please refund my money back.",1169510400,10,4915,4.662020905923345

Alpha Alert is personally one of my all time favorite movies, the story behind it is true and the leader was really on the run for 5yrs until they caught him. I like how serous this movie and the scenes can get it makes you think that anyone of us can walk into this type of situation and no matter what happens and if it doesnt feel that bad like in the kids place when it was going well, he was living it up and having so much fun and who wouldnt if you feel like you're liked by everyone and have friends! but then it comes to what im gonna say you always gotta think what if it ends bad for you and have no choice about it like when they took him into the dessert (no more music video's) That was probably the most intense scene ive ever seen in movie history most of all cuz it actually happened and watching it you get a feeling of how realness it is. This is such a great movie and Anton will be missed forever, he was only about a year older then i am so young he still had his whole life ahead of him.  It makes me sad to know that someone great and with a open personality is gone forever in this world and we'll never see him or in another film ever again. Im sorry that had to happen to him and his jeep rolled back down his driveway and crushed him into his mailbox and security fence, i don't think it was his fault at all and i hope his parents get justice. Im so sorry to them.... I cant imagine how they feel or even dying that way, anyone in that matter. He was just a kid and god took him away from us just like he has to all the great ones. He must've needed him by his side or decided it was his time to leave the earth....he was one of the best people in the world. One day when we all die we will be up in heaven and i hope to see him and a few others i lost that has passed in life. I miss you Anton and will honor you watching and collecting all you're movies.

Embarrassing.  Sufficed to say, he's absolutely great.  Sean Hatosy, Ben Foster, Anton Yelchin and Olivia Wilde are just as great.  All of them wonderfully exciting to watch while, at the same time, true to the world.

And then there's Bruce Willis and Harry Dean Stanton playing scumbags who raise their kids to be criminals-- and you wind up admiring their family values.  They get away with this because there is so much truth in their performances.

Very well cut, more than a little scary seeing such pretty faces replacing the real visages portrayed in the movie, ""Johnny Truelove"" and his cadre were some thuggish looking monsters in real life.

The action is well paced, the storyline is a fun game up until you realize it's NOT going to end well... The aftermath is as gratifying and as horrifying at times as the actual crime committed...",1471996800,,533,4.731182795698925

1599113,5,B00005JPK3,"I put off seeing this movie until a decade after its theatre release because it had received very lukewarm reviews.  I don't understand why it was poorly reviewed; I liked it, especially since it is a true story that appears to follow actual events very closely.  Alpha Dog refers to the main character, portrayed well by Emile Hirch (Into the Wild), who is a 20 yo drug dealer with a Svengali like power over his posse of friends.  I think we are seeing an actual drug cartel here in its rudimentary stages.  A sub-theme of the film is the gamut of male status relations within the pack, from alpha to omega (the Elvis character).

After an escalating conflict with a creditor, the posse kidnaps the creditor's fifteen yo brother to hold as collateral.  Ambiguity prevails, as the youth had been having trouble at home, and as a result somewhat embraces his captivity.  Or perhaps we are witnessing a complex case of Stockholm syndrome.  Nevertheless, the captive is eventually executed, when the Hirch character realizes that aggravated kidnapping carries a potential life sentence.

I found that the mix of sexy characters, glamor, and a glimpse into a certain Cali youth subculture well rewarded the time spent viewing the movie.  Most of all because the story is very authentic--every part rings more or less true--as opposed to certain better received movies such as Room, which to me seemed utterly implausible.",1466380800,,1418,4.920168067226891

These films are of Suburban kids getting involved with drugs, crime etc. This one is based on a true story and is about a small-time ""pot"" dealer played by Emile Hirsch who kidnaps the kid brother of a guy he's having a dispute with over money. The film overall is good enough with good writing and acting but the most lacking element here is probably the most important element in ANY film, THE DIRECTOR. Nick Cassavetes didn't really do much with the material, never showing any ""flair"" for direction resulting in periods of ""choppy"" editing and a scene towards the end of the film with Sharon Stone that's so horrible it should've been left on the cutting-room floor! With that being said the talented cast and compelling narrative keeps this film afloat.

I hated this movie. I can't see what to make out of it. This is merely telling a story but is rather a dramatization of a 1-page newspaper article. I was expecting to see the process leading to the arrests of the perpetrators but it was nowhere covered and the fact that perpetrators eventually got caught was just printed on the screen in 1-2 sentences of text.

There are drug dealers, drama, California teenagers behaving just the way everyone thinks they do, kidnapping, murder, and your typical party scenes. It's not the best movie, the acting isn't superior, and the writing isn't the best out there. What makes this movie worth seeing? The story itself. It makes you think... I cried the first time I watched it. It makes you FEEL, which so many movies these days don't. It's worth watching, it really is. It doesn't have a happy ending, and it's not a love story. If you're looking for those things, you need to look elsewhere.",1394236800,,710,4.642857142857143

The cute scene where the three girls seduce the kidnapped teen in the pool is dark with no images,  I lost interest in the rest of the movie after that.

I gotta say that the main character was extremely foolish and childish and i find it very hard to believe that he got along so well with his ""kidnappers"". It gets to a point when they actually become friends and the kidnappers are surprised as to why they are going to be arrested. This movie is not for kids, it has nudity, sex and violence but it might show a lesson to many teens.

I really enjoyed the actors in the story though. The guy that plays Mazursky hits it out of the park and  Justin Timberlake has turned out to become a pretty decent actor. I recommend this movie a lot.",1386460800,,748,4.413043478260869

I like the Movie, especially Justin Timberlake shirtless. Shawn Hatosy is sexy as the abused and beguiled. Emile Hirsch is amazing; he successfully plays such a different role. The dialogue is a revelatory insight into the airheaded inhabitants of LaLa Land. The kidnapee should have been cuter, since he did not elicit my sympathy. Ben Foster's portrayal of an obnoxious character was excellent; so much so that I could not abide him. Fortunately there was very little Bruce Willis; he wore out his welcome years ago.

1599842,1,B00005JPK3,"Alpha Dog, a 2006 Crime Drama written and directed by Nick Cassavetes, is quite possibly the worst film I've ever seen. For one thing I didn't like or sympathize with any of the characters, not even Justin Timberlake's character, and DEFINITELY not Ben Foster or Dominique Swain's characters. All of the characters in this film are vulgar, violent, cruel, and idiotic, and they, like most films of this type spend most of their time drinking, cursing, doing drugs, and engaging in violent, psychopathic behavior. Forget the whole plot, which involved Zack Mazursky, played by Anton Yelchin, getting kidnapped and held for ransom by Johnny Truelove, played by Emil Hirsch, and his gang. Seeing in how I hated all of the characters, that aspect of the film meant little to nothing to me, except towards the end, when they're about to kill Zack, I kind of felt a little bad for him, mostly because he was so young, but him being surrounded by so much negativity, he probably wouldn't have ended up good anyway. What I focused on mostly while watching this terrible film was the behavior of the characters, which was brutal and disgusting. This movie, which is made even worse by the fact that it exploited a tragic true story, also has terrible acting all around, except for a few rare instances, and I don't even know why it was made and what kind of person would enjoy a film like this. Overall, I'm never watching it again, and I suggest you do the same if you hope to maintain your faith in the intrinsic goodness of humanity. Honestly, I wouldn't have cared if all of the characters ended up dying, that's how much I despised this film. As a matter of fact, if all of the characters ending up dying I probably would have given this film a higher rating, three stars at least. However, I knew that there was no chance of that happening, sad to say. This is one of the few films that made me physically angry, at both the director and the actors, and made me feel ashamed to be part of the same species as them. Does that make me a misanthrope? Possibly, but after you see this film you won't hate me for feeling this way. Thank you for your time, and have a good day.",1361318400,2,2168,4.50507614213198

1599935,4,B00005JPK3,"What I think this movie really does is establish the fact that Justin Timberlake has some acting chops.  While there are other good actors in the movie, it is not overall what I would consider a standout for the acting performances aside from Timberlake, Anton Yelchin, and Ben Foster.  I don't really think that Emile Hirsch worked as a bad ass leader.  He did kind of play him as the guy who hides behind everyone else who did his dirty work, and that part you can buy, but he just did not strike me as a guy that would lead any kind of crew, even the morons that followed him.  The thing you really do get is that none of the parents of the kids (and they were all basically kids) gave a damn about what any of them were doing, and the consequences that followed from it.

The extras on the disc tells some of the true story the film was based on, and has interviews with some of the actors.  It is not extensive, but does add a little to the story.  Overall it is worth the price if you enjoy fictional versions of true crime stories.",1356393600,,1038,4.185929648241206

1600001,4,B00005JPK3,"The first 40 minutes you wonder if they had a budget for lighting. The thing seems shot in houses that cannot afford their electricity bill.

The casting is bizarre with Emile Hirsch being the lead character and the weakest. I just found him and Justin Timberlake (I hope those tattoos are fake as you just come across as a total goof) completely unbelievable in their roles. I'm supposed to think Hirsch is a drug dealer supreme? The guy is just plain wimpy no matter how ""tough"" he tries to act. I'll also add the brother of the kidnapped kid was also not at all believable as a drug addict. He just came across as annoying every time he showed up onscreen and his shaved head just kept reminding me of the Great Gazoo from ""The Flintstones.""

The lucky thing is the story (paralleling the real life SoCal drug dealer Jesse James Hollywood) is riveting. I suppose the first 40 minutes are setup, but it seemed overly long before we got shots outside in the bright sunlight and the kidnap scenario revs things up. The actor that carries this movie really is Anton Yelchin (playing Butch, the kidnapped kid)

The onscreen titles marking off ""Witness #1,"" ""Witness #2,"" etc., actually goes nowhere. You don't need to even pay attention to that as the trials are never shown.

Gratuitous Bruce Willis, Sharon Stone (at her screaming best and with an added bonus years later fat suit on), Harry Dean Stanton and Alan (what?) Thicke.

1600062,3,B00005JPK3,"Director Nick Cassavetes' gritty drama exploring the infamous case of Jesse James Hollywood, named Johnny Truelove in the film, is hit-or-miss. The true-story details Truelove's masterminding the kidnapping and subsequent murder of the brother of Jake Mazursky, the hood who owed Truelove money. Also in the mix are Truelove's henchman Frankie and his admirer Elvis, who may or may not be in love with Truelove. The story plods along with the usual cliches of hip-hop music, drugs, F-bombs, tattoos, fights, and derogatory references to women. We also meet Sonny Truelove, Johnny's Gangster Daddy (Bruce Willis, acting with one eye on his paycheck) and Jake's parents Butch and Olivia (David Thornton - Cyndi Lauper's real-life hubby - and Sharon Stone). This is an ugly movie with a mixed bag of performances. Emile Hirsch as Johnny Truelove isn't quite vile enough as Jessie James Hollywood was reputed to be. His sidekick Frankie, played by a preening, posing Justin Timberlake is just an average Joe. The best performance is given by Stone, unrecognizable in the final minutes of the film as a broken, bitter woman who seems to have died right along with her son. While certainly entertaining, this film serves up empty calories. In the hands of a Director such as Darren Aronofsky, whose dark gems ""Requiem for a Dream"" and ""Black Swan"" are Masterworks, ""Alpha Dog"" could have been much better.",1293926400,,1399,5.086956521739131
1600063,4,B00005JPK3,"I picked this movie up solely because I was interested in seeing something that Justin Timberlake was in.  I didn't really know that he was into acting and I hadn't ever seen anything with him in it and so, I picked this movie up.  I also didn't realize that it was based on a true story until I read the trailer on the back of the DVD.  Once I started to watch it, I thought... oh God, this is going to be awful... but then 'Zach' gets kidnapped and all of a sudden, you remember that this is based on a true story and you start to really pay attention.  And that's a good thing because that's when it pulls you in and doesn't let go until the end.  Clearly, I wouldn't be giving anything away since other reviewers have told how the movie ends, but just in case you don't read any of the other reviews, I won't be the spoiler.  I will say that while the story might have seemed pretentious and unbelievable in its sad commentary on society and parenting in today's world, the fact that in the back of your mind you are thinking that this WAS BASED ON A TRUE STORY makes you really start to wonder about the world we live in.

And while some of the acting of the established stars left a lot to be desired, the performances of the younger less established actors (such as Timberlake and Ben Foster, etc.) were raw and gripping and truly made the story an intense experience not easily forgotten.  When the ending finally came, I was focused like I had not been in quite some time.  This movie left me shaking my head in disbelief on many different levels.

This may not be the best movie ever made and I understand why it was released straight to DVD, but I'm glad that curiosity got the better of me just to see if Justin Timberlake could act (which, by the way, he can) because this is not a movie that I will easily forget... and if you watch it, I don't think you will either.",1293667200,,1881,4.2144846796657385

Both Justin Timberlake and Anton Yelchin, who is turning out to be quite a talented actor, put on good performances.  And Emile Hirsch, an actor I'm not particularly fond of, does a good job with a character that could've become unbearably annoying if done wrong.  Overall, I was very pleased with the pacing and end result of this film, and it's certainly worth consideration for addition to my collection.

As for the quality of the blu-ray edition itself, I didn't notice anything particularly wrong or spectacular about it, but I didn't do a side-by-side comparison with the DVD version and I'm no expert on HD transfers.

1600067,4,B00005JPK3,"Alpha Dog is a movie i ran accross during my begining years in college.  First time I seen the movie, the ending had me a little disturbed.  I didn't really know this was an actual true story until 2010.  I would have to give this movie 4 stars out of 5 and not because of the acting but the story line of the movie, the direction the movie was going.  The movie is cold blooded and crucial, a must see.

Jesse, played by Justin Timberlake was the character with mixed emotions and as a viewer, it kinda toys with your mind on whats going to happen next. His role is very misleading to viewers because he's a good guy who makes bad choices but as time passes by he hints to the the victim to leave but his attempts failed.

I think Sharon Stone did a great job in the movie and had the breakthough role in the movie, a little different from her normal roles.  As noted, the film was somewhat on the dark side but a typical film about rich youth in California.  Though the film brought light to some youth in California not being parented well, the film focused more on the love a mother had for her son.  The ending scene with Sharon Stone was incredible and very underated.  I actually thought that was an interview of the real mother after her issues and trials after the passing of her son.  Olivia, played by Sharon transformed into the mothers image after the depression, stress, weight gain and the many sucicide attempts wearing a fat suit, bursting into tears, speaking out loud to God, wondering why her son is gone. The real mother and family has my prayers because this is a crazy and sad story of how being at the wrong place at the wrong time can go bad and how our actions can harm those we love the most.",1282176000,,1719,4.2746913580246915
1600068,4,B00005JPK3,"Based on the true kidnapping and murder of Nicholas Markowitz at the hands of Jesse James Hollywood, the story behind the Alpha Dog script - which was very well paced - has more resonance than it normally would have. This is a movie for somber reflection, and appreciation of the actors who tackle such difficult challenges.

When drug user/dealer Jake Mazursky (Foster) doesn't pay his own drug dealer, Johnny Truelove (Hirsch), a scheme is devised by Truelove and his friends to kidnap Mazursky's younger brother Zach (Yelchin) as payment. Initially timid, perhaps even scared, Zach soon feels at ease with his abductors, going to parties, meeting girls, drinking, and doing drugs (maybe the beginnings of Stockholm syndrome). The same emotional arc applies to his initially hesitant kidnappers - Truelove and his sycophants - as they realize how serious the situation is, and how much prison time they could receive (i.e. life); yet, they go from party to party with the ""stolen boy"" as others soon call him when he and his situation are basically announced via loudspeaker everywhere they go. The brightest criminals they are not, and groupthink persists.

Meanwhile, Zach's family is desperately trying to find him. His mother and father, played by Sharon Stone and Bruce Willis, respectively, go through proper legal channels. Jake, on the other hand, goes berserk, beating down party-goers, screaming like a madman on the phone. Jake is willing to butcher Truelove and his gang in order to retrieve his younger brother. Eventually, however, the realization that Zach's release could potentially lead to incarceration causes Truelove to order the hit, as it were.

For a primarily dominated younger cast the expectations may be minimal. The acting in Alpha Dog, however, is superb. Headlined by names like Bruce Willis, Sharon Stone (who has an atrocious final scene), Harry Dean Stanton, and Emile Hirsch, but it's a few relative new comers or lesser names end up kidnapping the scenes. Foremost in my mind is Justin Timberlake as Frankie Ballenbacher, who provides a layered, emotional journey through the life and mind of a misguided youth who appears to know right from wrong, but just can't disassociate from the negative element. Additionally, Ben Foster as strung out Jake Mazursky is absolutely entrancing. He owns the character, displaying fearlessness, a manic behavior and crazed mood swings. A stunning performance to be quite honest. Finally, Anton Yelchin as Zach Mazursky provides a much needed softer side, a sentimental edge that makes the tragedy in this movie, and the source material realism, so much more moving. Alpha Dog is a nice surprise, and exposes everything offensive about the criminal and drug lifestyle.

1600114,5,B00005JPK3,"The murder of 15 year old Nickolas Markowitz in the summer of 2000 by a gang of privileged LA misfits garnered national media attention, and with good cause. The circumstances are a modern example of truth being stranger than fiction and the events and characters feel like they could have been torn from the pages of a forgotten screenplay.

Johnny Truelove and his gang spend their days hopping from one party to the next, mingling with the bored and privileged kids of upper-class Angelians. When Truelove is shorted on a drug deal by the unstable Jake  a minor disagreement escalates into a series of increasingly extreme retaliations, culminating in the impromptu kidnapping of Jake's half brother, Nick. Despite having ample opportunities to escape, Nick stays with the group, reveling in his new-found freedom and what he perceives as an exciting, care free life, and ultimately unaware of the fatal conclusion to his adventure.

With the storyline already written for him, all director Cassavetes had to do was get the performances he wanted out of his young cast, which he does with great success. Hirsh's Truelove is a charismatic egomaniac who's psuedo gangster mannerisms conceal a cold and calculating intellect. His right hand man, played surprising well by Timberlake, is affable, cocky and troubled by the notion that he's somehow gotten in over his head. Ben Foster portrays Jake's twitchy, borderline insanity so aptly that he practically explodes off the screen.

AlphaDog received wide critical acclaim, but was condemned by some as being too emotionally detached from its subject matter. Cassavetes offers little in the way of judgment, and chooses instead to approach the story from a neutral, almost documentary-style angle. Some characters, particularly Timberlake's, are cast in a relatively positive light as mere children swept up in situation beyond their control. Nick comes across as having naively walked into the jaws of death, missing ample opportunities to escape and several warnings that his life was in danger. This probably reflects the truth more accurately than your typical black and white analysis of killer and victim, and in my opinion, it is exactly this element that makes the film such a stunning study of how relatively ordinary people can be persuaded to participate in unconscionable acts.

Despite an ending that is preordained AlphaDog manages to hold your attention with excellent performances. Right up to the moment the tek-9 ends his life you can't help but hold on to the hope that the kind and quiet Nick will be spared. Alas, this cautionary tale ends the same way it did in real-life - with several lives ruined and with more than a few nagging questions left unanswered, and one assumes, they will remain that way.",1239580800,,2775,5.116997792494481

Emile Hirsch was absolutely fantastic as Johnny Truelove, and he stole the show with his performance.  But I must say, Justin Timberlake did an OUTSTANDING job as well.  His performance was so believable, that you'd never know in a million years that he hasn't been acting all of his life.

This movie was based on a very compelling, real life story, which made watching the movie even more intense.

1600164,4,B00005JPK3,"""Alpha Dog"" is a perfect companion piece to the equally harrowing ""Bully"". Both films chronicle sordid tales of amoral teenagers living vacant lives filled with the artificial pleasures of sex, drugs, and holding power over one's peers. In ""Bully"", the casualty of wanton violence was a ruthless, sadistic punk. In ""Alpha Dog"", the victim is a kid who doesn't come to appreciate his family until he's immersed in a night of boozing, sucking on a bong, and engaging in casual sex in a swimming pool. Played by Anton Yelchin, he's a nice kid, torn between the overbearing yet moral discipline of his parents, and the neurotic, jittery narcotic overload of his older brother. Much of the film focuses on the kid being held ""hostage"", and the friendship he forms with Justin Timberlake's character. Justin treats him with respect, and the kid responds by trusting him with his life. He even allows Justin to bind his wrists and mouth with electrical tape, accepting this dubious action like a Judas kiss.
  The film is energetic, well-paced, and disturbing. It also has smatters of perverse humor. I think the ending speech by Anton Yelchin sums it up perfectly. He says that he's sick of leading a life where he isn't good at anything. He comes to appreciate his mom, who's ""the bomb"". He's at a turning point, and can choose the right path. Unfortunately, fate will decide otherwise. The parents of most of the film's teenagers are reprehensible; it's obvious the director's message is that screwed-up parenting leads to messed-up kids. Johnny Truelove's dad (played by Bruce Willis) only chastises his son when he does something to threaten the family drug-dealing business. Timberlake's character's father is a drunken womanizer who pulls it together in the morning to go to his suit-and-tie job. His son's work for the day involves pruning the abundant marijuana plants in the backyard. ""He has a garden full of vegetables and spices to eat healthy, but drinks liquor every night and fills his veins with drugs. What a hypocrite"".
  For teenagers to party like this and soak their minds in a cocaine fog means that their parents are not involved. The hard-earned pleasures of sports, playing a musical instrument, or mastering an art are replaced by the glowing rapture of fried brain cells. This leads to poor judgment that can end in murder. Or maybe these kids were just never taught the intrinsic value of human life. That involves parental guidance as well.",1215907200,4,2463,4.942028985507246

It's even better when someone gets the guts to tell that vision. In this case, Cassavetes delivers his baby. I saw this film and had moderate expectations. I was stunned. The movie was phenominal. Not only did Mathew Barry and Nancy Green-Keyes bring in a great cast but Nick Cassavetes brought them to perfection. Everyone from Bruce Willis to Justin Timberlake delivered breakthrough performance. Ben Foster. Emile Hirsch. Everyone. Spectacular. This film was as close to flawless as many films get. Everything from Aaron Zigman's score to Dominic Watkins' production design was marvelous. And if you think the end was harsh, it even adds more drama to your experience and what you thought of the film and helped reveal to you that not everything is Hollywood-perfect. The story is about a group of teens in Southern California who are doing drugs, sex, and having parties all the time. A double-crossing leads to a kidnap that eventually spirals out of control and so the drama begins. On to the extras. Much to my gloom, there is no commentary by Cassavetes or any cast or crew member. Instead, there is an okay making-of-featurette and a witness timeline.

1600167,5,B00005JPK3,"ALPHA DOG, a disturbing film based on actual events, aptly illustrates the fact truth is stranger than fiction.  A novelist would never be able to make a story like this up--or make it come across as plausible or believable.  So because the film is based on a kidnapping/murder that actually occurred, writer/director Nick Cassavetes lets this riveting story play itself out--and fully incorporate a very real human component in the process.

Interspersed with mock-documentary interviews, ALPHA DOG depicts out-of-control teens, punks, hoodlums, and lousy parents.  Johnny Truelove (Emile Hirsch), a two-bit drug dealer, has a problem:  one of his customers, Jake Mazursky (Ben Foster), is a deadbeat addict who simply can't, or won't, pay for the dope he's been getting from Johnny.  And the more Johnny presses for cash, the more Jake pushes back, until there is nothing but animosity and hatred between them.  Opportunity arrives when Johnny stumbles across 15-year-old Zack (Anton Yelchin), Jake's half-brother, and kidnaps him.  The message to Jake is clear:  pay for the dope. . .or else.  Ironically, Zack is completely enjoying his ""captivity"", as Johnny's pal Frankie (Justin Timberlake) has been assigned to show Zack the ropes, and show him a good time while he's at it.  Free from a smothering, overbearing mother (Sharon Stone), Zack is in a hog heaven of his own.

Yet destiny intervenes.  The captors learn they have some serious prison time awaiting them for what they have done; suddenly the urge to ""off"" their captive becomes a viable alternative.  And at this point, the situation begins spinning out of control, as Johnny, Frankie, and their entourage are in over their heads, with very tragic consequences.  The inevitable is very disturbing and painful to watch, but it is also riveting and acutely compelling.

Everything about ALPHA DOG is riveting, from direction to dialogue (which is very realistic).  The large cast excels; Justin Timberlake is surprisingly good; Ben Foster aggressively soaks up the oxygen in every scene he's in (he's over the top in a very believable way).  Veterans Bruce Willis, Harry Dean Stanton, and Sharon Stone appear in supporting roles--Stone (in a fat suit and virtually unrecognizable) particularly memorable as the subject of the mock interviews.  ALPHA DOG is all too tragic, all too human. . .all too real.

I found that interesting.  Although I disagree with their interpretation of Foster's character Jake, which I'll address.

The story, based on actual events, follows a group of suburban kids who watch music videos, act tough, drink 40's, smoke cheeba, disrespect people, and talk shiite.  The leader of this crew is Johnny Truelove played by Emile Hirsch, who seems to get better with every role, and gives his best performance a year later in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Into-the-Wild/dp/B000ZN802W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Into the Wild</a>.  Johnny is a smooth manipulator but gets most of his respect from his family ties, also surrounding himself with idiots doesn't hurt.

In this movie of solid performances it is Ben Foster's Jake Mazursky that steals the spotlight, as he did in similar fashion from Russel Crowe and Christian Bale in the western&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/3-10-to-Yuma-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000XR9L50/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">3:10 to Yuma (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;with his portrayal of Charlie Prince. Amazon describes Foster's character Jake as a scum bag drug addict. I disagree. There is no doubt he has a drug problem, and problems in general, but in a time when most just talk trash, Jake actually follows through.  In some aspects I saw him as a stand up guy, or would be without drugs, and has a fearlessness that other men can respect, under different circumstances he could have been a leader.  Ben Foster does a great job showing rage in this part with words or without.  Justin Timberlake also gives a good performance as the mostly obnoxious, with hints of charisma, Frankie Ballenbacher.

The basic plot is Jake owes Johnny Truelove money.  Johnny tries to disrespect Jake like he does with his other friends, but Jake isn't his other friends, and it continues to escalate from there.  The crew decide to teach Jake a lesson and kidnap his younger brother, whom Jake is close with.  This sets a chain of events sometimes fun and entertaining but ultimately tragic.",1209254400,17,3504,6.646929824561403
1600170,5,B00005JPK3,"This is a film with possibly some of the best actors in the business. Bruce Willis & Sharon Stone as the veterans of the business and Emile Hirsch, Anton Yelchin & Justin Timberlake as the promising up and comers of the movie business.
The main protagonist of this movie is Johnny Truelove, a wannabe gangster from a pretty well off background. He is owed money by a typical scumbag drug addict known as Jake Mazursky. As a form of revenge Truelove, along with friends Tiko Martinez & Frankie Ballenbacher they kidnap Jakes younger brother Zack. This event leads to a matter of different events that none of them had ever expected.

Firstly the Hostage of this movie, Zack (Yelchin) seems more than welcome to being kidnapped by these men and shows that he's fine with the situation. Frankie (Timberlake) has an attack of conscience and knows that the kidnapping will only lead to dreadfull things. Johnny (Hirsch) simply seems to care about one thing and that's getting his money back. While Zack is kidnapped he is shown this privileged gangster lifestyle and he falls in love with it, he becomes part of the gang. On the other hand Truelove & Frankie continuously argue back and forth about whether to let the kid go as to avoid any devastating situations.

This is a surprisingly good movie that depicts the mindset that some of the younger generations have towards life, no matter how privileged their background may be. From the start it seems to drag on non-sensically but towards the middle the plot starts to make sense as it becomes a movie about morals, friendship and trust. The most surprising thing is, is that this film is based entirely around true events which is a bit upsetting but again a true depiction of the lives of some young generations in suburbia.

This is ""Alpha Dog"".

Through all the getting high, delinquent acts, drug dealing, partying and general uncontrolled mischief, the parents are TOTALLY to blame here. It was difficult to watch at times, because it is puzzling to me how long it took before ANY of these ""parents"" decided that enough was enough, and took steps to correct the problem! ILLEGALLY, even!
These are hedonistic fools who have unwittingly created a class of people that have little to no regard for human life or anything else. Watching the film, I was captivated by the absolute disregard each of those kids had for specific things in their lives. Conventions are just something to be either broken or diregarded altogether.

None of these kids give their parents any credit at all, and judging by their responses to this very sad of situations, the parents deserve the level of contempt shown them by their own children.
When the situation escalates, it seems the decisions became more and more senseless and ridiculous. That a 15 year old boy died for a drug deal gone bad is a damning statement of the condition of American Society.

 Remember those kids in Florida in the 90's who murdered one of their own? The film ""Bully"" is an examination of that murder. This ""phenomenon"" is not new. Those kids in Florida had the SAME level of contempt that the kids in ""Alpha Dog"" had.

This film is more a lesson for parents or prospective parents than the kids. Mind you, ""Alpha Dog"" was a CAPTIVATING bit of film. As a parent, it made ME think, and my kids are all grown and making their mark in society in a positive manner. The kids in ""Alpha Dog"" are at least three generations ahead my own, so there are absolute societal differences between them. Yet parenting has NOT changed in the thousands of years we have occupied this planet, so the blame I suppose, rests with the parents here.

Local weed-slinger Johnny Truelove is the diminutive late teen leader of a group of aimless good-timers who together enjoy the spoils of Johnnys illict mini-empire which is supplied by John's dad, Bruce Willis. Like most burb dope dealers, there are debts, problems and grudges. Some of Johnny's debtors become indentured sycophants who do his housework to work off their dope debts. Another debtor bucks on Johnny's attempts at control and his pseudo-crimelord role and causes a beef that culminates in the ""kidnapping"" of the debtors younger brother.

Great look at the lack of (decent)parental guidance and big chested dealer role playing that Johnny painted himself into a corner with and in the end felt he had to live up to.

Emile Hircsh is believable in the title role. Justin Timberlake not nearly bad as expected and Harry Dean Stanton nice in his appearance as Johnny's criminal minded grandpa.",1200787200,,1025,5.023529411764706

The intrigue comes when you realize it was based on true events. You know that names have been changed, but not being from the area and knowing nothing about the case, I didn't know about the outcome. It starts out a little annoying I must say, just kids constantly getting high and cussing a lot. It then climaxes when the innocent brother of our drug dealers rival is kidnapped and then you cant help but watch to see what happens next. Once the drug dealer realizes what the sentence is for just kidnapping the kid and demanding ransom, things get really sticky.

A movie worth seeing, and Justin Timberlake gave a surprisingly good performance. Just make sure you don't cut out before the end. :)",1198713600,,824,4.493333333333333

1600232,4,B00005JPK3,"Surprisingly good take on the true story of Jesse James Hollywood's antics as a suburban drug dealer and his kidnapping a business colleague's younger brother to settle a debt. The names are changed but the story is very accurate. So accurate that the DA was removed from the case because he served as a consultant on the film and apparently leaked several unauthorized documents to director Nick Cassavettes.

The performances alone make this one worth watching. Very strong turn-outs by Emille Hirsch as Johnny Truelove (Hollywood), Justin Timberlake as his loyal and good natured friend, but it's Ben Foster who nearly steals this entire film from everyone. One drawback to the film is that we never have any closure with Foster's character after everything goes down. I think the reason for this is because it is a true story. Another director may have taken a more commercial approach and given Foster a final scene to chew but Cassavettes holds true to the story and instead focuses on the wasted youth and the culture they live. It makes for a compelling argument that we parents who work hard to provide for our children must not forget the moral compass that must be taught as well.",1197504000,6,1191,4.838235294117647

1600234,5,B00005JPK3,"Sometimes a good movie can come out of nowhere and really surprise you, even when you've read the description for said movie beforehand and get a picture in your mind what the plot is going to be like.  Alpha Dog is that movie.

While it takes a long time for the story to eventually get going, the story is about a group of young gang adults who kidnap a younger guy who's part of another gang (two enemy gangs clashing).  Of course, once the other gang finds out one of their guys has been kidnapped, they understandably get angry.  That's exactly what happens here.

The violence is really extreme for the most part.  There's lot of fighting going on ALL the time.  The same can be said for the swear words.  I've NEVER heard so many F words used in all my life (well other than some forgotten movie from the 80's that took place in a city and the guy just walks around blurting out the F word every chance he gets).  Just about every sentence you will hear these extreme swear words.  If that bothers you, don't even think about watching the movie.

But what made the story so interesting was how a good amount of time was devoted on the main characters, so you always know who was who.  When the one guy gets kidnapped, you'll be surprised how he reacts to it, and what happens at the end of the film.  It's based on a true story, and just in case you forget about that, pay close attention to the final 15 minutes of the movie.  You'll be pretty shocked at what you're seeing.

I recommend watching it.  Bruce Willis' character didn't appear often, but just enough to get an idea who he was.  He wasn't supposed to be one of the major characters, so it all makes sense.

Update- February 5, 2016.

I watched this movie again this afternoon and it's STILL really awesome.  I remember how shocked I was with the storyline when I first watched it.  My original review sort of stinks so here's an improved one:

Alpha Dog is about a young teenage boy played by Anton Yelchin who gets kidnapped by a group of violent gang members because his older brother (Ben Foster's character) didn't pay enough money and stirred up enough of his share of trouble just by being short-tempered and always looking for a fight.  One thing that's important to note is that if you're offended by stories that deal with party animal teens, sex and drug dealers, you will not like this movie at all since the story revolves around this kind of content almost entirely.  Keep this in mind.

However for Anton, he's not necessarily upset that he's been kidnapped because he's able to live a life of luxury being surrounded by several hot women (ALL of them hot too, wow!  How many times can we say that about a movie!) including Amanda Seyfried and others.  Little does Anton know that there's a plan to murder him, and the atmosphere and storyline that leads up to the final moments is staggering in how powerful it is.  Seriously you might think a movie starring a bunch of young men involved in gangs couldn't be tear-jerking, but by the conclusion this one most certainly is.  It makes me sick Anton got into a fight with his parents because he started doing drugs and they found out about it and questioned it, so he escapes from his bedroom window to take a walk.  If only that fight never happened he'd have never left his bedroom.

Anyway Justin Timberlake plays one of the nicer guys in the gang for the way he takes in Anton and protects him more so than the other gang members do.  What starts out as a little joke to kidnap this teenage boy so Ben is forced to pay up (much to the face-slapping dislike of his mother, Amber Heard's character) by Emile Hirsch's character, ends up turning serious when other gang members insist on finishing the job.  But Anton... boy does he have the time of his life with the ladies in the swimming pool!  Oh and Olivia Wilde's character... she's just a darn skank!  The words she says while in bed with one of the gang members.  Gross stuff.  I disapprove of her language!  Now her pretty face is forever tarnished because of her dirty words.

Bruce Willis plays the father of one of the gang members.  Interesting David Bowie's ""Wild Is the Wind"" plays.  Great song there, and different from the more rap/bass heavy stuff that mostly makes up the soundtrack.  The most disturbing moment (SPOILERS!) is the mothers reaction at the end... the REAL mother of the teenage boy who was murdered.  The look of anger and sadness in her eyes shows someone who has been through one heck of a horrible tearful ordeal because you can tell she loved her son more than anything in the world, and to have him no longer around you can sense she's mentally and irreversibly destroyed.  Talk about a very disturbing part of the movie, but it's incredibly realistic which is important to remember.  This is a real story being told here.

Highly recommended, but it sure is weird how the cops didn't see the one gang member across the street from the hotel room near the end.  Maybe it was a tricky camera angle and the cops were further away, but the gang member didn't appear to be standing that far away from them.",1196467200,,5124,4.460215053763441
1600235,4,B00005JPK3,"`Alpha Dog' is a film I did not expect to have the impact in which it did.  I expected it to be loud, entertaining and fun, but I never expected it to rip out my heart and depress me.  I think maybe that's because I really didn't know that much about the `true events' this film is based on when I decided to rent this film this past weekend.  My sister had seen it and loved it and said that I had to watch it but refused to tell me much of anything about it.  If only I had read the review on this website then maybe I would have been prepared for what I was about to witness.

`Alpha Dog' follows the kidnapping of young Zach Mazursky (all names have been changed) and chronicles his final days of life at the hands of notorious drug dealer Johnny Truelove.  Zach's older half brother Jake owes Johnny money and with Jake's inability to pay promptly Johnny takes it upon himself to hold Zach as collateral.  What at times seemed like a harmless prank turns quickly into something much more volatile.  As Jake struggles to find Johnny and Zach resides with Johnny's friend Frankie time trickles away until there is no where to go but down, way down.  Zach becomes close to his captors (all but Johnny himself who mostly stays away from his captive) and actually opts to remain in captivity even when given the opportunity to leave.  He's having a good time, rebelling against his restrictive parents, and besides the fact, he loves his brother Jake and doesn't want to cause him any serious trouble.  This was a very unwise move, as noble as it might have sounded at the time.

The film, advertised more like a party film, has its fair share of teen debauchery that is sure to catch the eye of many rebellious teenagers today.  It's filled to the brim with profanity, underage drinking and other forms of substance abuse, sexuality and nudity, but surprisingly none of this is overtly glamorized.  By the time the film is through you realize that all of this, everything you think you want, is nothing more than a show to hide the pain and turmoil that is embodies.  I watched the film with my younger brother who proceeded to tell me that he would die before living that kind of life, which was nice to hear since this is quite frankly the kind of life many youths today think they want to live.  The parties, the booze, the girls...all of it may look appealing but thankfully this movie closely associates it with the horrific tragedy that is the murder of a young life yet to be really lived.

The film has yet another surprise in store for the audience, and that is an impressive performance by pop-superstar Justin Timberlake.  Buffed up and tattooed out, Timberlake embodies Frankie Ballenbacher with such charisma and natural charm.  In actuality he is the only actor in the bunch that I think nailed his performance.  Emile Hirsch tries to hard as Johnny Truelove and it shows.  He looks like an actor trying to act.  Timberlake looks effortless.  There's a major difference.  Anton Yelchin is a little boring for the most part of the film but towards the end he finds comfort-zone, which is good because the final scene between him and Timberlake is all the more heartbreaking with both actors on point.  Bruce Willis and Sharon Stone take a backseat to the youths in the cast, Ben Foster included who continues to prove he is a very talented actor.

In the end `Alpha Dog' is not the film I expected to see, it is a much better film.  It's flawed, sure, but it has a message and director Nick Cassavetes does a great job of delivering it.  Cassavetes has claimed that he was attempting here to showcase how youths will act in ways they believe they are expected to act when pushed into a corner, thus murdering a young kid because they feel if they don't they may be looked at as scared, or even the mere fact that Zach rolled right along with his kidnapping instead of taking advantage of his many opportunities to escape, perhaps thinking that if he were to run then he would looked like less of a man.  What Cassavetes has done here is create a very alarming character study of a certain subculture of youths today.

After watching this film I was prompted to investigate the true events of drug dealer Jesse James Hollywood (of whom Johnny Truelove's character spawns) and I was impressed to see that the events surrounding this film are almost entirely accurate.  Cassavetes did a great job of sticking to the facts, even with the inclusion of witnesses who saw the kidnapping take place.  The film is much stronger than one would expect for it is much more than a teen drama, it is a horrific retelling of a tragedy that rests close to home and is sure to break your heart.",1196035200,2,4691,4.508274231678487

This based on a true story film is a scene by scene chonology buildup of a crime that put a young man on the FBI's most wanted list.  A dispute over money breaks out between two suburbia drug dealers.  Antagonism and violence escalate to areas unexplored by the two sides and one's kid brother gets caught up in the middle.

Review:

The California white boy drug dealer scene is portrayed both glorifyingly and mockingly in this film.  The creative and very effective use of captions under characters provides a sense of foreboding that is especially disturbing given the free-for-all easy party life most of the characters appear to be living.  The movie really explores how exactly such a crime could happen to people who never really wanted it to.  In all those regards the movie has a subtle artistic success but it really is not that entertaining to watch.  The roles of some of the more well known actors are minor and disappointing.  I dreaded watching Justin Timberlake but was surprised with his performance.  I think many  reviewers are reluctant to give a poor rating to a movie based on a sad, true story but I found no reason why this story needed to be made into a major motion picture.

1600271,4,B00005JPK3,"Alpha Dog is one of the better films I've seen in 2007. There is no central character as such but most characters are rather absorbing. Bruce Willis has no role in the film, Justin Timberlake was actually good but the most harrowing of acts was done by a man called Ben Foster. It's interesting because this wanna be of sorts knows he has nothing to lose - his act in the film is great. Ben Foster is very convincing as ""Jake Mazursky"" in this film. He's a little mad in the film, likes to take fist shots at people, will go to any length to procure drugs and to save his job. The girls in the film hardly mattered but I liked the mother who slaps Ben Foster. There are a few scenes in the film which will made me raise my left eyebrow. The end made me go gulp. Alpha Dog is worth watching - it's a pretty good tale of how things go wrong and is reminiscent of films like Juice, 11:14 and Bully - while definitely being better. Where Alpha Dog loses out is at not being as consistently forthright at ""Running Scared""

Nonetheless Alpha Dog alongwith ""Black Snake Moan"" is one of the best films I've seen this year but ""Zodiac"" remains on top. Watch this and look out for Justin Timberlake.",1186963200,,1189,4.261061946902655

1600273,4,B00005JPK3,"The trouble is that Emile Hirsch isn't up to being the ""alpha dog"" he's supposed to be playing, he's an interesting actor but he's no heavy, not even close, and his silly sideburns make him seem like he's playing in a comedy.  It's like asking Jason Schwartzman to play the Al Pacino part, Jason's great and all, but he doesn't have the range, and neither does Emile Hirsch at this point.

Justin is perfectly fine as Frankie but his performance is sort of like what Dr Johnson said about women preachers.  Like a dog walking on its hind legs, it is not done well, but you are surprised to see it done at all, so you give Justin more points than he deserves.  Actually he went through the whole movie with the gravitas of Russ Tamblyn in WEST SIDE STORY, and he resembles Tamblyn down to the natural grace and the shifting, loping walk.  A few bars of ""Gee Officer Krupke"" would not have been out of line for Justin as ""Frankle,"" Johnny Truelove's right hand man.

What other reviewers have said here is all too true, the film is often very well done, but after BULLY, why make what is essentially the same film all over again?  And why put Lukas Haas and Shawn Hatosy in the same parts they've been playing for the past 15 years?

It is based on true events.  In the L.A. area, drugs, drinking, and sex is running amok and Justin Timberlake is in it.  He is actually a pretty good actor. He can swear a meanstreak!  There is wayyyy to much swearing in this movie. I don't think there is more than 20 seconds of dialogue without a curse word coming out of someone's mouth.

This is an insane film!  To think this is all true.  Well, I'm sure there was some embellishment.  A kid is 'stolen' because his psycho punk of a half brother owes someone money.  It takes awhile to get to that point, so the beginning sort of falls a bit flat.

At the conclusion, there are holes.  Well, one big hole but I am not one of those reviewers that spoil it for others.

If you like fast, swear filled films with lots of drinking, drugs, fights, and sex involving young beautiful people, this is right up your alley!

1600346,4,B00005JPK3,"This isn't a great movie, but it is a pretty good movie--even if the acting is uneven and the plot meanders quite a bit.  But it's certainly an interesting movie that's worth seeing.  It probably even merits multiple viewings and I could see it becoming a cult film that's loved despite it's flaws, much like The Boondock Saints or pretty much every film directed by Robert Rodriguez.  It's not that the plot is that similar, it's just that the film has a similar feel.  There are moments here that really work if you ignore the ones that don't.

As far as plot, this movie is based on the true story of Jesse James Hollywood, the youngest man to ever end up on the FBI's Most Wanted list.  I don't think the director had any desire to make a message film--he was just attempting to tell the story of an interesting guy in a quirky, sometimes funny way.  The movie is worth your time because the story is interesting--and odd.  The main character, a small time criminal, kidnaps someone after a money dispute, yet the victim has such a good time partying with the gang that he never realizes the eminent danger of the situation.  Throughout the movie you see Zach, the kidnap victim, enjoying his time in captivity as he goes to parties and meets girl, while his captor becomes more unstable.

This movie has several recognizable actors in small roles such as Bruce Willis, Sharon Stone, Lucas Haas, Alex Kingston, and Harry Dean Stanton (along with other cast members from HBO shows like Ben Foster and Amanda Seyfried).  Even the immortal Alan Thicke was brought in for about six seconds of screen time.  The main character is played by Emile Hirsh, and he does an adequate job, although he seems a little uneven at times.  Also uneven: Justin Timberlake, who seems to be doing a Jamie Kennedy style thug impersonation in parts of the film.

Ben Foster is the real scene stealer as the drug crazed Mazursky,and while other reviewers have said he was over the top, I found him quite convincing indeed. Like Kids,and Bully,the message is a strong one and makes parents like myself wonder just how much we really know about the lives of our teenagers when they are away from home.

1600349,4,B00005JPK3,"Although many of the actual names and locations have been changed for the movie, Nick Cassavetes' ""Alpha Dog"" tells the largely fact-based story of a particularly heinous homicide that took place in Southern California in the summer of 2000 (changed to the fall of 1999 for the film).  The crime involved a group of young drug dealers who kidnapped, then eventually murdered, the 15-year-old  brother of a fellow drug dealer who owed the ringleader money and who, largely out of stubbornness and pride, refused to pay up the debt.  After the discovery of the body, most of the perpetrators were convicted and sent to prison, but the mastermind, Jesse James Hollywood (called Johnny Truelove in the movie), managed to flee to South America where, in 2005, he was eventually arrested and sent back to the States to face trial on the charge of murder-in-the-first-degree.

""Alpha Dog"" provides a grim, depressing look at the dark underbelly of American society where amoral, disenfranchised and disaffected youth play life-and-death games with drugs and guns, often with tragic consequences.  In the case of this story, what begins almost as a spontaneous lark suddenly turns into deadly serious business as events begin to spiral further and further out of control and the story races ever more rapidly to its pre-ordained and inexorably tragic conclusion.  Cassavetes has written a tight script that captures the fast-paced, drug-soaked milieu in which these young people do their ""business.""  Yet, even though a number of the boys display a callous disregard for life, there are others who see the wrongness of what they are doing but who, through fear or misplaced loyalty or simply a belief that things ""would never really go that far,"" fail to put the brakes on the whole sordid affair before it is too late.  It is in that context that Truelove relinquishes his role as the main focal point of the film in favor of Frankie Ballenbacher, a cheerfully sardonic wise guy whose job it is to watch over the boy while Johnny figures out what next to do with him.  As Frankie becomes more and more attached to the kid, it becomes harder and harder for him to comply with Johnny's ultimate order of liquidating him.  Frankie, thus, becomes the emotional buy-in point for the audience, even more so than the kidnapped boy himself.

There are fine performances by Emile Hirsch, Shawn Hatosy, Ben Foster (""Six Feet Under""), Bruce Willis, Harry Dean Stanton and Sharon Stone, among others, but it is Justin Timberlake, as the high-strung but basically goodhearted Frankie, who walks off with the film.  In his every moment on screen, the charismatic Timberlake brings an intensity, shrewdness and liveliness to his performance that bodes well for his future career in movies.

In his direction, Cassavetes generates a starkness of vision and moodiness of tone that are greatly enhanced by the brooding, darkly-lit camerawork of French cinematographer Robert Fraisse.

The movie has a few weaknesses.  The faux-interview scenes, which Cassavetes periodically interjects into the film, don't do much to enhance the storyline and succeed only in confusing the audience and interrupting the action.  Moreover, the ending comes upon us much too abruptly, depriving us of a sense of completion and catharsis, particularly in regards to Frankie's apprehension and feelings of remorse over what he did, as well as the older brother's reaction to the discovery of his sibling's body.  And there are sporadic rare moments, mainly in the early part of the film, where one gets the sense that the cast members are ""playacting"" rather than truly inhabiting their parts.  But these impressions are few and very fleeting and, for the most part, the actors do an admirable job of conveying the down-and-dirty reality of the life they are portraying.

""Alpha Dog"" turns the spotlight on a subset of society we may not want to admit is there but which nonetheless exerts a tremendous negative influence on all our lives.  The film serves as both an alarm signal and a wakeup call that we ignore at our own peril.",1179532800,,4086,5.016272189349112
1600396,3,B00005JPK3,"Watching Alpha Dog reminded me of the Larry Clark films like Kids or Bully and others like Havoc where we see just exactly youngsters are doing when away from parents and not being given enough ground rules and restrictions. Problem is that a lot of it seems kind of phony and a little off-the-mark, like this is just what adults think youngsters are actually doing rather than what they really do. Sure a bulk of them swear and smoke, drink and have lots of sex but it's presented like this came from someone who grew up in the 1950's and the idea of a marijuana-smoking kid is just the worst thing possible. The film has the right idea but like those other films, it just doesn't quite get it.

Based on the real story of Jesse James Hollywood, the film tells the story of Johnny Truelove (Emile Hirsch of The Girl Next Door), a young drug dealer in L.A with a small entourage (including Justin Timberlake). When a local named Jake (Ben Foster, Angel in X-Men 3) can't pay Truelove an amount of money, Johnny takes initiative and kidnaps Jake's younger brother Zack but instead of Zack hating it and being held against his will, he actually embraces the lifestyle. But things get out of hand and pretty soon something tragic happens leaving everyone around Johnny affected.

First, I'll start with the acting. Hirsch is actually quite good at playing Truelove, a kind of ""talk big but can't back it up"" kid who has to have people around him to show off how tough he is. But for people, the big question mark is Timberlake, since he was an Nsync member and seems to want to be the next Michael Jackson but here he's actually quite good, playing a character who's both clueless yet seems to be the only one who has a conscience and good sense around him. The rest of the acting is alright but no one really stands out. Ben Foster almost overacts the whole thing and screams his head off and Sharon Stone does the same thing. We get familiar tv faces from the shows Angel to Veronica Mars to Joan of Arcadia.

The story itself is at times interesting but in subtext terms, it's seriously lacking. This is one of those films where the message is ""lots of kids are messed up"" but it never says just how these kids got to be this way and if there's anyway to remedy this. Do we just hope as in Timberlake's case that they will eventually realize their wrong ways or are they just like Zack, so caught up in the glamour of drugs and the girls who think it's ""cool and sexy"" that you're kidnapped that you don't realize what you're doing until it's too late.

It's not really a bad film by any means but as a study into the youth of today it falls flat and as entertainment it passes, but just moderately.",1179014400,2,2699,4.402805611222445
1600397,4,B00005JPK3,"While Hollywood has always done a great job at bringing fiction to life,what is always remarkable is to see a true story be turned into a film. No matter what kind of story or film,true stories deserve to be documented in a film,with a lot being learned as a result.

One of 2006's most successful films,""Alpha Dog"",is proof of the paragraph above.

Here,""Alpha Dog"" documents everything that lead to Jesse James Hollywood becoming one of the youngest men to ever appear on the FBI's ten most wanted list. Writer/director Nick Cassavetes does this by taking the true event and turning it easily into a plot. The plot is about a teenager named Jake Mazursky(Ben Foster),who has been hanging out with the wrong people and making the wrong decisions in his teenage years. Time after time,Jake has been able to be saved and take the easy way out. But one day,Jake Marzursky finds himself not to be so lucky. Things,regularly,would not be so bad. But,when the drug dealer that Jake Marzursky owes money to,Johnny Truelove (the Jesse James Hollywood character,who is portrayed by Emile Hirsch with suspense and knowledge)kidnaps his step-brother Zack (Anton Yelchin),will Jake be able to take the easy way out again,or has his wrong decisions lead to things going too far this time around? There are only two things that will tell--time and how important decisions are made.

While ""Alpha Dog"" may not earn Oscars,on the whole,it is a really good film. It does a good job at covering the whole Jesse James Hollywood case-being accurate,while not telling the whole case like a novel. With his direction of ""Alpha Dog"",Nick Cassavetes does a strong job at telling viewers like it is. This is by Cassavetes throwing in a lot of suspense and not allowing his film to become an episode of ""Unsolved Mysteries"" or ""America's Most Wanted"". At the same time,""Alpha Dog"" does a good job at getting a message out to its viewers of all ages,and does not contain what it gave it an R rating for the sake of it. It contains what gave it an R rating to show what the lives of the teenagers that the Jesse James Hollywood case and ""Alpha Dog"" revolve around,in a manner that works for what it is and does not go overboard. A lot of powerful acting is also to be found here in ""Alpha Dog"",which is a large contribution as to how this film turned out to be as good and successful as it did.

Overall,a film that does a perfect job at covering one of the worst and saddest crimes ever to be committed,and works well as both a true story and a film. Go into this film being prepared and having an open mind,and you will find yourself enjoying ""Alpha Dog"".",1178928000,,2630,4.6373390557939915
1600398,2,B00005JPK3,"If a movie can't find something interesting to say, then it should at least be interesting to watch.  ""Alpha Dog"" is neither.

I don't fault the film for having absolutely no likeable characters.  The world is full of unlikable characters (I may even be one of them), and as this particular movie is based on a true story, it's not a surprise that most of the people we get to watch are irresponsible and self-absorbed jerks.  (And no wonder: they all live in Southern California.

Teasing!  I'm teasing!)

Anyway, the story's pretty simple.  We have an underaged drug dealer, Johnny Truelove, whose authority is questioned by a strung-out customer, Jake Mazursky.  Johnny has none of that, so he throws him through a glass table and then through a glass patio door.  This, understandably, upsets Mazursky, who breaks into Johnny's home several nights later, smashes the place up, and befouls the rug.  Things are escalating, you see, which is what things tend to do when you are simultaneously young, dumb, doped up, and handed far more freedom than you deserve.

The movie doesn't really get going until Johnny makes a spur-of-the-moment decision to kidnap Mazursky's younger brother, Zach, and hold him hostage until the drug debt is paid.  Zach, in spite of the many chances he has to escape, never does.  Why?  Well, he's fifteen, surrounded by free booze, drugs, and hot underaged girls who think it's ""cool"" that Zach has been ""stolen.""  Is this the message that Cassavetes is trying to convey?  That the younger generations willfully and ignorantly embrace their own destruction?  If so, I would encourage the filmmaker to stick with acting.

Because, aside from the ultimately gruesome nature of the conclusion (let's not call it a surprise; every character that appears on-screen who isn't a part of the kidnapping is given a number and labelled a witness), this is a story that has little to recommend it.  Most of the flick is obviously slanted toward a demographic that wants to live vicariously through the music video lifestyle depicted on-screen.  Copious amounts of drugs, tanned teens in too-short shorts, and fresh-faced Zach wandering through it all with a dopey smile on his face, amazed at his luck.

I'd give the film one star for it's ludicrous attempt to be important (I'd happily debate anyone who claims the movie has any kind of serious or worthwhile message), if it weren't for the pretty decent acting.  I can't believe I'm saying this, but Justin Timberlake as the well-meaning but mostly-moronic Frankie is the real stand-out here.  (My only real problem with the actors was Ben Foster, who overacts so much I have to wonder how many blood vessels the fellow popped during filming.)  Even the filming itself (aside from the flawed and unnecessary split screening) isn't half bad.

Alas, that doesn't make it good.  Decadence and decay are truly film-worthy subjects, but slapping them silly with the harsh smoke and glittering poolwaters of a SoCal home, reflecting them off of the dull and moist eyes of stoned kids and ignorant lap dogs, well, it smacks of exploitation to me.  When all was said and done, I never got the impression that ""Alpha Dog"" condemns the excesses of youth as much as it thrives on them.  At the risk of sounding pompous, if I didn't learn anything from ""Alpha Dog,"" I doubt any of its younger viewers will walk away enlightened, either.",1178928000,9,3395,4.896672504378284
1600399,4,B00005JPK3,"Following up his directorial debut ""The Notebook,"" Nick Cassavetes directs ""Alpha Dog"" a disturbing crime drama, which is more than slightly reminiscent of Larry Clark's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bully/dp/B00005U14H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bully</a>. The movie is, essentially, an independent drama but received a wide release since Justin Timberlake is in it and his album ""FutureSex/LoveSounds"" was at the top of the charts when the film finally got distribution. It didn't do well in the theatre, hasn't clicked that much with audiences, but it is a pretty good film.

Emile Hirsch (""The Girl Next Door"") plays Johnny Truelove, a big-time drug dealer in the Los Angeles area who spends his days dealing, smoking weed, and partying with his friends. When speedfreak Jake Mazursky (Ben Foster, 'Hostage') neglects to pay back his debt to Johnny and then beats the hell out of him, Johnny responds by kidnapping Jake's kid brother Zack (Anton Yelchin, 'Hearts in Atlantis'). This is not your average kidnapping. At first, they hold him by force, tying him up and such. Soon, restraints aren't necessary and Zack becomes more of a friend than a hostage. While it's Johnny who is established as the main character, it's Frankie (Timberlake) that takes over that role after the kidnapping. Zack begins staying with Frankie, as his brother Jake desperately searches for him, and suddenly begins having the time of his life. Smoking weed, drinking, having sex with girls... Nothing if off-limits, until Johnny discovers that he could be facing life in prison for kidnapping.

It's this turning point that really throws the film off. Cassavetes chose to shoot this scene in a weird, heightened sense of visual reality. Like we're seeing it through the eyes of someone tripping on 'shrooms. This throws off the whole mood of a scene that could have been both haunting and disturbing.

My second biggest complaint about the film is the acting; a majority of it is good, but a lot of it is flawed. First off, Yelchin is believable as the victim but he's kind a very annoying, high-pitched voice. Hirsch is not believable at all as this character because he looks like the kind of kid that got beat up in middle school, in the end this works though...Cause that's pretty much who the character is. Timberlake, however, surprised me. I wasn't expecting much from him for one reason...I've heard him sing. How could a guy that reaches new heights of falsetto in some of his songs (i.e., ""My Love"") possibly be believable as a gangster? Well, he pulled it off. Timberlake is more than decent as an actor and gives one of the best performances in the movie. The real star here is Ben Foster. While some could say his performance gives new meaning to the term ""over-acting,"" it's still absolutely brilliant and he keeps your eyes glued to the screen whenever he appears.

The plot of the movie is tragic, but a newspaper article about it would probably tug at your heartstrings more than the film does. No one can say Cassavetes can't make a good film though, but, after all, he was born into the industry. His mother is actress Gena Rowlands and his father is John Cassavetes, one of the most acclaimed writer/directors of all time. Cassavetes does make some solid points in his scripts about parenting and the stupidity of this crime and his direction is good (except in that scene I mentioned above), but he just missed quite a few things that could have made this film rise from ""good movie"" to ""masterpiece."" I think a lot of people who aren't expecting much from this film will be pleasantly surprised though. If you are looking for a film based on a true story that really packs an emotional wallop, I'd say ""Bully"" is more your speed though. Also, look for some interesting acting bits by Bruce Willis, Sharon Stone, and Harry Dean Stanton, who steals every scene he's in.

1600400,4,B00005JPK3,"ALPHA DOG is a strong film that reminded me of a film called BULLY that was similar, but not given much publicity. ALPHA DOG seemed to me to be a more commercial film that got more publicity and had big stars like Bruce Willis & Sharon Stone giving it clout.

That isn't a bad thing. ALPHA DOG is a frightening film based on a true story and its greatest gift is its closeness to reality and how kids go through life thinking with blinders on. They don't see the big picture. They don't realize the consequences of their actions from minute to minute. Everything we do has an effect and repercussions. Teenagers have an aura of invincibility. In the case of ALPHA DOG, we get to see those aura's exposed.

The only thing that I was disappointed with was the absence of Jake Mazursky (Ben Foster) from the end of the film. He was probably the most interesting character in the film. He walks through the movie with an unabashed intensity that explodes at will. After he walks into a party looking for his missing brother and ends up introducing a slew of party goers to his black belt, he is pretty much gone from the film.

Although I do realize that the movie was based on a true story, so inserting him in the end would have taken away from the truth.

Fortunately though, this movie is given its life by Nick Cassavetes' screenplay and direction, a solid young cast (including a solid performance by Justin Timberlake) and a solid veteran cast.

Alpha Dog is a really good film and a lesson in life and its undeniable consequences. Not to mention, should be a wakeup call to all parents who don't know where there kids are at night and the things they could be getting into.",1178496000,11,1677,4.449511400651466

The director really made you like him and you find yourself hoping that they let the kid go but knowing the true story it makes you queasy knowing what lies ahead for the poor kid. If you had no idea about the true story you would think Timberlake would of let the kid go at the end and then the good ole happy ending comes true.............nope!

Speakings of Justin Timberlake, I can't stand his music (makes me puke) but his acting skills are incredible! I saw him in Edison Force with Morgan Freeman and I was impressed with him then.

1600404,4,B00005JPK3,"ALPHA DOG is a tough movie to watch and to review.  The story, in part because it is true, is repugnant, and the slice of life in 1999 in the San Gabriel Valley, California is disturbing to the point of nausea.  But this heinous kidnap/murder of a 15-year-old kid by his peers is captured in an intense manner by writer/director Nick Cassavetes  in the way he has cast, directed, and propelled this story of the infamous Jesse James Hollywood to the screen. It is tough to watch but it needed to be put in front of us to make us examine current parenting/adolescent dysfunction and the possible results.

The story is so well known that summarizing it is most likely unnecessary. Cassavetes uses the superimposed documentary technique to validate the times and the characters involved in this crime ridden case.  The true problem begins with severely dysfunctional parenting and extends into the drug and alcohol abusing, moneyed by crime, irreverent amoral teenagers driven by greed and lack of self discipline that results in the wasted death of a kid who happened to be the brother of one of the troubled, drug addled teenies: a 15-year-old was kidnapped and murdered for a bad drug debt of $1200.!  The cast is strong and includes Emil Hirsch as Johnny (the Alpha Dog), Justin Timberlake, Shawn Hatosy, Fernando Vargas, and Vincent Kartheiser as Johnny's 'gang'; Ben Foster as the addicted debtor whose brother Anton Yelchin is killed; and Bruce Willis, Sharon Stone, David Thornton, and Harry Dean Stanton as some of the severely dysfunctional parents.  They make a fine ensemble cast, especially the despicable characters they are asked to portray.

The language is wholly gutter oriented and becomes tiresome - just like listening to it on our streets.  Cassavetes ends his film with a survey of the consequences faced by each of the characters and that helps bring closure to an otherwise difficult bit of history to swallow.  If only there were some hopeful solutions for changing this type of behavior given, but then that might have blunted in impact of the film.  Grady Harp, May 07",1178323200,,2094,4.903682719546742
1600405,4,B00005JPK3,"The movie is based on the true story of the kidnapping of Zack Mazursky (Yelchin) by ""drug dealer"" Johnny Truelove(Hirsch) and his ""posse"".  The basics is that they kidnap the 15 year-old kid so that his older brother pays up the 1200 dollars he owes Truelove.  But the whole plan goes awry and Zack ends up being killed.

In itself the movie isn't that original.  It's themes we've already seen a million times : the disenchanted, bored youth who play drug dealers in California.  But what makes this different is that it's a true story, and that fact alone turns the movie into a dark, almost horror, story that ends up haunting you and staying with you long after the end credits.  This actually ends up saving the movie from itself, not turning it into another one of those horrible laugh-out-loud movies like ""Havoc"".  What helps is also the opening credits, where when you reach the end you end up asking yourself ""how did they get from there to here?""

The acting is average.  It's not bad but there aren't that many great performances.  The breakout star in all of this would probably have to be Justin Timberlake who shows he can act and gives an emotional level to the story, without which the movie would be doomed.  I think most of it has to do with the script though, because you seriously have to wonder if they actually talked like that.  Sharon Stone is also fairly decent as Zack's mother, that is until the end.  Another honorable mention would have to be Ben Foster who just chews up the script.

But as Bruce Willis' character so insightfully points out, this movie is really about parenting...bad parenting at that.  It's another movie that shows what happens when the parents don't give a damn and let their kids run all over the place and do whatever they want.  But throughout the movie I also really wanted to slap the kids for taking stupidity to a whole new level, which is frightening considering it's based on a true story.

The only other negative point about the movie is that it runs about 15 minutes too long, with Sharon Stone's last scene that fails to inspire compassion and sadness at the whole situation and ends up being just ridiculous.

On the whole it's a decent movie worth seeing once and that won't leave you indifferent.",1175558400,60,2266,4.5945273631840795
