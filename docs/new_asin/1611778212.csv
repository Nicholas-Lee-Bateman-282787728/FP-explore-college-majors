7800367,4,1611778212,"good documentary on the abuse of pharma and the medical industry. bombard your doctors with questions. ask how much knowledge they have on the pills and the condition they are prescribing them for. it is your health, your life they are playing with.",1378771200,,249,4.813953488372093
7800368,1,1611778212,"This is absolutely nothing other than Scientology propaganda; The founder of CoS was a genuine huckster and charlatan not to mention a nut case in need of the very thing he eschewed...psychiatry. The CCHR is just a front group (better termed a hate group) as they try to portray psychiatry as the cause of all the problems that ever plagued mankind including, but not limited to Nazism, drug abuse, on an on. I can accept that pharmaceutical companies are overzealous in their advertising and promotion of their psychotropics, but there is a place for the use of these medications for some individuals. If you have a true mental disorder or a child with ADHD, why would you shun conventional treatment for ""organized fraud"" as France has deemed Scientology? At least begin with legitimate scientifically based treatments and not the science fiction of e-meters and people with no real training.",1331510400,7,894,5.006711409395973

7800370,5,1611778212,Wow... this was incredible... probably the most moving/heart-rending/poignant documentary I've ever seen. Parents everywhere owe it to their kids to see Matthew Steubing's story. All the other mothers featured here also had some incredibly touching and unique stories. And the interviews provided by the various experts is incredibly informative. If you enjoyed CCHR's other documentaries you will be blown away by this one!,1292457600,4,424,5.746031746031746
