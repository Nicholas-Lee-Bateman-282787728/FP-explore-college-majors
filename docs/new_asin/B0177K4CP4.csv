Very good.",1477353600,3,157,3.787878787878788
7491005,5,B0177K4CP4,"I have loved this series since I first saw it back in '96.  I remember when it ws first released on dvd, but didn't have the money to get it as the time. I've collected the first two seasons over the last fifteen years, but this one ad always been elusiuve.  Finally though, I found it (at a decent price too!) It was worth the wait.  I was surprised by the slim package I received since both other seasons, and the picture are the bigger fold out boxes that give each disc its own spot.  However, once I got it, I proceeded to watch the full series from beginning to end for the first time in 20 years.  It was worth the wait.",1475625600,10,627,4.065040650406504

7491012,5,B0177K4CP4,"5 out of 5 stars
Why season three of this show is so hard to find is beyond me. This was the lowest price I could find that would play in North America. I panicked a bit when it arrived because the package is the Australian package, not the one pictured, but it is still in the proper format for viewing in North America so I'm very happy.",1451260800,19,339,4.0

7491017,5,B0177K4CP4,"Note the cheaper version of this is NOT made by Sony Entertainment.  It's an ""import"" and the run time is 960 minutes.  The Sony season 3 has a run time of 971 minutes.  Not sure what you miss in that 11 minutes, if anything?  Does anyone know?",1490140800,,244,4.127659574468085

8738230,1,B0177K4CP4,"The description in the ad says these are for ALL REGIONS...  Opened up my box from Amazon today, excited to have finally found all three seasons of Forever Knight... the first 2 seasons I bought are region 1 like they should be... this season, season 3 says REGION 4 on the DVD CASE!! This would be fine if I lived in Australia! But I live in the middle of the USA! Region 4 DVD's don't play on my DVD / Blu-ray player! Not a happy camper...",1528070400,,441,4.127906976744186

Be aware this DVD is Australian Region 4. It will not play on U.S. DVD players, however I am able to play via the programme 'VLC-Player'
on my PC. And via my now region free Philips Blu-Ray DVD player I have. (Thanks to a friend de region-coding it) so no real harm done, this is NOT a region free DVD as it says in the product review.",1527897600,,475,4.163043478260869

8738236,5,B0177K4CP4,Third season of Forever Knight is incredible we lose some characters but we gain new characters. An incredible way to end and incredible TV show it is very sad but it is very understandable how the show ends in the last episode this will always be in my top 10 greatest sci-fi horror television shows.,1503792000,,301,4.490909090909091
