5581818,5,B00BDZV4OW,"Amazon has pulled Vol 2 only stating that it is under review due to some possilbe problem. This Vol 2 was shipped to me before it was pulled. I have just finished watching ALL 5 discs, & found NO problem with Vol 2. All 5 discs played, no clitches, freezes, sound problems, incorrect episode listings, etc. By incorect episode listings, I mean that every episode is different, what is listed on the back of the box is the same as listed on back of the dvd case, & the same is listed from the menu on the tv screen for the appropriate disc. For some reason, Amazon saw fit to pull this dvd set, but didn't feel it necessary to say exactly what the problem was. I found NO problem with the set I received. As far the series itself - the only thing I can say is that this is/was one of the best tv series EVER. I thoroughly enjoyed watching these ""old"" episodes, revisiting the way things used to be. Just think, no sex, no cursing, just fast moving action with almost always great acting. Unfortunatley, they don't make them like this anymore. I would recommend this series to anyone that is tired of the ""crap"" on TV these days. Very enjoyable stuff.
 UPDATE: The problem has to be the packaging. Vol 2 has 3 DVD's stacked on top of each other, on a single central hub. The DVD's tend to come off the hub & get scracthed. However, the Vol 3 I received has the same problem, possibly the DVD's are even looser than the Vol 2 set. Vol 4 has the same 3 DVD's stacked on a single hub, but the hub is different & the DVD's don't come off to get scratched. I also got this same loosy packaging with Vol 2 of Bat Materson.",1367020800,21,1614,4.2064516129032254
5581819,5,B00BDZV4OW,Excellent! The audio and video is first rate. Season 1 was so good that I was afraid season 2 would not measure up- good to be wrong sometimes! The stories are believable and the actors generally also. Great to see the 50's cars and styles! You NEED this!,1367020800,2,255,4.333333333333333
5581820,5,B00BDZV4OW,"Along with Seasons 1, 3, and 4, season 2 gives me a complete set of Highway Patrol episodes. Besides being a great and entertaining show, this series is like a historical time capsule for California. Many of the scenes were done on location in various parts of California. They used parts of unfinished highway, back roads, parks, all of which look very different today.

Broderick Crawford was a fine actor who made the show convincing and compelling. He was rough on the bad guys, gentle with the children and got frustrated with citizens who got in the way of his work.

Television was still fairly new when this show was on and it is interesting to see how the cast members were used. Some actors would play a 'good guy' in one episode and a 'villain' in another episode. It is my opinion that Hollywood was building up its pool of available actors for TV roles and Highway Patrol gave the actors an opportunity to showcase their acting abilities.

If you are a serious Broderick Crawford fan, you will definitely want this and the other seasons in you collection.

Happy viewing everyone!",1366761600,2,1093,4.677083333333333
5581821,5,B00BDZV4OW,"After a short wait, these releases are finally showing up, and like Sea Hunt better late than never! I'm very happy with the picture quality which compares with Season 1. This is a much better set, from the price to the production. I got hooked while watching season 1, it's addictive like Mathew's habits. The crimes also seem to be more intense in this season, and Mathews has already shot a bunch of bad guys! The episodes continue to get more and more interesting. It's amazing the stuff they get into, and even Stuart Whitman shows up as a patrol officer in season two. Amazon has put a hold on this item, I wonder why? I have watched the first disc of season 2, and it froze when I selected one episode. I reloaded it, and then it played just fine. One other episode it froze a little during an unimportant scene, but continued playing. The problems were pretty minor. I'm still enjoying the heck out of the set, their not ruining my fun!",1365552000,8,944,4.431034482758621

5581823,5,B00BDZV4OW,"I remembered this show as a kid growing up and how outstanding they were, and have been watching on Hulu the episodes from season 1. Each of these season 1 episodes was terrific, and I could not wait to see the remaining seasons. I was floored when these became available on Amazon, and ordered seasons 2, 3 and 4 immediately. I simply cannot wait for the delivery. There will be a total of 117 episodes (3 seasons of 39 each), and I plan on going into hibernation when these DVDs arrive. Once again, I cannot wait.

5581824,4,B00BDZV4OW,I took a gamble on this show a couple of years ago and ordered season one unknown and considering I am not from the era that this show was produced I was to say the least mightily impressed with just about everything about it! How a show of such high quality has been forgotten by my generation and younger is unthinkable and having viewed each episode at least twice through I sincerely believe that this is one show that demands to stand on the collectors shelf with any collection of cult tv. I am sorry I cannot review  season two yet as it has just been listed as a preorder but the excitement that I  feel tonite knowing I will get a further fix of this wonderful show from a bygone age is delighting me down to my old boots. Read the reviews for season one as I did but take the plunge as this is one cop show that stands out among many many others which have been falsely sold to us as better! An excellent way to spend half an hour after lunch or supper. Cant wait to own every season.,1361232000,40,994,4.1450777202072535
5581825,5,B00BDZV4OW,"This is a classic show from the 1950's. Tough guy, Broderick Crawford, plays the role of Dan Matthews, head of the Highway Patrol. Although they never actually tell you where the show is taking place, its obvious that it's in California. As a matter of fact, during the early seasons of this series, the patrol cars were actually borrowed from the California Highway Patrol, making it all the more authentic. During latter seasons, there was some type of dispute with the C.H.P., and they stopped loaning the cars. If you look closely, the cars that they used during those seasons, had trailer hookups on the back. These were used to transport the filming gear from site to site.

It's great watching this show in black & white, as it seems to add more authenticity to the contents. The stories are fantastic, and I believe that they're loosely based on real life events. It's nice to see the bad guys caught at the end of each episode. It's also nice to see the cars from the 50's in their original condition.

Each episode lasts a full 25+ minutes, as there were fewer commercials during this relatively early era of TV. The bottom line is that Highway Patrol is the genuine article. Don't miss it.",1480464000,,1200,4.629107981220657

I removed it and put it into a different DVD player and the same thing happened; freezing after the first two episodes.  I then flipped the disc over to see two extremly obvious scratches.

5581915,5,B00BDZV4OW,"This is Season Two of Highway Patrol ,starring Academy Award winner Broderick Crawford. Crawford had a long and varied career in Vaudeville,the stage,radio and in films,all before 1940!During the war he was heard as part of Glenn Miller's broadcasts from Harvard University as part of the Air Technical Training Command,doing short skits for the Army Air Corp to bolster enlistment./49 saw him grab an OSCAR and then in /55 he was offered a part in Highway Patrol. Still making films during his time on Patrol,the grind of churning out the TV shows took its toll on Crawford. His voice can be heard to be quite raspy at times and he looked tired.(This may also be due sometimes to his drinking).
Season Two starts in 1956 and goes to /57. Crawford always had a by-line at the end of each show. This Seasons lines were:It isn't the car that kills,its the driver and Leave your blood at the red cross,not on the highway. Crawford had a distinctive rapid fire delivery and as a result the pace of the show was notched up all due to him. This led to a fast editing which in turn started a new industry standard. Stars in view this season include,Bing Russell(Kurt's father),Ruta Lee,Gene Roth(3 Stooges),Ed Nelson,Bowery Boys alumni Stanley Clements and Bobby Jordan,Rhodes Reason(This Island Earth),Barbara Eden(I Dream of Jeannie),Stuart Whitman,and Harold Goodwin, who appeared in many of Buster Keatons films,spelled here Herold,among others. One writer to become really famous was Gene Roddenberry(Star Trek) and later TV producer Quinn Martin is here as a sound supervisor.
The discs come in two keep cases,one with three discs and one with two. All are one sided. Both are in a thick box. The shows themselves have been transferred,like Sea Hunt,with great care and look as if they were filmed just yesterday. Beautiful to look at.
There are a few sound drop outs throughout this series and this season is no exception. I can only imagine the audio tracks were  slightly damaged over time.
All in all it is an absolute delight to see these fast paced wonders back on the small screen for everyone to enjoy again. They look even better than I recall,and that's not having seen them since their debut on a small,snowy b&w TV set. Thank you MGM and TGG Direct for releasing them.",1395964800,,2279,4.843589743589743

Broderick Crawford plays Dan Mathews, the superintendent of the presumed but never identified California Highway Patrol.  Mathews drives around from post to post solving crime, usually with a uniformed trooper in the car with him.  The 50's nostalgia is great; the locations, the cars, clothing, etc, but the show gives a highly unrealistic view of what the Highway Patrols actually did.

The show itself, is a tough, gritty, realistic, and true-to-life depiction of how the police in those days of the 50's, cracked cases and tracked down criminals.  Crawford is top-notch as Chief Dan Mathews, who's rapid-fire dialogue and sharp intellect leads his division of the Highway Patrol.

5581937,5,B00BDZV4OW,"First of all this is a snapshot of American history. This was one of the very first TV shows to realistically depict Police depts across the nation.

The shows as all well done and fairly straight forward narratives. Obviously there wasn't a lot of time to get cute plus that just wasn't done in the 1950's. Since the show was hemmed in by the fact each show had to involve the Highway Patrol they did a real good job varying the stories as much as possible.

Broderick Crawford was a pretty good choice for the head honcho of a police dept. He set the right tone for the entire series.

It was also very interesting to see the old cars and dress of the 1950's.

I would rate this a very solid 3.5 to 4.0 out of 5 stars. Recommended for 1950's fans, old car fans and Broderick Crawford fans. And it won't hurt that this show will have activate a  lot of memories of watching this show with long gone parents, etc.",1387152000,,913,4.254335260115607
5581938,5,B00BDZV4OW,"Best show ever. Really great if you enjoyed looking at classic cars from the 1950s. They are all brand spanking new. And the best part is you could read up on the show on the Internet, like the star of the show doesn't have a drivers license, which is why you never see him driving on a real city street. He is an alcoholic, which is why he always has cuts and abrasions on his face , from bar fights",1385337600,,400,4.0125
5581939,5,B00BDZV4OW,I have beem a Broderick Crawford fan all my life. No actor makes a better tough guy cop. I watched these shows as a child and loved everyone of them.,1380758400,,149,4.0

5581942,5,B00BDZV4OW,"Highway Patrol was one of the early leaders in the cop show genre.  As kids we were glued to our small screen black and white TV sets 5 nights a week without fail. As I recall, it was one of dads favorites too.  Although pale by comparison to today's high tech computerized cop shops, it was one of those classics that will always be remembered.  Much less violence compared to today's blood and guts shows but for that time it was a thrill to see old Brodrick in his big old Buick chasing the bad guys.",1379289600,,503,4.21875

5581966,5,B00BDZV4OW,"What can I say? I'm back to Sunday evenings more than 50 years ago watching black and white tv. My friend Johnny Hill and I had a couple of Corgi Highway Patrol police cars (one was a Chevrolet Impala. Can't remember the other one). We would set up road blocks and 'transmit' to each other 2150 to 2646, 10-4 etc. Brilliant.
The DVD is of very good quality and was delivered promptly in excellent condition.
My only criticism is that more than one dvd is put on a holder. Makes getting them out more difficult than it should and increases the chance of scratching a dvd.",1377648000,6,570,4.386792452830188
5581967,4,B00BDZV4OW,"1950's syndicated TV at its best!  Very low budget and every show is almost the same but really fun to watch. Crawford is very entertaining and some of the smaller parts are played by actors you will recognize. ( Stuart Whitman is a regular.) I didn't find any packaging problems referred to in other reviews.
This show made ""10-4"" a catch-phrase !!",1374624000,2,349,4.629032258064516

5581969,5,B00BDZV4OW,"All your favorite classic cars, and they were NEW.  The quality and clarity of these classics is really incredible.
Crawford tries so hard to be a bad-a**, but spends most of his time looking at maps and figuring out road blocks
on what appears to be an Oregon map.  What is noticeable  is that the policy of ""shoot first"" , ask questions later,
appears in every episode.  But if we could just go back in time and buy a car or two.",1373587200,3,431,4.219512195121951

I had to get the first set replaced. The packaging allowed the disk to release from the spindle and it scratched itself during transit. The underside of the disks looked like it had water spots, so maybe the first set had some manufacturing difficulties. The replacement set plays fine.

5581994,5,B00BDZV4OW,"I use to watch this show when I was a kid. It does bring back memories. The stories don't always hold up and the acting is suspect at times. The car is never described as a Ford, Chevy or a DeSoto, but a sedan or convertible. The police radio communication always ends with a 10-4.  However, it's fast paced and captures the 50s culture with the clothes,vehicles,store fronts,etc. Broderick Crawford who won an Oscar for All The King's Men is perfect for in the lead role. My wife, who's normally not a fan of black and white TV, has gotten hooked on the show. The quality of the picture is very good. It doesn't have any extras but each season has about 35-40 shows, so you get your monies worth. Give it a try, I don't think you'll be disappointed, 10-4.",1372032000,2,756,4.361702127659575

5581999,5,B00BDZV4OW,The quality is great. I had no issues with the package and the cd's are not scratched. A few shipments may have a packaging problem but not mine.  Arrived quickly. The shows are fun to watch with the old 1950's cars. Liked it so much that I ordered the next season.,1369612800,,265,4.196078431372549
5582000,5,B00BDZV4OW,"Early TV thrived on clichs-bad guys were bad, good guys were good, and this series is about as black and white as you can get. Broderick Crawford as Highway Patrol Chief Dan Mathews is a total tough guy-he talks so fast you would swear he was still in Brooklyn. The episodes are formulaic, but ultimately satisfying, the good guys ultimately triumph, but the bad guys give it a good shot. The period American atmosphere, and the excellent voiceover make this great entertainment for nostalgia buffs, and those who want to know what it was like to live in early postwar America.  Take special note of how smoggy the landscape is, there is never a clear day in 1950's Southern California.",1369526400,2,686,4.716666666666667
5582001,5,B00BDZV4OW,"An excellent series in its day and thanks to this DVD release, the excellence lives on. What a fabulous show. I'd only seen a few episodes until now & they were of inferior print quality. The quality of these DVDs is as good as you could hope for and they are the full length, at just over 26 minutes each. I've already bought the Sea Hunt & Bat Masterson ""gift boxes"" from this company (TGG Direct) & they are equally good. So thanks to Amazon for offering them at a good price & TGG for releasing them. I've become quite an admirer of these shows produced by Ziv Television & look forward to further releases from the Ziv archive (i.e Ripcord on 6th August, which I've never seen, but will buy in any case).
My only worry was that the first two discs jumped off the spindle in the mail and arrived badly scratched. Fortunately, they played without any problems. If the packaging can be improved to prevent this happening, my 5 star rating is well-deserved.",1369267200,4,958,4.448863636363637

5582023,5,B00BDZV4OW,"The quality of the DVDs, the stories, the acting, the old cars, trains, buses, motorcycles and helicopters are even better than I remembered. Highway Patrol might be the best syndicated series made in the fifties. The writers wrote excellent episodes each week, using many actors who would go on to fame and fortune....Stewart Whitman, Ruta Lee, Robert Conrad and Peter Breck, to name a few.

5582025,3,B00BDZV4OW,"There is only a note on the Amazon page for volume two with Amazon saying they are currently reviewing packaging problems. I had loose discs in both seasons two and three. The problem is that one of the volumes in both seasons stacks discs on a single tall spindle. The bottom disc may stay in place, but the top two can easily come loose in shipping resulting in scratched discs. I haven't opened season four yet, but I don't hear loose discs rattling around the way I did the others. This is a manufacturer's packaging problem, and I don't see anything Amazon can do to fix it other than refund your money. This will have to be addressed by the manufacturer and the packaging redesigned or everyone who orders this product is going to get the same problem.
Final rating:
Series : 5 stars
Packaging on DVD set: 1 star

problems during attempts to play in a DVD player or a PC DVD drive.
As far I am concerned there is no room in my collection for these inferior products, many from the Warner Archive series.
I would advise other would be purchasers to steer clear of all 'manufactured on demand products.'
Another issue is the time delay for delivery of made on demand products. Why should I have to wait a month
for this inferior rubbish?
I just ordered 'Dr. Kildare' season one which is also made on demand and requires weeks for delivery.

When seasons 2 , 3 and 4 came out , I was a little concerned that the video quality wouldn't be as good because these seasons were going for about the same price as the bootleg copies on the big auction sites .

I must say that Broderick Crawford really makes this show.  He is perfect in his role and, for such a big guy, moves swiftly with grace and purpose no matter what the scene. And boy can he drive!  It was known that Broderick had a tendency to get 'lubricated' as often as possible and it was a chore for the set director to keep him focused.  Maybe that's why he races through his lines in most every episode I've seen. The stories overall are a bit lame but it's interesting to see all the old cars and the fast driving and of course Mr. Crawford.

Did you ever notice that there wasn't any more plot with the hour show than the half hour show?  Highway Patrol with Broderick Crawford was a classic.  It was made by ZIV Production Company, that also did Sea Hunt. They got it all done in half an hour. So, if you are a little short on time, dig out Highway Patrol and watch for half an hour.

8566785,5,B00BDZV4OW,"Having seen Broderick Crawford play so many villains in various Film Noir performances, I almost threw my shopping cart placing arm out of joint when I realized he did this series and that you could get a box full of episodes for so little loot.

Sure, some youngsters will say ""ew, icky, they're in black and white"", but that is a PLUS in my book. Having watched the whole of season 2, I can't remember the sun shining in one episode, so maybe they had to film under the gloom due to budgetary/lighting circumstances, but again, this just adds to the mood of the series.

Somewhat like his above-mentioned villain roles, Mr. Crawford plays his Police Officer here so serious and inches away from flying off of the handle at the merest discrepancy that - at times - it becomes amusing (others may not see the humor in this, and certainly the criminals portrayed in each episode do not appreciate it one bit).

Each episode brings us a new crook trying to pull a fast one, but big Dan Mathews is not having any of it, and his impatience shows that he is not a man to be trifled with.

That said, I can't recommend this box set of Season 2 enough, the entertainment level is long-lasting, and the visual aspect of the crisp cinematography (or televisiontography perhaps) will keep your eyes healthy like a soothing medicine.",1507075200,,1322,4.565400843881856
