I have watched this video over & over and can  not get enough of the wonderful sounds of each gospel artist in this  movie.... From the Mighty Clouds of Joy quartet sound,to the grand finale  in the end with Walter Hawkins and his group... this is a must see video...  James Cleveland, Shirley Ceaser and The Clark Sisters each prove that they  rule the gospel circuit in male soloist, female soloist and female group  category respectively.

1706796,5,B0000648YL,"Any Music lover will love this DVD it captures a unique musical moment in time, now gone. Shirley Ceasar is one of the greatest singers to live. Her performance is just overwelming. She is captivating and charismatic and what a voice. Her nailing of her band member to the mike stand as if it was a cross is just classic. The whole DVD can be watched over and over. It has a soul, R & B, 60's & 70's flavor to the music even though it was recorded in '82 at one of the most beautiful venues in America, the Paramont Theater in Oakland. The audience is also another performer on this DVD. Their reactions and participation bring the show to another level. All the performances from beginning to end are great. Rev. James Clevland, Walter Hawkins, The Mighty Clouds of Joy, and particularly the Clark Sisters are just awesome. All legendary performers in an unforgettable performance. The ""Gospel"" DVD is one of my favorites and very worth getting.",1301529600,2,946,4.603550295857988

This is a Spirtit-filled high-energy event that is a must own for any fan of old fashioned gospel music. One high point of this concert is the Mighty Clouds of Joy featuring the late Paul Beasley on lead vocals performing the gospel standard ""Walk around Heaven"". This dvd is well worth the money.",1294531200,,607,4.735849056603773

I caught this special briefly on PBS while in college about 15 years ago.
I rushed to my VCR, recorded it & watched it repeatedly.
It then knawed at me for a long period of time until I recently found it on Netflix & am now purchasing it on Amazon.  Ill be ripping the audio tracks to play on my iPod.

All I can say is these performances reached out & touched me.
I was & am moved by the spirit, sincerity & strength with which these songs are performed.
Its beautiful, what a gift for us!",1294012800,,499,4.081632653061225

1706804,5,B0000648YL,"Awesome!! I saw this as a teen when it first came out. I loved it then and more so now, because so many things have changed over the years. If you've ever been to a ""santified"" church, this will bring back those memories. It will take you back to sitting in the pew with a church fan from the nearby funeral home fanning like crazy 'cause it's hot and sticky, but you don't want to miss anything, so you sit right where you are. Or if you remember the 'midnight musicals' during the convocations...you will love this.",1181520000,3,517,4.34020618556701

1706806,5,B0000648YL,"From the locomotion meter of The Mighty Clouds of Joy singing ""I Came to Jesus"", and Edwin Hawkins ""Negro spiritual"" flavored ""Goin' to a place"" and their classic 70s style ""Right On"" complete with fist pumping; what words could I ever use to entice gospel music fans to buy this DVD? This is no Hollywood reenactment my friend, this is the REAL THING! Shirley Caesar singing ""No Charge"" will have tears running down your cheeks, and you can almost see the Holy Spirit descending like tongues of fire on the Clark Sisters as they sing ""Is My Living In Vain?"" The Rev. James Cleveland sense of humor is fully on display with quips like ""Never shout without your money cause everyone around you aint saved ya know"" and a hilarious duel between him and the drummer ending in a truly inspired closing shot. I was raised Pentecostal listening to these artists, and until this movie, have never seen anything that came close to capturing what I experienced as a young man. If your idea of gospel is Whitney Houston in ""A Preachers Wife"" or Whoopi Goldberg in ""Sister Act"", you owe it to yourself to scroll down and buy this movie, then come next Sunday, go to church yourself. Can I get a witness??",1170633600,7,1192,4.574766355140187
1706807,5,B0000648YL,"This filmed performance of a Gospel Concert in Oakland, Calif. in 1982 is an absolutely flawless document of what this music is all about. No narration or explanation is necessary. The Mighty Clouds of Joy live up to their name with the classic ""Walk Around Heaven All Day"" and Walter Hawkins amazes with an accapella singalong with the audience on ""What A Friend We Have in Jesus."" As for James Cleveland, the Clark Sisters, and Shirley Ceasar (who I saw perform once in Charleston, SC), what more needs to be said? Just get it and put it on during an otherwise sad day.",1150156800,5,571,4.553398058252427
1706808,4,B0000648YL,"To my ears, some of these gospel songs in here, all sung by black performers, are unbelievably good and or brutally horrible. It depends where you are coming from, what kind of music you like and what you are used to hearing in church, I suppose. For me, a middle-aged white guy, I love the rockin' toe-tapping fast songs. Man, if those songs don't get your blood going, check yourself into the nearest funeral home. The slow songs....well...just not my cup of tea.

So, the songs I loved here are ""Came To Jesus"" by The Mighty Clouds Of Joy; ""Until I Found The Lord/Right On"" by the Walter Hawkins Family; ""(This Joy)The World Didn't Give It To Me"" by Shirley Caesar; ""Hallelujah"" by the Clark Sisters, and ""Can't Nobody Do Me Like Jesus"" by the Rev. James Cleveland. There is one slow song I liked: ""What A Friend We Have In Jesus"" by Hawkins.

Those fast-moving songs in here are so good that they more than make up for the lesser ones. The concert ends on a high note and a fun note as it appears the song is over several times but it isn't as the drummer refuses to leave and keeps going! That obviously is staged, but who cares? It's fun to watch. The audience is fun to watch, too. They really get into it. So should you!",1145318400,11,1228,4.334782608695652
1706809,5,B0000648YL,"I grew up watching this video and to my surprise I found it at Blockbuster.  I could not believe it.  I have been watching it for the last two months regularly.  This concert was blessed by God almighty himself!  I imagine that as they performed he was in Heaven throwing down, because you know God can outdance any of us.  My favs:
The Mighty Clouds of Joy-Walk Around Heaven (I forgot it was them and thought it was the Temptations for a second.)
Shirley Caesar-No Charge (No one can tell a story quite like Shirley.
Walter Hawkins & Family-EVERYTHING!!!  Their musicians were amazing.
The Clark Sisters-EVERYTHING!!!! It should be illegal to sing like that!
James Cleveland-EVERY SINGLE SONG!!!
Excellent must have for any true lover of gospel.  I know a lot of people don't enjoy older gospel as much as the new stuff, but I can bet any amount of money that the stuff people are listening to now can be traced back to these very artists.  I have heard so many remakes of these songs form the newer artists. Much respect.",1074643200,33,1024,4.587912087912088
1706810,5,B0000648YL,"This video is a marvel. Any fan of soul music will surely appreciate WHERE people like Sam Cooke, Wilson Pickett, Marvin Gaye, Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin etc. received their inspiration and training. And that is from gospel music. This tape is one incredible performance after another that is both entertaining and very moving.
  If you can`t respond to the Mighty Clouds Of Joy in this video, you are off my party list permanently.  :)
