7945019,1,B00005M2EA,"This film was part of a DVD set called ""Under Fire"" which I bought for 3.99 at Walmart. There were about 20 films on the three DVDs. Do the math. This particular film was easily the worst and there are some real turkeys on these discs. Dialog, music, action, plot, acting... every part of the film was bad. Glenn Ford must have needed some money to pay off his yacht. I can't think of any other reason for him to have his name attached to anything this abysmal. ANYONE who reviews this with more than two stars was either drinking heavily while watching or has something very, very wrong with their mental status. There are parts that are so horribly acted and written that they caused most of us in the room to laugh out loud and not for the right reasons. This film should have not been made and I truly wish the money spent on making it would have been given to charity or helped house the poor or feed the starving. Otherwise, it's a waste of the money I spent and easily the money the producers spent on giving life to this abortion of a film. TERRIBLE!!!",1441670400,,1060,4.305
7945020,2,B00005M2EA,"I watched this film for the simple reason that I am a great fan of Glenn Ford and Donald Pleasence, I wouldn't have bothered otherwise.  The film is watchable, in an average sort of way, but what struck me most about it was the terrible music.  Music can make or break a movie, and it certainly doesn't add anything to this one.  I can only describe it as being the kind of organ music that is used to accompany silent movies.  I would venture to suggest that this movie, with music more appropriate to a war film, would have attracted more stars from all of the reviewers, myself included.",1322524800,3,590,4.385321100917431
7945021,1,B00005M2EA,"The reviewer who said this was a good film must have been smoking crack when he watched it. The acting is beyond bad, the production and direction isn't any better - yet I couldn't stop watching it. I just wanted to make sure Glenn Ford (73 years old at the time this film was made) & Donald Pleasance (who was 70 at the time)couldn't add a little dignity to this dog of a film - they didn't. Which begs the question why did these two veteran actors lower themselves to such a horrible film? A. They 'really' needed the money OR B. They owed a big favor to the two main actor's daddy's (those famous dads being Sean Connery and Anthony Quinn). Unless you've got 90 minutes of your life you really don't care about stay away from this unbelievably bad movie.
 However, there is one bright spot - this film really does remind me of the spaghetti westerns than Clint Eastwood starred in or even more like the film `They call me Trinity.' Those films were made in the early 1960's and this dog was made in 1989 which makes it a little interesting that there are still directors who still don't know how to make a film.",1182729600,6,1114,4.330143540669856
7945022,1,B00005M2EA,"This movie is a very good example of something that should have been allowed to rot in the can!  I'm a fan of classic movies being transferred to DVD, if for no other reason to preserve them.  But this was a waste of money when it was made, and it's a waste of money on DVD.  Extremely poor story line, extremely poor acting, production quality on the film is so bad that you will wonder if there is a hidden fan on right next to your head.

I'm embarrassed to say that I couldn't think of anything good to say about this production.",1123027200,9,533,4.145631067961165
7945023,3,B00005M2EA,"The premise is that Winston Churchill is traveling through North Africa on his way to Casablanca and he will be the target of a Nazi kidnap or murder attempt.  It is up to our hero Cooper, his trusty assistant Franchetti, and his girlfriend and co-agent Lora, to foil the Nazis and deliver Churchill safely.

One of the villains of the piece is the French traitor who proudly defends his treason by stating that Vichy France is part of the Nazi empire.  Then of course there are some Nazi villains to fight.

The film was intelligently and interestingly done.  It even gets just a little bit controversial, when Churchill explains to the American general that while it is true that he had advance knowledge of the Pearl Harbor attack, he was not to blame for the massacre at Pearl Harbor because he had informed President Roosevelt about it in advance (and Roosevelt supposedly didn't find it credible, though that excuse for FDR is itself incredible).  The general answers that he would prefer not to believe that Roosevelt knew about it in advance.

With Glenn Ford in the cast, along with the sons of Anthony Quinn and Sean Connery, you would expect a professionally done film, and you get one.

The female lead is very good.  She uses her sex appeal to help the cause, and after being rescued from a German soldier's embrace (on the floor) she placidly tells her boyfriend Cooper that if he had rescued her a little later she would be starting a family.

This wasn't meant to be the finest film of all time.  It was meant to be an interesting action flick, and it achieved that goal.

My only complaint is that the characters were too handsome.  Such is Hollywood.  I really don't think that heroes have to look like Brad Pitt or Jason Connery.  Why can't we have an ugly hero now and then, or for that matter, just a regular guy and not a Playgirl pinup.",1120953600,6,1859,4.557228915662651
7945024,2,B00005M2EA,"By no means is ""Casablanca Express"" a great movie, but it is passable entertainment if you're not too discriminating and can accept some lapses in logic.  Jason (son of Sean) Connery and Francesco (son of Anthony) Quinn are assigned to protect Winston Churchill who's travelling through North Africa on the Casablanca Express during World War II.  The Germans are tipped off about Churchill's presence on the train and soon paratroopers capture the train and Churchill.  It's up to Connery and Quinn (and the comely female agent Lorna) to rescue Mr. Churchill.  Glenn Ford and Donald Pleasence have extended cameos as members of the Allied military brass in this European production.  ""Casablanca Express"" makes a nice companion film to the superior ""The Eagle Has Landed,"" wherein a team of German commandos attempt to assassinate Prime Minister Churchill on English soil.
The DVD, from Front Row, is another one of their budget releases, so don't expect too much.  There are chapter breaks and biographies/filmographies for Connery and Pleasence, though the filmography for Pleasence, a prolific film actor, is missing many of his films.  The film is presented full screen and the transfer, while not great, is acceptable for a budget release.  The bottom line on ""Casablanca Express"" is that it's a fair time passer if you're not too demanding.",1008547200,24,1347,5.175115207373272
