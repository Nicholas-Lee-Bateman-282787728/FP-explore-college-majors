4115341,5,B003ES5JEC,"Rather hard to tell from the video preview but this film looks to be about the re-introduction of Supergirl that Turner did with an emphasis on the Batman's suspicions of her and her brief flirtation with the dark side before going off to discover herself.

When her 50th anniversary (Action #252 back in '59!) came and went last year with nary a mark I was somewhat disappointed but it is good to see this film and the various statues that are being released now.
Finally a Supergirl film in Blu-Ray.",1280188800,4,501,4.566666666666666
4115342,5,B003ES5JEC,"I have not seen the movie yet but, the coming attractions of this animation is breathtakenly beautiful! They really did a successful job on applying the transitional artwork style of  Turner's over into animation. From what I've seen in the trailer, their staying close to the story line! Amazing!! I can't wait for this one to come out! Amazing story equals an amazing movie.

One other great story that should become an animated movie is, ""Red Son""... anyone?",1280102400,4,461,4.897435897435898
4115343,5,B003ES5JEC,Without a doubt this DVD should have been called Supergirl (not a spoiler since product description gave it away) since this is based on a 6-issues story that recreated her story; Darkseid is only the villain in the story.  The one thing that Im really happy is about is the art work is based on Michael Turner's original art work when this story was published in 2004.  This movie should be dedicated to Michael Turner who passed in 2008.  I truly believe this is one of the best stories in the last 10 years and can't wait to see it as a movie.,1280102400,11,546,4.281553398058253
4115344,5,B003ES5JEC,"I am typically not a fan of the New Gods/Crisis storylines but if Kevin Conroy is in it, it is a must buy for me! The animation looks very gritty (like a touch of Frank Miller) and with a story by Loeb, it's a guaranteed hit!",1279756800,3,225,3.9130434782608696
4115345,5,B003ES5JEC,I would just like to start off by saying i have not seen this movie but anything with superman and batman teaming up again will always be cool. This time they must battle the powerful and mighty darkseid and his henchmen. but this time they have supergirl to help them I've read about this online and the story seems to be a good one. I do not know the plot of the movie only what i've read. I really hope that the fans of these kind of movies continue to buy and support these wonderful movies that DC and warner make I encourage all who love these kinds of films to buy this movie when it comes out. just wanted to add on that i just watched the trailer and it is even better then i thought it would be. darkseid is one of the most powerful and cunning enemies that superman and batman have ever faced I just hope that this movie does well enough that they make more movies with batman and superman because in my mind superman and batman are the only two charactors in the DC universe that you can make good stories with. though i like batman but i'am more of a superman fan. but like i said before anything with batman teaming up with superman is going to be cool. I cannot believe that some people are already saying this is not going to be any good. i have seen the previews on you tube and i can tell you that it looks promising. Give it a chance it has not even come out yet.,1278201600,15,1382,4.1033210332103325

4115355,5,B003ES5JEC,Great flick. Marvel's got DC beat in live action but DC kicks serious Marvel *ss in animation. The plot is around Superman's cousin who happens to be superpowered also. There's also a subplot involving a pimp/prostitute like relationship between her and Apocalypse that I found interesting. Parents please read the box: this isn't for your kiddies! There are plenty of kiddie movies out there so please review this film accordingly and not by it's suitability for your children. This and Public Enemies are the best I've seen of these animated movies. Lauren Montgomery does a great job directing this one. I have the DVD but I would advise getting the blu ray for the added oomph!,1495756800,,681,4.879310344827586
4115356,4,B003ES5JEC,"Great Story.  I think its funny that superman and supergirl can get bloody, but Dark Seid never seems too, even though he is taking some serious hits.  Still entertaining.  And batman with a great checkmate move.  Loved the animated series cartoons that tell this story too.  Nice addition.

4115415,4,B003ES5JEC,One thumb up and the other one half way but all in all it was a good one. A very good adaption of the second Superman/Batman comic book series. Darkseid had the perfect voice (Andre Braugher) and I loved that Kevin Conroy played Batman an of course Tim Daly took the role of superman again. And the cherry on top was of course the animation. But parents be warned there is slight nudity but nothing extreme but 5-7 year olds are probably going to have to wait another 5-3 years maybe wait until they are 10.,1448409600,,507,4.291666666666667

4115437,4,B003ES5JEC,"Originally written 9-30-10

Gotham City is sent into a state of shock when something lands in the harbor. Batman investigates and finds what appears to be a spacecraft. Immediately afterwards, he's forced into a brief confrontation with a super strong girl whom is speaking in another language. Superman is able to communicate with her through his native tongue. He soon learns that the girl is his cousin Kara from Krypton. He takes it upon himself to show her the ropes and help her to control her powers; but there are other workings going on with the possibility of something big taking place.-summary

Superman/Batman: Apocalypse is another DC direct to video feature which is directed by Lauren Montgomery and produced by Bruce Timm. The story is based on Jeph Loeb's graphic novel Superman/Batman Vol 2: Supergirl. As usual, I will not compare the movie to its source material, and I will judge the work based on its merit. Therefore, I find the movie to be slightly above average, because it excels in the area it appeared to be focused on and that's the action.

When coming into this, it may be best to think Superman/Batman: Public Enemies. Although it's nowhere near as action packed, it seems more action driven once it gets there and lesser known characters make appearances, such as Big Barda and the Female Furies. In addition, unlike the aforementioned film, it doesn't exactly feel too much like a Superman and Batman movie at all. It could have actually been called Adventures of the Trinity or Justice League starring the big three, because the two leads(especially Batman) really didn't feel much more important than the side characters. Batman's presence was pretty much felt later on. Surprisingly, I didn't exactly have an issue with this move, since I think most of the characters pulled their own weight and delivered some cool battles.

The animation is at its best during the action scenes. Now, I don't believe all of the scenes are very well choreographed, especially when compared to Batman: Under The Red Hood. However, they're still entertaining and there are several cool moments. The brutality level is kind of high for a DC movie, since there are a few characters killed. There's a small amount taken out in the open while others off screen. The movie has a more adult oriented feel. The CG meshed well with the standard animation on certain occasions and the artwork consisted of some nice backgrounds, but I would have preferred to see the imagination run wild on Darkseid's world Apokolips, by delivering a little bit more. The world was actually compared with hell, so in that case it would have been cool to see more of its hellish side. The characters all looked real nice especially when concerning the females. Darkseid was probably the coolest though, because he appeared to be very physically intimidating; I mean he was big, and his hand was able to cover Superman's entire head.

The soundtrack was pretty standard for a superhero movie. I really didn't find it very special, but it did give off an epic feel. The voice acting was also pretty good, with Tim Daly and Kevin Conroy reprising their roles as Superman and Batman. Summer Glau appeared to be a nice fit for Supergirl/Kara, but I really didn't care for Andre Braugher as Darkseid. He really didn't seem to have that menacing side down, which Micheal Ironside worked to perfection in Superman: The Animated Series. I really didn't have much of an issue with the dialogue, but it could have done without the small bit of vulgarity.

The movie tries to be a little more than an actionfest with Kara's development, by pushing certain teen angst themes through her such as the feel of belonging. I think it worked in some areas, but others may experience the ""seen that before, and done much better"" feeling. Superman is also believable with his overprotective feelings.

Overall, I found the movie to be a little more than decent. Those whom prefer loads of action will get what they want, especially during the final battle; but I recommend coming into this one with low expectations. The DVD has a few extras consisting of trailers on earlier DC animated movies, as well as a sneak peak on the All Star Superman film.

Pros: Lots of action, good animation, and good artwork

Cons: Characters are somewhat bland, may not appeal to the non action crowd",1428364800,,4356,4.844086021505376

A spaceship lands in Gotham Harbor. A young woman emerges with powers just like Superman.

Welcome to Earth, Supergirl.

Upon learning of Kara Zor-Els (Supergirls) arrival, Darkseid orders her capture . . . and succeeds. If he can control her, he can use her to lead the Female Furries army.

Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman track Kara down with the help of Barda, the old leader of the Female Furries, and take the battle to Apokolips to save Kara and stop Darkseid from going through with his plans.

Talk about raising the bar and setting the stakes so high that it takes the combined forces of Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman to save the day. Add the threat of an unstable and brainwashed Kryptonian by way of Supergirl and the all-powerful Darkseid, and you have a recipe for a strong superhero story.

The spotlight was on Superman in this one and that pleases this Superman fan. By introducing Kara into the mix, we get to see him come to the realization that hes not Kryptons sole survivor and that he actually has family, a blood relative (Kara is Supermans cousin; her father and his were brothers). To see him try and show her the ways of Earth, help her fit in the same way his own earthly parents aided him, is a definite passing of the torch. It also gives him a chance to explain why he does things the way he does.

Tim Daly returns as the voice of Superman in this. I love his voice for the character. He was the man on Superman: The Animated Series and every time I see his name in the credits of a DCU movie, I know Ill be happy with the Superman in the flick.

Kevin Conroy is Batman. No, I mean, he is Batman. He cemented himself as such in Batman: The Animated Series and continues doing so with every outing.

Summer Glau picked up the reins as Supergirl in this and sold the dialogue very well.

DarkseidAndre Braugherwas okay, but I wish he had more of a commanding voice presence instead of just a deep one.

This movie is Supergirls movie, to be sure. It was based off the graphic novel Superman/Batman: Supergirl by Jeph Loeb and the late Michael Turner. Not sure why they changed the title for this movie. Whatever. They also translated Mr. Turners art very well to the screen. I love his artwork so was happy to see it animated as it was. He draws such amazingly beautiful women.

DC animated movies are good for including some fantastic extras and this one includes a Green Arrow animated short. It is pure gold and while I know the character is busy with his own TV show at the momentArrowI hope DC at some point makes a full-length live action movie or animated feature with him. If this short proves anything, its that they can do it and do it well.

Superman/Batman: Apocalypse is the total package and one I really liked a lot. Recommended.",1427932800,,2794,4.43359375

This particular teenager has plans of her own that do not include saving the world however. The battle that soon takes place is both heart wrenching and awesome!

This has Batman -- in a minor role -- Superman, Supergirl, Wonder Woman, Big Barda, all fighting Darkseid on his planet of Apocalypse. Darkseid wants Kara for his own army of woman warriors. Lots and lots and lots of fighting -- in Gotham, in Metropolis, on Paradise Island, on Apocalypse, in Smallville. The film has several false endings. The director didn't know when to quit, and so the film got to be tiresome after awhile. Great for watching women in superhero costumes battle each other for a very long time. Tara Strong voices Lashina, one of the the warrior women on Apocalypse. Batman has a small role. Edward Asner also voices a character, a gladiator manager on Apocalypse. Batman helps to defeat Darkseid, but the film is chiefly for fans of Superman. I still can't make up my mind if this is a good film or not. It gets better after a second viewing. One problem is here Batman is far too cynical and negative, in contrast to the optimism of Superman. I suppose the writers wanted to exaggerate the two characters.

4115484,5,B003ES5JEC,"DC Comics comes out with another hit from their DC Original Animated Movie line.

As a sequel to ""Superman/Batman: Public Enemies,"" this picks up not long after the events of that film. The World's Finest come together once again when a mysterious and powerful teenage girl arrives in Gotham City via a spaceship. After some miscommunications, it's eventually revealed that she is Kara Zor-El, Superman's cousin. While Superman embraces the idea of finding some connection to Krypton, the Dark Knight remains cautious of Kara. Through the help of Superman and Wonder Woman, Kara integrates into Earth culture as well learning how to harness her newfound abilities. This catches the attention of Darkseid, ruler of Apokolips, who expresses interest in recruiting the young Kryptonian as part of his Female Furies. Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman must join together to prevent Darkseid from corrupting Kara for his own evil purposes.

Once again, DC hits a home run with this release. Tim Daly and Kevin Conroy once again provide the voices of the Man of Steel and the Dark Knight respectively. This also features the return of Susan Eisenberg as Wonder Woman and Ed Asner as Granny Goodness. The movie also features Summer Glau, who does an outstanding job portraying the strength and innocence of Supergirl rather than portraying her as a whiny teenager. Andre Braugher provides the voice of Darkseid. This casting decision was seen as debatable. I had no problem with him as Darkseid. He was no Michael Ironside, but he was certainly better than any other animated incarnation of the Lord of Apokolips.

One thing to note. The comic from which this movie is based on is ""Supergirl of Krypton."" I'm not sure why they chose the title ""Apocalypse."" But all in all, a great movie to come down the DC Animated Movie pike.",1395705600,2,1819,4.9769736842105265

4115488,4,B003ES5JEC,"****SPOILERS AHEAD****

I liked this movie, but there were some things that I noticed.

I understand that Darkseid is the villain of this movie, but they mention that President Lex Luthor has been impeached within the first 2 minutes of the running time.  Then they state that Superman was testifying against Lex.  I guess these two points were mentioned to give the audience a frame of reference as to the times that the characters are living in, but it felt like a tease because we never see Lex or hear about Lex again in the movie.

In Cartoon Network's ""Justice League"" series, even the possibility of Lex as president made for EXTREMELY entertaining televison as that mere thought causes Superman to drop the boy scout mentality and just cut loose.  That cut loose mentality that Superman usually adopts frames Batman's justification for the focal point of the ""Doom"" animated movie.

Unfortunately, Superman doesn't ever cut loose as much as he should (although there are some nice action sequences), and the information is wasted.

At the beginning of the movie it is clear that both Batman and Krypto the dog hate Kara.  As Superman points out, Batman is suspicious of everyone, but they never really develop why Krypto didn't like her.  Sure, something is going to happen later on, but a deeper story could have been created to explain this.

It was great to see Wonder Woman, although I noticed that she an Superman were a lot more confrontational with each other than they usually are.

Another wasted opportunity (in addition to the wasted Lex Luthor opportunity) was the part with the hell spores.  It was VERY anti-climatic.  Batman threatens to use the spores, and he knows that Darkseid can't be trusted.  Batman should have used the spores.

Let me just say that I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the work of Andre Braugher.  He is hands down one of the top ten actors on television.  That being said, I did not enjoy his voiceover work as Darkseid.  It sounded as if he was reading at some points, and I guess I am used to the actor who voiced Darkseid for Cartoon Network's ""Justice League"" series.

On the flip side, Ed Asner is an absolute riot as Granny Goodness.

Can someone explain to me why Batman was already at Barda's house when Wonder Woman and Superman arrived?

On a side note, I never knew that the fictional Smallville was the ""creamed corn capital of the world"".",1392768000,,2383,4.719128329297821

4115490,4,B003ES5JEC,"Always great to have most of the voice actors from the WB JLA/JLU animated series.  Animation was decent, story had a plot and action and made for an enjoyable watch.
This is supergirl's journey, trying to find herself and her place on Earth.  She struggles with teen angst and Superman struggles with basically being a new parent to a teen, getting some comic and serious advice from Batman and Wonder Woman along the way.

4115491,4,B003ES5JEC,"The movie opens with Batman investigating a meteor that's fallen into Gotham Harbor. The meteor turns out to be a spacecraft and while Batman is investigating, the passenger of the spacecraft has run off with his boat and is running amok in Gotham. The passenger turns out to be Kara Zor-el, Superman's cousin, suffering from partial amnesia. Superman arrives and takes her to his Fortress of Solitude to teach her about Earth.

After some cute, albeit stereotypical, sequences where Kara learns to be an ""Earth girl,"" she is taken by Wonder Woman, who insists that the untrained girl poses a threat to everyone around her and that she needs to be taken to Themiscyra to be trained by the Amazons. Two months later, we find Clark and Diana on Paradise Island still arguing about what's best for Kara, as Bruce looks on in bemusement. Kara, in the meantime, is fed up with everyone trying to decide her fate and she runs off to the beach to be alone with her best friend among the Amazons.

Still bickering, Clark and Diana are interrupted by a boom tube, out of which pour a whole army of Doomsday clones. They fight off the incursion only to find that it was a diversion and that while they were fighting, Darkseid has captured Kara and taken her to Apokolips, to brainwash her and make her his captain.

The three heroes enlist the aid of Big Barda to go to Apokolips, where they split up, with Diana and Barda taking on Granny Goodness and her guard, the Furies, Batman looking for a threat to be used as leverage against Darkseid, and Superman taking on Darkseid and, alas, a very changed Kara. The fighting is fierce, with some interesting twists and turns. And just when you think everything's over, well ... you'll have to watch the movie for yourself to see what happens next.

Some of the animations sequences are amazing, which takes this video up a notch. I didn't much care for the massive, overly-stylized square jaws on Batman and Superman, though.

The voice actors include the usual stalwarts, Kevin Conroy, forever the iconic Batman voice, Tim Daly as Superman, Susan Eisenberg as Wonder Woman, a marvelous Ed Asner as Granny Goodness (an inspired choice when they first did this in the Superman television series), and Summer Glau and Andre Braugher as Supergirl and Darkseid, neither of whom managed to impress me, I'm afraid.

The story was an interesting one but I have to dock them a point for some questionable choices and plot holes. Still, there were some good plot twists, the battles were fun, particularly the climactic one, and the ending satisfying. With a better voice actor as Supergirl, this could have been a five-star movie. As it is, it's still a lot of fun and worth your time.",1391126400,,2714,4.703157894736842

Although, the title was misleading as the plot revolves around kara aka supergirl.  i would have expected darkseid and the planet apokolips to have a more active role in the film, and what i mean is they invade earth around the beginning of the film, darkseid noticing kara as he makes his warning toward the human race, and returns to his home planet to plot a diversion when the heroes search for kara as she is abducted by darkseid and meanwhile the parademons are coming back to finish the job to enslave the human race. but above all, the main characters always keep the viewers entertained",1388707200,,911,4.4879518072289155

4115499,4,B003ES5JEC,"First of all, this film's title is misleading. It is actually more than anything else an origin story for Supergirl. Superman, Batman, Apocalypse, Wonder Woman and some other characters are a part of the story, but it is not all about them. I understand that the big names sell, but for me personally, I avoided watching this for a long while because I have seen plenty of Superman/Batman films, and the prospect of yet another sounded boring. So I was pleased to learn that this story actually has more to it than that.

The opening scene is terrific, and although the rest of the film is not quite as mature, this is probably my favorite team-up DC animated film outside of Justice League: The New Frontier. Why? Because the story is interesting, and it's not just another alternate universe scenario (which is a way-overused plot device). Also, the animation style appeals to me. I do find it rather odd, the way that many of these newer DC animated films incorporate more adult content (violence, a bit of language and sexual suggestiveness) yet also retain some of the extremely cartoonish character realizations from the comics. Nevertheless, this one is pretty good, in my opinion.",1387843200,,1188,4.852216748768473

Everything is pretty typical to the other animated movies/shows...Kal-El is longing for a family connection and Batman is ""grumpy ass"" as Kara calls him. Wonder Woman also shows up with the girl power/freedom angle for Kara but it's good to see Themyscira in a movie that isn't a dedicated WW flick. Love the way Superman acts/reacts to Diana. Solid animation, great sound, some good special features.

Darkseid is awesome as always...could of explored the world and characters of their home planet a bit more. The Furies are just there and there could of been a minute introducing them to newcomers. They are such cool characters in the Superman mythos but can't expect to much in a 75 minutes movie. Love the final battle as well.

4115502,5,B003ES5JEC,"After reading some of the reviews I was a bit apprehensive about watching this. It's unfortunate that nowadays comic book related entertainment has to resort to blatant female nudity to help shore up sales. Don't get me wrong I support strong and sexy female leads but sometimes companies just flat out cross the line. In this particular film I think the producers did a reasonable job of balancing out the mature material when the storyline calls for it.

The film itself is very well done. I enjoyed the animation style and loved hearing some of the old voice actors from the Bruce Timm related animated series. The dialogue and interactions between the characters are great. I don't want to spoil too much but seeing Superman in the mall is hilarious. What stuck out to me was how well they portrayed Wonder Woman/ Big Barda/ Supergirl. I really enjoyed how they let the girls hang with the boys.

If you buy the Blu ray version you get a lot of nice extras. There are some nice short summaries of the Jack Kirby New Gods characters. There are also 4 Darkseid related episodes from the Superman amimated series. I  really enjoyed the Green Arrow short film.

If anyone from DC is reading please consider making more films with characters other than Superman and Batman. Don't get me wrong I love those guys but please give the other guys (and gals) at least some more screen time. I know Time Warner needs to turn a profit on these products but at least consider making more animated shorts for the lesser known characters.",1382313600,,1526,4.661710037174721

4115504,4,B003ES5JEC,"Good movie:
This movie is the second half of the same comic series ""Public Enemies"" is from. It deals mostly with the story of Supergirl, and very little to do with Apocalypse. That said, it's still an entertaining story; though I was more entertained by the Green Arrow short. Wonder Woman and Batman also make brief appearances. Special Features includes 4 cartoons featuring Darkseid, the story of Supergirl, and other featurettes including one about why Darkseid is so badass. Overall it's a pretty good buy.

Poor service:
I ordered this on Friday night. Saturday morning I was at a local retail store and saw this on sale for $10. I bought it from the store and tried to cancel my order on Amazon. Not yet shipped, it hasn't even been a full day since I ordered, yet Amazon said I couldn't cancel... My order came today, and I was thinking of returning it. But since Christmas is only 2 months away, I'll give the Amazon copy to my cousin. If another store is charging $10, then Amazon is overcharging at $20.",1381795200,,1015,4.607734806629834

4115506,5,B003ES5JEC,"This picks up right where ""Superman/Batman: Public Enemies"" leaves off; it plays essentially like a sequel to that movie. Kevin Conroy returns as Batman and Tim Daly returns as Superman. I was never a big fan of Supergirl but this film's portrayal of her is amazing. The plot focuses around her crash landing to Earth as Superman's cousin Kara Zor-El. While she tries to understand herself and decide her path, chaos erupts around all the heroes. Wonderwoman is also featured here and also blew away my expectations of her; she is fierce and engaging. The main villain that the heroes have to face off against is one of the most powerful and interesting villains in the DC Universe, Darkseid (voiced by Andre Braugher who does an amazing job).

The writing is absolutely amazing and there is no shortage of great action sequences. Every character is done justice in this movie and their strengths are magnified as well as their weaknesses. The film ""Public Enemies"" was an extremely good predecessor but it left me wanting more. ""Apocalypse"" is an amazing conclusion to the 2 movie story arc. I think that individually, this movie is the better of the two and that's saying a lot.

I highly recommend this but I suggest you buy the 2-Disc set with both movies that's featured on here because they really do go together in my opinion (not to mention it's cheaper).",1376956800,,1363,4.771186440677966
4115507,4,B003ES5JEC,So i knew what i was getting before hand and I have to say it's still great the 2nd time around. The story was well put together and moved along nicely. Yet even though i enjoy the superman mythos; I can't think why krypto needs a cape. Anyway setting that aside kara was portrayed exellent to where a teenager in a foreign land is what you expect. I'm not just not buying that she has to be physically protrayed like ever other boring american girl that wears barely anything. Moving along you see superman a bit controlling over kara; which is different  since he's taking care of his cousin. All in all the fights were great and over the top. Especially the end fight I've watched that numerous times already. So if you can get passed the whole lets make supergirl eye candy then you pretty much have a good film,1375747200,,815,4.397350993377484
4115508,4,B003ES5JEC,"Batman is freakin' awesome in this.  Supergirl unfortunately is relegated to a damsel in distress who does one useful thing at the end (functioning as a Deus Ex Machina) character, but the movie isn't called Superman/Batman/Supergirl, so her lack of major inclusion isn't terribly surprising.  The movie did a good job until the end of not de-powering Superman just so he could fight alongside Batman, in fact, Batman's lack of powers are used really well in the movie.  The action is fun, very enjoyable.  I'm glad to have finally finished my DC Animated Collection.",1374105600,,567,5.0

This time around, Kara Zor-El, aka Supergirl and Superman's cousin from Krypton crashes on planet Earth. Darkseid then sets his sights on her for Granny Goodness to join her royal guard. Other great moments of this film is Wonder Woman appearing and fighting alongside Superman and Batman, Big Barda helping Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman fighting Darkseid's forces on Apokolips, and of course the final fight scene where Kara and Superman fight against Darkseid on the Kent Farm. I definitely recommend this movie to any fan of DC Comics.",1367884800,,661,5.304761904761905
4115515,4,B003ES5JEC,"Okay, I understand DC shying away from poking the bad mojo that came from the Supergirl movie, but you'd think they'd actually have Kara on the cover wearing the big 'S'.  Oh, well.  This isn't too bad.  Animation is better than I expected, voices are okay (though I keep thinking Darkseid's voice isn't deep and evil enough).  I'm a fan of Supergirl (the crappy movie notwithstanding), so I had high hopes for this after reading the tradeback.  All in all, I'm satisfied - they hewed pretty closely to the tradeback and the source material is really good.  But my socks weren't knocked off (hush all you Mythbusters saying it can't be done).  It's enjoyable and I'm glad to have it in my collection, but I won't be planning any viewing parties with friends and family.  Supergirl is cute, Superman is impressive, and Batman is moody.  I give this 4 out of 5 stars just because it's Supergirl, but it's 3 out of 5 without her.",1365724800,,926,4.5636363636363635

However, since the story is compressed in the movie, a lot of little details get left out that would have made the movie make more sense.  The movie has two improvements over the comic: they at least give you SOME idea how Darkseid turned Kara over to his side, and the ending isn't as sloppy.

4115536,1,B003ES5JEC,"As several reviewers have mentioned, this movie differs in several key ways from the original graphic novel written by Jeph Loeb.

First, this movie was conveniently titled ""Superman/Batman: Apocalypse"", however the original graphic novel was named: ""Superman/Batman: Supergirl"".

Obviously, the folks at DC/Warner did not want fans to know that the focus of this video would be Supergirl.

There were several other changes in this adaptation, but the general idea was to minimize the roles of Batman and Superman in this movie and super-enhance the roles played by the female characters (Supergirl, Barda, Wonder Woman, etc.).

It is obvious that the director of this movie (Lauren Montgomery) gave priority to the female characters in detriment to the original roles that Batman and Superman play in the graphic novel.

The following are key examples of where the director and writer of this adaptation made biased decisions:

1. The sequence when Clark and supergirl are in metropolis and they go shopping: In the movie they extended this sequence to include a long montage of supergirl buying stuff, while in the original graphic novel this scene only takes place in one page, and only shows supergirl and Clark after shopping, going for a hot-dog, and heading to the park (e.g., no montage).

2. The first battle of the female furies, where a potential leader for the furies is tested and killed in the process: In the movie, this sequence takes a long time to develop, while in the graphic novel it is all shown in only one page (again, a biased in favor of certain characters)

3. The scene where Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman go to Barda's house to ask her for a `mother box': In the movie, they show superman as very calm and with no evident problems with Wonder Woman for having forcefully kidnapped her cousin, however in the original graphic novel, superman is really angry with wonder woman, to the point that he tells her ""... I hold you partially responsible for this situation, if Kara hadn't been in paradise island and was left under may watch ..."" (you get the picture). The whole tension between them (which make very interesting the original story, and had implications later in the same story) was basically eliminated.

4. There are three sequences of barda and wonder woman alone in apokolips (preparing for battle and then fighting the female furies): In the movie, those sequences are blown out of proportions, it is obvious that the director wanted to give the best fighting sequences to the female characters, while in the graphic novel all these scenes are condensed in 4 pages with little fighting at all (the result was that very cool moments for Batman and Superman were completely omitted, which in the graphic novel took many more pages to show).

5. The final confrontation between Darkseid and Superman and Supergirl: In this movie, they gave supergirl most of the time in the battle, and even allowed her to help at the end when superman finally gets rid of darkseid. In the original graphic novel supergirl only has one small scene where she apparently is vaporized by darkseid omega rays (although she is in fact tele-transported). The rest of the fight in the original graphic novel is between Superman and Darkseid. There is only one small moment when wonder woman intervenes (shielding superman from the omega rays in the barn), but Superman is still angry with her and screams: ""Stay out of this Diana!"" Then he takes her from her right arm and throws her very hard out of the barn (through and destroying part of the roof). Afterwards, we see a very cool fight between Superman and Darkseid, where Superman uses not only his strength but his intelligence, ending with Darkseid being added to ""the source wall"" (for those of you that know the new gods Kirby story).

The bottom line is that this movie and its marketing are very deceptive. It was targeted to fans of the previous Superman/Batman movie (which was really good), but the real target should be fans of female characters that wanted to see them in a better light.

By the way, Batman is stolen of a lot of good lines and moments from the original graphic novel to this movie interpretation. So if you are a Batman fan, you may want to check out the novel before watching this movie.",1348185600,5,4292,4.832425068119891

4115538,4,B003ES5JEC,"Well When I finally got this in the mail I opened it up and guess what I saw the damn Blu-Ray case had that opening in the shape of the recycle symbol this really bothers me because the case has three huge holes in it why do we have a DVD/Blu-ray cases its to protect it from damage from leaving it out in the open.  Other than that I really had no problem. What I love about the Blu-Ray releases of the DC Comics movies it the extras that you get.  You get four cartoon episodes from old tv shows an extra short on the Green Arrow, a few documentaries on the characters in the movie and a upcoming sneak peek at their next animated movie.  Now we are going to have some spoilers so stop reading now if you don't want it spoiled.
Well now for the movie it self, pretty much the plot follows as this Supergirl comes to earth and is lost when Batman finds her but she cannot control her powers then Superman shows up an speaks with her in their alien language.  Batman is distrustful of her throughout the beginning of this movie eventually he sets up a trap with Wonder Women and she takes her to Themescyra where she learns to control her powers and the ways of the warrior. At this point Throughout the movie the villain Darkseid has been planning something which comes to fruition when he attacks Themescyra with an army of Doomday clones but this is just a distraction so that his minions can kidnap Supergirl.  So we have the big three: Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman need to head to Darkseid's home-world Apokolips they do this by getting help from Big Barda.  When they get there the have to face off against the Furies who are powerful female solders under Darkseid control.  Superman evuntaully encounters Darkseid, who sets the brainwashed Supergirl on him.  While that goes on Batman confronts Darkseid and informs him that he has activated the some sort of  bombs around the pits of the his planet which will destroy it.  So Darkseid gives in because its something he would have done and frees Supergirl.  The heroes head back to earth and Superman takes Supergirl back to his parents farm but Darkseid pulls the dirty double cross and there is one last big fight.  For the most part this movie is pretty good you get some great action scenes and an OK story arc animation is good quality I say get it especially if you are a fan of Superman or Batman.",1346889600,,2363,4.419354838709677

The movie was great by introducing Kara, it gives you a story to work off of for the addition of Supergirl. The addition of Darkseid into the mix definitely makes things interesting knowing how Supes and him are always at each others necks.
The fight scene towards the end is pretty long and some people will obviously complain but I thought it approipriated given that the ones fighting are some of the most powerful in the universe (I mean what did you expect? A one hit knock out? Come on).

4115542,2,B003ES5JEC,"Its called ""Batman/Superman"" but it feels like the only point of this was to stick Kara into the movie plotline. Its incredibly hard to enjoy because her voice acting is so horrible. I absolutely love Susan, Kevin and Tim doing their JL characters voices. And they're VERY good so it just makes the bad voice acting stick out even worse. Hell, shoulda had Edward (granny goodness) do Kara and i woulda liked it a lot more.

Even Batman's greatest scene with Darkseid is ruined by the lousy voice of mr Omega-spammer.

The cheapened Doomsday clones seemed like nothing more than an attempt at flashbacking to the Death of Super Man flick (though ironically enough the horrible voice acting is all i really remembered from that POS anyways)

Fight scene between the super cousins and Darkseid were so-so. The Omega Beams didn't have a brutal effect as they were intended to. The animation looked like it was just spraying pink water from a super soaker on Kara and Clark. Not brutally seering their flesh or ""reducing them to ashes"". I thoroughly thought the furies vs Barda and Wonder Women had MUCH more thought into the fight sequence.

4115544,3,B003ES5JEC,"This is a sequel to the 'Super/Batman: Public Enemies' animated movie, of which I was a HUGE fan.  Read my review for more on that...

This sequel however is not like it's predasessar.  It falls short in animation quality, story, action and it's overall attention keeping power.

It does have Kevin and Tim reprising their roles as Batman and Superman, one of the few pluses of the movie.

It's not terrible, but definitely not '...Public Enemies' quality.

**Minor Spoilers Ahead**

This tale focuses in on Superman's cousin who falls to Earth in a space ship.  She is roughly 16 years old, and unfortunately this movie focuses mainly on her.  She is not very interesting to say the least.  Now if Powergirl was swapped in instead...that's a different story.

Anyway Batman doesn't trust her, as Batman doesn't trust any aliens, and he spends most of the movie distrusting her.  Darkseid takes an interest in her and kidnaps her.

So our heroes go to Big Barta, who is REALLY tall, and with her and her motherbox, THAT'S A COMPUTER THAT OPEN WORMHOLES THREW SPACE for all you dirty minded people, descend upon planet Apocalypse for a rescue.

Decent movie, completists like me will no doubt want to own this, if they do not already.  Hope they make a third in this series in the future, and hopefully recapture the thunder of '...Public Enemies.'  Hope this review is helpful and as always sorry for the misspellings, why Amazon doesn't have Spell Check I'll never know...",1333238400,,1473,4.785714285714286
4115545,4,B003ES5JEC,"This is a 2010 direct-to-video animated superhero film based on the Superman/Batman comic storyline ""The Supergirl from Krypton"" and is a sequel to Superman/Batman: Public Enemies.

Notable voice actors include: Tim Daly, Andre Braugher, Edward Asner, Kevin Conroy and Summer Glau. The dialogue was hit or miss at times and the story had a few shining moments but was a bit too predictable in certain parts and the red herring that only Batman spotted sort of made everyone else seem like idiots.

4115546,3,B003ES5JEC,"I'm a big fan of Bruce Timm's DC Animated Universe, which includes The Animated Series installments of Batman and Superman.  When I discovered that Kevin Conroy would return as the voice of Batman and Tim Daly as Superman I couldn't resist. Yes, technically this is not set in the Animated Universe, but with both of the actors voicing their respective characters it's the next best thing. ""Best thing"" might be too strong a phrase for this animated movie, however.

Let's get a few things straight: This movie is actually about Supergirl. Batman isn't in it a whole lot.  Wonder Woman features prominently. And although Darkseid appears to liven things up, it's basically a story about the familial relationship between Kal-El (Clark Kent/Superman) and Kara (Supergirl).

The film starts our promising as we see Gotham through Kara's eyes.  She's a gorgeous superpowered teenager who can fly, shoot beams out of her eyes, and is superstrong, but without the grounding of a small town life.  After a series of misunderstandings nearly cause a city-wide disaster, Kara is carted off to live with the island of Themyscira, where gorgeous Amazons lounge in white shifts and fight each other all day. Superman's not happy about the arrangement, convinced he can raise Kara himself.  The argument becomes moot when Darkseid kidnaps her, convinced that Kara will lead his honor guard, the Female Furies.

Our three heroes put aside their squabbling to rescue Kara from Darkseid. One way you know that Batman is out of his league is when he brings a jetpack. If Bats brings a jetpack, he's facing supervillains greater than he can handle with wits alone.  He pulls a twist in the end, but if you don't know the DC Universe very well or how things work on Apokolips it seems a little too convenient.

The animation is superb.  The fight scenes are glorious to behold.  There's no punches pulled in presenting the universe in all its wacky glory, complete with Krypto the superdog (who puts a cape on a dog?), Amazons living on an island wielding only swords, and an honor guard named after Greek myth by a guy who doesn't seem to have anything to do with Greek myth. You either embrace all this stuff or you don't - this film is clearly for DC fans only.

Unfortunately, Darkseid is curiously defanged in this incarnation.  He stoops to physical combat in a way that can only be described as being beneath him.  His legendary tactics are nowhere in evidence; by the end of the movie he is no more than a thug who resorts to his fists. Not very becoming of an all-powerful godly despot.

There are further twists - the film dangles a rematch and then delivers - but it doesn't make up for the awkward argument over who gets to be Kara's parents. At heart, this is a movie about a father-figure (Superman), a mother-figure (Wonder Woman), and a wicked stepfather (Darkseid) in a battle over custody of their child (Supergirl). It's essentially Kramer vs. Kramer with superpowers.",1330819200,3,2969,4.803536345776031

All in all Kara is annoying, Darkseid's voice threw me off, sup's and bat's use of the words ""a**"" and ""damn"" are not something kids should be hearing, title should have been superman/batman/supergirl go shopping, music score was too familiar with the orchestra going ""DA!! du du, du du DA! du du, much like the opening of batman begins.

I liked the acting (especially Kevin Conroy), but the story was bland. Unlike other DC Universe Animated Original Movies like Batman: Under The Red Hood or Justice League: the New Frontier, rather than telling a compelling and moving story (such as The Dark Knight or Batman: Arkham Asylum) it just seemed like a way to make money. Batman by the way plays a supporting role rather than a leading one. You can almost predict everything that happens. Any one who has seen Pirates of the Cariibean: On Stranger Tides will know what I am talking about. It is called ""Jumping the shark.""

4115556,3,B003ES5JEC,"When I saw this last September, after the awesome Under the Red Hood, I was EXTREMELY disappointed! If I had typed a review last year, I more than likely would've given it two stars. When it finished, and even after seeing the preview for All-Star Superman, I was actually considering not buying anymore of the DCU films. Out of the then nine movies, six of them I greatly enjoyed, one was just OK (Superman: Doomsday) and two I flat out didn't enjoy at all (this and Gotham Knight though there are some mild redeeming qualities to the two). It just felt boring, the title itself is, as others have said, misleading. It should've retained the title from the comic as very little happens on Darkseid's planet nor is there some ""apocalyptic"" scheme by the manical tyrant. And again I must complain about ANOTHER Superman villain being featured! Sure Batman's villains may not have the strength to take on the Man of Steel, but none of Superman's bad guys play sadistic mind games when compared to Joker, Riddler or even Scarecrow. I hate to seem like that should be a major criticism against this and the last Superman/Batman film, but everytime they team these two heroes, they always seem to pick one of the Man of Steel's rogues over the Dark Knight. Are the other Superman/Batman stories like that?

After a year of owning it, I've watched it twice, the most recent being just a half hour ago so I could refresh myself on the movie and I must it admit, it was actually better the second time around. Though only slightly; it moved at a faster pace than the last time but quite a few problems remain. At first I didn't like the animation (though when compared to Public Enemies, I'm glad those ridiculous six-pack abs are gone) but it grew on me for this second viewing though the very prominent upper lip of Superman and Batman bugs me and almost look like mustaches to me in wider shots but for close-ups they look fine. Darkseid however doesn't look  good here as he did in Superman: TAS and JL/JLU, he almost looks simian rather than alien. My other main gripe is Supergirl; I know sex sells but why is she always posing provocatively or dressed as a stripper? Just because she's a younger female character, doesn't mean she needs to be wearing next to nothing. Not even Power Girl was like that in Public Enemies and she has that huge cleavage window. I feel Wonder Woman was the only character to come off well in this even though she seems like she was shoehorned in at the last minute (to clarify I've never read the comic so I don't know if she has an expanded role outside of what we see in the film). She just pops up out of nowhere and tells Superman that she's taking Kara to Paradise Island whether he likes it or not. Couldn't she have just asked him in a non-confrontational way? I can understand Wonder Woman's reasons for taking her but the only reason she zapped half the park anyway was because she scared the crap out of her. Barda also feels like a last minute inclusion. All they needed from her was a way to get to Apokolips but seeing as how she has a grudge against Darkseid and the others, I can understand why she tags along. The story also feels like a rehash of the two-part episode ""Little Girl Lost"" from S:TAS. The fight at the end with Darkseid seems redundant after the Superman/Supergirl fight but it does at least provide a reason for Kara's decision to fight with her cousin.

Another DCAU cast reunion with the legendary Kevin Conroy and Tim Daly, along with Susan Eisenberg and Edward Asner. Summer Glau, I really don't have an opinion on. She was alright but I'm just used to Nicholle Tom. Michael Ironside however was greatly missed. Darkseid didn't feel as intimidating or have a presence when he was on screen. Andre Braugher didn't live up to what I think Darkseid should sound like. At least when Frank Welker did Darkseid, it was a low, gravelly voice (even though it was just his Dr. Claw voice).

My opinion of it is better than it was a year ago, but it's really not one of their finer films. Thank goodness All-Star Superman changed my opinion on this line of films.",1320451200,9,4118,4.516085790884718

4115560,3,B003ES5JEC,"Talk about high expectations going in, ever since the release of Superman/ Batman Public Enemies, I have been terribly excited about this piece.  Going through absolute withdrawal of the animated Justice League series, about the closest I can get to fulfilling that void comes in the form of these DCAU feature films starring some of the League's most influential members.

And in theory this one should have delivered there! After all, it features Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman and Supergirl (heck even Superman's dog Krypto makes a cameo) and pits them against the hordes of darkness on Apokolips.  However, in execution, I found the finished product to be a bit too ambitious for its own good but more on that in a moment, first let's take a look at the facts.

Superman/Batman: Apocalypse is a 2010 direct-to-video animated film based on the Superman/Batman comic storyline ""The Supergirl from Krypton"" and serves as an unofficial sequel to Superman/Batman: Public Enemies.

The story basically opens by making reference of the timeframe through blurbs on Gotham City radio suggesting it is within the weeks after the events that led to Lex Luthor's arrest, the impeachment of his presidency, and Batman's success in saving the world from the impact of an approaching meteor.

A spacecraft crash-lands in Gotham City Harbor apparently containing a naked young girl without knowledge of English or Earth or really much of anything. Without giving much away, the girl in question is of course the future Supergirl (Kara Zor-El) and while Superman welcomes his fellow Kryptonian refugee with open arms and works to teach her English and Earthen culture, Batman remains suspicious.

By the time the film is over, the viewer will have visited Gotham City, Metropolis, Themyscira, Apokolips, and Smallville.  Considering its 78-minute runtime, there's a lot of ground to cover here!

I mentioned earlier that my biggest criticism of the film is that it may be a bit too ambitious for its own good and that statement certainly deserves elaboration.  While the look of the film is spot on (with a unique, angled look to the character models), the vocal cast impeccable (opting to use the talent of the Justice League actors; in fact this was the noted as the first project Kevin Conroy and Susan Eisenberg (Batman and Wonder Woman) have worked on together since the end of the Justice League series) but the plot is a bit scattered and the pacing inconsistent.

I guess this is to be expected given the incredible number of characters and locations involved to be crammed within a film that runs only a bit over an hour in length.  Call it wishful thinking if you must, but this whole thread would have been far better served had it been introduced as a multi-episode thread in the Justice League animated series.  Maybe I'm still not over my adoration of that show, but I can't help but feel like a lot of these DCAU feature films coming from Warner Brothers of late would have made for awesome season-long threads for JL not unlike the Project Cadmus angle.

Back to reality though, the fight segments contained here are pretty impressive, and do a nice job capturing the inhuman power of the combatants involved.  The inconsistent pacing and rushed ending can probably be overlooked by action-junkies on account of these awesome battles.  The rest of us who have come to expect absolute perfection from Bruce Timm and company will likely come away from this film feeling as though the potential outweighs the finished product.",1313452800,,3526,4.97108843537415
4115561,3,B003ES5JEC,"I enjoyed the Batman/Superman series. I bought this film after enjoying Batman: Under the Red Hood. This film is, however, weak.

The film has one main point: the introduction of Supergirl. It is an interesting premise. What if Superman wasn't the only survivor? What would happen if teenage survivor arrived on Earth instead of an infant? There is a lot of potential here, and almost all of it is thrown out. Supergirl can't speak English for about five minutes. Then she's just your average teenager rebelling against her authority figure. Their excuse for completely destroying any interest anyone could have in Supergirl's acclimation story is that Darkseid wants her for a minion. I like Darkseid as a villain. One of my favorite episodes in the Superman Animated Series involved Superman giving into his anger after Darkseid killed police officer. That one episode was a thousand times greater than this entire movie.",1304985600,,923,5.112582781456954

4115564,4,B003ES5JEC,"In what has to be the best quality animation yet for any of the DCU films, the story still takes the center stage. While I think it would have been better titled as Batman/Superman/Wonder Woman"" Apocalypse, since Wonder Woman plays a pivotal part, the movie is fantastically well-presented.

Returning to voice the heroes are the same folks who did so well in the Batman and Superman animated series, Kevin Conroy's unparalleled Batman and Tim Daly's Superman are extremely well-done in the voice acting and the animation. We see their internal conflicts reflected in their faces (limited exposure that may be for Batman), hear their anguish and anger and determination and conviction in their voices. The sardonic wit that permeated so much of the Justice League episodes and the few Superman/Batman crossovers during their animated series runs reappears and makes long-time viewers feel at home. Reprising her role as Wonder Woman (from the JL series), Susan Eisenberg once more delivers the best voice acting for her character just as well as the men do on theirs.

The story centers around a re-imagining of Supergirl's origin. In this version, her ship crashlands in Gotham, where Batman is forced to deal with her before her newfound and uncontrolled powers demolish the city he is sworn to protect. Superman, of course, learns of her presence, and takes charge of her education and indoctrination. She progresses quickly, learning English in under a week and gaining some control over her powers. However, distrust from Batman and Krypto (who appears so briefly he could have been excluded altogether), drive her to rebel from Superman's ""control"" the way any other moronic teenage girl would be written to do. Wonder Woman intervenes, taking young Kara to Paradise Island where she can be free to learn how best to handle her powers amongst a setting and populace more resilient than found in Metropolis. There we get to see the Amazons treating Superman with contempt despite the fact he could destroy them and their island with nary a wisp of effort if he so chose, and the viewer momentarily wishes Superman lacked his heroic principles that he might teach the Amazons a well-deserved lesson in humility.

However, it is the machinations of Darkseid that kick the story into overdrive. Abducting Kara to install her as the captain of his personal guard, the Furies, Darkseid faces down the heroes on his home turf. We get the creepiest incarnation yet of Granny Goodness on the screen, with a man voicing the character who is rendered as anti-feminine as could be. Here we get a failing in the voice casting, as Andre Braugher, though a great actor, is not so great as a voice actor. Lacking the emotive power that Michael Ironside gave the character in the various animated series, Darkseid comes across as rather weak be comparison, when he should dominate every scene.

There is a rescue with a premature celebration before a much more significant battle on Earth itself. We see the Kryptonians show their mettle in a life or death fight, with the outcome rather easily foreseen even for those who did not read the graphic novel.

In terms of the visual presentation, this is the new gold standard by which the DCU films should be judged. There are several special features which can educate those who might not be familiar with the origins of the various New Gods characters, as well as the excellent Green Arrow short. It's a great tale, with fantastic art and voice acting for the most part, and will not disappoint anyone who might, like me, have been on the fence about this one.",1303257600,3,3598,4.911184210526316
4115565,5,B003ES5JEC,"What these other reviewers fail to realize this is an amazing adaptation of Jeff Loebs', and Michael Turner's Superman/Batman Volume 2. The animation reflects The late Turner's artwork, scene for scene. The pacing is quick, and Timm's production values are outstanding.

4115567,3,B003ES5JEC,"Ok, first I wanna start by saying that I am by no means a DC know it all, but there were certain things that happened in this movie that I, with my limited knowledge, felt that hardcore fans would be offended at. Maybe there's something that happened in the comics that explains some of these problems I had, but they sure weren't explained in the movie, and felt like they needed to be.

Here's my first issue. I may not know much about the Superman storyline, but I do know this. In the 90s, there was a series focusing on a villain called Doomsday, and this villian, by himself managed to pwn almost every DC hero by himself and actually kill Superman. I remember this being a big deal when it came out. So now we come to this movie and guess who comes back? Why Doomsday of course.

So when I see that he's back, I get kinda excited, but wait a minute? What's this? There's actually 1000 Doomsdays now? Uhh sure... when did that happen again? So I shrug that little revelation off and prepare myself for what should be the fight to end all fights. Right? Superman and the primary members of the justice league against an army of Doomsdays sounds epic right? Well evidently not, as Superman literally just hops into the air, and kills EVERY LAST DOOMSDAY with ONE massive beam from his eyes.

Ok.... wtf? Am I missing something? Are these doomsday clones watered down or something? Sure wasn't mentioned in the movie? Has doomsday always been that lame? Was Superman just not trying before when he lost to one of these things? I mean, for crying out loud, even Batman killed one of the Doomsdays with an exploding batarang?! Batman?! Really?!?!?! I mean I love Batman as much as the next guy, possibly more, but come on. What that basically tells me is that Doomsday can be defeated by something with the equivelant force of a hand grenade. Just.... no.

This brings me to my second major problem with this movie. Look... Again, I love Batman and all, but he's not god. I mean at the end of this movie, we have Superman, Wonderwoman, and Supergirl, 3 powerhouses heading to Apocalypse to kick ass, and they bring Batman. Why would you bring batman to assault a planet of monstrous superpowered beings and giant futuristic robots? What the hell is he going to do? It follows a problem that many DC writers seem to have these days in that every hero is a frickin moron EXCEPT Batman. Batman is ALWAYS right in this movie, he always wins, he's the best, and he actually ends up being the one to save the day at the end. VS frickin Darkseid of all people.

Those are my two major gripes, but also the main storyline just felt weak. Darkseid is supposedly interested in Supergirl, but the way the movie ends, he comes off as not really caring what happened to her anyways. It was all just meh. Not awful, but certainly a step below the previous DCAU movies imo.",1297900800,,2859,4.469348659003831
4115568,4,B003ES5JEC,"This title is a direct follow-on to Superman/Batman: Public Enemies. With the dangerous Kryptonite asteroid destroyed by Batman and his Japanese asteroid-destroying robot (no, I'm not kidding), an asteroid fragment detaches and lands in Gotham harbor, carrying a Kryptonian passenger that will soon become a bargaining chip in the uneasy detente between the heroes of the Justice League and the forces of Apokolips, the slaves of Darkseid.

This is a Bruce Timm-produced piece with the classic Justice League voice actors: Kevin Conroy and Tim Daly as Batman and Superman, respectively, with Summer Glau in a surprise appearance. If you liked the neo-anime art style in Public Enemies, then you'll like this one too as it was clearly done by the same artists. For myself, I was a big fan of the less complex Batman/Superman/Justice League art, but these new versions of the characters are perfectly palatable.

I wasn't a huge fan of previous efforts by Bruce Timm in this vein; both Crisis on Two Earths and Public Enemies were weak from a plot standpoint, and they seem to have been animated by people who had poor concepts of superheroic action. Apocalypse does much to correct past mistakes. In addition to introducing more Justice League characters, we get a fantastic re-imagining of some classic locations from the DC canon. The action sequences are both better animated and better paced than previous efforts by this animation team, making for a fun, tight story that doesn't break any major continuity with previous stories about these characters.

In short, if you have basic grounding in the stories of the Justice League, nothing here will be confusing and you'll get a fun, well-scripted, and tight action fest that fits cleanly in its 78-minute envelope. If you don't know anything about the Justice League or Apokolips, you might want to look elsewhere first; the original story of Miracle Man in the original Justice League series will bring you up to speed.",1296345600,,1974,5.067692307692307

And when the characters act out of character, and the dialogue and story progression are so stilted and poorly done, it is hard to care about the action sequences.

The story is well known to comic fans of late, and tells a fine story of the origin of Supergirl. There are things though that bothered me. I noticed the distrust present between the principle heroes who appear more than I expected. The acrimony between Superman and Batman is well known to most who follow their story, but the friction between both of them and Wonder Woman surprised me, and the reason for it was never explained. It was not a huge problem, but it poisoned the atmosphere for me.
As for the young Kryptonian who ultimately becomes Supergirl, her uncertainty and confusion were understandable, and one could understand if our heroine made a bad choice. The lack of internal dialoge hurt things here. We don't know why she did what she did, and so it is harder to understand why things turn out different later, especially when one considers that both fights were self contained (she didn't remember the first fight, and so, couldn't learn from it).
I suppose though that I'm being a bit too picky. Technically, the whole thing looks great and the story line flows well enough. The short that is included, starring the Green Arrow, was also very well done, and very true to the character that we all know and love.

4115578,2,B003ES5JEC,"I don't really ask a ton of these DCU Animations but I would like them to either improve or at least stay of equal quality to prior efforts but Apocalypse is a huge step backwards. We open to Batman investigating a mysterious object that crash landed in Gotham harbor. It turns out to be the spacecraft of Superman's Kryptonian cousin Kara who wanders naked and bewildered in Gotham as the Earths environment unleashes her awesome Kryptonian powers. The script jumps right into stupid as Kara is immediately menaced by some horny dockworkers and then shot by police for the crime of floating in the air. Batman manages to knock her out with some Kryptonite and takes her back to his Batcave for further study.

*** SPOILER ALERT ***
Before I continue I want to say that I highly recommend people skip this one. I saw it free on Netflix but the cost of 78 minutes of my life was too high. I'm not even going to attempt to avoid spoilers so continue at your own risk.

Kara wakes up just as Superman arrives and breaks free from the arm restraints Batman put on her. In the ensuing struggle she destroys a $50,000 piece of equipment Batman was using to analyze her and Batman tells Superman he owes him the cost. This is of course stupid because the money is nothing to Bruce Wayne and it's Batman's own fault for shackling a Kryptonian. Kara is taken to a more secure location in Superman's Fortress of Solitude and finds herself attacked by Krypto. The implication is that Krypto has a dog's sixth sense about good and bad people but this is all a red herring that goes nowhere. Batman is also suspicious of Kara's, ""sudden appearance"". I'm sorry, was she supposed to GRADUALLY crash land on Earth. Let me also say that I hate this interpretation of Batman. Any non action scene has him standing there, his cape tightly wrapped around his body with a squinty glare and a grimace. Plus, his sanctimonious paranoia about Kara is completely wrong but I'll get to that later.

We get a way too lengthy scene of Clark and Kara going on a shopping spree that I cannot imagine appeals in the least to the target audience. Suddenly some unknown attackers assault the pair and it turns out to be Wonder Woman and Harbinger. Here's the back story on this one. Harbinger has seen a vision of Kara dying and she and WW decide to protect her by violently kidnapping her. Now despite her name and myriad of powers, foretelling the future was never a power Harbinger was known to have. Plus, she apparently is terrible at it. There is no reason for them to attack Kara and Clark rather than talk to them but it squeezes in an extra action scene. Flash forward several months finds Kara being trained on Paradise Island to fight like an Amazon which is stupid considering she's a Kryptonian. More stupidity ensues before a boom tube opens and out comes Doomsday. Oh no. The unstoppable monster who killed Superman. And then 100 more Doomsday's who proceed to duke it out with our heroes and the Amazonian's. I forgot to mention that Kara wandered off before the fight started. One might think that an army of Doomsday's would be a completely unstoppable force but nah. Superman kills them all with one blast of his heat vision before flying off because he senses something amiss. He finds a dead blond woman face down on the beach just as Harbinger vision had foretold except it's not Kara, it's Harbinger herself. That... is... STUPID. Are we to believe that Harbinger couldn't tell the difference between her own death and the death of a woman she had never even met before? How would she even draw the mistaken conclusion that it was Kara? Plus, the vision, as it happens, ONLY happened because they brought Kara to Paradise Island as a response to the mistaken vision.

Turns out Kara was kidnapped by Darkseid to make her the head of his Honor Guard and our heroes need to travel to Apocalypse to rescue her. I'll make this brief because this is turning into a very long review. Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and Big Barda use a boom tube to get to Apocalypse and split up ala Scooby Doo. Batman beats up and intimidates some of Darkseid's guards because that seems likely and then comes across an unguarded weapons cache capable of blowing up the planet 500 times over. Yeah, seriously. Kara has been turned to the dark side by Darkseid's manipulation and battles Superman while Batman strikes a deal with Darkseid to release Kara in exchange for not blowing up Apocalypse. Everyone's happy (except Darkseid) cue ending and we aren't even at the 60 minute mark. We finish the movie off with an extra battle between Superman and Kara versus Darkseid in Smallville before the punishment is finally over.

The script of extraordinarily dumb, the animation uneven and there was only one fight sequence that I even liked. All the characters stood in annoyingly heroic superhero stances and Darkseid's voice acting was done better on the Superfriend 30 years ago. This one is positively awful and just won't stop hurting the viewer. As they drive into Smallville there's a sign that proclaims it the ""Cream Corn Capital of the World"". Really? Who writes this garbage? This is based on a comic by Jeff Loeb but I never read it. I really hope the comic is better than this but I remember when this story first appeared in Superman/Batman and I skipped it because the reviews were so bad. Usually the worst I'll say for a DCU animation is to make sure you watch it for free but in this case free is too much. Total dud.",1293667200,5,5501,4.61491317671093
4115579,4,B003ES5JEC,"While the title of this DVD led me to expect a little more Batman (the story focuses mainly on Superman and Kara), I really enjoyed this presentation.  First of all, the animation was, of course, wonderful.  The storyline was interesting and entertaining with plenty of action.  Parts were a little confusing (there is another female character who looks a lot like Kara and it was sometimes difficult to tell them apart but I figured it out, eventually). I really enjoyed seeing Wonder Woman in action again, along with Big Barda, who was a nice surprise.  I always relish an opportunity to watch a new or rarely seen character on screen.  There are some great action scenes featuring WW and BB up against the Furies of Apocalypse.  I love watching Batman and the other men of DC but, being a woman myself, I appreciate strong female characters and would like to see more female leads in future releases.  Going back to Wonder Woman, I was happy to hear Susan Eisenberg, who has been my favorite WW.  Of course, it's always a pleasure to listen to Kevin Conroy and Tim Daly is solid as Superman.  The rest of the cast did an excellent job.  WB does not disappoint.

On to the special features...There is a sneak peak at the upcoming All-Star Superman, which looks interesting.  I was a little unsure if it's going to be an action comic, along the lines of the Jonah Hex short, because they did not show any actual animated scenes but it is advertised as an animated original movie.  We also get previews for several DC moves already available.

The Green Arrow short was a nice treat (there's a brief appearance by Black Canary, as well).

The featurette on Supergirl, from her origins in the comics to her portrayal on the big screen, was really interesting to watch how her character has evolved over the years.  There are also two episodes from the animated series to watch.",1293408000,2,1877,4.642424242424243
4115580,4,B003ES5JEC,"I really appreciated this film from Warner Bros. and DC Animated crews putting together a film that was nearly a copy of the original graphic novel, which novel was put together by the excellent writing of Grant Morrison.

The script was written by Tab Murphy and he really runs with the ball!  There are clear differences between the DVD and the comic, including a completely different ending which I thought was more realistic than the Morrison version (no spoilers here!).

The film starts out with Gotham City blimps patrolling the streets of Gotham with huge spotlights that the narrator says are being protested by civic rights groups.  That was interesting, but this fact was never brought up again, nor issue was confronted.  Made me wonder why bring it up!

We jump into the main story, to briefly summarize, Batman and Superman discover a ship that turns out the be from Krypton and inside is a teenaged blonde who claims to be Kal's cousin.  Batman is suspicious.  Superman tells him to knock off being so suspicious.  Wonder Woman tells them both to give it a rest!

Pros:  I loved the banter in the film as well as the camaraderie between our Worlds Finest team.  Wonder Woman really shone in the book and the film is no exception.  Her willingness to kick some butt and stick a bloody spear into an enemy or two is probably one reason this film is PG-13.

Another plus is the brainwashing of Supergirl into the clutches of Darkseid.  I've always been a fan of Kirby, and to see his Fourth World come alive was excellent -- Big Barda, Granny Goodness (voiced oddly enough by Ed Asner!) and the Furies were great to behold.

A cameo by Doomsday was fun, as well as the knock down drag out by both Kryptonians against Darkseid and his evil Omega beam force!

Cons: Supergirl being introduced into the world by intensive shopping for clothes was a bit much but I'm sure the teenage girls will love that part.  The world of Apocalypse with its roaring volcanoes gives it the impression that the planet is super hot and produces enough lava to make a Hawaiian volcano burp in shame.  Was pretty unrealistic to me that a near god as Darkseid would live on such a world or why.

All in all, this DVD was great on the action and though I was sorry to see a few changes to Morrison's tale, still the alternate ending was satisfying.  The DVD has several ""making of"" regarding films already made such as Justice League - Crisis on Two Earths, Batman Under the Red Hood and so on.

What's missing is any kind of dialogue on the making of Apocalypse, story boards, voice actor interviews, etc.  Hopefully this DVD will be re-released with more features.  This particular one DVD set was sparse.

The preview of the new All Star Superman was interesting -- based on the Frank Quitely comic book of a year or so ago -- very exciting news from the DC Universe for 2011.

Recommended.

4115581,5,B003ES5JEC,"Great Batman/Superman animation. Great job with the storyline and the action in great relation to the comic storyline as well. This story may be about Supergirl but without the supporting cast of Batman, Superman, the great villain of Darkseid, and the Female Furies the story would have been just okay. It is a fast pace movie with plenty of action for everyone. If you love Batman or Superman you will love this too.",1291680000,,418,4.739726027397261
4115582,5,B003ES5JEC,"""Superman & Batman: Apocalypse"" is the best superhero film I have ever seen. It's made by the same people who made the Batman and Superman animated series. It's even got the same actors in it. But this is not a continuation of those shows. This is a completely separate adventure. It's actually a sequel to the film ""Superman & Batman: Public Enemies"", which I have never seen so I can't comment on that one, but ""Apocalypse"" is a great movie. It's got a great story in it, great voice actors, great animation, some great comical moments in it, some great drama, and a hell of a lot of action.

The Plot:

Batman investigates a mysterious meteor shower in Gotham City, one meteorite in particular that landed in Gotham harbor. Upon arriving on the scene, Batman finds some chunks of Kryptonite and a mysterious spacecraft. It doesn't take long before Batman realizes that whoever was in the craft is now gone. Meanwhile its passanger, a young woman, wanders the city. Scared, confused, and unable to control her amazing powers, she starts causing havoc in Gotham City. Finally, Batman subdues her with some Kryptonite.

After questioning her, Superman discovers she is Kara, his cousin from Krypton whose father also suspected Krypton's end and sent her to Earth as well. Superman rejoices the fact that not only has another one of his kind has survived Krypton's destruction, but it's his own cousin. However, Batman has his suspicions of her. And Wonder Woman believes she needs more traning in order to control her powers. As for the evil Darkseid, he has his own ideas.

Darkseid sends an army of Doomsday creatures to attack Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman, and in the confussion of the battle, Darkseid manages to kidnap Kara. Darkseid plans to brainwash her into serving him and plans to use her to lead his armies to conquer the universe. Now Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman along with Barda, the woman who use to lead Darkseid armies before she rebelled, travel to Apocalypse in order to get her back. So begins an epic action-packed adventure that ends with Darkseid's final defeat and the beginning of a new superhero, Supergirl!

An epic film with more action than I have ever seen in a superhero movie before. I very much enjoyed this film, and if you're a fan of superhero movies like I am, then you'll love this one.

Highly recommended!",1291680000,,2358,4.795566502463054
4115583,4,B003ES5JEC,"Overall movie was pretty good, they made it as a direct sequel to Public Enemies but the only connecting point is the giant kryptonite meteor.

If you cannot tell from the cover of the DVD case Supergirl is introduced & kidnapped by Darkseid since he cannot get Superman to kneel to him. He does his brainwashing thing and sets a dark Supergirl (dressed like a stripper of course) against Superman knowing Superman will not fight his own cousin. Other stuff happens both before and after this event but I don't want to spoil anything for anyone.

Movie is pretty violent with lots of action, plenty of fights, an army of Doomsdays and a few surprise moments. Honestly the only thing I don't like about this movie is the design of Superman's face... he looks like the world's most Amazonian transexual. Something about the cheekbones and the fact he looks like he's wearing tons of eyeliner does not help.",1290988800,,904,4.715189873417722
4115584,4,B003ES5JEC,"I watched this movie with my little niece the other day. I'm a big comics fan and I thought it wasn't bad. There was some good action, a bit of humor and pathos, and the animation wasn't mind blowing but it did the job. All in all, this is a decent if not memorable movie. That's my take on it.

  My niece on the other hand loved it. She's in her pre-pre-teen years and while she loves animation (she still calls them cartoons) what she really likes are stories with strong female leads. She likes it when girls are the heroes. I think that's why she loved this movie.

  You have a few cute scenes with Super Girl (Kara Zor-El) palling around with Clark Kent when she first arrives on Earth. You have some great fight scenes involving Super Girl, Wonder Woman, Big Barda, the Female Furies and an entire nation of Amazon Warriors. This movie showcases tough, capable women warriors as well as a strong, tough-minded teenage girl.  My niece ate it up. She can't wait for more like this. She is even getting into the comic books. Seeing ""girl superheroes"" on an even footing with ""boy superheroes"" made a big impression on her. I hope the studios produce more like this one. So does my niece.",1290988800,72,1192,4.440366972477064

4115593,2,B003ES5JEC,"The pieces just did not fit. As the characters would speak, the camera shot only displayed their upper lip to the top of their head, in close up shots. That just didn't make any since. Batman was portrayed as indestructible. He was thrown around like a rag doll, and through a brick wall by Apocalypse, and should have died, but it didn't even leave a mark. At the end, Apocalypse beat the mess out of SuperMan and SuperGirl, and SuperMan was even knocked unconscious for about 10 minute, yet with one eye blacken and closed, he threaten an un blemished Apocalypse never to return, as he for forced throw a bub tub. I guess not, he didn't want another beating. Don't waste your money. You would be better off watching paint dry.",1290297600,2,728,4.5227272727272725
4115594,3,B003ES5JEC,"My review of this title is going to be based primarily off the last two DC Comics titles I watched more than anything else. I'll be brief. In comparison to ""Batman:Under the Red Hood"" and ""Justice League:Crisis on Two Earths"" this one pales in comparison. I think more than any reason it does is because of the storyline. Having a girl at the heart of the storyline who basically has the same powers as Superman just didn't do it for me. However,  even the art direction seemed a little off to me. And the battles between ""DarkSeid"" and the ""good"" guys seemed kind of silly. It almost seemed like watching a pong match where each person gets a ""whack"" back and fourth. Sure, this is probably the norm when telling a story but it seemed the ""DarkSeid"" character had only one power and he kept using it over and over. It just got monotonous. I think it lacked creativity. If you haven't already seen ""Batman:Under The Red Hood"" or ""Justice League:Crisis on Two Earths"" I highly recommend you watch those titles first. The storyline in each of those titles is way superior. This one I can only recommend if you have lots of money, some time to kill anyway(i.e., nothing else you could be doing instead of) or you are just a die-hard DC Comics fan and you must watch it regardless of the reviews.",1290297600,2,1292,4.497872340425532

4115598,4,B003ES5JEC,"Being so far being the only direct sequal to one of the DC Universe movies, Superman/Batman: Apocalypse acts as a follow-up to Superman/Batman: Public Enemies. It was based on the second story arc from the Superman/Batman comic book series which regularly teams up the World's Finest, although this one acts more as an origin story for Supergirl in the new DC Universe. Lauren Montgomery takes over from Sam Liu as the director, who also did the Wonder Woman and Green Lantern animated movies. Tim Daly and Kevin Conroy return as the voices of the title characters, along with Susan Eisenberg coming back from Justice League as Wonder Woman, and Ed Asner reprising his role as nasty-ass Granny Goodness. The addition of the sultry Summer Glau as Supergirl is a real bonus for the fans too. Despite the title though, there isn't anything really ""apocalyptic"" about it, at least not in the Earth-destroying kind of way.

Set sometime after Luthor was impeached, a chunk of the Kryptonite crashes into Gotham Harbor, which had a small lifepod in it. Batman goes to investigate, and discovers that there was an occupant in the pod with powers and abilities far beyond those of normal hot blonde chicks. While walking around dazed in Gotham, she realizes she has super-strength, heat vision, and can fly. Batman tries to bring her in, but the mystery girl accidently knocks down one of Gotham's numerous automated police blimps(might wanna rethink about having those be piloted, Gotham PD!). Superman stops the blimp from causing any real damage, and after Batman scans the alien girl at the Batcave, he realizes that she's really his cousin, Kara Zor-El. Superman brings her to the Fortress of Solitude where he brings her up to date on Earth and its culture. He tries passing her off as Clark Kent's cousin, although Wonder Woman steps in to take Kara to Themyscara for special training so she can control her powers better. Cut to a few months later, Kara has had special warrior training under Wonder Woman and Artemis(the ""ex-Wonder Woman""), and befriends Harbinger, who here she just goes by the name Lyla. Meanwhile, Darkseid plans to kidnap Kara to add her to his honor guard, so he teleports an army of downgraded Doomsday clones to keep the heroes occupied while he kills Lyla and makes off with Kara. The Big Three enlist Big Barda for a Boom Tube to Apokolips(that's how its spelled!), and all go off on seperate missions. WW and Barda take on Granny Goodness' Female Furies, Batman tracks down a storehouse of explosions, while Superman battles a brainwashed Kara who is intent on destroying her cousin. Batman threatens to use Darkseid's explosives to destroy Apokolips if he doesn't release Kara from his control, and he reluctantly lets her go. Once back on Earth, Clark takes Kara to live on the Kent farm for a while, but Darkseid bursts out of the house(probably was waiting their couch!)and wailes on Superman by Falcon Punching him into the atomosphere. Kara gets pissed, and starts tearing Darkseid a new a-hole, however Darkseid gets the advantage. Superman gets a brief solar recharge which gives him the strength to beat the rocks out of Darkseid, and ship him through a Boom Tube into deep space. Kara then decides she wants to use her powers to protect people, so she adopts the identity of Supergirl to follow in her cousin's bootprints.

Unlike a few of the other DC Universe movies, this one followed the comic book pretty much to the letter. There were quite a few but still minor changes in Superman/Batman: Public Enemies, but this really stuck to the original source material. The character designs were closely modeled after those of the artist's, the later Michael Turner, with the characters being very lean and muscular. The film also has probably some of the best fight sequences in a DC Universe production since Wonder Woman. The Special Edition DVD and Blu-Ray also features an original DC Showcase of Green Arrow, plus a cool retrospective on the history of Supergirl. You don't have to watch the original Super/Bats movie in order to enjoy this on its own, that and its a great introduction to Power Girl Jr.!",1289865600,,4148,4.873937677053824

However, the litho cell was less than desired. As far as the movie goes you can expect it to be a stand alone from the original superman storyline (in terms of the old show) and although it does say it is a superman/batman movie (there is a reference to the first that some may or may not catch) it still focuses more on supergirl and her origin.

Its more of a superman movie than anything, it shows a seminal story line for supergirl.

So why 2 stars?

First, since it had a PG-13 rating I was expecting some more action. Most of the movie is... pretty.... damn... slow... the only reason this movie attained such a rating is that it said the word b*tch one time. Also, Im not a big fan of how bright the animation is, I'd prefer something considerably darker. Also there was nothing special about the plot....

All in all, I was lookin for something a bit more adult... but this movie fails in every way. Theres no reason this couldn't of been aired on television, nothing special aboutn the plot, action, or animation.....

If you wanna see something truly worthy of a DVD release watch Batman: Under the Red Hood.",1289692800,4,872,4.528662420382165

If I had to compare it to Marvel's animated films, I'll say it's similar in greatness w/ ""Hulk Versus"". The animation here seriously looks like the late Michael Turner's art jumping right off the funny pages. ""Apocalypse"" is one of the animated films of 2010.",1289174400,,531,4.911111111111111

Overall I enjoyed the new story about Super-girl, who should be actually called Super Woman.  The film was fast paced and worth the price of admission.  I especially enjoyed the friendship aspect between Bruce Wayne(Batman) and Clark Kent(Superman.

The strength of the movie was on Darkseid as the nemesis. There are many movies that could created from the New Gods universe. I wanted to see more of Mr. Miracle teaming up with Superman. I hope DC returns to this Kirby created universe.",1289174400,,768,4.8320610687022905
4115605,5,B003ES5JEC,"As a casual comics reader, these days (I was a comics junkie, when the Silver Age was at it's peak), I 'keep up' with the DC Universe far more through the DVD releases, and I must admit, ""Superman/Batman: Apocalypse"" is one of my favorites, for several reasons. First, Kevin Conroy, Tim Daly, and Susan Eisenberg are truly matchless as the voices of Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman! I've liked some of the other star portrayals, but the originals are the best! Andre Braugher doesn't do the galactic menace of Darkseid justice (the TV Supergirl/Darkseid storyline, included, has Michael Ironside, who is dead-on in the role). Summer Glau, as Supergirl, is terrific, and Ed Asner, as Fagin-esque supervillainess Granny Goodness(!) is a hoot, in both versions!

Second, I love the art! I've seen the graphic quality of the animation improve with each new release, and I'm thrilled, especially as I was an unhappy viewer of those horribly animated DC cartoons of the '60s and '70s...

Third, the special features...It's a treat listening to the DC 'Bullpen' reminisce about characters, and enjoy new, and classic shorts; in addition to the Darkseid/Supergirl tale, there is a new Green Arrow/Black Canary short that simply rocks, with action AND romance! (Yes, they are two of my favorite characters...)

Finally, the price...a two-disc collection with all this neat stuff, for under $20...Gotta love it!

4115607,4,B003ES5JEC,"It finally feels like a step back in time when you hear Kevin Conroy, Tim Daly, and to my surprise Susan Eisenberg reprising their past DCAU characters.  Conroy has been the mainstay Batman voice since I first heard Batman speak so that means for me that he is the barometer against anyone else doing voice over for Batman.

Tim Daly likewise was the first Superman/Clark Kent I ever heard in animation.  Same applies to Susan Eisenberg as Wonder Woman. Another kick was having Ed Asner back as Granny Goodness. So it makes for much nostalgia if you are very trivia minded when it comes to voice actors.

Yes Superman the Animated Series has a Supergirl origins story where Superman finds her in stasis on a frozen wasteland of a planet called Argos. A sister planet to DCAU's Krypton.  A planet torn from its natural orbit path when Krypton exploded. Krypton's destruction is likewise an altered matter because I have seen it a couple different ways over the years.

Some stake it as a byproduct of too much technology and too little nature. In short Krypton is ruined by its dependency on its apparent achievements. This is what I gathered from the 1970s film Superman.

StAS version is likewise grounded in Krypton's dependence on technology as they trusted Brainiac instead of Jor-El.  Jor-El is proven right in the end. Kal is the only Kryptonian survivor. Unless you count the multiple perverse incarnations of Brainiac who repeatedly darkened Superman's door and Earth's.  He was one of three regular foes to DCAU's Superman.  The other two are Luthor and Darkseid.

Luthor in DCU continuity was the main villain of Public Enemies and Apocalypse by design implies the main enemy is going to be Darkseid.  Darkseid has Supergirl abducted, brainwashed, and turned against Superman. Sure it might seem like a rehash of both Little Girl Lost and Legacy form StAS. The parallels aren't lost on me, but I treat it as a separate story from DCAU as it is not part of that continuity to my mind.

The comics have divergent continuities and for a time DCAU continuity has avoided that.  The only way I have been able to rectify the various films is to treat them as separate from what I have already seen or read.

The animation is in the same vein as Public Enemies as it should be since both are from the same run of Batman/Superman tales.

There are other DCU films that I have enjoyed much more than this one.  Namely Justice League: The New Frontier, Batman: Under The Red Hood, and Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths.  What ultimately matters to me is I get something out of it, that I can go back and watch it again, and not everyone will agree with me when I say there are some things about these films that will always make me buy them.

Such as who who worked on them, who the voice actors are, and that's the way I buy.",1289088000,,2829,4.599601593625498

Im a big batman fan so for me in this movie he was a let down.  Batman is rarely done justice in a superman movie mostly because batman can't really handle the badguys that superman can. Batman is better in movies where the badguy is lex luthor like in public enimies or the joker. He's best when he uses stealth and his ninja like abilities. In this movie he does none of that.  Not counting batman, this movie is worth watching if your in to the dc universe.  Wonder woman is the truth. They need to give her her own movie.  Her fight scenes are by far the best in the movie. Superman was good in this movie and the final fight scene with him is epic.

He seems to be included only because the story began in Gotham. It focuses mostly on Supergirl and her arrival on Earth, and her eventual notice by Darkseid.

This movie was dedicated to making sure the word BUTCH was heard loud and clear. I know you must be thinking butch,but think of a derogatory word for the human female. We own all the DC COMICS Blu-ray releases. Most of them have bad language or become slanted in some peculiar way to attempt to lower someones self esteem. Ex: The captured pilot in Wonder Woman. Remarks and attempting to get her drunk. I complain because my child loves the JLA and the actions,words or demeanor are just not acceptable. What is one to do?

Kevin Conroy and Tim Daly are the best voice-over Batman and Superman, respectively.  Any future Superman/Batman movies must include these actors.  Summer Glau was a very convincing Supergirl.  She did an impressive job conveying Kara's internal struggles throughout the movie.  Big Barda was a pleasant addition.

The greatest surprise in the movie was Susan Eisenberg as Wonder Woman.  Keri Russell did an acceptable job as a ""Year One"" Wonder Woman; but Susan is the ideal voice for the Queen of the Amazons.  The next DC Comics animated movie has to involve Batman, Superman,and Wonder Woman with Kevin, Tim and Susan as the main characters.

4115613,4,B003ES5JEC,"The powers that be at DC animation can't be accused of glossing over a good storyline when choosing animated features.

The latest installment; Superman/Batman: Apocalypse takes an animated swing at what is arguably one of the best comic book story arcs over the past decade, yet provide even more oomph than what was mustered by the creators.

Writer Jeph Loeb and the late, great Michael Turner's take on the emergence of Kara Zor-el as Supergirl spawned multiple editions, alternate covers, and action figures. The DC bestseller also managed to bring together a multitude of classic DC characters including Wonder Woman, Big Barda and Darkseid. Perhaps more telling was the struggle the heroes felt in trying to wrap their heads around Earth's newest visitor from space.

With the stage set by the original comic, the animated feature tracks along nicely. The animators seemed to carefully include certain imagery reminiscent of the book while also making improvements. Tim Daly and Kevin Conroy, once again, nail their parts. Summer Glau brought much enthusiasm to Kara's character, as her parts shined. Fans of the JLU/JL Cartoon Network series will be glad to hear Susan Eisenberg reprise her voice for Wonder Woman, as well as Ed Asner's re-voicing Granny Goodness. On the flipside, Andre Braugher's take on Darkseid was soft. As with any book to film adaptation, there are some omissions, but neither takes away from the animated telling of the story.

The 2-disc DVD, as with most of the DC direct to DVD offerings, isn't a necessary buy - the feature, as well as the Green Arrow short - which deserves a review all its own - but simply stated, is awesome - are a fair buy. The historical featurette of Supergirl on disc 2 appeared to be more of an advertisement for Smallville as opposed to biography. Bruce Timm's picks - a now standard item on 2-DVD sets - were modest filler.

DC animators appear to be gathering steam, producing regular features, highlighting artists and stories already on the news-stands. If this follows suit, DC fans can continue to expect our favorite pages to come to life as they have with this DVD.",1288396800,,2137,4.925
4115614,5,B003ES5JEC,"This is the latest entry in the DC Comics series of animated movies and it's one of their best! I love the conflict created between Batman & Superman concerning the new visitor from Krypton-who just happens to be Superman's cousin,Kara. Batman doesn't trust her,and Superman wants to protect her since she can't control her powers. Add Darkseid to the mix and you have action personified! Supergirl,in this movie,doesn't seem like a kid,instead she is someone who knows(or think she knows)what she wants,which is not to be a superhero like her cousin! Darkseid takes advantage of this,hoping to defeat Superman once and for all! The final showdown,pitting Darkseid against both Superman and Supergirl is one you have to see to believe! Once again,it's rated PG13,as all of these films are,so be cautious about letting younger children view this. The DC showcase short featured Green Arrow and his ladylove,Black Canary and really makes me want a full length Green Arrow movie!

As always,there is preview of the next movie in the series,which in this case in called""All Star Superman""and is based on the comic book of the same name. This is sort of old school Superman and I think it will be awesome! There is alos a documentary about the Supergirl character and the two-part Supergirl episode from the Superman animated series.

Overlord Darkseid (Voiced by Andre Braugher) decides that she would make an excellent addition to her super female soldiers on planet Apokolips but can Superman, Batman and Wonder-Woman save her from being a slave to Darkseid forever?

Another excellent DC animated adventure! based on an original story by Jeph Loeb, this movie brings us something brilliantly animated and well made. Bruce Timm who supervises every DC animated show and animated DC movie does it again for this time it brings the origin of Supergirl to the small screen featuring all three famed Justice League members together, the showdown between Darkseid with Superman and Supergirl is just breathtakingly awesome to the bone.

4115616,1,B003ES5JEC,"I purchased this movie after being thoroughly blown away by Batman: Under the Red Hood, and was left hoping for another great animated DC film to add to my collection, but was thoroughly disappointed.

There is no kind way to put this, so I'll be blunt.  This movie was fourteen dollars of poop.  Absolute garbage. The animation was second rate, the dialogue was filled with more cliches than I could dream of, and the story was laughably simple minded and devoid of compelling conflict or emotion.  Everything was cookie cutter, thrown together haphazardly, and altogether disappointing.

I understand that the story is taken from the comics and that integrity of source material has to be recognized, but the dialogue and animation are so poor that I was rescripting the movie in my head as I went to prevent my motor functions from failing.  Superman movies have always been burdened with an excess of brawn where there should be brain and heart, and this on is no exception.  However, the battle scenes, which you'd expect to be compelling in the case of a droll bore of a story, actually disappoint as well with second rate animation being put on display with battle sequences we've seen before.

If you're looking for a great DC movie to satisfy your appetites, I highly recommend Batman: Under the Red Hood.  In my opinion, that movie succeeds in all the ways that this one ultimately fails.",1287964800,5,1398,4.791666666666667
4115617,4,B003ES5JEC,"After watching ""Superman/Batman: Apocalypse,"" I was a bit surprised to find that Wonder Woman also appeared in the animated movie and had the same screen time as -- if not more than -- Batman, yet she didn't receive any billing on the packaging.  Her name appears nowhere, and neither does her image.  Plus, this movie is really about the introduction of Supergirl and not Darkseid or his homeworld of Apokolips.  I guess DC chose to market this story of superheroines as male superheroes?

While the overall storyline was better than the earlier DC Animated movies, it didn't come close to the quality of recent DVDs like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superman-Batman-Public-Enemies/dp/B0027FG2CG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superman/Batman: Public Enemies</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Under-the-Red-Hood/dp/B003ITZBW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman: Under the Red Hood</a>.  I think the script for ""Superman/Batman: Apocalypse"" tried to cram in too many various story arcs.  For this reason, neither the introduction of Supergirl nor Darkseid and his hellish world of Apokolips were given their due.  Everything seemed too rushed.  I did like the surprise appearance of Big Barda, though.

The short extra Green Arrow cartoon on the DVD was fantastic.  I'm glad the emerald archer was given this interesting storyline; his character and personality really shone through.  I'd love to see him get his own full-length DVD movie with the same quality of writing as this short film.

On the second DVD in the Two-Disc Special Edition, there's an interesting and insightful featurette titled ""Supergirl: The Last Daughter of Krypton,"" about the history of Supergirl from her first appearance to today.  It's a fascinating look at the role of women over the past fifty years and how things have changed.

Overall, this was a good effort, but perhaps should have been divided into two movies: one about Supergirl and one about Darkseid and Apokolips.",1287964800,,2057,5.976109215017065

This is now an area where DC is trying to let the full Anima of Japan take on American Anima/cartoons. For me, it was a well thought out story. I do love anima, yet with out the full anima effect, it made the hands and body and even faces of characters seem out of sorts. Unlike the artistic style of Justice League anima characters.

I hope to see more DC movies and TV series to DVD for those of us who will be kids forever. However, either go full throttle with Japan Anima, or stick with America's version of art work used in the Justice Leagues DVD release. I like to collect My Superman and Batman memorabilia. Yet, for all its good intentions, the art work was a little off centered. I am sure DC will continue to create great stuff. I wish they would continue the series Legion of Hero's with cosmic boy and the entire group.",1287532800,,964,4.239130434782608
4115620,3,B003ES5JEC,"I own Batman: TAS, Superman: TAS, Justice League and Justice League unlimited. I've read Batman on and off again for years. I don't like this movie.

Supergirl has had a rough past in the comics. Only recently has she really been given her proper due. I wanted this movie to be as great as the rest of the DC animated universe that I've seen under the care of Bruce Timm. But like Batman & Superman: Public Enemies, this movie just barely passes.

Supergirl comes to earth, and is voiced well by Summer Glau, of Firefly fame. All the voice acting is pretty good. Kevin Conroy never goes wrong as Batman, Tim Daly is just fine as Superman. Wonder Woman, Granny Goodness, it's all good. But the story sucks.

Supergirl comes to Earth. Superman and Batman find her. Supergirl learns English and then turns into a snarky teenage girl whose first goal in life is to go on a shopping spree. This is hack storytelling. Then Superman and Supergirl are ambushed by Amazon warriors, because why not. Wonder Woman, who is usually shown as intelligent, at least in the DCAU, is shown as an idiot as her introduction. Instead of properly talking it out with Superman about the problems of having an all-powerful snarky shopaholic on Earth, they're plan was to kidnap her and bring her to Themyscira...who cares? What was she going to do, kidnap Supergirl, hold her against her will and just not tell Superman? Or tell him afterward and then say 'haha, it wasn't bad guys. Just us gals. Please don't melt our faces or throw our island into space.' I know action is expected, but again, this is hack.

I'd get more enjoyment out of an episode of The Justice League.

There are much better DC animated movies, such as:

Batman: Mask of the Phantasm

Wonder Woman (stellar film, and has Nathan Fillion, also of Firely fame)

Green Lantern: First Flight

4115621,4,B003ES5JEC,"I say that because that's really what this story is about. It isn't really about Superman/Batman Vs. Darkseid as it is more about them (along with Wonder Woman and former Darkseid soldier Bertha) fighting over the fate of Kara Zor-El, better known as Supergirl.

Kara comes to earth and is lost when Batman finds her. Superman and Batman both argue over what to do with her while Wonder Woman enters the fray and takes her to train with her on Themescyra. Meantime, Darkseid has been monitoring the events and decides to make Kara one of his new lieutenants!

What comes is an all out battle over the fate of Kara. Will she become one of earth's newest saviors or one of their biggest threats?

Also included is 4 episodes from the 90's Superman series that centers around Darkseid (Apokolips....Now! pts. 1 and 2) and Supergirl (in her own two parter). You also get a 10 minute short featuring Green Arrow and some behind the scenes extras mainly discussing Darkseid and the mythology behind him, Mr. Miracle, Orion and New Genesis.

I enjoyed ""Apocalypse"" every bit as much as the previous ones done by Bruce Timm.  As my title suggests, there was just one little thing that would have allowed me to enjoy this movie even more.  That would have been Michael Ironside's voice for Darkseid.  For my evidence, I offer Darkseid's appearance in Superman TAS, Justice League TAS and JL Unlimited.  I don't know if Ironside wasn't available or whether he decided not to do it.  I merely think the casting department could and should have tried harder.  Since this movie had so many of the original JL/JLU voices, they should have gotten one of the most distinctive voices of all.  Anyway, that's just my humble opinion.

This one scores more than the previous one for me (which i also liked). This way i can't wait to see Absolute Power or Finest Worlds get an animated movie treatment next year or so.

- The characters' design follows Michael Turner's ones from the comic, but more tamed from some of the scenes in the comic (less sexy if you wish)

- It was a treat to have Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman voiced by their original VAs, something that never happened before since Tim Daly was not in Justice League. Edward Asner's return as Granny was also nice.

- Michael Ironside should have reprised his role as Darkside IMO.

To me, Batman and Superman: The Animated Series displayed the true magical core of what these imortal characters should be. The team of Timm, Dini, Burnett, and Ramono once made these charcters shine. Yes, the character designs were pretty stream-lined, but they worked beautifully. Bruce Timm's unique style gave these characters a renewed life of substance and magic. When I'm asked, ""What is your favorite interpretation of DC??"" The answer is clear. Sadly, now I come to this lowly film.
  First of all, I've never been a fan of ""Pokemon"" animation. And this was a perfect example of it. Superman's face looked funky, as did Batman's. Darkseid looked more like a chimp, and ""BIG"" Barda looked rather like ""Small"" Barda.
Both Bats and Supes weren't fluid in their script. They came off as stiff, boring, and contrived. The only saving grace would be useing the original voices of Conroy and Daly, but even that couldn't save this bomb. I agree with other posts here. ""Supergirl"" lost that endearing quality that I had come to appreciate in the Animated series, while Ma and Pa Kent looked as though they'd just stepped out of a grave. Wonder Woman should have been left with a cameo only, if that much. Again, all too contrived. The only reason I'm giving this one star is for the fact of three original voice actors returning to their respective roles. That, and the big fight with Darkseid against Kal and Kara was pretty cool. Still hated the animation. So now let me go back to the Bats/ Supes animated series or even Justice League animated series. They still have the magic. This movie flops.

From the feature already made for smallville to the two Superman animated episodes you really are not getting your money's worth like other releases.

Granted the absence of any commentary in both this and the Public Enemies 2 disk was a step down, at least the latter provided some insight into other aspects of production and you had an interview with Conroy, while this release ends up feeling like an overprized promo for other WB products (and a waste of an extra disk and plastic)... If this is what Warner is planing on passing for special I recomend going green and simply release one single DVD edition with whatever extras can fit in it and stop wasting our money, time and resources...

ONE Last thing weather it would of been just the BR release, or the not so SPECIAL dvd as well, it would of been nice to have some sort of mention of Michael Turner.  Now alot has been said about these past 3 dvd releases about trying to capture some of the art style present in the original source material.  So given that the movie does mimic his Style and that this was one of his last fully drawn stories (plus the fact he is not with us) it would of been nice to revisit the life of Michael Turner, but this is my personal observation.",1286323200,,1686,4.3706070287539935
4115667,4,B003ES5JEC,"The Review:

Superman/Batman Apocalypse is one of Warner Home Entertainment's direct-to-DVD releases bringing its various super heroes and super heroines from the comic book page to film.  If you're a fan of Smallville on the CW and you enjoy the rebooted Batman live action franchise, then you should give these direct-to-DVD animated films a chance.  Warner Bros. can put out one of these high end animated features every few months and tell a story that would break the bank if they were live action productions.  They are a great deal darker than the Superfriends cartoons of the early 1980s and there is almost zero campiness in the portrayals of Batman and Superman.  Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman's respective rogues galleries are filled with genuinely evil villains, who take lives more often than they rob banks.

Superman/Batman Apocalypse is a bit of a misnomer because it is actually the modern retelling of Supergirl's origin.  Born Kara Zor El, Superman's cousin, she was also sent from the doomed planet Krypton, but due to the intricacies of intergalactic travel landed on earth years after Superman.  Kara's adjustment is a little bit rougher than that of Clark Kent.  She doesn't land in picturesque Smallville, Kansas.  Rather, she lands in the cesspool of Gotham City.  In her first few minutes on earth she is attacked by some sketchy dock workers, the Gotham City Police Department and the Dark Knight himself.  It doesn't help that she only speaks Kryptonian and has no control over her superpowers.  Superman shows up to calm things down and is elated to find out he isn't the last survivor of Krypton anymore.  Batman is somewhat more suspicious of Kara and doesn't trust her at all.

Lurking in the background is Superman's greatest enemy, which believe it or not, is NOT Lex Luthor.  In the modern comic book continuity Superman's greatest enemy is arguably Darkseid.  Darkseid is a god-like being who rules over the dystopian planet, Apocalypse.  He's physically at least as powerful as Superman and for reasons he never makes clear has a special interest in ruling Earth--a goal which Superman and Earth's profusion of superheroes thwart time and again.  Learning of Supergirl, he sees a perfect opportunity to corrupt her and score a psychological blow against the man of steel.  Superman, Batman, and a very, very special guest star take the battle to Darkseid's doorstep.  Superman/Batman Apocalypse is a great action adventure, showcasing some lesser known DC characters alongside mainstays like Batman and Superman.

On the bluray version you'll get a backup Green Arrow story, which is arguably even better than the main story.  Green Arrow has been a big part of the last couple of seasons of Smallville and it's an interesting contrast between the live action Green Arrow and his animated self.  Other bonus materials include 4 episodes from Superman the Animated Series, showcasing both Supergirl and the origin of Superman and Darkseid's conflict.  As this is Smallville's last season, Superman/Batman direct to DVD animated films are a great way to get your superhero fix and probably the only place you can see someone get an upper cut that sends them into orbit.

4115668,5,B003ES5JEC,"This is another well done and casted animated feature. I have found most of the Batman Superman features to have been 4 or 5 stars and this one is definitely a 5. I liked the casting of voices, the art is great and the story line flows as fast as big blue in a hurry. If I recall correctly this was a graphic novel first I just don't recall the Darkseid invovlement, either way it worked beautifully in this animation and all aspects of this movie are faithfully to all characters involved.

4115669,5,B003ES5JEC,"My review title is actually understating my view.  This is one of the best DC animated movies to date.  Not as good as the best of the JLU ones, but close.  Far better than the recent Justice League DVD's that have come out such as New Frontier (which had a disappointing, anticlimactic story).  The animation, direction, and voicings are all quite good (the voices in Crisis on Two Earths were off imo).  The storyline with Supergirl is a bit trite, but still well executed.  The cover art is awesome.  I like that DC was willing to stretch themselves a bit in allowing a more angular and raw art style in this movie.

I also really like that there is some swearing and death. Can't have a Darkseid movie without that.",1286323200,,719,4.476923076923077
4115670,5,B003ES5JEC,"- Kara Zor-El (her first time in Metropolis): ""It's so beautiful here, not like that other city where Grumpyass lives.""
- Clark Kent: ""Grumpyass isn't so bad once you get to know him.""

""Grumpyass"" is, of course, Batman. If you're familiar with writer Jeph Loeb's run at the SUPERMAN/BATMAN comic book, then you're aware that this story arc is the one which brought back Supergirl to the DC Universe. The film opens with an alien vessel careening into the Gotham harbor, with the Dark Knight promptly diving in to investigate. The space ship holds one passenger, this frightened tiny slip of a girl with a lapsed memory who right away begins to demonstrate Kryptonian super powers. This alarms the Bat.

Superman, however, is a boy scout, and he tends to see the glass as half-full (unlike Batman who instead would be lifting fingerprints off the same glass). But, then, the Man of Steel also touts this handy-dandy ability to speak Kryptonian. In his dialogue with the mysterious girl, he learns that she is Kara Zor-El and his long lost cousin. Batman grows steadily concerned as Superman welcomes the girl without reservations, wholeheartedly takes her under his wing, reveals his secret identity to her. But, then again, Batman and paranoia go together like Big Barda and BBW magazine. No surprise that the presence of Kara Zor-El will test Superman and Batman's friendship. But, well, there's always something testing their friendship. They're not that tight.

SUPERMAN/BATMAN: APOCALYPSE is another outstanding DC Universe Animated Original Movie, and it brings to life one of the more memorable DC story lines in recent years. I'm partial to Supergirl, always have been. I couldn't tell you how gutted I was when she sacrificed her life in CRISIS ON INFINITE EARTHS two decades ago. This is the true Supergirl here, not Matrix the protoplasm, not Andromeda, not the futuristic Cir-El. And Jeph Loeb was able to spin a new origin for Kara Zor-El, in keeping with contemporary times, and the film clings pretty closely to his story. I love that APOCALYPSE presents several really good character moments here, little scenes which flesh out not only Kara's bubbly, confused persona but the rest of the cast's, as well. Given, it's cliched stuff, but I enjoyed it when Clark, all big brotherly, takes Kara shopping for clothes in Metropolis.

Is it too late to throw on a mild SPOILER alert? I'll do it here.

Bruce informs Clark that Kara is able to harness sunlight more efficiently than him, this potentially making her more powerful than Superman. As such, I guess it makes sense that Wonder Woman would step in and pretty much abduct Kara to Paradise Island, Themyscira, for a stint of rigorous combat training and, more crucially, to teach her how to control her powers. Except that she should've asked Superman first. As it is, this tests Superman and Wonder Woman's friendship (Everyone seems to be getting on Superman's nerves lately).

But the real conflict surfaces when Darkseid seeks a new Captain for his elite honor guard, the Furies, and he's soon eyeballing Kara as a likely candidate. And whatever Darkseid covets...

The voice cast is mostly good. I could never have beef with Kevin Conroy and Tim Daly reprising their iconic turns as Batman and Superman, respectively. Summer Glau is really likable as Kara Zor-El, and Ed Asner again voices Granny Goodness (who, as always, seems to struggle with a bout of Adrenal adenoma). I did have a bit of an issue with Andre Braugher as Darkseid, but it's probably just me. To this day, I associate Braugher with his Detective Pembleton role from HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREET.

There's so much packed into the story - and a good chunk of it, epic - that it's hard to believe it runs at a mere one hour, 18 minutes. It's always nifty to see DC Comics' Big Three together, and I felt like girding my loin when they - plus a certain former Captain of Darkseid's honor guard - finally storm the nightmarish world of Apokolips. And the animation? It's great. It terrifically apes Michael Turner's artwork while also echoing an anime flavor. I wonder if some rotoscoping was involved because the characters' movements look convincing and amazingly fluid, especially during the dynamic action sequences. Because Supergirl is the featured character, it's gratifying to see her unleash an arsewhoopin' late in the game. It's something to behold. Of course, Batman still gets that sexy signature victory, and earns Darkseid's respect along the way.

I like the little touches. I like that the movie opens up with a newscaster referencing ""President Luthor's impeachment,"" which is a callback to the SUPERMAN/BATMAN: PUBLIC ENEMIES movie. I like the sometimes dysfunctional energy displayed among the core characters. I like that Wonder Woman comes across as no-nonsense, a fierce warrior princess. And I love Big Barda, man. And that scene with Kara and Krypto is hilarious. Note that this film earns a PG-13 rating for violence and some mild profanity which, reprobate that I am, I think is awesome.

Marvel's animation film studio needs to do some catching up, post haste.

I've got the single DVD edition, because I'm no moneybags. The bonus material on it: a sneak peek at ALL-STAR SUPERMAND, the next DC Universe Animated Original Movie (00:10:46 minutes long), as well as three regurgitations in the form of behind-the-scene looks at BATMAN: UNDER THE RED HOOD, JUSTICE LEAGUE: CRISIS ON TWO EARTHS, and SUPERMAN/BATMAN: PUBLIC ENEMIES. I guess you'll have to get the 2-DVD set if you want some more bonus stuff.",1286236800,,5570,4.959271168274384
4115671,5,B003ES5JEC,"I quote Adriana Romano when she says: ""When we get a new project we always want to make it better than the last"" After a tremendous success with `Batman: Under The Red Hood' The DCAU gang presents us with not only a brand new movie, but the first official sequel in their line of made for DVD DC films. `Superman/Batman Apocalypse' is the sequel to the graphic novel and film of the same name (Superman/Batman: Public Enemies) I have to say that this one delivers on a scale like none of the previous films.

Apocalypse starts right where Public Enemies left off with a brand new discovery in Gotham City, it a girl with powers that are quite familiar to a hero we know. Once discovered that this girl is in fact Superman's' cousin he feels a whole new responsibility besides just playing hero. Still, while she may look innocent Batman always has that little hair standing up in the back of his neck and he has all the right. In the shadows there is a dark presence that is always looking to hurt Superman at any second and this new found family may be the final breaking point.

A lot of people were left dissatisfied with this new film because of the plot. While it is a Superman/Batman, Batman doesn't have much of a part in the story. Well if you are looking for instant gratification then yes you have all the right to be upset, but truth be told he is pretty much a presence throughout the whole film. He is the reason that leads to the chain of events with Darkseid, and the appearance of Wonder Woman, and he is pretty much the reason why Super girl tries so hard to break away from the fact that she has powers and that she is a possible threat. What really makes up for the lack of Batman's' face time is his one-liners. Batman never really gets an opportunity to be funny, so I loved the fact that some of his dialogue lets out a few belly laughs.  What I loved the most about this story was the pace. I liked the fact that it was a story that was thought out and very deep in dialogue. The chemistry and feelings that the characters have for one another is done very well and the fact that they got some of the voice actors from the television series including Ed Asner as Granny Goodness was a huge positive. The action sequences in this film are probably some of the best I have ever seen. Even the fights that have multiple opponents are very crisp and easy to follow on screen. They are also very well choreographed some of the moves that I watched I don't think I have seen in a DCAU film before. It seems with every new movie there is just so much more effort put into the animation there are points you have no idea you are watching an animated film.  Also there is a great surprise close to the end, which was definitely a little tease moment, just so the fans would know that Bruce Timm wouldn't let us down and always give us what we want.

With every new film that gets released, the DCAU films just keep getting better and better. This year was probably the best because all 3 films that have been released were just a cut above in terms of story, acting and just sheer awesomeness. Pick up the 2 Disc editions on DVD so you get the 3rd DC Showcase of Green Arrow. I will say that it is definitely worth the extra cash because is it an action packed short, with great acting and humor.",1286236800,4,3310,4.281150159744409
4115672,5,B003ES5JEC,"The DC Animation machine has been turning out quality animated films for years now.  And finally, after only Wonder Woman receiving a starring role in her own film, Supergirl has been gifted the spotlight.  Falling under the ""Superman/Batman"" line, this film follows closely (as you probably already know) the ""Return of Supergirl"" story line, which features the long awaited return of the most famous Supergirl, Kara Zor-el.

The film itself is faithful to the source work, with added scenes and a more fitting ending added on.  The art style does a great job a replicating the amazing work of the late Michael Turner.  The women in this film look amazing and special attention should be paid to the fantastic fight scene that features Wonder Woman and Big Barda battling The Furies.  The girls get in some good punches and look amazing doing it.

As a mega-fan of Supergirl, I was glued to the screen during the film.  The added disc features, most importantly a very well produced mini-doco on the character, was great.  It's great to see the original Supergirl, Ms. Helen Slater still looking so gorgeous and graceful as ever.  Maybe on some long shot, DC Animation will see it fit to give Supergirl her own starring vehicle sometime soon.  That 5 minute look at her in classic blues and reds just wasn't enough!

Another great addition to the already superb DC Animation Library.",1286236800,2,1384,4.842553191489362
4115683,1,B003ES5JEC,PC Comics used Superman and Batman's name to sell this super lame piece of trash.,1286150400,3,81,4.466666666666667
4115684,5,B003ES5JEC,"""Superman/Batman: Apocalypse"" is a bang-up direct-to-DVD animated film (adapted from a multi-part storyline from the Superman/Batman monthly comic book) that introduces to a modern audience Kara Zor-El, Superman's cousin from Krypton.  The film has it all: great action, heartfelt drama, and epic wonderment, that last delivered primarily via the story's setting on the hellish planet Apokolips in the latter going, as the powerful, villainous Darkseid attempts to take control of the young and impressionable Kara and use her for his own purposes.

This is the most assured to date of the regularly appearing DC animated films made for the DVD market, and that's saying something, as all of the films thus far have been very good. I especially liked the generous nature of the movie, as we get to see lots of heroes in action, including Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Kara (aka Supergirl), and a variety of Jack Kirby's great ""New Gods"" characters (Darkseid, Granny Goodness, and many others), with the movie being long enough that everyone has a chance to breathe and do their thing.

About the only negative point I can make about the movie is that for some inexplicable reason it looks like Superman is wearing heavy eye shadow throughout.  Oh, well, that's just a quibble.

Extras on the two-disc standard DVD I bought include a decent 17-minute look at the history of Supergirl in the comics, and two episodes from the 1990s Superman animated television series, featuring another take on the origin of Kara Zor-El.  Oh, yes... you also get a terrific 10-minute short featuring the always entertaining Green Arrow.

If this type of material is anywhere up your alley, you can't go wrong picking up ""Superman/Batman: Apocalypse"", putting your feet up, and enjoying the epic mayhem unfold.",1286150400,4,1793,5.11986301369863

4115686,3,B003ES5JEC,"I don't know, let's see, I'm a fan of JL unlimited but I haven't been too impressed with any of the movies. With this one I guess I would start by saying that the title is misleading, it's really a story about Supergirl not Superman or Batman. The animation is a little off too, not my favorite and the direction is just so-so. One big problem I have with these stories is the constant changing of power levels with the characters. In this it just seems like everyone has Superman level strength and I find that annoying. I also didn't really like the personality given to Supergirl here, she wasn't endearing at all but again, annoying. Some of the declarations in this don't sit well either like when Darkseid declares that Supergirl could have been the most powerful being in the Universe... um yeah, bad writing.

I gave this 3 stars but to be honest I feel that once when you've seen this you'll probably never want to see it again. Once was enough for me anyway.",1286064000,,968,4.468926553672317
4115687,3,B003ES5JEC,"Not being familiar with this storyline from the comics, I had only the dvd cover (and synopsis)to pre-judge the movie. Supergirl and Darksied have never been my favorites, but the movie was better than I expected. A welcome surprise was the inclusion of Wonder Woman, Big Barda and other DC characters (Harbinger, etc). It really was like a Justice League movie as opposed to what the title sugests. Supes and Bats were awesome in Public Enemies, but I'm glad this time around WW (and even Supergirl) got much needed screen time. There were a few things I didn't care for such as the use of profanity. Warner/DC, kids will be watching this, not a good idea. Cursing doesn't make cartoon movies more realistic, just less of a quality experience. I'm a huge Batman fan, but it annoyed me that he was an intergral part of the Supergirl origin story, when I don't remember him being so before this movie. I also hate that he gets to fight everyone else's archenemies (see Batman:Brave and the Bold) and even gets to use other heroes powers. It really irked me that he and Supes were shown on a ""particular"" island, seeming so at ease, like their presence there was no big hoopla, where was the queen? I think Kara's storyline could've been more thorough, but otherwise found the movie to be quite entertaining. Wonder Woman's appearance in this film was way better than her turn in her own movie. In parts due to Susan Eisenbergs (JL/JLU) return to the role. Now if they can just not make her hair/face look like Disney's Mulan. Speaking of voice actors, Kevin Conroy IS Batman and Tim Daly does a decent Superman, BUT this time I wouldn't have had a problem if they used other actors, because their voices and the faces didn't match to me. Batman looked like a washed up, oily ex-stud (ie John Stamos), and Superman's voice didn't have the edge that his appearance demanded. I'm only critical because they're among my favorite heroes. I really, really like the move though. The all too brief, Kara meets the Kents scene (in particular Pa Kent) was hillarious.",1286064000,,2056,4.68232044198895
4115688,5,B003ES5JEC,"I own the Superman/Batman graphic novel that this is based on. I thought it was an excellent retelling of the story. Between the beautiful animation, the fight scenes, and the great voice acting I really enjoyed it. However, I do feel Darkseid was miscast. Andre Braugher has a good voice but not a DARKSEID voice.

As I woman and a huge comic book geek, I loved all the strong females. Wonder Woman, Big Barda, etc... But I have to say, I am a HUGE Batman fan, and this is truly a Superman and Supergirl story. I thought that Batman lost some of his presence here, he is almost a minor supporting character.

They leave a few holes in the story that could only be fleshed out if they had made a longer movie. For instance, why was Kara still a teenager when her ship left Krypton at the same time Clark's ship left? They explain that in the book.

***SLIGHT SPOILER FOR THOSE WHO DONT KNOW THE STORY*** The ending is a little different and I have to say. I like the way the movie ends as opposed to the book.

All in all, it is great story and a great movie and any FanBoy or Girl should give it a look-see. This is another home run from DC animated.  Sigh..if only they would remake Hush.

BTW, I loved the Green Arrow short, that should have been a movie.

Everybody gets a good amount of screen time and action. The artwork is a step up from their previous movies but it still has that stiff direct to video look to it. The voice acting is really nice except for Supergirl. The movie follows the comic almost exactly until the end. Then it goes wrong for me. I did not like the way they handled the last fight and the conclusion. It just seems to end. But other than that, this is probably DC's best animated movie.

But DC, if you're listening, you need to make more Wonder Woman movies and not be cowards thinking people won't buy it because of the word ""woman."" The Wonder Woman movie sold more than most of your other movies so you really have no excuse.",1285977600,5,828,4.447368421052632

I was frankfully not very impressed with the animation style, especially Batman's and Superman's faces. The voice actors (especially for Darksied himself) were not what one was really expecting... Darkseid sounds rather...higher pitched than seems right for the character. Please, do not get me wrong, Supergirl is an alright character, but she received alot more screening time than I figured she would.

Here now, I am trying very hard not to go on about the Doomsday replica fight... but, truly... having Wonder Woman 'save' Batman as he absentmindedly runs off in the middle of battle after making a supremely poor showing of it? After pre-ordering this movie (the first time I have ever done so for any media)... well, I shan't be doing that anytime soon again...

Truly, the only reason I gave this movie a 2-star review was because it had redeeming moments. Few and far between, but they were there. I would add this to your DC movie library if you are a 'hard-core' fan only tho, definately not DC's best showing thus far...",1285977600,4,1141,4.816326530612245

I do think this is worth buying: that said . . .

I also think the actor who did Darkseid's voice in Superman The Animated and Justice League had a better voice for the leader of Apocalypse than the actor who did performed his voice in this film.

  The movie picks up where Public Enemies left off with ex-President Luthor arrested and the kryptonite meteor dealt with. Batman still tracking things to ensure that Earth is out of the danger zone tracks a large object fallen into Gotham harbor. That object being a space ship carrying Kara Zor-El  the cousin of Kal-El (Superman.) How Batman and Kara missed each other as he went to the her ship and visa versa is a mystery. As in why she's naked. Though she is soon clothes but the people who greet her. This event remind me a little of Maxima's first appearance on earth in the DC comics. Having trouble with the control of her powers Superman and Batman rush her to fortress of solitide where she can learn English and some control. When Clark give Kara a tour of Metropolis the classic statue of Superman with the perch eagle from Rein of Superman story arch in DC Comics was a nice touch. I do miss the fact that Krypto attacks Supergirl more in the comic story line than the movie but we know there a dim factor need to get Kara to Paradise Island to train with the amazons which include Lyla (Hambringer whose makes her animation debut and was first known as The Monitor's assistant in Crisis On Infinite Earths. Lyla for tells a danger for Kara future which come true when she falls under Darkseid mind control and Big Barbra leads Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman to Apocalypse to rescue her.  The ending is another bit which the comic is an improvement on the movie as when Kara is introduce as Super Girl for the first time in the comics whole Justice League and Justice Society of America are there to greet her while in the movie it only Superman, Batman and the Amazons.

The two disk version has many interesting features. Normal 2 disk version has 2 part Superman animated series episode LITTLE GIRL LOST while the Target special edition of it also has the extra two part episodes of Legacy. There is also a documentary on the history of the Super girl character which include why they think the 1984 live movie that I loved bombed in the box office.

4115695,4,B003ES5JEC,"""Superman/Batman: Apocalypse"" really benefits from the use of Kevin Conroy, Tim Daly, Susan Eisenberg, and Ed Asner, voicing the characters that they did so well in the Batman, Superman, and Justice League series.  The story is pretty good, ""introducing"" Supergirl to the fold, with the young Kryptonian discovering who she is and how she fits into the scheme of things.

Andre Braugher makes a decent Darkseid but after having become accustomed to Michael Ironside in the part, it's a little disconcerting to hear Braugher in the role.

Great animation adds to the enjoyment of the film, with the characters not quite as ""overdrawn"" as in ""Public Enemies."" The fight scenes are well-developed, with the best one being a ""surprise"" near the film's conclusion.

Of the other direct-to-video animated films that Warner has produced since the demise of Justice League, this is the one that is more like a continuation of the series.

The extras on the DVD are excellent, especially the inclusion of the two-part ""Little Girl Lost"" with Nicholle Tom as Kara/Supergirl and it marks the first time that Asner voices ""Granny Goodness.""  He plays the role with much relish and it's an absolute joy to hear him mouth cutesy lines coming from such a malevolent character.  If Tim Curry won an Emmy for the now-defunct ""Peter Pan,"" Asner certainly deserved one for voicing Granny.  The installment also features a brilliant Lolita Ritmanis score that mixes traditional action music with hints of Copland, especially in the scenes taking place in Smallville.

The documentary on Supergirl is captivating, explaining the birth, the death, and resurrection of Superman's cousin.

The Green Arrow short is concise and fast-paced, befitting its short running time.",1285804800,,1748,5.1886120996441285
4115696,3,B003ES5JEC,"Seemingly following Superman/Batman: Public Enemies, Superman/Batman: Apocalypse finds our heroes (once again voiced by Tim Daly and Kevin Conroy respectively) dealing with the arrival of Superman's apparent cousin Kara (voiced by Summer Glau), whose inability to control her powers causes a bit of havoc to say it lightly.  However, her arrival is also noticed by the evil Darkseid (voiced by Andre Braugher) who thus sets his sights on making her his, with Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and Barda standing in his way.  Loosely based on the Supergirl storyline from Jeph Loeb and the late Michael Turner, Apocalypse's animation style is wonderfully authentic to Turner's artwork.  The action is decent enough, and Daly and Conroy will always be the voices of Superman and Batman to me (while Michael Ironside will be the only voice of Darkseid to me as well).  While Superman/Batman: Apocalypse is entertaining, it doesn't have that same degree of fun to it that Public Enemies did, although the final showdown/brawl with Darkseid at the end is worth the price of admission alone.  All in all, Superman/Batman: Apocalypse is a worthwhile endeavor, and another solid entry in DC's line of animated features.",1285804800,,1209,5.243523316062176
4115697,5,B003ES5JEC,"First, the good news:  Superman/Batman APOCALYPSE is an excellent movie and worth buying.  It is at least as good as PUBLIC ENEMIES and better than CRISIS ON TWO EARTHS.  Contrary to reports, Batman is prominently featured and the way that Wonder Woman is introduced early and Darkseid re-introduced late was very well done and each was a bit surprising.  The use of the same voices for Batman (Conroy), Superman (Daly), and Wonder Woman (Eisenberg) helps with continuity to JL/JLU fans, and Summer Glau was excellent as Supergirl.  Andre Braugher was a decent Darkseid, but I missed the deeper, threatening and menacing voice of Michael Ironside.  Kudos for bringing back Ed Asner as the voice of Granny Goodness.  Most importantly, the artwork - more stylistic and `pointed' than in JL or JLU - is not too much of a deviation from the earlier cartoons.

Second, the Blu-Ray edition of APOCALPYSE is excellent.  Even on my 2006 Philips 720p plasma from 2006, colors and images were stunning (I have a Sony 460 Blu-Ray Player).  The improvement from the regular DVD which I also tested was noticeable on my 50"", a bit less so on the 42"" and smaller HDTVs.  Audio was excellent and dialog was easily decipherable without going back and reviewing or using closed captions.  Four cartoons are included from JUSTICE LEAGUE cartoon series and they're all Darkseid-themed with two featuring Supergirl.  The short episode for GREEN ARROW was excellent and the behind-the-scenes features dealing with the DC Universe are a nice touch if you want to see all the extra work that goes into making modern, top-quality cartoon direct-to-disc efforts and explore some of the themes in this and other DC  recent releases.

There aren't a lot of shortcomings but there are a few.  The Superman cartoons included were not upconverted so the quality is mediocre.  I can live with the 4:3 OAR but there is no reason not to improve the picture quality on a Blu-Ray disc for cartoons that aired in the 1990's.  And given the data requirements, I think they could have added more cartoons from JL or JLU featuring Darkseid.  How about some Superman or JL shorts from the 1970's Legion Of Doom years or the early-1980's Legendary Super Powers Show/Galactic Guardians (first cartoon introductions of Darkseid) or some from the ""Lost Episodes"" year ?  Might also help DVD sales of those earlier and long-forgotten series if they piqued today's fans interest.

The movie runs 75 minutes long which is the standard for the DC Universe direct-to-disc cartoons.  If they lengthened the movie a bit they could delve more into issues like Kryptonian mythology or background information on other JL/JLU members or villains like Darkseid or Doomsday.  STARCROSSED remains the best example of great storytelling, action, and background (on Hawkgirl) in the JL/JLU universe, IMO.  GREEN LANTERN: FIRST FLIGHT remains the best of the recent DC releases and I would not have minded seeing Hal Jordan or John Stewart involved in some one-on-one action with Darkseid or any future villains in any future releases.  DC Comics, take note !

All in all, an excellent Blu-Ray disc and well worth the purchase.",1285804800,,3166,4.982857142857143
4115698,5,B003ES5JEC,"I'm not going to give you my view, it can be summed up by reading the other reviewers and looking at the 5 stars I gave this movie. I recommend buying it with the extras.",1285804800,2,170,3.8857142857142857
4115699,5,B003ES5JEC,"Have you ever been watching a superhero movie (animated or otherwise) and noticed that the hero's or villain's skills and abilities seem to wax and wane for ""dramatic"" purposes from one moment to the next?  Have you ever noticed that fight scenes tend to just be a bunch of chasing and punching?  This movie avoids both of these all-too-common (especially for animation) pitfalls in a big way.  Throughout this film, you never get the sense that anybody forgot about any of their powers right when it would be most useful, or that a weaker character was somehow evenly matched with a stronger one because the plot required it.  In fact, on the one occasion where you might be tempted to think such a thing is happening, one of the characters specifically comments about the mismatch.  Moreover, as these super characters fight each other, the combat rarely devolves into the tired punch-fests we see so frequently in animated films.  Instead, the fights feature choreography of great sophistication.  For instance, there is a scene where Wonder Woman intercepts a strike from someone wielding a ball-and-chain-type weapon.  Instead of merely grabbing it as you might expect, she knocks the ball to the ground, quickly loops the chain around her leg, and uses the leverage to unbalance the attacker.  The combat effect is the same as if she had grabbed it, but this is much more satisfying to watch.  In terms of fight scenes, this movie does not strike a wrong note.

Stylistically, I also found the movie satisfying.  This movie retains more of the dramatic perspectives and mood-enhancing shadowing typically found only in the printed comics.  I am thinking in particular of a shot of Superman's face as he is descended upon by a pack of some kind of creature on Apokolips; it was as though a panel had been lifted straight from a graphic novel.

Now, this movie is not perfect.  The storyline is not particularly cerebral, and the characters are fairly one-dimensional.  You will not be wondering where the next twist in the plot will take you or debating the character's motivations, nor will you ever have any doubt what will ultimately happen with Supergirl's character from the moment she first appears.  On top of that, Supergirl's character is a bit bland bordering on unlikable.  Note that I have not read the comic on which this movie is based, so I have no idea how faithful it is to that; I am hoping that the comic does not contain the painfully corny ""introducing Supergirl"" scene near the end of this film.  Character and plot issues aside, the voice acting was good on all counts.  I am a particular fan of Conroy and Daly, so I enjoyed having them in this movie (and was disappointed that Daly will not be voicing Superman in the next film).  Summer Glau was good as well as Supergirl.

To sum up, this is an action movie as opposed to a drama, and viewed in that way it is very satisfying.  I own all of the recent Superman, Batman, and JLA movies, and this is the only one I am planning to watch for a second time any time soon.  Definitely worth owning!",1285804800,,3074,4.692164179104478
4115700,5,B003ES5JEC,I read the comics but it had been a while.  But watching this movie made it all feel fresh.  Batman is the man!  Superman has someone with whom he can cut loose with in the form of Darkseid.  Supergirl is a quick learner.  Wonder Woman is a tough cookie too.  A true warrior.  Funny moments thrown in complete this movie.,1285804800,,321,4.25
4115701,5,B003ES5JEC,"Let me start by saying I am a huge fan of DC's other animated movie releases and Superman/Batman: Apocalypses by far the best of them all.

Superman/Batman: Apocalypse. Not to mislead anyone, this story is more about the introduction of Supergirl more than it is about Batman, Superman, or Wonder Woman. They all appear in here, and all have great parts, but this IS Supergirl's movie.

Great film, as it follows the graphic novel on which its based almost flawlessly, right down to the look of little things like one of the doors in the Fortress of Solitude, Kara's ship, Batman's ""borrowed"" armor.
The voices are superb (yes, pun intended.) The animation is some of the best I have see from DC movies so far. And, lets not forget the action. Not to spoil it, but the last fight in the movie is the BEST EVER!!! More Heat Vision and Omega Beams than have ever been animated before.

On the delux 2 disc version, the DVD extras however are just okay. There is a cool Supergirl retrospective documentary which is pretty cool, and there are some trailers and first looks at other projects which are nice, plus there is a nice Green Arrow short film which is well written and well animated (but I am not a big Green Arrow fan.) All and all, if you are a die hard fan you might feel it's worth getting the delux 2 disc version of Superman/Batman: Apocalypse, but by all means you must at least get the single disc version.

Supergirl, Apocalypse, Darkseid, Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Doomsday, Big Barta, all in the same movie, are you kidding me?! AWESOME!!!!",1285718400,,1561,4.60431654676259
4115702,5,B003ES5JEC,"This movie was an unexpected delight and based off of Michael Turner's run on the comic!!! A must have! I was suprised that I didn't know about this before, as it had already been available for quite some time now.",1285718400,,214,4.375
4115703,5,B003ES5JEC,"The previous Superman/Batman film left me lukewarm, thankfully, Superman/Batman: Apocalypse is a fulfilling, almost perfect experience.

Obviously, this is a sequel to the first animated feature&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superman-Batman-Public-Enemies-Blu-ray/dp/B0027FG29Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superman/Batman: Public Enemies [Blu-ray</a>]. The story establishes this right at the beginning by talking about President Luthor and the Kryptonite Meteor from the first film. We are introduced to the new Supergirl and it quickly becomes her story. Eventually, plot takes the Dark Knight and Man of Steel to Apokalypse to deal with Darkseid.

But, don't believe the name or cover of this Blu-ray, this is Superman/Batman: Supergirl. Based off of the book of the same name, ""Superman/Batman Vol. 2: Supergirl"" by Jeph Loeb and Michael Turner. They do a splendid job of recreating Mr. Turner's sleek and sexy art, so it gives this film a style like no other. Still, I find it almost laughable how the producers try so hard to hide the fact that this is a film about a girl. But, don't be discouraged there's plenty of action on a Apokalypse and a fight with Darkseid like no other.

Plus, Kevin Conroy and Tim Daly reprise their iconic roles as Batman and Superman. Summer Glau is an excellent Supergirl, and Ed Asner returns as Granny Goodness (Ha!). The only complaint I have is Adre Braugher as Darkseid. He just sounds bored.

It's a good plot, and I certainly like it more than the first installment. My concern is Harbringer, an important character from the comics, but I don't know if the mainstream audience will like her in this movie. Seems like her part could have been written out, or written around.

That said, I'd give this film at 4.5 out of 5.

*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

What edges it out are the cool extras:

DC Showcase: Green Arrow, a 11-minute cartoon starring the Emerald Archer. I think it's great, except for GA's new voice. It's too bad Kin Shriner from JLU wasn't available.

Documentaries, ""The Fourth World: The New Gods,"" ""Profiles: Orion,"" and ""Profiles: Mr. Miracle"" are really great for a DC fan like me, or people that want to know the backstory to characters like Darkseid. Their enthusiasm in these documentaries makes me want to track down the New Gods comic books and read all the rich history penned by Jack Kirby.

Another documentary, ""Supergirl: The Last Daughter of Krypton."" is a look into Supergirl's history, also very well done. Except I'm mildly annoyed they glossed over the Linda Danvers - Supergirl. (You might know her as the Supergirl that wore a white shirt and a mini-skirt.)

And, a First Look at All-Star Superman, the next DC Animated Freature. Can't really say much about it, since they're still at the storyboard stage, and don't show any real animation.

Then four episodes from Superman the Animated Series: Little Girl Lost parts 1&2, which features Supergirl, and Apokalypse parts 1&2, where Darkseid brainwashes Superman.

Good movie. Good Extras. Definitely worth a rent, and I'm happy to own it. I'm still missing the commentary tracks, but I'll see everyone at All-Star Superman.",1285718400,11,3240,5.341846758349705

Anyone that read the story in the comics knows that Supergirl is the heart of the story, but doesn't dominate the whole story.  This animated feature got the balance perfect.  Supergirl remains the heart of the story but doesn't dominate the show (despite what some are falsely suggesting here).

This doesn't get boring at all.  All the fight scenes are great.  Worth the money to buy.  Great add to your collection.  Blu-ray version, colors a bright and vivid just like JL Crisis on Two Earths.  This one, in my book, goes to the top of the list for DC animation.  Green Arrow short is very good.  And we get a special prize with four Superman TAS Darkseid stories which were the best episodes of that series by far.  If Darkseid and his crew were in the episode it was awesome.

The animation pays excellent homage to the late Michael Turner while retaining its own uniqueness, albeit if it is slightly stilted at times. All of the characters integrate seamlessly into the story without feeling overly cluttered like some of the Justice League productions. Although the title includes Superman and Batman, the main focus is on Kara as she tries to find her identity admist the chaos. Everything about this film is very solid but the ending will blow you away. Its destructive, violent and a lot of fun. Its good to see Kara and Superman unleash their fury instead of holding back like they always do. I didn't agree with the some of the criticisms that it felt rushed or that there wasn't enough Batman. I definitely enjoyed it.  If your interested buy it, or at least rent it.

4115712,2,B003ES5JEC,"This story of Super Girl's arrival on earth and Darkseid's attempt to coopt her into his army is filled with cliches of teen angst and crappy dialog. Boring in its action sequences, corny when it tries to be funny, cheesy when it tries to be serious, and the plot never manages to provide a reason to care very much about the outcome: There is no great threat to the earth, only the life of whining Super Girl that is more annoying than endearing. The only redeeming quality it has is that it wasn't quite so bad to make me stop watching  before the end.

This may be a viable piece of entertainment for tween fans of the DC Universe, but anyone who appreciates some of the classics of the DC library such as Kingdom Come are likely to come away disappointed.",1285632000,6,759,4.375886524822695

4115715,4,B003ES5JEC,"I'll be honest right out of the gate. I haven't been too happy with the recent warner animated releases. I liked Superman: Doomsday as a first effort. I loved Justice League: The New Frontier, Frontier being my favorite thus far in these releases. Wonder Woman I managed to enjoy despite some issues because it was the first animated film devoted solely to her wonderful character and for me that overshadowed its issues. After that I felt a decline in overall quality. The animation was still good but didn't impress or seem as fluent and lively. The writing, while good for one viewing, didn't seem to merit repeat viewings let alone demand them unless you wanted to rewatch a particular fight. Now I mean no offense and have no intent to upset by saying any of this, I just feel that they started making these direct features solely for fan enjoyment and stopped trying to also make them excellent stand alone films. The last one I saw, Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths was in my opinion the worst offender so far.

All that in mind I didn't want to have high hopes for this release. I probably wouldn't even have bothered to watch it except I can't deny myself any DC effort that reunites Tim Daly and Kevin Conroy as Superman and Batman respectively. Then I discovered Summer Glau from Terminator: TSCC was starring as the voice of supergirl and I knew I'd have to watch it at least once. Having now viewed it and keeping in mind my disappointment with the last several features, I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It has faults but is a definite improvement and by far a huge step up from the past few entries, including Superman/Batman Public Enemies to which this is a direct sequel.

The story is taken from the Jeph Loeb, Michael Turner storyline Superman/Batman Vol. 2 Supergirl, which I had read long prior to viewing. Here it has been renamed Superman/Batman Apocalypse which might irritate fans but I can see why they did it from a marketing standpoint. While I didn't particularly love that volume of source material it was enjoyable and to be fair aimed at more die hard fans than myself. In this instance I'm happy to say they have taken the source material and not only followed it near faithfully but they have expertly elaborated upon it, lengthening fight scenes and adding dialogue in all the appropriate places. Unlike Public Enemies where they had to trim certain scenes and take out/shorten certain plot points this feature gives you the original story and all that much more. Another improvement here over Public Enemies is that the story doesn't just appeal to fans of the comics but has more real predominant themes that any viewer can relate to as far as family, trust, betrayal and finding one's place. While both Public Enemies and Apocalypse are clearly meant to showcase DC characters and fun scenarios I feel Apocalypse gives more purpose to its showcased characters than Public Enemies did. While I always wish they'd try to take character further in these features, (remember the old Batman:TAS days?) here they at least attempt to go further than the source material and I say they succeed.

Voice acting was great, though I'm biased as someone who loves Conroy and Daly in these roles. As a Justice League fan I was happy to see the return of Susan Eisenberg as Wonder Woman, she's always had a voice that I feel suited the character, regal and commanding yet caring and endearing. Summer Glau doesn't shine the way she could have but she does very well and makes Kara interchangeably vulnerable or menacing depending on what's required. All the while playing her as a believable young girl, if a slightly one dimensional one (though I would argue that's an issue with the writing that traces back to the original source material). Ed Asner's role as Granny Goodness doesn't require much range but he plays the part hilariously. Andre Braugher has an excellent voice for Darkseid but I felt the role could've been made more menacing. I'm not sure if the coldness should be attributed to Braugher's work or to the voice direction by Andrea Romano, either way it seems to be a creative choice made by someone rather than a lack of effort. My only real issue with the entire project, besides wishing they'd pushed character further in the writing, is that while I enjoyed the voice acting it did seem cold all around. I remember Conroy and Eisenberg bringing more heart to their characters in the Justice League Series, though I suppose most watch these for the epic brawls more than the attention to character.

As far as animation, I have to judge it in comparison to other films by this studio. So in that case I found this to be the most fluent animation yet. Just as good as the animation in New Frontier and better than the animation in Doomsday or Wonder Woman. Everything looks beautiful and is based upon Turner's artwork. Fight scenes are, for the first time in a while, interestingly choreographed and actually hold my attention. Another thing I was personally happy to see was that they followed Michael Turner's designs to please fans but in my opinion they classed it up a bit. Turner's designs, while beautiful, seemed too sexist on the pages. The men all huge muscular figures (as they would be in the superhero/hero business) but the women all fairly stick thin and dainty despite their supposed physical prowess (Wonder Woman is supposed to be an Amazon warrior for god's sake not a fashion model). Here the designs are clearly taken from Turner's work but the women are filled out a bit for animation and a particular scene in the book where Kara wore a hiked up thong has been changed, in my opinion for the better.

The score was well done. It mixes the Batman and Superman themes nicely and has an epic feel that seems familiar without feeling completely recycled from previous efforts. The sound mixing was nice too but I've never had issue with it on previous releases either.

On the actual DVD and Blu-ray releases there is plenty of supplemental material depending on which version you buy:

Two Disc Special Edition DVD will include,
-Feature film (est. 75 min)
-DC Showcase: Green Arrow (10 min)
-Sneak Peak at the Next DC Universe Animated Original Movie (10 min)
-Featurette: Supergirl: The Last Daughter of Krypton - A comprehensive look at The Maiden of Might from her introduction in the classic age of comics to her death in the ""Crisis on Infinite Earths"" crossover event to her appearance on Smallville and beyond.
-2 bonus episodes from animated television series handpicked by Bruce Timm ""Little Girl Lost Parts 1&2""

Two Disc Special Edition Blu-ray include all the above features as well as,
-All-New Featurette: The New Gods - This documentary covers Darkseid's story, particularly in reference to the adaptation of Superman/Batman: Apocalypse. A primer on the wealth of material and stories contained in the New Gods series, along with a deeper understanding of why these characters - and especially Darkseid - are so memorable and important to the DC pantheon.
-All-New Featurette Pods:
-Orion - The mightiest warrior on either New Genesis or Apokolips, Orion follows an almost Shakespearean arc culminating in the slaying of his father, Darkseid. This mini-featurette shines a light on this classically tragic character.
-Mister Miracle - This mini-featurette focuses on the greatest escape artist the universe has ever known and how he was traded in a peace effort to be raised by Darkseid, the enemy of all New Genesis.
-2 additional bonus TV series episodes handpicked by Bruce Timm ""Apokolips Now! Parts 1&2""
-Digital copy on disc of the feature film

There is also the single disc DVD, which to my knowledge only contains the feature film and trailers.

This feature definitely has 5 star production values and the DVD itself contains more than enough relevant and interesting content to merit 5 stars. The writing takes the story from the source and enhances it without intruding on it, but I do feel they still could have pushed character further and worked harder on dialogue. The other downside for me was that the characters came across somewhat cold and stale on account of poor voice direction. That said this was by far the best effort to be put out by DC/Warner Premiere in a while. It not only does service to fans of the sourcework and fans of DC in general but this time they made a film that I can say I would watch as a standalone. I give it three and a half to four stars overall because it's a beautiful and shiny effort but is void of a certain depth I'm still waiting to see in these features. I also want to leave DC/Warner room to improve on these because I believe they can and will in the near future.

Good job DC, keep them coming like this and keep improving them. Like another reviewer said, I'd love to see an attempt at Jeph Loeb's The Long Halloween, but maybe they best start with making a simpler storyline work well first (maybe Hush or Haunted Knight).

Thanks and I hope this was genuinely helpful to those on the fence about purchasing or viewing this release.",1285286400,18,9100,4.748893105629349

In response to a review, Batman plays a pivotal role in the comic book and it would not be nearly as epic if he did not, so please pick up the collected comic edition here on Amazon as well and you will see what I mean.",1285027200,,613,4.083333333333333
4115718,3,B003ES5JEC,"I've seen this movie, but have never read the comic from which it was adapted (I don't read comic books)...

This movie is not terrible as some have said, but it is by far Bruce Timm's weakest film (the Emmy-winning producer). I don't know what happened with the voice direction, but you have two of the greatest voice actors in history (Conroy & Daly) along with one of the best actors in general (Braugher), resulting in mediocre performances.

Okay, Conroy was still pretty good, but this was far from his strongest performance. And Daly (star of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wings/dp/B000ELIZZM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Wings""</a>&nbsp;& ""Superman"") and Braugher (just Emmy-nomed for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Men-of-a-Certain-Age/dp/B002ZCY81S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Men of a Certain Age""</a>) were cringe-worthy on some lines which is kind of shocking coming from those two stellar performers.

The story itself was just okay, with pretty flat characters. And to echo everyone's sentiments, Batman is in the title for marketing purposes only. Batman was somewhere between the fourth to sixth lead in this movie, far from the star.

If you're just someone who absolutely loves anything Bruce Timm & Kevin Conroy are involved in, you may be a bit disappointed, but I'd still recommend picking this up, because it has a good few moments of fun, and Daly/Conroy banter is always must-see.

If you're someone who picks up animated DC films here and there, I'd recommend any other one made by Bruce Timm.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Mask-of-the-Phantasm/dp/B000A9QKLE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Batman: Mask of the Phantasm""</a>&nbsp;(1993),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Beyond-Return-of-the-Joker-Uncut/dp/B00005Y71K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker"" (Uncut)</a>&nbsp;(2000), and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Under-the-Red-Hood/dp/B003ITZBVI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Batman: Under the Red Hood""</a>&nbsp;(2010) are particularly good--as-in ""The Dark Knight"" (2008) caliber.",1284854400,13,2271,7.554716981132075

4115721,5,B003ES5JEC,I just watched it twice. The animation is very well done. This is the most beautiful Wonder Woman or any of the DC women have ever looked. The animation really followed closely to the artist's work in the book. I really enjoy these DC movies. I hope they continue to make them. I just wish they would have followed through with the 80's Teen Titans movie. Getting tired of seeing Superman and Batman. DC has so many great stories but they must feel they will sell more movies with them in them. Defiantly worth getting. I will be purchasing this one for sure!,1284508800,5,559,4.436893203883495
4115722,5,B003ES5JEC,"Man,...the ability to get a product [in this case view it] before it is officially release staggers me.  I have pre-ordered this & paid for it with a gift card already because I knew it was going to be good becuase I read the comic books it's based off of. Now having seen it and the very different action sequences from comic book and what's in the film are very noticable but still good.  Damn, if Superman is the strongest in the DC Universe then Darkseid has to be the man on par if not stronger!  You have to see it for yourself to believe it!  Not a waste to get [PLEASE Buy it like I have!] and I can say that it is worth every penny spent. You guys have me LMBBAO...HARD!!!!  I just want to know if it's good or bad and I can say from my own observation it is really good.",1284508800,4,780,4.006451612903226
8395632,4,B003ES5JEC,"Another solid entry in the DC animated universe.  This one is a bit on the blander side.  It's less violent, and the characters are much more black and white.  I'm not a fan of the art style either, Superman in particular, is very old school generic.
Still, it's a fun little story, nothing new, but it does show Supergirl to be a little different than just a supporting character to Superman",1527206400,,392,4.492957746478873
8395633,4,B003ES5JEC,"This is an awesome movie.  I've said it before and I'll say it again-where DC fails on the big screen, they definitely make up for, or at least break even on the animated side.  This film introduces, or reintroduces, us to Supergirl.  Amidst the learning curve of dealing with her powers on Earth, following in her cousin's footsteps, and being untrusted by Batman, she gets kidnapped by Darkseid, who wishes to use her to his own deceptive ends.

The artwork and visuals are amazing, and I particularly loved Wonder Woman's fight scene against the Furies ( a scene I felt should have been, or should be in any future Wonder Woman films, just sayin).  My only gripe with this film and the subsequent lack of a fifth star, for anyone who is familiar with Superman: The Animated Series, and if not, why not??  In that series, the dark lord is voice by Michael Ironside, in only a few episodes, but the voice casting was perfectly ominous; a terrifying performance.  In this film, Darkseid's voice does not give me the fear that it should, and as such I was not intimated by a character that does not need to demand it.  That aside, an excellent film!!",1525046400,,1149,4.570731707317073

8395640,3,B003ES5JEC,"As is typical for these DC animated films, it's often worth getting the blu-ray because the included documentaries about the history of the various comics and characters is often more enjoyable and far more interesting the film itself--and they serve to give dimension and backstory to the film that would otherwise be lacking.  So thank you for including those and keep it up.  The supplemental ""Green Arrow"" short was also more entertaining than the feature film--as were the bonus ""Superman: The Animated Series"" episodes which provided an alternative take on essentially the same story as the feature film.  That's not to say that the feature film, ""Superman/Batman: Apocalypse"" wasn't any good, it just didn't captivate me.  I think what took me out of it most was this film's terrible treatment of Wonder Woman.  Besides the fact that Wonder Woman is a more important protagonist in this movie than Batman--and yet she it isn't even mentioned in the title, (besides the fact the film's MAIN protagonist is not Superman, Batman, or Wonder Woman; the MAIN protagonist of this story is *Supergirl*, and she isn't mentioned in the title either), what I disliked most about this film was Wonder Woman's unsympathetic portrayal.  She is gratuitously cruel and unlikable in this film.  True, she mellows a bit towards the latter half and seems a little more like the character we know--but, by that time, the damage is already done by her previous actions (which no one ever calls her on).

(Mild spoilers, I'll keep them to a minimum, but in order to make my point, I need to talk about a very specific scene that I found appalling...) Early in the film, Batman and Superman rescue Kara Zor-El (soon-to-become Supergirl) when her Kryptonian ship crash-lands on Earth and they take her in.  (Yes, this movie is basically Supergirl's origin story).  Batman is also kind of a jerk in this movie, completely unsympathetic towards a teenage girl who is scared to death and not fully comprehending the powers that have suddenly been thrust upon her--and he doesn't trust Superman to know more about how to care for a Kryptonian girl (his own cousin) than Batman would.  Why?  Because, he's Batman!  So, because this movie seems to assume that Superman is a moron, here comes Wonder Woman out nowhere and brutally ATTACKS Superman for no reason (without warning!)--and literally KIDNAPS Kara!  Whoa!--What the hell??!!  Before dragging Kara off (who is understandably frightened and confused), Diana proceeds to tell Clark what the hell in the meanest, cruelest voice and scowl she can muster--that basically he's too big of a moron and too male to care for and train a female superhero; so she is going to take Kara back to Themyscira by force--because feminism, I guess?  (And yet, the movie couldn't bother to put either Wonder Woman or Supergirl's name in the title.  Go figure.)  Batman then steps out of the shadows to agree with Diana and inform Clark that *he* is being ""unreasonable"" for not appreciating being physically ATTACKED and his frightened cousin KIDNAPPED by a stranger!  A stranger to Kara, not to Superman.  To Superman, Wonder Woman is supposed to be a trusted friend.  If I were Superman, I would never trust her again.

I haven't seen every animated incarnation of Wonder Woman, but this is at least the second time, recently, that a DC animated film has portrayed Wonder Woman in such a bitter and unflattering light--as if the producers seem to equate being ""a mean and nasty woman"" (in the words of a certain former movie star I used to actually like) with being a feminist icon.  I'm sorry, but that in itself is sexist.  Mean and nasty is not a positive trait for anyone, male or female.  Diana's behavior in this film is appalling.  It's not only cruel and condescending to Clark (whom she supposedly cares for), it's extremely cruel to Kara--who, in case the producers are unaware, is a young WOMAN!

What are easily the two most iconic screen versions of Wonder Woman?  Obviously Lynda Carter in the 1970's TV series and now Gal Gadot as Princess Diana in Patty Jenkins near-masterpiece, ""Wonder Woman,"" the 2017 live action movie which I think may be my favorite superhero film to date.  What do both versions of Wonder Woman have in common?  They both kick bad buy butt; no male opponent can defeat them, and the damsels in distress that they rescue tend to be men; they represent female empowerment to the nth degree--and yet what's the number 1 characteristic they both share?  Diana/Wonder Woman is a genuinely *nice* person!!  There is no one on planet Earth with more love, caring, and compassion than Wonder Woman!  ""Yes, much of Wonder Womans particular brand of feminism stems from compassion,"" noted Noel Kirkpatrick and Kerensa Cadenas in reviewing the 1970's TV series for the website ""This was TV""--and they are absolutely right.  Wonder Woman in the TV series continuously opined on women's issues, which could have verged on becoming preachy.  But it never felt preachy because Diana always said it with a smile and a sense of compassionate morality.  She made you *want* to pump a fist and say, ""You go, girl!""  Gal Gadot followed Lynda Carter's example.  Gadot's Wonder Woman is an intense warrior who can literally lift a tank, but it's her smile and dedicated compassion that endears her.  Even the 2009 DC animated film, ""Wonder Woman,"" starring the voices of Keri Russell and Nathan Fillion (a film which heavily influenced the 2017 live-action), presented a Wonder Woman whose personality was maybe a little more sarcastic than Lynda Carter or Gal Gadot's version, but she is still very endearing and compassionate.  She would never have brutally attacked her friend without warning to kidnap his teenage cousin.  Is this film, ""Apocalypse"" supposed to be set in the same continuity as the 2009 animated film?  If so, this Wonder Woman is completely out of character.  Indeed, she is completely out of character for Wonder Woman--period.

Maybe someone will come along and say that this was how Wonder Woman behaved in some specific comic issue # whatever-the-heck...to which my answer would be: Then the Wonder Woman of that specific comic issue # whatever-the-heck was acting completely out of character with the traditional Wonder Woman of the comics of decades and decades and decades, so that's no justification.  This Wonder Woman is more like the failed David E. Kelley pilot starring Adrianne Palicki, which made all our jaws drop as we watched Wonder Woman MURDER some poor, innocent security guard with a lead pipe.  The guy was just an employee of a legitimate pharmaceutical company; he was just doing his job, standing by a door in the dead of night (I don't even think he pulled a gun, he didn't even know she was there) and she throws a pipe through his skull!  His only crime was being a low level employee of a legitimate company run by a CEO not much more villainous than Diana--who is also an unlikable corporate CEO; Diana is constantly berating her employees in the nastiest way possible--because David E. Kelley thought that best represented feminism?  It's no wonder that pilot never aired.  Feminism is not well represented when your female ""hero"" acts as bad or worse than the villain.  In fact, in ""Apocalypse,"" Wonder Woman acts EXACTLY like the villain--Darkseid.  Wonder Woman forcibly kidnaps Kara in order to mold her in accordance to her vision.  Well, later, Darkseid does the EXACT SAME THING!!--kidnaps Kara from Themyscira in order to mold her in accordance to HIS vision!  Poor Kara!  And yet, we're supposed to believe that Wonder Woman was right to do the exact same thing??!!  Am I missing something??  To be fair, maybe the parallel was originally intended to be sort of the point.  But if it was, they didn't follow through on it.  Like I said, no one ever called Diana on her behavior.  Not once did Diana ever express any remorse over it.  I think Kara (a young WOMAN, I remind you) grumbled a bit about how it seemed like everyone was deciding everything for her--but then nobody cared and that was dropped.  By all appearances, the movie seemed to be implying that Diana was fully justified in brutally attacking Clark and kidnapping a member of his family simply because his name is Super-MAN.  But Darkseid doing the exact same thing as Wonder Woman--well, that was BAD, because...he's also a dude?  Truth be told, Darkseid may be evil incarnate.  But he's also the only character who treated Kara with any modicum of respect.  Good job, movie.

Look, I have no problem with Diana training Kara--that's actually a storyline from the comics.  Indeed, I can't imagine Clark trusting anyone else more than Diana to mentor his cousin.  But after this fiasco, there's no reason for him to trust her now.  It's perfectly understandable for Diana and Batman to be concerned about Kara.  She is young with godlike powers thrust upon her, which she has no idea how to deal with--there's inherent danger in that.  It's perfectly appropriate for Diana to approach her *friend* and say, ""Clark, I know you love her, but you know me and you trust me.  Let me take her and train her.""  Sure, he might even be a little resistant to it to it at first.  They might even argue about it (without punching each other).  But in the end, he would give his blessings--because he TRUSTS Diana.  They're FRIENDS and he knows Diana to be a tough, but compassionate woman who will care for and teach Kara.  There was no need for Diana to behave the way she did--other than for another gratuitous battle between the good guy superheros.  That's all that was about.  Batman v. Superman, Civil War, good guy versus good guy--that's the in thing right now in superhero movies.  The so-called good guys spend most of the movie battling each other for...reasons?...then only have a hand full of minutes in the final act to battle the actual villain who's barely had any screen time to developed him/her (so we're not even sure what the villain is pissed off about; he/she is just there to provide a big CGI battle in the end--who cares, right?)  As long as we show how much the ""heroes"" all hate each other!  Because, just because!  I'm sorry, the good guys constantly fighting each other (for no apparent reason) gets old.  That's the only reason that scene was in there.  They wanted a gratuitous fight between Wonder Woman and Superman regardless if it made any sense whatsoever--which it didn't.  And WHY?  When you have freakin' Darkseid!!! as the big bad with all his numerous minions, do you really need to waste precious screentime having the good guys acting like bad guys and fighting each other?  You have a whole army of bad guys right there!!!  Maybe let Superman, Wonder Woman, and Batman actually fight THEM!!  I don't know, I'm just throwing it out there!

Sorry for ranting--and mostly over one particular scene.  As far as the rest of the film, it's okay, I guess.  Wonder Woman (possibly my favorite childhood character) just pissed me off so much, it was hard to enjoy the rest of it--which actually has some nice highlights. The ""heroes"" finally do get around to being quasi-civil to each other just long enough to take on Darkseid's forces.  The film also had some nice callbacks--""Easter eggs"" if your will.  The main voice-actors of the ""Timmverse""/DCAU are featured: Kevin Conroy, Tim Daly, and Susan Eisenburg.  And the film's visual style is strongly influenced by the DCAU, even though it's clearly set in a separate continuity.  The planet Apocalypse is right off the pages of Jack Kirby--and even Krypto (a.k.a. Superdog) makes a surprise cameo--the Kryptonian dog I fondly remember from the 1960's Filmmation cartoon, ""The Adventures of Superboy.""  That made me smile.",1515196800,,11763,4.8711625566180174
