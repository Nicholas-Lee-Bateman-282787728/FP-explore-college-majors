8502371,5,B006OT0TX4,"This is a seriously brilliant piece of cinema.  I'm sure if you're here, you already know the plot regarding Bruce Lee invading The Godfather's turf in (basically) Purgatory, and The Godfather striking back with his bodyguards, James Bond and The Man With No Name.  Luckily, Bruce Lee has trained others, including Popeye, to fight at his side!

I have seen several reviews that say the transfer of the film on this disc ruins it.  That is nonsense.  It is exactly the video quality I want for a movie about Bruce Lee and Popeye doing battle with James Bond and The Man With No Name.

Seriously, this is a brilliant and singular piece of cinema.  I wish others would ignore logic and copyright and good taste and everything else and just reach for the further depths of their own genius the way these filmmakers have.  Truly inspiring.",1504915200,,835,4.671232876712328
8502372,1,B006OT0TX4,Horrible horrible transfer. Don't waste your money on this DVD. I actually stopped the film and consider it a wash. Great film. Terrible transfer,1471305600,,145,5.083333333333333
8502373,5,B006OT0TX4,This film deserves the highest rating possible for the fact that it exists and it is exactly what the synopsis on IMDB says it is.  If you're looking for anything other than what this is than you should look elsewhere for something that is not this.  If you're looking for Criterion quality with loads of extras and commentary than you should look at another DVD.  If you're looking for a film with this specific story and Saturday morning pan and scan Kung Fu Theatre picture quality than this is exactly what you want.  Get it now while it's available and cheap.  If you don't want this you are not somebody I will ever understand.,1425340800,,633,4.517543859649122

8502375,5,B006OT0TX4,"I wasn't sure about this film until I purchased the DVD and watched it very carefully. My, my! It was worth it! This movie was so hilarious and full of action that I could not believe what I was seeing! Bruce Lee in purgatory fighting his way back to earth against Dracula, James Bond, the Exorcist, the Godfather and a few others - with the help of Popeye (yes, Popeye the Sailor) and Caine (from the Kung Fu TV series)! The dubbing helped with the laughs. You have to see it for yourself to believe how funny this flick is! I am still laughing! I highly recommend this movie to anyone. It will surely get a person out of a bad mood very quickly! I guarantee it! The only problem is the DVD transfer. It is obviously from a VHS source (you can tell). However, the surrealism, action and comedy got my mind off of that minor fault. I don't want to spoil anything else (and there are plenty more things I can mention that are in this film) so I'll just say, ""Find this movie. Buy it. Watch it. Enjoy it!""",1376697600,3,1003,4.229166666666667
