6284602,5,B00IP01S6C,"The ""Dead Like Me"" TV series is both similar to the book ""On a Pale Horse"" and opposite to it, with LOTS of differences. BOTH GET FIVE STARS!! This may sound confusing, but the book inspired the TV series, but the TV series, instead of focusing on the Incarnation of Death, Thanatos, the TV series focuses on how his underlings handle

The TV series, ""Dead Like Me,"" easily deserves five stars, as does the book, ""On a Pale Horse."" If I were giving ten stars, I'd give ""Dead"" 9 stars and ""Horse"" 10 stars.

I highly recommend this TV series to you. It is excellent.

***** END OF REVIEW *****
_

Since I have read ""On a Pale Horse"" at least 10 times in the last 25 years, let me do a comparison of some of the specifics that are similar or opposite between Pale Horse and Dead like Me. I will use PH to represent the book, DM for the book.
_

WHO ARE THE MAIN PROTAGONISTS, BEFORE THEY BECAME IMMORTAL?

(PH): Zane is an average run-of-the-mill, down-on-his-luck, unsuccessful former photographer, who is so depressed that he is about to give up on life. Computers and advanced equipment have made it very hard for Zane to find work, so hard that his camera is in hock, and he's about to be kicked out of his apartment. We see quite a bit of Zane's pre-Death (note Caps) existence in numerous pages, and in some flashbacks later in the book.

(DM): George (Georgia) is 18, mostly disillusioned with life, a college dropout who does not have many, if any, friends, who practically ignores her younger 11-year-old sister. Her mom has to force her to go out and find a job, and wants to kick Georgia out of the house. Mostly we learn about her life in flashbacks, because she dies in the first minute of the movie. We don't see capitalization in the TV show, but it is probably not capitalized, as she is one of many people assisting Death.

(AGREE): Both mortals were experiencing lives in which they were dissatisfied with their existences. They were just getting by in their drab existences, and looking at evictions from their homes.
_

CAPITALIZATION OF DEATH

(PH): In all eight ""Incarnations of Immortality"" books, Death, when used to describe Zane, is capitalized because he is one of the major Incarnations, Thanatos, along with Time (Chronos), Fate (Clotho / Lachesis / Atropos), War (Mars), Mother Earth (Gaea), Evil (Satan), and Good (God). Years later, Night (Nox) finally gets her own book, which I'm looking forward to reading after I reread books 1-7.

(DM): In the TV series, death is not capitalized, because George and the other grim reapers are all subordinates of the actual Incarnation of Death, who we never see.
_

HOW DO THE CHARACTERS BECOME IMMORTAL?

(PH): Zane, totally disillusioned, decides to end his life. While he is pulling the trigger, Death in his black cloak walks in the door. He can't stop his finger from pulling the trigger, but the shock of seeing Death helps him move his arm, and he ends up murdering Death, who had been so careless not to close his impenetrable cloak. Any person who murders Death becomes the new Death.

(DM): Georgia is killed by a toilet seat that came from the old MIR space station, turning her into a spirit. She soon finds out that the grim reaper who had retrieved her soul had just met his quota, so she has to take his place because he has retired to his next life. It was just luck that she became a grim reaper than that the previous or the next soul to be retrieved.

(AGREE): Zane does not die, he is a human being who becomes Death, and will remain immortal until he chooses to leave the office or he is careless. Georgia (and all grim reapers) must die before they become immortal.
_

HOW DO THE CHARACTERS KNOWS WHICH SOULS TO RETRIEVE?

(PH): Chronos, the Incarnation of Time, feeds all the information into Zane's DeathWatch, which not only tells Zane where to go, but how much time he has until he must take the soul.

(DM): A never seen character delivers a list of every death to Rube every morning. Rube gives George and the other grim Reapers their information for that day's collections on post-it notes.

(AGREE): We could easily decide that Chronos gives the information to his subordinates, who deliver the lists to all the supervisors, like Rube, around the world.
_

WHAT IS THE CHARACTER'S TERRITORY?

(PH): Zane collects souls all over the world.

(DM): Georgia's group only collects souls in the Seattle area.

(AGREE): They could easily be in the same world, but Zane is always somewhere else.
_

WHICH SOULS DO THE CHARACTERS COLLECT?

(PH): Zane only collects the souls of those people who were so close to perfectly balanced that his subordinates do not know if the souls are destined for heaven or for hell. He has magical instruments that can help him decide where each soul must go, or if he can't figure it out, he can take the soul back to Purgatory where even more precise equipment is available.

(DM): Georgia and her associates only collect souls who were surprised at their deaths, my way of describing the list or circumstances, which include a lot of accidents.

(AGREE): The grim reapers in the TV show could easily be the subordinates that the book talks about, who take care of all the normal passings, leaving the tough cases for Zane to handle.
_

WHEN DO THE SOULS GET COLLECTED?

(PH): Zane collects the soul after the body has died, but the body cannot die until the soul is removed.

(DM): Georgia's group do their best to collect the soul before the actual death, but the body remains alive until the accident. If they do not get to the soul in time, the body is dead, but the soul is aware of everything that is happening to the body, including any autopsy.
_

HOW THE CHARACTERS GET AROUND

(PH): Zane has a Pale Horse, which can also turn into a beautiful car, boat, airplane or whatever Zane needs to get him there.

(DM): The characters must get around on their own, but eventually, some of them acquire cars which can make it easier. Most of the grim reapers need to get jobs so they can pay for meals, lodging, etc.
_

CAN THEY CHOOSE NOT TO TAKE A LIFE?

(PH): At first, Zane had no choice, if he didn't collect a soul, every soul that died after that refusal to collect would not be able to cross over, but would remain attached to their body, in pain or whatever. Eventually, he learned that he could make choices, and Fate and the others would have to make changes, like Fate reweaving part of her web, the tapestry of life. Chronos could even help Zane by taking him through time so he could undo something that happened so a boy could live.

(DM): The reapers are pretty much stuck. If they choose to change a character's fate by moving objects or causing the person not to be where the death would occur, there are almost always consequences to pay, such as worse outcomes than would have occurred otherwise.
_

ARE THE CHARACTERS VISIBLE TO MORTALS?

(PH): Only people near death can easily see Zane, or any people Zane chooses to let see him. If he is seen by others, the people usually see him as someone that they'd expect to see on the scene. Very religious people can see him as Death. When Zane takes off his robe, people see him as he was in life. When his hood covers his face, Zane's face looks (and feels) like a skull. When he wears his gloves, his hands look and feel like bones, but return to normal human look and feeling when he removes the gloves again.

(DM): The grim reapers are totally visible, but except on Halloween evening, they always appear to be someone different than who they were in their mortal existence.
_

CAN THE CHARACTERS BE KILLED?

(PH): As long as Zane is fully dressed, he is invulnerable to any attack, even from Satan or other immortals. The reason the prior death was killed was because he had grown careless, and had not covered his face with the hood.

(DM): The grim reapers heal very quickly and cannot be easily killed, and in fact, none of them are killed in seasons one or two of the tv series. The other reapers do manage to destroy a particularly obnoxious, even evil, grim reaper in the movie, but they REALLY had to work at it.
_

ARE THERE ANY CREATURES IN THE SHOW THAT ARE NOT IN THE BOOK?

(PH): The book focuses on free will. Yes, Fate knows when each creature will die, but there are no evil creatures going around making accidents happen. Every creature has choices that affect its future. There are no creatures that deliberately make accidents happen.

(DM): Gravelings are strange creatures that only some of the grim reapers, and only a rare human, can see. They go around making accidents occur, like loosening wires, moving a banana peel, etc.
_

IS THEIR UNIVERSE ONE OF MAGIC OR ONE OF SCIENCE?

(PH): Science and magic coexist in the book's universe. Jet airplanes fly passengers across the ocean, but flying carpets can be used to get from place to place on land. Some average humans have magical powers.

(DM): This appears to be a universe of science. The only characters with supernatural powers appear to be the grim reapers and the gravelings. No humans have magical powers.
_

RECOMMENDATIONS

I highly recommend both the books and the television series. Don't forget the movie which came afterward, but don't watch it until you've watched both seasons of the TV show

I also recommend that you read Piers Anthony's excellent Incarnations series. You can read books 1-5 in any order, but do not read book 6 until after you have read all of books 1-5; and do not read book 7 until after you have read 1-6.

6284606,5,B00IP01S6C,"Top quality videos at an outstanding price.  I wish that these 5 DVD disk cases came in a nice ""collection case"" but that's a minor deficit; the video and sound quality of these series episodes, and final movie, are all first class.",1504656000,,232,4.523809523809524
6284607,4,B00IP01S6C,"This package is a more affordable way to get the full series of ""Dead Like Me"" than ordering the series itself. This is because it is a ""bundle"" with two unrelated Burt Reynolds movies, ""White Lighting"" and ""The End."" Of those movies, ""The End"" is a laudable and interesting movie ahead of its time that was rejected by audiences both for not being ""Burt Reynolds"" and for the Dom DeLuise tonal intrusions.
One gets the full run of ""Dead Like Me,"" in all of its confused glory, and its ""resurrected"" follow up film, ""Life After Death."" This last does not deserve the poor critical reception it received at the time, as it isn't bad, but critics and fans had hoped for the early season 1 magic, the punk attitude, and fewer digressions into family drama. Instead, it got a new villain, a new mythos that's left unresolved, and a series of ""lessons"" that had already been presented in the regular run of the show.
The strength and weakness of ""Dead Like Me"" was the writing. It had wonderful writing, and it had mediocre writing, as the show runners and producers seemed to have no ""bible"" or rules for the scripts. One episode, Georgia is from Washington, and the next, she's from New England, and the next, she has connections to the south. She is a childhood camper, but she's not. One episode has the reapers solely devoted to accidental deaths, and then they follow serial killers. The cast dynamics, attitude, and overall attractiveness of the world are top notch and endlessly intriguing, but the whole world of the show drifts into a mushy ""there is no God, there is no meaning, and it's all settled"" nihilism that defeats the premise of the on-screen action itself.
Essentially, this is a pre-HBO era cable show. It is before cable learned the lessons of a strong arc, a strong universe, and that's too bad, because few shows were as cool as this one.",1500768000,10,1858,4.633333333333334

6284622,2,B00IP01S6C,I didn't like how it was packaged. Maybe just maybe I guess I'm picky. I already had season 1 it just so happens it was cheaper to get this box set then to get season 2 and the life after death movie. I like to display my collections but this kind of looked like somebody had burned the discs and try to make the covers look right. The disk look fine and they played great like I said it's the packaging that I didn't like. But I guess you get what you pay for for the price I guess it was good.,1478217600,,495,3.8627450980392157

6284631,3,B00IP01S6C,What do two Burt Reynolds movies have to do with this series?  Loved Dead Like Me and wish the series had survived longer.  Hate the new trend of Amazon to burn DVD-Rs rather than selling pressed DVDs.  Just don't understand why two Burt Reynolds movies that are unrelated to this TV series would be added to this package.  Seems like someone at Amazon is just making things up as he/she goes along.  Amazon -- please go back to selling real DVDs.  This series is available in that format.,1450483200,26,489,4.5

I was thinking about passing it along to my granddaughter, but may wait till she is a little older than her 13 years because of the language.  I know she has probably heard all the words before, but my daughter-in-law would not appreciate it.  Buy the series.  It is worth it.",1531440000,,548,4.221153846153846
8644357,1,B00IP01S6C,"Filthy language.  Really impacted any enjoyment I might have gotten through latter viewing.

8644358,4,B00IP01S6C,So I actually own the first and second season of DLM but my sister took it when she moved states so I wanted to get another set.  I can say that this isn't one huge box set. There are two DVDs for the first season and 3 DVDs for the second season with the extra movie all wrapped up together. One of the middle DVDs in the stack was damaged which is why I gave 4/5 stars. The season itself is amazing or I wouldn't bother buying it again. The dark humor is amazing. Wish they had made more seasons but it went to the wayside like Firefly did.,1525996800,,542,3.9724770642201834
8644359,5,B00IP01S6C,Love the premise and the sassy characters. Just the way the main character was killed is hilarious. Really enjoyed how the characters interacted with each other. Not your typical feel good series which is refreshing. The actors in the series were so believable and genuine. Will be a series I will re-watch.,1525737600,,307,4.923076923076923

8644362,5,B00IP01S6C,Love this series,1524441600,,16,4.666666666666667
8644363,5,B00IP01S6C,"I watched ""Dead Like Me"" back when it first ran on Showtime and really loved it.  The idea of a comedy-drama built around a young woman who dies in a supremely macabre-comic fashion who discovers she's fated to walk the earth as a grim reaper (more like a ""psychopomp"") was irresistible to me.  The cast was great (Ellen Muth and Mandy Patinkin in particular) and the story-lines dealt with something that is inevitable just like taxes....i.e. death.

The show wasn't perfect.  I felt ""Dead Like Me"" spent too much time showing what was going on with the young grim reaper's family (how they coped and moved on after her death) and not enough time in the strange, funny, and often insightful and deeply moving world of the grim reapers.  But watching the show once again recently, I really think it was a breath of fresh air in terms of an entertaining and thought provoking show, and it's a great, great pity that Showtime cancelled it after only two seasons ...that was a premature ""death"" for such a fine show.

As for the movie that they followed the series up with in 2009, I would rate it as only okay.  It suffers greatly from the absence of Mandy Patinkin and the actress who played the character of Daisy Adair (recast with an actress who really didn't resemble or talk like the original).  But even the movie has a few nice moments, particularly one rather poetic one at the very end of the film.

So if you are looking for a show that deals with a very serious topic sometimes irreverently but sometimes very seriously and which has an original and engaging premise give ""Dead Like Me"" a try.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.",1522800000,,1642,4.573378839590443
8644364,3,B00IP01S6C,Love the short series but 3 of the cases were broke in certain places ,1522800000,,70,4.0
