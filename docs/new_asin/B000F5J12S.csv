This is such an excellent DVD with inspiring songs for the youth, teenagers, and adults alike.  My church uses it weekly in the Kidz Church and I absolutely love the program that is set up with this DVD.  It is so great that I ordered the DVD and CD and I can't wait until it arrives.  Great for families, and church groups.  I hope there will be more to add to my collection

2552691,5,B000F5J12S,"My one year old loves this as much as my 11 year old brother. The upbeat songs and bright colors really catch her attention. In fact, she puts it on everyday by herself. She jumps and dances around the living room while she is singing. It has been a great transition from PraiseBaby into Hillsong's DVD.

I highly recommend it for church and home use.",1395360000,,351,4.4
2552692,4,B000F5J12S,"This DVD was definitely worth the money! It has a mixture of upbeat, dancing songs and also slow worship songs. The lyrics are meaningful and definitely relate to what kids like.
The only downfall is the live worship sessions do not have the lyrics on the screen.",1395014400,,263,4.617021276595745

2552697,4,B000F5J12S,"This is an awesome video!  I love it!  I purchased it for a church, then purchased another for myself.  I have used it in Children's Church and as a music teacher in a Christian school.  The sing-a-long word cartoons are ""cheesy"" but fun.

The only bad, is the words are not on the screen with the live performance so you can't learn the words and the dance moves at the same time.",1373414400,2,381,4.236111111111111
