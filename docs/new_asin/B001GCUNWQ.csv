3600941,5,B001GCUNWQ,"I don't understand, why adults have so many complaints in their reviews of this movie. This movie is meant for children, so let them speak out! I have 8, 6 and 4 year old boys and they really truly loved this film. If an adult wanted to yawn during watching it, it was just his problem. Kids enjoyed it and that's all what matters, or not? Little boys love playing with the dinosaurs, they love to watch them in movies (from Land Before Times to Jurassic Park), so when this movie was supposed to come out during summer, we were among first its viewers. Oh, we laughed, it was amazing to see my kids enjoying movie so much. The whole story is cute and very original. Scrat again delivers and his ""girlfriend"" is remarkable! I can't wait for DVD to come out, so we can be again among its first buyers.",1251504000,3,800,4.304635761589404
3600942,5,B001GCUNWQ,"I have to disagree with reviewers who try to ""see"" too many things in a movie made mainly for (young) kids. This movie made my child and me laugh many,many times. In fact I think it is even funnier than Ice Age 1+2. It is just ""clean"" family fun. In this age of over-hyped animation from Walt Disney and Pixar, how refreshing to watch something without too many pretensions and not too much relation to today's world. Let the kids be kids,please.",1250640000,48,446,4.451219512195122
3600943,3,B001GCUNWQ,"""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" is the third installment of the ""Ice Age"" animation franchise, which, I am afraid, should have been stopped when the first sequel was made three years ago. Technically speaking, the newest film is just superb. I saw it in traditional 2-D format, but I admit the visuals have become more beautiful and the characters' movements more natural than before. But ...where is the story?

Sid (voiced by John Leguizamo) is a sloth who wants a family. So Sid ""adopts"" three dinosaur eggs he accidentally found in the icy underground cave. The mother dinosaur is not happy about that, of course, so she takes away three baby dinosaurs AND Sid too back to the cave and further. But where did they go anyway?

Now Sid's friends - two mammoths in love Manny (Ray Romano) and Elle (Queen Latifah), saber-tooth tiger Diego (Denis Leary), two possums Crash (Seann William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck) - they team up and embark on a new adventure into the subterranean world, a colorful computer graphics version of Conan Doyle's ""The Lost World.""

I hate to say this, but it seems none of the four credited writers came up with a good story for ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs."" The film's storyline is not just contrived; it is often impossible. Why should pregnant Elle insist on joining the searching party, for instance? The film's story only proceeds by constantly putting the characters in danger of falling, being eaten or crushed by animals or some objects.

That means there is no one you would like to relate to emotionally. The only character I found interesting is a confirmed loner, Captain Ahab-like weasel Buck (Simon Pegg), whose sole purpose of life is something Manny and Elle would not understand. He alone gives some depth to the film's weak narrative.

I am not saying everything about ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" is dull and uninteresting. The slapstick jokes are funny (including those of Scrat forever wrestling an acorn ... I'm beginning to feel sorry for him). These set-pieces are entertaining enough. Only that those sight gags could have been done better somewhere else, with some other characters.",1250380800,,2149,4.860655737704918
3600944,3,B001GCUNWQ,"Manny, Sid, & Diego return in this third installment that, I felt, goes to the well one to many times. Ice Age 3 tromps & stomps over the same familiar ground that the first two covered.

 When Manny is on the verge of settling down & starting a family, the friendship between the three seems threatened. Diego gets the hint & is ready to take off on his own again, when he realizes he may be to old to go it alone. For Sid, he too, wants a family & as fate would have it, he comes across what looks to be three gigantic, abandoned eggs that when hatched become baby T Rex's. Of course, mama T Rex comes a calling & its not long before ole Sid is in big trouble & its up to his buddies to bale him out.

 The first Ice Age was something new, fresh, funny & had the advantage of being one of the more successfull CG animated films that didn't come from Disney or Pixar. Ice Age 3 has none of these advantages. There is nothing really new, except a character thats voiced by Simon Pegg who has all the best funny bits (and they are few and far between). The animation is top notch, but, sadly, is now the norm for this type of family film. Ice Age 3 is a decent film for family time, but, I strongly recommend waiting for the DVD release in December.",1250208000,,1248,4.081632653061225
3600945,5,B001GCUNWQ,Took my nephew to see it and he loved it. I thought it was hilarious as well. Why can't some of you people just enjoy the movie for its entertainment? Is there a need to pick everything apart? Wahhh waahhh just another sequel to make more money. Ok? Who cares. I thought the dinosaurs were extinct in the first one. Again who cares!! Enjoy the freakin movie!,1249776000,56,358,4.358208955223881

3600947,5,B001GCUNWQ,"""Ice Age 3"" when I saw it kept the kids in the audience enthralled and screaming with delight every time characters were speeding downhill or falling into chasms. Adults will find the sound track imaginative and hilarious at times with variations on ""You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine"" (one a fun tango version) including the dynamic vocal rendition by Lou Rawls himself. The ""Adagio from Spartacus"" by Khachaturian and Chad Fischer's ""Alone Again (Naturally)"" will also seem clever by their juxtaposition at the oddest moments.
 Two prehistoric Ice Age squirrels, Scrat and Sratt, turn up in frequent episodes independent of the main plot fighting over a giant acorn. They'll remind old timers of the short cartoons of yesteryear like Roadrunner and Woody the Woodpecker. Free falls from extreme heights, splats, flattenings, catapults into space, chases, and flirtations make the whole thing wacky fun.
 Familiar characters from previous Ice Age outings show up in this ""Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" sequel including the two mammoths Manny (voice of Ray Romano) and expectant mother Ellie (voice of Queen Latifah), Sid, the sloth (voice of John Leguizamo), Diego, the saber-tooth tiger, and assorted smaller animals. A new character, Buck, a pirate weasel with a leaf as an eye-patch, shows up, and he's on a quest to kill the giant raptor dinosaur who has blinded him in one eye. (Captain Ahab, anyone?).
 The main character is Sid the Sloth who is lonely and ""adopts"" three dinosaur eggs that hatch and become his babies. From that point on there are all kinds of scary adventures with teetering rock platforms, red hot lava, falling off cliffs--these hair-raisers come up as the animal family tries to rescue Sid from the clutches of the T-Rex.
 The movie is full of funny situations, gags, and some adult humor that will go over the heads of little kids. Breakneck speed is an important element in the action sequences, and there are plenty of death-defying falls and enemies to contend with. The computer animation is well done. The walk and gait of the mammoths is particularly effective. This is a film that youngsters will enjoy, and it won't be a chore for adults to see with them or on their own.",1247356800,3,2209,4.962162162162162
3600948,3,B001GCUNWQ,"Why are there dinosaurs when they all died off in the first movie?  According to this film, the dinos are living underground beneath a crust of ice.  Other than that, the film was cute Y-7 (7 year old and up) type cartoon fare.

The story is that the gang's going to be breaking up now that Manny and Ellie (v. by Ray Romano and Queen Latifah), the woolly mammoths, are going to be having their baby. Diego (v. by Denis Leary) is ready to leave, but Sid the Sloth (v. by John Leguizamo) can't figure out why they don't all stay a herd.

When Sid adopts three dino babies of his own, not knowing what they are, of course) the whole crew goes underground and into the land of the dino to rescue him.  We get a new character, Buck the Weasel (v. by Simon Pegg) who stole the show with Scrat the Squirrel.  The story's predictable with a lot of warm-hearted fun despite the cold place they are all living in.

All in all, the film was cute.  There is enough laughs to carry it through and I definitely see a whole herd of toys and games emerging from this, which is probably why the movie industry is making kid films now anyway.  Worth a slow afternoon at matinee prices.

3600949,5,B001GCUNWQ,"This movie is still cute and fun even with the third installment. My husband and I saw it in 3D at the theater just for fun and also to screen it before taking our grandkids. We think it is the kind of movie you can enjoy with your children at the theater. We will buy the DVD because we know our grandkids will want to watch it over and over again like the previous two movies. The 3D is interesting but not necessarily worth the extra cost. Just have fun and enjoy it like a child does. Yes, Scrat and his acorn stole the show again.",1246579200,20,535,4.056603773584905
3600950,3,B001GCUNWQ,"This is starting to get silly. There shouldn't be dinosaurs in a story that takes place during the last ice age. It's a well known fact that they were long since extinct at that point. Yes, I'm well aware that this is a fantasy, and yes, I'm aware that it's supposed to be silly and fun and unburdened with historical accuracy. But come on, even fantasies have their limits. ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs,"" the third chapter in the series, is goofy and innocuous, completely removed from the more clever ideas that made the first two films enjoyable. Despite the fact that the release is in ""eye-popping"" 3-D, it's been reduced to the level of your average Saturday morning cartoon, lacking any real depth and full of thrill-ride misadventures that don't really go anywhere. I grant you that it's a decent enough film for younger children, but I fear that the adults in the audience won't get much out of it.

The film, which reunites all the main characters from the previous films, is founded on the premise that a handful of dinosaurs survived extinction and made their home beneath the snow-covered earth. How this happened is something the film never bothers to explain, but I guess it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that Sid the Sloth (voiced by John Leguizamo), Manny the Wooly Mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano), his pregnant wife, Ellie (voiced by Queen Latifah), her possum brothers Crash and Eddie (Seann William Scott and Josh Peck), and Diego the Saber-Tooth Tiger (voiced by Denis Leary) have stumbled onto this hidden world and go on yet another adventure. New to the series is Buck (voiced by Simon Pegg), a weasel left stranded in the dinosaur cave. He has one eye and an Australian accent. If you ever wondered what Steve Irwin would have been like with a mental disorder, now's your chance to find out.

The plot: Sid, longing for a family of his own, stumbles upon three eggs after falling through a patch of thin ice. He happily claims them as his own--he even draws crude smiley faces on the shells to give them some personality. Only when they hatch does he discover that his ""children"" are actually T-Rexes. It isn't long before their real mother ascends and rounds up her children, taking Sid along with her. It's now up to his friends to enter the dinosaur cave and rescue him. Lo and behold, they're aided by Buck, a thoroughly insane adventurer with a leaf for an eye patch and a dinosaur tooth for a hunting knife. He's on a quest for his own version of Moby Dick: A great white dinosaur he has named Rudy.

The main story is occasionally interrupted by comedic vignettes with Scrat the Squirrel, who, of course, is still on a mission to find an acorn. His frenetic escapades have been enhanced for this new movie with the addition of Scratte, a female flying squirrel who's also in search of an acorn. They're simultaneously in love and in competition with each other, which is kind of funny but also kind of lame. Scrat's acorn episodes may have been fun at first, but now they're just getting old. Think back to the era of the Warner Bros. cartoons: How many Wile E. Coyote shorts does it take to make it clear that (a) he'll always get hurt by defective Acme products and (b) he'll never catch the Road Runner? Not too many, I should think. At a certain point, you're just beating a dead horse.

The humor is periodically tamed, albeit weakly, by more serious plot points. Diego, for example, fears he's losing his edge, which is why he wants to leave as soon as Manny's baby is born. Sid is still being hassled for his more annoying tendencies, none of which are helped by the fact that he likes kids so much. Manny is overprotective of Ellie and the baby, so much so that he begins neglecting his friends. All of this is addressed, but they're hardly developed. This is probably why I didn't feel much of anything for the characters, certainly not like I did in the first two films. It now seems as if the filmmakers were more interested in perfecting the look, and indeed, the computer imagery and bold color scheme provide great visual appeal (the 3-D doesn't do much for them, but then again, 3-D itself hasn't been all that impressive lately).

I'm sure some of you think I'm being too hard on this film, but I'm sorry, I can only suspend disbelief so high before the ropes threaten to buckle. I'll say this much: If you absolutely must see this film, or if your child is pressing the issue, I recommend you save the extra money and see it in traditional 2-D. Otherwise, you should be in no hurry to get the theater. ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" is proof that there can be too much of a good thing; Manny, Sid, Ellie, Diego, and the rest are fun characters, but after two entertaining adventures, they've officially overstayed their welcome. It doesn't help that they're trapped in a story undeserving of them; when it comes to this kind of cartoon, there's no way to genuinely be interested in the idea that dinosaurs live underground. Believe me, I tried.",1245542400,4,5010,4.593296089385475

I've seen physical copies of this cover with Diego on Sam's Club, but I wanted to purchase it but the Sam's Club in my area did not have any... So is there any way I can buy the physical copy of this movie?

To consider this a review, the movie itself is very fun to watch for all ages. I'm an Ice age fan and this is on of my favorite sequels to watch in the Ice Age franchise. I recommend to buy this. :)",1437523200,,649,4.142857142857143

3602734,3,B001GCUNWQ,"I think I watched this a long time ago and didn't like it. My toddler watched this at grandmas house and loved it so I bought it. For the adult humor its great but one part couldn't really fly over my friends 6 year old.
Its when Sid is looking for milk for the baby dinosaurs and finds a male animal and grabs his penis. The next scene hes running away hollering ""I thought you were a female!""
Well the 6yo asked us why he thought he was a girl and we just told her he couldn't find any boobies for milk.
Her somehow being smart noticed he hadnt reached for the chest but near the animals butt. We played it off as it just being a prehistoric thing.
Anyway, my 1yo likes it and it does have its funny moments.",1417651200,,710,4.042553191489362

3602849,2,B001GCUNWQ,"Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs

Ray Romano supplies the voice to a shaggy animated mastodon in this third in the Ice Age series.  The mastodon herd includes Queen Latifah as the soon to be mama mastodon-the mate to Romanos character.  In this only in an animated movie, blended family, herd we also find a saber-toothed cat (who never dines), an inept but loveable sloth and two prehistoric opossums who seem to be suffering from arrested development.  The opossums act like middle school siblings.
 Fans of the previous two outings will be pleased that the buck-fanged squirrel and his acorn from the first films is back, reprising his comic non-speaking role.  He has all the best laughs.  Watch particularly for the squirrel and his temporary lady love in a passionate tango.
 The herd finds itself in a very dangerous, under ground Journey to the Center of the Earth environment filled with surviving dinosaurs.  They meet and are befriended by Buck, a weasel of some sort who is a mammalian survivalist with an Australian accent.  Danger, excitement and humor ensue, all aimed at the grade school set.
 This is a fairly typical summer animated feature for children.  There is nothing new here, it would be a miracle in the third outing for a kid flick if there was something new.  The situations are not clever, many of the gags are derivative of much better movies and there is not sense that we are on the cutting edge of animated technology.  On the other hand, there is not much to whine about either.  It is a good enough summer kiddy film.  It is no where near as good as the recent Up.
  The PG (some scary situations may put off the very smallest children) film runs a short 1hr 27 minutes.  Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs rates a sub par 2 and a half saw blades.",1414108800,,1776,4.580952380952381

3603438,5,B001GCUNWQ,"I recently bought a 3D TV, and have tested it - the 3D is awesome. I therefore decided to watch a 3D streamed movie. On Amazon Prime, I looked specifically for 3D Movies, and this one showed up. There were even reviews about the great quality of the 3D in this movie. I rented this movie, but it seemed to be streamed in 2D only. The movie is excellent, which is why I gave it 5 stars. The quality of the 2D streaming was decent, and I would give Amazon Prime 4 stars, but I felt ripped off by Amazon Prime, because the movie was not in 3D. I think what causes the confusion is that Amazon may have combined the reviews of the 3D Blu-Ray of this movie, and of the streamed version of the movie. I feel Amazon Prime should not show this movie as one of the selections when you search for 3D movies - it is misleading.",1373328000,,816,4.074534161490683

3603540,3,B001GCUNWQ,"Fun, entertaining kids movie.  The only reason it didn't get four stars was because I thought it was irresponsible writing to have a pregnant female deliberatley put herself into a potentially dangerous situation, especially that close to delivery.  The dinosuar had better parenting skills than the mammal in this case. So parents, be prepared to explain to your kids why her decision was a really, really, stupid one.

Even my 5 year old thought that a tropical world of dinosaurs living under the ice was a stupid idea. Lets call it what it is - a way for the franchise to incorporate dinosaurs because kids love dinosaurs and parents will pay to let them see it. Ugh.,1368230400,2,355,3.810810810810811

Last month, hubby and I resolved to ONLY purchase movies with a digital copy. We don't go out except to buy groceries and pickup library books (no babysitters post Autism diagnosis), so for us, this is an investment in family entertainment. Very happy with this purchase.",1365552000,,440,4.653846153846154
3603661,4,B001GCUNWQ,I ordered these movies because my Granddaughter likes them and it gives her something to do when she is at my house.,1365379200,,116,4.318181818181818

3603664,5,B001GCUNWQ,"You can't go wrong with any of the ice age movies. We have almost the whole collection, and they have been watched many times.",1365206400,,126,4.291666666666667
3603665,5,B001GCUNWQ,I really and truly enjoyed watching this movie. Especially watching Scrat. He is one crazy critter because he just has to have his nut. I have never seen an animal who wanted something so dog gone bad.,1364860800,,201,4.45945945945946
3603706,5,B001GCUNWQ,"This is my second Ice Age DVD.  And it is just as good as the others I have purchased.  All of us in the family love it, no matter what the age of the watcher - four years old or eighty-nine.  A very fun movie.",1364688000,,210,3.6222222222222222
3603707,5,B001GCUNWQ,I love all of the ice age movies and this was great!!  The new characters were great and it was a wonderful adventure they all went on.  I liked the scenery and it was very funny.  They all showed courage and great friendship through the movie and I was really rooting for the good guys.  Even the big alligator monster was scary but a great character.  I would recommend this movie to everyone.,1364688000,,395,4.3561643835616435
3603708,2,B001GCUNWQ,My kids (6 & 4) watched this movie. They said that it was too scary and they didn't want to watch it again.,1364515200,2,107,3.6956521739130435
3603709,5,B001GCUNWQ,"No problem at all.

Would recommend to anyone that asked.  Product was on time as represented and and good value",1364256000,,112,4.55
3603710,5,B001GCUNWQ,There was a lot if action! Typical Ice age Highlarity. Great movie for the whole family! Laugh out loud movie.,1364083200,,110,4.55

3603712,5,B001GCUNWQ,"We love this movie. I have a three yr old and the movie keeps his attention and isn't scary. As a family we can enjoy this movie, great for kids and adults.",1363824000,,156,3.90625
3603713,2,B001GCUNWQ,This movie is targeted for younger kids why do they have to put unnessary crap to make it rated pg 13. I don't think 13 year olds are interested. The age group that would want to watch this movie is under 10. What happened to the wholesome rated G movies.,1363824000,,255,4.12
3603714,5,B001GCUNWQ,"Another hit for the woolly mammoths, this is a great movie for the entire family. Five stars for the fun packed movie with a message for the whole family.",1363392000,,154,4.344827586206897
3603715,4,B001GCUNWQ,"Always good to see what Manny and the gang is up to.  Our family is a big fan of the Ice Age series and while this isn't one of the best ones it's definitely worth the add to the collection if you like the others.  More importantly, it keeps my sons attention and it comes with the Digital Copy which is nice because I can put it on the iPad and let him watch it there.",1363305600,,369,3.8421052631578947
3603716,5,B001GCUNWQ,Thoroughly enjoyed the move and plan to buy the series down the road. Well done and kept my interest. Moves right along.,1363219200,,120,4.5
3603717,5,B001GCUNWQ,"My son loves this movie! He has asked to watch it every day, he's a big fan of dinosaurs. one",1363219200,,93,3.7
3603718,4,B001GCUNWQ,"This video was good to watch and enjoyable.  Not what I expected for a sequel though.  I didn't see as much NEW adventures, nor more intense characteristics of the animals.  Enjoyed, but would have like more of a change in adventure and ending.  Nice movie for kids though.",1363046400,,273,4.625
3603719,5,B001GCUNWQ,When we get bored of our standard cable programs it is nice to be able to browse Amazon's collection and the rental goes right on our Amazon charge. We had been wanting to see this movie so this made it great.,1363046400,,209,4.121951219512195
3603720,5,B001GCUNWQ,This comes along with the first two and is just as funny with all the same great characters. Good family fun!,1363046400,,109,4.238095238095238
3603721,4,B001GCUNWQ,"So...purchasing this rather than renting was a fantastic idea! The purchase price was the same as about 2 or 3 rentals, and by now my son has watched it easily a dozen times in a couple weeks -- so obviously he loves it. For the adults, it's a good movie, but not great. Appealing characters, some funny moments, and no matter how implausible, the premise of dinosaurs mixing with mammoths is kind of fun. But it's a little thin on logic and the dialogue is sometimes pretty cliched. So if your family only has enough money to buy one movie this year...go buy Wreck It Ralph or Night at the Museum 2: Battle for the Smithsonian, both of which provide far more entertainment for both the kids and grown ups. But as a movie for kids, Ice Age DoD is great.",1362873600,,753,4.347517730496454
3603722,5,B001GCUNWQ,Got it when expectedNever have any problems with your service always receive my products on time and customer service is always very good,1362873600,,137,5.0
3603723,5,B001GCUNWQ,I give it a 5-star because it's a great movie and I wanted it in 3D. The package came with no issues and the 3D quality delivered. I'm finding out there's more to 3D than just the shots that come out of the screen as much as depth. Overall this is a great fun fare for the family to watch together and would recommend it to anyone who has a 3D television.,1362700800,,355,3.9444444444444446
3603724,1,B001GCUNWQ,That's not what 3-D is about. They give you the old green and red paper glasses with it. It's the worse thing I have ever seen. Don't waste your money. I actually wound up throwing it out.,1362614400,,188,4.108108108108108
3603725,5,B001GCUNWQ,My entire family loved this movie.  We enjoyed some good old fashioned movie night fun.  We got it for a great price and love it!!,1362528000,,130,4.16
3603746,5,B001GCUNWQ,"This movie is fun.  Period.  The voice characterizations remain as before and the movie ventures into 3D as an extra plus.  The whole franchise seems ideal for 3D treatment and don't be surprised if the rest of the series eventually makes it into that format.

Our intrepid band of misfits continue their bizarre and outrageously funny journey across an imagined ice age terrain while handling the sorts of human foibles we all face.",1362528000,,433,4.890410958904109
3603747,4,B001GCUNWQ,Like this particular movie series and wanted to add this one to my collection.  Movie was a good price to pay.,1362355200,,110,4.238095238095238

3603751,4,B001GCUNWQ,"Our 3 year old loves this movie.  We watch it a lot... Fortunately, it is enjoyable for adults also.  My only warning would be about a little crude humor for those of you who are really strict on this (a few passing gas remarks and such).",1361664000,,238,4.1521739130434785
3603752,5,B001GCUNWQ,Kept my kids very entertained!  They have watched it several times.  They enjoy all of the Ice Age movies.  Will watch again.,1361577600,,125,4.590909090909091
3603753,4,B001GCUNWQ,I bought all the movies to watch with my grandkids but found out that maybe they aren't suitable for them yet because some of the violence might upset them.  Other than that I really enjoyed the movie and the characters.,1361491200,,220,4.5
3603754,5,B001GCUNWQ,It was as good as the original and also is good for all ages and worth watching over again. Great,1361145600,,97,3.9

3603782,2,B001GCUNWQ,"I did not like the 3D version of this DVD at all.  It is not true 3D.  My guess is that if you bought the BluRay version of this movie, that it would be much better, but the 3D on the DVD is not good at all.  I think I'm going to return it.
As far as the movie itself, it was fine.",1359936000,,281,3.4285714285714284

3603784,4,B001GCUNWQ,"This movie was fun, but the first Ice Age movie can't be beat.  I wanted to see them all and have now done so.  If you've not seen any of them, definitely see them in order is my recommendation.  A bit of immature humour in this one which could have been left out.",1359763200,,264,3.943396226415094
3603785,5,B001GCUNWQ,I love this. And so does my 6 month old daughter now. She has been watching this from the time she was 1 month old. :D,1359676800,,118,3.576923076923077
3603806,3,B001GCUNWQ,"Bought this Blu-ray package because it had the digital copy. I was hoping to use this digital copy so that my son could watch it on his tablet, but the code expired years ago. Really bummed about that because that was the reason why I bought it. Otherwise, the blu-ray itself and dvd worked fine on our console and computer.",1359590400,,324,4.416666666666667

3603826,5,B001GCUNWQ,"Probably not. In fact, they probably won't like the fact that you are rapidly adding CO2 with all the laughing. This is one of my children's favorite movies. In fact, this is to replace the original since I think she wore it out. We just watch the movie with the sound off since she knows all the lines. Seriously though, they've done a very good job with this series (with the exception of the last one).",1358121600,,405,4.342105263157895

 3D was ok, really expected more pop outs. Depth was really nice. No ghosting at all on this so that is always a plus.

3604024,5,B001GCUNWQ,"Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs, is one the very few series which avoids ruining the previous movies with excessively lame and predictable events. For kids, Ice Age innocently entertains via vocal and visual effects, playing upon the various characters hilarious characteristics. But Ice Age isn't just for kids. Any discerning adult will be thoroughly bemused at the frequent innuendo and satirical references and plays upon other films, events, and culture.
I highly recommend this movie.",1348185600,,488,5.434210526315789

3604032,5,B001GCUNWQ,I have been a fan of Ice Age movies from the start.  I heard lackluster reviews of this movie so my expectation were low.  I watched it with my daughter on a day she was home sick.  We loved the movie!  The true meaning of family and friendship reigns again with these prehistoric characters.  Who knew we'd get so attached to the terrifying T-Rex mother.  We watched the movie 3 times that week.  Absolutely fun and adorable.,1346889600,,426,4.454545454545454
3604033,5,B001GCUNWQ,Well done and my three girls under the age of 8 love it.  Some of the humor is geared to adults which goes over the heads but I enjoyed the comedy portion and a nice storyline.,1346889600,,176,3.888888888888889

The package includes the Blue-Ray 3D, Blue-Ray regular, and standard DVD. So, if you want to lay down on the couch and watch it again (but not in 3D because the glasses don't work side-ways), no problem!

Scrat is sooooo cute!!!! I wish there was more of him!

The only thing is that the case for the DVD is hard to close because it is slightly bent out of place (that could be due to the shipment). Other than that everything is in great shape!

3604081,1,B001GCUNWQ,"The static scenes show good depth and 3D effect, but when anything on the screen moves it takes on a silvery sheen and becomes almost impossible to focus on.  This was fine for my 5 year old, but a terrible experience for me.  None of our other 3D Blu-rays exhibit this defect, and no amount of fiddling with settings on the HDTV or on the Blu-ray player was able to improve the experience.",1340755200,2,390,4.328767123287672

3604094,3,B001GCUNWQ,Good game but the mini games are simple. The story level is fun and accurate to the movie. The mini games are really only 8 with 4 different ways to play them. My son and I beat the game in 3 days.,1337040000,,197,3.7142857142857144

3604102,5,B001GCUNWQ,"Dawn of the Dinosaurs 3D is a pretty good 3D movie. Have ordered about 1/2 of the ones available and waiting for more to come out this year on blu ray. This 3D is one that requires glasses and a 3D blu ray player and a 3D HDTV. These are not the leap off the screen 3D movies but instead look like a hologram movie instead, adding the depth. Pretty sure the kids will enjoy this one, even if they're over 21.",1328745600,2,408,3.9878048780487805

3604129,3,B001GCUNWQ,"Given the uninspired nature of it's predecessor, one would be surprised to discover how delightfully solid Ice Age's third (and, hopefully, final) ""dawn"" really is.

Although the number of prominent characters crowds the film, often resulting in a depressingly slow crawl as the directors attempt to keep screen time balanced, the film, as a whole, is undoubtedly a more realized product that enjoys it's new reptilian elements.

Simon Pegg is a surprisingly wise addition to the family, delivering the most consistency in terms of humor.  The old trio, consequently, takes a backseat to the new stars, sadly being of little significance in the overall plot and it's eventual resolution.

Still, the animation is satisfying, even in the wake of Pixar's ""UP"" and the primordial squirrel scenarios are as hilarious as ever.",1324166400,9,821,5.244274809160306

It sure would be nice to talk to a real person at Amazon, but I couldn't find a # to call anywhere on your Amazon web page.
 I contacted you guys 7 days ago and you told me it would be picked up at my house the next day, UPS never showed up the next day or any day at all, this is the worst service I've ever had, if I don't here back from you guys I will put a stop payment and never use Amazon again, look at your records I'm sure you will find that I've been a loyal costumer of yours for a very long time, it's not a very good policy for you guys to ignore a customer and let it get to this point.

There are a large number of out of screen effects that extend 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer. 6 OOS effects reached 25%. The best two for Longevity & Depth are Skrat and his lady friend in tar bubbles reaching 25%, lasting for about a minute and very short lived anteater punching bag reaching an impressive 40%.

*** Funny with an enjoyable story line. Excellent graphics add to the 3D ***

MY 3D RATING = EXCELLENT (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)

Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised.

3604195,4,B001GCUNWQ,"Ice Age:The Dawn of the Dinosaurs(released July/09)is the latest in the Ice Age franchise with the return of the ""herd"" of Manny(Ray Romano),Diego(Denis Leary),Sid the Sloth(John Leguizamo),Ellie(Queen Latifah),Crash(Seann Scott) and Eddie(Josh Peck).It is another whirlwind adventure with the same heart the previous films have had.
This time around Ellie is pregnant and Manny is the doting but extremely nervous father to be. A crisis of sorts comes about when Diego realizes that Manny's priorities have changed and feels it's probably best Sid and he moved on. Diego leaves while Sid ventures not too far only to find three dinosaur eggs from an unknown species. He instantly declares himself their parent and comes back to show HE is now a parent also. Manny warns him to return the eggs to their original location but Sid will hear none of it. He leaves and the eggs hatch and we see he has become the proud parent of three....baby tyrannosaurs! They of course bond with him declaring him to be their mommy.
Well it is of course natural that whose ever eggs they were,they are going to come looking for them. And sure enough the mother T-Rex shows up to claim her young. Sid puts up some objections which deters the mother not a speck. She picks up her babies AND Sid and heads for the underground cave from whence Sid first got the eggs. In the mothers travels she passes Diego,who witnessing the surreal scene,decides to follow the T-Rex,which works out well as Manny,Ellie and the gang hook up as they are also following the mother. Their pursuit leads them all into a huge underground cavern which harbours a nature time capsule full of supposedly extinct dinosaurs of which the mother T-Rex is just one.
Almost immediately they run into a weasel with an eye patch called Buck(Simon Pegg).He lives there and has been chasing a large Baronyx called Rudy who took his eye. He talks with an Aussie accent and is more than a little eccentric. He guides them from here on into the underground world they are about to enter. First they navigate the chasm of death where the air is filled with helium gas. They next move on to lava falls but get ambushed by a pack of smaller carnivorous reptiles after Ellie gets separated from the rest due to unstable rocks. The group attempts to double back and save Ellie from certain death. Diego is first there and becomes her saviour until Manny can get there.
Meanwhile Sid has been in a parent contest with the mommy T-Rex but it is a losing battle. She's all over him like a dirty shirt. She welcomes Sid into her family but the next day Sid is separated from his kids and the mother after an attack by giant Rudy. He ends up on a floating rock in a lava field headed for lava falls. His screams are heard by all and Buck,Crash and Eddie decide to head out to rescue Sid. They commandeer a pterodactyl and just as they spot him and head in they are jumped by other flying reptiles. Through alot of fancy maneuvering and some sling shots by Eddie and Crash,they save Sid just as he starts to plummet over the falls.
Meanwhile back on the rocks with Ellie she has finally given birth to a sweet baby girl they will call Peaches. It's another Ice Age tear jerking moment. Sid arrives on the scene to witness the newborn but regrets that as they start to head back home that he never had a chance to say goodbye to his family. Just as they reach the entrance Rudy pops up scattering the group. At that moment the mother T-Rex  stampedes onto the scene and pushes Rudy over a cliff. Thinking that Rudy is now gone Buck decides to come topside with the rest. Just as they are about to leave the cavern Rudy's call is heard echoing in the distance and Buck decides to stay to hound his old nemesis. The group returns to the surface and introduces little Peaches to her new cold environment. Diego says he plans to stay with Manny and company as he has all the adventure anyone could ever want with them.
The running gag Scrat is of course seen throughout the film. This time his pursuit of his ever lovin' acorn is temporarily halted by the presence of a girl flying squirrel called Scratte,whom he sets up a domestic life with. Lou Rawls""You'll never find"" plays in the background as the two court but Scrattes demanding ways finally frustrate him so much that when he spies his acorn(which now also has its own song sung to the tune of ""Alone Again,Naturally""),he returns to it with glee. But the two are soon arguing again and when the acorn is slammed into the ground this causes a lava explosion which sends Scrat and his nut back to the surface. As he dances about with glee the piece of ice hurled skyward as he broke through now returns sending the nut back to the cavern below and seals the hole. Scrat simply loses it and screams.
This film,like the last,comes in at around 91 minutes,and it has the consistent quality of the first. The payoff at the end(with Diego staying on and the group being together again) is anti-climactic. The real payoff is the birth of Peaches,which,as I said,is another tearjerker of a moment. The plot is fast moving and the world is populated with alot of fascinating creatures. You will notice that the creatures themselves,like the T-Rex mom and Rudy,are all drawn without sharp edges and less than realistic faces as not to scare the small-fries in the audience. This is not Jurassic Park and the Ice Age creators know and deliver to their demo,not alienating their adult viewers(with their smart dialogue)in the process.
Technically the film has been transferred into its 1:85:1 a/r and the picture is crisp and clear. Extras include some commentary and trailers.
All in all yet another winner from Blue Sky animation that the whole family can enjoy.",1310083200,,5736,4.623529411764705

By the way I have a big family, I have a son 28, twin boys 24, a son 22, a daughter 21, and a daughter 5. And the older kids have wives, and husband. I am 47 and my husband 51. Then their is also the grandkids, so when I say it is a movie for all ages, I know what I'm talking about. We don't try to pick it apart and analize it, we just watch it for what it is a GREAT MOVIE!!!AND I say it is about time that they started making movies that we can watch with the kids, Todays teens and young adults don't think it's a good movie unless its filled with vulgarity and lots of nudity and sex. So now when a good FAMILY movie comes along they don't like it. And my husband and I have also discussed the fact that even these type movies that are supposed to be for kids are all filled with hints, and lots (not sure how it is spelled so forgive me) IN_U_IN_DO and unless your very dumb, you get it. Most kids don't get it, but Adults should. We figure they do it so that the movies WILL ""APPEAL"" to all ages,thus selling more movies. And I have to admit, it really does make the movie funnier to the adults watching. But I still think we need more movies like this. I own almost all of the Shrek movies, which I bought on Amazon. I just love them and I am one of those who are sad that it has come to an end. I just hope they have another Ice Age coming, I would hate to see it also end. I would love to see this crazy bunch (family) raise the baby that Ellie gaves birth to in this movie. I REALLY hope that this is not the last one.

3604287,4,B001GCUNWQ,"To compare the strengths and weaknesses of two different types of 3D I watched this movie with both the red/green anaglyph 3D glasses that comes with the 3D DVD, and with a pair of TV Eyes 3D Glasses, a new kind of non-electronic 3D glasses designed for use with regular 2D movies and TVs.

Ice Age is always a fun franchise, and Dawn of the Dinosaurs holds up that tradition admirably. This DVD comes with both a 3D format DVD, and a regular 2D DVD, as well as 4 pair of red/green cardboard (anaglyph) 3D glasses.

I watched both versions of the movie on a 32 inch RCA HDTV, and turned off the room lights as the DVD instructed for 3D viewing.

I tried the 3D version of the movie with the red/green glasses first, and I was surprised at how well the colors came through. Often anaglyph movies can have a strange silvering effect, basically washing out all but a few colors, but this DVD actually did very well. The mammoths', sloth's, and tiger's fur all looked the right color brown, and the white of the snow and blue of the sky came through nicely. It did tend to make dark blues and greens stand out oddly, and eyes and mouths tended to have an oddly psychedelic flashing quality as they went from pink to white and back again, especially in fast motion scenes.

For the most part the tracking and converging of the frames was very good, ghosting was mostly limited to far away objects, which could gain a pink side shadow, and the occasional odd effect, such as one scene where the possum's noses were very luridly pink all during one scene.

The depth of the image was nice, adding a true three dimensional feel to the backgrounds, and while there weren't any ""jump out"" scenes that I noticed, there were some wonderfully deep and solid looking scenes, such as when Sid and the eggs are thrown into the air and briefly ""float"" in space until they start falling.

This is definitely the old fashioned ""50's"" style of 3D, with the colored glasses, but overall it was done very well and made for a very entertaining movie.

Next, I watched the 2D version of the movie in 3D with the TV Eyes 3D glasses. TV Eyes 3D glasses are a bit odd compared to most other 3D glasses, because they have a row of small holes across each lens. You have to look through the holes to watch the movie. I didn't think they'd actually work when I first tried them, if nothing else I figured it would just be impossible to see out of the holes, regardless of whether they did anything 3D or not.

They did make the room dimmer when I tried them on, but once I aligned the holes the way the instructions said, and turned off the lights, I could see the TV just fine.

This type of 3D was not as deep as the red/green 3D glasses. Things didn't stand out quite so much in some scenes, but the characters did look very solid and three dimensional. The main difference (aside from the colors) that I saw was that the red/green glasses had a tendency to give a ""layered"" look to some scenes. Almost a pop-up book effect sometimes as if things had been laid on top of each other. The TV Eyes 3D wasn't as deep, but the transitions seemed to be smoother. Giving a more natural look to the depth it had.

The other thing that I really liked about the TV Eyes 3D was that it made the picture very clear and sharp. The 3D was actually higher definition than my regular HDTV. I couldn't see the scan lines or pixels, so it made it look that much more real without losing detail. And the colors were very natural. There wasn't any problem with psychedelic colors or the pink flashing eyes like with the red/green glasses. It was just like the normal movie picture had been upgraded for clarity, while also adding a bit of depth, like the background had been pushed back so you could see the shape of everything.

So, for me, it was a toss up. For a really deep 3D experience I'd go for the 3D version of the movie with the red/green glasses. But for a more natural, less distracting 3D view I'd probably go with the 2D version of the movie and the TV Eyes 3D Glasses.

I also saw this movie in it's original 3D theater release in Real-D 3D. That effect was about halfway between the two discussed here, Real-D at the theater had all the depth of the red/green 3D version, while having the natural colors of the TV Eyes 3D version.

But, however you decide to watch it, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is a totally fun movie. From its mad-weasel dinosaur hunter, to its ""lonely hearts"" musical scene of the acorn being ""Alone Again"" when Scrat gives it up for the love of a flying squirrel.

3604289,5,B001GCUNWQ,"Be afraid, be VERY afraid!  Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs is back and it is as funny as the previous two offerings that see us once again reunited with Manny the Mammoth, Ellie the former Possum, her adopted brothers Eddie and Crash, Diego the sabre tooth tiger, and of course Sid the Sloth.  Of course Scratte the Squirrel is on hand to add to the laughter and mayhem that marks this the third in a wonderful series.

Ellie is going to be mom and there is no one more fearful about this than Manny and because of this he really putting his friendship with Diego and Sid under a lot of strain.  Sid feeling left out decides to ""adopt"" three eggs little know they are T-Rex eggs and that Mommy T-Rex is going to come looking for them.

I could not stop laughing when I watched this movie.  It has funny moments and hilarious moments.  Like when Manny realizes that the world below his own world has creatures FAR bigger than him and they include a murderous dinosaur called Rudy who is hunted by the mad but exceedingly likable weasel Buck, voiced over by Simon Pegg.

In the world below the ice age we are treated to some wonderful imagery and of course adult jokes that will fly over the head of any child, but will make adults chuckle wickedly.

Watch out for Sid's relationship with the at first cheesed off Mommy T-Rex and how she comes to aid in his hour of need and how the three baby T-Rex's take after Sid by scratching their bum and looking delightfully sweet but dim.

I loved this movie and I love the Scratte scenes with the acorn loving squirrel falling in love and the wonderful Scratte Tango which brings tears to your eyes.

3604290,2,B001GCUNWQ,"Before you get all up in arms, note that I adore the first two `Ice Age' films.  In fact, I recently gave the first one a 5-star review.  I agree that these films layer on the sap sometimes and that Pixar is far better equipped to actually illicit emotions out of us, but these films have (up until now) delivered sheer comedic enjoyment.

Sadly, `Dawn of the Dinosaurs' just doesn't cut it.

I'm going to make this short and (not so) sweet.  The film is basically too much of the same shtick.  There really is nothing new here.  The sequences seem like regurgitated moments from the two earlier (better) installments, and the whole `adventure' aspect of the films second half felt like a poorly realized `Dora' episode.  The funny moments were far and few in between.  That's what really upset me.  I can forgive a film like `Ice Age' for being slightly redundant if that redundancy produces the funny, but this film made me chuckle twice that I can think of (that helium scene was hilarious, but helium is always hilarious).  The `unusual' family aspect of this film is a great idea, but it just doesn't hold together so wonderfully here.  The films first half is too sappy and uneventful and the films second half is too predictable and uninspired.

I really wanted to love this movie.

The film borrows too heavily from more well rounded and better thought out films.  There are obvious comparisons to be made to Shrek, which is sad since this film should be able to stand on its own.  I also want to call to attention to crude jokes inserted in this film.  There were a handful of them, and I was kind of shocked.  I'm no prude, but this is a kid's movie, and some of the things done and said were highly inappropriate.  I didn't expect that from this movie.

Scrat was the films main highlight (as he was for the first two films as well) and yet here his sub-plot also felt a tad forced.  The inclusion of the female counterpart was an obvious attempt to spruce up his storyline and add a layer of freshness to his tired routine, but it only worked in parts.

All in all I can't really recommend this film.  The first two films are far better.  It's not awful, but it is far from good.  If you love the first two and have yet to see this, see it.  Simon Pegg is always welcome, and his character Buck has some nice moments.  Sadly though, this film fails to live up to what I expected and all that it could have (and should have) been.",1281312000,6,2441,4.390625

This time we have dinosaurs as both protagonists and antagonists, along with a mate for Scrat.  All the other main characters are back from the first two movies, with the same actors and actresses providing the voices.  Like the first two movies, this one is a combination of comedy and family drama.  The soundtrack is lackluster, the comedy is primarily one-liners and some screwball comedy, and the action is OK.

Running time: 94 min. PG - 2009

As someone who is at home with three kids I have to watch a lot of children's programming and that includes movies. Some are bad, some are tolerable and others are actually good. The movie ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" falls into the latter category. Ray Romano and the rest of the cast return for the third entry in the ""Ice Age"" series as the mammoths are expecting a baby along with discovering dinosaurs in the lost world. The movie is highly entertaining for kids as well as adults. Simon Pegg plays a weasel who steals the show. The scenes with Scrat and the acorn seem a bit drawn out but still funny.

I'm too old for 3D...it would be more like 2 1/2D. I have always liked Raymond Ramano, so naturally, I enjoyed the movie due in large part to his characterization of the male mammoth. Queen Latifa was delightful also, but they both paled next to the portrayal of Sid, their friend. I would recommend this movie to just about anyone who enjoys fun stories.",1279065600,,520,4.542553191489362

3604312,5,B001GCUNWQ,"Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is pretty much exactly like the other Ice Age movie I watched a couple years ago- incredibly exciting animations, a constant flow of humor and creativity, and a distinct amount of craziness and whackiness to every single one of the talkative forest critters in the woods, haha.

What makes the Ice Age series so wonderful is that *all* the characters are memorable, not just a select few.  These animated animals travel through rivers, down dangerous paths, fall down steep cliffs, ride through volcanos and waterfalls... this is actually some of the prettiest animation I've ever seen, second only to the Simpsons I suppose.

Anyway, the story in this film is about the sloth character who discovers dinosaur eggs, and when they hatch, he wants to mother them.  Of course ""you know who"" doesn't want that to happen (the mother dinosaur) and from there, the adventure of a lifetime takes place.

I still believe adults can enjoy these type of movies just as much as children.  You don't have to buy these kind of films for children only.

I was laughing the entire time, and I believe you will too.  That is, if you share a love for animated comedies the same way I do.  Even when you're not laughing, you'll be so amazed by the neverending creative aspect of the storytelling that you won't bother caring about anything else.  A flawless film.",1272672000,,1375,4.739495798319328
3604313,5,B001GCUNWQ,"I had seen this movie at the theater. When we bought our Blu-ray DVD player, I decided to make this one of the first movies we watched. The color and detail are amazing - it is so hard to believe that this is done with computer animation. It is so life like. The character are really ""fleshed out"" in this one. Manny's approaching fatherhood, Diego's unrest, Sid's desire to be a ""mommy"" - just the entire movie is lots of fun. The script is incredible. Some of the punch lines are very funny. You can see where the creators ""borrowed"" from other movies like Jarassic Park, Indiana Jones, Journey to the Center of the Earth, etc. But it fits in so smoothly, you really don't care. The scene with the ""laughing gas"" is hysterical! I think adults as well as kids will love this film.

So far, i've watched it twice and wouldn't mind seeing it again. The comedy would have you smiling throughout the movie until the end when everything gets a little serious.

I think the third movie is the funniest yet -- especially with the little squirrel and his acorn that almost always 'steals the show'.  And you have to really feel for poor Manny, who is becoming a new daddy -- poor sap just doesn't know what to do with himself, so he goes overboard (in a hilarious way) trying to prepare for his first baby.

This movie has one great new character: Buck, I love the mix of whatever he is and a weasel. He is adventurous and very funny not to mention cool. Combined with Crash, Eddie, Sid and Buck this movie is a knock out!

I saw this in 3-D, spetacular! I have a plasma tv and the regular DVD is incredible to see. I am going to get it in Blu-Ray soon to see how it differs, I can't think it would be that much. I find the 3d animations pretty clear in just the DVD where as regular movies aren't.

3604530,5,B001GCUNWQ,"Someone else commented that this movie was horrible and full of sexual innuendo.  I really think he had to have had it confused with part two, Ice Age: The Meltdown.  Part three, Dawn of the Dinosaurs was way better.  Part 2 definitely had some trashy stuff in it.  Our son watched it once in the theater when he was 4, didn't understand the bad stuff, and we've never let him watch it again since.  We almost walked out of the theater except that grandma and grandpa took us and it was their treat.

But this one is SO SO SO SO SO much better!  It's very funny.  Scrat meets a girl and, according to my son who is now 6, they kiss in the sunset and that marries them, so when they're moving in together later on it's ok because they're married.  If that explanation works for your kids, great!  But I think that's really about the only thing.

We laughed so hard.  We actually went back to the theater 4 days later to watch it again.  We love parts 1 and 3.  Skip 2 altogether.  Just explain to your kids that Manny meets another mammoth and gets married and they have some new friends join them.  That's all you've missed.

Just when you thought they might have run out of idea's for this storyline, they came up with Dawn of the Dinosaurs. The 'Dinosaurs' putting a whole new twist on everything. The squirrel is back 'nuttier' than ever. This time around he has a girlfriend to deal with! He'll never be the same again! I must say, I was happy to see more of the squirrel in the third movie.

No life lessons here, just constant slapstick with sexual overtones. My seven year old enjoyed it because she didn't get the lewd stuff, but it got old for me pretty quickly. Just my opinion. This is the end of the run for me, and it's a shame, but I guess when you run out of creativity and need to bring in revenue this is what happens. Stuff like ""Oh, it's a boy!""

3604669,4,B001GCUNWQ,"I've always had a soft spot for the Ice Age movies.  They were always closer to the Saturday morning cartoons which stressed fun over story, but still had a little message ticked away.  Ice Age 3 is no different, very fun, with a little bit of a message.  Again, new characters are added, most of which are fun.  The silent dinosaurs are funny, and sweet in a destructive way.  The best new addition is Buck, the crazed dino hunter/guide.  Very funny, and crazy and added another level of humor to the familiar characters that are already fun. If I had a complaint it would be the use of the coming of age story.  Like Shrek 3, this movie follows the new pattern of having a coming of age/midlife crisis story within a kids movie.  Frankly, kids movies seem to be the last place these type of stories belong.  But unlike Shrek 3, this movie wasn't bogged down by the story, but just used it as a stepping stone for more fun.

Overall, Ice Age 3 probably won't win over any new fans, but it will definitely be a lot of fun for the fans of the previous movies.  Recommended for someone looking for some fun g-rated entertainment.",1259107200,,1127,4.396135265700483
3604670,3,B001GCUNWQ,"I liked the first 2 installments of Ice Age.  Hope the third one doesn't run out of steam because the filmmakers pushed it too far.  I say hope because I haven't seen the third one yet.  I own it but cannot watch it.  All the special features and the menus are fine but the audio for the feature film is all distorted.  I checked my player settings and all connections and played other BD titles and no problems with them, just with IA3.  SO I take the disc back to Best Buy and get a replacement and same problem which leads me to believe that it was a production run glitch for that particular batch and that no matter how many times I get it replaced from that store, the same problem will repeat itself.  I found a customer service number for FOX that I will try tomorrow when they open and see what I can find out there.  I'll post my findings if they come to any fruition.

Just putting this out there to see if others have gotten defective copies as well.  This is the first BD that I have had problems with as far as defects go.  Then there's the problem of when the studios use inferior film elements for their BD releases.  Can anyone say 2010: The Year We Make Contact?  It's a travesty that it was released on BD what with many sequences being so grainy, you think you're watching it through a thin layer of sand.  But 'nuff said 'bout that title.

3604713,2,B001GCUNWQ,"I found this movie beautiful and boring.

Spoilers below!

The weasel character was an obvious rehash of Crocodile Dundee.  Has it been so long that nobody recognizes that?

The eventual relationship between the mother T-Rex and Sid reminded me of the dragon that falls in love with Donkey during Shrek.

I never thought for a moment that anything bad would really happen to Sid, so the suspense turned out to be how many big dinosaur feet the characters would dodge on the way to his inevitable rescue.

Diego has devolved into a boring selfish middle-aged sabre toothed tiger that doesn't want to find a mate, or get motivated to do anything unless disaster strikes.  I'll resist the obvious joke that he's grown rather long in the tooth.  Nope, I couldn't resist, actually.

Addng a love interest for Scratt was the most original thing I saw happen in this movie.  Scratt grew the most of any character in the movie.

So, if you want to see your lovable Ice Age characters do goofy fun stuff and not get smooshed under a dinosaur foot, this is the movie for you.  Or, if you want to see all the new ways to fail to get a nut, you'll have fun here.  If you expect anything more, you might find yourself waiting for it to end.",1257638400,3,1227,4.472972972972973

While Manny (Ray Romano) and Ellie (Queen Latifah) are anxiously waiting the birth of their baby, lonely Sid (John Leguizamo) discovers three large eggs that hatch into a trio of rambunctious baby dinosaurs. When their angry mother arrives and carries them to a mysterious underground world inhabited by towering dinosaurs, Manny, Ellie, Crash (Seann William Scott), Eddie (Josh Peck) and Diego (Denis Leary) find themselves at the bottom of the food chain and enlist the help of a deranged but courageous one-eyed weasel named Buck (Simon Pegg). Meanwhile, Scrat falls in love a with crafty sabre-toothed squirrel named Scratte. ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" is certainly one of the most enjoyable summer movies of 2009. Though its story lacks some depth, the 94-minute animated film still offers plenty of humor and excitement for both adult and young audiences. The computer animation looks remarkably stunning.

If you're looking for an amusing animated movie that looks terrific on Blu-Ray and includes numerous special features, then ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" is a highly recommended purchase. The animated blockbuster looks outstanding but a 3-D option would have been a great bonus. The 7.1 DTS-HD audio is quite good but not as great as the video transfer. The Blu-Ray has a really good number of extras: audio commentary track by the filmmakers, several behind-the-scenes featurettes (Unearthing the Lost World, Buck: From Easel to Weasel & Falling for Scratte), a 2-minute music video, two animated shorts staring Scratt (Gone Nutty & No Time for Nuts) and two deleted scenes in their original storyboard format.

1. Having to buy the Blu-Ray version in order to get the digital copy
2. Not having access to the Extras because they are on the Blu-Ray

Note - before pre-ordering this disk I did contact the studio store asking about a digital copy other than with the Blu-Ray and was NOT informed by them that the Special Features would be Blu-Ray. If I could at least access them on the regular DVD I'd be satisfied. Now I'm just irritated.

Regarding the film itself, I love it!  The irony of other reviewers complaining about dinosaurs being alive just makes me wonder... When is the last time you went to an animated film for reality and historical accuracy???  Problems with suspension of disbelief???  REALLY????  In an animated film with talking animals that never in reality were a herd together???  And the dinosaurs being alive is what they have a problem with???  ROFLMAO!!!

At the same time, Diego (Denis Leary) finds himself unable to catch a cocky gazelle (Bill Hader) he has been stalking and decides to leave the herd, believing that he is losing his predatory nature as a tiger. Sid (John Leguizamo) grows jealous of Manny and Ellie and ""adopts"" three apparently abandoned eggs that he finds in an icy underground cavern and call them Eggbert, Shelly, and Yoko. Manny tells him to put them back, but Sid instead looks after the eggs, which hatch into baby Tyrannosaurus the next morning.

Although Sid tries his best to raise the three dinosaurs, their rambunctious behavior scares away all the other animals' young and ruins a playground Manny built for Ellie's baby. A female Tyrannosaurus, Momma, whose eggs Sid stole, soon returns and carries both Sid and her young underground, with Diego in pursuit.

Manny, Ellie, Crash, and Eddie (Seann William Scott, Josh Peck) follow as well and discover that the icy cavern leads to a vast jungle populated by dinosaurs thought to be extinct. Here, an Ankylosaurus threatens the herd despite Diego's efforts to fend it off; they are saved from a further crowd of angry reptiles by an insane, one-eyed weasel named Buckminster, or Buck (Simon Pegg).

Buck has been living in this jungle for some time and is chasing Rudy (a huge albino Baryonyx), intending to avenge the eye he lost to it. He agrees to lead the herd through the jungle's perils to Lava Falls, where Momma has taken Sid and her babies.

In the meantime, Sid and Momma try to outdo each other in feeding the offspring; he loses this contest, but is soon welcomed into the family regardless. The next day, however, Sid is separated from the family and attacked by Rudy. Sid is knocked onto a loose rock slab that is floating on a river of lava and about to plummet over the falls.

As the herd moves toward Lava Falls, Ellie goes into labor and a Guanlong pack strikes, causing a rock slide that separates her from Manny and Diego. Manny doubles back to protect her and Diego fends off further attacks, while Buck takes Crash and Eddie ahead to rescue Sid. Just as he goes over the falls, the trio swoops in on a commandeered Pteranodon only to been chased by a flock of Quetzalcoatlus on the way and saves his life.

Manny reaches Ellie, and there is suddenly a reaction, the cry of a newborn baby, then he sees that it is a girl. He wants to name her Ellie, or Little Ellie, but Ellie instead names her Peaches after the fruit (and the codeword they had chosen for Ellie to use if she went into labor during the trip). Sid is saddened at the fact that he never had a chance to say goodbye to ""his"" children as he returns to the herd and learns of Peaches' birth.

Before they can exit the jungle, Rudy attacks at full force; Buck lures Rudy away from the group and is nearly eaten himself, before Diego saves him at the last second. They then ensnare him briefly, but he escapes and resumes his onslaught. The herd is saved by the timely arrival of Momma, who charges at Rudy and knocks him off a cliff before roaring her victory. As she and her children wish Sid well, Buck - now without a purpose in life since Rudy is gone - decides to join the herd and live on the surface.

However, a distant roar tells him that Rudy is still alive; he changes his mind and sends the herd home, blocking off the path to the underground jungle at the same time so that no one else can go down there. Manny and Ellie welcome Peaches into their frozen world and admit that Sid did a good job looking after Momma's children (though Manny tells Diego that he will never let Sid babysit Peaches). Diego decides to remain with the herd, while Buck stays where he wants to be: underground, battling it out with Rudy.

The storyline is great, the characters are awesome, and the pace of the film is very fast. Basically, it is a film that you shouldn't miss out on. So far, its the best animated film of 2009 (that I've seen).

My advice, buy this DVD. It's a great movie that is sure to please both young and old alike. So, what are you waiting for? It's time to go prehistoric with Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs!",1257120000,7,4788,4.453196347031963
3604724,4,B001GCUNWQ,"Wonderfully creative and a fabulous great time to watch - best of the four Ice Age flicks.  I loved how the animators created the sense of size and weight of the Dino's.  This movie is definitely worthy of being the summer box office smash hit that it was, grossing 878.5 million worldwide.  Pixar, Disney, and Dreamworks can only ""wish"" they could produce a ""cash-cow"" like this movie for under 90 million.  I love some of the computer animated movies from those companies, as well.

I saw Ice Age 3 for the first time when it came out on DVD.  I loved it. The movie had a very strong story but well-tempered by the comedy relief of Scrat, Scratte, & the Acorn. Speaking of the Scrat & Scratte scenes, this movie revived my interest in the classic song ""You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine,"" by Lou Rawls, which was used as a romantic backdrop in those scenes.  It is a beautiful song.  I remember seeing Lou Rawls sing it on TV when I was a kid.

After renting this movie to see it for the first time, I purchased my own DVD copy on Amazon.

I have the blu-ray version of this movie as well.  The blu-ray version seems to be a poorly programed.  It is the only blu-ray in my collection that makes the device lock up every time, just after the movie starts with the opening scene of Scrat and Scratte.",1257033600,,1307,4.333333333333333
3604725,4,B001GCUNWQ,"I like all 3 of the ""Ice Age"" films.

Not the best animated films ever made, but they are enjoyable.

Now, I remember purchasing the original film when released on DVD.  All 3 films have made about the same at the American box office.

The Crash & Eddie characters introduced in the 2cd film are just as funny as they were before.

I enjoyed & found myself laughing several times in this film.
A point, similar to ""Jurassic Park 3"" where a similar looking dinosaur was the main villain dinosaur  Rudy in this film.

1 thing I do NOT like was the today references.  Like a character talking on a cell phone, the today phrases
Tacky & unnecessary.

Cheap, with NO EXTRAS on this.  Made nearly $200 million at the US box office & no extras.  Cheap.

Kids, families will enjoy the film.",1257033600,,782,4.391608391608392

This movie had a fantastic storyline with the whole parenting and what you would do for your friends/children.  It didn't disappoint because it wasn't cheesy, either.  These movies are ones that I will be sharing with my children one day.  With it on Blu Ray, you can really tell the effort put into it.

(Sometimes I imagine she's laughing at conning me into watching these snore fests, but nine year olds aren't that devious, right?) At any rate just like the first two movies Ice Age Dawn of the Dino's didn't disappoint. I laughed out loud and frequently.

3604761,5,B001GCUNWQ,"""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" marks the third CG animated film for 20th Century Fox via Fox's CGI division Blue Sky Studios and the third ""Ice Age"" film directed by Carlos Saldanha (also directed ""Robots"" and ""Gone Nutty"").  The film is co-directed by Mike Thurmeier (""Horton Hears a Who"", ""Robots"", ""Gone Nutty"") and a story by Jason Carter Eaton and a screenplay by Pete Ackerman, Michael Berg (both worked on previous ""Ice Age"" films), Yoni Brenner and Mike Reiss (""The Simpsons"", The Critic"", ""It's Garry Shandling's Show"").  Music is composed by John Powell (""X-Men: The Last Stand"", ""United 93"", ""Kung Fu Panda"").

Back in 2002, the original ""Ice Age"" film focused on the friendship between creatures Manny the woolly mammoth (voice over by Ray Romano, ""Everybody Loves Raymond""), Sid the weird looking, not-so-bright and clumsy ground sloth (voiced by John Leguizamo, ""ER"", ""Miracle at St. Anna"", ""Titan A.E."") and the saber-toothed tiger (aka smilodon) named Diego (voiced by Denis Leary, ""Rescue Me"").  Also, seen outside of the main core of the group is side-story featuring a squirrel known as Scrat who has a passion towards acorns.

With the first film focusing on the migration to avoid the Ice Age and the main character's friendship, the second film ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"" (2006) features the melting of the ice and focuses on Manny finding another woolly mammoth named Ellie (voice by Queen Latifah, ""Mad Money"", ""Chicago"").

This time around for the third film ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"", Ellie is now pregnant and is soon to give birth.  Being the worried and concerned father, Manny is highly anticipating the birth of his child and each kick, he often accidentally tells the whole herd that Ellie is about to give birth.

Meanwhile, his friends are not in a better place. Diego is getting older and feels that he is not the agile fighter as he once was as he now gets dizzy and can't even chase after his prey like he once used to. So, Diego feels as if he has to leave home. Sid feels alone now that his best friend has other responsibilities.  As for the nutty squirrel known as Scrat, upon discovering his beloved acorn, he becomes smitten with a female squirrel named Scratte who is also passionate for the acorn.

Manny creates a playground for his upcoming child and surprises Ellie with it.  Meanwhile, Sid feeling that he has no one ends up falling through a hole and discovering three eggs.  Wanting to be a parent himself, he brings the three eggs to the village.  Because of the size, Manny tells Sid to return the eggs back to its mother but Sid of course has other plans.  Not wanting to be alone, he ends up sleeping with the eggs and when hatched, three baby Tyrannosaurus Rex's come out and Sid becomes the designated ""mother"" for the three which he names Eggbert, Shelly and Yoko.

Excited about being a parent, he tries to introduce to his new children to his friends but instead brings the three to Manny's playground (which was supposed to be for Manny and Ellie's child).  The kids of the village then join in on the fun and because of the Tyrannosaurus Rex's nature, they begin to roughhouse the children and end up swallowing a few of them.  Also, in the process...the three young dinosaurs end up destroying the playground.

Manny and Ellie arrive to find the destruction and Manny is upset that Sid didn't listen to him and now the playground he built is destroyed.  To make things worse, the true mother of the three baby Tyrannosaurus Rex now wants her children back and leads the huge dinosaur right into their village.

The Tyrannosaurus Rex ends up getting her children back but with Sid not willing to give up the children, he is taken as well by the dinosaur.

Now Manny, Ellie, Diego along with the two weasels Crash (voiced by Seann William Scott, ""American Pie"" films) and Eddie (Josh Peck, ""Drake & Josh"", ""The Wackness"") end up going after the dinosaur to find Sid and find themselves away from the ice and into a new land where there is no snow and dinosaurs exist.  Not knowing how to survive around the dangerous dinosaurs, they run into a one-eyed weasel named Buck (voiced by Simon Pegg, ""Hot Fuzz"", ""Sean of the Dead"", ""Star Trek"") who knows his way around the area.

So, the group try to survive the dangerous dinosaurs, tough terrain but most importantly trying to be careful for the nastiest dinosaur of them all...Rudy.

""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" on Blu-ray comes with three discs.  The original Blu-ray is accompanied with the movie on DVD and also a digital copy.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" looks absolutely gorgeous on Blu-ray.  Presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1, AVC@36 MBPS), I'm always impressed to see how hair/fur continues to look better and better via CG and the sheer detail found in each character and its surroundings are much more evident now than ever.  In fact, this is probably the most vibrant ""Ice Age"" film due to the fact that the film is taken outside of its ice habitat and into the land of the dinosaurs where there is a lot of lush plant life, sunlight, etc.  Overall, CG animated fans will love the picture quality of this film.  Sky Blue Studios did a fantastic job!

As for the audio, the film is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (also, Spanish, French and Portuguese 5.1 Dolby Digital) and as fantastic as the picture quality was, the audio quality is just as magnificent.  Talk about an immersive soundtrack, dinosaur growls all around you and how its utilized through the surround and rear surround channels are nicely done. Front and center channels feature the dialogue and the music which are crystal clear.  Also, good use of LFE during the action sequences.

Both video and audio quality for ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaur"" receive high marks!  Fans of the film will definitely enjoy this Blu-ray release.

As for subtitles, subtitles are provided in English SDH, Spanish, Portuguese, Cantonese and Mandarin.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I was actually quite pleased with ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"".  A fun screenplay, top notch animation and audio and voiced by an all-star cast, this is my favorite ""Ice Age"" film yet!  Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, Denis Leary, Queen Latifah do a fantastic job as they have in previous films.  But also, Josh Peck and Seann William Scott do a hilarious job as Eddie and Crash.  And Simon Pegg as the one-eyed weasel known as Buck does a fantastic job as well!

I was really impressed of how much detail was in the actual film.  To have the characters in a new setting outside of just ice was great and it really showcased the animation due to the fact that more colors and different characters can be utilized.  Blue Sky Studios did a fantastic job on this release.

As for the Blu-ray release, this is where Twentieth Century Fox also receives big kudos.  Similar to what Disney has done for their films, Twentieth Century Fox also included a DVD (for those long commutes for your children) and also a digital copy.  Also, there are plenty of special features and CG shorts included as well.  In fact, if you are a big fan of the character of Scrat, you are definitely going to enjoy this film!

Overall, ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" is the best film of the series yet and an exciting and hilarious CG animated film to own on Blu-ray.  Highly recommended!",1256601600,21,10867,4.832069339111593

She gets scared a bit easily and this was no problem for her.  She also didn't mind sitting through the whole thing and we all cracked up.

When we took the older two girls they also loved this film, it appeals to all ages but isn't inappropriate for younger kids.  GREAT MOVIE!

Graphics were astonishing, especially in 3D--although also great in non 3 D.  This is a perfect movie for blu ray (of course, they all look better on blue ray, but i can imagine that this will really pop on blue ray compared to some other movies.

The family theme was number one in this Ice Age. The adult humor was good, but it was still child-friendly. There were a lot of sweet moments, and the action/adventure in the underground dino-world contrasted nicely with the feel-good stuff. I like how the T-Rex befriended Sid, that was cute. The cuteness factor went way off the charts. I did enjoy the movie, but I felt like there was something missing the whole time...not sure what, though.",1253664000,2,583,4.615384615384615

Diego thinks he's losing his predatory nature, and Sid is jealous of Manny and finds three eggs in a cave. It turns out that they are dinosaur eggs. Soon, the mother comes looking for her babies, and ends up taking Sid back to her 'dinosaur world' Manny, Diego, Ellie, Crash, and Eddie decide to go save him.

3604795,5,B001GCUNWQ,"REVIEW FROM KIDS' FLIX (DAD'S PICKS) BY TOM LAMARR, [...]

What does comedian Denis Leary have in common with a visit from Uncle Rick?  At least when bringing saber-toothed Diego to life in any of his three Ice Age movies, Leary manages to be likable, funny, and caustic, without once swearing in front of the kids.  Not a single ""WTF?"" or any of the other phrases familiar to fans of Leary--and Uncle Rick.  It's an impressive feat by any measure, one seriously deserving of its own WTF.

The rest of the recurring cast--headed by Ray Romanof, John Leguizamo, and starting with the sophomore Meltdown, Queen Latifah--also turn out to be welcome houseguests for both parents and children.  Yet with so many comedians on the bill, it is Scratte, the beleaguered prehistoric squirrel-rat, who gets the biggest laughs from grownups and kids alike, and this entirely through physical humor.  Even as animated characters go, Scratte is very animated.

Meeting the definition of true family entertainment, Ice Age has something for everyone.  With the third installment due soon on DVD, it might be worth seeing winter's first snowy weekend as an excuse to hold an Ice Age film fest.  But don't forget to invite Uncle Rick.  He's a big Leary fan, and he'll want to be there when your twelve year old proclaims, ""Now, that was [expletive deleted] great.""
