8684183,5,B00OM7C3VG,"If you go to the website, you can download two free episodes to see if you like it.  They are clear and engaging.  The biggest downfall is that there is only one volume, which means only 20  words.  I also heard rumors that it was Christian, so I wrote the company who said that while it is from a ""christian perspective it can be utilized by anyone"" and they ""hope to produce more in the future"".  On the ""christian perspective"" - I watched one episode and my children watched two so far..... we never saw or heard anything?  I'm thinking the company is from a ""christian perspective"" but this show might not include anything?  I will post an update if I see anything, but so far nothing.",1423440000,4,689,4.377952755905512
