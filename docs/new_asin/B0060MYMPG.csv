4913914,1,B0060MYMPG,"I LOVE THE KILLING. Let me say that first. However I purchased the first two seasons on dvd because Netflix did not offer subtitles and I am hearing impaired. Season pne had great captions/subtitles. Season two has none. No special features at all. Just the episodes. The ONLY reason I purchased the dvds was for subtitles. My god, don't almost all dvds nowadays have that feature?!! Im so angry about this. Its cheap packaging and zero features. What a joke. >:(",1365552000,39,463,4.728395061728395

4913916,5,B0060MYMPG,A lot of people are giving this show negative reviews based on the fact that their is no official DVD release. While that upsets me too because I would love the Blu ray set to match with my first season set I purchased long ago we should stop bashing that it is released on CD-R and be thankful that Amazon at least made the show available to us fans. Otherwise none of us would have it in our collections. I have bought other shows as well on CD-R and while it is not the preferred method to own shows the discs always work fine and the quality is still there. The picture looks good on this and just glad to have it. As far as the show it is quite good as is the first season. If you enjoyed the first season don't hesitate to pick this one up too! Quality show! Recommended! Can't wait for the newly announced season 3!,1365120000,19,822,4.111801242236025
4913917,1,B0060MYMPG,I'll make an exception over the release of the 2nd season of Killing..I enjoyed season 1 very much and was eagerly awaiting season 2 and wondering why it wasn't being released. Just a few mintes ago I was ready to buy the finally release season 2 when I realized it was a dvd-r with no sdh/english subtitles. The season one had them of course so I naturally assumed season 2 would also never suspecting an AMC/Amazon dvd-r collaboration that showed no regards for people that purchased season 1. This is uncalled for and shows no respect for people who need sdh-and yes I am still very ticked off even after venting. Shame on all involved in this.,1365033600,95,647,4.538461538461538
4913918,1,B0060MYMPG,"Come on AMC AND AMAZON stop being so cheap ! Actually I fully blame AMC for the lack of a proper release for a show they eventually decided to renew ! I feel betrayed giving them my money for season one on blu ray only to find out eventually the second season wouldn't be released in a traditional format.

However, if the Network didn't see fit to release the Second Season properly and on Blu-ray then shame on them.  Kudos to Amazon for picking this up to satisfy fans of this show, for this was an excellent show.

4914053,5,B0060MYMPG,I've been wanting to buy this season on DVD as a gift for my grandmother since she doesn't have Netflix or anything and couldn't find this season anywhere. I watched it beforehand to make sure it worked well and everything was fine because of some of the reviews. The sound was perfect and since subtitles aren't important to her that wasn't a problem since it doesn't come with them. The picture was great as well.

I've managed to see & purchase both seasons and can't imagine stopping at season 1 for any reason because the show is SO great! As many other reviewers before me have eloquently said this show is like ""The Wire"" in that it requires an investment of time & energy to follow all the characters and story lines but the 'reward' is rich & satisfying like few shows I've ever seen.

What I loved so much about this show was how nuanced and profound many of the scenes are. The show reveals the depth of character not only for the Cops investigating Rosie Larsen's murder, but it spends a great deal of time on her grieving family. The scene where Rosie's father calls her cellphone weeks after she has died to confess his shortcomings, is typical of this gut wrenching story as it unfolds. While some viewers were upset that it took 2 full seasons to reveal Rosie's killer, I found the journey rich and very satisfying and wo... Read more",1444521600,,1010,4.401069518716578

and it's very moody. These things will affect the way that you watch the show. Everything from the actors clothes, their makeup, the weather on the set, and even the music will have you a little tense.  It is a very well written show. So if you can take dark and moody I would recommend it. An excellent scripts with lots of twists and intrigue with excellent acting

The 2nd season season follows the continued investigation into the murder of local teenager Rosie Larsen, with each episode covering approximately 24 hours. The season culminated in the closing of the Larsen murder, with the discovery of those involved with the murder.",1431734400,,727,4.761904761904762

And I felt that I was rewarded by sticking with it.  All of the elements that pulled me in and kept me invested in the first season of The Killing were still present in Season 2, especially the dynamics between the two detectives, Linden and Holder. The final reveal of who killed Rosie Larsen was a shocker and worth the wait.",1409011200,,525,4.458333333333333
4914983,5,B0060MYMPG,"I picked up the Killing Season 1 on a whim at a used bookstore and loved the show.  Since the murder of Rosie Larsen wasn't resolved with Season 1, I purchased Season 2 which concludes the Rosie Larsen mystery (the two seasons comprise 26 episodes).  There are a variety of characters and storylines that intertwine and the show does a great job of conveying how many different people can become suspects or persons of interest whenever a small amount of circumstantial evidence is uncovered.  The acting all around is excellent and the characters feel very authentic.

Just a note on the DVD-R discs which is a Median On Demand product from Amazon.  I was a little skeptical at first but the DVD-R discs played perfectly on my Sony PlayStation 3 Blu-Ray Player.  There was absolutely no problems with the video or sound on the 3 discs (13 episodes).  The video picture quality was equal to the Season 1 discs in my opinion.",1408924800,2,924,4.666666666666667

4915105,5,B0060MYMPG,"Most murder mystery shows on TV solve a murder every episode. Not so ""The Killing."" It investigates the murder of Rosie Larsen over the course of two seasons, not revealing the killer(s) until the final episode. In other words, you have to watch 26 episodes to figure out who did it. And. It. Is. Worth. It. For me, a good mystery novel is one I can't put down. As I watched ""The Killing"" Season 2, I couldn't put my Kindle Fire down. This is one of the best murder mystery shows on television. In addition to the whodunnit, we get family crisis, political intrigue, mental breakdown, and crooked law enforcement.
