1819268,5,B00007L4KS,I love Michael Beach and Eric Lasalle.  This movie was a philly cheese steak and a bag of chips...with a soda!!!!  Meaning...it was all of that!!,1080000000,,145,4.538461538461538
1819269,5,B00007L4KS,"Actor Michael Beach of THIRD WATCH, WAITING TO EXHALE, and numerous other projects, portray a psychiatrist/doctor who knows everything about dealing with emotionally/mentally disturbed patients, but never caught a clue when his own daughter took her own life.  Moving his practice, he's invited to work at a mental hospital and seems to have the answers for how to cure and/or control the patients, and is willing to do it his way, whether the director likes it or not.  His pride being his biggest flaw, he meets his match with his latest patient, played by Eriq LaSalle.  Dressed to the nines with a eloquent manner and speech, he addresses himself as Satan and wants to use the doctor's help in overhauling his image, because it's become a real drag in being the so-called ""bad guy"" in every disaster on this earth, no matter how big or small.  From this point, the psychological aspects come in as to whether this guy is really crazy, or is he really the prince of darkness?  What does he really want with the doctor, or is this a very elaborate scam?  Truly, a thinking movie that runs deeper than the norm, and that made it a hit with me.",1065398400,28,1144,4.610837438423645
1819270,5,B00007L4KS,"This is a great movie for those who love alternative films. It's strange, it's haunting and has a great ending that dosn't throw a huge punch but is a stunner nevertheless.",1050364800,5,172,4.580645161290323
1819271,1,B00007L4KS,"Will keep this short and sweet: Good picture quality, good sound, no action. It is a bit strange, which will keep your attention, and keep you guessing. However, you keep waiting and waiting for a grand finale, something really weird to happen at the end, or something that explains it better....just to find NOTHING. Watched it with my wife, she fell asleep, and I fought sleep in hopes of a great ending to what was a boring movie. SKIP THIS!",1047340800,2,444,4.5625
1819272,5,B00007L4KS,"This movie was great with all of it's hidden meanings and ultimate plot turn. I don't want to give this movie away but Eriq LaSalle's performance is superb, along with this being his directorial debut, he takes you to this place deep inside your soul to experience the horror of denial, vanity, and inner ego. Highly recommend! Go out and see it.. you'll be talking about it for hours!",1044835200,6,385,4.594202898550725

1819289,5,B00007L4KS,This movie pushed religious boundaries yet did it in a very subtle way. The man had options and unfortunately he chose poorly. I would definitely watch another movie by the creators,1443657600,,181,4.870967741935484

1819296,5,B00007L4KS,Watch and Listen Carefully to understand this movie.,1426118400,,52,5.625
1819297,4,B00007L4KS,"Clever, well put together spin on the devil on earth looking for a soul to take. Sort like Crossroads (1986). I especially like the ending movie song selection-""Change"" by Keb Mo, from the cd ""The Door"".",1425168000,,203,4.666666666666667
1819318,5,B00007L4KS,"I love different ways in telling a story that has been told so many times (which in this case is the devil).  This movie was very different and although it did premiere on the big screen, it is worth seeing.",1424390400,,207,4.175
1819319,5,B00007L4KS,"This was a hard to follow movie because of the ending. One is left unsure of what really occurred. What I think is great that the the director Eriq LaSalle, wanted viewers to come up with their own ending. I spoken to some friends who  watched the movie and we all had different interpretation of the story.
I also like how  the discussion of good/bad and god/devil is used to open your imagination.",1420329600,,399,4.4520547945205475
1819320,5,B00007L4KS,Excellent movie that I've been searching for a number of years!,1413590400,,63,4.818181818181818

1819323,5,B00007L4KS,"What can I say? I enjoyed it.
Not an amazing movie, but entertaining nonetheless.

Oh for the love of banana milk...six more words to satisfy Amazon.",1393891200,,149,4.730769230769231
1819324,5,B00007L4KS,"This isn't a film you're likely to see on cable, or promoted through any pay-for-view service; so it's under-appreciated. And while Michael Beach ""stars"" in it, his performance is more than matched by the film's director Eriq La Salle, and the ensemble featuring Ronny Cox, Sinbad, Jane Carr and others,  Well worth the 113 minutes you'll spend watching it.",1390089600,,357,5.0508474576271185
1819325,5,B00007L4KS,"Great movie, good acting, wonderful story, people need to wake up , Eric played his part well, recommend people to watch it",1384387200,,123,4.636363636363637
1819326,5,B00007L4KS,Chose 5 stars because I love crazy movies. I love everything about the movie because it is crazy as hell.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who like to laugh and who love crazy movies,1379203200,,189,4.25
1819327,1,B00007L4KS,"The movie never played through to the end. me and my wife was only able to see less than half of the movie because their is something wrong with the CD. I tried cleaning it, but it always stoped when the movie was getting to the best parts.",1364428800,,240,4.020833333333333

1819349,5,B00007L4KS,Really good movie. Disturbing in some parts but it's still really good. It's one of those movies where you will debate the reasons why certain this happened.,1356825600,,157,4.851851851851852
1819350,5,B00007L4KS,I was very impressed with the story and main actors.  This was acting at its very best.  I am surprised that Mr. Beach and Mr. La Salle are not box office maga-stars.  This movie is a perfect example of how Hollywood overlooks the best actors and best directors in America.,1353110400,,273,4.42
1819351,5,B00007L4KS,"There is nothing like having a movie capture your attention from start to finish leaving you breathless once the credits start rolling. For myself I gravitate towards thrillers, horror and deep mind twisting movies rather than sappy love stories where the ending is often typical: Boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl again (boring!)

Movies that leave you on edge and make you think are more stimulating, as you ponder the possible ""What ifs"" as the plot thickens. I like movies that force me to watch them again so that I can catch what I possibly missed the first time around.

Crazy As Hell (2002) with Eriq LaSalle left me breathless as well as curious. Just who was this Satan character and why did he end up at the mental institution of all places. The ending? Well I won't give it away, but you will find yourself replaying the scene a few times to understand what was really going on. To be honest, I still don't know! That is the allure with this movie!

Every time I watch it, I get more from the movie.  Imagine the Devil needing psychiatric help....Nice plot.....Now I'm going to read the book...",1351468800,,1133,4.566502463054187
1819352,5,B00007L4KS,"I loved this movie! The acting was excellent and the script itself was magnificent. Eric LaSalle did a great job! Kudos to Eric LaSalle!!!!!!!!!! I will definitely be watching this movie many, many times over!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1331251200,,221,5.3428571428571425
1819353,4,B00007L4KS,"the point is not the writers understanding of mental illness-it is actually his/her understanding of the god complex some doctors succumb to. the dr is ironically battling his own emotional demons and  while purportedly thoroughly understanding and trying to ""treat"" the societally recognized mental patients-failing miserably. i think it is a well thought out script, about people who think they have all of the answers trying to impress their ideas upon society while not having a freaking insite to their own failings and shortcomings resulting in them looking like complete idiots; you cannot make someone else whole if you are fragmented yourself -you need to have your own affairs in order before you start trying to ""help"" someone else achieve mental bliss and do not assume you have any idea what someone elses hell maybe or how they should deal with it because you have a piece of paper stating you are a dr.
excellent movie!",1285372800,7,934,4.987179487179487
1819354,1,B00007L4KS,The folks who wrote this script don't have a clue about mental illness or treatment. A bit of research would have helped. The plot was simplistic and the ending telegraphed. Other than LaSalle displaying some on camera charisma the film had no redeeming qualities. Don't waste your time on it. You can get more meaning out of a classic comic. A colossal waste of time.,1281484800,,368,4.676923076923077
1819355,5,B00007L4KS,I highly recommend you purchase this item for your Black Cinema Collection. Why? Just because.,1274313600,,94,5.333333333333333
1819356,4,B00007L4KS,"I watch this movie because someone beg me to watch it. I don't recommend rated ""R"" movies because I'm a follower of Christ and with this particular rating is not my choice. But I will say this about the movie.....It has a lot of reality about the movie and it served as a ""Wake up call"". Its not just a matter if you know God, but do He(God) know you and are you living for Him and NOT yourself.

This movie was more than just entertainment......it has a powerful message behind it.

REPENT & Believe the Gospel....Jesus is Lord and this will never change, wherever you are, in hell or heaven.",1258502400,2,593,4.333333333333333

1819368,5,B00007L4KS,"this had to be one of the strangest films i've ever seen. but at the same time one of the best. Ty Adams is a unconventional therapist whose unusual methods lead him to be followed by a documentary crew (lead by John C. McGinley) for 30 days at Sedah(hades spelled backwards). while there a patient enters the hospital claiming to be Satan. so begins Ty's downward spiral into insanity as he is unsure whether this man truly is the devil, or he himself is insane. the ending is spectacular. i highly recommend it to anyone.",1248566400,5,523,4.515789473684211
1819369,5,B00007L4KS,"Ladies, you've got to check this out!  The movie has a good plot that
keeps you interested and wondering whats next.  LaSalle is so amazing
in this film.  He is classy, witty, and so sexy too!  Just watch and
you'll see.  He'll give you what you wish you had!  Hats off to the
author and whomever picked the stars!  Make more please!?  And check
out the fine Doctor too!  Enjoy!",1242172800,,378,4.285714285714286
1819370,1,B00007L4KS,"This movie seems to have been written by someone with little or no knowledge about psychiatry and psychiatric hospitals and their patients.  I cringed when they showed the patients in the common room all out of control with readily available weapons such as pool sticks. Also one of the patients had a trophy in her room, something that could bash someone's head in. Furthermore Eriq La Salle's lame character, ""Satan,"" has a cane and a scarf--no no's for this type of hospital. The lack of attention to detail and common sense was annoying. This movie was really pathetic.",1237420800,3,573,4.846938775510204
1819371,4,B00007L4KS,A real good movie full of religious overtones. Fine acting performaces by both Eriq La Salle and Michael Beach. Very nice twist at the end.,1235174400,,139,4.6
1819372,1,B00007L4KS,I was disappointed with this movie. I watched it with friends and family members and they all feel asleep. It had a confusing and bad ending with me.,1234396800,2,149,4.357142857142857
1819373,4,B00007L4KS,"This was a really good film of which I knew nothing about before finding it while browsing through the shelf at the video store.  Great dialogue from beginning to end.  I don't want to spoil it for you, but it certainly gives some good insight on those with ""God-complexes"".",1158364800,10,274,4.571428571428571
1819374,1,B00007L4KS,"This film - given the cast could have been interesting, however it lacks any coherent or relavent non-coherent editing due to the fact that it has NO ORGANIZATION. It is fine that it is based from a novel but I don't want to read the novel - I WANTED TO WATCH THE FILM. If you want to see a novel explained correctly in a film format then watch Kubrick's film BARRY LYDON. It is essentially a poor re-write of a morality play based for everyman.",1151020800,2,445,4.247058823529412
1819375,1,B00007L4KS,"Oh...man ARE U KIDDING ME?/??//.If u looking for some movie or something to put u in sleep,Then rent or buy this DVD!!.

1819376,1,B00007L4KS,Really bad movie not even worth watching on a rainy day,1111449600,,55,4.090909090909091
1819377,4,B00007L4KS,"Director/co-star Eriq LaSalle's CRAZY AS HELL is an enigmatic, disturbing movie--is it a horror movie or is it a psychological thriller, or is it a little of both?  It's pacing is more cerebral, and its plot thick with premonitions and suggestions.  What is it with the hospital anyway?  Patients are allowed to run loose in the halls.  Patients acquire trophies and brooms.  They are all on medication.  Enter the idealistic doctor who thinks he can ""cure"" these people, take them off their medication, and send them all home.  At this point, the movie has a surreal quality.  Psychiatrists DON'T go into their patient's rooms and sneak around.  Psychiatrists DON'T tell the patient why they are behaving like they are.  The patient's rooms are like low budget motels, but still very well kept.  And then enters the patient who says he's Satan.  This is all shrouded in complex scenes wherein our good doctor starts talking to his dead wife and daughter.  By the way, he is responsible for his daughter's suicide because he wouldn't prescribe her medicine.

Michael Beach plays the doctor with a smug assuredness, that belies a man who seems to be falling apart.  LaSalle as Satan has the pompacity of Isaac Hayes, the swagger of Denzel Washington and the quiet menace of Tony Todd.  Stalwart Ronny Cox plays the head honcho with his usual smarmy smugness, with an  undertone of more.  John C. McGinley as the director of the video is cleverly malevolent and conspiratorial.  Tracy Pettit as the patient the doctor vows to cure and win a bet on, to boot, has little dialogue, but she has the vacant composure of a mentally challenged young woman.

All in all, CRAZY AS HELL is a very different kind of movie, one that might lead you to question YOUR religious predilections.  Kudos to LaSalle for the innovativeness on such a low budget.",1102118400,16,1838,4.8083067092651754
7977899,4,B00007L4KS,Pretty good movie. Watched about 10 years ago and thought a friend would enjoy so decided to watch again but not included with prime. Big boos for that!,1526083200,,152,4.464285714285714
7977900,3,B00007L4KS,"The overall plot of this movie is unique and refreshing for the horror/thriller genre. However, the ending is all over the place and makes no sense--robbing this film of being higher than 3 stars",1522368000,,195,4.764705882352941
7977901,5,B00007L4KS,"This movie is amazing. I am a Christian and my music minister recommended this to me.
