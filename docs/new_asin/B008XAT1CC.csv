5188881,5,B008XAT1CC,"Motorama is a wonderfully quirky and offbeat half dream, half reality fantasy drama, which is symbolic of the escapism which troubled children often use to survive. Jordan Christopher Michael is ten year old Gus, a boy who steals the family car to escape from a violent father. He sets out in search of the fabled Motorama millions, a fabulous prize offered by a chain of filling stations, where you have to collect letter cards that spell out Motorama. After a while, he begins to understand where he really wants his life to go. The movie is a very enjoyable moral tale, peopled by the weirdest characters, and its a collector's dream with all the great cameo appearances.",1388793600,,674,4.769230769230769
