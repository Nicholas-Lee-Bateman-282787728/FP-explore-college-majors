In the 2300's, interstellar travel takes place using ""inflation gates"". These gates use wormholes to pass through different dimensions. Through these wormholes, an enemy called a ""GHOUL"" comes into our world. A group of female pilots has arrived at the space station Watcher's Nest to complete their pilot training. Among them is Misaki Kureha, who lost her father in an accident at watchers nest over 10 years ago. She has come there to learn the truth. The general public isn't aware of the GHOULS. So when the new pilots encounter them, they are very surprised. Misaki learns that they are the reason her father died, and that she has a strange connection to them.

THE MISAKI CHRONICLES
The crew of the residential ring find themselves back at Earth, but are separated from it by a temporal barrier. When the pilots cross this barrier, the realize that Earth is actually in a different time continuum. The crew of the Watcher's Nest must collapse this barrier to stop the invasion, even if it costs them their ticket home, and their relationship with Misaki.

This DVD set contains both seasons of Divergence Eve. It comes in a thick case with the DVDs on a spindle. I'm kinda torn between it and the cases with the flaps. The spindle is kind of annoying, but the cases with flaps are really bad to break during shipping. It's a toss up I guess. This series has good animation, and a pretty well thought out plot. The CG animation for the battle scenes is not bad. I do think that the GHOULS and the thing that Misaki turns into are kinda dumb looking. Their battles are very slow moving and odd looking. The soundtrack is very unique and not bad. There is also a lot of fan service and some nudity. The downfalls of this series are the relatively uninteresting characters, and the failure to background them. The characters have potential, but we never really get to know them, not even our heroine, Misaki. It was hard to get attached to them b/c you never get know anything about who they are as people. There were some moments that were supposed to be dramatic, but they never capitalized. Most of this series was spent with the science officer and a big shot jerk talking vaguely about Misaki's potential powers. It didn't ever develop into anything memorable. I think this series was mediocre in every aspect. It's not bad, but you're probably not going to tell your friends about it, or invite them over to watch it with you. If you can rent it before buying it, I recommend doing that before you buy it.",1353801600,2,2530,4.632516703786192

A word of warning, there are two seraphim collections out there. A thin-pack version, and a terrible one where all the DVDs are just stacked on top of each other on a spindle. Unfortunately i got the horrible spindle variety. if your buying this make sure you get the thin-pack version! im writing this review for the stack pack one but i think Amazon links the two into one review. The Stack pack has the lead character crouching and pointing her gun at you, the better thin-pack has her standing in a kinda sexy pose with her arm above her head. Get that one if you buying the complete collection",1297209600,23,668,4.387096774193548
