I missed the return date because I didn't watch it in time of Amazons ""cut off return date"" So I got screwed & I'm stuck with it.

8465092,5,B005CBWRKS,"I watched the Monster Jam World Finals 12 live and it was and always is the greatest show!!!  Watching it on dvd was like being there again.  All seats are great and you hardly miss anything but the DVD captures a lot and you get to see the things you missed even when you thought you didn't miss anything.  The filming is great, doesn't bounce around or make you dizzy by jumping around, but does capture all action.  Of course, watching it live is highly recommended but watching the DVD comes in a great 2nd.  If you are into monster trucks, behind the scenes (take off areas audiences aren't allowed) and action, you won't be disappointed in this.  There are shots in the free style that must see and even live didn't seem as amazing as it showed on the DVD.  I hightly recomend the DVD.  And being able to watch it over and over is the best, you can only see it once live, but as many times as you want with DVD AND you can even rewind, pause, rewind again and not that you would want to fast forward through this, it's fun watching the trucks go even faster when you fastforward them.",1367712000,3,1090,4.282926829268293
8465093,5,B005CBWRKS,Love Monster Jam and all of the DVD sets of the World Finals. This set is # 12 and is as good as sets 1 through 11.,1356480000,,115,3.2962962962962963
