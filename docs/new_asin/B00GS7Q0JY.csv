8626667,5,B00GS7Q0JY,"What might happen if China called the debt that our country owes to them? This film explores how that could play out. Electronics shut down, cars cruise to a stop, and planes fall out of the sky. China does make the chips, after all. Welcome to the new Peoples Republic. The film shows what a situation like this would be like for many Americans who are unprepared for even a short term local break down, much less a full blown society wide TEOTWAWKI event like in the film. The main characters are woefully unprepared for the horror that is to come. Will they accept the Citizen Band bracelets that are required for anyone who wants food or water? Is there something much more sinister than meets the eye about those bracelets? The scenario put forth in the film looks chillingly possible.""Does anyone think our trillion dollar debt to China is just going to go away?""",1404086400,4,869,4.612903225806452
8626668,1,B00GS7Q0JY,"Duke (Ethan Flower) gets laid off from his NSA job. He moves into his grandfather's mountain home, only to find out it is rented out to a Mexican (Eloy Mndez). About the same time the US defaults on our loan to China and the next thing you know, planes are dropping out of the sky. This is Y2K bug on steroids. Duke, with the help of an old time neighbor, (William Knight) work to survive against no TV, no phones, no new cars operational, and every man suddenly becomes a rapist.

As dad tries to save the world, mom (sa Wallander) whines he doesn't spend enough time with his daughter (Hope Laubach). They run out of food about the same time his sister (Jenn Gotzon) announces... ""the toilets are out of water!!!!""

The US falls into a police state with ""citizens"" wearing controlling wrist bands just like the preppers predicted. Americans freely side with the Chinese Communists....for a nifty red wrist band. Not as good as a Nokia concept phone, but hey, it makes the arm.

This is a low budget ""Red Dawn"" light, that has so many plot holes, the movie is ridiculous. At the end, during the most serious scene of the film, as Duke makes a hard decision, I was laughing at the MST quality.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. Off screen rape. No nudity.",1390435200,8,1246,4.5
