This program should have been combined with other DVDs. What's the point of releasing a discs that is only 8 minutes long? On the back of the DVD's cover, it says for Grad 6 to 12. Definitely, for grad 9 to 12 students, the DVD is too short.

I did finish watching this show. Dr. Know and an dietician made an experiment to determine if junk food causes acne. They selected 2 women for the task. One ate junk food such as fried stuff, pizza, etc for a whole week. The other ate only healthy food such as vegetable, whole grains for a week. Scientifically, the result of this  is not consider accurate. It's because it's done with only 2 participants. That's sample is too small. Had they done it with 10 people, the result would have been more convincing.

I borrowed other discs in the same series too. Some of them were 40 minutes long. That's better in the way that they spend enough time to scientifically discuss a subject.",1344470400,,1098,4.372549019607843
