960607,5,6305051089,"An excellent movie. It's amazing how a ""Wasp"" like Renee Zellweger can be so convincing as an Ultra-Orthodox Jewish woman. That said, you do not have to be Jewish to appreciate the human drama describe in this movie, and its comment on religious extremism.

960608,4,6305051089,"I enjoyed this movie but at times I felt it as unrealistic that a girl who grew up in such environment could be so far off in her behavior.

960699,4,6305051089,This was a very entertaining movie - all of the actors did a great job. This movie is not for everyone because it had some disturbing scenes. All the actors did a great job and it actually pulled you into the story.,1403481600,,215,4.142857142857143
960700,5,6305051089,"While the movie does not give a favorable view of the hasidic Jews world, it is a gripping story of one woman balancing two worlds and a passion for art.  This movie will bring forth strong emotions and question the idea of faith.",1399593600,,230,4.348837209302325
960701,5,6305051089,"Beautifully filmed and acted story of the conflict between Hasidism and the secular world.  The film was,, on occasion, painful to watch but worth it.  The backdrops, accents and other production values were totally accurate.",1398384000,2,225,5.4

960705,5,6305051089,"Anyone who has felt disenfranchised by the family or group in which they grew up will enjoy this movie. I find Zellweger's character difficult, yet realistic and brave in giving up everything for something I find entirely priceless - freedom. Now, freedom can mean many different things, but ""Price Above Rubies"" conveys multiple layers of freedom, including my favorite - that of a woman who is being forced into a socially-agreed-upon role and has the ""balls"" to walk away with nothing so that she can be true to herself.",1392940800,5,523,4.887640449438202
960706,3,6305051089,"If you don't understand the life of a hasidic woman, it won't make much of a difference to you. Renee's character was hiding behind the role she was assumed to play. She always knew there was more to it than just ""that"". Being a wife was not enough and it took a lot of loss to show here there was more. It was a good demonstration, and she had the accent down!!",1392595200,,362,4.041666666666667
960781,5,6305051089,This movie is about a married Jewish woman whose family believes in old Jewish traditions that a woman should marry instead of pursuing a career.  She is approached by her brother-in-law who knows that her father taught her to be an expert in jewelry.  She has an affair with him.  Then she is caught and cast out of by the Jews.  It is about a one sided tradition that the men are right and the women have no rights even in today's time.,1392163200,,438,4.240963855421687

960786,5,6305051089,"It is true that the film is set in the Hasidic community but this is a universal tale of throwing off one's cultural conditioning and living one's own truth. Memes prevail in any dominant culture or subculture and we accept them as being true--here the journey of the heroine is more sharply drawn because her nature is so at variance with the traditional expectations of the community she was born into.

It's far from being a perfect film in any artistic sense,  but I loved it anyway. The performances are wonderful and Christopher Eccleston is a standout as the deeply a/immoral brother-in-law who has found a way to live around and/or rationalize religious laws. His character is strongly contrasted with that of Sonya's [ Zellweger's], a sort of latter day Anna Karenina, who could go on as she is and adopt a mantle of hypocrisy, or break with everything and live according to her own internal compass, discovering her own strength and talents along the way. Enjoyable.",1388188800,3,976,4.838323353293413
960787,5,6305051089,An interesting and unexpected little film with two of our favorite actresses in roles unlike anything else we know them from.

960869,5,6305051089,"I have watched this movie several times before I purchased it.  The purchased product arrived in excellent condition for viewing.  I really enjoyed the performances from all the actors and actresses involved in the film.  It was good to see a few in roles that show their talent beyond the popular tv series or well known film.

This movie would not be a good purchase for someone who prefers the more action packed, violent side of entertainment but if you like to see a glimpse into lives lived based on tradition and the passion to follow or to change than this might be a movie worth seeing. It can be a little difficult to follow scenes involving Sonya and her deceased brother but overall the point of the movie is made clear.",1377302400,,732,4.5227272727272725

Orthodox Jewish woman abandons her child, her husband and her culture for sex and modern jewelry.

960874,4,6305051089,"This book let's the viewer take a peek into the Orthodox Jewish religion and some of their beliefs.

960875,5,6305051089,"I loved this movie. This is a well acted film and takes one into a deeply private and mysterious religion. The beauty of the religion and its darkly primitive traditions are the center of the film, but the woman is the heart.  Understanding and love and the question, what if?",1365465600,,276,4.52
960876,5,6305051089,Very interesting to see how you can get wrap up in religion and neglect what life is all about passion/love/family,1365120000,,114,4.75
960877,5,6305051089,"An enthralling insight into the ultra orthodox Jewish Society in New York City and, also the business of buying and selling fine jewelry.  The story revolves around a very strong willed young woman, who marries a Chassidic Jew and who comes from a background in the jewelry business.  She struggles on a journey to find herself, caught between being a new mother, the wife of a Jewish scholar, an expert in fine jewelry, and above all else, her own person.

There is never a dull moment in this film, and though I describe some of the elements that comprise this film, as Paul Harvey used to say, ""And now for the rest of the story.""  It's well worth watching to see how her journey culminates.  The ending will surprise (and delight?) you.",1364515200,,740,4.575757575757576
960878,5,6305051089,This is an excellent movie starring Rene Zellweger.  Julianna Margulies is another favorite of mine.  Sonia finds herself unable to adapt to the lifestyle of a devout Hasidic Jewish wife. Her husband's brother takes advantage of her because she is starving for affection and then brings her into his jewelry business.  She continues to step further and further out of the bounds of her faith seeking the company of a Puerto Rican jewelry designer who is very poor and talented. Her husband ultimately gain some understanding of her and allows her to see her son who has been taken away from her.,1364428800,2,595,4.813725490196078

960940,3,6305051089,"Movie was delivered as promised.  If you are interested in Jewish History, this is a good movie to watch.  Sometimes we don't have a full concept of the Oxthodox Jew.  This movie will shed some light on it as it takes us into the life of a Jewish family.",1347926400,,254,4.142857142857143
960941,5,6305051089,"As a Jew, I did not see this as an ""attack"" on the Jewish religion, rather that of a young, inexperienced woman who was thrust into a world that she was not prepared for.  She followed her family's tradition but not everyone is suited for the same destiny selected for her/him in life.  I believe her soul was filled with much love which was obviously unrequited. I believe that her husband came to realize at the end the neither of them was right for one another.  Perhaps it was an arranged marriage.  From within, Renee had a burning for more than what was expected of her from the family she married into. She seemingly was educated and had great knowledge about jewelry and yearned for a career but was forced by her brother-in-law, an amoral man, to do it his way.  He was not necessarily typical of the Jewish faith, just an unfortunate member of her inherited family. She and her husband came to terms that neither really missed one another but finally did ""take time"" to acknowledge her birthday with a beautiful ruby to be set in a most artistic mounting she had found as scrap. Each grew in his own way! In the hispanic artist who created amazing jewelry, she found the love, attention, warmth, appreciation, and comfort that was lacking in her marriage.  She was brave enough to leave her son with her husband and somewhat austere family to find herself believing that he would do better in a ""stable"" environment.  Her husband actually grew when he set his learning aside and stood up to his family by taking his son home.  I believe this story was about discovery, human growth, and the persuit of the self that prompted me to watch this movie many times. Set the religion aside as there are less than savory people in all religions and focus on the fact that the main character, whose brother obviously drowned when young guided her to take the leap of faith and choose to LIVE!",1335484800,7,1893,4.547058823529412
960942,5,6305051089,The DVD came in a timely manner and in great condition!!  I could not have been more pleased! This is a wonderful movie which explores cultural dynamics within the Hassidic community.,1319846400,,183,4.903225806451613
960943,5,6305051089,"Anyone, in any culture, can feel they do not belong in that culture.  In the
""real"" world, Princess Margaret had a lot of trouble fitting in with the rules and regulations encircling her.  In this fictional movie, the heroine, Sonia Horowitz, (Renee Zelwiger), definitely does NOT fit into her world -- that of the 20th century people living as close as they can to the ways of their ancestors, as Hassidic Jews in Borough Park, Brooklyn, New York.

'A PRICE ABOVE RUBLES"" has many interesting applications.  The heroine is an intelligent, knowledgeable lady -- but her parents wanted her to marry and raise a family. Yet her husband -- a brilliant Hebrew school teacher and Torah scholar -- neglects her, taking her for granted as he savours the wonders of the Holy books instead.  As the new mother of a young son, she is reluctant to have him circumcised, and shows other signs of not being the model Hassidic woman she was brought up to be.  Yes, her parents brought her up to marry and be a mother -- but still, she knows a lot about the world of jewellery, as she did manage to learn a lot from her now-deceased father.  At a Sabbath dinner, (and the customs and ceremonies of the Hassidic community are well and truly shown -- in the Horowitz household and especially in the synagogue -- in all their splendour, noisiness, and claustrophobic atmosphere),  her husband's brother -- a jewellery dealer -- offers Sonia a job in his firm.  Most of the Hassidic women in the community DO work, (this is the 1990s, not the 1950s), and so Sonia's taking of this job is not, (at first), opposed much by her husband....

In this job, Sonia meets a wider variety of people, far more often and in far closer proximity, than perhaps she has ever done before.  Blacks, (including one truly creative genius of a jewellery-designer), Puerto Ricans, and Indians, (from India), enter her life -- and it is a tribute to her, (and, yes, her brother-in-law, who sadly has other faults), that they do not call them ""svartzahs"" (Yiddish for ""blacks"", perjoratively)-- as many, (but not all) Jews do, in real life, (being a member of one minority group, sadly, does not automatically preclude one from looking down at other minority groups.)  Sonia is very good at her job -- but unfortunately, her bother-in-law sees her not just as star employee...but as sex object....

Sonia's husband gradually becomes upset that she is at her job SO many hours of the day.  She has touched a wider world -- of many freedoms she never had before -- and he is aghast at them.  She no longer eats only kosher food when she is outside her home,  She sometimes forgets to pray three times a day.  Perhaps most grievous of all, she has begun to see herself as an independant person -- not merely her husband's wife....

When her husband decides on divorce, he throws her out of their apartment.  He does not permit her to take their son with him.  His brother lets her into his apartment -- but it seems if she stays there, she will be paramour as well as employee.  She leaves him, as well -- but not before trying to take her belongings from the safe in the jewellery store owned by her brother-in-law, and where she formerly worked.  He refuses to open the safe for her --- leaving her totally destitute.  On the street, in despearation, she calls her mother -- who says she cannot come back to live in her childhood home, because her recent behaviour, now known throughout the Hassidic neighbourhood, would ruin her sisters' chances of finding a husband.

Alone and desperate, Sonia meets again with a mysterious homeless woman, and a strange little boy, who have been turning up at all odd moments of this movie.  Sonia moves in with the homeless woman.  Looking around what looks to be a rickety attic, Sonia tells the homeless woman, ""You have nothing!""  To which the homeless woman replies, ""I have little.  It is you who have nothing.""

How Sonia gets her life back -- from a truly unexpected source, (proving that some people -- even those you least expect -- will go with their feelings, instead of tradition), completes this involving, searing, and atmospheric drama.  But it does not complete Sonia's story.  One wishes that a ""Part Two"" of this movie could be made.

..................................................................................

The actors, atmosphere, direction, costuming, dialogue, story, music, camera work, and all the other production values of this movie are first-rate.  Though one knows this is a story, the believabilty of the situations is always appearent.  So is the character of not just the Hassidic community -- but any close-knit, traditional community -- to those who want to go outside of it, and reach the wider world. It is warm and involving to those who like being in it -- but suffocatiinhg and claustrophobic to those who want to reach a wider world, and who feel they are more, and want to do more, than just what is expected of them, in these largely self-contained communities.  Princess Margaret........the Stepford Wives, (or the ""perfect 1950s housewife).........it's all the same.  Watching this movie, I wondered what Sonia had been like as a young girl, and if she had shown any rebelliousness then....

In this movie, the character of Sonia suffered from the Jewish practice of ""Cherem""...or Jewish shunning.  This was the practice that was visited upon Benedict Spinoza, as well, and many others.  As a child, I remember MY rabbi telling the class that if we weren't religious, our parents would abandon us, and go twoards Judaism, instead.  Whether practiced or not -- and at whatever age -- Cherem, (and the Amish practice of ""Shunning"" -- which amount to the same thing), are co-ersive, and cause mental and physical anguish.  It is abuse -- abuse by the community agains the individual if it is actually done, and mental abuse is if is merely threatened.  (Children see only ""black and white"" about things, after all.  Shades of grey are often beyond their understanding.  It was with me: my parents kept kosher, said the blessings, had separate dishes -- so they were religious, right?  And they would throw me out of the house if I spoke of my dreams of wanting to marry a Christian prince, (there is no present-day Israeli monarchy, after all, right?)  Not realizing that I was and am an ""Indigo"" person, (one of the characteristics of which is to be obcessed with ALL things Royal) -- and not then even knowing what ""Indigo"" people are, (whoever heard of ""Indigo"" people in the 1950s and early 1960s?), the fact that my parents ALSO gave my sister and me piano and ballet lessons on Saturday, and sometimes criticised the heirarchy of the synagogue and it's practices, just didn't register with me as a child.  I only knew they followed the CEREMONIES of Judaism....and so could never be 100% sure that they -- who were THE most loving parents in the world -- really did love me.  Thi threat of ""cherem"", in my case, amounted to nothing less than unrealized, but very real mental child abuse -- and, though unknown to anyone, parental abuse as well. I hope the many, many Indigo children being born today -- some of them, no doubt, Jewish -- will not suffer as I have suffered -- and I mention my problems not only as personal catharsis, but as a warning to parents, children -- and rabbis, alike.
Do NOT threaten cherem as a CERTAINTY.  Do NOT lump all parents -- and all religious Jews -- together!  (I recently read in Wikipedia that Cherem, by and large, has NOT been practiced since the Enlightenment!  But my 1960s rabbi seemed not to have been ""enlightened"" about this!)  Threatening little Catholic children with being put into Hell is likewise abominable.  Nightmares -- and worse -- can evolve from such a threat!  These practices ruin lives, and if they do not always ruin sanity, they come mightly close to it.  Do these traditional societies want members SO badly that they must twist and turn minds, (and hearts), to reach their required quota of religious Jews, or Catholics, or whatever?  Isn't it better to have JUST those people in these groups who SINCERELY WANT to be in them?  (And there ARE enough of these people, in every generation, believe me.)  Twisting minds, hearts, and lives, to achieve the greatest number of adherents is akin to an ""intra-community mental Inquisition""!  In my opinion, such practices as Cherem, Shunning, (or the threat of same), the warning that Hell is near for those who don't practice and don't believe, should be banned in all civilized countries!  (After all, would a truly LOVING God condone such practices?????? (!)

Sonia, however, lives through her period of ""cherem"", and is released from it by, as I have mentined, a most unexpected source.  This movie, ""A PRICE ABOVE RUBIES"", is in itself something which can claim to be a price above rubles.  Showing people who value tradition above human lives, even when those lives are those of members of their family -- and the anguish practices such as ""shunning"" and ""cherem"" bring, is something not dealt with, to my knowledge, in movies before.  Though not a ""message"" movie, per se, one would hope. at least, that members of all deeply religious and traditional groups which have such punishments for those who think differently and for themselves, see this movie.

He is simply mesmerizing and so spot-on that I am compelled to periodically watch it just to see him in action, complete with yamulke!

Rubies is a Jewish mysticism/chick flick (if that genre exists) starring Renee Zellweger as Sonia, an Orthodox Jewess jeweler who is very unhappily married to a fervent Hasidic scholar. Renee's blushes and burning cheeks are very overdone. It's hard to believe that the affection starved Sonia doesn't enjoy Sender's sexual attentions just a little given the plot set-up.

The film does a good job of depicting Jewish family life on the lower East side of NYC-Shabbat's dinners, bris ceremony, etc. Julianna Margulies turns in a very believable performance as Zellweger's sister-in-law. Sadly, as the plot progresses the more muddled it gets.

 Apparently the director is trying to evoke the imaginary aspects of a Marc Chagall painting with Sonia's brothers ghost and a kindly guiding spirit floating around in the plot. However, Sonia's burning sexuality is the snake in this garden. Too bad the director just didn't acknowledge that, it could have been a much better movie since it deals with universal issues, heightened by fundamentalist beliefs. Oh well, bye bye sexy Sender, on to the 9th Dr. Who.",1242864000,2,1604,5.812765957446809
960945,3,6305051089,"As a Jewish woman, this film gave me the willies.  It's not that I disrespect all Hasidim Jews, as I've never been around them, but I do disrespect all fundamentalist religions, regardless of which ones they are, and this portrayed a very fundamentalist Jewish family.  A nutty husband who hadn't a clue about women's sexuality.  That didn't make sense.  The Kabbalah, four important Jewish mystical books that Jewish men study, teaches that it is imperative that a man must satisfy his wife sexually, and that her sexual feelings come even before his.  This is ignored in the film.

This husband is oblivious to anything about a woman.  He is an ignorant jerk.  So is his brother-in-law, a thief and his snotty wife.  What pompous irritating people they are.  I doubt that all Hasidim are this way, but I've read a few true stories, and some of this story probably doesn't fall too far from the truth.  Thank goodness, the vast majority of all Jews think nothing like they did.

Renee Zelwegger, one of my favorite actresses, who can portray almost any character was very good, and that was the best part of the whole film. Actually, I thought all the actors were good.  I didn't understand a few things.  Who was the old woman in the black dress? Why did the little boy keep appearing, and what was he supposed to represent?  I didn't get that part.  The film falls between fantasy and reality, and if you like that sort of film, you will like this one.  The best part was that the wife got away from her crazy family.

My advice to her would be to find a sharp gentile non Catholic lawyer so she could a legal divorce and get her son back and away from those crazy people.",1238976000,3,1675,4.5083056478405314

She is very much into the material world and what it has to offer. She gets a chance in the jewelry business through her brother-in-law but it has a high price. While working for him, she meets a Puerto Rican jewelry designer and artist whose work gives her joy but she also encounters grief by meeting him. The story is pretty much about a woman struggling to be herself in a rigid community. But you can also see how for some people it's very comforting to have strong rules and codes.

The movie is written and edited in such a way I found it hard to follow. Especially in the beginning. It's too bad because this could have been great movie. Instead I found myself frustrated watching it.",1154995200,5,863,4.3602484472049685

960980,3,6305051089,"I enjoyed this film very much, although I can see from the reviews that because it portrays negative aspects of a particular religious culture, it is receiving the usual reflexive denials from other members, as if one is obligated only to make movies that show all cultures as wonderful all the time!  For the man who asked what would happen if they made movies like this about blacks and Indians - well, first of all, they did, for decades, and this movie is not remotely on a par with those as reductions of an entire people or culture.  Someone who criticized the film didn't even watch it attentively enough to figure out that the ghostly child was Sonia's brother, not her ""childhood friend"", and then there's the illiterate review by someone who claims to be Jewish but complains about the movie being too Jewish . . . where do these people come from?!

Unhappy marriages occur in cultures the world over, and while the story does expose some of the hypocrisies of Orthodox culture, it isn't, per se, about those hypocrisies, nor does it reduce Orthodox culture to them.  It's about Sonia Horowitz's struggle to find out where she really belongs - in doing so she makes huge mistakes and pays a heavy price for her dearly-bought self-knowledge.  I've known people who left communities like this one precisely because they couldn't handle the restrictions - that's not an indictment of Orthodox Judaism, it only demonstrates that not everyone born into a certain culture actually belongs there.

The performances are excellent - special mention must go to Christopher Eccleston (a ""goy"" from Manchester, England, if you please!) for his coldly compelling performance as Sonia's amoral brother-in-law.  Eccleston, more familiar to mainstream audiences as the baleful Duke of Norfolk to Cate Blanchett's Elizabeth I, playing an Orthodox jeweler in Brooklyn's Borough Park, is one of those wonderful mysteries of art that one can only be glad about. His fine performance aside, one of the flaws of the film is that there is insufficient background for his character's utter lack of conscience - we are only told through the narration of one childhood incident that he has always been so.  Glenn Fitzgerald gives a sensitive performance as Mendel, Sonia's husband, as he struggles to come to terms with his wife's upheaval, and the dawning knowledge that they are dismally unsuited to each other.  Renee Zellwegger gives an emotionally fraught performance as Sonia - this actress is talented, but displays now-recognizable mannerisms that she needs to bring under control.  However, in this role, as the character is virtually having a nervous breakdown, these mannerisms served her well.  The rest of the cast is very believable, as well, including Julia Margulies as Sonya's overbearing sister-in-law.

To say that a ""sincere Jew"" doesn't ignore his wife, as a reviewer below did, is absurd.  Mahatma Gandhi was a terrible husband and parent.  Sincere people everywhere do stupid things.  Sonia's husband is deeply involved with his spiritual life - Mendel's obsession with Talmudic law and spiritual goodness, while oblivious to his wife's emotional needs and sufferings until far too late, could be transposed to the marriage of any exceptionally dedicated spouse following a cause, career, or religious passion.  These conflicts are what give narratives tension and interest.

The film doesn't pretend to be anything but the story of Sonia Horowitz's emotional and spiritual struggle to figure out who she really is.  I didn't take it any other way and only someone who is already bigoted would.

The movie is worth seeing, and demonstrates the uncomfortable reality that marriage serves different purposes for different people - one may be content within a strictly defined role, and find all his or her needs met within that role, while another, for no identifiable reason, does not.",1151625600,66,3891,5.099212598425197

I didn't like renee zellweger got asked too many personal questions. For example they questioned her about the jewish ritual bath. I could understand it because i am an orthdox jew. because i have gone to yeshiva. Most non jewish pepole  cant understand the movie. As well as non orthdox jews.

960982,2,6305051089,"I was excited about renting this movie, because the world of Hasidic Jews is not often explored in the cinema.  I expected something multidimensional and eye-opening.  The movie started off well.  It had some interesting twists, like Sonia's conversations with her dead brother.  But the characters turned out to be talking heads.  They have no depth.  They are humanized stereotypes.  Sonia's husband is portrayed as stiff-necked, sexually repressed Jewish schoolmaster.  The rest of the characters are ""extras"".  They have one collective soul, one collective attitude, which is probably the effect that the director was going for.  I can tell that the director has a huge chip on his shoulder.  It's obvious that he hates anything remotely traditional.  Apparently, only secular Jews deserve sympathy.  Orthodox Jews are portrayed as arrogant and secluded.  What can be more ""liberating"" for poor little Sonia than an affair with a hip urban hispanic artist?  What a shame.  This could have been a serious movie.",1138320000,4,1014,5.283018867924528

960984,5,6305051089,"This brings to mind ""My Name is Asher Leve"".  If you like Chaim Potok's books, you will like a Price Above Rubies, for it has some of the same elements in this tale of a person who doesn't quite fit in the society in which they were born. There is also the mystical elements that remind one of ""The Book of Lights."" This movie is a good dramatization of the break that sometimes happens between the individual and society.

As for performances, Zellweiger is wonderful as Sonya.  Julianna M. ditto as the conservative and fiercely protective Rachel.  I went through the movie frustrated by the characterization of the husband, particularly when he refuses to listen or deal with Sonya. But then at the end, when he is so innocently looking at all the religious relics in Ramon's house, and then tells Sonya to come and visit their son, you can see the goodness in him and that he is well deserving of the tzaddik name.  Likewise the Rabbi and his wife were also good and accepting people. It is only a few individuals who can't look beyond personal interests who were bad, not the religion or community as a whole.  The brother is well played as an interesting and complex villian.

While I'm sure this was no favorite in the Orthodox community, it isn't Orthodoxy that is at fault -- indeed, Orthodoxy is redeemed by Mendel's behavior at the end, when he accepts her for what she is and they part respectfully and by the council of the Rebbe and his wife. It is simply that Sonya was searching for something that she could not find in her own community.

960985,1,6305051089,"Boaz Yakin's movie is the story of a woman caught in an unhappy marriage. This is an extremely wrong and depressing portrayal of orthodox Judiasm. I can point out so many instances. It starts right from the marriage, the orthodox Jewish weddings are wonderful occasions, this looks like a funeral. There are so many wrong interpretations of the bible that anyone would be offended. The worst is the Rabbi who disregards his wife, though he is such a great scholar. Some call him ""Moshe Rabbenu"". I will not go into details but no sincere Jew is allowed to disregard his wife, there is a mitzwah against it. The part where he dies and his wife comes and and thanks Renee is the silliest of all. The way the entire community is portrayed makes me think that I am looking at some other community, though I partly belong to it. Every community has its positives and negatives, but showing the negatives alone is wrong. This is a unique community that has great positives, attachment to family, scholarly spirit, artistic tendencies and so on that have been shown over generations. Some of the great american writers such as Saul Bellow came from such families. While the characters are acted well, it is totally silly and fictional.

961029,4,6305051089,"Beyond a touch of sensationalistic Hollywoodisation (over-simplifying the perceived orthodoxy of Jews) the movie is about a woman who is stifled in her relationship with a fanatically devout husband, and in that it etches an intermittently sharp portrait of a subculture caught between a rich historical legacy and a changing contemporary world.
To me, the movie was NOT about the Hasidic way of life. I could see this film holding just about as relevant even if I replaced the community potrayed in it with any other. It is about the marital suffering of two people who are very different in their moorings.
Renee Zellweger, the pivot, does a very convincing job of showing the desperation in a young woman's personal search,  Sonia, who embarks on a search for not only herself but also her place in the world -- for the duration of the film Renee gave Sonia the precise dignity and emotion that the role deserved.
The supporting cast were strong, Juliana Margulies certainly showing that she's doesn't always play the 'nice girl'. Christopher Eccleston was convincingly wicked and Glenn Fitzgerald puts in a credible performance as Mendel, the husband, capturing the essence of the role commendably.
Bordering sometimes on being a chick-flick, the movie generally deals with feminine issues, and I would think that the emotional dominion would have it seldom appeal to a male audience. Which is quite evident in the other belittling reviews here.
I recommend this film highly, although it is an intense one and perhaps not for every Joe Blogg. Make sure you're in the mood.",1074902400,25,1576,5.015267175572519

961031,4,6305051089,"A carefully and compellingly rendered drama of a contemporary woman's stirring discovery of self, ""A Price Above Rubies"" is set in the context of a Hasidic Jewish/American community. Beautifully photographed, this film's acting sparkles -- and renders a reasonably accurate portrait of an easily caricatured community.

In a role played well before her current celebrity (circa Jerry Maguire), Renee Zellweger establishes herself as a talent of unlimited possibilities. That she doesn't ""look Jewish"" (by the stereotype) does not make her less convincing....

The film's feminist perspective is gracefully realized without
belittling all guys -- which greatly enhances the film's power! (And lowers my blood pressure!)  While compelling in the early going, the plot becomes a bit overly complex. But the film remains very well worth watching throughout. Production design is exceptional!

Those Orthodox Jewish critics who are angered by this film's portrayal of Jewish Orthodoxy might have us believe that the world of Orthodoxy is monolithically benign. It is not.

Traditional thought and practice -- orthodoxy in many settings -- has its beauties and strengths, and -- like most things human-- it has its dark, shadow side as well. I've personally experienced both the light and the dark, and know they both exist. ""A Price Above Rubies"" depicts the delicate balance gone awry.

For a very different, also wonderful film which depicts both light and shadow sides of American Jewish traditionalism, but less critical of Orthodoxy, try ""The Chosen"" (1982) (adapted from Chaim Potok's book), with Robby Benson (quite good in this film, to my surprise), Rod Steiger and Maximillian Schell.

961032,3,6305051089,"Renee Zellweger plays against type as Sonia, a traditional Hasidic wife, who yearns for different experiences sexual and otherwise. On her journey, Sonia deals with extended family including a predatory brother-in-law and befriends a Puerto Rican artist (nicely portrayed by Allen Payne.)Along the way, the movie also deals with mysticism in the form of Sonia's dead brother and a homeless woman. Zellweger gives a good but subtle performance in her role.
Apparently this movie was a huge subject of controversy when it was released. The Hasidic community reportedly took offense at their portrayal and the casting of the decidedly Waspish Zellweger in the lead role. Perhaps that's why it slipped under most people's radar.
Their concern is understandable. When a group is rarely portrayed in the movies, any negative generalizations are a sensitive issue. But I think the controversy obscures what is in fact the movie's universal message. Individuals who feel that they don't belong in the community in which they've lived their entire lives and how or if they break out of that mold. The problem is not with the Hasidic community but with Sonia herself. She has to discover who she is. Unfortunately, Boaz Yakin may have been too subtle with his message and as a result most people missed it.
For the most part, I enjoyed the movie. Like Fresh, Boaz Yakin's previous film, it's a bit uneven. (Interestingly, Fresh was a source of controversy in the African American community for it's subject matter. Perhaps this is a pattern with Yakin.)

961035,4,6305051089,"Thanks to the critical and commercial success of ""Briget Jones' Diary"" in Japan, lovely Renee Zellweger's long-belated drama has been released theatrically here.  But the film seems to be seeking for its audience desperately, for when I was watching it, I could find only three audiences in theatre (maybe that's because it was Tuesday evening.  Maybe.)
Anyway, the film deserves more audiences not least because it shows one of Renne's best performance as Sonia, who lives in an Orthodox Jewish community.  If you remember Harrison Ford's ""Witness,"" the way of their life is easily pictured to yourself, and Sonia knows she has ""a burning fire"" within herself.  Actually, sexual desire or yearning for the world outside, whatever it is, it is so hot that she feels burnt within herself (and tells that the rabi, who meets unexpected fate with his wife).  Clearly discontented with her husband who is too occupied with studying the mystery of the religion, Sonia finds her husband's brother Sender is interested in her and her ability to evaluate jewelery.  But Sender's interest turns out  more than that.
If ""A Price above Rubies"" is not set in Jewish community, the plot may sound more ordinary and even banal, as a decently made, but not so special knowing-one's-self story.  As it is, the film, you might think, will put of some of the viewers because of its negative descriptions of the community.  I expected that way, but I found the fact is more complicated; first of all, except for some of the characters, the Jewish people are not shown in a negative light.  Christopher Eccleston's character Sender looks roguish in the end, and Julianna Margulies' Rechel obviously represent the aspect of narrow-mindedness, but these elements can be seen in any community.  And it should be noted that Sonia's husband is not drawn in one-sided way, finally showing his best side to his wife.  Probably director Boaz Yakin knows more than most of us about the Jewish people, so we should leave tje matter there.
Another factor that might surprise you is that the film employs a fable-like storytelling, introduing in the begining the two characters that might not exist.  They come back to Sonia, telling and listening to her, revealing the inner voice of her to the viewers.  This might be interesting to some, but I find that simply unnecessary because the strong performance of Renne Zellweger tells everything about this interesting heroine Sofia, and if only to watch her, the film is worth your money.

Sonia is not a woman who is only seeking sexual freedom, but a woman seeking a life beyond what is being offered to her.  Her brother in law does NOT say that she is a price above rubies!  In the end,  her husband--who gets trashed so much in reviews--has an evolution all of his own, and gives to Sonia the ultimate gift to a wife, a ruby.  His brother in law does not help her in the slightest, but uses her talents to best himself.

961059,4,6305051089,"This movie is centred around the thoughts and passions of an Orthodox Jewish Woman named Sonia (portrayed brilliantly by Renee Zellweger), who is less than enamoured with her people's strict rules and regulations. Sonia's fiery character seems to be totally incompatible with that of her husband's (Mendel), who is an erudite Torah Scholar. From the very beginning of the movie Sonia questions the practices of Orthodox Judaism e.g. an early scene where she is a little skeptical about the ritual of circumcision.
When Sonia's brother-in-law finds out that she is a gifted gemologist/jeweler, he offers her a job selling jewelry for him. Unfortunately, he offers her more than just the job, and due to the fact that her husband neglects her sexual needs, she succumbs. She finds an escape from the everyday burdens of being a subservient Jewish woman through the jewelry trade (and through her brother-in-law). Unfortunately, she still doesn't find freedom, as she now becomes the slave of her brother-in-law. The movie progresses with Sonia entering a downward spiral (or upward spiral depending on what you believe) from being a pious wife to an independent, critical thinking woman. However, through a remarkable set of events she triumphs by finding the one thing she wants most: freedom.
The movie is at times surreal i.e. Sonia's encounters with ghostly figures, however these scenes do not detract from the plot in any way. Renee Zellweger is excellent in this movie. The fiery scenes between Sonia and the leaders of the Jewish establishment are priceless. However, it is easy to see why many Orthodox Jews would find this movie a little controversial. It depicts the Hassidic movement as being inflexible, archaic and illogical. It definitely doesn't focus on its good points, but then again if it did the director probably wouldn't have had an audience.",994464000,10,1863,5.151815181518152
961060,4,6305051089,"The self-imposed standards regarding matters of faith to which an individual must adhere, the priorities one sets, and giving precedence to one matter of importance at the expense of another are issues addressed in ""A Price Above Rubies,"" written and directed by Boaz Yakin and starring Renee Zellweger.  After the birth of her first child, a son, a young New York City woman, Sonia Horowitz (Zellweger), struggles with emotional and sexual frustration as she attempts to cope with the extreme ideals of her husband, Mendel (Glenn Fitzgerald), an Hasidic Jew who holds God above all things, including his wife and their marriage.  Mendel is a good man, a holy man, but in his youthful zeal to please God and live according to His Word, he woefully neglects Sonia, a fact to which he has been blinded by his religious fervor.  His devotion to God is so all consuming that he is not only unable to meet, but is unaware of, the needs of his wife.
 Sonia is a good wife and mother, a good person who loves God, but is simply incapable of effecting Mendel's degree of devotion and sacrifice.  His concerns are of a spiritual nature, while hers are more immediate.  Increasingly discontent and striving for a means through which she can rise above the stature of non-entity bestowed upon her by Mendel, her life takes a turn only when her brother-in-law, Sender (Christopher Eccleston), intercedes on her behalf.  A jeweler by trade, Sender sees a value in Sonia that he likens to a price above rubies, but his efforts soon prove to be a mixed blessing for her, as ultimately her life becomes more complicated than ever.
 Yakin is to be commended for his objective approach to this story; any judgment of those involved is left to God and the audience.  He neither condemns Mendel for his-- what may be deemed by some-- excessive piety, nor does he absolve him of it's implications.  By the same token, he neither condemns nor absolves Sonia for her actions.  And by avoiding any subjective judgment of the characters, it heightens the impact of the film in that it forces the involvement of the individual viewer, who must then decide if what has transpired is appropriate or not.  It's a very subtle and effective way of drawing in the audience, wisely employed by Yakin, as it maintains a balance in the film while allowing the actions of the characters to speak for themselves.
 As Sonia, Zellweger turns in an excellent, understated performance, through which she makes you feel the exasperation of this woman in need of self-esteem and acknowledgement.  There's something of Ibsen's ""A Doll's House"" in this story, for Sonia (like Ibsen's Nora) is not motivated by selfishness, but by the desire for her family to be able to function as a whole, and to be, herself, an invaluable part of that whole.  It's a selfless pursuit for recognition and equality, rather than an ego driven quest for autonomy, and because of this it is easy to empathize with her.  Zellweger does not play Sonia for sympathy, though it would be the easy road to take with this character; she opts instead for credibility in her actions and reactions, and succeeds with an honest portrayal that makes her entirely believable.
 Fitzgerald also gives a solid performance as Mendel, a man you are neither able to like nor dislike, mainly because Fitzgerald does such a good job of maintaining the integrity of the character.  And as Sender, Eccleston does a notable turn, as well, and again the filmmaker's objectivity in presenting the relationship between the brothers adds that ring of truth that makes the contrast between the two convincing.
 The supporting cast includes Julianna Margulies (Rachel), Allen Payne (Ramon), Kim Hunter (Rebbitzn), John Randolph (Rebbe Moshe), Kathleen Chalfant (Beggar Woman), Edie Falco (Feiga), Shelton Dane (Yossi) and Jackie Ryan (Young Sonia).  Yakin's delicate handling of the sensitive subject matter, as well as the unqualified non-judgmental tone of the film, puts the value of ""A Price Above Rubies"" at a cut above the usual drama that seeks to deal with the issues of religious ardor.  The ending of the film may not resolve the matters at hand to every viewer's satisfaction, but it's honest, and consistent with the rest of the story.  What minor flaws the film may contain can be easily overlooked in light of Zellweger's memorable performance, and the fact that it proffers an emotionally complex and involving experience, especially for the discerning viewer.",987724800,3,4481,4.922974767596282
961061,2,6305051089,"There was a lot more potential here than surfaced. The cast is generally good, with Rene Zellweger fresh off the success of Jerry Maguire and Julianna Margulies (ER) playing a strict and incredibly... cruel and judgmental Jewish woman. The story focuses on the Hasidic Jewish community and the new bride, played by Zellweger. Her husband is studying to become a rabbi and is so engrossed in those studies that their relationship suffers. The relationship also suffers because Zellweger's character is different. She needs something more than just marriage and motherhood to sustain her. She has her own opinions and needs and desires, and she eventually asserts them (after giving birth to a son) as a jewelry appraiser. Her father had been a jeweler (or perhaps he was also an appraiser), and she had a definite gift for this vocation. Her brother-in-law sets her up in the business and even gives her an office, but all conditional upon her engaging in a sexual affair with him, which she does, although not willingly. He will also be her ruin. When she takes an interest in a struggling artist and jewelry designer (I am not sure who he was, and this is when the story starts down a path that really went on too long and did not fit the spirit of the picture) the brother-in-law tells the rest of the family that Zellweger is having an affair with this artist. While the film is far from being perfect, Zellweger does a good job here in a role that is completely not something one would expect from her.",982368000,3,1506,4.686792452830189
961062,5,6305051089,"""A Price Above Rubies"" is a masterpiece. Zellweger gives an ethereal, yearning, performance as a frustrated housewife who feels trapped by her husband's religiosity, and her place in the Hassidic society. The film is poetic and will make you think. This movie has it all-passion, entertainment, and is never predictable. I especially liked the ending.",982281600,,351,5.4
961063,2,6305051089,"There are plenty of better movies from Amazon than  this one!  I had heard that this movie was an indictment against Hasidic Jewish males and the way their society treats women.  Instead the Jewish males in this movie were really good people and were trying to be patient with this woman and all her selfish ""needs"".  I'm afraid she was not a  very sympathetic character.  She married a man she did not intend to be a real wife to.  She belonged to a religion she did not intend to practice.  She brought a sweet little son into the world only to abandon him.  She would not nurse him and could not bear his cries.  She then brought a Hispanic  young male into her life only to abandon him too. She used people like kleenex, including her brother in law she was sleeping with to keep her beloved job.  A real bad movie and bad main character. My wife agrees with my review completely!",981504000,5,884,4.355828220858895

I will be purchasing this for myself on a DVD soon ...,959990400,2,357,4.014285714285714
961065,3,6305051089,"The title comes from the biblical quotation about a virtuous woman whose worth is above the price of rubies.  The filmmaker himself says the film is about the power of female sexuality and this is the dominant theme  throughout the film.
The movie has some structural faults, most notably  an attempt to be surreal. And so there are some scenes and characters with  other-worldly characteristics as well as intrusions of ghosts.  I wish the  movie spent all its time in the real world though, because it certainly is  a good story.
Yes, it's set in an orthodox community.  Yes, there are  some unique aspects to the way of life of the people.  Yes, the way of life  seems overly restrictive, especially for women.
I loved the character of  Sonia, a young wife of a Chassidic scholar who yearns for sexual  fulfillment.  She's feisty, smart, and is capable of even the most subtle  emotions with one look on her face.
The minor characters are all  interesting, from her sister-in-law who jokes with her about not being  ""chicken"" about her son's circumcision, to the rebbe's wife, who  plays a small and important role as the plot twists in an unexpected way.  Alan Payne plays the dark skinned Puerto Rican man with sensitive restraint  and the cast is full of types not usually depicted on the screen.
There  were parts of the movie I thought were just silly.  There were parts that  I would have like to see changed.  But there were real tears dripping down  my face in some of the more moving scenes.  And I found myself totally  immersed in Sonia's world.  She's a character I won't soon forget.",952819200,5,1599,4.654676258992806
7882212,5,6305051089,Chose this movie from a list of films given by my professor in a women's studies course I am taking in college. The class is on Women and Judaism. This film was a pretty accurate description of the things I have learned so far this semester. It helped that I learned these things before watching the film because otherwise I probably would have had a completely different perspective on the life of Sonya and the Jewish community.
