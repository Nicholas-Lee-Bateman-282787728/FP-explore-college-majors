4499675,4,B004YJMQDW,"They're good movies for their time. Next best Batman movies behind The Dark Knight Trilogy but that being said, there is quite the margin between the two. It's not like it's a close second but in comparison with all other Batman movies, these are the next best.",1380672000,,261,4.574468085106383
4499676,5,B004YJMQDW,"If you like the classic batman movie of the 80s and 90s then this is your movie. Tim Burton assembled a great group of famous actors like: Micheal Keaton, Jack Nicholson, Danny DeVeto, Christopher Walken, & Michelle Pfeiffer. Tim Burton makes this caped crusader very well. These movie are very much an late 80s and early 90s genre from the graphics but the story and action are what make this movie. DeVeto and Jack Nicholson in their respective movies provide a great batman villain. They have a mix of chaos, humor, and action all rolled into one.
This movie is suggested to anyone that like Tim Burton films and the Batman series.",1358380800,4,634,4.669642857142857

8448367,5,B004YJMQDW,"it was a challenging choice sticking to my budget when I was choosing between this double feature of Batman and Batman Returns or The Dark knight (all three good movies)at my job for just five dollars. However, I went ahead with this double feature because I feel lucky to admit that I previously  already had the chance to enjoy seeing the Dark knight at Valencia Community College (in Orlando florida) during the autumn 2009 period. The Dark knight movie was selected as a film choice for a movie/pizza party for Valencia Community College students.  I chose to purchase Batman and Batman Returns for just five dollars at my job because of the double feature for five dollars and it had been a while longer since I had the chance to see both of these movies (I was 8.5 years old when the first Batman was released).  The First Batman deals with the Batman Character having to deal with evil while shielding the woman he loves dearly from harm. Jack Nicholson, Michael Keaton, and kim Basinger are listed on the front of the dvd to be a part of the first batman. Meanwhile, Batman Returns stars Michael Keaton, Danny Devito, and michelle Pfeiffer.  Jack nicholsons joker character and Michael keatons batman character are two of the images featured on the back of the dvd.  Both movies are listed to include production notes and subtitle language options in French, English, and Spanish.",1420675200,,1388,4.766666666666667
