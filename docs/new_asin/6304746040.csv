This hollow movie took only the title and three characters and changed the whole story, adding, of course, new characters. With new story and new people in it why not call it SALON GUAYAQUIL, or SALON CALCUTTA...?

Mara Rojo is Mercedes, and she looks like she cleans after the prostitutes, not like one of them. There's no sister here, now she has a daughter, Laurita (Tiar Scanda), she also has a friend LA JAIBITA (Edith Gonzlez) and a love rival called LA ALMENDRITA (Blanca Guerra)... God! Who came up with those names? Cri-Cr?

Alberto Estrella es Paco, and he had to be naked (like he does in ALL HIS MOVIES). He goes to bed with Mercedes, ALMENDRITA, then with JAIBITA (totally gratuitous  nude scenes here).

Policeman Lupe Salazar is Manuel Ojeda and the Inspector (new character) is Demin Bichir. AAHHHH! Now I get it! This is the sequel... starts where the original left off. This is not a spoiler because by this time EVERYONE WHO IS WATCHING THIS MOVIE SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE ORIGINAL, otherwise, there's no point. Right? Why step into the unknown blindfolded? We need the reference!
OK. So Mercedes and Paco are dead and now we have to find the reason and who did it. Maybe they kill one another? Maybe ALMENDRITA kill them? She had motives.

The more I saw this movie the more I disliked it, regardless the ''homage'' to Indio Fernndez, who as a character appears briefly as a judge in the danzn contest, and Mr Aaron Copland (Steven Brown), who created the musical composition with the same name, in which the first movie is based, SALON MEXICO.

If you can skip this one, do it, is not worth your time...",1316908800,,1717,4.576547231270358
7877446,5,6304746040,"This 1995 film is a remake of the 1949 ""Salon Mexico"" directed by Emilio Fernndez, which I have not seen yet. The direction by Jos Luis Garcia Agaraz, the glorious cinematography by Carlos Marcovich, the late '30's sets, the use of color...it's all a sumptuous visual treat, so much so that at times one can get caught up in the look of it, and get lost in the film.

The plot starts out with a double murder, and then in flashbacks and from different points of view, the story is told...but as the back of the video box states, no one ever knows what exactly has happened, only how it has affected the lives of those around the murdered couple.

The cast is gorgeous, and superb. Maria Rojo, Blanca Guerra, Demian Bichir, Edith Gonzalez, and Alberto Estrella are all great, but Manuel Ojeda is brilliant. He'll break your heart with his declaration of love to ""Mercedes"" (Rojo), a scene so exquisitely written and acted, you'll want to see it again and again.

The composer Aaron Copland, (wonderfully played by Steven Brown) is part of the characters, as a regular at the club, who plays the piano there and is composing ""El Salon Mexico"" as the story unfolds.

Anyone who knows me, knows I adore a good ending. This one made me gasp when I first saw it, with the joy of seeing something so inventive, with so much beauty, style, and character. It's set to Copland's orchestral ""El Salon Mexico"", and completes this fabulous film making one feel satisfied with having spent 110 minutes with a work of art.",982022400,3,1507,4.591078066914498
