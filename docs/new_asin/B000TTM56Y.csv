8210910,5,B000TTM56Y,"I was looking for one video:  ""Something to be Proud of"" by Montgomery Gentry, which was on this DVD.  The disc cost me one cent plus shipping so for the price it is awesome.  I then discovered there were other videos that were also very good.  I either did not put the names to who they were, or had not been familiar with their work (my wife is more of a country buff and she knew them all).  Quality was good.",1308268800,3,412,4.037037037037037
