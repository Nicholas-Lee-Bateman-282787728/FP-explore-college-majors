8585668,5,B00CS8VO9S,I recommend reading The Plane Truth for Golfers by Jim Hardy or viewing the DVDs before viewing this DVD.  Jim does a great job explaining pitching and chipping.  I am developing more feel for distance using this technique than others.  Distance has always been a major pitching problem for me. So I highly recommend this DVD along with The Plane Truth.,1495411200,,353,4.754098360655738
