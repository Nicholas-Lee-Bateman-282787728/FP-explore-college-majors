309432,5,6300989003,"This film is one of my all-time favorite comedies. If you want a great laugh, this is the movie to watch some night, with the comic geniuses Steve Martin and the late John Candy.  The only reason why it is rated R is for  one scene of the f word repeated about seven times (which is kind of funny)  but that is about it.  If you fast forward that part, this is a classic  comedy for the whole family.",912816000,,400,4.012658227848101

Also, the page lists this as the ""Anniversary Edition"" which is not what I received either.  It seems to be the regular original version.

Classic movie involving one guy who is just unlucky every which way he turns, and another guy who seems to land on his feet somehow but is about as irritating as it's possible for one person to be. One to watch.",1508630400,,528,4.217821782178218

A true odd couple, two men trying to get home before Thanksgiving and everything stands in their way from weather to engine failure to limitations on travel to themselves. Del Griffith(Candy) is at the heart of Neal Page's(Martin) plight, but these two have such good chemistry that you hope they never get home! OK maybe you do.

Then I noticed that we were watching the ""Those Aren't Pillows"" Edition.  We're guessing the ""pillows"" are Steve Martin's buttocks, but it's left to the imagination.

In spite of the repulsiveness, vulgarity, andbrief nudity, my wife still found this film very heartwarming and somewhat appropriate for Thanksgiving.

For those of you who missed that memo, or forgot about it, the trip depicted in this film is of Steve Martin's character going home for Thanksgiving.  SPOILER ALERT:  Steve Martin's character arrives late, and takes John Candy's character with him.",1478131200,,690,5.2272727272727275

311676,5,6300989003,"In this clever remake of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" (James Stewart), Steve Martin (Neal Page) portrays a man (who has lost his way), followed by the annoying angel Del Griffith (John Candy). This annoying angel (Del Griffith) helps Neal Page find his way home for Thanksgiving (instead of Christmas - It's A Wonderful Life"".  But on the way, way out of the way, this annoying angel helps (""Azariah"" or ""Abednego"" - see Book of Tobit) Neal Page to find his way to a more ""Wonderful Life"".  Photo is of the archangel Raphael (going incognito as Azariah) as he accompanies Tobias to find his wife. Tobias is almost swallowed by a big fish.

The humor started off OK, but descended into childish slapstick very quickly.  The emotional ""lesson"" of this movie was one-dimensional and formulaic.  And what's up with the wife character?  She seems to be disproportionally and melodramatically upset about her husband not being able to get home for Thanksgiving because of winter weather?  Um, you live in Chicago.  If there's some sort of backstory that we're supposed to know, then the writers and directors did a very poor job of communicating it.",1462492800,,646,5.2745098039215685

As I watch this movie, I can't help but wonder how much better it would be for the East and Midwest to have a bullet train system that runs underground or above-ground. And now we have smartphones to keep us in touch with our family and friends...it's like living in the wilderness in this movie, haha :)  Wonderful performances by all, especially the backwoods country bumpkin who spat tobacco and did that ""aackk"" convulsion....wondering if it's neurological? Funny, but in a morbid way.  The anxieties of travel during inclement weather makes for a great backdrop in this superbly performed comedy.",1453075200,,762,4.984251968503937

313223,5,6300989003,"This review is for fans of this film looking for other similar Holiday comedy movies by John Hughes.

Now if You Loved This Movie, Then Watch ""The Out of Towner's"" (1999) starring Steve Martin & Goldie Hawn.
This John Hughes film, is a truly underrated feel-good gem.

However, the reviews for ""The Out of Towner's"" are poor, which is baffling.
I highly recommend you watch it & decide for yourself w/o having any expectations.

""The Out of Towner's"" appears to be somewhat of a Holiday theme.  Warning: Don't compare ""The Out of Towner's (1999) version with the original 1970. They're totally different takes.

Please let me know if you appreciate this review clicking yes. Thanks!",1448582400,,682,4.895652173913043

313303,4,6300989003,"There are lots of ways that Hollywood has played the male-bonding buddy film from the deep fog into the mist alliance to fight the bad guys of World War II Rick of Ricks American Caf&eacute; (played by Humphrey Bogart in fine fettle) and the seemingly corrupt policeman (played by Claude Rains) in the classic Casablanca to the over the cliff bravado of Butch (played by Paul Newman) and Sundance (played by Robert Redford) in the classic cowboy film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. In the film under review we get a comedic, cloud puff sent-up of the genre when dead pan comic Steve Martin joins up with over-the-top maniacal John Candy in Planes, Trains and Automobiles. And while their performances and the plotline of the story will not have future auteurs cribbing from the film it was a film that provided more than a few chuckles in this quarter.

Heres the mix. Take everybodys, well, everybody in modern societys fear of not being able to get home for the holidays, or just get home in one piece if you are depending on modern transportation, modern transportation that has gone berserk all at one time add in two very different guys, Neal (played by Martin) a by the book straight arrow executive and Del a salesman (played by Candy) a cukoo bird loose cannon of a guy who if you saw such a character in real life you would run from, run very fast the other way. But here is the dilemma Neal is trying to get from a useless conference in New York to sweet home Chicago for Thanksgiving. Now even under the best of circumstances getting home for that holiday is a dicey matter, a matter that according the numerous horror stories I have heard from others and a couple of my own is fraught with peril even with all the breaks.

What happens when you are connected (via a stolen cab grab by Del) to that cuckoo bird for the duration. Through hassles getting to the airport, through flights delays, through the dreaded snowed-in OHare Airport and you are switched off to Wichita with no motel in sight, your best laid plan to take the train turns to ashes when the damn thing conks out, and your rented automobile turns into a heap of rubble all because you are tied by some mythical umbilical cord to a genuine mad man who is barely sane. Turn yourself into Bellevue? Not a bad idea but wrong. No, you learn through adversary that here was your long lost buddy. See what I mean about Hollywood and the male-bonding genre.",1444521600,,2432,4.537585421412301

The others I can think of are Tommy Boy and Due Date, but this one tops them both.  Martin and Candy are just excellent in their roles and this one, like just about any John Hughes movie, is a heart-warmer in every sense of the word.  I really cannot recommend this one enough.  And there is very little profanity in this one, except for one scene where the profanity is used, but is so hilarious, it's hard to see anyone being turned off by it.

313464,5,6300989003,"Ive been going through my queue of movies thats been building up for years. Ive finally started catching up on older classics from the 80s, and of the ones Ive seen, this one right here is my favorite so far. To be completely honest, Ive only seen one movie of Steve Martins, and one movie of John Candys before Planes, Trains & Automobiles. I thought they were both great, but for whatever reason, I never got around to seeing their other work. This is another one of those movies where pretty much everyone on the planet has seen it by this point except a small handful, or younger people, so theres not much new I can say about it. Still, I think anyone who appreciates comedy will find something great here. It may not be the first movie to do the mix-matched duo thing, but Planes, Trains & Automobiles manages to do it with both a perfect combo of comedy and humanity.

Neal Page is your typical business guy. We meet him during a long, boring meeting where an executive is trying to decide on which ad to use, and times wasting away. Neal needs to make his flight soon to be with his family on Thanksgiving. When the meetings finally out, he only has a little bit of time to make it. Finding a cab is nearly impossible, and when he manages to pay someone to use the one they were going to use, it turns out that someone else got in while Neal was busy. He gets a glimpse of the guy before the cab speeds away. After he finally makes it to the airport, Neal meets the guy who took the cab- Del Griffith. Hes a regular buddy-buddy, friendly, talkative guypretty much the opposite of Neal as far as we can tell. When they board the plane, they end up sitting next to each other too, and its no fun for Neal. Before you know it, the plane has to make an emergency landing due to a severe storm, and the two are stuck sharing a room together. How much of this can Neal take?

Take one look at the movies box art and youll have a good idea of how the characters are. Neal and Del definitely have an Ernie and Bert thing going on. Neal is very precise and used to being on schedule, while Del goes with the flow and is seemingly care free. The best example of this is when they share a room together and Neal looks over the bathroom after Dels been in there. Everythings a mess, and somehow, every towel except the tiny one most people use to dry their hands, has been used. I won't spoil what happens after they leave, but the motel really is just the tip of the iceberg for these two. Most of us whove been in a similar situation with having an annoying person next to us on the bus or plane couldn't dream of being stuck with them somewhere else, over and over again, especially when you're trying to get somewhere and something keeps preventing you from getting there.

There were a lot of moments where I laughed out loud while watching this movie, but what really got me was how the characters were written when they weren't being angry or goofy. Neal and Del are both very real characters that have some moments where you can really feel for them. Being away from your kids school concerts or holiday plays, being away from home because you're out trying to make sales, getting chewed out for being yourself when you feel like you aren't doing anything wrong, it may sound basic (and I guess it is), but when these occasions popped up, it didn't take me out of the movie or feel forced. The films resolution was actually very nice, and had the movie been made today, im sure it wouldve been taken in a completely different direction.

I don't have anything bad to say here. Even the soundtrack, which I guess some critics have had issues with, was catchy to me. Theres one reoccurring piece that sounds a lot like the old I like to eat, eat, eat apples and bananas song you sing as a kid, just done on a keyboard. And John Candy does a good job of playing the dashboard like a piano to Ray Charles Mess Around at one point, as bad of a time as it may be to do so. Definitely check this one out if you havent.",1435622400,2,4015,4.2650918635170605

314085,5,6300989003,"This is a zany madcap chase in the tradition of Hollywood.  However, the chase is among two men trying to wrangle any means of getting home during a blizzard when normal modes of transportation are down, like flights, etc.  Steve Martin and John Candy play total opposites whose life path crosses at one point, forcing an uneasy alliance.
The plot is incredibly simple: Steve Martin and John Candy have to get home for the holidays when a blizzard arises, shutting down all scheduled air travel and overstresses the alternatives, like rail, etc.
The movie sort of starts a race between the two men, with no-holds-barred.  We get to see the limits of human tolerance while traveling, putting up with airline delays and cancellations, railroad problems, and the normal headaches we all experience just driving in the winter wilderness.
What makes this more than a formulaic Hollywood comedy is the genius of John Hughes.  Instead of leaving us with some empty laughs, the film 'pays off' with a wonderful and unexpected ending which I won't ruin for you.  We finally understand some of the craziness of the John Candy character and, in so doing, understand ourselves a bit better.  Truth be told, the movie is a wonderful little trap: we think of ourselves as the Steve Martin character (rich, successful, attractive) whereas many of us are a little...or a lot...closer to the John Candy character.  The revelation is another subtle plus for this little film...",1416355200,2,1459,4.954918032786885

314373,5,6300989003,"I first watched this soon after it's initial release on VHS, this is probably the best comedy performance from both actors and I still watch it to this day from time to time.

Story wise it's a good one, Neal Page (Steve Martin) is at a business meeting in New York, but has to return home for Thanksgiving in Chicago. What follows is a disaster travel wise for Neil as everything starts to go wrong. He runs into Del Griffith (John Candy) who is a travelling salesman, and the two actors work wonders on the screen bouncing off each other with their routines.

Neil ends up stuck with Del on his journey home to Chicago and disasters continue with flight problems, a train that breaks down, even their attempts to hire a car go horribly wrong. Script is excellent, and both actors delivery superb performances Neil as the super stressed out executive, Del as the kind hearted but ultimately doomed salesman who reaps even more problems on Neil during their travels.

There are some great comedy moments here, including a classic scene in the hire car where Del manages to get himself caught on the seat, unable to control the car. The burnt out car driving along being stopped by the highway patrol. The Motel scene where both men wake up in the same bed cuddling each other is another gem, one of many brilliant moments during the film.

I like the ending myself which conveys some humanity and compassion, despite their arguments and fighting both men have a heart and I found it a nice way to end the film. Direction is good, script is excellent and a solid supporting cast too (look out for a young Kevin Bacon at the start of the film racing to a taxi against Neal). There are also some great songs used too such as ""Mess Around"" by Ray Charles.

Looking back on comedies over the years it's hard to find many better ones (possibly Naked Gun deserves a mention for comedy spoof greatness) It's a real shame the untimely death of John Candy in 1994 at just 43 years old has left us wonder what other gems might have been in store later down the road. But we have a really stand out comedy to enjoy here and one that despite the 80's feel still holds up very well all these years later. A must have for anyone who wants a high end comedy for their collection.",1404604800,,2263,4.443373493975904

314410,4,6300989003,"John Hughes defined the eighties through his hyperrealistic portrayals of teenagers and their first-world woes. More importantly, he dissected stereotypes and got to the heart of human interaction. In Planes, Trains, & Automobiles, he creates yet another story of an odd couple brought together by fate and circumstance. It's essentially a fun road trip story with touches of John Hughes-style heart that balances out to be a memorable minor classic. The main issue with the movie is its pretty extreme tonal shifts between slapstick comedy and deep and introspective monologuing. Hughes has handled these tone changes with more grace in the past (The Breakfast Club) and some of the more touching moments are awkwardly sandwiched between scenes of road trip mayhem. Perhaps this is nitpicking, as the film is still a pleasant success, almost wholly due to the great pairing of Steve Martin and John Candy. They're both such lovable actors and they pull off the odd-couple schtick better than almost anyone. Overall, Planes, Trains, and Automobiles is not Hughes' best, it's not his worst, but it falls into fair and enjoyable middle ground.",1402358400,2,1141,5.206521739130435

314647,5,6300989003,"I would like to offer something more substantive than how much I love this movie or how I watch it every Thanksgiving as other reviewers have offered. This John Hughes directed, produced, and written film is a far departure from many of the alleged comedies that grace the movie theatres these days that rely on gross out humor, sexual innuendo amped up to ten, or situations that are stretched to wildly fantastic levels of absurdity. Planes, Trains and Automobiles is an old school comedy with a message about finding friendship in unexpected places.

Neil Page (Steve Martin) plays an uptight advertising executive trying to get home to his family in Chicago for Thanksgiving. Pages plans and attitude changes when he meets the loveable, if somewhat grating shower curtain ring salesman Del Griffith (John Candy). Through a series of spectacular incidents, the polar opposites become bonded together as they make their way throughout the Midwest in an effort to get Neil home for  Thanksgiving.

Beyond having two comedy masters in Candy and Martin and the grand vision of John Hughes, Planes, Trains, and Automobiles succeeds in my view because the situation is highly realistic---I mean who hasn't had a trip that hasn't gone according to plan? The viewer feels like he could be one of these characters either the desperate to get home Neil Page who wants time with his family or Del Griffith who is desperate for a friend or in a broader sense a home.",1389312000,10,1457,4.914634146341464

As a traveler I especially appreciated the situations shown here and can identify with cancelled flights and other problems encountered along the way.  Of course bad luck is stacked on bad luck here as each time they try a different approach, major problems erupt!

What a wasted of talent in John Candy.  He truly had the gift of timing and a range of facial features that made it enjoyable to watch.  I always like movies with Steve Martin but, how stupid and stressed can you get in one trip.  This gave us a much needed time to relax and enjoy laughter with the family.",1388188800,,453,4.160919540229885

John Huges did some really fabulous movies in this time directing. I bought this for my 13 yr old son this Christmas.... I try to buy him ""old school"" movies from  the 80's every time I can.

The brilliance here comes from absolutely outstanding writing (by John Hughes who also directed) and nuanced performances on both Steve Martin's and the late great John Candy's parts.  Both Martin and Candy are so extraordinary in their delivery, it is a pleasure to see them ply their craft living so convincingly inside those characters.

There is an industry phrase that says ""acting is reacting"" and this world class comedy twosome proves it in every single scene, playing off each other, constantly colliding their wits, and essentially becoming enemies and friends at the same time.  You are going to remember these unique performances forever.  There is really no other movie quite like Planes, Trains, and Automobiles.",1387756800,,908,5.053691275167785

John Candy and Steve Martin are at their absolute best in this funny tale of two men who end up travelling together, trying to make it home in time for Thanksgiving.

Funny, touching, sad, memorable...this one (except for a bit of swearing) is a movie the whole family can enjoy. And learn from too. It's not often that comedies also have some wisdom to share and leave us with. This movie certainly does.

The music is great too! And the one scene waking up in the hotel room all ""snug and cozy"" is priceless!!!

He's got no one, and he has been hoping Neil will help him the entire time. All Dell wants is companionship/friendship, since he lost everything.  It's not the funniest movie ever, but in my opinion on of the saddest ever.  It is so twisted it makes Donnie Darko look straight-up.",1387324800,,414,4.337662337662338

For anyone who has ever had to endure the vagaries of travel at any time of the year, much less the holidays, this will ring true as a perfect example of Murphy's Law. A stolen taxi, a missed flight, a malfunctioning train, a misdirected flight, a missing rental car, a robbery, a burnout, a car fire, and ""those aren't pillows"" -- the indignities keep piling up for Steve Martin's Neal Page. And as good as Martin is -- and he is hilarious as the self-important ad man trying to get home for Thanksgiving -- the film really belongs to the late John Candy, whose multi-layered performance as a hail-fellow-well-met slob of a shower-curtain-ring salesman with a heart of gold will wring a tear as well as a chuckle.

John Candy is always funny, and Steve Martin played the role of the ""straight man"" well in the comedic situations.
A big reason for my downgraded star rating is the buffering that happened when I watched this via streaming video on Amazon Prime.

The movie is about these two poor souls being thrown together two days before Thanksgiving.  The two face numerous obstacles, foul weather, a bevy of colorful characters,  delays, transportation troubles and each other as they race to get Page home to Chicago for Thanksgiving.

315510,4,6300989003,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles 4 stars

This is a 1987 holiday John Hughs comedy movie.  I remember seeing this at the drive through theaters with my family.  We had an old big van.  They would be able to get my younger sisters in for free and I'd hide in the back seat with the blankets.  I remember thinking the movie strange and a little boring.  But that's the opinion of an 11 year old.

Now I think it's a good holiday comedy, although a bit long.  Really great acting by Steve Martin and John Candy.  Lots of funny parts though, like the time when John drives the car between the two trucks... or the time when Steve is sitting on the broken car seat...

""Neal: As much fun as I've had on this little journey, I'm sure one day I'll look back on it and laugh.
Del: [giggles] Are you sure?
Neal: [starts chuckling] Oh God. I'm laughing already.""

315610,4,6300989003,"This is one of the few Thanksgiving movies out there.  If it weren't for one extended scene where the f-word is repeated about 20 times, it would be a great family movie.  If you can catch it on edited TV to watch with the kids, that might be better.  Of course we watched this with our 9 year old.  Oh well.  He's pretty much heard it all by now anyway.  Sad but true.  I probably wasn't any different in 4th grade.

Well, the movie is a terrific slapstick comedy.  One of John Candy's best.  Bad weather keeps Ad Exec Steve Martin from getting home to his family for Thanksgiving.  He ends up getting stuck with sloppy, non-stop-talker, salesman John Candy for a road trip involving planes, trains, cars, trucks, semis, and walking to get back to Chicago.  There is one scene that I remember rolling around on the floor laughing when I saw it at the theater in 1988 (as I was a grad student and had no money, we were at the nearly empty second run dollar movie).  The boy did the same when we watched it last weekend.  Has a few slow parts, but the funny scenes easily make up for those.  A throw back to the Abbott and Costello/Crosby and Hope buddy movies and it is as fun and silly as those.  And it does end well.

This wouldn't seem like a family Thanksgiving movie, but if you can get passed the few scenes with lotsa F-words, not much violence, and no nudity, this may become a Thanksgiving time movie favorite.

315745,5,6300989003,"How can so much go wrong on a straightforward trip from New York to Chicago? Join Steve Martin and John Candy in ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" to find out. Neal Page (Martin) is in a New York business meeting two days before Thanksgiving. His trip to Chicago looks like a breeze. Catch the 6:00 PM plane to O'Hare and arrive in time to be home by nine. Except that it doesn't work out like that. First, he meets Del Griffith (Candy) in the airport and recognizes him as the same fellow who stepped in front of him into the cab he hailed in Manhattan. Del profusely apologizes and begins treating Neal like an old friend. Next, his flight to Chicago is delayed and then, when a snowstorm closes OHare, is diverted to Wichita.

The fun is just beginning, as Neal and Del have every misadventure possible getting to Chicago for Thanksgiving. The locomotive on the train out of Wichita becomes disabled. They are diverted to a bus, which goes only as far as Saint Louis. Then there's the totally hilarious attempt to drive a rental car from St. Louis to Chicago, which includes a rather scary scene of traveling northbound in the southbound lanes of I-55. Finally, there are the two nights Neal and Del spend together in fleabag motel rooms, which are fraught with their own set of misadventures.

I have seldom had as many laughs as I had while watching ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles."" But the movie isn't just slapstick comedy. It also has its poignant moments, particularly at the end, when it is clear that Neal (who hates Del's guts at the outset) has clearly bonded with Del as a result of their shared misadventures.",1380931200,2,1624,4.635416666666667

Steve Martin, playing more of the ""straight man"" than he usually does, is cast as the impatient family man just trying to make it home for Thanksgiving. John Candy as the homeless and hap-less traveling salesman collides with Mr. Martin's character and sticks to him through out their mutual attempt to make it ""home"" for the holiday, which drives Martin's character crazy, but to their ultimate surprise, makes them unexpected friends. Through a series of calamities and detours, the two somehow build a bond, though they are not aware of it at the time. Filled with unmatched comedy, fast paced action and heart warming undertones, Martin and Candy make a perfect comedy team.

315792,5,6300989003,"Steve Martin and John Candy star in John Hughes' classic tale of holiday travel gone awry. Neal Page (Martin) is an uptight advertising executive trying to get home to Chicago for Thanksgiving.

When his flight is rerouted to Wichita, he reluctantly partners with Del Griffith (Candy), and obnoxious yet loveable salesman. Together, they embark on a cross-country adventure that includes various m odes of transportation, hilarious mishaps, and unforgettable rental car shenanigans. PLANES, TRAINS, & AUTOMOBILES is ""all comedy with a heart"" all year round.

PLAINS, TRAINS, & AUTOMOBILES even got 2 thumbs up from Siskel & Ebbert during its theatrical release on Thanksgiving weekend of 1987 and was a financial success, grossing over $49,500,000 in America on a production budget of nearly $30,000,000 and it displayed Hughes powers at their height as well as Steve Martin & John Candy in their 2 best roles.",1371772800,3,910,5.268965517241379

My husband thoroughly enjoys this movie because of the lessons Neal and Dell learn from one another so I bought it for him so he wouldn't have to watch, or fast-forward through, the commercials.  However, in the DVD, Neal says the ""F"" word several times to the lady behind the counter whom he rented a car from after he discovered that the car was not in its parking place when he was taken to pick it up.  She in turn said the ""F"" word right back to him.  Little further past that, Dell accuses Neal of playing with his balls, which is not in the TV version.  This movie could've been soooo good without those words or topics.  Then on the DVD, the ""Airplane Food"" scene was not in the movie but it is in the TV version.  So I'd rather have the TV version anytime.  The DVD will be trashed since we don't allow that ""trash"" in our home.

316126,5,6300989003,"Paying less than ten dollars for this movie should be a crime.

John Candy and Steve Martin both are at their best in this flick and the laughs never stop once they get together. I'd never been a big John Candy fan, but he plays his part in this movie to perfection and makes this a smashing hit. I'd rank this up there with the all time best comedies.

Just from the picture on the box you know what's gonna happen. John Candy is going to annoy the everliving hell out of Steve Martin. While Steve tries his best to be polite, he has to give Candy a piece of his mind from time to time and tell him like it is. Then, one way or another the two wind up getting back together out of the kindness of Steve's heart.

The basic plot is this: Steve is trying to get home to his family for Thanksgiving, but all the ordinary traveling plans fall through and he is stuck traveling with John Candy, the shower curtain ring salesman he met at the airport.

Many scenes from this movie will be stuck in my head from years to come. It's an unforgettable film. For as little as 5 dollars, you can't go wrong here.",1359417600,,1101,4.154929577464789
316127,5,6300989003,John Candy was a great actor and a kind soul. We lost a great man when he died young. I grew up as a kid watching classics like Uncle Buck and The Great Outdoors. I was never a big fan of Steve Martin but there is no denying what great chemistry Candy and Martin have. Martin does a great job here. This is a great Thanksgiving movie. I find it to be an underrated and a forgotten film. Candy shows off in this movie his great acting by showing a dramatic side to his acting. This is a must for any John Candy fan or anyone looking to add another great comedy movie to their home video library.,1359331200,,594,4.0423728813559325
316128,5,6300989003,Not much to say here. Steve Martin and John Candy show why they are comedy legends. Pick this one up and you'll be sure to never watch the untalented likes of Adam Sandler or Will Ferrell ever again.,1359244800,,199,4.2631578947368425
316129,5,6300989003,"There are only a handful of movies that I cannot ever get enough of and this movie is one of them. I remember going to see this in the theatre as a kid in the 80s. John Candy's comedy was always too funny. There really is not one thing I can say bad about this movie. Its goofy and from the beginning to the end its funny. When the end comes it just makes you feel bad for Del. A guy who has nothing but the belongings in his chest yet goes out of his way to help someone he hardly knows. U know he felt alone and when he found someone he clicked with it brought out all these emotions and goofy jokes. When he is sitting int he burned car outside the motel as its snowing he speaks to his dead wife saying he is the most annoying person. He knew he went too far.

With Del's personality in the movie he changed Neal's outlook on life and on people in general. He no longer looked down on people. In many ways he disliked Del but couldn't see going on without him and they kept running back into each other. its in many ways a movie about how fate takes over in life. In the movie Del would sell shower curtains in any way he could. He did what he could to make ends meet. He never judged people and because of his strong character he changed Neal's outlook on people. I would have to say that sometimes I put this movie on just to see the end. Where he tells Neal he doesn't have a home and his wife has been dead for 8 years. The comedy goes away and the seriousness of the movie comes in. Neal after all their travels made a new friend. You could see it before they split at the train station that he was a bit adamant about leaving Del because it was truly an adventure for them both. For me the ending could have simply been Neal and Del walking up to his front door with them carrying the chest and end with credits. That to me was really the heart of the movie at the end. the only thing im wondering is at the end when Del says, ""Hello Mrs Page"" they focus on his hands where he is wearing one red glove and holding his hat. maybe i missed someone thing simple there but im sure the foreshadow to that tidbit is something pertaining to the beginning of the movie.

Truly one of my favorite movies for the holidays or any day as I am a single person who lives on the road working for rock bands. In many ways the title relates to me simply because i do live my life in Planes, Trains and Automobiles.....",1359158400,,2411,4.031315240083507

316165,5,6300989003,"I am a huge fan of all things comedy, and all things Steve Martin, and this movie is a pinacle not only for Steve but also for the genre in general. From a joke standpoint, this movie is hilarious. I find myself quoting random lines all the time (generally to people who have never seen it ;/), and the jokes simply don't get old. The great part about the humor here that separates it from modern comedies in my opinion is that while it definitely contains its fair share of crude or dirty jokes, the writers did not rely on these. They employed a wide range of comedy, and both Steve Martin and John Candy are able to deliver the laughs through a mixture of spoken and physical humor. For me, the best part of the movie is the fact that, while it is totally improbable that all of these things would EVER go wrong together, the film never feels fake or unrealistic. You begin to care about the characters and their plight, and this is really the genius of John Hughes. I know that comedy is not everyone's cup of tea, but if you enjoy a laugh look no further than this movie.

Covering the story of two strangers trying to get home it is amazing how much can and does go wrong for them with Steve Martin on the receiving end of most of it with John Candy being the cause of a lot of it even though it is generally unintentional.

With a slight twist at the end, it is not only a funny film it also gets quite emotional as they reach their destination.",1357084800,2,543,4.065420560747664

316335,4,6300989003,"I watched this 1987 flick for the first time today. Maybe it's because it was made 25 years ago and I personally have little memories of the 80s (or the decade before that), everything in the film seems corny, including the part where Del reveals what's up with his wife Marie! But the two actors do a fantatic job acting their respective parts, and the film turns out bigger than the sum of its parts! I liked the movie, to my own surprise. And it helps that it brings back memories of both NY and Chicago back in the 80s. How I miss those days, no cell phones, no in-flight entertainment, just people, even if rude people.",1356048000,,624,4.3418803418803416

In fact, it is our family tradition to watch ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" every Thanksgiving evening.  During the first decade of this tradition, the viewing was ""G-rated"" and accompanied by popcorn.  During the second decade (now that the children are adults), the viewing has evolved into a brandy and cigar event.  Of course, by the second showing of ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" Steve Martin and John Candy are even more hysterical.  Our favorite scene is the one with an irate Steve Martin and the smiling, matronly worker at the car rental booth at the airport.

If you've just stuffed yourself with Thanksgiving dinner you may want to wait a few hours before watching to avoid digestive problems from laughing too hard.  Don't let the R rating scare you away, this comes from a single F-bomb scene which is hilarious and integral to the plot.  If you're watching with children or otherwise sensitive to the f-word just hit the mute button when Steve Martin walks up to the car rental counter.

One of the better quality  Blu-Rays I've seen. I can't comment on the audio too much as I listen with external speakers hooked up to my stereo. Sounded fine to me  !!!

316761,4,6300989003,"This is, I believe, one of John Candy's better films he's starred in. Same goes for Steve Martin. Absolutely hilarious film about a traveling marketing agent (Martin) who starts out in NY City during a business meeting and has to get home to Chicago in time for his family's Thanksgiving dinner. Along the way, he keeps getting detoured to different parts of the country via plane, train, and automobile (as well as other means of transportation) by none other than Del Griffith (Candy). At the beginning of the movie, he meets Del Griffith, the shower curtain ring salesman who is a slob in both dress and manner, and who unintentionally keeps messing up Martin's plans on getting back to Chicago. Many will know this movie by its popular phrase ""those aren't pillows!"" Absolutely funny movie.

The reason I gave this a 4/5 stars is due to the one scene where Martin drops the F bomb about 18 times in under a minute, expressing his misfortune to the car rental woman. I believe that if this film didn't have that scene, it would only be rated PG-13 instead of R. Other than that, there's no sexual scenes (unless you count the scene where a young couple is smooching violently on the bus for a few seconds) and so I think this movie is pretty decent if you know where to 'fast forward'. There are other mildly crude words spoken by Candy and Martin, but it's not so dirty that it's every other sentence. Overall, this movie has quite a charming story that ends pretty slow paced, but wraps up nicely with Martin and Candy resolving their differences by being kind to each other and being sincere about it. Great music, funny comedy, and loveable characters, this is one film you'll want to watch every Thanksgiving.",1331510400,,1717,4.6480263157894735

316806,2,6300989003,"My best friend is obsessed with this movie.  He thinks it's the funniest comedy ever made and he is always telling me that I NEED to see this because I will love it.  Needless to say, my expectations were extremely high when I settled in to see this.

Wow, was I disappointed.

Basic premise here is that an uptight workaholic struggling to get home for the holidays finds himself strapped to the back of an obnoxious oaf who happens to downright ruin his every plan and makes a giant dent in his heavily structured life.  From the taxi to the plane to the train to the house, Neal's trip home is altered drastically by Del.  Del is needy and chatty and boorish and kind of gross.  Neal is stubborn and irritable and a tad selfish.

They make a perfect couple.

The problem with `Planes, Trains and Automobiles' is that it is either too obvious in its attempts at humor or too reserved.  The fact remains that they set this up to be an uproarious comedy of opposites destroying each other's lives (the obvious part) but they don't push the envelope near as much as they needed to in order to make this really work.  The believability is tainted by the overt differences in the two people (when Del comments to God about how he finally found someone who's company he enjoys I was rolling my eyes at the stupidity of that particular comment since there is NO WAY that either of them enjoys a fraction of their time together) and so the ending `ah-ha' moment on the subway feels forced and kind of pathetic.  On top of that though, the humor is really hit or miss.  A lot of viewers obviously love this, and they make comments about the jokes not overstaying their welcome, but I think that is mainly because the majority of the jokes don't hit like intended.

This is very dated.

I noted to my wife that this film is funnier in snapshots that in running time.  I mean, there are images presented here that really crack me up, but as a whole those sequences don't illicit that lasting laughs you want them to.

The chemistry between Candy and Martin (two extraordinary comedians) saves this movie in many spots, but even they are not at the top of their games.  They play total clich&eacute;s and don't really dissect those characters to create something deeper.

Oh, and the intense finale, complete with weeping, was ridiculous.",1327968000,3,2328,4.539568345323741

John Hughes, John Candy and Steve Martin all come together to make a movie that will have you laughing, quoting and perhaps even crying.  This is a comedy with a heart.  It is set around thanksgiving and has that holiday quality to it but it never gets too cheesy.  The Those aren`t pillows edition has some really great extra features for fans of the movie.  John Candy`s death was a great loss to the world of comedy.  If you have seen Due Date you can probably watch this movie and see how much Due Date owes Planes Trains and Automobiles.  It would have been great if this edition had a commentary but since Hughes and Candy are sadly no longer with us it would have had to be Steve Martin or somebody who would have had to do it.  That could have been interesting to hear.  The extra features are short but worth it to a fan I think, although I would not pay too much extra for these features.",1327968000,,986,4.258064516129032

316931,5,6300989003,"For me, Planes, Trains, and Automobiles is the kind of movie that once I see it, I can't forget about it. Something about it that you can't put your finger on makes it stay with you.

That in itself is probably an amazing feat because, when you really think about it, the plot can be boiled down to a very simple premise. That is a man trying to get home for Thanksgiving.

Steve Martin plays Neal Page, an uptight ad exec working in New York. It's Thanksgiving and Neal wants to get to Chicago to be with his family. Along the way he meets a loveable but seemingly annoying traveling shower ring curtain salesman, Del Griffith played by John Candy.

The movie could be described as a comedy of errors or possibly a road trip film. Everything that goes wrong does, usually to Neal and because of Del, from delayed planes to cars catching on fire. Initially, Neal tries his best to rid himself of Del, who he considers an annoying bother. However, over the movie, the two begin to bond and become good friends ultimately ending with Del's sad revelation of the truth he's kept hidden from Neal and the audience the whole time.

The movie does have a lot of heart to it and I think this is one thing that makes it so memorable. And then there's the ending. I think one of my favorite movie endings ever is how this one ends. In the context of John Candy's sad passing just a few years later, I find it to be even more sad and heartwarming at the same time.

Off the top of my head, I feel certain I would rank this as one of John Hughes' top three best movies.",1296259200,3,1558,4.2677966101694915

There is no new input from Steve Martin & the tributes to John Candy & John Hughes are simply tacked on as afterthoughts. Also there is one deleted scene, but many will have seen these on television (where it has been reintegrated in the film).

316970,5,6300989003,"Steve Martin plays Neil Page, a tightly wound, stressed out, overworked, and frustrated businessman who wants nothing more than to return to his loving family for Thanksgiving. Unfortunately, nature, vehicles, and all of the people around him seem to be working against him. Everything that could possibly go wrong goes wrong, and his trip turns into a disaster plagued journey full of misfortune. To make matters worse, he continues to run into an overly cheerful, overly talkative, and overly optimistic salesman named Del Griffith (played by John Candy) who does his mood no favors and who ends up slowly turning his stressful trip into a living nightmare.

I know that this film is considered by many to be the most mature film by John Hughes, god rest his soul. I will admit that I find the films of John Hughes to be overrated. Sure, I enjoyed Uncle Buck quite a bit, and I can at least appreciate what Sixteen Candles and Ferris Bueller's Day Off says about teen culture in the 1980s. However, I can't say that I really got all that involved in what was going on in them. Maybe it's because I'm not an 80s kid. Maybe I just can't get involved in films that feature that kind of look and atmosphere. I consider The Breakfast Club to be a brilliant film in a lot of ways, but other than that there isn't too much I'm impressed with in terms of his directorial body of work. If you want to talk about the films he's produced, such as Dennis the Menace, Home Alone 3, and Just Visiting, well, that's another story altogether. Despite all of this, however, I'm just going to go ahead and say that I think Planes, Trains, and Automobiles is perhaps the greatest comedy ever made. It is a film filled with remarkable honesty, serious destruction, bizarre poignancy, and tremendous depth. It is a film that dares to step outside the comfort level of comedy, several times, and still has the strength and the integrity to remain consistently fresh and startling. This is a film that demonstrates, above all, the need for human companionship, the unspoken bond between strangers, and the unselfish desires in all of us. This is a film that is not only filled with big big BIG laughs, but also full of terrible heartbreak. The heartbreak in this film, however, does not come out of tragedy. The heartbreak comes out of the underlying fear of being alone, or worse yet, angering someone you really care about. Above all, however, this is just a really good Thanksgiving film.

One of the most powerful things about the film is John Candy, whose character is beautiful in a lot of ways not necessarily noticeable. He may be crude, naive, loud, and he may take up too much space almost all the time, but his intentions are incredibly pure and his selflessness is pretty damn infectious. The difference, however, between this loudmouth and any other loudmouth in a typical comedy is that Del Griffith is not stupid. He knows early on in the film that he annoys Neil. However, he does not let this change the way he feels toward Neil Page and, while his feelings are obviously hurt when he learns this, he takes this advantage to learn more about this man so that he can help him. Sure, he may do more harm than good much of the time, but that never changes the fact that he still has his best interests in mind. This buddy comedy is different in that both of the buddies have real feelings.
I think that it is safe to say that this is one of Steve Martin's most subtle roles as he is normally more into the physical comedy than the situational. However, this character who he plays who is a complete jerk is also never unsympathetic. Hughes manages to do this by editing scenes of his family at home eagerly awaiting his arrival. As a result of this, Hughes manages to create some rather unusual suspense for a comedy picture, and this helps bring a more emotional undercurrent to the picture that I found and still find very refreshing. What really blows this film out of the water, however, is the final act of the film in which the comedy and the heartbreak is upped by about ten times as much. We not only see Steve Martin at his most realistically maniacal, but we also are rewarded with a conclusion that is so brilliant, so shocking, so human, and so sad that I dare not give it away. I warn you, however, make sure that you have a box of tissues beside you when you watch this because if you have a big heart you will cry at the end of this film and you will cry hard. This is the kind of film that really makes you fee thankful for your family, your friends, and your loved ones. I think that, to me, that's what makes it such a powerful film.

This film has always meant a lot to me, even as a child, and I think that it's one of the best family films in existence. What makes it work especially, however, is it's universal emotion. These characters are so mismatched and so dysfunctional that we feel almost privileged to go on this bizarre journey with them. Few films make me feel this way. If there are any real complaints to have about the film, I suppose that it'd be the soundtrack. While I personally have no problems with it, I have noticed that many critics do. The thing is, it's typical 80s synth pop music. While I can't say that I'm a fan, I personally didn't feel that it took anything away from the film whatsoever. I know that John Hughes loves using 80s music, so if you're seriously complaining about an 80s synch pop soundtrack in a John Hughes film then you may as well make that same complaint for all of his films. The thing is, this is the kind of film that doesn't need a special or good sounding soundtrack to work. All it needs is music that fits the tone for the appropriate scene, and the music in this does just that. So really, complaining about the soundtrack here is a stretch in itself. Above all, this is just a terrific film. It is a film that makes me miss John Candy more than I already do, but even moreso it's just a great film with an exhilarating emotional theme that makes the humor seem all the more real. This is one of the most emotional comedies I've seen, and overall it's just one of the greatest films ever made.

317012,5,6300989003,"""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" is a truly unique, and hilarious viewing experience.  The entire film fuels the comedic needs of the audience by supplying enough variety in the punchlines and enough tension and build up to lead to truly hysterical moments rarely seen in films.  Prior to this film, Steve Martin already had a very established and recognizable name within the comedy genre of films with movies such as ""Little Shop of Horrors"" and ""The Man With Two Brains"" already under his belt.  The late, great, John Candy, a legend for the comedy world, also was entering this film riding the success of several past films, including ""Spaceballs"", ""Little Shop of Horrors"" and ""The Blues Brothers"".  The two actors truly shine in ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" and their chemistry in the film is truly outstanding.

The movie begins by showing Neal Page (Steve Martin) in a New York office, awaiting the final decision from his boss regarding a cover shot for an advertisement at the advertising company in which he works at.  With every passing second, Neal is becoming more and more frustrated, since he is already running late for his flight back to Chicago to meet his family for Thanksgiving weekend.  When he's finally free from his job, he begins his mad rush to the airport, having to fight the crowds of the crowded New York streets, and fight fellow civilians for the few free cabs that are roaming the streets.  Upon getting to a cab, just in time, he is forced to buy the cab from the man currently occupying it.  During their negotiations with one another, another man (John Candy) takes it upon himself to steal the cab and leave.

Out of money that he used to pay for the cab that he didn't even get, Neal is more frustrated than before.  He arrives at the airport to find out that the man who stole his cab, Del Griffith (John Candy) is going to be on the same flight as him.  Neal's luck gets worse, since he ends up sitting next to Del on the flight, leaving him to put up with Del's constant talking throughout the trip.  Their flight touches down in Wichita, and cannot fly to Chicago until the snow blizzard there clears up, leaving Neal stranded at the airport.  He agrees to stay with Del at a local hotel, a decision he later regrets.

The rest of the film focuses around the bad luck that the two men face trying to get back to Chicago.  From a train breaking down on the tracks, to not being able to find a rental car, driving the wrong way on the interstate, and blowing up a car, Neal and Del go through the worst case scenarios in some of the worst circumstances a traveler could possibly face.  Despite their constant fighting, and blaming of one another for the misfortunes they are experiencing, Neal and Del eventually bond and realize that in order to get to Chicago, the two men must put their differences aside and work with one another no matter what.

The film features many hilarious scenes, including the hotel scene where Steve Martin and John Candy awake from an awkward spooning session.  Steve Martin's reaction to the rent-a-car employee is sure to provide some laughs, and the entire highway scene is one of the stand out scenes of the entire film.  The deleted scene that focuses around the flight on the airplane is worth checking out, and adds its own spark of hilarity to the film.

""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" is a film that will please fans of classic comedy movies, and fans of the comedy genre in general.  Anyone who enjoys either Steve Martin or John Candy is doing themselves a huge injustice by not viewing this film.  The interaction between the two actors is what truly makes this film enjoyable, and it still stands to this day as one of the greatest films that either man was ever in.",1283558400,,3758,4.60960960960961

317048,5,6300989003,"When I first saw this movie about twenty years ago, I was just knocked out by how perfect it was, with the very funny Steve Martin and the late great John Candy getting the most out of John Hughes's brilliant script.
Hughes was very clever in writing a script that had so much humor wrapped around an incredibly touching core story, because those brief moments of seriousness are all the more powerful.
The story in brief is that Steve Martin (character name Neil Page) has been working away from home for an extended period and runs into an endless string of transportation woes trying to return to his home in the Chicago area.
He incidentally runs into John Candy (character name Dell Griffith), a gregarious, annoying, chatty traveling salesman.
Did I mention that Dell seems to have a hint of loneliness about him?
Dell joins Neil by trying to help him in his quest to get back home, but all manner of problems arise, such as foul weather diverting their flight, train breakdowns, and (funniest of all) a missing rental car.
Watch for the very funny Edie McClurq in the famous scene with that missing rental car.
Neil would rather ditch the annoying Dell and go it alone, but somehow he winds up in all manner of incredibly funny situations with him, including the one that gave this special edition its name that is honestly one of the funniest in film history.
As I said, this is a comedy, but there are some serious moments that are only enhanced by the humor, including the one near the end that I consider the climax of the story.
I won't spoil it for you, but it is the main reason that I look at this as something so much more than a funny movie.
You'll laugh, and (yes, corny, I know) you'll cry, and you won't mind doing it, either.
This movie is just THAT good.
An interesting personal observation I have is that - just as with the movie ""The Shawshank Redemption"" - all the people I know of who have seen it love it.
I have yet to hear from anyone who did not like it.

I also wanted to briefly detail the extra features this has over the stock and stripped down original DVD release.
First, the original release only had the movie and the trailer...nothing else.
This special edition has some extra features, including:

1) Getting There is Half the Fun: The Story of Planes Trains and Automobiles - a very nice interview with Candy, Martin, and John Hughes about the making of the movie, plus some of the cast and crew talking about the entire process.

2) Deleted Scene - ""Airplane Food"" - This one runs for about five minutes, and it has some humor, but I can definitely see why they chose to edit it out for the finished product. I still enjoyed it for the bit of extra interplay between Martin and Candy.

3) John Hughes for Adults - a very good tribute to director/writer John Hughes

4) A Tribute to John Candy - MAJOR kudos to the DVD producers for adding this moving tip of the hat to the real star of this movie. Even now, the casting directors nearly choke up on camera talking about his incredible performance, especially that key scene I mentioned above.

Also, this is mixed in full Dolby Digital 5.1 sound, so the airplanes passing Steve Martin as he stomps down the runway really sound terrific, among other things.
The only thing really missing from this is a commentary track, but since Candy and Hughes are now both deceased, the chances for that are very remote indeed.
Considering how glad I was to have the tributes to both men, I happily trade the commentary for the recognition of both for their great talent.
Anyone who has not seen this movie before really owes it to himself (or herself) to buy this one, since you will want to watch this over again through the years; it is just that good.
Anyone who has already seen it would do well to get this version, as it will probably be definitive until a Blu-Ray comes out.

317050,3,6300989003,"Plains,Trains and Automobiles(released Nov/87)starring Steve Martin and John Candy,is one of the late John Hughe's biggest successes on the screen. It is also one of the late John Candy's best films. John Hughes had a great feel in the 80s for teen speak and angst with such films as Pretty in Pink,16 Candles and The Breakfast Club,which established the now famous brat pack to his audiences. But I don't believe his forte was in comedy per se. His ideas in that regard stemmed less from situations but more in your face and exaggerated sight gags;that is less subtlety,more outrageousness. However there is no denying the then box office appeal of this movie and his others such as from the National Lampoon series.
This film involves the story of one Neal Page(Steve Martin) as a businessman who is anxious to leave NYC on a business there and get home to Chicago before Thanksgiving. He is hindered by a slow moving client(played wonderfully by William Windom-he also can be seen in the closing moments of the film,post credits)who stares and stares at Martin's presentation for what seems forever. When Page finally gets to leave he hails a cab and has a competing run down with Kevin Bacon(in a cameo role)and loses that. When he finally manages to get a cab it is surreptitiously scooped up by one Del Griffith(John Candy).It is not a good day so far and things are looking down from here for;three long days in fact.
Page finally manages to get on his flight and who sits beside him,but Mr Griffith who is a non stop annoyance to Page. Page learns,among other things whether he likes it or not,Griffith is a shower curtain hook salesman who is also going home to his wife. Along the way the flight is diverted to Wichita,Kansas due to a storm and Page and Griffith end up together once again. Griffith offers to ""pull some strings"" and they land in a motel. Not only does Page get stuck with the cab fare but he has to foot the motel bill;one room,one queen size bed. The two get into heated discussions and finally get to sleep. That night a thief steals all of Pages money and in the morning the two are closerthanthis in bed. This DVD isn't called ""Those aren't pillows"" edition for no reason!
The next day Griffith suggests taking the train to the Windy City but passenger trains don't run from Wichita,they go out of Stubbville. Del calls in another ""favour"" and the two get a ride there in the back of an open flat bed truck by a couple out of ""Deliverance"";freezing all the way. Once on the train and are home free,the train breaks down and they are forced to hike to a bus. On the bus Del suggests a sing a long. Page's suggestion doesn't register as well as Del's of The Flintstone theme.
Page and Griffith finally arrive in St Louis where Page suggests they part. Page makes arrangements for a rental car at the airport and when he is dropped off in the huge rental lot(seemingly miles away from the airport and left there)his car is not to be found. Walking back to the airport he's in a foul mood when he confronts a startled clerk,but no car is forthcoming as he tossed away his rental agreement at the lot. Outside he gets shoved onto the pavement by a parking concierge and almost gets run over by....Griffith who magically is driving a rental car!
The two agree to share the driving chores and Page takes the first watch as they speed back to Chicago. When its' Del's turn he falls asleep at the wheel,loses a cigarette in the back seat,ends up going the wrong way on the highway and while trying to take his coat off almost gets them killed. As they are standing outside the car retrieving Del's suitcase the cigarette finally causes the car to catch on fire and explode. Miraculously the now blackened hulk is still drivable and they manage to get to a motel. Page isn't speaking to Griffith but part way through the night he takes pity on a freezing Del sitting in the ""car"" and lets him inside.
Through adversity the two have now somehow bonded but the next day the pair are pulled over on the highway for speeding. Why? The speedometer is burned out,and the car is then impounded because it is ridiculously unsafe. Griffith again manages to get transportation,this time in the back of a trailer truck...refrigerated of course. Once in Chicago Del and Neal part ways at the El. On the train Neal starts to think back on his last three days and suddenly decides to return to the station hoping to catch Del,or at least make the effort to. To his surprise Del is still there. It seems his wife died  nine years before and he hasn't any family left to go home to. Neal takes him home with him and introduces Del to his family as they all settle in for their Thanksgiving get together.
The film was well crafted and moves along at a fair clip. The gags roll from one into another as Page's anger ebbs and flows depending on what foolishness Griffith manages to concoct. Candy manages to instill some real emotion into his characterization on the screen. Griffith may be seem like a pain in the butt ne'er do well who won't stop talking,but underneath it all he is hiding alot of pain which is the reason for the annoying outward impression. It's a ""don't judge a book by its cover"" moral but done smartly. Martin keeps his character from going too over the top which would have ruined the laughs the makers were trying for. He just stays within the boundaries and the two make a good team.
Technically the DVD has been transferred well and is presented in its widescreen format. Extras include some featurettes:A Tribute to Candy,the making of the film and one on John Hughes himself. There is also a deleted scene included.
If you like your gags on the in-your-face side,along the lines of the National Lampoon series,Porky's,et al,then you'll love this movie. It is one of Hughes best grossing films from the 80s and it will please all the fans of both Steve Martin and a man we lost all too soon,John Candy.",1272758400,2,5934,4.556179775280899

317053,5,6300989003,"This movie is one of my all-time favorites.  It has become a family tradition to watch this movie the night before Thanksgiving.  Anyone who has traveled will related to the exaggerated (yet funny) situations portrayed in the movie.  I am a Steve Martin fan, and he delivers in this movie.  I like two John Candy movies, and this is one where he fits the part perfectly.  (The other is The Great Outdoors).  Get the movie, enjoy the comedy, along with the unexpected touching moment at the end.  I don't know about the fact that they are calling this the ""Those Aren't Pillows Edition"".  Some ad man's idea of marketing 101?",1269820800,,624,4.609090909090909
317054,5,6300989003,"John Hughes wrote and directed many classic 80s films including ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", ""The Breakfast Club"", ""Sixteen Candles"" and this movie, ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles"". It's a long title to say buddy-road-trip-movie, but it works and has his distinctive tones and themes and he was recently and very deservedly honored by the Academy for his achievements.

In this film Steve Martin's character Neal is trying to get home to his family for Thanksgiving and Murphy's law is definitely in effect. All manner of bad luck happens to him, particularly his continued running into Del played by the hysterical and genuine John Candy. Hughes' greatest gift is managing to take broad comedies like these and instilling them with just enough heartfelt moments to make you care about the characters instead of writing them off as incompetent idiots. The gags are wonderfully set up, the long-running jokes killed me, and watching this movie in 2010 really brings to light all the modern conveniences of people not carrying cash anymore, having a plethora of credit cards, and the obvious benefits of cell phone usage. This is a fun movie to play who's who because of all the cameos from actors in his other movies as well as a quick taxi chase down with Kevin Bacon.

The major issue that comes to light is how inaccurate the travel times are in this movie. He tries to fly from New York to Chicago but because of bad weather, the plane lands in Kansas. ?!?!?! Of course, then he attempts taking a train that breaks down, a bus that doesn't get them far, and later a rental car. At one point his car is stopped by a sign that specifically says 100 miles to Chicago. They still stop and stay somewhere overnight and when they do continue the next day, it is estimated it will take another three hours. What were the speed limits in the 80's? Distance = rate x time, people! There is no way they would be forced to travel at 33 mph on the highway.

The other smaller issue is that you'll notice this film has an R rating which is out of character for a John Hughes movie. It's done mainly for one joke. Steve Martin in a fit of rage at a car rental calendar uses the F word every other word on his tirade against the woman who played the principal's secretary in Ferris Bueller. It is done so at the end, she can use it once deservedly against him. When you're watching it though, it seems so out of tone with the rest because they never really swear the rest of the movie and it easily could have been written without the F bombs and had an equally funny moment that wouldn't feel so jarringly out of place.

If you can manage to ignore glaring inconsistencies on the distance and travel time (and even if you can't), you will really enjoy the classic eighties background music and emphasis on a great story. This is a great buddy movie with ridiculous, yet feasibly possible circumstances that will get you right in the funny bone. There aren't many movies out there that I would consider a ""Thanksgiving"" holiday movie, but this would count.

DVD Extras:

None. This has a widescreen version, subtitles, and an interactive menu. If you want features, I'd recommend the ""Those Aren't Pillows!""

Steve Martin is no wild and crazy guy in this movie but an exasperated uptight business man with the ""perfect"" family waiting for him in their lovely suburban Chicago home.  John Candy is great as the endearingly annoying Del but his weight and cigarette smoking throughout the film struck me as sad when I remembered his premature death in real life.  And because of some real salty language this one definitely isn't for the little ones or anyone easily offended by ""certain"" words and outrageous situations.

317144,5,6300989003,"Perhaps my most watched DVD, because it continues to return laughs every time. Career-topping performances by two great comedic actors, ranging from subtle sincerity to slapstick, as they attempt to make their way home for Thanksgiving via any mode of transport available. Continually driving forward with a sweet ending. The soundtrack is dated and an unfortunate filler at times, but hardly can be said to mar this film, which was the best of 1980s screwball comedy and presents a telling image of masculinity when contrasted to the macho action films of the decade.

Other Hughes fans may dispute my review title, I'm sure. Hear me out; while Breakfast Club and Ferris Buehler may have charted new territory by addressing teenage issues with maturity and wit, this film has a timeless quality to its treatment of the road/buddy film and will continue to endure as a Holiday classic.

The scene is classic, if you like the movie already and haven't got a chance to catch this scene, you need to.

I don't care about extra features, I usually don't watch them more than once, if that, so my rating is for the movie and the added scene ... finally.",1253750400,16,562,4.045045045045045

While the end of the movie gets far too sappy for my tastes, the rest of it is classic, with or without the famous cut scene (dinner on the plane). It would also be fun to have the alternate scene at the car rental counter (the one with PG language for TV airing).

Given that John Hughes recently died, I would hope they can add some kind of appreciation on this release. Ideally (but unrealistically) I would love to hear a commentary with Martin where he could add some insights on both Hughes as well as his costar, the late, great John Candy.

317148,5,6300989003,"Well first I will tell you the movie plot then i will share my three cents about what i think about the film.

Movie Plot: Steve Martin plays the tightly wound Neal Page, a bundle-of-nerves advertising executive. John Candy portrays the innocent and well-meaning, but accident-prone and somewhat feckless, Del Griffith (Director of Sales, American Light and Fixture, Shower Curtain Ring Division), a shower curtain ring salesman who seems to live in a world governed by a different set of rules from those governing Neal Page's marketing life.

The movie follows the story of Neal Page as he tries to return to his family for Thanksgiving in Chicago after being on a business trip in New York. The journey is doomed from the outset, with Del Griffith interfering by inadvertently snatching the taxi cab that Page had hailed for himself. The two inevitably pair up later and begin an absurdly error-prone adventure to help Page get back to his home. Their flight from JFK Airport to O'Hare is diverted to Wichita due to a blizzard in Chicago, which ends up dissipating only a few hours after touchdown in Kansas. When every mode of transport (including a train and a rental car) fails them, what should have been a 1 hour and 45 minute New York-to-Chicago flight turns into a three-day adventure.

Neal frequently blows up at Del, blaming him for much of their misfortunes. Del in turn regards Neal as pretentious and uptight, while Del is less afraid to be himself. After much heated argument between the two men, a bond between them forms, and Neal finally manages to overcome his self-centeredness and both men pull together to finally make their way home.

Under the assumption that Del has a wife and family of his own (he frequently mentions his wife Marie and puts a framed picture of her on his various motel nightstands), Neal is taken aback when he later pieces together things Del said to realize that Del is alone. He goes back to the train station where he had left Del and sees Del sitting alone, inside an empty station, after they finally make it back to Chicago. Del tells Neal that Marie actually died eight years ago and that he's been homeless ever since. The bond between the two men strengthens further when Neal invites him into his home for Thanksgiving.

Now My Three Cents: The Movie was amazing it has comedy and at the last 8 mins of the film john candy is homeless and steve martian takes him in and so they enter the front door with the family to greet them and this is the part that just plane hart warming John Candy smiles into the camera and man when he does that you smile,feel warm-hearted,and have a lot of tears runing down you're face. I have watched over 5,900 films in my life and this was the only film that made me feel three things 1:smile,2:warm-hearted,3:Teary Eyed just that part makes this film to be one of the greatest film ever made. I think you could show this to anyone over the age of 10 because there is only a part in the film where Steve Martin uses the f word 15 times in a row because he had to walk all the way to the rental car place which was a long walk. This part can be fast forward if little kids are in the room. Over all a great family movie that shouldn't be missed but i hate to bring up the ending but if you ever feel made watch that part it will not make you mad but teary eyed and make you forget why you're made. But as I degress if you like to feel emotions in movies or just want to have a laugh you will want this movie in you'r collection or if you're starting one also.",1250467200,,3548,4.443932411674347

So let's put aside criticisms of the DVD production and talk about the movie.

I first watched this movie when I was in my 40s. At a much later time I watched it with my teenage son.  I then watched it again and after 3 viewings it is still a wonderful entertainment.

But it is more than that.  John Candy was, as usual, brilliant.  There have been very few screen actors since Groucho Marx, Charlie Chaplin, and Buster Keaton, who had Candy's natural comedic gifts.  And Steve Matin was pretty wonderful also.

However, the movie is more than a slapstick (in the best sense of the word)comedy;  there is genuine pathos in this film and Candy's portrayal of a man desperately searching for a real human connection is extremely moving.  Those of you who were disappointed in your first viewing, see it again and see if you can keep your eyes dry when Martin arrives home for Thanksgiving dinner.",1245974400,,1027,4.562841530054645

Martin and Candy are stuck without plane rides home and wind up trying all modes of transportation to reach their destination. Both run into unbelievable obstacles, most of them the fault of Candy, who drives Martin almost insane. Candy was the funnier of the two in this story but both comedians were at the top of their game here. Too bad there was so much profanity for a film that could have been enjoyed by everyone in the family.  Yet, some it is understandable, especially with Martin's character. Candy's character would have made anyone swear! And.....Martin's profane tirade with the rental car woman at the airport is hilarious.

317173,4,6300989003,"I wasn't sure how to review this one, so let's just say it was a bit of a chore.  I have seen the gags and this film many times and yet it retains the charm i've always loved about it.  Much cleaner than today's ""toilet humor"" films (which gross me no end, by the way but I digress), at the very least the former Saturday Night Live guys let us sneak a peak in the life of Steve's character, a introverted businessman who only has one passion: his wife and kids.  His frustration with the airport, with the taxi (surprise appearance by Kevin (the goblin) Bacon) and one thing after another that we travellers can relate to, at first he resents, hates, and then comes to admire (and somewhat smarmy sympathize) with Candy's character, a curtain ring salesman who, despite major losses in his life latches onto Steve and won't let him go.

Of course the funniest scenes (the ""pillow"" incident and the f**king rental car girl) make it an R rating for the Thanksgiving dinner relatives who may drop by and want a sneak peak.

Enjoyable, but definitely not for the whole family.

Undeniably Steve Martin and John Candy are at their hilarious best, but it's probably the latter that will have you pondering this movie long after the credits roll. I come back to it every year at Thanksgiving time - it is a very worthy addition to the many great Christmas season classics that follow.

Unfortunately he meets a terrible curse upon him and that curse is a blabber-mouthed fat salesman named Dell Griffth (John Candy) whom will cause Neal nothing but trouble and misery for two days before Thanksgiven. Even though their flight has been cancelled due to bad weather, they now go on a cross-country trip back to Chicago even if it's painful to Neal.

A hilarious and never-a-dull-moment comedy from John Hughes who was fresh off his successful teen comedies like ""Sixteen Candles"" and ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" has done a great R-rated comedy. Even though it's rated ""R"" for some mild profanity with 16 uses of the ""F"" word, it can still be enjoyed by the family and the performances are superb including the original screenplay. There's even appearences by Kevin Bacon and Ben Stein and memorable moments such as the laugh out loud scene of ""Those aren't Pillows"" including some heart to go along with it.

The DVD has a good transfer and nice sound but there's no extras, hopefully someday we'll get a special edition DVD or Blu-Ray. I strongly recommend this movie to everyone even to the Thanksgiven holidays.",1226361600,,1279,4.8090909090909095

It's not a family film, so it is definitely not something you'll want to watch with small children present. The theatrical version contains some language which might be objectionable to viewers of any age.

The story itself is very basic -- there's nothing complex to remember. It's simply a story of a man trying to get home in time for Thanksgiving dinner, only to have every transportation option work against him. The twist is that he teams up with a complete stranger in their quest to get to where they need to be. It's in this vain that the unfortunate but often hilarious events take place. The comedy in this film runs from a chuckle to side-splitting laughter. Things are often taken to the extremes, but in an odd way, it all seems logical.

The story is heart-touching in the end. Again, there's nothing complicated about the ending or how the film gets there. In all honesty -- ""you're along for the ride"". It's simple, endearing, and the message is something to which anybody can relate.

317210,2,6300989003,"First of all, the two stars I've given here are based solely on the dvd itself, NOT the movie. I LOVE the movie but this supposedly new dvd treatment is nothing to get excited about.

'Planes, Trains and Automobiles' is just one of many 80's movies from Paramount Studios that have supposedly been rereleased as 2-Disc special editions this month. (August 2008) These are basically just repackaged dvds with some new cover designs intended to tie-in with vH1's 'I love the 80's' merchandising and the second 'disc' is really just a bonus audio music cd of popular 80's singles with all of a whopping 4 tracks on the disc. The movie does have some newly enhanced audio and an alledged deleted scene somewhere within the movie according to the back cover but I never noticed anything strikingly different from the original version.

This 'I love the 80's' movie series from Paramount rereleases are fine if all you're after is just the movie itself. But just don't expect anything different or new and if you're hoping for a two-disc MOVIE special edition loaded with all kinds of extra features like I was, you might be a little ticked off. My advice is that it's probably best to just skip these and wait for some REAL special editions of these films if there ever are any in the works.

Paramount can do better and it's clear they didn't put any real thought or care into these releases.",1218931200,25,1388,4.6571428571428575
317211,4,6300989003,"Like other reviewers have said the Amazon review of this film is at best misleading. All films are subjective, but this is much better than their reviewer makes out IMO. Its consistently funny, with Steve Martin delivering one of his best performances. Indeed without Martin it would have been merely an average film. He takes it to another level. This is not to say that John Candy is bad, he isn't, but Steve Martin is the reason to see the film.

Essentially its a string of comedic set pieces, the train, the Motel, the car etc. Each of these have great moments, perhaps none better than the Motel where they find they have to share a bed. Theres also a lovely joke in the back of a flat bed truck with a dog in very cold weather.

My only criticism is the 80's music, which to fair I didn't like in the 80's! This has dated badly now. I also have mixed feelings about the ending as well. A little bit too soppy for my liking.

Overall though a fine movie with excellent performances, many laugh out loud moments, and a film that you can watch many times without being bored by it (mainly because of Steve Martin).",1212451200,,1118,4.365384615384615
317212,5,6300989003,"Sorry - usually I ""live and let live"" ... and I agree that all should have and express their own opinion - but c'mon, Amazon! Where did you dig up this Marshall Fine, who provides your official review on this product?

I don't get it - did his medication not kick in before writing this review? I am trying not to out-and-out attack him in text ... but it ain't easy!

On the subject of this movie - he is WAY off. Please IGNORE AMAZON'S OFFICIAL REVIEW and read the comments of the ""rank and file"" who have seen the movie. You will see a solid wall of people who reject Mr. Fine's interpretation of this film. Or just look at the Average Customer Review!

I consider my tastes in humor very refined. First of all, I am not a big fan of ""toilet humor"". And even though this film sometimes dips slightly in that direction, it remains one of my favorite comedies of all time.

Martin is at his stuffy best and Candy at his socially inept best. The two of them, forced to interact, provide some of the funniest moments ever set to film. As far as buddy pics go, only Lemmon and Matthau did it better.

I can't say I really appreciated alot of stuff that John Candy did. I thought it was very lowbrow and repetitive, derivative of better stuff from the likes of John Belushi (and even lesser stuff from Chris Farley).

However, in this film, he just blew me away! He shows talents in this movie that i wish I had seen more of, including several unexpected and satisfying turns into solid drama. We've seen this overbearing oaf character of his before --- but this time around, you will actually sympathize with that character.

Plus - this must be said - the last five minutes of this movie is so exquisitely performed and edited and scored ... that it NEVER fails to turn me (a burly forty-something man) into a happily slobbering mess. A shocking secret is laid bare with just a few words --- and everything that has come before it is given a new light.

If the last few minutes of this movie doesn't at least bring a lump to your throat - sorry, but you have no soul. :) It is one of the finest and most satisfying movie endings OF ALL TIME - in my book, it ranks right up there with Spielberg or Capra at their best.

The final freeze-frame of this movie is burned indelibly into my brain. I will never forget what a solid talent John Candy could be from this one shot alone. I cannot look at it without tearing up.

I realize I'm probably coming off as over-passionate about this ... but PLEASE IGNORE MR. FINE'S REVIEW! Buy this movie as a solid addition to your comedy collection, or at least rent it elsewhere. I promise, you will not be disappointed!

PARENTAL ADVISORY: Believe it or not, despite the R rating, it is a great family film! However, when you see Steve Martin throw his suitcase to the ground in the airport parking lot and stomp his way back to the car rental place ... um, turn the sound down for the following scene ... or clear the kids out of the room.

What follows is pretty much the ONLY reason the movie carries an ""R"" rating. Martin drops the F-bomb about 15 times in a single tirade. It is a hilarious scene and well-justified, but it must have been a difficult and courageous decision to include this scene, since cutting it out would've automatically given this movie a PG rating. With the sole exception of this scene, the rest of the movie is surprisingly family-friendly.

317216,5,6300989003,"Being a child from the eighties I can't help but keep relating to this movie over and over (I'm now ex-military and currently work in the airline industry). I saw this movie when I was a junior in high school, having watched other John Hughes' movies such as Breakfast Club. I always liked Hughes movies for being heartwarming and sort of guiding during my teenage years. I'm sure a lot of people my age will also agree. I had grown very fond of John Candy since I saw him on ""Stripes"" and absolutely loved Steve Martin's ""Ruprick"" in Dirty Rotten Scoundrels. I knew that the public was headed out for one hilarious experience when these powerful comedians where casted together. Was I ever right, there are scenes in this movie that still cause me to start laughing just thinking about it. It's funny because I find myself travelling constantly through these cities and I can still see poor Neal Page racing Kevin Bacon for a cab in downtown Manhattan only to trip on Candy's trunk. I've been past the ""Braidwood Inn"" where Neal and Del shared ""their pillows"" together. This movie sure hits it with people that travel for a living, matter of fact it is a permanent addition to my ""suitcase DVD collection"". Obviously it is a John Hughes film and he finds a way to keep the movie humane and heartwarming even with the dozens and dozens of hilarious scenes. The ""photoshop pause"" ending focusing on the late John Candy's face as well as in Uncle Buck sure served as a sad premonition to his very early passing. Planes, Trains and Automobiles is not just an excellent timeless comedy but a legacy to the great work by this great actor.

John certainly had a way of portraying himself in his characters as he repeatedly mentioned that he refused to loose weight fearing it would affect the public's perception of his characters. I could never imagine someone like Del Griffith looking any other way.

There are a couple of interesting things worth mentioning about this movie:

1. On one of Neal's phone calls to his wife she is lying in bed watching TV. From hearing the TV you can tell she's watching the movie ""She's having a baby"", also from John Hughes and released AFTER Planes, Trains...was released to theaters.

2. Neal's house in the end of the movie is the exact same location used for Bill Murray's ""Bed and Breakfast"" stay in the movie ""Groundhog Day"", notice the building exterior and the shot down the street in both films.

3. The ""Braidwood Inn"" hotel is located actually in Braidwood, Illinois not Wichita.

4. On the final scene driving the burned car Neal and Del are supposed to be driving from St. Louis to Chicago, yet they are pulled over by a Wisconsin State Trooper (???)

Again, Planes, Trains and Automobiles is an excellent comedy which will have Hughes fans constantly travelling back in time and everybody else finding themselves a having a great hillarious day.",1199836800,,2890,4.68836291913215

If they had used some other word other than the ""f"" word, then this could have easily made an excellent PG-13 movie.  Our family watches this from time to time but I always mute the rental car counter scene.  No matter how many times I watch this, it is always funny.",1198886400,,535,4.155339805825243

Traveling is nuts though and if he's going to get home he's gonna have to rely on a talkative and clingy but good-hearted salesman (John Candy). It's predictable that he's going to keep bumping into to Candy whether he wants to or not and that they're gonna keep having to travel together whether he like it or not.

  Plus you know Candy is going to drive him more and more crazy. Yet when it tacks on a heart-warming ending and gets you to feel bad for Candy you can't help feeling like you just saw something special. I mean after driving both the viewer and Martin nuts with his antics, you can't help but want to hug the guy at the end anyway. I think Candy should've been nominated. His character means well but he's a mess up but when it's time for the touching stuff at the end it's hard not to get teared up.

Sure, the character he plays is kind of dorky, but Candy is so good, you end up liking him anyway.  Martin is a little over the top at times, but he too settles into a nice groove with his character.  There are many choice moments, such as watching Martin and Candy drive their melted car down the highway, Martin's expletive filled tirade against Edie McClurg (and Edie's great comeback line), and the ending of the film.

The plane winds up landing in Wichita, due to bad weather and all the motels are booked. But Del has a friend who owes him a favor at a motel, so Neal and Del share a motel room. Coincidences that bring these two back together happen throughout the movie, and while they're completely unrealistic...That doesn't keep this movie from being a comedic masterpiece. John Candy and Steve Martin are really at the peak of their comedic powers in this movie; The physical humor, the verbal humor, and every other kind of humor in this movie is done so well...You can't help but laugh at Candy's antics and those antics that are caused by him.

""Planes Trains and Automobiles"" is one of the best movies of the '80s, but the story and events portrayed within are timeless.  Steve Martin and John Candy (one of my all time favorites) give absolutely stellar performances, and the movie is exceptionally well written.  No description can do the interplay between Martin and Candy, or the tremendously funny things that happen to them throughout the movie any justice.  One just has to see it, not just for its comedic aspects, but for the story that takes place.  One of my personal favorite scenes, delivered only as John Candy could do it, is ""Doin' the Mess Around,"" and what it leads up to.  This phenomenal movie had me laughing hysterically, and is then rounded out with a highly satisfying ending, that stays with you and is worth thinking about.  Overall and for multiple reasons, I rank ""Planes Trains and Automobiles"" as one of my favorite movies of all time.  I would not say this about very many movies, but feel quite strongly about this one.  If you saw the movie when it came out, you will no doubt want to buy it to relive the journey and own a great classic.

Of course there are plenty of funny scenes, but if you are familiar with Hughes's films, you will know that he often includes moments of poignancy. One of my favorite scenes is the first night they are forced to sleep together in a one-bed hotel room in Wichita. As the blabbermouth Del (Candy) loudly clears his sinuses before going to sleep, Neil (Martin) just cannot take it anymore so he bursts out of bed and goes off on a rant about how annoying Del is and does not understand why anyone would want to hear any of his incredibly boring stories. Looking at Del's expression as Neil verbally clobbers him one can tell how he is hurt by Neil's insults, and the background music suits the mood of the scene well. I found it to be a powerful scene, even the first time watching it as a little kid it really remained in my memory. The following morning provides a great transition back to comedy with the classic ""Those aren't pillows!!"" scene. Many other classic comedy scenes leading up to a touching ending result in one great movie worth watching every Thanksgiving.",1148774400,,1242,4.451754385964913

I watched this movie recently with a very old, dear friend of mine, down in my hometown of Weed, California.  I was thoroughly impressed with the acting skills of Mr. Steve Martin.  He really is a comedic genius, one of the best!

Anybody with a sense of humor will not be disappointed in this movie.

317328,5,6300989003,Great JOhn Candy Movie. Up there with UNCLE BUCK. STeve Martin and JOhn Candy were a perfect pair!,1141603200,2,98,4.5
317329,4,6300989003,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles was a clever movie.  It combined Steve Martin's comic skills with John Candie's lovable attiude.  Thanksgiving is always a blast with this movie, every year.

The movie starts off with Neal Page,(Martin)out of town, and how miserable his life seems to be.  When Page is trying to get to the airport during rush hour, he meets a stranger, (Kevin Bacon, one of my favorite actors) viewing him across the street in New York.  They rush for the same cab, eying each other the whole way, until Page trips and falls, leaving the stranger open to get the cab.  I won't tell you any more, but that particular scene always leaves me chuckling.

To talk about the rating is quite easy.  The language used in Planes, Trains and Automobiles should be kept away from children younger than 16 or 17.  The ""F"" word is used about twenty times in one sequence by Steve Martin.  I myself dislike the scene, and that is why my rating falls to a 4 star.  It is the only flaw, and without this scene, I'm positive the movie would have been rated PG.  This movie is obviously not for kids.  Parents: be cautioned.

By the end of the movie, you will be teary-eyed.  The sad ending recovers the sense of a pointless comedy, and without it, I would have given it 3 stars.  There are some points where the movie falls.  The comedy scenes that usually involve Candy and Martin and are all funny - yet they sometimes have the kind of corniness of ""Fun With Dick And Jane"", (a horrendous movie).  Some however, are priceless.  The scene where John Candy is lipsinking in the car is the most hilarious thing you will ever see in your lifetime.  The song is called ""The Mess-Around, and it has a good beat and melody to it.  I can relate fully to this, and many other parts in this cinama masterpiece, and I'm sure you will too.

To sum it up, Planes, Trains and Automobiles is a favorite movie of mine that I am proud to own.  The coarse language (which I normally don't mind) was far too exaderated and lost it a star.  No, this is not for kids - unless it is on television and edited.  I have watched it (on television) and there are only a few mild curses.  Planes, Trains and Automobiles will leave you with a sore gut, (from laughing so hard)immense emotion, and teary eyes; it is worth a rent or buy.

317349,4,6300989003,"A business executive, played by Steve Martin, must get from New York City back to his family in Chicago for Thanksgiving.  But just about everything that could go wrong does, making it unlikely that he will be able to get home in time. A well-meaning but somewhat obnoxious travelling salesman, played by John Candy, compounds his problems by shadowing him along the way.

One reason I was disappointed with this film was my high expectations: I've been a fan of the film's screenwriter, John Hughes, since his days writing for National Lampoon magazine in the 1970's.  I've also been a big fan of Steve Martin's brand of comedy, having most of his stand-up comedy albums.  And John Candy is probably the only comedian who could make me laugh without even saying anything.

But, while the film has it's laugh-out-loud moments (such as when Candy and Martin share a bed and end up in an accidental almost ""Brokeback"" moment), it just wasn't as funny as I would have expected.

In my opinion,the film was saved from mediocraty due to the acting of Martin and Candy, and, especially, due to the films very touching ending.  I won't spoil the film by telling you how it ends, except to say that it evokes the ending of Dicken's ""A Christmas Carol"" and should leave many viewer's misty-eyed.

John Candy's ""Mess Around"" scene is timeless, to this day, every time i hear that Ray Charles song, i think of that scene.

Candy, plays a annoying but overall nice businessman (the president of a shower curtain ring company!) and meets Martin at an airport (after stealing his cab!).

Martin plays a nice family man, who is trying to get home for the holidays, but he doesn't ave much patience and understandably takes this out on Candy. Throughout the movie, Candy wants to remain friends with Martin, although Martin makes it quite clear (as polite as he can) he dosent want a friendship with him.

However, and call me a softie but this is my favorite part of the movie, Martin then realises how much of an ""adventure"" the two have shared and decides to make friends with this annoying and sweet guy that has come into his life.

We all know a ""Del Griffith,"" an annoying extrovert who isn't so bad once you actually know him. A good guy, with an utter lack of social grace.

This film does repeat the overused ""Odd Couple"" theme, but it even outdoes the odd couple in my mind.

My favorite scenes involves ""Owen,"" the farmer who drives Neal and Del to the train station.  He informs the two that a certain train won't help them, ""lessin' you're a hog or cattle."" Just as he says this, he makes a hilarious snorting sound, clearing his sinuses? Much like an ""oink.""

To pump up the hilarity, he tells his small wife to ""git (her) lazy a$$ out here,"" so she can hoist their luggage onto the truck.

As they ride on the flatbed, the hilarity climaxes as a hillbilly mutt emerges from the hay and nips neal's hand.

Especially effective is the hilarious soundtrack... complete with manic themes and a ""blues"" harmonica.

Don't we ALL hate the headache of travel? Of course we do.

My only complaint regarding this movie is how it seems to fall apart at the end. There are no real laughs for the final five to ten minutes, and it concludes in a sentimental and sappy manner. No, I wouldn't rewrite the end... it is poignant and touching... I would just make it seem less sappy, and perhaps throw a few minor laughs in as well.

This is a fairly mild complaint, however. This comedy remains at the top of my ""favorite comedy"" list, and is much funnier than most other John Hugh's blockbusters.

317459,4,6300989003,"Film critic Roger Ebert just included this movie as one of his top favorites in his new compendium, ""The Great Movies II"", and you should certainly read his analysis to hear from a true aficionado. For me personally,  I continue to be surprised at how much I laugh when I see this movie. I thought that by now, surely the comic sight gags and the casting of Steve Martin and the late John Candy would automatically make this a candidate for a 1987 time capsule. Instead, I have to agree with Ebert and say this film has only grown over time, The laughs are still there, but so is a somewhat more dramatic undercurrent that I likely ignored the first time I saw it. Directed and written by John Hughes previously known for his teen angst comedies like ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Pretty in Pink"", it's really a classic anti-buddy picture as two mismatched individuals are thrown together and of course, suffer one bizarre misadventure after another as they try to make it home to Chicago for Thanksgiving.

Although you would think it would have more in common with Neil Simon's ""The Odd Couple"", the plot actually reminds me much more of Simon's ""The Out-of-Towners"", and anyone familiar with that film will have a good idea of what will happen to them. They spend a night in a cramped hotel room sleeping in the same bed, endure customer-indifferent rental car clerks, suffer through a series of vehicle breakdowns, and watch one of their last hopes literally go up in smoke. As persnickety salesman Neal Page, Martin seems to be on a constant simmer just ready to boil at the most inopportune times. Candy plays the obnoxious Del Griffith, a shower curtain ring salesman armed with an endless supply of dumb jokes and pointless anecdotes. That both manage to make their respective characters likeable is a testament to their appeal as comic actors. Martin is able to elicit empathy for a man uncomfortable with unpredictable circumstances. Candy goes beyond the obvious buffoon to reveal a vulnerable, lonely man made even more so by the holiday season. There is a particularly touching moment when he silently expresses his character's swelling hurt as Neal berates him for his unfunny stories. But it's really the comedy scenes that make this movie truly memorable, the best one involving Del's lip-synching of Ray Charles' ""The Mess Around"" behind the wheel of car he is driving in the wrong direction. The ending is somewhat mawkish, but it doesn't ruin a comedy that deserves to be seen again and enjoyed. Still highly recommended.",1110240000,11,2536,4.827586206896552

From his days on ""SCTV"" to his film work Candy could elicit laughs just from his presence and inner warmth even in the lamest of vehicles.  Candy had a prolific film career, that's not to say a consistent one (""Who's Harry Crumb?"",""Nothing But Trouble"").  His constant film work might have been his way for portending his early demise.  Among the dross Candy made a number of good films.  I'm still waiting for my personal favorite, ""Only the Lonely"" with Maureen O'Hara playing his mother get a DVD issue.  Fortunately for us, ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles"" is also one of his better films.  The film concerns two disparate individuals, buttoned-down family man Neil Page(Steve Martin) and shower-ring salesman Del Griffith trying to get home for Thanksgiving.  Through a series of coincidences or just Del attaching himself to Neil they end up traveling and boarding together throughout their sojourn.  There are any number of hilarious scenes(""Those aren't pillows!"").  My personal favorite has to be one where the pair, bereft of cash, attempt to barter with a motel clerk for a room.  Neil presents a valuable Swiss watch as colatteral.  Del in turn brandishes a Casio.  Alas, this is also a John Hughes film.  Despite alot of inspired comic anarchy that preceded it, Hughes injects a Norman Rockwell sentimental moment at the end.

Maybe he has this movie confused with something else because there are most certainly not any moments where there is only intermitent comedy, the comedy is there ALL the time.

I personally have not seen many better comedy movies than this and John Candy clearly demonstrated what a genius he was and could have been, sadly this will never happen.

There are so many funny moments during the course of the movie that it's probably not worth mentioning them, better to just see the movie.

One scene I will mention however and is worthy of extra merit is the scene on the highway when they're driving the wrong way, well let's just say that even after seeing this movie 20+ times I still cry with laughter by the time they've come off the highway. A bent over steering wheel and fingers embedded in the dash was just so original and truly funny like nothing ever before, very clever Mr Hughes.

They eventually get home in the end, and Dell reveals a secret to Neil at the end where the movie kind of turns from comedy to drama. Trust me you will like this movie. Definetly see it.

Steve Martin plays an uptight advertising executive who needs to take a rush flight to see his family for Thanksgiving.  He has the bad luck of being strapped to a passenger who's his exact opposite (Candy): a pesky door-to-door salesman with absolutely no tact whatsoever.  No matter how far Martin's character tries to distance himself from the uncouth yapper, he always seems to be right next to him everywhere he goes.

Another touching comedy by Steve Martin about how to find the best in people no matter how bad their feet smell.  I completely disagree with Amazon's reviewer claiming that the film was uneven and could've been funnier.  I've seen this film over 20 times and I'm hard pressed to find the imaginary defects in the screenplay or direction that the main reviewer so vehemently attacks.",1091664000,5,1029,4.982456140350878

Neil runs into Del, played by John Candy, who knows all the tricks of the trade when it comes to public transportation.  Del, in a wholehearted attempt to help Neil get home, seems to find the most inconvenient means of travel possible.  Released August 19 of 1987 by Paramount, the movie runs 93 minutes, not exactly making it a blockbuster, but definitely one of the best comedies made.

During the movie, Steve Martin is trying to get home to Chicago for Thanksgiving, but his plane lands in Kansas where he's stuck with Del Griffith (John Candy).  They do everything they can to get home, but something always goes wrong.  And you will laugh through almost the entire movie.
You've probably noticed that I gave this DVD 4 stars, and not 5.  My reason for this:  There are no special features.  It seems like Paramound is just lazy when they put out DVD's.  Almost every DVD I have that has no special features are by Paramount.  There had to be interviews with Steve Martin and John Candy when the movie was made, or do some new interviews with Steve Martin and John Hughes.  I would like to correct one reviewer about them cutting scenes from the DVD.  I assume you are talking about the funny scene on the plane when they are being served their food.

Steve Martin is Neal Page, an ad exec on a business trip who wants to fly back to Chicago so he can spend Thanksgiving with his family. Unfortunately, things that go as planned. First, he can't catch a cab. And to make matters worse, his 6:00 flight has been cancelled. While waiting for a later flight, he meets Del Griffith, an overweight blabbermouth who smokes cigarettes and sells shower curtains for a living. It seems that Neil can't escape Dell. First, he sits next to him on the plane, during which he chews his ear off before falling asleep. Soon, the plane lands in Wichita because of a snow storm in Chicago. Neil and Dell share a room together, which is disasterous. They wind up travelling across the country by car, bus and train. The laughs keep coming, and Candy steals the show.

There is a little heartstring tugging here, but not enough to bring the viewer down.

Boo!
Widescreen and 5.1 sound is great, but not even a trailer? John Hughes says there is a 3-hour cut of this film in a Paramount vault -- where is it here? Also, there are deleted scenes shown on Network Television (such as TNT) and they aren't even included here! (An extended plane scene and one in a diner, etc.)
There are so many deleted scenes in this film that could have been re-inserted under the care of John Hughes. It's so appalling that there's nothing here.
NOT EVEN A TRAILER!
What about a commentary with Steve and John Hughes? I'd buy this in a heartbeat! But for now, I'm sticking to my old VHS copy, which I have watched somewhere around 230 times. (It's getting sort of fuzzy.)

I've previously done a review for this. Looking back on it, it had to be deleted. Straight away. It was five lines long, so hopefully Amazon will repost this, hopefully, much better review. (HA!)

I have to admit, this movie is better on a second watching. I can't remember really enjoying it the first time round as I did this time. I found myself giggling a lot more, but also, maybe I was feeling really emotional that night watching this, but I also ended up crying at a couple of points. It's actually, beneath all the funny moments, a really sad movie. The scene in the motel bedroom where Steve Martin's character points out all John Candy's bad points is utterly convincing, and that's the point I did start crying. John acted it really well, with his bottom lip quivering. But his comeback just makes it all the worse:

""You wanna hurt me? Go right ahead if it makes you feel any better. I'm an easy target. Yeah, you're right, I talk too much. I also listen too much. I could be a cold-hearted cynic like you... but I don't like to hurt people's feelings. Well, you think what you want about me; I'm not changing. I like... I like me. My wife likes me. My customers like me. 'Cause I'm the real article. What you see is what you get.""

The other scene I started crying at, was when Del couldn't get a room at the motel, cos he only had $2, and a Casio watch, and he had to sit in the burnt out car. Talking to his wife who wasn't there. Yes I did cry again. It's such a sad movie.

But it's also hilarious. It's definitely one of Steve Martin's best movies, and he agrees it's his favourite movie of his own. He comes out with some absolute classic lines in this, but I'm not going to repeat them all here. If you've seen the movie, you know what they are.

Roll on Christmas is all I can say after watching this movie, and now I want to start wrapping presents. Just hope I've still got someone to wrap presents for. Hehe. I love this movie.

There's a cameo by Kevin Bacon who grabs a cab in the heavy New York City traffic. Bacon starred in SHE'S HAVING A BABY filmed around the same time as this film. Neal Page(Martin) is a marketing executive who plans to return home to Chicago for Thanksgiving. Neal grabs a cab,throwing out Del Griffith(Candy) who was about to enter the cab. Salesman Griffith and Page meet in an airport about to fly to Chicago. Massive storms forced the Chicago flight to be canceled so the two end up in Wichita,Kansas. Page and Griffith check in at the Braidwood Inn. They both take out their credit cards to pay,thus their respective cards accidentally end up in the other's wallet! Page and Griffith share a room since it was the only available room left. They sleep together,thus Page becomes annoyed by Griffith's loud snoring. Page became so angry that he impulsively got up and prepared to get dressed and leave. The pair end up in a heated argument over Griffith's behavior and imcompetence. Page's anger subsides so he undresses again and goes back to bed. Come daylight,Griffith is dreaming that he's embracing his late wife. He gently kisses Page's ear and Page is holding Griffith's hand. So Neal and Del make their plans on how to get home safely and quickly. One point in the film shows an angry Neal upset with an agent at a rent-a-car company(""YOU CAN GET ME A F---ING DATSUN,A F---ING TOYOTA,A F---ING BUICK,A F---ING MUSTANG! FOUR F---ING WHEELS AND A SEAT!"") What happens next? Del shows up in a car he's renting. Incompetent Del finishes smoking a cigarette that when he was about to toss the still-burning butt out the window,it accidentally ended up in the back seat of the car. The car becomes ablaze and even worse,Neal's wallet was in the glove compartment with his credit card back in it. All the glove compartment contents burned in the fire. Now Neal is really furious with Del. Neither had $42.50 to check in for the night at a nearby motel so Neal comes up with $17 cash and a wrist watch. The on-duty manager accepts Neal's alternate payment. When Del comes up with $2 cash and a nicer-looking watch,the manager refuses and ""says goodnight"". Del is freezing to death outside in his charred rent-a-car until Neal invites him to share his room. Come Thanksgiving Day,despite all the aggravation and struggling,Neal arrives home in Chicago safe and sound. Del is with him. Del confessed that he is homeless and lost his wife. That was why Del said in one scene,""I haven't been home in years."" His business of selling shower curtain rings is what is keeping him financially stable and clean. The end theme is ""Everytime You Go Away"" written by Daryl Hall of the rock/pop duo Hall and Oates and was a minor hit for them and later a bigger hit for Paul Young. This film was directed by John Hughes who also directed SHE'S HAVING A BABY and would later direct CURLY SUE. Listen for an audio excerpt from SHE'S HAVING A BABY.

Martin is an uptight businessman trying to get home from New York for the holidays.

One thing about the ""deleted"" scene that some are complaining about in this film.  That scene was NOT in the original theatrical release of the film.  If you've seen the film on any of the cable channels (other than CBS) you will notice that the scene is not in those versions either.  The missing scene was about 2 minutes more of Del Griffith and Neal Page on the airplane.  The footage was obviously left on the cutting room floor for the original movie and was probably left in to fill out some of the scenes that were deleted for commercial television.  At any rate, the DVD does contain all the footage of the original movie and those scenes that are in the VHS version.

It starts out with ""Neal"" played by Steve Martin getting out of a marketing meeting late in New York during rush hour he runs to catch a cab for the airport so he can spend Thanksgiving with his family. With two days to get there you figure he should be plenty early. You aren't counting obstacles like ""Del"" played by John Candy. While Neal is giving money to a lawyer to buy him out of taking a cab in front of him, Del loads his trunk in it and takes off. The meetings and journey these two have after that is one for the record books. Del does everything he can to get Neal home to his family. They must take a Plane, Pickup Truck, Train, Bus, Rental Car, Semi, and the El to make it to Neal's Chicago Home with a detour to Kansas City. Neal may miss his daughters Thanksgiving Play but he will get a life lesson from Del that is priceless. This is a great one to own on DVD.",1038441600,4,1094,4.165094339622642

Steve Martin and the late John Candy team up for nonstop, knee-slapping misadventures as two businessmen chaotically thrown together with one objective:  make it to Chicago by Thanksgiving.  Their oddyssey is punctuated by one mishap after another--most unfortunate for the characters, but utter comidic delight for the audience.  (The scene on the highway, when Martin and Candy's rental car is sandwiched between two barreling 18-wheelers, is hysterical.)
Yet director John Hughes does more than give us a side-splitting comedy; we also get a glimpse of the fragility and goodness of both characters, which makes the viewer like them all the more.

Throughout the whole thing you remain painfully aware that it's a movie, and everything looks contrived. They try too hard to be funny and it doesn't work. What it feels like is they take these two guys and put them in a variety of predicaments that are supposed to be funny and cause you to emit uproarous sounds of hilarity. Sadly, it falls far short of the goal. (About three miles in fact.) I don't think I laughed even once. The afore mentioned predicaments are not necessarily related to each other, and the order in which they are portrayed seems of no particular significance. My advice?

Hughes and Candy worked especially well together, given their track history of movies ('Uncle Buck', 'Great Outdoors', and this).

The movie has so many wonderful moments, some will drive you to cry from laughing so hard and others will simply drive you to cry from it's sentiments.  The characters go deep and mature along the way and the film actually carries a good, simple minded message that I think would apply to anyone.

The CBS television version of this movie contained a deleted scene where Neal and Del were eating an airline meal, but that is not present here.  No other deleted scenes are here either (and there had to be more than just the one that was used on television.)

317717,5,6300989003,"...but, hold the phone, wait just a minute. Am I just a sensitive sap or is there something genuinely touching at the heart of this film? Without going into specifics, the conclusion of this movie made my strong, manly eyes well up with tears and brought a sad smile to my face. There is just a point when these two men, Neil Page and Del Griffith, who all but despised each other through most of their travels together, realize how deep their friendship runs and how positively affecting the two have been on one another. From the moment at the subway station as they say good-bye up until the heartwarming ending at Neil Page's house, it is what pulls this movie out of the bottomless pit of hilarious buddy comedies and into the hallowed halls of truly great movies.
But, before all of that occurs, for most of the first hour-and-a-half this film is just plain gut-busting, slap-your-knee, and pee-in-your-pants funny. Neil Page, played by Steve Martin, is an uptight advertising executive on business in New York. As the film opens, he is late for a plane that is taking him home to Chicago so he can spend Thanksgiving with his family. From the start, things are going horribly wrong, as he finds it damn-near impossible to get a cab in the holiday traffic especially when the cab he's flagged is stolen right from under his nose by a guy in a blue parka with a HUGE suitcase. He finally gets to the airport and finds he's been bumped from first class to coach, then when he sits down he finds himself seated right next to (""Is this a coincidence or what?"") the guy who stole his cab. That guy is Del Griffith, played by John Candy, who is, um, let me clear my throat, ahem, a shower-curtain ring salesman. No, really, I'm serious. After their plane is forced to land in Kansas due to a severe snowstorm, they share a dingy, low-class motel room together. The whole scene where the two of them are forced to share a bed together has to be one of THE funniest moments in cinema history, fa'real. Anyways, to make a long story short, these two end up being companions as they travel all over the map struggling to get to Chicago. They try taking a train, a Greyhound, a rental car, and absolutely everything that could possibly go wrong does. And it does so in utterly hilarious ways. Del Griffith is a well-meaning and likeable fella, but he seems to be a bad luck charm for Neil, who is NOT a very tolerable person. These two just can't seem to get anything right.
What shocks me the most is how the majority of movie critics of the day thought that this film was over-indulgent and badly-scripted. This is the part where I squint my eyes, shake my head and scream ""WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU!?"" I mean, really, this is one of the funniest, most involving and most consistently entertaining movies I've ever seen. I've seen it countless times since it first came out and I make a point to watch it at least once every year at Thanksgiving time. Not once has the comedy ever felt stale or the touching moments ceased to water my eyes.
The bottom line is that this film is VASTLY underrated. The late John Candy does what I feel is his best work here. The speech he gives to Neil in the motel room after Neil's extended rant about what a boorish person he is, is really touching and inspiring. The way Candy says the lines, he never misses a note and his emotion feels so real, ""You can think what you want about me. I'm not changin'. I like me. My wife likes me. My customers like me. 'Cuz I'm the real article. What ya see is what ya get."" It really makes me miss John Candy and wish he hadn't been taken from us so soon. Steve Martin turns in a great performance too, no matter how cold and selfish he seems at times, you always feel that deep down there is room for good in him. And it eventually emerges. This is an all-out hilarious movie with some of the funniest looks, moments, and situations in movie history. It never once misses the mark. And, maybe I sound a little cheesy, but it also is very moving, and speaks volumes about friendship and the way we treat people.",1017878400,11,4083,4.409271523178808

317785,4,6300989003,"If you've ever had to spend time on the road for business, you know how it feels to just want to get back home, especially for a holiday like Thanksgiving; the family's waiting for you, there'll be a fire in the fireplace and a turkey dinner with all the trimmings.  All you have to do is get from here to there.  But that's when Murphy's Law concerning best laid plans often comes into play, and the simplest things become obstacles of monumental proportions, which is exactly what happens in ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles,"" a comedy of monumental proportions, written and directed by John Hughes.  Neal Page (Steve Martin) is in New York on business; it's two days before Thanksgiving and he has a plane waiting to take him back home to Chicago.  He has his reservation, and it's not that far to go; but it's a holiday and the weather is chancy, and beginning with the trouble Neal has just getting a cab to take him to the airport, he's about to become mired in frustration as one thing after another thwarts his attempts to get home.  Not to worry, however, once on the plane he meets a guy named Del Griffith (John Candy), a showercurtain-ring salesman with all the answers and connections in seemingly every city in the country.  Which comes in handy-- or maybe not-- for Neal, when the weather in Chicago forces a closure at the airport and his flight gets diverted to Wichita, Kansas.  But that's only the beginning of Neal's problems, because Del Griffith is on the job, and he's the guy to know in a situation like this.  Or not.  And the next couple of days become a comedy of errors that takes Neal to the edge of sanity and the audience to the edge of hilarity.
 An astute student of human nature, John Hughes takes his observations and insights and translates them in this film into a story with which just about anyone is going to be able to identify.  We've all been in Neal's situation at one time or another, in one way or another, and if you've lived more than a day on the planet you certainly know a Del Griffith.  And Hughes has a way of bringing you into Neal and Del's world so that you are able to share their experience, while at the same time affording you the luxury of being able to observe it all at arm's length, which enables you to see the ""big picture"" and appreciate the inherent humor of it all.  And the bottom line is, this movie is a riot.  There's something of the spirit of Jack Lemmon's ""The Out-of-Towners"" about it, the whole idea of nature seemingly conspiring against the little guy, that keeps the laughs coming; and Hughes couldn't have had anyone better than Martin and Candy to put it across more successfully.
 Martin has an inspired way with physical comedy-- he can make walking down the street funny-- and he infuses it with a subtle, underlying sense that something is always going on inside him that's just as funny as what he's showing you.  It creates an air of anticipation, and he never fails to deliver on that promise.  Like Lemmon, he has the ability to play the ordinary guy in an extraordinary situation in a very real way, and then take it to the limit without going over the top.  And when the reserved, inner turmoil finally erupts, it has you laughing until your sides ache.  It's Lemmon standing in the middle of the street railing at the city of New York, and Martin confronting a rental car clerk and spelling it out for her in no uncertain terms what he thinks of her, her cars and life in general at that particular moment in time.  It's pure humor, and it works so well because there's absolutely nothing mean-spirited in the way it's delivered, which is something for which Martin-- and Lemmon before him-- deserves a nod of appreciation and acknowledgement; it's a fine art that few comic actors are, in fact, able to master.
 John Candy, meanwhile, puts his own natural abilities to the test in creating a character in Del that is the antithesis of Neal.  And he passes with flying colors.  Del is the big, lovable goof who wears his heart on his sleeve and holds nothing back.  With Del, what you see is what you get, and there's not a thought that goes through his mind, apparently, that he doesn't feel obliged to share with anyone and everyone who will listen.  Everything about Del is externalized to the point of being overwhelming, and yet Candy manages to convey the feeling that even he has something locked away that is for himself alone, and it's that which makes Del a well rounded character and makes him real.  Like Martin's, Candy's is a performance that is rich in detail and humanity, which makes Del believable, and a memorable character.  Candy was perfect for this part, one that he was seemingly born to play.  And he makes the most of it.
 The supporting cast includes Laila Robins (Susan), Michael McKean (State Trooper), Dylan Baker (Owen), Edie McClurg (Car Rental Agent) and Charles Tyner (Gus), with cameos by Kevin Bacon and William Windom.  More than just a funny movie, but one which exemplifies the ""human comedy,"" ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" is a triumph for Hughes, but more especially for his stars, Martin and Candy, who demonstrate a refined understanding of human nature and behavior through their respective characters that makes this film so endearing, memorable and entertaining.  This is one to watch again and again, whenever you're in need of a good laugh or just something to put a smile on your face.  This is one that will definitely fill the bill.  It's the magic of the movies.",1007510400,7,5510,4.595505617977528

On his trip home, he meets up with an annoying schlub, played by the very missed John Candy. Needless to say, the trip back home goes horribly wrong and it's these two guys who keep getting hooked back up with each other. Steve can't seem to get rid of him!. At first, Candy's character seems to be obnoxious. As the trip goes on, we see that there's more to him, and that he's just a normal human being like the rest of us. Martin gives one dandy of a comedic performance here. His uptight businessman is pure perfection. His obscenity laced rant at the car rental desk in the airport is a priceless gut buster. A gem.

It's the day before Thanksgiving and Neal, played with great comedic genius and timing by Steve Martin, just wants to get home and be with his family for the holiday.
Of course, everything that could go wrong, does go wrong.
Enter John Candy, as Del, the lovable bear of a guy who seems to turn up everywhere Neal does throughout pretty much the entire film.  They have all sorts of mishaps together the first being bumped off their flight to Chicago.  They manage to travel along side even though Neal is clearly not happy while Del has this goofy grin on his face through most of the movie.
There are so many hiliarious momments throughout the film, but it is also quite heartwarming.  The end of it is very moving.

For anybody that's had a mishap or two while travelling, this film is essential viewing; I'm no huge Steve Martin fan either, but he does a fantastic job as the straight (stiff) man, and his reactions are spot on.  Candy's got second billing, but don't let that fool you.
This film touches you on many levels while at the same time remaining very much a pure comedy for all ages (aside from the occasional profanity).

Many years went by before the highly anticipated DVD release.  At this day I still consider this movie one of the best comedies I have ever seen and also one of the most refreshing. You can watch it over and over, going through the many classic scenes and enjoy it every single time.
I think what makes this movie so attractive and classic is that it satirizes typical day-to-day traveling situations using a very clever script and two exceptional comedy performers in John Candy and Steve Martin.  I don't think any other couple would've matched the chemistry these two stars displayed on their many scenes together.
This movie is a must have for serious comedy fans and it is, in my humble opinion, one of John Candy's best performances.

It's a shame that they had to go ahead with all of that language on this movie as up until then it would've been a PG family flick. But other than that (which is sorta funny anyway!

... still, this is one great film. Steve Martin plays the straight New York Ad Executive who's trying to get home to his family for Thanksgiving. John Candy plays a bumbling shower ring salesman who ""steals"" Martin's taxi -- from there the humor never stops. Martin gets stuck with Candy at every turn and goes through a series of some of the funniest sequences you'll ever see. Eventually Steve sees the 'inner John' and they become friends.
Yep, this DVD is priced a bit on the high side. Not really sure why, but then again, it's one you'll watch again and again. And it's suitable for the whole family; as the more sordid scenes are merely by inuindo. The younger set simply won't understand why mom, dad and the older siblings are rolling on the floor, clutching their aching sides.

His karma becomes inextricably entertwined with John Candy's as they make there way from NYC to Chicago via KC. This duo plays well off each other, generating more laughs per mile than a truck-load of comic bumperstickers.
Beyond (or beneath) the comedy, however, lies a critical look at the isolation of the American male.

317892,4,6300989003,"This DVD really deserves 5 stars for the comic content and chemistry, but unfortunately Paramount put practically no effort into the DVD format.  There are virtually no extras and it is as plain vanilla as a DVD can get.  In addition, it's not the complete film.  For some reason Paramount decided to print a version of the film that cuts out some great scenes, even though it runs a modest 92 minutes.  Truly a lousy job.  This film deserved better treatment.
As a John Candy fan, this is my favorite performance.  Steve Martin was also very well cast as more of a straight man.  The story is simple as these two polar opposite people struggle through Thanksgiving holiday travel nightmares trying to get from New York to Chicago.  Neil Page (Martin) is an upper class kind of business man in advertising who just can't seem to shake Del Griffith (Candy), a ham-and-egg shower curtain ring saleman just trying to make a living.  Del does the best he knows how, but of course nothing seems to go just right.  After all the laughs, the last few minutes of the film is actually touching.
The movie has become a Thanksgiving weekend tradition for us to watch (mute the scene at the Marathon Car Rental desk if the kids are within earshot, otherwise it's hilarious) and I still laugh everytime I watch it.

Nonstop gags and continual comical commentary on bosses, taxis, air travel, motels, train travel, rental cars, and so on.

This is a film where John Candy shines in a costarring role.  Much as I enjoy John Candy, his best films are those where he is not the solitary star.  Remember the impression he made on us as lovable ""Ox"" in STRIPES?

This film has some great moments.  The ""You're going the wrong way"" sequence is hilarious. Also look for brief appearances by other stars such as William Windom, Kevin Bacon, Michael Mckeon, and Ben Stein.

The DVD disk is the same as the VHS version.  Unfortunately, there is no director's cut of this film, nor are there additional scenes.  This is surprising in that longer versions of this movie have already appeared on television.  Indeed, the televised TBS/TNT version includes additional scenes including an extended airline meal sequence.  The other interesting aspect of the televised version, which is not yet available on DVD as an option, is that alternate takes were used.  This is most obvious in the scene where Steve Martin uses some explicatives when dealing with the rental car lady. The televised version uses an undubbed version with Steve Martin's character, just as frustrated, but using toned down language.

Needless to say, ""P,T&A"" has to be John Candy's best and most remembered film of this late, great comic actor's career. The film starts out with an advertising executive named Neal Page (Martin), who is desperately trying to get out of New York City in order to make it home to Chicago for Thanksgiving. After failing to catch a taxi on the first try from a cab racer (Kevin Bacon), Neal is having to bargain to pay to get a cab from a scrupulous attorney, while at the same time, someone is getting in Neal's cab. After having paid for the taxi, the cab pulls away without Mr. Page, so he mercilessly runs after it in the middle of traffic! When he attempts to open the cab door, he briefly sees the man who stole his cab before it speeds away, who happens to be none other than our beloved shower curtain ring salesman Del Griffith (Candy)! The two later meet at the airport, and Del, at first after having denied stealing the taxi, apologized to Neal for taking his cab. Then, as if Neal Page doesn't already have enough problems, he finds out he's been bumped from first class and is placed in coach in the seat next to, you guessed it, Del Griffith! As fate would have it, our enemies-turned-friends-turned-enemies- turned-friends would be tied together throughout much of the movie. By utilizing every means of transportation possible, our boys take a plane, then a train, then a bus, then a car, then a semi (and if you count the el-train and a truck in between) to try and get home to Neal's family in time for turkey. The entire journey took an eternity (two days) but what the hell, THEY DID GET HOME. Aside from the transportation, this movie has many hilarious scenes in between, such as the motel scene, the car-rental counter tirade (WARNING:EXPLICIT LANGUAGE), the burned up, charred automobile, etc. Don't forget the comical lines, which you'll have to hear for yourself. You'll need to have the Kleenex handy for the ending, so make sure you have an ample supply on hand! Whenever I watch this film, I am usually left with a deep void in my life because of the fact John Candy is no longer with us. I only hope that one day I'll meet my Del Griffith in the same circumstances and we'll become best friends in the end. We all need a Del Griffith in our life. If you're unable to find your real-life model, then don't despair. Order your copy of ""Planes, Trains And Automobiles"" today! It'll make you a HUGE John Candy fan if you aren't already.

Paramount, as with their pathetic Star Trek DVDs, has once again decided to put the smallest amount of effort into producing a DVD that could and should have (at the very least) trailers and commentary. What really infuriates me about this release is the fact that I feel Paramount knowingly and willingly misrepresented the DVD in order to increase sales. Other sites besides Amazon have advertised ""deleted"" scenes for the DVD, and I'm inclined to believe that they were all duped by Paramount and encouraged to provide a product description that is a farce. (At this point, I must ask why Amazon hasn't changed its erroneous product review.) The DVD provides NOTHING extra, not even a trailer, and the $30.00 price tag is offensive.

This isn't meant to be a slapstick, broad comedy, but it has elements of that.  Martin and Candy are a mismatched pair of travelers on the way home to Chicago from NYC for Thanksgiving.  Along the way they fall victim to every travel nightmare imaginable.  Though Martin has his funny scenes, he is basically playing the straight man to Candy's Del Griffith, a shower curtain ring salesman who latches on to Martin's Neal Page, an ad exec used to FAR more luxurious travel conditions than this fateful trip will present.  At its heart, however, is a story of how these two people from different social classes form an unlikely friendship, albeit a friendship that is tested over and over under frustrating circumstances that would try even the most patient traveller.  Both men must learn some ugly truths about each's own character, and both must learn to be more accepting of the other's faults.  Hardly a recipe for hilarity, but it works.

We have gone through a half dozen flimsy VHS tapes and are delighted to have ordered the DVD this year.  Like Neil Page and Del Griffith, the new DVD version likely will have difficulty getting home in time for Thanksgiving due to its November 21 release date.
I love this film because of the comic artistry of Steve Martin as Page and John Candy as Griffith.  Anyone who has journeyed at the mercy of the travel industry can recognize the surly and indifferent airline, car rental, and hotel employees encountered by Neil and Del.

The f-word scene is something I have wanted to do everytime I stand in a long line waiting to simply be helped by someone, only to be sent to another counter.  This movie is pure magic through and through.  The laughs never let up (at least until the end) and you're left wondering if this is something that could ever happen to you. I am here as living proof, THE ANSWER IS YES! I met my ""Del Griffith"" four years ago on a plane from Seattle to Tokyo, we got stranded in Tokyo for two days.  Aside from being the loudest talking person on the face of the earth he was hands down the most annoying person I ever met and 4 years later we are the best of friends!  Too funny.  This movie has a lot of heart and it's gonna be great to see the outtakes they've shown numerous times on network tv.  This movie is simply classic.

I own the video (actually had to purchase another one for the my  first one appeared to be getting worn out). I have always loved Steve  Martin from his standup days to his first wacky move ""The Jerk"".  After watching ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"", it made a John  Candy fan of me for life. I actually laughed until my face hurt the first  couple times I watched it. There were also a couple of times when I  actually found myself moved to tears. Martin and Candy complimented each  other so well in this film that it covered up any flaws that were written  about the movie by the well known movie critics. There are so many  memorable parts in this movie that you can't help but laugh inside whenever  one thinks about them. From the pillow scene, the car rental fiasco, to the  pickup ride through the snow, you are along on this hilarious roller  coaster ride. I watch this movie several times a year and our family has  made a yearly tradition of watching it on Thanksgiving eve to give the  movie an added impact (these 2 are making efforts to get home for the  Thanksgiving holiday). It is pretty much a given that you will enjoy this  DVD time and time again. I really am grateful it is now going to be  available on DVD and still can't believe it took so long to happen.

318059,5,6300989003,"A stellar performance from Steve Martin and the late, great John Candy.
I don't know where that guys doing the Editorial Reviews are  coming from, this movie is great!
Steve Martin is stuffy ad executive  Neil ""I can take anything"" Page and John Candy is the bungling  but warm-hearted shower-curtain-ring guy (I know what you mean), Del  ""Extra set of fingers"" Griffith.  We follow this mismatched pair  half way across the States and back again as they encounter one crisis  after another.  As the title says, our heros travel whatever way they can  to get to Chicago- from planes to trains to cars.
One of the funniest  scenes is when after Del gets his coat caught behind the driver's seat,  panics and sends the car on a tailspin causing him to go the wrong way down  the Interstate.  We see their car get caught between two semis.  During the  squeeze, Neil looks and sees Del as the Devil, complete with pitchfork and  horns.
In all, this movie is great!  You will not be disappointed, that I  can promise you because it's ""filled with helium, which makes it 10%  lighter.""",965260800,109,1080,4.619047619047619

John Candy at his very best,  showing high comedy but also a reflective side.  My mom passed away in 1991  and this had also been her very favorite film.

318110,5,6300989003,"Even though we do not celebrate Thanksgiving here in Scotland I watch this film once a year before I get in the Xmas mood and watch loads of Xmas movies like Home Alone, Scrooged and Christmas Vacation. It has become a tradition and perhaps even a necessity.

Neal Page (Steve Martin, back when he was funny) is a Marketing Exec who has just made a pointless trip to New York 2 days before Thanksgiving. The inconclusive meeting in question ends just half an hour before his flight back home. If he hurries, he'll catch the flight no problem and be home with the family before he knows it. Right?

Well, no. There are no cabs on Wall Street. After being hustled out of $75 for a cab someone else hailed it promptly takes off with passenger unknown. But no matter, the airport has delayed the flight because of snow. In the waiting lounge, Neal meets Del Griffith (John Candy, man do I miss him!), a shower curtain ring salesman and the very man who went off in his Taxi. Despite Del's insistence on making it up to Neal, he fobs him off and remains in a mood.

Once on board the plane the fussy Flight Attendant seats him in coach as there was a mistake with his first class ticket. Guess who he is sat beside? Del of course. And he blabs on and on, telling unfunny, unamusing anecdotes to an increasingly squashed and uncomfortable Neal.

A huge snowstorm in Chicago results in the plane being diverted hundreds of miles, all the way down to Wichita, Kansas. Neal is forced to spend the night with Del in a unbelievably seedy motel...in the same bed. That night they are robbed and left with nothing but their credit cards.

Since Del is a massive slob who leaves his dirty socks in the sink, crumbs and wrappers everywhere and spills beer on the bed, Neal would like nothing more than to ditch him and get on with his long journey home alone.

It's here that the emotional punch of the movie really kicks in. Neal is arrogant and selfish but Del stills sees some good in him and would like nothing more than to be his best buddy. But he is repeatedly kicked aside and ignored as the two of them inch their way home. Fate crosses their paths over and over and Neal is pretty much only temporarily sticking with him to serve himself. Candy's need for a pal and his frustration at Neal only becomes apparent after the first viewing as it's the shocking twist ending that makes you add up his character and emotions.

At the time this film was already brilliant, but it's the fact that Del Griffith and John Candy are almost one and the same that makes it that extra bit special. Both were friendly, chatty and tried really hard to be liked. And now that Candy is gone forever you can't help but really, really feel for him and see the trouble he is going through despite his best efforts to hide it. Neal and Del may be opposites but as they both struggle through setback after setback they eventually come to empathise and understand each other.

I dare you not be moved to tears when Del is sitting alone in the train station and confesses his secret to Neal. If you are not crying then you truly have no soul.

The film ain't just an emotional character drama. It's also a road movie with loads of snow covered middle-America scenery and is extremely funny and packed with classic scenes. Anyone who has seen it already will know what I mean when I say 'THOSE AREN'T PILLOWS!' Del driving on the wrong side of the highway will suffocate you as will Neal's confrontation with the rental car receptionist, the character of Owen (Dylan Baker) and his nasal problems.

Ocassionaly, James Ira Newborn's score can be a bit distracting and even slightly inappropriate, but there are some deeply emotional cues in there that can easily shift the mood of a scene. Inconsistent it may be but overall it's better than most comedic scores.

Planes, Trains and Automobiles is an eternal tribute to how great Martin used to be before he sold himself out to family movies and how wonderful John Candy was as an actor and a person. For him alone this film gets 5/5. He was brilliant and died far too young, but in his short career he did give us some unforgettable stuff and this movie is certainly one of them.

It is clear to me that all of the critics that didn't like  this have a bad sense of humor. You can't even have a bad sense of humor  and not find this movie incredible.

You can watch it over and over, going through the many  classic scenes and enjoy it every single time.  I think what makes this  movie so attractive and classic is that it satirizes common day-to-day  traveling situations  by using a very clever script and two exceptional  comedy performers in John Candy and Steve Martin.  I don't think any other  couple would've matched the chemistry these two stars displayed  on their  many scenes together.

From the 'puppies' in the plane to the dog in the truck, from the 'bed  scene' to the 'pajama party,' from the hands between two pillows to the  sloppy handshake, from the break up to the make up, each has its moments.

This scene is definitely not for  children. We can certainly understand the frustrations of Martin when it  comes to dealing with airports and rental car companies.
