It was educational and entertaining for me. However, my six and seven year old grand daughters lost interest at times, because of the constant dialogue and the flipping back and forth from Germany to the Arctic and then  to the woods.

3960024,5,B002NTDXP0,We enjoyed the documentary. Perhaps more could be said about global warming and its effect on the Artic. It's also amazing that a bear cub could bond so closely with its caretaker. We need more films like this.,1391904000,,210,4.552631578947368

My six-year-old loves anything animal related, even (or should I say especially) documentaries/true stories.  We must have rented this ten times from the library, so I finally bought it for her for Christmas and it still gets popped in all the time.  She loved watching Knut from the early days when he had to be fed with a baby bottle to his first jump in the water for a swim with his trainer/caretaker at the zoo; it really was a parent-child relationship with them.  The couple of sub stories, like with the black bear cubs finding their was was also super cute.  We both highly recommend it!",1362182400,,672,4.566666666666666
3960033,5,B002NTDXP0,"This is great for kids, little Knut has to be loved and the other two stories are fun an interesting too.

Unlike other wilderness movies, there are no lions, wolves, or other animals killing each other, There is a little fight with a wolve, but its nature, there wiull be some animal fighing, frod eating and such, but not one of the animales dies on screen, so there is no trauma for the kids.

My little 2 year old asks for Knut all the time, Even thou we speal spanish at home and the video only has english audio. The images speak for themselves",1361836800,5,550,4.278846153846154

I have not yet purchased this product, but really, do you even have to? Looking at the cover simply makes me black out, cuteness overload. As soon as I save up $8.76, this will be ordered.

3960042,5,B002NTDXP0,"When Knut was born there was a lot of publicity concerning him, even whether the little cub would be allowed to live. That was a terrible thought.

3960047,5,B002NTDXP0,"Excellent DVD of Knut and two other bear families. What makes this DVD now more special and dear to me is the untimely passing of Knut on March 19, 2011. Amazing how such a little guy from birth grew into such an amazingly well known creature throughout the world.",1301011200,3,264,4.408163265306122

3960050,5,B002NTDXP0,"Knut & Friends is a terrific video! It documents the world famous polar bear & it also shows you how life in the wild can be for wild bears and polar bears alike. It is very moving, very sweet for young and old alike. I highly recommend this video if your an animal lover. You cant help but smile at Knut's antics while growing up. Makes you fall in love with Knut and you can see why millions have fallen in love with him.
It also compels you to learn about what struggles bears & polar bears have to deal with in the 21st century. Global warming is a HUGE threa to them, to all of us.
You cant help but want to help the bears and polar bears. They ARE feeling global warming right now. We MUST do something - now to stop it. It makes you think, makes you wonder if your kids & grandkids will be able to see polar bears & bears in the wild...or just in a zoo.
