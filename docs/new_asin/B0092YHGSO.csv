8534906,4,B0092YHGSO,"After the success of the first film in 1972, subsequent sequels followed that created a spin off series just like the Schulm&auml;dchen-Report films. In this 3 disc box-set from MCP, we have the first three of Lass Jucken Kumpel in chronological order. All three films were written and directed by Franz Marischka and the budget and production values were fairly high. The plot/story involves a bunch of randy coal-miners in the Ruhr valley of Germany; who are hard-working, hard-drinking, and just plain hard for any ""ladybird"" that crosses their path (which is frequent enough!). The films were interesting in the sense that they didn't play up like a straightforward sex-comedy, probably because there was a lot of melodrama thrown in, that included some backhanded and backbiting moments. Along with the eroticized elements that one has come to expect from these films (there was a lot of ""extramarital"" activity going on, if you know what I mean). I think the filmmaker wanted to purposely mix-it-up, to give it a ""real life"" angle or feeling. Anyway, I'll spare you the boring details and give you a play-by-play of the ""interesting bits"" this subgenre is known for.

And by Elisabeth Vogelsang, in a scene that somehow slipped through (...pardon the expression...), where she was clearly having intercourse in an out-of-control car that, was careening down-the-road. It lasted mere seconds, but well worth it! PAL format, German (no English subtitles), FFN, NR 89 mins.

There you have it. This collection is a worthy addition to all enthusiasts of the German ""sex comedies."" The DVD picture and sound quality is surprisingly excellent, all three films have been fully-restored to a pristine state. (BTW: I bought this box-set through Amazon.de for 12.60 euros.)

Love and Peace,
