5669806,5,B00BSEUU0C,"Once again excellent.  Uwe Kockish captures Brunetti to a ""t""  They are very well done.  Im never disappointed. Each book should be made into an episode.",1371168000,7,153,4.8076923076923075
5669807,5,B00BSEUU0C,"Sometime there seem to be plot changes for the films, but there is great fun in seeing the characters depicted on screen",1371168000,,120,4.5
5669808,5,B00BSEUU0C,Have all the episodes in the series and they never disappoint. And are true to Donna Leon's characters & books.,1370736000,,111,4.6
5669809,5,B00BSEUU0C,"sorry to see the series come to a close
i have seen all 18 of the  90 minute episodes
if you are going to watch the series  start at the beginning though
the episodes stand on their own
just enough comedy sprinkled in with the police action
have seen many iltalian series-Brunetti the best
DONNA LEON  crafted great stories and characters with limited violence",1370390400,8,360,4.59375
5669810,4,B00BSEUU0C,"I have 99 points of praise and only one criticism: The dialog is not in Italian, but in German. Note also that Donna Leon is ""one of a kind"" --- no one else writes mysteries as she does, no one else gives you the true flavor of Venice and its variety of characters. I love all these mysteries and hope they continue for as long as Donna Leon is able.",1368144000,8,350,4.014285714285714
5669811,5,B00BSEUU0C,"Donna Leon's Brunetti Mysteries are just wonderfully entertaining, extremely well acted, not to mention with fantastic scenery! Plan on getting so hooked you will want every one available season.

As for the seller:  fast, fast delivery...well packaged and safe arrival to my home, and all at a fair price!",1366675200,,306,5.224489795918367
5669812,5,B00BSEUU0C,"Great series, only small change with shift to a different actor for Brunetti after the first 4 shows.",1406678400,,101,4.666666666666667
5669813,2,B00BSEUU0C,"A very Germanic video version of a very Italian book series.  The actors presented themselves as stereotypically German (quiet, gloomy & repressed) and didn't convey the quirky, subversive, Italianate characters I like in the books.  Quite a disappointment, and a huge difference from the ""Detective Montalbano"" and ""Young Montalbano"" DVDs.  Speaking German didn't bother me - misrepresenting the characters did.",1391040000,,412,5.833333333333333
5669814,5,B00BSEUU0C,"I have bought every DVD in the series and enjoyed every one.  After episode 4, the actors playing Brunetti and Paola changed--which was disconcerting at first but I got used to it.  I think all actors did a good job.  Some people have commented that the German (for an Italian story) with English subtitles was somewhat off-putting, but I didn't find it so.  I soon got used to it.  The stories are engaging.  There is humor but it is not heavy-handed or mean-spirited.  The scenery and architecture are stunning.  It's a series I can watch over and over again without getting tired of it.",1389571200,,589,4.596153846153846
5669815,1,B00BSEUU0C,"I was dissapointed because the Dialoge is in German not Italian.
I found it to be a conflict. The settings are elegant and it needed
the sound of the Italian Language to really pull it off since the storie
takes place in Venice not Berlin. I sent it back because I speak and
and understand Italian not German.",1388102400,,309,4.344827586206897
5669816,5,B00BSEUU0C,"Best series of its kind. Donna Leon's writing, acting and direction -- and the singularly beautiful setting make this my favorite cop show.",1386201600,2,139,5.086956521739131
5669817,5,B00BSEUU0C,"Donna Leon's I love the scenery of Venice..the acting is superb , and of course Donna Leon's stories are unbeatable ..It is a bit disconcerting to have to read subtitles as it is in German, would love them to come out in english ...altogether a great product

5669818,1,B00BSEUU0C,"The package contained the wrong CD. #17 was the wrong one; Supposed to be ""The Girl of his dreams"" but was a repeat of "" Suffer the children""",1377907200,,141,4.071428571428571
5669819,5,B00BSEUU0C,"These murder mysteries are set in Venice, but all of the actors speak German - however, English subtitles follow along.  There is much humor woven into all of the stories in this series.  When is the next series going to be available?",1375315200,4,234,4.5476190476190474
5669820,5,B00BSEUU0C,"The German produced series based upon Donna Leon's novels continue to be well acted.  Though the DVDs do not follow the novels precisely, I find them an interesting expansion upon both the story line and the Brunetti family. The author has said in at least one interview that she does not like what the DVD writers have done to the family, too stoic. But I think they seem quite real and lovable.",1374624000,2,396,4.5
5669821,5,B00BSEUU0C,"Although I like all of the international mysteries,  Brunetti is my favorite. I can't wait for more to be released.",1372464000,,115,4.75

8573262,5,B00BSEUU0C,Found the books in a small bookstore in Venice 10 years ago and have read them all. So excited to have the DVDs and I have the complete series. They follow the books very well. Love the scenery. Their apartment is very close to the apartment we rent. Actors are perfect. Wish they were in Italian,1466035200,,296,4.303571428571429
8573263,1,B00BSEUU0C,Good movies.,1457827200,,12,5.5
8573264,5,B00BSEUU0C,"This episode tugs at the heart as well as the social conscience. The tale revolves around the death of a young gypsy (Roma) girl who is found floating in a canal. Did she fall or was she pushed?  Was it an accident or murder? For Commissario Brunetti and even for the incompetent Patta, the death must be resolved, though their motives differ. The character trait we most love about Guido Brunetti, his humanity and global view, shines through the entire episode, and, in true Donna Leon fashion, the network of subplots and flashbacks illuminate the commissario's background and the issues facing minorities in Italy.",1441584000,,618,4.9423076923076925

8573268,5,B00BSEUU0C,"Though in German, it's a mystery staged in Venice.  The subtitles are good; the plot subtle and riveting; and the characters, especially that played by Uwe Kockisch,  are excellent.  Highly entertaining.  I recommend it.",1414713600,,220,5.382352941176471
