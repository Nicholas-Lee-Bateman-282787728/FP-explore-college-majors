This is a DVD-R and would not play on my older Toshiba DVD player. It did play on a newer Sanyo unit.

There are some truly nice scenes in this video, but unfortunately a lot of filler also. No helicopter shots, and much of the film was shot after the peak color. My guess is that they waited for the nice, blue sky autumn day that can be few and far between in the Smokies. Also needs lakes and waterfalls to add variety.",1179273600,2,519,4.18
