8731910,5,B014VB0AVC,"- Synopsis: A world about mechs that are powered off of lust. These aren't your typical heroes, as they allow their desires to run wild all for the sake of increasing combat effectiveness. But mainly to allow their lust to run free. Their common enemy? Penguin-like enemies with front tails sticking out. An anime filled with lust, temptation and fan-service, Daimidaler is all about using mechs powered by the source of perversion!
===========================================================================================================

- Comments: It seems the main concept for this anime is that lust is not something to be ashamed about. It's something that is necessary and shouldn't be silenced. This possibly alludes to animes such as Shimoneta or Prison School.

Anyways, unless you watch a lot of ecchi-type animes, this one is going to be heavy in fan-service. If you don't like fan-service or waifus, then it would be best to avoid this one. The story and fighting is a bit wacky, so it can be hard to take it seriously. But this adds to its entertainment value aside from the perverted fan-service.

- Analysis: This anime also does an excellent job about the discussion of perversion. As much as a person claims to dislike perverted things, such as fan-service in animes, all it really does, is reflect upon their hypocritical nature.

That is, perverted things and acts are everywhere. Meaning, there is no escaping it. All a person can really do is learn to accept it. To reject such a notion is simply irrational. That would be like claiming a person does not believe in gravity or rejects the entire concept around it.

- Features: English and Japanese audio with English subtitles. 12 episodes on 2 Blu-rays and 12 episodes on 2 DVDs with a run-time of about 5 hours. Rated TV-MA for sexual content and nudity. There's plenty of uncensored goodness!

- Conclusion: Most people seem to reject perversion while this anime emphasizes that it is necessary and should be embraced. Note that this does not encourage law-breaking. It's just that being perverted is normal. Saying otherwise is merely hypocritical. A silly anime with cute girls, over-the-top situations, mecha fights, and plenty of groping, this anime is a great guilty-pleasure.

8731912,5,B014VB0AVC,"Lots of VERY wacky comedy.  Really quite ridiculous actually.  Heavy on innuendo, light on actual fan service.  NOT for kids.",1470096000,,125,5.15
8731913,3,B014VB0AVC,"Fairly mediocre (maybe even mediocre at best) depending on your specific tastes. Comical mecha-raunch-fusion series. Definitely has its moments of laughter and its moments of super nifty fan-service. But rarely a combination of both on screen at the same time somehow.

Personally I'm a big fan of the really great & well known fan-service titles, like High School DXD, Sekirei, HSOTD, Yamada's First Time, etc.....but Daimidaler left quite a bit to be desired. Except nudity and groping for the sake of each. Basically just silly versus entertaining I suppose.

Go in with low expectations, or JUST to watch a plethora of naked boobs & you should be quite pleased. But go in hoping for another diamond in the proverbial rough like ""High School DxD"" and frankly, you're going to be disappointed. Just my two cents.

As a quick barometer from my own watch, buy, and preferences: I buy 100% of what I watch, even if I stream via Hulu, Funimation, or NF first, because I try to support the industry as much as possible. Also, about 98% of what I watch I buy first, before ever seeing a single episode - just from knowledge via trailers, research / reading about prior to release, etc. It's always worked just fine & I only own MAYBE 3 titles that I don't care if I own or not after I watched. This is now one of them. This was also the FIRST time ever, literally - no exaggeration, a 2 disc series took me 2+ weeks to finish watching. Every single other series, regardless of genre or rating & type of series, I watch in a single quick sitting of all 10-13 episodes (on average). If it's 24 eps, I watch over the 2 weekend days before placing on the shelves of my, now massive & totally nerd inducing collection. This one I watched 1 to 3 eps at a time, over the course of about 11 days. Then shelved. Probably not going to rewatch again very soon, heh. Which is unfortunate because I love the VAs in it - some of my absolute favorites did the English dub!! And they did a great job! I guess they can't all be perfect 10s though, eh?!)

8731915,5,B014VB0AVC,"I've been looking for an anime on that's drawn the same way of highschool dxd. This little gem is from the same creators. But is it as??? Almost but still very fun with great action sequences, even more overtop main characters with a pretty straight forward plot. Overall I really enjoyed this series and would mind seeing a second season in the future if the source material allows it.",1453593600,4,386,4.608695652173913
8731916,5,B014VB0AVC,I give it 5 stars becuase who wouldn;t like to always be able to squeeze large OPIAS and be the master at it. Perversion is the last great adventure any healthy herto male can be now a days. Heck I know I gotta play with some bodasious tatas to get my energy at peak. This is a ecchi anime if I ever seen one. The animation is not that good but then again that is not the pourpose of this series. The porpuse is ecchi or to annoy a girlfriend it works well for that too.,1451433600,4,470,3.90625
