2794371,5,B000OCY7JE,"A previous reviewer calls 'After the Wedding' a tale of 'stupendous coincidence.'  I love that phrase.  Indeed, that's what the key event in this movie feels like.  The thing is, though, it's simply not the case.  Over time, we learn and see that Rolf Lassgrd's Jrgen is anything but a man to leave things to coincidence.  The viewer is let in to slowly see his charm, his shrewdness, his business acumen...and the little scheme he's put into play between his family and Jacob, as portrayed by Mads Mikkelsen ('Le Chiffre' to 'Casino Royale' fans).

As for Mikkelsen, what can I say?  He's Denmark's George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon, all rolled into one.  The guy can act, too.  You'll see the phrase 'soap opera' used on these pages.  In the hands of lesser actors, yes.  But not with Mikkelsen and Lassgrd - their performances are what landed this film on this year's Oscar nominee list.  [As good as it is, no way it was going to win out over 'The Lives of Others' - to me, that's the best single film of the decade so far.]",1182643200,8,1035,4.475935828877005
2794372,5,B000OCY7JE,Phenomenal film that well-deserves all of the positive press I had heard about it. A story of stupendous coincidence as a Danish man running an orphanage in India returns to Copenhagen for the business end of a large donation. This movie so simply could have been a narrow and uncomplicated story but each moment peels another and yet another unexpected layer. The acting was absolutely marvelous as relatively pigeon-holed characters begin to blossom into more dynamic people. Sensational movie but the white subtitles are a real strain.,1182470400,4,538,5.195402298850575
2794373,4,B000OCY7JE,"This subtitled movie (though the scenes in India are in English), is a very enjoyable look at the radically different lives that one man leads in India, and the Denmark he left behind.  Mads Mikkelsen plays Jacob (with a 'c', it is noted) who helps run an orphanage in a desperately poor India.  An offer comes in from a rich Dane, Jrgen, who is thinking of supporting the charity.  Jacob promises to return in time to one of his charge's, Pramod, birthday. He reluctantly leaves his life in India helping the children, puts on a suit, boards a well-appointed plane and gets a chauffeured ride to a luxury hotel.  It's as much of a culture shock as one can imagine.

The rich Jrgen's life is one filled with board meetings, a mansion, wealthy friends and relatives, every one of whom could make a difference in the poverty of India.  However, there is a wedding to plan, with Jrgen's daughter getting married to a young man of the firm.

Several plot twists ensue that make Jacob question the purpose of his life, and which world he wants and needs to live in.  It turns out his love and compassion is needed in both.

2794374,4,B000OCY7JE,"`After the Wedding,' Denmark's ""Best Foreign Picture"" nominee for the Academy Awards has a lot going for it.  Even if there is a soap opera feel to the scenes and the story, the quality is head and shoulders above any serial.  Not to mention the fact we get six months of development in one movie.  Solid performances, and camera shots that capture every revealing reaction give the story a magnetic interest.

The film begins in India where Jacob Pedersen (Mads Mikkelson) works with the impoverished.  He feels at home with the children, but he goes back to Denmark to raise funds for the orphanage and get reacquainted with his family.  At home his former love Helene (Sidse Babett Knudsen) has married a tycoon, Jorgen Hanson (Rolf Lassgard), someone Jacob is able to solicit funding with ease.  Once they meet, he is invited to their daughter's wedding.  Much like `Rumor Has It' with far less laughs, yet more substantive development, Jacob finds out at the reception that he has more at stake at home than he previously thought.  From there he is reattached to deceptive Helene, and both must sort out the bitter resentment they feel for one another.  (Did he have one affair as he says or was he the philanderer by her account?)  Toasting her mother and step-father at the wedding, the bride Anna (Stine Fischer Christensen) later comes to grip with life-changing information in her own life.

Skillfully sorting out the relationships and priorities of the key players, `After the Wedding,' presents a bitter-sweet story with memorable characters and interesting circumstances.  One of the merits of the film is how it defines poverty in India and compares it with a different kind of impoverishment for the wealthy.  Jorgan's problems wouldn`t make us trade places with him for the world.  Similarly, one of the boys at the orphanage reminds Jacob that he doesn't even like the wealthy.  Another ironically says, ""If I were rich, I'd be happy.""  Watching everyone come to grips with their lives and barter for stability make `After the Wedding` a revealing family portrait.",1179100800,49,2082,4.936781609195402
2794375,5,B000OCY7JE,"Director Susanne Bier, Best Screenplay writers Susanne Bier and Anders Thomas Jensen, Best Actor Rolf Lassgrd, Best Actress Sidse Babett Knudsen, and a few other supporting and camera work nominations would not surprise me. I will be disappointed if they are not rewarded for the talent and intelligence evident in this film. After the Wedding is so honestly human that it does indeed break your heart. Happily it also hands you hope, a little laughter, and moments of tender warmth and love.",1178323200,3,492,5.012195121951219
2794376,5,B000OCY7JE,"This was a wonderful film. It was well written, well directed, and well acted. But the film goes to Rolf Lassgard. I first saw him in the movie ""Under the Sun,"" and I did not recognize him as the same actor. He looked so entirely different. Although I somewhat enjoyed Under the Sun, I was disappointed in the script. However, this was a one-der-ful script. From start to finish, Rolf's character was secretive, loveable, loving, and very funny. I loved the way he laughed, and he had the ability to break my heart. A genuine and award-winning performance by Rolf Lassgard!",1177286400,6,573,4.683168316831683
2794377,4,B000OCY7JE,"Early on in Susanne Bier's Oscar Nominated (Best Foreign Film 2006) film ""After The Wedding"", Danish expat-in-India Jacob (the solid Mads Mikkelsen) is faced with the prospect of reluctantly returning to his homeland after twenty years to meet with a mysterious man who is offering the necessary funding to keep his school/orphanage open.  When explaining to Pramod (his adopted son-of-sorts) that he must leave, the precocious eight year old asks about the wealth of people in Denmark and finally concludes, ""If I was rich, I'd be happy.""

Soon after, when we delve deeply into the lives of the proposed benefactor and his family, we see that this proclamation certainly does not apply to all people.  Or, at the very least, it definitely does not apply to billionaire Jorgen (the authoritative Rolf Lassgard) or his family.

Although it seems like it might at first.  The jump from the teeming Indian squalor to the lush green Danish countryside almost jarringly illustrates the contrast of cultures (and that contrast is definitely underscored by patriarch Jorgen blasting ""It's Raining Men"" in his SUV); the disparity between the Third World and the First World is indeed extreme (the difference is Two Worlds, by the way - I did the math).  It's quite comical to see Jacob, upon arrival, trying to adjust to the cushy confines of the hotel where Jorgen houses him, as he can't figure out how to work the electronic amenities.

When Jacob finally meets with Jorgen, his pitch is given short shrift by the busy billionaire: ""We're through,"" Jorgen says impatiently, leaving Jacob's presentation video mostly unseen.  But he still leaves the donational door a bit ajar as he invites him to his daughter's wedding, where Jacob could get some more face time.  This seems like a good plan at first, as Jacob has nothing else to do while in town, but revelations at the ensuing reception reveal that all is not as it seems.  Indeed, when newly-betrothed bride Anna (played by perky Stine Fischer Christensen) rises to make an unconventional speech and says, ""Mom's waiting for something to go horribly wrong,"" well it turns out that Mom (aka Helene) (Sidse Babett Knudsen, in a deeply-layered performance) doesn't have to wait long, and all of their lives are soon turned upside-down.

As an unabashed fan of Scandinavian cinema, I had high expectations for this film, and it didn't disappoint in most respects.  The crisp, naturalistic cinematography and unapologetic (although occasionally a bit melodramatic) exploration of emotions is all to be expected.  Also always welcome are the sardonic, dry lines of humor and the quirky characters (such as online gambler Grandma, who - according to Helene - is senile ""only when she wants to be"" and is mostly seen complaining about her laptop's wireless internet reception).

A couple of aspects of this film didn't quite work for me, however.  First, I found the multitude (maybe between 20-30 close-ups) of shots of single eyes was a bit overdone and took me out of the narrative flow, without having enough of a symbolic upside.  Also, some of the scenes teetered just at the edge of being a bit too maudlin and soap-operatic, but I guess life sometimes does get that way, and the actors are never unconvincing.

Finally, some of the tonal shifts were a bit too uneven in places, as the film careens from joy to sorrow in split-seconds that can be unnerving in such an otherwise slowly-paced film.  But about that pacing: others may complain that this film could have been a bit cut to a more streamlined length, but I personally love the lingering and the loitering that takes place in movies like this - I feel we get to know as much about the characters during their ""down time"" as we would when there's ""something happening.""

Ultimately, I feel this film ends up being an evocative exploration of whether or not to to tell the truth, of when to tell the truth, and of how to tell the truth even when it's difficult. And telling the truth when it's difficult is something this movie is very good at doing.  Four stars.

(p.s. I'm purposely not telling you who says this review's title quote because I don't want to spoil it for you.)",1176595200,53,4185,4.857946554149086
2794378,5,B000OCY7JE,"Jacob, doing humanitarian work at an Indian children's refuge, (the erstwhile ""Casino Royale"" villain, Mads Mikkelsen) doesn't know what to think when his superior tells him that a prospective benefactor ( Rolf Lassgard in a heart wrenching performance as Jorgen) requires Jacob to return, after twenty years, to Denmark so that the refuge can receive a huge donation. So as much as Jacob dislikes the idea, and at this point we know not why, he returns to Denmark in Susanne Bier's remarkable, emotionally charged, sometimes even overwrought ""After the Wedding.""
Bier has composed this film in much the same way as a Verismo opera: scenes of confrontation, scenes of enlightenment, scenes of disclosure are piled one on top of the other as the film slithers insinuatingly towards its tragic yet redemptive denouement.
All of the main characters: Jacob, Jorgen, Jorgen's wife Helene (Sidse Babett Knudsen in a mature, sexy performance) and Helene and Jorgen's daughter, Anna (Stine Fischer Christiansen: young, fresh, committed) are transformed, turned around and pointed in another direction psychically and physically by film's end due to the catastrophic upheavals that they endure during the course of this amazing film. Bier is dealing with Melodrama here, with a capital ""M."" Melodrama done up right: not as a joke but as serious and humane as the Master's of this genre: Almodovar and Douglas Sirk (""Written on the Wind"") to name a couple.
Mikkelsen's Jacob, due in a large part to Mikkelsen's hang-dog, stoic physical appearance, is an empty vessel at the beginning of this film. His work at the refuge is fulfilling and good yet you can't help feeling that Jacob is hiding from life rather than contributing to it and that his reluctance to venture back home to Denmark is his way of primarily keeping his past at arm's length. By the end, Jacob is transformed, filled up, overflowing by way of the redemptive powers of confession and acceptance: he's been opened, upended, turned inside out.
Don't come to Bier's world of ""After the Wedding"" expecting to be lulled into anything resembling a calm, quiet mood...you will genuinely be unsettled. Do come to ""After the Wedding,"" in many ways similar to ""The Celebration,"" expecting to squirm in your seat, to have your guts wrenched with the terrific bravura acting of this ensemble of actors, to cry your eyes out at scenes of transcendental beauty and truth. This film will challenge you not to react and therefore in one way or another you will react due in large part to Bier's compassionate mise en scene. A mise en scene rife with humanity and love.",1175299200,129,2612,5.006896551724138

2794385,5,B000OCY7JE,"This is one of my favorite films.  The Danes are the stars of capturing human emotion on film; there is no comparison to their human compassion, subtlety of emotion and depth.  After The Wedding  captures on film  the profound, multilayered complex emotions and motivations of multiple family members of a wedding party, lyrically and effortlessly in a most compelling drama with multiple twists which is  hard to do in this medium.  Several characters have ulterior motives,  other characters have known each other before the wedding and meet shockingly after twenty years at the wedding ceremony; it is just a surprising and wonderfully emotional drama yet at the same time so subtly done-if this was an American movie it would be inevitably, a clumsy, unbelievable, over the top farce that causes one to balk.

The style is no doubt affected by the fact that the director, Susanne Bier, is a woman.",1401494400,3,635,5.097087378640777
2794436,2,B000OCY7JE,"VERY disappointing after all the great reviews.

The story is maudlin, predictable, and completely unbelievable; and it takes itself so seriously that it practically begs to be laughed at. The direction is sloppy and plodding, leaving out what matters and leaving in what doesn't. The cinematographer used a handheld camera for tight closeups far too often, for no reason, so that often the screen is filled with one huge head (sometimes one huge eye) bobbling around.

All the actors are mediocre at best; none of the relationships are believable; and all the characters were either so badly written or so badly acted that I never believed or cared about any of them - except the tough, smart, adorable little boy in India, who was on screen for no more than ten minutes.

I don't understand why Mads Mikkelsen is so popular; he acts and looks like an unwrapped Egyptian mummy. David Dencik, another Scandinavian actor, is infinitely more interesting and attractive; unfortunately he's not on hand to save this leaden turkey. This was my first and (I hope) my last Susanne Bier movie.",1401408000,,1085,4.918032786885246

Apparently the storyline is interesting, and she recognized some of the actors , a quality movie.

2794466,5,B000OCY7JE,"Most of the other reviewers have laid the foundation for what this movie is about, so there is no need to re-hash that here.

This was an amazing movie. When you watch a movie of this caliber, you really see the difference between 'international' vs..'domestic' films. On the one hand, it's incredible how much story-line and emotion can be communicated in so few words. In addition, when you watch an international film, you pay more attention to body and facial cues, which really tells you what great acting went into the piece. These actors were incredible, never missing a beat. Even the kids and those in the background helped to carry the 'feel' for this movie. This movie held me from start to finish. Heck, I even watched the credits at the end, even though I couldn't read/translate most of it.

I loved the film, I loved the story, and I love how the Director brought everything together, full-circle.

2794469,3,B000OCY7JE,"Susan Blier is a well regarded Danish film director who made ""In A Better World"", ""Brothers"" and her latest ""Love Is All You Need"".
This film is about relationships, between former lovers, husbands and wives, father and daughter, etc.
To make it work as a film, the story, the characters' motives and actions must be convincing, be it a soap opera or not.
Jacob the middle-aged Dane who worked at a orphanage school in India was invited by a multi-millionaire named Jorgen back home who offered possible funding for the near bankrupted orphanage.  Upon meeting, Jorgen invited Jacob to attend the wedding of his young daughter.  At the wedding ceremony, Jacob recognized Jorgen's wife and believing the daughter belonged to him while in a relationship with Jorgen's wife 18 years ago.  Upon which Jacob behaves badly and made a scene as a guest at the wedding which I found unconvincing.  Jacob then approached the daughter who readily accepted kindly of this stranger as her real father instead of the father who raised her which again I found unconvincing.  Shortly after the wedding of that well-matched young couple, the bride found the groom in the bed with another woman which I found too convenient even for soap operas.  Then Jorgen dropped 'the ball':  he's dying of terminal illness which followed by a lot of tears and hugs.  The director used many extreme close-ups of parts of the actors' faces which I found overdone.  The acting is generally good, especially the actors who played Jorgen and his wife.",1391990400,,1516,4.890625

The acting is so good it's hard to call it acting. Mads gives a terrific performance with credible yet ever subtle acting.

The range of emotions covered a wide spectrum and I actually wished it could have gone on for another hour or so to see how all their lives played out. Adding another hour to a two hour movie would be a tough draw, but believe me, once you are immersed in this gem, you will want more.

His voice is gripping to the point where it demands respect.  His wife Helen played by Sidse Babett Knudsen is enough in itself to watch the film! She has trained herself in the perfection of using her eyes for acting and grasping your interest. This film grips every emotion the human heart has, and I mean EVERY EMOTION.

The movie evolves story pretty fast for it-seemed-to-be a slow moving (? well, setting in Denmark and not exactly a thriller or an action movie) film.  The story ends as you might hear in several other movies but still is something very refreshing about the movie.  It could be because it is not one of those everyone hates everyone but people are accepting the changes/truth in life (I don't know how realistic), there is generosity of characters - that simply you don't expect ""the world to be such a nice place"" in recent movies but this is.

Not this one, though, because it has such a compelling plot that jumps and twists and surprises and turns upside down that it demands one's attention. And it has the characteristics I appreciate that seem to come from movies made elsewhere. I call them the grown-up countries (whoops - a red light just now turned on next to my name at NSA.)

2794529,5,B000OCY7JE,"I have seen probably 700-800 movies in my life so far, and this one easily ranks as one of the best 20 or so. It is a very intriguing story, starting out with a man running an orphanage in India. This quickly establishes the main character as someone you can admire and someone to root for throughout the movie. I first saw the main character, played by Mads Mikkelsen, in the movie Casino Royale (2006). He did a great job being the villain in that movie, and I can safely say I have a whole new level of respect for him. Not only does he speak a totally different language in this movie, but he is about as dynamic of a character as they come. You can feel how he feels being at the wedding, realizing that the ""daughter"" of the man giving her away at the wedding is actually his daughter. You sympathize with him being away from the orphanage and trying to build a bond with his newly discovered daughter at the same time. I'm not going to give away the plot, but this movie will keep you interested from beginning to end. It has a heavy dose of drama comparable to Legends Of The Fall (another one of my favorite movies). Some would call it melodramatic, but given the situations the characters are dealing with they do an extraordinary job and it is still realistic.

I would consider this a ""light"" rated R movie. There is some bad language, although it was probably only a few steps away from a PG-13 in that department. There is a little bit of sexuality in the movie, but it doesn't contain any long scenes of it.

Bottom line: This is a fantastic movie that has a ton to offer. If you don't mind a good drama, I would highly recommend it.",1375142400,,1648,4.295819935691318
2794530,3,B000OCY7JE,"I am usually a huge fan of these northern Europe movies for they usually have a delicious weird vibe when addressing relationship issues or society issue, and it is very refreshing. Not in this movie, and this is my main complain. Everything in this movie is a basic clich, from the so neo-colonialist vision of the Indian orphanage to the greedy young son-in-law, to the filthy rich guy trying to control everyone's life, even to the plot... clichs are everywhere, and it ruins it all.
Also, very little time is actually given to develop the psychology of the characters after the big news comes, which would have been interesting.

This movie is OK. Just OK. Yes there are some nice emotional moments, but yes they are predictable. From the way it is directed to the acting, it is totally a northern Europe movie like Danish and Swedish like to produce. Again, not an outstanding performance, but probably different enough from US movies to leave an impression on whoever isn't used to watch stuff that isn't Hollywood.

2794536,5,B000OCY7JE,"I may be getting too sentimental in my old age but this film was so touching that I actually cried through quite a bit of it. What I found so touching was how essentially good almost all the characters were.

The central character Jacob Pederson (Mads Mikkelsen) despite a nearly constant scowl on his face or a look of deep concern and perhaps worry is a man who really cares about right and wrong and other people. This is a sharp change from his misspent youth when all he cared about were...well what many of us cared about, having a good time. Now he runs an orphanage in Mumbai.

While Jacob is the central character the most interesting character and the one with the biggest heart is the very rich Jorgen Lennart Hannson (Rolf Lassgard). Jacob has gone to Denmark to convince Jorgen to support his orphanage. It isn't clear that Jorgen will do so. He has choices for charity. But when Jorgen invites Jacob to his daughter's elaborate wedding, things change.

I won't say any more about the plot since it is such an interesting and surprising plot. What I will say is that when Jorgen learns who Jacob really is in relationship to his family (and vice-versa!) he does something so caring, so surprising and so correct and so magnanimous that it will warm the cockles of the coldest heart and bring to tears the most cynical of viewers.

And then we are back to Jacob and how he deals with what Jorgen has concocted. And he too does the right thing even though it completely changes his life and costs him something dear to his heart..

I wish I could be more concrete. But see the film and I think you'll agree that this is the kind of movie that will make you feel good about people. It's a shame that it's rated ""R."" Perhaps if you have a tweener or even a bright 10-year-old you can watch it together. And you can talk about it. It is a great relationship film, and a great film for teaching young people about the real choices in life that can come up

The acting was excellent. Mikkelsen brought the strength of character and a justified pride to the role of Jacob while Lassgard was warm and real and smart as Jorgen. Both Sidse Babett Knudsen, who played Jorgen's wife, and Stine Fischer Christensen, who played the bride, were intense and so vivid I felt I could touch them. (The intense close-ups on the eyes and faces--and I mean intense--made the actors almost leap off the screen.) But most of my praise must go to Susanne Bier who wrote the story and directed and to Anders Thomas Jensen who wrote the screenplay. The story and the movie are simply brilliant.

Mindfulness emphasizes the ""awareness"" of the ""present moment,"" as seen in this film.]

The accolades accorded to the two leading male actors in this movie are well deserved.

What only slowly grew in my consciousness is the outstandingly nuanced performance by the actress Sidse Babett Knudsen, in her role as Jorgen Hansson's wife Helene.  I did not immediately recognize the varied dimensions of this finely nuanced performance, a hidden treasure which I only gradually realized through repeated, extended exposure, coupled with my increasing understanding of the underlying psychological dynamics which this actress's film character may have been experiencing, and which this actress's performance sought to convey - which she does with aplomb.

Sidse Babett Knudsen's acting is remarkable for another reason: she is playing more than just one role, she is playing three: (tycoon's) wife, mother, and former lover.  Each of these roles requires very distinct character acting, each of which this actress plays distinctively, convincingly, and with powerful feminine magnetism.

Some of the most compelling and effective acting by Sidse Babette Knudsen, as Helene Hansson, is principally conveyed by this actress's wide range of captivating facial expressions, many of which were so subtle and discreet as to be barely perceptible (see her tete-a-tete with Mads Mikkelsen, conducted over a side table at her manor house) - this caliber and range of acting is terrific stuff.

I am not bothered, like some, by numerous close-up shots of the film's four principal characters.  Aren't we talking frontal cortex here? I feel these close-up shots are valid and effective, sometime capturing a film character's private, interior moments, and sometimes a film character's behavioral sine qua non - as with the pivotal realization by Jorgen Hansson's wife Helene, to remarks by the grandmother re her son Jorgen's chauffeur, etc. (followed by a close-up shot of a chandelier's dangling glass chimes).

Intimate, ""non-invasive"" close-up shots, taken from the side, enable the tender capture of  ""getting to know you"" or ""catching up"" moments, when a young girl touchingly examins the facial expressions of her newly-discovered biological father, to see whether he is genuinely interested in viewing the pictures in her childhood photo album.

Considering the magnitude and nature of the information which this film's principal characters have to process, and when and in what contexts they have to process it, close-up shots of eyes may be considered to be part of this film's ""action"" - as, in fact, it is.

I doubt that this film's type of intimate psychological action could be conveyed effectively to an audience in stage acting, where an audience is relatively distant from actors, as it can be conveyed in a film's intimate, and sometimes mandatory, close-up shots, as we see in this film.

It's unfortunate for those of us who do not watch or are not saturated or jaded by soap opera, etc., to be burdened and distracted by some commentators' cheapening, maudlin comparisons of this refreshing, high quality film to, e.g., soap opera.",1340582400,2,3346,5.383141762452107

We soon learn that a benefactor in Denmark, where, it turns out, the young man. Jacob, is from, has offered a huge sum of money to the orphanage and Jacob goes back to Denmark to get it. It's the first time he's set foot in Denmark in twenty years and he is somewhat hostile to the whole scene, but is doing it for the money.  The older man, Jurgen, is an extremely successful, self made man, very Type A, who expansively invites Jacob to the wedding of his daughter, Anna, which is being held that weekend.  Jacob doesn't seem like a party guy but, having nothing else to do, and really wanting that grant, he shows up at the wedding.

Here's where the plot thickens.  There are strange looks passing between Jurgen's wife, Helene and Jacob and soon we realize that Anna might just be the product of an affair between Helene and Jacob back in India.  It's a very interesting set up and I was really eager to see where the plot would lead us.  I think that, in the hands of a better director it might have been very good.  As it was, it was terribly melodramatic, really over the top performances in some parts, which made the characters lose any credibility.  The actors tried valiantly and there were some parts that I found genuinely moving, but much of the second half of the film was tacky.

I found the Danish countryside nice to see, especially the well appointed house of Jurgen and the interesting countryclub where the wedding party was held.  There sure were a lot of stuffed animal heads on the walls, though, and the occasional close ups of these beasts was supposed to symbolized something important, I guess, but to me they just looked creepy.  Likewise, the many close ups of peoples' eyes.  It was an attempt to be arty that really failed and further cheapened what could have been a much better film. It seemed that the director was trying to imitate Ingmar Bergman.

I think that if the director had cut about a half hour of the excessive emoting, that a fine film exploring some complex human relationships might have emerged.  It seems like it was a good idea that got carried away with itself, and like so many opera plots, death just seemed like the only way to wind it up.  Too bad.",1339977600,,2378,4.457274826789838

But, I came across it in the ""A"" section of the library and picked it up.  I was glad I did; otherwise I would have missed out on such a wonderful and beautiful drama.  It's not really a love story, it's a commitment to life, love for a family, and on one side, a deep love for children whose only family is the orphanage.

The film draws you in slowly, first by its beauty from the happy faces at the orphanage, to the wealthy land and mansion of the super wealthy.  The story moves, guides you, takes you on a journey, has you thinking about the plot, and slowly, you are drawn into the reality.
With over two hours, it will keep you interested, wondering, deciding, and here see how a great storyline makes you think, accept, respond, only to offer something new to dwell on.

Jacob Peterson, manager of an orphanage in India is summoned to Denmark to become a recipient of a monetary reward that will save the orphanage from financial ruin.  As he arrives in the midst of a wedding, he discovers that conditions come with the gift.

Anna, an old flame is married to the multi-millionaire now, raising a beautiful young daughter who wedding is taking place.

I love a movie that grips me from start to finish, and that is what happened here.  There is a wealth of emotion, suspense and beauty from the Danish location.

2794590,4,B000OCY7JE,"'After The Wedding' is a wonderful Danish film. It gives us a range of emotions, and the acting is superb.

Jacob, played by Mads Mikkelsen, manages an orphanage in India. He and his group are looking for funding to keep the orphanage afloat. He gets word that a man with influence and money wants to see him before he will give money to the orphanage. Jacob reluctantly returns to Denmark. Here he meets Jergen, played by Rolf Lasagard, who wants to be his benefactor. This man has power, too much money and Jacob is not impressed. It appears that Jergen wants to think about the funding over the weekend, in the meantime, he invites Jacob to his daughter's wedding. This is where the film takes off. At the church Jacob recognizes Jergen's wife, Helena. Helena, played by Sidse Babett Knudsen, is shocked to see Jacob- we understand right away that they had a relationship. During the wedding and reception, we come to also understand that Jacob is probably the father of the bride. This is quite a soap opera. However, this is only the beginning. Jergen has plans, and as the film evolves we see that instead of the ogre, he may have planned something. He is not thhe uncaring man, he seems to be. Jergen has a scene that is masterful and one of the best I have seen.

'After The Wedding' shows us what sacrifice is all about. Jacob for his orphans and Jergen for his family. This is a film that shows the difference between classes and the goodness in people. The acting by all is admirable. Afterall, we are told tht charity begins at home.

2794595,5,B000OCY7JE,"This is a powerful movie. It starts out slowly, mainly focusing on a man, Jacob, whom for the first half of the movie I did not like. He was too self-focused and abrasive.  As the movie starts, Jacob is working in an orphanage in India, but is called to Norway by a multi-millionaire, Jorgen, who says he will donate money to the orphanage. When Jacob meets with Jorgen, Jorgen procrastinates and says he is still considering and invites Jacob to attend his daughter's wedding the next day. At the wedding Jacob meets Jorgan's wife, whom he recognizes as someone he knew many years ago. And thus the story begins.

This movie is superbly directed by Susanne Bier, who has directed several highly noted movies centering on how families behave during crisis situations, like ""Brothers"", about interactions between two brothers when one is sent to the war in Afghanistan, and ""In a Better World"" that won the 2011 Academy Award for best foreign film.

After the wedding is subtle in some ways, obvious in others; but it will demand your attention and engage your emotions the whole way. I don't know if it will have you squirming in your seat, as one reviewer says, but he is correct when he says you will be unsettled. The movie has strongly affecting visceral elements and I found myself thinking about different segments days later. The movie was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2007, but lost out to ""The Lives of Others"", another outstanding film.",1320364800,,1483,4.762645914396887

However, the plot and the story line could have been improved once we get to the end in terms of the relationship between Jacob and Jorgen - something was a bit left out (but I can't put my finger on it.)

2794604,5,B000OCY7JE,"After The Wedding is filmed, realized, created, and gifted to us from Susanne Bier (In a Better World). She is a master artist. The cinematography and editing are 7 stars on a scale of 5.

Mads Mikkelsen (Casina Royale) gives us a show stopping, honest performance. He is tapped by countless international productions for his incredible skill and unique overall persona/image. He is an actor who carries his weight on screen. He is this man he portrays. His actions and movement on screen are incredible. He acts without words.

Rolf Lassgrd (Swedish Wallander Movies) blew me away with his portrayal of Jrgen Lennart Hannson, a Swede tycoon in Denmark. For me, I love the Swedish actor, speaking Swedish against one of its two sister languages Danish. It is something enjoyable to me for reasons I cannot explain here. This role was far from what I have seen him portray. He nailed it.

Sidse Babett Knudsen also threw down in this work of art. Stine Fischer Christensen proved that she is a young actress worthy of her European acclaim. Stine steals our hearts and the later part of the film with a tear jerker scene.

Susanne Bier is a master artist. I understand why Hollywood called on her for ""Things We Lost in the Fire"", a film which has her touch, on a smaller scale. I felt that Halle Berry was the weak link as an actor. Also Fire was missing something.

I was not happy with a development later in the film. The development makes the story tick. Blame the writer.

I felt that the overall artistic beauty, lovely direction, and top grade acting make this a no brainer as a 5 star work.

After the Wedding starts off tremendously -- a Danish aid worker in India learns he will get the large donation he needs to keep his childrens' home running. The catch is that he has to fly to Denmark to meet the donor, who plays with him, suggesting he needs time to really decide whether to hand over the money. ""I have to go to a wedding this weekend,"" he says. ""Why not come with me?"" The aid worker turns up at the wedding to discover his long-lost former girlfriend there. She's married to the donor and may or may not be the mother to the aid worker's child, one he never knew he had.
  Here's where we are 30 minutes in. And then it all falls apart spectacularly, dissolving into near gibberish as we're hit with melodrama piled on melodrama and bizarre plot twist following on bizarre plot twist.

I was only able to get through this film the second time round because of the director's exasperating obtrusiveness (e.g., hundreds of gratuitous CUs), but boy does it pack a punch, if you can look past that.  By the end of the film, the characters have been raked through the coals and the viewer feels he has gone on a meaningful, harrowing journey right along with them.

The plot concerns a man who attends a wedding only to find out that the bride is a daughter he hadn't even known he had.

2794612,5,B000OCY7JE,"I truly respect director Susanne Bier for not conforming to the types of films society often embraces but actually really working to create something that feels real and pure within her work.  Even in her English speaking film `Things We Lost in the Fire' she never shied away from presenting the audience with something uncomfortable if she knew it was `real'.

Of all her work, I feel that `Efter Brylluppet' is her best.

We all know the term `misery loves company' and if you've read my reviews long enough to know the types of films I often indulge you'd know that that phrase can be applied to my preferred entertainment choice.  I love a film that can move me to tears and tear me down because it produces something real in me; a real emotional connection to the material.  Thus, the film becomes something so much more than just `entertainment'; it becomes a part of my soul.  `Efter Brylluppet' is not that depressing but it does produce something in me, something raw and unforgettable.  The film filters through so many emotions on screen and it elicits so many emotions off screen.  It's such a well rounded emotional rollercoaster and I love that about it.  You can feel something for every character, but what makes this movie so amazing is that you feel so many different things about each character.  There is no designated villain, no designated hero, no designated victim.  Everyone is all of the above at one time or another and thus each and every character becomes so much more than just a `character', they become human.

The film tells the story of Jacob, a man working in an orphanage in Bombay.  When funds run low and he becomes desperate he travels to Copenhagen to meet with a wealthy man offering to `consider' his orphanage for a large donation.  The catch is that he must stay and attend the man's daughter's wedding.  It turns out that this man, Jorgen, is married to Jacob's ex-girlfriend Helene who happens to have bore her daughter, Anna, out of wedlock.  If you aren't following then I'll put it a little blunter.

It appears that Jacob may actually be Anna's father.

This is the immediate surprise, but it is not the only one, in this masterfully crafted weep fest by Bier.  Each character has so much to say, and each and every word seems to help complete and or flesh out the person next to them.  Each person is so connected and reliant on those around them.

`Efter Brylluppet' exposes the beautiful side of human connection; trust me.

The acting here is also outstanding from everyone involved.  Mads Mikkelsen is wonderfully controlled as Jacob, allowing his eyes to expose what his character is always trying to conceal.  I also really loved what Rolf Lassgard did with the character of Jorgen.  He takes this man and creates someone who appears one thing, so mysterious and someone guarded, and exposes his secret in such a desperate and crushingly realistic way.  It's a beautiful (and heartbreaking) transformation.  As great as the two men are, Sidse Babett Knudsen is even better.  As Helene, she really has to carry a lot of the emotional weight of the film (it was her cross to bear) and she does so with such raw connection and flawless control.

Such a stunning performance.

So, to bring us back to my initial statement, about `misery loving company' and all that.  The reason I brought that up is because, as some of you know, I love films that embellish the miseries in life.  I often find that a films `happy ending' is a falsity and that it takes away from the gritty realities I like to see in my cinema.  What is so beautiful about `Efter Brylluppet' is that I turned my whole opinion on its head.  This is a film that, yes, focuses on some of life's miseries, but the end result is something so beautifully complete that it sparked in me a realistic idea of hope.  No, the ending is not all roses and candy, but it lessens the bleak with a believable display of picking up, moving on and doing the right thing.",1245196800,2,3973,4.619115549215406

2794614,5,B000OCY7JE,"""After the Wedding"" was nominated for a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar in 2007 and is directed by Susanne Bier [whose other credits include Brothers]. The story centers on human relationships, and the tangled webs that connect one individual to another, as well as family ties.

Jacob [Mads Mikkelsen, more familiar as the villain from Casino Royale] has devoted his time and many years to establishing humanitarian projects in India. He is told that the orphanage he is working in is running low on funds and is persuaded by the director of the orphanage to return to Denmark to negotiate a possible deal, a large donation from a prominent businessman. When Jacob arrives in Denmark, he meets Jorgen [Rolf Larsson] who seems almost uninterested in the details about the orphanage and doesn't give an immediate answer as to whether he will bail out the orphanage. Jorgen then insists that Jacob attend Jorgen's daughter's wedding, and Jacob reluctantly agrees.

At the wedding, Jacob is stunned to discover that Jorgen's wife is Helene, a woman from Jacob's past. Soon after this meeting, the drama escalates, as Jacob begins to feel he is some sort of pawn in a game orchestrated by Jorgen. Needless to say, all is not as it seems and Jacob questions Jorgen's motives, as does Helene.

There are plenty of twists and turns in this movie, and at times, it does appear contrived, but the excellent acting, especially by the actors playing Jorgen, Jacob and Helene, as well as the assured direction elevates this movie above a regular melodrama. There are some truly poignant moments that had me all weepy, but this is after all a drama about human frailties and the complex ties that bind people to one another.

The DVD comes with extra features such as a 2006 interview with the director [in Danish], 8 deleted scenes,and an eight-min featurette that has a movie critic discussing the deleted scenes with the director. Total running time is 1 hr 59 mins, and the language options are:
Danish 5.1 Dolby Digital
English Subtitles

Jacob Pederson manages an orphanage in Bombay, India. Now, he has to fly home to Denmark in order to meet a potential donor who's also his former girlfriend's husband. With a twirling camera, inherited from the Dogma artistic movement, Susanne Bier handles a very interesting theme: can you make people happy in spite of them ? Can you, like an ancient god, rule people's lives without their knowledge and, most of all, is this interaction morally defendable when good comes of it ? I'll remember for a long time the performance of Rolf Lassgrd as Jrgen Lennart Hannson, a man used to be obeyed and who never accepts no for an answer.

Peterson works in an orphanage in India and then must fly back to his home country of Denmark to seek funds.  Mikkelsen's good looks and powerful spats with Helene show him to be an actor with depth and range.  Rolf Lassgard's Jorgan is well played with a powerful scene toward the end of the film.  Jogan's wife Helene is played by Sidse Babette Knudsen who does an excellent job, making believable the woman in this situation.  Christian Tafdrup plays Christian, the groom at the wedding.  His good looks make him a good choice; and he shows his colors early on, which rapidly flare into his newlywed estrangement.  Stine Fischer Christensen plays Anna, the daughter who must adjust to several paternal adjustments as well as a marital one.  Neeral Mulchandani is charming as Pamrod who has been raised by Jacob in India.  The film sparkles, constantly moving and developing the story until it reaches its conclusion.

The artistic triumph of After The Wedding is the slow revelation of plausibility and motivation where at first there seems to be only implausible coincidence and random behavior.

It's a sad movie with scenes of genuine love. If you automatically find sadness just a synonym for depression, you won't like it. Is it a melodrama? Perhaps, but it probes far deeper into the emotional cores of its four main characters than any melodrama I've seen since Bergman.

Is it a pleasure to watch? I found it so, chiefly for the riveting performances of the actors, especially Rolf Lassgard as Jorgen, whose actions are pivotal in the lives of the others.

The film is very well edited, the camera angles used were essential to getting to know the characters. Everything in this film is amazing. It is one engaging film, from beginning to end.

The story begins in India where a Swedish gentleman redeems himself running an orphanage in India that is in dire need of finincial help. It comes from a  fellow countrymen billionaire who would like to check his character and plans before he will afford a very ripe gift. The story continues into a twist of lost loves, integrity and pride, and the true meaning of kinship.
I recommend this movie and others by this director. I only wish Hollywood would invest some of it mighty wealth towards meaningful movies such as this, that every one in the audience could question their own intentions and values and possibly redeem your life.",1202428800,10,915,4.980392156862745
2794626,3,B000OCY7JE,"The infamous Danish director Susanne Bier has established herself as the so-called queen of piercing relationship melodramas (bordering on soap-operas), filmed in a style reminiscent of Dogme (natural lights, handheld DV cameras), only with a script and a soundtrack. Her ""Open Hearts"" dealt with the consequences of physical paralysis, and what that does to a blossoming relationship. ""Brothers"" told a story of two, um, brothers, one of them back from torn Afghanistan, competing for the affection of a beautiful woman (Connie Nielsen).
Bier's poignancy, the immediacy that carry her films, and the truthful dialogue that resonates have, so far, overshadowed her over-reliance on close-ups of the protagonists' eyes, insistent sentimentality, and a pessimistic tone that can frankly be a major downer. Bier's US feature debut, ""Things We Lost in the Fire"", got criticized for an overexuberance of those latter qualities. Though ""After the Wedding"" is a stark and powerful drama, it also suffers from an unremittingly dismal tone. It seems as if Bier, instead of infusing her films with a much-needed sense of humor and love for life, has delved even deeper into the sadness and wretchedness that people can inflict upon each other.
Jacob (Mads Mikkelsen) works in an orphanage in India. It faces closure due to financial issues, so he goes back to Danemark to ask for a grant from multi-millionaire Jorgen (Rolf Lassgard). Jorgen immediately begins to play mind games with Jacob, telling him he will ""consider"" him as one of the main contenders for the million-dollar grant, but needs a few days to think it over. Since Jacob has nothing to do, Jorgen invites him to his daughter's wedding. Jacob arrives, suspecting nothing. And then he recognizes Jorgen's wife...
From this point on, the film goes into plot complications that I will not divulge. I will say one thing - it's all downhill. As lies are unmasked, and old secrets surface, things only get worse.
Granted, ""After the Wedding"" is a class act. It's assured, mature filmmaking, with a clear sense of purpose. The acting is beautiful throughout - it really is hard to pinpoint a stand-out, everyone's so good - as is the script, the film's deliberately slowly unfolding plot  gradually revealing its many mysteries. But the film is also claustrophobically depressing, with barely any humor relief from all the drama. There's even a clumsily added (seemingly last-minute) sub-plot involving the daughter and her new husband's infidelity, which seems wholly unnecessary, apart from adding even more weight to an already weighty drama.
As for the film's Dogme-like style, its pretentiousness distracts from the plot in some crucial spots as much as it entices you to watch in others. I'm a big fan of Dogme films, but here, after the 100th aforementioned lingering close-up of someone's eyes, artistry is toying with self-parody, and that's not a good thing for a film in which the inter-weaving of style has to be seamless.
So, while better written, directed and acted than the majority of Hollywood dramas, ""After the Wedding"" will not appeal to those who try to avoid depression-trip movies. In typical Bier fashion, it raises a lot of questions of love, death, the choices that we make and their consequences, and only provides answers to some, while leaving the rest for our deliberation. Maybe it's time for the director to attempt a new approach; she can remain an auteur but try a different genre, for example. As it is, ""After the Wedding"" is competent: powerful but unoriginal.
And depressing. Boy, is it depressing.",1201564800,7,3585,5.117747440273037

2794629,4,B000OCY7JE,"A Danish orphanage worker outside Mumbai, India, is summoned home to receive a large donation from a wealthy industrialist in this intensely acted 2006 drama that seamlessly melds Douglas Sirk's hyperbolic melodramas with Ingmar Bergman's more austere sensibilities. Directed with panache by Susanne Bier, the result is really an involving soap opera given greater texture and surprising plot turns by Anders Thomas Jensen' dexterous screenplay. 2006 was obviously a fertile year for world cinema as this emotionally vibrant film competed against Guillermo del Toro's Gothic fairy tale&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pan-s-Labyrinth/dp/B000O76ZQC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pan's Labyrinth</a>&nbsp;and the winner, Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's Cold War thriller&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lives-of-Others/dp/B000OVLBGC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lives of Others</a>, for the 2006 Best Foreign Language Film Oscar.

The story's protagonist is Jacob Peterson, a taciturn man dedicated to the orphanage he runs in India, so much so that coming back to Denmark holds little interest for him other than securing the funding he needs from a multinational corporation headquartered in Copenhagen. The seemingly avuncular CEO Jrgen Hansson just wants to shake Jacob's hand for his humanitarian work. When Jacob arrives, however, it becomes clear that Jrgen hasn't quite made up his mind about the gift much to Jacob's consternation. It seems like a good omen when Jrgen invites Jacob to his daughter Anna's lavish wedding at his palatial home, but then Jacob meets Jrgen's comely wife Helene, who turns out to have known Jacob years before. The story peels off one revelation after another, sometimes with subtlety and other times with the forceful contrivance of a sledgehammer. Each of the major story developments hinges on a secret that a principal character is forced to reveal, most often with devastating consequences.

Looking a bit like Viggo Mortenson's recessive brother, Mads Mikkelsen (almost unrecognizable as the nasty banker Le Chiffre in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casino-Royale/dp/B000MNP2KI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casino Royale</a>) portrays Jacob with haunting power, though sometimes the character is presented too elliptically for Mikkelsen to flesh out effectively. For instance, we don't get a deep sense of his inner struggle over saving thousands of children in India since he lets his pride stand in the way when it becomes convenient to the plot. Rolf Lassgard manages to capture the bluster and increasing desperation of a man used to having his way but unable to cope with the inevitable. When his character's motivations are slowly revealed, his performance starts to unravel into excess, especially in a no-holds-barred breakdown scene toward the end. As the wife with the complicated past, Sidse Babett Knudsen is genuinely affecting, as is Stine Fischer Christensen as the waif-like daughter caught in the middle.

Bier's idiosyncratic filmmaking style can be seen in the unexpected jump cuts and the heavy use of close-ups on the actors' eyes during the most tense and cathartic moments. The 2007 DVD is sparse on extras. Neither a commentary track nor a making-of featurette are included, but there is a reasonably insightful twenty-minute interview with Bier conducted by Danish film critic Morten Piil. Also included are the theatrical trailer and eight deleted scenes which Bier explains to Piil were cut because they either detracted from the main storyline or made a redundant plot point with little additional benefit. Looking at them after seeing the film, I would agree with her assessment. It's a very well crafted piece of work and certainly provides enough dramatic fireworks and moments of true insight to make this worthwhile viewing despite the occasional plot contrivance.",1199577600,,3973,5.991197183098592
2794630,4,B000OCY7JE,"Hopefully, you have not read the above editorial review from Amazon.com.  Frankly, the Amazon.com editorial review gives away too much from the film which is part of the pleasure in discovering the plot as it unravels.  Anyways, this Danish film was nominated for Best Foreign Picture in 2006 but lost to an equally well-done German film, ""The Lives of Others"".  However, I feel that this film deserves credit with its writing/direction and wonderful acting cast.  It is a surprise to see Mads Mikkelsen who you probably recognized from the latest James Bond 007 Film, ""Casino Royale"".  He actually shines quite nicely in this role.

It's difficult to describe the plot without giving too much away.  But, I must say that there is a lot of care in slowly revealing the relationship between the main character, Jacob, and the other characters in the wedding.  The film presents the happiness, despair, dreams, acheivements, failures, etc. in life which is pretty much like everyone's life in general.  We are faced with tough decisions in life and deal with it just like these characters.  In the end, we just appreciate what we have and continue living.  That's the real charm of this movie which I think that everyone can appreciate from this film.

Without blabbing away too much of the plot, Jacob (Mads Mikkelson) runs an orphanage in India, in sad financial state, and is given an offer he can't refuse. He goes back to Denmark to meet his benefactor (Rolf Lassgard), and here's where loads of angst and deception develop. Turns out Jacob and the benefactor's wife have history (young, baby-booming hippie lovers, at one time). When invited to their daughter's wedding, realizations happen and all hell breaks loose. Stine Fischer Christensen (as Anna, the daughter) is remarkable, and her mother, Helene (Sidse Babett Knudsen) is even better, letter-perfect. The benefactor, Jorgen,  seems to have the upper hand, but as everything unfolds, true and honest characterizations develop. Can't say much more without giving away essential plot points, but I was riveted and highly entertained. The DVD extras are insightful, especially interviews with the director. The film is beautfully shot, and all the acting is excellent. I also enjoyed Christian Tafdrup, as the groom of the title-wedding.

2794632,5,B000OCY7JE,"It has been a long time since I was scared of writing a review, but this is one of those cases. This film is extraordinary, and therefore, I fear not being able to convey the extent of its qualities. Having said that, this is not a movie for everyone, since it develops at a slow pace and, in the typical fashion of Scandinavian movies, spends quite a bit of time contemplating the faces of the actors, in order to allow the viewer to understand their emotions. However, unless the pace is something that really bothers you, this is a movie that you cannot afford to miss.

Jacob is working in India helping homeless children, and in an effort to secure funds for his quest, sees himself forced to travel back home, to Denmark, to meet with the CEO of an important corporation. Upon his arrival, he meets this affable family man, Jorgen, who promptly asks him to stay over the weekend and attend his daughter's wedding. When Jacob sees Jorgen's wife, he realizes that he already knows her, and when a speech by the bride reveals unsettling information, things get complicated really fast. After that, emotions rise to the surface and we witness one of the most beautiful and moving stories I have seen in a long time.

This film not only has a wonderful plot as a backbone, but also counts with an astounding cast, all of whom play their roles to perfection, and excellent cinematography. The use of the cameras, especially with close-ups of the eyes when emotional scenes are developing, works perfectly. As if this was not enough, the little I know about Scandinavian culture was proficiently presented. I attended a friend's wedding in Sweden earlier this year and I was amazed at how similar this was to what they showed in the movie. I have always been a fan of Scandinavian productions, but this film is at a higher level than most. Simply brilliant!",1196899200,4,1856,4.655487804878049

I went to buy this a few months ago, but an employee at my local video store told me there was a defect on all copies. The audio is out of synch for the last 2 chapters (Scenes 14 and 15) of the film. I was hoping future copies would be fixed. I just checked my newly purchased copy and he was partially right. The audio is delayed by at least 2 seconds, but luckily only in the 5.1 surround sound setting. The more traditional 2.0 stereo audio setting works fine, and the picture and sound are generally great, but this serious failure of production need not have happened.

I'm very disappointed because international and independent films like this get very little attention. Even though this was nominated for an Academy Award for ""Best Foreign Film,"" I doubt it will sell millions of copies in North America. It's obvious that a more popular release would have been given greater respect -- either in the careful attention to its initial production or in quickly issuing a recall to fix the problem.

From Denmark comes ""After the Wedding,"" an unusually rich and complex human drama, marked by superb performances, insightful writing, and stylish direction by Susanne Bier.  Nominated by the Motion Picture Academy for Best Foreign Language Film of 2006 (but not released commercially in the U.S. until the following year), this is one of the true unheralded movie gems of 2007.

Jacob (Mads Mikkelsen) is a dedicated social worker from Denmark whose orphanage in India has caught the eye of a Danish philanthropist named Jergen (Rolf Lassgard), who summons the young man to Copenhagen to discuss his plan for donating a substantial sum of his own money to the project.  While in the city, Jacob is invited to attend the wedding of Jergen's adopted daughter, Anna, only to discover when he gets there that Jergen's wife is, in reality, his old girlfriend, Helene, and that Anna might, in fact, be the child he never knew he had.

With a screenplay by Bier and Anders Thomas Jensen, ""After the Wedding"" transcends the ""soap opera"" nature of its premise to become a deeply moving study of the compromises and sacrifices all of us are forced to make throughout the course of our lives.  The characters the writers have come up with are admirably complex, credibly three-dimensional, and never all that easy to peg.  With his somber, deeply lined face masking the emotional turmoil within, Mikkelsen gives a darkly brooding performance as a man who finds it easier to give of himself on a grand scale - i.e., trying to save the world - than to make a meaningful connection with any single individual.  Sidse Babette Knudson is poised and lovely as Jacob`s deeply conflicted former lover and Jergen`s wife, while Lassgard hits amazing dramatic heights as Jergen, who is, in many ways, the most enigmatic of the three main characters.  For much of the film, we are left to ponder whether Jergen is a genuinely good man or merely a world-class manipulator who enjoys playing god with the lives of those around him.  Finally, Stine Fischer Christensen delivers a deeply touching performance as the vulnerable young woman whose wedding serves as the catalyst for much of the drama.  There are no heroes or villains in this piece, only flawed but well-meaning and believable individuals whom we come to care deeply about throughout the course of the film.

In her direction, Bier brings a great deal of texture to the work, focusing on the subtle details of the scenes and boring into the very souls of the characters through intense close-up concentration on the actors' pores and eyes.  The music by Johan Soderqvist is subtle and haunting and adds tremendous flavor to the drama.

""After the Wedding"" is a beautiful film that sweeps us up in its story and characters and makes us intimate participants in the world it is showing us.

2794637,5,B000OCY7JE,"This film was rightfully nominated for the Academy Award.  It is a story of a Danish man living in self exposed exile in India.  One is wondering if his charity work in orphanage is his life's calling, or a character's way of punishing oneself for life choices made long ago.  As money for the orphanage is dwindling, the benefactor appears offering financial help.  But like every charity, this one has a catch too.  Scenes from having main character Jacob return from Indian subcontinent to Europe show his displacement in the world he originated from.  It is obvious that he has been away for too long and everything, from his beautiful, tanned face to the suit he is wearing looks awkward in his new surrounding.  It feels as if he almost wishes to leap back to India and his familiar surroundings in orphanage.  And from this point on, story starts developing with surprises on every step along the way.  Emotional intensity keeps building and building.  I have not seen a movie so powerful like this one since ""Barbarian Invasions"".  This is a story of redemption, love, forgiveness and new beginings.  And like most of those things, it comes wih a high price...",1187654400,11,1168,4.756218905472637

2794639,5,B000OCY7JE,"I'm being spoiled. First I see the beautiful, mature and delightful Mira Nair film ""The Namesake"" (in my top twenty with a bullet) - and now this peach! What's going on!!

""After The Wedding"" has a central performance from Mads Mikkelsen (the facially scared card-playing Le Chiffre in the superb ""Casino Royale"") that is both riveting and Oscar worthy. He's the kind of actor who can just stand there and whole worlds are expressed in his strangely compelling face - an instrument I'm sure the director knew would have us hooked right from the get go. When Mads smiles, you smile, when he hurts - you hurt. When he's on screen, he's riveting, like say Gary Oldman is. And I can imagine, many women wouldn't mind looking at him either - long after the two hours of this is up!

This Danish made movie opens with Jakob (Mads Mikkelsen) in an Indian orphanage - where he is distributing food from a truck, giving lessons in English in a shed of a building and generally holding it all together. But as always - lack of funds threathen imminent closure and the destitute children will be evicted out onto the harsh streets. He gets a phonecall from Denmark from Jorgen (Rolf Lassgard playing a millionaire businessman) with an offer of untold millions that will keep his orphanage open and indeed even help others. He seems reluctant to go and get this gift horse, but he has to. Jakob promises the adoring children that he'll be back within a week and he won't let them down. But things change when he gets there.

Attending the wedding of Anna (Jorgen's daughter), to his astonishment, Jakob recognises Jorgen's wife - and she him - there's been history. Without giving too much plot away - Jakob makes a staggering and life-changing discovery and also, slowly but surely, begins to understand Jorgen's interest in wanting him back in Denmark.

This is about family, loved ones, the preciousness of our kids, betrayal, bad mistakes made in the past, another chance given to redeem them now - all  the best stuff - and although some of the performances are at times slightly 'over-the-top' - the movie has heart - and you root for these people all the way to the end.

The cast is uniformly excellent - especially Mikkelson and Lassgard - who's rivalry and shared loves are beautifully and realistically handled. There were many scenes where tears willingly plopped out of my weary goggleboxes. And there's superb complimentary music too.

I loved this film - I really did. And I hope it will get the vast audience it deserves. Put it high on your rental lists.",1186963200,4,2559,4.698660714285714
2794640,5,B000OCY7JE,"AFTER THE WEDDING  (EFTER BRYLLUPPET)  (A+)

I was just coming off my euphoric high from ""The Lives of Others,"" a Cold War era story of self-discovery and redemption in the desperately paranoiac last years of the East German Stasi, when along comes an exquisite Danish film about reconnecting lives, second chances, and noble deeds called ""After the Wedding,"" written and directed by Susanne Bier, that all but left me hyperventilating.  Both films are as freehanded and frank as they are forgiving while penetrating with astute precision the flawed, enigmatic, but  accessible souls that populate their narratives.  Both explore the murky issues of power, trust, self-interest, honor, morality, and spirituality.  Without sentimentality or the manipulation of our responses, both end on an upbeat, if uncertain note of hopefulness.

""After the Wedding"" is often extraordinary for what is left unsaid -- Bier, with 20-20 vision of her story and its implications, believes in an economy of words and the generous use of camera close-ups to capture nuances in expression, gesture, mannerism, and body language, as her characters have stirring encounters with one another.  Of course, that approach takes for granted the keen insights and instincts of her actors and how fully invested  they are in their roles.  Those assumptions are never in doubt with the cast of ""After the Wedding,"" which is headed by Mads Mikkelsen as Jacob Petersen, a rugged, hands-on humanitarian and, in some cases, surrogate father, who administers a food-aid program for orphaned children in India.

The promise of a windfall gift from a wealthy Copenhagen industrialist named Jorgen (Rolf Lassgard) that will underwrite construction of an orphanage takes Jacob back to his native soil for somewhat delicate negotiations.  There are terms and conditions to iron out before the transfer of funds can be implemented, so Jacob is obliged to be obliging to his benefactor for a few days.  As it happens, the wedding of Jorgen's only daughter Anna coincides with Jacob's stay, and the affable billionaire is graciously adamant that Jacob attend, though our hero is clearly more at home with grit than glitz.

Just after the ceremony itself, Jacob encounters a coincidental and shocking link with his past and, later, a stunning revelation about the present, that saddles him with a potentially life-altering dilemma.  What follows is an urgent and deeply affecting melodrama, in its most distinguished form, that explores with brilliant clarity and aching humanity the yin and yang of allegiances, moral ambiguities, and, in the end, a decision that tests the mettle of a man torn between two callings.

Mikkelsen, seen for the first time by most American moviegoers as the villain Le Chiffre in last year's James Bond prequel, ""Casino Royale,""  is a magnetic actor,  in the mold of Clive Owen, Gerard Butler, Christian Bale, and Russell Crowe,  who commands the screen with his ideally constructed frame, chiseled cheekbones, and wide eyes that peer icily and inscrutably, probe menacingly, and well up tenderheartedly as befits a complex character haunted by a less-than-impeccable past  and confronted with having to make intelligent judgments and agonizing choices that will change the entire landscape of his future.

But ""After the Wedding"" is almost as much Lassgard's film, as he transitions from impregnable corporate mogul with appearances of ulterior magnanimity to gentle giant in the ultimate state of vulnerability.  He has a scene near the end of ""After the Wedding"" that's as exhaustively heart-rending as any I've seen on film.

Like ""The Lives of Others,""  ""After the Wedding"" was an entry in last year's Oscar sweepstakes for Best Foreign Language Film, but wasn't placed in general U.S. release until the first quarter of 2007.  They'll be tough competition for the wave of late year entries that usually dominate my ""Dazzling Dozen.""",1186099200,16,3925,5.270096463022508
2794641,5,B000OCY7JE,"AFTER THE WEDDING ('Efter brylluppet') is a brilliant work, a two hour synthesis of life that demands our full attention and rewards that attention with some of the finest ensemble acting, directing, dialogue and message that we have come to expect from Danish writer/director Susanne Bier (Anders Thomas Jensen is also credited with the story concept). It is a film that raises difficult questions and situations and somehow pulls us into a world of damaged people about whom we genuinely care.

Jacob (a stellar performance by Mads Mikkelsen) is a solitary soul who has found a niche in India as a teacher and caregiver in an orphanage. When he is informed that a wealthy donor is considering being a benefactor, Jacob leaves the children he loves to return to his native Denmark to the home of the potential donor Jrgen (another fine performance by Rolf Lassgrd) and his wife Helene (Sidse Babett Knudsen): in Jacob's past he had been lovers with Helene while both were in India). A major event is in the offing - the marriage of 20-year-old Anna - Stine Fischer Christensen - (Jrgen and Helene's daughter) and feisty Christian (Christian Tafdrup).  The only character who does not seem to have a secret is Jrgen's mother (Mona Malm) who suffers from mild dementia.  It should be a happy occasion, but after the wedding old wounds are uncovered, long secrets are discovered, and nothing is as it seems.  Jacob, now confronted with strange realities, longs to return to his Indian orphanage, but Jrgen manipulates his gift of money in a way that uncovers even more secrets. The multiple surprises that occur rapid fire keep the plot and character development spinning until the film closes with such grace that the audience is left stunned.

As the current barrage of summer movies assault our senses, making us wonder about the mental hunger for films less than challenging, along comes the release of this magnificent work and reassures us that the era of superb cinema has not dissolved into cartoons.  AFTER THE WEDDING is a perfect as a film gets.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, July 07",1185840000,,2096,4.901129943502825
2794642,5,B000OCY7JE,This was such a beautiful film. Breathtaking! The best part was watching it with my movie buddy Sandra Zhao! I cannot wait to see it again. I truly felt like the movie had taken me on a trip to Denmark. I have still not watched the Lives of Other's which beat Pan's Labyrinth and this movie for Best Foreign Film.

2794643,3,B000OCY7JE,"One can see why this movie garnered such praises. Beautifully filmed, knockout kids, excellent performances, and a glorious soundtrack brilliantly featuring Sigur Ros, the film looks, sounds, and feels spectacular. But it is thematically where it lost me, and lost me bad.

I suppose we are to see contrasts between rich and poor, past and present. Money cannot buy everything. Yeah, OK, think we've heard that one before. But what this film is about is atonement. And it seems to say that money can indeed buy that. Jorgen wants to fund an orphanage to atone for his unnamed sins (unless the mere act of making money is a sin in itself.) 12 million dollars, even if they are depressed, buys a lot of hope for a lot of kids. Jorgen, apparently a truly and consistently good man in the world's eyes, is satisfied to do so. And garners praises. Jacob, sullied by a vile past, seeks atonement by serving the world's poor and desperate. Different path, same solution: works.

But I don't think it is so easy. This is atonement for the non-religious, or karma-crowd. The good makes up for and outweighs the bad. Poof, all nasty stuff gone! Do a lot of bad, you had better do even more good to balance the scale. In a Denmark where the Protestant religion once flourished, but here plays no role other than officiating at weddings and funerals, this is the only moral scale to be found. But the old one, the one that says deeds cannot ameliorate what was done, seems far more true to me. Having characters scramble to fix their sins with actions, earning their way into (whatever--public acclaim, easy conscience, family respect, heaven...makes no difference) is the post-modern solution. And one that would make all the very rich, very-ugly-past Hollywood types jump for joy. ""See! I can undo all the scuzz I did and illegitimate children I fathered!"" I'll choose forgiveness instead.",1185321600,7,1879,4.796296296296297

2794646,5,B000OCY7JE,"""After the Wedding"" could be the best film I've seen in a decade.

And I say that even though I didn't see all of it --- like just about everyone else in that theater, for the entire last half hour I was afflicted by a bout of silent sobbing that wouldn't quit.

I cherish that amazing, unforgettable experience: several hundred people weeping together.

And then --- I'm not spoiling the movie here --- came a ""happy ending"" that is perhaps the most satisfying conclusion of any film I've seen in a decade.

Satisfying because the characters earned it. There was a huge price for each of them to pay, and they stepped up to it. They earned the right to better. And, because you have lived their struggles with them, you leave the movie with the kind of satisfaction that no studio-financed, movie-by-committee-and-focus-group can give you.

And the punch line of all this praise?

The story is pure soap opera. Really. On a low budget, with no-name actors and maybe even this script, ""After the Wedding"" would be right at home on Lifetime.

Consider the plot. Jacob, a Dane in his 30s, works in an orphanage in India. He hasn't been home in 20 years, and that's just fine with him. Bad news: The orphanage is running out of money. Good news: Jrgen, a philanthropist, wants to write the large check that will save it. On one condition: He wants to meet the recipient. The woman who runs the orphanage can't go. Well, Jrgen is Danish, Jacob is Danish. Jacob should go.

Reluctantly, Jacob flies to Denmark. Jrgen listens to his pitch for only a few minutes before seeming to lose interest --- it's the weekend of his daughter's wedding. To which Jacob should come. It's not, after all, like he has anything else to do.

At the wedding, the first surprise: Helene, Jrgen's wife, was once Jacob's lover. In fact, she was the lover who broke his heart. The lover who sent him scurrying off to India, an orphan hiding among orphans.

Other surprises: I'll spare you. And encourage you to read not a word more about the story --- let the twists and turns sear you as they roll out. But I'll go this far: The rich and poor, the white and the colored, Europeans and Indians --- the moral lessons are so easy, aren't they? Or are they? Is Jacob's moral purity really an emblem of superiority? Is Jrgen's privileged life a sign of a rotting soul? You'll judge --- you can't help it --- but when it's over....

When it's over, you'll want to thank director Susanne Bier, a Danish filmmaker whose last film, ""Brothers"", is also a memorably wrenching drama. Mads Mikkelsen --- who plays Jacob (and was the villain in ""Casino Royale"") --- will make you forget all other young actors; he's not only shockingly handsome, he can make reticence and distance both intimate and compelling. And Jrgen, played by Rolf Lassgrd --- when the film ends, you'll find yourself replaying his performance to take note of all that you missed. And was there ever a trophy wife as radiant, loving and thoughtful as Helene (Sidse Babett Knudsen)?

""After the Wedding"" was Denmark's entry for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2007 Academy Awards. It lost to the German film, ""The Lives of Others."" I would have voted differently.

There are DVDs you rent from Netflix. You watch them, you send them back; you got the amusement you paid for. But sometimes, very rarely, there are DVDs you buy. You buy them because you think they define a time in your life. Or because you think you'll want to watch them again. Or --- as is the case here --- because you want to press the film on someone you love and say, ""Here. This. A life-changer.""

""After the Wedding"" took me to places I didn't know I could go to. To places I didn't know I could handle. In fact, I could. My bet is that you can, too.",1184025600,7,3756,4.53698224852071
