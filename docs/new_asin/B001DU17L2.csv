8294906,3,B001DU17L2,"I love all the information that Cydi provides in the dvd, so it was not that bad. However, I would recommend a little more organization, and less repetition. Much of the information about the chakras was repetitious, and I did not appreciate that. Also, the lessons were not clearly defined. I felt left hanging on a few of the lessons, since there was absolutely no conclusion. As a student, I appreciate a well defined ending to the whatever I am learning. I really enjoyed watching most of it, just wish it was not so scattered! Thank you!",1440547200,,542,4.597938144329897

This set of DVDs is a unique resource to use in order to have a better understanding of energy healing and the chakra system. And while you are ordering this as a treat for yourself or a special gift for a friend, I highly recommend any and all of Cyndi's incredibly enlightening and informative books. She is a gifted soul who has chosen to share her knowledge and plethora of incredible information with the world and I feel so lucky to have the opportunity to receive that glorious information.
