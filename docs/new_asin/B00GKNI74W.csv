6081012,4,B00GKNI74W,"I love this collection of six twenty-minute videos. It's great to mix and match them so I don't get bored. They're challenging, but really fun. Best of all, no one in the videos is annoying.",1391040000,4,190,4.457142857142857
6081013,5,B00GKNI74W,"I bought the series of 3 DVDs in this set that include Ultra Burn, Ultra Tight, and Ultra Lean. Each DVD has two 20 minute routines that focus on different parts of the body. This series appealed to me because I have done Cindy Whitmarsh's ""10 Days To A Better Body"" (recommend!) and liked it, and because these were 20 minute workouts-I won't even look at anything that is over 30 minutes and 20 is even better. Sometimes with shorter workouts you sacrifice intensity but that is not the case with these routines. Each exercise set is set up as a circuit or interval that includes cardio and strength training; even the stretch session is one minute of stretch and one minute of strength training. Some of the cardio exercises are higher impact but are easily modifiable; there is a modifier doing exercises in the program but she is not always visible. Even with the low impact modification I worked up a good sweat and got my pulse rate up. About me: I am an intermediate to advanced exerciser but am just getting back into working out after a couple of month hiatus. I was able to do all the exercises straight through without pausing, and in each case did both 20 minute routines on that particular DVD back to back. Since I was unfamiliar with the routines I did use much lighter weights than I would normally use so i could focus on form. Some things to note: almost all of the ""cardio"" circuits in the 6 pack ab section are variations using planks (bear crawls, spider man, variations on mountain climber, plank jacks, etc) and I found this very hard on my wrists although I don't have wrist problems (I may now :) ). Also, unlike in ""10 Days.."" where Cindy was the only exerciser, in this one she has a group exercising with her and she takes the opportunity to stop doing the exercises and walk around to the other exercisers to show or correct form. I understand why this is done but it always irritates me when instructors do this on DVDs. Reviewers have made comments about the contrast between Cindy's facial make up and skin tone in these videos and the comments are correct: she is quite tan but her face looks like it has zinc oxide on it. It is hard to imagine the production team didn't fix this. I found this unfortunate for Cindy but didn't find it as distracting as other reviewers have described.  I am very pleased to have found this workout series and consider it a good addition to my exercise collection.",1389916800,6,2431,4.5
6081014,5,B00GKNI74W,"I started using Ufit exactly one week ago today. It includes 2 programs, but I've focused on the Abs portion of Ufit Ultra Tight. I did this workout once every day for the week (except for the 2nd day which I skipped b/c I was super sore!) Along with beginning this DVD, I began eating right--fruits, veggies, a balanced diet, small portions 6 times a day, and drinking water almost exclusively. I've got results already and it's only been A WEEK! I was only about 10 pounds overweight to begin with, but I've lost 2 pounds and toned muscle. My stomach is noticeably flatter. I even received 2 compliments in the last 2 days: ""Wow! Your tummy is so nice and flat!"" (as they looked at me in awe) and ""You have the nicest legs, Celena!  I couldn't help staring at them!""  First time I've received either compliment since high school.  Great motivation to keep doing what I'm doing! Besides the results, I like Cindy's personality. She's nice and actually does the workouts (I don't go for the trainers who yell at you and don't do the workouts themselves--ahem, Jillian Michaels). The workouts are only 20 minutes--a time slot that can easily fit into anyone's day.",1389744000,4,1163,4.635922330097087

8624137,3,B00GKNI74W,"I love Cindy Whitmarsh and may have given this a better review had it not been for the UFit Team in the DVD's with her.  Her concepts are great and I always love her straightforward approach to fitness but unfortunately there is just too many distractions in these videos to keep me interested.  I still use them but I would rather use her older one-on-one videos or her videos from her exercise TV days than these.  Maybe it is just me but I feel that there is a lack of respect for her displayed by one of her team members.  I assume she is trying to show that they are everyday people like all of us and probably just clowning around and such but seriously folks, this is a professional fitness video.  I am glad they like to have fun but if they are not mic'd up and the audience/video watcher cannot hear what they are saying then maybe do another take or delete them from the video all together.",1429488000,,901,4.276470588235294

8624139,5,B00GKNI74W,"These workouts are very challenging, but very effective!  Cindy is motivating and encouraging - I wish she had more DVDs out there.  I like the music countdown too, so you can push through knowing the end is near.  20 minutes is doable for everyone and you can mix and match whatever you're in the mood for that day.  I highly recommend these dvds - minimal equipment - just hand weights really - and varied routines for an efficient workout!  Great job Cindy!  Love these!",1404604800,,473,4.571428571428571
8624140,5,B00GKNI74W,Cindy is great!  She motivates you and gets you moving.  Moves that look easy aren't as easy as you think.  Love these workouts.  Not for beginners.,1400803200,,148,4.576923076923077
8624141,5,B00GKNI74W,"I have Cindy's 10 Days to a Better Body, which I like but if you want to work your whole body it is an hour + workout, and I don't have that much time. I love that these workouts are short, but you will be sore the next day. And you will sweat while doing them. Another plus is the minimal amount of equipment required ... I use one set of dumbbells (5 pounds) and I also do use a step with a mat on top to make some of the mountain climbers/burpees a little easier. These worksouts are hard but do-able. There is a modifier who actually modifies, which seems to be more and more unusual in exercise dvds these days. The women in the workout look like they are ""real"" women (not fitness professionals) who have worked hard for their bodies. It is motivating, fun, and everyone can fit in 20 minutes at least most days of the week. Best workout DVDS I have purchased in a long time.",1398816000,5,881,4.157894736842105
8624142,5,B00GKNI74W,"Good workout & I like the fact of that it is broken down into 20 minute segments. Also the counting down is a plus when you are doing more challenging segments to signal that the ""end is near""!",1398384000,,193,4.105263157894737
8624143,5,B00GKNI74W,"I love Cindy Whitmarsh! These DVDs are great because they are quick and to the point. They are challenging but possible. I'm not very fit so I have to do some of the modifications, but I do it. Cindy is a great instructor and her enthusiasm is contagious. I highly reccomend this series.",1395964800,,287,4.433962264150943
8624144,5,B00GKNI74W,"I have loved Cindy since the Barry's Bootcamp dvds and these 3 new workouts are so much fun!!I love that you can do 1 quick 20 minute workout or string several together for a great sweaty workout! The 20 minute format may not sound like enough,but when I'm pressed for time,I like that I can just do a quick sweat session and not feel guilty. I had preordered these before I even read any reviews and was not disappointed,unlike several other dvds that I also preordered and hated(Amy Dixon's Raise some Bell and Kelly Coffey Meyer's Shape Up).I know some people gave this set bad reviews because of Cindy's makeup and fake tan,which I think is ridiculous. When I rate a dvd,I do so based on the workout,not on what kind of makeup the instructor wears!!Take it from me,these are so much fun-I have a ton of workout dvds and if I use one once and don't like it,it gets sent back-I don't believe in wasting my time with a bad workout.",1392854400,3,932,4.424418604651163
