It looked kind of dark, maybe is just because is an old movie, but because was an oldie he really wanted to see this movie and enjoyed it.",1286150400,,313,3.9682539682539684
1421254,4,B00005B6JX,"""Breathing Fire"" bears striking similarities to Ng See-Yuen's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Retreat-No-Surrender/dp/B0002848WQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Retreat, No Surrender</a>&nbsp;trilogy and its additional installments (e.g.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-King-of-the-Kickboxers/dp/6302128161/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The King of the Kickboxers</a>) - so many that if you're curious enough, you'll check to see if anybody who worked on the former was involved in this one. No Ng See-Yuen or Corey Yuen to be found in the cast list, but producer Brandon Pender worked on the action content of the original NRNS, so one can assume that he's responsible for the resemblances in production, dramatic content, and martial arts action. I can't imagine that you haven't seen any of the aforementioned movies if you've managed to locate this one, so chances are that you'll know what to expect.

The story: socialite Michael Moore (Jerry Trimble,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Master/dp/B000067J48/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Master</a>) is a respectable father in the public eye, but unbeknownst to his kickboxing sons Charlie (Jonathan Ke Quan,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom/dp/B00009ZWAB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</a>) and Tony (Eddie Saavedra), his wealth is the product of bank robberies. When he murders a partner following a major heist, the man's daughter (Laura Hamilton) finds shelter among Moore's sons, who must learn a powerful style of kung fu from their uncle David (Ed Neil,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mighty-Morphin-Power-Rangers/dp/B008XRE81E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mighty Morphin Power Rangers</a>) to protect the girl and themselves from their father's henchmen.

Having Bolo Yeung (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodsport/dp/B00006RCOC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodsport</a>) on the cover of the DVD is extremely misleading: while he's arguably the biggest star of the ensemble and does get a respectable number of fight scenes, he's nevertheless just a thug in Jerry Trimble's gang. Heck, the first time you see him he's actually dressed in drag, shortly after which he stuffs a bank manager's head down a toilet. This buffoonish tone remains consistent throughout the film: Charlie and Tony manage to turn a wall-painting chore into a dance contest a'la&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tom-Sawyer/dp/0451528646/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tom Sawyer</a>, their friend Mickey (T.J. Storm) channels R.J. Madison via a dead-on Michael Jackson imitation in a club, the brothers train by punching phonebooks and attacking watermelons, later getting attacked in a bar by a trio of little people... Oh, and then there's aftermath of the bank heist, wherein the robbers make an impression of a vault key in pizza dough for security purposes, inevitably leading to a climatic fight over a piece of it. No, don't bother scratching your head - I don't get it either, but rest assured, you'd better be up for a laugh if you commit yourself to this movie.

The martial arts content isn't quite as bombastic as the See-Yuen movies but are still well shot and creative, with plenty of opportunity for Jonathan Short Round to show off his hitherto-unshowcased tae kwon do abilities. Bolo and Jerry also are more than serviceable, but the surprise physical performances come from no-name stars like Eddie Saavera, henchman Allen Tackett, and Ed Neil as the screwup kung fu master. There's no wirework but plenty of jumping kicks, flipping and spinning, and people getting thrown through windows and tables - all finely choreographed and with minimal doubling. The only falling point here is that most of the fights are relatively short. Luckily, the best fight of the bunch - the end battle - features none of these hiccups and sends you home with a newfound respect for the performers.

I didn't necessarily like the film's climax, which involves a backstory regarding Charlie's parentage and Michael turning a complete 180 to make sure you don't feel sorry about his fate. Also, the Echo Bridge DVD release of this film is in no state to impress: it's clearly been transferred directly from a VHS copy, leaving the picture looking muddy and the frame rate noticeably impaired during the action scenes; get the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Westlake-Entertainment-version/dp/B0000B0JID/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Westlake Entertainment version</a>&nbsp;if you can. Nevertheless, it's a fun enough karate flick if you're into this kind of stuff, so if you've watched all of the NRNS sequels and are still hungry for more, this is about as close as you'll get to the real thing.",1273708800,,5037,6.468842729970326
1421255,5,B00005B6JX,"Imagine this: A child of age 8 is taken from a third world country who has never seen a movie and probably never been told a decent story. He is shown a decent kung fu movie that may have appeared on disney channel. The child is never shown another movie or told another story for 10 years. When he is 18 he is asked to recall the decent kung fu movie he was shown 10 years ago and remake it as best as he can.
Breathing Fire is that movie.

Awful dialogue, check.
Horrendous editing, check.
Terribad acting, check.
And the plot? They're all fighting over a plastic piece of pizza.

This movie is good for a laugh. Only worth the low price you can get it for online.

I will mention, if you've seen this on VHS and saw the fight scene in the dance club and laughed at how bad it was due to the editor's incomprehension of upper and lower frames, that scene has been fixed on DVD.",1260748800,,879,4.128654970760234
1421256,5,B00005B6JX,This is the greatest movie ever. What's ironic is there is a character who is Vietnamese and his name is Charlie. There's plenty more to comment on but I would be here all night. It was very entertaining.,1200009600,,204,4.394736842105263
1421257,3,B00005B6JX,"Breathing Fire is a super cheesy martial arts films, set in the tradition of the ""No Retreat No Surrender"" movies.  There is the similar poor acting, cheesy characters, cheap music, cheesy sound effects, and actually lots of cool looking cheesy fights.  Breathing Fire though still doesn't feel as enjoyable as No Retreat No Surrender, and ends up just being rather cheesy in a bad way.  The fights are not as fun and the charcaters are not as enjoyable.  The only two standouts that are memorable, are of course Bolo Yeung and Jonathan Ke Quan - simply for his famous role as Short Round in Temple of Doom and his role in The Goonies.

This movie is basically inconsistent.  It has an original story that actually has a bit of a complex plot for these types of movies.  It is about 2 brothers - Charlie and Tony - who live together with their father (Jerry Trimble)  who is secretly in the business of robbing and stealing.  We know this in the beginning of the film, but they do not learn about it till much later.  In the meantime, one of the men that worked for their father, decides he wants out, and in return the rest of the gang kill him and his wife, leaving an orphaned daughter.  She seeks out help from a man who is actually the father's brother, and he takes her to live with the 2 brothers and their father.  While the story is a bit interesting, it is filled with goofy moments throughout, as well as horrible acting that is some of the worst I ever seen.  Fights are good, but in the cheesy manner, as most look very fake, but still manage to entertain.

As for Bolo Yeung's performance, his first appearance in this film is classic - dressed like an old lady while he and the rest of the gang are ready to rob a bank.  He has a few fights in this movie, but most are dissapointing and weaker than in most of his films.  He doesn't really get enough chances to make his presence known, but he is still fun to watch when it is his turn.

Basically and over-all supercheese-fest that is not the classic fun-filled cheese like No Retreat No Surrender.  Its still fun at times, and it does have Bolo Yeung and everyone's favorite boy from the Temple of Doom who is now an older teenager.  Expect a movie with no realism whatsoever.",1184371200,,2243,4.374396135265701
1421258,4,B00005B6JX,"This is a good martial arts movie which in my opinion is a 90's classic. This is the plot of the movie. After their bank robbing father (Jerry 'Pretty Boy' Trimble) and his companions kill a couple who were tied up with the gang's latest robbery and threaten the fleeing daughter. A young man and his adopted brother who are top competitors use their martial arts skills to help their father's brother David, an ex-soldier with a talent for violence (Ed Neil). The brothers decide to help David defend the girl after he is injured during a brawl with the gangs leader and agrees to take on the brothers as his students and teaches them his style of martial arts. The brothers then start making their own investigation which leads them to a pretty cool twist at the end of the movie. Good fight scenes with some good actors and I like the theme music as the fight scenes appear. The final fight at the tournament is a must-watch (if you can't be bothered going through the rest of the movie) because it is the most exsplosive fight scene of the film where the two brother's meet head -on.",1132099200,2,1087,4.467336683417085
1421259,1,B00005B6JX,"This film deserves 1 star or even 0 stars if there was such a rating.  The storyline is corny, unbelievable and lacks common sense.  The acting is terrible and the direction is worse.  I suppose the martial arts is mediocre.  But seriously, there are WAY better kickboxing movies out there.

Don't waste your money on this one.  Go buy yourself a couple slices of a REAL pizza...",1099785600,,379,4.582089552238806
1421260,5,B00005B6JX,"I picked this DVD up for @ $10, and it was worth it! 2 complete films, w/some special features, such as photo gallery, chapters, etc...
As for the films, themselves, Breathing Fire was a good story - two brothers who try to foil bank robbers w/the help of their uncle, a martial artist. Bolo Yeung was, of course, one of the robbers - seeing him in a dress made it worth watching right there! There was lots of action, with numerous fight scenes, and betrayal and backstabbing. All through the story, one of the boys, a Vietnamese, searches for his roots, though he may not care for what he finds.
In Blood Fight, we see through the eyes of Kai as he re-lives what brought him to the finals of the Free Fighting Tournament- where he is about to face Chang Lee (Bolo Yeung). Lee killed Kai's student at a previous tournament, and now Kai seeks revenge. The tournament fighting is vastly different from Bloodsport - the first fights are often comical - I loved it! And the final fight is longer and much more dramatic - it deserves the name Blood Fight.
These films really enhanced my appreciation for Bolo Yeung's acting and fighting abilities. I think you'd enjoy them, too.",1063065600,2,1174,4.5424528301886795

1421271,3,B00005B6JX,"I've been through a few dvd versions of this
movie. Reason was what ""Thadeus"" the first
reviewer mentioned. The dance club scene. This
is the correct version to buy. Finally. I'm
guessing this was shot as video. As I preyed
for a progressive scan movie. Oh well.

If you couldn't get enough Tae Kwan Do from
movies like Best of the Best, then give this
a try. Last fight scene is worth admission.
Also, not sure but Cory Yuen, Jet Li's fight
Hollywood cheorographer might of designed
the fights. His name is credited slightly
different. Oh yeah, this the only movie you
will see John Ke Quan(Indiana Jones TOD),
kick butt like never before and after...
He truely is a TKD master.

3 stars for simple dvd transfer. And don't
complain about the sound. At times, it worse
then home made. This movie was made for
peanuts. Music is very good at times though.
Might be the guy who did Bloodsport and
Kickboxer.",1298505600,,904,4.539877300613497

7936910,3,B00005B6JX,"The review by Thadeus is pretty much spot on. This is five star garbage all the way, a movie that 'chop-sockey' fans would probably file under the 'so bad it's good' category. And you do get to see Bolo Yeung in drag. Yes that really happens.

Anyway, there isn't really a lot for the viewer to hang their hat on here, the dialogue and acting are abominable. The transfer from video looks like a straight transfer (it's not like you'd pay any money to clean anything up) and the plot is barely there at all. In essence (spoiler alert) some cons get their hands on a safe full of money and make moulds of the key in a piece of plastic pizza which is then cut up so that none of them can double cross the other. The king-pin bad guy has two sons - one his natural son and one an adopted Vietnamese kid. They are both pretty handy with their fists and get drawn into the situation. And yep, we have a training montage that when you think about it couldn't possibly be done in the time allotted. But hey, it's a martial arts flick so as Team America said, you need a montage....

After a bunch of fairly straight forward and actually comical karate/tae-kwon-do scenes with some over the top yelling etc the whole thing is resolved fairly easily and actually somewhat pleasingly. There is even some genuine nastiness.

If you see this really cheap and you are into this sort of thing then you might as well, there are plenty of worse movies out there and at least the actors aren't dubbed hilariously and are speaking their actual own language (English in this case). Set you expectations low and you'll come out OK.",1502496000,,1611,4.417508417508418
