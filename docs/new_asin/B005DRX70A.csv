I find them a welcome change from most documentaries in that they bring rare footage and facts and introduce a DIFFERENT and INDEPENDENT angle on history and world events irregardless of how it may conflict with most textbooks that are spoon fed to us throughout our school years. Many of the angles taken by Chris Everard are shared or originated by other writer/researchers and Everard gives them their due credit in opening his eyes to the world's elite. At the same time, he uses footage of old movies, news etc to create a dramatic and entertaining background to keep the viewer from falling asleep from fact overload. This may be a turn off to some viewers, but not to me. For someone looking for an intelligent and engaging view into  what is behind our world's chaotic organization, definitely get these. Or, just take the blue pill and believe whatever you want to believe.",1315872000,7,977,4.781065088757397
