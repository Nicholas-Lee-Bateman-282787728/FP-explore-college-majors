7199812,4,B00XV31RZA,This Blu-Ray disc has issues; the release has been postponed from 7/29/15 to 9/8/15. There's an exchange program being put into place for those who wind up with this version. What's wrong with it? Vertical stretching that makes everyone look taller and thinner than they should. The colors are also a little more green. Criterion have stated that they will indicate which version is the corrected one by printing Second Printing' on the back of the cover packaging.,1439251200,99,465,4.9743589743589745
7199813,5,B00XV31RZA,dressed to kill I gave a five star rating because it was excellent movie,1458345600,,72,4.214285714285714
7199814,1,B00XV31RZA,"One of my all-time favorites but unfortunately even after this DVD  Blu-ray had been corrected  I still got one of the bad ones. The company was very nice enough to allow me to return it boil boy I'm afraid to buy it again because you have the time to go through it why can't they just destroy all the bad copies?
UPDATE: Tried again - got the bad copy again.  I give up.  Great idea, too bad it's impossible to get Criterion to DESTROY the bad copy and keep the new copy - I've never seen it.  Maybe I""ll try again in 2018 - maybe they need to re-release so that there is a clear path to the proper copy - this is MADNESS - not in the good DePalma way.",1453334400,2,653,3.954198473282443
7199815,5,B00XV31RZA,"This movie is so good. De Palma at his absolute best. He's most known for his gangster movies (Scarface, Carlito's Way), but there's so much more to De Palma than that. Nobody can work a camera like him. Those close-ups, those pans, those dolly shots. The guy is a master.",1451692800,,272,4.46
7199816,4,B00XV31RZA,"Dressed to Kill is one of Brian De Palma's all-time classics.  Never has Angie Dickerson looked more beautiful, or Michael Caine so suave and debonair in his expensive suits.  The lighting, the quick cuts, the multi-frames, the sudden surprises, the music that brings back memories of Hitchcock's Psycho, and the great casts..all of this works for me in the most profound way, even when it shouldn't.  You find yourself ignoring the implausible elements and, instead, focusing on the story line, wanting to know who the killer is.

Dressed to Kill is about Kate Miller (Angie Dickerson) who is frustrated with her life as a suburban housewife.  She's especially upset with her husband (her son's step-father) and his quick sexual releases.  She's starting to feel unattractive (this is certainly one of those implausible elements) and needs an affair to brighten up her daily mood.  She has one, too.  Unfortunately, it doesn't end the way she expected.  Through a trail of various circumstances, she finds herself in an elevator, going back up to her lover's floor in the high-rise apartment building.  When the elevator doors finally slide open, Angie is unexpectedly sliced apart by a mysterious blonde female holding a straight razor and wearing a black leather coat, gloves, and sunglasses.

Angie's son, played by Keith Gordon (Christine) wants revenge against the person who killed his mom.  He enlists the help of a call girl that's played wickedly by Nancy Allen.  Nancy's character caught a brief glimpse of the murderer in the elevator before the doors closed.  Together, they attempt to avoid the police (Dennis Franz) and to lure the killer into a trap, using Nancy as the bait.

For me this was a fun movie from beginning to end.  I first saw it at the theaters when it originally came out.  I've since watched it on video and DVD.  The movie still holds up pretty good to be as old as it is.  Part of this is due to the superb acting in it.  You really care about Angie Dickerson's character and find yourself wiped out by her sudden and horrible death only twenty minutes into the film.  Even to this day, I've never been able to watch Angie being killed with a razor blade.  It's simply too horrific for me.  I had a crush on her for the longest time so naturally I didn't want to see my idol die.  I mean she was Pepper in Police Story.

Michael Caine as Dr. Elliot (Kate Miller's psychiatrist) makes me want to get one my own so I can talk out my many problems.  He's utterly believable as the doctor who sincerely cares about his patients.  I also love his British accent.

The characters played by Keith Gordon, Nancy Allen and Dennis Franz turn in solid acting performances that carry through to the end of the movie.  It's Dickerson and Caine, however, who really steal the show.  I mean what normal, red-blooded male wouldn't want to be in the back seat of a New York taxi, making out with Angie Dickerson.

The extras that were on the edition I purchased had already been on previous ones over the years.  I didn't see anything new that was added.  Also, and I've had a gripe about this for decades, the poster really has nothing to do with the movie.  It's certainly an enticing poster and captures your attention, but you don't see Angie or Nancy putting on a pair of dark stockings anywhere in the film.  Nancy wears some stockings and garters in the last part of the film, but you don't see her putting them on.  False media advertising!  I want my money back.

All in all, a great 80's film that has become a cult classic and shows the lovely Angie Dickerson at her finest.",1449878400,5,3603,4.63349131121643
7199817,3,B00XV31RZA,"Kinda disappointed. After seeing what can be achieved with an old movie on blu ray I.e. Jaws, this edition left me underwhelmed and wanting. It doesn't seem like a major improvement over the MGM release. I thought criterion was supposed to he the creme de la creme for movie restoration. Well, some scenes look great, while others look grainy. Maybe since its mastered in 4k, if I watch it on a 4k tv it will look great. But still, the best job of restoring an old movie on blu ray goes to Universal for Jaws, Psycho, and others.",1449532800,,529,4.408163265306122

I had such a good time the first weekend that I went back again the second weekend. Both screenings were packed with a loud, engaged audience, giggling and shrieking. We all left at the end with big smiles on our faces.

I waited to make sure I got the second edition Criterion. It's really hard to find those tiny words on the box, but it's well worth the hunt.

7199823,5,B00XV31RZA,"I knew after the outrage in August that Criterion had somehow stretched the image of their first group of Blu-ray releases of DTK, that a company with their reputation would address the issue at hand and correct it quickly! What we have now have is a release that is stellar, IMHO! The disc still has the MGM lion at the start, but what we also have now is the original Filmways Picture logo, that was on display during the movie's initial theatrical and HBO release! This may sound like a minor detail, but to a collector or fan it is noteworthy!
The video and audio presentation are exemplary! There are no issues with the video quality, although it is slightly paler than the MGM release in 2008! It is the audio that really impressed me most of all. The original mono soundtrack is the only option and it is presented in PCM! The track has balls! The supplements are great too!

I just LOVE LOVE LOVE this film. Everything clicks in this, the cast is dynamic. Brian DePalma at his directing best. Dennis Franz is outstanding as a cop, Keith Gordon is terrific as the vengeful youth looking for his mothers killer.
Extras are loaded with supplements from the previous MGM blu ray and some new ones. This Criterion release (make sure you get the SECOND PRESSING) is outstanding. I found the PQ outstanding, and with the extras this is a very much worthwhile ! Recommended !",1442966400,5,637,4.646017699115045
7199826,5,B00XV31RZA,"I'm one of those Lucky fans that bought the second pressing of this new Dressed to kill blu-ray by Criterion collection
and i tell you there's no fault with my Disc, no fault at all
i tested the Disc & played the film, no problems with the film at all
infact this new 4k restored transfer in 2:35:1 widescreen supervised by Brian De palma himself as it says in the booklet in the case
the transfer looks fantastic
no Grain or Dirt in the quality, much sharper & clearer picture than the 2011 MGM blu-ray release no Doubt about it
probably the best the film has ever looked actually so i guess Brian did supervise the transfer for this blu-ray version
unfortunately thou criterion didn't do the same for the sound quality
there's no 5.1 master audio mix, infact there's only one fixed Audio mix Mono sound
there's no other Audio options which annoyed me alot there should be at least 2 options for the Audio
but for some reason Criterion did not add an extra option
now to the special features
Criterion made a lot of effort getting new extras that's for sure
all new interviews just for this blu-ray release i was amazed
new interview with Brian De palma-20mins, Nancy Allen-15mins, producer George Litto-10mins
shower scene body double Victoria lynn Johnson-8mins, Art Director/Poster photographer Stephen Sayadian-9mins
and new interview with music composer Pino Donaggio
plus a new interview filmmaker Michael Apted talking about cinematographer Ralf Bode
if played altogether the Duration will be roughly 80mins of new interviews
but all the interviews can only be played seperatly
Criterion also added on all the special features from the original 2001 dvd release
so you get the usual 40mins retrospective making of Doco
plus the Keith Gordon featurette, plus the Pieces featurette where both versions the R rated & Unrated version
are talked about and compared
plus the storyboards by Brian De palma, and of course the original Theatrical trailer
all this content on 1 Disc, incredible!
so i do believe this criterion blu-ray is the Definitive version of Dressed to kill, No Doubt about it
for the U.K. fans this blu-ray is region A locked, so you'll need all regions player
5 stars for this new criterion blu-ray worth the money for sure",1442793600,18,2245,4.848958333333333

The movie looks amazing, like it was made yesterday. Some scenes are noticeably softer than others but this is always the case for Dressed the Kill because these moments are designed have a dream like quality to them.  This is one of my favorite horror movies and I have owned countless copies over the years, on VHS and DVD and this is the first time I have seen it at home without a grainy older looking picture.

7199830,4,B00XV31RZA,"When Brian DePalma's thriller, ""Dressed to Kill"" first opened in 1980, it was condemned by some reviewers and feminist groups as nothing more than a bloody, misogynistic stew of soft-core porn and damsel-in-distress horror. With no small thanks to Pauline Kael, the New Yorkers estimable film critic at the time, Dressed to Kill, DePalmas most prurient Hitchcock nod to date, became a box office hit with a reputation that has only grown in the ensuing years. This new Criterion release signals that the film is finally getting the attention some fans feel it justly deserves. The initial Criterion Blu-Ray pressing of Dressed to Kill encountered some serious problems, but Im happy to report theyve been corrected in the second pressing, which was made available to the public on September 8, 2014. Please note: if you plan on purchasing the Criterion edition of Dressed to Kill, make certain that you have the second pressing. Unfortunately, the only way to determine this for sure is located on the disc itself, which has the words second pressing, easily missed, among a string of other words in tiny print. At any rate, the movie looks great now, with the sensuously muted interiors of the characters fantasy lives a stark contrast to the messy, sometimes deadly, sharp coldness of reality. The extras on the Criterion release include new interviews with Nancy Allen, Pino Donaggio and film producer George Litto, a 2001 documentary on the making of the film, a chat with DePalma and Noah Baumbach and a fascinating critical essay by Michael Koresky. If you have not seen the film and aren't familiar with everything that happens, do not watch/read the extra material before watching it because there are spoilers galore.

With all due respect to DePalmas cinematic infatuation with Hitchcock, Dressed to Kill also incorporates many of the tropes of giallo cinema, that ultra-stylish blend of sex, violence and crime popularized by Italian filmmakers of the 70s and 80s. I think its important to point out that some of those giallos trod a much finer line regarding the treatment of women than Dressed to Kill ever does (particularly Lamberto Bavas dreadful Blade In the Dark, which simply reconstructs the more violent elements of DePalmas oeuvre and regurgitates them in a distasteful display of genuine misogyny).  Dressed to Kill is also often cited as a horror film, although I think thats a misnomer; yes, its scary and theres a scene that was considered quite gory at the time, but it plays out more as a suspenseful mystery (even though the killers identity won't come as a surprise to alert viewers).

For anyone still not familiar with the (rather dubious) plotline, Dressed to Kill is a story of murder and madness, and of multiples: multiple blondes, multiple personalities, multiple camera angles and multiple screens. The venerable Michael Caine is on hand as kindly, uptight Dr. Elliott, a successful Manhattan psychiatrist who loses one patient to a vicious murderer who may turn out to be another of his patients. Angie Dickinson, famous at the time as TVs Police Woman, plays a suburban housewife so distracted by her disappointments and desires that she mislays or loses everything. Locked in an unsatisfying marriage, Dickinsons Kate Miller is the essence of perfectly coiffed, well-to-do desperation. Her pent-up sexuality has her so rigid that she seems ever on the verge of exploding out of her own skin; shes stretched out so tight with longing in Dr. Elliotts office that she actually propositions him. Indeed, when a stranger finally picks her up (much to her relief) at New Yorks Metropolitan Museum of Art (actually shot in Philadelphia) and whisks her away in a taxi, Kates long-repressed explosion comes roaring out in shrieks of ecstasy when the stranger sprawls her out on the back seat and gives her a quick overhaul. Once they arrive at the mans apartment building, he practically has to lift her out of the taxi, shes so discombobulated by the release shes been denied for so long. That whole taxi ride is a funny sequence that comes after a long, winding, intense cat-and-mouse seduction/chase through the museum. Kate flirts with the man and then drops her glove in confusion when he walks away; while Kate and the stranger take turns pursuing one another to the haunting strains of Pino Donaggios swirling score, Kates lost glove becomes the Hitchcockian MacGuffin of the scene. Interestingly enough, by the time the lost glove leads her into the arms of the stranger, now waiting in the taxi, she has already lost her other glove, which ends up in the hands of someone with far darker impulses. In short order, Kate also manages to lose her panties (in the back of the taxi) and her wedding ring (in the strangers apartment). In fact, shed have fared better if shed simply let the ring go altogether, especially after she snoops through the sleeping strangers desk and discovers a letter from the health department informing him that hes contracted a venereal disease. Kates mortified, panicked elevator ride from the apartment down to the lobby comes to an abrupt halt when she realizes that the ring is not on her finger. Back up she goes and it is not the handsome, venereal-diseased stranger waiting for her when the elevator doors open. In a shocker of a scene (maybe less so today, given the horrors unfolding on even network TV shows), Kate is sliced and diced by an Amazonian, razor-wielding blonde dressed up in a dark trenchcoat, sunglasses and black gloves (all nods to the giallo genre). At this point, we meet blonde, high-end escort, Liz Blake (charmingly played by Nancy Allen) who spots the killer, in a convex mirror, wielding a bloody razor in a corner of the elevator. When homicide cop Dennis Franz appears about to pin the murder on her, Liz hooks up with Kates teen-age son, Peter, a technical whiz-kid whos already been doing some investigating on his own. Trying to solve the crime before Liz is arrested (or killed, since it appears that the murderer is now hot on her tail) they make a great duo, coming across as a sort of smutty Nancy Drew and nerd-hero Hardy Boy.

The acting in Dressed to Kill is fine and doesnt interfere with DePalmas bombastic directional flair. Angie Dickinson, who doesnt look much different than she did in her westerns with John Wayne 20 years earlier, is glamorous, understated and believably hemmed-in as Kate Miller. Shes also very likeable (especially in her scenes with her teen-age son) and vulnerable (in almost all her other scenes). Michael Caines subtle humor in his portrayal of Dr. Elliott is balanced by the fleeting fear projected by his growing suspicions that things have gone seriously awry with one of his his patients. At times, Elliott appears almost as uptight and repressed as Kate Miller, evidenced by his quick, tight, pained expressions when hes put on the spot, both by two of the blondes in the story, and by the aggressive cop.  As Liz Blake, Nancy Allen, looks like a kewpie doll and uses that to her advantage. I liked her in two other DePalma films, as the head mean girl in Carrie and as the dim but sweet-natured doomed girl in Blow-Out, although here shes both nice and smart, and her All-American know-how and good looks, combined with her kinkier aspects, add a layer of naughty allure that titillates her clients and adds to her growing business portfolio. Wisely, DePalma portrays the situation between Liz and young Peter as an innocent, sibling-type relationship. That pairing really works, and Keith Gordon plays Peter with a sincere, brainy sweetness thats never cloying yet never feels false. This isn't a tear-jerking melodrama, its an erotic thriller after all, and the young actor keeps this in mind and doesnt overdo the grief-stricken son shtick while assaying his role.  As the rude and crude cop, Marino, Dennis Franz is funny and offensive to everyone in the movie, and he commands your attention in every scene hes in. Dressed to Kill was filmed before Franz was a well-known star but his screen presence is striking, his performance broad and amusing.

Finally, criticism of the plot of Dressed to Kill and its numerous, WTF meanderings is almost beside the point. Yes, it is filled with profound lapses in logic. With everyone running hither and yon, various blondes chasing around nighttime Manhattan carrying lethal weapons or trying to avoid them; coincidences and foreknowledge that defies credibility; gum-chomping, smart-mouth cops; immediately-available cabbies (in New York!) and an ending cribbed from one of DePalmas own films, there is no reason this movie should work. Its like the dark version of a screwball comedy, but a screwball thriller, that does eventually succeed because of the audacious, high-flying theatrics of Brian DePalma and his swooning camera techniques that generate suspense and unease; Pino Donaggios seductive use of music that lulls, woos and jolts viewers; and the fun, energetic cast who never take things too seriously, which would have been a fatal mistake with this film. Dressed to Kill is DePalma as Pop Artist: its an eye-popping color palette of imagery, sex and dread, suffused with all the alliterations weve come to expect from the man.",1442102400,19,9236,4.977979274611399

NOW... back to the Blu Ray... does it look better than the original yes, but for me the bonus features on this have reached a new level!  ALL the bonus features (around an hour total) from the previous Blu Ray and special edition DVD have been thankfully put on this release , and that is no longer a given so appreciation to Criterion is deserved.  Now on to the new supplements ...  a 20 minute interview with De Palma is terrific, the new interview with the body double Penthouse Pet of the Year Victoria Lynn Johnson, is a treat as well. Producer George Litto makes for a good interview but easily bested by the new interview with Nancy Allen. The three that really caught me by surprise and I enjoyed were with legendary composer (subtitled) Pino Donaggio, and the producer of the famous one sheet Stephen Sayadian, as well as the tribute to the cinematographer Ralf Bode by Michael Apted and others.  I'm not about to go into details of these wonderful interviews and tributes , why spoil the fun?  Suffice it to say if you have the current edition of this film on Blu Ray and are wondering if a ""double dip"" is worth it.... well, It isn't even close for me, the wealth of bonus material should come with college credit they are so definitive.  The movie itself?  I saw it in theaters in my early 20's when it initially was released and it seemed the perfect combination of thrills, suspense, comedy, sex, .... goodness , my friends and I quote some of Dennis Franz's lines to this day.... he blossomed in this part and began to develop his snarky gum chewing cop.

This story takes place in New York city. A married woman, Kate Miller, visits her psychiatrist to discuss her emotional problems. [Sinful desires?] Later she visits a museum. She sees a man with her lost gloves in a taxi, and joins him. Later she finds his health report of contagious diseases. [Didn't he commit a crime?] Upon her return home, a strange tall woman enters her elevator and waves a razor. A young woman sees the body! The police later call on Dr. Elliott. Miss Liz Blake is questioned by the police, they don't believe her story. Kate Miller's son plays detective in keeping watch on the patients at Dr. Elliott's office. Miss Blake sees that tall blonde woman watching her as she leaves. Blake runs into the subway. An attack on her is foiled by Kate Miller's son Peter! [Believable?] The son used a hidden camera to take pictures of Dr. Elliott's patients. Liz Blake visits Dr. Elliott to get emotional help. She takes off her coat (she is dressed for warm weather). Outside Peter sees that tall blonde woman and tries to warn Miss Blake! Can she be saved? Yes; and we learn what was going on from the police detective.

Dr. Levy explains the reason for the crimes: psychosexual conflicts. What will happen to this psycho killer? We are told. Liz Blake speaks to Peter Miller, she wants a vacation. Will there be a surprise at the end? Yes! Will it remind you of that shower scene in the 1959 movie ""Psycho""? Will this nightmare ever end?

Brian de Palma has been accused (or credited) with imitating the style and movies of Alfred Hitchcock. Copying from a master is surely good training for anyone.

8716666,3,B00XV31RZA,"Review of Dressed to Kill
Hot Toasty Rag, November 29, 2017

If I were dissatisfied with my marriage and Michael Caine was my therapist, Id probably have a crush on him. Apparently, Angie Dickinson agrees with me, for in Dressed to Kill, she hits on him during a session. Shes married to Keith Gordon, and dislikes many aspects of their marriage, including their bedroom activities. When Michael rebuffs her advances, she looks elsewhere.

Dressed to Kill, while completely earning its R ratingit was originally rated X before certain elements were cutis a very fun thriller. Depending on how comfortable you are in your relationship, this might be a good pick to watch during your steamy movie night. Brian De Palmas script will keep you guessing from start to finish, and youll be on the edge of your seat once the serial killer makes an appearance and bodies start dropping. It can be pretty scary at times, but if you like this type of movie, its a really great one. Im a bit of a lightweight when it comes to scary movies, but Im also a huge Michael Caine fan, so I ended up liking it.

Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to graphic nudity, sex scenes,  and violence, I wouldnt let my kids watch it.",1511913600,,1249,4.638009049773756
