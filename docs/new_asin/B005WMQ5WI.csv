4899810,5,B005WMQ5WI,"Finally found this anime! I saw a music video (Legalize I think the name of the band was) when I was in Russia and thought that it was a cool song and it was a pretty neat looking anime but I didn't really know where to find this type of thing there. When I got state side again I tried like hell to find this but could not find it anywhere on the internet. I had givin up hope of seeing this until one day I logged onto amazon and it was in my recommendations. I was like :D but then I read the reviews and I was more like :| but I figured hey its 2$. I personally felt like the interviews and commentary from the ""vets"" was a nice touch and really gave the story a unique feel and added to my willing suspension of disbelief, it reminded me of why I am a fan of anime still at 29.",1328745600,,782,3.8333333333333335
4899811,4,B005WMQ5WI,"I was turned off by other reviews talking about ""live action"" mockumentary sequences.  These must have been in an earlier version.  The version I watched from netflix was pure anime.  I may be giving it higher marks since I have no idea what this ""live action"" footage is all about.  The version I saw had English, Japanese & Russian language tracks, i chose to watch in Russian, assuming that's how the Russian producers envisioned it.  It's a great start to what, hopefully, could be a series someday.  As others have mentioned, it feels like a pilot for a new series.  Hopefully we'll see more of Nadya, Colonel Below, & Nadya's dead comrades in the future. All in all it did seem like an unfinished experience, now I'd like to see the original cut with the live action ""interviews"" included, simply for reference.  A great start to something, but fans will long for more.  The ending does leave you feeling cheated, but the 50 minutes or so before that is really fun & quite visually stunning.",1327708800,7,997,4.651428571428571
4899812,3,B005WMQ5WI,"""First Squad"" has been on my must-buy list for quite some time now, mainly because it's subject matter intrigued me. The animation is handled by Studio 4C, whose pedigree is quite impressive and includes some classic titles like ""Tikkon Kinkreet"" and ""Tweeny Witches."" It's also one of the rare standalone anime films that gets a US release without having any attachment to a major franchise or genre. Last time I saw a movie come this out of left field was ""Strait Jacket"", which I absolutely adored. So after months of wait and a barely promoted release, the movie was of course a first-day purchase for me. But maybe I should've waited until some more reviews came in, because ""First Squad"" is one of the most frustrating anime films I've ever seen.

It's not that this Russian/Japanese co-production is what one could fairly call ""bad."" At it's very core, the plot which drives ""First Squad"" forward is quite a unique one. In the middle of World War II, Nadya is a 14 year-old psychic, the last from an elite squadron comprised of four other children. When the Russians begin to overtake Germany, the Nazis resort to calling in an undead army of 12'th century crusaders to come and wipe out their ""oppressor"", then proceed to merge the land of the dead and the land of the living. This would bring time itself to a standstill, bringing an end to all history past, present and future. In order to stop this from happening, the Russians enlist Nadya to travel to the realm of the dead and call the rest of her former squad back to life. Together, they may be able to stand a chance against the undead masses.

People expecting this to culminate in any sort of epic final battle, though, are going to be sorely let down. ""First Squad""'s climax, if it can even be called that, is among the laziest and most unsatisfying I've ever experienced. When everything is in place, and all of the characters seem to be at their most formed, the writers apparently ran out of time and yanked the rug right out from underneath the feet of the viewer. There is no ending here; the story just stops and the credits roll. Every single character, whether they be hero or villain, never gets a conclusive ending. The villain is not thwarted, two antagonists are simply dropped, and the main character never learns anything about herself or helps her friends achieve redemption. Nobody wins, including the viewer.

The lack of a reasonable ending is the least of this movie's problems, though. My biggest qualm was the inclusion of utterly perfunctory live-action sequences shoehorned into the short movie that make up about 12 minutes of the runtime. These sequences are ""mockumentary"" pieces, i.e. fake interviews with ""historians"" and ""veterans"" that treat the events of the film as factual. Instead of actually making the narrative more fleshed out, the writers relied on a cop-out method of expanding the universe. It doesn't work, though, and the result are a bunch of jarring, misplaced segments that serve no purpose whatsoever. Mercifully, Manga Entertainment offers the ""short version"" on this release, taking out the live-action sequences. Once those were turned off, the whole thing was noticeably more enjoyable.

Another issue is the animation. While is indeed very crisp and clean, there's a distinct lack of livelihood in both character motions and the desolate backgrounds. The sequences where Nadya is recalling a better time, before the war, are beautiful standouts standing in contrast to the rest of the film, which is admittedly dull to look at. Most of the locales begin to run together by the quarter-mark, which only leaves the characters being distinct. Not that this is a total bad thing, however, because Studio 4C did an excellent job on these. Every character, even the minor ones, have features that stand-out in the desolate backgrounds. Even a character that only gets about 45 seconds of screen time is expertly crafted and given a unique costume that etches him into memory. The plot from this movie won't stick with me nearly as much as the characters will.

One unique aspect about this title is that there is no Japanese voice track. The only two options are Russian and English, and if you value your auditory senses, then you should use the Russian track. While the English is filled with V.A.s that I generally like, they're all horribly miscast and seem to not be putting their all into the whole thing, which by consequence makes every character sound incredibly bored. By contrast, the Russian actors have such bite and vivacity that it somewhat makes up for the lack of content in the narrative itself. Nadya's V.A. is particularly fantastic. The music is another winning factor here, blending modern club music, rock and classic spy film coolness with pitch-perfect smoothness.

""First Squad"" isn't perfect, by any stretch of the imagination. But it's certainly not bad, and it's definitely one slight notch above mediocre. Despite the infuriating lack of an ending, the unique concept drives this one up to a rental status. While you should by no means shell out your money to own this, it's definitely worth experiencing via NetFlix or your local video store (they still have those, right?).

4899813,3,B005WMQ5WI,"Without the documentary part this would have been a 4 or 5 star anime.  The live action yanks you out of the illusion and story.  The documentation is not bad... it just doesn't belong in this film.

The WORST thing about the movie is that they splice in scenes of live action actors talking about random crap that, while kind of relevant to the over-arching story, is benign to the plot.

It was orignally meant to be a series, but it got chopped down into a short film instead.  You can easily tell that this was intended to be a 'set up' for a much longer story.

It 'is' short though...especially without the 'mockumentaries'.  I recommend watching it in the orignal Russian language.  The Japanese and English dubs are not well acted.

In short, don't expect shaw-shank redemption.  Its about black magic, teenagers with super powers, gun fights and sword fights, and killing nazis.  Its not meant to be realistic.",1361145600,,646,4.696428571428571

While I can only say that I saw the movie and loved it, That is only my personal preference.  If you don't have any history of Russian Cinema you should know that this movie is actually spot-on to what a real movie produced edited, etc. in Russia is like.  Russian Cinema often (about 90+% of the time) doesn't include an ending with closure.  They kind of just...end.  An excellent movie called P (Russian for Mermaid) has an ending where a girl gets hit by a car then the credits roll with about 400 questions left unanswered.  That just how Russian cinema is compared to the west.  They don't have endings with closure.  They just end.  So in that respect, if you're into Russian cinema and/or good anime and don't mind an Eastern ending, perfect movie for you.  If you don't, well buy it anyway.",1354752000,2,981,4.46067415730337

4899828,3,B005WMQ5WI,"There's some very impressive animation here, and the main character is a little more compelling than you'd expect, considering she's yet another one of anime's sword-wielding little girl tourists in Purgutory, but the story is terribly rushed. This version (a movie, not the original anime series) feels like it was patched together from parts of the series. However it came about, it fails to satisfy.

However, for specialists willing to forgive its flaws of pacing, there's much to enjoy. Some will want it for the well-animated shots (like the one of the little girl atop a train car, receding into the distance, looking back at her would-be assassins). Others, like me, will enjoy the Soviet ""Great Patriotic War"" history augmented with supernatural elements: Teutonic Knights returning from the dead, hungry for revenge against the Russians. (See ""Ghostapo"" in TVTropes.org--and try not to cheer *too* hard for Stalin's side, okay?)",1347840000,2,938,5.295302013422819
4899829,2,B005WMQ5WI,"I admittedly, had high hopes for this one, as a far of World War II especially the obscure aspects i.e. the Occult resources that both sides experimented with during the war, I thought this would be an interesting idea but unfortunately what looks good on paper isn't always good in practice.

The story follows the exploits of the Russian First Squad, a unit with the Red Army's Division 6th Division, Nadya, the sole survivor of a German attack on the training camp carries on the mission of herself and her former squadmates to combat the paranormal forces being used by the SS and the Ahnenerbe who are seeking to turn the war in their favor by using the 12th Century Crusading Order of the Sacred Cross.

As I said I admittedly had high hopes for this film, I had seen the trailer and had been trying to track down a reasonably priced copy so that I could watch it...well I did and let me just say that the wait was not worth it.

The characters never really develop, we meet Nadya and get some back story on her but as for the rest of her squad mates,  we see them in flashbacks and when Nadya goes into the ghost realm to track them down to help them combat Baron Von Wulff (The leader of the crusader army) in the final battle; other than that they're a footnote. The plot jumps around at times, characters come and go and the movies feels slightly disjointed, I felt after seeing the movie that this was a highlight reel someone had put together of interesting scenes from a series or as a promo for a series.

I personally think that this would have worked better as a 13 episode series than as a 57 minute film, that way there could be character development and we could delve more into the actions of both the German and Russian occult divisions, instead we're left with a film that is just seemingly somewhat lost and confused as our protagonist. You're never really able to get invested in the characters, Nadya feels two dimensional as the ""lone survivor"" bent on avenging her comrades, the Germans/Ahnenerbe don't feel sinister but rather cliche as Nazis bent on world domination just this time using ghosts to decide ""The Moment of Truth"" the all important moment where a battle is decided in a single instant.

As I said previously, this movie is worth a rent IF anything. The plot feels disjointed, there are no large scale battle scenes like you'd expect for something related in anyway to World War II, the characters feel two-dimensional and cliche. Overall the film works better as a highlights reel or promo for a series than it does as its own standalone piece and if it were perhaps longer and went into depth in regards to the Ahnenerbe/SS Occult divisions and the Russian 6th Division instead of just showing us them as plot devices bringing them in and out with little explanation the film would be much better.

But...the moment of truth came and went and unfortunately the battle was not in their favor.

Story: 2 out of 5
Musical Score: 3 out of 5
Animation Style/Quality: 4 out of 5

Like I said interesting idea but lacking in the execution. If there is a series then I might pick it up from the beginning, but there would need to be more plot development, interesting storylines, character development, etc but as it is, pass this one over or if you're that hellbent on seeing it, rent it.",1341014400,2,3324,4.526666666666666
4899830,3,B005WMQ5WI,The voice acting wasn't the best and the dialogue was rough. The story wasn't the most engaging. The animation was very good and the action was great but other than that the movie was mediocre.,1339459200,2,193,4.542857142857143
4899831,4,B005WMQ5WI,"I first saw this movie over an anime site when it was first released, to be honest, I loved it when it was a 'mockumentary,' having the little pieces of live action poked in filled it when needed. On the Box, it says it's 75 minutes long, but the English dub is only 60 minutes. Making it less filling. The Dubbing isn't all that bad, but nothing close to the work Funimation does.

So all in all, the original was great, but the English version fails to achieve the greatness that was First Squad.",1335052800,,498,4.297872340425532
4899832,3,B005WMQ5WI,"""First Squad: The Moment of Truth"" is an interesting project to say the least. Director Yoshiharu Ashino follows in the line of East/West collaborations like ""Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust,"" ""Highlander: The Search For Vengeance,"" and even ""Afro Samurai,"" but where as those were U.S./Japanese collaborations, this is a Japanese/Russian one. Yeah I said Russian. But because of the material it fits.

Synopsis: Set during the opening days of World War II on the Eastern Front. Its main cast is a group of Soviet teenagers with extraordinary abilities; the teenagers have been drafted to form a special unit to fight the invading German army. They are opposed by a Schutzstaffel (SS) officer who is attempting to raise from the dead a supernatural army of crusaders from the 12th-century Order of the Sacred Cross and enlist them in the Nazi cause.

The story is somewhat slow, but it has some good action and some interesting ideas. What makes this different than any anime I've seen is that it's interspersed with faux-documentary interviews with Russian and German ""historians"" and ""veterans."" These pieces are used to add a sense of realism to the story that is unfolding and on some levels it really works well. However all the build up to the epic battle sort of fizzles when the film ends with a very open ending. I'm all for leaving room for a sequel but this isn't even a proper ending. It's more like the first half of a larger story, and this was the opening chapter. I really do hope there is more because they introduce characters but barely give them any development before it's time for the grand finale.",1334793600,,1616,4.830324909747293
4899833,1,B005WMQ5WI,The only redeeming quality about this movie is the man with stick who looks like Gandalf. Although all he can do is swing his stick and fall in the river. This terrible mismatch of different tropes formed no coherent story whatsoever. Avoid this movie at all costs and watch Redline instead.,1334188800,,291,4.7254901960784315
4899834,5,B005WMQ5WI,"I have to say after reading/skimming the previous comments, I have to agree with that the 'mockumentary' clips are unnecessary. But I have to guess that the filmakers were trying to intersperse the reality of the war and its suffering along with the animated segments. I do enjoy the music along with the 'summer sequence' which I think is beautifully scored, designed, and animated. So touching, of the past.

The English dub was not bad,I think the chosen voice actors fit the characters well but in a certain scene the english actor for Leo tries too hard to say the lines with a dose of emotion in such a short timing sequence. Some lines are too cliche or too mushy on purpose!

I give animation an A+, English Dub an A-.

Finslly, I can't stress enough that the animation was superb but the movie is best watched without the live-action clips unless you want a little bit of 'history' add into it. I also like to criticize that despite what other people have said of the ending that it was 'inconclusive or short or the animators ran out of ideas and pull the rug on us viewers' after watching and rewatching the 'animated' movie, I think what the animators are trying to hint is that the 'First Squad' may have won the battle, but they have yet to win the war...",1332806400,4,1269,4.484848484848484
