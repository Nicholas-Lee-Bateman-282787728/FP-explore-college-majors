4712695,5,B005JJ0EL2,"I have never been able to do breathing exercises before, but with this DVD with the poses, it was possible and easy. I felt so relaxed and invigorated at the same time afterwards and very centered. This is easily the best yoga practice I have ever done, I highly recommend this DVD, worth every penny and then some.",1376006400,,315,4.448275862068965
4712696,5,B005JJ0EL2,"This video is appropriate for beginners with no yoga experience or experienced practitioners.  The focus is on mood change, body awareness and breathing.  As some other reviewers have pointed out there it is free of music.  With as much as the video is dedicated to pranayama and chanting I think the lack of music is necessary.  If you practice yoga to music you have a tendency to go the speed of the music. You are perhaps less attuned to your body.  If your goal is to curb anxiety, give this music free video a chance, practice with music at other times.

In response to one viewer who said the people were very ""wooden"" looking, I suggest that after the first go around, you try doing the video either with eyes closed or eyes away from the screen.  Focus on yourself.  The models are there just to give you an idea of the shape of the postures.  Turn inward, and you will get more out of this video.  I found it very interesting.

I was less impressed with the lecture portion of the video.  There is a lot to say in the field of yoga philosophy.  I didn't think the explanations found here were compelling.

Much of the benefit in Viniyoga derives from seriously connecting your breath to your movement.  If you just do the postures without much thought to your breathing, I don't think they are challenging enough to make much difference in your life. However, if you gradually increase your exhales as you deepen your inhales, I agree with Gary that you will turn on your parasympathetic nervous system, creating a sense of relaxation and calm.",1334102400,24,1554,4.55956678700361
4712697,5,B005JJ0EL2,"No music, just explaining the way to do the positions.  Very nice for beginners like me.  Very easy to follow along.  I will purchase the others.",1328659200,5,145,4.5
4712698,5,B005JJ0EL2,"This inspirational DVD is an excellent, comprehensive resource for anyone suffering from anxiety. I was immediately impressed by Gary's gentle, non-pathologizing approach. His conceptualization of anxiety and suggestions for applying yogic postures, meditation, breath work, and mantras to clearing its debilitating effects were clear and easy to follow. I also agreed with his focus on how intention, determination, and commitment are crucial to ameliorating anxiety. His suggestions for establishing rituals of self care, reframing thoughts, and taking a holistic approach all resonated with me.",1327536000,10,597,6.119047619047619
4712699,5,B005JJ0EL2,The DVD on Anxiety and the one on Depression that Gary Kraftsow released recently are both wonderful and helpful even for students of yoga without depression and anxiety. The practices increase my energy and I feel really well afterwards.,1323302400,14,238,5.128205128205129
4712700,4,B005JJ0EL2,"NOTE:  I received a free copy of this DVD to review for the web site Metapsychology Online; you can read a more complete version of my review on that site.

This DVD (along with its companion,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Viniyoga-Therapy-for-Depression-for-Beginners-to-Advanced-with-Gary-Kraftsow/dp/B005JJ0ED0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Viniyoga Therapy for Depression for Beginners to Advanced with Gary Kraftsow</a>), is the latest release from Gary Kraftsow, yoga instructor and founder of Viniyoga Therapy in the United States.  As with Kraftsow's prior Viniyoga Therapy DVDs, he has designed these new releases to include not only a practice element but also a strong educational component in the form of lectures on both yoga therapy in general and the treatment anxiety in particular.

The Main Menu of the DVD is broken up into two sections, Lectures and Practices. Also on the Main Menu, there is a link to a short (less than 1 minute) introduction from Kraftsow providing an overview of the DVD plus a second link to Special Features.  For the Lecture segments, Kraftsow is in front of a small group using a slide show; the chapter breakdowns are 1) Foundations of Yoga Therapy, 11 minutes, 2) Viniyoga Therapy for Anxiety, 18 minutes, and 3) Questions and Answers with Gary, 32 minutes.

Selecting ""Practices"" opens a submenu which lists the following options:
*Guidelines for Practice, 10 minutes
*Practice 1, Physiological Rebalancing
*Full Practice, 45 minutes
*Practice 2, Shifting Mood and Self-Concept
*Option 1, Full Instruction, 54 minutes - Explain Option 1
*Option 2, Concise Instruction, 47 minutes

Kraftsow emphasizes five guidelines for practice: 1) breath-centric asana practice, 2) pranayama, or breath control, 3) chanting, which is used in the second practice, 4) meditation, and 5) modifying the practice as needed. The Concise Instruction option can be selected once viewers understand how to incorporate chanting that is used in Practice #2. (Note: the four chants used in this practice are listed in the DVD insert; they also appear on screen briefly.)

I have provided a general overview of each of the two practices below.  Kraftsow provides all of the cuing via voiceover; he does not mirror his instructions to the viewer. Initially, Kraftsow refers to each posture by its Sanskrit name (which will also appear on screen), but he will sometimes follow-up by using the English term as well.

1. Practice #1: Physiological Rebalancing.
This first practice does not incorporate the use of chanting. Rather, the focus is on pranayama, or control of the breath. In particular, Kraftsow leads the viewer through simple postures combined with brief intervals of breath retention. He begins with a body awareness exercise lying on the back, then comes to the knees for child's pose to a cat flow. The breath retention work first appears within downward-facing dog pose, but it also occurs with more flowing movements. To conclude this practice, Kraftsow first cues a 6-minute guided savasana centered around increasing awareness of the left and right brain; an additional 5.5 minutes of pranayama closes the session.
2. Practice #2: Shifting Mood and Self-Concept.
This session begins in a lying position, with a focus on gradually extending the breath. Many of the movement are asymmetrical in nature--for example, lifting one arm overhead while flexing the opposite foot. The middle of the practice includes a long mediation with an accompanying self-reflection regarding a source of anxiety in one's current life. The chanting work is incorporated throughout the practice, in various postures from mountain to hero's pose. The final 12 minutes of this session involve pranayama and meditation. Here Kraftsow chants aloud while the viewer is expected to follow along by chanting silently to oneself.

Kraftsow's credentials and knowledge are undeniable. Unfortunately, however, as with his last series of DVDs, his approach is rather dry. There is no music to accompany these practices, and because Kraftsow does not perform the asanas himself, there is a general lack of warmth and connection to the viewer.  Combined with Kraftsow's often overly intellectualized vocabulary (e.g., ""cogitate on...""), there is a rather cerebral feel to these sessions. As a psychologist myself, it is difficult for me to imagine someone with anxiety easily connecting with these practices--which is a real shame, as I have no doubt that they would be helpful.

One final note: this DVD is packaged in 100% Recycled Packaging, including a recycled cardboard folder (full-length but slimmer than a regular DVD case), recycled plastic DVD tray, and vegetable-based dyes. While I personally appreciated the eco-friendly approach, I did not like that the case was held closed only with tape (which tore at the cover when I attempted to remove it).",1320537600,20,4906,5.45646437994723

Nice to hear encouraging words and really helped me thanks.",1320192000,9,145,4.615384615384615
8475718,5,B005JJ0EL2,"So far, I have found this video tremendously beneficial. For me, the effect of the 45-minute routine in Practice #1 (including pranayama) is calming, invigorating, and clarifying all at the same time, and the benefit lasts for much of the day.

Whether you prefer this video or Viniyoga Therapy for Depression may depend on your particular physiology and psychology. I actually expected to benefit more from the depression video, having long regarded myself as depressive and not particularly anxious; yet so far, this is the one I really respond to. It may be that I'm learning something about my own inner state.

In any case, I do recommend listening to the lectures and the explanations before beginning the practice; they clarify the underlying principles and provide important instructions about breathing, posture, etc. Also, it's worth sitting through the Questions and Answers just to hear Gary's inspirational story about his Honda and his brain tumor.

I am truly grateful to Gary Kraftsow for helping me get through this very stressful time (see date) without the aid of medication, not counting the occasional gin and tonic.",1479254400,3,1137,5.168478260869565

I do however love the way this man talks you threw everything Down to each movement detail.

8475723,2,B005JJ0EL2,"Not for people with anxiety. After 5 good minutes he has you grab your toes and try to move up and down which I couldn't do. Then he moves into the triangle pose which I never could do. Then I turned off the video for the day.

I ended up with more anxiety after doing 10 minutes of this then when I started.",1431648000,,308,3.888888888888889
8475724,5,B005JJ0EL2,"6 stars: Another brilliant DVD yoga practice from Gary.  It brought back many fond memories of the hours I studied with him at Maui School of Yoga Therapy.  Working with breath and chanting while doing asanas takes yoga practice to another level.  I agree with the reviewer who stated that this kind of practice is not for everyone.  I prefer this to many other forms of yoga practice as Gary has always adapted postures to the needs and condition of the student.  Well done.

2010 was a year of personal losses, as well as, the year I began the process of becoming the primary care giver to my husband.  My history of pain related to spinal issues and nerve compression was making continuing yoga practice difficult and challenging.  Finding time to practice without interruption was almost impossible.  This DVD was like taking a private class with Gary. After 10 days of practicing with this DVD I can not say which of these two practices is my favorite.  They both are awesome.  After each one I have been able to find that calm, centered quiet mind that I have been missing.  I do a practice shortly before bedtime.  The quality of my sleep is improving. Pain has been reduced and an improvement in my Range of Motion, although I am still facing an MRI for my shoulder.

I made a few adaptations to minimize pain in a few of the asanas and found they worked for me without increasing any risk.  In Apanasa, Dvipada Pitham an Jathara Parivritti I placed a small peanut-shaped ball or pillow between my knees. In Paschimatanasana I found the best adaptation for me was a pillow of an appropriate size under my knees. I employed a visualization technique from Ideokinesis of visualizing moving from the total skeleton/bones rather than muscles. Sitting on a balance ball for the meditation and pranayama sequences is also appropriate at this time.

The nights that I did not particularly think that I had the energy to do a practice, I found that once I started the energy was there followed by renewed hope that I was improving ""one practice at a time.""

Thank you, Gary.",1404345600,6,2074,4.653846153846154
8475725,1,B005JJ0EL2,"I did not like this yoga video.  I found Gary's presentation to be more like a cheesy self help seminar than a soothing yoga class.  If you want a self help dvd with some yoga in it.  Then this is for you.  If you want a yoga dvd, buy the one by Ira Israel.  I bought them together and disliked this one.",1384128000,2,304,3.838709677419355
8475726,5,B005JJ0EL2,"I love this DVD, not only is it a great yoga for beginners practice but it leaves you feeling peaceful and calm and really is very effective basic yoga for anxiety relief.
I found all of the poses quite easy to do. The yoga instruction was clear and precise. I really felt a sense of ease come over me a few minutes into the practice and it lasted well after the practice was over and into a very restful night. This DVD is great for anyone who wants to use simple yoga exercises to reduce anxiety. I highly recommend it.",1380326400,5,521,4.22
8475727,5,B005JJ0EL2,"Excellent!  Well-thought-out and produced!  Thorough lectures about various topics related to anxiety and yoga.  I have a thorough understanding of what I am doing, and why I am doing it.  I am so impressed that I bought the low back and upper back series' as well.  This doctor knows what yoga is all about, and how to manipulate the body to free us from undesirable symptoms.  I recommend taking a day off to familiarize yourself with his info.  This isn't just yoga.  The sequences are very well-thought-out.  I recommend this to everyone! I'm not easily impressed, as I have a gazillion yoga DVD's from Ravi and Ana.  This is different.  This is therapy.",1376784000,6,658,4.734513274336283
