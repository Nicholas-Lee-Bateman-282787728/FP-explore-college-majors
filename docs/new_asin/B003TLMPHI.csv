4190551,5,B003TLMPHI,"Absolutely loved this season, great stories were told, and the animation looked great over cable (720p). Looking forward to watching it in 1080p. This series is very well done and has exceeded my expectations.",1287014400,4,209,5.176470588235294
4190552,4,B003TLMPHI,"who said this series was made for kids?

okay, the merchandise says it. but us older fans r still relevant and the show recognises that. im a fan of all of star wars and this series rocks!!!",1284422400,5,190,4.135135135135135
4190553,3,B003TLMPHI,"I'm a huge fan of Star Wars and the first season of the Clone Wars series.  I have all the novels and e-books that the series has produced (even the Scholastic series).  While the majority of Season 2 is excellent, there are 4 episodes that deal with the Mandalorians, that have a huge impact on the rest of the novels.  Mando's are now a peace loving bunch of pacifists, instead of the warrior culture that almost conquered the galaxy and are known for the skill to beat Jedi.  It also put a halt to Karen Traviss's 501st Series of novels that have become some of my favorite novels of that time line.  Lucas has done enough damage with episode 2 and 3 of the movie series, and now he is starting on the rest of lore of this universe I have grown up with all my life.  Your supposed to add to it, not destroy it, George!!

Other then those 4 episodes, Season 2 is a great addition to the lore of the Star Wars universe.  I look forward to seeing how this series and many of the new characters add to  it.  I wish I could give it more then 3 stars, but the hit to the lore is almost crippling to the entire Star Wars universe.  Although, I am happy to see Karen Traviss is still writing novels for the series.  I just wish she could ignore those 4 episodes and continue the 501st series.",1280188800,13,1287,4.165991902834008
4190554,5,B003TLMPHI,"In this point of the series, Dave Filoni defiantly brought the content up a notch.  Some of the episodes should've gotten a PG-13 rating like Legacy of Terror and Brain Invaders.

Anyway, Season Two was great, from the evil deeds of the bounty hunter Cad Bane to the revenge attempts by young Boba Fett, this season was a hit and I can't wait to get this boxed set after getting the Season One boxed set!  This season was a lot of fun!  My favorite episode is The Deserter.",1279670400,29,473,4.340909090909091
4190555,5,B003TLMPHI,"Whats so cool about this season is that there is more then one Jango Fett, there's a large group called the  mandalorians who look just like  him. before I saw this season I thought that Jango and Boba Fett was the only one but there's more of them this season is so cool and don't forget about season three it should be on tv real soon.",1279238400,3,337,4.090909090909091
4190556,5,B003TLMPHI,"I'm too old for this stuff - NOT!!  It's high time they turned the second season loose.  One other reviewer said they should use this tech to continue Luke Skywalker's further adventures after ""Return of the Jedi"", ergo, the destruction of the Death Star.  I agree 235%.  That would be Timothy Zahn's ""Heir to the Empire"" book trilogy, which I found to be no less than awesome reading.  So much of that stuff would have to be CG'd or animated.  I'd get a huge kick out of it myself.  This Clone Wars series is for kids and for big kids like me.  My wife is resigned to the fact that I'll never grow up no matter how old I get.  I have all Star Wars movies and all the animated movies and Clone Wars series and movies that have come out so far.  I have them arranged in the proper order that the legend takes them.  I'm a sci-fi nut.  I've also got everything Star Trek and the complete Babylon-5 series and lots of old 1950s movies.  For this, the second Clone Wars series to be coming out, and having watched all the episodes on Cartoon Network, it will be great to run straight through it without ads or those highly irritating (SHOULD BE OUTLAWED!!!!) POP-UPS that tell me what I'm watching and what's coming up next.  I don't need to be told, and I'll bet a belly button to a doughnut hole that no one else does either.  I enjoy the animation and the style of the series, and I think they are pretty well told even if they are ""downed"" a little bit for kids.  If I can handle Jar-Jar Binks without a whimper, this is no problem.",1279152000,28,1532,4.231034482758621
4190557,5,B003TLMPHI,"Season two of the Clone Wars series comes out with a bang. I really like this series, even though it is targeted at kids, it really adds to the Star Wars Saga. Like I said in my review of season one, they could use this tech to make a series of the adventures of Luke and the gang after the Battle of Endor. To show what happened on screen and not just in our emagination or in print. There are tons of stories they could use this type of animation for. I'm just glad they are at least telling this story. I look forward to watching all the episodes this fall on DVD without comercials.",1278892800,10,586,4.104347826086957

4190575,5,B003TLMPHI,"this is a must for any star wars fan.

I took this to a comic con last year and I had it autographed by daniel Logan (young boba fett)  and had our picture taken together.

what's nice is that season two is return of boba since AOTC (attack of the clones ). oh and there are lots of kriffling Jedi in it too :-P",1453593600,,311,3.828125

4190577,4,B003TLMPHI,"I like the Clone Wars series as it provides more depth to the characters, reveals important aspects of Star Wars, and fills in some gaps in the movie franchise.  You learn more about the turmoil and challenges that plague the Republic as well as the battle with the Separatists.  The clone troopers get their own personalities and story lines, which was nice so it wasn't just focused on the Jedi.  After watching the Clone Wars, I understood and enjoyed the movies more.  I didn't give it 5 stars because there was excessive violence and ""darkness"" in some episodes.",1445904000,,567,4.755102040816326

4190602,5,B003TLMPHI,"First, I read ""Repackage"" as the set had to be re-sealed for a reason like it was a return.  The set I got was as new as I can tell.  I had researched and found that ""repackage"" meant that this set was the movies only, not the first released set with the book and extras.  I find that I rarely watch the ""in-depth"" extras anyway.

I love the blu-rays because of the depth of the animation.  Every scene looks like a painting in the blu-ray form.  This series was full of characters and story lines that were well worth to watch.",1402444800,,528,4.178217821782178
4190603,5,B003TLMPHI,"The Clone Wars series (I now own all 5 seasons and can't wait to buy the 6th - I am NOT Netflixing for anything!!!).blends great stories, incredible art work and great voice acting. The movies (episodes 1 to 3) were simply not in the same league as the cartoon series. Well worth the purchase and enjoyable when seen again (I've viewed every DVD in the series at least twice each!).",1402099200,,382,4.4714285714285715

4190606,5,B003TLMPHI,A must buy if you have Season 1. Cartoon network cancels so many great shows... that DVD of any favorite series preserves it forever.,1392249600,,133,4.583333333333333

4190608,5,B003TLMPHI,"Anyone who loves Star Wars should get this series! It has some of the best writing, adventure, animation and sheer imagination ever. Try watching any Star Wars movie after a few episodes of Clone Wars and see how quaint the movie is.
For those who haven't taken the Clone Wars plunge for whatever reason, do yourself a favor and check it out. Really!",1390262400,,350,4.571428571428571

4190612,5,B003TLMPHI,Great series.  My son loves it!  I grew up a Star Wars kid and was just the right age when the first movie hit the theatres.  This animated series is done extremely well and is great for kids (and adults like me) and it bridges the gap between the second batch of Star Wars movies and the new ones starting in 2015.  Ordered season 3 for him for Christmas.  Will pick up the remaining seasons for B-day and xmas next year.,1386288000,,422,4.160493827160494

4190617,5,B003TLMPHI,"My sons are 8 and 9 and love Clone Wars.  The episodes are short - about 15 minutes, so they make a good break or cool down after playing outside. They have watched each disk several times and always enjoy it.",1378080000,,209,4.097560975609756

4190621,5,B003TLMPHI,"I love ""The Clone Wars!""  I enjoy watching the show because the creators come up with excellent plots and the character development is great.  Of course we all know how the Clone Wars ends, but that doesn't make the show less worthy of watching.  I like that the Jedi that were hardly shown in the films get to be in episodes and they actually have lines, or more lines, than in the films.  Again, like Season One, the quality of the show is truly top notch.  I don't know of another animated series that seems as high quality as ""The Clone Wars,"" and the rendering continues to get better as the show goes on.  I would have preferred if Season Two had the featurettes for each episode like Season One, but instead they are grouped by each multi-episode story.  I suppose it works out well, because the first season had a lot of single episode plots, where as (as far as I've gotten in Season Two) they plots seem to be a few episodes long.  The show is a must for anyone who considers themselves to be a Star Wars fan.  The 1080p video is flawless, as is the 640 KB/s Dolby Digital audio track.  I love how clear the picture and the sound is.  I can't wait to finish this season so I can continue on with the third and fourth season.",1376179200,,1234,4.253218884120171

Or I would suggest Like new condition. This season has a lot in it. You get introduced to Death Watch for the first time, The Zillo beast episodes and the Geonosis episodes which has 5 parts to it and has lots of action.

4190685,5,B003TLMPHI,"If you're looking for a more visual review, you might as well skip this one.  You're seeing Star Wars through the eyes of a guy who's been blind since birth, so I'll mainly be focusing on the story and voice talent.  But if you're feeling daring and adventurous, read ahead.

  Being a boxset, this contains all 22 episodes of season 2.  There are a few featurettes focusing on how some of the larger story arcs in season 2 were created.  I wish they had given us a small commentary on each episode like they did in the season 1 boxset, but this isn't bad at all.

  Season 2 boasted some terrific story arcs.  Among my favorites were the Geonosis 4 parter.  The first 2 episodes in this arc contain one of the most kick butt ground battles.  I also enjoyed the Mandalore trilogy.  Some viewers found this trilogy to be contrary to the Expanded Universe, but I don't see that.  So their are a few peaceful Mandalorians.  Who is to say that their warrior culture won't win out in the end.  And Pre Viszla(hope I'm spelling that correctly), was such a ruthless villain.  Hats off to John Favreau for a thrilling performance, and I'm really digging that darksaber!(I buy a few of Hasbro's action figures and vehicles from this show so I can get a better feel for what I'm seeing, by the way.  Now if they'd only release that supertank.)

  I also got to see one of my favorite characters again in season 2.  Cad Bane got his own trilogy.  As did another one of my favs: Boba Fett, who was brought to life by the incredible voice talent of Daniel Logan.  Bounty hunters in the Star Wars universe have always interested me, so these 6 episodes were such a treat.  So was the 2 part story arc featuring General Grievous. No one will ever be able to replace Matt Wood as the voice of everyone's favorite cyborg.

  What can I say about the voice talent?  They all do such a fantastic job.  I love James Arnold Taylor's Obi Wan Kenobi.  And Matt Lanter is a joy to listen to as Anakin Skywalker.(I hear he's on that new 90210 show and I've been wanting to glance at one episode to see if I can pick him out of the crowd.)  Ashley Eckstein as Ahsoka pulled out all the stops this season, and so did Cat Taber as Padme.  I grew up listening to Corey Burton in shows like Transformers, so it's great listening to him work as Dooku and Cad Bane.  Way to go there, Shockwave!  Every voice actor who works on this series gives 200 percent and it certainly shows.  And I can't fail to mension Tom Kane as Yoda and the narrator.  I wish he could read my grocery list back to me each week.  Maybe I'd have more fun instead of being bored shopping at HEB.(Really hate grocery shopping.)

  So that about wraps it up.  I had a Clone Wars fest when I bought this back in 2010 and finished rewatching the season in about a day or so.  The episodes are that good.  You have to will yourself to turn off the DVD player.  And I'd already seen each of these episodes when they heired.  So please don't pass this season up.  I mean hey, it's Star Wars for crying out loud!  And Dave Filoni, director of the series, really delivers.",1337212800,5,3105,4.307291666666667

4190688,5,B003TLMPHI,"After being disappointed with Star Wars: The Old Republic, I needed something to calm my nerd lust for Star Wars. I've been reading 2-3 books a month as it is and I just started reading books surrounding the Clone Wars saga. This is exactly what I was looking for. There are essentially three different types of episodes in the first two seasons. Padme/Jar Jar episodes, Anakin/Ashoka episodes, and Clone trooper episodes. The Anakin episodes do more justice to the character than the prequels ever did. Ahsoka is annoying at times, more annoying than the series' take on Jar Jar (which isn't even close to as bad as the movies). The Clone trooper episodes are amazing, and make me feel like I'm watching a series based off of the game Republic Commandos. The Padme and Jar Jar episodes are clearly the worst of the three, but they are still enjoyable. Jar Jar is quirky and dumb, but not annoyingly so like in the prequels. Padme is smart, sexy, and diplomatic.

Any Star Wars fan should love to have this on their shelf.

It should be stated that there are actually two different versions of the Blu-ray release. There is one that includes a 68 page artbook with notes and sketches with a better case.",1334620800,,1203,4.643192488262911
4190689,4,B003TLMPHI,"Though I am aware this series is primarily directed toward a younger audience, I am too big a Star Wars fan to avoid it. I own the first two seaons, have skipped the third, and will likely purchase season 4 in the future. S2 is an improvement over the fairly decent S1, IMHO. The animation improves every year but S2 has the most noticable differences. If you are a SW fan, and enjoy the show, than I would certainly recommend S2. I will say that TCW is not for everybody, particularly the old-school die-hard fans like me, but if even I can overlook some of the blatent disregard for EU continuity in this series than I would think most older fans can as well. However, that does not mean I approve of decision and story of this series, as my aforementioned skipping of S3 should show.",1333152000,,786,4.390410958904109
4190690,4,B003TLMPHI,"I was definitely one of those skeptics who didn't think Star Wars would work as an animated show. I especially was worried about the art style. However, after hearing that Darth Maul was coming back, I decided to try it out - and ended up loving it.

The show is very respectful of the movies and does a good job building upon the themes in the original and prequel trilogies while adding its own new characters and stories. Ashoka Tano, Anakin's apprentice, has a wonderful combination of sass and charm. Assaj Ventress, Dooku's apprentice, adds the first true female villain to the series. Even more impressive, the series makes you care about the clone troopers, who act much more like American G.I.s than Stormtroopers.

The second season I felt had much more variable quality than the first. While the first season was consistently solid, the second had some high highs and low lows. The best part of the season for me was the opening trilogy featuring the bounty hunter Cad Bane. He has an amazing screen presence and takes the series into darker territory. Some of the other strong episodes in the season were the standalone episodes that focus on character development, particularly ""The Deserter"" and ""Lost Lightsaber,"" which give Rex and Ashoka Tano respectively a chance to shine. Some of the other episodes also give Jedi masters like Plo Koon and Ki-Adi Mundi fun lines.

A lot of the episodes this season were tributes to classic films or film genres. ""Bounty Hunters"" was a fun episode introducing several new bounty hunters, was a tribute to Kurosawa. The brain invaders arc had a blatant mix of Aliens with the Geonosian queen and Invasion of the Body Snatchers. The Zillo Beast duology was a carbon copy of Godzilla and King Kong. The episodes on their own don't do a whole lot to advance the meta-story of the Clone Wars, but they're fun tributes.

The weaker parts of the season were the longer story arcs. The Geonosis arc just didn't do anything for me and reminded me of the soulless battle scenes in Attack of the Clones. Although admittedly the Clone Wars did a better job, giving Jedi Masters Luminara and Ki-Adi Mundi some real depth. The Mandalore arc also didn't really excite me for some reason. The only part I really enjoyed was seeing the flirtation with Obi-Wan and Duchess Satine. I can't pinpoint exactly what I didn't like, but couldn't really get into seeing Mandalore in such a state.

Overall, if you like Star Wars I'd recommend giving the show a try. It's not just for kids. I haven't once felt ""silly"" for watching it. In fact, it does some stuff better than the movies.",1330560000,,2613,4.734065934065934

He is one of the most creative, sleazy and fantastic star wars villains created since palapatine. I also loved the boba fett story arc towards the end of the season. Overall the show gets darker and seedier, and I love it. The depth of this show just amazes me, week after week. And they put so many nods to the old trilogy, prequels, and EU that one can't help but be satisfied. They really do try to broaden the series in EVERY aspect. Overall, I was satisfied with the box and case, the concept book that comes with it is very cool. I still miss the commentaries though, even though this one has 4. I want all 22, please.

In over twelve hours over 6 episodes of LIVE ACTION films there was never a need for curse words (clone wars clone troopers) or gratuitous murder (clone wars bounty hunters).

What is worse, is that the violence and language occur not in the pursuance of something uniquely Star Wars, but in the conveyance of film cliches (we get it, clone troops are army men and bounty hunters are cowboys, great).

My kid will watch it because it has the letters S T A R W A R S on the package.  But that's where the magic ends.

In Revenge of the Sith when Anakin and Obi-Wan encounter Count Dooku, Anakin says ""My powers have doubled since we last met, Count."" supposedly Annie means since they last met in ""Attack of the Clones"" which was before this series took place, now this doesn't make sense as we see throughout the series of the numerous times the paths of Anakin and Dooku cross. Also when Obi-Wan meets General grevious in Episode 3 grevious says ""You fool, I have been trained in your jedi arts by Count Dooku"" as if they are just meeting for the first time, and once again, we see that Obi Wan has fought Grevious several times in the last few seasons (and probably will in the future ones) so this may be confusing but it isn't that big of a deal.

The clone wars battles are so well done, I can't believe I'm watching a tv series.

A good example would be the episode deserter where Rex comes across a clone who has settled down.  You really get the sense the clones are soldiers and not just a bunch of robots.

Bad: Black lightsaber. Yeah. And it's not even used by a Jedi.

Good: Anakin's dark (or should that be Darth?) side comes even more into play. His relationship with Obi Wan is better here, too.

Bad: The writers still can't create a traitor that isn't obvious from the very first moment they walk on screen and say their first line. Yeah, everyone is exactly what you expect them to be.

I kept watching and the quality of the episodes seemed to get better, to the point that I started to like the series. I went ahead and bought the second season, and was even more impressed. I found myself really engaged during some of the episodes, and found myself laughing at some of the dialogue (the writing really improved I think, and I noticed some subtle, less childish, humor that was thrown in).

4190734,4,B003TLMPHI,"-----------------------------------------EPISODES' REVIEW------------------------------------------
When a show says its pushing for 5 seasons, you generally tend to get very nervous, especially since an entire 1st season and a motion picture tanked your expectations, being ""mediocre"" at best. But now this new DVD release has really swept me off my feet! Star Wars never looked so good on TV! The acting is superb (with a few exceptions I'll roll out later), the story is never bland (although it suffers from unbelievably goofy premises) and each and every episode is able to hold the other up by its caliber in brilliance! It literally shoots the standards of the upcoming seasons by light-years!

The animation has made great strives and Season 2 is not shy when it comes to proving itself. The character models themselves interact with the environment, climate and other characters much more realistically. I can't even think of any particular technical hiccup off the top of my head -- not one -- from this season, which is a huge plus, in my opinion.

One technical issue I know the Clone Wars is suffering from though is that they haven't perfected the art of RAIN! I can't think of a single episode with a grey cloud in the sky, which is pretty unrealistic if you ask me. Its not a huge complaint, just a technical obstacle I'd like to see this show overcome.

The character's models could be as fantastic as they please: the characters 'themselves', however, could definitely use some tweaking. In a time-block of half an hour (22 minutes excluding commercial breaks), if amazing what both Seasons have been able to pull off. Sometimes the acting sounds forced, though, and dialogue is painfully rushed (I'm looking at you, Ahsoka and Anakin!). On the plus side, the voices fit well with the character's and their established personalities (with the exception of Grievous, who is just a miserable mess of inconsistency).

The story is outstanding, even for its constrained time-frame. Every episode acts and feels like it'd be at home playing on any big-screen cinema (which is, ironically, the exact opposite of how I felt about the feature-length film). The episodes' tone has gotten rather darker even, which I think compliments the kid's intelligence and the older viewer for watching a ""kid's show"" as well.

There's really not much else to say except the lack of legitimate villains. Count Dooku, General Grievous and Asajj Ventress get little to no action whatsoever(with the exception of Grievous getting his own 2 episode story arc... which was VERY disappointing). Some new adversaries are introduced, but they never really go anywhere (Cad Bane and Captain Honoka are the only exceptions) Instead, mercenaries, bounty hunters and even giant Godzilla wanna-bes get jammed into the show and really takes a lot away from the ""Clone Wars""!!!

I understand that the Clone Wars can't shove battle droid and clone trooper clash in our face every episode, but it'd be a nice change of pace. Season 2 covered every genre you could think of: monster movie, murder mystery, kidnapping, extortion, revenge (the list goes on!), but the show needs to understand that it can't tread too far from its element.

------------------------------------------DVD'S REVIEW---------------------------------------------
Like the last season's collection, Season 2 offered 4 discs containing the 22 episodes and a very neat book that contains concept art relating to the season. The disc offers different language options and precise subtitles too (you know, the basics). Unfortunately, one REALLY disappointing thing about the package is its presentation and its lack of bonus material.

Last Season's DVD boxset offered interesting featurettes for every episode, explaining production, technical difficulties, etc.  Instead, Season 2 has a new tab on its 'bland' menu labeled ""Bonus Material"" where you're lucky if you at least find ONE episode autopsy (there is also trailers for Star Wars games and other media, but they hardly count as worthy material). Season 1's 'main menu' even looks more impressive than Season 2's: Season 1 has a montage of clips from its episodes on each disc, where as Season 2 only has a still picture of Yoda on each disc (""Very disappointing, this is!"")

Could it really have been that hard to stuff everything into those discs? Maybe the episodes' technical superiority made it relevant to take out good portions of bonus material, but that's no excuse: they could have just simply put another disc in the set dedicated to bonus material and be done with it! And its not like they weren't ever produced: even ""StarWars.com"" still has them in its video library, and its been -- what -- half-a-year, at most? To be honest, I smell a marketing tool to get Average Joes to get Blu-rays (which I assume are PACKED with bonus material) and with my limited budget, I guess I'll just have to stick to my guns and complain some more.

----------------------------------------------OVERALL----------------------------------------------
To write a lengthy review, it definitely required me to do extensive nit-picking. I still think, even with the few complaints I have, its a worthy buy. If you are willing to cough-up the extra bucks for Blu-Ray, you'll find a complete half of this review to be irrelevant. The episodes themselves are worth the buy, regardless of package and presentation.

I see Season 2 as the forerunner... and the seasons that follow it will be as marvelous, if not greater, than the last.",1295654400,19,5532,5.168715083798883

We got season two and it is much more dark, scary and violent. The 2-4th or 5th episodes are all about jedi kids being kidnapped and potentially killed...Of course the jedi prevail but it's way too scary for a kid younger than 9 or 10....maybe even 13!

4190737,5,B003TLMPHI,"As an old school Star Wars fan, the Clone Wars seasons 1 and 2 have been an interesting look at the ""what happened"" questions the theatrical movies leave behind.
Some of the story lines are designed for the single episode feel, but overall, the season 2 takes up where season 1 ended and fills in some blanks about the Clone Wars and what took place between the 2nd trilogy movies #2 and #3. Some of the characters that get very little screen time in the movies are developed and shown for the value they brought to the Star Wars story line in the Clone Wars.
An example: You get a better feel for the anger that Boba Fett has for the Jedi and Mace Windu in particular for the death of his father Jango.
In the Clone Wars, the writers have the challenge of keeping within the boundaries of the movie story line, but they also have the creative license to fill in all of the excitement and drama fans could imagine in between.",1294012800,,925,4.32183908045977
4190738,5,B003TLMPHI,"As much as I liked season one, I like this so much more.  The series grew up some.  It isn't as ""childish"" as the first season.  We get deeper into the every day of the war.  Not that I am into uber-violence, but, it is war-time.  Even though it is geared towards a younger audience, there are certain things one expects in a series dealing with a war.  Hard decisions must be made; characters must be tested in harsh circumstances.  And to that end, it succeeds.  A reviewer or two has stated the characters seem detached about the death around them.  I would think that would be a normal knee-jerk reaction.  One has to deal with the violence, the death, the destruction, the intensity, somehow.  So I think it is natural that one would detach and seem cold and emotionless.  But, I digress.  This is a great season of a great show.  For what it is worth, my younger brother who has heard of it, but never watched it, recently tuned into Cartoon Network and started watching season three and has decided he likes the show.  He's 27, I'm 37.  He got interested enough to check it out after, for whatever reason, thinking it would not be necessarily a good show.  Like myself, he is impressed by the overall story, the production, and by just being a fan.

The writing is so good that I forget that I don't like the art. The whole show, while made for kids, doesn't shy away from killing people. Seriously, early in this season they torture a guy to death on screen. Don't get it wrong, they make it obvious that the bad guys are the ones killing people that way and not the good guys. This season is just as good as the first, you could watch this one first if you want with few ill affects but then you'd miss a whole season of awesome.

We both grew weary of the emotional disconnect between the characters and the violence - as though killing was simply something else they had to do and it really didn't have any emotional impact on them.

4190746,5,B003TLMPHI,"In the cover of this complete season two, Master Yoda is holding his lightsabor with a firm look that he gives to the enemy. Although I have no idea why master Yoda is standing there with a smirk on his face, I kind of like the design. The complete season two is like the complete season one. It has 4 discs and 22 series in total. Each series has about 30 min running time, and starts with different wise-sayings. The keywords of episodes per each disc, I think, are these:
- Disk 1 : Holocron : friendships + trust
- Disk 2 : Geonosis + Grievous : letting go + understanding
- Disk 3 : Mandalore : betrayal + love+ patience + leadership
- Disk 4 : Boba Fett + Zillo beast : all life forms
For example, the first disc has episodes in which the Jedi Holocron is mainly dealt with. Darth Sidious ordered Cad Bane to steal the Jedi Holocron, and he did it. Desperate to get it back, Anakin Skywalker and Asoka Tano are dispatched to a mission. In the story, you will see the strong bond between master and a Padawan. Thus, you will understand that Cad Bane is more dangerous than you thought. Anyway, I just wanted to tell you that in the story, there is always a thing to learn.
My favorite episodes are in disk 3. As said above, it is mostly about Mandalore, love, betrayal, patience, and leadership. I like it because, when I was watching the part about Mandalore, I found that like Skywalker, Obi-wan Kenobi has a love too (think about that!). However, the MAIN reason why I like is that it gives you a lot of wise sayings. For example, ""a wise leader knows when to follow."" from the episode where Anakin Skywalker and Obi-wan Kenobi engages an infamous separatist admiral.

To sum up, I think it is a really, truly, literally, wonderful.
P.S. if you haven't yet watched Complete Season One, watch it first.
P.P.S. if you haven't watched Star Wars please watch them. (At least 1 and 2)",1292457600,3,1887,4.3760683760683765
4190747,3,B003TLMPHI,"I no longer have The Cartoon Network at home, and I was a HUGE fan of Clone Wars season 1, so I eagerly pre-ordered Season 2 of the Clone Wars.

Its not to say that Season 2 is bad.  Its not bad.  But the stories seemed recycled from old movies:  The magnificent seven, Godzilla, some other stories I couldn't put my finger on but seemed familiar somehow.  Each episode seemed to be somehow disconnected from the larger story of the Clone War that is supposed to be taking place.  Then the last thing I watched on the DVD's was an interview with the producer who said ""George Lucas wanted to pay homage to old movies with the stories in Season 2"" and then it all made sense.

The problem with that is, George took us on this trip by suspending too much disbelief and almost ignoring the larger war entirely.  For example, in order to setup the Magnificent Seven storyline, he had 3 Jedi's go on a trip to investigate the destruction of an entire clone facility in a little courier sized starship, so it could get shot down and strand them on a planet, forcing the storyline.  At this point don't they know they are at war?  They send 3 Jedi in a Winnebago to investigate the destruction of an entire starbase?

The graphics are still good, though starting to show their age.  The epic battles of season 1 are present in the first half of the season, replaced by non related filler stories and recycled stories in the 2nd half.  You don't get the sense like you did in season 1, that the current story counts.  Even the one large story arc about the battles on Geonosis feels like an excuse to do the same thing again.

For many reasons and many ways I kept feeling like ""haven't we been here before?""  Its not a bad place to be, I guess, but the shine is gone.  Lets hope it comes back in season 3...",1291852800,2,1800,4.309523809523809

4190749,5,B003TLMPHI,"Clone Wars may be the closest Star Wars has come to its original inspiration.  Like the movie serials that inspired it, each episode stands alone but is also part of a larger arc.  After a mediocre start with the Clone Wars movie the series got much better and with this season rises to new heights.

We get several multipart story arcs, including one the focuses on the Mandalorian commandos, a group I've wanted to see more of since Boba Fett debuted in 1980!  Some episodes are tributes to classic films including a great Godzilla vs Star Wars 2 parter.  You can't take these too seriously, they are aimed at younger audiences but they have mature moments, at one point a group of evil bounty hunters not only kill a hostage, we see his dead body drifting outside the ship.

The box set includes a book of concept art, a nice goody for those of us who remember the old Star Wars art books.

It now has a more cinematic feel on the Blu-ray (as well as a bit more image on the left and the right). The packaging is similar to the first season, though the book can now be removed from a sleeve. Strangely, the cover of the book reads: ""le GUERRE dei CLONI"". I thought for a moment that I had the Italian version of the book, but the cover art and the artist's note inside the front cover made it clear that it was an homage to the spaghetti western.

8405228,5,B003TLMPHI,"The Clone Wars was one of Cartoon Networks most popular shows during its airings and it is easy to see why. Not only is it an animated action-adventure show, but it is an animated action-adventure Star Wars show. While I had some complaints with the first season of the show, I still enjoyed it for the most part and decided to give it a four-star rating. Even though there were significant problems, the show was still addicting and very enjoyable, so it was worth it. The great news is that this season is better than the first and what I was told seems to be true: this show does indeed get better as it goes along. Now, that doesnt mean that every episode is better than the previous, but when watching (more specifically, binge-watching) the show, one can slowly see the stories get more mature and the characters gain more depth. The show is no longer a childrens show in my eyes, but rather a show for all-ages and for that, I am grateful.

 With my review of the first season, I reviewed the season as a whole with some mentions to individual episodes, but Im going with a different approach this time; instead, Ill be explaining my thoughts based on the order of the episodes. For example, the first few episodes of the season deal with returning villain Cad Bane (my standout character of the last season) and I loved this arc simply because I love Cad Bane. He is such a bad*ss and I love it! Despite not being a Jedi in any way, he is still not only able to outsmart them on numerous occasions, but also able to take them on in hand-to-hand combat. Honestly, I think he is a far better character than Boba Fett and, therefore, my new favorite bounty hunter of the universe. So, those thoughts were from the first few episodes, so now Ill just continue with this style.

 I thought the episode Senate Spy was a very weak episode because Padme doesnt make for a very compelling protagonist. Shes boring and comes across as a nagger to me, not to mention this episode also features Anakin as the jealous husband, which is upsetting because those stories are almost always a disappointment. However, despite me not liking the episode, the opening was very well done with its portrayal of the relationship between Padme and Anakin  certainly better than Episode IIs love dialogue. I think this episode is important to discuss because even though Im labeling this as a five-star season, that doesnt mean every episode is a winner. Batman: The Animated Series is one of the most critically-acclaimed animated shows of all time and there are quite a few bad episodes in there, too, so just make sure you have reasonable expectations when watching this. Luckily, most of the episodes are great.

 I think the best episodes are those that are part of an ongoing story arc. The last season had these, such as the Malevolence arc, but they seem to be more prominent in this season and I think it works for the best. The Genosis arc is great because it establishes Anakins strong bond with his Padawan, Ahsoka, not to mention furthering her as a character by having her interact with Bariss, who is the Padawan of Luminara. This episode is very ironic to me because I think part of the reason that the council wanted Anakin to have a Padawan was to deal with letting people go, and I think it will only make it harder for him. She obviously isn't in the movies, so I think this has a nice bit of foreshadowing. Also, very minor spoiler, but Anakin uses Force Choke in this arc, which is an excellent use of foreshadowing his downfall. Overall, it was a solid arc.

 The next batch of episodes involved General Grievous and it was great because of its simple and easy-to-follow plot that was still very tense, the cool battles, and the wonderful use of choir music throughout the first episode. The second part of the episode wasn't as good, but was still good; my big gripe is that, as Obi-Wan says, Were right back where we started, meaning that very little happens to further the story. The episode does, however, feature a very interesting conversation between Captain Rex and a clone who left the army. It isn't the deepest talk in a TV show, but it is a step in the right direction for making the clones feel as human as possible. The episode that follows this mini-arc is another filler episode (meaning it doesnt add much to the overall story and is just a stand-alone episode), and I appreciate these. They are a nice change of pace from the multi-episode narratives, even if they don't flesh out characters as much as some of the other arcs, which is exactly what the next arc does.

 This next story is based around the Mandalorian people and not only features some great action from people about as skilled as Jango Fett (who wore Mandalorian armor), but also fleshes out Obi-Wan Kenobi. Seeing as how he has appeared in a crucial role in four of the Star Wars films, I think that already makes him the most complex character (except for maybe Anakin), but this story adds to that by revealing that he, like Anakin now, was once in love. This has already been explored in some of the novels, but it is stunning to see it in episodes with James Arnold Taylor voicing Kenobi, as he does a superb job with the character. Satine, the love interest, acts as a perfect foil for Obi-Wan and makes the pseudo-relationship work very well. This arc is probably my favorite in the series so far and it has made Obi-Wan an even better character, which I wasn't sure was possible. This was a simply superb arc.

 One of the final arcs is another two-parter that centers on the humongous Zillo Beast, and by humongous I mean that it makes the Rancor look like its baby. This beast is awakened during a battle between the Republic and Separatists after the former releases a mega bomb to neutralize all droids (with some stunning explosive animation to boot and a nice detail by having Anakins robot-arm react accordingly). Unfortunately, awakening the beast causes trouble as it is now disturbed and is impervious to most attacks, including lightsabers. One of my favorite scenes in these episodes feature Anakin running along the beast trying not to die, evoking a God of War boss battle feeling to it, including some fancy cinematography. The ending of the episode, without spoiling it, is also saddening (if a little predictable) with more great music. The ending drops some hints about a possible future episode relating to this arc and I hope this is true, but from what Ive read, this seems to be a stand-alone story. Still, they were a fun couple episodes and a great homage to classic monster films.

 The final story arc is probably my least favorite of the series, which is not what I expected because it focuses on Boba Fett. Since Mace Windu killed his father, he wants revenge, which is all fine and dandy, but he is disguising himself as a young cadet clone trooper, which isn't fun to watch because not only is Boba annoying, but the cadets are as well. Its a really disappointing ending to the season because I was hoping Boba would be awesome, but it just comes across as a child having a temper tantrum  he lacks everything that made him cool in the original trilogy, including his lack of dialogue, his cool outfit and weapons, and his effectiveness (at least in Empire). However, each of the three episodes has some great music during select scenes, such as the ending of the first where Boba leaves, and it is my favorite in the series so far. Plus, the final episode has Hondo make another return (I believe this is his fourth episode in the series) and he has now become a favorite of mine, alongside Cad Bane. He is still a bad guy, but an honorable and charismatic bad guy, so its all good. So, I still didn't love the arc, but it wasn't a pain to sit through - I just wanted a better finale for the season.

 This season was great, plain and simple. Is it the best season of Star Wars television yet? No, I still think Genndy Tartakovskys Clone Wars holds that candle, but if you were a fan of the first season, even mildly, you should enjoy this season significantly more, as it really does just get better as it goes along (for the most part). The animation is also much smoother, which is great because I hear it is even better for the third season and beyond. Everything the series was already doing right, including great voice acting and a focus on side characters in the universe, is still being done, but with the added quality in the stories and more character depth, it is even better now. The only downside is that I now have high hopes for season three, but Im confident that my expectations will be met. I send my congratulations to the team for making this show and Im eagerly awaiting my start of season three.",1503360000,,8747,4.549904640813732
