1396972,5,B000056HEG,"A riveting, inspiring piece of American history, seeing the legendary Jackie Robinson play himself is a rare experience; a man who did so much to change the face of segregation, with enormous courage and extraordinary talent.
This is a film everyone, young and old, black and white, should see. Buy it, keep it, give it as a gift. This film is a treasure, even for those of us who are not baseball fans, and like me, don't really understand the game...this film is about so much more...it is the portrait of an era, and the man who was able to make a difference.

Jackie Robinson has a beauty in his face, and is a charismatic screen presence. He is backed by some excellent actors, like Ruby Dee, who plays Rae, his wife, and Minor Watson, terrific as Branch Rickey, who was president of The Brooklyn Dodgers, and also an interesting character. Rickey made a judgement call to hire Jackie, and was proved right, despite much opposition. Humor is provided by the very funny Ben Lessy as Shorty.

The film starts with Robinson as a young boy, through his college years at UCLA, and his time with the Panthers, an all-black team, then a stint in the military during WWII, and later trying to get a job as a coach, with no results.
Robinson of course suffered endless slurs and hatred in the early years with the Dodgers. Mr. Rickey made Robinson promise that he would never fight back when insulted, and even hit, and Robinson replied, ""Mr. Rickey, I have two cheeks"".

The first game he played with ""organized baseball"" was in 1946, and changed sports history, and a hero was born. God bless Jackie Robinson, for all he did for sports, and all he achieved for humanity.
With well paced direction by Alfred E. Green, a nice somewhat corny but appropriate score by Herschel Burke Gilbert, and the great Ernest Laszlo did the cinematography, which captures the enthusiasm of the game.
Total running time is 77 minutes.",1098489600,34,1914,4.65680473372781
1396973,4,B000056HEG,"How do you rate Americana on a scale of 1 to 5 stars?  It ain't easy, especially when the subject is one of the most special films in history, with Jackie Robinson starring as himself, the first African-American to have a successful major league baseball career since the major leagues themselves were in their early days.  Complicating that is the fact that the film itself would be really quite poor if not for this subject matter, as several athletes and sports people are seen playing characters in the film.  With more professional actors the story would have been portrayed more vividly.

Regardless, this is a gripping history piece that records several very important things for posterity.  The horrifying level of racism undergone by the gallant Robinson and other black ballplayers in the 1940s was the same racism undergone by other African-Americans across the US, but when Branch Rickey, owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers, decided it was time to give a black man a shot in the majors, it seemed that all of the baseball fans, management, and players were against the two of them.  This the story of what Robinson went through, and how Rickey championed his cause, giving him the correct advice of ""Don't fight back.""  This MLK/Gandhi approach worked because Robinson had the character to make it work, was a likeable man, a great ballplayer, and, as one of the characters in the film points out, ""He's a gentleman too.""

This story screams for a modern remake, one that would be done with a passion for historical accuracy and first-rate motion picture style.  As it is, this now ancient ""B"" movie is in the public domain, with several different companies offering the title in DVD or VHS.  The quality of the picture is therefore grainy and choppy, being cheaply copied from old celluloid.  Actually the public domain status has probably saved this precious history from a horrible fate, as the quality of the production is quite low and demand for the film apparently not high, so that anyone who owned a copyright on it might not find it financially feasible to put out on DVD.  In the public domain nobody has to paid for the rights to issue a video or DVD, so it's more readily available.

Minor Watson steals the show as Rickey, showing fire and passion in regard to giving Robinson a fair chance when the rest of the baseball world wanted to shut out a black man.  As for Robinson himself, well, as an actor he's a great athlete, but it's pure joy to watch him show what a fine talent he was, and Ruby Dee is more than adequate as his wife.  Some of the supporting cast, especially ballplayers who are supposed to be furious and threatened at Robinson's presence, have no more acting ability than a third-grader in a Christmas pageant.

The story is watered down for a 1950 audience, but much of what Robinson went through was surely R-rated.  A modern retelling would be wonderful to see, but will never replace this important piece of sports history, African-American history, and World War II era history.  Must see.",1096070400,9,3035,4.748571428571428

He appeared on The Dick Cavett Show months before his death in October 1972. They are airing Cavett reruns. Try to catch the episode with Jackie as he comes off as a soft- spoken, articulate gentleman. Give you insight to the man's character.

1396986,5,B000056HEG,"This is a superb autobiography film. What makes is specifically notable is to meet Jackie himself, since he plays his own character in this movie. The film embodies so much that painted our culture of legal segregation. This movie was filmed just three years after Jackie broke the color barrier. The acting is not Broadway. But the message is outstandingly clear. I highly recommend this film for the family, small groups, and especially schools.

This film is a tribute to overcoming and transforming America through excellence, integrity, and self control. To put passion and dreams above retaliatory anger  and short term venting over cultural changing excellence.",1462233600,3,668,5.2924528301886795

1397109,5,B000056HEG,"This is a beautifully directed film biography of the early life story of the incomparable Jackie Robinson, and offers the exquisite and priceless opportunity to see Jackie Robinson play himself.  The film also serves as a historical commentary in its nuanced and extremely reserved handling of the racial prejudice that Jackie experienced, and that was still so prevalent at the time the film was made.  The filmmakers were clearly passionate about telling Jackie's story, but in a way that would be ""palatable"" to the general public.  It's restraint makes Jackie's experiences as a black man and athlete (and his Olympian brother's experience, dealt with in the film only briefly) only more heartbreaking, as the audience itself connects the dots.

Thankfully, the film has been released in a color version, to make it accessible and watchable for the younger generation.

Also, the movie made clear the role of his and Rickie's faith, with the famous question/ response: would Jackie be able to turn the other cheek ? (Jesus, Matthew 5:39)--all bets were off, unless he could/ would be willing to do so, and would be courageous and strong enough...the rest is history. (But what a different history it would have been, had he not been able to do so!)

Also showed the accurate situation of African-Americans after the war, with his college-educated brother taking a job as a sanitation dept. to feed his family; the importance of a supportive spouse, and the differing responses of people, based on their faith and values and not their race.  It also showed the truth that individuals can make a difference, and impact society for the better. REALLY recommend to all ages/ ethnic groups...

But it's hampered by its1949 production, and it was bound to rely on lots of stereotypes and sentimentality. The movie is good for seeing Robinson play himself, but that's about all.  The tone of the movie is too bland, and I'm betting 42 will be truer to the story of a man with the guts to take racism head-on in 1940's America.  The story begins when Robinson is still a kid, but never develops into the intense personal and political drama of his breakthrough.  In addition, the movie attempts to make the story a patriotic tale of success in a triumphant, mid-century USA.

Both movies lend strength to those who are minorities or discriminated against and help inspire them to persevere in the face of seemingly Goliath-like giants that are opposing their progress and effort.  It is also an inspiration to human beings, like Branch Rickey, who choose to make an unpopular moral choice though they belong to the group that's discriminating, in Mr. Rickey's case, the white race.  This is a good movie that's relevant today with all of the bullying we read about in the news against those who are non conforming and it's relevant because of the continuing efforts to try and include all members in our society and treat everyone with equality while respecting their rights and diversities.

While the latter is clearly the bigger and more elaborate production, the earlier film is fascinating to watch for two reasons in particular -- it stars Jackie Robinson playing himself in the title role, plus the fact that the portrayal of segregation and racism is presented in the film at the very time it is still occurring.  So that, for example, scenes of Jackie Robinson and his wife sitting in the back of the bus under a sign reading ""Coloreds Sit In Back"" is portrayed when such practices were still being employed in the South.

Robinson was big news when he became the first black major league ball player, and I guess Warners decided they'd cash in on the controversy by starring Robinson as himself in his own ""story, though bear in mind this is about as much of a ""biography"" as anything else so-called back then...i.e. lots of hogwash and fiction, with tiny bits of fact thrown in for respectability. It's just fun to see the real Robinson in a full-length film, but thank Heaven he was a better ballplayer than he was an actor 'cause he clearly had the chops for one and clearly NOT for the other. The colorized version is interesting to watch and thanks to digital improvements in that technology it doesn't have that muddy, artificial look it did back when they first started destroying classic films like ""Casablanca"" subjecting it to that process. But I'm a purist and feel that if a filmmaker meant for something to be in color he /she would've FILMED it that way, so I'm a bit biased against the process in general. But this makes a nice piece of history if nothing else, and certainly worth seeing whether you've already seen ""42"" or plan on it. Filmmakers can get away with considerably more these days when dealing with racism not than was possible...or acceptable to the movie-going public....back in the white-bread, suburb-choked fifties when ""decent"" people just didn't discuss it in spite of its prevalence.

1397223,5,B000056HEG,"Yes, this is a Hollywood version of racial prejudice and the courage of various people (Robinson, obviously, but also the Dodger's brilliant president, Branch Rickey). But it's such an important moment in American history--and a story that everyone should know, but especially those too young to know what ""the color line"" was or who can't picture the hatred that greeted a baseball team in some cities because there was one black player on it.

Plus, how wonderful is it that Robinson plays himself? As an actor, he is as handsome as Denzel Washington and brings a sweet, unaffected quality to his scenes with Rickey, Dee (as his wife), as well as the relentless haters. You see him struggle to honor his promise to Rickey--to turn the other cheek, no matter how many taunts and how much hatred was directed at him (and there was much).

It's a compelling story, one that even I, as a Dodger's fan, didn't realize the complexity of. Best of all, we get to see Jackie Robinson playing second base (then first),  recreating his first major league game. At one point, when I realized I was actually seeing Jackie ROBINSON holding his bat over the plate, taking a swing, stealing a base, hitting one of those amazing home runs...whatever it was...it's hard to explain, but it was very, very moving.

This is a great story and I think the handling of our country's racism is just about the right amount to keep people watching and to keep their eyes (and feelings) concentrating on the two men who were taking these great risks to fight it (as Rickey said, ""I may not be able to fight racism in the nation as a whole, but I should definitely be able to do something about it in baseball.""

I DO admire the people for making this movie about a black man (remember, the Civil Rights Movement didn't even started until 1955!), but it was so sugarcoated that I had hard time swallowing it.  I suppose that was necessary to appeal to the majority of the Americans at the time.  I would recommend this movie to kids of any age or race.  They can witness racism behind the rose-colored glasses and still know that it's wrong.

1397228,5,B000056HEG,"The Jackie Robinson Story is the 1950 hit biopic on the then-superstar's life and career, focusing on the events that led to his integration of baseball via the Dodgers organization.  In honor of the Jackie's contributions to athletics and society, Legend Films has colorized this once black and white film, hoping to introduce it to a new, modern audience and preserve it for future generations.  Potential purchasers should note that a portion of the proceeds go to the Jackie Robinson Foundation, which consulted with Legend on the colorization process.  As to the actual plot, I'm sure you all know how it ends.

Although the film's new color is this DVD's highlight, those of you who would prefer to relive nostalgic childhood moments or are simply averse to altering old movies, can view the thoughtfully view the included black and white version.  You'll be directed to select color or black and white on the DVD's menu.  Even if you have no interest in the colorization, this is the definitive Jackie Robinson Story DVD to purchase, because in order to properly colorize a film, the black and white must be cleaned up and re-mastered, noticeably improving the picture quality.

The film's big box-office draw was the fact that Jackie Robinson played himself, and that is no less of the appeal today.  After all, how many national heroes star in the biography?  And, as my baseball-addicted friend pointed out, it's quite interesting to see Jackie and others from that era play baseball in a cinema-quality style shoot (he in particular loved to see how the game has developed over time, and often laments about the mostly poor quality archival footage that exists).

And, although she clearly plays second fiddle to #42, this movie represents Ruby Dee's true mainstream debut, and we all know how her career eventually ended.",1228262400,2,1833,4.980327868852459
1397229,5,B000056HEG,"THE JACKIE ROBINSON STORY stars Jackie Robinson himself. Ruby Dee plays his wife Rachel. This 1950 film is a very bowdlerized account of Robinson's life and the struggles he faced integrating Major League Baseball. Jackie played for the Brooklyn Dodgers from 1947 to 1956 (their halcyon years), and was one of the most creative players on the field.

The baseball diamond, however, was simply the stage where Jackie played out, in complete isolation at first, one of the most dramatic social transformations in American history. By stepping onto the grass at Ebbets Field on April 15, 1947, Jackie singlehandedly thrust the issue of civil rights into the forefront of the American consciousness. He paid a terrible price in verbal and psychological abuse, injuries inflicted by other players, death threats, and more. He prevailed, and America is a better place because of it, but Jackie's life was undoubtedly shortened by the ordeal. He died in 1972, blind and halt from diabetes, white haired and aged far beyond his 52 years.

This film is crucially important because it is a document of Robinson's struggle, no matter how gentrified for a film audience. It is unique, because Robinson portrays himself. It is timely, as Robinson's field debut occurred only three years before the film's release, and virtually everyone represented in the film was still directly involved with Robinson. This is Hollywood's sincere attempt to come to grips with the impending Civil Rights Movement, a Movement spearheaded by Robinson.

Robinson is an unpolished actor whose great talent is his intensity. Even though this is a film, and even though this illuminates past events, Robinson is living through every minute of every experience, not acting at all. The film has an air of having been hastily thrown together, but despite the roughnesses of its 8mm home movie feel, this film is compelling to watch.

No one can really understand what Jackie Robinson, ""the loneliest man in baseball"" felt in his gut, but we can honor him, and have. He was a trailblazer. His talent was legendary. His number, 42, has been retired throughout the Major Leagues. He was the first Rookie of the Year, a Most Valuable Player, a Hall of Famer, and posted impressive statistics even in his rookie year when the possibility of his being shot from the stands was an ugly, very real, possibility. He may have been the loneliest man in baseball, but he was also the bravest man in America for the longest stretch of time.",1222732800,2,2490,4.978365384615385
1397240,4,B000056HEG,"This is a film biography of the legendary Jackie Robinson. The first black, major league Baseball player. It was a brave film to make in 1950, considering that racial segregation and the colour bar were all still in place. However an element of hypocrisy spoils the film at the end when the statement ""This can only happen in a free country like America..."" is thrown in, presumably to placate the white audience of the time.

Robinson plays himself, and whilst he's not a great actor, he does a decent job. If the film is anywhere near the truth he was, as well as being a hugely talented sportsman, a dignified and intelligent man who despite frequent provocation ignored the abuse (monkey noises etc) and went about his business. The rest of the cast are of a similar standard and the script is crisp, because the film is only 76mins long.

Its the message of the movie that will remain with you long after you've seen it, even if the ending is a bit hypocritical. Well worth buying.",1190419200,2,986,4.564971751412429

Jack Roosevelt ""Jackie"" Robinson became the first African-American major league baseball player of the modern era in 1947 --- While not the first African American professional baseball player in United States history, his Major League debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers ended approximately eighty years of baseball segregation, also known as the baseball color line --- In the United States at this time, many white people believed that blacks and whites should be ""segregated"" (kept apart) in many spheres of life, including sport --- The Baseball Hall of Fame inducted Robinson in 1962 and he was a member of six World Series teams --- He earned six consecutive All-Star Game nominations and won several awards during his career --- In 1947, Robinson won The Sporting News Rookie of the Year Award and the first Rookie of the Year Award --- Two years later, he was awarded his first National League MVP Award --- In addition to his accomplishments on the field, Jackie Robinson was also a forerunner of the Civil Rights Movement --- He was a key figure in the establishment and growth of the Freedom Bank, an African-American owned and controlled entity, in the 1960s --- He also wrote a syndicated newspaper column for a number of years, in which he was an outspoken supporter of Martin Luther King Jr. (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

1397244,4,B000056HEG,"The ""Jackie Robinson Story"" is remarkable in that, much like Robinson had done for baseball, it is among the first Hollywood films to tackle America's racial divide. What makes it more interesting for today is that Jackie Robinson plays himself.

While the film still has an impact, the complete story of all that Robinson had to go through was toned down drastically for a mass 1950 audience. The film is also full of '40's film cliches it has plenty of schlock for comic relief. The power of the whole truth, and Jackie Robinson's great achievement, needs to be told on screen in a modern film.

in the meantime I recommend reading Arnold Rampersad's biography of Jackie Robinson or Robinson's autobiography ""I Never Had It Made."" to go along with this film.",1154476800,,760,4.793893129770993
1397245,5,B000056HEG,"What's Amazing is the fact that this DVD is sold in the bargain basement grocery bins. I guess that shows that it really pays to at least take a peek at those bargain bins, sometimes you can find a real treasure--and this certainly fits the bill. I had never seen it on TV so I took it home and popped it into the DVD player so that I could at least get a chance to see Jackie Robinson play himself. It was interesting to view the events of Jackie's historical accomplishment on film in black in white during the era in which it actually happened. I am sure the directors had to brave some obstacles of their own in order to get the film released. This is a good story that was done well for it's time and it serves as an incredible piece of history.

Of note are some of the comments made by members of the Negro League as they try to ""school"" a curious Jackie on the bus en route to another game. Their conversations tell of the hardships for African American baseball players during the Jim Crow era, including the fact that there were no contract for Negro League players and they were not allowed to use public facilities or sit at lunch counters.

I especially enjoyed seeing a young Ruby Dee playing Jackie's wife. Jackie is fine playing himself. He's no actor but it certainly was a smart move to capture him hitting his own homers and performing great outfield feats. One can only imagine what he must have felt on the inside as hostile crowds jeered and called out obscenities. Robinson had to brave the name calling and personal threats while while mustering up the courage not to give in to the inclination to fight back. For that strength he was well respected and rewarded. Some of those difficult crowds cheered him on when as he later won the pennant for the Dodgers.

Some say the film deserves a remake. I say they got it right the first time. This is one film that belongs in every DVD collection.",1142294400,4,1916,4.391549295774648
1397246,5,B000056HEG,"JACKIE ROBINSON ""IS"" THE RIGHT MAN TO GET THE JOB DONE!

OVERVIEW:

It has been said that the best 3 things about America are ""The Constitution"", ""Jazz"", and ""Baseball"". Well, in 1946 it was time for Major League Baseball to ante up and rise to join the big leagues. ""The Jackie Robinson Story"" is the tale of an important journey on that bumpy road that America, through Major League baseball, finally and convulsively faced.

WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT?

Things anyone should be able to take for granted were considered out of the reach for too many Americans who were victims of a system that had hung around far too long. Jackie Robinson, by virtue of his talent and to a larger measure his solid character, was the right man at the right time to get the job done.

The ""color line"", an invisible wall that never should have been constructed, was voluntarily destructed but it was not easy. This film tells us how this barrier was approached and the attitudes of those on all sides of the question. In many cases, it was not a pretty picture.

Branch Rickey, owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers, has the unique distinction of taking the moral high road while acting in the best interests of his team, his sport, and his country.

Jackie Robinson, who plays himself in the movie (and does it very well), is clearly a human being that deserves the opportunities he gets and he earns everyone's respect in the process, fans and foes alike.

MUCH MORE THAN JUST A SPORT MOVIE BIOGRAPHY:

Yes, it is a taut and compelling film involving major league baseball and human rights. More than that, it illustrates the naked, blind cruelty that seemed to grip people from all walks of life over the color issue as well as the sterling characters of a few mavericks. This is a film that shows more than it tells and that is always the best way to present a story.

THE CAST:

Jackie Robinson plays himself and of course needs no introduction. Ruby Dee plays the young woman he marries and who demonstrates the same brand of courage as her husband. Ruby Dee later starred along side Sidney Poitier in ""A Raisin In The Sun"" and as Jackie Robinson's mother in the 1990 TV movie ""The Court Martial of Jackie Robinson. Minor Watson plays Dodgers owner Branch Richey and portrays him as a rough-but-fair businessman who is obviously disgusted over the ""color line"" in baseball and is the man who finally facilitates its overdue termination.
