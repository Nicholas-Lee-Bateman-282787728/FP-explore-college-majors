699003,5,6303683002,"A Taste of Honey was one of that clutch of kitchen sink dramas that came out in the 1950s and 1960s. I saw most of them, but this was always my favorite, although This Sporting Life, Saturday Night, Sunday Morning and Look Back in Anger were also very good. The kitchen sink dramas aimed at what they called social realism and were a reaction to the kind of middle- and upper-class works that had been so popular in previous years, associated with such writers as Nol Coward and Terence Rattigan. My review at times is specific in detail but I think there is no need for a spoiler alert when discussing a famous movie which is more than 50 years old: I assume most people who might read this review will be revisiting the movie rather than seeing it for the first time. A Taste of Honey is true to its genre, showing a backdrop of sooty, working-class Salford, near the industrial city of Manchester, with its narrow and depressing alleyways and the scenes of the ship canal liberally strewn with detritus. The opening and closing credits are very nicely accompanied by a bunch of young children singing a marvelous traditional childrens song (Oh the big ship sails on the alley, alley O). The song probably refers to the Manchester ship canal, which features prominently in the movie. The wonder and genius of this movie (based lovingly by Tony Richardson on the play by then 19-year old Shelagh Delaney) lie in its thorough honesty and the fact that the characters are interesting, convincing and believable, albeit sometimes larger than life. The relationship between the two central characters -- the teenager Jo, played by Rita Tushingham, and her closest friend Geoffrey, played by Murray Melvin -- shows beauty, dignity, tenderness and radiance despite all the obstacles in their lives, notably: the sordid and challenging surroundings presented by a tough environment; the daily scrabble to make ends meet; and the frightful people who intrude on their lives (especially Jos mother, brilliantly played by the veteran actress Dora Bryan, and her mothers loathsome boyfriend Peter, a man with absolutely no redeeming virtues). The relationship between Jo and Geoffrey is deeply touching and caring. Initially, there is irony in the situation, since Jo turns out to be pregnant from a passing relationship with a sailor and Geoffrey is (in modern parlance) gay. But here is part of the wonder: a genuine and palpable bond of love (platonic) as well as caring develops between them as the story unfolds. The ending is sad and poignant yet in some strange way I think we can have hope for the futures of Jo and Geoffrey: they are good and compassionate people who are bruised but not beaten. The movie proves again to me that a good script is essential for a good film, which usually means that it is based on an excellent book or play. How much lasting impact did the kitchen sink genre have? Perhaps not much, when I look at the movies they make today, but I for one will remember A Taste of Honey for the rest of my life. One final point. I must make it clear that I saw the movie this time around on a used VHS tape, so the technical quality was not good. But, after all, the movie and the VHS technology are both old, so I did not allow that to bias my rating. However, I would urge the reader to view it on a DVD if possible.",1387065600,9,3334,4.642978003384095

699011,5,6303683002,"British filmmaking enjoyed a resurgence, known as the British New Wave, during the late 50's and early 60's, with ""kitchen sink"" films depicting gritty realism, working-class people, and only an occasional happy ending.  A Taste Of Honey is one of the defining films of this time period.

Written by then nineteen-year-old Shelagh Delaney, and first presented by Joan Littlewood at Stratford-upon-Avon in May 1958 as a stage play, it was brought to the screen by director-producer Tony Richardson's Woodfall Films in 1961.  His search for an unknown actress to play Jo, the teenage daughter, culminated in his discovery of Liverpool-born Rita Tushingham, whose ""all-speaking eyes"" stood out in her film test.

The mother-daughter relationship between Helen (Dora Bryan) and Jo (Tushingham) is one of the best on film.  Helen's sluttish ways and egocentric lifestyle prompt some wonderfully catty zingers from Jo.  As the film goes on, we see that Helen truly loves Jo and never lies to her, but that Helen's first priority is Helen.

Jo becomes involved with a black man and with a gay man, highly controversial for 1961 audiences, and experiences a brief period of happiness - a taste of honey - before her mother returns with all of her emotional baggage intact.

A great script gives an actor the opportunity to shine, and Dora Bryan and Rita Tushingham both give standout performances.

Grittily realistic and wonderfully acted, A Taste Of Honey is essential viewing for anyone interested in British Cinema.

7852387,5,6303683002,"The films of the British New Wave have aged quite well. They were important in their day in breaking new ground in terms of themes and characters and especially for their unflinching look at the lives of ordinary working class Britons, who as a group had been totally ignored until this time before which historical dramas and more upper class fare was in fashion. The films were notably gritty, often shot in the Midlands and the north and had an almost documentary quality to their realistic picture of the places where they took place. because of the settings they were often referred to as ""kitchen sink films"" and their protagonists often were an ""angry young man"" but neither term does these films justice for the high level of writing, acting and direction that went into them. They were most often in black and white which somehow added to their gritty realism. They began in the late 50's and lasted to the late 60's (Kes in 1969 is about the last) though in the mid-60's they changed and were generally more comic and were set in Swinging London. The directors included John Schlesinger, Karel Reisz, Peter Yates, Richard Lester and in this case Tony Richardson who was one of the most important.

A Taste of Honey (1961) is one of the most poignant of the entire genre and unusually features a young woman, Jo, as it's central character and introduced Rita Tushingham  in her first film role. The film was wildly daring for its day, a fact that is liable to be lost on younger audiences. The story, by playwright Shelagh Delaney featured a slattern mother, a teenage girl who is pregnant by a black sailor and even more shocking, a sympathetic homosexual character. This was pushing every button possible in 1960-61, when less than a decade before the David niven film, The Moon Is Blue was condemned and censored for simply having the word ""pregnant"" in its script. But what's one of the remarkable things about the film is that it is not about trying to be sensational or shock its audience. Everything is presented as somewhat matter-of-fact, like, ""this is life and it includes all these things too"".

The story is as simple as can be and is set in a poor neighborhood of Manchester. The girl lives with her selfish mother, Helen, for whom she was likely a ""mistake"" and who runs around with men and has to slip out of rented rooms when she is behind in the rent. Jo is a naive schoolgirl of average intelligence and little athletic ability. She drifts from school to school as her mother's moves require and has few friends and  no roots. When her mother basically deserts her for a new man she's found, Jo meets a sailor and ends up pregnant. The sailor is portrayed as a nice and honest guy who really does intend to return, another unusual touch for the day. There are no villains here, just people making mistakes. Jo meets and is befriended by a young homosexual, Geoffrey, and they set up house together with him determined to help her through her pregnancy. I won't go beyond this point for fear of spoiling anything.

With such a simple plot it's the acting that must carry things and here it really does. Rita Tushingham, who became a major presence in British films for a while is absolutely convincing as Jo, with her big eyes, almost ugly duckling face and completely natural acting. Dora Bryan as Helen is so convincing in the role of Jo's mother that it's hard to imagine that that's exactly how she really is. She should have had a longer film career. Murry Melvin with his skinny frame and oddly schoolboyish face became a staple in many British films including Damn the Defiant, Alfie, Barry Lyndon and any number of Ken Russell films.

This is a powerful film that one never forgets and is highly recommended. In fact, seeing a number of British New Wave films in a group is also recommended and is a lesson in powerful film making.

EXTRA NOTE ABOUT THE SONG: A Taste of Honey is probably the most famous title in the British New Wave canon, but that is because of the popular song which does not appear anywhere in the film, even instrumentally, but oddly is not unrelated to the play. The sparse music in the film was written by British Composer John Addison, who became well known for his scores for Tom Jones and A Bridge Too Far. Here the occasional music, often with a carnival air, is used as a satirical or ironic comment. Other, more impressionistic music merely backs moments that otherwise might be too quiet. It's not a notable score though it is capable within the film. The melody and song known as A Taste of Honey was incidental music for the play when it was brought over to New York from London by David Merrick in 1960. Jazz pianist-composer Bobby Scott wrote mood music for the play which ocurred in the opening and closing and as an enter'acte, and was played by a jazz combo. When Tony Bennett saw the play he was so moved by the melancholy music that he requested lyrics be written so he could sing it. It became popular and was recorded by many artists. Martin Denny had an instrumental hit with it in 1962 and Herb Alpert had a much bigger hit in 1965.",1481932800,8,5112,4.568157033805889
