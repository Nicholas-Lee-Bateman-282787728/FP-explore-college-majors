Honestly this was not there best, but it was good, and seeing on dvd was ok because they missed things and of course blurred out the even better stuff. Even though I rated it a three this dvd is a must have for any Motley Crue fan out there.",995932800,,376,3.896103896103896
1622521,5,B00005LMA9,"Just got my copy of Lewd,Crued and Tattooed, very well done DVD, with good sound and picture. I would suggest anyone who wants to rock out to buy this, Thanks Nikki, Vince, Mick and Samantha for a great show. Slide on Mick!!!!!!",995587200,,228,4.4523809523809526
1622522,2,B00005LMA9,"Why did Motley Crue release their first live DVD without Tommy Lee?  This is sacrilege!  I know damn well that there is footage of all of the live shows from the beginning to the end with Tommy Lee.  I would have personally put together a comprehensive DVD from all the past tours featuring Tommy.  If I was him (Tommy), I would consider this DVD a massive kick in the teeth and ass!  A girl playing drums for the Crue is such an insult.  Samantha just does not have the flash, charisma, and nowhere near the power that Tommy has.  Fortunately,  for me I saw the Greatest Hits Tour a few years ago with Tommy and it was great!  Since the Crue were intent on ""giving it"" to Lee they should have atleast had a little mercy on him and atleast put out the DVD with Randy on it.  I guess it shows where their heads are at, hell they could not even wait for Randy to get better, they had to screw him too!  Well, as bad a wrap as I am giving the guys I am glad that they put the damn thing out.  I still enjoy watching Vince, Nixxi and Mick jam and I just have to try hard, very hard, very very very hard to pretend what it would be like to see Tommy behind the drumkit.  The special features are nice, the video and sound are great but it only gets 2 ** because the ""THUNDER GOD"" Tommy Lee is not on it.",995500800,12,1298,4.003891050583658
1622523,4,B00005LMA9,"What can I say other than what the Crue says best, with this DVD you can Kickstart Your Heart. This Concert, part of the Maximum Rock Tour from 2000 rocks from start to finish. The DVD which features 15 Crue Hits blasts in Dolby Digital 5.1 giving you the feel of being in the arena. The DVD is presented in an Anamorphic 16:9 Widescreen Format and looks sharp and detailed. The DVD utilizes good use of the Dolby Digital Format. The colors are crisp and overall the DVD is fantastic. Whether you are a Crue Fan or not, this DVD is an excellent piece of music history. The Disc has a lot of features including: a documentary of the making of the CD ""New Tattoo"", the ""Hell On High Heels"" Music Video, the first song ever recorded by the Crue and many other features. Well done... A hughlight for me is the cover of ""White Punks On Dope"" and the fierce and solid drumming skills of Samantha Maloney who filled in for Randy during his illness. A piece of Crue History at it's finest.",995500800,10,981,4.336956521739131
1622524,4,B00005LMA9,"What a totally awesome concert DVD. Widescreen anamorphic brings the entire stage to life. You ARE at the concert. The Crue are up to their usual tricks: flashpots, explosions and Girls, Girls, Girls!! A feast for the senses. All of the favorites are there: Shout at the Devil, Dr. Feelgood and the list goes on. Samantha (from the group Hole) drums up a storm. She could give Tommy Lee a run for the money. A little disappointing is that the concert seems abnormally short and no encore performance. Boo!! The extra stuff is pretty cool. Get treated to an audio-only track of the Crue's first ever recording! Some cool backstage stuff and more. This DVD screams out for a Special Edition: More interviews, longer concert and UN-censored. Basically the Crue needs an R-Rated Edition. But, you will not be disappointed.

The extras on the disc could have been a bit more in depth, but I'm a cruehead I wanna see that kind of stuff. The audio of ""nobody knows"" is so cool. It's a shame they didn't include a cd single with the dvd.

1622539,4,B00005LMA9,"In this performance recorded in 2000 in Salt Lake City, Utah, Motley Crue might be a man down, but the band is arguably as potent, aggressive, and sleazy as they have ever been, with Samantha Maloney filling in on the drums for a fifteen song set that runs about 75 minutes.

One of the biggest metal bands to emerge from the LA metal scene during the 80's, The Crue made their wild, excessive, and at times potentially self-destructive lifestyle, an integral part of their music.  While other bands also cultivated a ""bad boy"" image, in the case of Motley Crue, there was some basis in reality, as various members of the band have had encounters with the law, and issues with substance abuse and alcoholism.

The band was touring in support of the New Tattoo album, their first recording featuring drummer Randy Castillo joining Vince Neil, Nikki Sixx, and Mick Mars.  Interestingly, Castillo who replaced Tommy Lee, was unable to perform on the tour, and was replaced by Maloney, then the drummer for the group Hole.  Displaying some impressive physical skills, Ms. Maloney is quite imposing behind the drum kit, and powerfully propels the band throughout the entire set.  Also onstage are backup singers Pearl and Marti, who go through several costume changes over the course of the show.

The band eases back on Home Sweet Home, and Don't Go Away Mad (Just Go Away), but for the most part the Crue is blasting through their more well-known rocking numbers.  Highlights include Wild Side, Dr. Feelgood, Looks That Kill, Piece Of Your Action, Shout At The Devil, and Girls, Girls, Girls.  Songs from the new album are strong, and include Hell On High Heels, Punched In The Teeth By Love, and White Punks On Dope.

The video presentation features some decent looks of the band, although the editing cuts are a little on the fast side.  Supposedly shot in HD, image quality seems to be just average.  As you might expect, the focus is Vince Neil, who doesn't disappoint.  He may not have the greatest range, but Vince is not holding back, and is energetic and enthusiastic.  Maloney's drums are very prominent in the mix, while Sixx's bass seems a little subdued, and the bass player doesn't get as much screen time as you might expect.  Guitarist Mick Mars may not have the reputation for being a great technical player, but he has certainly become a very solid rock guitarist.  Although Neil occasionally picks up a guitar, Motley Crue is essentially a three piece band live.  This doesn't leave much space for Mars to really cut loose, but within the limitations he does a great job.  Taking a low key approach, Mars clearly provides the energy that powers the band.

Besides the live concert the DVD contains a number of extras, covering the making of the New Tattoo album, touring, and a previously lost audio track that is supposedly the first song the band ever recorded.  Tommy Lee rejoined the Crue in 2004, but this performance with Samantha Maloney is still a solid live performance that should satisfy most fans.  If the package were a little more polished, it would rate five stars.  Also highly recommended is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Motley-Crue-Carnival-of-Sins-Live-Blu-ray/dp/B0016FWLAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Motley Crue: Carnival of Sins Live [Blu-ray</a>] which features Tommy Lee.",1325030400,,3356,5.0636363636363635
1622540,2,B00005LMA9,"I've always been a big fan of Motley Crue, even when Jon Corabi came onboard because I still think 'Hooligan's Holiday' is one awesome kickass song. I've thoroughly enjoyed Motley's tuneage forever, they're easy to sing to, got the right beat and it's kind of ballsy, not as good as AC/DC or some of the harder edge stuff but listenable. I just can't stand listening to Vince Neil singing live. It's like he's not trying at all, like he's still in rehearsal. He rushes thru the singing, drops entire lines of lyrics and replaces them with just the first word of that line. His singing is rather lazy. The rest of the Crue do a great job and sound great on this dvd, especially Samantha Maloney, who is filling in for then drummer Randy Castillo (Quiet Riot, Ozzy Osbourne), who was ill. Seems odd seeing a female drummer on stage with Motley because all their songs are about women and sex but she makes it work and is a breath of fresh air. Not what you want to hear about a hard rock group but she makes up for Vince Neil's lazy singing.",1308700800,,1039,4.38860103626943
1622541,2,B00005LMA9,"Frankly, do not buy this product.  Get COS live.  That is a real Motley show.  I watched Lewd, Crued and Tattooed on PPV when it came out and it just did not come across as a real Motley show.  There is no Tommy Lee and New Tattoo was not received very well.  Carnival of Sins live is the real deal and the best out there.",1247356800,,322,3.8923076923076922
1622542,4,B00005LMA9,"I almost did not buy this DVD due to the bad reviews, but I am glad I did.

I have read people complaining about Vince Neil missing lyrics in this concert; however, they must be deaf.  Vince rarely misses a beat in this concert, other than when he is playing guitar or doing some wild onstage antic.

The concert is very good, but would have been better if Tommy Lee was drumming.  No complaints about the drumming of Samantha Maloney, she does a great job.  However, she is not as wild as Tommy Lee.

A must have DVD for the true Crue heads.  If you complain about this DVD, then you have never seen Crue live before.",1216425600,,618,4.230769230769231
1622543,5,B00005LMA9,"THE FIRST TIME I SAW AMAZON'S REVIEWS WITH 3,5 STARS AVERAGE AT THE TIME, I SAID TO MY SELF, THIS GUYS GOTTA BE KIDDING ME. THIS CONCERT IS A KICK IN THE BUTT, AND A PUNCH TO YOUR TEETH !!! THIS CONCERT IS JUST AMAZING !!! HONESTLY, I'M NOT AN EXPERT IN MOTLEY'S MUSIC, HOWEVER I REALLY LIKE THEM VERY MUCH, AND I AM DEEPLY GETTING INTO MOTLEY'S MUSIC EVERY DAY. MY SEARCH FOR MUSIC IS RETROSPECTIVE, AS I CANNOT GET THRILLED BY THE MUSIC OF TODAY. THUS, WHEN I FIRSTLY READ THE DVD'S FEATURES, AND I CHECKED A WOMAN ON DRUMS, I SAID, DAMN, THIS GIRL MUST BE SUCH A SCHMUCK... WHATAVER, THE GUITARS MUST BE OK... SO I GOT IT, AND THEN... OH THIS GIRL IS A LOVELY & SWEET KICK ASS !!!. I WAS STUNNED AS I SAW THE PERFORMANCE OF THE GIRL THROUGHOUT THE SHOW. SHE HAD THE RIGHT ATTITUDE AND THE RIGHT BEAT. SHE JUST DID A WONDERFUL JOB. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT IT MEANS TO TELL YOU, HEY YOU, COME IN AND BE THE DRUMMER FOR OUR BAND'S TOUR... SHE HAD SUCH A WEIGHT ON HER SHOULDER... AS I OBSERVED HER VERY CLOSELY, SHE COMMITED FEW IF ANY MISTAKES ON RYTHM... AND ON THE OTHER HAND... SHE HAD THE RIGHT ATTITUDE... IN FINE, THIS WAS MY FIRST IMPRESSION OF THE DVD... APART FROM THIS, THE WHOLE BAND AND STAGE LOOKED SO GOOD, AND SOUNDED SMASHING... THIS GUYS ARE REALLY A TRUE ROCK BAND. AS I SAID ABOVE, MY SEARCH FOR MUSIC IS RETROSPECTIVE AND TRYING TO SAVE ALL WHICH IS TRUE MUSIC, AND GOOD. VINCE, MICK AND NIKKI, YOU STILL ROCK THE HELL OUT OF US. TKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR MUSIC. FOR ALL OF THOSE SO SAD FOR NOT LETTING TOMMY INTO THIS 1ST DVD, THAT'S OK, WE ALL KNOW VERY WELL WHAT KIND OF AN EXCELLENT MUSICIAN TOMMY IS, SO, THAT'S ACCEPTABLE FOR ME.

1622544,3,B00005LMA9,"I bought Carnival of Sins a few months ago and have watched it so many times I'm thinking about seeing if I have a obsessive compulsive disorder.  I just cannot get enough.  So I browsed Amazon to see if they had any more live DVDS and I saw this one.  I read the reviews so I was expecting it not to live up to expectations but I thought what the hell...it's something different and Motley will always be Motley.  Well....not really.  I love Tommy and knew he wouldnt be there so I braced myself for that. Sam did a good job, but you know something...it's not just DRUMS where Tommy was missed.  He does EXCELLENT back-up vocals as well.  His husky voice compliments Vince's high voice and with it gone it just didn't sound right.  Yeah, she hit the notes right, but you know how Tommy is...he POUNDS the notes right.  I could have screamed out loud when I saw her doing a twirly thing with her fingers on the drumsticks.  It felt wrong watching her do that.  I missed him terribly and that's how I feel about the drum part.  Now...Vince.  If you're female, yeah it's worth the money to watch him.  He doesnt have the energy level he had in COS but he does jump around quite a bit and he has a part in it where he flirts with Sam talking about a night they spent at a strip club.  I love to watch Vince, he is so HOT, and he was HOT in this.  BUT...his voice.  My goodness.  Off pitch.  BIG TIME.  There were times he was no where NEAR the actual note.  I bet Nikki was cringing the whole time. Vince nailed it in COS, but not on this.  I was a little shocked that Motley even released this after going back and watching it.  I know Vince has to know this was not his best performance at all.  He was frequently out of breath and missed alot of the words especially on the fast paced songs.  But like I said, if you're female, you can overlook that if you want to watch him strut around.  Now on to my other hot one...Nikki.  Bless his heart IT DIDNT SHOW HIM ENOUGH!!!  I kept wanting to watch him for a while but was getting frustrated at the lack of shots.  He's hot too, and does awesome bass guitar, but I don't think he got the coverage he deserved in this.  Mick did fine.  But over-all the crowd was just so lame that it was hard for them to get into it I guess.  I've often heard them say they feed off the energy of the crowd and this crowd was nothing like Grand Rapids, MI.  So if you're like me and wanted this bc of how well you liked COS, then be prepared to know it's not the same by any means.  So I give it three stars.  It just did not have the chemistry that I've seen when all four original members are there.  Whether they want to admit it or not (and now I think they have finally put differences aside and realized this) Apart they are so-so.  Together they have a special chemistry that makes Motley Crue the best rock band to ever rock this planet.",1145750400,4,2875,4.1338155515370705
1622545,1,B00005LMA9,"Vince neil dosent even complete his own lyrics, he only sings half and stops, and no TOMMY LEE. this dvd sucks! im glad i never saw them live i would want a refund!!",1130976000,,165,4.03030303030303
1622546,4,B00005LMA9,"Ok here's the skinny on this DVD.  I'm a headbanger and a crue fan for what that's worth.  People seem to either love or hate the fact that Sam is on drums and not Tommy Lee.  This DVD isn't perfect...the crowd is lame for one...but hey it is Utah for crying out loud.  There's no big flashy stage show, and Vince hasn't been able to carry a tune for as long I have been buying their albums.  Big deal...it's Crue...and it's live.  After the first three songs, you will be hooked.  This DVD comes to life and rocks your a**.  The band is tight, the sound is great, and if you didn't know Sam Malone was on drums, you would swear it was Tommy Lee.  This DVD has the best live versions of Wild Side and Dr Feelgood I have ever seen or heard.  The two songs from New Tatoo rock just as good or better as any of the old stuff.  I didn't care for White Punks on Dope, and Home Sweet Home, well I've never liked that one anyway.  I like the DVD because it's raw and you can tell the band is totally into the show.  As far as Sam...I think she stole the show...and I personally wish she could have stuck around, but boys will be boys if you believve the rumor mill.  Be that as it may, I think she gave the band a much needed shot of adrenaline.  As far as I'm concerned, Sam brought it just as hard as Tommy Lee and then some, banging as hard or harder than any other drummer I have ever seen.  Is it worth $17 or so for this DVD?  It was for me...I rented it first, then bought it.  If you're unsure...try buying a used copy for less and $10. **Edit** 2/08/10  After careful consideration, watching this DVD in it's entirety at least 4 times, and countless recommendations to friends, I have decided to give Vince some love.  I have concluded, after 30 years of listening to Motley Crue, that Vince can in fact sing quite well.  I personally hope Sam makes it back to the band someday.",1127433600,6,1880,4.138121546961326
1622547,4,B00005LMA9,"Let me start off my review by saying that I am one of the biggest Motley Crue fans on the planet,and I have a huge Crue collection. So when I saw this DVD at a music/movie store at a mall close to where I live today,I was quick to buy it,and I am glad I did.

This is a very cool DVD. It shows Motley Crue performing live in Salt Lake City on July 5,2000,which was six days before they released their NEW TATTOO album. With this DVD,you get to see Motley Crue perform a total of fifteen songs live--mostly stuff from TOO FAST FOR LOVE,SHOUT AT THE DEVIL,THEATRE OF PAIN,GIRLS,GIRLS,GIRLS,and DR. FEELGOOD,but you do get to hear a song that The Crue had recorded for their DECADE OF DECADENCE compilation(PRIMAL SCREAM)as well as three songs off of NEW TATTOO(PUNCHED IN THE TEETH BY LOVE,HELL ON HIGH HEELS,and their cover of The Tubes' WHITE PUNKS ON DOPE). And even though Tommy Lee was no longer the drummer for Motley Crue when this DVD was filmed and released(as well as he was no longer Motley's drummer when they recorded and released NEW TATTOO)here's another cool thing about this DVD:the drummer who you see accompanying Vince Neil,Nikki Sixx,and Mick Mars during their live performance is Samantha Maloney,who was a drummer for the Hole--Randy Castillo(RIP)had actually been hired to take over for Lee,but since Castillo was sick when this performance was shot,Maloney had been hired to fill Castillo's shoes for this performance--not only is Maloney a good drummer,but nobody ever imagined that Motley Crue would have a female drummer,but this DVD and that performance proves that we were all wrong! At times during this DVD,you can tell that Vince Neil is getting hormonal with Maloney on stage,and that is one of the funniest things about this whole DVD.

There are also some pretty cool bonus feautures here also. You get to see a behind the scenes look from when Vince Neil,Nikki Sixx,Mick Mars,and Randy Castillo were making the NEW TATTOO album(it is very cool to see Castillo in the special feautures for this DVD),a behind the scenes look at the Maximum Rock Tour,the music video for HELL ON HIGH HEELS,and among other cool bonus feautures,you get a rare track on this DVD called NOBODY WANTS TO BE LONELY,an unreleased Crue song that was supposed to appear on the re-issued versions of one of their albums but was lost during the re-issuing process and couldn't be on one of their re-issued CDS--since we can't get it anywhere else,I'm glad that that song made it on here! As for the performances on here,KICKSTART MY HEART is an excellent way to open a show,Nikki Sixx's introduction before The Crue performs WHITE PUNKS ON DOPE live is pretty funny,the live performance of GIRLS,GIRLS,GIRLS just rocks,and SHOUT AT THE DEVIL closes this concert nicely--but the whole DVD is pretty cool.

Overall,a very cool DVD. The sound here is a little weak at times,and at times it doesn't seem like Vince Neil is singing on pitch--but other than those two small flaws,the rest of this DVD rocks--it is great to have a DVD that lets me watch great Crue songs performed live by The Crue themselves ANYTIME I want to--I also like the female dancers that dance on stage close to where Vince Neil,Nikki Sixx,Mick Mars,and Samantha Maloney are performing,and the special feautures are pretty cool. This DVD is pretty entertaining,and most Crue fans should be quite satisfied with it--anyway,thank you for reading my review of this,enjoy this DVD,and I can not wait until one month from now-which is when I will get to see The Crue on their tour!!! Rock On!!!",1123372800,9,3564,4.810766721044046
1622548,4,B00005LMA9,"Samantha's drumming is amazing, I was thoroughly impressed with it. I liked what she was doing on some of the songs better than what tommy does at times. I was a little unimpressed with Vince's vocals, they seem to have lost a lot of the kick that his voice once had, and the fact that he skips a bunch of words is kind of annoying, but he was energetic and still fun to watch. Nikki is awesome I like watching his performances alot, he's a better performer than a bass player though, his abilities are quite limited (imo). Mick's guitar playing is amazing as always. The audio production for this dvd is great, although I think that the guitar could be a bit louder it seems to be drowned out by vocals and drums in a lot of spots and gets kind of hard to hear at times. The features are great, I just wish that Mick would actually talk. Nobody Knows What Its Like to Be Lonely is a great song! I personally wouldn't be unhappy if Sam was Motley's permanent drummer, she kicks so much ass. I was somewhat disappointed in the censorship of the dvd, it's supposed to Motley Crue the most excessive, womanizing, decadent band in the world... I think that this dvd failed to capture that aspect of the Crue. I guess like any band, it's all about the music and the music in this dvd is awesome. I'd recomend this dvd to any Cruehead.",1122163200,2,1329,4.32
1622551,4,B00005LMA9,"I enjoyed this dvd...no it wasn't some flashback to shout at the devil or theater.  What it is, is a pretty tight representation of a band long broken up. Vince's vocals are better than i thought they'd be.  Nikki and Mick actually sound interested in their performance....I must disagree with previous reviewers about the tour drummer, Samantha.  While I'm a tommy fan, she brought alot of enthusiasm to the concert that was refreshing.  Any drummmer could see she was a total pro!  I did wish there was more old material....oh well.",1120176000,,534,4.824175824175824
1622552,3,B00005LMA9,"I just purchased this DVD in anticipation of their 2005 tour hoping to capture some of the Crue magic before I see them in the flesh. The main fault of this concert is that is seems to capture them ""neither here nor there"", seemingly in a transition, struggling to find their identity in the post-grunge-now-with-vince-again era. Tommy Lee is noticably absent, and while Sam Maloney is awesome it ain't quite true Crue without Lee. Vince Neil's singing is actually fine but he suffers terribly from being a fat b**stard and struggles to keep up with the tempo of the songs and fit all the words in. He does improve as the concert goes on. On the positive side this is still Crue, and that is enough. The Crue backing singers are gorgeous eye candy, Micks guitar playing kicks ass and Nikki Sixx rocks and livens up the stage with his energy. DVD extras are ok, but Mick (the most curious enigma of the band) doesn't utter a single word during the entire thing which is so frustrating! Hopefully a DVD of the current tour will be released which will see a more assured and cohesive Crue in full control.",1118275200,,1102,4.542713567839196

Yeah, Vince can't sing, never could, but that didn't stop us from flocking to their shows and buying up their records...the band and Vince's charisma made up for it.

""Exposed"" would be a more proper title for this abomination.",1108684800,,419,4.32051282051282

Truthfully if you're into a more country kinda metal then go ahead. As for me, I'm a guitar freak and didn't like it. The first time I watched it I was like what the heck it this!? It's not as lively as I thought it'd be. Pretty much boring. And yes, I do have a mind for music and this one seems like they should lose the singer. He's got a voice but it doesn't match. Take your chances if you want. But to the metalheads out there who look at this, turn away and get something better.",1104537600,,612,3.904

I mean it's their first concert DVD! Otherwise Nikki and Mick rocked and seem to still know how to rock. Samantha is gorgeous as an excellent replacement to Tommy Lee's absence. Although it's no steel cage drum kit twirling NASA. 3 stars for the total effort. If you're a crucial Crue head you find something to enjoy, otherwise..not worth the buy. Hey Motley Crue, next time get Tommy Lee, and rehearse Vince's vocals for about a month or as long as it takes. I don't wanna see another Crue concert DVD this lackluster. I'm not worried about ""extras"" I want a kick ass concert!!!",1091664000,5,755,4.641791044776119

I have live recordings of them back in the day, and he is the same now when doing a concert, as he was when Motley first started. So shut your mouths about Vince. He is doing an excellent job.

All there greatest hits were on it.  So I bought it and took it home and watched it... Tommy Lee isn't even the drummer.  I was very disappointed when I found this out.  Vince Neil's voice isn't even up to date.  You can barely hear the guitar over the screaming fans... this DVD could have been a lot better if they worked on it a little more... I give it 3 stars because the music is there and I'm such a fan of Nikki,1072483200,,565,3.8275862068965516
1622560,3,B00005LMA9,"I was very excited to finally get some official live footage of the band on DVD. The excitement quickly wore off though...
Firstly, the mix is poor (Mick's guitar doesnt make an entrance for about 10 mins). Secondly, Neil sings one in every three of the words in most of the tracks. ""Jimmy....second hand hood.....deals....Hollywood....""etc.
The biggest shame though is the censorship of some very fine .... throughout the show. Overall, buy this only if you are a hardcore Crue fan wanting to document their career.",1059696000,,516,5.011627906976744

The reason Mick does not move around alot is because he is dying and they can't find a cure for him.  So what he stands there he is still kicking ...

1622562,2,B00005LMA9,"Talk about false advertising. With Lewd Crued and Tatooed as the name, the only thing true in the title is Tattooed. It isn't lewd. Girls are flashing all over in the audience, but it is edited so you never see a thing. During the credits there are a bunch of seperate clips of girls doing the same thing...all with black bars of censorship over them. In the documentary, they show tons of girls doing the same thing only fuzzed out. This is Motley Crue, right?! Too bad the viewer doesn't get the feel of a live Motley Crue concert. I can't even believe Motley Crue would allow that type of censorship. The only thing lewd about this release is that Vince is like a fat pig that can only sing half the words. He sounds more like Bob Dylan on crack.
It really isn't crued at all either. It is half crued. Sam from Hole does an excellent job, but she is not Crue. Vince sucked so bad, no wonder they didn't want him in the band. Nikki and Mick are all the only true Crue. The music is great otherwise, but with a DVD you expect a visual element that is worthy of Motley Crue...not so here. They were probably going to record a live CD, but Vince sucked so bad they couldn't do it.",1055030400,2,1179,4.221238938053097

the second fault here is obviously the absense of tommy lee, which is inevitable that you won't witness anything spectacular at this half packed concert. So If you are a die hard crue fan then get this dvd, If not don't be bothered. save your cash",1045958400,4,800,4.375838926174497
1622566,4,B00005LMA9,"Throughout the 80's one name that constantly rang true was Motley Crue.  The band has had its ups, downs and still can put on one heck of show.  This disc helps to showcase the talent that they still have.  Many complain about the lack of Tommy Lee, but he has moved on to other projects.  Instead of him, we have Samantha Maloney replacing the injured Randy Castillo.  And let me just say that Samantha doesn't disappoint.  As a fan of the band, she knew the songs and excelled in performing them.  The concert was taped in Salt Lake City on the Maximum Rock tour in July of 2000.  The show itself is excellent.  Vince, Nikki and Mick are all awesome throughout the show.  The concert is shown in widescreen format and is one heck of a treat.  Songs of old and new are performed.  With the new one gets to hear ""Hell On High Heels,"" ""Punched In The Teeth By Love,"" and ""White Punks On Dope.""  In terms of the old, one gets ""Kickstart My Heart,"" ""Home Sweet Home,"" ""Shout At The Devil,"" ""Primal Scream,"" ""Looks That Kill,"" and others.  All of the songs sound great and it is wonderful to see the band perform at such a high calibre.  But with the DVD, some bonus features are even included.  An audio of ""Nobody Knows What It's Like To Be Lonely;"" the very first song the band ever recorded is great to hear!  Other gems include the video for ""Hell On High Heels,"" a featurette on the making of `New Tattoo,' a behind the scenes feature and even few treats for the computer.  I recommend this DVD as it is indeed a wonderful performance.  As usual the Crue don't disappoint and you'll find yourself living on the ""Wild Side"" every time you watch this.",1044403200,,1651,4.371710526315789

While Motley will never be the same without Tommy, it is good to see that Motley are back, rocking, like they should be!",1041379200,,403,4.246753246753247

Good DVD to crank the [heck] out of...as all Crue Music is....
Most of their hits are on this DVD...but they don't have time to play them all......
It's a DVD you'll watch again and again.......",1033084800,,378,4.8307692307692305
1622569,4,B00005LMA9,"No question about it, the Crue can still rock. Mick has and always will be the most talented musician in the Motley camp and he proves it here. He is one of the most under-rated guitarists ever, what a shame.
The Crue made their stage set look like a Hollywood block, complete with fronts for girly bars, tattoo parlors, etc.. Tommy is missed, but Samantha filled in well. It's a shame Randy Castillo died, he was an amazing drummer with Ozzy and Lita Ford. I would have loved to have seen him play live with the Crue. RIP Randy
Vince can still hit the high notes, but can't sing at the speed which he used to. It was apparant on 'Shout at the Devil'. It's a difficult song to begin with, but Vince was really out of breath on many other songs as well. But it's all part of the live show experience. I would rather have Vince missing words and miscues than watching an obvious studio over-dubbing.
My only disappointment was that there was not enough songs from 'New Tattoo'. It was such a great album and a breath of fresh air for Motley fans. But time at a concert is limited, and you have to make room for the Crue classics.
....and the back up singers were HOT!!!

It was great to see Vince, Nikki and Mick rocking together again.  Vince sounded awesome and is still the greatest frontman in the biz. The set list included a lot of earth shattering crue classics plus some of the new tattoo songs that sounded great live.  Standout tracks would have to be live wire, and shout at the devil.  I hope this is the start of more crue DVDs to come.  It would be great to see them re-release all of the great crue videos on DVD like Uncensored, Dr. Feelgood,& Decade of Decadence digitally remastered on DVD. Or just a compilation of all of there videos in one rockin package.  The Crue are still the greatest rock n roll band on the planet and this DVD is a sure winner.",1026864000,2,816,4.259740259740259

Mick and Nikki's playing is flawless. Vince sounds better than EVER, this really surprised me the most. Most aging rockers lose that edge over time, but Vince only sounds better (NO BS).

While I respect what the review before mine said, I hate the whole concept of the band now. First they promised that ""The band will not go on without all 4 of us."" Then fired Vince and kept going. Then got back together and said ""We will be together no matter what unless someone goes back to drugs."" Vince and Tommy both went back and were able to stay. Then, Tommy Leaves. They picked up Randy. He is good but not that damn good. There is a trend here. A very hypocritical one. I am a musician, and I have covered a number of the songs from all the albums up to Decade. But they have put out nothing but pure crap ever since. Generation was horrible. The only highlight was the re-mix of Shout. But the only reason that was any good was because they used the original recording of Vince's voice. Like the review said, I to dream of the day when they take over again. I dream of the day when they can dominate once more. But i do fear that the day is just a thought that we as music lovers hold onto so that we can believe in something. Until that day comes, do what i do and listen to the old stuff. Hold onto that. Vince, Nikki, Mick, Tommy, Go listen to your music.
