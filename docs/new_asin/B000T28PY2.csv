8207475,4,B000T28PY2,"Not perfect, but good.  If you love the SEC I would certainly recommend it though.  Even if you a fan of just college football in general and of other conferences I still recommend it.

8207477,4,B000T28PY2,"The SEC is arguably the best conference for college football in the entire country. This video chronicles its history from the start in 1933. As a true college football enthusiast, I found this to be a great addition to my video library. History of SEC Football is a must for anyone who lives for Saturdays in the fall.",1338076800,5,319,4.517241379310345
8207478,4,B000T28PY2,"I enjoy watching SEC football every year.  This wasn't what I expected.  I am a die-hard Mississippi State fan and they didn't mention the Bulldogs.  They hardly mentioned the EGG Bowl.  I'm glad they mentioned Bear Bryant.  I despise Tennessee, Alabama, Auburn, LSU, Arkansas, and Ole Miss.  I especially hate Phil Fulmer.  GO MSU!!!",1207353600,5,334,5.074074074074074
8207479,5,B000T28PY2,I bought this for my 8 year old and he (as well as the rest of us) have really enjoyed watching it.  It gives a good history of the overall SEC and each team including rivalries and traditions.,1200182400,5,193,4.078947368421052
