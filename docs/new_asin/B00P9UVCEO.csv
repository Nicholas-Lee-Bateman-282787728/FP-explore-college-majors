6791203,4,B00P9UVCEO,"Heres the truth as I learned it, you have to see My Little Pony Friendship Is Magic  The Adventures of the Cutie Mark Crusaders with a 6 year old.
Truly.
To do a comprehensive review, you need two separate minds coming into this material, one who knows it, one who takes it to heart, and one who is confused and ultimately bamboozled within the first five minutes.
In fact, as my Granddaughter, Mia McGregor, sat on my lap as we viewed this latest entry from Shout! on the long-lasting franchise, I had to stop the DVD to ask her questions.
Actually, when you come back you would not find out unless you had a Mia to ask.  The 6 year old can follow it better than I can, but then the creators obviously know the kids are cued into who all these characters are, even though they are not introduced by name at the beginning of an episode.
For those of you uninitiated, these are three ponies in search of a cutie-mark of their own, just so youll have some names for reference, in case, unlike Mia, you are not 6 years old.
By the way, Mia had me stop the DVD to make this important note:
MIA:  I like Scootaloo a lot.  Shes cool.
At that point, I had no idea which of the three was Scootlaloo.
Mia was also insistent this point be made clear:
MIA:  Shes not Rainbow Dashs sister,  Shes her cousin.
Mia stayed firm that I grasp this distinction.
UhmmmTheres sisters and cousins?  And whos a Rainbow Dash?
It may be important, how do I know, but since the three searchers of cutie-marks are asking questions of ponies who DO have cutie-marks (and none of them apparently are a Rainbow Dash) Ill leave it alone.  I have enough questions about pastel colored ponies appearing on the screen without seeking further confusion.
You can read more of Mia and my reactions in the new Riding Shotgun column http://donmcgregor.com/RS_MyLittlePony.html",1427155200,2,1837,4.5120481927710845
6791204,5,B00P9UVCEO,"My daughter absolutely loves My Little Pony even though not AS much as she use to. We love being able to review new DVD titles for companies and enjoying the movies time and time again. This particular movie is all about adventure for the ponies of Equestria and them obtaining what is known as a Cutie Mark. But, to be able to do that they have to discover a unique characteristic about themselves, which is unlike all the other ponies. Do you think they can do it???

In Equestria, obtaining a Cutie Mark is an important coming-of-age moment for a young Pony. After all, Ponies acquire their Cutie Marks only after they discover a unique characteristic about themselves, setting them apart from all other Ponies. So when Sweetie Belle, Scootaloo and Apple Bloom meet, they instantly become friends and make it their mission to find their Cutie Marks! They are The Cutie Mark Crusaders!

My Little Pony  Friendship Is Magic: Adventures Of The Cutie Mark Crusader episodes include The Cutie Mark Chronicles, The Cutie Pox, Flight To The Finish, Pinkie Pride, and Twilight Time.

For even more Pony fun, PlayDate Digital has announced the new Cutie Pox Storybook App. When Apple Bloom becomes impatient waiting for her cutie mark, she decides to take things into her own hooves! In this interactive story book, follow Apple Bloom and the fillies as they learn that taking the easy path toward your goals isn't always the best way. Enter the world of Equestria in this storybook adventure full of excitement, humor and friendship!  The release of ""Cutie Mark Crusaders"" marks the first of a series of planned collaborations between PlayDate Digital and Shout!

6791205,5,B00P9UVCEO,Awesome cool extreme & worth having in your MLP FIM collection ever and plus the cutie mark crusaders in their very own DVD ever !,1426377600,,130,4.24
6791206,5,B00P9UVCEO,"Thank you Shout Factory for sending us this DVD to review!

Have you ever wondered how ponies in Equestria get their unique markings on their flanks?  My Little Pony: Adventures of the Cutie Mark Crusaders explains the whole process.  Ponies are not born with their ""cutie marks"" - they are obtained when discovering their unique talent or characteristic about themselves.  It's a rite of passage that every young pony strives to achieve.

Sweetie Belle, Scootaloo, and Apple Bloom are three young ponies with one thing in common:  they are all lacking their cutie marks.  They form a friendship and call themselves the ""Cutie Mark Crusaders.""  This DVD collection contains five episodes and spans 110 minutes in length.

All episodes were great and taught valuable lessons on telling the truth, keeping promises, and valuing friendship.  My favorite episode was Pinkie Pride because I totally did not expect to see ""Weird Al"" in this show.  All of my kids enjoyed were pleasantly surprised and enjoyed the whole disc.  I highly recommend this collection to any My Little Pony or ""Weird Al"" fan.",1425772800,,1095,5.022222222222222
6791207,4,B00P9UVCEO,"The SHOUT FACTORY (or whoever it is who chooses which MLP episodes to put on each disk) sure has a strange way of deciding which episodes to put on special theme My Little Pony DVDs. Honestly, this review isn't so much of this disk specifically as it is of all the MLP DVDs. Lets take a look at the ones they've released already (ignoring the season packs where it's all the episodes of one season in one bundle, or the two Equestria Girls movies):

A PONY FOR EVERY SEASON:
Theme: one episode for each member of the Mane Six, where that pony is the main focus for that episode. (Applejack at the center of things in ""Apple Family Reunion"", Fluttershy is main protagonist in ""Keep Calm And Flutter On"", ect.) The problem here: the ""Rarity episode"" is ""Look Before You Sleep"", an episode that is actually as much about Applejack as it is about Rarity! Come on, why can't Rarity's episode be one that's more about her than anyone else, like ""Suited For Success"" or ""A Dog And Pony Show""?

PRINCESS TWILIGHT SPARKLE:
Because of it's name, every episode on this disk should be a Twilight-centered one. Instead we get ""Games Ponies Play"" (an ensemble episode where no one member of the Mane Six is the main focus, but it's equally about all of them. There's nothing wrong with an episode like that, but on this particular DVD they should all be Twilight-centered) and ""Mmmystery On The Friendship Express"" (an episode that's actually more about Pinkie Pie, even though Twilight does help her solve the mystery of who ate the cake, Pinkie is even the one who writes the letter to Princess Celestia at the end!) I think episodes like ""The Ticket Master"" and ""It's About Time"" would've been better picks for this disk. Also, the episodes are out-of order; ""Magical Mystery Cure"" (the last episode of season 3, where Twilight becomes an alicorn princess) is the second episode on this disk!

PINKIE PIE PARTY:
""Feeling Pinkie Keen"" is actually as much about Twilight as it is about Pinkie. In fact, the episode is shown mainly from Twilight's perspective. I think it would've made more sense to have put ""Mmmystery On The Friendship Express"" on this disk rather than on the PRINCESS TWILIGHT SPARKLE one.

THE KEYS OF FRIENDSHIP:
What in Blue Blazes is ""Pinkie Apple Pie"" doing on this disk?! That's not even a ""key"" episode! Pinkie's episode here should've been ""Pinkie Pride""! And where are Rainbow Dash and Applejack's episodes, ""Rainbow Falls"" and ""Leap Of Faith""? Did the guy picking the episodes to put here just not like the characters Ashleigh Ball voices and decided to exclude their key episodes?

Finally, we come to the Cutie Mark Crusaders disk. And, sure enough, there's an episode that doesn't belong here: ""Pinkie Pride"", which should've been on the ""keys""  disk, is here instead, and it's NOT a CMC episode! Applebloom and her friends are just shown in the background, they don't even have any dialogue! How about instead including ""Call Of The Cutie"", where the origin of the CMC is shown?

Finally, the disks A PONY FOR EVERY SEASON and SPOOKTACULAR PONY TALES each had six episodes on them. So why can't the rest of the MLP disks have six as well instead of just five?",1419552000,2,3179,4.706834532374101
6791208,5,B00P9UVCEO,"Although the product proper has not been released, given that the episodes contained have been announced and viewed already, I feel I can give a fair assessment of how this DVD compilation will fare. The episodes within are;

Season 1:
""The Cutie Mark Chronicles""
Season 2:
""The Cutie Pox""
Season 4:
""Flight To The Finish""
""Pinkie Pride""
""Twilight Time""

Every episode chosen on this disc is an absolute winner. ""The Cutie Mark Chronicles"" is among the first episodes in the series to really showcase the backstories of the main characters, while also highlighting the motivations of the titular Cutie Mark Crusaders.

""The Cutie Pox"" is an especially humorous episode with a solid moral about the value of hard work and honestly earning what you seek the most.

""Flight To The Finish"" is among one of my personal favorites, being one of the few Scootaloo centric adventures, and also among the most emotionally charged episodes. Though quite dialogue heavy, it's very well-written, and one can't help but feel bad for Scootaloo as her self-doubt threatens to take hold.

""Pinkie Pride"", though it only features the Cutie Mark Crusaders as background characters, is still a marvelous inclusion. A musical episode, it contains around six songs ranging from the Disney-esque pieces ""Pinkie The Party Planner"" and ""Pinkie's Lament"", the insanely catchy bubblegum pop of ""Make A Wish"", all the way to polka - featuring performances by none other than Wierd Al Yankovic himself! This episode is a showcase for everything that makes the show stand out; great music, great morals, great comedic value, and great quality on all fronts.

Finally, ""Twilight Time"" rounds up the selections, and it's a strong enough conclusion. The Crusaders learn the hard way about the consequences of abusing ""fame by association"" to their own ends in a way that everyone - their nemesis Diamond Tiara included - takes something away from.

All in all, these episodes are all solid choices that series fans such as myself already likely adore, and I imagine that even the uninitiated would enjoy. One might wonder why ""Pinkie Pride"" was included on the disc as opposed to ""For Whom The Sweetie Belle Toils"" or ""Sisterhooves Social"" to give Sweetie Belle her time to shine alongside the other crusaders, but because the episode is such a strong one, it's really not worth fussing over.

But as it stands, this is a worthy collection that fans will love and even passersby will enjoy. Bright animation, thoughtful morals, catchy music, and solid writing are the order of the day. I highly recommend it!",1416700800,6,2575,5.014051522248243

6791215,4,B00P9UVCEO,"I really enjoyed watching the episodes on this DVD. A few are a little bit too young for my taste but I still had fun watching them.

This DVD is a collection of six episodes from My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. Most of the episodes aren't connected and you might actually need to have knowledge of the show to understand whats going on all of the time. Thats a bit of a problem since I don't watch the show on TV. I originally thought this DVD could be a good introduction to new fans, but by the third episode, Twilight Sparkle had wings all of a sudden, her house was destroyed and she became a princess. None of this was explained and it left me very confused. So this DVD definitely feels like its for people who already have knowledge about the show.

Although I didn't know everything that was happening, I still really appreciate My Little Pony for its great characters and animation. Lets start with the animation. The animation of My Little Pony is fluid, unique and, best of all, colorful. The colors in My Little Pony are amazing. I love the different combinations of colors on all the different characters and how every pony has distinct color combinations. My favorite designs are probably Rainbow Dashs and Twilight Sparkles. Now, characters development is always important and I think My Little Pony has some great characters. The main focus of the show is on six characters, or The Mane 6, as the fan base calls them. Each of them are equally fascinating and all are quite different from each other, which makes the show more enjoyable. Each of them is special. My favorite of The Mane 6 is Fluttershy. I found her really likeable and absolutely adorable. Unfortunately, she doesnt seem to get enough screen time.

I have to say my favorite episode of this collection is A Hearths Warming Tail, which is a parody of A Christmas Carol. The episode excels in parodying the story, yet making it fit the My Little Pony Universe. However, what drives this episode for me are the songs. I love all five of the songs in this episode. I might even listen to them on my own time. I give this DVD 4 out 5 stars and recommend it for anyone ages 4 to 12.

6791220,5,B00P9UVCEO,"It's hard to imagine that I've been following this silly little show for seven years. They're on their seventh season, and while they've had the occasional slip or mediocre episode here and there, when looking at the whole package as a single seven-season wad of content...yeah, I'm calling it. It's about as good as it gets.

See, after seven seasons, shows are usually stagnant, uninspired, just running the motions and not trying anything new. Friendship is Magic, though, still finds way to surprise and satisfy in new ways, and that's mostly a credit to the dynamic world and characters the show is built around.

I've always been impressed with the imagination, creativity, and effort put into this show. Traditionally, My Little Pony's television outings have been fairly cynical endeavors, where it started life as standard Saturday morning thoroughfare and spun downward for decades after. This generation of My Little Pony, however, is one of the most welcome and unexpected surprises of recent television. All the show had to do was display candy colored equines cavorting about being cute and noisy and singing songs to stoke the flames of errant consumerism in toddlers. It didn't have to build a fantastically diverse world inhabited by creatures of classic lore and contemporary creation. It didn't have to weave complex narratives behind each character or choreograph real-life lessons from organic constructs of conflict. It didn't have to pull together a crack team of veteran animators, television producers, musicians, artists, and highly established writers to work together in magnificent harmony.

But it did anyway.

This show has zero obligation to be of any quality whatsoever. Yet it still oozes with quality. You can tell the team behind it worked with the passion, zeal, and caliber to make a previously mundane franchise into the best show they could make it. It was the perfect storm of creators and visionaries working in tandem.  It had absolutely no business being any good, but they went ahead and made it good anyway.

And that's what makes it so phenomenal.",1501632000,24,2094,5.144117647058824

8687113,5,B00P9UVCEO,"I completely enjoyed this DVD. Its fun on the farm with your favorite ponies!  Sounds like fun right! Literally my eyes were hooked on each episode. Three words to  describe this series are - honesty, patience and of course, friendship. This amazing collection of episodes are created by Lauren Faust.

I enjoyed each episode on this DVD because I really got to know what friendship means to each pony. Each episode has a different message, which creates one important message about true friendship. Each pony represents a different face of friendship.

This collection follows seven friends who are tested in  adventures spotlighting every ponys favorite four-hooved apple lover! Everyone learns together the meaning of friendship. Twilight Sparkle, AppleJack, Rarity, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, FlutterShy and Spike take you on an adventure as they experience the power and magic of true friendship. The ponies share adventures and help out other residents of Ponyville, while working out some troublesome moments in their own friendships.  Its all just amazing!

The lead characters are AppleJack (Ashleigh Ball), Rarity (Tabitha St. Germain), Twilight Sparkle (Tara Strong), Pinkie Pie (Andrea Libman), Spike (Cathy Weseluck), Princess Celestia (Nicole Oliver), Apple Bloom (Michelle Creber) and many more.

My Favorite character is definitely AppleJack. She has such an adorable accent that made me fall in love with her! She truly defines being a leader and has a personality that cares mostly about others before herself. She teaches her friends the importance of friendship and the meaning. My favorite part is, by all odds, when AppleJack goes to a spa with Rarity, one of her best friends! Such a girly activity!

The visual and animated effects definitely caught my attention. Starting from the realistic looks at the hospital, the farm that Applejack owns which looks exactly like a real Farm and the Circus which is filled with color. The circus is also full of surprises, especially the magic. It is like a magic show. I really enjoyed this scene.

There is so many different messages in this collection that become one big message about friendship. A  friend is a person who you are able to go to in hard times and a best friend is someone who is basically a family member. The ponies always treat one another kindly and each episode is kid-friendly.

I give this DVD 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 6 to 10, as well as adults.
