6414881,4,B00KD5HFJG,"I'm noticing a five-to-one ratio of positive reviews here over negative ones. Somebody here reminded us that this film isn't so much aimed at converting people as it is for people who already believe. I find the premise behind this film interesting, but any time a story on my local paper's website is about the Church (or any aspect of religion or Faith) the neo-pagans descend on it like that proverbial ""plague of locusts"", with jeering about ""fairy tales about a man in the sky who sees everything"" or ""kool aid drinkers"". On the surface it's too easy to dismiss them as mere ""trolls"", but I know more than one such person personally. And as one other reviewer points out here, selfishness is at the root of a lot of it. People who are into one form of hedonism or another--drugs especially nowadays--and they don't like being told it's wrong. Especially when said prohibitions have their roots in Scripture. So in their minds, people of Faith are sworn enemies of so-called ""freedoms"" the pagans cherish. It's always been around. That old Christmas song ""I Heard the Bells On Christmas Day"" has the line ""God is not dead, nor doth He sleep"". Jesus himself warned his disciples before he sent them out as missionaries that not everyone was going to welcome the Good News they brought. Our Lord's solution to that was for them to ""shake the dust of that town off their feet as they leave as a rebuke to them"". Which doesn't really work when it's your home town, and as such, you're not some outsider just passing through. About the only real flaw I can see to this film is that it depicts a student encountering an embittered professor who attacks his Faith, but come on--the kid pretty much led with his chin. The presence of often-militant atheists and other leftists as professors of philosophy or poli sci is the biggest no-kidding-Sherlock in Western higher education, and a Believer has to tread with great care. So to hijack the class as a ""bully pulpit"" is was only what the prof was already doing, which didn't make it right. And it goes against what Our Lord told His disciples on how to handle unbelievers. It became an ego thing, which Scripture declares to be a no-no. When Jesus said; ""Follow me"", He did not add ""and be ready to kick butt and take names"". The fact that the current neo-paganism is sometimes directly traceable to 911, which produced a flood of accusations of ""See the harm that religion does?"" at times seems moot. Because understanding the most obvious reason for it does not necessarily help.",1402617600,6,2529,4.672645739910314

6414883,5,B00KD5HFJG,When I first heard of the title I thought 'how cliche'. But hey I had a free movie ticket what the hec. But my real hesitation is that I saw the trailer and I thought to myself do I really want to sit through a classroom scene for two hours. To my surprise the classroom scenes lasted all together maybe about 15 minutes. Most of the film is about what happened  outside the classroom but was related to the drama of what was gong on inside the classroom. The moment the film started I was hooked. The acting by all the actors was very good but an academy award needs to go to Kevin Sorbo as the atheistic professor. The movie's plot was believable and convincing and the ending very unexpected. It had a strong evangelical flavor but it was respectful of mainstream religion. Also it was not overly sappy or preachy. I also liked the fact it did not wimp out to being politically correct. Somewhere I got the idea this was Sony Picture release but it looks like I was mistaken. Bottom line is I loved this film. And at the price Amazon is selling  this gem it is a steal! You will not find a better price. It is suppose to release at $29. So buy it now or you'll be sorry.,1402444800,12,1173,4.208888888888889

None of the actors have any talent , there just a bunch of wooden B grade actors who have no talent and no life and decided to make this crap that will be remembered as just another Christian propaganda film , as it should be . All the characters are cardboard and one dimensional , the whole point is to tell the audience they're stupid and that religious conservatives are good , nonreligious liberals are bad . That's it . Stupid yes . Stupid producers and audience , also yes

6414885,5,B00KD5HFJG,"God's not Dead features talented actors giving splendid performances. Multiple plot lines result in a steady increase of drama throughout the film. God's not Dead is quite possibly the only major motion picture illustrating the attack on Christianity so prevalent in our ""progressive"" culture. In essence, Christianity is under assault on two fronts: 1) First, from the atheist, secular main stream media who belittles Christian's faith, behavior and intelligence, and 2) From the democratic/liberal political leadership who commonly cast devout Christians as ""fundamentalists"", ""terrorists"" and generally dangerous people. After all, one need only refer to the words of the current, and worst president in American history to understand his deep seated disdain of Christians: ""And it's not surprising then they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.""

Or who can forget Obama's assault on the Catholic faith, when in 2013, in front of an audience of 2,000 young people, Obama claimed that Catholic education divides people & blocks peace. Or the virtual war against the celebration & recognition of Christmas that liberals, the courts, the left-stream media and many ""progressive/left wing"" politicians have been waging for years.

If the truth be told, the left-stream media, hollywood, liberal activist judges and president Obama can not tolerate dissent or opposition to ""a fundamental transformation of America"".  Christians with strong moral beliefs, a pro-life stance, standards of decency & vocal in opinions of right/wrong are not welcomed or desired in this emerging socialist society.  Nope, highly prized are those who put their faith not in God, but the government and it's ability to provide all their needs, wants, acceptable behaviors, acceptable speech and even appropriate thoughts.

In conclusion, God's not dead is beautiful film with a strong message. It inspires Christians NOT to knuckle under to societal pressure and renounce their faith. God's not Dead also has a message of hope, optimism and joy for Christians of all ages. Don't miss this superb movie.",1402099200,36,2225,5.475218658892128

6414889,1,B00KD5HFJG,"Great acting from Shane Harper (Josh) who plays a character that is the only saving grace to the movie. All the other characters are cardboard cut-outs, unyielding in viewpoints, and there are a lot of different characters (some just left hanging). I expected and would like to have seen more discussion between Josh and professor in the classroom, which should have been the focus of the movie (probably took less than 10 minutes total), rather than side plots that had no bearing on the discussion, especially the sadistic ending. Intolerant to other religions, the movie fails to make any sense, it has great production value and decent acting--they should have gotten a script that made some sense--acting can't save a poor script, it's like putting lipstick on a pig.

These screenwriters are completely ignorant about the definition of an 'atheist', they have the professor claiming to be an atheist but just mad at God for his mothers' death. They're also ignorant of Lee Strobel's excellent movie ""The Case For A Creator""- that movie (more of a documentary but completely engrossing) makes some very good points and makes sense without pushing Christianity like it's a used car. Since ""God is Not Dead"" was made by a Christian filmmaker, this is probably to be expected- but I would be embarrassed to be associated with this effort. According to 5 star reviews, Christians are ok with this nonsense--I can only say ""OK...wow"".

Josh's assignment is to prove that ""God is not dead"" (I'm assuming that means TODAY), all he proves is that philosophers disagree on what happened BILLIONS of years ago (apparently thousands of years, if you believe the Bible). He failed completely to show any CURRENT proof of a 'God' (answering prayers, mitigating evil), but the professor folded like a cheap suit and the entire class changed their collective minds like a bunch of lemmings. Nothing else makes sense in the movie. Terminal cancer--God has a plan, He thinks you're better off dead. Other religions are mean to you--Christians will pray for you. Sadistically run over and killed by a truck-- ha-ha, too bad you're an atheist, good luck.

So, if it's entertaining to see Christians pat each other on the back and put down other religions without any reasonable explanation- have faith- you'll love this movie. If you would like to see some intelligent discussion on religion- look elsewhere, don't waste time and money here.",1397088000,18,2427,5.002475247524752
6414900,1,B00KD5HFJG,"Gods not dead, but this movie is. It starts out with a atheist forcing his beliefs on others. A Christian or atheist is not allowed to do this in any school. .

Sorbos' character wasn't anywhere near qualified to teach a collegiate philosophy course, given that he left fallacious argument after fallacious argument go unchecked.

6414947,5,B00KD5HFJG,"Belief in God and Jesus is a matter of faith, a matter of trust, and a matter of hope.  Youre not going to prove them to be like you might offer a proof of a car parked in your driveway.  Immaterial reality is not proven by material methods.  But just as you cant prove that God exists neither can you prove that God doesnt exist.  And the same can be said for so many other immaterial or unseen realities that we accept because we experience them in vicarious ways, like gravity for instance, or like thought and information.  We are accepting of a lot of things on faith on a daily basis, even on a moment by moment basis, never even being aware of our operating in such a capacity.  Unfortunately for the western world who essentially placed their faith in a materialistic science as the arbiter of all that is true or not true faith in God seemed to be de passe, outdated, superstitious, and just plain silly.  It certainly hasn't helped that many Christians have turned their brains in at the church door and have not had a serious interest in understanding not merely the merits but the principles and reasons and realities upon which their faith rests.  For even though belief in God and Jesus is a matter of faith, that faith doesnt have to (and I don't believe should be) blind or unreasoned or uninformed.  What the entertaining Gods Not Dead movie does so well is present fairly briefly some information on how and why belief in the Christian faith is actually rational.

If youve seen the trailer then you know the premise of the movie: a philosophy professor uses his class as a bully pulpit to satisfy his notion (and desire) that God is dead and in order to pass the class they must write out and sign a statement that God is dead or else they fail the class and risk the professors ire and his having to go over the tedious reasons why God is dead.  But one student refuses to go against his belief.  America should cheer this because our current culture is all about being and expressing yourself, your identity, and your own personal truth but of course that stops cold when traditional religion like Christianity or Catholicism or Judaism is part of ones truth  Anyway, the professor tries to humiliate and cow the student into submission and when this doesnt happen he gives the student time in class to present his arguments while fully expecting the student to suck at it and for him (the prof) to be able to publicly chastise and embarrass the student.  So in a way this is like an underdog story, or a David vs. Goliath story, and thats usually a winning narrative format.  So here it is.  But this film is entertaining because it weaves an unexpected connection of peoples stories together that allows them to have crises of faith or conscience, and some of the stories are very human and all too near to many of us (such as one of the characters who is hostile to Christianity and ends up diagnosed with cancer).  How they do or don't resolve these issues is sometimes cloying and simplistic but the characters, all except for one, are treated with a decent sensitivity so that we connect to them emotionally.  And that too helps with the films ability to entertain because it really feels personal at times, as it should, because the gospel of Jesus Christ is extremely personal when it comes down to it.

Some people will (rightly) point out that the film isn't being fair to atheists/ an atheistic belief as its not allowing them to present their POVs accurately; but to criticize a Christian film that is specifically and purposefully promoting its Christian message in an entertaining manner as not giving the alternate (and, mind you, currently dominant western worldview) is just a silly and cynical criticism.  Some people will also point out (rightly) that the film also stands as a commercial for some Christian media product such as the bands the Newsboys and Tait and Duck Dynasty.  I completely agree that the film didn't need its heavy emphasis on these products if you want to look at it as such but they do serve to show a public who may have certain perceptions of Christians as being stodgy and dreary as actually being intelligent and able to enjoy life, and not just frump around moralizing on different topics.  So while I feel the film could have been maybe a bit stronger narratively without using the star power emphasis I also understood it.  It distracts at times, but its also okay in the overall scope of the movie.  Still, this does make me dock the film to 4.75 stars, if that even matters, but I still thoroughly enjoyed and was even a little surprised by the film.  Perhaps this film will make a believer out of you?",1521244800,,4674,4.575539568345324

6414954,1,B00KD5HFJG,"(Spoiler alert) In this movie, a Christian college student is required to prove the existence of his god in a philosophy class, or risk failing the course, because the professor has declared that his god is dead. The student basically accepts the theories of evolution and the Big Bang, but insists that there must be a god since science doesn't explain everything. He also claims that religion is necessary for morality (no secular counterargument is offered). In the end, his goal is to get the professor to allow students to decide the existence of their god for themselves.

While I support the idea of being free to decide whether to believe in a god or not, the rest of the plot line of this movie is loaded with Christian arrogance. A Moslem woman gets kicked out of her home by her father for being a secret Christian without any discussion -- a unlikely scenario. The father is simply portrayed a rigid and intolerant. The Christian minister she's been listening to is Franklin Graham. The fact that Graham is a rabid Islamophobe is never mentioned.

Meanwhile, an atheist blog reporter learns she has advanced stage cancer. Her boyfriend heartlessly abandons her when she tells him about her condition. She is portrayed as all alone with no friends until she tells some Christian rock singers she came to interview about her diagnosis. They convince her to ""accept Jesus.""

Finally, when pressed by the student, the philosophy professor admits he became an atheist because of the death of his Christian mother from cancer, as if people lose their religion only due to traumatic events. As he is having second thoughts about his atheism and is on his way to the Christian rock concert, where all the new Christians appear to be heading, including a Chinese student who became a Christian against his father's wishes, the professor is struck by a hit-and-run driver. A Christian minister on the scene convinces the professor to become a Christian on his deathbed.

The message of the movies seems to be that once people ""learn about Jesus"" or in times of crisis, they'll become Christian and never again question the existence of the Christian god. (But the converts can only be Moslems or atheists. If the movie had shown a Jew converting to Christianity, it would've been branded as anti-Semitic and set off a firestorm.)

The fact is more and more people are becoming nonbelievers. This is due to the availability of information on the internet that questions Christianity as well as other religions.

6414956,5,B00KD5HFJG,"I watched my younger brother who was a active member in church go to college to major in phycology come home not only a Atheist but taught that anyone of faith was of inferior intellect!!!  The truth is the finest minds in just about all fields of the hard sciences are Christians !!!  This includes Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton & Nikola Tesla just to mention a few!  This is a fact based movie that is action packed...not with explosions & sex & violence but with emotion, tolerance well developed characters & both cerebral & spiritual action.  It is a very sad commentary about our society that this movie cannot be shown in schools when our country's founding fathers dedicated our country with prayers to God !!!  We are in the middle of a second revolution both spiritually & physically as our current President is fighting to drain the swamp of Satanist that were one election away from totally destroying this country!!!  God is definitely NOT DEAD he is giving America a chance to repent knowing our past leaders have lied & deceived us & there are more good people in America than evil!  This movie helps bolster your faith & please pray that our living God protects all the patriots fighting so hard to pull our country out of the grips of the Luciferians trying to tear us apart!!!

The professor came across as an abusive jerk and the professors at the dinner party seemed like terribly rude people. The plot about the Muslim girl was offensive. The reporter was a vegetarian and cared about animal rights.  I didn't like the Willie cameo, nor the joking about killing ducks...killing animals is selfish and un Godlike.  (Jesus did not eat meat.)

6414977,1,B00KD5HFJG,Cringeworthy.  I watched this film embarrassed as a Christian.  Not just because of the cheesy storyline and bad acting  but the narrow minded points of view are humiliating. The shallow portrayal of non christians was an extreme disappointment and embarrassment.  The only people who could approve are those who espouse the same shallow beliefs.  Who live their lives without questioning the spiritual bullet points that they live by.  What is wrong with intelligent discourse among christians? What is wrong with accepting that we do not have all the answers?,1514246400,2,561,5.247191011235955

This movie is horribly written, terribly shot, and the actors are Z list and cant act their way out of a paper bag. Its predictable, hokey, proposterous, and anti-climactic, as the principal character dies at the end, RIGHT AFTER SEEING THE ERROR OF HIS HEATHEN WAYS!

Save your money. Dont waste your time. I saw it in the theater and my two Christian friends FELL ASLEEP during it because they were so bored.",1512432000,,485,4.6395348837209305
6414982,1,B00KD5HFJG,"(Spoiler alert) In this movie, a Christian college student is required to prove the existence of his god in a philosophy class, or risk failing the course, because the professor has declared that his god is dead. The student basically accepts the theories of evolution and the Big Bang, but insists that there must be a god since science doesn't explain everything. He also claims that religion is necessary for morality (no secular counterargument is offered). In the end, his goal is to get the professor to allow students to decide the existence of their god for themselves.

While I support the idea of being free to decide whether to believe in a god or not, the rest of the plot line of this movie is loaded with Christian arrogance. A Moslem woman gets kicked out of her home by her father for being a secret Christian without any discussion, a unlikely scenario. The father is simply portrayed a rigid and intolerant. The Christian minister she's been listening to is Franklin Graham. The fact that Graham is a rabid Islamophobe is never mentioned.

Meanwhile, an atheist blog reporter learns she has advanced stage cancer. Her boyfriend heartlessly abandons her when she tells him about her condition. She is portrayed as all alone with no friends until she tells some Christian rock singers she came to interview about her diagnosis. They convince her to ""accept Jesus.""

Finally, when pressed by the student, the philosophy professor admits he became an atheist because of the death of his Christian mother from cancer, as if people lose their religion only due to traumatic events. As he is having second thoughts about his atheism and is on his way to the Christian rock concert, where all the new Christians appear to be heading, including a Chinese student who became a Christian against his father's wishes, the professor is struck by a hit-and-run driver. A Christian minister on the scene convinces the professor to become a Christian on his deathbed.

The message of the movies seems to be that once people ""learn about Jesus"" or in times of crisis, they'll become Christian and never again question the existence of the Christian god. (But the converts can only be Moslems or atheists. If the movie had shown a Jew converting to Christianity, it would've been branded as anti-Semitic and set off a firestorm.)

The fact is more and more people are becoming nonbelievers.  This is due to the availability of information on the internet that questions Christianity as well as other religions. It's not because of traumatic events. Some Christians (not all) feel that they're under siege because their beliefs are being questioned, and they're losing the dominance they once had. They also don't like the fact that intolerance toward non-Christians as well as LGBT individuals is increasingly frowned upon.

""God's Not Dead"" was made by Christians for Christians, and certainly portrays non-Christians as shallow.

Disclosure: I was raised as a Christian but became an atheist thanks to science. What evidence is there that any gods exist? Answer: None. The bible and all the other ""sacred"" texts only prove that there's a belief in a god. I know many atheists. They also became atheists because of science, not because of some traumatic crisis.",1512172800,,3262,4.961538461538462

6415020,4,B00KD5HFJG,"I'm a Christian trying to get right with God from some time strayed , but during this new journey I won't abandon principles that many Conservatives might consider to be anti Christian...

Having gotten that out of the way, I did like this movie overall. I felt the arguments during college philosophy class were good in favor of theism even if this could have been deeper and more complex. I tend to think, however, these kind of debates are pointless because both atheists and believers will chase each other in full circles forever.
Some things I didn't care for were the generalizations created with the use of drama towards liberals, Muslims and even philosophers. The movie was very dramatic and black and white portraying believers and non believers. The philosophers dinner party was a good example. His girlfriend, who was in charge of this dinner party, was heavily ridiculed by each attendee to this party for her beliefs. A ridiculous assumption to think that all these non believers could be so cruel. Another example was the cheap shot at the Muslims, concerning Muslim fathers. I will not disagree that many Muslims are fanatical like him, but not all, and of course the movie makes no mention of these individuals. And lastly the attack on the liberal reporter. I'm just going to make my personal statement that Jesus was a liberal. And bringing the Duck Hunter guy into this movie? Big joke..
I believe in Jesus, I believe he was the son of God. I believe faith in this is key to the Kingdom of Heaven.. let's make movies that focus on this instead of these ridiculous generalizations about humans who don't see things the way Western Conservatives see them.",1497916800,,1675,4.795847750865052

6415039,1,B00KD5HFJG,"This is a heavy handed convoluted pro christian movie. Faith is fine but there were plenty of false premises presented in this movie. First of all, all the people in the movie that didn't identify as christian were selfish and self important. You do not have to be a christian to be a good person.  And claiming christianity does not automatically mean you are a good person. The film argues that without god all things are permissable. I have a couple of problems with this. The main character argues that god gives you free will to make choices while saying at the same time that without god you can choose anything. What? You should do good and be good because you are a human being living in a world with other human beings. Not so you will be rewarded. There are plenty of good non-christians in the world. The main character is smug. He is in a big hurry to take credit for his faith. Being atheist is not the same thing as believing that god is dead. The professor in this movie is not atheist. He is hurting and has loss faith because of a personal loss in his life. Instead of exploring that the writers just made him a non-caring person. All people are flawed but all the non-believers in this movie were beyond flawed. While all the believers were good, and in one case, victimized because of it. Grief is a normal and healthy emotion to feel when you lose someone you love. Even if you believe they are in heaven it is still ok to hurt and miss them. If ypu take comfort in that belief it doesn't mean you can't grieve your loss. I'm not saying god is not real or that god is dead. I'm saying this movie was horribly written and had overly simplified answers for everything.  It was more like a movie with an agenda than a story of faith.",1494720000,4,1750,4.3323170731707314

6415082,5,B00KD5HFJG,"Excellent movie that addresses ways our faith can be challenged at home, work and at school. Nowadays it is so easy to just cave in and blend in with the majority, but that is not the fact here. Josh stands up for what he believes and defends it. Matthew 10:33 says ""But whoever disowns me before others, I will disown before my Father in heaven."" And, I think more importantly in 1 Peter 3:15 it says ""...Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have..."" This movie compels you to look inward and ask yourself, ""If I found myself in similar circumstances, am I ready to do the same?"" I think one of the most compelling arguments is when the professor is confronted by Josh who is obviously angry at God who he claims does not exist, that God is dead. Josh simple says, ""How can you be angry at a God that doesn't exist?"" Answer: You can't! Also, there is a scene in the movie that addresses why does life seem to go so well for those who choose not to believe, again a very thought provoking statement made by a mother to her son. This movie is great for teenagers and up. It illustrates a faith worth fighting for. Empowers one to stand for their faith. We know that Satan became god of this world when Adam sinned. He is the thief that comes to steal, kill and destroy not God. Jesus came for those that were oppressed by the evil one...Satan is the author of sickness, but of course God continues to be blame for everything...though this is not addressed in the movie. The professor lost his faith in God because his mother died of cancer and God didn't heal her. He blamed God for it all. His mother was a believer and had strong faith. Depending on how you look at it, she was healed...she is no longer sick, nor in pain, etc., just not the way he wanted it. I won't spoil the ending, but I will say this when the Pastor says, ""God has shown His mercy..."" and gives an example of what He means it is a profound statement that puts a lot into perspective for the viewer. Of course, Newsboys is great. This is a clean family movie. A movie I think everyone should see. I have even watched God's Not Dead 2 and it is just as good.",1487635200,2,2195,4.228571428571429

6415214,1,B00KD5HFJG,"The acting is great, but the characters are unbelievable, as is the entire premise.  **SPOILER ALERT!**  A professor insists that students sign a paper saying God does not exist?!  Really?!  The student, if not multiple students wouldn't go to the administration and complain about this?  The guy would still have his job?

The message(s) in this film are a little bizarre.  The other professors are jerks to his girlfriend who prepared the meal, they complain that the wine is bad.  I know plenty of professors at a variety of institutions and none would be so shamelessly rude at a dinner party.  In general, Christians, good, everyone else, bad.  However, the professor, who at the end, accepts Jesus and God and goes to tell his girlfriend this, gets hit by a car and dies.  And the dying girl accepts Jesus and God and then dying is okay.  And what is it that we're trying to take away from this?

And let's not forget the anti-Muslim message that if your child becomes Christian, you physically beat her and throw her out of the house.  Great, let's get the Islamiphobes in on it.

The student's defense that God exists is at best, a rhetorical and circular argument and would never convince anyone, let alone an entire classroom (I believe every single students stands and supports him, with no one left unmoved by his argument.  Right.).

Perhaps the film is meant entirely as parable and metaphor.  It still doesn't work and portrays a mysterious and harsh God, very Old Testament.  Convert, and He'll smite you down in the rain.

It's interesting to watch, but there's just way too much wrong with it as a film, as a message, and the director, writers and producers should be ashamed of themselves.  I cannot imagine God being happy with this one.",1475020800,3,1757,4.713815789473684

6415218,5,B00KD5HFJG,"I recently watched the movie God's Not Dead 2. I loved the 1st one, so I thought Id give this one a shot. I say shot cause sequels have a bad history of being any good. And a good sequel to a Christian movie is practically an oxymoron. But I decided to try anyway.

Ok, I will start with the good. Like Gods Not Dead, two was well acted. Everyone did a good job in this movie. I was quite impressed with it from this perspective.

I still prefer the 1st one, but I thought this one did a good job of trying to prove Gods existence. In fact, I am going to order the 2 books that this movie references so i can give them a go myself.

Ok, now for the not so good.

I thought Gods Not Dead was not really a sequel. It was more like a stand alone movie. A sequel should be a follow up to the original. This one did try to still prove Gods existence, but took a different route entirely.

For me, a sequel to Gods Not Dead would have explored some loose ends that were left from the original movie or followed up on what seemed like possible story lines from the original.

For example, what came of Josh and his ex-girlfried? Maybe after Josh won in professor  Radisson's class, maybe she wanted to get back together with Josh. How about what came of Josh and that girl with the Muslim father that got kicked out of his house.

How about a follow up on professor Radisons family as a result of him dying and accepting Jesus at the last second.  There were many left overs from the 1st movie that could have been explored.

Next, is a personal pet peeve of mine. The 1st movie was not over the top Christian with lots of Christianesss and such. So it made a good cross over movie that would appeal to non-christians looking for answers.

Gods Not Dead 2 started off with Christian speak and prayer, and had this throughout. So chances are less that a non-Christian would find it appealing. Since the main purpose of the movie was to prove that Gods not dead to Non-Christians looking for answers, for me, this made the movie more for Christians only. So the main purpose of the film was a failure.

My next issue with the film was the trial. It was over the top with Christian stuff that I am pretty sure would never be allowed in a real court of law. I think the writers would have done better to have the case of proving God brought before a school board of something like this. which would have also connected it to the original movie.

So all that to say that while I did enjoy the movie, I think from the perspective of what the movie was, or should have been, aimed at (Non Christians), the movie was a failure.",1474761600,,2612,4.2

It seems that a few very out-of-touch novices got together in someone's kitchen to hatch such a half-baked script to promote their version of Christianity, which by the way is completely off-base. The terrible stereotypes in this film are truly beyond belief and disgusting. Also, other than Dean Cain and Kevin Sorbo, who must really be hurting for movie roles to agree to be in this movie, the acting is beyond terrible.",1473206400,11,714,4.860655737704918
6415238,1,B00KD5HFJG,"This is a movie based on caricatures. The god-complex philosophy professor. The overbearing girlfriend. The insensitive, Ayn Randian stock trader. I think the only actual believable character is Josh, trying to defend his faith. While there are professors who are as unpleasant and insecure as Sorbo's character, threatening to destroy a freshman's future career prospects because he doesn't agree with him, in an elective class? Seriously? No one does that. That would be grounds for academic discipline. If he's not tenured, he'd be out. But, while academics can be thin-skinned, no one is going to be this threatened by a freshman in an intro class. However, the exercise he puts Josh through would actually be a great learning tool. Both for him and the class. And that's what college is for: challenging ideas, and teaching.

It's heavy handed. The Muslim fighting against her family and her families religion, as if it is any worse or better than Christianity? The relationship squabbles between the Professor and his Christian wife? Or his colleagues at the dinner party? Atheists are not evil people. They aren't giant ego-maniacal jerks, any more so than Christians or Muslims or Jews or Jainists or anyone else can be. And, atheists don't hate God, they don't believe in God.  Why would you hate something you don't believe exists? But this movie, and other depictions of atheists in media, would have you believe otherwise.

If you are a believer, that's great. If you aren't, that's great too. People are people. This film seems to forget that, or willfully overlook it. It's pretty terrible. But chances are, if you're watching this, you aren't like me, you've already made up your mind, and you're a fan of this drivel.",1473120000,25,1733,5.010416666666667

Bad things happen in life but the most profound statement I loved in the movie was when the woman with dementia stated this to her son who was questioning why good people like her get dementia and people like him who are dishonest and mean seem to have a good life and she replied with ; sometimes the devil allows people to live a life of comfort because he doesn't want them to see their need for God.",1472947200,,813,4.139240506329114

This movie is ridiculous.  It shows how disconnected Christians are from reality in America, and more importantly, college institutions in America.

First off, i've taken many philosophy courses in college, and in NOT ONE of those courses, was Richard Dawkins ever mentioned.  He is not a professor of philosophy, and he would tell you the same.  He is a biologist.

None of the professors in the classes that I attended were this straightforward or overbearing with their ""lack of belief.""  I wasn't even sure where a few of them stood on the subject of God.  They simply stated the ideas of the different time periods and the important philosophers associated with those periods and what THEY thought about God.

You were free to draw your own conclusions, and they welcomed spirited debate and discourse.  Philosophy means a love of wisdom, and none was ever gained or learned without a difference of opinion and without minds being changed.

I do give the Christians credit for living up to their stereotypes though.  Very accurate in that regard.  Other then that, typical non-sense and drivel.

Making the professor an atheist because he hates God and is angry is, to an actual atheist, like hating the Tooth Fairy. Even more disturbing is the argument presented that morality has no purpose unless there is a higher power in charge of dispensing reward and punishment. Morality for the sake of being moral, for the sake of simply conducting oneself honorably and respectfully in the world, is enough for many people.

Asian transfer student, ""so basically your saying christ is god?"".... what!? This obviously isn't a direct quote from the movie but that's the basic jist of the disconjointed dialouge. Also, i swear there were easily 6 different plots going on in the movie. One of them was a muslim girl who was abused by her dad for being a part of american culture and wanting to be christian.

6415308,1,B00KD5HFJG,"This is a christian missionary movie that only has a chance of convincing devout christians. A classic preaching to the quire, and even there it has to be a very naive quire to even bother. Only place where it may work is a naive teenage christian camp.

The idea can work if the screen writers ever cared about that happening. They put up a freshmen against a philosophy professor, but the professor obviously has zero ability in carrying a claim through, the students raises a few ideas that could be developed but that would require actually going into hard discussions that the screen writer obviously doesn't want to do since that would interfere with the idea that mentioning jesus should win any argument. In the end everybody accepts Jesus as their savior for no explicable reason.

There are several side stories that are not developed, have nothing to do with the story and only confuse things, with the only thing that ties things together is the fact that they all meet at a christian rock concert in the end.

There is also the problem that the movie assumes that proving that there is a god (which it doesn't even get close to start discussing the question) seems to be assumed to be synonymous with proving the Jesus is the god, while the way the movie goes, assuming any proof was actually going in, it could just as well prove that any other religion is the true one.",1470441600,5,1384,4.5951417004048585

6415310,5,B00KD5HFJG,"The LEAST free place in America, and ALL of the Western world, is the college campus. In the United States, your INALIENABLE RIGHTS to FREE SPEECH and religious expression are no longer recognized at these institutions.

This blatant bias is EXCLUSIVELY leveled at Christianity, and any political ideology that dares to contradict or even question the overtly leftist programming that it is now mandatory on almost all campuses. This discrimination does NOT apply to any other religion EXCEPT Christianity. No university will ever impede the activities or public demonstrations of  muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, pagans, or even satanists. Only Christianity is effectively banned from the public forum. Judaism is slightly held in such contempt, but not nearly as much.

In this uplifting movie, a new student finds himself unexpectedly in an unprovoked confrontation with the professor of the philosophy class, merely for daring to state his belief in God. Typical of so many similar conflicts, the leftist professor takes the student's right to free expression as a personal affront, and embarks on a campaign of harassment and humiliation with the intent to ""destroy"" the dissenting student. Our hero could easily do what so many of us have done, sit back, listen to the apparatchik professor's propaganda, write papers agreeing with the class commissar, and get an easy ""A"".

...And sometimes we feel compelled to comply with a higher principle, ...and a HIGHER POWER.

This movie features several subplots, all the characters are largely strangers to one another, but cross paths in some minor of major way. Each has their own particular struggle with their beliefs, just as we all must eventually face the truth of our own existences. In the end, only you can make the choice, right or wrong...

I vividly remember being one of those apparatchiks. I thought I was so ""progressive"" and ""sophisticated"" because I believed in ""secularism"", not religion. I really wanted to BELIEVE a lot of the idealistic and emotion-based propaganda I was fed in public-school and college. I told Jesus jokes, ...just to offend people who believed in Him.
Then, knowing I HAVE to be objective in order to be legitimate, I had to at least read what He had to say...
...And I realized that I have ALWAYS believed in what He was teaching. I realized I was ignorant, and I that I was not nearly as ""enlightened"" as I would like to believe I was.

6415386,1,B00KD5HFJG,"This movie is utterly abhorrent. ""Birth of a Nation"" and all the anti-Jew propaganda from World War II COMBINED can't even measure up to this schlock.  This is a figurative and literal hitpiece detailing how Christians are perfect and everyone who's not Christian is a vile, loathesome piece of scum who will get what is coming to him/her.

So I did not know this, but apparently God gives terminal cancer to liberals who believe in evolution. He also makes their significant others mercilessly break up with them when they learn of said cancer. But we're JUST getting started folks! Did you think atheists don't believe in God? NOPE! Apparently they're all just former Christians who hate Him and try to steer others away from the truth of the gospel right up to the point they see the error of their ways and then get KILLED BY CARS. Oh, and did you know that all Muslims are tyrannical child abusers except the ones who want to defect from Islam into Christianity? It's true!!  I love how ALL of these disgusting caricatures are OK and receiving rave reviews from Christians! I wonder how the same people would react to a counterpiece about biology scholars encountering a psycho Christian whose hobby is slaughtering people as they leave abortion clinics?

Oh, and as an extra special bonus, be prepared to hear a re-iteration of every non-sequitur strawman argument that Christians THINK atheists make to debate the concept of a theistic god ever told. All refuted, of course, by scripture, which literally makes the Christian's argument an exercise in invalid circular reasoning.

That's it. This film is probably the most offensive thing I've ever had the displeasure of viewing.  If you like this movie AT ALL, there is something clinically wrong with your head. That's not speculation; it's a fact.",1466380800,8,1807,4.908196721311476

6415408,5,B00KD5HFJG,"I wasn't to sure how I would like this movie, but I must say it superseded my expectations. In the beginning I wasn't too sure how the story line would follow but, I loved how they used a real situation that some believers encounter with non believers. It was also challenging because the non believer happen to be a professor and it's hard to get a message to someone of such caliber sometimes. As the story continues and God is revealed in the heart of the non believer the feeling you get is so surreal even though it's just a movie but it relates truth in real life.

This movie gave me chills as I continued to watch and no lie, when they were telling others to spread the message, ""God's Not Dead"" I took out my cell phone as well and began to text others the same message because the movie was just that powerful to me. You get this sense of emotion that comes over you and you know it's real! I was so not expecting this movie to do that. I am a believer in God and very proud of it.

So to anyone out there wondering if they should watch this movie, I say, YES! You should definitely give it a try. I've heard nothing but great reviews from others who have watched it as well.

Every character is way over the top and all atheists are downright evil (l am dumping my girlfriend because she has cancer), the story highly lacking in dept (how the heck does a devoted Christian woman end up marrying her evil Christian -hating professor who openly proclaims to hate God and has devoted his career to making his students fellow athiests??), the movie too full of c",1465084800,5,915,4.551515151515152

6415419,1,B00KD5HFJG,"This is basically just pornography for people with extreme views on religion and society.

The entire premise of the movie begins with straightlace student and christian Josh, or something like that, signs up for a class at his college where evil professor babyeater decides that the best way to start off a semester of a logic course is to declare to his class that logic is for suckers and that nobody should challenge his views that god is dead; and as a matter of fact they must now right an essay (on the first day?) about how god is dead.... obviously Josh politely states he cannot and thus a ""debate"" is set to determine if god's dead, or not. The ""arguments"" presented are so terrible a drunken penguin could have come up with a better script, professor evil babbles on about how god allows evil, Josh retorts with freewill than fires his armor piercing question demanding to know why professor moron hates god which some how causes him to break down in tears and confess that it's all because his mom died of cancer... than he gets hit by a car and the movie ends. No seriously. Wooden acting and a completely out of touch script make for a good unintentional comedy if that's what you're into but if you're looking for an actually good movie you could do far better than this cash grab that spent more on advertising that anything else.

Also there's some filler b stories like how a pastor can't find his car keys and gets stuck in a parking lot.",1464998400,10,1458,4.49811320754717

A Gallup poll in December of last year put the percentage of Americans who identify as Christian at 75.2%. Christians are NOT a minority in this country, our society is built for Christians. A Pew Research Center study in 2014 found that Atheists are the second least liked/trusted ""religious group"" in America.

6415492,3,B00KD5HFJG,"I of course agree with the premise that ""God's not dead,"" but I think that the storyline conflates how believing that God exists and believing that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that he died out of love for us to free us from sin is different step that requires a supernatural grace. The movie conflates these and it makes the story line inorganic to me. Also, anyone who isn't a Christian or who is against the protagonist characters is portrayed in a fairly 2 dimensional and stereotypical way. I don't know any college professor that would make students sign paper saying God is dead the first day of class as a way to no have to have that conversation. Usually efforts undermine belief in God or in Christianity or any other organized religion is typically a little more subversive and mixed in its presentation.",1462579200,,821,4.591836734693878

6415504,1,B00KD5HFJG,"I should preface this by saying i only watched about 40 minutes of this.

Initial impression:
Some movie exec saw a viperfangx vlog and decided it needed to be 2 hours long.

A more fair review:
I tried to give this a watch despite my initial distaste. But with the twisting of facts and false binary presented was just too much. I need to get this off my chest, the big bang was not the creation of matter, it was the rapid expansion of matter from a dense state-- that info is freely available on Wikipedia. And I'm shocked that our college student protag didn't check that out first.

I'm not saying the professor wasn't in the wrong. In fact, I find the idea of a philosophy professor using his power over good students's GPA to stand on his soapbox and feel superior to people 20 and 30 years his junior to be reprehensible. It doesn't shock me that Ayn Rand, Dawkins, and Freud have found a place on his ""atheist"" list. But the misinformation used in the movie is just as bad.

Another thing that really bothered me was the binary presented of atheists and theists. Many theists are scientists, philosophers, respected people of all professions. Presenting scientific theory as just the realm of atheists is creating a false binary.

Also the depiction of hijabis is... Bad. Well, OK. I have never seen a head scarf look like what they put on that poor actress's head. No one wears anything like that. And if she's so concerned with what her dad says about covering, then why is she wearing short sleeved shirts and form fitting clothing? I think costume design just threw a scarf on her head and didn't bother doing any kind of research. And her whole conflict was stereotypical as well. A muslimah who has issues with an overbearing dad? Wow. Groundbreaking. Original.

Finally: all this kid had to do was go talk to the Dean.",1462147200,11,1834,4.5592705167173255

6415538,1,B00KD5HFJG,"At the end of the movie, the message is thus: If you're not a Christian and you're successful, you've been tricked by Satan with... a decent standard of living, I guess? If you are a Christian and you get cancer, that just means God has an extra special plan for you.

I'm so atheist I'm almost antitheist. But this movie isn't about Christianity, because they pervert even the most cursory details. They could've setup an argument between the college professor, who you already know is the villain, because he has one of them there edumacation dealieos, and the gentle Christian evangelist, in any of a million ways. But instead they turn the professor, again, the person teaching your kids, into a poisonous viper trying to lead your children to hell (Education and College is BAD). But the professor isn't just making an argument in a philosophy class, like a philosophy professor is supposed to, he makes a dictatorial demand that his students recant their religious belief in the name of liberalism-I mean, philosophy. In the real world, he would not pass Go, he would not collect $200, he would show up on Youtube and he would go directly to FIRED.

The sad part is the movie actually could've been good. The acting was well in excess of what I expected, and they manage to inject a great amount of passion and discussion into the debates, in spite of the points of the argument having been done to death.

But again, this movie isn't about Christianity. Its about ""traditional"" Christian, i.e. hyper conservative values, namely ""America is a Christian nation, and if you disagree, you're persecuting Republica- I mean Christians."" This can't be made more blatant by the fact that another villains only source of joy is writing articles about that awful reality TV show about a small business family of duck call producers, one of whom has an in movie cameo. But you can't make a movie about the values of a white heterosexual Christian male being attacked, so they have to wrap it in laughable and transparently bad arguing about the existence of God and force pointless drama on the protagonist so he feels persecuted. His girlfriend dumps him despite them having no chemistry or points of agreement. They double down on the persecution by also making the professor constantly mock his girlfriend, and I can't help wondering why they're together either. Everywhere are straw men, and theres no room for more than two camps: you're either a passionate Christian, or you hate Christians and Christianity, but that's always just a mask for your deep seated hatred of God. I know they can make these movies without making their characters into caricatures, because they've done it before.

Even Niezsetche, the guy who actually said God is Dead, didn't mean the Christian God, father of Jesus and leader of Abraham and Moses is no more, he was talking about morality and moral philosophy is no longer entirely defined by religion. But its easier to make a sound bite into an attack and use it as an excuse to act persecuted and victimized than it is to actually try to write a story that makes people think.",1461283200,,3111,4.798507462686567

6415543,1,B00KD5HFJG,"This honestly has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. All of the characters, every single one of them, are nothing but extremely stereotypical caricatures that you would expect to see in a Christian propaganda film. The dialogue not only sounds horrendously forced, but the debates between the Christian student and the atheist professor sound like something you'd read on a religion debate on Facebook. I could and have destroyed those same arguments that the Christian made countless times. Only an idiot would think those were good, original, or irrefutable arguments.

Hell, the movie even ends with an example of the Christian myth of a ""death bed conversion"" of a lifelong atheist.

Not only is god dead, but so are the brains of those who think this was actually a good and informative film. Anyone who gives this more than 2 stars needs to put the Bible down and go seek counseling.",1461110400,2,900,4.8

6415547,1,B00KD5HFJG,"This film starts off well and some of the points it makes are important.... The main character fights not for his right to be heard but for the eternal destiny of all his classmates putting his own education and future carrier at risk. However as the plot goes on I can't think of a single character that isn't over played and over acted.
There is no belief in healing for any of the characters that are dying. The high point is portrayed as a big pop concert (and News boys acting is so bad and contrived it borders on funny... only it's not funny because this is a subject that really is about life and death and peoples eternal destinies!)
This film has some good ideas, like portraying the way God weaves lives together in beautiful ways BUT when the rubber hits the road these great ideas look like road kill. I wanted to like this film but it left me feeling sad for how much we (the church) have missed it when it comes to giving people the real heart of God though the medium of film drama.
One of the lowest points was when the main character, in his fight to prove God is indeed 'not dead', plays on the pain and weakness that motivates his professors atheist views... In winning at making the point 'God's not dead' this film looses at portraying the loving heart of the Father. Instead it feels like a rather childish poke back at the secular world for all the times Christian events have been shut down on campus', playing with deep issues but with no real depth.
I would love to see campus won for Christ! (In fact I'm part of a ministry that is gearing up to go into high schools).
My only hope is that the Holy Spirit uses this film to speak to peoples hearts despite all the bits that made me walk away with a bad taste in my mouth. God is so good at doing that! ~ If you watch this film I bless you to receive something beautiful from God! but as you can see from my one star I wouldn't recommend it. I hope one day someone makes a poignant & real film on this very subject.",1461024000,3,1992,4.217277486910994

6415571,2,B00KD5HFJG,"In the course of evaluating a piece of Christian media, I strive to be fair.  Anytime I see some non-Christian reviewer poorly disguise his Its a Christian film, so obviously it sucks review, I want to bury my head in a bag.  On the other hand, whenever I read Christians praising Christian media just because its Christian, I want to tell them to think critically about what they are praising.  A Christian movie needs to evaluated on two levels: as a Christian message, and as a piece of entertainment.

When this movie came out in 2014, I avoided it.  It struck me as a gimmick.  In essence, a kid is forced to write God is dead in his philosophy class lest he get a failing grade.  With a setup I found hard to believe, I thought this movie would be cartoony at best and preachy at worst.  Plus, the Newsboys cover of Daniel Bashtas song Like a Lion had taken off like a rocket powered by the sun, so I figured this movie was trying to cash in on the songs success.

As I saida gimmick.

But two years later, the sequel comes out, and my interest in the Gods Not Dead films comes back.  The negative reviews of the original film seemed overly harsh, and the sequel (now playing) is getting its own wheelbarrow full of them.  Curiosity piqued, I sat down and watched Gods Not Dead to answer a nagging question:

Is it really that bad?

My opinion: Its not.

Bear in mind, I was cynical going into this film. Christian media does little for me.  Plus, as a fantasy reader and writer, movies like ""God's Not Dead"" don't appeal to meespecially when they strike as gimmicks.

However, I was pleasantly surprised that I sat and watched it in one sitting. It did not feel as gimmicky as other films have. In fact, I was gladdened by all the good things that leapt to the fore of my mind.

(1) I cared about the people.  Rejection, loss and suffering run through their lives, and no one glibly says, It will be all right, praise the Lord.  The camera looks on at them as they hit their lowest points, and it looks on without blinking or shying away.  For many people, their stuff is downright tragic, and not all their stories have the miraculous ending we might hope for.

Also, only a couple times do the reactions seem silly: One Christian character breaks up with her boyfriend and walks off with hardly any emotion, while another character reacts to tragic news with a B-rate horror movie scream.

As far as structure goes, the movie weaves everybodys stories almost perfectly.  You see them long enough to care, and you see then infrequently enough so that you're at least somewhat curious about what will happen nextbut not so infrequently that you forget they're there.

(2) The characters have some realism.  As a student, I have seen and interacted with people like Professor Radisson, Josh Wheatons girlfriend, the psychology department, and Amy Ryanhardcore atheists, outspoken liberals, and Christians who don't live out their faith.  So when I watched this film, it imitated life much more than I expectedthe things they say, the beliefs they hold and the axes they grind.  (I cant say that Ive ever seen anyone's car sport an I LOVE EVOLUTION bumper sticker, though.)

Also, I was hooked when I saw Aisha, a student still living with her conservative Muslim parents, pull the niqab off her head after she was out of her fathers eyeline.  Her story gripped me the most and felt the most realistic.

(3) The debate about the existence of God engaged me. If it were poorly written, I would have stopped the film right then and there.  But it was written well enough for me to engage with it and feel the tension in the room.  Both Josh and Professor Radisson present heartfelt and (usually) thoughtful arguments.

On the other hand, many of the complaints Christians and non-Christians have are more than justified.  The characters have at least a little depth and realism, and yet

(1) Most are cookie-cutter stereotypes.  Josh Wheaton is a Christian kid with no apparent faults (and we have to be reminded over and over again that he's a huge Newsboys fan).  His blonde girlfriend is a shallow, nominal Christian.  Professor Radisson is an arrogant liberal atheist who treats his girlfriend like dirt.  Martin Yip is portrayed as an unintelligent foreigner (he calls the main character ""Mr. Josh.""  Really?), and his broken English was scripted so poorly that I couldn't stand to listen to him.  Amy Ryan is a hardcore liberal blogger and a joke of a reporter:  A lot of reporters would squirm at every word she says in the trash-talking she calls ""interviews.""

(2) A lot of dialogue is stilted.  It tells you what you're supposed to know, but it doesnt make you feel anything.  For one, the interviews Amy Ryan has with Duck Dynasty stars and the Newsboys feel totally contrivedas if the writers set up those scenes just to give these stars a chance to preach the Gospel.  For another, its evident these university students say what the writers want them to say, and so they talk in a way that no college student would ever talk:

In his book The God Delusion, Richard Dawkinss question only make sense in terms of a God whos been created.

Your decision to prove God is not dead has changed everything and Ive decided to follow Jesus.

This is something thats important to me, but since its not important to you, you made it a make-it-or-break-it thing for us.

Seriously?  Whos talking in this filmthe characters, or the writers trying to sound like characters?

(3) All this would be tolerable if Radisson were a halfway decent professor.  Hes not.  His philosophy class might as well be called Atheism 101.  He does not weave the debate about Gods existence into a particular lesson.  He instead goes out of his way in order to drive home the idea that God is dead.  Ive heard stories about professors who spend their class time promoting liberal and secular ideology instead of the actual subject material.  But to go so far as to hinge students grades on their saying God is deadthis is unrealistic and far more unlikely to happen than any of the other, more credible scenarios that students are bound to face (such as a low grade on an essay the professor disagrees with).  And it's even more implausible since Radisson clearly has an axe to grind instead of pushing his students to think critically about both sides of the argumentwhich even a halfway decent professor would do, might I add.  (If he were a halfway decent professor, actually challenging his students with strong, logical arguments, this would ratchet up the tension in this filmwhich would only make it better.)

Also, Radisson is not even slightly respectable.  The writers crafted him to be a buffoon.  He engages some of Joshs arguments but brushes them all off as superstition, nonsense and lies.  But thats not the worst of it.  One day he chases Josh down the hall and, in a fit of anger that could get him fired in the real world, grabs him by the shoulder and tells him, I will not let some pre-law sophomore humiliate me in front of my students.

Some might say the writers failed to make him respectable.  But that's not true.  They didn't even try.

(4) On top of the story and structural flaws, the film suffers from some poor editing.  First, the cinematography is decent, and the foley and the room tones are not too bad, but quite a few audio clips are cut off too early, and so it sounds as if there are gaps in the audio. Second, a character gets hit by a car and goes airborne, andfor reasons completely beyond methe editor actually slowed it down like an action sequence, so you can stare into the poor characters agape face as he defies gravity.

As bad as that is...

(5) Willie Robertsons challenge was the worst.  The climax of the movie is a Newsboys concertand, to be expected, they end the film by playing Like a Lion.  That, too, is a disappointment.  ""Like a Lion"" is among the greatest Christian songs I've ever heard, but here it sounds dull and boring.  But just before the Newsboys launch into the song, Willie Robertson appears in a video message at the concert, and tells all 10,000 people in the crowd to send the words Gods not dead to every contact they have on their cellphones.

Seriously: He tells them to send a mass text message to everyone they know, saying ""God's not dead.""

Really?  Is that wise?  Consider 1 Peter 3:1516:

Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope you have.  But do this with gentleness and respect.

Willie Robertsons challenge strikes me as neither gentle nor respectful.  As a Christian, I'd be put off if I saw that on my phone.  Id think someone's trying to rally the troops or act like a fanboy-slash-troll.  Some Christians might be encouraged by it, while non-Christians would interpret that as fighting words or clichd propaganda.  Im not saying it will always come across that wayjust that there are better ways to tell people that God is surely alive, living on the inside and roaring like a lion.  You can be bold without getting into people's faces.

""God's Not Dead"" will still appeal to a lot of people, especially now that the sequel is out.  The series will attract those who are just getting started in the faith.  It may inspire some who are kicking the tires on God and the Bible.  Even movies like this can plant a seed in people's minds about Christianity, motivating and inspiring them to look at the facts for themselves.  And if some of the reviews are any gauge, it has done just that.

As for me:  Gods Not Dead neither motivated nor inspired me.  It felt like a call to arms.  Well-woven storylines and meaningful debate were bogged down by preachy and ham-fisted dialogue, mediocre writing, poor characters, and a challenge that strikes me as obnoxious and unwelcome.

Christian cinemas holy grail is to produce media that teaches Biblical truth and tells a good storyall the while winning audiences across the faith spectrum.  If Gods Not Dead is any gauge, then Christian cinema has got to do better.  Much better.

6415575,1,B00KD5HFJG,"Religious Propaganda are two words that come to mind when this movie is mentioned. Nothing is wrong overall in God seeing people through their struggles. The movie definitely showcases this and maybe could be said to parallel the struggles of the Josh character with what Jesus went through. I can see that but to make almost every person who does not believe (or does not want to believe) characters that I wish would get run over, beaten up, or just punched in the face makes it hard for me to want them to come out on top of things in the end. Not every nonbeliever is a jerk in the real world. Who wants to root for a jerk anyway? A guy dumps his girlfriend because she has cancer? WTF? And he is a jerk to his mom who has dementia when he goes to visit her and seems to have no remorse for his actions to other people? So, he is beyond salvation then? If God is Not Dead then shouldn't God be helping him out? That contradicts the movie's message then doesn't it? I'm sorry but any mildly decent person in this world would at least have some sort of sympathy for somebody with these health issues; especially if they are FAMILY! I have personal issues with this kind of character because it relates to a family member who recently survived her battle with cancer and to see something like that showcased in this movie just really rubs me the wrong way. Why should I be invested in such a jerk? He's the type of guy from a horror movie that I want to be eaten/crushed/stomped/chomped/cut in half/etc.within the first few seconds of his time on screen.

The parts where the professor tells students not to believe in God in school should not and would not fly in the real world in the United States. It's just as bad as the opposite end of the spectrum where people have tried to force intelligent design into a biology class at a public school. If you want to teach students about the Bible, that's great! Just include all the other religions with it in a neat package along the lines of World Religions Studies or some similar class as an elective and not say it is the truth and evolution is wrong. Again, opposite ends but the point is the same: this is a completely exaggerated view of the academic system in this country. There's fantasy, scifi. and general fiction and then there is this religious propaganda junk that defies logic completely.

Regarding this professor, he comes around and finally tries to reconcile with his girlfriend after being a jerk for so long only to be killed in a car accident. What kind of message does that send? That God doesn't forgive you even when you repent or that you need to die to repent? Doesn't that go against the teachings of the Bible? Yes, I am aware he becomes a Christian as he dies but why did he have to die to repent when he was on the road to repentance after reading his mother's letter and going to see his girlfriend? To me that was unnecessary drama and a waste of a character redeeming himself. It tells me that the only way to be forgiven is to die! Jesus already did that for us. That is not a message I would endorse. You want to repent and come back to Christianity? That's great! Here's a list possible ways to die! Choose one and you will be saved!

Let me be clear on this; this is not me mocking Christianity, this is me being angry at the message implied here and fleshing it out to what it really means to me. If God wants us all to die to become Christian than that seems to imply committing suicide which is completely wrong! This part of the movie is the worst and goes against everything I believe in!

Ok, now that I got that out and I can cool down a bit, I get what the movie is trying to get across: in one form or another to keep your faith in God because he is there and he will aid you through your endeavors, but the delivery of the message is too distorted and nonsensical. If you truly liked it and believe in its message then I am glad it worked for you but for me it was just an ugly way to try and spread the word of God to people. Personally, if you want something to better represent the word of God; I suggest reading the Bible. I got more out of the Bible than this movie.",1459728000,8,4169,4.273417721518987

6415577,1,B00KD5HFJG,"As a Jew (living in the U.S.) I found this movie pretty damn disturbing. Overall, ""God's Not Dead"" is uncomfortably similar to ""Birth of a Nation,"" in too many ways: the way both films portray the majority culture as small, oppressed rebels and the minorities as powerful villains; the evil black caricatures in ""Birth of a Nation"" are played by whites in blackface, the evil atheists in ""God's Not Dead"" are played by evangelical Christians; and of course, the fact that this movie has a massive following of bigots who truly believe the world is as it's presented here, just as with ""Birth of a Nation"" when it came out.

The way the ""non believers"" in this movie so easily see the ""errors"" of their ways by the end is both hilarious and disturbing as well, because when you're from a (real) religious minority in this country, you learn from a very young age that you're going to spend the rest of your life having to watch out for Christians who see themselves as Josh, and you as Professor Raddison/Martin/etc. This movie brought back memories of a Christian who stalked and harassed me in high school, trying to ""save"" my soul from being the wrong religion. How about more movies teaching people to respect other's beliefs, not encourage the harassment that minorities put up with regularly from Christians trying to ""save"" them.

This movie could also be an interesting sociological study for how different minority groups become acceptable targets as time changes. What if ""God's Not Dead"" had a Jewish character who was portrayed in the same manner as the atheists or Muslims? Can you imagine that? I can: the situation with the Muslim girl is parallel to a plot twist used in a few works back when antisemitism was acceptable; a pretty young Jewess secretly wants to be a good Christian, but her evil Jewish father won't let her (Shakespeare's ""The Merchant of Venice,"" and ""The Jewish Maid"" by Hans Christian Andersen). The atheists are portrayed as having no morals and hating Christianity, exactly how Jews were typically portrayed in Christian literature for centuries. Naturally most evangelical Christians aren't quite ""brave"" enough to show the ""errors"" of Judaism in a movie in this century, but they'll gladly do it with Muslims and Atheists, who, unlike us Jews, are still acceptable targets. There is a reason Jews have a history of siding with other minority groups. While you ""believers"" are making daily efforts to remember how Jesus suffered, we're remembering everything you did and do to us in Jesus's name.

The only positive thing about this film is that it's hypocrisy, disturbing content, and poor quality are hilarious. But even that is hampered by the knowledge that so many people take this film and it's ""message"" seriously.

If anyone is a fan of Tommy Wiseau's ""The Room,"" you might give ""God's Not Dead"" a go for some funny parallels between the two movies, particularly their use of cancer as ""drama.""

To those who think the world actually works as it does in this movie, step outside your safe zone and listen to what real Atheists, Muslims, Jews, etc. have to say about their own beliefs. You may be surprised to find that we don't want to ""oppress"" you, we just want you to leave us alone.",1459641600,52,3232,4.805755395683454

Having said that, it seemed clear this film is directed at rather unsuspecting Christian young people - students: college and I suppose, high school. They are spiritually at high risk. The numbers of those who forsake the Lord in college if not in secular high school are staggering. As such, it is a bit of a fairy tale - like a Renoir - not highly focused on detail but on message - a random example that in reality takes many different forms.

Encouraging people to lose their faith in Christ is the worst kind of persecution in the end. Let us at least have the spiritual savvy to agree on this.

My own college experiences included being sexually assaulted without ANY provocation by a married professor twice my age, being singled out and given lowered marks by a philosophy prof that students called the Antichrist (shared the Gospel with him as I withdrew- passing from the course, this later bore fruit), leading a goofed up history professor to Christ, standing for the truth in discussions when it was appropriate (as led).

As a teacher, former students tell me of the depraved realities they face on campus ... in the classroom and in the dorms.

The movie is simply amazing, with many cameos and things of that nature that hook you to this movie. It's a classic story of good and evil, with all the little entrails of a drama. But I really want to speak to those who have criticised this movie. Here it goes: if you aren't a Christian or you don't believe in God, why in the WORLD would you too and watch this movie? Of course they will beat the aethiest professor, it would terrible if they lost!

Every non-Christian presented is essentially evil (Kevin Sorbo's character even goes so far as to commit acts that would immediately cost him his job as a college professor). We're not talking interesting evil either. Dean Cain's character behaves like a sociopath with unrealistic motivations. The aforementioned Sorbo is nothing more than a petulant child throwing around big words and references to his superior intelligence after his feelings are hurt by a kid with a differing opinion (never mind the fact that his behavior would never fly at an institution of higher learning). Some might be willing to ignore all of this in favor of the message, but even that isn't too compelling given the fact that it won't change the minds of atheists and it presents no new arguments for the believers.

6415611,1,B00KD5HFJG,"Everyone and his brother was talking about this movie, my mother and sister all thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread. I say what a huge missed opportunity, instead of providing a compelling emotional tale that might actually win over non Christians, you are presented with a shallow, one sided tale that really is cheezy and shallow in many ways.  The characters all seem one dimintional and lack any real depth to them and the non christians in the movie are portrayed as unrealistically overly mean and cruel. I really don't understand how todays christians are so blind as to not see the major issues with the movie.  First of all the whole ""debate"" really relies on shallow ""evidence' to prove God is real.  the ""bad guy"" the professer is shown as a complete jerk, and does not have any deeper qualities you may see in other movies/shows with a sort of anti-hero he just comes off as a prick.  and if he hates God so much why in the hell was he with a christian woman????

and the whole ending where he [spoilers]....

finally turns around and then gets HIT by the car and gets killed was complete cheap emotional bull in my opinion. I mean really? really? you had one moment in the whole bloody movie to provide a powerful moment when a jerk turns his life around and instead of comdimming God he becomes a witness for him, and instead he ""confesses to god"" at the last moment before he dies by being  hit by a car?

and seriously killing off the guy your trying to convince through the whole movie that Gods not dead?
almost as bad as killing off Hugh Laurie's character halfway through the movie of Mr Pip...

but in this instance i really don't care much about him to beigin with.

all of the non christians are portrayed as monsters , and with the muslim sterotypes as bad as they are now.do you think its even worse that this movie has one where an arab or whatever husband beats his wife because she is secretly a christian?

i mean COME On.

this is the whole reason what is wrong with modern christians today, they trade real depth, real change, real impact, with shallow moments that really don't do a hill of beans.

and the multistory aspect only further weakens the movie and makes things overly confusing.  It should have just focused on ONE group of people not jump back and forth

I give this one star simply because everyone thinks this is so great and i think it could be much better

i saw it once and i don't care to see it again.

huge missed opperunity and next time the duck dynasty people decide to spearhead a movie how about hire someone who can actually come up with something thats acutally powerful

this movie was made for people who are already strong christians.....NOT for people who are not sure about God, it presents a weak argument at best and all of the movies characters are one sided and completely forgettable.

but this is the kind of bull that todays christians completely eat up.",1458172800,2,2943,4.487804878048781

two biggest things that i hated and i didn't even finish the movie because was saying if you don't have religion you have no reason to be moral? its called a conscience... most people have one and the second thing that made me turn it off i meann come onnnn the man got hit by a car and is dying and you are still shoving religion down his throat? yeesh.",1458172800,,562,4.008928571428571

6415619,5,B00KD5HFJG,"It was a solid movie. I hate to admit but Catholic movies directed to the youth tend to be cheesy but this one wasn't as cheesy. Good production. The acting could have been a bit better but overall I'm glad to see Catholic youth movies moving toward a good direction in terms of production.
Content wise. I thought it was interesting. They definitely surprised me with the arguments. The writers included many good recent arguments that pro-atheist use. The writers also included the classic argument that atheist use ""if God exists then why is there suffering?"" which was good to include in my opinion. Overall, this was a drama movie with good content. There's only so much you can include in a movie so I can see how pro-atheist still aren't convinced. This is just a movie with good biblical teachings. But it isn't the whole church. I encourage any pro-atheists that aren't satisfied with this movie to make an appointment with a priest and ask him the tough questions you seek answers too. I'm sure any priests wouldn't mind sitting down with a youngster who has questions.
Overall, it was a good movie and any youngster who already has his/her faith planted and strong will enjoy it. Also, it's a great movie for highschoolers who are making the transition to college that want to know how to keep their faith strong while in college.",1457827200,,1341,4.7106382978723405

6415652,3,B00KD5HFJG,"I thought the movie was pretty good.  Yes, it does portray the characters in an unrealistic light but that was not the intent of the film.  The film is designed to show that Christians, in this day and age, should stand by their faith in God and that by doing so, others may come to a knowledge of Jesus as Savior.

I do not believe all non-Christians are ""evil"" - God has given all of us the will to choose to follow Him or not - that is portrayed in the film.  This movie shows that there are both religious and scientific reasons for belief - science has, in many cases, upheld the scriptures.

We as a nation do have a ""God problem"" in that we have forgotten Him and His teachings.  Our ""laws"" and the ACLU have done all they can to erase God from our culture.  This move goes a long way in standing by faith to help Christians understand their Christian responsibility to stand firm in their beliefs and faith.  Our nation was founded on pure Christian principles that we have forgotten - it is time we came back to God both as individuals and a nation.  We are a CHRISTIAN nation and every part of our heritage supports that.  This movie shows what can happen when ONE Christian holds true to the Bible and his faith in God.

Although it t tried to tie all the characters together, it was like a patchwork quilt of individual stories. It made it seem less like reality. It also moved slowly and did a lot of jumping around in the attempt to get to all the little sub stories. The main focus of the freshman vs the professor was extremely well done. Perhaps with only a couple of sub stories that could have been more easily tied into it, it would have been a stronger movie. The closing scenes were great at the concert, esp with the twinkling cell phones. Despite my three star rating and remarks, it is still a movie worth seeing.",1456012800,2,724,4.253623188405797

So many Christ followers are afraid to stand up for what is right because they are afraid of offending other people but shouldn't we be afraid to offend God?!

6415690,1,B00KD5HFJG,"I watched this movie several months ago on TV, out of curiosity. I cannot add anything more the what the detractors have to say, other than to say that this movie is a masterpiece of projection:  The attribution of denied aspects of the self to others. The central conflict, in which the christian student Joshua Wheaton (Shane Harper) is victimized by his atheist professor Radisson (Kevin Sorbo) is in fact a reversal of what happens in real life. A friend who lived in Tennessee recounted to me stories of how his high school teachers would demand statements of belief in christianity from students with threats of being sent to the principal's office; one Jewish female student was particularly harassed. And there are christian colleges which demand such a statement for acceptance; one college even requires an oath that the student does not have any homosexual tendencies. I am sure that someone like the star Shane Harper would at best say: ""Those aren't real christians."" My experience is that if you ask three christians what a real christian is, you will get four different different answers, each claiming to be THE truth.
Even as a filthy, despicable non-believer, I don't think that a christian should have to deny or hide who he or she is. The trouble is that I have yet to see the kind of oppression of which many christians complain. One of my jobs is at a public institution in which the administrative assistants openly make statements about christianity and certainly are not reprimanded. Anyway., this film should appeal to those who feel that we are in a so-called cultural war.

6415715,2,B00KD5HFJG,"First off, let's get one thing out of the way. This movie is purely Christian propaganda. If that's what you're looking for, then this is probably the movie for you. If not, you'd be wise to beware.

When I first saw this movie, I did so because of the premise. I enjoy watching debates between atheists and theists, and the movie's description promised to deliver on that premise. It failed, for the most part. The debates were there, to be sure. However, they made up only a very small portion of the movie, and they were incredibly bad. The arguments on both sides were terrible. Josh's arguments were clearly written by a Christian for Christians, not meant to prove anything, but to reinforce the existing beliefs of Christian viewers. The Professor's arguments were arguments I don't believe any actual atheist would make. The only times I've ever seen arguments like that were made by theists setting up a strawman to take down. The professor was clearly written as a Christian's idea of what an atheist is like, not what an atheist is actually like.

And that's one of my big problems with the movie. It covers entirely too many plot threads that are completely inconsequential to the premise, and most of them focus on atheists. And their portrayal of atheists is atrocious. They're all bitter, cruel, immoral, uncaring, or all of the above. They exist to either paint nonbelievers as terrible people, or to be converted by the end. One of them isn't even an atheist at all, they're just mad at God. And I'm not even going to get started on the Islamic family. That was just really bad...

In addition to these problems, the movie was poorly written and directed, very few of the actors came across as anything other than caricatures, and the score was mediocre at best. And let's not forget the incredibly annoying song that refuses to leave my head, ""God's Not Dead"" by The Newsboys who make a guest appearance. The finale of the movie feels like equal parts sermon and Newsboys advertisement.

I was suckered in by the movie's premise, but it quickly became apparent what this really was. It's a sermon. It's propaganda. And rather than bothering to teach a good moral message, it mostly exploits the pervading persecution complex among American Christians today. If that's what you're into, enjoy. In fact, there's an upcoming sequel releasing on April 1st, 2016. From the trailer, it seems to have dropped all pretenses and is quite upfront with what it is. I can only think that's for the better as now people like me may not be fooled into watching it due to false promises.",1452902400,5,2590,4.736141906873614

6415719,3,B00KD5HFJG,"I offer this input not because I have seen the movie, which I have NOT, nor because I wish to either laud or impugn the movie, which I do not, but because of the categorical POSITIVE defense of university academics seen in some of the Reviews.  As such, I give the movie a neutral grade simply because I must assign something.  As for my comment, I offer an account of a broadcast as I recollect hearing it, hopefully correctly. Thus, the following is offered for consideration:

During the 11 January 2016 broadcast of the Rick Roberts program on WBAP, Dallas, TX, a portion of which I listened to via an Internet feed, he talked about the challenge his daughter recently faced in her university classroom: the professor demanded that the students author papers proving that Eubonics, an African American Vernacular English, is a bona-fide Language.  She interviewed an accomplished African American who soundly proved the opposite, which material she presented in her A level paper, which grade the professor grudgingly accorded.  Thus, to say, as some of the Reviewers state, that a professor such as is portrayed in this movie could not possibly exist in the real world, or words to that effect, appears to be overly generous toward academics.  Bias does exist in schools and universities throughout the world, even in America, and most certainly so at the lower grade levels, where the students are very impressionable and weak when it comes to forcefully confronting their teacher, as this young lady successfully accomplished.",1452470400,,1533,5.015748031496063

2)The professor in this movie isn't professional. He seems to want to embarass the student and doesn't actually welcome the challenge. I've had many atheist professors who would never conduct themselves in such a way.  Additionally, why does he need to be angry at God for this storyline to work? This is unnecessary and only weakens the plot.
3)At one point, the main character assumes that none of his class mates are Christians. Wow really?

6415736,4,B00KD5HFJG,"I purposefully did not include a lot of movie detail in my review because I hate to spoil a movie for others.  So if you are looking for specifics about the movie premise, you will probably want to read a different review.  That is just my personal preference as I think part of enjoying a movie is not knowing every detail about it.

As a Christian, I thought this was a good inspiring movie about the struggles of right and wrong and of faith in God.  The plot was a bit forced and felt inauthentic and the script could have been written better so that the movie would feel more realistic.  To me the overall movie was B rate at best. There are also parts of the movie that seem to be a harsh criticism of other faiths which I do not agree with.

Some spoilers below...

The most poignant part of the movie was when the mother with Alzheimer's made a lucid explanation to her son.  It was very moving.  Some parts such as when the Pastor had to wait days for a rental car could have been written in a more believable approach.  While you get the point that it was God's hands working to put him where he needed to be, you have to sort of look past the fact that the rental car companies are open 24/7 and him having to wait for days for a car is, well just ridiculous.  There are a few other things that felt similar in the script that I had to overlook because the movie itself and the point it makes is really good.  Had they written the movie better, I would have certainly given it 5 stars.  I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone so I won't talk more about the plot but I would certainly recommend watching the movie for some spiritual inspiration.

So, I think I know something about university life and about bearing a Christian testimony while studying and interacting in a secular university setting. I find the plot and story line in this film unrealistic and fanciful and the portrayal of university faculty inaccurate and insulting. A fairly widespread perception of university professors among right-wing evangelical Christians is that they will chew up and spit out tender little evangelical Christians and destroy their faith within the first semester on campus. After two masters degrees and a hard-earned doctorate, I simply have not met that type of professor. A faith that can be destroyed in a semester isn't much of a faith. The best advice I can give Christian students is this: On day one find a good, strong, campus student ministry and align yourself with it. Pray and study the Word with like-minded students and faculty. Nourish your faith, witness by the integrity and morality of your life. And find a good church in the city where you are and join it and participate.",1451260800,3,1182,5.066666666666666

One of the major protagonist's of the film goes as far to suggest that those who don't believe in a god are without morality. This is reinforced by some stereotypical behavior of characters in the movie. For example a muslim father beats and casts out his young daughter after she declares Jesus as her savior. This scene goes out of it's way to portray other religions or thought disciplines other than Christianity in a negative light, while those who are strong in their faith are infallible.  Creating a film that takes on the controversial topic of faith and religion this way does no favors to christianity. It reaffirms those who already have a strong belief in the religion and shuns those away who are on the fence or don't agree with it.

6415754,1,B00KD5HFJG,"I apologize that I, too, could not stomach more than a half hour of this low-production propaganda. Others have described in detail the many problems with this movie-length commercial, so I'll spare you. But I have to say it's too bad the writers/ producers/ actors chose not to wrangle with the most difficult and most essential questions a thinking person must faceincluding Christians facing a time of doubtwhen dealing with whether or not to have, or continue to have, faith in a Judeo-Christian god.

It fails, most essentially, because the characters are ridiculous cartoons of Christians and nonbelievers. Take the professor, for example. No professoras in, this would never happen on the campus of any respected college campuswould say the words ""there is no god."" First, he'd be fired by the end of the day. Second, philosophy, for those who are unschooled in this pursuit, is particulalry concerned with the defining of terms. Ask an atheist on a street corner if he believes in God and they might cut right to the chase, answering no. But ask a philosophy teacher, and she will answer, ""Let's first define your terms. To which god, of the thousands that have been worshipped over the millennia and the thousands worships around the globe today, are you referring? And do you also mean to ascribe, in that identification, specific characteristics, such as 'loving' or 'all-powerful'?""

Thinking Christians are equally careful about terms and definitions. If an educated Christian living in the Middle East were asked by a Muslim if he believed in Allah, the Christian would no doubt hesitate to say yes, knowing that they first would need to define ""Allah"" and ""God"" and then see if the two terms shared enough identity to be considered, for the purposes of the question, functionally equivalent.

By aiming its message squarely at the hearts of the most unthinking Christians, this movie cynically adds to the to the view that Christians, as a group, are incapable of a thoughtful discourse. It excuses them from the grownup table and tells them to eat waffles and gummy bears with the kids, where can they be easily manipulated with stories of the completely open and innocent youth hunted by the Big Bad Professor bent on conversion. The problem is that neither of these two caricatures are fairytale figures exists in real life. And if they did, then neither would be open to new ideas, let alone a wholesale spiritual upheaval.

6415787,1,B00KD5HFJG,"This movie garnered a LOT of attention. It didn't seem to matter what kind of church you attend - ALL of them recommended this movie. So I waited. I waited until I saw it free on Prime video. Time wasn't wasted - I appreciate the opportunity to evaluate things I disagree with as well as ones I agree with. On a screenwriting level, I felt that the characters were flat and stereotypical. And along with that comes a loss of integrity of the message of the movie (that God is not dead). To me, Christianity is portrayed as cheesy in this movie. As a Christian, it leaves me with a ""here we go again"" feeling.

1. The relationship between Josh and his girlfriend: this drove me nuts. It was very hard to believe that this relationship lasted six years when one person was driving the bus (her) and this same person was eating the attention (salutatorian but I came here anyway, pay attention to me because it's our anniversary, you aren't going according to my plan for you...I'll stop...). Also her Christian testimony stopped at the fact that she was in a youth group in high school. Why portray her as a Christian? It gives Christian's a bad name. Cheesy.
2. Pastor Dave's character was SHAL-LOW! Oh my word. Pastors are supposed to be Spirit-filled, ""holding firm to the trustworthy word"" (Titus 1:9) I didn't see this portrayed. He turned to psychology, not Scripture, to encourage Mia. And when he does use Scripture, like with Ayesha, it's a self-focused misinterpretation of  Philippians 4:11-13. Why not Psalm 27:10 - ""For my father and other have forsaken me, but the Lord will take me in""? He came across as a complainer - not ""self-controlled"". And at the end with the dying professor, I had a hard time believing this was a self-profession of Christ and not a ""hurry up and say a sinners prayer like last rites so we can get you covered"" profession - and i believe in deathbed conversion!! Cheesy.
3. Radisson. Sigh. I admit to a pet-peeve: When a profession is claimed by a character: Please, DIRECTOR, do some homework on pronunciation!! ""Nietzsche"" is pronounced Nee-chee. The professor is supposed to be a PHILOSOPHY professor. Moving on...My main issue with the character of Prof Radisson is the hatefulness with which he was portrayed; it was over the top, to the point that he actually laid hands on a student???? And the ""I'm going to destroy your whole future"" attitude...really? Let's get more realistic by showing a dangerous subtlety of argumentation instead of bombastic arrogance that bulldozes students - because which really occurs more readily in classrooms? Are there exceptions, yes. But why choose the exceptions to be the example in the movie? The ""normal"" classroom argument is just as (if not more) dangerous when the professor is likeable, winsome, and personable. So the ""cheesy"" is on the screenwriting of the professor.

There were some things I liked. I liked the mom. I LOVED her ""sin is comfortable"" speech at the end. So true!! You tell him, sister! And I liked showing that pastors need vacations. While Pastor Dave's character was annoying to me in the extreme, it does not take away the TRUTH that pastors get tired because they are mortal creatures with an eternal job. It would have been wonderful to watch mentorship and encouragement from the visiting pastor to Pastor Dave. I do appreciate pastors need pastoring too.

6415803,2,B00KD5HFJG,"A preface, this is from the perspective of an ""Evangelical"" Christian, meaning I'm thoroughly conservative theologically.

First, from a purely cinematic perspective it's dismal. Aside from Dean Cain's mother in the film, the rest of lifeless acting feels like a B-rated flick--the protagonist's girlfriend being especially egregious since it sounds like she's just reading lines. The one-dimensional characters lack depth, and you can predict how they'll act from the moment the scene is set up. Atheists and agnostics? Self-centered, overtly ambitious and self-serving. Christians? Either whole-heartedly devoted (protagonist, African minister) or struggling (American pastor). Moreover the side plots, aside from failing to add to the main plot, portray such simplistic stereotypes that the movie feels like a fantasized world. It's the Tyler Perry of Christian flicks.

More troublingly is not its theology, but the heart of the movie--it's a movie that encourages the Christian bubble, and teaches that God-hating secular people are out to get the victimized believers of Christ. The whole timbre of the debate is that of trying to one-up the evil atheist professor, as opposed to lovingly engaging, especially in the latter sequences where the protagonist practically berates him. It's also shockingly cynical--while not spoiling the movie completely, it implies terrible things need to happen to non-believers in order for them convert. In the key moments of the movie, the non-believers are the ones that have to initiate to come to God, and that's sad; it teaches that Christians should have to keep non-believers at an arm's distance, throwing apologetic salvos across the bow in hopes one will score a direct hit, and that they'll come to church, instead of you bringing church to them. Jesus came to the sinners, the tax collectors and prostitutes, dining with them--and not with the attitude of engaging in an apologetic brawl. Instead, we only see a tinge of indignation that perpetuates a toxic ""us versus them"" ethos.

Moreover, the film is clearly intended for Christians and preaches to the choir. It uses jargon like ""unequally yoked,"" a reference to 2 Corinthians 6:14. While I agree with the passage and concept, non-Christian audiences will have no clue what that means. The Duck-Dynasty cameo assumes you know the character, and that he character goes to church (also because the camera contrivingly pans to a sign that says ""worship"")... but if you're Christian and agree with his stance, what's the point with the scene? But then on the flip side, it also crams in gospel verses seemingly to evangelize to the viewer. There's nothing wrong with sharing the gospel, but when it's blatantly not for the sake of the movie but for the audience, it practically breaks the fourth wall, making the lines feel hokey.

The only reason why I gave it two stars instead of one was because it was spiritually encouraging in certain scenes, in spite of the overwhelmingly disappointing execution of the movie. Themes like taking courage and standing up for what your believe faith even when other Christians don't, to follow God even if everything isn't going well (aforementioned mom) were powerful. Pity that's overshadowed by a painfully schlocky film that seems to think of atheists, not sin, as the greatest enemy.",1447891200,11,3330,5.24202626641651

To put it bluntly, it is another self-serving ""Christian"" film that gives lip service to an audience that believes itself to be persecuted and must fight back. Fight back what? Well.. the imaginary war on christianity. Which is also the least persecuted group of people in modern times. The entire premise of the fabricated situation is counter-productive to any progress or harmony most humans seek to contribute in their lives for their fellow neighbors.

I closely compare it to the rich pretending they have it hard and come up with examples of why their life is so hard and that they need to stand up for themselves because everyone wants their money.

6415833,1,B00KD5HFJG,"The premise of this movie intrigued me, largely because I went to a secular university, and one of the first rational arguments I learned in Philosophy was for the existence of God (or higher being). I had heard this was a good, inspiring movie - it wasn't.

This movie had nothing but the most basic arguments for the existence of God, which may have been expected as the character making them is a college freshmen. The arguments against God aren't strong either. In short, if you're looking for a good sense of apologetics, you will not get anything close in this movie (nor strong arguments for atheism, both sides arguments were pretty weak).
The characters are largely one dimensional, the Christians are largely saints, everyone else is evil. Dean Cain's character is maybe an exception- I think he was supposed to be someone who was born into a Christian family, who left the faith or stopped caring, so was  he supposed to be an amoral former Christian or an amoral non-Christian? Doesn't really matter, like more than a few of the characters and plotlines, he was largely unnecessary to the movie.

Which leads me to another reason this movie wasn't great- most of the side stories were utterly unnecessary this could have been a much better movie if they were cut out and more decent argument/debate were thrown in.
In short, if you believe all non - Christians are evil horrible people and all Christians are great, congrats, this movie will reinforce what you already believe. Otherwise, this movie will do nothing for you, though it may perhaps turn you against Christianity or Christians in general. If the only exposure to Christianity I ever had was this movie, I'd find them largely unrelatable, and annoying, with the exception of a few small moments.",1446940800,2,1770,4.8349834983498345

6415872,1,B00KD5HFJG,"Whoah, that was painful. I made myself watch the whole thing out of curiosity, and to be able to form a first-hand opinion (I get into a lot of debates with friends and family who are of the more religious persuasion). The characters are completely one-dimensional on both sides of the ""argument"" (the rhetoric on both sides is sophomoric at best). If you're one of the named characters, you're either a tender-hearted, loving but persecuted Christian, or one of a gallery of godless rogues including the uber-jerk professor (who turns out to secretly believe in god but deny him out of hate), evil Muslim father (because all Muslims must be either evil or secretly wanting to be Christian), heartless businessman, superficial/bitter/lonely left-wing blogger (but she turns out ok, she turns to god after finding out she has cancer -- because nothing says free will like desperately grasping for any shred of hope). The plot jerks around between schmaltzy melodrama and over-the-top mock debate procedural. I'm sympathetic to the college kid (despite his clumsy argumentation - hey, he's young), and as an atheist myself would happily take his defense in the name of freedom if I ever encountered such an evil college professor. Which would pretty much never happen because it is such a cardboard cutout of a caricature. Anyway, spoiler alert, the evil professor does accept Jesus Christ as his lord and savior as he lies dying after getting hit by a car, because again, a last-minute conversion by someone who is hurt and terrified is a totally convincing argument -- and apparently, to some people, a heart-warming ending. The character I feel the worst for is the poor Chinese kid who's just trying to figure things out and stumbles from his overbearing actual father to an overbearing fictional one.",1445731200,6,1803,5.013333333333334

This is just meant to reaffirm people's faith. I say, if you have faith, you shouldn't need a movie to help you keep it. Pay attention to your surroundings.

6415914,1,B00KD5HFJG,"I won't get into the demonstrably inaccurate statements made by the protagonist of the movie. It's a movie, so obviously it can't be expected to adhere to facts. I will instead address the tone of the movie.
The political agenda bias of this movie is atrocious. It gives an incredibly skewed portrayal of Christians as being a persecuted minority group in America. It also portrays every single atheist in the movie as evil, uncaring, and heartless. It portrays Muslims as extreme bigots, who choose doctrine over family. Yet, it portrays all the Christian characters of the movie as nothing less than loving and accepting. Even the Christian character that is based on an actor from a reality TV family was portrayed as loving and accepting of even the rude Atheist reporter. Quite the opposite of the reality of that TV star who has made countless homophobic remarks, racist comments, and violent statements towards those who have different beliefs.
If there was a mainstream Islam movie that made the exact same movie with a Muslim protagonist, and a Christian antagonist, I dare say it would be widely proclaimed to be a bigoted and hate-filled movie.
The overall production of this movie was decent. And they made very clever use of camera angles to give an uneasy feeling when it's a solo shot of one of the antagonists. The same clever techniques were used in the film score.
But overall, the horribly biased agenda of this movie took away from anything positive I could ever say about this movie.",1444003200,2,1504,4.856031128404669

Perhaps will cause viewers to open their minds (and hearts) to the preponderance of evidence that convincingly demonstrates life did not come into existence through some merely random, happy accident and then magically ""evolve,"" hopefully prompting them to discover the mountains of evidence that God IS real if they were simply open minded and intellectually honest.

The movie may not show how in depth believers can commit themselves to God and what to do to delve deeper into helping spread the Word but at least it shows in a black and white style those who believe and those who don't.  There are so many who have no care about God, believe there's no Hell.  Whether or not someone believes in God or Heaven or Hell does not change the fact that it all exists.  The ""world"" scoffs at such things, just as they did in Jesus' time.  Nothing has really changed.  We are still called to spread the Word and fight the evil that tries to kill the Message.  This movie shows many different angles of views of God and life and how the answer is always the same, to follow God on the path that he lays before us.",1443312000,3,876,4.105882352941176

6415954,1,B00KD5HFJG,"I can't believe I just watched this movie.  I am horrified that it got such positive reviews.  If I were a true Christian believer (which, of course, according to this movie, is the only good and pure true believer), I would be offended to be represented in such absurd stereotypes and to witness such bigoted depictions of all people not Christian.  I would be sickened to watch the way that other religions, other cultures, other positions were so caricatured devalued.  I would feel sad that this good Christians vs. evil everyone else, with arrogant nonbelievers only coming to their senses as they faced death, was the very best a Christian film maker could do.
Yet, there are clearly many positive reviews - I'm assuming they must be written by true Christian believers (because obviously it wasn't the stellar acting or the clever writing that got you).  So, I'm left to wonder if perhaps the evil professor wasn't somewhat right about the stupidity of the believer.  You'll just wave your arms toward heaven in your ecstatic praising of his name without the hinderance of any discernment of the implications of the message you're hearing, supporting, and insisting is the only way into the exclusive club.  I don't know about Jesus, or how powerful he was/is, or how present he remains.

6415955,2,B00KD5HFJG,"I really wanted to like this movie, because I appreciate the message it's trying to give. Unfortunately, rather than letting the message speak for itself the movie tries to squeeze in too many character arcs and then attempts to tie them all together. It seems like the producers felt the need to remind the audience every 10 minutes that this is ""a Christian movie."" The Robinson cameo added nothing to the movie, other than the name. There were too many stories to follow and too little time spent on the core story. Several of those stories were not just cliche but served no purpose other than short, feel good moments at the end. The producers should have spent more time with the main character and expanding upon the debate that's core to the story. This could have served to teach fellow believers how to discuss their faith with non-believers, but these moments were lost among all of the disjoint backstories of unnecessary characters.",1443225600,,945,4.803680981595092

Like they thought that saying a quick Bible verse is all you need to do to help a girl who has just been beaten and disowned by her family and kicked out on the street? Like saying a quick prayer is just going to make everything all instantly better for someone who is dying of cancer.  I really disliked the trivial way the movie dealt with many complicated life issues.  I think it portrayed people and situations and GOD inaccurately  for me it was a calloused and heartless movie.  It was like the Pastor who really didn't want to be bothered with these people  he and his heart was somewhere else.  I wasn't really satisfied with how they dealt with many of the issues in the movie.  In general I found it troubling.  It is most likely not realistic that a school would make everyone sign something that they believed God was dead, they didn't say that this was a specific event but listed many court cases of Religious persecution at many colleges and then generalized.  I think it would have been a better film if it would have portrayed one of the exact cases, exactly as it was rather than conjecture and generalize that this is how all of them are.  To me that was very inaccurate, and probably untrue.  It was like they were trying to make a point but why go out of your way to argue about things?  Did it really please God that he stayed and argued with this man or would it have been best to drop out and find a more peaceful way of dealing with the problem.  He could have avoided a confrontation.  Does confrontation and argument always have to be necessary? and besides arguing what did this student do to show the love of Christ to this man?  anything?  so, in many ways this was an unsatisfying film.",1442880000,7,1926,4.2908587257617725

At the end of the movie, you find out Jesus' dad let Jesus die. If I was about to be killed, and my dad did nothing to save me, I don't think I'd like my dad very much anymore. And Jesus' dad didn't just let Jesus die. He had Jesus die the slowest, most extremely painful and publicly humiliating way available at the time.

As so many others (including believers) have posted, this is nothing but extreme Christian propaganda fueled by a storyline written by someone who apparently has never actually been to college. The premise seemed interesting (student VS professor on existence of God) but wow--so full of nonsense. The premise from the very start is incredibly hard to swallow, as anyone who has taken a college level philosophy course should know (yes, even in a liberal school). The idea that a professor would make his students deny their belief in God is absurd to the extreme, and the movie doesn't get any better. The whole point of college isn't to make everyone think the same thing, it's to make people examine WHY they think what they do, whether that belief changes or evolves over time or becomes more entrenched.

And to the guy who said there was a professor who made people stomp on the name of ""Jesus"" written on a paper -- it's not even close to the same thing. They didn't have to stomp on the paper--it was a thought exercise in why someone might or might not actually follow through: you know, thinking, what college is supposed to make you do. ""What do you believe and why"" not ""you have to defy your beliefs to get credit in my class.""

I'm all for a healthy debate for the existence, need, and goodness of the Judeo-Christian god figure but that is not what is happening here in this two-hour long sob-fest of imagined persecution.  Christians, (not all of you, just the ones that feel bullied for some reason) nobody is coming for your bibles.  No one is going to cancel Christmas.  You are free to worship in anyway you see fit.  But we live in a secular society, not a theocracy.  That is the way the system was set up, so people would not be persecuted for following whatever path they so chose.  You are confusing the fact that christian dogma is now just one more personal philosophical code in an ever increasing global community and you are losing your grip on making the rest of us do things your way with actually being persecuted.  Perhaps you can see the irony?

What does this have to do with the movie?  Maybe nothing but see, I didn't have to spend a couple of millions dollars on an advertisement for God and the Newsboys by offering a fact-based, reasoned argument but really just changing the subject to complain for a bit about an entirely different subject.

Boring, one-dimensional characters (seriously, the 'bad-guys' might as well have been wearing Snidely Whiplash mustaches)
Straw-man arguments for days
Transparent evangelicalism

6416015,4,B00KD5HFJG,"Ok so will say that certain aspects of the film made me cringe. The Movie does strike back against society's growing anti Christian theme that has been growing in the mind of the youths of America mostly through TV. I believe that it painted a black and white picture which though I can understand why I can't agree with. I am Christian and do believe in god, but black and white isn't the world we live in. The muslim issue was a little over the top too. That being said a really good movie made me smile, and I think it will for most Christians. That being said if you are a Atheist looking to this film to provide a debate keep looking. And in a way that is how it should be because how can we have a debate on something that is a question of faith. I know that Atheists believe we worship a make believe Santa Claus and that not believing in something makes them stronger but does it. That is a question that each person has to answer for themselves. GOOD LUCK",1441497600,,964,4.188172043010753

6416017,5,B00KD5HFJG,"While I found the manner of each 'non-believer' in this movie to be simplistic.  I understand that his and/or her rudeness and mean-spirited ways were a composite made to represent the intolerance of many who are opposed the beliefs of Christians.  I know many non-believers who are very nice people and are not mean-spirited in any way.
That said, I feel the point of the movie was to convey to many people the power of true Christian beliefs and faith.  I thought that the strongest scenes of the movie were the ones with Shane Haper's character, Josh Wheaton, presenting his side of the debate that God does exist to the students in his philosophy class.
To try to present the pros and cons of this issue in just under two(2) hours is certainly not an easy thing to do.  However, I'm very glad I chose to watch this movie.",1441497600,,825,4.516778523489933
6416018,1,B00KD5HFJG,"Really, truly, dismally, catastrophically bad movie with little to nothing to like about it.

Firstly the premise was entirely contrived - a seemingly atheistic professor demanding his students sign a statement that God is dead. I think that alone would be grounds for formal complaints, and needless to say only one single student refuses to sign up. From there the student faces more and more hostility from his family, his friends, his girlfriend. But because he refused to sign the professor said he should defend his counter-stance from the front of the class, and allowed the class to decide who was the ""winner"".

It was hardly a surprise to find out that the ""atheist"" professor had issues from his childhood that resulted in him hating God. How do you hate someone who doesn't exist, one might ask. And indeed the one student asked just that. So no marks for the contrived professor character then - most atheists I know aren't atheists because they hate God, they are atheists because they have either an active belief in the non-existence of God or a passive lack of belief in the existence of God. We can argue over whether the latter group are technically agnostics all we want but the two groups of people will often self-identify as ""atheist"".

The way the class voted, and the ending of the movie were both tragically predictable. My thought after watching it was ""that's two hours of my life I'll never get back"".

Frankly I'd be embarrassed to expect my Christian friends to sit through drivel like this, and there's no way at all I'd ask a non-Christian friend to tolerate it. The only way I'd ever ask a friend to watch this with me is if I really didn't want to hang out with them any more.

Some other reviews have commented that it's easy to win a debate when you control both sides. That sums up the movie pretty well, and reading that one sentence will save you two hours of wishing something would happen that you couldn't see coming a mile off.",1441497600,5,1971,4.636103151862464

6416020,5,B00KD5HFJG,"A number of other reviewers have characterized this movie as being full of propaganda and lies.  Of course, it is propaganda, if you are using the word in its accurate definition, information, ideas, or rumors deliberately spread widely to help or harm a person, group, movement, institution, nation, etc. OR the particular doctrines or principles propagated by an organization or movement.  (Dictionary.com)  Propaganda is not necessarily false, despite the current negative connotation the word has acquired.  The movie is attempting to present and advance the evangelical Christian worldview, and it is very open about that objective.  As for being full of lies, it is easy to throw that charge around, but I didn't see a single definite instance in the other reviewers comments to back up the charge.
One reviewer denounced it as being full of stereotypes.  Groups become stereotyped because a significant number of the members of the group do indeed act in a certain way.  The characters were chosen to advance the story.  There was never any insinuation that all Chinese students behave as the one in the movie, or that all Muslim families behave as the family in the movie, or that all blonde girlfriends are selfish and demanding, or that all college professors abuse their authority to advance their own agendas.  However, I have known Chinese students very much like the one in the movie, I have lived several years in the Middle East and have known Muslim families very much like the one in the movie, I have known girls that are selfish and demanding, and having spent twelve years studying at several universities earning multiple degrees, and having taught at two different universities for over ten years, I have known a few professors (not many, thankfully) who have behaved exactly like the professor in the movie.  In fact, the negative reviewers actually back up the characterization of the professor as they make vociferous denunciations without ever addressing and answering specific claims, just as he did.
I am an evangelical Christian, and I found the movie to be encouraging and quite true to my own experience. The point is that people have a choice whether to believe in God or not.  Nobody is forcing anyone to believe in Him. The people who most loudly and actively deny His existence are almost always those who really do believe in Him, but hate or fear Him, as the movie portrayed.  To those who view Christian movies or read Christian books just so they can attack them, I would ask, What are you afraid of?
I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone, keeping in mind that it is a fictional story meant to inform and entertain, not intended to be a grand work of art.",1441497600,,2707,4.88646288209607

6416045,1,B00KD5HFJG,"I watched this movie, trying my best to give it the benefit of the doubt as it relied more and more on loathsome false cliches and rhetoric to make its twisted point. As a Christian who grew up in India surrounded by many friends of strong faith in non-Christian traditions, and then (as an adult in the U.S.) attending a Jesuit university which had mandatory theology courses, I have had an exposure to religious discussion at its best and at its most ignorant all through my life. This seemed like it might be good when I read the premise, but the film makes several mistakes which I find unforgivable in this day and age.

One thing I found galling was the portrayal of Muslim faith. There was so much they could have done to make Ayisha's conversion meaningful with some real examination of the different beliefs between the two religions. Instead they focused on the Hijab, and pretended that ""traditional"" Muslim faith is violent and that any exploration of Christian beliefs will cause a parent to disown his child and throw her into the street. I grew up in an apartment complex that housed Christian, Muslim and Hindu families. My friends and I spent holidays in each others homes, learning traditions and sharing stories of our own religions. One of my friends had a Christian mother and a Hindu father, which is even stranger than a Muslim-Christian marriage. At least Islam and Christianity share the same origins and belief in one God, with Islam even considering Jesus a prophet born of the virgin Mary. If the movie had focused on how Ayisha had come to believe that Jesus was divine, and not just one of the great prophets, it would have made for a far more convincing and powerful movie. Strike one.

The movie spent some time following Josh and his girlfriend being lovey-dovey and cute as they walked through campus, and that raised a red flag in my brain. Sure enough, when the conflict arose, she was painted as a villain and the feminist in me retched. My girlfriend and I started dating in youth group when we were in high school and had she been watching this with me, I'm pretty sure she'd have kicked a hole in the T.V. In real life, I have never met a Christian couple (or even a couple with one Christian) that had such a poor dynamic. Most couples I've met are extremely supportive of each others decisions and struggles. The fact that this film chose to make the girlfriend an antagonist, and that she would end the relationship when his choice threatened her idea of what their hypothetical future should be... it was unrealistic. As with Ayisha's story, there were so many other choices in how to portray the story that would have been so much better. Strike two.

My third criticism was Professor Radisson's reasons for antagonizing believers. It was a cliche among cliches. It was the farcical A-Few-Good-Men style showdown in the classroom between Wheaton and Radisson that made me give up on any hope of a redeeming factor that would allow me to give this movie anything but the lowest rating. I was an atheist for a while too before I learned to see God's work in people's lives. I understand why people can attribute everything to science and believe in their heart that there is no God. If Radisson's belief was simply intellectual I would have had far more respect for this movie, but the screenwriter just had to destroy it by making him sound like an angsty teenager blaming God for all his problems. I paused the movie for a day when I got to that point because I couldn't bear to watch it any longer, and I finished it only to write this review. I wish I hadn't. The two key moments of the last 27 minutes were the class's unanimous agreement that God is not dead (even in Theology class at a Jesuit university, it would be impossible to get that response, and my professors were considerably more convincing than Wheaton) and Radisson's death scene. Believe in Christ kids, or you'll get hit by a car! Blech.

In reading other reviews, I get the impression that many of this movie's critics are Christians, and most of its supporters are Christian too. I feel like that says something about the failings of this movie; something truly powerful would draw a more diverse crowd and better discussion. I turned back to Christianity only after learning more about my Grandfather's life, and I feel like any single chapter from the book he wrote would make a more convincing case for Christianity than the entirety of this movie. I wish there were movies that portrayed faith more intelligently.",1440806400,120,4535,4.665

I just really thought that Gods Not Dead was a horrendously awful movie. In the first place, it should definitely not be classified as a childrens film. Moving to more substantive matters, I think a real Christian [not the many people who claim God when doing so is convenient for them] would be offended by this movie. The message coming from this film seems to be If you don't believe in God, you're a moron.

I cannot think of a more cruel message to send and actually undercuts the message of faith, hope, and love of all the Christians I know. That doesnt mean that you love only those who share your worldview, but everyone regardless of where you find them in life. I actually hated the tone of the entire movie, in the first half, Christians are belittled for believing in God, and then it does this 180 and by the end, if you don't believe in God, you're severely lacking.

Decisions about religious faith are very complex and personal things and it felt like this movie just trivialized that for really everybody. Coupled with the fact that no philosophy prof. I have ever met would engage in such a way on the God question just really make this an unbelievable movie designed to forward a pro-religion agenda.

6416066,2,B00KD5HFJG,"This film is preaching to the choir. It appeals to a certain subgroup of those who are already Christians, but not to others.

The film starts out with an interesting theme, but then seems to lose its way. Probably half the film could be cut, with the movie being improved. There are subplots that are irrelevant except for the preaching that they givethe final concert, all of it; the businessman; the reporter, all her scenes; the Muslim family; etc. They were all irrelevant to the story. But they all took up valuable time that could have been used to develop the main plot. There were scenes that I anticipated that never happened because of the preaching.

By the very nature of the plot, there would be a lot of dialogue. Or rather, that there should have been. Rather, too much of became a monologue. There needed to be more give and take, discussion between the main character and his mentors at church, the missionary from Africa could have brought in some insight, discussions with other students, give and take in class. Instead, much of it is just lecture, and ultimately lecturing the audience.

The scenes where the cars didn't start were unbelievable. The batteries were obviously charged, the starter motors working, all that was needed was for the character to step on the gas.

One place of unintended humor was where a Chinese father and son were conversingthe father was speaking Mandarin, the son Cantonese. Did the movie makers think no one would catch it?

In closing, the film is a jumbled mess that takes too long. Because of all those irrelevant scenes, the apologetic that it lectures is incomplete, though not necessarily wrong. This incompleteness is another example of preaching to the choir, as many of those already convinced can recognize to where the monologue was heading, but those not familiar with the argument wouldnt recognize it, The movie had potential, but poor writing and editing frittered it away.",1440201600,3,1944,4.878787878787879

6416074,3,B00KD5HFJG,"This film is preaching to the choir.

It started out with an interesting challenge, but it didn't fulfill its promise. By the very nature of the challenge, one would expect the film to be heavy on dialogue. Unfortunately, more of it was monologue than dialogue, preaching instead of performance. I found myself rooting for scenes that never occurred.

One unintended piece of humor was where a Chinese father and son talked on the phone, the father spoke in Mandarin, the son Cantonese. Did they really think no one would catch that?

The scenes where the cars didn't start were unbelievable. The batteries were clearly charged, the starter motors clearly turning the engines over at a good clip. Those engines should have started. Just step on the gas.

There were scenes that could have been cut out of the film and they would have made it a better film. The parts about the businessman whose mother had dementia did nothing for the film. The concert scene was sappy and could have been cut out. The woman reporter who got cancer added nothing to the plot. These all and more could have been cut out, and in their place the main plot could have been better developed. The missionary from Africa begged to be more in the plot, as well as the youth pastor and more interaction of other students with the main character. In short, the film became too preachy, and as a result lost much of its focus.

I am a Bible-believing Christian and have been involved with apologetics for years, so I recognized some of the intellectual arguments presented by the main character. However, they went by so quickly that I think many in the audience would not have recognized them.

The result, a film that talks to a subculture of modern Christianity, but really doesnt speak to the general public. While it doesnt say anything wrong, because of its lost focus, it doesnt present its message well either. It ends up more of a sappy, emotional and preachy film than a story.",1440028800,4,1959,4.680232558139535

It's sophomoric and weak arguments are quite tired and full of logical fallacies with no voice within the film that is capable of pointing any of them out. The movie completely misses the point (as do most Christians) of the statement ""God is Dead"" which even the professor didn't seem to understand. It was never meant to be a statement proclaiming that God is actually dead, but rather the importance of God as the sole moral authority within society at large, was dying.

If you are an evangelical Christian that only wishes to hear one side of the argument, which will be perceived as proving your own views to be correct, then you will likely love this film.  If you are a critically thinking individual (theists included) you will find this film to be rather bland, predictable and wholly lacking in any solid argument.",1439337600,6,876,4.718954248366013

6416114,1,B00KD5HFJG,"A pandering, preaching to the choir bit of propaganda. I have many Christian friends who were actively promoting this movie, so I thought I'd give it a try. After reading some of the promotionals and watching a few trailers, I was suspecting the worst. And I was not disappointed in that aspect.

The portrayal of non-Christians is extreme, to say the least. Arrogant, rude, obnoxious people laughing and openly mocking the ""true believers"" is what propaganda is made of. These are the people every flock of sheep is preached to guard against, no matter that people like this are not the norm. The truth is most non-Christians I know (myself included) don't care one way or the other what someone believes. I don't agree with that sect, but I don't make it a point to mock those who do follow it.

On the flip side, all the good little Christians are portrayed as beleaguered, put upon, almost hiding their beliefs while still trying to remain true. Again, not necessarily the truth. I know many who are not only openly vocal about their beliefs but believe in their perceived right to force their beliefs onto everyone else. In many places anyone who is NOT Christian is beleaguered, put upon, and afraid to show their difference for fear of being harassed by the local flocks.

Then there are the ""arguments"" given by the hero of the film. Faulty logic, biased sources, and faulty correspondences. Any professor that felt so strongly against something would have been able to tear apart those arguments easily. I know I certainly could, and I don't hate Christianity.

In all, it was nothing more than a feel-good flick to make those who wish to make Christianity into law feel better about themselves. Any rational person capable of clinical reasoning will not be heavily swayed by this.",1439078400,3,1790,4.8019480519480515

6416134,1,B00KD5HFJG,"Where to begin with this movie? It is not a work of art; it is a piece of cinematic propaganda for an [apparently] unthinking Christian populace. Its cardboard caricatures of philosophy professors, academic life, and adherents of other religions would be laughable if they weren't serious. The magical way in which everything pieces together at the end makes one thing that G-d is in the habit of creating miniature miracles if only we ask - a kind of lopsided prosperity theology found nowhere in the Bible. I was particularly offended by the demonization of philosophy as a field of academia opposed to the Gospel. I am a devout Christian AND a lover of philosophy, and some of the best philosophers - Kierkegaard, for instance - were also believers. Oh, no, that can't be true! declares this movie.
The icing on the cake was the shameless endorsement of the ""Christian"" gurus of Duck Dynasty, who hardly give an accurate portrayal of the Christian life in postmodern America, and the has-been CCM band the Newsboys, who declined in quality the minute that Peter Furler departed. And at the last minute, the unbelieving professor gets run over by a car and makes a deathbed confession while bleeding to death on the asphalt. Had to find a way to preach a miniature sermon somewhere in this film, didn't we?
It makes me incredibly sad that Christians have not yet managed to produce good films. There are plenty of musicians and authors who know how to incorporate their faith into their art without being overly didactic, trite, or commodifying with their beliefs; I pray that one day, we might have a filmmaker who can do the same.

6416152,1,B00KD5HFJG,"The initial premise of this film is that an arrogant, atheist professor attempts to strong arm his students into saying ""God is Dead."" A scenario which has happened in America exactly never. You can stop watching there. But if you want to know what the ""debate"" is about -- the Christian student says, you cannot prove that God does not exist and where did we all come from if there was nothing before. Uh, duh. ""The bible had it right and science had it wrong"" is the immediate conclusion. Really? That's it. And then the angry, evil, atheist professor (Kevin Sorbo) threatens the student's academic future. Does this seem plausible to you? If so, you'll probably love this ridiculous film. The film might as well have had Satan pop out of the ground to set fire to religious people with his Nazi minions; or a wicked witch eating the brains of Christian children. Same dumb fantasy. The whole film is a straw man argument: ""Look at how these atheists are oppressing us and trying to twist our children's minds. We must stand up publicly and declare our faith!"" Right, because the existence of gods can't be proven or disproven -- which is the same exact thing that atheists say: ""You can't disprove the existence of flying unicorns either.""

One example of how dumb the setup is: Sorbo's character is made to be a Philosophy professor, simply so the religious boy can say, ""Stephen Hawing said on page 5, 'Philosophy is dead.' So, if we rely on his opinion, then there's no need for this class."" Come on! That's the best argument this film can come up with to refute critics of religion? What philosophy professor would even be so singularly driven to push a viewpoint onto his students? The point of philosophy class is to expose students to a wide-range of schools of thought, and to explain how those influential individuals' ideas have affected our world over time. None of that is part of this film at all. Darwin and the theory of evolution are given equally stupid interpretations -- portrayed as flawed because we have had a ""sudden leap"" of diversity in life forms in the timespan of the universe and this planet. Really? Just leaped from celled creatures and viruses -- no traceable genetic similarities or lines of fossils have ever been found or put in logical order? Sorbo's character has no counter-argument, and neither do any of the other students. They're all just simple-minded and dazzled by this student's brilliant Biblical interpretation of how the universe works. All of which makes All of which makes the atheist Sorbo fester and stew in his power-hungry, anti-theist, student-controlling nonsense. Wow.

This film is so over-the-top ridiculousness, crafted to appeal to viewers who already believe that their traditions are under attack... by the self-absorbed, atheist, scientific boogeyman. This would have been much more challenging if it had been about a Psychology class or Medical class instead. But that would have been way too hard to argue about science. Instead we are set to focus on Philosophy, where you can't prove or disprove that social constructs and personal opinions are real or dead. Such perfect nonsense.",1438387200,4,3153,4.891588785046729

6416156,5,B00KD5HFJG,"God's Not Dead is a really great movie. The only advertising that I saw for this movie was a movie poster at my local theatre. I decided to see the movie, and I wasn't disappointed. I have since purchased several DVD copies of this movie for friends and family.  And all of their comments  have been extremely positive. This movie is changing lives for the better. I will continue to buy more DVD copies of this movie. The message in this movie is something that everyone should hear. I have watched the movie several times, and will continue to enjoy the movie , the music, and the bonus features. You can watch this movie in English or Spanish(hear it in English or Spanish), and you can also add English or Spanish subtitles to  see every word that is spoken. You will not want to miss a single word. In addition, I have purchased the T-Shirt, The Newsboys CD of ""God's Not Dead(Like A Lion) music, The book ; ""God's Not Dead, Evidence for God in an Age of Uncertainty"", and I intend to purchase ""God's Not Dead Adult Study Guide : What Do You Believe?""",1438387200,,1056,4.4051282051282055

6416167,3,B00KD5HFJG,"I saw that a friend mentioned he watched this movie in a facebook post and that he liked it.  That sparked my interest so I looked if it was on Amazon Prime.  Hooray for me! I would put it on my wishlist and maybe watch it someday.  But then started reading the reviews.  That convinced me to stay up all night and watch it.

The top 5 most helpful reviews were 4 one star, and 1 two star reviews.  It was hated by everyone pretty uniformly.  Now having watched it, I understand the bad reviews.  There were more good than bad reviews according to their little line graph but Amazon only showed me the horrible reviews to read.  God knows why... (pun intended)

I'm giving 3 stars. That might be high looking at it one way, might be low looking at it differently.

The movie is almost pure clich and is predictable.  Many of the characters more shallow than 10 cent detective novel characters from the 30s.  One spot I particularly disliked was a violent scene covered with very loud annoying music where the lyrics were clearly saying what the director wanted the viewer to think about the scene the music was destroying.  Bad taste.

In my opinion the movie mistakenly and poorly portrays Christians.  I think only Josh, the primary apologetics freshman student, escapes being horribly displayed as Christian. Atheists and anti-theists get the same unfair treatment, being portrayed poorly or mistakenly.

I was able to enjoy the movie.  I can overlook a lot of producer and director idiocy and still enjoy a story.  The one part I did enjoy was the Christian apologetics.  I'll never get used to the meaning of that word, apologetics as explaining in favor of something.  Seems to me, if someone is for something or believes in something, explaining their favorable leanings is not apologetic in any way.  But we have the language we have, so there it is.

There is some drama and tension there, but it is unintentionally shallow.  There are characters you can hate and some you can like, so it is possible to enjoy this movie.  If you decide to give it a go, just go in knowing it is a very bad portrayal of Christians meaning to be favorable of Christians, sadly attempting to portray anti-Christians poorly and in unlikely ways.

Don't misunderstand, I'm Christian and want you to 'be saved' and love my God as much as I do, but I would rather poor salt into my eyes than do this movie to you as an effort to convince you my spiritual inclinations should be your spiritual inclinations. I think what the movie tries to do, cause and effect in people,  it produces the opposite effect.",1438214400,9,2590,4.598253275109171

6416171,2,B00KD5HFJG,"This movie was suggested to me by a good friend of mine who called it a ""interesting and sufficing argument for the existence of God"". This excited me because I've been heavily invested in world religions and philosophical debate since my high school years. *Sigh* maybe I hyped myself up too much. Maybe I raised my expectations too high. I'll admit, that's my fault, not the movie's. But that's not why I don't like this film. I don't like this because it's simply a terrible film. The characters were two-dimensional, their social dynamics was unrealistic, the dialog was awkward, the drama was corny, the subplots were boring, the moral was dubious. And the debate - don't get me started! The ""debate"" portions of this movie was some of the most one-sided, emotionally pleading, fallacious sermons I've ever heard.

This movie panders to a very shallow demographic and almost offensively misrepresents atheism as well as a few other social groups. The only thing stopping me from giving this movie one star is that it did technically teach me something. That there are people who actually think this way, apparently. I honestly feel like I have a better understanding on the kind of people who don't see anything wrong with a movie like this. This move actually made me a better debater by showing me what a bad argument looks like. So if you're a philosophy student and you need practice spotting fallacies in an argument, or if you're looking for an over the top movie to laugh at, this movie is perfect for you. Otherwise, it's trash.",1438041600,4,1541,4.793233082706767

6416176,5,B00KD5HFJG,"My husband and I really enjoyed this movie. It was very well made with quality,  and some well-known actors. The idea that the story was based on -Josh proving God's existence was an interesting topic for a movie. Showing multiple characters and their stories added to the movie. When Dean Cain (Mia's brother) visited his mom and she spoke such powerful words it was very touching, and true. So much of the movie was touching. This movie showed what happens to a lot of people through the professor's character. Something devastating happens to them and they become mad at God. When you find out why he is an atheist you understand his characters bitterness. I think this movie has something for everyone. The main character is a role model in that he is willing the stand up for his beliefs and make them public. Most people wouldn't do that. They may have faith but they are not willing to publicly make it known because of the world we live in. The fact that he was a young college student  is inspiring for young and old alike. The music was very enjoyable in this movie and was very well done throughout the whole movie. More movies of this quality need to made because what is being made for tv and the theater today is quickly becoming unwatchable if you have standards.

6416185,1,B00KD5HFJG,"This movie is great for Christian fundies (probably). God's Not Dead has it all. Atheists who actually believe God is real but simply hate Him due to childhood tragedy, the deathbed conversion, violent and intolerant Muslims (along with a slew of other racial stereotypes), unrealistically sadistic college professors who delight in abusing their openly theist students, fallacious arguments along with a host of kindergarten apologetics that somehow stymies the movie's veteran philosophy professor (as if he had never heard in all his years the cosmological argument). This last point was quite frustrating. This professor, introduced as an intellectual powerhouse, proves to be incredibly bad at spotting the most basic of fallacies (argument from ignorance, straw man, equivocation, shifting the burden of proof, special pleading to name a few).

I would have given 2 stars if it had been entertaining. Since it smelled more like propaganda than simply misinformed entertainment I am forced to be conservative with my stars. Its not as if I have an endless supply of the things after all.",1437868800,5,1092,5.348837209302325

6416192,4,B00KD5HFJG,"This movie serves as an introduction to apologetics and while there may be some issues its certainly not all bad, if fact there is a lot of good.

The movie needs to be evaluated for what it is and thought given to what purpose it may serve. This can be seen as a dramatic introduction to the field of apologetics which may well become invaluable to some young (and older) people. This type of movie can spark interest and become a starting point from which they can grow.

I encourage anyone who may be interested to listen to William Lane Craig's podcast on issues relating to this movie at the link below. Craig is a widely known and respected apologist and he interacts with an article critical of this movie and of apologetics. I also encourage those who are interested to become familiar with presuppositional apologetics, this approach is different from that generally used in the movie and by Craig and is helpful in providing a well-rounded perspective.

Add that to the almost mindless liberalism that today's graduates exude, and the logical deduction is that the premise of compulsory assent with the professorial agenda is well-founded.

I watch it all just to see if somehow they could pull something out of it, but it is outrageous how bad it is.  It misinforms about philosophy, Christianity, Islam, and in general is a particularly idiotic treatment of important questions for young people, which defeats the overall idea of the movie.

6416237,1,B00KD5HFJG,"I painfully watched all of this movie, in its entirety, in order to give it the benefit of the doubt. This was a difficult task as this film is terrible on many levels. The script is awful, the plot is terrible and unrealistic, the acting is barely passable, but the premise and the message are a mess. I find it hard to take this film seriously when the act of starting a car becomes a miracle like walking on water. If that were an act of god then that god needs to get a scheduler so the poor missionary can FINALLY fulfil his lifelong dream of wearing Mickey Mouse ears! Instead, god ruins the whole weekend by making them wait for synchronicity a poor muslim-converted-to-christian outcast to cry because god has given her trials, miserable rain, and the untimely death of the Kevin Sorbo character where he finds Jesus again. Not nice god! I would be very insulted if I were a non-christian theist by the way some were portrayed in this film. As for the classroom drama, typically lame arguments that have no real value to anyone except a true believer. I find that so insulting as well as the film is just preaching to the choir.

6416257,1,B00KD5HFJG,"As someone with a degree in philosophy, I am disgusted by this ""movie"". Real philosophers debate the existence of God with cogent arguments, they don't pretend to know the answers, nor force such answers onto college students. That is, quite literally, the opposite of what philosophy is all about.

The movie doesn't even get point of the quote it takes as its title. Nietzsche wasn't making an argument that God does not exist. The quote has absolutely nothing to do with that. In actuality, nietzsche was talking about the effects of disbelief in God on moral principles.

This movie is nothing more than Christian propaganda. It gets almost nothing right, but does a wonderful job at getting so, so many things wrong. There is a reason why critics (regardless of their religion) have blasted this movie to pieces, whereas sites like this have rated it so high. Don't you wonder why that is??",1436659200,22,895,4.8431372549019605

The funniest thing is that the producers really hope to convert some (perhaps tons of) atheists with the film. Offensive because the dumbness comes piggybacked on ugly misogynist, racist, and anti-intellectual stereotypes.

Here we have a professor that just to skip a section of his class wants everyone in his class to immediately sign a piece of paper saying Gods dead and believe his viewpoint.  Even though you can see some students think about there decision to write that, all but one stands against the crowd of peer pressure along with intimidation from his professor.  Now he could of done what a lot of Christians will do sometimes and what the professor was expected and begin to aggressively defend his stance, while in turn actually makes Christians look bad.

I am not a philosophy major or even a biblical studies major; but, this movie fails on ALL fronts.  Again, its another whiny movie talking about the ""repressed Christians in America"" being bullied by ""Big Intellectuals."" I am so sick of this argument its beyond absurd.  If you really think you are opressed, have a Presidential nominee say hey I am an Atheist! and see how that goes, exactly you're not oppressed.

Then I actually thought it would have some interesting debates on both sides,  it had neither the theology might work on a 10 year; but, honestly this is just pandering to those who already have ""faith."" If you remotely question anything, for either side it all falls apart.  This is just a giant cheer leading movie for Christians to go out and say ""yeah we are picked on all the time at college and the stuff I learned at age 8 is still relevant! Go Jesus!.""

Honestly, I could keep going; but, that is just pandering to the movie, just don't watch it, its stupid.  The Atheist are stupid, the Christians and stupid, the whole movie is stupid.  I want my time back for having watched this pseudo intellectual garbage.",1436227200,7,1235,4.497757847533633

I have been dissed by 5 fundamentalist religions, and one of my fave movies is, Inherit the Wind, with the great Spencer Tracy and rare dramatic role by Gene Kelly as cynical reporter. I do believe in Jesus and all the ways God teaches in every culture and in every heart. It is easy to say this is one-sided, but the Christian girlfriend dumping the protagonist is real and not one-sided. This is a movie about finding out Who You Are, and finding out if your family and friends Really Love You, when you stand up for it. Accepting others and loving them no matter what is what life is all about, and so it happens Jesus, also...any religion could be like this... And i wish more were...

My mind doesn't comprehend the existence of a god.  In my opinion there is no being, entity, god, ;or whatever, that could create something so complex as the universe.  So many of the opinions and points made by the main character are flawed.  Personally, I feel persecuted whenever in the presence of Christians when they know I am an Atheist.  Even my sister!  She is a pretty fundamental Christian and she judges people like they are Satan.  Many Christians do this.  I treat everyone the same.  Believe what you want to believe.  I don't care if you believe in God or not, but don't throw a fit and treat me like I am a terrible person because I don't.  In the movie they make an argument that there would be no morals without a God; that without god, people would lie, cheat, steal, murder, etc.  Nonsense.  These are all learned behaviors.  Your parents teach you that all of these things are wrong.  I don't murder or steal from people because I place value on other peoples lives and property, not because I am afraid that God will strike me down if I do.  I work for what I have so I know how bad it would suck to have someone steal my stuff, therefore I don't steal other peoples things.  Its just common sense.",1435968000,2,1376,4.388888888888889

6416328,1,B00KD5HFJG,"God's Not Dead amplifies the very worst of the Evangelical Christian sub-culture and makes me want to have absolutely nothing to do with it. The biggest problem is that the film thinks that it's doing/being so much that it isn't. The movie operates within an inch of the surface, but clearly thinks that it's diving deep into the soul. It tries to be complex, but it's as simple as things get. It's so contrived and predictable, and the way all of the stories fit together ""perfectly"" lacks any sort of natural or realistic flow. There is no character development - each person is a caricature (angry atheist, militant muslim, godless Chinese exchange student, charismatic African pastor, frustrated but gentle young, white American pastor...) If you are an evangelical Christian, and you love this movie, fine. Any hopes that it's going to have any sort of impact at all on those who don't already love evangelical Christian sub-culture are delusional.",1435104000,6,953,5.0
6416329,5,B00KD5HFJG,"First I just want to say I loved the movie. It has a great central core meaning that no matter the persecution, keep faith and stand up for that faith. I will say *SPOILER ALERT* I will be discussing parts of this movie to combat the negative views it has been given.
That being said, all those who are stating that the movie is unrealistic and doesn't stand for real apologetics and hermenentics are missing out on the big picture. Having a philosophy teacher force the students to sign a paper stating that God is dead may sound unrealistic, and for the most part it is. However, persecution comes from every angle, including college. This isn't a movie founded on political standpoints of what is and isn't allowed to happen within a college atmosphere, but a spiritual revival in the sense that we all should not fear persecution but attack it head on. So my advice to you is to not focus so much on realism (I mean when has a movie ever been fully realistic? Spiderman isn't real, nor is Thor. So save the relistic expectation to a different media) and focus on the concept at had. A freshman in college, entering into a new world, who on the first day of class faces persecution, gets rediculed, loses his girlfriend of 6 years because of his commitment to stand up for the Lord. This movie focuses on one passage, Mathew 10:32-33. ""So everyone who acknowledges me before men, I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven, but whoever denies me before men, I will deny before my Father who is in heaven."" -ESV. Let this be the message you see and hear, do not focus on the political realism within the movie.
There was another who stated that it was unbelievable due to the fact the movie ended with everyone believing. For one, I do not think this is fully true, The son of the woman with dimentia does not fully make that leap of faith. However, of course a religious movie will end with all believers because in the end of days that's exactly how it will end as well. All believers.
The last point I want to argue is that the movie seems to follow an Evangelical Christian stand point in which they try to 'force' their opinion on you. But let's again turn to the scripture. ""How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching? And how are they to preach unless they are sent? As it is written, How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news!"" - Romans 10:14-15 ESV. This movie discusses the importance of spreading the word, having faith, and enduring persecution.
For all those who focus on realism, movies aren't the best things to watch. If you want real 100% truth, the only thing that can offer that is the Bible, so just stick with that if you are such a stickler on realism. For those who believe it was not realistic to end on everyone believing, I ask you, how do you expect the end of days to be when the only surviving people are the believers. Lastly for those who say that it focuses on Evengelical Christians who 'force' their beliefs on people. It does not, they are simply spreading the word of God as we are commanded to. They can not force the person to leave, and this movie does not even have any pushing of beliefs, as the main character states, ""I am here to give them the choice to believe or not."" That is all this movie does.
For all that still wish to dislike this movie, that is your decision. Just know that this movie was for young adults and teenagers. The day we live in can be very unfriendly and is filled with sin. It is our choice which path we will take.",1435104000,3,3656,4.36217008797654

Pros: obviously I have a bias, but it's always good to see God defended. I also loved how it empathized with people in genuine hurt and pain.

Cons: Genuinely disrespectful of non-believers with very little willingness to empathize with their suspicions against Christianity; it's just not going to be swallowable to unbelievers, guys. Not nearly enough homework was made regarding modern atheist arguments against Christian arguments, the professor was way too weak, I've come across much stronger atheists who made better points yet they're still wrong. Also the creators didn't script a single muttering word (that I noticed) explaining how theistic worldview must equal ""follow Jesus"". An educated Christian can reach this conclusion but there are other theistic beliefs that do not involve Jesus. In fact, the film depicted Muslims here, Muslims believe in (a) God, but merely intellectualizing proof God exists using creationism philosophy should lead to Islam as quickly as it would lead to Jesus. But most frustrating of all was how the movie perfectly depicted American Christianity's idolatry of music itself. Just as in real life in America and its Sunday morning church meetings, concert stages have taken the place of the altar, and people now exercise their faith in stadium seats with smartphones rather than on their knees or around living or dining rooms in communion with friends and family. Of course this was a big hit of a movie, of course it has so many likes. Of course. It's what American Christianity culture is all about. 'Murica! Weeerroww..!",1434931200,2,1729,5.215827338129497

Not an exhaustive list of my observations, because I didn't take notes and really don't want to watch this again, but here's what I think the filmmakers want you to know:

- First and foremost, Christians are persecuted everywhere, even though upwards of 73% of Americans are Christians (admittedly not all are the right kind of Christian)
- Atheists know God exists, they're are just angry with God, or deny him so they can be bad.
- Non-believers who don't know about Jesus will convert once they hear the Good News.
- Richard Dawkins and Stephen Hawking are serious philosophers worthy of appearing on the whiteboard alongside the likes of, oh actual philosophers.
- Atheist philosophy professors have the power to ruin the rest of your life and career if you disagree with them.
- And they will gladly waste several classes and all the other students' time letting Christian teenagers try to prove God exists.
- ""evolutionists"" are wrong
-  all you need to do to prove God exists is to quote others and to explain science that, likely, neither you or your audience understands. And if that  fails (or if you take the quotes out of context, or fib about a quotee's credentials, or https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/logical-take/201403/god-s-not-dead-neither-is-philosophy), fall back on ""Free Will!"" and ""FAITH"" and Bible quotes.

I did laugh at some of the more ludicrous scenes. Like Duck Dynasty guy. Twice. And the Christian rock concert.

And whatever they think they were doing in that philosophy class, it was NOT philosophy. For a review of this movie from a real philosophy professor, look here: http://www.patheos.com/blogs/camelswithhammers/2014/03/a-philosophy-professor-analyzes-gods-not-deads-case-for-god/

But the last scene was just terrible.  The professor is struck by a speeding car, but it's ALL GOOD, 'cuz Pastor Dave and his buddy (who must be a doctor because he's absolutely certain that his ribs are crushed and his lungs are filling with blood and he has just moments left to repent and be saved) were there (OMG is that why the cars wouldn't start? Is that why they're stuck in Christian rock concert traffic?)  and made sure that Professor Jerk Atheist repented, admitted he was really scared of dying and found Jesus before he took his final breath.

First off, pretty much everyone who wasn't Christian was unrealistically evil, be it atheist, Muslim, agnostic, or a person of eastern philosophies.  Until they convert to Christianity that is. (spoiler) every single person ends up Christian for extremely intellectually shallow reasons by the end of the movie.  (Which is also unrealistic, atheists don't convert easily)

And as someone who has actually taken an atheism course in college, I guarantee the college structure is not this oppressive gladiator arena that the film paints.  This film seems to have the idea that colleges are actually evil conversion grounds to convince mindless sheep that God isn't real.  It was also very anti-science/knowledge/questioning things. That film seems to make the case that we shouldn't ask questions because it's all just there in the bible.
And the science is just plain messed up.  They claim that evolution is wrong because all life jumped into existence as it is in a small period of time, and they acted like science backs that up.

While it's true that the non-Christians were stereotyped, the film highlights some deeper truths -- not depending on someone or something to define you (a romantic interest, a job, wealth, authority figures), for example. A weakness of the film was in having too many subplots, rather than fewer but more rigorous story lines and character journeys. One moment a character is sobbing in the pastor's office because her father has thrown her out for converting, and the next she's dancing at a Newsboys concert. ???

6416420,5,B00KD5HFJG,"This movie has a clear Christian agenda, (this should come to no surprise to anyone) so if that bothers you... DON'T WATCH IT.
Now, as for the movie:  The movie is based on a series of real-life stories including one real-life story of an American Professor in Florida who ordered his students to write ""Jesus"" on a piece of paper then put the paper on the ground and stomp on it.  One student in the class did not do the assignment and received an ""F"" and was even kicked out of the college!  The movie is also inspired by the real life academic hostility many students are subjected too their first year or two in college.  The characters are all based on real life characters.  For example, the character ""Martin Yip"" is inspired by the real life experiences of a college student  Ming Wang (an atheist student at Harvard turned Christian).

The movie tells the story of ""Josh Wheaton,"" who is a young college kid who is taking classes towards his major and is forced to take one class with a dreaded, ruthless professor most students attempt to avoid (I've been there).  Professor Radisson, played by Kevin Sorbo nails the role perfectly.  He really captures the essence of an arrogant, egotistic college professor, who thinks he is a ""god"", and uses his psychological and educational advantages over his students to intimidate them, and scare them into submissing to his classroom rules if they want to pass.  Far from merely secular rules, it is clear the professor has an agenda and has anger and resentment towards God/Christianity.  Josh Wheaten refuses an assignment to write on a piece of paper ""God is Dead.""  As he refuses, he will be forced to receive an ""F"" in the class unless he can defend the antithesis.  However, he must debate the instructor himself.  There are several side stories dealing with supporting characters and could probably have been explored more in the movie.

The movie is entertaining and well done.  I was very impressed with the work they were able to do with such a small budget.  The movie was wildly successful.  It has grossed 61 million dollars domestically, and millions more internationally, all against a very humble budget of only 2 million.  I would recommend it as a good family movie with an excellent sound track featuring popular songs such as ""God's not Dead"" by the Newsboys.",1433462400,3,2331,4.753731343283582

6416424,5,B00KD5HFJG,"I planned on watching this movie last night and had some time to kill yesterday so I read some reviews on here.  I must say that after reading some of the detailed negative reviews I was expecting something completely different than what I had previously heard when the movie initially came out.  And after sitting edge of my seat for the first 30 minutes to see all of the 'highly charged Christian political non-sense' (as several 1 star reviews pointed out), I realized their reviews were a bunch of non-sense and sat back to enjoy the movie.

While some of the acting was a bit ham handed, as there are new actors as well as some famous non-actors in the movie, the overall message of the movie is a positive one.  Given that this movie was probably not going for any ""best actor"" awards, I can look passed this.  I did wish that they could have gone into greater detail in the debates, but given that he only had 20 minutes at the end of class to present his case I feel it was probably an accurate representation of what he could get into.

For anyone that has gone against the grain to stand up for what they believe in, this is a great movie to show that there are others out there that struggle as well and that not all parts of that path are easy.

To the ""stereotype crowd"", you obviously don't know that these type of people exist that these types of incidents do actually happen around the world.  It's not meant to represent everyone, but it does accurately portray some of the personal struggles people come across.

Overall I greatly enjoyed the movie's message and the types of characters and their growth.

**SPOILERS** Going to get into some specifics.

Kevin Sorbo's character is claimed to be unrealistic by some.  I actually knew someone for many years that lost a grandmother to poor hospital conditions before I met him and then last a grandfather to cancer after I had known him for years.  He was raised ""Church of England"" and struggled with anything religious.  After his grandfather died, there was an obvious change.  He grew angry and bitter and blamed God for taking him.  He became unbearable to be around and eventually I had to break ties with my best friend of 10 years. Back to Sorbo, you can also see his progression back to Christ.  He's never been challenged like that since he made his decision to hate God.  He didn't accept Christ at the end because he feared death (IHMO), he accepted Him because he'd come to the realization that God was the the truth and he'd been living a hate filler lie.

The main character's girlfriend -  I have known people like this as well.  I had a former boss who's first wife left him because he wanted to go to a seminary college for his education.  Not because he wanted to become a preacher, but because he wanted to learn more about God.  She left him because she refused to be a preacher's wife (as she thought that was the only outcome) and that was not part of her plans.

The Muslim woman  - There are plenty of stories of children being disowned or worse around the world by Muslim parents after they convert.  I don't know why this is unheard of to some.  And I would say they chose a Muslim character due to the reportedly worse outcomes.  They are careful to say that his father is more traditional and they also show how remorseful her father is.  He is angry at first, but you see his heart break at the end and I'm sure if the story continued we would see him try to reconnect with his daughter as to me that appeared to be the kind of man he was.

The Chinese man - There are still reports of Christian persecution in China.  It's not a secret that it still happens, heck it happens to almost any religion over there that the government doesn't approve of.  I felt his father's reactions were quite accurate of someone that feared repercussion from the government.

Dean Cain's character obviously didn't want to go through loosing someone like he was loosing his mother, so he cut ties with his girlfriend after she got cancer as a defense mechanism.  You actually have to watch the entire movie and think about it afterward to understand that.",1433462400,,4135,4.469333333333333

6416445,1,B00KD5HFJG,"Terrible movie, but might be useful for a classroom to analyze and critique (as a free Instant Video only--I wouldn't want to add a penny to the $40 million this offensive, laughable movie has already earned on its $2 million cost to make).. There are so many strawman arguments and cold, uncaring ""non-believers"" that surely there's got to be some way to use it to build critical thinking skills rather than succeeding at its goal of brainwashing. It's such a mess--and yet, apparently, so widely shown.

The film begins with a college professor telling his students they can skip past a major portion of the class by just doing as he instructs and ""admitting"" that ""God is dead"" by writing just that on their paper and turning it in.  (Even Kevin Sorbo, a very good actor, can't save this crazy atheist bully from the badly written script).

One student refuses to write ""God is dead"", instead telling Sorbo ""I can't. I'm a Christian."" For this act of ""defiance"", the professor upbraids him before the class, makes him defend himself in an essay and at the podium in a debate (set up with various strawman arguments), and then Sorbo threatens him that, if that's really what he believes,  ""I'll do everything I can to make sure you never get into law school.""

This film is often shown by Christian camps to pre-college age teens and younger children.. It would be sad if young Christians--if anyone--would be afraid of college courses, believing  that real life professors would act like this toward them just for being a Christian.. (If anyone's reading this, I promise you, in real life, this man would not have gotten this job to begin with--and if he had it and began acting like this, he'd be fired.  If you're a Christian, you really don't have to be afraid to attend college. And in real life, atheists are often also humanists, very respectful of individual differences, including differences in religious beliefs.  This guy's just a crazy bully, nothing more.)

While Sorbo is making his Christian student's life horrible,  another evil atheist, this one a businessman played by Dean Cain--(yes, Superman)--is dumping his girlfriend because he doesn't want to be bothered when  she tells him that she has cancer, because... well, this movie truly believes that if people don't believe in God, they have no reason to be caring or nice.

As the film tells us, ""When you don't believe in God, anything is permissible."" A scary thought, considering the world is full of billions of people don't believe in the Christian God (the only god that matters here), and many are atheists.. But this is a movie to teach intolerance toward everyone who doesn't share the filmmakers' idea of God, and ""fear of differences"" is a time-tested way to do promote bigotry and prejudice toward non-Christians, as this movie does..

SPOILER:...The closest hint to ""why be a Christian"" comes at the end, where the evil atheist professor is hit by a car. But luckily for him a Christian sees him lying in the street and knows just what to do--no, not call an ambulance, are you crazy? He needs to get a deathbed conversion from him. This gives the film its ""uplifting ending"" because the professor dies--but as a Christian.

""God is Not Dead"" at least tries to tell a story, and has decent production values. Unfortunately that story itself is shallow, intolerant, dishonest and insulting to Christians and non-Christians alike.

Too many caricatures instead of believable characters. The acting, music by the newsboys, and production at least seemed competent and the premise was good. I wish they focused more on the actual argument for the plausible existence of God. That would've been something. The script was too all over the place. Things happening here, there, ""oh wait let's have the girlfriend dump him!"" Etc. etc. The classroom argument should've been center stage the whole time, more character development in the josh Wheaton character, and the professor should've been toned down a bit. Come on. Does anyone really believe a college professor would've said and done those things? I doubt it. I know they can be jerks but they went too far. Is it worth seeing? ... Eh, maybe. It wasn't awful.

What If? is totally predictable but has that happy ending...as well as John Ratzenberger as an angel...you can't go wrong with that!

Back to God's Not Dead: On the positive: There are a lot of good snippets of Christian apologetics in this film, some clearly straight from Ravi Zacharius and crew, which add some depth. I also thought the explanation of the comfortable ""cage"" given to Dean Cain's character to be very pointed. There are a lot of gems in here that are profound and helpful, if you can turn off your cynicism for a minute.

One other issue: I have mixed feelings about all the characters that were introduced. I was expecting a simple linear story about a kid and his professor. At times this was like watching some sort of Robert Altman ensemble film. God's Not Dead gets a little ham-fisted at times with some characters being a bit one-dimensional, but overall, it was a very interesting and enjoyable film.

PS Some people were upset by the depiction of the Muslim father. I did not feel he was overly one-dimensional and clearly loved his daughter while struggling with the rules of his religion. He was not all bad by any stretch of the imagination. I found what happened with that storyline to be very realistic.",1432857600,,1664,4.653061224489796

This movie was so popularized that I felt my curiosity get the best of me and checked this one out. For me, and this is my review, so...it's a good kind of Christian film. It deviated from its usual tell-tale of God's presence and existence. I believe the portrayal of atheists in here are symbolic. The professor who refuses to believe in the existence of an all-powerful entity are some parts of us that tend to forget about our beliefs from time to time because it is overshadowed by earthly things.

Contrary to what some have said, I did not at all think that the atheist professor was portrayed as evil, just deeply human whose reason for being so hostile toward faith in God becomes quite clear.  I did, however, find it hard to believe that a Christian woman would knowingly date an atheist, but perhaps she thought she could influence him and hopefully change his non-belief.  Also, that out of 80 kids in that class, there was only one believer who refused to write what the professor wanted.  Perhaps they were just unwilling to challenge him.  It was still a very good movie, the message being that God does indeed exist and as long as there is still breath in our bodies, it is never too late to repent and believe. But seeing as how life is fragile, and we don't know how long we have on this earth, it's best to profess that belief sooner rather than later.",1432598400,6,955,4.372881355932203

Despite pithy attempts at quoting scientists to ""prove"" God exists without engaging in any rational thought, this movie does do one thing abundantly well - it highlights how religion can divide people, break up relationships and ruin families.

I watched the film hoping to see an epic struggle of an underdog standing up for his faith despite reason, and the internal struggles and triumphs he overcame. Instead I got pithy quotes, stale stereotypes and biased cliches. The supporting characters are one-dimensional, added with the sole purpose to further the narrative that Christians are good and moral while the rest of the world is evil and out to get them.

6416504,3,B00KD5HFJG,"I have very mixed feelings about this movie. Many of my complaints and some of my compliments have already been noted, but I'll touch on just a few things.

On one hand, the movie shows (albeit exaggeratedly) the difficult environment religious individuals face when attending a large university. It also shows the sort of courage these situations require. I recently graduated from a very large university and staying true to what you believe is not easy, and is often frowned upon and scorned by academia and fellow students. I have experienced these things.

I, however, have several complaints and will raise three of them in this comment. First, the movie demonizes people who do not believe in Christianity and presents a very black and white view of humanity. How do you possibly expect more Muslims to explore Christianity when you portray them in that manner? Second, the ""conversion stories"" are overly simplistic and incredibly unrealistic. In some ways, this movie makes those who call themselves Christians look more unintelligent than ever, despite the fancy apologetics from the 18 year old with the cute girlfriend. Finally, the movie equates the new phenomenon of ""Evangelical Protestantism"" with ""Christianity."" This movement of rock-band-believing is not only historically unfounded, it also ignores 2000 years of Christian dogmatics, history, liturgics, and, ultimately, Truth.

In other words, watch with tempered expectations.",1432339200,2,1448,5.426666666666667

However, there are some very good points in the movie, and I do believe some seekers have been led to the Lord. As long as the gospel is preached, isn't that the most important thing, after all?

Then, in a moment of unexpected clarity, she speaks, ""Sometimes the devil allows people to live a life free of trouble because he doesn't want them turning to God. Their sin is like a jail cell, except it is all nice and comfy and there doesn't seem to be any reason to leave. The door's wide open.

If intelligible discussions about the validity of faith are desired, then pursue them through logical channels. Don't demonize a fictional movie because it appeals to a certain demographic. Watch http://youtu.be/XNDQj8QK8Zc and then criticize bright people discussing real issues. It's absolutely amazing that we have this dialogue. Even 30 years ago this would have been unheard of.

No atheist I've ever met would try to force their non-belief on anyone else.  This would be counter-productive.  Our entire stance is, question, study, research, learn and make your decision...or not.  I've also worked in many post-secondary educational institutions and I can't imagine any professor outright telling students what to believe.  Again, that's counter to 'education'.  They may ask them to question their beliefs, defend their beliefs and the professor would grade them on the soundness of their research, writing style etc., but would never attack a student's personal beliefs.  Christians commonly perpetuate this fallacy of the 'angry atheist,' when we tend to be quite the opposite.  I'm much more likely to laugh at the nonsensical mental acrobatics christians perform in order to preserve their beliefs.  After the laughter though...it's really quite sad.

6416579,5,B00KD5HFJG,"My family and I loved this movie. Unlike what I've read from other reviews, it portrays a real issue with people in general.

6416580,1,B00KD5HFJG,"I have never written a movie review in my life but I was so offended by this movie I felt compelled to say something. I actually went into the movie excited to see a genuine debate about God vs Science. I knew there would of course be some Christian bias as there would be an atheist bias if the movie was made by atheists. However, what this movie turned out to be was a hypocritical piece of propaganda. I will give the movie some credit for bringing up a few intelligent points for the case for god but not enough to redeem it even a little.

If you are a Christian and are OK with this movie then I suggest you re-watch it after reading this review. I will try not to be overly negative but it will be hard for me.

1st) Every character in this movie that was not Christian was either portrayed as an idiot (the reporter), a terrible person (the boyfriend), an abusive father (the Muslim), or a God hater (the atheist professor).

2nd) The atheists professor was apparently only atheist because he was hurt over his mothers death and blamed God. While I will admit this is probably the case for some atheists it is not the majority. Further, being atheist does not mean you hate Christianity or would ever require students to sign an agreement that ""God is dead."" Not to mention this character is hit by a car at which point the Pastor in the movie runs to him telling him this is his last chance to accept Jesus as his lord and Savior.

3rd) the LONE Muslim man in the movie is a control freak dad who ends up slapping around his daughter when he finds out she is listening to the bible on tape. I know plenty of Muslims that are very accepting people and this portrayal only enforces stereotypes that are often wildly inaccurate.

4th) The movie makes a point that without God nothing matters and you can't have morals and everything is permissible. It further implies that without God there is no way to have hope in life. This notion is extremely ignorant and one that any logical Christian would reject.

5th) The movie ends with a list of court cases proclaiming them as examples of this type of situation, but fails to give any detailed information. I expect that upon further investigation of these cases I will find them to be very very different. I will write in later once i research them.

Overall, the movie is offensive to anyone thats not Christian and should be offensive to those Christians who have valid arguments for their faith. I do not wish to belittle anyones faith and do believe logical and intelligent discussions can be had without degrading one another. I am not an angry person and very rarely get worked up but by the end of this movie I was almost in tears at how offended and upset I was. Again, this is very uncharacteristic of me. I am not some but hurt atheist in fact I am not really sure what I believe at this point in time but I can guarantee you this movie only made me angry at the Christians who made it and participated in its production. Growing up in a church I have met many intelligent and insightful Christians who I love dearly. This movie was so disgusting in its execution that I almost asked the theater for a refund.",1431216000,6,3174,4.3969335604770015

6416582,2,B00KD5HFJG,"There were some good chuckles in this movie. Like the freshman girlfriend who so quickly dumps Josh because he (also a freshman) might be ruining their futures by taking a stance in a Philosophy class. Who knew that college 101 classes were so critical? (""My mother was right about you,"" she said, I kid you not.)  Who knew that a college professor had the power to see to it that this freshman never became a lawyer? Of course, this, this same idiot also stated, when he was being dumped, ""I won't allow it"". Really, this clown was totally over the top.

That crucial moment in the heat of the debate when the professor declared why he hated God was really compelling. Oops. Did you hear that? He said he hated the thing he swore he didn't believe in. I didn't see that coming, did you? What an ironic twist! How profound!

The Muslim student's story line was as sophisticated as that ""crucial moment"". And highly insulting, too. I wish she had been the main character and she stuck to the ""God is not dead"" conclusion without converting to Christianity. I also wish some of the classmates kept their butts in their seats and declared nothing but maybe applauded the others for standing up to the idiot professor, thus showing their disapproval for his bullying tactics.

Unbelievers are not like this. Sure there are bad apples everywhere (including Christianity). If kids watch this they are being mislead. The majority of people are not like this movie portrays them.

6416602,2,B00KD5HFJG,"Okay, so ... I watched this twice.  I only got about 15 minutes in the first time, as I found the caricatures of campus life and atheists very unrepresentative of reality... as if the scriptwriter(s?) had never been to a campus or met an agnostic or atheist.

Me, I'm, I guess you could say, a-religious... the only thing I KNOW is that I don't know.  The math and science that's been chiseled steadily out of consistent and critical observation of the universe around us is very reliable and I appreciate it... but, it doesn't DISPROVE a god figure... it just disproves a lot of bronze age assertions given to help people through a time of much less knowledge.  If there's a god... cool!  It doesn't bother me.  If this movie had been simply an exploration of christian beliefs, it wouldn't have bothered me.

What bothered me was the atrocious mischaracterization of pretty much every character in the movie who wasn't either already a devout christian or secretly/unknowingly waiting to become one.  Callous.  Selfish.  Sociopathic.  Cruel.  I'm sorry, but I know people who ARE like that who attend church every wednesday and sunday with a straight face.  Simultaneously, I know folk who take disbelief to the extreme of believing there is NOT a god (which, to my mind, is just as much a religion as believing there is... as an assertive and often evangelical act rather than a 'meh, I dunno, how's about a coffee?' kinda thing like agnosticism) who are kind, giving, regularly inconvenience themselves for the sake of those who never even notice... who feel that their moral compass is actually rather easily defined (do as little harm as possible)... and yet other folk for whom you can flip both around just as easily.

Instead this movie was just stereotypes taken to absurdity, with some nice music, and nice sentiments thrown in, carefully selected nitpicks of scientific discourse (minus actual data, of course, as if science were nothing but philosophical debates among nerds), and a list of cases in the credits that avoided mentioning, in every single example, what STARTED the cases with the mere initial mention that they were all 'condemnation' of christians on campuses.  Read a few, though, and you quickly find out that the 'condemned' in most of these cases were either passively or assertively forcing their beliefs on others, often while on a job they sought/agreed to take that had nondiscrimination clauses right up front that they violated.  Keeping your religion in your home, with your church, and your family, etc... is wonderful, and just what the freedom of religion is there to protect... but freedom of religion is for all religions and FROM all religions.  But in many of the cases listed, the 'condemned' where simply prevented from condemning others.  Most had active clubs on campus before hand and continued afterware, unabated... hardly a condemnation.  So, yeah... I guess the martyr complex was stretched beyond suspension of disbelief as well.

Have your religion.  Enjoy your religion.  Believe.  Be inviting.  Talk.  But don't call yourself oppressed or condemned for simply having to respect others' freedoms NOT to participate in or be harmed by your religion, whatever it may be (atheism included.)  This movie failed in this respect... so while I appreciated some of the efforts... the highly selective cut-and-paste citations paired with characters unrecognizable as being human... didn't work for me.

Religious people have a tendency to think that since they spend so much time testifying, proclaiming, praising, witnessing, evangelizing and professing their faith, that non-religious must walk around doing the inverse.  Someone asked me once, if I wasn't going to raise my children Christian, would I stand up to actively renounce Jesus.  Uh, no, it hadn't occurred to me to be so dramatic.  I am just focusing my time and effort on other good and worthwhile pursuits and I will leave the renouncing and pronouncing to others who are so inclined.  I did see the Facebook story about a U.S. Marine inexplicably attending a college course in France and the French Professor of Philosophy insists there is no God so the Marine punches him and knocks him down, unconscious, as proof of God's existence.

6416616,2,B00KD5HFJG,"Horrible! This is an unrealistic, wolfish diatribe in sheep's clothing that reinforces the beliefs of those who belong to that odd brand of American Christianity, evangelicals who believe that the world constantly conspires against them to strip away their beliefs and that the secular 'University' is the prime agent of this demon plot.  It's consists of a series of ""straw man arguments"", presented at a fictitious university and constructed to portray the academic atagonists as carnivores of traditon. These caricatures are so hugely improbable and thinly intelligible that they almost debunk themselves without the film's input. For example, no professor would confront a classroom with such hostility toward free thought and inquiry---but that's the running caricature used for the flawed antagonists in the film...they're almost so bad, so thoughtless and rude that they're funny. The only smart, ""normal"" people at this college are the Christian sojourners. It's even revealed that the atheist professor apparently didn't come by his disbelief naturally but has an agonizing childhood back story that caused him to reject ""God"". This presupposes that his personal beliefs are a ""vitamin-like"" deficiency rather than a journey of healthy discovery and the joyous  sense of liberation that accompanies release from the often oppressive dogmas of religion. The film even inserts a materialistic, non-caring executive...and an evil, daughter-abusing Muslim father who harshly demands that his kid toe the line.
It's a laugh a minute but it insults the serious subject that it claims to treat...which left me at times mildly angry.

6416664,2,B00KD5HFJG,"Before I tear into this movie, it's important to note that as an athiest, I do NOT have an inherent bias against this movie or its agenda.  While I went into this movie knowing that there was absolutely no argument it could make that could refute the theories and findings of the greatest scientific minds humanity has ever known, my interest was still piqued by the premise.  Also, regardless of what this movie or even radical religious fanatics might tell you, I can happily coexist with people of faith.  Despite the many insulting failings of this movie, it did get 5 words right: your faith is your choice.  What you believe is your business, just as what I believe is mine.  Just don't impose it on my life.

To say that this movie was the most offensive thing I've ever seen might be a bit dramatic, but I would be lying if I didn't take offense to several things this movie presented.  The blatant implication that all athiests are evil, bloodthirsty douchebags is the most insulting of them all.  Kevin Sorbo plays a caricature of an athiest that would not exist in any real world university.  No establishment would maintain employment of anyone that disrespectful, despite what this movie wants you to believe.  Just because it was his classroom doesn't mean he had some kind of authority to rule what his students were allowed to believe.  It's just plain ridiculous.  The girl blogger character is the same way.  She might as well just be a caricature - whoever wrote her character has probably only had exposure to ""liberals"" via what they read on the internet or what they hear from hardline conservative media.  It's comically unrealistic.  It was a nice touch to make sure they portrayed literally nothing good happening in her life.  Is that god's will?  To be petty and mean spirited to vegetarians?

Josh's argument was embarrassing.  When being tasked to prove the existence of god, he simply quotes a few sentences from theist scientists, responds to the professor's quotes with another quote, then asks a few philosophical questions about the origins of the universe or the origins of life.  Uh - you can't answer questions with more questions and call it a worthy argument.  He didn't prove or disprove anything, he dressed an opinion up in a way to make it seem like it was a fact.  No matter how hard you try, you can never prove the existence of god in the realm of Science or logic without providing REAL evidence, not feelings or faith.  His argument was no better than me saying ""yeah well, I read a book where there were dragons and just because you haven't seen dragons before doesn't mean you can't DISPROVE that dragons exist!""  I also find it outrageously insulting that the movie tells us that morality can't exist without god.  That might be the absolute dumbest concept I've ever heard in my life, which I do not fault exclusively to the movie because it is a VERY popular opinion among Christians.  If you disagree, there's probably little I can say to change your mind but the implication that you require some reward in the end for being a good person is absolutely the most childish belief you can hold.  Why must a God exist for you to have morality?  Why are you attributing human emotions and decisions to a higher power?  Why can't I want to be a good person just because it's the right thing to do?  ""Treat others the way you want to be treated"" (or the golden rule) predates the Bible.  If you don't feel satisfaction from doing the right thing then I'm pretty sure there's something wrong with you... and maybe you should go ahead and continue clinging to faith because without that, you might actually be an uncontrollable psychopath.

With that, I ask this: Who was this movie made for?  If this was intended for people who were on the fence about their faith, it's safe to say that they made no compelling arguments that would push anyone other than uneducated teenagers towards the Bible.  If it was to try to teach atheists some kind of lesson, they most certainly failed.  If it wasn't option A or B, then was this movie made specifically for Christians?  Have the filmmakers never heard the phrase ""preaching to the choir""?  It feels pretty irresponsible to push this movie on established Christians, as it only perpetuates ridiculous stereotypes of atheists that a lot of Christians probably already have.  It's not a stretch to think that many people will see this movie and automatically assume that every atheist has nothing better to do than attack your faith or try to deny your children their education simply because they believe in god.  There are enough media outlets with very specific agendas that paint this picture of atheists as liberal, god-hating murderers who want to strip you of ALL freedoms and want to force your good Christian children to believe in the devil's theory of evolution or whatever hot button issue there is this week to people who refuse to think for themselves.

I'm not suggesting that people of faith are close minded, but this movie drives home a lot of ridiculous concepts that don't help any arguments against the idea that religion puts you in a prison of belief.  Don't think for yourself or disagree with other Christians' morals on your blog or else you'll get cancer.  Don't question your faith or god will strike you down with a car.  Stand up against your psychotic, abusive Muslim father over your love of Jesus (despite whether you may or may not end up the victim of an honor killing).  I really don't know what world the filmmakers live in, but I'd be interested to see things through their eyes for a day.

Now, I didn't give the movie just one star because there were admirable attempts to make something coherent.  Kevin Sorbo did a pretty good job at playing a maniac, despite how unrealistic the role itself was.  I didn't completely hate the subplot involving the pastor's string of bad luck.  The movie probably would have been far more interesting if it were instead about this pastor questioning his faith after feeling like his life and service to god had no meaning, but instead they felt it would be better to focus on something way dumber.  Also, I laughed every time there was a scene with the liberal blogger taking cheap shots in her interviews with the Duck Dynasty guy and the Newsboys (or every scene with the professor acting incredibly condescending towards Josh).  I appreciate the filmmakers sending the message that Christians are perfect, harmonious people who will never lose their cool when they're being verbally insulted or harassed.  I'm sorry, but the only way I would have found that realistic is if the movie were instead about Mormons.  The very fact that they made this movie only proves how much contempt they have for non-Christians.

As a side note, I haven't taken the time to look up the references during the credits of the ""real world"" cases of schools attacking faith, but I'd be willing to bet that several of them were probably lawsuits over teaching evolution in the classroom.  It's disappointing that we even have to have these discussions.  Ever hear of separation of church and state?  Why is Christianity so special?  What about the Torah or the Quran?  Shouldn't they get equal attention if you're going to desecrate the work of legitimate thinkers in the realm of science and introduce FAITH to the classroom?  This is one of those movies that makes you so angry at its intentions that you can't help but also get angry over the real world situations it brings to mind.  This film reminded me of last year's debate between Ken Ham and Bill Nye (which I have to add was pretty painful to watch).  Ken Ham had no right to even be on the same stage as Bill Nye, and his laughable attempts at debating with him proved that.  Yet, the completely ignorant audience gathered there in my home state of Kentucky were clearly in favor of Mr. Ham, despite the fact that he proved nothing and could only do what others do when debating with real scientists: misdirect.  The filmmakers had to have taken inspiration from that appalling event, because I got the impression that this was round two.

TL;DR

If you have any self respect, don't watch this movie.  If you're looking for one of those ""so bad that it's funny"" type of movies, don't bother.  The groans far outweigh the laughs.  If you're a Christian living in a perfect little bubble and want a movie to satisfy your established beliefs that all atheists are mean spirited jerks who are out to get you and re-crucify Jesus or whatever, then this movie is probably for you.  However, why even watch this movie?  I wouldn't need to waste two hours of my life to get beat over the head with a bigoted message I already agree with.",1430524800,,8737,4.683934426229508

6416666,2,B00KD5HFJG,"First off I an agnostic atheist.  That means while I do not believe Jesus was the ""son"" of God, I don't claim to know the ""truth"".  But despite our country's odd fear of talking directly about sex or religion, I was intrigued by a plot premise exploring a deep discussion about why a believer and a non-believer believe what they do.  Instead if quickly devolves into a silly story to do two things: make the belligerent Christian types feel justified and to paint the non-faithful as evil, angry and selfish.

A teacher posing a difficult statement and forcing kids to just sign off on it is silly and never happens.  Now if the teacher submits that question in a philosophy class, than fine, because it is a good discussion and whatever philosophical bent you have would lead to many evocative and interesting papers which I would enjoy reading.  But no, instead its that a obviously former Christian man lost a loved on and hates God for it, which becomes the crux of the argument of the sole student who denies the teachers classwide question/statement that god is dead. The teacher, when eventually at death's door accepts Jesus back into his heart and all is well.

The rest of the movie is essentially a bunch of Pat Robertson rantings and ravings of lessons either to shame those of us who are not part of the flock or vindicate the poor victimized Christians of this country.  All the non-Christians and Atheists are evil, dastardly, hate Christians and mock them, The ""message"" of the movie is stand up for your faith in Jesus against the non-believers, and they will either eventually see the light or realize their Godless lives are empty and lacking.  But as a good evangelical, only good things will befall your courage to stand up against the War on God.

While a tortured watch and utterly silly in it's representation, it did help me to understand how all these Fox News religious zealot types feel.  I think they would watch this movie and say it's exactly how the world is.  All Liberals and teachers and Atheists are just out to get them and force them to be heathens, when in reality they just want religions of all kinds kept out of politics, the justice system and public education where their influence always ends up making the world a more dangerous place.  This movies should be remade with the teacher posing the same statement and then having the students debate the merits of each side, especially if its the OPPOSITE of what they believe and for side stories show how both an obedient Christian and rigid Atheist have mostly the same goals, happiness, financial security and a safe place to raise their children. If believers would like non-believers to quit rolling their eyes at these types of movies, start making movies that involve Jesus, not propaganda that is so heavy handed it drips with absurdity.",1430524800,2,2838,4.720647773279352

6416672,1,B00KD5HFJG,"Gods (not) Dead
I really like movies that ask me to think, but I really love movies that make me think.  Gods (not) Dead is neither.  It wants to be.  It pretends to be.  What it is, is the result of some believers who have absolutely no understanding of science trying to use science to make a point that God is real.  The attempt fails on every level.  It is an annoying tapestry of clichs, stereotypes and Christian memes that fails to deliver on any level.
Suffice it to say believers are put upon, assaulted, you know, persecuted because thats the way they roll.  Non-believers, of course, are villainous, angry, hostile, blah blah blah.  So heres the movie in a nutshell- believer signs up for philosophy class, philosophy professor is a hostile atheist, therefore he must be a non-believer.  Just for kicks they throw in a Muslim student who secretly wants to be a Christian even though her hostile daddy makes her wear her hijab to school which she removes the minute his car pulls away.  I guess Honor they Father and Mother doesnt count if you're a Christian.  Yawn.  This story arc is entirely clich -  daddy finds out daughter wants to be a Christian and he beats her the way all Muslim daddies beat their Jesus loving daughters.  Sigh.
First day of class and Professor Hostile Atheist wants his class to dispense with any notion of God by signing a paper that says God Does Not Exist.  Our believing hero won't sign it so Professor Hostile Atheist, a Philosopher (who, by the way treats his Christian fianc like black help in 1960s Alabama much to the glee of his fellow atheist professors during an awkward dinner party) makes him prove his claim.  That God is not dead.  My alarm bells went off then.  A philosophy professor asking a student to prove a negative?  It doesnt make sense.
The writers thought they were clever.  They were not.  They may have impressed a bunch of run-of-the-mill conservatives who have never opened a science text but they will not have impressed anyone with even a high school science education.  For instance  the argument that the big bang itself is proof of God is based on an argument ex nihilo  out of nothing  that since science believed that the universe was static and the earth its center for thousands of years shows that science is wrong because suddenly we now know there was a big bang in which the universe arises from nothing therefore a creator is required.  Not so fast sparky.  Anyone who actually studies physics will not agree with the statement that the big bang is an event in which everything came from nothing, therefore was created.  There is no such thing as nothing in physics.  Even a vacuum has energy known as vacuum energy.  And while science can prove a big bang happened and that the universe is expanding it has not proved that before the big bang there was nothing.
This movie is like spiritual rape.  It pretends to be what it is not.  It is offensive on every level.  Even the damned writers were too lazy to actually care if they were accurate.  For example, Josh is told to look up Matthew 10:32-33.  When he reads Matthew 10:32-33 the Bible he is reading from is turned to a page in Luke.  Seriously?  Its just a detail.  Who cares, right?  How hard is it to show the right page from the passage thats being read?  Oh, right, they don't give a damn about the audience experience.  Its Christian porn, an evangelical wet dream and its intellectually dishonest.  Had I spent money to purchase this film I would be demanding my money back.  I felt dirty afterwards.  Dont waste your time on this garbage.  Reality is way more interesting and its free.  .  God Is Dead is trash, a waste of time, 113 minutes you cannot get back.  The producers of this film should be fed to the lions along with the cast and crew.
There is another movie called The Man From Earth.  It too is a conversation amongst educators involving spiritual belief.  It is glorious, it is moving and it makes you think.  Its also a damn good story.  Rent that, not this, and you will be entertained in a mindful, spiritual way.  Watch God is Dead and you will feel used.",1430438400,8,4121,4.536054421768707

6416688,1,B00KD5HFJG,"Wow. As a Catholic/Christian, I turned this on because it had four stars, and a four star movie on Amazon has never steered me wrong. This is the reason why I'm writing this review to lower the stars to save others from making the same mistake I did. I actually turned it off half way through because it is such a laughably predictable movie. After turning it off, I went to IMDB and saw how many 1 stars it received. Additionally, all of the predictable plot lines that I assumed would happen, did happen according to reviews on IMDB.

What makes me sad is that there are so many Christians blinded by such blatent propaganda. Being Christian is so much more than what this movie simply portrays. Not all atheists are vegetarian God haters. Not all Muslims are abusive. And not all Christian struggles are as simplistic as the ones portrayed in this ""after school special"" of a movie.

I used to thing ""From Justin To Kelly"" was the worst movie I've ever seen. Not any more. This is truly the worst movie I've ever seen. If you want to see a good Christian movie...one that actually makes you think without shoving horrible stereotypes and propaganda down your throat while seeing poor acting and producing, watch something else. Anything else. (Amistad, Shawshank, Star Wars, CS Lewis movies, The passion of the Christ, etc. etc. etc. etc.)",1430352000,,1342,4.682203389830509

6416690,2,B00KD5HFJG,"I am a devout highly conservative Christian. I believe the Bible is God's Word, and I live by it. I'm annoyed by liberals, atheists, etc..

HOWEVER....i also enjoy films (all sorts) and this movie was just so over the top that I think it actually hurts people that try to spread the Christian faith. The overall message I agreed with - that being that there really is a problem with atheists not just being happy to be non-believers, but forcing others to believe the same thing. As the film points out - God gives man free will to think as he chooses. So the overall message, I agreed with. I thought interplay between the debate of whether God exists or not was well done too.

But it was the characters making the point - that I had a huge problem with. They were written so LOUD and OVER THE TOP - it was ridiculous. It was almost cartoonish and so dumbed down that you'd think it was a movie targeted at 5 year olds.

Dean Cain's character just dumps his hot girlfriend after she tells him she has cancer? Seriously? I know lot of jerky guys, but I cant think of anyone that would do that. That was pointless. You don't need to throw in stuff like that to have the audience get a feel for the character. We already got it. He's a scumbag.

The Muslim dad beating the crap out of his daughter. Ok fine no doubt this happens but I don't see the point. If you are going to show him kicking her out of the house for being a Christian, why not just go full ISIS mode and have him chop her head off too.

Liberal blogger that tries to ambush conservatives like the Robertsons? Ok that is probably on point but the actress was way too hot playing her. Most of these people that do this are ugly girls or skinny jeans wearing feminine men (think the Obama guy trying to sell health insurance).

The Professor was a good actor but again the volume was turned way up on him too. He needed to be played in a more subtle intellectual way. And his conversion should have been gradual - not just all the sudden.

The blonde girlfriend of the main character - super hot. But she was also super dumb. Are we really to believe that this girl would dump her boyfriend (who she'd been dating for 6 years) because she was afraid he might get a C in the philosophy class for taking the challenge? Really? She was worried he might not get into law school because he got a C in a freshmen class? And she dumped him over it? Ridiculous.

The main character- i thought he was the most well developed in the entire movie because he wasn't portrayed so over the top. But everyone else around him was - they were practically caricatures - and that was the entire issue.

Pretty well made movie. Good enough acting, not great. Premise of the film was good. But the characters were awful. Its not the worst movie ever made, but it reminded me of a dumbed down Michael Moore type film that hates on everything conservative. Only this was hating on atheism and liberals.

To put it simply, I wish that they had spent more time on the debate inside of the classroom as opposed to focusing on several of the periphery characters which, while interesting, lacked relevance to the central storyline of the film itself.

As a Christian who really enjoys apologetics, it's sort of an answer to prayers in that I do worry of professors trying to intellectually bully people out of their faith. Perhaps many students will use this movie as another source of encouragement and strength if somebody challenges their faith.

A university professor meets his match in an uneducated freshman believer who gets to the root of his instructor's hatred towards God. The drama begins in a Philosophy class with a jury of students versus the beliefs of their instructor. One student must present evidence that God actually exists. It is a chilling story of the role God plays in several peoples' lives. With cameo appearances by Willie ""The Duck General"" Robertson and the widely known Christian music group, Newsboys, this movie is a must-see for both believers and unbelievers alike.

6416709,3,B00KD5HFJG,"After reading the reviews and the write up on this DVD, I was looking forward to watching it.  While it was a good enough movie, I finished watching it somewhat disappointed.

The professor was actually the most believable member of the cast for me (I've taken classes from professors like this), which was why the ending felt so Twilight Zonish.  I found the kid's defense of God to be a little on the weak side, too.  Not what I was hoping for.

I grew up in a Christian household, and I am a professor at two colleges, one of which is a Catholic college, and the premise of this film is beyond believable. No collge professor in any school would make a student vow that ""God is dead."" It doesn't matter if it is a pholosphy professor or not. It just wouldn't happen, and if a professor did this, he would be called into the chair or dean of his department. This is propaganda pure and simple, designed to attack those who are not of the Christian faith. It is very disheartening. But, I can see where certain people would enjoy it.

6416712,3,B00KD5HFJG,"I was surprised to see Mr. and Mrs. Willie Robertson in this movie, knowing that they're a member of the Lords Church and giving credit for something that's totally a false doctrine as being portrayed in this movie . that of faith only which is  unscriptural . Even toward the end has one of the main characters asking god into his life while on his death bed. This seems to be the theme of most modern day portrayals of Christianity coming from that Joel Osteen mindset and all others who follow that religious misguided way. The Bible clearly lays out what to do to become a Christian the whole book of Acts is filled with conversions none of which have anybody asking or praying that God comes into their life.  First, we must hear the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  The Bible teaches that ""faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God"" (Romans 10:17).  One is not a Christian because his parents are.  Just as sin is not inherited, neither is faith (Ezekiel 18:20).  Each person must believe in Jesus Christ for himself.  Christianity is a religion of teaching (Matthew 28:19,20.  Unless one has heard the Gospel and learned that Jesus Christ died for our sins, was buried, and arose from the dead, he cannot be saved (1 Corinthians 15:1-4).  The apostle Paul wrote: ""How shall they call Him in whom they have not believed?  And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard?
And how shall they hear without a preacher"" (Romans 10:14)?  One must first hear and understand the Gospel before he can believe it.
Believe
Second, one must believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God (Matthew 16:16).  Jesus said: ""I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins"" (John 8:24).  The jailor at Philippi asked Paul and Silas, ""Sirs, what must I do to be saved?  And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house."" (Acts 16:30,31).  Jesus also said: ""He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned"" (Mark 16:16).  One comes to believe in Jesus Christ when he hears the Word of God (Romans 10:17).  This is the reason it is so important that the Gospel be preached to the whole world (Mark 16:15).
Repent
Third, one must repent of his sins in order to be saved (Acts 17:30,31).  Jesus commanded that ""repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem"" (Luke 24:47).  Repentance is a result of being sorry for one's sins (2 Corinthians 7:10).  When the Jews on Pentecost Day learned from Peter that they had crucified the Son of God, they ""were pricked in their heart"" (Acts 2:37).  They wanted to be forgiven of their sins, so they asked, ""What shall we do?""  They were told to ""Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost"" (Acts 2:37,38).  When one repents, he turns away from his sin (1 Thessalonians 1:9).  He shows he has repented by doing good works (Matthew 3:8).
Confess
Fourth, one must confess that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God (Matthew 16:16).  This great truth is the very foundation upon which the church of Christ is built (Matthew 16:18; Acts 4:11,12; 1 Corinthians 3:11).  Jesus said that we must be willing to confess Him before men if we want Him to confess us before the Father (Matthew 10:32,33).  The apostle Paul wrote: ""But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; 9. That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 10. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."" (Romans 10:8-10).  When Philip preached Jesus to the Ethiopian eunuch, the eunuch responded, ""See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?""  Philip told him he could be baptized if he believed.  The eunuch then confessed, ""I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God"" (Acts 8:35-38).  We must make this important, yet simple confession also in order to be saved.
Be Baptized
Fifth, one must be baptized in order to be saved.  Jesus said: ""He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved;"" (Mark 16:16).  Please note that baptism follows belief.  One who does not believe that Gospel cannot be truly baptized.  Therefore, babies cannot be baptized for they are too young to (1) have sin, (2) hear the Gospel, (3) repent of sins, and (4) confess that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.  Baptism also follows repentance.  On Pentecost Day, Peter told those who asked what to do to be saved to ""Repent, and let every one of you be baptized..."" (Acts 2:38).  One cannot be truly baptized who has not truly repented.
Baptism is a burial in water (Romans 6:3,4; Colossians 2:12).  Therefore, sprinkling or pouring are not proper baptism.  Baptism is in order to be saved (Mark 16:16; 1 Peter 3:21).  One is not saved before he is baptized!  Baptism is ""for the remission (forgiveness) of sins"" (Acts 2:38).  Just as Jesus shed His blood for the remission of sins (Matthew 26:28), so we are baptized in order to receive the remission of sins.  In baptism, the sinner's sins are washed away by the blood of Jesus (Acts 22:16; Revelation 1:5).  The Bible also clearly states that God only saves them that obey him Heb 5-8 Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;9 And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;",1430179200,,5683,4.5284313725490195
6416713,1,B00KD5HFJG,"If this movie at least tried to play it off as if it was going to seriously deal with this issue, I think it would have been OK.  The problem lies in the fact that it stages situations that would never happen as shown simply to make someone feel as if they're justified.  Case in point:  In one scene, the student and teacher are debating and there's a fairly ""good"" back and forth.  All of a sudden, the student makes some point that's supposed to stop the professor in his tracks but, in reality, has a very, very simple rebuttal.  The professor just stands there, unable to answer, as if he's just been stumped by an argument that is easily refuted with 5 seconds of time and the internet.  I think Christians and non-Christians are smarter than this.  You don't set up the situation to where there's an easy answer but stop short of it simply because that answer doesn't support the narrative.  If the creators of this movie really felt like they were justified in their positions in this film, they wouldn't have to be deceitful in order to assert those positions.  It's like someone correcting a grammar mistake that someone has allegedly made only to have that person respond by sticking his/her tongue out and saying ""You're a stupid-head!"" instead of pointing out that there is no mistake and that the person making the correction is mistaken.",1430179200,10,1352,4.623430962343096

The movie shows you a little of the lives of a few choice students on campus. Not everybody just a few. And while not everyone's circumstances are as dramatic as the ones they show they were meant to be the select few people they follow in the movie. And I believe there are people with those circumstances in real life maybe even on the same campus,  but we just don't see that. My impression of the bad reviews was people didn't like this facet of the movie. I though the gospel could have been more clearly presented. To me it was very vague especially when the minnister was speaking to the professor as he lay in the street. I am a believer, however if I was an unbeliever I wouldn't have been able to understand at all what he was trying to get across had I not the knowledge I have as a believer.

6416734,5,B00KD5HFJG,Wonderful film that accurately handles the truths of God's word in a manner that lays to rest the wrong concepts that attack the Christian faith.,1430006400,2,145,4.84
6416735,2,B00KD5HFJG,"My overall impression was that this movie had its heart in the right place--and as a Christian writer (albeit non-professional), I understand what the authors of the movie were trying to do.  I cannot say I regret seeing it, because it did make me think, even if sometimes that thinking was awareness of its flaws.  Contrary to what some commenters have suggested, there *are* cases where professors push their ideology on students, and Christians *will* find their faith challenged by situations and individuals who are hostile to it.  For making you think about what you will do if you are challenged, I do give this movie credit.  Additionally some of the arguments, particularly that of Dostoyevsky (similarly expressed by C.S. Lewis in Mere Christianity), were valid.

I am also not as ""down"" on the portrayal of the Muslim family in this movie as some people seem to be.  Unfortunately this sort of thing *does* happen, or worse, particularly outside of the US.  I think that we make a mistake to deny that.  And yes, it happens *whenever* extremism threatens, not just in Islam.  But if the point was to create a demon here, then I must say they missed.  Why draw the clear parallel between the father's speech about standing firm in one's beliefs and who one is, and Josh's defiance of Professor Radisson?  I couldn't help thinking that at least on the question of God's *existence,* even though not in terms of *who God truly is,* the two of them were on the same side.  And after what *was* a scene portraying a despicable, abusive outburst, we do see repercussions not just for the abused young woman, but for the male members of the family.  This does not make the act *excusable* in any form or fashion (and indeed I think he and all other abusers should serve time behind bars for it), but leaves open the possibility of learning from and seeking forgiveness for such actions, which can sometimes come in the process of serving one's sentence.  Still, the one suggestion I would have made to the movie writers would have been to avoid the act of violence altogether and simply have her be told to pack her bags.  That, I think, would have removed the dissonance between the idea that perhaps we should sympathize with the father, and the fact that he crossed the line into something that cannot ever be condoned under any circumstances.

Unfortunately I think that a good premise suffers in most cases from three problems I see in Christian movies, though granted Hollywood has just as much fault for resorting to these sorts of shorthands and often on the other side.  Unfortunately the stakes are quite a bit higher when it is a matter of faith:

1)  Unrealistic situations:  As I pointed out before, academic bias against religion and Christianity in particular does in fact exist on college campuses and students should be mindful of the possibility.  However, the sort of behavior Professor Radisson (sp?) demonstrates is severe enough that at the least, an academic institution made aware of this extreme form of coercion would have to be concerned about its reputation if nothing else.  Out of 80 students in that class, somebody would be apt to pull out their cell phone and record Radisson's bile and upload it to YouTube.  (Added to that, the moment that Radisson laid a hand on Josh, that was technically assault and battery and grounds for legal as well as academic sanction against )

Conversely, Josh's argument in God's favor, which until that point had been going pretty well in my opinion, culminated in an ad hominem attack.  That was a fatal mistake.  No matter how much it was *true* that Radisson hated God, this is neither acceptable as a Christian to belittle and humiliate someone in revenge, nor would Radisson have been required to take that; Josh would have rightfully been censured if not expelled not for his faith, but for personal attacks.  ""The real thing,"" when it comes to academic bias and coercion, is more subtle than this, given that both sides generally recognize where the line is at which all moral high ground is gone.  We as Christians are, in a verse that seems little known, to *gently* instruct those who are opposed to the truth.  When people are angry, when they are feeling legitimately defensive, they will not change their minds--they will perceive themselves rightfully as *under attack.*  It is a common misconception that because of the idea that the Gospel is an offense to those outside the faith and that we must not be ashamed of it, that it means we have the right to go *on the offensive* and attack anyone who gets in our way and dares to disagree with us.  That could not be further from the truth.  Other than literally defending ourselves and our loved ones against physical attack (and even then, there are those called NOT to undertake such a defense and to be martyrs in the Christian sense, which I will point out is a *peaceful* sense), we are not to act in this manner or we give the impression that God does *not* in fact respect the free will that this movie rightly holds up as central to God's very love for us and the love that He wishes for us to have for Him (for love *by its nature* cannot be in any way coerced).

2)  Easy predictability and coincidence:  Aside from one incident (which I will address below), very little surprised me, sometimes because of characters playing to the obvious stereotype (the selfish rich man, the shallow liberal reporter, even the young man from China's eventual decision, as examples not discussed above), and often the extreme predictability and coincidences was used as evidence of God's working.  I realize that due to the limits of the medium, some of this is required as ""shorthand"" for the viewer, but at least in my experience, aside from occasional extraordinary events, God's workings and God's patterns are often much more subtle and sometimes, we either realize how it all added up days, months or years after the fact, or we are never privileged with seeing the impact of our words or actions at all in this life.  That does not make God's existence *and intervention* in the world any less valid.  But as the movie does correctly point out, *free will* is paramount, and as such, we will not have everything easily and obviously handed to us (though again, once in a while we might), and we will have to go through those periods St. John of the Cross famously named ""the dark night of the soul,"" in which God is very much alive but not making Himself *obvious.*

3)  Pat answers / easy salve in the face of tragedy: I recently entered a care ministry in my church, and one of the first things we were provided was solidly-researched Christian material on how to minister to those who are suffering--and unfortunately easy solutions and quoting Bible verses at someone to make them get rid of emotions and reactions that make you uncomfortable is *for a Christian* exactly the wrong thing to do.  We are not to ""sing songs to a heavy heart,"" as the Psalm says, for that is indeed like pouring vinegar on the wound.  We are rather to *show* them what Christian care is by our humble actions and our love.  Imagine how differently things might have gone if Josh had demonstrated fully what it was to *love his enemy,* instead of attacking him.

Imagine if he had reacted with true sympathy and, even if Radisson's likely answer to this would have been ""no,"" Josh had askedhim upon finding out about his loss, if there was anything that he could do...any sort of response that would acknowledge that Radisson's pain was *real,* and not somehow morally *wrong* to have.  The funny thing is...God is actually one for total honesty.  He would much rather be yelled at, raged at, wrestled with than turned away from.  That might be the one suggestion I would have made to Radisson in that moment: that if anyone told him being angry, struggling with doubts, and *grieving as is natural* was somehow immoral and un-Christian, that they were wrong to have belittled what he was feeling.  This world does hurt, and ignoring or covering up the pain is *not* what God is actually asking us to do.  And NEVER should Josh have used that pain as a weapon against him, especially in front of anybody.  Given that...I cannot believe that the ending of the movie would have played out as we saw it happen, with the example that Josh provided not through his rational arguments but through his *actions* and his *contempt.*

There is one other point I want to discuss, though I will not actually spoil the ending for anyone who does think they want to see the movie.

That is that yes, late and even deathbed conversions can and do happen.  And yes, it is something to celebrate when someone falls asleep in the Lord, because we do know that blessings await that person.  We should indeed be mindful not to resent those who, as in the parable, come to the field and begin working when it's almost sunset and receive the same wage as the one who worked from the crack of dawn.  Those are things I believe we *should* think about and keep close to our hearts as Christians, that we would not come to lord ourselves above others when we too are sinners.

But when we forget that although Heaven rejoices, the world does weep at loss, when we ignore the grief, to *only* celebrate as was done at the ending, or even worse, to disrespectfully gloss over it and even gloat over how we did better than them in life, then we are *not* doing as God would have us do, especially in the case of a late convert who may have had a difficult past and made decisions that they now regret.  I think that a crucial moment of silence to remember the individual who passed, instead of what seemed like dancing on that person's grave, would have been a much better way to handle it.

Overall, while I would not tell someone not to watch this movie, I would recommend that they do so with caution and be prepared to recognize the areas where it is either not diving deep enough, or simply missing the mark.",1430006400,,10006,4.640022675736962

Where the movie does serve is during the actual classroom scenes wherein our hero credibly addresses the intellectual arguments against belief in God.

6416766,1,B00KD5HFJG,"Two things about this movie confound me. The first one is how anybody can find it good. The second one is how anybody could find it Christian. Sure, it is written to make Christians feel proud of not being Atheists or Muslims, but that doesnt mean it actually follows basic Christian doctrine. After all, pride is a sin. And boy, is this movie full of it. See, this movie isn't for believers who actually try to follow the Christian spirit (in any sense of the phrase). Its for people who use Christianity as a way of feeling smugly superior to everybody else.

As Im sure you know, the basic premise of the movie is that a college professor called Radisson tells all his students to sign a declaration that God is dead. Of course, no real-life college professor would do that, or be allowed to. But this movie is a wish-fullillment fantasy for people who love self-pity, and they need to believe that this scenario is realistic, so that they can feel self-pity about it. They need to feel sorry for themselves about something that didn't actually happen to them. And then, when a Christian student wins a debate about Gods existence against the Professor, it turns out that the professor turned Atheist when his mom died and he got mad at God. Because in the world of this movie, only emotional trauma could ever make anybody doubt Gods existence.

There are side-plots, too, and they consistently portray non-Christians as awful, awful people. A Muslim father disowns his daughter when she converts to Christianity. Professor Radisson is mean to his girlfriend. The girlfriends brother, Mark, won't visit his old mother, and breaks up with his own girlfriend when he learns she has cancer. At some level, the moviemakers (and moviegoers) have to be aware that these reactions aren't very plausible, and that--lets be honest--theyre just as likely to happen among Christians. But they cant acknowledge that in the movie, because that would ruin the fantasy that Christians are superior, and that everybody else is horrible. And that prideful notion is the only entertainment offered in this movie. Sure, Jesus himself made it clear that pride is a sin. But I guess the people who made this movie--and the people who enjoy it--care very little about what Jesus said. And thats a pity, because he said some really good things. One of them was that even sinners love those who love them. Of course, that conflicts with the way Mark dumps his girl once she gets cancer, but did you expect these moviemakers to care about whether their message correlates with the word of Jesus?

To be honest, it's genuinely creepy how the movie's writers seem to not only accept but even CHERISH the idea that everybody but Christians are horrible. That's the greatest failing of the movie--while we're supposed to feel that non-Christians are horrible, we just end up feeling that the moviemakers really look down on everybody who isn't like them.

People who like this movie have to be extremely insecure about their faith. Thats why they like this movie. It provides them with a wish-fullfilment world where everybody else is horrible. and where being a decent human being is some sort of accomplishment that only Christians can pull off. In short, its for people who enjoy the sin of pride, and who want glory without doing anything special to earn it, and who want to look down on everybody with a different religion and regard them as inferior. None of that is in any way compatible with the Christan faith.

Do watch this movie if you care more about regarding other people as inferior than you care about following Christian doctrine. Or if you're the kind of person who thinks it's your duty to give good ratings to every movie that's marketed as ""Christian,"" regardless of actual quality.

Dont watch this film if you actually care about Christianity.",1429747200,5,3842,4.8136363636363635

Let me premise this by stating I was a non believer and only came to be one while in college.  During that time in college I had many professors who while they did not so comically declare God to be dead, they did openly make the same arguments and dealt with Christians with great disdain.  In one class I was threatened with failure if I asked any more questions regarding why the Professor to things out of context.  This was at the University of Minnesota.

From start to finish this film relies on movie tropes and trite arguments to convey a useless message that acknowledges Atheistic arguments against Christianity but unsurprisingly fails to actually address any of them.

6416805,3,B00KD5HFJG,"... when he said the movies are a great big empathy machine. At least in this case he probably was, because this film is a great big stereotype machine.

I'll cut it some slack on acting and direction because the whole thing was shot in 20 days with probably a low budget. The screenplay itself, mainly focusing on the conflict between Christian student Josh Wheaton and his atheist philosophy professor, really has a narrow point of view. The film really paints everything with a black and white brush and makes assumptions about atheists - AND people from other faiths and countries - that cause much of the criticism of the Christian community in the first place. I know several atheists, and they are not all narcissists that abandon sick friends or people that blame God for some tragedy in their past. Many of them have a behavior code that exceeds that of Christians because they do not have a ""ticket to heaven in my pocket"" mentality which many Christians do have and I have observed.

Meanwhile, we get a look at what is supposed to pass for a typical Arab-American Muslim household, as dad always makes sure that his daughter Ayisha has her face totally covered when he drops her off at school. He doesn't seem to mind that she has on short sleeves and clothes that are just as revealing as her peers. Note to dad - the face is not the only physical thing about a young lady that catches the eye of young men. No matter though, because as soon as dad is out of sight. Ayisha removes the face covering. It turns out that Ayisha is a closet Christian, and when dad finds out he reacts as we would expect any Muslim man to react who is three times his daughters size - he smacks her around fist to face and then physically throws her out into the street.

Getting back to the film's main protagonist,Josh, he is now having to debate the philosophy prof in class as to the existence of God using philosophical arguments or else he will fail. The in-class debate part of the film was interesting, but I believe professor Raddison when he said they did not have pre-law at the university, because just about every action he took was completely illegal, from threatening his students with failing grades or at least greatly enhanced workloads if they did not write down ""God is dead"" on a piece of paper and sign it, to confronting and taunting the student Josh when he began to get his goat.

Josh makes a big deal during his portion of the debate about God allowing free will to reign on earth and that being the reason for all of the evil, and then the plot goes on to disprove exactly that by implying divine destruction of the ignition capabilities of every car that two random missionaries on their way to Disneyland touch (in one of many sideplots) so that they can be at a particular place at a crucial time. As one missionary states to the other ""God has you exactly where he wants you"". What happened to free will if these two are just manipulated actors in God's grandiose play? Other interesting points - apparently all atheists turn to Christ when confronted with death (a point the late Christopher Hitchens disproves), and exactly what is this generic cancer that the atheist blogger has? Inquiring minds want to know. Plus - filmmakers - I know plagiarism is the sincerest form of flattery, but many of us know an ""I am Spartacus"" moment when we see it (Josh's argument in favor of the existence of God causes everybody in the class to stand and say ""God is not dead""). The great irony here - the screenwriter for Spartacus was James Dalton Trumbo, who just happened to be an atheist. I would say this film is worth watching as a curiosity if nothing else.",1429401600,3,3676,4.523308270676692

6416807,1,B00KD5HFJG,"If you're a Christian that needs an ""after school special"" quality movie to help you feel good about your choice in religion, this is probably right up your alley.  Much like the mediocre music of Amy Grant, people love this movie because of the genre, not the quality.

I was given a copy of this DVD from a relative who is perpetually on a mission, not to prove the existence of a god, but to prove every other theory or belief is wrong.  When this came available via streaming, the ""I don't want to hook up my DVD player"" excuses was out, so I finally gave it a shot.  I made it to the end feeling more disgusted with this movie, the person that gave it to me, and Christianity as a whole than I thought possible.  If the goal is to recruit me to the ""winning team"", they failed miserably.  Premise aside, it's a poorly directed, awkwardly written, movie that forces it's intentions rather than winning the audience over.  If you're not coming into this with a ""Christianity is the only religion that should be allowed on the planet and everyone else is an evil heathen"" vibe, you're probably not going to enjoy this movie.

Like other reviewers mention, the characters are painfully one dimensional and cartoonish in nature.  The ""believers"" are meek, happy, sweet characters that the directors tried far too hard to get the audience to love.  The ""non-believers"" might as well have come on screen with devil horns  and Hitler masks because they couldn't have been any more over the top.  From the Devil's Advocate style caricature portrayed by Dean Cain, the vengeful to the point of comedy devil-Sorbo, and the other seemingly random and out of place injections of evil from Martin's Father (who picked no god), and Ayisha's father (who picked the wrong god), this movie is biased to the point of being insulting and outright offensive.  They never missed a chance to show the ""non-believers"" doing something despicable and/or criminal.  Of course, they all come around to see the error of their ways and toward the light of God, because that's how God works.  Through low budget movies with d-list actors and poor directing.

If you're a Christian and want to see grotesquely exaggerated manifestation of ""evil"" have both hands tied behind it's back and beaten down by d-list acting, some clumsy dialog and confusing directing, then get the extra large popcorn and settle in for a treat.  They couldn't have done a better job at offending every faith and belief outside of Christianity if they tried, and I'm not sure this wasn't the intent. There's as much chance a non-Christian is going to be coerced by this movie as there is a Christian that will be objective about it.  Anyone open for reasonable and civil discussion on this topic will be hard pressed to find anything of value in this movie.  The final ""arguments"" against the devil-Sorbo are so wishy washy that it's hardly worth the 90 minute wait.  ""Christianity is good because the alternative is bad and doesn't make any sense.""  I was hoping they could have at least left me with something to ponder.  The only thought this movie provoked, was my intense desire to know why I sat through an 1hr 53m of cinematic drivel to such a disappointing finish.

To think this movie has any merit outside of the Christian world is silly.  To think that this movie contains compelling arguments for Christianity or against atheism is sillier.  This is low rent, feel good, Christian propaganda. Nothing more.",1429315200,8,3467,4.738333333333333

Furthermore, they made her father look like an oppressive, unfriendly version of Aladin's Genie.

God is NOT a boy.

Jesus was a Prophet of God, just like the previous prophets God sent down to earth to call to worship the One.

While I did enjoy certain aspect of the film, I did not enjoy the way Muslims were represented. I wonderjust for a second what would happen if Jews were represented the same way particularly Orthodoxs and Hasidic, why not Hindus or Buddhist? By the way, women in other countries do not cover themselves up to hide their beauty just like women in American do not walk around half naked because they respect themselves, its their belief system. The way to bring people to the Lord is not by brow beating them or degrading them. Be an example of Christianity through your actions, people should just look at you and see God likeness. What if there was someone interested in Christianity and was turned off by the way non-believers were portrayed? There has to be more Christians turning people away from the Lord than any outside religion could ever do, after all the Devil goes to church too.
Regarding the Professor, YES there are professors (lack of better word) just like the one in the movie. I returned to college in 2012 and cannot wait to get away from it because of un-professionals like that one. I can see why 7,000 children drop out of school every day in America.
I did enjoy the banter of the student against his teacher I think it was symbolic of God verses the Devil. I also feel the strongest believers are the so-called non-believers. Why would you be interested in something that to you does not exist and why become so angry? I do not believe in other religions but it does not make me angry I will listen to what a person have to say and ask questions but Im always respectful. In fact, I will look up information about other religions because I hope to help others in my future and I need to understand their background first.

6416884,1,B00KD5HFJG,"If you were hoping for an interesting exploration of the subject, forget it. This movie is a fantasy in which Christians are the ultimate heroes and atheists (and Muslims) the ultimate villains. This movie presents people with real problems and then considers their story over as soon as they accept the Christian God.

<spoilers>

Nowhere is this more apparent than in its treatment of the Muslim convert. Caught listening to the New Testament on her phone, this poor girl is beaten and thrown out on her doorstep by her hulking, intimidating father who would have been better cast as the cartoonish villain in an Indiana Jones movie. Cut off from her family, homeless, hers is the only truly interesting story in the movie. But we barely see anything else about her in the movie. She's a Christian now, so mission accomplished!

Now the movie gets down to brass tacks and deals with those nasty atheists. One dimensional villains and one sided arguments are to be expected from what should have been a Lifetime after school made for TV movie. But they don't even present any interesting arguments for God! They could have delved into the considerable, strong arguments of Dr. William Lane Craig and other serious apologists. That would have been interesting and compelling. Instead, the entire debate hinges on (I kid you not!) the fact that the antagonist is only an atheist because he hates God and how can he hate something that doesn't exist?

If your faith is strong, you don't need this movie and will probably find it insulting to your intelligence. If you are wavering in your faith or an atheist then I can't imagine how this movie would convince you that God is not dead. Clearly the makers of the movie can not think of any way to defend their assertion other than one dimensional atheist villains and trite straw man arguments.",1429056000,5,1841,4.798107255520505

Just because someone is a non-believer, does not mean that a bad thing has happened to them to turn them against religion.  It could be that they were raised in a non-religious home and have no opinion either way.  I do think they did at least something half-way right in regard to the Muslim girl and her father.

I'm a Christian and I absolutely loved the movie. I found the debate inside the classroom interesting and the relationships between the characters fascinating. I most likely will watch it again with a friend or family member. I'm just sorry I missed it on the big screen!

I loved the contemporary Christian music and the fact that I can watch movies from Pure Flix with family without being embarrassed about the next sex or smut scene. Thank you Pure Flix! I just saw ""Do you Believe?,"" also released by Pure Flix, on the big screen and was blown away.

6417042,1,B00KD5HFJG,"This is a poorly crafted Christian propaganda film aimed at an uninformed and disenfranchised audience.

The film quickly launches into its major plot with a silly scenario: A philosophy professor requires his students to either unanimously sign a statement proclaiming god is dead or suffer a scholastic backlash. The protagonist, Josh Wheaton, of course won't go along with such academic bullying.

The rather absurd events in that scene set up the philosophical conflict that will dominate the movie. But it does more: It puts the audience on notice that this film's POV is in large part an anti-intellectual one, even as it sets up what is supposed to be an academic debate about the existence of god. The lens the movie views academia through is one of distrust and contempt. That POV is as old as the Christian canon itself, or at least as old as the Christian additions to that otherwise Hebrew canon.

In the New Testament, the knowledge and wisdom of humans often are unflatteringly juxtaposed with belief in a Christian god and the spiritual wisdom attained therefrom. This is not surprising. Early Christians on the whole were a lowly lot -- commoners with no access to education. Celsus, for example, described 2nd century Christians as follows: ""They manifestly show that they desire and are able to gain over only the silly, and the mean, and the stupid, with women and children.""

Of course Celsus was engaging in a polemic and overstating his case. The writers of the NT often demonstrate a high degree of education in their texts. And while, except in the case of Paul's genuine letters (about half of those claiming his authorship in the Christian canon), we do not know who those writers were, we know they were educated if not honest. Most of those texts were either forged under the names of important early Christians or written anonymously and later falsely ascribed to such early Christians. But we also know their target audience on the whole was the uneducated class of whom Celsus wrote, as so many ancients were.

So surely stories such as the one contained in Acts 4 of the ""illiterate (agrammatos) and ignorant (idiotes)"" Peter and John befuddling the collective human wisdom and authority of the elite Sanhedrin must have resonated with most early Christians, who no doubt could easily envision themselves in the shoes of those two uneducated apostles as they relied not on worldly letters but on spiritual power and wisdom to make their case before the Sanhedrin. Never mind that the anonymous author of Luke-Acts, writing around 80 or 90 A.D., couldn't have known that, within about a century of his efforts, seven sometimes very sophisticated Greek texts would be either falsely attributed to or forged under the names of those two ""illiterate and ignorant"" apostles and subsequently canonized, thus requiring later Christians to scramble for apologetics to explain how two illiterates could have written such texts. In the earliest days of Christianity, the story of the commoners, Peter and John, making fools of the socially and intellectually elite with spiritual power and wisdom must have been a welcome balm for the ears of illiterate believers and widely circulated among them even before landing in Acts 4.

And so, too, this movie must resonate with modern Christian fundamentalists, if the high rating is to be explained. Indeed, in a vein similar to the story in Acts 4, early in the film, Willie Robertson of Duck Dynasty confronts an atheist blogger and befuddles her with simple straight talk about his beliefs. Of course, for purposes of this film, Willie represents just a good ol' Bible-believin' boy relying on the force of his beliefs rather than any convoluted academics. Forget that Willie is actually a college graduate. As with so much of this film, it's not about how things are but how they seem to evangelicals toting around a Christian persecution complex and a good dose of ignorance.

Yet this movie wants to take the paradigm of the superiority of spiritual wisdom over worldly wisdom portrayed in Acts 4 and Willie's encounter a step further. It's not enough for a redneck woodsman to upstage an arrogant blogger with the courage of his convictions; the film wants to move into academia and upstage it with its own tools -- science and reason -- or so the film hopes we'll believe. As Willie's confrontation with an atheist is intended to demonstrate, Christians don't need worldly knowledge to make fools of those in the academy; but the film also wants to demonstrate through its protagonist, Josh, that Christians also can use the tools of academia to do the same thing, if only Christians can wrest those tools from the hands of atheist academics long enough to do so. In this film, it is not human knowledge that's the problem so much as it is the atheist purveyors of such knowledge, who slant it and then bully those who won't go along with their distortions. And seemingly science and logic would support fundamentalist Christian beliefs if only those atheists weren't running the academy and stacking the deck against Christians.

But to make that case, the film has to engage in a load of intellectual dishonesty. For example, it ignores the whole of ancient Hebrew cosmology in the canon to focus on a Biblical passage that, with a little coaxing, might seem in line with modern cosmology. Thus, according to the film's protagonist, god speaking light into existence in Genesis is not necessarily inconsistent with the big bang of modern science (a theory perhaps ironically first proposed by the physicist Georges Lemaitre, who also was a Catholic priest).

Unfortunately for the film, Biblical cosmology and modern scientific thinking have about as much in common as this film does with a quality movie. In the Bible, especially in its earliest parts, the world is seen as a sort of snow globe -- a flat disk sitting on a foundation and encased in a shell, a firmament (raqia). God resides on the other side of that firmament but occasionally comes down from on high to visit the world's occupants and even opens windows in the surrounding shell to pour water upon the Earth. And despite god's abode being off limits to humans in the earliest parts of the canon, men ostensibly can reach it, if only they can build a structure that is high enough. And seemingly, but for god's active intervention, they might have succeeded with the Tower of Babel.

That snow globe cosmology of the Old Testament meshes rather well with several earlier cosmologies of nearby cultures and probably is indebted to them.  Similar views of the structure of the universe can be found in many early cultures in other parts of the world as well and were not limited to Near Eastern societies, though the nearby Greeks moved beyond them even as Hebrew thought continued to languish there.  This relative stagnation no doubt was due at least in part to the Hebrew god having sided in holy texts with the inferior view.  Many apologists now try to paint this Biblical cosmology as a symbolic  rather than a literal one.  Yet with there having been so many similar belief systems rattling around in antiquity, a contrary conclusion is required, and pretending the OT's view of the cosmos is poetic prose that now meshes well with modern science requires the sort of flimsy chicanery this film trades in with relish.  In this regard, the film seems to be counting on the audience's ignorance not just of science but of history and Hebrew scripture as well. It's not aiming at an informed audience but an intellectually disenfranchised one that's running on the fumes of faith.

But ultimately, this movie's greatest intellectual sin, aside from bad craftsmanship at virtually all levels, is it does what too many folks in deity-based religions do: It confuses the typical arguments for a god of creation as arguments for *its* god, a Christian one, being the creator. Even some Christians would object to this confusion. For example, many Gnostic Christians view the ancient Hebrew god of creation as a different deity from the one they worship. But aside from theological spats between Christian movements about the nature of their god, the most significant problem is that proving there is a god and proving some version of the Christian god is that god are entirely different matters. They have little in common other than neither will ever happen.

I suppose most of this film's intellectual sins could be overlooked were it an otherwise well-made piece of fundamentalist feel-good cinema serving to salve the wounded believer's psyche in the same manner as the cartoonish Rambo movies salved the wounded American psyche in the 80's. But even on that level this movie should fail. Its poor acting, editing, directing and writing prevent it from earning any such pass from me. Yet such failings don't seem to have prevented it from earning the appreciation of many believing viewers. Presumably those viewers are more concerned with affirmation of their faith, no matter how simple minded or dishonest that affirmation is, than the quality of the entertainment they ingest.

As someone who has been on both the Christian and the non-Christian side (though more agnostic than atheist), I thought that the movie did raise many of the general views and questions that one might have on either side.  But the characters were not well-developed  in fact they were just caricatures and overblown stereotypes.  And I was really disappointed in the story line about the Muslim character.  I think there was potential to engage her character through an inter-faith discussion about God rather but when I saw the direction that her story went, it became clear to me that the filmmakers (and original author) were just pushing their own personal beliefs.

I think that this will likely come across as a feel good story that reinforces the beliefs of the target audience (the evangelical Christian crowd) but as a person of faith that does NOT identify with that group, I felt that the movie was hollow.  Also, I was very uncomfortable with the cameo by the guy from the Robertson family.  I guess I can understand why they chose someone from that family, but I recall that one of his relatives (the grandfather/patriarch?) made some very unkind comments a couple years back that were quite offensive including racially charged comments and bigoted anti-gay commentsso to me, that family is not a good representation of Jesus message.

It's obvious it's intentional because I'm his recent throw away AMA on Reddit Sorbo flat out said he doesn't see a problem with the portrayal and he didn't clarify his many previous statements regarding other religions and atheists. He even stands behind his bigoted and ignorant remarks about the growing unrest between minority communities and law enforcement.

6417168,1,B00KD5HFJG,"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!

First, the secular, the atheist and pretty much anyone who disagrees with Josh is depicted as a horrible, evil douchebag.
Professor Raddison openly mocks his Christian girlfriend in front of colleagues and just in general. He has a dinner party and treats her like a servant. He bullies Josh and is an egomaniac.
Josh's girlfriend is an insufferable bitch (which Josh is somehow unaware of)
Blogger girl (I don't remember names at this point) makes fun of peoples' belief and uses the word ""offended"" all the time just like liberals do.
Blogger girl's boyfriend...(the guy who played Superman from Lois and Clark) Evil Superman, leaves her immediately when he finds out she has cancer.

Other characters include, cute muslim girl, who is a closet Christian.
Raddison's live-in girlfriend... Wrinkle Face.
Two pastors, Black Accented Pastor and Dopy White Pastor.
Asian kid and my favorite, stereotypical-token-black-kid who introduces himself as ""G-Dog"" and that's his only line in the movie.

The entire basis for the movie is that Professor Raddison forces students to write, ""God is Dead"" on a piece of paper for his class or he will fail them. Josh refuses to do it because of his beliefs and Raddison forces him to defend that stance. He gives him 3 class periods to do it and if he can't, he will fail him. For fairness Josh convinces him to put the students in charge of the final decision. This is a hilarious abuse of power that any student could take to the Board of Education or the Dean. It's discrimination. It'd be no different if Raddison made them write, ""Black People Steal"" or ""Asians Can't Drive"". The entire mcguffin for this movie is illegal and totally stupid.

At this point the alcohol finally kicked in or I would never have made it past that point.

The arguments are bad, terrible and silly. A funny note, Josh's 3 presentations are After Effects masterpieces. Each one tops the other. With the time it would have taken him to collect all of the images, text and video loops, then keyframe the special effects, Josh is definitely failing EVERY class for the semester.

But I digress.

All arguments are based around ""if the person speaking has more intellectual clout than you...you automatically lose""
The entire ""debate"" turns into a ""quote-off"". Who can quote more smart people to prove their point. There is NO new ground covered.
The Bible is only used in the debate by Josh. When there are TONS of Bible stories/verses that would make people, not only question, ""Is there a God?"" but ask the question, ""If there IS a God, what kind of God is he/she/it?""

Raddison only quotes the Bible in a ""shock moment"" to reveal to Josh that he used to be a Christian and states in an evil voice, ""Most atheists used to be Christian"" dun dun DUUUUN!  First off that's kind of ""duuuuh"". Parents usually raise their children up as whatever religion mom and dad practice. You are indoctrinated from birth...so yea it would make sense that a lot of atheists used to practice a religion.

Anyway, the two pastors help Cute Muslim Girl, who is beaten and thrown out of her house by her father when he finds that, ""Jesus is her personal savior"". Raddison's girlfriend, Wrinkle Face, leaves him for being a dick. Raddison loses the debate with Josh and we find that the reason why he was an atheist is because he prayed to God to save his mother when he was a child and God said, ""No.""

Sad and dejected, Raddison soothes himself by looking at the papers of previous students, God is Dead. Then he comes across his girlfriend's paper. (yea she was a former student) He then reads a letter from his dead mom saying, ""Keep believing in God"" or some-such. Raddison has an epiphany and stands up to get his girlfriend back! Woot!

But where has she gone?! Frantically looking around the room he spies the corner of a newspaper. (a message from God?) He moves the mail on top... Newsboys Concert, it reads. Yes...YES, she loved crappy gospel music converted into crappy rock music. Frantically he grabs his coat and storms out the door. He walks (apparently cars aren't a thing that Professors know about) to the concert. Grabs Wrinkle Face and apologizes to her. The two hug and he says, ""I'm sorry, I'm so sorry."" She smiles and asks, ""Who are you saying that to...me? Or God?"" He chuckles and says, ""Both"" the two share a PG kiss.

Josh and Cute Muslim Girl meet for the first time! It looks like she is going to become Josh's new girlfriend. The Newsboys tell everyone that they heard about the debate. And ask, ""Everyone text everyone in your phone 3 words, God's Not Dead"" They all do it! Phones start buzzing with the message. The camera pans to everyone in the audience so happy and carefree. It's an uplifting moment...end credits.

...iiiiis what I'd be saying if that actually HAPPENED.

Professor Raddison is caught in a hit and run on his way to the concert. While lying in the street the two pastors come by, black accented pastor who apparently has medical training says Raddison's ribs are broken and his lungs are going to fill up with blood...or something. Dopy White Pastor asks him if he believes in Jesus. Raddison, says ""I'm an atheist"". What follows is the creepiest scene I've ever watched in a movie other than 28 Weeks Later where the woman is strapped to a bed and she's locked in a room with her zombie turning husband.

We watch Professor Raddison slowly die, gasping for breath while two pastors stand over him attempting a deathbed conversion. Dopy White Pastor says, ""The car that hit you was a gift, because it could have killed you instantly but the God that you don't believe in is giving you a another chance... another chance to change your final answer.""

Immediately Professor Raddison starts mumbling scripture and begging for forgiveness while struggling to breath. Dopy White Pastor keeps saying, ""Stay with me, stay with me."" Not to keep Raddison alive. He only wants to keep him alive long enough to convert him back to Christianity. The second Professor Raddison accepts Jesus, Dopy White Pastor says, ""It's ok, it's ok."" Basically, ""Now your have my permission to die.""

Oh, but the rest of the movies plays out the same. The Newsboys concert, happy Christians, the texting. The pastors actually share a chuckle when they pick up, the now dead, Raddison's phone off the pavement and the message, ""God's not Dead"" (but heeee is!) is written in a text. Black Accented Pastor states, ""What happened here is a cause for celebration. Pain yes, but only for a moment. Think of the joy."" A man is dead and his killer has currently escaped! There is literally NOTHING to celebrate.

At this point all of the Christians just swap places with their atheist counter parts. They care about NOTHING but praising God to such a degree that Josh doesn't mourn a 6 year relationship with a girl he planned to marry. After a few crying scenes, Cute Muslim Girl goes to a concert and seems unfazed about being homeless or losing her family. Wrinkle Face also doesn't mourn her failed relationship with Raddison...or his death, because the movie doesn't seem to want her to know. This could have ended as just another light-hearted Christian wish fulfillment. But turns horribly nasty and mean-spirited when you have ALL of the atheist characters either die or get cancer or in the case of Evil Superman, elude to not being happy with his fast car and posh lifestyle.

All conversions happen purely out of fear, desperation or stupidity. Blogger Girl gets cancer and just wants to feel better. She just wants hope. Raddison is terrified of death and only that spurs his conversion. Asian Kid runs to Josh to tell him he wants to follow Jesus based on...really nothing. He hasn't read the Bible, not even the New Testament. He's only heard that there is deity who loves him and instantly jumps at the chance to worship. It's all superficial, shallow, and insulting to both atheists and believers.",1428105600,2,7960,4.746020260492041
6417169,1,B00KD5HFJG,"SPOILERS! SPOILERS EVERYWHERE!

The premise of the film is that college freshman Josh Wheaton is unlucky enough to choose
Professor Radisson for his philosophy professor. At the beginning of class Radisson, a hardcore atheist, orders his class to write
""God is Dead"" on a piece of paper. Josh can't bring himself to write those three words and so
Radisson says he will have to defend his position in front of the class at three different class periods
in addition to all the other work for the class. At the end if he fails in his argument he will fail him in the class.

It's at this point you need to check your brain at the door.
There is no college in the world that would allow a professor to act in this manner. All Josh would have to do
is make a complaint of discrimination to anyone higher than Radisson in the college and watch as he's thoroughly chastised if not
outright fired. Hell he wouldn't have to. The moment any of his classmates posted to their twitter/Facebook accounts that a despotic instructor
was singling out a Christian student it would be all over the web, then the news, then Radisson is in the unemployment line.

The mindlessness continues as Josh begins his debates and appears to have done extensive research on writers, philosophers, and other intellectuals in addition to having expertly created powerpoint presentations prepared for these debates. At this point you wonder if he just dropped all his other classes so he could invest all his time debating an egomaniac.

Peripheral characters and side-stories abound as the movie shows us people from all walks of life.
Sadly, though not surprising the depictions of all non-Christians in the film are so bad they're caricatures.
In fact I'm convinced that Professor Radisson is a stand-in for Christopher Hitchens.

Radisson's treatment of his girlfriend is akin to spousal abuse.
After risking his career creating an illegal debate with Josh, Radisson threatens him
in the hallway that he will make it his life's mission to destroy Josh's dreams.

Josh's girlfriend Kara throws away a 6 year relationship because Josh is ""gambling their future"" ...somehow.
Ayisha's father who is a Muslim immigrant beats her and throws her out when he discovers that she's Christian.
Couple Marc and Amy depict atheists as angry, cannibalistic, and pathetic. Marc shows himself to be materialistic, and a rampant narcissist. Amy is a blogger who ambushes conservatives to spit vitriol at them for their beliefs, and Marc dumps her when she tells him she has cancer.
Because apparently emotions like empathy, and love only exist between religious couples.

Amy is later shown going through another doctor's visit alone and when asked by the doctor if she has anyone she replies, ""No, nobody.""
REALLY!? No parents, no siblings, no distant relatives, not even any friends willing to be with you? You see kids, being an atheist is just awful!

In the end you realize that 90% of the bad things that happen in the film
are happening to or perpetuated by non-Christians. Rather than have any actual discourse
concerning the questions humans have been asking since they could form thoughts
(""Why am I here"" ""What happens when we die"") the creators of this film chose to just
mud sling at the secular community. God's Not Dead will not make you better at arguing
against Atheists or even understand the position they are coming from.

But if you actually enjoyed this movie, I doubt you picked it up for any of those reasons.

This is definitely not a film you should watch sober if at all.",1428105600,2,3553,4.848184818481848
6417170,1,B00KD5HFJG,"I realize that I'm not the intended audience for this film, which is aimed at a certain demographic segment - teen to tween American Evangelicals.  It's not supposed to ""convert"" anyone; the goal is for the faithful to gird up their loins and be strengthened in sowing the word of God in the field of the world.  Or something like that.  It's an example of what people, even other Christians, are referring to when they ask why ""Christian"" films and music have to be so irredeemably bad, on an artistic level.

The first thing I noticed, aside from the utter failure of the philosophical arguments, was the clumsy script, the bad acting, the overblown and dull music, and the pedestrian directing.  On the other hand, the production values were pretty good - clearly, no expense was spared to ensure that the final product was at least technically professional in appearance if not content.

The film falls prey to the pitfall inherent in any ""message"" movie - that the ""story,"" such as it is, takes a back seat to the argument - in this case, that atheism is meaningless and illogical, and Christianity has the answers for everything.  The filmmakers get this across through straw man arguments, and blatant misrepresentation of the other side.  I wasn't expecting&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Kalam-Cosmological-Argument/dp/157910438X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Kalam Cosmological Argument</a>, but concluding from evidence of the Big Bang that the Bible had it right while centuries of ""scientists"" were wrong in believing that the universe had always existed, is an embarrassing oversimplification.  By that standard, any number of competing religious myths of the creation of the universe would be just as valid as the Biblical one.  And the implication that if the Bible is correct here, it must be correct everywhere, is completely unsupported.  At least no one said that ""geology"" proves that the earth is only 6,000 years old; undoubtedly many people will be put off by the main character's heretical statement that the universe is 13.8 billion years old.  Followers of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ken-Ham/dp/0890516863/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ken Ham</a>&nbsp;would be advised to steer clear of this one.

The filmmakers can't help taking a shot at ""Darwinism"" by claiming that Darwin believed in phyletic gradualism (that's not what they called it in the film, but that's what the character was talking about), then mentioning that recent discoveries tend to support&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/punctuated-equilibrium/dp/0393064980/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">punctuated equilibrium</a>&nbsp;(again, they didn't use that term, but that's what they were referring to).  Congratulations, you've proved that science advances from rudimentary understanding toward better explanations as more data becomes available.  Darwin was also unaware of basic genetics, since Mendel's work still lay in the future, as did the discovery of DNA, so Darwin is hardly the last word on the theory of evolution.  A similar theory was proposed by the Roman poet Lucretius, so Darwin hadn't even come up with an original idea.  He gets credit for making the initial observations in nature to support the theory.  I'm grateful that no one&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/tried-to-claim/dp/B001BYLFFS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">tried to claim</a>&nbsp;that ""Darwinism"" led to the atrocities of the Nazis and the Communists.  The filmmakers' restraint in that area is commendable.

The atheist professor character is probably the worst offender in the straw man category.  Even as an atheist, I would have walked out of a college class where the professor demanded that everyone write ""God is dead.""  Neither religion nor atheism belongs in a public classroom.  And if you're going to teach Nietzsche, that's not the way to go about it.  Also, the slobbering veneration of Stephen Hawking is inappropriate, especially when quoting a word-salad sentence.  Is it disrespectful to point out that Hawking, while undeniably brilliant, rather than being ""the greatest mind who ever lived,"" may in fact be the most overrated man of our time?  There's a reason why Hawking has never received a Nobel Prize - he hasn't actually done anything to merit one.  I would go so far as to say that if Hawking did not suffer from a truly horrible physical ailment, he would not be anywhere near as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/famous/dp/B00QFSHCR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">famous</a>&nbsp;as he is now.  But since everyone's heard of him, and he's become somewhat of a spokesman for atheism, suddenly he's a philosopher.  ""Philosophy is dead,"" indeed.  Another scientist-turned-philosopher, Richard Dawkins, is mentioned at one point, but nothing about real philosophers like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peter-Singer/dp/0521707684/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Peter Singer</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sam-Harris/dp/143917122X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sam Harris</a>.

The film also fails to make a distinction between hatred of God, and hatred of the idea of God, which are not the same thing.  We learn that the angry atheist professor isn't an atheist at all - he believes in God, but can't forgive him for letting his mother die.  The problem of evil is brushed away with ""God gave us free will,"" ""sometimes the answer to a prayer is 'no',"" and ""we can't understand God's plan; we just have to trust him.""  This doesn't explain anything - ""God"" is merely a semantic stopsign to halt further questioning.  An examination of anything as complex as the Euthyphro Dilemma is, of course, beyond the scope of this film.

If anyone had any doubts as to the intended audience for this film, the ending at the mediocre ""Christian Rock"" concert should have removed them.  I admit being surprised by the appearance of the jackass from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Duck-Dysentery/dp/B00FA2CBFU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Duck Dysentery</a>, because despite their numerous failings, I had up to that point assumed that the filmmakers were above that sort of thing.  As far as I'm concerned, those people represent the worst aspects of American Christianity - corporatism, militarism, jingoistic patriotism, gleeful ignorance, boastful arrogance, hatred of women, gays, minorities, and other Christian denominations, and the erroneous belief that the framers of the Constitution were 21st century Bible-thumpers&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/who-intended-to-establish-the-U-S-as-an-Old-Testament-theocracy/dp/1932225412/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">who intended to establish the U.S. as an Old Testament theocracy</a>.  The filmmakers put their true agenda on display with that scene, where Robertson (who couldn't even be bothered to make a personal appearance) bullies the audience into texting ""God's not dead"" (by astonishing coincidence, also the film's title) to everyone they know.

Not surprisingly, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/atheist-counterpoint/dp/B00561BNHW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">atheist counterpoint</a>&nbsp;to this film is also a steaming pant-load, with a similarly abysmal script and bad acting.  If your goal as a filmmaker is to shove your religious beliefs down the audience's throat, with the ""story"" functioning only as a vehicle, you're not creating art - in effect, you're creating pornography, where the ""setup"" serves a similar function (the cable guy isn't there to install the cable TV - it's just a ploy to get a man and woman into the same room so they can go at each other).  At least pornography doesn't try to pass itself off as anything serious or meaningful.

Far from being a counterweight to the ""immorality"" of Hollywood, ""God's Not Dead"" is a perfect example of it.",1428105600,5,8154,6.166077738515901

6417172,1,B00KD5HFJG,"anyone who wants to argue god exists is just a person whos close minded and unwilling to learn. Even jesus was crucified for teaching buddhist teachings to christians walking on water, turning cheek, friends wth enemy are all buddhist teachings that came before he was born. What jesus teaches is to keep a open mind. Even open enough to the fact god may not exist but may exist. As soon as the guy says hes a christian its just another close minded person who only learned about one religion instead of the history of religion. Christians burned wiccans at the stake not for being witches but believing in not only a god but a goddess. That it takes male and female to create life that male female are equal. Christians didn't like that so they killed all these wiccans who were called witches. You can look in history it really happened. So not understanding how religion works or the history of it your faith of course is blind. Its like walking nto a room of darkness and you can't see right. Study all religions and athiesm. Study it all and then come up with your own conclusion and you won't get crucified for it like jesus was by the jewish people. He didn't die for our sins he was killed by jewish people who believed in the old testament so strongly and blindedly they killed one of the most important pieces to christianity.

Either that, or it reinforces the beliefs of the film's target audience: evangelical Protestant Christians.

I love the fact that someone pointed out that you have free will that is something GOD gave us, what we do with that free will, will have an affect on our lives. But no mistake GOD loves all of us, we were created in his image, and I still remember asking my Grandmother as a child what color is GOD?  The reason I asked is because my Grandmothers best  friend was black and when she passed away I went with my Grandparents to her funeral at a Beautiful little black church deep back in the trees. Like it was set there by the hand of GOD. Well when I walked in I saw this really large, beautiful painting that was identical to a painting in the church I attended with my Grandparents except that Jesus was Black.  My Grandmother told me when I asked her "" well GOD is all colors, shapes, sizes, man, woman, child.""  I said how can that be?
well she said "" Did GOD create man?""  I said Yes. She said "" He created us in his image, is what the Bible says right?""  I said that's what I have read and have been told in church and in Sunday school. "" Well then why would HE appear only as man? When he all things"".

The reasoning in this movie is so biased. I really thought this was going to be a thought provoking movie with great points on both sides but instead I got weak arguments for God's existence.

6417226,1,B00KD5HFJG,"I'll preface this review by saying when I saw some of the trailers, I found the premise of the film somewhat interesting: a student challenging a professor about the existence of God. However, the problem with this film is less about its core premise and more about its nearly insufferable rhetoric which overtakes much of the story. The first sign of trouble occurs at the very beginning. In ""God is not Dead"", at fictional Hadleigh University, Professor Radisson (Kevin Sorbo) insists in an introductory philosophy class his students sign a statement which unequivocally states God is dead, meaning that God never existed. The idea is that he can't get on with his lectures unless the idea of God's existence or non-existence doesn't need to be debated. If a professor at a public university, and probably many private accredited universities, forced his or her students to sign a statement that God did not exist, that professor's tenure position would be in jeopardy. From the start, the premise has already been tainted with a rather ludicrous plot device. (And let's not forget that at private Evangelical universities, like Bob Jones and the like, students are taught unequivocally that not only does God exist but use religious texts in many non-religious courses.) The main plot of the film is that Josh Wheaton refuses the professors' insistence of signing the statement. So Wheaton must try to prove that science can't disprove the existence of God, which at first seems an interesting challenge. However, as we'll see, the rhetoric of Wheaton's arguments shift during the course of the film.

The film actually has several story lines interacting at once. There's Wheaton versus Radisson, Wheaton and his girlfriend, Professor Radisson and his Christian girlfriend, a young woman dating a ferociously materialistic businessman, a local pastor and a Christian from an African country have bad luck getting a car to run to go to some kind of religious retreat, and a female college student who is Islamic and learning about Christianity in secret. And there's even a Chinese student in the class intrigued by the debates about God.

As the story unfolds, many of the supporting characters become stereotypical and shallow as if they were lifted from the latest daytime soap opera. Each of them intentionally hurt the ""good characters"" who are all trying to either be good Christians or find God. Wheaton's girlfriend disowns him because he's decided to take the professor's challenge. The professor becomes more callous and confrontational towards Wheaton as the debate moves on. We learn at one point, the professor has personal reasons why he's an atheist. Then the father of the Islamic girl finds out about her interest in Christianity, and he reacts in a way you might expect of a film trying to propagate a particular religious point of view. And the woman dating the businessman finds out she has a major health problem, and he dumps her like spoiled food at a restaurant.

However, the most disappointing moments were not in the first debate offered by Wheaton but in the second and third debates. (The most disturbing and offensive was the abusive Islamic father.) In the first debate, which I thought was the strongest scene of the film, Wheaton offers a very good case why science can't disprove the existence of God. Science may not prove the existence of God but it can't disprove it either. Fair enough. But in the second debate, I noticed a shift in Wheaton's rhetoric. Now, the debate was about proving the existence of God, which seemed at odds with the premise of the film and the point of the debate. And in the last debate, Wheaton offers the evangelical position on evil. His debate is no longer about debating the existence of God, it's about answering religious questions from a Christian perspective. And then the professor and the student are debating about why religion is a good thing. And then how the pastor who can't get his car started resolves is so ridiculously silly and contrived, I couldn't believe it. Oh brother, give me a break. The final scenes become overly preachy. Almost insufferably unbearable.

This film is not simply a story about a student debating about God in a philosophy class. The film is a sermon disguised as entertainment. I could buy some of the first act, although the abrupt break-up of the girlfriend seemed out of left field. However, by midway, I realized that this film is really Christian propaganda. In Acts 2 and 3, every scene was carefully written, scripted and acted in such a way to reinforce the Evangelical position of the filmmakers. This is a very lousy way to make a film. I was particularly disappointed in the portrayal of the Islamic father who goes crazy when he finds out his daughter is learning about Christianity. This is actually quite false as Islam has always embraced the learning about other religions, but the film propagates that traditional Islamists are against reading other religious texts. Telling me a story about Christians is one thing. Preaching to me about Christianity through a story is another, and that's not why I watch narrative films. Obviously this film was designed to convert people. Much better films with religious themes include ""The Blind Side"", which was a true story about real Christians, ""The Nun's Story"", starring Audrey Hepburn, based on the true story of a Belgian nun during the rise of Nazi Germany on the eve of World War II, and ""Fiddler on the Roof"", about Jews in Russia on eve of the Revolution. ""God is not Dead"" is not about real people or real situations, but just a forgettable contrivance that will only be applauded by those who already have a religious agenda. Huge disappointment.",1427760000,903,5728,4.944963655244029
6417227,5,B00KD5HFJG,"I would also like to address the negative comments that proclaimed Christians labeled as biased and one sided. As much as the film is criticized portraying ""stereotypes"" I would argue the firestorm of negative remarks was just as stereotypical and...expected. The movie didn't say people who don't believe in God don't exhibit morals, it just asked where they come from. Well, without God what would be the basis of our moral system? In fact, if there was no God why would we even have to care? Our laws are based off Christian Principles so if murder is wrong where did that idea come from? What text, if not the bible or any other text, would we base our moral code? As humans without God we would say, ""You shouldn't kill because it's wrong and it's wrong because....(please someone fill in the blank). Is it wrong because we said it's wrong? Is it wrong because we just feel it's wrong? Why do we feel it's wrong? Our concious? Well, what if someone was to say they don't feel it's wrong how would you convince them they are wrong? There would be no argument because there would be nothing to base it off of and that is why everything would be permissible. God does not permit murder and its in the ten commandments in black and white; something to base it off of. Also, about the characters. So Hollywood never exaggerated a love story? No one complains but yet acknowledges real life rarely goes that way. Where is the criticism then? What, you can't be in love without a story like ""The Notebook"". Love is just as much a real thing as God but why is one held to a different standard. Maybe the movie didn't imply only Christians are righteous, perhaps it was the critics generating their own stereotypes? About alienating other faiths, I don't think that was the movies intention. I think the plot was to big and therefore the perception was there that the Muslim faith is intolerant. I have been to Iraq and Afghanistan were woman are not equal, covered head to toe, uneducated, and treated like property. Believe me, the movie went easy on the Muslim faith from what I saw. All you proclaimed Christians taking arms against the director, but where are you as thousands of Christians are dying in a Christian holocaust in Iraq, Syria, and the middle east? Perhaps the critics missed the point of the movie, which was God needs us to stand for him because WE ARE KILLING HIM. The critics of this movie were just as much a tyrant as Professor Radisson in that we all couldn't make up our mind because they decided for us this movie isn't worth our time. I saw that God was merciful and that he loves us unconditionally. I saw that you must take a risk in order to test a belief. I saw that a girl took a risk of losing everything in this world for standing up for God, not an abusive father. She could have made the easier choice and so that scene was necessary to dramatize her choice. Let's face it, is a father tolerant of all religion going to challenge his daughters belief? What about an atheist? We know other faiths challenge other faiths so it would not make sense if the scene wasn't the Muslim father and daughter of another faith. Again, in Afghanistan if that scene was real, the father wouldn't have cried. Woman get sold over there. Not to mention, it showed how ones beliefs can be oppressive without free will. With her father she had to love God, she didn't have a choice. The difference was she chose Jesus, but her fate would be the same had she denied the God her father insisted upon, or if she removed her veil. The movie waa amazing, intelligent, and sparked a debate we much needed. However, if people worry to much about offending others than what do we stand for? Anything? Not everyone can be right.

Much of the dialogue was stiff and felt forced.

The movie centers around a college professor who claims not to believe in God and forces a class to write that on paper. He makes it very clear that NOT writing the correct statement will lead to hardship. Clearly, he had tenure - though I suspect he'd be fired still at any respected U for that.
Of course, there's a new freshman who refuses to write the words on paper. His girlfriend leaves him and he is required to defend his position. Others around don't see the big deal. His faith waivers, but never fails.

The arguments for/against the existence of God are weak on both sides.
There are small side-plots that are more interesting than the main plot.
I was surprised other religions were completely ignored. In a modern University setting, there will be Buddhists, Muslims, Jews, Taoist - unless it is a religious-sect college.

Stop at the final classroom scene and this would be a five star movie...maybe add a bit of aftermath with the credits rolling about the Chinese and Muslim right after it.

The Chinese student was fine, the Muslim converting was fine, the girlfriend leaving was fine...but the anti-Christian reporter getting prayed over because of her cancer (which was obviously coming), the elderly woman sunk in the throes of dementia so badly that she cannot tell the television is off who suddenly clearly gives her son the answer to his question, the atheist professor running desperately through the rain getting hit by a car that ran a red light resulting in a fatal flailed chest giving his deathbed confession in the rainy street to a mass concert by the Newsboys with what is IMO one of the worst praise songs around because of one utterly stupid line ""My faith is dead, I need a resurrection somehow"".

Actually, the rest of the song is a pretty darn good P&W song, but given that the subject of the movie that ""God's Not Dead"", to a song that declares that the person singing this song has dead faith that needs a resurrection ""somehow""...  and this person claims to be a Christian?  Bzzt! Wrong Answer!  Well, at least if you are a Christian.  I would have let that one slide, but on the back the rest of it, the only things missing from the ending was the reporter being declared cancer free and Josh getting married to the young former Muslim convert, might as well point out the issue with the song for any Christian that wants to be singing it.",1427673600,,1810,4.652037617554859
6417238,5,B00KD5HFJG,"Gods Not Dead was produced in March 21, 2014 by the director of Harold Cronk. It is about a man, a college philosophy professor Mr. Radisson, who is being challenged by a boy, Josh, who is a big Christian and believes in God. Josh realizes what he needs to do; if he doesnt succeed, his teacher will fail him. Does Josh take the chance for God, or does he fail and stop believing in God?
Josh arrives at his college to get ready for his class. When he arrives to get his classes, the former college student said he might want to change his class. Josh said no because he didn't want to wait. The boy said okay but it was his funeral. Josh was confused, but when his teacher walked into class he knew why. Mr. Radisson told the class that the people we were learning about were atheist. Then he told his class to write three simple words, God is dead. Josh said he couldn't do it because he was a Christian. Afterwards Mr. Radisson told Josh he had three days to prove that Gods not dead. I agree with Josh, I would not want to do write something I don't believe. I don't care if I went up to prove that Gods not dead. I would love to tell the whole world what I think and believe.
The theme of this movie is that the choices you make can lead to something big. Your mind can be changed, even if it is from good to bad or bad to good. Its what you want to believe in. When we are in situations our mind automatically thinks to lie. Sometimes we actually sit there and try to change our minds. Another thing is people can be very persuasive. We just have to learn to stick with what we believe in. I think this theme could be pretty strong if people paid attention to things. I also think that it is hard to make the right choices when people are being tempted.
In the end Josh has to choose what to do. To believe that his teacher is right, or that God is not dead and he is surely alive. One way he might pass class and keep on going like nothing happened or the other way; he might get failed by Mr. Radisson because he didn't succeed. Which path will Josh choose? Will it be the right one, or lead to one hot mess?",1427673600,,2116,4.0889423076923075

6417244,3,B00KD5HFJG,"College freshman takes a Philosophy class to satisfy his elective. The professor claims to be an atheist and tells the class that they must write down that ""God is dead"" and pass it in so they can just jump into the philosophical stuff that comprises of authors/thinkers who are mainly atheists. The one kid doesn't. He said he can't deny God. So the professor tells him that he must debate him on the existence of God and make him believe in God or he gets a 0 for 30% of his over all grade. The class has to judge who won the debate.

While I can't say how things will be in 20 years most professors wouldn't dare do this as they would be reprimanded in some way. Yes it is true. Doesn't mean that they wouldn't try or sneak it in here and there. And that is what I thought this movie was about--the bias in our universities/colleges. I have experienced it in obtaining my 3, almost 4 degrees, more than once.  I was downgraded for arguing against their craziness. Others who were Christians just said nothing to get by . . . ""go along to get along"" I think the saying is. So that is what I thought this was about. And it would have been a VERY worthwhile movie, if they had stuck to this one point on this one subject. They could have taken their time and really developed a powerful . . . what do liberals call it . . . ""teaching moment"". But they decided to make the overall message in many ways by many points outside this one central example that God is alive and how important it is to know that . . . to accept that. So it is commendable. They did do a good job of interweaving the many different subplots/points on this subject into one movie in that the characters who were involved in telling these many points were connected in some way. That was nice. But they could have done that in many other movies and done those topics/subplots better justice as well. For example, the Muslim girl who was eventually disowned by her family for becoming a Christian. What a powerful point. But how much more powerful it would have been if it was its own movie. They just simply tried to do too much in my opinion in this movie. And therefore they kinda blunted the powerful points each sub-plot was contributing to the overall theme of the movie. But getting back to the bias in the college classroom . . . I know from my own examples that they could have shown in greater detail how important an issue this is to Christians. How it impacts their lives. Etc. Instead they just created this explosive unrealistic dramatic moment between the guy and his girlfriend and made it seem 1) unimportant and 2) unbelievable when actually it is a realistic cause/effect but could have been developed better to explain it better. The fate of the professor was not ""melodramatic"" as some would suggest. It is a very very powerful moment that every Christian understands all too well the importance of. I had a friend who  live in CA. Claimed she was a Christian but was chasing this liberal CA lifestyle as hard as she could. She was one of those Christians that ""had a Bible somewhere  . . . . but is just so hard to get into . . . "" she said when I told her to read her Bible when she was going through a rough patch. Anyway, she said that ""some Baptists"" came to her door and wanted to invite her to their church. She let them in and they asked her if she was ""saved"". Etc. She said she got flustered. And I asked why. She said she didn't want to think about dying and what happened afterwards. That it was too serious. I honestly laughed.

Christians don't need to be Bible scholars to have the ability to give a good ""apologetic"" (reasoned statement or argument) for our faith. Those whose lives have been transformed by the Lord Jesus Christ have their personal testimonies to share with others. There is no better explanation for the hope that is in a believer than a life transformed by our Savior!",1427500800,,746,4.452554744525547
6417259,2,B00KD5HFJG,"As a Christian, I've found Islam's view of God has helped me think more clearly about God and our relationship to God. I asked a Muslim scholar whether, when God forgives us, God changes towards us or we change towards God. He said it is we who change toward God because God never changes.

God never changes. Don't we Christians believe this? Don't we believe God is eternal, that God is Creator of all that exists, that God created the laws of nature, time and space, that God is the God of every living thing and every planet in the universe, and that God's love for us never changes?

This movie misrepresented Christianity and it misrepresented God. It made God small and prejudiced. God is good, so why must the atheist proclaim faith in God before he dies or be rejected by God? God is God of the entire Universe, so why must the name of Jesus be used? It's possible to know the Spirit of Christ without being Christian or having heard the name of Jesus.

Yes, it makes a difference if we are able to accept God's unconditional love for us in this lifetime. It heals our spirits. But God created time, so why would a soul be lost if it didn't know God in this lifetime? God's love never fails.

How do we know these things about God? I know them through my experience of God's unconditional love which I know through the Bible, Christ, which my Jewish friends know through the Torah, which my Muslim friends know through the Qu'ran, and which we all know through prayer, our faith communities, our traditions, our experiences, and reason. None of us know this through science. Scientists should stay out of theology unless they wish to get a degree in it and argue from a position of faith. Theologians should stay out of science. Reason tells us where the boundaries are. Some are clear-cut, but others are not. No matter how smart Stephen Hawkings is about physics, he has no credentials when it comes to reasoning about God.

Let's get one thing straight: Allah is Arabic for the English word, God. There is no God but God. Muslims, Christians, Jews, people of other faiths, agnostics and atheists are, on average, equally good, equally bad, and equally loved by God.",1427500800,5,2177,4.5717948717948715

6417261,5,B00KD5HFJG,Excellent,1427500800,,9,9.0
6417262,1,B00KD5HFJG,"Wow, how bad can this be I thought before I started watching it, and I wasn't disappointed. You have the  humanist reporter badgering the poor Ducky Dynasty star about duck hunting, You have the atheist lecturer who for someone reason makes everyone sign a note agreeing ""God is Dead."" The student who refuses to sign, Josh Wheaton, it later tells some pastor that of the 80 or so people in there, none of them have really heard about Christianity? Really? None of them have heard about Christianity and Jesus? Did they wake up from a 2000 year coma?

Wheaton in his debate about a god states that the Big Bang is evidence that the Bible got it right, because the Big Bang has a beginning to the universe and the Bible has a beginning. But Genesis is not about a Big Bang 13.7 billion or so years ago. It is a story of about 6000 or so years ago a deity making a flat earth that rested on pillars. A story where the sun and stars are made after light. Where insects don't have the right amount of legs. Hardly a representation of Genesis.

Second, those fundamentalist Christians who like this movie, do not believe there was a Big Bang. So is Wheaton arguing for an old earth Christianity or even Deism (a god as a first cause) and if so, doesn't that go against the beliefs of those who pay to watch this movie?

 Josh Wheaton by the way, is asked by a fellow student, who created or what caused the bible? An excellent question by the way. Of course the response to this by theists/Christians is always, their god is uncaused. Really, what evidence for this exists? None. Wheaton asks, well aren't atheists burdened by the same question, what created the universe, just as Christians/theists are burdened by what created or designed a god?

This is a part where I feel like slapping my head with my hand. We know a universe exists. It is there. It is all around us, in fact, we are in it now. We don't have the same knowledge of a god. One can always put in place of a god and say greenish invisible pink elephant with the paws of a lion. If someone says, who created this strange being, I guess someone like Wheaton could always respond, well doesn't the universe (which we know exists) need a creator, just like the greenish invisible pink elephant with the paws of a lion? See how silly this gets?

Wheaton later states that Stephen Hawking is using circular thinking when Hawking writes, ""Since there is a law such as gravity, the universe can and will create itself out of nothing."" No, that isn't a circular argument. It is stating that a cause, that being gravity, inevitably leads to a universe. Maybe Hawking should have stated it that way, but the way he wrote it is more poetic, but means just the same.

Wheaton, quoting a Christian apologist states that evolution happened to fast at one point, which I think he means the so called Cambrian Explosion, though that is not mentioned in the movie. Actually the Cambrian explosion still took many, many millions of years for its' relative quick pace of evolution. Changes in the environment plus competition can favor great evolutionary change. For example faster antelopes lead to faster lions which lead to faster antelopes. If antelopes had no predators it wouldn't matter how fast or slow they might be. The competition in the early Cambrian favored fast (in terms of millions of years) change.

The ""evil"" atheist professor, played by Kevin Sobo has a great line in the movie. ""The most committed atheists were former Christians who took the blinders off"". I was never a Christian, but a lot of atheists were Christians and like Neo from the Matrix, they come to understand that the Matrix (like a god) is a delusion.

Of course Wheaton states in one of his debates that without a god, there can be no basis for morality. Leaving aside that the bible tells of a very, very, very immoral god who commands killing disbelievers and even so called disobedient children, there can be no basis for morality with a god. Is morality the whims of a god? If so, no absolute basis. Does a god use reason & empathy to derive moral rules, than a god is not necessary. Just any being who can utilize those tools.

The professor in the end, Kevin Sabo, is basically killed by Jesus/God. See a car hits Sabo and a guy demands that Sabo find Jesus before he dies, than instead of say, give first aid. See Jesus put this guy who prays with Sabo by Sabo after he gets hit. Maybe Jesus could have placed a paramedic there instead, but that's just me.

The fact is that every atheist in this movie is an Jerk who finds religion before they die. It is just a strawman attack on atheism and atheists. Kevin Sobo seems not to be able to answer the weakest arguments by this student. But I am sure the movie was beloved by many on the Christian rightwing.",1427500800,,4797,4.501149425287356

Giving the movie a high rating condones the use of very simple and negative stereotypes of other cultures, religions and beliefs. Certainly it is not wrong to support your belief system, however doing so in the context of such negative and incorrect perceptions of those that do not have similar beliefs serves only to distance others from what the movie is trying to promote. Furthermore, it furthers the development of a stereotype of christians as self righteous, racist and shallow in their perception of the world. This movie could have been an excellent avenue for promoting christianity as the premise of a philosophical challenge to religion in a college course is an excellent forum for promoting your belief system. Unfortunately the dialog is simplistic,the characters are simplistic, the philosophical arguments are also simplistic (and unchallenged) and the portrayal of individuals who may be of alternate belief systems or wavering christians is mean spirited at best and entirely inaccurate- unchristian like behavior on the part of the writers dressed in self righteous clothing.  If you cannot examine this aspect of the movie and instead condone it with positive ratings it implies that all of the negativity and stereotypical perspectives portrayed in this movie are in alignment with your understanding of Christianity and of your world view. Certainly Jesus and Christianity deserve better as does the movie- a lost opportunity to elevate the world's perception of Christianity. This movie certainly leaves the impression of Christians of a certain perspective just giving themselves a pat on the back while slamming the door in the face of others. Might want to re-think your strategy if your intent is to proselytize and convert. It is encouraging that among the negative reviewers are thinking, caring and intelligent Christians.

Yet the film is a disservice to Christians abroad as it equally states that God's not Dead, but your false God is Dead.

The movie touches on but then quickly departs from the purpose of religious institutions. These structures are the moral compass of our interactions with each other. In its entirety, no one structure is correct and over hundreds and thousands of years they evolve to fit the needs of the ""believers"". Society (Governance) and religion are intertwined with each other to the extend that we, as Americans, acknowledge that the two must be treated separately, if not, then you get a state like Utah.

Two stars earned, decent acting and great propaganda. The movie will challenge your faith if you are on the fence about believing but in retrospect this movie is about saving the Professor and not about proving or disproving if God is Dead.

It must have been all Christian fence riders in that Philosophy 150 class.",1427414400,,1282,4.871559633027523

6417289,5,B00KD5HFJG,"I lost my mom in a car wreck in 1997 and my dad was murdered in 1994. I was born in 1990. When I was a little girl I didn't know much about God. I didn't even know what He was or how he worked. After the death of my mother, I came to live with my maternal grandparents who introduced me to God. Still at such a young age I didn't know what ""God"" meant. Was it this great man in the sky who could perform magic? If so could he bring back my Mom or my Dad? Could He fix all the wrong that had gone on in my short life? As I learned more about God, I realized that He wasn't a magician and He couldn't magically bring life back to my parents BUT He could be my friend. I remember being in my room at such a young age talking to God like He was right there by my side listening to me. I played barbies and talked to Him. I colored and talked to Him. I would ask Him to tell my Mom and Dad that I love them and I missed them. Fast forward to my middle and high school years. I remember realizing that my parents were missing all of the major accomplishments in my life. They missed my middle school graduation, my njhs induction, all my award ceremonies. They missed my highschool gradution and for a time I began to wonder why God would do this to me. I began to become angry with God. Why would He leave me with my grandparents who were aging and with no one to help me take care of them. How could he leave me without my parents, both of them?! I started my first year of college 1 week after my highschool graduation and I struggled not only financially but physically as well. My bones ached and so did my pocket book. I remember one day just sitting in the college library bathroom and crying because I didn't know what to do anymore. I started to find similar people in my class who were struggling like I was. I didn't know what else to do but to pray at this point that I could find the strength to make it physically and mentally. After all my grandparents were getting older and I wanted to make them proud before they died. I prayed for months wondering how I would pay for school or how I would make the old 1990 Chevy Silverado my grandpa gave me to get me through school. I remember the day when I got a call from financial services at the University and they said they had found out that my mother had a life insurance policy that in the event of her death would pay for my college for 4 years and I was offered work study. I took the work study and used the money from moms life insurance to cover my expenses and tuition in college. I made it out alive at the age of 22 with my RN-BSN. God is not a magician but He will take care of your needs. He may not always give us what we want but he will always provide what we need. As long as we call on Him, He will always be there for us. The answer to my question of ""God can you bring my Mom and Dad back"" was a no but He showed me that they have always been there for me because He had it all planned out. It was always going to be His way. I still believe that God has a plan for all of us if we simply let Him in. Let your heart be open so that He may find His way in. My grandparents are still alive today and I know that is also part of Gods plan. I feel God when I pray. I know He is there listening to me, guiding me and providing for me. I help people everyday and I even hold some of their hands when its their time. I found my calling all because the Lord provided for me because I was willing to reach out to him, to open my heart to His plan for my life. We all have a choice. No one demands that you believe in Him, not even Him. He just gives us the opportunity to accept Him or not. Its a choice. Its your choice.",1427414400,6,3688,3.8796296296296298

This movie was made by people who are scared.  Scared of reality.  Afraid to look out into a Universe of beauty and wonder.  Scared, ignorant people who have been brought up to be lazy and just leave their thinking to men who have been dead for thousands of years when they had no idea why night became day and what brought the seasons.

Kevin Sorbo brings star power and quality to his role as the atheistic professor who is challenged by a Christian student.  The interplay between the two along with other characters developed throughout the film provide a suspenseful dramatic experience for the viewer. I would recommend this film on its own merits as a reasonably good piece of dramatic film making.

6417326,1,B00KD5HFJG,"This is an awful movie in pretty much every regard.  As a philosophy major, I can really only laugh at the ridiculously weak arguments presented by all sides in this film.  There isn't a complete argument present in this red herring if a flick.  Sorbo does a great job playing a caricature of a scary, dogmatic, atheist philosophy professor, but a terrible job of playing an actual, intelligent, philosopher.  The problem is, no professor would actually behave like that.  What good does it do get someone to agree with a position (out of deference to a position of authority) without first making the case for the position?  Plus, the shortcut that Sorbo proposes will leave all of his students unprepared for their next level of philosophy classes.  Josh, in his arguments for a god, doesn't even attempt to address which god favors.  He makes a reference to the god that Christians believe in, but that still leaves a lot of room for disagreement as to the aspects of that god.  Also, both Josh and Sorbo commit multiple logical fallacies in their arguments for either position.  Many viewers will be left with the ridiculous notion that these are the best arguments that either side can put forward, which is patently absurd.  Bad philosophy, bad character development, bad plotlines, and bad acting, all combine to make this movie unwatchable.",1427155200,23,1348,4.894273127753304

I watched the movie because it was I Prime and it is always nice to see what Christians and other theists are up to these days.  This film has the same problems that other modern religious movies have, it is... not very deep.  The river runs wide, but not very deep.  Basically the film did not confront any questions or arguments.  It portrays people like me only as angry, mean and spiteful, that said I know of some atheists and such that are exactly as portrayed.  The movie has some prejudices in it, like the girls father who made her wear the Hijab, beating her then kicking her out, did you want us to assume the guy was Muslim?  Are you saying the only god that is not dead is the Christian god?  So, my biggest criticism is that the emotional universe is limited, has some prejudice in it, everyone is thin, no one wearing glassed, just... unreal.

Kevin Sorbo does a nice job as the mean and arrogant atheist philosophy professor.  The film attempts to contrast (in simplified form) the classic arguments for and against the existence of the Christian God.  The problem is that at the bottom both the scientific view and that of beleivers reduces to: Because I Have Faith.  That is why the argument has been going on without resolution for centuries.  The film portrays non-believers as  condesending (always) contemptuous (sometimes) and cruel (occasionally). Unlike most films it shows believers as happier, nicer and more content.  There are no ranting religious loonies.  Some people have complained about this.  That is like going to a steakhouse and complaining because they serve meat.",1426982400,,884,5.176056338028169

6417386,5,B00KD5HFJG,"This is one of the best Christian films I've seen. The acting, direction and filming are first class but most other Christian films meet the same standard.

What sets this apart are the multiple threads in the plot. There are six main characters, each presenting a different relationship people have with God. Together they offer more of a viewing experience than is provided in films with one or two threads. I recommend this both for a personal and as a witnessing vehicle.

The plots include the interaction between a young Christian couple where one is committed to standing for his faith but the other is willing to follow an expedient path in order to meet standards imposed by the world. The college professor became embittered because his childhood prayer for his sick mother went unanswered. Another couple separated when the girl discovered her friend was totally self-absorbed and abandoned her in her hour of need. Another involved an Arab girl, cast out because of her Christian faith. Another confronted a girl who was in a relationship founded on her need for human support rather than the relationship God offers. Last is a pastor who learns a lesson in prayer. Actually there are several other minor characters that help fill in where helpful.

The plot switches adroitly between the characters. It is excellent.

Added 3/12: Several reviewers comment on the classroom defense of Christianity. Those with a scientific background were disappointed. True it is a little weak but that is not the strength of the film - as my review reveals. I don't like attacking any worthwhile attempt. We all do our best and it accomplishes more to dwell on the positive rather than the negative. Our reward comes when our actions hide us behind God.",1426118400,8,1750,4.922033898305084

6417389,5,B00KD5HFJG,"I am NOT a big movie goer, nor would I normally seek out a Christian movie, yet I came across this flick while clicking through the cable stations.  I was first captivated by the landmarks, as it was filmed in Houston... I recognize my hometown.  Very quickly the plot reeled me in and I could not break away from it.  I just LOVE movies that manage to assemble all the subplots to come together crisply.  The message, of course, is ominous and clear.  Without ruining the plot for you I wanted to say that the scene with the ""person"" (I will not say who) lying on the asphalt after the car accident.... was played out in true life by ME.  While my life was in danger, I was not dying at the time... an angel did come save me from the intense pain of a broken back.
At the end... SEND THE TEXT MESSAGE.  :)  Just do it.  I did.  The funniest most wonderful things happened with each person I sent it to.  You will see.",1426032000,7,918,4.159090909090909
6417390,5,B00KD5HFJG,Excellent film! The gospel is properly communicated and defended. The film also does an excellent job of portraying the realities of suffering for Christ. My final thought is that it shows how Christ forgives the sinner and gives salvation to the humble person who repents at any point of their life.,1426032000,,300,4.901960784313726

There is a reason for that. This is a great story. Get yourself a copy and share it. You won't be sorry.",1425945600,,400,4.418918918918919

6417400,2,B00KD5HFJG,"The story looks interesting, if implausible. A Christian freshman student Josh (Shane Harper) takes a philosophy class. The teacher Professor Raddison (Kevin Sorbo), who happens to be an atheist, tells the students to sign a declaration that ""God is dead."" Josh refuses. (No professors would be allowed to order the students to do such a thing, but lets not talk about it.) The professor, though not very happy about that, still gives Josh a chance to show in the class that God exists.

We know from the very beginning where the film is going, and which side will win. As a moviegoer I am interested rather in the process of the debate than in the result. Sadly, the debate (and all the subplots) is disappointing in more than one way. Without revealing too much, I can say that what is revealed after three debates, is very personal, having little to do with whether God is dead or alive.

But more disappointing is the cardboard characters of the subplots  an arrogant blogger, a female Muslim student, a male exchange student from China and Radissons girlfriend  the simplistic ways they are portrayed, and how they all change too suddenly. By the time this happened, sorry, I lost interest in what was going on.",1425945600,3,1216,4.748815165876778

6417408,5,B00KD5HFJG,"As much as I did not  like ""Heaven is for Real"" I loved this movie.  It has a very clear, and I do mean VERY CLEAR message.  If you aren't sure, the message is, God is NOT dead.  As I often tell my younger son, people who genuinely are atheist are typically not so vehement about it.  If you don't believe in something, you are typically not angry at it.  Others who have reviewed this movie have completely missed this.  The professor is not atheist.  He is furious at God.  He does everything he does to hurt God.  It is not about his disbelief, it is about his rage.  I thought Kevin Sorbo was just amazing as the deeply hurt professor.  Spoiler alert*******  Stop reading if you don't want to know.  There is a minister who is part of each of the stories, and his work is interwoven throughout.  He is kept in town because God needs him to be there to offer salvation in his last moments to the professor.  And for people who say, ""yeah, the professor just believes so he won't go to hell.""  Duh! That is why we all trust in Jesus.  God is so merciful that even when he is near death, God gives the professor one last chance.  The professor does believe in God. He just needs to get past his rage and disappointment.",1425859200,,1220,4.226086956521739

6417493,5,B00KD5HFJG,"At first I was hesitant because there was no option for rental, but this movie was worth my $13.  In fact, I watched it twice in the same day!

A varied and intriguing cast of characters (those who found them unbelievable must not have any controlling people in their lives--the characterization was SPOT ON) whose stories are brilliantly intertwined to give us a bird's-eye view of how our lives fit together in God's plan, and how what seems like an annoying inconvenience or a small, brave decision can have unimaginable ripples.  Again, to those who wanted to see more of the classroom, I would say this story isn't just about Josh making a presentation--it's about how a lot of people's ""yesses"" to God combined in a symphony to save a professor's soul.  The beauty of the story is in its scope and intricacy.  As a former-atheist-turned-Christian, I recognized myself and people I've known in so many of the characters.  Their stories are simply truth--beautiful truth.  I give it an A+!",1424476800,,993,4.805882352941176

6417500,5,B00KD5HFJG,"Worth watching.  Inspired and well done.  While maybe not a ""perfect"" movie it strongly, relevantly and convincingly stands up to very, very real forces at work in the world.  Kevin Sorbo's character is highly convincing but all the more relevant when you read how many young people say they lose faith and stop going to church in college.  The numbers are staggering - as in 80% to 30%.  And this is from expensive institutions that are supposed to be guiding and educating young lives.  Instead colleges have all too often become the realm of materialists and intellectuals bullying kids right out of their beliefs.  I think a lot of people know what I'm talking about and if you do perhaps you will join me in loving this movie and huge kudos to the maker of it.",1424390400,,765,4.580882352941177

6417539,5,B00KD5HFJG,I absolutely love this movie. One of my favorites. It's hard to find good Christian movies these days that tell truth. Granite it is not the Bible and I'm sure there are holes and gaps but that's why it's important for us Christians to be in the word each and every day so that we will have the discernment to know when something is not truth. With that said if you have any live ones I need to hear truth this is a good movie to start them on,1423440000,2,443,3.9887640449438204

6417558,5,B00KD5HFJG,I absolutely enjoyed this movie. Kevin Sorbo was a very good actor in his part. I'm glad I purchased a hard copy. I have already shared it with my sister and she liked it too. It is not completely the typical predictable movie. There is a twist in there. These are the kinds of films I like to support by buying them and sharing. Sorbo was very convincing as the creep professor who was all brain and had a bad attitude against God to the extreme of forcing students to agree with him in exchange for a passing grade. One student stands up to him and has convincing things to say rather than just sit back and sign in agreement with other students and instructor to grab the passing grade.,1423094400,,689,4.3076923076923075

It also shows how if we are truly to follow the Christ who was crucified for us, we must sacrifice sometimes in order to stand up for the truth we believe in. That message is true when the main character must lose his girlfriend, or the Christian girlfriend of the atheistic professor must break off the relationship. A fantastic film over all. It was truly inspiring. Some of the atheistic criticism for this movie revolves around the professor being so mean to the Christian student.

6417575,5,B00KD5HFJG,"Wonderful flick exposing the ""politically correct"" persecution of Christian Americans in 21st century American campuses. Some leftists have surreptitiously (and sometimes openly) tried to minimise the quality of the movie; I surmise they don't like the truth when it is inconvenient for their political agenda so from their standpoint, the less people who view it the better. I find it is a good expos of the willingness of some people in the American left to trample on the letter and the spirit of the American constitution in America's universities; after the movie you can see a list of the many legal cases won by Christian students for harassment in campus.
I found it entertaining in spite of having been made with a low budget. Just plain human drama without visual frills. A Christian message well delivered in the spiritual vacuum we live in. After seeing it three times over the last year its defects stand out more; but its message is just as fresh as the first day.",1422748800,,978,4.8273809523809526

Secondly, it's clearly propaganda, all of the pro Christian characters were flawless, yet, the atheist characters were horrible people.  I actually had never even heard of this movie, was clicking through PPV looking for something to watch, and it seemed interesting. And then I started out feeling extremely sorry for the student, thinking okay, he has every right to believe in his Faith, and should not be forced to deny his personal beliefs. And then the movie turned quickly toward this is complete nonsense, that trashes Muslims, Athiests, and does so using scenarios that would never happen, unless someone put them up to it for yet more propaganda.",1422489600,3,830,5.043795620437956

6417589,2,B00KD5HFJG,"I'm a practicing Christian before anyone says anything. With that said, God's Not Dead is generally a failure.

There are a few good things in the film. The lead actor, Shane Harper, is quite good. The Duck Dynasty cameo also made me laugh. Also, the movie isn't super-preachy and actually gives some convincing evidence for God's existence. The movie is successful in those counts.

However, the movie fails as a story, and that is what drives my two star rating. First, the character Professor Radisson is underdeveloped. He's a one dimensional character and a staunch atheist. If his character is more complex (that is, if he struggles with his faith and isn't just a staunch atheist), the ending becomes more powerful. The ending (in which Radisson dies and-SURPRISE!-becomes a Christian) is tacky and weak because of his one-dimensionality.

Another story failure is that it has too many subplots which add nothing to the tale. The filmmakers should've deleted the sub-plots involving Josh Wheaton's girlfriend, the pastor sub-plot (which involves numerous broken cars), the sub-plot of the ""Muslim"" girl who's actually a Christian, and the sub-plot of Radisson's girlfriend. If the movie deletes those sub-plots and focuses more on Josh's fight against Professor Radisson, the story becomes more powerful. Instead, the main plot gets undermined by the unneeded sub-plots. You know you got something wrong with a movie when you have FOUR unnecessary sub-plots in it. One main story and a sub-plot is enough.

Lastly, unrealistic characters hurt the plot. Besides Radisson's one dimensional character, I also found Josh's girlfriend to be unconvincing. She breaks up with him merely because he decides to challenge Radisson. I can tell you that a real girlfriend (she supposedly dated Josh for years) would never leave a guy for such a superficial reason. Also, the lawyer boyfriend of a female character is unrealistic-his uncaring attitude towards her (after she tells him she has cancer) was unrealistic and stupid. Finally, Radisson's girlfriend is a Christian, yet she co-habits with him. If she were really a Christian, she wouldn't be living with him.

Avoid this movie. Watch Fireproof instead.",1422489600,,2206,5.255681818181818

6417641,4,B00KD5HFJG,"First of all,let me point this out:God's Not Dead is a movie and not a documentary. So people anticipating something realistic and not exaggerated will definitely be disappointed. Also,those who are expecting a reasonable explanation of the existence of God will definitely be turned off by it especially atheists,agnostics,apostates and most especially non-Christians considering that it is a movie made by a Christian production. So I can understand why many people disliked the movie and does not consider it logical nor reasonable.

God's Not Dead is an ensemble drama that involves primarily an evangelical Christian freshman whose faith is challenged by a Philosophy professor who is an atheist or better yet an apostate - a former Christian that no longer believes in God. They engage in classroom discussion. Also involved in the drama are following: the professor's girlfriend who happens to be a Christian;a Chinese student in the Philosophy class who discovers Jesus;a Moslem student who secretly converts into Christianity; an evangelical Christian pastor;a successful businessman who is an atheist; and a Christian mother who has dementia. The theme of doubt and disbelief has become the main focus among these characters and how it affects their actions and principles in life.

This Christian movie was surprisingly entertaining. No question about it. Although it was obviously simplistic especially when the Philosophy class made the decision that there is indeed the existence of God and the conversion of the Philosophy professor upon his death to believing into Jesus. Also,the story does not intend to be extremely complex as it was obviously a Christian movie so placing something reasonable or positive as to not believing in God should not be expected.

In the end,if a person wants something about a worthwhile debate between the existence of God,this movie should not be included in the list for it does not hide anything about it being a Christian movie.",1421539200,5,1980,5.2993630573248405

6417643,4,B00KD5HFJG,"Feel good movie.  Since the culture of Christianity is pretty much ignored in movies, too much is expected of this one movie....not meant to be a final argument about the existence of God, or a description of all atheists or about all professors of philosophy. Can be seen as an attempt to establish a base-line tolerance for faith in a secular context, especially where beliefs clearly are relevant.

In the early 90's I was the only student willing to challenge an abusive, hate-filled atheist professor of American Literature and  dropped out of the class after being beat up for about 6 classes. This does go on.  At the time I was not ""evangelical"" Christian, but respected my religious background. I am Unitarian Universalist, liberal Christian.  I was in the Mid-West.  I know I was surrounded by mostly ""Christians"" in the class. I saw myself as standing up for them more than for myself.  It was as if the fear of authority, and especially one's career and grades trumped everything. This in itself makes the movie say something profound and true.

Perhaps no professor has ever literally asked students to sign a ""God is Dead"" statement. The movie was dramatizing an experience:  the experience that the modern university does not welcome faith as a a realty that involves intellect.

Abuse of beliefs does not have to be an initiation into academia in the modern world.  I found that to be a waste of my time, and not an honest objective approach to the study of literature or philosophy.  I also found it cowardly and anti-intellectual: the students were not encouraged to use their heads, but to swallow whatever the professor dished out, no matter how distorted by personal animus.

Now for the other side:  Muslims believe in God too.  Yes some Muslims convert, fine, but there were a few statements that assumed God as a Christian thing.

The handling of the Alzheimer's mother and old age is too LOADED. This was not an educated carefully-thought-through portrayal. Stereotypical attitudes of superiority about life and death just continue the cultural WAR instead of advancing the dialogue.

Christians are not more loving than non-Christians. Faith challenges Christians to love. Taking extreme absolute stances about ""LIFE"" is not love. The movie encouraged superiority stances in the face of a very complicated societal issues involving our crazy healthcare system, money, the law, individuals struggling to keep up with technology/science....  It did not take on the religious right view that rabidly fights for living at all costs....something that actually contradicts the traditional Christian view of death as birth into a new life and acceptance of death as something not to fear.

I liked the rock concert ending.  I liked the Kevin Sorbo character and the other actors...the vulnerability and lack of sophistication is true to real people; I liked seeing that acceptance of ordinary people, bumbling but trying to help each other in their pain, that may be the most important part of the message of Christianity.

The student Christian did right and is to be admired but is not mature.  He is a young person who has not experienced many things and is clearly developing himself as a lawyer for Christianity....that is where Christianity in the culture seems to be going...use the law....That is something, but a faith cannot be centrally about winning.  Because if you win, sometimes you lose bigger (think Constantine and much of church history).

All in all enjoyable: raises questions -- emotional yet intelligent movie.  We just need a lot more movies in this genre -- exploring the false ideas generated by the cultural wars, so we can get unstuck from simple inappropriate black-and-white thinking on both sides extremes.",1421539200,,3756,5.048622366288493

Sure, the main atheist professor was highly antagonistic to the Christian faith, maybe too much. But, I personally have experienced this kind of thing.  Indeed, the secular college environment is very hostile to the Christian faith, at least according to my experience and much of the experiences I've heard about from other people. I believe  the Muslim father  was not presented as some heartless, mean ogre you'll just have to watch and see for yourself.

6417664,4,B00KD5HFJG,"What up, world?

I just caught this flick at the urging of a friend and I'm glad I did.

The title really captures the essence of what the film is about. In our modern, American society, where the media is dominated by trends and messaging of moral commentary--we have strangely departed, in large, from the traditional beliefs of our forefathers and the identity of the country in its nascent stages. The conservative agenda tends to disapprove of the course of change in ethics of our country while the liberal agenda tends to disapprove--citing that there is not enough change. The country is really starting to stratify itself into diametrically-opposing groups and while this has always been the way of the world, with the emphasis on ""identity"" in our culture, we are almost urged, from birth, to clique into one group or another. It's funny to me, that people have such fragile identities, that they fear brushes with different ideologies might shatter what they think they know to be true, that hearing an opposing side's point of view might not leave their beliefs intact.

And this movie dives into the high-tension topic of intelligent design vs. evolution. Anybody familiar with debates, speech, and philosophy should know what apologetics are but in case the reader is unfamiliar, it's essentially the discipline of logic and argument. Carefully constructing an argument in such a way that it supports itself with sound reason, logic, and clearly-established principle. Any arguments predicated on circular logic defeat themselves as they rely on their own declaration of truth to stand in the court of logic.

This film has two parts to it, the portrayal of very real apologetics arguments, for a book that shares the same title as the film, and then the surrounding drama of the lives of the characters who participate in the fictionalized portrayal of a freshman college student who challenges a philosophy professor who unabashedly challenges the notion of God but is required by the very academic institution for whom he works to discuss the very notion which he defies, AND THE PLOT THICKENS. So at the beginning of each introduction to philosophy course the professor urges his students to write ""God is dead"" on a piece of paper, endorsed with the students' signatures to avoid meeting the requirement to discuss it in his course. Obviously one student challenges this practice and he undertakes the endeavor to debate the professor on the topic, mutually agreeing to allow his fellow classmates to settle the claim of who is victorious in the debate. This sets the stage for the rest of the film and the group of characters who are touched by the views of the professor and freshman student in their lives. Some have more far-reaching impacts in their lives than others. There are some predictable ""twists"" but the overall enjoyability of the film isn't really affected negatively by the predictability of the story.

It's actually really intriguing as a good portion of the film covers the apologetics debate of both sides, from the professor and the freshman student, capturing very popular positions in the ongoing debate of intelligent design vs. evolution. I found it refreshing to see sound arguments and supporting evidence from both sides and how they stand against each opposing view's stance on the topic. If you enjoy a good debate, I think you might find this movie pretty interesting. The fictionalized drama didn't add much to the film, in my humble opinion but it did serve to entertain in the ways drama has a tendency to do.

The film was produced by an organization that supports an array of people who challenge institutions' regulatory practices or academic bylaws prohibiting pro Christian dogmas. So there is definitely an obvious agenda with the film but I still enjoyed it.

Surrounding the apologetics portion of the film is a portrait of what many Christians experience in their lives through the course of interaction with non-believers and the academic community, which largely denies a pro theist position (GOD theory).

If you ever find yourself volunteering to comment in the midst of a 'God vs. science' debate--then I think you'll find this movie very interesting.

There are some very compelling arguments stated in the film and I think anybody could identify with either side in the film's debate.

Not recommended for huge critics of acting as the main star power is fulfilled by Dean Cain and Kevin Sorbo, b-list actors at best but they served their role in the film and the rest of the characters on-screen are relative unknowns in hollywood.

At the end of the day, however, the value in this film is delivered by the contents of the argument in this debate and not by any of the actual acting or fictionalized stories.  I'm of the school of thought to trust but verify (Reagan FTW) so I feel enlightened but nevertheless compelled to cross research the arguments of the film.  Already got the book in my hand, as of yesterday.  :)

If this sounds like a film for you--I recommend it!  I know I enjoyed it!

6417714,1,B00KD5HFJG,"I gave this movie a shot, as the premise sounded like it would debate both sides. Pretty much portrayed all the atheists and non-Christian as first class dicks.  I expected too much.

The explanation of morality was way out of line.  ""For Christians, the fixed point of morality, what constitutes right and wrong, is a straight line that leads directly to god.  With no god, there's no real reason to be moral. There's no standard of what moral behavior is. For Christians, lying, cheating, stealing are forbidden.  If god does not exist, then everything is permissible.  Not only permissible but pointless.  Our lives, and ultimately our deaths, have no more consequence than that of a goldfish.""  So if you don't believe in god, you have no humanity or sense of right and wrong?  *shakin mah head*

And to top it off, the Muslim father, after discovering his daughter listening to Christian scripture, beats her, drags her outside and locked the door.  I guess that's the equivalent of  the Christian parents who disown their offspring if they're gay.  There's reality for ya.  Put some of that in the movie to balance it out.

I really wanted to hear the proof, and some of it made me think of it in a way I had not before. But the anti-everyone else BS made it invalid.",1420502400,4,1273,4.645739910313901

This is a trend in our country today and it ignores history. A key question to think about is: when the christian believer reaches his death and if he is wrong, what does it matter, but  when an atheist/agnostic reaches his death and he has been wrong in his belief does it not really matter? This conflict was presented well and was thought provoking.",1420416000,2,845,4.760273972602739

So the next time someone (atheists) tells you that Christians are dumb, let them know they aren't speaking the truth.

This movie also shows how people need God when they come face-to-face with death.  It is easy to ignore God when things are good.  When you see an atheist, show them some compassion.",1420156800,,489,4.574712643678161

6417755,5,B00KD5HFJG,"First I think this movie has a strong message in it, unfortunately there seems to be some issues the way its being viewed...some people say it portrays atheists as evil, vile, etc and christians as perfect and happy with no problems in the world.  I however say it portrays both sides.  If you read into the spoiler section I've written below it might help clear up just what I'm talking about.  I highly suggest watching the movie and if you think it deserves less then a 3 you may want to read my take on it.

*Spoiler Section*
One thing missed I think is the fact that the Josh's girlfriend *Christian* completely abandoned him and his fight for God was missed.  Not one would stand up to fight for God?? Is he happy about losing his girlfriend??? okay and the classroom of students...  I'm sure there was more then one in the class that believed...what was it 80 students or so estimated??  Christians ignored their faith.  Why is it that the professor being christian as a boy is seen as a vile atheist, he wasn't a vile atheist to begin with was he??? He had a change of heart at the last moment.  It shows a christian life that got off track, much like Josh's girlfriend.  The church minister and his friend had a bit of trouble, but it happened with good reason.

It included the chinese guy whom wasn't a believer.  He was intrigued, he wasn't vile and nothing bad happened to him...the whole classroom, they weren't vile even though they signed the paper saying they didn't believe (atheist).  They came in with questions and made the choice in the end they did.  Okay...was it realistic that nearly everyone changed from non-believer to believer in the end...probably not, but in the beginning it was the opposite.  We as people lose sight of things and whats important even people of religion.  The muslim dad whom hit his daughter and dragged her out broke down crying as it caused conflicts with his personal faith and his daughter whom he loved.  Actually the muslim daughter had to make her choice as well and although a believer she suffered being shunned by her own dad.

 What about the girl with cancer she was always happy and on the go, but she had cancer so how could she love?  She wasn't evil and vile she just felt outcasted and alone especially after the big business lover of hers didn't want to deal with her no more?  People of faith came to help her, yea people aren't perfect.  Its just like willie from duck dynasty yea they live with fancy stuff, but deep down they know thats not whats important thats why they stood by the controversial phil robertson ordeal.  It doesn't mean people don't love and don't make mistakes though.

  I think all sides were bashed/ believers & non-believers and somehow many are missing these points in the movie. They had their trials in the movie.  Okay the movie jumped around a bit and wasn't perfect, it didn't touch every life scenario and went from one extreme to just the opposite.  I just feel like the whole point was missed.  It was all choice based, yes there was quick changes but in movies there is only so much time.  Sure not everyone would have changed to a believer in an instant, but by reading the title you can guess that its going to be obvious they want you to know ""God's Not Dead"".  The girlfriend of the professor she was outcast like an idiot in front of the professors friends, just like Josh fighting for himself on his own.

 Both sides have there ups and downs.  Many are saying that good people had it perfect in the movie, the muslim daughter whom was of christian faith? the chinese son's relationship with his father?  The ministers car breaking down, they were trying the entire time to travel and didn't get to where they wanted in the movie.  The professor lost his mother and his life(dual role in movie as atheist/christian) The girl with cancer's life wasn't perfect, but there was ""Hope"".

smaller things noted below-but I like the story behind it more then anything

I would have liked to see an extended version of the movie though to may tie up the loose ends or go into the debate a bit deeper.  Okay so some of it seemed cheesy with acting like when willie did the interview, his was just the wrong lines it seemed like. Other areas it wasn't perfect, but people have to start acting somewhere and its a lot better then some movies I've seen.  The movies focus is purely about choices and how we are impacted by things around us...again we live in a similar world, but it doesn't change as fast as the pace in this movie and not in such extremes usually, although it does happen in life sometimes.

I hope that my review can help in not being so selective about what they see in the movie because there is more to it (from my point of view) then people are recognizing.",1420156800,6,4781,4.487268518518518

The movie was good, but it also wasn't really good to draw attention to those that arn't Christians. It makes them seem like there really bad people, but being a bad person is up to you. It doesnt matter if your a Christian or not. For those that really want to change their life around or have mixed feeling on weather you believe in GOD or not, then I suggest you read the Bible. The Bible will tell you the truth about all of these stories that's being shown in movies today. I have yet seen a Christian movie made correctly according to a Bible Story.

6417782,5,B00KD5HFJG,"I ended up watching this movie about four times and, like many things, was able to appreciate the message and the delivery of it much more then than my first time through. The only two actors in this movie that I recognized were Kevin Sorbo and Dean Cain who, ironically, had previously portrayed Hercules and Superman.
The main character is a college student who is an unobtrusive and unapologetic Christian who has enrolled in a Philosophy course taught by a professor who is an avowed atheist. The prof wants his class to agree in writing that God is dead so he is able to omit the portion of Intro to Philosophy that discusses Divinity and go on to other topics.  Our ""hero"" can't put the words on paper, so the prof assigns to the student the task of presenting the argument to the class that God is not dead. Along with several other vignettes, there's the movie.
There is a particularly telling scene where Dean, whose character is a real cad, is telling his Dementia-afflicted mother, in a most sanctimonious way that she is the best person he knows and he is a terrible person and that now he has everything he wants going his way and she lives in a world unaware of reality.  She then very clearly articulates that sometimes sin can lure one into a false belief that everything is okay while it imprisons that person until it is too late.
There is a surprise ending and post-movie thoughts on the marvel of God's demonstration that He is able to see around corners that we cannot. I was left repeating words from the story: ""God is good, all the time.  And all the time, God is good.""  Hope you are intrigued; hope you enjoy.",1419984000,,1635,4.494949494949495

6417785,1,B00KD5HFJG,"While this movie wasn't unwatchable, it is ridiculous in the scenario that it sets up. I read a fair amount of what scholars have to say about the Bible and Jewish history. There is a whole world of information that scholars have about those subjects that Evangelicals will avoid, because it interferes with the Christian belief in a perfect faith. Briefly, there are problems with the stories of the Bible compared to known, proven history. Scientific evidence is also frequently at odds with the claims of the Bible. And there are even problems with the internal structure of the Bible, that are very apparent when one studies the many known ancient manuscripts of the Bible -- errors, insertions, revisions, deletions, and contradictions.

An atheist with a doctorate in philosophy should be able to absolutely destroy any mouthy Christian kid in a 101 class with just the sheer volume of advanced and technical knowledge that he could dump on the kid.

So, imagine my frustration when this movie sets up the scenario of a college classroom, led by a highly educated philosophy professor (Kevin Sorbo) who has absolutely no evidences against Christianity, other than to produce a list of famous intellectuals that happen to be atheists. Sorbo's character is confronted by a kid whose Bible education consists of Sunday school classes and Wednesday night youth groups -- and Sorbo yields a significant amount of classroom time through the semester to the kid to make his arguments for Christianity! Only in a Christian fantasy world could this scenario exist.

It's quite clear that the person who wrote this movie knows absolutely nothing about what atheists believe, and did zero research on the subject.

""God's Not Dead"" shows us a world that Christians would love to be real -- where the Davids of the faith always triumph against the Goliaths of knowledge, reason and evidence. This movie portrays itself as a film that you could use to evangelize friends and family with. As someone who does not believe, I found this movie to be incredibly  shallow and offensive. I think that this movie really only plays to a hardcore conservative Christian audience.",1419984000,5,2162,5.011142061281337

6417835,1,B00KD5HFJG,"This is yet another piece brought out to ""uplift"" believers.  The problem is that it does not do what it claims. The movie is more a psychological interplay between a likable believing Christian named Josh and a very unlikeable philosophy professor named Radisson.

Josh never is able to meet the task unfairly put to him, but it does not matter because Professor Radisson is exposed as a believer in God who masks his anger at God over the death of a 12 year old boy by denying God's existence.

There are several lives followed, but the main lives concern a freshman named Josh Wheaton (Wheaton college?) and an arrogant philosophy professor named Prof. Radisson.

Radisson forces everyone in the class to sign a piece of paper stating that ""God is Dead"" so that the class can ""move-on"" (hint: move-on.org?) to the important aspects of philosophy.  Of course everyone signs but Josh. He can't sign the sheet in good conscience and thus is asked to prove that God is not dead over the next three lectures.  He is belittled by Radisson publicly and often throughout the entire movie.

Josh's life is intertwined with an attractive blonde girlfriend named Kara. She also believes in God, but wants Josh to either drop the philosophy class or to just sign the paper so he can focus on her and the rest of his difficult college schedule.  Kara, who at first appears to be a supportive and lovely girlfriend, proves to be self-centered. She demands that Josh drop the class, or drop her.  She childishly demands his full attention, arguing that either the relationship comes first or Prof. Radisson--it is Josh's choice.  Josh argues that God comes first. Of course, the self-centered brat Kara really is comes through, and she promptly dumps Josh.

So it is clear now that Josh is up against the world. Even his mother coaches him to take things easy by dropping the class to focus on his other studies this first semester. But Josh is a stand up person. He does not shy away from a challenge. He visits a church where a reverend `Dave' convinces him that God will not abandon him, and that he was sent to this college to witness to the professor and the other students.

Radisson has a girlfriend too. She is a beautiful young former student named Mina. She believes in God, but is so psychologically weak she latches onto Radisson for security, and thus suppresses her belief in God. Radisson regularly bully's and belittles her in private and public.  It is clear that Radisson is merely tolerated by his colleagues--no one likes him.

Josh's first lecture focuses on the creation of the universe. But not before he appeals to Alvin Plantinga's dictum to not prove God's existence, ask the opposition to prove he does NOT exist.  After saying that, he ignores it and moves on to the creation of the universe. Specifically how the universe was, for thousands of years, believed by scientists to be always in existence.  But then evidence of a ""big bang"" was found.  Physicist stephen Weinberg (atheist) and Belgian astronomer George LeMaitre (theist) seem to agree on the beginnings of the universe. LeMaitre says the big bang is consistent with how the Bible portrays creation of the universe when God says """"let there be light.""

It is unclear how any of this proves, or disproves, God is dead or not dead.

After Josh is done, Radisson belittles Josh again, saying that Stephen Hawking says something else.  Namely that because of gravity, the universe had to create itself. Radisson makes sure that the class knows that Stephen Hawking is the greatest physicist to ever live, and that unschooled Josh is arguing with the greatest physicist who ever lived.

A great mischaracterization of Hawking's point is offered as a defense against divine creation. But the argument does not really matter.  What matters is that Hawking makes the argument, thus it must be right. Radisson is clearly a numbskull philosophy professor using an appeal to authority.  Actually, that is all anyone does in this movie.

After the lecture Radisson roughly corners Josh attempting to intimidate him. Radisson reminds Josh that his high school education is no match for his hard earned Ph. D.. It is said to Josh in a very arrogant and mean tone--as if by a ruffian on the streets of New York.

Josh's second lecture takes on Hawking's mischaracterized statement. Josh finds mathematician and philosopher John Lennox to refute stephen Hawking.  Again, this argument is a mischaracterization, but it does not matter.  Lennox questions Hawking's metaphysical backstop (i.e. what has to exist and why). Lennox wants Hawking to clarify this, because as it stands, he has a circular argument regarding what exists and why. Josh takes this as a refutation. What matters most is that Lennox and Hawking disagree, and Lennox is no dummy.  Professor Dummy, I mean Radisson, then asks Josh arrogantly, if he is arguing with professor Hawking. Of course Josh now responds with a no. He isn't, but Professor Lennox of Mathematics and Philosophy IS! Also, Josh finds Hawking making the following statement ""Philosophy is dead.""  This is gem for Josh.  Now he can force Radisson to choose either to dump Hawking all together, or to accept that philosophy is dead.

Josh continues his look into creation by now looking at Darwin.  He finds a quote of Darwin's where he says that evolution does not occur by jumps. Josh does not realize that Darwinian evolution has long been abandoned, due to its primitiveness--of course, neither does Prof. Radisson.  Using this statement of Darwin, Josh proceeds to argue that all the diversity of life we see today happened in 1/60th of the entire time earth has supposedly been in existence.  Thus, when God says, in Gen. 1:20 ""Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky"" this too is consistent with what scientists see. Both are but blips on the radar of our life experience.

There is such an obvious flaw here, even Christians must wince at this point (is Josh conceding the earth is billions of years old?). But of course Prof. Radisson is merely dumbfounded.

Again, none of this seems to address the question of God being dead or not dead directly.  If Josh could prove God created the earth, that would prove he was not dead at some point.  But Josh is settling for the POSSIBILITY of a God created universe which, if true, does not prove he is alive today. Josh is failing on both counts, yet no one in the movie can tell.

Professor idiot then confronts Josh after class taunting him by saying he tells lies, lies, and more lies.  He calls Josh a Bible thumper, and starts quoting it in order to mock Josh.  Josh has a humble but endearing persona. He braves the biting arrows slung at him by professor idiot.  During this grilling, Josh asks Radisson what happened to make him hate God so much.  Of course Radisson reveals a time when he was young. A time where a 12 year old's death stung him so psychologically deep, the only way to survive was to believe that God is dead.

And there you have it.  The only reason someone can be an atheist is when they get angry at God. Their own misunderstanding of life events is what has led them to such a belief. The ending is now ready.

In the meantime, Radisson's girlfriend Mina has been meeting with pastor Dave. She is coming to grips with her conflict over a belief in God, or living with that arrogant idiot Radisson who insists there is NO God--and no talk about God dammit. When he comes home to find her failing at her duty of being the perfect girlfriend for him, it is obvious what she has to do.

In a meeting at his office, Mina meekly interrupts to request a private audience with Radisson. Mina made the mistake of not calling him ""Professor Radisson,"" so he embarrasses her in front of the others by reminding her that he is on campus and thus should be called ""Professor.""  Exasperated, Mina politely tells Radisson that she has decided it is time for her to move on. Radisson explains to Mina that she can't do that because he won't allow it--most especially on campus in front of his colleagues.

The embarrassing drama goes on for a while, but it feels good, since Radisson totally deserves his comeuppance.

In the last lecture by Josh, we witness a change in tactics.  Josh now wants to tackle the idea of evil. Specifically, how could God allow for evil. Never mind that he only needs to prove his existence (God's character is not in question), he wants to prove that God is also reasonable.

Josh appeals to the ""free will"" of humanity.  That God wants to give humans the ability to choose to believe in him. This is now far from the objective, but Josh makes this assertion about God's character nonetheless.  Of course Radisson can't keep his mouth shut and taunts Josh by pointing out that the allowance of free will now forces all of us to deal with wars, famine, disease, torture and death. He taunts Josh about his next lecture being on moral absolutes. Josh then argues that Dostoyevsky says without God everything is permissible. We are now WAY off topic, but it does not matter. Josh is now confronting Radisson, and Radisson is angrily fighting back.  It is like the scene from ""A few good Men"" when Lt. Kaffee confronts Colonel Jessup on the stand to admit his involvement when Jessup suddenly yells ""you're damn right I did!""  Only this time Josh confronts Radisson about why he is so angry at God.  The crescendo builds until Radisson blurts out ""God would never let a twelve year old boy die!!""  The silence in the film is very effective. Radisson is a hurt individual in need of a belief in God, but he is too angry with God to confront him. The only way to get back at God is to insist he is dead.  Thus God is not dead. Or, more accurately, Radisson does not really believe that God is dead, he is merely angry with him.

The movie gets even worse however. Radisson is hit by a car and a ""right before death"" conversion takes place. But because I have not introduced all the other characters you cannot begin to see the insipidness here.

I will close with just a brief on the other characters. A muslim raised girl named Ayisha who gets beat up by her demanding muslim father. An atheist young woman reporter Amy Ryan facing cancer.  Marc Shelly, an arrogant businessman who is dating Amy Ryan, but conveniently dumps her in her time of need. Reverend Jude, who seems to be the only non-waivering Christian. Martin Yip, an atheistic Chinese American who is impressed with Josh and thus wants to believe in God. And Willie Robertson, a caricature of Duck Dynasty's Phil Robertson.

It's fairly deep at times and many people will need to see it several times to truly understand many of the points made. Occasionally on the intellectual side but it needed to be done that way in order for the film to work. Doesn't matter because its so good you will want to watch it several times. It's defiantly and emotional roller coaster as well as riveting to the point you cant wait to see what's next. At times its sad and tragic and in the end it winds up positive and will leave you feeling great! You won't loose interest that's for sure. It's informative as well as entertaining and it may even change your life! Your going to love this film I cant imagine anyone, believers or nonbelievers, not loving this movie.

6417857,5,B00KD5HFJG,"Love this movie. While some critics argue that the movie is corny and the characters are poorly depicted, I found the movie heart warming.  In our politically correct society, I love the fact that the college student depicted in this movie had the courage to stand up to his professor for his beliefs. I wanted my college age daughters to watch the movie to get inspiration for standing up in their religious beliefs should they ever be challenged. While the circumstances in the movie may be extreme to some (defend God or fail philosophy class and never make it into law school), so many people these days are afraid to express their beliefs with a simply Merry Christmas  for fear of offending others. It is nice to have a role model for religious college students to show it is Ok to defend your beliefs and not be bullied into submission. The movie will likely not convert any non-believers,.as it does in the movie,  but it is a heart warming movie for the those who do believe.",1419120000,11,984,4.579545454545454

6417864,3,B00KD5HFJG,"This movie, on a high level, I thought was great - which primarily includes the plot involving the main character, his classmates and the professor.  Yes, it's absurd to think a college instructor making the request to his or her students to write a note such as he was requesting ""or else"" fail the class, but that's not the point.  The point was well illustrated in this regard in terms of seeing a young man fight for what he believed in.  This part gets five stars.  The acting for this was very good as well.  The movie is worth seeing for this reason.  Below I have to give away the ending to describe the 3 stars so don't read further if you plan on watching it :)

A couple of the other subplots you had to really sit and think if or how they were going to connect back to the point of the movie so it was a little choppy in that regard when you got away from the focus of the young man.

The ending was abysmal.  I'm a strong Christian believer and so is my son, and we both felt the ending was truly awful only because had it been portrayed differently and had a positive and more upbeat ending, it could have been 100 times more impactful in terms of the entire message and meaning of the movie. The professor dies at the end after rediscovering some embers of his faith and then gets run over by a car the second he does going to find his girlfriend to tell her.  So the girlfriend never found out that the professor was having an awakening of his faith; the young man who influenced all this never knew he had an impact on the professor and ALL the kids in the class who now believed ""God was not dead"" thanks to the young man - what were they going to think now that their professor was just run over by a car?  Had he survived the hit and run, found a revived faith, and lived to tell about it - this would have been a much more impactful and appropriate ending leaving the audience feeling good.

It was a really shocking ending - and yes, I get that part people are saying that the point was to depict that even up to the end you can accept God in your heart you go to heaven, but this wasn't the point of the movie.  This ending was extreme and unnecessary and would have been better served having the professor survive, his girlfriend finding out he had a change of heart, the young man finding out he'd influenced his professor in positive ways, and the classroom full of kids who were already on the fence about faith - finding out their professor had a change of heart.  It's a movie - we can control the ending - and this would have been much more impactful than the disturbing ending it had.

It also had another disturbing part where a Muslim family was depicted in a very negative way - and I thought that was just very inappropriate and unnecessary for this movie to go there.

I gave the movie 3 stars as by Amazon definition of 3 stars it was ""okay"".  As mentioned, it is worth watching for the main part of the movie alone - the discussions in the classroom between the young man and the class/professor.  In spite of a few B class actors and odd subplots, the movie would have gotten 5 stars had it had a different ending that was more in line with the entire message of the movie.",1419120000,,3212,4.203583061889251

6417875,5,B00KD5HFJG,"Love this movie! First of all, I have to say that as a college student in America today, the things this professor said to his students rang very true. I have heard all kinds of things from professors, from ""the myth of Jesus"" to how Christianity and Catholicism are the same (the biggest college professor misconception) to getting lower grades on papers for defending my faith against the professor's wishes. I was not surprised at all by the professor in this movie. I loved the characters and laughed out loud quite a few times.

6417877,1,B00KD5HFJG,"Yes, I have seen this movie. I am not just ""trolling"" this film. I'm not just some atheist trying to make Christians angry.

This movie was terrible. It seems like a lot of Christians are very defensive about movies like this, because of the subject matter. Look, it's okay to make movies about religion, Heaven, God, etc., but don't you deserve something a little bit better than this? Why do these films have to be so blunt? This movie punches you right in the face with its message. Where's the subtlety? Where's the art? This story could have been written in 5 minutes. This is an easy cash grab, because the producers know that people will go watch it, then turn around and but the DVD/Blu ray.

I'm not bashing the subject matter here. When a movie has a sloppy story, poor acting, and tries so hard to cram ideas/beliefs down your throat, it's okay to call it a bad movie. Until people start demanding better quality film-making, directors/producers will continue this simple approach and laugh all the way to the bank.",1418947200,18,1026,4.631868131868132

6417936,5,B00KD5HFJG,"Just saw this movie last night for the first time and as a CHRISTian, LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!!  I read the 1 star review from the person that was hoping it would be an opening for a conversation with a loved one who was not a Christian but who stated it only drove him away.  I could relate to that BUT having said that I would like to add that at least the non Christian watched it and had a seed of the simplicity yet the profoundly awesome complexity of GOD.  This movie was about giving people the option to make an intelligent choice about GOD instead of just accepting what the world wants us to believe.  SO 10 stars if possible for the courage of the film makers, actors and everyone involved to at least present a choice in our films we watch-  I choose to buy the movie:-)!!!  (Jos 24:15)  But if you don't want to serve the LORD, then choose today whom you will serve..., my family and I will still serve the LORD.""",1418169600,5,922,4.175141242937853

6417940,2,B00KD5HFJG,"My local secular group gets together every month to watch documentaries and dramas covering issues of faith and non-belief, and we finally got around to watching ""God's Not Dead"" due to all the hype from our religious acquaintances. If you are familiar with faith-based flicks, this one is probably a worse movie overall than ""Fireproof"" (although less of an hour and a half commercial for another product like that movie was) and on-par with bombs like the original ""Left Behind"" series, although it may be amusing enough to the atheist crowd to be worth watching as a drinking game.

The basic idea of the movie is that a professor tries to get his class to agree god isn't real so he can lazily skip part of the curriculum, and of course the one brave Christian stands up to the snarky and rude atheist. Anyone interested in science or issues of faith will cringe throughout the flick as the debating characters decide that biology, cosmology, and philosophy are all interchangeable subjects.

Unfortunately the entire premise of the movie is rooted in fantasy - and as someone who attended private Christian school, public high school, and secular college, I've got first-hand knowledge of the situation.  All the students at the Christian school I attended were required to sign a document stating they accepted Jesus as their lord and savior and believed Christianity to be the one true religion, and many Christian colleges require applicants to sign similar statements. In all my time at public high school and college, I was never once asked to sign a document stating god isn't real or that Christianity is false. The very idea is absurd, and any teacher who would asked students to sign such a document would be wrong to do so.  This is an instance where a segment of Christianity is literally doing exactly what it is accusing the non-Christian crowd of doing, and the hypocrisy is either completely lost on them, or they are aware of it and just don't care.

Aside from the faith issues though, ""God's Not Dead"" is objectively bad as a film, mostly because it doesn't have characters, it instead has caricatures. The non-believers are so over the top bad they can't be taken seriously. I ended up rooting for Dean Cain's character, who was so ludicrously, obnoxiously evil he became a delightful anti-hero. Everyone in the room laughed out loud when his girlfriend reveals she has cancer, and Cain's character gets annoyed and asks why she couldn't wait until another night to share that news since he just made partner at his law firm.

The list of caricatures goes on, as the ""God's Not Dead"" universe isn't our universe, but rather a fantasy world that exists only in the minds of the fringe of conservative Christianity. In this world, liberal arts professors are all wine sipping elitists who bully everyone in sight and plot how to destroy Christianity by corrupting the minds of the innocent American youth. The Duck Dynasty guys are all well-spoken, long suffering, and infinitely patient individuals (of course unfairly targeted by evil liberals) who just love everybody and they definitely don't have an opinion on homosexuality that they'd like to share. Anyone left of center is a vegetarian, Christian-hating extremist with no friends or family and no reason to live. I know some liberal Christians and some conservative atheists who would have a little something to say about the movie's depictions of the political spectrum. The portrayal of atheists is about what you'd expect - and of course its revealed that none of them are really atheists, they instead believe in god but are just secretly mad at him for some reason.

The way the various plot lines all wrap up is trite and obvious from the beginning (spoiler: the Christians turn out to be right and everyone accepts Jesus. The End.), although the things that get said to Kevin Sorbo (of Hercules fame) at the end of the film are sort of horrifying if thought of in a real-world scenario. I would hope that if a Christian was helping someone who had just been hit by a car and was dying, they wouldn't gleefully proclaim how happy the person should be to be dying. This did lead to a fun theological discussion I suspect the makers of the movie didn't intend however: if Hercules becomes a Christian and dies, does he go to Mount Olympus or to Christian heaven, and does Zeus get involved at all?",1418083200,2,4382,4.811420982735724

If you don't believe in God, why are you so afraid or angry of the Christian faith?  Dumbing down the Truth of Christ's redeeming love on the cross and His return for His Children doesn't make it go away. This story shows that we Christians must stand up for Truth so that others can see the Light of Christ and stop playing the religious game.

It reveals well, that Christ is alive wants all to come to Him and encourages Christians to share their faith, even in very difficult situations.
I recommend it to Christian students that plan to attend, or are attending college, and their parents as well as any Christian that thinks they cannot witness to others in these times.

The ladies enjoyed it so much they each plan to purchase it to show their families and friends.....one already owns it. This is a really feel good movie for Christians who are used to seeing/hearing Christians and their values slammed by Hollywood. Everyone filled with tears in places and cheered in others.
The acting is very good and the dialogue is crisp. Filming is really good, especially compared to Christian-based films over the years.
The basic plot is a young college student refuses to sign a paper stating that God is dead and ends up having to debate his philosophy professor in front of the class or get a failing class.
I've heard criticism that the arguments used are not convincing on the film's title. Non-Christians say they are not convinced and Christians are disappointed. They missed the point. This film is not an exhaustive apologetic on whether or not God exists. This is a film that shows a young man willing to stand up for his faith despite having his friends and family caution him against doing so. His fianc is among those who put pressure on him not to be outspoken in class. It's a story of courage and choosing the difficult path when the easy path would be just that......easy.

6418132,2,B00KD5HFJG,"*SPOILERS*

American movies deal with virtually all areas of everyday life, but one aspect they never seem to get around to tackling very much is religion. In fact, if you were an alien from outer space and all you knew about American life came from the movies, you might be forgiven for coming away with the impression that spirituality and religion played little to no part in it. And you don't have to even be a religious person to be bothered by this oversight. Yet, apart from the occasional religious fanatic in a horror film (usually an exorcist or a serial killer or a knockoff of Carrie`s mom) or a well-meaning but misguided Bible-thumping rube in the odd independent feature, religious characters are virtually no en casa when it comes to the American movie scene. (In all fairness, atheists do not fare any better when it comes to Hollywood happenings, since they are invariably forced to convert to theism of at least some sort after being shown the error of their ways).

Apparently, now however, there is a movement of sorts, mainly among evangelical Protestant filmmakers, to rectify this situation. And while that's an admirable goal in and of itself, a movie like ""God's Not Dead"" is clearly not the answer. Apart from its amateurishness of script, production and acting, ""God's Not Dead"" seems mainly concerned that the audience come away with the impression that the whole secular world is out to ""get"" Christians, exemplified by a truly embarrassing scene in which a snotty liberal reporter attempts to ambush  the infinitely patient ""Duck Dynasty"" star Willie Robertson over his religious faith. Rest assured, however, the reporter gets her comeuppance by being struck down by a fatal disease, so everything turns out all right in the end.

This theme plays itself out most fully in the central conflict, as a clean-cut, green-around-the-gills Christian freshman goes head-to-head with an obnoxious philosophy professor who insists that all his students sign a pledge at the beginning of the semester declaring in no uncertain terms that God is dead. After the youngster refuses to compromise his faith, the Prof makes the fatal mistake of allowing him to make his case to the class, smug in his certainty that the boy will flame out and be shamed into admitting that the teacher was right all along. Thus, Josh Wheaton (Shane Harper) and Professor Radisson (Kevin Sorbo) go round-and-round in a series of lectures and debates, with Wheaton getting all the good lines and compelling arguments (though the professor does get the better podium) till, of course, Wheaton has inspired the entire class to rise up out of their seats and to declare in unison ""God's not dead,"" while the pro, with all his book-larnin', is left a quivering mass amidst the smoldering ruin of what was once his atheistic domain. We're somehow supposed to believe that this seasoned scholar and certified atheist hasn't heard any of these supposedly iron-clad, full-proof theistic arguments before, and that he wouldn`t have more compelling arrows in his own quiver with which to refute them. (Interestingly, Wheaton is clearly no young earth creationist since he argues for a theistic explanation for both the Big Bang and evolution, a fact that might not actually sit all that well with a fairly large chunk of the movie's target audience).

In truth, it's really not all that surprising that the professor is not afforded a fair hearing because ""God's Not Dead"" is not interested in having an honest debate about the issues; what it wants is to set up, then effortlessly knock down, as many straw men (i.e., nonbelievers) as it can on its way to winning the argument. Radisson, for instance, is a raving caricature of a ""liberal"" college professor: arrogant, self-righteous, and eager to crush dissent in the classroom he runs like a petty dictator. He even verbally abuses his meek Christian girlfriend (a former student of his, of course, but, then again, you know how these decadent lefty academics are!), and thinks nothing of verbally dressing her down in front of his equally snooty colleagues for her religious beliefs (if he had a mustache, I'm sure he would twirl it).

The problem with ""God's Not Dead"" is not that it has a pro-Christian message; it's that it feels the need to deliver that message by putting everybody else down that`s the problem. It even gets its digs in at Islam, in an under-developed subplot (all the subplots are under-developed, actually) involving a young new convert to Christianity whose super-devout Muslim father physically abuses then disowns her when he learns of her ""betrayal"" (as if many Christian parents haven't reacted in similar fashion when informed that their children are gay or have become unbelievers, for example). Would the filmmakers (Cary Solomon and Chuck Konzelman wrote it and Harold Cronk directed it) be so quick to judge a parent if the situation were reversed?

It's no big revelation to say that dramas regularly use manipulation to varying degrees to try to win audiences over to their side, so there is nothing inherently wrong with what ""God's Not Dead"" is trying to do. It's just that it does so on such a cheesy and simple-minded level (the last 15 minutes or so really have to be seen to be believed) that it actually winds up driving away the very people it is trying to persuade.

As it stands, if ""God's Not Dead"" is any indication of their average output, Christian filmmakers are really going to have to step up their game if they hope one day to be able to compete in the big leagues.",1415491200,2,5561,4.902231668437832

Yes, it is based upon a Christian perspective of things, and doesn't touch many aspects of religion that one might desire. To do so would mean there would have to have been separate movies on different lives, which wasn't practical.  Time is always limited (as were the resources available to make this film.  I watched the film as a former atheist who has always been ""seeking.""  Frankly, my first watching was as I studied the life of Stephen Hawking, who is mentioned prominently.  The observer isn't told much of many of the personal journeys portrayed, but there is enough to come away from a viewing believing that some would have such experiences and they are not unusual or abnormal -- they are of people seeking for truth.

I hear they are coming out w/ a God's not dead 2 movie, that may address some of those stories in greater detail.  I'd like to see the character of Josh go on to become the lawyer he's studying to be, and to defend Christians where they are being hassled in the workplace and other situations in the upcoming 2nd movie.

6418151,3,B00KD5HFJG,"I think it got such high scores for the same reason that a lot of children's movies and religious message films get good scores, that there is not enough of them, people want more, and others are trying to encourage others to watch them.

NOT good enough!  From the previews I just bought the film thinking this is a subject I would like to have available for a few people I knew to watch...BUT, it was not anywhere good enough to do the job that it said the whole film was about...arguing that G'd, exists.

The film itself, said how important it was to give the ""best shot"" for convincing that God exists to a group of people that you might have the attention of, only once in their lives...and then did a poor job.

I kept wondering IF they were going to say more, or it the editor for the film messed it up. Because there ARE good arguments...which the film touched on, but were so shortened and brief...interspersed between disjointed vinaigrettes of sample people's lives...that it was like bringing a spoon of soup to the mouth and then spilling allot of it before you got it in the mouth.

It touched on:
(first day of 3)The creation of the universe, and argued against scientific theories. Saying because it was so sudden this proved it could not be accidental.  (this argument doesn't help, and the student in the atheist teacher's class was ONLY given three 20 minute slots to do the whole job in. Our brains physically are not anywhere near evolved enough to even grasp the what and how of God. We, humans at this level can not do that...but what we can do at our level is to suspend our need for proof and to believe regardless...ie faith.  So the argument for G'ds existence should have been the obstacles to what we ARE able to give.)

  It seems to me that when one reads the Bible, that there are layers of understanding in it. That this makes the Bible a valid tool for a child, for a tailor or for an Einstein. There is the obvious story, then there is a symbolic story, then there is an allegorical lesson, and then there is a spiritual message in almost all of what the Bible says.

  The Jews were a persecuted people, they hid, and hid again, and then encoded much of what their messages were in their writing to preserve and protect them. Every time a group interpreted the Bible they missed some of the meaning, and had prejudices of their own...so to get the true meaning of scripture takes a lot of prayer, purity, and Holy Spirit. Everything is NOT just the top layer of what ""seems"" to be the message. Though those that can only see this layer become IRATE if someone suggests they do not understand all there is to see...

  For instance the book of Job (which gives many people difficulty in crediting G'd exists IF G'd would allow satan to torment a righteous man that had followed everything G'd had asked of him! Makes G'd seem capricious, undecided, and therefore NOT an all perfect being. So Job needs to have been explained)

  The book of Job is a lesson, not a story. The lesson was not that G'd let satan do this to us...but that we need to understand that we can not understand,or even guess at ""by human standards"" why G'd does what he does. That understanding is a benefit and not belief. That ONLY when we realize we deserve nothing, we know nothing, and in fact we are nothing...can we begin to love G'd, have faith in G'd. Because it is at that moment that we realize we have NO control and ALL the control is G'd's. That we are totally helpless, and understand that no amount of good works can buy good from G'd. That what we are given is from G'd for G'ds reasons.

Then the movie argued that a good god would not cause or allow harm. A major obstacle to human belief. The argument here was ""free will."" which was a good argument but so sparse that it gave little. (Essentially the idea is ...with my expansions..is that G'd created mankind to love G'd. But if G'd gave everything to man, why would man not love G'd?  For man to love G'd, man had to love G'd for no other reason that man sensed that G'd was love and was worthy to be loved. But how can man sense this when horrible things happen to men and G'd does not prevent it, or even save those who love and follow G'd? The film's answer was in order for man to really love G'd he would have to have absolute ""free will"" to choose to love G'd...with NO inducements of either benefits or protection.  Thus even if man chose to love G'd and to try to do good...others were free to reject G'd and to just do whatever they wanted...which caused pain and mayhem for the rest of the world. IF G'd stopped any of that...then G'd would have provided a benefit to loving G'd and so man's love would not be freely given and thus real.)

  Again, looking towards the Bible as a road map of what our own lives should be. We see Jesus WAS the son of G'd and could have ordered the moutains to move, the waters to still...Jesus could have done anythng...but he did not. Instead he walked the walk we would have to walk in order to find our best way towards G'd.

  His first temptation when he hungered and thirsted, Jesus could have ordered food be provided for him and it would have. It was hard to suffer hunger, thirst, cold, heat, pain...but he did, because we would have to. The devil tempted him, telling him that the angels would bring it. And Jesus repelled him with scripture saying that, man did not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded from the mouth of G'd.

  Jesus's second temptation was to climb the mountain and the devil tempted Jesus with SCRIPTURE. (be certain that satan is a master of scripture and tried to use it against Jesus and in today's world it is also used for satan's purposes by many...ever wonder how Christian killed Christian? Another argument against G'd, that did not belong against G'd, but against man and satan.)

  This temptation was to throw himself from the mountain and to be borne up by the angels. And what a temptation THAT was. Power and glory. To be know for who you really were. To be acknowledged, and rewarded. To be claimed and shown to be superior, and powerful. But Jesus rejected to use this. Jesus was to show us how to walk the walk, to show us G'd did understand what G'd was asking from us, that G'd did not ignore our pain but experienced it too...so that we would understand it was NOT about the pain...but about overcoming our focus on the world and turning towards our spiritual side where we could connect with G'd. That the world was a school room, where pain was often the motivation to move higher.

  I'll leave the other temptations for you to look at, a good book to do this is ""Temptation"" by Diogenes Allen. The point is, Jesus's life was a road map, of the way we will all have to go. Maybe we will not suffer hunger, but we will suffer in some way. And at the last, we will all have to make it through the pain to death, just as Jesus did on the cross. We will all have our own cross to bear. We will all die on our own cross.

  It is when you ask yourself, why should anyone be spared, when Christ was not, that you begin to understand there must be a value in all this pain that we experience. It is when you understand that you can not know G'ds purpose, and that you have NO real power. That it may seem like you do when you use money, or influence...but what good is taking a bus to Florida...if where you need to get to is Virginia?  It is then, that you begin to see that there is not indifference, or ignorance, or a lack of power in G'd that would make you question whether G'd truly exists...but meaning...that you can not understand.

So here is the last argument in the film, it is your choice to believe or not believe. That is true, and though each of these ideas had a little workup to them, there was NOT ENOUGH development to allow people that had not already thought these ideas to grab hold and use them.

  So here it is. You live in a world, where a lot of people get up on you because they lie or cheat or use power against you. Is this the world you want to believe in? Where people abuse children, kill thousands and get away with it. Where mean, bad people are in power and do horrible things. Is this what you would choose? Do you choose not to believe there is more, only this?

  Or do you choose to believe in love, honesty, hope, faith, goodness? Even though in most of the world this is not how things work consistent. Even though those good things you only have a bit of here and there. Even though you can not prove there is anything more. Even though you can not understand how any of this could exist, given the state of the world.

  Which way, is what you want? Choose. We all carry our happiness in us. If we are filled with things that make us happy, then even if we are in a bad situation, we can still enjoy watching an ant. If we carry the belief that only the strong win, and everyone below the strongest loses to some degree, and that life has no meaning...then no matter where we are, even in Disney World, there will be some degree of anxiety, sadness, loneliness.

  But I think the strongest reason to believe that G'd exists, is that we all sense that there is More.

  I believe it was C.S.Lewis that put this idea out there....That if you were to go to another planet....and you found an animal there that craved X .....you could be certain somewhere on that planet X was.  Just like if aliens captured one of us, and we thirsted for and needed water...they could be certain somewhere on Earth water must exist.

  I don't know of anyone that has not wanted to love or be loved. Initially we have a very basic understanding of love as meeting our needs, then we want more. We want to be known, to have purpose and value. We look for it in others, or our jobs, or in possessions...but never do we feel like we have it all, enough. This craving for what we can not get here...tells us that somewhere is what we need. What we crave is love and goodness and truth and we can not get enough of it here. Just as our desire for water proves water exists...our desire for Love/truth/goodness proves G'd exists.

Many of us are SO afraid of pain, so afraid of the pain of disappointment that we CHOOSE not to believe. We do not think we are enough, we do not think we are worthy to be loved...and so instead of rejection or failure we choose not to play.  Some of us have tried and it is HARD to walk the walk, to climb of our own volition on the cross, to admit to and accept that we have no power, no control and to yield ALL...so we choose not to give all.

But is a choice. A hard choice. A choice that just asks more and more of you every moment. That you fall repeatedly, and repent of falling constantly...but it IS a choice that once made, opens up avenues and understanding that you never knew existed. It opens a realm, a way, a path that gives more, and more.

6418217,3,B00KD5HFJG,"God's not dead is good of course cause it talks about God, but it's not as powerful as it should have been too many characters are introduced without explanation, and so many questions about the movie are unanswered, if you need to here about God it's a good movie, but there are much better Christian movies out there",1414368000,,318,4.5

Don't let it be too late to give your life over to Christ. Fir no one knows the day or the hour upon which the sun will set or rise on them.

6418250,5,B00KD5HFJG,"Great movie to teach that moral character is more important than popular choice of today.  The court of public opinion does not rule over the moral truth and that is what this movie teaches. It is a great teaching tool for teens and kids.  I love this movie for its content and the teaching. I do feel that it goes on a little longer than needed and the outcome was kinda predictable, however for content and message I give it 5 stars. You can watch this movie with your whole family and don't have to watch for the complimentary F word or nudity that fills all other media today.",1413936000,,580,4.3119266055045875

6418261,5,B00KD5HFJG,LOVE THE MOVIE! It made me be more religious. It changed my life,1413849600,,64,4.0
6418262,3,B00KD5HFJG,"The young man in the movie, defending God's existence, said we who believe in God have the choice to believe in God(the God of Israel, the God of Abraham, Issac and Jacob),he also said, those who believe God doesn't exist, can't prove He doesn't exist(that's true) and we believers can't prove that He does exist,it is just our choice to believe. Would believers be in the same boat as unbelievers? NO!!! Can a human being create or make trees, flowers or animals? Creation proves God exists, whose name is YHVH Elohim(Google search YHVH Elohim for more info on HIS NAME) MAY HE BE PRAISED! !!!!!",1413849600,,596,4.685714285714286
6418263,5,B00KD5HFJG,This film begins by making a powerful statement about how our education system tries to convince Christians to abandon their beliefs to be successful in college and ends by making a more powerful statement for existence of God.  Wonderful stories throughout based on true events. Don't miss this film!,1413849600,,301,5.142857142857143
6418264,5,B00KD5HFJG,"This is a film that deals truthfully about many issues faced by young people and older people today, How does one handle such issues?

6418269,5,B00KD5HFJG,this is a very well thought out movie. not an real religious movie but one that allows a christian to stand firm on their faith and stand firm on what they believe.realizing that not everyone who says they don't believe. there is always another story behind that.. good story line. loved this movie..,1413849600,4,300,4.679245283018868
6418270,5,B00KD5HFJG,Great movie!,1413849600,,12,5.5
6418271,5,B00KD5HFJG,"The best way to debate anything, in my opinion, is to tackle the subject matter by arguing for the opposing side, rather than for the side you actually believe.  In this film, however, you have a supposed atheist, who really isn't an atheist at all, arguing on behalf of something that he really doesn't believe it.  He just wants others to think that he's an atheist.  What he is, however, is angry.  He's angry at God; and rather than admit it, he denounces Him.

The student, on the other hand, is put between a rock and a hard place.  He can either do what everyone else wants him to do and have everything that he desires (his girlfriend, a future as a lawyer, a good grace in the class, etc.) or he can defend his belief in God and lose it all.  He chooses the latter.

I love the fact that he uses science and philosophy to prove the existence of God.

It's just an excellent film all the way around, and I love the concert at the end.  The music is very uplifting and Michael Tait is such an amazing singer.",1413849600,,1015,4.239583333333333

6418291,4,B00KD5HFJG,This was a good movie but moves a little slow at times.  Very thought provoking and a great teaching tool.  So sad that teachers push their own agendas and instead of teaching all the facts allowing others to decide for themselves what they will or will not believe.  I will be using this for my Confirmation Class this year.,1413590400,,325,4.47457627118644

6418300,2,B00KD5HFJG,"Acting a bit very low key. Did not like it at all. The movie sets out to prove a physical belief but trying to prove that God is not dead does not make any sense. I certainly believe in God but how can one assume that God can actually die, physically or in the supernatural sense?  I don't get it.",1413504000,,297,3.95

6418314,5,B00KD5HFJG,Wonderful story!!! The director of this movie did a fantastic job of finding the minute details of why we believe in Christ.  The debate with his professor was thrilling and human wisdom is shown for what it is.,1413417600,,211,4.552631578947368
6418315,5,B00KD5HFJG,An excellent movie.  This movie was good drama but most of all relayed a great message on standing up for what is true and right in the face of strong persecution.,1413417600,,163,4.258064516129032
6418316,5,B00KD5HFJG,Wonderful and powerful about what being a Christian means. The salvation message is very strong. Love it.,1413331200,,105,5.235294117647059

6418318,5,B00KD5HFJG,Fantastic movie!!!  It helped me with being able to answer questions better.  I liked the kid's approach which is factual and not in your face.  Too many Christians are very legalistic and cram Christianity down a non-believer's throat.  What better way to turn someone off of God.  This movie is great for non-believers or someone on the fence.  It's also very good reminders for believers.  I highly recommend it!,1413331200,2,415,4.927536231884058

6418338,1,B00KD5HFJG,"Gods Not Dead is intellectually bankrupt and morally reprehensible.  While the film is better made from a nuts and bolts standpoint than other modern Christian films, like Facing the Giants or Fireproof, it is additionally hampered by over-covered and choppily edited scenes that are shot like a Lifetime TV movie where a rape is just around every corner.  While the film may be good for a few ironic laughs, the ugliness and insulting nature of the film cause it to be an insult to not just Atheists, but Christians, Muslims, the Chinese, and anyone with a single fully functioning brain cell.  This is an ugly and shameful film.

The premise is that Josh Wheaton (Shane Harper), not to be confused with popular Atheist writer/director Joss Whedon.or Wil Wheaton for that matter, is a devout Christian entering his freshman year of college.  He takes a Philosophy course taught by Mr. Radisson (a hammy Kevin Sorbo), because apparently the courses taught by professors Comfort Inn and Best Western were booked.  Radisson is a saliva-spewing angry Atheist who verbally and emotionally abuses his poor, Christian girlfriend (Cory Oliver, who has had a lot of bad plastic surgery done to her face if those ridiculously fake cheekbones are any indication).  Radisson is a cartoon.  Even the most anti-religion Atheists, a group of which I count myself among the population, are nothing like this.  He is a scenery chewing villain nursing a pain from his past and lashing out with misdirected anger, much like any number of comic book villains.

Not to mention that, as a Philosophy professor, he is awful.  In the first class of the semester, he arrogantly states that arguments for or against the existence of God are tired and useless, and wants all of his students to write God is Dead on a paper and sign it, before moving on to other subjects.  Never mind that no actual, real life Philosophy professor would ever make his students do this.  Naturally, Josh refuses, and thus begins the most wasted semester of college ever portrayed on film, and remember that Ive seen Spring Breakers.  Radisson wastes class time and his students tuition money by having class after class of Josh attempt to defend the existence of a god while Radisson yells at him opposing viewpoints.

There is a large problem with the scenes in the classroom, and that is that neither Josh nor Radisson ever actually uses a Philosophical argument in this supposed Philosophical debate.  Having taken Introduction to Philosophy in college, I know that a proper argument is made in the form of a proof. Example from Google:

All whales are mammals.
All mammals are warm-blooded.
So all whales are warm-blooded.

Proofs often follow rules of Logic, such as Modus Tollens or the Transitive Property, or any number of other rules I have forgotten from my freshman year Logic course.  In this film, neither the student nor the professor ever makes an actual argument.  They merely quote different people with opposing view points back and forth and we have an orgy of the logical fallacy known as Argument from Authority.  There are, of course, ACTUAL arguments for and against the existence of god, but you won't hear about the Cosmological Argument or the Teleological argument here.  Theres no Epicurus argument about god being either malevolent or not omnipotent.  There is no actual philosophy in this Philosophy class.  It might have behooved the writers of this film to have at least audited a Philosophy class at their local non-Christian, accredited college before embarking on this fiasco masquerading as a film.

Real life, actual Philosophy teachers, some Atheists, have written far more detailed accounts of why this film knows nothing of philosophy, so THIS review need not cover that ground any further.  Suffice it to say that the basic premise of the film is flawed (no professor would ever do this) the execution is tone-deaf (no actual Philosophy exists in this ostensible Philosophy Class), and the film merely wants to set a martyr/persecution fetish in which ONE-LONE-CHRISTIAN must stand up to the evils of ATHEISM in Liberal Academia.  Never mind that 75% or more of the United States is Christian.  In this film they are a persecuted minority constantly challenging the status quo, yet a large enough minority to fill up the film-ending concert (the film tells us a crowd of 10,000) in what is supposed to be a small town but is very obviously Los Angeles.  Heres a test to see who the real persecuted ones are.  Has any Christian reading this been threatened to have their pro-religion bumper sticker ripped off of their car? I doubt so.  Well my car has a bumper sticker reading Im not a slave to a God that doesnt exist.  How many do you think Ive had? The answer is only one, but if you think my bumper sticker is equally safe or safer to have on my car than a Jesus Fish, you are sorely misinformed about what the United States in 2014 is truly like.

So yes, Josh is at risk of failing (even though a grade in introductory Philosophy is not contingent on an argument being correct or proven, but mostly if your argument follows the rules of logic and if you can explain the major argument you learn about correctly), and he even loses his girlfriend of six years because, well, she seems upset that hes spending time doing work.  In college.  What?

This is just our main plot.  We also have an absurd and cluttered amount of subplots. Radissons girlfriend, Mina, has an elderly mother with dementia.  Not real dementia, mind you, but the kind of movie dementia where people become unusually lucid during critical moments in the plot, like telling her son and Minas brother, Mark (Dean Cain, who must have blown threw his Lois and Clark money too fast) that hes a successful businessman (which the film lets us know because he wears a suit and says words like merger and partners and  stocks, because you see, businessmen use those words!) because of Satan.  I don't know, this a film where Satan gives people money and success, is too powerful for God to defeat even though God is supposed to be omnipotent (maybe hes just lazy or has better things to do?), and God in this film brutally punishes people with death by car accident (Radissonif this is a spoiler for you I frankly don't give care) or with brain tumors.

Oh yes, the films other major Atheist character is Amy Ryan (Trisha LaFach), who has bumper stickers on her car about saving the environment and animals and proclaiming that she loves evolution.  Naturally the all-loving God of this film gives her a brain tumor.  Sure, by the end of the film a crappy Christian rock band prays with her, but the film doesnt let us see her again after that, so naturally I assume a vengeful God killed her for believing in science and liking animals. The jerk.  Prior to that she accosted the Duck Dynasty guy and his leggy Im-not-pretending-to-be-a-redneck-despite-my-millions-unlike-my-husband spouse outside of a church, though they of course graciously allow her a mini-interview.  As they would in real life, Im sure.  Stop them on their way inside church yourself. Im sure theyll be just as pleasant.  Wear Kevlar.

Perhaps the most offensive subplot, though, is that of the Muslim girl (Hadeel Sittu) whose father confusingly makes her wear a scarf around her face and head, but still allows her to dress like a normal twenty-something girl and work in a secular colleges dining hall.  She secretly listens to the Bible on her iPod in her room, until shes caught by her snooping younger brother (I assume he wanted to see something else) and is tattled on.  This leads us to a scene where her father smacks her and drags her by her hair out of the house. Yes, this PG-rated film features a Muslim man b**chslapping his daughter and horrific, misogynist domestic violence.  You see, the film doesnt want us to think that merely faith in a God is a good thing. No.  You have to believe in the RIGHT God.  The CHRISTIAN God.  Oh, how Christians in the United States are made to suffer under the tyranny of Atheism (15% of the U.S. population if you count all unaffiliated) and Islam (2-3% of the U.S.).

Luckily, our poor abused ex-Muslim is taken in by Pastor Dave (David A.R. White, who looks like Matthew Modine if he were beaten with an ugly stick), who is also tested by God.  See, his car refuses to start until he prays on it.  The God of this film is so angry and petty that he even tests the faithful using minor nuisanceswhens not giving brain tumors or hitting people with cars.  The Atheists in this film may be portrayed as the angry ones, but the films assumption at the audiences love of these Atheists getting their just desserts portrays far more implicit anger on their parts.

Oh, and lets not forget one last subplot: a Chinese man (Paul Kwo) whos father insists he proclaim that God is dead to get a good grade in Radissons class (both a stereotypical and racist portrayal of achievement-above-all-else Asian family dynamics AND a stab at godless, Communist China).

The film ends once Radisson is mowed over by a car driven by Satan-beloved Mark.  As he lies dying in the street with blood filling his lungs (yet able to speak clearly.then again, a non-doctor supporting character says Radissons lungs are filling with blood merely by looking at the guy) and Pastor Dave gently guiding him to the afterlife after he renounces his Atheist ways. See, Radisson wasn't a true Atheist, he was merely mad at God for killing his mommy.  I know many religious people don't understand that Atheists are not mad at God, but some are merely mad at believers of God, and this film showcases that ignorance. Then the rain stops, Pastor Dave is perfectly dry, and he and his friend (who maybe has x-ray eyes) talk about how the day was truly great.you know, despite seeing a man die in front of them minutes earlier.or perhaps longer if they had time to dry themselves and their clothes.

All of the other main characters end up at the Christian rock concert and we learn that Josh, after convincing his class that God is alive (a fickle group, that class) will not be dating (or courting) the ex-Muslim girl, and he has a new Chinese friend.  The Duck Dynasty guy appears at the concert and tells everyone to spam their entire cell phone contact list by texting Gods not dead to everyone they know. Mina texts it to her dead ex-boyfriend as he lay cold in the street in this bizarre approximation of a happy ending.  Were also treated to not one, but two whole songs by this group, Newsboys, who needless to say play insipid and uninspired songs.  Oddly enough, their concert costumes are black suits with red shirts underneath, so apparently they share Satans tailor.  After 113 minutes, it seems that the film was really just a commercial for this band. Weird.

Look, Im more than capable of liking a pro-religion film if it is entertaining and well-made. The Prince of Egypt is an underrated film and my favorite filmic depiction of a Bible story.  Gods Not Dead is offensive, insulting, and ugly.  It saddens me that Christians seem to have liked this film, judging by its success at the box office.  Almost nothing is worse than someone or something you agree with making your argument poorly.  This film portrays Christians as tasteless, weak people who accept abuse because of a persecution fetish, except for Josh, who is merely portrayed as a dull man who walks around a lot and has enough anger under the surface to maybe shoot up a school someday.  It portrays all non-believers as uniformly and cartoonishly evil, and it portrays God as an evil a**hole who murders and punishes anyone who doesnt believe in him, and even tests his faithful believers with cars that don't start, girlfriends who dump you, or fathers who beat you and throw you out of the house.  Unless Satan does those things, which doesnt make sense since Satan rewards another character who is not Godly with nice cars and watches and suits.

While the film isn't quite as offensive to me as Big Fish and 300, the other two films in recent history I have given an F to, and because I knew what I was getting in to watching the film, its not as anger causing at the worst, most morally repugnant and reprehensible Ive ever seen.  But this film is horrible, offensive to my moral sensibilities, and the filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves. F.",1413244800,19,12392,4.7421911421911425

6418365,4,B00KD5HFJG,"""God's Not Dead"" is about a Christian pre-law student who is enrolled in a philosophy course in which an atheist professor requires the students to write ""God is dead"" and sign their name so the course can proceed without religious and/or spiritual distraction. The main character says he cannot write the words, so the professor says he must defend his position to pass the class. The debate that ensues is fairly well written. As for the movie itself, there are holes in the sub-plots and not all loose ends are tied together at the end. That is understandable because, while the story maintains viewer interest and a good pace, this is not an Academy Award quality film. Thus, the 4 star rating. Still, it merits noting that diverse beliefs and cultures are respectfully represented in the various characters. So, is the movie worth seeing? Yes!",1413072000,,848,4.855172413793103

6418368,2,B00KD5HFJG,"A fair, not a good, certainly not a great, film. In my experience most if not all so-called 'Christian films' are soft & warm; i.e., they're 'safe' for the Christian audience because they don't pose serious, thought provoking challenges to believers to make soul searching candid assessments of where we are in our spiritual development. They soft sell the faith. And the acting & production values are sadly lacking, not up to pagan Hollywood's best. God's Not Dead perpetuates these disappointments.

My experience to date is that non-Christian films & films with Christian, or Biblical, themes made by what I presume (but don't know) are non-Christian film makers render significantly better work in depicting the stark rawness of the fallen human condition, in challenging the worldviews of both Christians & non-Christians, & in prompting serious soul searching about who I am & how I live my life & relate to others. One of my favorites films, Crash, comes immediately to mind.

God's Not Dead is typical of Christian films: It depicts for Christians what Christians already (should) know about our faith. That is, it preaches to the choir. I seriously doubt it will move the needle for the non-Christian. Rather, for any unbelievers who deign to watch this flick it probably only confirms their weariness with what they regard as the Christian community's self-righteous 'preachyness' & naivety.

I recommend to Christians films that, rather than preaching to the choir & reinforcing what we already think we understand about ourselves & our faith, provide a good platform for engaging unbelieving friends in conversation about spiritual matters by way of considering critically the statement a film seems to be making about the nature of the human condition. 2004's Crash & 2014's Noah are examples. Noah has not been generally well received by the Christian audience. Despite its obvious flaws in tracking the Biblical account faithfully, it does communicate well the human condition in our fallen-ness. Crash can also be very effective for this purpose. There are others. Among the more recent I've seen at this writing is 2013's The Railway Man. The Gospel of Jesus Christ is writ large in the closing scene.

God's Not Dead is Christian family safe for viewing. That's a considerable positive as even small children can watch with their parents. In my estimation it fails as a platform for engaging unbelieving friends in serious conversation about the Christian faith.",1413072000,2,2481,5.164179104477612

6418379,1,B00KD5HFJG,"I viewed this movie to get a better understanding of why people believe in god.  Unfortunately, this movie was very one-sided on the belief of god and that it had to be about believing in Jesus.  To me God and Jesus are two separate things.  I wish the conversation included more faiths that believed in god and also I wish they would not have portrayed people who do not believe in god or at least a god in their particular way; as not being good people, as being amoral, or as all being atheists.  The portrayal of people of other faiths (The Muslim father) or atheists (the Philosophy Professor and the Bad Boyfriend who broke up with his girlfriend because she had cancer); was pretty brutal in this movie and if I was Christian - I think I would be a bit embarrassed.

Just because I do not believe in god per se - does not mean I do not believe in anything.  I believe in something that works by showing actual proof in my daily life. I am the director, producer, and actor on the stage of life - I believe I am able to make my life the way I want it to be and that I do not have to wait for gods plan. I believe in the universal law of cause and effect that permeates the universe through sound vibration - nam-myoho-renge-kyo. I am a Buddhist and Soka Gakkai Member.  I practice daily and have been able to change the most negative aspects of my life into the most positive, powerful and beautiful things - also known as changing my ""karma"".

I do however respect everyone's right to believe in what they believe and can appreciate that their faith is what helps them, gives them hope, and makes them happy. That's why whether someone is Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Hindu or Buddhist - I believe each person is able to use their beliefs to become a better,happier, and more capable human being.

This film on the other hand, did not seem to respect others who do not have their viewpoint or religious beliefs, nor did they portray them as being inherently good.  I feel it did not speak to the wide range of individuals who may not be Christian, but are very good people nonetheless.  Peace.",1412985600,2,2098,4.367609254498714

6418391,5,B00KD5HFJG,"Pros outweighed the cons! I watch it often. A great movie which challenges my walk of faith. ""If we fail to acknowledge God before humanity, then Jesus will not ackowledge us before the Father!"" A great movie; I have seen its message change the lives of many young people.....as many as 200 or more!  Everyone should watch this!  Even my youngest adult daughter and her friend loved it!

Cons: While the pros and the message outweighed the cons, the movie would have been better had the two ministers had better story lines.  Theirs were a bit corny.  For example, the statements: ""God is Good, All the Time... God is Good!"" were mundane and overused and could have been spiced up a bit with true biblical statements about God's Sovereignty! The scene about the rental cars were quite corny...the scene where the African minister pronounced that the injured atheist professor's ""lungs were crushed and he did not have long""....how did he know this??? Was he a medical doctor as well?",1412899200,,983,4.792899408284024

Finally the Christian film producers made a meaningful movies that is an accurate portrayal of what it means to be a true Christian in the US today.  Having worked with college students for 10 years now in a discipleship capacity, I can say this film hits on many of the points that a Christian attending a college in the US will face at some point.  Anyone who doubts that Christians are been intentionally targeted for persecution by university professors and academia as a whole needs to watch the documentary ""Expelled""  by Ben Stein.",1412812800,,678,4.570247933884297

6418426,1,B00KD5HFJG,"A movie made by Christians, for Christians, to confirm how great Christianity is.  The non-Chrisitians are portrayed as cartoonish stereotypes.  This is mean spirited and hateful, the ultimate in Christian bigotry. Not only is it anti-atheist, it's anti education and university as well.  The professor in this movie is such a black and white painted negative character that he may as well have horns sprouting from his skull.  Disgusting.

I'm an atheist.  However, I grew up in a religious household, and have a healthy respect for the Christian way of life; even if I don't agree with the doctrine, I still admire the values many Christian people uphold.  This movie takes some of the worst things about Christianity and brings them to the forefront.  This is the opposite of what you would want to show me to convince me of the truth of Christianity.",1412640000,27,854,4.881944444444445
6418427,4,B00KD5HFJG,Excellent movie portraying the real obstacles young Christian adults face daily.,1412640000,,80,6.363636363636363
6418428,2,B00KD5HFJG,"My wife brought the movie home for our weekly movie night. As we enjoy movies with spiritual content, this seemed worthy of a view.  While at first blush it looked like a good piece on arguing for the existence of God, it came off to me as more of a conservative Christian propaganda piece. It's not surprising that conservative Christians/Evangelicals liked it; it was written from that world view.

The good: Interesting story line, apparently taken partly from real-world event. A debate on the existence of God is a good subject, for both believers and non-believers, and can help both groups examine why they believe what they do. The actual classroom debate was well-enough done. The mother coming out of her dementia to ""smack down"" her wayward son was a good twist.

The bad:  The characters were nearly universally caricatures- the arrogant, ""liberal"" atheist college professor, the Chinese kid from ""Communist"" (read: atheist) China, the African Christian minister. The non-believers all shallow and morally-challenged individuals focused on worldly pursuits, while the Christians were all happy and good people. Not my experience in real life. I've known quite a few unhappy, conflicted Christians, who's actions aren't in accord with their faith, and many, many people, either marginally Christian, of other faiths, agnostic, or even atheist who are happy, moral people, living good and full lives. Those characters are conveniently absent in the movie.

The ugly: Considering the limited scope of the movie, I'm not sure what the Muslims were doing there, other than to be a bad example-the sympathy for the girl conflicted about her hijab seemed more to suggest she shouldn't need to wear one, and the father came off as a controlling extremist, who could well be a terrorist. Considering the state of world affairs, do we really need to not-so-subtly bash Islam here? After all, Muslims are on the side of God in this debate, and even acknowledge Jesus as a prophet. Why do they have to be demonized?  The last ugly thing in my mind was the interrogation of the dying professor. I know that many Christians wouldn't have a problem with it, but I'm sorry, when I'm dying, I don't want to be having that conversation, I want to die in peace.

It was the movie the creators wanted it to be, but for me, it could have been so much more. Yes, it has appeal to perhaps a majority of Christians, but I felt it took a rather narrow, and limited approach to a universal question.",1412640000,8,2485,4.888361045130641

Those that criticise it and call themselves Christians should ask themselves why they are being so critical. It is after all a dramatisation of events, it might not tick all your boxes but this movie made money at the Box Office whilst Noah remains a Box Office flop. The production quality is high and it should receive awards for cinematography. The story is dramatically told and I would also recommend the book that accompanies the movie.

Unfortunately most of the other parts of the movie where badly written and badly acted. The need to divide the good people as always good and the bad people as always bad ....I mean really bad..was childish. People are usually both. I hated the ending part with the professor..... So why a 4 star?...because of the young man who played the leading character and the debate that was well written. I wish the rest of the movie was of the same quality.

It is geared mostly towards the younger generation but they are our future and they are who we need to reach.  So what if they like contemporary music?  If it leads them to Christ, so be it.  But this  movie really reaches all ages.  And that is most important.  The word of God needs to reach all of us.  This movie was serious, funny, happy, and sad.  It reached all of my emotions.  Don't be turned off by the negative reviews.  Like the movie says, ""God gave us free will.  Make your own choice and reach your own decision.  If you watch it, you will be so glad that you did.

6418596,1,B00KD5HFJG,"While I realize that people are getting trashed for rating this movie a 1-star, the reality is that this is all that I could honestly give this movie due to the way that it ended.

I typically love Pure Flix films, and those movies that star Kevin Sorbo, David & Andrea White and the crew, but this was well off-base and not celebratory of God at all. The main character - Josh - did a superlative job defending the existence of God and the free will that God offers (which is Biblical), YET when it is time to show what God is like to those who even do not believe - this movie fails big time!!

Perhaps the movie makers did not consider the underlying message they would send....

#1- Don't defend Christianity by putting down other people's walk and making them into violent and villainous characters! That is not fair. There are wonderful Muslims, Atheists, Buddhists, etc.... Just as much as I know all too well that there are mean, prideful, selfish Christians. Therefore, when plotting a movie to uplift Christianity, why not show an honest balance of character on both sides? This was obviously put together to draw a sharp (and unfair) contrast between the Christians and those who are not Christians.

#2- If someone absolutely has to die in the movie in order to be a tear jerker, don't make it so that mysteriously all of the Christians live and the ones who get the death sentence are those who were atheists. That is NOT how God works. And that is the most frustrating part of the movie. This has terrible implications on God's loving and merciful character. God does not do the ""get right or else"" scare tactic. That is one thing that lends toward atheism more than anything! NO! Instead we should have sent the reliable message of the Bible that says that ""For He [God] maketh His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust."" Matthew 5:45. So, why not reveal that? And maybe instead of a plot that HAD to end with death, let it end with healing - healing for the vilest atheist, and happiness imparted to the kindest Christian. Why not professor Atheist finding Josh and restoration and forgiveness occurring?

In the end, It is for the purchaser or renter to decide whether or not they will spend their money on this movie. For me, it was a waste. If only I would have read the reviews FIRST before renting. Never again will I skip that step!

Worst Christian movie I have watched this year. I am so sorry for the end's implications to those who are outside of Christ. That is NOT how God feels about people if they have not made a decision for Him yet. He doesn't just kill bad people and let them make death bed confessions of faith.

May those searching discern the true goodness of God in spite of this movie.",1411344000,18,2775,4.450787401574803

They just love to parade their misguided belief and this film is the most insulting inaccurate pile of garbage to have ever had the dismay to be ranked as a ""christian film""  I can't even begin to tell you how loaded this film is and how hard it tries to make atheist look bad without even realizing that the ""atheist"" isn't even an atheist but an anti theist. We've gone back to stone age ""why do you hate god"" arguments and make Christianity look so so oppressed and unpopular in THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

6418628,1,B00KD5HFJG,"A total waste of time for anyone who is actually concerned whether or not God is dead. This is a movie, a story. It is not a documentary, debate, or anything that would actually satiate one's intellect in regards to the topic. Maybe ten minutes of this entire film is dedicated to the topic of whether or not God exists. The overwhelming majority of this film is just the story of some people's personal lives in the film and is kind of worthless. As someone who finds this topic to be very interesting, I remain unconvinced and entirely unmoved by this film and their presentation of their 'argument'. This film has largely nothing to do with proving that God exists, let alone that Yahweh/Jesus is God. I can't determine which is more sad/pathetic- how bad this movie was or the fact that a friend had suggested this movie to me assuring me that ""its good"".

For anyone who hopes and prays their young ones will retain their faith as they leave home and especially as they go to college, get this film watch it with your kids.

6418681,5,B00KD5HFJG,Great picture!,1410825600,,14,6.5
6418682,5,B00KD5HFJG,"I first have to address something that this film had that is, surprisingly, rarely seen in Christian movies or television series: mention of Christ. For those who don't know, the word Christian was first used in Antioch and was given to followers of Christ. So, it is disappointing to watch something that is based on Christianity, but never mentions Jesus. Perhaps that is because the makers of those shows wanted it to appeal to Jewish and Islamic cultures as well as Christians. Perhaps they didn't want to ""offend"" anyone by speaking about Jesus. I can only guess. But, having a Christian film and never mentioning Christ is a bit like getting lost and winding up in a different country. In Christian culture Jesus is talked about and often. So, thank you, to the writer's of this movie.

I would have liked for there to have been more debate in the classroom as there are some areas of Christian apologetics that were not addressed in the movie, but I liked what there was.

I think as a whole that this was a very good movie. It addressed issues that can be quite common for a Christian in their lifetime. The main character had to face losing a lot and had to give up a lot to do the right thing. Another character lost her family, her home, everything of value to her here on earth. She was given a chance to keep it all and all she had to do was renounce Christ, but she refused. This follows Matthew 10:32 - 33 Whoever acknowledges me before others, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven. But whoever disowns me before others, I will disown before my Father in heaven.""

There is one plot about a Muslim girl who basically gets abused from her father because she accepts Christianity.  I'm not sure I like the way that portrayed the Muslims.  Not all are extremists but then again I'm no authority on that.  Then there was the storyline about the woman with cancer.  That was a total downer and really kind of took away from the movie in my opinion.

I am personally a Catholic so strongly believes in God because of everything he has done for me threw all my years on this earth so far and also for the people I care about plus family members.  But back to the movie, the movie had mutiple parts that made me actually cry in four scenes.  The characters Dean Cain played and Kevin Sorbo made me want to punch them in the face for being so crude and rude.  The acting was good compare to some people reviews plus storyline,  I know many people have issues with some of these type movies because of how their religious views are, but I agree with the title of the movie that God's Not Dead and like one of the main characters said in the movie ""very much alive.""  In life some parts and aspects are not fair and can be a challenge but I feel that if you stand up for your Faith and stand tall God will watch over you and protect you each and every single day of your life until your face to face with him back home in Heaven where we as believers know that is our home.  I also speak from personal experience in college where my Professor in Philosophy gave me a paper to write that had to prove God existence well he was an athiest and with my paper he said that thanks to my paper he wasn't an athiest but not quite to point believe in God but least my paper gave him a very good starting point of an idea to take from their onward.",1410566400,2,1471,4.051724137931035

6418719,5,B00KD5HFJG,"There was a lot of moral issues packed into this movie for its short length.  Each of the issues could have easily taken whole time to fully explore.  Instead glimpses of the different personalities and lifestyles were given to show their perspective on the issue which Professor wanted his students to sign acceptance contracts with him that God is nonexistent.  The story is primarily about the one student who refused to sign that statement and is challenged by the professor to prove that God exists.  From the very beginning, the student acknowledges that Christians cannot PROVE God exists anymore than non-christians can prove He does not exist or never existed.  The question is how much ""proof"" is necessary for people to ""BELIEVE"" by choice, and the class acts as the jury examining both the case presented by the Professor and the Christian Student.  I did not particularly focus on the background stories of the voting students as I only needed a sketch to see from where there perspective was coming.  Each of those students could have had their own story in a saga.  I found the arguments presented by the Christian student very interesting and enlightening for any young Christian being challenged in the world today, especially in schools, to take note. The ending of the movie was not particularly beneficial except to point out that the decision is personal one and never too late, but in all honesty my interest in the movie was the ""jury trial"" and arguments.  I think young people watching this movie may well find some facts to research and ammunition to use in defending their faith when necessary, especially in the halls of higher learning.  Then ending could have been much more realistic in informing that presence of a Pastor is not necessary to accept the gift of salvation.  However, in my opinion, it certainly did make the point that ministers are not necessarily more reverent than members of their congregation--they are only human just like everyone else, and we should not expect them to be perfect.  I find this an excellent teaching tool for young adults who may be challenged by the world they live in and intimidated by having different opinions from highly educated persons around them  It does not deal with all the questions people pose about Virgin Birth, parting of the Red Sea, etc.  It simply deals with reasons to believe in God and reasons why we should not allow the highly educated teaching staff dictate such decisions in our life.  There is a lot for family or classroom discussion.",1410480000,6,2535,4.862790697674418

6418729,5,B00KD5HFJG,"After Kirk Cameron's Left Behind movies, there was a daunting fear over every Christian every time a faith-based film comes out. And in many cases, those fears were realized when watching the movies. But every now and then, few and far between, a good one comes out. This is definitely one of those times.

If non-believers get weird feeling around people who close their eyes and seemingly talk to ""no one,"" and get together and sing songs about ""someone who doesn't seem present,"" I have no idea why movie makers who seek to evangelize via media think it'll look better on the screen. God's Not Dead does a good job of bridging that gap between the non-believers perception and the believer's perception.

The scientific battle that the move plot centers on is nothing new, however perhaps if non-believers give the movie its duration time, perhaps like the audience in the movie will be somewhat moved to realize that God's existence is at least testable. The other subplots of the movie also show case real-life situations.

If I could, I would might take a half-star off, because is it just me, or is every couple presented in this film (okay, besides the Duck Dynasty clan) have one good, lovable person, and another broken, complete jerk? Yes, jerks like this movie presents are out there, but I just felt like it was kind of awkward that every couple had a jerk and a good person.",1410480000,9,1388,4.703703703703703

6418770,3,B00KD5HFJG,"Warning - Spoilers ahead.

This is a decent enough movie for most of its runtime and would normally have earned a 4 out of 5 from me. In case you do not already know, it is about a boy defending his Christian faith against a college professor who is an atheist and essentially wants to impose that view on his philosophy class. During the course of the movie, there are subplots involving others dealing with the struggles of their faith, or lack thereof.

What lowers the rating for me is the ending, where all the Christians of the story end up at a Christian rock concert, as if that is the end all be all of what it is to be a Christian. I believe a montage of video clips, depicting the various characters supporting each other and taking strength from their faith (some new found) while facing their difficulties (one dying from cancer, one abandoned by her family, one losing his fiance, and one death) would have been a much more touching and powerful ending. The concert was weak and superficial, with a bunch of text messages sent all over, that does not in any way capture the true value of the Faith. (In fact, one character is a new convert, newly expressing his desire to be a Christian, and the concert is the first place he is taken.)
It just seems to cheapen all the struggles experienced beforehand.",1410307200,83,1317,4.483333333333333

6418789,1,B00KD5HFJG,"I was going to keep my silence, but cannot hold it any longer. My wife and I rented this movie and decided to watch it together after both kids were shown it at church camp and said they liked it. T-shirts were given out. This thing was really promoted. But I had a feeling about this movie. I hoped my suspicions were wrong. Many Christian films are lacking a bit in production quality or have sappy acting and dialogue, but I can overlook much of this if there is a good story, a good moral. Some films are really quite excellent. My wife and I are both Christians, but after 20 minutes we had to shut this movie off. Neither of us could take it any longer. It represents much of what is terribly wrong with politically charged Christianity today. I went ahead and read what the rest of the plot is, no surprises...  its not a journey I am willing to take when so much of the plot, dialogue, and characterizations amount to lies and straw-man arguments. Jesus said the truth will set you free. This movie does not uphold the truth so much as erode away at it, or heap so much bitterness and twisting of facts as to make it wholly un-palpable. It is basically a conglomeration of Facebook-style posts or email forwards you typically see from fundamentalists that tend to demonize non-believers, college professors, Muslims, etc., while picturing Christians as innocent and terribly persecuted. It does not seek understanding, It does not help those who want to follow Jesus be more like him, or follow His teachings... instead, it really violates some basic principles of the Gospel. It seeks to indoctrinate us for an imagined war that is being waged in the minds of ultra-conservatives and fear-mongers in the political arena. It seeks to divide and tells lies, in order to get Christians angry and politically motivated. No thank you.",1410220800,"2,197",1838,4.672839506172839

This film presents real life challenges that our teens and young adult face whether in their classrooms, relationships or in families.  It is great to see God's side of the coin for a change..  Working with teens , I found media like this an opportunity for us to show kids the God is not dead.  The best line in the movie is "" If God does not exist, why do you hate Him so much"" .  T he music and the salvation that closes out the movie shows that while life has many bumps in the road, God has his way getting us to His Home where we belong.  I also bought the sound track  which I listen to in the car to get me through the traffic.  The special effect of this film  is that it gets you thinking what life is really about.

6418810,2,B00KD5HFJG,"My wife and I just got through looking at the movie Gods Not Dead, the movie had so many flaws that I lost count, and bye the way my wife and I our Christians. The acting was just subpar the only exception being Kevin Sorbo playing a God hating semi-confrontation atheist, which is not true most atheist I've met our very quiet and do not wish to discuss their religious beliefs with anyone. Even though religiously I disagree with atheist I do not like how they where depicted in this movie. On the Christian side of things we where depicted as self-righteous, uncaring self-absorbed group of people. Furthermore, for instance (Do Not Read Any More From Here If You Have Not Seen The Movie, Spoiler Alert) when Kevin Sorbo's atheist character is hit by a car and eventually dies later on in the movie the Christian character is dancing and proclaims this is a night of celebration! Celebration...really? For who? you or the guy you saw get hit and killed by a run-away car. And what's up with Duck Dynasty doing their cameo appearance in this movie!? I mean what for? I guess that was a easy pay check for them. I love Christian movies if and when their done right which have been far and few and in between. Kevin Sorbo's character being a philosophy professor telling the class to write down on a piece of paper the words God is dead, and no one speaking up about this anti-religious act accept one student actor Shane Harper's character, out of the whole class you mean to tell me only one person speaks up? Please! I work at a university if any philosophy professor, or any professor for that matter was to challenge a group of students religious rights or trying to fail them because of it. He or she would be reprimanded or fired in a heart beat not to mention it would be all over the campus news paper further embarrassing the individual. As I've stated earlier there are a lot of good Christian movies out there unfortunately God's Not Dead isn't one of them.",1410134400,8,1969,4.518207282913165

6418830,1,B00KD5HFJG,"If this movie preached hatred against Jews, would Amazon even list it? Yet a movie that stereotypes atheists in a manner similar to Nazi stereotyping of Jews in the 1930s seems acceptable. That's because in the United States in the early 21st century, it is perfectly acceptable to many people, including religious leaders who should know better, to bash atheists. In looking at other one-star reviews, I was pleased to see several by Christians who aren't buying into the message of hate delivered by this poor excuse for a movie.

It really is a badly done film. The acting can hardly be called acting. To say the characters are cardboard cutouts is to insult cardboard. The situations presented are incredibly unrealistic, the product of fevered minds of the religiously unbalanced. Right off the bat, we're presented with a university professor subverting the whole purpose of his course from an introduction to philosophy to a single-minded promotion of atheism. He demands a ""loyalty oath"" from his students at their first meeting. Seriously, does anyone believe this actually happens? OK, loyalty oaths aren't fiction, sad to say, but loyalty oaths to atheism in the US, where nearly 80% of the population claims to be Christian?

I stopped watching after the scene in which the atheist villain physically and verbally abuses the fundamentalist hero. The professor seems, beyond all reason, afraid that a kid just out of high school is going to best him, even though the professor himself set up the unlikely scenario. From what I've read and seen, apparently the little freshman who could perseveres and one by one his classmates, all of whom are presumed to be non-churchgoers, stand up in support of him and his brilliant (so we're led to believe) defense of religion. Then, just to top it off and provide the ending in which evil is soundly defeated, a requirement of such a simple-minded morality play, the prof walks in front of a car and dies.

Ding dong! The atheist's dead! Everyone cheer while texting your friends just like the crazy Duck Dynasty guy (who likes the idea of marrying underage girls and killing Muslims) has ordered.",1410048000,5,2149,4.963888888888889

This movies is doing great job in apologetic, debunking main atheist arguments against existence of God. VERY intellectual movie. Strongly recommended for teenagers.

Another said she had ""been meaning"" to see it. As her boyfriend's eyesight is bad, I doubt they go to movies. Now she can watch it.
From at least two I did not expect a response, but maybe they will watch it just because it has Kevin Sorbo.

6418854,1,B00KD5HFJG,"Know that I am a Born Again Christian whose belief in God is steadfast.  I couldn't watch more than fifteen minutes of this sad excuse for a film.  The very idea that a professor of philosophy would force his class to write ""God is Dead"" and then sign it or risk a zero for thirty percent of their grade is absurd on its face.  Philosophy is a quest for knowledge - it opens doors, it engages in discussions, it searches for truth within the mysteries of human nature and the universe.  The professor does not even know how to pronounce such names as ""Bertrand Russell"" or ""Bertold Brecht"".  As if that were not enough, the young Christian's girlfriend asks that he renounce his faith so he will not flunk the course.  PLEEEEZE!!!  What would come next I wonder?  His parents angrily telling him to dump his faith for a bachelor's degree?  I knew full well where it all was headed - the young Christian, like a modern day St. George, strikes the dragon of inequity and faithlessness dead and is applauded as a hero - perhaps canonized before he graduates.  One does not prove, nor have to prove, that God exists.  If there were proof, man would not need the gift of faith given to us by a loving God.  Those who feel the need to prove God's existence lack faith.",1409961600,9,1262,4.415584415584416

6418889,5,B00KD5HFJG,"Amazing film about faith through the fire of pressure that this world puts on you. If you are not a Christian you will probably not like this film. But if you are a Christian then you will probably be refreshed in knowing that this is a movie about more than just men and women sleeping around, its not about getting drunk or partying it is not about trying to climb the corporate ladder. This is a film about having the courage to stand up for what you believe in regardless of the consequences.

6418959,1,B00KD5HFJG,"For all those giving this fil 5 star reviews, I am forced to assume that you have not actually watched it, you have watched it and because it supports your misguided and anti-rational beliefs or you just have no taste or judgement in the area of film.  It is clearly the work of someone who believes Jack Chick's tracts are holy writ (and is unaware that the one this is based on is a very old chestnut of the religiously ignorant crowd (Jacks' has the student who best's the prof ,, the most common one it is ripped from has the prof say if God can keep a piece of chalk he drops from breaking when it hits the floor  -it ""miraculously "" gets caught on(!!!) his pant leg, rolls gently to the floor, not breaking and prof slinks off defeated (Jack has the student just argue ""better"" (no, not really, but Jack writes it as if the students are not very bright..  Anyway, it is a load, a very short and silly thing to base a movie on and a fraud and a canard on hose who take it a being even remotely real.  As is this movie.

By the by, if you are looking for a movie that does this extremely and effectively well (hey, I am helpful even when I think one side is way wrong - unless they are terrorists, which I have a Very Bad View of), I strongly suggest you look up and watch  The Spitfire Grill.  Amazon has it, it is a very Christian story that took me half the movie before it hit me what it was  and how it was doing it - and it beats the daylights out of the piece of rubbish the film I am here reviewing here is.  Though when the price gets down (and I suspect that won't be long) to under 2.00 I will purchase a copy for film studies programs  (I do that among other things.  It will be great with Spitfire to show a comparison of subtle well done positioning and blatant over the top in your face rectumry.",1409616000,3,1815,4.070224719101123

6418969,4,B00KD5HFJG,I work with Junior High aged children and wanted to see if we could use this movie as a thought provoker in class. We will be able to use snippets but wouldn't have them see the whole thing. The story lines jump around a bit and don't flow smoothly. Some of the side stories need to be developed a bit better but overall it is worth seeing.,1409529600,,340,4.08955223880597

6418971,3,B00KD5HFJG,"This movie, which is seemingly well-liked by many Christians, I admit to not being too overly excited about, and I'd like to share why.

First, we can hopefully all agree that there is definitely a lot of persecution of Christians going on across our college campuses. There are indeed many professors that are very antagonistic towards the Christian faith and belief system.

The plot of this movie is based around this notion, but I've got to say that the plot of this film was INCREDIBLY dramatized and contrived, in an almost ""surreal"" kind of way. I can tell you the moment it crossed the threshold for me, too. I thought it a bit much that this professor was requiring his students to write on a piece of paper that God is dead in order to not get a bad grade in his class. But I just went with that. And I thought it a bit much that this professor challenged the Christian student to prove the opposite in front of the class in such an overly hostile way. But I just rolled with that too. But whatever believability threshold might have existed they completely crossed when they had the professor go after the student in a one-on-one moment in the hallway where, with much hostility, he tells the student that if he ever makes him look bad again, he will not let him live it down (or something to that effect).

The unbelievability factor goes on from there, with the student's girlfriend of 6 years who he had met at a Christian event and obviously felt good enough about for 6 years, dumps him for wanting to stand up for his faith. Then there's the muslim girl that comes to Christ, the communist chinese boy that comes to Christ, the atheistic journalist who comes to Christ...And the money-hungry executive who gets rid of his girlfriend when she develops cancer... Throw in a Duck Dynasty star and a hit Christian music group and song, and well...Talk about a contrived movie. I've seen a secular review of this movie refer to it as ""Christian porn"", and I must admit, I completely understand what they meant. We all know that real life events get dramatized in the movies. Though this movie wasn't based on a specific real-life event (that I am aware of), it was dramatized WAY too heavy handedly in my opinion, and this movie just came across way too contrived to me. It was not very realistic in most any sense. I do tend to think that some unbelievers would probably laugh themselves silly at this movie (at us Christians that is) and so I do think consideration should be given before showing this to a non-believer.

As for the actual arguments presented in this movie, I thought there were some decent ones made by the student, though they were fairly simplified and limited. I do agree with a seeming premise of this film that most of those who oppose God so rigorously do so NOT out of true intellectual honesty in really believing that the arguments support them (even though they will claim this), but rather out of personal pain and beliefs about God - often that occurred as a young child. And it often comes down to the issue of reconciling a good God with this world of pain and sickness and death.

I do have to give the movie studio, Pure Flix, a minor shout out for at least improving how they address this subject from what they've done in some of their previous efforts. They did an absolutely terrible job of this in their movie from a few years back called ""Escape"". At least they got better in this one by declaring that God is good - numerous times even using the rather clichd ""God is good all the time and all the time God is good"" statement. So at least they tried to show that God is good and that He is the one that offers real hope. However, as for the answer of why God allows the pain and suffering, I thought this movie's answer was just plain not all that good. It's the standard Christian answer in many Christian circles, but it just plain is not a very good one in my opinion. Basically this movie's answer is: God's ways are higher than our ways and we just need to trust him. That answer is not a very satisfactory answer in my view.

The acting and production quality was reasonable, though I wouldn't say stellar on either front. I do like the Newsboys' song ""God's Not Dead"" that is played at the end of the movie (though I liked this song for over 2 years before I saw the movie).

All in all, this movie could potentially be a worthwhile one for Christians - and I would say judging from what I've heard from some Christians that it might even be extremely well liked. I do believe it may have some value, especially in giving consideration to some of the underpinnings of our faith, but I do definitely have the concerns stated above.

6418973,5,B00KD5HFJG,Watched it twice the first day and again once two days later.  The most haunting scene was when the stockbroker speaks in rhetorical fashion to his dementia ridden mother as to why she is in her present condition after always having been a praying woman and was always kind and never did anything bad in all her life....and he is bad and nothing bad ever happens to him....  better than a tract.,1409443200,2,395,4.472222222222222

6418986,5,B00KD5HFJG,"This was a wonderful film.  It shows you exactly how some of the people who are supposed to be shaping our childrens' minds are, instead, leading them into the teacher's/professor's way of thinking.  Yes, I'm a Christian but I feel if you go to college you're there to learn about what you're interested in doing with your life.  After all, the parents' pay enough.",1409356800,2,365,4.671875
6418987,1,B00KD5HFJG,"This film is filled with nothing but tired cliches, offensive stereotypes, and utterly facile theological arguments. It is truly a disappointment that a film can be made almost entirely to bash atheists, and people applaud it.",1409356800,5,226,5.305555555555555
6418988,5,B00KD5HFJG,Great movie! I enjoyed it very much from beginning to the end.,1409356800,,62,4.25
6418989,4,B00KD5HFJG,"Most people in life leave God because of some event they experienced where they believed a Just God would have never allowed that to happen.  In the movie, it is the professor whose mother died when he was twelve.  Having an 18 year old freshman take on a college professor and win the philosophical argument as he did, was indeed a stretch.  The route I would have preferred the freshman to have taken and more plausible is one based upon the following facts and statistics.  One, roughly ninety percent of everyone and anyone who has lived on earth are now dead.  Two, worldwide, there are roughly 150,000 deaths per day, and roughly 100,000 of those are due to aging.  Three, on an annual basis, we lose about 56 MILLION people, or 32 MILLION due to aging.  My point being that to make a correlation between the death of the professor's mother and the existence of God is ludicrous.  I found the professor being unforgiving of God because he really wanted a different past.  What DID shock me was not the movie but the list of legal cases at the end of the movie that have taken place or are on-going in our schools, colleges and universities where a student's First Amendment Rights are being denied them.  That is both appalling and very scary!",1409356800,,1249,4.560538116591928

The movie is full of logical and argumentation fallacies and is nothing but an exercise in psychological projection.

There is one silver lining to the movie: it teaches you how NOT to construct an argument.",1409270400,3,422,5.918032786885246

6418996,5,B00KD5HFJG,"This movie has a sound foundation in reality.  As a former analyst of Soviet affairs for the US Government, I can attest that the vicious nature of the atheist professor is not a fiction. Academia is rife with Marxists who act in just this way and will not tolerate any independence of thought.  For example, when I interviewed for the Soviet Area Studies at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, I was told I had to keep my anti-communist opinions to myself or my grades would suffer and I would get no assistance from the university.  As someone once said, ""Love is as seminal to Christianity as hatred is to communism.""  It was no accident then that the communists repeatedly appealed to hatred.  The greatest mass murderers in history were atheists - the Nazis and the communists, together in less than 200 years they murdered close to two hundred million people.  Hitler raved, ""You cannot be a German and a Christian.""  The only ones who tried to stop him were committed Catholic and Protestant Germans.  This movie portrays just such a struggle between hatred and love.  I cannot recommend it too highly!.",1409270400,,1112,4.75

6418998,1,B00KD5HFJG,"I feel a bit exhausted at the task of writing my negative review of this film.  Mainly because I have discussed several times over with various people, and written about it on social media.  However, I still feel the need to share my thoughts on Amazon, although I will not do it at length as I have on other sources.

Here is a list of just SOME of the core reasons why this movie was a failure:

1) It is fake.  What?  That's right, this is what I would call an ""Evangelical Fantasy"".  This movie portrays itself as the world we live in.  It's not creating a pseudo-world or some science fiction reality.  This movie is suppose to be OUR world and they wish to tell a story in it.  It just so happens I do not know of a world where EVERY main character gets ""saved"".  In the end, it all works out where every person decides to follow Jesus Christ as their Lord.  This film is DISHONEST.  It is giving an image that does not reflect real life.  And not just so concerning a person's decision to follow Christ, but in various ways throughout the movie.  For example, will a FRESHMAN at a college ""beat"" a well-learned philosophy teacher in a battle of ""Does God exist or not?""  Will he, after three 20 minute sessions, best this brilliant professor, resulting in EVERY SINGLE STUDENT STANDING UP to applause his great triumph???  Only to, immediately after, have a chinese student tell the victorious freshman ""I gave my life to Jesus""?  This is some rosy, fantastical world that is NOT portraying how life really is and how people actually respond to this given situations.

Again, isn't it so nice and warm that, at the end of the movie when the demonic, truly evil, atheistic professor, gets hit by a car and is dying, does so right in front of a pastor who can come to his aide and lead him to Christ before he dies?  I can list SO MANY instances in this film where it was so unbelievable....literally....and I do not wish to lay it all out here. I was so disappointed in this film, that when the overly dramatic, unrealistic, unbelievably ""coincidental"" encounter with the dying atheist and the pastor occurred, that I almost turned off the film even though there was only 5 minutes left (I didn't because my wife wanted to finish it).  Or how about the Christian daughter who was excommunicated by her father to only be dancing and singing with a smile at a Christian Rock concert later that evening?!!!

But allow me to add that at the end, there is a challenge to Christians to text all their friends with ""God is not dead"".  As if, somehow, this highly persuasive and convincing argument ""God is not dead"" appearing on the phones of non-believers will make a dramatic impact on the lives of Western Culture for Christ!  Yes, my words are dripping with sarcasm because I am SO ANGRY that Christian film in America cannot produce REALISTIC and TOUGH films that engage the dark realities of life without constantly being consumed with making an entertainment venue a medium to share the Gospel.  Instead of creating films that express Kingdom Virtues and Values in the midst of dark and terrible situations, they create unrealistic scenarios, unbelievable outcomes, all to have the opportunity to share the ""sinner's prayer"" for the one chance that someone in the audience may actually say it.  And, in the process, millions become more disgusted of Christian film.  But hey...we got ""that one person"" right?

The more I think about this film, I know they wanted it to reach the ""un-churched"" but the reality is.....this movie was for the church.  I don't mean that in a good way.  It was a romanticized and fantastical form of preaching the gospel that was appealing to Church people who want ""cheap conversion entertainment"".  But I am sure they WANTED it to reach out to the ""un-churched"" but the numbers show that they failed.  Consider the money this film made....how much of it was from non-believers?  I guarantee most of it was from Christians and that saddens me.  Christian film makers isolate themselves and do damage because of how unreal their movies are.

All to say, this movie is something I would NEVER recommend.  It's not real.  Period.

It's not real life and thus is virtually void of it's power because of it.",1409270400,33,4237,4.622489959839357

The message was fantastic and I think it did a good job showing the struggle of Christians in a world where atheists are seen as better than Christians for various reasons.

The story had way too many characters and subplots, needed major editing, was filled with clichs, had bad acting and stilted, unbelievable dialogue.  In addition, it would likely be offensive to many. We were so relieved when it was over. Truly, it was the worst film we've seen all year.

6419032,2,B00KD5HFJG,"Well, I've just watched the movie ""God's Not Dead"" and I suppose I'm glad about any movie advocating the reality of God. It's attempt is sincere. I'm also aware movies, by there nature, sometimes require extremes and stretches in reality to cover, most thoroughly, the purpose and points of its intent. (The 1996 movie ""Twister"" is quite an example of that; continuous major tornados in such a relatively brief time.) Sadly this soap opera type movie meaning to endorse God being real uses such unrealistic settings, circumstances and events and these situations become more challenging to believe than the issue of whether God's real or not. A God-hating atheist professor that makes his students write ""god's not real"" for a college assignment, has a Christian girlfriend? After a six-year relationship a Christian girl leaves her Christian boyfriend for taking a stand for God? God making three separate cars not start so the preacher-driver can happen upon a dying man in a car accident! Nearly every atheist in this movie becomes a believer in God. Too many ""Oh Brother""s. More `miracles' happen in this movie than most events recorded in the Bible. If the movie does good for others that's great. But for me, a movie that's meant to show God is real ought, at least, use real-life believable events, not way out, unrealistic fiction. Unimpressive.",1409011200,3,1353,5.017777777777778

For me, first and foremost this film is very helpful for young people that are faced with the challenges of standing firm for one's faith.  Secondly, I'm hoping that talented people are encouraged, the film industry will raise the bar only when gifted people start contributing talents to the movie making universe.  I believe a lot of talented people are not using their talents enough.  Find a way to put your gift(s) to work for higher quality movies.

6419049,5,B00KD5HFJG,"I enjoyed this movie very much. I saw it once with my buddy and a second time with my wife. We bought the DVD so we can share it with others.

Keven Sorbo did a great job playing the part of an arrogant, antagonistic atheist who was an erstwhile Christian. Dean Cain played a hard-nosed, heartless sort--way different from his Lois & Clark persona. Shane Harper played a believable part of a beleaguered freshman college student because he refused to sign the professor's ""God Is Dead"" statement. As Josh, Shane, had to balance his time with his classes, extra studies to defend his faith in God, and keep his fiancee, although she was far too materialistic to care that Josh was defending his faith with his philosophy professor.

It was heartbreaking to see the young woman, a former Muslim who became a Christian, get betrayed by her younger brother and disowned by her father.

I had a very different experience in college. I became a Christian during my senior year as a microbiology major. I read a remark in the university newspaper and decided to respond to it. The response was printed even though it was about 1500 words in length. I wish I kept a copy of that. However, all my professors and classmates learned of my conversion and my stance concerning evolution because of that lengthy letter to the editor. My biochemistry professor invited me to attend his chemistry club, and while we were looking over some biochemical pathway, he said, ""Wow, that's enough to make you believe in God."" My professor for Bacterial Physiology & Cytology, clearly an atheist, tailored the final exam to challenge my new-found faith and belief in creationism by asking us to explain how the first cell wall arose. It was an essay exam and I made a sarcastic remark or two and got downgraded to a B+ but still got an A for the class.

saw this movie. My husband and I along with other friends have adult children in the Collage system
and I can honestly say I am angered at what teachers get away with. This movie exposes this and is a
punch in the face of Atheism. This movie states it's case that God is not dead like a lot of people would
like him to be and abolish him from existence so our personal and national conscience would die. Look
where that has gotten us. The absolute arrogance and sense of entitlement that manifest itself
by saying I am God do not screw with me mentality that exists among teachers and staff is breath taking.
Sadly, this mind set is so very pervasive in our society as a whole today. This movie is awesome and a
joy to watch. Kevin Sorbo did a fantastic job playing the professor and Cathy Lee Gifford's daughter Cassidy
is in this movie. This movie also shows what happens to a family member who is Muslim and made the decision
to come to Christ. The movie depicts the reality of that decision. Some violence  what was shown to get the point across

6419070,2,B00KD5HFJG,"I decided to rent this movie out of curiosity. There has been a lot of hype about it, so it piqued my interest.

I'm not  going to repeat all the objections raised about the movie's plot and the philosophical objections some people have regarding the movie's premise. I'm going to make a simple point.

I don't deny that there are intolerant atheists in the world who belittle people of faith. Kevin Sorbo certainly personifies such a person. Also, I'm willing to grant that Josh presents an argument of God as the divine source of life that is certainly reasonable.

However, my problem lies with the leap from God's existence to Christianity. After Martin hears Josh's ""proof"" of God's existence, he tells Josh ""Your decision to prove that God is not dead has affected me greatly. I've decided to follow Jesus!""

Huh? How can Martin--or anybody, for that matter?--  automatically make that leap?

ALL religions have their creation myths. It would have made just as much sense  for Martin to hear Josh's argument and then state ""I've decided to become a Muslim""; or ""I've decided to become a Hindu""; or ""I've decided to practice Zoroastrianism"".

Not only that, but Christianity borrowed its central myths, including the Trinity, the Resurrection, and the Virgin Birth, from various Egyptian cults from the ancient world.

Is belief in God reasonable? I think so. Can one make the leap from a creator God to Christianity? Sorry, I'm not convinced.",1408838400,4,1706,5.477099236641221

6419075,5,B00KD5HFJG,"I'll start by saying that I almost never buy movies, because I rarely watch them more than once, but the hype on this one got me to buy it.  I haven't regretted the purchase, and have already watched it twice.

Despite what some reviewers keep saying, I thought the acting was pretty good, especially for a Christian movie.  The professor in particular really sold his role.  The script was good, though it occasionally felt forced or unnatural.  Unlike many other reviewers, I liked the many side stories in the movie.  I think they gave it a certain busyness and energy that made it feel like college.  The actual argument of the movie was pretty good too, bringing up several common atheist points and countering them well.  The best part of the movie, for me, was the message.  God's Not Dead.

So that's my review, but I wanted to respond to some common complaints I've heard in other reviews.

First, many people have complained that the movie isn't realistic, that no professor would challenge a student's faith.  I can say from experience that some professors will happily tell you that your faith is wrong, and even mock Christianity while teaching.  I don't know if a college would allow the challenge the professor issues in the movie, but it's a movie.  Exaggeration is normal in movies.

Second, many atheists don't like the way the professor is made out as the villain, or think that the movie makes out atheists to be terrible, oppressive people.  That's not the case.  The professor was not supposed to represent all atheists.  He was supposed to represent atheists who try to force atheism on everyone around them, as if they have something against faith in God.  The student who challenged him specifically said he was arguing so that the other students could decide for themselves, and not be forced to believe what others think they should believe.

Third, I've heard some complaints of stereotyping/racism in the movie.  These complaints are generally directed towards the Muslim girl and the Chinese boy.  Again, these characters were not supposed to represent all Muslims or all Chinese people.  Neither of their stories was ridiculous or unfounded, but neither story was representative of their respective demographics.

And fourth, most of the remaining complaints I've seen weren't directed at the movie but at Christians themselves.  If you have a problem with Christianity, why would you watch a Christian movie?  It seems many of these people watched it only to mock it and attack Christians for liking it and producing it.  Before the movie was even out, there were people dissecting the trailer, looking for parts to make fun of and use to bash Christianity.  These are the atheists represented by the professor in the movie.  They aren't satisfied in their own atheism.  They want to force it on others.  They want people to feel bad for believing anything other than atheism.  Their reviews are often more hateful than critical.",1408752000,,2961,4.907258064516129

6419081,2,B00KD5HFJG,"...but that's mostly because the Christianity in this movie is the ""Cultural Christianity"" of youth groups and Christian rock bands.

In other words, not really the Christianity as revealed by God in the Christian scriptures.

*Sigh*.

So, the basic story is that a Christian freshman takes an intro philosophy course at university and has a professor who is a raging atheist.

No news there; been there and done that (as have thousands of other Christians who've attended university).  The professor agrees to allow the Christian to defend the existence of God, gives him 3 classes to present his case (for around 20 minutes a class) and then allows all the students to decide the victor.  The student gives arguments that weren't great, and if you know anything about apologetics (or especially presuppositional apologetics), you'll find this part to be quite unconvincing...though it's not surprising that a freshman university student basically quotes popular apologists like Lennox and Strobel (as if any atheist gives them credibility at all), goes off about free will and how God's over-riding moral quality is that he loves you like a teenage girl...

His professor eventually cannot overcome the student's unassailable arguments which leads to a break down where he screams and reveals his angry heart to the student.  I guess that's the way many high school students think these debates actually turn out if you just skillfully apply some bumper-sticker truths, but North America is full of ""ex-Christians"" who bear testimony to how well bumper-sticker theology stands up to rational scrutiny.

Sadly, most atheists with terminal degrees are in a completely different category than Sorbo's character...and not all of them believe in free will (which basically de-fangs 95% of popular-level Christian apologetics).  Still, it's a movie and serious atheist arguments make for boring cinema, so I guess that's understood.

*Spoiler alert*

You'll get all warm and fuzzy when the atheist professor is hit by a car on the way to a Newsboys concert at the end and makes a ""deathbed conversion"", just so everything is nicely wrapped up (which always happens, right?).

Wait.

Going to a Newsboys concert?

Well, that's apparently what a PhD philosophy professor does when they're ready to ""get back to God"".

No prayer or repentance.

No convictions from the scripture.

Just get your coat and run to a Christian rock concert.

Again, this movie is clearly aimed at ill-informed youth group kids who wouldn't know any better.

The REALLY horrible part was that the atheist professor is dating a ""Christian"" girl who's one of his ex-students, and her pastor knows about it but apparently doesn't care that they're likely shacked-up (which the movie doesn't explicitly show even though the girl herself comments on how she feels guilty that they're ""unequally yoked"" and they're unbelievers in the 21st century).  The pastor is confused about the gospel, doesn't care about his congregants living in blatant sin, and is alarmingly shallow (i.e. he laments that, unlike a missionary, he's not doing ""real"" ministry...).

Again, I'll chalk this up to the fact that this is aimed at youth group kids, and we don't expect much from youth group kids, right?

Yikes.

There's a third and fourth story line; a Muslim girl is a secret Christian who gets discovered and is kicked out of her house but somehow recovers alarmingly quickly; enough to get to a Newsboys concert as well (I sense a theme here...).  There's also an aggressive atheist blogger who mocks a guy from Duck Dynasty, gets cancer (and dumped by her ""rich and greasy"" boyfriend), and then gets ""led to the Lord"" (which means ""vague theism"") by Newsboys with a gospel that I don't recognize at all and can't seem to find in the scriptures.  Apparently, Christianity basically revolves around the Christian rock concerts and knowing that God loves you super much because you're super awesome.

This whole movie is clearly aimed at ill-informed youth group kids: it's kitschy, shallow and doesn't dive into any of the serious questions with any sort of serious approach...which makes sense given the target audience.  But the theology is horrible, the pastor is incompetent, and the whole ""Christianity"" is nothing short of the ""cultural Christianity"" that is a theological plague in the evangelical world.

Movies like this make Christianity look actually irrational and do more damage than the atheists whom these movies are supposed to combat.  It may encourage ill-informed teenage believers who are scared of going to university, but it does so by giving them false and shallow hope, based on frightfully unbiblical and shallow theology, to prepare for the onslaught that most secular universities have in store.

This movie also doesn't prove that God's not dead.

It just proves that cultural Christianity sells to people who've already drank the Kool-Aid.",1408752000,136,4921,5.158690176322418

Yes, but this is never mentioned by the atheists who are too uneducated to make any kind of statement on the subject.

I found this film to be spiritually compelling. Not all the Christians in this movie are perfect people. Josh stands alone most of the time and must take on a very experienced university professor who claims to be an atheist. I was sort of shocked by Josh's girlfriend's reaction to his need to tell people the truth. Didn't she believe in God too?

6419103,3,B00KD5HFJG,"An example of a great Christian movie is  Kirk Cameron's Fireproof, in which you have guy struggling with his faith. It's real and it hits home.

I can't say the same about God's Not Dead because whether intentionally or by accident, it is written in a way I think a Pharisee would write it.

Yes, the creators of this file are well-intentioned and I commend them for that.

But unfortunately,the characters are cartoon-like, cardboard stereotypes which largely do not exist in real life. The Pharisees held themselves up as being better because the followed the rules. I would like to have seen the main character struggle with the pressure to conform vs. doing the right thing. That would make a great theme in itself. I would have like to have seen the professor as more of a good guy on the outside that the audience is almost sympathetic to. Wouldn't that make you think? Wouldn't that make you wonder about who is casting the first stone?

In this movie -- the Christians are basically perfect, model citizens. The atheists are depicted as buffoons.

Yet in real life there are very kind heart, good, charitable people who happen to be atheists.

And in real life there are Christians who are jackasses. I am the first to not claim that I am perfect as a Christian.

6419110,2,B00KD5HFJG,"This was a propaganda piece to show how amazing Christians are and how much everyone else is an evil degenerate. If you substitute Nazi for Christian and Jew for non-Christian in this movie, you have a 1930s Third Reich propaganda film.

The acting was decent, especially for a Christian movie. And the utter horridness which is the script is probably a testament to how good the actors actually are. The script was something a backwoods 12-year-old Pentecostal could have penned on a napkin. Stilted, contrived dialogue and so many leaps in logic it is at times unbearable.

The most ridiculous leap overall is the fact that while Josh (the main character) attempts to argue for deism, he fails to make a case for theism and doesn't even come close to touching on the proofs for his specific religion, Christianity. The best he does is argue for a generalized organizing intelligence but, even so, makes a terrible argument, full of straw men, bad science and cherry-picked/manipulated data, but this was a Christian film so I wasn't expecting much. And somehow his opponent, the philosophy professor, Professor Radisson, is so terrible a philosophy professor that he spends his time making appeals to authority and appeals to violence, threatening to ""end Josh's career"" - gimme a break - for ""making him look foolish"". But after Josh triumphs in a blaze of glory, getting Radisson to admit that he actually does believe in God but hates him because he gave his mom cancer, we magically jump without explanation from deism to religion-specific theism...Islam? Hinduism? Ahem...no, Christianity.

I'm sure the makers of the film will argue that with a limited amount of time they could not make an effective case for why Christianity happens to be the right religion. My answer however is 'tough.' It makes your story look ridiculous to anyone who isn't already in the tank for Christianity. Josh makes his case (using futuristic Hollywood graphics that apparently he had training and software he could run on his Macbook for) for a general deity, but without so much as a half-hearted segue we're all of a sudden talking about Jesus. The Chinese student after listening to this presentation that simply casts doubt on a non-deistic universe (Josh even says during the film that his goal is not to prove to you that there is a god but to assure you ""you don't have to commit intellectual suicide"" by believing in one) says he's going to convert to Christianity. What? Why didn't he convert to Buddhism?

So now everyone's going to see the ""Newsboys"" (Christian band) and profess their faith and then of course the Duck Dynasty guys show up talking about Jesus without so much as a peep from how we got from Big Bang to Bloody God-man on a Cross You're Going to Hell.

For, now the movie does turn to hell. Spoiler alert; avert your eyes before I ruin for you one of the greatest cinematic achievements of the 21st century; Radisson gets run over by a car. And then a preacher who's spent the bulk of the movie being thwarted by God from going to Disneyland because God keeps killing the motor on his car, shows up not to save his life (even saying, ""His ribs are cracked. He's going to die."" What? Are you a medical professional? Call this guy a g--damn ambulance!) but to save his soul. ""Is anyone here a doctor!?"" Nope. Instead, the preacher kneels down and convinces this man to regive his life to Christ so that he doesn't go to hell. How cynical. Just unbelievable choice on the part of the filmmakers. That scene really made me sick. The preacher even says in essence, ""I think God is merciful. That is why he killed you when I was around so you could confess to Jesus before you died and not go to hell."" Wow, just disgusting. If you're indoctrinated into Christianity and don't question its assumptions however, I'm sure you found this scene very moving.

Every non-Christian in this film, with the small exception of the bitchy girlfriend, is just an awful awful person. The goal of the filmmakers to denigrate those who don't share their faith while simultaneously propping themselves up as some sort of standard for decent behavior is so unbelievably transparent that if you're not already a Christian I'm sure you find this film insufferably offensive. Like I said: Substitute Nazi for Christian and Jew for non-Christian and you've got a film Hitler would get such a raging boner for it would poke out of the grave.",1408492800,,4429,4.775456919060052

Good message and it gives some foundation for the argument that God is not dead, but is involved in his creation.

It certainly prompted me to think about how I might react under the circumstance.  Stay and defend my stand?  Flee and ignore what's happening?  Claiming God is NOT dead in the environment is by far the difficult risk to take.  In the heat of the moment, Peter denied Jesus three times.  For Josh to stay true to his conviction in the moment of heat is difficult.  From a non-christian view point, proclaiming God IS dead among thousands of Christians may just as well be difficult because conformity is the path of least resistance!  At the same time not all non-believers are heartless like the lawyer character as depicted in the movie.  In all fairness, many are environmentalists, philanthropists and people lovers.  At the same token, not all Christians are angels either.  As the Bible points out, everyone has sinned.  However whoever believes in Jesus is sanctified.  Only upon death, God will determine which door you will be headed based on your belief.  Of course non-believers have nothing to worry about since there is no God anyway for them.  Know this however.  There is no middle ground.  One cannot claim Jesus is a good teacher and  deny him of being the son of God at the same time.  Since Jesus himself claimed he is son of God, you can decide either he is liar and a con-man or he is truly the son of God.  No middle ground!

6419158,1,B00KD5HFJG,"This movie could have legitimately addressed actual concerns nonbelievers have with Christianity including the historical inaccuracies, scientific inaccuracies, and conflicting verses in the bible instead, they catered to uninformed Christians and helped spread misinformation about Atheists. The film even hurts Christians because the final argument was that Atheists are all just angry at God. This movie has a decent message which is to stand up for one's beliefs, however it does this at the expense of Atheists by vilifying and falsely portraying us. The film also negatively portrays Muslims, women, and many others. This movie has a 4.8 out of 10 on IMDB and 17/100 on rotten tomatoes. It's really unrealistic (at the time of the original post), and poorly executed. A lot of enthusiastic Christians are buying this and skewing the reality. I wouldn't have liked this movie when I was a Christian however, I was lucky enough to have lots of friends with different religious views growing up. I was 30 when I became an Athiest but most of my friends growing up were Athiest or agnostic.

The movie is about a proud and bright-eyed Christian college student named Josh. He has to take a class with Professor Radisson, an angry ""Atheist"" who demands his students denounce God's existence by writing on a slip of paper that God is dead. This assignment is worth the bulk of a student's grade and Josh is the only student who refuses. The professor allows Josh to debate with him to prove God is alive to make up that assignment. SPOILERS in next paragraph

Josh 's girlfriend breaks up with him for risking a good grade by choosing to debate the professor and the professor of philosophy who btw wrongly explains the meaning behind Nietzsche's God is dead argument (just google the meaning if you're curious). Josh 's arguments for God are very poorly executed as well but this doesn't stop every last student from believing in God by the end of the film (even at religious schools this is not reality). The worst injustice is that the professor later admits he is angry at God and this is how Josh ends up passing the class.  This is an injustice because atheists by definition don't believe in God hence my ""Athiest"". You cannot be angry at something you don't believe exists. I am a former Christian and I'm now an Atheist (for 2 years).

When I was a Christian I was in a unique position, because for all of my 30 years most of my friends and every boyfriend have been atheists. This was not on purpose. I knew  from personal experience that Atheists could be compassionate and moral. I'm sure that many Christians agree but, from experience they are rare. A 2011 USA article states that atheists are distrusted as much as rapists and there are many similar studies regarding atheists in America. Why is this relevant? Kevin Sorbo who stars as Josh recently trashed Atheists in an interview along with Robbinson the shows host. If they had trashed an ethnic group or gays there would have been national outrage. The movie writers of God's Not Dead clearly don't respect nonbelievers and don't know what an atheist is. The majority of prisoners affiliate with some sort of religion, the majority of scientists don't. Not all believers are bad and not all non-believers are smart, but I think getting rid of misinformation would benefit everyone.

The Ken Ham and Bill Nye debate is the best thing I can recommend to Christians who want to seriously educate themselves and understand where Atheists are coming from. God's Not Dead uses a straw-man atheist to pander to Christians, it is hurtful and offensive. It's basically saying hey target audience you're dumb so heres some BS for you to digest. And real spoiler it's saying hey Athiests you deserve to die.

6419166,4,B00KD5HFJG,"God's Not Dead (2014) was directed by Harold Cronck for Pure Flix Entertainment and stars Kevin Sorbo, Shane Harper, Dean Cain, and Cassidy Gifford.

Josh (Harper), a college freshman and a Christian, signs up for a philosophy class only to discover the professor (Sorbo) has a personal vendetta against God. Josh is forced to defend his faith but all things eventually work together for good, including the various sub-plots.

This film challenges non-Christians and bolsters the faith of young (and even older) Christians although some of the story elements rankle a bit including a tres awkward cameo by Duck Dynasty's Willie Robertson, the unabashed plugging of Christian rock band, Newsboys, and a minister who can't find a car that will start. The atheistic antagonists, played by Sorbo and Cain, give stereotyping a bad name. If you're looking for a sophisticated apologia, look elsewhere. However, despite the movie's sometimes ham-fisted shortcomings every born again believer, young and old, will walk away proclaiming, ""Yup, that's my God!"" Many, many lives have been impacted for Jesus Christ by this small budget film and, in this society, where Evangelical Christianity and the Bible are largely not welcomed, that's no small feat.

Christians have often complained about the way they are depicted in Hollywood. And they definitely have a legitimate ground for complaint. From the crazy Christian fundamentalist mother in the 1976 classic Carrie to the psychopath Max Cady in 1991s Cape Fear to the crusading moralist Patricia Whitmore in 2012s Rock of Ages, portrayals of the Christian as oppressive, psychopathic, and/or moralistic and uptight  are so common as to be tired clichs. On the whole, Hollywood has not been kind to Christians (though its been even worse to Arabs: see the film Reel Bad Arabs).

Given that (conservative) Christians have often been caricatured, mocked, even demonized in Hollywood films, you might think theyd respond by providing thoughtful and nuanced portrayals of other minority groups within a Christian film. Instead, Gods not Dead perpetuates the problem by stereotyping other minority groups.

*Muslim Stereotype*

To begin with, there is the Muslim girl who is forced to wear the hijab by her overbearing father. And when he discovers that she has been surreptitiously listening to Franklin Graham sermons (not Lady Gaga or Kesha!) he immediately hits her and casts her out of the house.

Yeah, I know there are Muslim fathers who would do that. There are also crazy Christian fundamentalist mothers and psychopaths and anti-fun moralistic crusaders. So? Here the filmmakers have an opportunity to offer a sympathetic portrayal of Muslim family relations, and instead they blow it with a caricature.

This is all the more unfortunate given that Christians and Muslims have many shared concerns and challenges. At one point the Muslim father tells his daughter why she needs to wear the hijab in public. I didn't find the scene played out with a great deal of sympathy for the father. And yet, a Christian father might have the same conversation with his daughter over why she cant go out wearing a shirt that exposes her midriff. Why not use these characters to create some degree of sympathy and understanding for minorities that are oft misunderstood and marginalized?

*Animal Rights Activist Stereotype*

The next stereotype is a young woman reporter who is also a secular animal rights activist. Shes angry at the world and fiercely judgmental of those around her who kill animals and eat meat. This certainly comes through in her interview with the smiling and friendly Duck Dynasty guy (sorry, I don't know his name and I don't care) who makes a cameo appearance in the film. Here we have the stark juxtaposition of the well adjusted Christian hunter and meat lover over-against the angry and judgmental animal rights activist. Of course, there is no attempt to explore her views or to understand the motivating compassion for other sentient creatures and ecologically sustainable living that drives people to eschew meat eating.

*Communist Chinese Stereotype*

One Chinese student keeps calling his father back in China telling him of the evidence for Gods existence he is hearing in the classroom. The father hisses into the phone that he must stop talking like that or he will jeopardize his younger brothers future. To be sure, China has a poor human rights record when it comes to religion, and I have no intent of downplaying that fact. But the film does nothing more than invoke a cardboard character as a minor plot-point.

*Blonde superficial girlfriend stereotype*

The films protagonist is a young Christian student (more on him in a moment). While he senses Gods call to take on the atheistic philosophy professor in the classroom (more on that also in a moment), his blonde superficial girlfriend attempts to deter him. When this blonde girlfriend appeared on campus to deter him from his mission, my daughter wisely observed (albeit with a touch of hyperbole), Every movie has an evil girlfriend who asks for a lot. Okay, not every movie. But common Christian tropes include the party crowd and the lukewarm Christian who will attempt to deter you from your calling (Rev. 3:15). Blonde girlfriend illustrates the latter.

*Atheist Stereotype*

The Muslim, animal rights activist / reporter, communist, and blonde superficial girlfriend stereotypes are merely bit players on the periphery of the film. The beating heart is a confrontation between an evil atheistic philosophy professor  one who embodies the worst fears of the typical Christian conservative  and a young Christian freshman.

The fact is that there are philosophy professors out there who are hostile to Christianity. For example, back in the mid 1990s I remember one philosophy professor at Simon Fraser University who had a reputation among Christian students for exhibiting hostility toward Christianity and condescension toward Christian students. (I never attended SFU, so I cant confirm the reliability of the reports. But reputations typically are earned with some degree of evidence.)

But God is not Dead takes this theme and draws it in cartoonish proportions. In the film the professor insists in the very first class that all students write God is dead, Nietzsches famous declaration, on a sheet of paper. The one student, our young freshman hero, refuses to do so. And so the professor challenges him to defend Gods existence in front of the class over the next three classes. At one point the prof encounters the student in the hallway and snarls that in the classroom There is a god, and Im him.

And so the freshman is led into the proverbial arena to face the frothing lion of a professor. And over the next three sessions he lays out a case for Gods existence drawing on big bang cosmology while deflating the problem of evil with a simple appeal to free will. His presentation includes animation and graphics of a level of sophistication to impress any TED talk audience. Because of course a freshman has all the time and technological know-how to put together top-grade presentations even as he researches and writes lectures that can humiliate his professor.

At one point the freshman seeks encouragement from his pastor. He estimates that there are about 80 students in the class. When his pastor asks how many he thinks go to church he opines that hes the only one. Really? According to the Pew Forum, 78% of Americans are Christian. But in this classroom it is just over 1%? Yeah, makes perfect sense.

The pastor then gives the student some advice in the form of a couple scriptural references about Jesus being ashamed of us if were ashamed of him. In other words, proof-texting and driving Christian action with guilt and fear. Yeah, I remember that growing up.

The hero neednt have worried. He maintains his courage and carries out his mission. At the end of his lectures, his fellow students all stand, one after another, to declare him the winner over the atheist professor. Every one of those 80 students now believes God exists. (For some reason as they stood I kept expecting them to say O captain, my captain.) Obviously the evidence for God is just that overwhelming.

A closer look reveals that the freshmans presentations are perfectly awful as he attempts to justify the Bible with a nave, cherry-picking concordism. For example, the Big Bang is anticipated in Genesis 1:3. Right  And wheres the creation of the firmament and the ocean above (Gen. 1:7) supposed to fit into this schema? As for free will, sure that may provide a part of a response to the problem of evil. But anybody familiar with the vast literature on this topic knows it to be at best a very partial response.

*God is dead. -Nietzsche- Nietzsche is Dead. -God-*

The conclusion to the film is what really angered me. Everybody in town converges on a Newsboys concert. And while there, the lead singer, Michael Tait and his friend  the Ducky Dynasty guy  tell the audience to text out Gods not dead to all their phone contacts in honor of the young freshman who humiliated the atheist philosophy professor. (Apparently word has gotten around.)

At the same time that all these texts are being sent out, the atheist professor is hit by a car. Two Christians are immediately on the scene (including the pastor mentioned above). They immediately conclude that he will shortly die and they tell him this. Note that they don't try to encourage him by saying, Buddy, just hold on! Youre going to make it! No, they tell him hes about to die. For goodness sake, what kind of first responders are these?!!!!

Of course, he does die because the plot requires the blood of the apostate. But not before he has a deathbed conversion. Just after his death his phone buzzes with a text from one of his concert-going contacts: Gods not dead.

Right! Gods not dead. But the one-time atheist professor now is. Get it?! Oh the irony.

The entire scenario is a clear riff off the familiar pun that heads this section. Nietzsche declared that God is dead. But now it is the professor who is dead along with Nietzsche. Even as thousands of Christians party it up at the Newboys concert.

Poor taste doesnt begin to describe this.

But reprehensible does.

This is the sort of incompetent drivel that succeeds only because there are enough conservative Christians with a persecution complex to make it successful - the acting is terrible, the dialogue is stilted, and the plot has absolutely NO basis in reality.

6419200,2,B00KD5HFJG,"Kevin Sorbo's movie appeals to the Christian mind and to evangelists who advocate for literal interpretation of the scriptures with their underlying racist ideologies. It is ironic that the movie picked a big burly Iranian man with a dark complexion and a big crooked Jewish nose to stereotype the Middle-Eastern man as evil looking, and portrayed him as a maniac and a fanatic Muslim who wholly believes in one god but not in Jesus. However, his beautiful fair skinned daughter switched her faith to Christianity to cope with her evil Muslim father, just as the Chinese atheist student did once his colleague another freshman who took on his avidly atheist professor and defeated him with his holy-spirited argument as he proved to everyone in the classroom the existence of God. Therefore, we were all convinced and our faith was restored.
 In addition, the movie used an African Christian minister whose faith was able to restart a dead car battery to show the kindness of the Lord, and that Jesus loves everyone regardless of their skin color or ethnicity despite the killing of millions of Africans by Christians. Christianity begins by treating others the way we want to be treated, and action speaks louder than words. Therefore, we need to take a good look at our daily actions in the world which has never been consistent with our preaching of our alleged faith. Millions have died in the name of religion whether it is Jesus, Muhammad, or Buddha, and we must first acknowledge this fact and own it in order to change it.
If deeply analyzed, this movie can be confusing on one hand because it sends many double messages, but on the other hand,  it's brilliant Christian propaganda that will help recruit may lost souls seeking temporary solace and comfort in the Christian church.",1407888000,3,1789,4.881578947368421

In many ways, the movie is a success, as its goal was to play to the fears of a certain kind of Christian whose thinking is dominated by a sense of forces that endanger his or her religious beliefs.  All the characters are broad stereotypes that help to feed those fears.  A particular problem is the philosophy professor -- any university professor who taught his class in this manner would face professional sanctions, including the strong possibility of dismissal.  It was also difficult to know what to make of the Muslim family except to think they were included to demonize non-Christians (and it was even more offensive that the daughter was listening to a Franklin Graham sermon on her iPod).  It's just sad that many people will take this movie seriously.  Most of them are decent people, and I can only hope they can find a way out of the hokum this movie offers.",1407715200,8,958,4.605882352941176
6419232,5,B00KD5HFJG,"This film is worth watching for the diaologue that takes place within the classroom as a student gives an intelligent defence for the existance of a creator and answers many of the biased and illogical arguments made by atheists.  Atheism, it must be remembered, is a religion itself, a position of faith taken because it fits a worldview and belief system that frees a person from moral absolutes. The result of a society living largely without belief in God and creating its own morality can be seen on the nightly news, and witnessed in our nation's families, schools, and communities.",1407715200,,588,4.88

However, this movie is not exactly targeted toward non-believers; its toward believers and gives them the heads up that there are people that will test their faith in Jesus.

6419236,5,B00KD5HFJG,This is the best movie I've seen in quite some time; it all came together with this one: the writing was great and the acting was excellent. Along with impeccable production values this film actually brought a tear to my eye (a couple of times.) Stereotype's were kept to a minimum (It's hard to do when dealing with religious issues.) I'm particularly impressed with  the fact that not everyone was saved. God's Not Dead is entertainment  you can share with your entire family.  ENJOY!,1407715200,4,486,4.761904761904762

6419243,3,B00KD5HFJG,"I grew up in church but have since become extremely disappointed with the direction the church is going, particularly when it comes to their intolerance of anything that is not their beliefs. I went into this movie knowing that it would be a Sunday school lesson with a clear target audience of today's church-going crowd. I expected scenes of eye-rolling cheese, terrible acting and a terrible plot. As it turns out, it wasn't nearly that bad. Here is my list of strengths and weaknesses:

STRENGTHS:
- Cross-over message that emphasizes Choice. Although the movie's clear message is that you should ""choose"" God, it also has another message that is simply ""Think for yourself.""  Many students will find themselves in science classrooms which ONLY teach Intelligent Design and completely ignores Evolution. This movie encourages you to think for yourself, regardless of the message, despite what your parents or teachers shove down your throat.

- Moderately good acting

- Not boring

- A 'Crash'-esque storyline that comes together fairly well in the end

WEAKNESSES:
- Duck Dynasty guest star?? Really?

- The character of Josh's girlfriend is ridiculous. Nothing she says makes sense.

- Too political (the obnoxious reporter girl is from a 'left' magazine, of course)

- Lays it on too thick with the 'bad' characters. Any character who doesn't love Jesus is portrayed waaaay too villainously. It starts to get laughable.

- Very little classroom drama. The debate scenes are slim and few.

OVERALL: I think even die-hard Christians will be able to spot the flaws in this movie, but it won't ruin their experience. If you're the target audience of this movie (you know who you are) you will love it. I guarantee it, 100%. If you're not quite the target audience, you might still enjoy yourself because it does have a small amount of cross-over message that is not strictly Sunday school. For those who already hate it because it's a surprise religious hit, you probably won't like it, so don't waste your time. In any case, on a strictly art-based merit, I found the plot to be coherent enough (certainly better than many blockbusters) and the acting far from cringe-worthy, so that alone makes this low-budget movie much better than my original expectations.",1407628800,,2265,4.997340425531915

6419248,5,B00KD5HFJG,"I bought this DVD out of duty. I thought as a Christian I should support Christian movies and seeing TONS Of them at Walmart thought how sad it was gonna be and what a witness it would say if this movie bombed.. That was what went through my mind at 10pm when I was shopping and threw it in my cart...
OMGOODNESS was I glad I did! I put it on that night when I was going to bed to see what it was like...  and that is when I realized what a jewel I had purchased! I cried, I laughed, I RELATED! This was semi predictable but only because I LIVED this stuff! LIVED IT. I related to most of it and it was spot on but not corny acting! At 1 am when I finished and was up on my knees worshiping and singing out praises to the Newsboys concert at the end - I couldn't help but go into my 11 year old daughters room since her light was on and tell her all about this awesome movie. Which of course she would enjoy because one of her childhood TV stars - the boyfriend from Good Luck Charlie on the Disney Channel was the the lead part! I gave her the DVD and encouraged her to watch it in the morning.
Which she did. I listened at the door. (Cuz kids will be real behind closed doors but you know... mom... embarrassing) anyways... I went to work and Got a text from her about how moved she was from the movie. She said - I haven't cried over a movie ... ever? And this was amazing! While working that night she took it to her Grandparents and shared it with them!
I lent it to my co-worker and mom and dad have plans of who they want to see this movie. It just is THAT AWESOME!

If you are wondering - should you? the answer is shout it from the rooftop YES! Buy this DVD. Watch it, lend it, gift it. It is not corny. It is awesome. It is great. It is what you want in a movie. BRAVO.",1407628800,4,1779,3.8980716253443526
6419249,1,B00KD5HFJG,"""God's (sic.) Not Dead"" is a poorly constructed film.  The script is predictable and the acting is second rate at best.  It is clearly made for a Christian only audience with right wing political ideas.  It is not about love and tolerance, but rather, division and bitterness.  If you belong to any other organized religion or have secular beliefs then you will find no intellectual challenges in this movie's insipid ideas.  In America, it is laughable that the Christian right would portray themselves as ""victims"" since they have gripped most of the power cards in U.S. politics since the country was conceived.  Also, the title is not grammatically correct.  The title should be ""God Is Not Dead"".  For example, a person can write: ""JFK is dead"", but not ""JFK's dead"".  You cannot say ""It's a contraction"".  The rule of ""It's and Its"" is a unique case and cannot be applied with this title.  If a person writes the sentence: ""Christians love to follow God's plan.""  According to the logic of the movie title, this means: ""Christians love to follow God is plan.""  I can provide other examples if the above  is not clear.  I'm a journalist and I consulted with an English Professor at the University of Toronto, and he responded, ""The title of this movie is grammatically incorrect.""",1407628800,18,1285,4.80365296803653
6419250,5,B00KD5HFJG,"The movie is beautiful and thought provoking. It brings up powerful issues and gives both sides. This won't convert anyone, one way or the other. As this demonstrated no one can prove or disprove the Existence of God or Higher Powers.

This shows a lot about Atheists. True Atheists consider any Deity, or any Higher Power, to be Mythical/Superstition. They believe in the Physical world, and are governed by Science, Psychology, Reason and Philosophy.

Also how there are false Atheists. One's who use the title as a means of being Anti-Theists. These ones claim to not believe in God, but in truth they Hate God.

This shows the similarities between the ""Big Bang Theory"" and Genesis. The Big Bang could easily be the physical result of a Deity saying ""Let There Be Light"". Also the real difference between theory of Evolution and Genesis is the time Frame.

Darwin believed Evolution to be random, and many Scientist believe the Big Bang was random. Still not all Scientist believe that, many scientists believe in Higher Powers and God.

Next this shows the difference between Doctrine and Faith, and the various meanings of the word God.

When a lot of people say God, they mean Religious Doctrine. Turning God into Dictator, that seeks to control everyone and prevents Free Will. So many people are terrified of anything outside their Doctrine. They hide behind Doctrine using it as an excuse for their actions and for the pain they cause others. Often placing Doctrine above Lovers/Spouses and above their own Offspring and Siblings. This gives painful examples of each.

When Josh first spoke of God he meant a ""Supreme Being"", the ""Creator of the Universe"" Later on he spoke of God as the Embodiment/Personification of his Morality. In his final meaning, God and Faith were used in the same context - were one and the same.

This movie shows how being in the Presence of someone with True Faith can be a Life Changing Event. How Faith affects everything and everyone. Faith is a Gift, freely given to those who are open to it. Faith Heals, Forgives,and Guides. Faith is the source of Joy, Love, Strength, and Hope.

Finally this has a simple and inspiring message. That there are still Miracles in the world, and that ""Faith is Not Dead""",1407628800,,2246,4.812987012987013

6419252,5,B00KD5HFJG,"I loved it! Unfortunately Christian movies many times have a lot of boring parts, not well acted, and are preachy, so I was wary. God's not Dead was exactly the opposite. This movie was interesting from the start, was well acted, and well filmed.  We laughed at parts, and cried at parts,  it had a great message and was not preachy at all.  It also gave twists and turns I didn't expect.  I would recommend this movie to all.  Make more movies like this one!!",1407628800,,460,4.364705882352941

6419254,5,B00KD5HFJG,"One of the best Christian movies I've seen in a long time. It wasn't perfect, but way better than most Christian movies. The message is there without being too preachy (some will disagree, as even mentioning Christ is considered preachy to them -- SPOILER ALERT: The name of Jesus is actually used in this film). It nails the college philosophy brainwashing right on its head. My college professor was just like this, and I just kept quiet.  All he did was bring up 300-year-old arguments supporting Christianity and ""debunk"" them. He never presented any strong Christian arguments and packaged weak ones like they were the best arguments Christianity had. I imagine this still goes on. If I had seen this film back then, I might have done differently. I hope this film inspires students to fight back. I pray many college students would watch this film. The point was clear. Just let them think for themselves and weigh the real evidence.",1407628800,4,939,4.832298136645963

6419261,5,B00KD5HFJG,"Ok... so what can I say that no one else said? Well, probably not much; however, me being me, I just have to say this is Kevin Sorbo at his BEST! He gives such a profound and convincing performance of the self-professed atheist professor. New comer Shane Harper (also known from his role on Disney's ""Good Luck, Charlie!) also provided a powerful performance. The storyline in this movie is solid and flows very well. There are those who will criticize and deem it ""propaganda"";  however, truth be told it is all in the perspective of the beholder. You will take away from this movie what you want. If you are one who considers Jesus to be your best friend then this movie will be an affirmation or a rededication of all you live for and might even make you question whether you yourself would stand up for what you believe in just as character Josh Wheaton did. But... if you are one who declares yourself to be an atheist, agnostic, etc then you may walk away from this movie angry. After all... an atheist's entire belief system (or lack of) is brought into question. And as a living breathing God created human being, we all have pride and when our belief system (one way or another) is brought into question it tends to bring out our defensive side Nonetheless, the movie in and of itself is extraordinarily powerful. The purpose of it is not only to entertain but to raise the awareness of a growing epidemic facing Christian students on liberal campuses across the country. Many will face these challenges but only a few will stand up for what they believe in. (Not just on campuses but in life as a whole whether at home, at work, or in social settings.) What will you do? Who will you choose?

6419267,4,B00KD5HFJG,"I liked the movie. It is not a movie for the faint of heart, however, because it will challenge what you believe. I think they could have done a better job at fleshing out the arguments since the movie description focuses on this as the main theme but it is only a fraction of what is going on overall. I think the bigger theme is why does God allow suffering and this is illustrated by several characters who are all facing their own trials in life. I think another big theme is God is enduring while this world is fleeting and as the characters go through their trials, some come to see this while others do not. I thought the character development was rich and varied and they were all people you loved to love, loved to hate, found amusing and/or could empathize with. Compassion, or lack thereof, was also a big theme in the personal relationships. I came away thinking about people in my life who are in spiritual trouble and it has compelled me to think about what I can do for them.

6419308,5,B00KD5HFJG,"""God's Not Dead"" is pretty good. This is how the story goes: College freshman and devout Christian Josh Wheaton has his faith challenged on his first day of philosophy class by the dogmatic Professor Radisson. Radisson begins class by informing students that they will need to disavow, in writing, the existence of God on that first day or face a failing grade. As other students in the class begin scribbling the words ""God Is Dead"" on pieces of paper, Josh find himself at a crossroads, having to choose between his faith and his future. Josh offers a nervous refusal, provoking an irate reaction from his smug professor. Radisson assigns him a daunting task: to prove God's existence by presenting well-researched, intellectual arguments and evidence over the course of the semester, and engage Radisson in a head-to-head debate in front of the class. If Josh fails to convince his classmates of God's existence, he will fail the course, hindering his academic goals. With almost no one in his corner, Josh wonders if he can really fight for what he believes. Can he actually prove the existence of God? Wouldn't it just be easier just to write ""God Is Dead"" and put the whole incident behind him?

The cast led by Kevin Sorbo (as Professor Radisson) & Shane Harper (as Josh Wheaton) is pretty good. The directing by Harold Cronk is pretty good. The story by Hunter Dennis, Chuck Konzelman & Cary Solomon & the screenplay by Knozelman & Solomon (both of them also co-produced the film) is pretty good.

The music by Will Musser is pretty good. The cinematography by Brian Shanley is pretty good. The film editing by Vance Null is pretty good. The casting by Billy DaMota & Dea Vise is pretty good. The production design by Claire Sanchez is pretty good. The art direction by Perry James Trentacosta is pretty good. The set decoration by Emily Meroney is pretty good. The costume design by John H. Smith is pretty good. The special effects coordinated by Ken Speed is pretty good. The stunts coordinated by Jay Amor are pretty good.

This is a pretty good movie that is entertaining and decently well-made. This was one of the most surprising hits of the spring season and of the year, as well. This is a movie that everyone can see, whether or not, you are religious or not. This is a pretty good movie that is a pretty good time-filler for anyone looking for a pretty good movie to watch.",1407369600,4,2392,4.7040572792362765

Because God does not force himself on anyone. It is your choice to believe in him. Only evil exist to turn you away from him and not give his way a chance to enjoy life and even when at darkest hours in your life. He is there always.

They end up rejecting the only One who could bring the healing they need.  Instead their pain perpetuates because hurting people hurt people.

The big bang may have started on the quantum level and literally came from nothing Again for the billionth time.....
There wasn't just one big bang.
There were billions of them
Our universe is the result of one of them that worked.
The universe contains billions of proto stars,
The ones that work out become stars
the universe has billions of stars.
The ones that form a certain way have planets
There are billions of planets orbiting billions of stars.
the ones that form a certain way at the right distance from their star become earth-like planets
There are billions of  earth-like planets the ones that have the right elements have life evolve on them.
There are billions of life sustaining planets the ones with the right balance of conditions evolve intelligent life that wonders about stuff like this.
If all the conditions fail to come together at any point along the way :
Bang too big or not big enough
proto stars too dispersed
Planets too big small hot cold far away from or too close to sun
The right primordial slop never forms or contains a fatal flaw or forms in the wrong place or gets zapped by lava or....
The environment is too lush to challenge the life forms to evolve or too sparse to sustain life for long enough. Or one of many inevitable mass extinctions went all the way and wiped  everything out.
then those places cease to exist or fall by the way side

IMVHO you can call that ongoing multilevel eternal process God. read up on super string/gravity M-theory for a more detailed explanation.

6419324,1,B00KD5HFJG,"No professor is ever going to make students say ""God is dead."" First of all, atheists don't believe God has ever existed, so how could they call for people to declare that he is dead? Second, they don't believe in any gods, let alone the one Protestant Christian Americans tend to be obsessed with. To an atheist, being obsessed with a fantastic creature or creatures is a character flaw which might lead you to do irrational never existed, any more than Christians believe Rama is alive or Osiris is alive or dead. Except for a few militants, atheists just want to be left alone, to not be told they are sinners, to not be told they are going to a place of punishment they don't believe in, to not have it assumed that their ethics are any less important to them or as valuable to leading them to do the right and honorable things as a Christian's sense of morality.  I happen to be a (non-Christian) agnostic believer in a higher power, and I find the Protestant Christian obsession with making everybody think the same way to be annoying, offensive, insufferable, and oppressive, too. Movies like this are only good if you honestly see the individual beliefs of dismissive atheists to be disturbing because you are more afraid of being perceived as a fool by people you see as sensible and happy than you are truly in love with and content in your belief in your version of God.  Since my beliefs aren't swayed by those who think differently from myself, I could care less whether 'God' is alive or not to anybody, and I suggest that others either bolster their own faith with reason, or stop following foolish thought systems without blaming others for filling them with doubt.",1407283200,22,1681,4.618729096989966

6419326,5,B00KD5HFJG,"I rented this before I put it in my purchase queue.  I knew the premise of the movie, which was why I was interested.  It's so much more then I thought it would be.  It's hard hitting, raw, shows a totally different area of a Christian life...persecution, non-acceptance, standing up to what you know is wrong...and being true to God and not backing down.  I agree that it should have had MORE time in the classroom, which was the area of the film that was pushed in the trailers. The editing should have been done better as well. There were areas that the drama was high and they flip to something else. Bad timing, so much so I thought the DVD skipped and I lost some of the film.  SO...editing could have been better. That being said, it all ties together and shows the meaning behind all the characters, their ultimate links...etc....

The acting was great. The cast as well. The script and arguments in the class were clear, concise and unbreakable.  I loved it.  There were some slow parts that could've been a bit more...well, a bit less slow. The areas with the pastor and the used car mostly. I was glad when those areas were over.

The student, Wheaton's, girlfriend, what an utter B****!  I mean, she was supposed to be a Christian and she was just a horrible person.  Pushy, demanding, bossy, unforgiving and just a person I couldn't imagine someone ever wanting to be with. UGH!

The emotion of the film was infectious.  The film ran the gamut of making you chuckle to making you out-and-out angry, to weeping, to jaw dropping hate and inhumanity of one of the characters...you'll know if you've seen it...and if and when you see it.

The movie tackles the truth about how things can be and really are for Christians in many areas of the world...even here in the US, and there's more and more persecution here. It's a more in-your-face raw film. Much more so then I expected.

Fantastic movie.  5 stars all the way.",1407283200,7,1928,4.528901734104046

I was convicted while watching the movie that there are two types of people in the world: those with hope and those without. When the main characters faced a struggle or battle, they had the free will to choose hope or hopelessness. Nobody made their decision for them; it was done with free will, and a life-changing event, in either direction. Sometimes they were persecuted for their hope, either by family members, media or the educational system. ""Hope"" means  to desire with expectation of obtainment or to expect with confidence (Webster-Merriam). In contrast, ""hopeless"" is defined as having or feeling no hope; unable to be changed  (Webster-Merriam). The movie God's Not Dead clearly identifies these two conditions and the cross Christians bear for choosing Hope.",1407283200,3,904,5.060402684563758

4) Someone cannot be a moral person without the christian god.

6419345,5,B00KD5HFJG,"Imagine if your college professor asked you to sign a paper stating that God is Dead. What would you do? Would you comply? Drop the class? Or take a stand? Matthew 10:33 states But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven. After that powerful verse what would you do? Would you still take a stand for God if your grades and relationship with your significant other were at stake? That's what Josh did in the movie God's Not Dead.

While the story told is not factual, it is based off of many recent lawsuits involving public universities and Christian students. Numerous popular Christians make an appearance including The Newsboys, Willie and Korie Robertson, and Kevin Sorbo who plays the protagonist professor.

There are a wide variety of characters including a vegan who is diagnosed with cancer and her successful yet unsupportive boyfriend. Several students from different backgrounds are portrayed including a rebellious female Muslim student who only wears her face covering around her father and sneaks it off at school. There's also a Chinese student in Josh's class who is intrigued by the possibility of God's existence, but when he talks to his father about it, he cuts him off every time.

Josh's presentations of the existence of God are well thought out and very informative. It's good to know that being Christian is not committing intellectual suicide! Granted, most college professors are not like professor Radisson, however there may be times where we'll have to take a stand for God. Do we have the faith and the strength to do it?

The Pro-Goddies give it 5 stars and the No-Goddies call the movie tripe.  There's no middle ground here and your side is definitely right while the other side is more wrong than wrong can be!!  So, here's an attempt at a middle ground view of this topic.  God's not dead, if you believe it.  God's dead, if you believe it.  Just leave it at that.  Unfortunately, people don't just leave it at that and so we have the problems, the fear, the anger, the violence that are all driven by people's own insecurities about what they believe.  If you truly believe God's not dead, you shouldn't need to attack the beliefs of people who believe that God is dead, and vice versa.  If any belief that opposes your beliefs makes you feel fear and anger, you need to rethink what you believe because a firm, true belief doesn't mind opposing viewpoints.  Truth requires the consideration of all possible views and ideas.  If your beliefs require you to close your mind to all other viewpoints and attack those other views as false, you are probably wrong in what you believe.  When discussing the issue of God's existence, tv and movies rarely, perhaps never, present the view that God is dead while they frequently present the view that God is not dead.  How many movies or tv shows do you know that suggest that God is not dead?  This movie, The Rapture, The Passion of the Christ, Oh God!, Ten Commandments, Noah, etc. are some movies and examples of how tv and movies are biased toward the view that God is not dead.  How many movies or tv shows do you know that present atheist viewpoints or present more complex views of God's existence rather than just accepting his existence?  (Please let me know of any titles!)  I don't think any atheists are going to protest outside movie theatres or threaten the filmmakers of this movie for claiming that God is not dead but what would happen to a movie that said God is dead?  That's why atheist movies don't get made.  Whatever you believe, don't let your beliefs lead you to fear, anger, hatred, and violence.

(While there are many movies for God believers, there aren't many for nonbelievers or those who have open minds on the issue.  These are the only titles I know with a different view of God and religion:

The God Complex (very funny low budget independent movie by Mark Pirro, it might be the only atheist movie available to be seen), The Milky Way (Bunuel's complex view of religious faith is actually a movie for both believers and nonbelievers), Life of Brian (not exactly religious but it has a good sense of humor on the topic).",1406764800,3,2700,4.616352201257862
6419351,5,B00KD5HFJG,"In a time when Christians are the new pariahs, atheism is the flavor of the decade and, of course, Muslims are the new superstars, it is refreshing to see a movie with this subject matter come out and do well at the box office. It is truly sad that there are so many Godless, sorry, sad, angry creatures out there who just can't stand it when  Christians step forward to share their story or celebrate their faith. These Godless fools throw their little hissy fits and scream that being Christian is unacceptable and that Christianity should not be tolerated. They insist that it always has be their way or the highway. They demand tolerance but are they tolerant? No. Are they self centered-hypocrites? Yes. Are they sickening and intrusive? Undoubtedly. In their view, God doesn't exist and because they don't believe, anyone who does is either sick, stupid or dim.

It's no accident that most of the fools running around blathering their B.S. about how we should all live our lives according to THEM, be tolerant and accept THEM or risk being branded a racist, bigot or worse, also happen to be Godless. This is a good movie. My family and I enjoyed it enough in the theater to buy the DVD. And I don't buy many movies. If you believe, see it. If you have doubts, see it. If you are so narrow-minded that there is no way you can open your heart and mind, and if you are predisposed to hate this movie and everything it stands for, don't see it. Spend your money on the latest Seth Rogan tripe. Whatever it is, it will be right up your alley. Live and let live, hypocrites. You don't have to believe in anything if that's what you choose. But let others make their choices.",1406678400,6,1675,4.488524590163935
6419352,1,B00KD5HFJG,"There was nothing at all impressive about this film. Surrounded by an annoying bouncy Christian music soundtrack and actors who should just kiss the spotlight goodbye once and for all, this film delves into that sinister and preachy ongoing ""I'm right and you're wrong"" attitude about the existence of God and that people who follow this invisible ""God"" are right and you, being an Atheist, are nothing but wrong. Headed by David White and Dean Cain, along with a few other ""has beens"", this film is not at all what you would expect. In fact it was extremely boring and full of dialogue with no action sequences or anything that would keep a ""worldy"" person's interest. The film is far preachy. Surrounded by the ever-so-popular debates that Christians make in order to justify their own fairy tale beliefs. A belief, mind you, where God hates gays yet can go on a few chapters later to promote incest between Lot and his very own daughters, after they got him drunk at that! Christianity is the biggest trap known to mankind, and the lead cause of all world wars that this country has ever known, and I hate to say it but people simply need to wake up and start accepting all for their differences. Regardless of who they are! It's none of your business how one chooses to live their life, or who they choose to love at that. Christianity is filled with one sided lingo, expecting a person to change in order to be loved by this all loving, unconditional ""God"" that even the very ""Christians"" can't get right. In short, these people need to stop making films, because now it's just funny at the fact that they can't even find any other actors to fill these roles, yet use repeat actors from past productions and now it's just hilariously spinning out of control. I can understand that the producers of this film would be ticked off at me for writing such a review, but as a life-long fan of movies, this one is by far a mere insult to the very video shelf. Anyone that claims to ""show their neighbor unconditional love"" yet expects them to change the way they are and see things THEIR WAY, then watch out. You are surrounding yourself with nothing but hypocrisy and heresy. I am a gay man. Have been gay my entire life, and if your man made, self-edifying, justificational ""God"" wants to burn me in hell for all eternity, then that of course would defeat the purpose of love in the first place. I'm better off believing in nothing rather than believing in something and going against the very words in which ""He"" (how sexist!) sets forth before you. The world will forever be here, and will forever have all different kinds living in it. This includes ""Christians"" and ""Atheists"" alike. And P.S. The Big Bang Theory makes a LOT MORE SENSE than this invisible dude in the sky just taking a week out to create everything and then pulling a rib out of his sudden creation to create the existence of human life. The writers of this movie obviously failed to check out the documentary ""The History of the World in 2 Hours"". The only thing that makes sense. Invisible people in the sky creating people and then burning them all in hell for kicks if they don't do what men wrote down on paper 1000s of years ago (cough) .. forget it! So yeah, good luck with that. The world is 3.6 billion years old anyways, so really, this movie should have done more research into the world and its origins before spouting off an attempt to prove that the ""Christian God"" exists, when ""He"" is only 2000 years old. Just a horrible movie, and the only positive reviews I see here are simply of those who have been suckered into this belief because they had no where else to turn but to the sky when the heat got too hot for them in their lives. Christianity is just over! Learn how to love and accept others for who they are rather than continuing to support such agenda while these filmmakers get rich off of their ""God"" and continue to make ""His"" house a marketplace!

I think that is exactly what the movie was going for and I believe they accomplished this goal. If someone was on the fence about Christianity this movie may very well win them over. The arguments that are presented are fairly simple and this won't prepare anyone for too much debate but it is a step in the right direction. I recommend this movie to everyone!,1406592000,4,574,4.58252427184466

You prepare yourself to get an education at a reputable university and butt heads your first day in class with your Philosophy Professor.

His problem?  He's a successful, highly regarded philosophy scholar who knows God does not exist.  And he can prove it.

Anyone who disagrees can dispute this fact, but they will have a designated time frame to do so, and he will refute their arguments.

He will fail anyone who accepts the challenge, because he is the Professor and he is right.  Taking the challenge will waste time.  Don't be foolish.

Wonderful movie, the stuff that Christian testimonies are made of.  Read William Shakespeare's Last Will and Testament.

6419361,1,B00KD5HFJG,"I took a few hours to watch the new Christian movie Gods Not Dead staring a number of C-list actors. It is a typical Christian movie in that it appears to have been written by the mutual masturbation society.

The plot was predictable, the characters shallow cookie cutter stereotypes, and the only real question was trying to figure out how the cast of characters related to each other.

Kevin Sorbo of past Hercules fame plays a rabid atheist professor Radisson with serious moral issues. He stalks a student, and clearly a fan of academic misconduct. His wife in the movie is a Christian who he dated while she was in his class. He calls her a work in progress, as it relates to her religion. Radisson is portrayed as a well educated atheist, but surprisingly he appears as a noob when dealing with even the most basic apologetic arguments.

The hero Josh is played by Shane Harper. When he refuses to sign a paper that states God is dead, a statement made by Frederick Nietzsche, he is forced to defend his position against Radisson in a debate with the class being the final judge.

The movie misrepresents what Nietzsche meant with the claim that God is dead, by claiming that he was referring to a creator god never have existed. This is not what Nietzsche meant by any stretch of the imagination.

But this is not the worst of the movie. This movie gave the writers the perfect chance to present their best arguments and evidence that the Christian god exists. Instead we get the same tired and previously refuted arguments and no evidence at all.

The movie will not likely be embraced by young earth creationists as it does promote current cosmological ideas to a degree such as an old universe as well as some of evolution.

The non-Christian characters are most presented as tormented, shallow, self-serving, and pathetic. A Muslim father is oppressive, physically abusive, and cruel. The Christian characters are of course presented as being selfless, caring, and having all the answers.

As the movie progresses, Josh makes the predictable and tired accusation at Radisson that something must have happened to him to make him hate god so much. Of course, it turns out that he is angry at god because his mother died when he was young and begged god to save her. It has nothing to do with the lack of evidence, Radisson is just being that stubborn and angry atheist, right? Clearly this is absolutely bogus as atheists are not angry at god any more than they are angry at Darth Vader.

In the end, Radissons wife leaves him, Radisson gets hit by a car that runs a red light in an instant rain storm, abandons all of his integrity and has a roadside conversion by a pastor who is there by chance, and dies. He gets to go to heaven now, hooray!

If god actually existed he would want to be dead for having such a pathetic excuse for a movie to be making a case for his existence, which was no case at all. If you are looking for a good debate, you will have better luck listening to philosophers battle it out on YouTube. This movie is vapid and vacuous Christian propaganda tripe written by someone who has never spoken to an atheist and has an agenda to misrepresent atheists as much as possible.",1406160000,38,3209,4.5846422338568935
6419362,5,B00KD5HFJG,"I don't normally write reviews, but this has too many 1 stars simply due to the nature of what it is.  I figured I'd do what I can to balance that out.  It is a great movie too, so there is that",1405987200,2,194,3.5952380952380953
6419363,5,B00KD5HFJG,"This was a good film.  It could have been longer to flesh out the weaker plot points and to create stronger arguments.  What I think many fail to grasp about this movies is that it was not intended to be a straight ""debate,"" (although I would have loved it if it was). Instead it was to show different people, from different walks, all struggling with their choice to follow Christ and a hostile, unforgiving, belittling, and sarcastic world that blasts them for living and being supposedly ""superstitious.""  Currently atheists hold the ""narrative"" with Christians in the ""counter narrative"" but ultimately any argument that has to rely on fallacious arguments, belittling, and the weak argument that ""logic"" is on their side is sadly foolish.  That is atheism today.  I will end this with: read the arguments for yourself--do NOT rely on the media, social institutions, schools, or even self-professed experts crossing into other fields (like Stephen Hawkings who thinks Physics gives him the right to step into theology) that they have no authority to go into.  You would not trust your car mechanic to give you advice on your computer or iPod, so why would you let people bully you with their supposed ""credentials"" just cause they can drone on and on with a barrage of rhetoric that is only designed to make themselves look or sound important and ultimately rob you of your identity?  Read the evidence for yourself and ultimately do NOT let these kinds of people dissuade you from your faith just cause they can out-argue you.  Know who you are in Christ but also know how to defend yourself and have a ready defense for why you believe what you do.  Peace to you all.",1405900800,6,1673,4.78125

The professor does not believe in God and he ask his class for anyone to prove there is a God. He repeated the question 2 more times. Finally a student, who had been in the U.S. Marine Corp, got up and walked down to the professor. The professor asked the student if he had proof that God existed when the Marine slugged the professor, knocking him out. When the professor  woke up the class was still there. The first person he saw was the Marine.  He asked him why did you hit me and the Marine said after spending 2 years in Iraq and believing in God and that God got him home safely, he heard God tell him to knock the professor out to prove there was a God. Also if the professor wanted more proof that there is a God,  then keep knocking the professor out until he had enough proof.",1405900800,4,874,4.129411764705883
6419366,5,B00KD5HFJG,"Let me say upfront that I am a devout, church-going, bible-reading Christian. And this movie has a Christian worldview so of course I enjoyed it. I found the storyline of a Christian college student challenged to defend his paradigm in front of the classroom by his smart-alleck Atheist professor who has a major chip on his shoulder, very intriguing. It treats the subjects of Atheism/Christianity and Belief/Unbelief very carefully and sensitively and even though it obviously sides with the college student--that he was in the right--you can still understand why the professor feels the way he feels, because of his bad circumstances that God has refused to relief him of; outliving his mother as a child and having a marriage on the rocks; why he thinks a God that wouldn't make life peaches and cream is not worth believing in.

Of course, I do not believe in say, Buddhism. But I would NEVER, ever tell a Buddhist to his face that he is mentally deranged or stupid simply because he does not agree with me because philosophical and religious belief is something that is very personal. We all see things differently and you can't win someone over to your way of thinking if you hold them in contempt or treat them like dirt. My question is if you are an Atheist then why would you even BOTHER to watch a movie that you KNOW FULL WELL is going to promote something you hate with such a fervor?

Also, the movie touches the painful subject of family members and friends clashing because of their disagreements such as the scene with the annoying blond girlfriend dumping Josh for not 'going with the flow' and the MUCH MORE DRASTIC subplot of the Muslim-turned-Christian girl. The scene where her father slaps her and kicks her out of the house just burned in my mind and even though I wanted to punch him out for hurting a girl I had to ask myself ""I am a Christian. How would I react if I suddenly found out that one of my family members (especially a son or daughter) was a Satanist or a closet homosexual or ANYTHING ELSE that I've been taught all my life to believe is morally wrong? Would I still love them? Would I be gentle or would I become physically and emotionally abusive? Would it be difficult to do the former or tempting to do the latter?"" Right after he kicks her out of house, he collapses in tears on the steps and you can see even though he's a mean bully, deep down inside he loves her and is finding her rejecting all that he's ever taught her extremely painful to deal with.

The acting and writing is on the whole very good. Shane Harper and Kevin Sorbo are solid in the two lead roles but the dynamic standouts that really moved me the most were Trisha LaFache as Amy (the red haired girl with cancer) and Hadeel Sittu as the Muslim-turned-Christian, Ayisha. They did an outstanding job showing the confusion and insecurities of the characters and their eventual newfound peace.

My only complaint is the scene where Amy is interviewing a couple getting ready to walk into a church about their faith in God. She's holding her cell phone, arm outstretched so that the recording device can pick up their voices but in some shots it looks like she's pointing a gun at them. At first I thought it was a gun and I said to myself ""Uh...that couple looks so composed and calm like it's the most ordinary think in the world. WHAT'S UP WITH THAT????"" The director should have reshot some of the shots in that scene so that the audience could clearly see it was a cell phone instead of a gun.

Other than that, I recommend this movie. Very good for discussions.",1405728000,10,3579,4.53405572755418

6419368,5,B00KD5HFJG,"I went to see this movie at the theater on a very warm June afternoon at the matinee and quite a few families were there with kids who had just finished the school year.  I don't have a long dissertation to write, but I was pleasantly surprised at how good this movie is.  It was well cast, and a character that stands out in the film is played by Shane Harper, a determined, never give up, infectiously optimistic young guy who is caught in a battle of wills with his college professor played by Kevin Sorbo who is very convincing as the Christopher Hitchens-type atheist.  It's a feel-good movie with lots of charm from some great actors including Dean Cain and the lovely Cory Oliver.  The Christian pop rock band, Newsboys make a cameo as do Willie and Korie Robertson of Duck Dynasty fame.",1405555200,6,794,4.493055555555555
6419369,4,B00KD5HFJG,"Of all of the Christian movies that incorporated Apologetics, this movie is the best yet.

THE PLOT
The movie begins with a young college student forced to make a decision to either listen to his girlfriend or to defend his faith against a professor hell-bent to destroy the faith of every Christian.  It is the nightmare scenario no young, unlearned, and inexperienced Christian ever wants to undergo and he had to go through it with a pompous, arrogant, and unmerciful much older man possessing an unparalleled depth of knowledgeable and experience.  Indeed, it is pathetic and utterly unfair fight.  However, in the end, the young man did win against him but not without costs and losses in between.

ACTS AND ACTORS/ACTRESSES
Among the things that impressed me most about the movie is how the professor is portrayed and presented.  It is as though an actual past tenured professor from any prestigious university inhabited an illustrious Kevin Sorbo's body and became, Professor Mean, I mean, Radisson.  It is truly well done, spot on, and complete show of a truly intellectual Goliath, scoffing and mocking the hapless boy David who's name is Josh who was played quite decently by the talented Shane Harper.  In terms of acting however, no one has done it better and more dramatically than the brilliant Trisha LaFache as Amy, an aggressive atheist news reporter.

Other characters portrayed Christians in difficult positions.  Cory Oliver plays as Mina, an often humiliated girlfriend of an unbelieving intellectual local luminary.  Worse... Hadeel Sittu acting as Ayisha, a closet Christian in a devout Muslim family which is a profoundly frightening.  If you are familiar with cases of ""Honor Killing"" and brutal Muslim persecutions of Christians all over the world, you know my meaning.  The rest of the characters shows the humor of trusting God in undesirable situations.  The knowledgeable Pastor David A.R.White plays Pastor Dave... go figure... perfect role for him helped by his upbeat friend, Reverend Jude, acted by the experienced, Kenyan-born Benjamin Alfred Onyango Ochieng.

THE GOODS AND THE UTTERLY CHEESEY.
I can't go into deeper details without spoiling everything but the movie was a very well done interwoven plots and all are interconnected wonderfully.  It is both entertaining, engaging, humorous, profound, and educational.  Some of the characters you will recognize and others comes as a surprise (Hint: Red and Beard).  All throughout the movie you will sympathize with the characters; laugh and hope, and cry with them to the end.

At the end however - SPOILER ALERT - occurred the most ""cheesy"" event I have ever seen since and lets just say its a pep rally moment that is to me, completely unrealistic, overusing the ... I'll just leave it at that.  There are however another negative I must mention.  There's an emphasis in the sexiness of certain female character you will instantly recognize.  While it's not quite graphic, it adds a bit of dirt into a great movie and it is also cheesy as well.  I think it was an attempt to appeal to the unbelieving audience.  I considered that totally un-necessary.  Back to the biggest cheese, about the pep rally moment, I'd rather that it ended quietly; with the character or characters at peace and thanking God for the victories that only He can give.  The Battle has already been decided and through them, He won:

44 And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.
45 Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.
46 This day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.
47 And all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is the Lord's, and he will give you into our hands.  - 1 Samuel 17:44-47 KJV

Despite the ""cheeziness"" of certain two, it is a movie worth watching over and over again.  With the compelling plot, the circumstances interwoven, the wonderful acts, and the wonderful end, buying this movie is well worth it.",1405555200,5,4450,4.749024707412223
6419370,5,B00KD5HFJG,"The message is clear and out there! Kudos to the filmmakers for making a great film that depicts the challenges of Christianity in our society today. As a Christian of more than thirty years in a family of non-believers, I will give copies of this movie to everyone for one reason....it begins a dialogue. Since the big dollars go to violence and zombies and because this movie isn't main stream it can be considered a lower budget film but what inspirational movie isn't these days. The professor was one of the most believable characters. I actually have had a few professors who stood in opposition against Christians and made their point of view very clear. In fact some of the non-believers turned from God for the reasons mentioned in the movie, so it is well written with hints of reality and truth. I will conclude with this comment, who goes to a movie with God's Not Dead as the title and does not expect it to have an undeniable message that backs up that truth?",1405555200,7,973,4.565714285714286
6419371,1,B00KD5HFJG,"Christian propaganda, anyone?  Do you, by chance, love TV movies with syrupy sweet conclusions?  Do you believe Christians are persecuted by the mean old philosophers?  Then this movie is for you.

In this day and age I am astounded by the thoughtlessness of the religious.  The team mentality that takes sides and strives to blot out the sun of reason, facts, and other spiritual paths.  In this case, we deal with Christians who want to prove the existence of THEIR GOD--not the actual deity, mind you (if you believe in a god or gods)--with the same old weak logic.  Using a boring and melodramatic plot to do so.

Conclusion?  God is not dead.  No.  But the Christian god is, I'm afraid.  No more hardening Pharaoh's heart to CAUSE death and misery.  No more Joshuah's who can get god to stop the sun from revolving around Earth (quite a trick, if you believe in science).  No more mountains to take Jesus to the top of and have him see all the kingdoms of Earth.  (Which mountain was that?)

And, most importantly, no more fear of eternal torment, torture, fear, guilt, and shame from a ""loving"" god.

I will not spoil the movie for you, but this story is a mindless advocacy of the existence of the Bible's god.  A thoughtful writer would have discussed the existence of a deity from all angles, all faith-based viewpoints, and created a fictional debate with some deep, unsettling questions left unanswered.  Instead, we get a cookie-cutter god who changes the hearts of the reasonable and has them overlook the most disgusting and frightening parts of the Bible.  Yikes.

The time for brains is now.  Rise up and think.  AVOID THIS MOVIE.

Read a Bart Ehrman book instead.",1405468800,28,1680,4.674657534246576

Kevin Sorbo was magnificent in his role as an atheist professor-being a Christian,this role was a challenge for him and he delivered a powerful performance. Shane Harper was great as the Christan student defending his faith. The other stories were good,too and they all came together nicely at the end, although the fate of the professor was not something I expected. I have ordered the DVD and look forward to watching the movie again! Everyone should see this movie,whether you are a believer or not-it will may you think about what you believe!",1405468800,5,654,4.646551724137931
6419373,5,B00KD5HFJG,it's beautifully done and an excellent film depicting a student defending his faith,1405382400,4,83,5.461538461538462
6419374,3,B00KD5HFJG,"The best thing I ever heard about God's existence was said by Joseph Campbell (a mythologist but not an atheist).  It was (paraphrase): if we could prove God, we wouldn't need faith.
I have not seen the movie, I intend to, but I will not review it as my review would be as biased by my belief set as every other review of this movie (well, MOST reviews).
OK, I saw the movie (a little more than a month later)and I stick with my three stars.  I borrowed it from my library.
Good production qualities, a real movie.
There are some really nasty people to hate, really.  The script is manipulative as hell.  And as hateful as the characters are, the most sadistic of all is the screenwriter who kills off the professor and leaves him with a death-bed (no bed) conversion, tarnishing the names of all the atheists who do NOT have death-bed conversions, even some who Christians claim had them when they didn't.  And the screen-writer does not fail to besmirch Islam while he was at it.  I wonder why he didn't come after Jews.
SO manipulative was the film that, had I been a character in the film, I'd have been the atheist who helped Josh to prepare his arguments!
This is a movie designed to help Christians feel good about themselves.  It accomplishes nothing more than that.  I liked the music.",1405209600,,1294,4.476595744680851
6419375,5,B00KD5HFJG,"My husband and I went to see this movie on a Friday night and even though we had been told that the movie was good, we did not expect that much. Well... the movie ended up being great! My husband who was raised atheist and who is now starting his path as a Christian was very happy, he said this is the kind of movie he needs to see to grow in faith.
I also never ever expected a christian movie to fill up the theater by young people on a Friday night  to the point that we actually had to sit on the very first row to the end...there was no more space!.
Great great movie.. Highly recommend it !",1405123200,17,597,3.9338842975206614
6419376,5,B00KD5HFJG,Great movie best one I've ever seen everything was spot on and if you don't think so I advise you to go read your bible,1404950400,3,119,3.8
6419377,5,B00KD5HFJG,I LOVED it! It is a awesome movie and a  must see film.,1404691200,4,55,3.230769230769231
6419378,5,B00KD5HFJG,I saw it in the movie theater.  It was one of the best Christian movies I had seen in years.  I usually don't watch a movie more then once but this one I would.  The story line is not totally predictable an the ending wants to make you cry.  Yes it is a tear jerker.,1404518400,4,266,3.7818181818181817
6419379,5,B00KD5HFJG,"As I read the negative comments,  all I could think of is: Something inside you made you want to go see it.  This is an inspiring story that will impact everyone who watches the movie. Through the different stories of the characters we have the opportunity to relate to one, either to agree with it or to disagree with the representation of it. However in the end the message will speak to you in one way or another.  Weather you listen to the message or not it's up to you.",1404259200,46,474,4.2444444444444445
6419380,5,B00KD5HFJG,"OMG! Make a movie with a *God exists, atheists are wrong* slant and the poor babies come crawling out of the woodwork! The movie is simplistic, for sure, but a terrific parable for our times, when Christianity is under relentless attack from all sides. Listen: Anyone who sincerely believes that the universe and everything in it created itself out of NOTHINGNESS (not even a single atomic particle of matter or energy anywhere) is not thinking logically or rationally, and in no position to criticize those who sincerely believe the simple truths that something cannot come from nothing and something can never be nothing. Believing that the universe and all the matter and energy in it ALWAYS existed is just as illogical and irrational. Those who believe in God (or a Creator) are logical, rational thinkers who understand these simple truths. Faith is fine for those who need faith to believe scientific fact, but isn't necessary. Those who don't believe in a Creator (God) are in deep, serious denial of the elementary laws of physics. SOMETHING CANNOT COME FROM NOTHING, folks, and SOMETHING CAN NEVER BE NOTHING. NOTHING CAN ALWAYS HAVE EXISTED; Everything had to have had a beginning. The universe did not create itself and was not always here and denying the existence of a Creator can never change those simple, undeniable facts.",1404086400,12,1339,5.00896860986547
6419381,5,B00KD5HFJG,"I went expecting to not like it- maybe that is why it blew me away. There were so many aspects to like about the movie: well written, good casting, acting was smooth and great music. It should appeal to a wide audience. Great recommendation for college age people since that is the genre and target, but all ages would enjoy.",1403222400,6,325,4.433333333333334
8657721,5,B00KD5HFJG,"I find with most movies you can't always trust the ratings. God's Not Dead is one of the best religious movies released. Not only is it inspiring and uplifting, it has great acting and a great plot. Which can't be said for all Christian movies. Definitely a must watch.",1532822400,,269,4.510204081632653
8657722,5,B00KD5HFJG,"Not sure why this movie has such a poor IMDb rating. I encourage everyone to watch this movie. As movies go its actually very well don't but the message contained is what really matters. If you have been questioning the existance of God, how this earth started, or just hace general curiosity about Christianity I highly suggest this movie. I promise you will not be disappointed.",1532563200,,380,4.7727272727272725

Grab your cell phone and record the part about the old lady at the nursing home and her successful unbelieving son visiting her. She has a lucid moment and explains why successful people rarely come to Christ. Share THAT screen moment with EVERYONE...and the end as well with the student and the professor in their last debate.",1531699200,,413,4.75
