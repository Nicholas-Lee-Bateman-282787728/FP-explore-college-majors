2811949,4,B000P6R5QG,I found this documentary extremely informative giving a variety of perspectives on the Bermuda Triangle phenomenon. I had read some of the books on the subject referred to in the DVD and appreciated the opportunity to see all data and current conjecture presented. I would recommend this DVD to anyone interested in exploring the issue.,1237248000,8,336,5.127272727272727
2811950,5,B000P6R5QG,"If ever there was a documentary about the Bermuda triangle,this would be it! From the beginning this documentary sets the tone for the rest of the hour plus. From the earliest reports of missing ships of old to missing planes of the present,this one covers it all. I must say I have a bias to this dvd as it really covered in depth the disappearance of flight 19. Every possible theory is covered and explained to great detail. The viewer will be able to follow it through to the end. I would highly recommended this dvd to anyone wanting to begin their exploration of all things un-explainable,hope that made sense!).",1194998400,17,618,4.627272727272727

8189484,1,B000P6R5QG,"This had so much promise, yet it missed the mark. This was clearly done by skeptics who don't like to believe in anything (not very informative either). I expect better from The History Channel. Some people just can't accept the fact that there are things that have no scientific explanation. The Bermuda Triangle is one of those things. No one will ever truly understand it. Like why it chooses to take certain ships and planes into oblivion, while allowing others through to their destinations. To summarize avoid this documentary made by atheists and check out ""The Devil's Triangle"" narrated by Vincent Price and Charles Berlitz "" The Bermuda Triangle, those 2 are great and more informative.",1424649600,,696,5.008620689655173
8189485,3,B000P6R5QG,This is an older show so it won't take long to notice the material is dated but it is still worth the purchase in my opinion.  Good addition to the history channel collection.,1418688000,,175,4.303030303030303
8189486,5,B000P6R5QG,"There was no ""Sci-Fi""  hyperbole nor fabrication of myths. It nailed the issue with scientific precision and amazing clarity. It totally persuaded me that this ""mystery"" has  been  solved.

8189487,3,B000P6R5QG,"Maybe I just want to believe in the Burmuda Triangle so much, that when I hear the people trying thier hardest to disprove it, it upsets me ?
Maybe thats why I like Ancient Aliens so much? Just scientists showing the data and asking ""maybe this happened"" and "" how could people have done this thousands of years ago?"" nobody saying ""thats crazy!""

As with most History Channel programs, it is presented in a classy fashion that shows allot of interesting scenes and scenarios, but would be much more interesting and ""fun"" without the negative input.",1348358400,2,549,4.71875
8189488,5,B000P6R5QG,My wife and I liked this video a lot.  It really puts things into place about all the myths.  Gets strait to the facts.,1297987200,,119,3.9166666666666665
8189489,4,B000P6R5QG,"I was really torn between giving this DVD four or five stars, and I finally went with the four stars for what I felt was a very strong argument: To a novice student of the Bermuda Triangle and its' mysteries, it definitely would be at a five star level, because this would probably be an introduction to the subject for them, and/or be chockful of facts, information and theories previously unknown to them...but to a Triangle veteran - which I think would make up more of the audience looking for this type of DVD -, this does have a great deal of 'known' info on it. While I agree with a previous review that the DVD goes all out in detailing a multi-plane squadron that disappeared into legend, very little of what was shown, discussed and related was anything new. I also didn't care for what I felt were tipped scales toward the skeptic's view of the Triangle; whether water-spouts, giant squids, freak storms and/or waves, even pirates, this documentary threw them all in to possibly explain something which refuses to ber explained. The most interesting clips to me were of the undersea exploration of what some believers have come to think is Atlantis or another lost civilization; alas, this is a very short sequence, and is immediately anchored down with an onscreen 'authority' disputing that anything built by human hands has ever been found in that area. And so, will I watch it again, now that I own it? Probably, because, at least it does get one thinking about something that seems to be very, very real (I lived in Florida for awhile, boated along the edge of what we called The Devil's Triangle, and I'll tell you, there's something weird about it that cannot be explained, skeptics be damned), and it is very professionally presented. And, as I said, newbies to the subject will be more than thrilled with this doc -, so, four stars for us old men and women of the sea, five for those just getting their sea legs.",1292371200,5,1932,4.619186046511628
8189490,5,B000P6R5QG,"Mi hijo necesitaba dar un informe de el Tringulo de las Bermudas y compre este documental. Es super interesante, facil de entender, muy visual y da todas las posibilidades, hiptesis y explicaciones que existen sobre el mismo. Es un documental familiar y como todo lo que hacen en History Chanel, educativo. Se lo recomiendo a todos, en especial a las escuelas.",1274313600,2,360,4.918032786885246
