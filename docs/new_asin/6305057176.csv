7881448,5,6305057176,"My son, age 3, loves this video.  He buys apples everytime we go to the grocery store since we bought it.  The video takes you on a detailed tour of an apple orchard, an apple sorting facility, an apple pie filling factory, and an apple cider factory.  I own five farming videos, and this is by far the best and the most entertaining.  It also includes an apple theme song throughout the video, which he loves to sing.",1076025600,,418,4.32051282051282
