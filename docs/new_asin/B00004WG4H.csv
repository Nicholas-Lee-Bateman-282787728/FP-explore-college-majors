1364564,5,B00004WG4H,"Since I am of Irish heritage I started to watch this series because of the inherent comic/dramatic possibilities of a young English priest in an Irish village. It did not disappoint in this and the characters encountered in the saga of Father Peter Clifford in Ballykissangel are entertaining and very Irish,though part old Irish and part modern. I followed this series almost to the bitter end, which is much longer than the first 3 series now available on DVD or video.  The first part is better than the latter part and I began to lose interest after the series took a rather dramatic turn midway through.  I will not reveal that dramatic turn but I thought it was a very poor resolution of that part of the story and I never had the same affection for it thereafter.  Up to that time, however, it was a delightful story of the Irish in a small village with their eccentricities and foibles and the befuddlement of the young priest trying to get used to them and guide them, and at the same time deal with some rather serious issues of his own.  During the course of the entire run of the series, you see a long line of well-known Irish actors and actresses, not the least of which is Colin Farrell in what had to be his first real part. He's come a long way since Ballykissangel but you could see the star quality even then.  Over all, a very watchable and entertaining tragicomedy but beware the denoument somewhere around the 5th or 6th season, if the whole series ever appears on DVD.  It's a shocker.",1130198400,18,1508,4.485401459854015
1364565,4,B00004WG4H,"WARNING! If you have never seen an episode of ""Ballykissangel"" and are starting from the beginning like I did today, be aware that on the second disc there is a special feature that looks back on the making of the show. It includes several spoilers including what would have to be the biggest spoiler of them all. So if you want to get all the way through to Series Three and not have things ruined for you then skip the ""On the Ballykissangel Trail"" featurette so what happened to me does not happen to you.

""Ballykissangel"" is about young Father Peter Clifford (Stephen Tompkinson) who has come from England to the Irish town of Ballykissangel (Baile Coisc Aingeal) to be the curate at the local parish. You would think that the problem is going to be that the young priest is English, but it turns out to be his way of thinking and not his country of origin that shakes things up in town:

Episode 1, ""Trying to Connect You"" (Written by Kieran Prendiville, First aired February 11, 1996) starts with an interesting race. Can the new priest get to town before whatever is in that giant crate marked ""Fragile"" that is rolling down the mountainside and into Ballykissangel? Father Peter gets a ride Assumpta Fitzgerald (Dervla Kirwan), who runs the local tavern and has no use for the church. Then there are Niamh Quigley (Tina Kellegher) and Ambrose Egan (Peter Hanly), who are supposed to be getting married. But she wants to make sure they are really compatible which means living and sleeping together and he does not want to commit a mortal. Meanwhile, Father MacAnally (Niall Toibin) is not happy to have a new curate who cannot drive and then there is what is in that box that Brian Quigley (Tony Doyle) has bought for the church.

Episode 2, ""The Things We Do for Love"" (Written by Kieran Prendiville, First aired February 18, 1996), has Father Peter and Brian Quigley butting heads again. Quigley is planning a holiday home development and a young couple are living in a caravan near the site, so he orders his men to dump ""organic fertilizer"" right next to the caravan, which is making the young couple's baby sick. Father Peter does not like what is going on, but he has his own problems when Jenny Clark (Lena Headey), a parishioner from Manchester shows up because she thinks he has feelings for her. Fortunately there is a Gaelic football match that is going to be played in which Peter is the reserve goalkeeper, and Soiban (Deirdre Donnelly) has a bright idea.

Episode 3, ""Live in My Heart and Pay No Rent"" (Written by Kieran Prendiville, First aired on February 25, 1996), has a stone statue of St. John falling off of the church and crashing into Ambrose's car right after he got out of it. So he decides this is a sign from God, calls off his wedding to Niamh, and decides to become a priest. Niamh is already upset because her father is going to be meeting up with his old girlfriend. So she decides that under the circumstances, even if she is not getting married she still wants her wedding reception.

Episode 4, ""Fallen Angel"" (Written by John Forte, First aired March 3, 1996), has Ambrose on the trail of a pirate radio station in the village, while Father Peter has been warned he needs get his license and a car or he will be shipped back home. Assumpta agrees to give him driving lessons, which is probably a mistake. Meanwhile, on a hospital visit Peter encounters a former judge, Michael Bradley (Aidan Grennell), who proves to be even more of a challenge than the driving test. That is because apparently no parish priest has ever failed the test, but Father Peter does not like the idea of a fix and his prospects for passing the test have everybody placing bets.

Episode 5, ""The Power and the Gory"" (Written by John Forte, First aired March 10, 1996), begins with the local representative to the Irish Parliament being buried, which means a contest for the seat between Brian Quigley and Sean Dooley (Owen Roe). The television reporter sent to cover the election turns out to be Assumpta's ex-boyfriend, Leo McGarvey (James Nesbitt), and while Father Peter is hoping to get some publicity about replacing the bell at the church, McGarvey wants to know about the old bones that Quigley's men have uncovered out at the development site.

Episode 6, ""Missing Your Already"" (Written by Kieran Prendiville, First aired March 17, 1996) finds Father Peter has been told he has to return to England. He wants to know why and we want to know if he is really going to go. Brian Quigley's latest brainstorm to get visitors to BallyK is to get a three-day license to open a bar and grill, which is going to take money away from Fitzgerald's. Adding insult to injury, Quigley has put a ram up on some scaffolding, which has upset Soiban. Father Peter might not be able to do anything about leaving BallyK, but he can certainly do something about the sheep and perhaps even preside over a wedding.

This is a charming little show, and what strikes me most is that it is like a situation comedy that has been put in a lower gear to make it into an ""hour"" long show. The road to acceptance is not as hard as Father Peter thinks that it is and the locals are not quite as eccentric as you would expect (Eamonn and his wooden sheep are the proverbial exception). I read that ""Ballykissangel"" was the BBC's version of ""Northern Exposure,"" which only goes to prove the wide cultural gulf that exists between two lands separated by a common tongue. Half of the show's six series are available on DVD so you can proceed to Series Two if it strikes your fancy.",1123286400,32,5574,4.589357429718875
1364566,4,B00004WG4H,"This drama set in a small town in Ireland is less significant for its substance than for the days-gone-by nostalgia feel of it. It is a wonderfully simple program; a sort of Andy Griffith Show foundation enlivened by modernity. We see an attractive barkeep who has vague qualms with the religion into which she was born begin to respect the new priest in town as he jockeys with his older generational priest-supervisor. Through this prism we can see what we want of Ireland's more recent development. The program encourages us to take sides between the traditionalist (sometimes selfish) church of the past, and a more lively (but less absolute) version of it, as evinced by this young priest from afar who stirs up this town a bit. It's not at all a religious program, mind you; just an overly unrepresentitive portrayal of idyllic Ireland in which you cannot fail to include religion. Full disclosure: I like this show, but I also have Irish blood. I say this because this really is a program which appeals to a particular sort of individual; to one who either has Irish blood and/or for those whom Ireland has some draw. Ireland has an inherent appeal to many such people from around the world. Even if you have never visited it, can you not right now visualize vast green fields and rolling hills bordered by stone walls, snugly cozy pubs filled with glasses of Guiness raised, and smiling faces? Of course, i'm exaggerating here, but you must grant that Ireland is a far more attractive place than many others, at least in a theorhetical quality-of-life sort of way. It's thought of as the sort of place where stress is not as prevalent as where one finds oneself; having a bygone character to it (notwithstanding this not to be as true in actuality, but like in many other things, imagination often persists over reality). If I am making any sense to you with this, Ballykissangel may be to your liking. If you are familiar with Garrison Keillor's pubic radio show, ""A Prairie Home Companion"" (saturdays 6pm across the USA), Ballykissangel is to Ireland what the fictional town of ""Lake Woebegone"" is to the American heartland. I recommend both. Both evince what a part of us long for (if you are a nostalgic sort of person, regardless of your age--even a 25 year old can long for previous eras) and even though such may not suit us, it does make us inclined to enjoy programs like ""A Prarie Home Companion"" and ""Ballykissangel"". I hope this review of sorts was of use to you. Cheers!  P.S. If you do give this program a try and find it to your liking I'd like to let you know that the ""set"" of Ballykissangel isn't one at all; but rather is an one-street town (called Avoca) that was occassionally commandeered for filming so that you can actually travel to it! To have a drink in its pub, visit its church and so on is a somewhat surreal experience; as you walk into ""the program"", so to speak, that you have enjoyably watched from afar. Now, where else can you do something like that! (04Aug) Cheers!",1116547200,29,3010,4.6367041198501875
1364567,5,B00004WG4H,"Watching these first two episodes of Bally-K is a supremely pleasant experience.  After watching a couple seasons of the show, to go back and see the beginning is fun.  One can see foreshadowings of future plot lines, appreciate the characters and their quirkiness, and relax with these old friends.",1012521600,5,299,5.081632653061225
1364568,5,B00004WG4H,"Another reviewer has compared BALLYKISSANGEL to NORTHERN EXPOSURE, and there's certainly some truth to that.  An outsider arrives in a small town.  He quickly finds himself squeezed by the pressure of the local financial overlord, the town conscience, a group of occasionally odd individuals, and his own feelings for an unattainable woman.  And, just when the the transplanted hero gets REALLY interesting, the actor playing him decides to ""pursue other interests"", leaving the show's producers to scramble in another lead actor.
Only, unlike NORTHERN EXPOSURE, BallyK's inhabitants are a bit more realistic than Cicely's.  You won't find  radio announcers making catapult art, insane hypochondriacs badgering hermit chefs, or waitresses breaking into chronic song.  Rather, BallyK is peopled by characters who present us with humor derived from their very ordinary humanity.
In truth, after the departure of Stephen Tompkinson and Dervla Kirwan, that humanity becomes a little too ordinary, and the show slips into a kind of soap opera normalcy.  But for the two-year tenure of Tompkinson's Father Clifford and Kirwan's Assumpta Fitzgerald, BallyK is a fascinating place, where the storyline is fresh, and the characters genuinely evolve.
It's clear that the writers love their characters.  They take great care to provide us with ones so involving, it is sometimes difficult to discern who the stars of the show actually are.  Each main character has a well-defined relationship with all the rest.
At the end of the day, however, the show is most about two of them.  The writers' greatest feat is the complete story arc of the Clifford-Fitzgerald relationship.  It stands as one of the most complex liasons in the history of English-language television.  Each episode teases greater definition out of the characters, and greater loyalty out of the viewer.  By the end of their run, both Father Clifford and Asumpta have grown well beyond their initial characterizations.
I don't think that the whole of the first two seasons is yet available on VHS, but no matter.  Start here at the beginning and work your way slowly forward.  By the time you get to Topkinson and Kirwan's departure, you'll be left wondering why series television can't generally be this good.",978566400,60,2265,5.252777777777778

Ballykissangel just happens to be the one of  the best bbc programs I have ever seen. I just hope they keep putting more  of them on video to enjoy as our local stations don't show them in a steady  stream.  ballykissagel vol. 1 (trying to connect you and the things we do  for love) video are worth buying!

1364582,3,B00004WG4H,Sometimes things are not as a person remembers.  Ballykissangel was a show I enjoyed years ago when first seen on PBS.  This is not as  good as I remembered.

I do remember that as the show progressed there was much more about the people who inhabit  Ballykissangel.

1364658,3,B00004WG4H,I have recently come to watching this series.  The first few episodes were good.  But I must admit that I am not a fan of Assumpta.  I expect that she was directed to act so annoyingly with all of her harsh rude outbursts.  It was never explained why she hated/resented the Catholic church so much.  Maybe if that had been done then her rudeness might have been better tolerated.  Father Peter's facial responses are very revealing.  I liked the sub character plots better.  The actors were varied and believable.,1419552000,,513,4.685393258426966

1364715,4,B00004WG4H,"As at least one other reviewer has reported, the developing relationship between Father Clifford and Assumpta makes this worth watching. Unfortunately, the medium of television in the US and Britain is such that writers and producers weave a good story with many others, mostly unrelated. This dilutes the stronger story. For my money, the sooner streaming replaces TV, the better. If you prefer strong stories centered on relationships, and are comfortable with subtitles, try streaming a 16 to 20 episode Korean drama, a few available here on Amazon and many available on other legitimate, licensed sites. The Korean language (at least nowadays) encapsulates emotion in accentuations the same way English does.",1417824000,,712,5.423423423423423

1364717,4,B00004WG4H,"I am really torn about this.  I like it, but I'm not sure why.  But there is something that keeps me watching.  Perhaps it is because they give respect to the priest's faith while at the same time showing others who are more hypocrites, or unbelievers. However I find that the British really are best at comedy and mystery.  Drama is not where they do well except in recreation of classic novels.",1417824000,,396,4.458333333333333

Kind of a soap opera but once you start you are hooked.  The characters become your neighbors.  Have watched all the episodes more than once and will watch again.

I've loved every episode so far and I'm well into watching Season 2.  I'm happy to report that all six seasons are available.

She and Father Michael remained together in ""real life"" for about two years after she left.  The show had great writers and even when he left it continued to hold my interest; in fact I'm still watching it with the new priest.  They weren't married when they met on this show thank god because once I found out that Timothy Christopher on All Creatures Great and Small, a married man with six children, was pursuing his ""wife"" on the show (she refused him), I just couldn't watch it anymore.  It ruined the character.  It broke my heart when Ambrose died broken-hearted by his wife's cheating.",1414368000,,746,4.529850746268656
1364864,4,B00004WG4H,"The series begins well, with the attachment of a Ballykissangel publican for a Roman Catholic priest, a platonic, but nonetheless passionate affair that has to end badly. After all, the series was produced in Catholic Ireland. The supporting characters are colorful and a bit eccentric, and they help to carry the plot.  It is pretty obvious from the start that the idea of a priest marrying a divorced Irish girl is out of the question, which makes the series more of a fantasy than a reality.",1414368000,,494,4.744186046511628

However, one caveat is that I have seen these shows before, and so knowing what will come next dampens my enthusiasm. Yet, I also noticed in piecing together memories of the plot of one show that the outcomes are not actually so obvious. Thus, my original enthusiasm might have been a 5. At the same time,  the end results are relatively predictable for the most part, save for the occasional plot twist. This is an interesting British feel good show, and that's why I return to it. Yet, as a feel good show, it does have its limits. But, being British and interesting, it far outshines any American feel good show. It is worth your time.",1404345600,,652,4.470588235294118

1365262,5,B00004WG4H,"I was very apprehensive at first as this was a different kind of series for me. By episode four, I was hooked as I became enamored with the Irish characters in their fictional Ireland town of Ballykissangel. This is merely a small Irish town with all the usual suspects and stereotypes and the dialog is crisp, although for an American, sometimes difficult to understand. I understand the intent of the language as I was raised in an Irish-American family where the retorts were quick and often cut to the bone. Characters are crisp and the sexual tension between Father Peter and Assumpta is a delight and torture. As a Catholic, I keep offering my suffering to the saints in heaven.

Each part of the series is just over 50 minutes long which is perfect for someone like myself who is sewing or working something else with my hands at the time. Solid series that I strongly recommend.",1400803200,,886,4.643312101910828

But at times, his ways bring him in a head to head  conflict with his superior who is still entrenched in older Catholic methods.",1400803200,,473,4.5

The writer's did an excellent job with the story line, each character has his or her own plot
to follow and you are magically pulled into the story. Some evenings I would watch three
episodes just to see what happened next. This is a wholesome story about the lives in a
small Irish town. I recommend this show highly, a nice way to end your evening.",1400716800,,443,4.349397590361446

Seasons 1-3 were the best seasons of this show and I really went into withdrawal after I watched all 6 seasons and there was nothing left to watch.  The setting is Northern Ireland and the scenery is beautiful.  There are a lot of twists and turns in the plot.  The basic scenario is that a young priest from England starts a new chapter of his life in Northern Ireland.

It is a comedy/drama with a young British priest's daily conflict of mixing in  with his Irish community, being made the butt of some of their jokes and learning how to love them and protect them in some of the most outlandish situations.  I really enjoyed it.",1396224000,,423,4.613333333333333

1365400,2,B00004WG4H,I found this series after thoroughly enjoying the Bishop of Dilby series. I asked for a similar series and this was recommended. About the only similarity between the two series is the religious theme of the shows.,1395446400,,214,4.8108108108108105

Purely entertaining and very very very very enjoyable.",1395446400,,124,5.25
1365405,4,B00004WG4H,"The first season had lots of funny illustrations of a minister new to his calling and to his assignment.  Was very disappointed when
the writers brought in a romantic attachment and had him leaving his vocation.  Was this a way to get the lead actor out of the series?",1395360000,,268,4.448979591836735

1365411,3,B00004WG4H,"I hadn't heard about this show before when I ran across it on Prime. It has a lovely, pastoral setting (small town in Ireland) and its stories are all about the people there, primarily the priest from England. It is not a 'must-see' or 'water-cooler' show, but I enjoy watching this charming little series every now and then as a break from the gritty, violent, dark dramas that are, let's face it, very compelling but mostly downers.",1395014400,,434,4.64935064935065
1365412,5,B00004WG4H,Thoroughly enjoyed the series.  Would recommend it to the same folks who enjoy Doc Martin.  All of the actors are great for their parts.,1395014400,,136,4.625

1365418,5,B00004WG4H,"Irish village life laid out and played out for all the world to see. Mostly light-hearted, it disarms with its charming and eccentric characters.  This show is reminscent of "" Doc Martin""  in its sensibility and aesthetic.  At this point, in Season 2, I am delighted there are so many seasons yet to look forward to.",1394755200,,316,4.607142857142857

1365422,4,B00004WG4H,A bit old school but easy to watch. Beautiful scenery too. I never got a chance to watch it on TV - something easy to look forward to at the end of a long work day.,1394409600,,164,3.5833333333333335
1365423,4,B00004WG4H,This is a nice little series that gives a glimpse of life in an Irish village. The main character is a Roman Catholic priest who is English. But he's sincere and works hard at making life better for his parishioners. The main characters working against this are the pastor who supervises him and who is much more conservative and focused on getting money for the church as well as a developer in town who is always coming up ways to make more money for himself usually at the expense of the village. Some of the characters are a little too one dimensional and some of the plot twists are a little too simplistic but overall it's a pleasant and fun series.,1394236800,,655,4.421487603305785
1365424,4,B00004WG4H,"For a series which involves a priest or 2, it is still catchy enough for everyone to enjoy. And the priests are central characters, but there are lots of supports as well.",1394150400,,171,4.375
1365425,5,B00004WG4H,"My wife and I stumbled upon the Ballykissangel series after finishing Doc Martin last fall.  Suffice to say we have really enjoyed it and, now that we are halfway through season 6, are sad to be near completion.  Overall, we liked series 1-3 best but were able to warm to the new characters in the later series as well.  Do wish they'd done a better job transitioning between seasons (reconciling characters who suddenly left/disappeared) but again overall this has been at or near the top of our list of favorite TV shows.",1393977600,,523,4.663043478260869
1365426,4,B00004WG4H,The characters are great.  The stories are realistic. And it feels accurate to small town Irish life. Would be 5 stars if it were high def but that is a minor annoyance.,1393977600,,169,4.28125
1365427,5,B00004WG4H,A show we watched when it first came out....great time to sit back and relax and not worried that we missed it on network TV,1393977600,,124,4.0

1365431,5,B00004WG4H,I fell in love with the characters immediately.  It is well acted and I am looking forward to watching all 6 seasons.  I would highly recommend this show.  If you are a fan of Doc Martin you will like this also.,1393804800,,211,4.097560975609756
1365432,5,B00004WG4H,I like the charters and the humor is to good.  The scenery is good and you get a look at Irish life.,1393804800,,100,3.5454545454545454
1365433,5,B00004WG4H,This is one of the best shows I've ever watched on TV. It's interesting to see the relationships grow and how everyone copes with good times and bad. Very realistic but fun all the way. Some characters are replaced as the series develops over time and newer people don't miss a beat. I own the whole series on DVD after enjoying it on PBS about 10 years ago. Highly recommended.,1393804800,,378,4.414285714285715
1365434,5,B00004WG4H,I like this series. It's very small town Irish countryside. I enjoy getting to know all the characters in a situational series and this series is a good example of that. I would recommend it,1393718400,,190,4.457142857142857

1365437,5,B00004WG4H,"Again, this is one of the best series I've ever seen and I love it. It just needs to be captioned!  But it's just grand. You can't go wrong watching this superb series.",1393545600,,168,4.090909090909091

The characters ring so true to the people I knew there. The language is absolutely right, the writing is brilliant and the window into the lives of the real and true Irish folks is simply beautiful.
The moment I hear the music i am transported back to those very happy days I first went to BALLYKISSANGEL.",1393459200,,481,4.465909090909091

1365442,5,B00004WG4H,"Though it's from the 90's, this show is still a joy to watch.  You get drawn in to all the characters, though Father Clifford and Assumpta Fitzgerald are the overarching storyline for the first 3 seasons.  The characters are quirky, but easy to associate with.  While it's a drama, there are many comical moments and situations.  You sort of get it all.",1393286400,,353,4.645161290322581
1365443,5,B00004WG4H,This is not the first time I watched the entire series of Ballykissangel and probably will not be the last.  If you are interested in small towns and the goings on this is not to be missed.  The acting is excellent and the stories are sometimes funny and other times can make you cry.  I saw this when it first came to PBS on the East Coast and have been recommending ever since.,1393200000,,379,4.164383561643835

1365477,5,B00004WG4H,Ballykissangel is a wonderful show. Smart and funny with a host of lovable and colorful characters. There's also a sharp edge in there that keeps things interesting and moving. It has this non-Irish yank tossing around a bit of the brogue and cringing when the golf commentators mispronounce Padraig Harrington's first name.,1390953600,,324,5.25
1365478,5,B00004WG4H,"Ever since Downton Abbey, I am hooked on the accents.  This  is a fun and sometimes serious look at a priest new to a small town and all the sane and wacky people he has to deal with.  Great show",1390867200,,195,3.825
1365479,4,B00004WG4H,"These episodes build upon each other.  As you get to know the characters and the individual personalities you discover their idiosyncrasies, you see how the priest learns to interact with each.  It is an enjoyable story.",1390867200,,220,5.083333333333333
1365480,5,B00004WG4H,"Great ""take me away"" series. Reminds me of the Dr. Harriott series ""all creatures great and small"". It's worth watching.",1390867200,,120,5.05

1365484,3,B00004WG4H,"The main character here was likable, but the whole ""Fish out of Water' storyline has been done so many times that after one episode it seemed too predictable, including the rich parishioner and the grumpy cute girl, which I am sure will end up being with the guy by second season.
Technicalities: Image is not the best, no subtitles (love my British shows, but prefer to keep up with every word they say) and the main synopsis for season 4 tells you right away of the death of one of the main characters(seriously!)",1390694400,,515,4.548387096774194

1365486,5,B00004WG4H,"I was desperately seeking something to watch after Doc Martin.  I love the writing and intricate story lines and, of course the characters.  Perhaps not for everyone, but I am so sick of American shows with blood, gore and no moral values.  To me this is brilliant story writing at its best.",1390348800,,291,4.5576923076923075
1365487,4,B00004WG4H,"The first few programs were very nice to watch, we enjoyed them thoroughly.  The show reminds me of the American 1990's television show ""Northern Exposure""  where an urban doctor was relocated to a small Alaskan village.  In this case, an English priest relocates to a small Irish village.  Has much the same feel, I look forward to future episodes.",1390348800,,349,4.864406779661017

1365489,4,B00004WG4H,"This series is one that the entire family can enjoy. There's nothing overtly sexy, rude or bad language. The humor is cute, there are situations that need resolution, the actors are good in their roles. It's a safe bet series, that you wouldn't feel bad watching it with either your grandchildren or your mother-in-law.",1390089600,,319,4.925925925925926

  I am compelled to relax and enjoy the visits all the same. These folks are as familiar as Andy and Barney, in their way, and I'm
  happy to endure all their annoying habits.
A few years have passed since last we visited BallyK, and it seems the locals have only mellowed, if they've changed at all, at all.",1390003200,,440,4.265060240963855

1365495,5,B00004WG4H,"I love this series!  As others have said, the first three seasons are the best.  The chemistry between the two main characters is something I truly felt (probably because they fell in love in reality).  Don't want to say too much and ""spill the beans"" which a few reviewers have done.  Because of that I knew what was going to happen but it still was worth the journey.  We had a cold snap here so I spent too many hours watching this series and became addicted!  It felt like a real community.

I have never had a series pull me in the way this one has.  My family laughs at me because I have watched some of the shows over again (a few times).  The actors and writers should be proud of the fine work they created.  I grew up Roman Catholic and we sure didn't have any priests like Father Peter Clifford.  He is handsome, caring and funny.  What a great combo!  His inner struggles are heart breaking at times.  Watch at least the first 3 seasons and you will not be disappointed.  It is a bit dated but a great story is timeless!",1389830400,,1032,4.220512820512821
1365496,5,B00004WG4H,"IMO the best things to watch come from the UK. This old series from BBC Northern Ireland is another one to love: great characters, great setting, good acting, wonderful mix of comedy and drama. Worth the watch and then some!",1389830400,,224,4.625
1365497,5,B00004WG4H,"It is so funny and in good taste.  Love it love it love it.

1365502,5,B00004WG4H,"We love this series....we have actually watched it previously and have returned to it.  We are not Catholic, but appreciate the reverence that this priest shows for his responsibilities and his faith.  So many programs belittle religion and we like the ""pure religion"" aspect of this program sans politics.  It is refreshing!  Too bad it does not reflect more of our modern-day culture--it was made in the late 1990's!",1389484800,,418,5.0144927536231885
1365503,5,B00004WG4H,"I started watching this show because of the main actor who has stared in an excellent African series and a mystery series on PBS.

1365510,4,B00004WG4H,"This is a great take.  The characters are funny and the plots are so entertaining right from the get go.  The plot of the very first episode is an air conditioned, fully equipped confessional is the center of all the village characters.  The most hilarious reaction comes from the new 'English' priest plopped amidst the Irish inhabitants of Ballykissangel.  I am still on the first Season and look forward to every episode.  Highly recommend it to all Catholics that are still practicing one way or another.",1389225600,,508,4.8604651162790695

1365513,5,B00004WG4H,Came upon these episodes by what Prime has to offer. I started watching them and am now hooked on this show.  Wish there were more of this type of entertainment on tv.

1365514,5,B00004WG4H,"Saw this show very irregularly over the years. So happy to be able to watch it from start to finish. Lovely setting and great, quirky characters.

1365540,5,B00004WG4H,"This series has it all:  funny and sad.  Makes you think about what good the church can do, easier in a small town like this one.  All of the characters are flushed out and has many story lines to follow.  Only thing I would add for American viewers is closed captioning to enable viewers to catch every word due to the accents.  Very, very good series.  Was sorry when it was over.",1387238400,,382,4.236111111111111

He seems full aware of the Catholic Church's ways of the past, but realizes that you can't keep them up in the modern world. Therefore he bring some new blood and ways into the community, which of course doesn't go well with Father Mac.

1365556,5,B00004WG4H,The acting was superb.  I am catholic and this showed how hard it would be for the clergy to adhere to their vows.  My heart went out to the priests.,1385683200,,149,3.933333333333333
1365557,5,B00004WG4H,The first couple of episodes were a bit slow and the visual quality was poor.  However after the 3rd episode I was hooked - The visual quality was sharp and I grew attached an odd assortment of Irish characters who are a combination of endearing and charming.  The stories focus on the denizens of a small Irish town called Ballykissangel - their trials and resolutions often facilitated by the local priest.  A refreshing change from the violence and brutality of so many films these days.,1385683200,,490,4.741176470588235
1365558,5,B00004WG4H,I nice light hearted saga that I watch before bedtime - a prefect way to the day.  I love it and will miss the characters when I finish the last episode.,1385683200,,153,3.935483870967742

1365564,3,B00004WG4H,"The first three seasons (or as the Brits say, series) were excellent.  After that the show loses its center and drifts from fun to a soap opera, with dreary characters.",1384473600,2,168,4.6

1365566,4,B00004WG4H,The storyline is good.  The problems surround the priest and the priest's superiors and how they cope with their parishioners. Many strong-willed people in the parish with varying levels of piety.  The undercurrent storyline is how the young handsome priest manages to control his attraction for a pretty young woman who he sees much too often.,1384387200,,344,5.125
1365567,5,B00004WG4H,"An outstanding performances, great acting, very interesting characters and stories.  Action take place in a contemporary small village of Ireland.

1365572,5,B00004WG4H,"I missed this when it was on PBS in the nineties and wished I had seen it. This is a wonderful, funny, heartwarming series. Father Peter is great. Quigley is so money grubbing you can't help liking him. Donal and Liam....too funny. Assumpta, Naimvh, Siobhan, Brendan, Padraig, Eammon, Ambrose and Father Mac are all wonderfully acted. Truly outstanding. Highly recommend everyone to visit Ballykissangel, Ireland for a rare treat.",1383436800,,430,5.246376811594203
1365573,3,B00004WG4H,"Had this show ended after Season 3, I would have given it perhaps five stars, certainly four, but, alas, it did not. What started as a delightful, funny, quirky little show about rural Ireland, the characters who live there, and the somewhat bewildered outsider who takes up residence there, turned eventually into shallow soap opera. Some of the new lead characters in Seasons 4 and 5 were actually quite interesting and were well-played, but the phony universe they were forced to inhabit was unworthy of them. I am now trudging my way through Season 6 with little enthusiasm.

This show originally aired in the UK in the 1990's, nearly twenty years ago, but it was unknown to me until I discovered it on Amazon Prime (via Roku) this summer. I liked that I couldn't really tell where this show was going - that is, until I started reading the episode descriptions that appeared onscreen. I soon found many were not just brief teasers. I was startled - and angered - by the plot revelations they contained. Something shocking happens in Season 3 - if you've watched the show, you know what I mean - and it is explicitly referred to in an episode description. I learned to look away and quickly press the Play button when the episode screen was displayed. I urge anyone who has not seen this show to do the same.

And I urge Amazon to get rid of whoever was responsible for these spoiler-ridden synopses.",1383091200,2,1404,4.634538152610442

1365576,4,B00004WG4H,"This show can be humorous, serious and poignant.  Some may find it a bit slow-moving but you will come to love the citizens of Ballykissangel if you can just slow down a bit.",1382918400,,174,4.2727272727272725

1365585,5,B00004WG4H,"Have been looking for this series for a while. First saw some episodes on pbs but they stopped showing it. It is funny and sweet at the same time and if you have dealt with priests who put their careers before their flok's well being as well as those who oppose them, then the series will resonate with you",1381449600,,306,4.203389830508475

The only reason I did not give it a 5 is that I do not believe the ensemble cast is as good as in other BBC shows - Vicar of Dibley and Hamish are both outstanding examples of that.

The mutiple characters and their intermingling story plots has made it one enjoyable watch. Each episode has me coming back for more of its humor, slapstick, and even serious dilemas.

With every show you learned more about the 'whys' that contributed to each characters actions, attitudes and story. Redeeming qualities came out in unexpected ways and times. But after the end of season 3, I had no heart to watch further.

If it wasn't for that I'd watched through to the end. The last three seasons may be just as good but the story line was ended and my favorite characters were gone. This happens on long run shows i guess.",1377216000,,515,4.4787234042553195

The characters are quirky, insightful and interesting. You can't help but like them all.  In today's television world where sex, extreme violence and superficial characters are the norm, it's refreshing to watch a series that didn't have to rely on those things to be successful.  The writing and character development will keep you watching and watching through all 56 episodes.  I'd watch more programming like this in a heartbeat if the studios would ever create shows that didn't revolve around murder or casual sex, or portray families whereby the adult characters are written as fools and the children as geniuses.",1373587200,,767,5.153225806451613

1365659,5,B00004WG4H,"I have watched and re-watched all six seasons of this show over the years, and although all of them are worth watching, I must say that I prefer the chemistry in the first 3 seasons best.

This show frequently wrestled with very real societal issues (problems in Ireland but also in the rest of the world: alcoholism, religion and its unfortunate ties to nepotism, teenage pregnancy, gambling, and even divorce, to name just a few). It usually did so with incredible grace, ultimately neither veering to the extremist ""Euro"" perspective nor to the ultraconservative right. Such issues typically have a very bittersweet vein, which adds great depth to the characters as well as the plots, but simultaneously feels ""natural"" rather than patronizing. This show was made during a time of big shifts and uncertainties in Ireland (many of the topics are still debated today and do not have a conclusive answer or a unified public opinion). Yet the overall focus of the show somehow tended towards the simple fact that life is complicated and people have their reasons for contradictions and compromises. I think this show puts some real dignity into the worldwide image of Ireland, and it's all the better that it doesn't gloss over strife nor make everyone look like IRA thugs. These are salt-of-the-earth people in a beautiful little town who are not oblivious to the outside world and simply prefer to stay in their happy little corner.

The character of Assumpta is a particularly interesting role because her reservations about Catholicism are still considered novel for Ireland. She isn't atheistic per se, and neither does she force people to think her way, but she rails against priests at every possible chance because she is jaded by what she considers to be pointless dogma and empty ritualism (whether or not it actually *is* pointless is somewhat left to the viewers in the end). Yet she is often on the giving or receiving end of an important lesson, and a tight friendship quickly develops between Assumpta and Father Clifford exactly because of their polar opposite opinions.

Father Clifford is himself a good character, because although he is a priest and is serious about his vocation, he sometimes struggles when common sense or a local custom clashes with strict ecumenical rules. His frequent arguments with Father Mac (who is, curiously, stricter in his beliefs but also more willing to look the other way on key problems) give good friction to the show's feel, but they also highlight yet another important issue: fractures among the clergy. Sometimes these fights are due to very big events and sometimes annoyingly tiny ones.

Someone compared this show to ""Northern Exposure,"" but I don't completely agree. ""Northern Exposure"" got downright whiny sometimes, whereas this show has a more organic turn of events. ""Ballykissangel"" is also just gentler in its humor and plot twists - for example, biting cynicism is rare in this show, as are ""default agenda"" cliches (relatively speaking). Furthermore, this is a show safe enough for the whole family (or ""tweeners"" at any rate), and ""Northern Exposure"" often wasn't. However, this show *does* also appreciate quirky hijinks (courtesy of hubristic entrepreneur Brian Quigley and his own personal pair of absentminded dogsbodies, Liam and Donal) and uses them to the same effect.

Even if you don't have the ""British Invasion"" TV bug, this show is worth considering. Those who are sick of soap operas or stuffy serials will be glad to find this spunky offshoot, which does have underlying plot developments but is easy to track and often resolves in just one or two episodes.",1373414400,,3641,5.041528239202658

If you have not watched this series for fear of it being ""religious"" fear not! There is faith involved (obviously Father Peter is a Priest),but I do not find it over the top, in your face or overwhelming at all.

I have been watching at least one episode a night on my Kindle while my husband watches the news.  I cannot believe I never watched this show before!",1367366400,,696,4.234848484848484

1365729,4,B00004WG4H,"I approached the series with some skepticism. Would the humor be at the expense of irreverence for the clergy? A similar series,
The Vicar of Dibley, focused on the vicar (Dawn French) and her flock using double entendres and even slap-stick but maintained respect and affection for the ecumenical office. Would Ballykissangel follow this track or veer into questionable grounds?
The first series laid my concerns aside and provided many laughs, some soul-searching and vast entertainment.
The young priest is very human, often innocent, and devoted to the village he is serving.  The village inhabitants, with their oddities and peculiarities,  continue in their day-to-day lives with the core beliefs of religion present as one of the many facets of existence.
Easy viewing, smile to guffaw humor and entertaining.",1365811200,,816,5.3671875

I agree somewhat with others about the similarities to Northern Exposure. However, that is one of my favorite series EVER and BallyK doesn't quite fit that standard. Still a fun and pleasing series of misadventures and human successes and failures.",1365033600,,384,5.015625

I am watching the series for the second time now and loving it just as much again. The only disappointment came from the seasons after this first one. The characters are not nearly as endearing as in season one. I wish they had continued on with Father Peter's life into the following seasons.,1364688000,,414,4.533333333333333

1365751,5,B00004WG4H,"I love this show.  The priest is torn in so many different directions.

He fell out of love with a girl and moved worlds away to be a priest.  Caution:  Another woman is going to steal his heart but he hasn't put all of that together yet.

He gets caught up in the village politics and usually shows great finesse in getting all to cooperate.  Just stellar.

I can't wait to get back to it.  The actor who plays the priest can say so much with expressions of his face.  He doesn't have to say anything.  It is a hoot.",1363564800,,517,4.08

I would recommend Ballykissangel head and shoulders above the competition.

My only question is....at the end of season 1 Father is getting ready to leave Ballykissangel and at the beginning of season 2 he's still there!  I'm glad because it wouldn't be any good without him but what why did he stay?  Nothing was mentioned at the beginning of season 2 about it.

I am planning a trip to Ireland and wanted to go to the town where Ballykissangel was filmed, so I bought the DVD to watch it once again and refresh my memory.  This is the story of a small Irish town who gets a new Priest.  There is a lot of sexual tension between the Priest and the owner of the local pub so are falling for each other when, of course, they are unable to do anything about it.  The local characters are facsinating.  It is worth watching again and again.",1361145600,,518,4.089108910891089

It offers a relaxing hour of viewing, frequent smiles, and only rarely brings the viewer to tears.

And it is all these things and much, much more.
  One of the things that may turn off religious sceptics, critics and others who have, at best, a jaundiced view of religion and particularly Roman Catholicism is the central character of Peter Clifford, a Catholic priest from England newly arrived in the bucolic Irish village of Ballykissangel (an anglicized spelling of its Gaelic name).  To allow one's misgivings about such matters to deter one from watching this series would be a mistake.  From the start the church's flaws and Clifford himself are challenged by the village's publican (bar owner), Assumpta Fitzgerald.
  All of the show's characters are richly portrayed and never fall into the stale predictability of other TV dramas.  For me, this series has the same compelling force of Upstairs, Downstairs, Foyle's War, and I, Claudius.

1365802,4,B00004WG4H,"This drama set in a small town in Ireland is less significant for its substance than for the days-gone-by nostalgia feel of it. It is a wonderfully simple program; a sort of Andy Griffith Show foundation enlivened by modernity. We see an attractive barkeep who has vague qualms with the religion into which she was born begin to respect the new priest in town as he jockeys with his older generational priest-supervisor. Through this prism we can see what we want of Ireland's more recent development. The program encourages us to take sides between the traditionalist (sometimes selfish) church of the past, and a more lively (but less absolute) version of it, as evinced by this young priest from afar who stirs up this town a bit. It's not at all a religious program, mind you; just an overly unrepresentative portrayal of idyllic Ireland in which you cannot fail to include religion. Full disclosure: I like this show, but I also have Irish blood. I say this because this really is a program which appeals to a particular sort of individual; to one who either has Irish blood and/or for those whom Ireland has some draw. Ireland has an inherent appeal to many such people from around the world. Even if you have never visited it, can you not right now visualize vast green fields and rolling hills bordered by stone walls, snugly cozy pubs filled with glasses of Guinness raised, and smiling faces? Of course, I'm exaggerating here, but you must grant that Ireland is a far more attractive place than many others, at least in a theoretical quality-of-life sort of way. It's thought of as the sort of place where stress is not as prevalent as where one finds oneself; having a bygone character to it (notwithstanding this not to be as true in actuality, but like in many other things, imagination often persists over reality). If I am making any sense to you with this, Ballykissangel may be to your liking. If you are familiar with Garrison Keillor's pubic radio show, ""A Prairie Home Companion"" (Saturdays 6pm across the USA), Ballykissangel is to Ireland what the fictional town of ""Lake Woebegone"" is to the American heartland. I recommend both. Both evince what a part of us long for (if you are a nostalgic sort of person, regardless of your age--even a 25 year old can long for previous eras) and even though such may not suit us, it does make us inclined to enjoy programs like ""A Prairie Home Companion"" and ""Ballykissangel"". I hope this review of sorts was of use to you. Cheers! P.S. If you do give this program a try and find it to your liking I'd like to let you know that the ""set"" of Ballykissangel isn't one at all; but rather is an one-street town (called Avoca) that was occasionally commandeered for filming so that you can actually travel to it! To have a drink in its pub, visit its church and so on is a somewhat surreal experience; as you walk into ""the program"", so to speak, that you have enjoyably watched from afar. Now, where else can you do something like that! Cheers!",1308182400,5,3001,4.632270168855535

Naturally, the main characters are the young priest and the publican, a fiery woman who is hostile to religion. Despite her antagonism toward his faith, the publican always seems to end up helping out the priest. Although these two characters take center stage in the early going, a variety of other townspeople -- each with quirky characteristics of his or her own -- gradually emerge with their own stories. Eventually, it becomes clear that the real star is Ballykissangel itself -- a little town that one wishes time hadn't forgotten.",1157155200,4,702,4.907563025210084

1365811,5,B00004WG4H,"In a show which appears to abound with possible anomalies, unexpectedly comes the most profound commonsense and, with it, immense enjoyment.

In a most unlikely Irish village, live a most unlikely group of villagers. A group which includes the good, the bad, and the rather stupid. Overseer, at the top of the hierarchy, is a non too pleasant, but feared, senior Priest. The foregoing would hardly make an aceptable show - let alone a great one. Ballykissangel is made great, truly great, by the  inclusion to the above characters of a raw English born Priest, an attractive but atheist female Publican, a conscientious but fallible Policeman, a caring Schoolmaster and, lastly but crucially, a lovable rogue of a Businessman.

It would be unfair to pick any one actor as superior. The main characters are superbly played by the cast, while the 'lesser lights' are no less deserving of high praise.

Ballykissangel is a 'Fairy Tale', in that good invariably triumphs over evil but, the convoluted stories which evolve from the behaviour of the residents of this small community are suspenseful and highly entertaining. The writing, like the acting, is first rate.

This must be one of the most viewable of all the Drama/Comedies ever produced. One wishes one could live in Ballykissangel!",1152316800,6,1288,5.056603773584905
1365812,5,B00004WG4H,"This is a series sui generis--a thing unto itself (though it can be compared and contrasted to many others). I am virtually certain that the creator, who must certainly have a strong say in how all episodes are written because of their fluid continuity, watched a lot of All Creatures Great and Small. Although there is far more star quality in that great series (Robert Hardy as a inimitable,fantastic Siegfried) and it is more tightly focused on just three or four characters (the vets plus Ellen), All Creatures... was such a hit because again and again and again it goes for the heart, not fulsomely or over-sentimentally, but with real, live, accessible, and beautifully drawn characters.

BallyK shares this warmth and genuine humanity without sacrificing the basics of the ""real world"" and, though it is not mentioned enough, I think many people are happy to see a priest portrayed positively, with faults but much more with lots of decency and a sense of love and fairness. Stephen Tompkinson, at least in the first two years of episodes, is nothing short of spectacular as the lead character. Again in contrast with the ""star"" of All Creatures...Robert Hardy, his character has some charisma but it's his basic love for and acts of love for others that glues this series together.

Many charactes play major roles, but making a Catholic priest the positive protagonist is a stroke of brilliance, rarely equalled in the annals of art. The creator almost certainly didn't expect the reaction this series has received all over the world. (It has a universal appeal with universal plots and themes, set in Ireland: it's not just for those who are Irish or like the Irish--that is totally off-base).

The trials and tribulations and humorous situations, most of them not earth-shattering, that make up this series (I've seen years one and two) connect with the concerns and lives of ordinary people who can identify with aspects of most of the characters. There is a nasty character or two that appear in a few of the episodes, but their ""evil"", while real, doesn't dominate, but dissolves into the overall good natured quality of this series.

And that's the key: the characters and conflicts in BAllyK are genuine; there isn't the manufactured angst, turbo-charged hyperactivity, and turmoil that characterizes most serieses.

In the U.S., the Sopranos is top dog among serieses of this kind and I too have enjoyed it to a degree. But is Tony Soprano the Everyman that could give this series timeless appeal--NO. I do believe, however, that Father Clifford, in crucial combination with the other characters, is an Everyman that will give this series timeless apppeal--again much like All Creatures...

In fifty years, more people may watch the Sopranos, but the percentage of people that watch BAllyK and fall in love with this very slightly off-beat community with will be much higher than those who both watch and really love The Sopranos. Anyway this is a great series, at least years one and two (there is great conflict about seasons 3 and 4, which I have not seen).

Older viewers who grew up watching and liking the Andy Griffith Show, Father Knows Best, Leave it to Beaver, My Three Sons et al will like this series--probably not seein the resemblances, which are many. But BallyK is not recycled old American t.v. It makes its own statment; has its own warmth and charm; and creates its own compelling, if low-key, reality.  See the first two seasons at least. You will be a better person for it.",1143417600,10,3511,4.889075630252101

I only watched the first two seasons. I liked Monarch of the Glen (2000-2005) better, but I've never seen the final season of that show either. The scenery is great, but the most memorable thing about Balleykissangel that I remember is the episode where a young Lena Headey chases after the main character, but he's already married to God. It was great to see Headey acting in a small role before she became rich and famous.

If you're looking for good stuff to watch consider miniseries like The Astronauts Wives Club (2015), Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Frank Herberts Children of Dune (2003), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Manhattan (2014-2015), Return to Lonesome Dove (1993), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000), which are all terrific because they have clear beginnings that establish an objective, then strong middles and conclusive endings where the goal is achieved, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), Granite Flats (2013-2015), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), The Prisoner (1967-1968), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish.
