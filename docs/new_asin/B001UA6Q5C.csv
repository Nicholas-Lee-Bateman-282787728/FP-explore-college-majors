When it comes to movies about the railroad or railfanning Pentrex is widely considered the measuring stick. So when I bought this DVD I knew I there would be good production quality behind it. This DVD focuses on the E-units on Chicago's racetrack and captures some great footage from track side and inside the cab. Some history is discussed and the smooth narration does not distract from your viewing pleasure. The only negative about this DVD was a quick section of narration audio was a bit off for all of 5 seconds but then was right on point again in the next scene. The subject is a bit dry but the sights are amazing. Do your research as the price on this DVD seems to fluctuate.",1512172800,,817,4.557823129251701
