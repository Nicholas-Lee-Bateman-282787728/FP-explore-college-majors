1633585,5,B00005NG0D,"I agree completely with all of the reviewers that this is indeed the best recording of ""King Lear"", not only because James Earl Jones is to my mind the definitive Lear (and because this cast and production magnify and clarify everything there is to be seen and heard in this play), but also because it is a recording of a live performance in a theater, rather than a movie or TV-studio taping.  What a difference this makes!  Movie versions are always rescripted, truncated and sometimes oddly cast to make a play more saleable.  (Orson Welles' ""Othello"" and ""Macbeth"" are gorgeous pieces of cinema, but they are much more Welles than Will.)  The productions of the 1980s BBC series stick pretty close to the text and happily have made the entire Shakespeare canon available for home viewing.  But their visual and aural effect is claustrophobic, and the colors are fading.  It was a wonderful change for me to experience the sweep and power of Papp's ""King Lear"" DVD, proving that, in the end, the best venue for a Shakespeare play is the one it was written for:  the stage.  Fortunately for those of us who could not be at Central Park's Delacorte Theater in the summer of 1974, Joseph Papp had the historical sense to take on the hassle and expense of preserving this marvelous production on videotape.  Would that there were enough of a market out there to encourage more theater angels to do the same!",1171756800,9,1406,4.682926829268292
1633586,5,B00005NG0D,"""Lear"" is not an easy play to watch by any standard, or in any medium.  Anyone who has ever wished that he or she had more money or property to leave to his or her children would do well to watch this one.  Poor families get along better, believe me.

In a nutshell: An old king creates the worst living trust plan of all time (this was before estate planning attorneys).  In a fit of fatigued grandiosity, he divests himself of his kingdom, disinherits his loyal daughter and entrusts himself to the care of his two greedy, grasping daughters.  It's all downhill from there, with a ""B"" plot which also follows the theme of fillial vs. unfilial adult children.  At the end, of course, there is a pile of bodies and a few stunned survivors.

What makes this Lear so special is the cast and the audience.  It was filmed in front of a live New York audience, and so you can hear the audience laughing at the jokes and applauding a particuarly good speech.  This gives the production a sense of immediacy.

In some ways, this production is sort of like watching an all-star baseball game - the players are so good, and it's a real treat to watch them.  A very young and sexy Raoul Julia plays Edmund - the seductive bad guy, and you can really see how  Lear's two wicked daughters would get into a cat fight over him.  And as Edmund's good half-brother Edgar, Rene Auberjonois is wonderful.  Edgar has to go from naif to feigned insanity to righteous warrior - quite a character arc, and Auberjonois does a fabulous job.

An unexpected favorite, though, is an actor I've never seen in anything else - Douglass Watson as the Earl of Kent.  Kent is a loyal supporter of the King who risks death to follow Lear through all his trials and tribulations.  I've always loved Kent for his loyalty - heck, I'd marry him if he wasn't fictional.  This actor brings a tremendous amount of spirit and pepper to the part - I think it's the best Kent I've ever seen.

The female roles are generally quite well acted as well, although the actress who plays Regan (I think) has kind of an annoying squeaky voice - it sounds like she's swallowed helium.  Too bad, as she's good in all other ways.

And what can you say about James Earl Jones?  There isn't much I can add to the other reviews except to say that I would be very interested to see him do another production of this same play now, thirty years later.  This Lear is quite physical, storming around the stage, frustrated by his own weakness - he can't even throw a chair in a fit of rage without falling down, but that doesn't stop him from trying. And Jones' voice is Jones' voice - is there anyone who wouldn't recognize his deep and mellow tones, even if only as Darth Vader? It is a wonderful treat to be able to hear Jones act this role. He brings a gravitas to the part which is necessary for it to be truly tragic.  But then James Earl Jones can bring gravitas to a toilet paper commercial, that's why he's The Man.

All in all, of the many Lears I have endured, this is the strongest, and I wish there were more than five stars available.",1146096000,17,3085,4.36077057793345
1633587,1,B00005NG0D,"This Movie gave me an actual reason to like shakespears writing and plays.  There was superb acting by all the actor and actresses and mainly Mr. James Earl Jones.  Just watching his anger and how it progressed through the play just gave a new meaning to acting, the way he used his facial expressions and when his saliva came pouring out of his mouth just showed how hard he worked to perfect his perfromance. As for the Director he could not have got a better cast. This is why i gave this mvie FOUR STARS",1132444800,6,507,4.326315789473684
1633588,5,B00005NG0D,"With almost no props, no set, and few frills, this incredible piece of art gives one of the most breathtaking portrayals of Shakespeare-in-the-raw ever recorded.  It is one of the great fortunes of our day that someone had the foresight to preserve this work for posterity.",1125532800,7,273,4.934782608695652
1633589,4,B00005NG0D,"Words cannot describe my love for this production of King Lear. This is definitely the greatest live taping of a Shakespeare play I've ever seen. Most of the actors were simply amazing. Had I been at that performance that night, I would have given a a standing ovation. James Earl Jones was phenomenal. He brought a new King Lear to the stage. I was thrilled as he cursed his daughters and sons in law as violent thunder symbolically rumbled over the actors' heads. Even the audience was thrilled. They applauded when he exited. The show had more jokes than I thought. I thought that the Fool brought the only jokes to the show. My favorite funny part was when Edmund said, ""I am rough and lecherous"", made an offensive sign, and a farting noise. It was so funny. Raul Julia was simply amazing as Edmund. He portrayed Edmund with such perfection. Tom Aldredge was great as the Fool. When I first heard him talk, I realized, ""Oh, my God. Is that the Narrator from Into the Woods?"" I was truly shocked. The woman who played Goneril was very sexy indeed. I had to take off a star for a few reasons.
1. The woman who played Regan overacted.
2. Cordelia was wearing boots similar to Go-go boots in one of her scenes (by the way, she was good too.)
3. The guy who played the doctor had an afro and his acting wasn't good.
These two touches of the 70s were somewhat out of place in a Shakespeare play. Those are minor reasons why I gave this DVD four stars. I think that if you want to see a great play on video or DVD, the Broadway Theatre Archive is the place to go. King Lear rules. Shakespeare rules. James Earl Jones rules.",1045872000,10,1621,4.353135313531353
1633590,5,B00005NG0D,"While attending High School in Michigan, I took a 9 week course in Shakespeare. Monday through Friday, for an hour, I would sit and study the words of the man often referred to as the greatest single writer that ever used the English language. In this class, we were exposed to both audio and video productions of various plays.
After 4 weeks, I became fully convinced that anyone that said that they read or attended Shakespeare for entertainment purposes was either a liar or severely mentally unbalanced.
Then I was shown this production, and my mind expanded.
The production was taped from a Shakespeare in the Park festival, live. There are points during the production when it becomes apparent, yes it is live. It is also vital. It lives, it breathes, it is wildly passionate and elegent and bold and gentle, often within the space of one line to another.
The cast is nothing short of astonishing. Rosalind Cash, Raul Julia, Paul Sorvino and Rene Auberjonois are stunning. These four actors, in and of themselves, make this particular performance a (what is now the hyped phrase) Must See.
What makes it a Must Own is James Earl Jones.
Mr. Jones is, IMHO, possibly the single greatest actor living today. He is also IMHO the finest voice in the industry, and has been from the time I became aware that this production existed.
His Lear is a vain man, a proud man, and a man that is falling apart before our very eyes. He is indeed King, and a king that has brought himself low. Kingship does not imply wisdom.
Any flaws in this production only remind us that Shakespeare was once performed live in the presence of those who would hoot and toss things at the actors if the audience was not happy with what they were seeing.
Superb!",1021507200,19,1736,4.621359223300971
1633591,5,B00005NG0D,"This live performance of The Public Theater's 1974 production of ""King Lear"" is refreshingly straight-forward and offers abundant proof that the play -- one of Shakespeare's very greatest -- cries out to be acted, not just read.  By any standard, the acting (with a few surprising exceptions) is well above average; compared to more recent Shakespeare productions at The Public Theater, the acting is astonishingly fine.
James Earl Jones gives a performance of awesome power and ferocity -- perhaps the greatest of his career.  The sophistication and subtlety of his reading may surprise audiences unfamiliar with his work prior to his ubiquitous telephone company commercials.  For the rest of us, this superb performance of a great artist at the height of his powers is cause for celebration, even as it is cause for sorrow:  for here, too, is a stinging reminder of the scarcity of suitable roles for actors of Mr. Jones' refinement, technical mastery and colossal intensity.  Are there no authors besides Shakespeare worthy of this extraordinary actor?
Of course, no one but a churl would begrudge Mr. Jones the comfort and pleasure his commercial success apparently brings him -- long may he prosper!  Then again, who but a churl could fail to grieve at the waste of an artistic life of such immensity and grandeur?",1001980800,36,1320,5.059907834101383
7946979,5,B00005NG0D,"The best version of this play I've seen. James Earl Jones is better than I expected, and I expected a lot. I was a bit disappointed in the women, but most of the cast was similarly fine. Raul Julia was wonderful.",1422835200,,212,4.195121951219512

7946982,5,B00005NG0D,"Outstanding.  This production brought the play alive for me in a way that no other film managed to do.  The energy and enthusiasm of the crowd is certainly a big part of it; but the other part is the way JEJ and company manage to bring out the nuances of humor and compassion in this play, adding warmth and humanity to what is a terribly bleak and difficult work. Jones plays Lear's breakdown not so much as a descent into madness than as a regression into a vulnerable and childlike state--an approach which is all the more powerful in its subtlety.  Raul Julia and Rene Auberjonois are also impressive and entertaining.",1381363200,,622,4.585585585585585

7946984,5,B00005NG0D,"This is a fantastic stage-recording of Lear.  It stays very true to the original text (as close as could be asked for from a live performance) and is entertaining to watch.  For anyone who is somewhat hesitant when it comes to Shakespeare, this version of Lear is a good starting point - the story is fairly straight forward and this staging helps add to understanding of the plot.  Highly, highly recommend.",1289779200,,408,4.71830985915493
7946985,5,B00005NG0D,"This is a brilliant production of ""King Lear"" with powerful performances by James Earl Jones as Lear, Raul Julia as Edmund and Ren Auberjonois as Edgar. Quite often filmed theatre is worse than dull but this is not true in this case at all. This film is vibrant, gripping, keeping your attention from the first minute to the last. I have seen many ""Lears"" and this is one of the best. I highly recommend it.",1265328000,,407,4.44

James Earl Jones plumbed the depths of this role;  Rene Auberjonois was masterful.  Raul Julia was just so evil and insidious.  The sisters and other roles were fine.  Only Paul Sorvino was miscast.  This is THE Lear to have, to watch and to learn.",1239494400,3,408,4.728571428571429
7946987,5,B00005NG0D,"James Earl Jones does an OUTSTANDING job as King Lear at one point even foaming at the mouth in his raving madness! Raul Julia, Rahay Shamay Rabah Amayn, is almost as good while he is being very very bad as Edmund. The play itself is utter Genius, second in plays only to Hamlet, and this performance with its live character in Central Park, captures an air of excitement that can only be captured on very very special occassions. DO NOT miss this one.",1196208000,2,452,4.457831325301205

While the supporting cast is never less than adequate, James Earl Jones is by himself one titanic show. He's able to do something rarely seen, excel in all aspects of this most demanding of roles. Pride, bluster, anger, genuine rage, madness, growing self knowledge, and then, at last, tenderness, even delicacy - all of these are convincingly and movingly played by this large, majestic actor. He's giving what add up, in fact, to acting lessons as he plays this part so skillfully.",1176249600,4,581,4.878787878787879
