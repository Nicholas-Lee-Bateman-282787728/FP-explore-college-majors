8325491,1,B000NIAMQQ,"We ordered a dvd from this place, and tried it on 3 dvd players. It played nothing, so we returned it and a week and 1/2 later we got another one that was similiar in nature, same problem. We have always had good luck ordering off Amazon, this is the first problem we have had. I don't recomend this shop.",1275955200,,305,4.1
