This movie just wouldn't work if the actors didn't play the characters. Im so happy Ashley Tisdale is in it. She is gorgeous and really talented. I own the encore edition but who cares? If they re-release it in the future, you can bet im gonna get it!!",1158105600,,363,4.432835820895522
3711896,5,B001N6FPRS,"I have 2 Copys of the Encore Version.  Huge Disney fan, I support most of the cast of the film, but Love Ashley Tisdale!  I was going to just for fun, buy 3 copys of the Encore DVD.  Although I felt it was poorly done, and not having a lot of Content along with Extra materals that it could have.

Now this is Release, I have good hopes.  I feel the Encore is a ""treat"" and this next one is the quote and unquote ""The main meal"" or ""main deal"".  With All The content and bonus materal.  Just in time for a great Xmas gift for your HSM fans, Disney fans, Supportors to the cast, or whatever.  I already plan on buying 2 or 3 copys of it, :).

I just hope to anything that Disney does a 10/10 job with High School Musical 2 and 3.  Disney isn't a name that likes to release it's DComs on DVD a lot, so we should be happy that they release certains things.",1157760000,5,853,3.935672514619883

3711924,5,B001N6FPRS,"High School Musical has been one of the most successful Disney concepts/franchises in years. What began as a Disney Channel TV show spawned two sequels, one of which enjoyed a run in theaters. This latest edition of the original High School Musical is now in 1080p High Definition (although the extras are in standard def with some video combing). The picture is crystal clear and practically leaps off the screen; the sound mix is amazing as well, making full use of all speakers. Sound effects will make you think that people are in the room with you. The hot musical numbers sound even better in 5.1 uncompressed.

In a nutshell, the story is about Troy (Zac Efron) & Gabriella (Vanessa Hudgens), two high school students who meet at a New Year's Eve party and are thrown together when the DJ chooses them to do a karaoke duet. Naturally, they make beautiful music together (""Start of Something New""). Turns out they go to the same High School (think updated version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grease-Rockin-Rydell-Edition/dp/B001AXU1CS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grease: Rockin Rydell Edition</a>), although true love does come with a few bumps along the way. Troy is a high school jock (basketball) and singing in the school musical with Gabriella is definitely uncool and against what Troy's dad (who happens to be the coach) has planned for him. Gabriella's new best friend, Taylor (Monique Coleman) is the head of the Science Club, and is determined to keep Gabriella away from the dumb jock crowd. Together with Troy's best friend Chad (Corbin Bleu) they must figure out a way to keep Gabriella and Troy apart. Add a jealous diva to the mix, Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale), and who knows how things will turn out. Well, actually, it`s not too difficult to figure this plot out. The bumps along the way are all good clean fun and the chemistry between the cast is superb. The choreography and songs are the film's fantastic bonus, including ""Get'cha Head In The Game"" is performed in the high school gym by the basketball team, a lovely ballad duet for Troy & Gabriella (""What I've Been Looking For""), and the blowout finale ""We're All In This Together"" showcases the entire cast. Some of the lip-synching is a little off at times; apparently in the first installment not everyone did their own singing. Still, it doesn't detract from the enjoyment. This is a fun-filled throwback to the old MGM musicals where you can sit back and forget your cares and woes a few hours and pick up a few hummable tunes along the way.

Specs: Video is 1080p High definition, 1.78:1 ratio (bonus material is 480i Standard Def and in full-screen not widescreen ratio) * Audio is English 5.1 Uncompressed (48 kHz/24-bit) with English, French, and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital (bonus material is English 5.1 or 2.0 Dolby Digital); subtitles are in English SDH, French, and Spanish for both.

3711925,5,B001N6FPRS,"High School Musical is one of the Disney productions you don't have high expectations for. How good can something made for cable be? But it surprises in a big way.

This is a movie about teens trying to find their own identities while feeling the pressure to conform to their own social groups. There's clean romance, humor, and the songs are surprisingly good. It does what every good musical should do: make you tap your toes and want to join in the singing and dancing.

And this is where the extras come in. The Remix version comes with a sing-along option that lets you sing along to all the songs, with the words lighting up as they're supposed to be sung, karaoke style. The second DVD includes a dance lesson for two of the dances in the movie. These dances are pretty hard, but it can be fun to try.

I really didn't think I would like this movie, thought it would be for tweens only. But I was delighted to discover I was wrong. This is a delightful movie to enjoy, sing along with, and dance to with your tween, and the lesson of being true to yourself is such a good one for kids who often feel pressured to fit in with their friends.",1212537600,,1146,4.296296296296297
3711926,1,B001N6FPRS,"Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter truly shined in this film, I highly doubt Oscars are too far out of the questi-...

Oh wait. Nevermind. I though this was the Sweeney Todd page. Nevermind this film sucks the big one! Need I say more! It sucks so much I can't even give it a full review.",1211068800,2,290,4.178571428571429
3711927,5,B001N6FPRS,"This is a fun, make you smile, type of movie.  I'll leave this short as so many other people have described the movie greatly.  My husband and I both enjoy this.  It's great to watch and fun to just put the movie on and listen to the music while you work.",1196121600,,255,3.9607843137254903
3711928,5,B001N6FPRS,i watched the 2nd movie like a month ago or whenever it was. and loved it. and i finally own the first one. and i also pre-ordered the second one. can't wait to get that one. will definitely be watching this one again.,1190505600,,218,4.093023255813954
3711929,2,B001N6FPRS,"I know, this is a very popular movie and the music is OK.  But the story is stridently insipid:  winners win because that's what winners do, and losers lose because there's something wrong with anyone who's not a winner...and don't talk to me about underdogs. Despite the best efforts of its heroically perky cast, the film is nearly humorless.  It was suggested that we stage this at our high school, but I've black-balled it.",1189036800,2,427,4.743243243243243
3711930,4,B001N6FPRS,"I'm all for cheesy high school dramadies where kids break into song for no apparent reason. My favorite movie is Teen Witch. High School Music continues in the same tradition with all the teenage angst you can imagine coupled with singing and dancing. What more could you want? And, this movie doesn't take itself too seriously. It's campy and over the top, and that's what's so great about it. The reason to by the Remix edition of High School Musical is simple: the sing-along version of the movie. Not only do you get to watch a Grease-style teeniebopper musical, but you get to sing along at the same time. Highly recommended.",1188086400,,630,4.684684684684685
3711931,5,B001N6FPRS,Heard about High School Musical and wondering which one to get? My advice would be this one. This isn't really a remix like with an album. It is more like a deluxe or extended edition. You get all the bonus features of the original and over 30 minutes of new features.,1187568000,16,268,4.2745098039215685
3711932,5,B001N6FPRS,"My kids saw this and bugged me for months to buy it when it came out on DVD. I did and they LOVE it. I personally don't get the appeal but I guess you have to be a tweenie or a teen to relate to it. All I know is my kids range from 10 to 17 (this month) and despite their age range, they ALL love this movie. So, my suggestion is if you have kids - of any age over toddler - get this movie, they seem to LOVE it and watch it over and over. I bought the deluxe version just 'cause I know my kids like the extra ""stuff"" on deluxe versions.",1184198400,4,537,3.6379310344827585
3711933,5,B001N6FPRS,"We watched the original dvd version after my children had friends who left it with us. It took six months for us to give their dvd back! So in the end I ""had"" to purchase the dvd for ourselves. I saw the ""remix"" version and thought why not!

It was worth it. My kids dance and sing every song with more passion than the actors. There is an option on this special edition of a sing along version of the movie, but we have never used it. The second disc has numerous features. Although more would have been good. Some came over from the original dvd like the behind the scenes interviews. But there were more, such as the premiere red carpet clip for the dvd release. Learning dance moves to Getta ya head in the game and the main theme ""Wild Cats"". There were also clips of the actors going on trips around the world, promoting the movie.

Although when I first watched it I was thinking (oh great an hour and a half wasted). But it is a great movie which inspires everyone to be happy and it be happy with who you are. The support characters make it for me.

Great ""SQUEAKY CLEAN"" fun for the whole family and a film you are happy to leave your kids in front of.",1183248000,5,1162,4.178571428571429
3711934,5,B001N6FPRS,"My teenage daughter got this for her birthday and watched it 4 times the first two days. My five year old daugther also loves it and thinks Gabriella is so cute.
It's a musical and they sing a lot. The story line is basically that none of the groups associate with each other. (sports jocks and cheerleaders, science geeks, skaters, no body's, and the drama club. This is afterall a Disney movie and you can guess what is gonna happen and basically does but gives you some surprises along the way. By the end it is a happy after all movie and the groups get along and date etc.
To top that there is apparently a high school musical 2 coming out and they have to deal with the drama duo all over again.",1182816000,,701,4.2388059701492535
3711935,5,B001N6FPRS,"I love this movie a lot. It has a lot of great music in it. I love to sing and I'm a great singer. I think this one of the best musicals I ever saw. The music is great. There was only one problem, they made it very clear that they were lip sycing their own recording of the songs they sang. I think you should at least see this movie at least once.",1181520000,,348,3.7162162162162162
3711936,4,B001N6FPRS,"Ok, great appeal for my 8 year old.  Great wholesome viewing reminiscent of my 70's childhood. All thumbs up, except for the fact that anyone over the age of 12 and younger than 80 will get numb.

I must say, as for myself, I never tire of seeing it with them.  I would dare to say it is about as 'wholesome teen movie' I've ever seen.  It actually shows boys and girls being friends and how to be nice to one another - with the exception of the 'testy' Sharpay.  Though there is an attraction between Troy and Gabriella it is portrayed as very innocent and respectful - NO 'sexual stuff'!!  What a wonderful breath of fresh air THAT is!!!  Watch it once & you & your family will be watching it over and over!!!",1174089600,4,646,3.9612403100775193

3711940,5,B001N6FPRS,This DVD has developed quite a following.  Our granddaughter already knew many of the songs before she got it.  She loves it--sings and dances along.,1170720000,,149,4.92
3711941,4,B001N6FPRS,"This movie is great! Some say it's cheesy but NEWS FLASH: most musicals are cheesy! That's what happens when people burst out into perfectly harmonized song and choregraphed dance routines for no apparent reason. If you're gonna watch any musical, you must accept that it will probably cheesy at times.

This version of the DVD is pretty good, especially the Dance Along. I'm a proffessional dancer so I was able to watch that part once or twice and pick it up. But if you have no dance training don't expect it to be that easy...They move much too quickly and do a poor job of explaining the moves. So unless you've got about 2 hours to keep rewinding the Dance-Along section, I wouldn't watch it.

The sing-along reel is a cute addition, but the DVD interviews are not that exciting, unless you're a huge fan I guess.

The only reason I'm giving it 4/5 stars is because of the DVD extras, but the movie itself is great for people of all ages! I'm 18 and not ashamed to say I love this movie and can't wait for the next one!",1170547200,,1025,4.38421052631579

3711946,1,B001N6FPRS,"The gift my daughter was most anticipating from Santa was the High School Musical Remix.  Unfortunately, the DVD we purchased was scatched and skipped.  She was very disappointed as was I for purchasing it.",1168387200,4,206,5.029411764705882
3711947,5,B001N6FPRS,"I've already written about HSM at length elsewhere, so shall limit my remarks to the brand new remix edition.  As everyone knows, the original DVD seemed rushed out, with hardly a bonus feature to be found anywhere on it, except for some sad excuses for music videos.  What we need is a commentary track from director/choreographer Kenny Ortega, and perhaps from Broadway music veteran Alyson Reed, who gives HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL the credibility it has from her years of showmanship and Fosse-like timing.  But Disney is not going to let Ortega reflect on his achievement here, not while he had HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 2 gearing up for production in February and release in July.

So what have we got?  The chapter stops are lame, lame, lame, like some old K-TEL DVD from the early days of technology.  On the other hand, the video transfer is so crisp and clean that some of the CGI work shows its seams right through: never before has the opening shot of the ski lodge or wherever Troy and Gabriella are supposed to be meeting at New Years looked so fakey, obviously something made in the studio.  Oh, but in the long run what does it matter?  We who have watched the show twenty times or more have every one of Zac Efron's adorably tortured grimaces committed to memory and if we shut our eyes we could still see him torn between his loyalty to the East High Wildcats, and to his father's love, versus his newfound desire to sing onstage.  And those of us who took Vanessa Anne Hudgens to our hearts the minute we saw her open up that book at the big kid's party on New Years Eve and sit down resolutely to read it, until the pale watery spotlight fell on her face, and she had to get up and sing karaoke, don't need a lot of chapter stops to tell us that she has the big soulful voice of Mariah Carey combined with the earthy glow of a young Claudia Cardinale.

The new remix of ""Breaking Free,"" however, is just ghastly.  Zac and Vanessa seem to be panting like racehorses in order to keep up with the new count of BPM.  I felt like calling Child Protective Services after seeing them suffer like this!  New footage shows them smiling at each other in the studio--and there's one great shot of Zac admiring his own reflection in the wall to wall CHORUS LINE mirror--but please, Disney, slow down, you didn't need to turn America's favorite power ballad into a disco stomper!  This is the song that voiced all of our longing and yearning to be accepted for our real selves, and created a powerful dialectic between the accepted capitalist hegemony and a restless, nearly unnamable teenage angst: ""You know the world can see us/ In a way that's different than who we are.""  It's an indelible document of rage, persuasion and hope.  Now it just sounds like Alcazar trash with Chipmunks.",1165449600,7,2783,4.536
3711948,4,B001N6FPRS,"I got a kick out of one of the recent reviews that trashes this movie as unrealistic -- the kids are not doing what they need to do to get into college.  Good grief.  Since when is a musical ever realistic??  Especially one that is geared to kids.  Hello??!! It's not supposed to be realistic!  If you expect realism, go elsewhere.  But if you want to have some fun with a great message not-so-subtly woven in, then watch this movie.  Kids love it (mine do along with anyone else I've talked to), and the message is just terrific ~ it's okay to be yourself with all kinds of wild likes, dislikes, hobbies, etc., no matter what anyone else thinks.  I love it!  I can't even begin to say how much better this is than ""Grease,"" the high school musical of my day where the heroine had to give in and become a slut to get what she wanted and be ""happy.""  Relax with your kids, go get some popcorn, and have some fun with the Wildcats kids from ""Highschool Musical.""",1163376000,7,960,4.283333333333333
