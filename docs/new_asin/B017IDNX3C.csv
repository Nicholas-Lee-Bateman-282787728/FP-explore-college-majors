8739411,4,B017IDNX3C,Nothing new or exciting here just kept to add to collection not what I thought it was gonna be like or as explained,1484006400,,115,4.043478260869565
8739412,2,B017IDNX3C,"If you are a major Kiss fan, you have followed interviews and videos of them as nauseum (like me), and likely have a collection of videos, dvd's, VHS tapes, downloaded YouTube videos, etc.  There's really nothing new here for you.
The videos/interviews on this disc are a smattering compilation of things you've seen before, and likely already own.  Not recommended for you unless you are a completist.

However, if you are a newer collector/video enthusiast, there's some good stuff to see - mostly from the reunion tour era.
None of the videos are high-definition or high quality, but if you're a Kiss fan you'll want to see it all.",1472342400,,634,4.798165137614679

8739415,2,B017IDNX3C,"As big of a KISS fan as I am, I was very disappointed by the quality of this dvd.  The video is very low resolution and reminds me of the VHS days.  The audio is about 5/10.  That being said its good to see the original line up.",1463097600,,228,3.7083333333333335
