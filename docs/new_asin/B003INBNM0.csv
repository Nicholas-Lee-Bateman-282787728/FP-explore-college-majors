8397561,4,B003INBNM0,"I found this program interesting and occasionally frustrating.

* Interesting - information about buddhism, the caves of buddhist and the art work in the caves along the silk road - places & stories I knew nothing about.
* Frustrating - mainly because it seems the scientists they interviewed (Korean & Chinese) were done without interpretations. In reading the other review, I don't know if my copy had subtitles, so will replay it again (no subtitles when I watched it). Also - because I was unfamiliar with the area and history, there was not much introduction to what was going on & what had occurred in the excavations in the past.
That said, if you are interested in:  that part of the world - a different area of ancient buddhism - fascinating old buddhist art work - archaology & anthropology (any or all of these) and don't have great expectations, it is a very interesting program.",1329609600,,891,4.741935483870968
8397562,4,B003INBNM0,"This is a documentary on the art that was left behind long ago in the caves on the silk road. The art was religious in nature and most were of Buddha as each generation defined him, as well as of his life. Artists today are still studying and replicating this art. The viewer watches the slog of camels over the desert, the climb or descent into some of the caves and the art, both original and modern replications. It is very interesting, especially since this desert region is not somewhere that I would probably see any other way. A bone to pick: When I turned this on, the English subtitles was already activated which I find distracting so I turned them off. However, the people interviewed who seem to be Korean and Chinese, speak in their language with no translation and no subtitles if you have turned the subtitles off. So your choice seems to be to have subtitles for the whole thing, or have no idea what these experts are saying. Overall, this would be a good choice for teachers of world religions, of ancient art, or of this region, since it would bring this area to life for students.",1276819200,3,1100,4.477611940298507
