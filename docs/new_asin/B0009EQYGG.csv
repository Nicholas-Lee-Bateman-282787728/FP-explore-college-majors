Moreover, the actors are uniformly excellent including those both known (Rita Moreno, James Darren) and unknown (Asher Brauner, Henry Sanders, Michelle Davison). In addition, singer/songwriter Richie Havens both acts in the film (he too is quite good) and sings two very listenable songs on the soundtrack. Also, the film approaches issues of race & social standing in a very mature manner.

After viewing ""The Boss's Son"" I'm anxious to see more of director Bobby Roth's work (which isn't always easy to locate). If you're sitting-on-the-fence about this one, in its gritty, 70s-style realism it reminded me of the wonderful ""Blue Collar""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-Collar-Amazon-com-Exclusive/dp/B0033PSH8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue Collar (Amazon.com Exclusive)</a>, so if you enjoyed that film, you should find this an equally compelling work.",1331164800,,1021,6.24113475177305
8059611,2,B0009EQYGG,"Another one I bought because James Darren was in it.  The performances are good, but the two best known actors Rita Moreno and James Darren weren't given a whole lot to do.  Other than that it seems like a TV movie with R rated language.",1168819200,,237,4.2444444444444445
