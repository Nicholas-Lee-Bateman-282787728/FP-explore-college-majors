772549,4,6304028784,"I love this video for the singing.  As a matter of fact, I would recommend it over Bartoli's Decca cd recording because the best principal singers are the same, except in this video, you get Raul Giminez as the Prince, instead of William Matteuzzi on the cd, and although Giminez' voice is a bit lighter, it's a prettier voice, and his fioratura is much more smooth and lovely.  La Cenerentola is Bartoli at her finest vocally - it suits her sound and vocal style perfectly, but the acting is another matter.  Bartoli is just not funny to me, plus she does alot of odd twitching and jerking that are terribly annoying.

Corbelli is great both vocally and as an actor.  Giminez is enjoyable. Pertusi is fine.  Dara gives me the same feeling as Bartoli - a bit too silly, but his singing is fine. There is a serious message to this opera that doesn't come across because of the ridiculousness of some of the acting and some of the costumes:  The message is that 'goodness triumphs', which is the alternate title of this opera, and I personally feel this opera needs a handful of elegance and subtley (sorely lacking in this video) to convey that message in a witty way.",1087689600,35,1167,4.5285714285714285
772550,5,6304028784,"I have seen other performances of this La Cenerentola, but this performance is the best.
The cheerful and melodious music of Rossini, although not as wellknown as Barbiere de Sevilla, is still so enchanting and beautiful, and comes out as magnificent by the excellent performance and singing of Cecilia Bartoli in her specific deep rich soprano voice which is matched by the clear soft tenor voice of Raul Gimenez and clear baritone Enzo Dara. The combination of singers made this opera buffa so magnificent and enchanting while the costume and background decor represent the comical and funny situation.
We are so enthralled watching and listening to this performance from the beginning to the end of the opera.",1072915200,11,712,5.094017094017094

772552,5,6304028784,"Cecilia Bartoli doesn't just play Cinderella, she is Cinderella, and the Music of Rossini is as natural for her as breathing!  This beautiful and important moment in the world of Opera, and particularly American Opera is a must own.  This Cinderella story is not the one you're familiar with - it tells the story with a beautiful tribute to the human spirit and love.  There are no pumpkins turning into carriages here!
Ms. Bartoli's talent and gift is evident throughout, along with the rest of this extraordinary cast.  But it is Ms. Bartoli's final aria, ""Nacqui all'affanno...Non pi mesta"" that will amaze you.  It must be heard (seen), to be believed.
I was fortunate to see this performance live in Houston...Ms. Bartoli's American premiere performance.  This DVD will be a wonderful memory captured in time.

772553,5,6304028784,"This is a super film of a really charming opera.  Funny, and totally appealing tale with a horrid stepfather instead of stepmother, and the two customary stepsisters.  Cecilia Bartoli was born to play the role, singing to perfection the difficult and beautiful Rossini music.

772658,5,6304028784,"A 5-star performance!  Every member of the cast fills his/her role as near perfection as possible.  Other famous mezzos have recorded the leading role, but Bartoli is outstanding.",1358553600,2,179,5.357142857142857
772659,3,6304028784,"I have owned this recording for a number of years and have had much pleasure from it. There is not a weak member of the cast either as singers or as actors. This is an earlier Bartoli performance form 1996 so it has a warmer and gentler approach than some of her more driven/dramatic recent productions. I find this to be an advantage. One of the main extra attractions is the great comic talent of the two step-sisters who really shine here.

However, the recording quality is now starting to show its age so it has only been a matter of time before a better recorded, but equally successful, challenger would appear. And so it has. This is in the form of the recent Glyndebourne performance which has all the virtues of the Bartoli version plus, to my mind, a more appealing Cinderella character. We also get high definition technology which is at its best, as always, in the Blu-ray format.

So I have finally sold my Bartoli version after years of pleasure and am now content to watch the Glyndebourne production instead, aware of the clear technical advances which have occurred between the two. Something for future purchasers to consider perhaps.

Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:

This recording never surpassed the 1981 Milan opera film conducted by Abbado, with von Stade, Araiza and Desderi. (U.S. review)

I never had the pleasure of seeing the film you mention but, bearing in mind the cast and conductor, it does not surprise me that you favour that one. Generally though, I find that there is frequently a problem with synchronisation between the sound and visuals in films resulting from over-dubbing. I find that problem personally impossible to overcome. I also watch fingering of the orchestral players - something that is absolutely in-built having been trained as a professional musician in the dim distant past! Does the recording you mention have any of those problems? I would be interested in your reply.
Best wishes,
Ian Giles

Dear Ian,
Sorry for such late 'reply'. I do not find so much of an over-dubbing problem in this particular film, really. Of course, some singers are better to look at if they do not have to 'sing' on an operatic stage - like the Prince Charming (Ramiro) of Francisco Araiza. He looks great in this film because he did not have to push out his jaw as he sang in the Salzburg live recording (1988 DVD). Certainly, he looked even better than von Stade here (with her somewhat stained teeth captured in close-ups).(U.S. review)

772660,5,6304028784,"I recently got La Cenerentola Rossini's comic opera and I dare to say that this is a great production. Of course, I refer the Bologna production of this opera for the Houston Grand Opera in 1995. Cecilia Bartoli do her best mezzo coloratura singing and acting in this opera as never seen and heard before. Argentinian light tenor Raul Gimenez is superb in his great singing and acting qualities perhaps the best role before the nowdays peruvian Juan Diego Flores. Bass Enzo Dara despite his age sings and acts delightfuly the buffo art which make him unique bravo! I sincerely recomend this dvd not just for Rossini opera lovers but also for anyone who wish to be in touch more with the art of comic opera.",1250553600,5,706,4.611111111111111
772661,5,6304028784,"I see at this late date, there are plenty of reviews with the usual variation in opinion. Natural, since none of us see or hear the same production, none of us weigh elements in the same way. On the less than positive side, I found the scenic design rather depressing even in the scenes in which that was not the intended result. Clearly the design which was reasonable for the cinders scenes could not be adequately brightened for the palace scenes. With a pang of guilt, given their lowly status, I found the chorus and other supportive players, rather poorly molded into appropriate presences. No fault of theirs, of course, and the chorus did sing well. These were only slight distractions, however, from the impact of Rossini well sung and more than adequately played. That Dara displayed a failing voice is news to me. Perhaps my ordinary sound system (and less than ordinary hearing) did not catch nuances; for he not only acted superbly the role of a traditional Italian actor-singer playing Don Magnifico, he sounded marvelously well singing the part. The Prince and his Valet were admirably handled by Gimenez and Corbelli.
All involved are to be congratulated on allowing Rossini to be heard as he should be in the various individual and group songs that he created. These all were delivered with the elan required to give us the kind of kick that rock concerts must give their adherents.
Oh, yes, Bartoli. I suppose she did look far too healthy for an oppressed menial. Yes, I did notice what one would not notice from my seats at an opera, she had not at that time mastered, what I assume is quite difficult, creating the broad expression necessary for live theater while at the same time not overdoing what the camera closeup will amplify. Did you really care when she sang, were you not stirred by her true star quality in the concluding aria which roused the audience to a peak....as it did me as well. That was a star at work and what a pleasure to see and hear.",1249689600,10,1979,4.641025641025641
772662,5,6304028784,"Roberto de Simone's intimate, 1790's LA CENERENTOLA for the Teatro Communale di Bologna was presented at Houston Grand Opera in 1994 and telecast the following year.  The production is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen of an opera; the sets and costumes look like fanciful children's book illustrations.  True, the direction is often rather static; but de Simone's aim seems to have been to create a truly ""period"" staging - a production that might have been put on in Rossini's own time.  Bruno Campanella's effervescent conducting is in keeping with this chamber-opera feel:  it may lack something in dramatic weight (CENERENTOLA is perhaps the most ""serious"" of Rossini's comedies), but at least the maestro never Romanticizes Rossini, never tries to make the music sound like something it is not.

The telecast was Cecilia Bartoli's American TV debut, and as Angelina she completely justified the ""hype"" that surrounded her at the time.  Her mezzo is a marvel:  multi-hued and shaded, clear and delicate, yet quite dramatic where it needs to be (in the Quintet, for example).  She inhabits the character of Cenerentola, as does Raul Gimenez that of Prince Ramiro.  His and Bartoli's Act I duet (""Un soave non so che"") is an oasis of calm in a witty Rossinian fairy tale.  The almost heroic weight of which Gimenez's voice is capable is all the more effective in contrast to his exquisitely soft and subtle singing in the greater portion of the opera.

The supporting cast includes Enzo Dara (Don Magnifico), Alessandro Corbelli (Dandini), and Michele Pertusi (Alidoro).  Corbelli's Dandini has since become legendary (a British critic once called it one of the finest operatic characterizations of our day), and here one can see why:  it is subtle, humorous, and very richly sung.  Veteran buffo Dara as the stepfather looks like Ed Wynn (of MARY POPPINS and ""I Love to Laugh"" fame).  Unfortunately, there are times during the performance when I almost think I would rather hear Ed Wynn sing the role; Dara's voice at first sounds fresh and strong, but in Act II he hits some incredible ""clinkers.""  Along with this his acting tends to be too silly; altogether, he is no match for Corbelli's subtlety in their Act II duet.  (Dara's card-throwing in his third aria is a rare instance of inspired silliness, particularly in combination with his perfect patter.)  Young bass Pertusi, however, provides plenty of vocal freshness in his lengthy, wonderful aria ""La del ciel.""  His voice, not large, is dark in color and amazingly agile.  Laura Knoop and Jill Gove have pure, Rossinian voices and much character as the stepsisters.

Having loved this CENERENTOLA on videotape for several years, I was thrilled to receive the DVD, with its perfect sound and picture quality.  The Bologna/HGO CENERENTOLA is a beautiful production that one can enjoy again and again.  I treasure it!",1244160000,7,2887,5.0062893081761
772663,3,6304028784,"While this is a delightful opera, I felt that the production was lacking in many ways. For one thing, Cecilia Bartoli does not look at all as Cinderella should. Mostly because she is obviously overweight, it's hard to see why the prince is SO captivated by her appearance. The prince himself did not look half as handsome (or young) as Prince Charming should, although I could forgive these small faults if those were my only objections to this recording. I realize that Raul Giminez and Cecilia Bartoli were not chosen for their looks but for their vocal talent. However, that's not the only problem. The make-up people did a HORRENDUOUS job on the prince's valet, Dandini, making him as ugly as possible. The step-sisters were worse...who's idea was it to make them wear flower pots on their heads!!! I thought that this was completely unnecessary. Even the lighting and sets were dark and ugly. Visually, the whole production was very poorly executed, although the singing was fine. This comic opera in and of itself is delightful, but I would much more highly recommend the 2006 Deutsche Gramophone DVD starring Frederica von Stade. The singing is just as beautiful, and the singers, sets, makeup and costumes are infinitely more so.

EDIT: The aforementioned opera movie was filmed in 1981; it was released on DVD in 2006.",1209254400,11,1327,4.897777777777778
772664,5,6304028784,"I am a great fan of Cecilia Bartoli, and have been so, since this, her role as the title character, in Rossini's La Cenerentola.  In my opinion, Bartoli is one of the most beautiful, dynamic and brilliant mezzo sopranos of our time.  She has such a rich and beautiful tone, to her phrasing, as well as her general delivery of the songs in her repertoire.

This, the Houston Opera House production, is about as far away from Disney's Cinderella as you can get.  So, before you consider seeing this operatic version of Cinderella, discount all of your preconceived notions.  La Cenerentola (Cecilia Bartoli), is a beautiful, selfless and very mistreated young lady, who is regularly taken advantage of by her wicked stepfather and equally wicked stepsisters.  The stepsisters (with father in tow) are invited to a the prince's ball, where he will select the lucky lady who will become his wife.  Of course, La Cenerentola is not allowed to attend the ball, and is expected to sit at home while her wicked family has all of the fun.  However, fate has other plans.  There isn't a fairy godmother in the picture, so much as a Philosopher, who is watching out for the poor girl's best interest.

The cast is so strong here.  Particularly notable is the great performance by Raul Gimenez (a great Chilean tenor, who plays the part of Don Ramiro, the romantic prince).  You will laugh and maybe even shed a tear over this beautiful production.  The music is absolutely soaring and lovely to listen to.",1168041600,18,1494,4.744186046511628
772665,5,6304028784,"Esta funcin procedente de la pera de Houston de una de las mejores peras de Rossini es sin duda la mejor versin visual disponible hasta la fecha de esta obra.

En lo vocal, todos rinden a un nivel estupendo. Comenzando por una CECILIA BARTOLI excelente, tanto en lo escnico como en lo vocal: su pirotcnica coloratura es de impresin y su voz es bellsima. Cantar el papel mejor que ella en la actualidad es muy dificil.

Junto a la joven Bartoli tenemos al veterano ENZO DARA, un Don Magnifico cuya voz no es especialmente hermosa (nunca lo ha sido) pero con muchas tablas, y con un conocimiento profundo de su personaje. Implicadsimo en la trama de principio a fin, siempre con mucha comicidad. Un clsico que se agradece.

El Don Ramiro de RAUL GIMENEZ es un derroche de clase, conocimiento de estilo rossiniano y belleza vocal. Su trabajo es digno del ms fuerte de los aplausos.

El Dandini de ALESSANDRO CORBELLI, cmico y cantado a la altura de los mejores en este papel, sigue sumando puntos a un reparto sin fisuras, que se completa con el lujoso Alidoro de MICHELE PERTUSI y unas cmicas Clorinda y Tisbe, que hacen sus pinitos en los concertantes.

La direccin de BRUNO CAMPANELLA, aunque adecuada, podra pecar de algo lenta en algun momento.

La produccin de la pera de Houston es lujosa, variada, divertida y coherente con la historia; y la realizacin televisiva es muy adecuada.

7860612,4,6304028784,"I have difficulty not liking a production of a Rossini opera. They usually have a very particular style that's hard to mess up; similar situation here.

Good aspects:
- Strong performances from all the leads. It's really silly to try and point out moments of greatness because they were all consistently poised and ready to jump through the next hoop.
- Colorful costumes. I know this sounds like a 'no duh' comment, but this production comes from an era in American operas that seemed to be using nothing but Earth tones. Here we get a reprieve from boring for an injection of fancy.
- Very traditional staging; no room to offend.

Not as good aspects:
- The chorus does not come through very well on this recording. They're often a little too far from the edge of the stage and it seems they weren't picked up on mic as well as a result. I could always hear the first tenors, but rarely the basses.
- Some of Gimnez's high notes tend to sound really pushed and strident compared to the rest of his voice. Very minor thing I noticed.
