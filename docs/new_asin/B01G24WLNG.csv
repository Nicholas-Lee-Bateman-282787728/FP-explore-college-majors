8762095,4,B01G24WLNG,"The film focuses on the life of Zoo-Zoo Anderson (Mykal Fax). His father was a mafia man who was murdered when he was a young child. His mother took him and fled to NYC where he is a ex-disgruntle employee with authority issues. He meets his uncle (Paul Campbell)  who is the head the Jamaican Mafia.  His uncle grooms him to take over, while fighting a rival gang lead by Awillah (Stanley Ras General Onwu ) a Nigerian Voodoo priest who wears a nightgown.

The movie has English subtitles for Jamaican English. In the opening scene the acting and directing appears horrible, but it either improves or you become numb to it after a few hours.  We know Zoo-Zoo is educated by his over use of the phrase ""per-se.""  This is one of the best Jamaican Mafia crime films, although at times it got trying to sit through, in part due to the length.
