3874009,1,B0028S77PI,"I really just don't understand it. The Goal movies preceeding this one were in my opinion incredible. Great stories shot in good quality. This movie however I would qualify as an abortion. It is just horrible. I don't understand how Kuno Becker, who was at one time considered to be following in the footsteps of Mexican actor Gael Garcia, could possibly agree to act in this atrocity.",1285718400,13,385,4.7611940298507465
3874010,1,B0028S77PI,"Bought this for my son who adored the first two films. He wanted to switch it off mid way through because it was so bad. Not just that, but for a film that is categorised as suitable for 12 year-olds, I was shocked at some of the scenes that were certainly not suitable for any 12 year old. This film is a mix of mild porn, world cup footage, and a totally new story line that almost totally ignores the hero of the first two films. Dont go near it",1283644800,20,448,3.988888888888889
3874011,1,B0028S77PI,"To say I am disappointed is an understatement. ""The Goal! III"" is shockingly bad. The third chapter of Santiago Munez's life story suffers from cheap visuals and obvious corner cutting, but that is not the worst part. Santiago, the protagonist for whom the first two ""Goal!"" movies were made, is hardly in the story! Not only that. This time around there is no Alessandro Nivola, no Stephen Dillane and no Anna Friel. So why was this film made?

I don't know why, but Kuno Becker's Santiago is sidelined throughout much of the film. The second sequel of ""The Goal"" is mainly about two new characters that came out of nowhere: Liam Adams (JJ Feild) and Charlie Braithwaite (Leo Gregory). They are English football players selected for the national team. They are best friends of Santiago. The three players are all going to be in 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany when something happens to them. Something that is not very exciting.

As a drama I was not impressed with the first ""Goal!"" films, but their football game sequences are impressive with actors and real-life footballers sharing scenes seamlessly. However, for ""Goal! III"" the filmmakers decided on using stock World Cup footage and they don't even bother to hide it. The patched-up scenes of prestigious World Cup games are terribly edited, and the sad thing is, this cheaply made sequence is the only ""football"" part you can get.

The rest of the film is about Charlie making a debut as an actor in a cheesy movie and falling in love with a beautiful woman. Also, there are some forgettable episodes about football fans doing some silly things. You can make a long list of things that are wrong with the film. In short, this is just terrible, a waste of your time.",1281916800,32,1723,4.717607973421927

3874014,1,B0028S77PI,"The worst piece of garbage. The first two were a nice story arc. The third is just out there and Santiago has too much weird hair. The second film ended with him trying to get back with his girl. We see the family arc resolved except for his own wife roz. In fact at the end of Goal two we see her listening to the phone message and turn around and look just about to give birth.

What gives, were the writers and producers suddenly brain dead. They could have used that in Goal three and end it with a family reunion as he plays soccer with his son and his old agent smiling. That is a movie. What they gave the public was disjointed dreck.",1460332800,2,641,4.087301587301587

It is a different movie and disappointing because doesn't show what happen with Santiago's girlfriend, whom seems to be pregnant at the end of Goal I I, or what happen with his family in America or Spain.

8356911,4,B0028S77PI,"This is a good story and JJ Feild really nails the problems faced by Liam.  The reason for such poor reviews is that the writers simply did not continue with the GOAL I,II story line as if it were a TV series.  It would have made an excellent date movie and would have done best if it had been named ""PLAYERS""  or anything besides ""GOAL III"".  By the way, the footage from 2006 World Cup is factual so the outcome of the game was set by history, not the writers.
