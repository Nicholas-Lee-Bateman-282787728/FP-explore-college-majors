1386035,5,B000050ILN,Just as I remembered. Many years ago watching The Cats Pajama programming showing all the would be classic karate flicks. Now I'm building my own collection and enjoying them with my Children. This is one of my favorite venom clan movies. Because it has all the original clan members from The Five(Deadly)venom's. Not sure why The Snake did not make that many movies with the rest of the venom clan. So its always a treat to see them all together. Big fan here. Highly recommend this movie be added to your collection.,1352764800,,518,4.641304347826087

1386037,5,B000050ILN,"Celestial pictures are doing the martial arts fans a great service by cleaning up alot of the old Shaw brothers classics.  The picture is flawless and in my opinion nearly high definition.  If you have seen 36 Chambers of Shaolin and/or Five Deadly Venoms, then this movie is a no brainer buy now.  I would have liked to see a commentary on this with Rza schooling some hollywood shmuck like in the 36 Chambers commentary.  Story is fast paced and focused on bringing the action to the screen right away.  Shaw Shaolin again is Invincible!",1296777600,,539,4.631578947368421
1386038,5,B000050ILN,"The Shaw Brothers, the company known for their many releases of Hong Kong films for many decades ran by producer Sir Run Run Shaw, knighted by the British government and founder of Shaw University in Hong Kong and even founded the HK-TVB TV network was a major power behind the company and his third brother Runme Shaw (who founded South Sea Film), the film company would become known as Shaw Brothers Studio and become the first studio to bring Hong Kong cinema with sound in 1934.

The Shaw Brothers have created over a thousand films and with several having been aired on US television and some being released on video, the 1978 film ""Nan Shao Lin yu bei Shao Lin"" (Invincible Shaolin) is directed by Chang Cheh (known for the film ""Chinese Super Ninjas"", ""Five Venoms"", The Brave Archer"" and ""The One-Armed Swordsman), the Shaw Brothers Studio's most well-known filmmaker.

The film is one of Chang Cheh's tales of Shaolin rivalries during the Qing Dynasty.  The film revolves upon an evil warlord named General Pu (played by Lung Wei Wang) and his goal to rid of the Qing Empire's Shaolin Masters.  So, he invites three well-known Shaolin martial artists to fight and become his instructors.

Su Fong (played by Chien Sun) is known for his whirlwind kick (one kick can kill a man), Pao Sen Tsao (Feng Lu) can kill with a punch using Chin Kan Palm and the youngest of the group Yang Chung Fei (played by Sheng Chiang) who has mastered the Butterfly Pole and another martial art to easily evade attacks and jump fluidly. The three are from the Shaolin martial artists from the North.

General Pu and his assistant have the three compete against three martial artists from the South.  The Northern trio easily defeat the three from the South and are spared from any killing.  But secretly General Pu comes to visit the losing team and with one hit to each person, kills them.

The three from the North are told that their battle has killed the three from the South and they are shocked.  They feel they may have mistook their own power or perhaps they are being framed for the murders.

The Southern Shaolin School mourns the death of three of their students and another three are sent to fight the Northern trio.  This time, two are killed in battle and one escapes to tell his teacher of their techniques and how they are not prepared to fight with them.

Wanting revenge, the teacher of the Southern Shaolin School gets three of his top students to learn Southern Shaolin counter attacks to fight the Northern trio.  Ho Ying Wu (played by Phillip Kwong) trains to master the Fishtail Pole to counter Yang Chung Fei's Butterfly Pole attack.  Chu (played by Meng Lo) trains to learn the Mantis to counter Pao Sen Tsao's Chin Kan Palm and Mai Fong (played by Pai Wei) learns Wing Chun to fight Su Fong's Whirlwind Kick.

Despite the Northern trio knowing something is amiss and aware that possibly the General or his assistant is responsible for the things that have taken place, the Southern Shaolin trio train their hardest to prepare for their fight to the death against the Northern trio.

VIDEO:

So far, each Shaw Brothers release that FUNimation Entertainment has looked quite solid. Thanks to Celestial Pictures going through major remastering and restoration for many of the Shaw Bros. films, ""Invincible Shaolin"" looks very good. I saw no major blemishes, the film doesn't look aged and for the most part, the fact that this film is over 30-years-old, the PQ for the film is pretty good on DVD.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

As for audio, the film is presented in English Dolby Digital stereo and Mandarin Mono. Personally, having endured these Shaw films with the terrible (yet humorous) English dubs back in the late '70s and early '80s, just watching it again with the English dub just didn't make sense anymore (unless you get a kick of how bad they were acted). So, watching it with the Mandarin mono track was my choice and preference.

I felt the English stereo soundtrack was OK but felt the Mandarin mono to be much better. For listening, I had my receiver set for stereo on all channels for a more immersive soundtrack. Some may be wondering why the film is presented in Mandarin when Hong Kong films are typically in Cantonese. The Shaw Brothers Studio had films split into Mandarin and Cantonese.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Invincible Shaolin"" comes with no special features.

EXTRAS:

The ""Invincible Shaolin"" DVD comes with a slip cover.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When it comes to Shaw Bros. films, one of my favorite storylines is when they tend to show the good guys being manipulated by someone evil and then we are introduced to another set of good guys and thus we are watching a film where we end up watching people on the same side fighting to the death.

""Invincible Shaolin"" is one of those films.  For the first half, we are rooting for the Northern Shaolin trio as they are being manipulated by General Pu and then the film suddenly switches to the new Southern trio who constantly train themselves for months in order to counter the Northern Shaolin martial artists' attacks.

Needless to say, this film thrives on martial arts choreography.  Showcasing offense and defense and your emotions are literally tied behind your back because you are rooting for both sides because they are the good guys but circumstances pit them against each other.

The fighting scenes are awesome and although there is some gory violence (ie. a person's ribs protruding out of his body after a fight or people getting impailed), it's not to the point where it's disgusting (bare in mind, this film was created in 1978, so special effects was not exactly that convincing back then for a Shaw Bros. film).  Also, the innovative ways for the training of the Southern Shaolin students is pretty cool and it's quite interesting to see the three develop counterattacks against the Northern Shaolin techniques!

The film is literally a martial arts fight fest.  There are romantic angles with the Northern trio finding love but the women don't play a major role in the film, their presence is merely setting up the plot that leads to the North vs. South in battle and more for comedy to breakaway during the training of the Southern martial arts students.

Continuing with the restoration of the Shaw Bros. films courtesy of Celestial, this latest FUNimation release looks very good for a film that is over 30-years-old and once again ,we do get the original Chinese Mandarin track and even the horrid original English dubbing that I'm sure many people still enjoy after all these years for these Shaw Bros. films.

Overall, if you are looking for a Shaw Bros. film that is straight-up mostly all action or dedicated to the training of martial arts, ""Invincible Shaolin"" is definitely recommended!",1276560000,9,6785,4.7733105218135155

1386041,5,B000050ILN,"This movie is one of my favorites.. I have quite a collection and enjoy revisiting Invincible. Won't get into specifics but the fighting matches are awesome.. love the fact that the movie displays a tense and avengeful atmosphere. More importantly, I personally favored the way different styles can be combatted by another this was indeed a Cheh Chang classic. Did I mention the entire 6 venom mob crew are in it !",1094947200,3,414,4.763888888888889
1386042,5,B000050ILN,"A masterpiece of the Venoms era-- matched (not surpassed!) only possibly by Masked Avengers for sheer exuberant heroism and villainy!  This is the film that set the tone for so many others-- Evil-general-deceives-rival-kungfu-schools-into-wiping-one-another-out-type-stuff, and is replete with the lengthy, laughable training sequences that made the Venoms famous. You'll never eat scrambled eggs again! So what if it's about as believable as pro wrestling? You get to see bodybuilder/gymnasts somersaulting though Chinese gardens disembowelling one another with amazing weapons, all the while proclaiming their eternal camaraderie!!
Unlike later efforts, this one even features a moving camera, so unlike films such as Masked Avengers, actors aren't forced to stand in tableau looking sideways... they can actually walk around the set-- a bonus!  And it's a beautiful, colourful, letterboxed print that appears to have been made from film, and not video.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!",1014076800,13,977,5.964285714285714
1386043,4,B000050ILN,"I purchased this DVD and it is the version with the Venoms (aka North Shaolin vs. South Shaolin). All of the Venoms are featured in this film, the story is great, and, as with all Venom films, the fight scenes are top-notch!",1009843200,3,224,4.357142857142857

The abilities of ""The Venoms"" shine greatly in this one as the two groups are positioned against one another unknowingly. Chiang Sheng really comes thru with his abilities in this one as well as the other ""Venoms"" going all out.

7929104,4,B000050ILN,"I first saw this movie when I was a kid watching ""kung fu theatre"" on Saturday afternoons.  At the time, I thought it was one of the greatest kung fu movies I ever saw.  When I saw the movie available for sale on Amazon, I immediately wanted it for my collection.  Now, after seeing it again after so many years, I realize that while it's still a good movie, it's not quite as good as I remember.  The martial arts is a bit stiff and very choreographed, and the overall production quality of the movie isn't great, but that's totally fine.  This movie is a great representation of the genre at that period in time. If you like kung fu ""grindhouse"" type of movies with lots of fake-looking blood, cheesy plots and acting, then you can't go wrong with this one.",1426464000,,759,4.3546099290780145
