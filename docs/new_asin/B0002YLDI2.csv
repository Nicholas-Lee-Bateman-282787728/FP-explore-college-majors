2148423,3,B0002YLDI2,"The best part of the anime are the character dimensions. Kazuma and Ryoho do more than just chase each other throughout the series and calling the other inept for their ideals. They see what it's like to be in the place of the other person with many surprises along the way.

The peeves I had with this series were 1) the ending (but I won't tell you what happens) and 2) the repetitive nature of anime heroines tripping all over themselves when they're running to the their main squeeze and thereby being caught into an accidental hug.

I will thus rate the following (1-10; 10 being the highest) based on quality or amount:

Action: 10

Romance: 3

Soundtrack: 6

Dubbing: 5

Characters: 9

Story: 8

Violence: 6

This anime is best for those ages 13 and up",1123804800,18,759,4.474452554744525
2148424,4,B0002YLDI2,"s-CRY-ed is, at its center, the story of a rivalry. Hot-headed Kazuma, generally irresponsible and always ready for a fight, realizes he's met his match in his antithesis- haughty, dedicated, emotionally withdrawn Ryuho. They also symbolize their respective interest groups- Kazuma is a free agent living in the wasteland part of the Lost Ground with his friends, and Ryuho represents HOLY and lives in the city. This rivalry, between two equally strong, determined people who are so idealogically different, is what holds the story line together.

There is something decidely Brave New World-ish about s-CRY-ed, and that is not a bad thing. It gives some emotional heft to an anime that otherwise might have been about nothing but battle scenes. It is also important to note that this is not a one-sided deal: Kazuma is the anime's hero, but I found myself even more attached to HOLY and its variety of personalities. Their mission is arguably deplorable and some of their methods inarguably so, but it is all highly realistic, and the HOLY alters are certainly more interesting characters than the essentially faceless denizens of Inner.

This box set is very nice- it contains all 26 episodes. There is also a handful of extras, though I would have preferred for them to be on one disc instead of scattered across six. I should also note that the box the set comes in is incredibly annoying- it's bulky, a pain to open and close, and difficult to store, so I chucked it. The discs themselves are in a digipak, which serves well enough.

I have yet to figure out why s-CRY-ed is called s-CRY-ed. I know what scrying means. The only thing I've been able to figure is that it has something to do with Kanami's preminatory dreams. I do recommend s-CRY-ed to anime fans, though it would be a good idea to catch a couple of episodes on Adult Swim before shelling out $100+ on the set, to see whether or not it's your cup of tea.",1122422400,10,1925,4.706231454005935
2148425,3,B0002YLDI2,"Kazuma is a red haired guy who has a hot temper and just like a saiyan, he love's a good challenge especially challenging Ryuho who is a total oppisite of Kazuma. He is a deciated officer in Holy and he is a bit laid back. Both of these guys are Alter Users. They have some weird powers Kazuma be turing his left arm into metal and be changing it tino all kinds of shapes. S-Cry-Ed is too cartoony to be a show for teenagers let along Adult Swim. All it has is minor profanity, little tobacco use and action ""that's it"". Don't expect blood, sexual, humer, or acholol use.",1122336000,,571,4.247706422018348
2148426,4,B0002YLDI2,"I agree with the above user, A.J. Dill. I saw the first episode of s-CRY-ed on adult swim and thought nothing of it. But as I watched the next couple of episodes, I began to fall in love with it like I had Wolf's Rain. Soon after the first episode the plot begins to grow and you can see the long term story instead of a copy of Dragonball. I would suggest this to anyone that enjoys some fantasy and tragedy filled backgrounds.",1120953600,5,428,4.168674698795181

2148428,4,B0002YLDI2,"When I watched the first episode, I thought I had wasted my money. It looked like the show was going to have the plot that of a kiddy anime show in which the only thing that happens is characters just power up. So the DVD set just laid there gathering dust.

I came back to the DVD a couple weeks ago to watch the second episode, and found out my intuition was wrong. Some very fun and intriging characters were introduced in the next episode. There was only one person I found a tiny bit annoying since she continually talks about this indecisive dream of hers, but it didn't throw me off. None of them are alike; their personalities all vary and there is always conflict.

Talking more about conflict, there is a lot of fighting in the series. All the fights seems to have a unique twist, though, that keeps away the boredom factor. Plenty of time is spent plot developement too. The central theme of the plot seems to be about being too quick to judge and the bad effect of the opression of people. I hardly found it predictable, and there is always an unknown.

I also have to give kudos to the people who did the music of the show. I can't remember one time that the music did not fit into the scene, and I found the beginning's song very catchy. I've seen quite a few anime shows in which the background music sounds a little too korny, but not in S.Cry. Ed

What keeps this show from getting five stars? I think it has to be the animation. Not that the animation itself is bad- actually it's very well done. The special effects are realistic and the character's faces never look disportional. The only problem is the coloring. Its very cheerful, light, as pretty as a rainbow. I think if the colors were dark and the characters were drawn more maturely, I think this show would be much more popular. The pretty colors give it a kiddy show feeling even though people die and there is cursing.

I highly recommend this series, but I just have to tell you don't be too quick to judge like I was.",1109808000,19,1999,4.334224598930481
2148449,5,B0002YLDI2,This anime is addicting. I bought it for my son and he was ecstatic. It works like its suppose to and it came in good condition. This product met all of my expectations for the product.,1356739200,,185,4.166666666666667
2148450,4,B0002YLDI2,"22 years ago a phenomenon cause the Earth to shift around Kanagawa forcing it high above sea level. Many people in this area have developed something called alter power. It is different for each person. Kazuma can turn his arm into a metal claw. He works doing odd jobs, sometimes. He lives with a young girl, named Kanami, She takes care of his lazy ass and acts as a surrogate little sister. Kazuma has a run in with a group of Alter user law enforcement officers. His life changes as they come after him and the other Alter users in an attempt to create order and gain power.

This anime is pretty unique. The animation, the voice acting and the music are all pretty good. S-Cry-ed also has some pretty cool characters. There is a lot to like about this anime. I think the development of some of the characters could have been better though. There are some pretty heavy emotional moments that would have been more impacting if the character relationships were explored a little more. Overall this anime is pretty good. It has almost everything you could ask for in an anime. Other than my 1 little beef with this show, S-Cry-ed is really fun to watch.",1351296000,,1154,4.521531100478469
2148451,4,B0002YLDI2,"I'm a pretty big anime fan, and for some reason S-Cry-ed has always had a special place in my heart for me. It was one of the first series I watched. As far as storyline and etc., it's a pretty common super-power anime. Main character has a power, so do lots of other people. He must get stronger to defeat the bag guys. There are a few twists, but nothing too outrageous.",1340496000,,372,4.180555555555555

2148453,5,B0002YLDI2,"Every once in awhile an anime comes by that changes the way people look at anime. For me that anime was Scryed. It is one of the few anime made post 2000 that still has the feel of an 80's/early 90's anime. The story is relatively simple. A part of japan becomes separated from the rest of the country. A small percentage of people in this area become born with special powers called alter powers. This area, referred to as the lost ground is split into two regions, one a bustling metropolis and the other a desert wasteland.

In this anime there are two protagonists. One is Kazuma who is born in the wasteland of the lost ground. He has struggled to live up until now and is basically a mercenary who does odd jobs to to scrape by while supporting his two dearest friends. Ryuhou the other protagonist lives in the city, surrounded by a giant wall, he has decided that all free alters must be captured and detained. There is a reason for this but i am going to avoid spoilers. Long story short Ryuhou and Kazuma become enemies and face off numerous times throughout the series in high energy battles.

This is an action series made for enjoyment, it may not be incredibly complex but there is a well thought out easy to understand message underlining the whole series. If you enjoy anime like DBZ and Bleach I say give this a shot. It's similar, although it attempts to make a big statement and tells a complete story within 26 episodes. I'll leave it here so I don't bore anyone, I recommend everyone to give this series a shot because It was one of my favorites growing up and I still enjoy it. Enjoy.

2148454,3,B0002YLDI2,"Starts out great a compelling plot, good characters, pretty good voice acting and great art style for how old it is but the last 4 or 5 episodes just killed it for me it totally went away from what the show was and made an ugly environment and uninteresting bad guy who is also very ugly in one of his forms and could have gone so many different directions and made the ending lame and annoying!",1318636800,,395,4.2105263157894735

The action is awesome, the story great, and the characters even better. The music is unique and the artwork and animation are above average. Kazuma and Ryuho are one of anime's greatest rivalries, and I can't believe that this series gets so little attention, yet it was actually broadcast for a while on Adult Swim. I'm guessing the strange, nonsensical title, turns people off, I don't know.",1288310400,,533,4.5625

2148461,3,B0002YLDI2,"When adult swim put this on for a while. I was kind of curious I just decided ""what the heck I'll give it a shot."" My impressions? Well, it neither good or bad, it's just average. While it does have a story line that might or might not keep you interested (depending on what episode you're on), most of the ""action"" is sometimes way too repetitive, that it becomes rather boring after a while; and because of this, I just completely lost interest in by the 12th episode. It didn't really make a difference to me whether Kazuma or Ryuhou won...I was just like is that pretty much it? While there were a few moments of unexpected (and welcomed) surprises, the show pretty much never really took off. I can't complain about the animation, as it wasn't too bad, neither were the voice actors, they did an ok job, the music was ok, but still it wasn't good enough. 3 stars.",1218931200,,868,4.39751552795031
2148462,4,B0002YLDI2,though I watched the anime series in fansub before I read the manga is was impressed with both formats.

I LOVE these kind of characters the kind that don't feel sorry for themselves. Kazuma and Ryuho now join my favorite anime characters list. ^_^
S-Cry-ed has enough action in it by the end of the series you're catching your breath with the characters.
Rather you're male or female I feel that you can enjoy this series. The voices on S-Cry-Ed are perfect the dub is fun (me being a Huge dub fan) and the whole cast did a great job IMO. I love personally loved Kazuma's dubbed voice.

It does have some of the traditional anime fighting like you see in such animes as Sailor Moon, it has super cool supporting characters and the kind of bad guys that make you want to throw things at your tv, but it also incorperates several exciting new story elements, the most important being the true focus of this anime is the rivalry between the two main protaganists. This is emphasized so much that the series doesn't end where all the other animes end, the bad guy defeated and everyone lives happily ever after, but rather two episodes later with one last contest of strength between the two main heroes. This is an anime of the highest calibur, and you won't be disappointed.",1192838400,,745,4.567164179104478

2148479,5,B0002YLDI2,"s-CRY-ed is a Japanese Anime series that tells the story of two young men named Kazuma and Ryuho. The story is about the people living on a part of Japan that broke off from the mainland during a great upheaval.  Now this island, known as the Lost Ground, is home to many people with strange abilities called alters. Alter users have the ability to break down matter and rematerialize it in a completely different form. One of our main characters, Ryuho, is an alter user and member of HOLY, a group of alter users created to work for the mainland and stop any native alters who get out of control. The other main character, Kazuma, is one such native alter who works by doing odd jobs to survive. Along their journies, these two clash many times and are constantly fighting.  The relationship that these two have with each other, and the people around them is basically what this show comes down to being all about.

With a supporting cast featuring a wide range of strange and great characters such as Ms. Mimori, Kanami, Strait Cougar, Scheris Adjani, Martin Zigmarl, and Kimishima, it is easy to see how this show can grow on you. The battles are done fairly well, and are overall enjoyable to watch. You can usually find at least one character you can relate to, or root for. The main villain, Kyoji Mujo, doesn't enter until halfway through the series, though in my opinion his threat is second to the main story of the relationship between Kazuma and Ryuho.

Though if you still don't know why this product deserves five stars, it is because all 26 episodes of the show, yes this series is short, are in this set. To get an entire series, especially an anime, for just over 30 dollars is in my opinion an incredible deal. Perhaps I am giving this anime too much credit, but I really enjoy it and do feel it deserves more appreciation. Of course, ultimately whatever you think of this anime is up to you to decide. If you haven't yet seen it, perhaps you should before actually buying it, though I don't believe you'd regret buying this. What's left to say? If you like an action anime, that revolves around a large number of entertaining characters, check out s-CRY-ed.",1191369600,22,2176,4.5717948717948715

Both sides of the battle have good guys and bad guys so it makes for many curious and somewhat comical alliances. All of the characters have reasons to fight and they do so quite well.

The abilities are somewhat random so it makes things curious. The most notable is the watermelon sheild. I suggest giving this anime a shot, it is well worth the money and is worth being a part of an anime collection.",1167955200,,697,4.75206611570248

The main characters, Kazuma the dense and brutish savage, and Ryuhou, the uptight upright paladin of honour, constantly battle one another through the whole thing, culminating in sheer brutality. The brutality is something that is often lacking somewhat in much of the anime that falls into the shonen fighting genre. I think this is one of the better and more noteworthy things about it. It also keeps the fights short, and really doesn't stretch any one single battle over multiple episodes...unlike some members of the genre that shall remain nameless...

That's not to say that this is an overall masterpiece of any sort. The plot is fairly thin (as to be expected with any shonen fighting sort of piece). The female characters are ALL pretty much useless, which is something I've always despised about the genre.

Overall, it's enjoyable, but not high art.",1131148800,16,1070,4.804347826086956

The basic plot is that two people named Kazuma and Ryuho are fighting for the same reason; freedom.  They don't realize that they are really similar to each other until the end so they fight each other with this power that is called an alter.  Besides the fact, this anime is great.

2148487,1,B0002YLDI2,"Let me start by stating that this series deservers a 1.5 in my opinion. It is a poorly drawn series which tries to grab your attention by referring to things in the show in biblical ways (much like Evangelion was famed for). However, there is no deep plot, there is lesson to be learned about humanity, there is just a waist of time. Which is fine, if you are in the mood to watch mindless TV. However, that makes this anime, to me, no more enticing than domestic television.

First of all, this series didn't have enough story to make into a 26 episode series, so they decided to give the characters amnesia half way through the series. The art is below sub-standard for Japanese Animation, and quite frankly, look like American Saturday Morning Cartoons. There are much better series which ask for less than 1/4 the price of this series. Honestly, I thought the series was so bad when I watched it in Fan-Subs over 2 years ago, I never thought I would ever see it in the US. Trust me, instead of watching this series, invest in Evangelion. If you like Evangelion, don't waist your time with this.
