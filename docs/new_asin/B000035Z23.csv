The really only redeaming things are the wife and son's preformances are good, but the other characters are grating. The story is long and kinda dull. And this coputer who doesn't uderstand alot of human words, has emotions? Lots of plot loop holes and bad acting.",1120003200,,332,4.6440677966101696

7916775,5,B000035Z23,"Dream House is one of, if not the greatest movie ever made. It boasts powerful performances from a first-rate cast, with Busfield particularly excelling in his challenging role. The script is Oscar-worthy and filled with fantastic quotable one-liners, with top notch directing to bring this monumental, life changing epic to life. The special effects are out of this world, and add depth to this well plotted, challenging and even frightening sci-fi thriller. Buy it before you can say,""Open the door, Helen.""",1034467200,,509,5.296296296296297

7916777,1,B000035Z23,"Even if you are not an old movie buff, in the first 5 minutesyou can understand anything can happen in this film...except for themost inconsequential passages of this rambling story.  Here thereare not only the problems of the B-movies, here there is not a script,and the actors don't know what they have to express.  Somebody canthink the basic idea of this film is good (""Helen"", thecomputer which control the house, becomes so human that she wants killher creator and family to realize her choices) maybe he doesn't knowdecades of SF, above all Kubrick's ""2001"".  The charactersare so stupid that ending you will hope for Helen's victory.",978998400,2,641,5.028301886792453
7916778,2,B000035Z23,"I watched this movie on SciFi channel, and I regretted as soon as the credits rolled.  This is a no better than C grade movie, with B grade actors.  That, and you'd have to be brain dead to take the movie at face-value.  Take my advice, and avoid this movie like the plague, or you too may cry when you drink.",973728000,,309,4.032786885245901
