2038694,3,B0001WTWMY,"What can I say? I loved the first 2 discs in this series and thought that they couldn't go wrong with the last. I looked for the longest time to get my closure and now I wish I hadn't. This is the only blemish to a nicely written, drawn and voice acted Anime series.",1296518400,,266,3.9444444444444446
2038695,5,B0001WTWMY,"At first I was skeptical to watch the Ninja Scroll series based on friends telling me it was not as bloody as the movie. But I gave it a chance because I want to see the next great anime series for myself and I was surprised as to how I was drawn inot the series and the story. Bloody-yes, serious-yes, and of course the excitement that comes when Jubei goes head on with different Ninja kimons or demons with their assorted freaky ninja powers. I recommend this. The adventure continues here right after the events of the first Ninja Scroll movie",1268784000,3,547,4.425742574257426

2038699,5,B0001WTWMY,"This album is way better than the previous 2 it has 5 episodes instead of only 4 and it has more special features as well. I don't want to ruin the episodes for anyway, but take it from me this dvd is very good.",1089244800,3,211,3.8181818181818183

8017472,3,B0001WTWMY,"It was hard not to give this show four stars.  The ending was such a letdown that, try as hard as I could, four stars seemed a bit too much.  It is still worth watching.",1428624000,,169,3.8
8017473,2,B0001WTWMY,"While entertaining, this version doesn't come close to the cinematic version",1425254400,,76,6.0
