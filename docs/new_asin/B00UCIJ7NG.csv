8705403,4,B00UCIJ7NG,"I happened across this series on Nat Geo Wild & was just getting into it when I heard Dr. Scott Sims has died. :(

My son gave me this DVD set for a Father's day gift. :)

The pros:
+ Low price of $20.63 with free Amazon shipping when this was purchased.
+ VERY good customer product reviews.
+ This ""manufactured on demand"" DVD-R media... aka MOD DVD plays perfectly on our DVD player.
+ The aspect ratio looks to be standard HDTV widescreen, 1.78:1 (16:9 - 1080i).  Looks good on a standard screen TV.
+ Advertised - Format = NTSC
+ Advertised - Region code = all regions.  The DVD discs I received say ""region 1""
+ Advertised - Run time = 360 minutes, 6 hours.

The cons:
- This is a ""manufactured on demand"" DVD-R media... MOD DVD, meaning it's not a factory laser burned DVD. Not a bad thing, but it may not play properly on some media players.
- There's NO disc menu... what's up with this? This is why I dropped one product review star. This makes it VERY difficult to find a specific episode to watch.

This 2 DVD set contains 8 episodes:
[1] Rude Awakening - Introduction to Dr. Scott Sims & his clinic. Treatment of two dogs, horse with broken leg, potbellied pig, a parrot & a goat.
[2] Eyes Wide Shut - Dr. Sims treats a horse, a coot, a blind pig, a goat & takes a trip to the Big Island to help an animal sanctuary.

[6] Trouble in Paradise - Dr. Sims treats a Nene, tortoises & a friend's horse.
[7] Big Island, Big Problems - Dr. Sims ""fixes"" some feral cats, a horse & a dog born with only two legs.
[8] My Chicken Ate What - Ella & Dia plan a surprise luau to conclude Dr. Sims' interrupted birthday party.",1466899200,,1947,4.164893617021277
