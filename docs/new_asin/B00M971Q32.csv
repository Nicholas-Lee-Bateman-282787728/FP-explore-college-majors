8670846,1,B00M971Q32,The quality of the DVD was horrific.  The picture was so blurry as to be barely visible and the sound was equally bad.  It's a good thing that we know the movie so well so we could follow it. Do Not Buy This Product it's a disaster and a ripoff !!!,1411862400,2,248,3.843137254901961
