And Secondly,Indian cinema has found its own pair of Comedy Geniuses...Paresh Rawal and Om Puri....the new Rawal-n-Puri duo has given such a commendable comic performance that i believe will give any comedian in World Cinema a run for his money....the pure Innocence of the Village-People of India is portrayed beyond perfection by the Duo...
And,at last but not the least....Kudos to all the Cast of this rib-tickling comic havoc....Keep up the brilliance people...heres awaiting more...
still a good Timepass. Do watch!!",1304380800,,767,5.295081967213115
8432992,4,B004KIHOB6,"It's a poor village. The village lottery selling agent sells a ticket which wins. This is his first such ticket. He will get his commission only when the buyer comes forward to claim his prize. Here, the story takes off, since the buyer is a loner, and dead. So, all rush to grab his ticket! Various plots are hatched, and the game is afoot!

There are excellent performances by Om Puri and Paresh Rawal. The movie is hilarious and exciting. The direction is superb and bares the basic instincts of man, when an unclaimed fortune is for the taking.

There is romance and songs. There is also villainy, enacted by a village lady with money and the muscle of hired men.

This movie is a great comedy which holds your interest from the beginning till the end. Don't miss it!",1297382400,,771,4.492857142857143
