7924466,5,B00004VYCV,"Romy Schneider's last movie before she died at age 43.  The year before she lost her son at age 14 as he tried to climb an iron fence in Paris and  one of the iron speers  pierced his body.

The film is very good.",1497225600,,213,3.772727272727273

This film shows all to well Romy's talent as an actress.
Romy went out in style and class with this performance.",1407456000,,180,4.838709677419355

7924469,5,B00004VYCV,"This is a great film  and unfortunately the last one made by Romy Scneider. She was not only gorgeeous but also a
great actress. She won two Csars (which in my opinion is a better accolation than the Oscar). Today it's very difficult to find these two assets(beauty and talent) in one single actress. She received a posthumous award too in 2012(last year)but the prize was ""given"" by Alain Delon"" and I find this an insult to her memory. To select the guy who screwed up life, used her to achieve  fame ( at the time she was well-known and he was a nothing) was really a bad move by the Csar people. As to the film, read the other review; there's little to add.",1373587200,,661,4.28

Fans of Romy Schneider, this is a must have. In her last film, before her tragic death, she performs in a dual role that proves she was not just a beautiful face. An extraordinary performance in this mysterious political and romantic drama, she left fans with a hauntingly beautiful film. One you may think about for quite some time after the view. Her co-stars, Michel Piccoli,Helmut Grien, and Gerard Klein also add their wonderful talents to the film, and of course an appearance from Maria Schell is always welcome in any film.

Schneider is Elsa Wiener and Lina Baumstein. The latter being the very lovely wife of a modern day international political leader for solidarity, Max Baumstein, who is on trial for murder. His story unfolds in the courtroom. It is one of sadness and strife, as he relates how, when just a young boy, he was beaten and left homeless by the Nazi's in pre-war Germany. Taken in by Michele and Elsa Wiener, he becomes like a son to them. But soon the Nazi's are chasing them down as well. Michele sends Elsa and Max to Paris, and promises to be with them soon. Elsa and young Max find freedom there and grow close as mother and son. Elsa is a strong and wonderful woman in many ways. She does everything in her power to reunite with her love Michele again.

It's a touching and thought provoking film. This quiet drama had me glued to the set. Schneider portrays both women with a wonderful passion. There where times when the story seemed to move a little slowly, but the great performances, most notable Schneider, made it a captivating view. Wonderfully filmed, with a more muted tone for the sequences in the past.

This DVD is compatible with Region 2 DVD players(Japan, Europe, South Africa, and the Middle East, including Egypt), although many of the newer players are compatible for all regions. Check your player manual and check with the seller for languages and subtitles.

A most compelling film.

Merci Beaucoup...enjoy....Laurie",1158278400,12,2069,4.814084507042254
