4892757,4,B005TZFZ8S,"This DVD is very good, as you might expect from NFL Films. I was a little surprised, it goes through every Super Bowl I - XLV in chronological order & gives the big moments & players for each game. I thought it was going to be more general, on the big moments overall in the history, but that's okay. The most recent games (last 5-10 years) seem to get more time than the earlier ones. There are three bonus features in the video also that are fine. Highly recommended as a good history on the Super Bowl & entertainment.",1329955200,4,521,4.2727272727272725

4892854,1,B005TZFZ8S,"The most irritating sports production I have ever seen.  Not only was the soundtrack for each game WAY too loud, it was just plain irritating music.  I watched it as far as Super Bowl XXI then turned it off.  Another irritating feature was the video.  The border on the left and right side had out-of-focus action going on at the same time.  Unbelievable!  Will probably slog through the rest of it then put it in the donations pile.  Save your money.",1341014400,3,451,4.493827160493828

Greatest Super Bowl Moments brought back memories for my wife, Linda, when she used to watch football on TV just about every weekend with her father, the late Loyd Thomas. She also smiled thinking about the Bart Starr football she used to throw around. Yes, she was a tomboy.
Greatest Moments starts with the first World Championship of Pro Football in 1967 when the Green Bay Packers defeated the Kansas City Chiefs.
All the stats are here. The Pittsburgh Steelers have won six Super Bowls, the most of any team, while the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers are tied for second place, with five victories each.
Some think San Francisco has the opportunity to tie with the Pittsburgh Steelers and change that record.  Super Bowl XLVI will be played on February 5, 2012, in Lucas Oil Stadium (Indianapolis, IN), to determine the champion of the 2011 regular season. Of course, no one knows for sure. That's part of the allure of this game.
The New York Giants won Super Bowl XXV by only one point: 20-19.
""There is no bigger day in sports all year than Super Bowl Sunday and we are thrilled to bring the best plays from every Super Bowl to DVD and digital with the release of Greatest Super Bowl Moments,"" said Norbert Hudak, Senior Vice President of Brand Marketing and Partner Relations for Vivendi Entertainment.

My favorite teams are the Georgia Bulldogs, the Philly Eagles and of course the New England Patriots. I never knew the history of superbowl was on dvd until now so I ordered this one and I enjoy it. From the very first game to the game from the 60's to the early 2010's, this makes a real treat for football/superbowl fans. Enjoy",1517788800,,460,4.3604651162790695
