8043503,5,B0006UUOEG,"The instructors introduce the simple steps and gradually move on to complex moves. They first show the move with the music by dancing together, then the lead moves are shown from different angles in slow motion and the same for the follow moves. The move is shown with the practice embrace with accentuated rhythm from different angles that focus on lower body and upper body separately.

The move is broken down into counts that is displayed on the screen as well as sounds that makes it clear where exactly you need to be at that count. This DVD is available in different languages, if you want to watch in English the voice of the translator is louder than the instructors (needs improvement in recording). All the steps are introduced with their Spanish name. So you have to translate them yourself if you want to learn the terminology.

I found it extremely useful that they focus on steps and finally they add the rhythm to it. It makes it very easy to learn. Remember if you are new to Tango, you must take steps which are comfortable to you and as small as possible if you are dancing in a crowded dance floor. Both Richardo and Nicole are very tall and what is natural step for them is not natural for others.",1166313600,2,1218,4.506787330316742
