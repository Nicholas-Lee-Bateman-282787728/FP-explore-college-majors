2991998,1,B000WTZ6S0,"The box says this movie is ""unrated"" but it should just be honest and say ""Rated R for strong deviant graphic sexuality"" so people who are not into that would have some idea they might want to skip this one.

The box says it is ""Award Winning"" but upon examination of this claim I was unable to discover what award or awards that might be.

The box says ""critics have been raving"" about this movie, but after watching it I am pretty sure I understand why there is no listing of any of the names of those critics.

For the most part the acting, directing and cinematography are very good and there is a sense while watching (as discussed in other reviews here) that there is a very important story being artfully woven together in an interesting and compelling way. However, by the time the telling is done, you discover that the story was not being woven, but was actually unraveling instead, as each thread of the story ends disappointingly and unsatisfyingly. I got a feeling that the moral of the story is that life has no purpose, so just give up. It is not inspiring at all, as one reviewer suggested, but instead is very, very depressing. If you are contemplating suicide and looking for a movie that will cheer you up or give you some hope, I recommend you do not watch this one.

Other reviewers have suggested that this movie reveals truths about the secret lives of disconnected people, but I hope there are not really Mothers out there who want to seduce their developmentally disabled adult children, or Mothers who have feelings of guilt over the loss of a child and who want to solve that by inviting developmentally disabled strangers to rape and otherwise hurt them.

I am also somewhat surprised that other reviews did not bother to mention the very graphic rape/sex scene as well as numerous other scenes that would be highly offensive to people who are not expecting to see that kind of thing in an ""art movie"", which is what I think this movie is trying to be.",1332115200,12,1980,4.535014005602241
2991999,5,B000WTZ6S0,"I loved this movie. The feeling and pace was graceful, the
cinematography and music wonderful. There's loneliness and loss here,
but it's covered in a way that makes you just fall in love with the
characters and care for them, hope they come through. For those that
can identify with the vib of New York, the film is likely to be
appreciated even more, as elements of the subway and streets come
through realistically.

This movie visits the lives of three different people, and how they
coincidentally intermingle within the movie timeline. The other
characters in the movie add some color and background, and do well
also.

I've watched this movie multiple times and every time I come away
satisfied, and more so: inspired. You can use this movie to better your
life, to better your art. Strongly recommend watching it on a quiet,
relaxing night.",1262649600,2,848,4.801369863013699

2992001,5,B000WTZ6S0,"This film directed by Alfredo De Villa is an intense emotional journey told through the lives of three main characters whose lives intertwine.  I found this film very real, emotionally stimulating and totally thought provoking.  From the beginning I was caught up and the experience was a honest, heart wrenching experience.

All the acting here is superb.  Heather Graham leads the cast in an amazing performance as a very mysterious eye doctor.  Add in Victor Rasuk in a career making performance as a 20 year old photographer who becomes obsessed with her and Dominic Chianese as one of her patients who is also excellent.  All the characters here are shown very realistically and their lives are troubled and multi layered.  The script as well as the directing desrve high credit here.  We become involved and totally invested in these peoples lives.  They are introduced vaguely and as the film progresses we discover all about their lives and the complexities of the issues they are all dealing with.

This was truly one of the best films I have seen in a long time.  It is very intelligent and the way all the characters lives become entwined is very believable.  This film was an emotional journey I will not soon forget.  ADRIFT IN MANHATTAN does not manipulate the emotions of the viewer but rather tells the stories openly and honestly and allows the viewer to feel their own emotions.

I truly don't understand the low ratings here.  I highly praise this film and also highly recommend it. Give yourself the treat of a film that will treat you the viewer with intelligence and provide a truly emotional and thought provoking journey.",1222387200,5,1645,4.845878136200717

2992005,4,B000WTZ6S0,"Though there have been many films of late that address the issues of the isolation of the individual in a society increasingly settling for homogeneity, few have the honesty and simplicity of presentation as Alfredo De Villa's ADRIFT IN MANHATTAN.  Perhaps the reason this film works so well is that instead of dealing with the usual tropes, De Villa restricts his story to three individuals who are suffering isolation in the noise and autonomy of New York City and are thus 'adrift' in a life that seems flat and without a beacon of hope.  The story De Villa weaves is one of interaction of these characters by almost serendipitous incidents, moments that change their lives - at least for a while.

Teenager Simon Colon (Victor Rasuk) lives with his overbearing mother Marta (Marlene Forte) and gets through his life almost without speaking, working in a camera shop, spending his idle hours photographing people in the park. Tommaso Pensara (Dominic Chianese) is an elderly painter and music lover who lives alone and supports himself by being the 'mail boy' in a large firm: his loneliness is heightened when he discovers he has macular degeneration and will go blind.  The physician who makes his diagnosis is Dr. Rose Phipps (Heather Graham) who is grieving from the recent death of her 2-year old child and is unable to continue her marriage to literature professor Mark Phipps (William Baldwin).

The threads of coincidence begin to tie these people together when Simon begins to photograph Rose in a manner that resembles stalking, when Tommaso notices and desires and older lady at his workplace, Isabel Parades (Elizabeth Pe&ntilde;a) and is encouraged by Dr Rose to share his potential blindness with this friend, and when Rose explores the attention Simon bestows on her, filling an emotional need for both parties.  Naturally the development of these intersections is more complex but at the same time the manner in which they develop is very tender and gentle.

Some viewers may find the film meandering a bit too much: this is not linear storytelling but rather shifts in incidents and moods and gradual changes that occur among these simple but needy people, much like the coincidences and random kindnesses occur to the sensitive eye.  The cast is very fine and the cinematography and musical score sustain the mood of the piece.  This film requires involvement on the part of the viewer, and that involvement has its rewards.

2992006,3,B000WTZ6S0,"When i took a chance on renting this from blockbuster, the checkout lady said most people who rented it thought it was better than expected. I'm not so sure I'd be that kind.

2992056,5,B000WTZ6S0,"File this one away under films you never heard of but somehow but chance came across it and said ""why not"" It certainly has the elements that attract me to great films. Heather Graham has aged beautifully and is amazing as the lead. You have the sense as you watch that something big is being weaved together. It gets stranger and stranger. And, then, suddenly it seems to have ended before that big ending you thought was coming. In my case, I was kind of tired when I watched it, so I just chalked it up to the film being a little flat. That was till the next day when I pondered the whole thing and it became clear. It isn't anything overt. But the message is about liberation. I have now seen it 4 times and pick up more and more with each viewing. Those who don't get it should go back. Just like in life, sometimes it is the small things that have the greatest impact.

2992081,3,B000WTZ6S0,"I found the film interesting enough to sit through to the end.  There was a lovely mysterious mood created in the beginning when we see a young Puerto Rican fellow follow an older beautiful blond woman and take pictures of her.  He is quite nice-looking himself which adds to the enjoyment of the film.  The blond turns out to be an eye doctor and treats an elderly man who is losing his eyesight.  He works as a mail deliverer in an agency but is really a serious painter at night.  He becomes involved with a younger woman who works at the agency.  Then we see the separated husband of the eye doctor and the  very disturbed mother of the photographer.  The film shows how their lives connect.  It's a device that has been used elsewhere to great effect and here it is nicely done, too.

Although I liked it while watching it, a few hours later, it had left my mind, like a frothy dessert with no substance.  The relationship of the young photographer to his mother is quite disturbing and then he has another disturbing encounter with the eye doctor.  It all rings true but it may bother some viewers.

The film is visually appealing, from its New York City setting to the actors, most of whom are very good looking.  The female star, whose name I've already forgotten, is quite stunning but her voice is flat and without much expression.  The young photographer has very few lines but has a beautifully expressive face.  The older man is also quite beautiful, I found. Even the insane mother of the photographer is very attractive.  Most of the supporting actors looked good, too.  So if you're visually oriented as I am, you may give an extra star as I did, for its look.  It's interesting how the eye features prominently in the film---the eye doctor, the painter who's losing his sight and the photographer who uses his camera as a way to connect with the world.  Whether this is intentional of not I don't know.  I still think that, as appealing at the film is on the surface that is lacks the emotional depth that would make it more important and memorable.",1388793600,,2066,4.514824797843666
2992082,1,B000WTZ6S0,"Yeah, I am low-income third-class citizen in US and its really depressing watch movie about myself, especially when you associated with 70+ years old mail man trying to be an artist in his spare time.

Yes, probably most low income people do live like they are shown in this movie but its beyond the point, the point should be like I do expect from producer more imagination than I have, I want new ideas even if they are wrong, I want to see these people ideas after work, at night as they surely not robots as they look like in movie.

3226553,5,B000WTZ6S0,"File this one away under films you never heard of but somehow but chance came across it and said ""why not"" It certainly has the elements that attract me to great films. Heather Graham has aged beautifully and is amazing as the lead. You have the sense as you watch that something big is being weaved together. It gets stranger and stranger. And, then, suddenly it seems to have ended before that big ending you thought was coming. In my case, I was kind of tired when I watched it, so I just chalked it up to the film being a little flat. That was till the next day when I pondered the whole thing and it became clear. It isn't anything overt. But the message is about liberation. I have now seen it 4 times and pick up more and more with each viewing. Those who don't get it should go back. Just like in life, sometimes it is the small things that have the greatest impact.

3226577,3,B000WTZ6S0,"Good acting. Missed the point of the sexually abusive mother. The older actors provided depth to the script, old man was a jewel.",1389139200,,129,4.6521739130434785
3226578,3,B000WTZ6S0,"I found the film interesting enough to sit through to the end.  There was a lovely mysterious mood created in the beginning when we see a young Puerto Rican fellow follow an older beautiful blond woman and take pictures of her.  He is quite nice-looking himself which adds to the enjoyment of the film.  The blond turns out to be an eye doctor and treats an elderly man who is losing his eyesight.  He works as a mail deliverer in an agency but is really a serious painter at night.  He becomes involved with a younger woman who works at the agency.  Then we see the separated husband of the eye doctor and the  very disturbed mother of the photographer.  The film shows how their lives connect.  It's a device that has been used elsewhere to great effect and here it is nicely done, too.

Although I liked it while watching it, a few hours later, it had left my mind, like a frothy dessert with no substance.  The relationship of the young photographer to his mother is quite disturbing and then he has another disturbing encounter with the eye doctor.  It all rings true but it may bother some viewers.

The film is visually appealing, from its New York City setting to the actors, most of whom are very good looking.  The female star, whose name I've already forgotten, is quite stunning but her voice is flat and without much expression.  The young photographer has very few lines but has a beautifully expressive face.  The older man is also quite beautiful, I found. Even the insane mother of the photographer is very attractive.  Most of the supporting actors looked good, too.  So if you're visually oriented as I am, you may give an extra star as I did, for its look.  It's interesting how the eye features prominently in the film---the eye doctor, the painter who's losing his sight and the photographer who uses his camera as a way to connect with the world.  Whether this is intentional of not I don't know.  I still think that, as appealing at the film is on the surface that is lacks the emotional depth that would make it more important and memorable.",1388793600,,2066,4.514824797843666
3226579,1,B000WTZ6S0,"Yeah, I am low-income third-class citizen in US and its really depressing watch movie about myself, especially when you associated with 70+ years old mail man trying to be an artist in his spare time. There is no actual plot or attempt to have one in this flick and producer clearly never been anywhere or has so-called life experience and never did try anything except find money to produce nonsense with adrift in...
Yes, probably most low income people do live like they are shown in this movie but its beyond the point, the point should be like I do expect from producer more imagination than I have, I want new ideas even if they are wrong, I want to see these people ideas after work, at night as they surely not robots as they look like in movie.
Yes, avoid and stick with nonsense called ""Hot dog""",1381968000,2,805,4.445945945945946

His character had a beginning and ending in my opinion. The rest seemed just Filler and wasn't worth watching. On top of it all, nobody truly wants to watch inappropriate actions from someone who has serious mental issues. I get that this is truly showing a very real way of living in the world, but I do not want to watch it!

It's because it's there's nothing remarkable about this film that makes you remember it.  It starts off interesting and promisingly enough which is why everytime I run across it I start watching it with interest... and then a little more in the movie I realize I've probably seen this movie before, but why don't I remember anything?  How odd.. well let me plod through it and see if something comes to mind.  Well after this viewing it should be indelibly stamped in my brain that I've seen this before and should never watch it again.",1334534400,,633,4.431034482758621

8225591,5,B000WTZ6S0,"A diverse group of city dwellers, mostly decent and talented people, are experiencing or have already suffered an extreme loss; among them: a beautiful and sad doctor who blames herself for the loss of her son; her poetry professor husband from whom she is estranged; a 20-year-old talented b/w photographer who is transfixed by a multi-colored scarf; his warped, to the point of incestuous, mother ( she not one of the decent ones); an aging painter, enthusiast of the opera and symphony, who is going blind, and the sage loving woman who works by his side.  All search for or dare not hope for ways to fill in the empty spaces, as they weave in and out of each other's lives. The film reminds us that some folks who appear to have it all together may not.  And that even those with deeply troubled or troubling aspects of themselves may have countervailing strengths. The plot has some good intrigue and is not too formulaic .  All the acting is first rate. The writing, directing, filming, editing, music, etc. are so fluidly and adeptly mastered that all the complexity of characters, plot and subplots advance without a hitch.
