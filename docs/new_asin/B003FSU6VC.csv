4120301,4,B003FSU6VC,"I picked this up just as a movie to watch for end-of-the-year fun.  I was pleasantly surprised at how funny it was.  Yes, the ""hero"" thing was a little wishy-washy and a gander laying eggs doesn't make sense, but the comedy made up for it.  I laughed out loud at the Princess Bride reference, Chevy Chase was very funny and the Who's On First spoof made all my students giggle.  Overall I gave it 4 stars.",1274486400,14,405,4.2894736842105265
4120302,5,B003FSU6VC,"I wanted to jump into this and write a review mostly because of the overt hostility of two of the current reviewers.  I guess I am at a loss for their angst.  We rented it and my three kids (4,6,8) really liked it so we wanted to buy it and I stumbled on the horrible reviews.  Another reviewer has done a nice job summarizing the story and characters but the brief review:  This is a fun and family friendly movie for the late preschool crowd and up (the giant and his henchman might be scary for some early preschoolers or toddlers but they are overall pretty mild).  It is not Shakespeare, it is not an action movie, it is simply a silly and fun little take on the Jack and the Beanstalk story.  If you want something else or expect it, you will be disappointed.  Yes the goose who lays the golden egg is Gilbert Gottfried but to comment on the one reviewers anger, I really think they cast a man in the role because Gilbert has such a distinctive voice and is recognized from many other children's characters especially birds like Cyberchase-Digit and Aladdin-Iago).  I do not believe it should be a call to arms to boycott the movie.  Sure they could have found a great female and sure it was a little weird having a male goose lay an egg but he did a great job and my kids did not make anything of it.  I think there were some clever ideas thrown in there.  The ""COW"" he sells is a computer game system like a playstation (COW is an acronym).  Chevy Chases character is funny.  The idea of Jack's dad being a hero by sacrifice is in there, also Jack does not know this initially so he is told by everyone he will amount to nothing but he overcomes this and believes in himself, making others believe in him as well.  Not bad.  Anyway a fun, silly movie to watch with the family.",1274054400,27,1784,4.267857142857143
4120303,1,B003FSU6VC,"This retelling of Jack and the Beanstalk is not worth the time it takes to watch it. It deviates greatly from the original story (not surprising in Hollywood) and is full of oddities, such as a gander laying golden eggs. Golden or otherwise, a male bird laying eggs is just plain wrong. It would have been much better if they had just cast a female in that role.

The show starts out with Jack being ostracized for not being a hero. So, Jack tries to come up with a way to ""sacrifice"" in order to become a hero. But, Jack fails to understand the difference between ""heroic"" and ""foolish"" by intenitonally giving up the one item of value that he and his mother owned, for something he believed to be worthless.

After learning about the predicament of Destiny's Harp, his pursuit to recover the Harp is done completely out of selfish motive. He is only concerned about becoming a ""hero"" and having his story told. There is nothing heroic about his motivation. He isn't trying to save Destiny's Harp for the purpose of helping anybody. A true hero acts out a servant's heart and/or sacrifice, not for what they will get out of it. I do not appreciate that a ""hero"" is redefined as a person who acts out of selfishness, as opposed to a person of distinguished courage or ability, admired for their brave deeds and noble qualities.

Overall I was not impressed by this film. The production quality, acting, storyline and setting were subpar and it did not contain many redeeming factors. Even the end was all about Jack making a name for himself, no celebration regarding the liberation of Destiny's Harp (which turns out to be a girl who was transformed into the harp by the giant's magic).",1273104000,8,1687,4.598006644518272
4120304,5,B003FSU6VC,"This was a fun movie if you're young at heart and liked fairy tales as a kid. If you're not though, forget it because you'll probably turn it off.  It doesn't deviate far from the original Jack In The Beanstalk story, but the writers were very creative in weaving other fairy tales into the storyline. It's filled with fun and sometimes silly comedy, and some great deliveries from Gilbert Godfrey, who I thought really fit the role of ""The Goose That Laid The Golden Egg"" with his raspy, shrill voice.  The exchange between him and Chevy Chase was particularly fun too.  The writers even put in a variation of the Three Stooges ""Who's on first"" routine, which to me was totally unexpected and a hoot.

For me it was just a fun excursion into a fantasy land of the fairy tales I grew up with that were all mixed up into one goofball movie.  If you like to take movies apart and examine them piece by piece you won't want to watch this movie.  Some of the acting was great, in particularly the job that Chloe Moretz did, but some was average.  Overall, I think it's a great movie for kids, and like I said.. it's a nice twist on the original tale that's fun if you're an adult who is young at heart and doesn't mind movies that require you to check your brain at the door.",1271980800,29,1271,4.315126050420168
4120305,1,B003FSU6VC,"I am speechless. It was a sacrifice to watch 30 minutes of it. I gave up.  It has no argument, sense, or storyline. A hopeless nonsensical parody. The production is at a high-school level, the script is at the elementary school level. One of the highlights is a  parody of ""who is on first"". It is way Overpriced as a $1 rental.",1271808000,4,328,4.274193548387097
4120306,4,B003FSU6VC,"People who read about the film quickly and see Abbot and Costello's names associated with it may think it has them as actors, but this is not so. It is supposedly a rendering by these men. The film is cute and campy. It is a takeoff on both the Jack story and others. It only resembles the fable slightly. It is about a boy who lives in a fairy-tale village, who wants to be a hero. He is convinced that his dad was a hero, but everyone tells him that he was not.",1461024000,,463,3.989247311827957

4120309,3,B003FSU6VC,"I was disappointed.  This movie started out well - though Jack's daydream possibly went on for a little too long.  However, the concept was good and there were amusing references to other nursery rhyme/ fairy tale characters - but it seriously lost momentum in the middle.  It appeared to go nowhere, with a conclusion then hastily thrown together and leaving loose ends.  Perhaps a shorter rendition would have been a good idea.  Colin Ford did an excellent job of playing Jack, but the overall quality of the movie let him down.",1448150400,,530,4.78021978021978

Well, the answer is kind of obvious because this is not billed as a tragedy. So, if you want to enjoy a few laughs in a fairy-tale setting, Jack & The Beanstalk is a great one for the price.

4120360,1,B003FSU6VC,"This was the worst movie I have seen in a long time.  There was no reason to mess around with a time honored classic.  Poor special effects and costuming reigned supreme.  Even my 8 year old and 4 year old were asking ""What's up with this?"" I can't believe that they got any starts to appear in this movie.",1316304000,2,306,4.1525423728813555
4120361,4,B003FSU6VC,"Jack & The Beanstalk is really really *strange*.  I think that's supposed to be the point so perhaps I'm just surprised how accurate the fairytale aspect turned out to be.  Yes, a child climbs a beanstalk, but the way the storyline develops -and especially the outrageous characters he meets along the way- is really... unique.  ""Unique"" is the best way to describe it.

What's especially strange is the very beginning- Jack is a small boy who apparently grows up in a very secluded town with beautiful land and beautiful houses.  The people however, are FAR from beautiful (I didn't even REALIZE that was Christopher Lloyd playing the character of a school teacher with those wrinkles in his face, haha).  His facial expressions are awesome like always though, but I'm surprised he played the role of a strict teacher with high expectations out of his students.

The main reason I dropped the rating one point is because there's this goose character played by Gilbert Gottfried, and we do NOT need an abundance of him OR that screechy high-pitched voice of his, haha.  All you parents out there beware- if you hate Gilbert Gottfried, you will be hearing his voice plenty of times while your kids are sitting on the living room floor and watching this movie.  It WILL get on your nerves.

However, despite Gilbert's voice, he's actually funny.  He tags along with Jack and climbs the beanstalk.  By the way, how freaky IS it to think about climbing a beanstalk all the way to the sky?  I was getting light-headed and weak-stomached watching Jack and Gilbert's goose character navigate their way to the top.

Once they reach the top, they meet a man holding a harp who reveals his daughter has been taken away.  There was a joke here that I believe they beat into the ground- every time Jack or Gilbert mentioned ""Destiny's Harp"" the man would cry.  It was a little much.  They also eventually meet a HILARIOUS backwards Chevy Chase character and an adorable girl who Jack has a crush on.  She turns out to be on their side and knows how to kick some mean butt!

There was definitely some creepiness in the atmosphere.  The foggy areas with the whispering voices is one such example, and just the quiet tone of the borderline heavenly atmosphere is another.

Perhaps the ending could have been better.  I didn't care for it much.  Then again, I don't remember the story too well and how it was supposed to end.  However, I believe it could have been more exciting considering the adventurous tone that dominated most of the storyline.

Overall, this is NOT for adults, haha.  I felt a little guilty for enjoying it as much as I did.  It's most certainly a childrens fairytale movie.  A must watch for children.",1313452800,2,2709,4.694267515923567
4120362,4,B003FSU6VC,Both my daughters (5 & 8 years old) love this movie. I rented it from Netflix and they wanted to own it so they could watch it anytime. They would certainly recommend it to their friends.,1285459200,2,187,4.222222222222222

4120364,5,B003FSU6VC,"I thought this movie was a riot!  I don't get the negative reviews, other than some people just love to be negative.  This is a kids movie, that is fun for us adults as well.  Gilbert Gottfried - well - he is always a hoot.  And Chevy Chase - wow - I had not seen him in a long time, but he was great.  And Christoper Lloyd - well - I have been a huge fan ever since Taxi!  So an all star cast...and a great story line updated for today's kids.  This was a movie you could put in the DVD player and not worry if you were going to regret buying it because Hollywood snuck some sleazy stuff in it somewhere that you don't want your kids to see at their young ages.  I hope these guys come out with more updates to the old classics!

With all the pg movies and above being marketed for the young kids today, I was so happy to find this movie that capivated my kids - my 5 year old watched it 4 times in 2 days (it was the weekend) and that is all he watched - no other tv.  My 8 year old liked it - she is not into the action and fighting, my son though loves fights scenes and action - and this fit the bill for him.  I liked that he kept moving forward and did the right thing.  Life is choice and this movie is a purchase for us.  I rented it on redbox and am here on Amazon to purchase it.
