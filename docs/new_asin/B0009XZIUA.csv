8070167,5,B0009XZIUA,"If anyone who has read Griffin's ""The New Pearl Harbor"" but couldn't stomach its implications, his next book ""The 9/11 Commission Report: Omissions and Distortions"" removes any possible doubt that there was deep complicity by the U.S. government in the atrocity. For those who don't have time or inclination to read books, this DVD presents overwhelming evidence that the 9/11 Commission was simply the White House investigating itself, with the result that there is hardly a word of truth in the Report. It will leave all but the most die-hard bigots with a feeling of deep anxiety about the true nature of the clique ruling the United States today.",1256256000,,650,4.972477064220183
8070168,5,B0009XZIUA,"If you think this was informative, check out a DVD called ""Loose Change 2nd Edition.""  It is by ""Louder than Words.""  Google it and you can find it.  BUT.  Even better is a DVD called ""Martial Law"" by Alex Jones which I can't find here on Amazon. But if you go to infowars.com you can find it easily.  Our government has failed us, time to wake up, America...  :(",1135900800,7,363,4.188405797101449

8070170,5,B0009XZIUA,"Griffin is one of the most respected theologians in the country.  He is a very rational, intelligent, deeply honest human being.  His book- The New Pearl Harbor stands out as the best synthesis of the primary research on 9-11.  His latest book, The 9-11 Report- Omissions and Distortions is the basis for this talk which carefully deconstructs the deep flaws in the official Commission Report which was designed to be a cover-up.  Griffin raises the critical issues that the mainstream press has deliberately ignored.  If you want to understand the truth about 9-11 or be aware of the deceptions that the government is using to pursue a bogus ""war on terrorism,"" this DVD is a good place to begin.  His other DVD- The American Empire and 9-11 goes even farther and is an excellent sequel.",1119830400,12,788,4.8
