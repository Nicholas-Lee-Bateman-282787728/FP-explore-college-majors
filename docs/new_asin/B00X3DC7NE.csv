7156598,5,B00X3DC7NE,"This is the only WWII movie made on active U.S. Navy Airship bases, and using active WWII U.S. Navy blimps and crews in close ups and background action. Though the action and plot is pretty much implausible, (as were many WWII morale-boasting films) the cinematography, locations and historic footage is well worthwhile the price of the DVD and the time watching.
Wallace Beery, Tom Drake, and James Gleason play their roles as expected, my favorite being James Gleason's scrappy old vet character.
Information can't be found about whether the blimp car interior sequences were shot inside an actual control car of  K-Ship or within a Hollywood mock-up. Pay attention to the detailed close-ups of the .50 cal. machine gun turret, since that footage was used as an aid in restoring the only remaining WWII K-car at the New England Air Museum.
An historic treasure and a fun film.",1459468800,2,878,4.9324324324324325
7156599,4,B00X3DC7NE,"May be the only Hollywood film showing how the US Navy used blimps in World War II.  All interior shots are in an actual K-class Navy blimp.  Majority of exterior shots are actual blimps, and only a few shots of models are used.  Family/romance plot is standard Hollywood.  Blimp combat plot is somewhat exaggerated for entertainment purposes.  Actual blimp anti-submarine work was a monotonous business.  Segment set in India is pure fiction.  Wallace Beery is fine as the Navy Chief.  He was actually commissioned as a Lieutenant Commander in the US Navy Reserve in 1933, and he was also a private pilot who flew thousands of hours in the years before World War II.",1448150400,,667,4.7894736842105265
7156600,5,B00X3DC7NE,Great flick.  Only draw back is that Wallace Barry can get on your nerves with all of his BS,1437004800,,92,3.8421052631578947

Saw it on TV many years ago.
Simple story.
But very interesting for

8714874,4,B00X3DC7NE,"Great movie.  Sadly, not burned on M-DISC

I completely understand that obscure movies like this may not economically justify pressing a disc.  However, I would have gladly paid a dollar or two more for a disc that would last forever.  Instead, they burned the movie on the old-fashioned, purple dye type disc that are only good for around 5 - 7 years. M-Disc last 100s of years.

This review is for the actual item I received from Amazon. If you are after a, ""pure movie review"", I suggest you look at the International Movie Database. There you will find many reviews without regard to the delivery mechanism.

Great Movie !!",1514246400,,627,4.654545454545454
8714875,5,B00X3DC7NE,I bought this for jan Clayton's children and they enjoyed it. I watch it about once a year.,1510272000,,91,4.111111111111111
8714876,4,B00X3DC7NE,"Wallace Berry is excellent as a lighter-than-air (blimp pilot) in the early days of WWII.  If you like B&W movies about early aviation, this is good one. Plenty of action and aviation humor, and it's a great ending!  I first viewed the movie channel surfing and only caught the last half of the film, but had to order the DVD so I could watch it with friends.",1509321600,,359,4.343283582089552
8714877,5,B00X3DC7NE,Almost a historical document! Youll never see these dirigibles in mass or how the military operated them ever again. Fair story line. Lots of sentiment. Definitely a recruiting film in Hollywood form.,1507593600,,200,5.28125
8714878,5,B00X3DC7NE,This is an of favorite of mine. Some really nice airship footage and Wallace Berry never disapoints.,1498262400,,100,4.9411764705882355
8714879,5,B00X3DC7NE,"I originally saw this movie in 1945. I had forgotten most of the plot, but remembered that Wallace Beery was the star and that it had something to do with Dirigibles. I was very interested In lighter than air at that time. I had to search for the title on the internet. I always liked Wallace Beery. In this movie, he played the type of part that I remember him perfecting: the poor guy who has to cope with situations that had not turned out the way he had wanted. I liked the movie quite a lot, but am now nearly 84 years old. I don't know how younger people will take it. I also enjoyed see a young Tom Drake and James Gleason, who specialized in portraying a person who is angry at the situation he is in and who jabs back at anybody when he gets the chance.",1489104000,,762,4.086666666666667
