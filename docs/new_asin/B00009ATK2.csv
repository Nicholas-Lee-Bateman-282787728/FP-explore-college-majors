1881918,4,B00009ATK2,A very good movie for an HBO docudrama.  It starts a little slow but other than that it was an enjoyable movie.  The production value itself was amazing and definitely reminds you that it is an HBO production.  The casting was also very good.,1431734400,,242,4.454545454545454

1881942,4,B00009ATK2,"I worked on this movie, I was just making sure I had a copy of it. So, I am a little biased because it was a fun film to work on. The story is interesting though, and the cast was great. If you are into this type of film, you should like it.",1409184000,,241,3.5660377358490565
1881943,5,B00009ATK2,I don't remember when this movie came out on cable and I don't know of anyone else who has ever heard of it.  I'm just glad that I was lucky enough to stumble upon it. This is the true story of how CNN was put on the map during the Gulf War and it's great from beginning to end. The performances are outstanding and so is the chemistry between Michael Keaton and Helena Bonham Carter.  The dialogue is satirical and clever. This is hands down one of my favorite movies.,1400112000,,469,4.2
1881944,5,B00009ATK2,Loved the pace of information along with the characters feelings building up to gulf war one. HBO did a great job.,1396656000,,114,4.476190476190476
1881945,5,B00009ATK2,This is an old favorite of mine.  Michael Keaton did an amazing job depicting the CNN producer Robert Langdon.  Put CNN on the map with the big boys of journalism,1389571200,,162,4.366666666666666
1881946,5,B00009ATK2,Great film. The while cast brought this time in history alive. Michael Keaton always makes each film he is in more electric!,1382140800,,124,4.681818181818182
1881947,4,B00009ATK2,"For those who lived through the first Gulf War, this movie will bring back memories of the TV coverage of that event. Being an HBO movie, it seems as though it didn't have as big a budget as some Hollywood blockbusters, but the acting is pretty good and the story is interesting nonetheless. At the time, nobody really knew what was going to happen and the reporters on the front line had amazing access to breaking news, but were also in a very tenuous situation. Michael Keaton makes for a very interesting lead character in this story and many of the other actors also seem well-cast. This definitely has the feel of a TV movie, but it's worth watching if you are interested in that time period.",1369526400,,698,4.503937007874016

1881949,5,B00009ATK2,very amazing what happen in gulf war with CNN.. wonder if its accurate.. over all good movie.  movie shows scenes from the war.,1362182400,,127,4.521739130434782
1881950,4,B00009ATK2,This is a gripping and enjoyable film production.  A part of history with the 1991 Gulf War and also CNN's rising into the news broadcasting world.  Michael Keaton and Helena Bonham Carter gave wonderful performances in this thriller.,1357603200,,234,5.131578947368421
1881951,5,B00009ATK2,This film makes history exciting. Seeing how close they were to the bombs going off is awesome. It shows how CNN went from a joke to the big network it is today.,1344816000,,161,4.0625

1881972,4,B00009ATK2,A very entertaining movie that is closed to what is written in the book. The events described are very interesting.,1319587200,,115,4.8

que disfruten la pelicula",1306368000,,128,4.16
1881974,3,B00009ATK2,"Reading the credits at the end of the film made sense to me of my vague but persistent feeling of disgust while watching the film.  I realized then that this was a labor of love, self-love perhaps, by Robert Wiener, veteran CNN producer, taken from his book which told the tale of his stint in Baghdad at the beginning of the First Gulf War.

I think what was the most off-putting was the idealization of the CNN crew, and especially that of Weiner.  The man is certainly a hero in his own eyes, and if you didn't quite understand that, this film will bring the point home to you.  Tough, insouciant, rule breaking, daring to go where no one else goes, etc. etc.  Haven't we seen this type before?  Over and over and over?  And then there is the love interest.  This is dangled before our eyes  with Helena Bonham Carter as the deliciously tempting fellow producer.  Wiener wears his wedding ring and tells us several times that he is married with two children.  And yet, and yet....this is war...etc. etc.

It's all been done before, elsewhere, and better.  This may be a true story but it is terribly, boringly reminiscent of many others.
And the characterization of Wiener is so self-serving that it cancels any admiration you may have felt for him.",1298073600,,1252,4.560538116591928
1881975,4,B00009ATK2,"Great movie all around, except for the fact that whoever mixed it often lost the dialogue under sound effects.  The BOOMS of war are loud, while the dialogue is soft.",1268697600,,166,4.533333333333333
1881976,5,B00009ATK2,I teach Modern American history and this film is a attention getter and conversation starter on American policy overseas. A tight blend of history and personal adventure. Highly recommended.,1267056000,,190,5.586206896551724
1881977,5,B00009ATK2,"Watch it from time to time to see if things change! It will remind you that even if the location & situation might change, the story stays the same.",1266883200,,148,4.137931034482759
1881978,5,B00009ATK2,"You've got to like Bob Weiner, at least as acted by Michael Keaton in this film. He has got a  subtley peircing sense of humor, and a gentle yet persistant way of getting what he needs to get the story for CNN, where he worked, producing, during the 1991 Gulf War.
He was sent to Iraq soon after they invaded Kuwait in 1990, and worked with his friend, coproducer Ingrid Formanack.

Formanack--Helena Bonham Carter here-is a gypsy with a sense of the ironic like Wieners, but with more of an edge. The relationship forms a counterbalance that works wonders for Live From Bagdhad. When Ingrid provokes an Iraqi goon, being a women in  a Muslem nation bold enough to say ""well f--k me with a hot poker,"" Wiener shrugs his shoulders and almost winks as if to say ""yeah, alright. Isn't she something?""

It is this kind of paitance that gets Wiener in the door with the Iraqi Minister of Information: he waits hours with a smile while other jounalists blow in and out, entitled and indignant.

Keaton's acting is smart here: his easy going way IS his agression--his foot in doors-- and makes for a fancination contradiction in the way he sketches Wiener. It is almost the antithesis of Sam Waterson playing Sid Shoenberg in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Killing-Fields/dp/B00004RF82/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Killing Fields</a>, who gets his story through bravado and confontation. Both portrails are facinating to see for the oppposite reason. I would love to hang out with Wiener in a war zone, but keep Shoenberg around for back up.

There is a reason we like to see docudramas as well as documentries. If you are watching a film about a topic, chances are it is a topic you know something about. It is the actors bringing these charactors to life that makes the film intersting, and Live From Bagdhad does this perfectly",1255046400,,1873,5.006430868167203
1881979,5,B00009ATK2,This is a great movie because it is about the first Gulf War. I think people forget what happened then and how it relates to today. It is also an interesting accounting of the beginning of 24 hour news. All actors do a great job.,1170720000,,229,4.111111111111111
1881980,3,B00009ATK2,"While this movie was well written and acted, it did strengthen my opinion about those in the media.  I know alot of people may disagree with me on this, but in this film I saw nothing more than sick, egotistical vultures scrambling around trying to find ""the next big story"" with little regard to the people they hurt.  For those of you who view the media of being comprised of elitist know-it-alls, watching this movie will assure you that your assessment is correct.

There are many examples throughout the course of the movie.  The obvious fear of the British child being held hostage by Saddam being reduced to merely being a great story.  The members of the other networks basically saying that it is their job to tell viewers what is important and why.  The CNN crew agreeing to keep quiet about atrocities they saw in Iraq and Kuwait to avoid being thrown out of the country (so much for ""we report, you decide"").  Weiner sympathizing with the Iraqi propaganda official despite the fact that a hostage he interviewed was kidnapped, most likely under the orders of the same official.  And on, and on.

Bottom line, this movie does a splendid job of showing how most of those in the media are legends in their own minds who will stop at nothing to exploit any human tragedy and suffering in the hopes of making it big, although I'm sure that this is not what the makers of the film were going for.  There is nothing honorable about them.  They were, and are, vultures.",1147910400,,1473,4.562737642585551
1881991,3,B00009ATK2,"This is probably a fairly accurate representation of how newscasters operated in Iraq during the Desert Storm War, and of how they operate in general in front-line, crisis situations. I think the movie was aiming at evoking viewers' admiration for the newscasters' courage and stamina in ""getting the story."" It was supposed to be a paean to CNN as it established itself as a credible, round-the-clock news source during this War. But for me, the movie had the opposite effect. It showed how rash and ultimately futile most of the media people's actions on the scene were.

Everyone is either on an adrenaline rush in this movie, or else is waiting it out in a tavern getting sloshed and sloppy. There is no happy in-between when any sane, informative reporting can take place. During their ""on"" periods, newscasters are seen rushing down corridors, pushing each other, jostling, jockeying to get the story before other broadcast networks can get it. And the story is usually some canned speech by Saddam Hussein or one of his cabinet members. People stoke their sense of self-importance by surrounding themselves with ringing phones. They agonize over power outages. It's all frenetic activity - signifying nothing.

Because when the War really starts, all that we get out of these many reporters' efforts are exclamations announcing another SCUD missile hit. We get ""Wow! That was a big explosion! Wow, another one! The sky is lit up!"" People risked their lives to tell the listening American public that a bomb just lit up the sky?

It seems there would have been opportunities for intrepid reporters to go out into Baghdad and get stories that would really have mattered - stories that would have enlightened the American public about the climate of opinion there, about conditions among Iraqi citizens, and about reasons for going to War or not going to War. But virtually nothing like that comes across. In the end, it all comes down to, ""Wow, that was a big one!""

So I do think this movie is worth watching, but probably not for the reasons it was made. Instead of coming away from the film with an illustration of how good and worthy our reporters are, you, like me, may come away with an illustration of how far our news coverage needs to advance in order to be a really useful tool in the democratic decision-making process.",1147305600,,2335,4.83
1881992,1,B00009ATK2,"The movie portrays a group of CNN reporters grappling with journalistic ethics and the hazards of reporting in a modern war-zone. The message the film generally sends to its audience, although a bit corny, is that nations can avoid conflict by discussion and, of course, CNN would like to be the ones to orchestrate and film it.  In the film Robert Wiener is a pushy on-location producer who is know for doing anything to get a story.  Ingrid Formanek is his assistant producer and she turns the hardened journalist away from pursuing the risky ultimate story by reminding him of his family; really pulls those heart strings huh?  As stated above the plot is beyond cheesy; it is simply Hollywood entertaining us with the typical fast love and action story. Although Mick Jackson and HBO might say differently, what happened in Baghdad was probably very different then what happened in the film.

 It was said that the art of making movies is the art of the middle.  Making a film basic enough so that most people can get the jokes and understand what is happening.  Hollywood's objective is, obviously, to make enough money to cover the cost of producing a film and at the same time to turn a profit.  So, it is understandable if not enjoyable that Mick Jackson makes the events that transpired in Baghdad into some trite love story; he is trying to appeal to a certain kind of crowd that is drawn to those tired old clichs.  It is sad that most directors are concerned with making money first and getting their messages out second.

 One thing, however, that Jackson does well is to portray the CNN reporters in his film as people with agendas.  He does not try to fool the audience by having his characters spout garbage about ""the people's right to know,"" he cuts straight to the bone with how Weiner is trying to get the ultimate story in order to advance his career. Overall the film works as an entertaining drama, but it provides surprisingly little information of the events surrounding the 1991 Gulf War.",1139356800,,2014,4.674220963172805
1881993,4,B00009ATK2,"This captured the competitiveness the networks had and still have regarding war coverage.  Michael Keaton is great as the somewhat overanxious and egotistical CNN producer Robert Weiner. As a journalist myself, I enjoyed seeing how the press would jockey for the story and try to get the fresh angle, the upperhand with the news consumer.  Helena Carter is excellent in the film in her role as a CNN co-producer, contrasting Weiner's brash ego with good old common sense.  One of the big messages in the movie is that persistence pays and CNN was the most persistent network, it appeared as the Gulf War broke out.",1129593600,,614,4.828571428571428
1881994,5,B00009ATK2,"My only problem with these reviews is calling Robert Weiner ""Bob."" He is my brother-in-law (my sister helped write the book) and he would NEVER allow anyone to call him Bob.",1128902400,,173,4.612903225806452
1881995,5,B00009ATK2,"Before I wrote my first review I had not read the book. Basically what that means is that I did not take into account what HBO would be willing to do to make the movie more palatable to an audience. The most obvious measure was inserting a hint of romance between the Micheal Keaton and Helena Bonham-Carter characters. If anything the movie follows the book pretty closely. Robert Wiener was in Iraq for many months as opposed to the films several week period, but it would not have been feasible for the film to depict this. If anything few ""liberties"" are taken and the film is all the more stronger for it.",1102377600,,610,4.455357142857143
1881996,4,B00009ATK2,"I remember well the evening Operation Desert Shield morphed into Desert Storm. Everyone knew the invasion of Iraq would come soon after Saddam Hussein failed to meet the January deadline set by President Bush. What we didn't know for sure was how soon that attack would take place. Hours after the deadline passed, American military forces unleashed a maelstrom of destruction on Iraq. Cruise missiles and bombers soared over Baghdad with impunity, and the only news network there to capture it all live was CNN. It's difficult to imagine now, but Ted Turner's cable news network was essentially an unknown entity in 1991. Most, if not all, of the on-air personnel were largely unfamiliar to the American viewer. You might watch CNN if you stumbled over it on a pass through the cable channels and saw something interesting, but you simply did not make a habit out of watching the channel regularly. Nowadays, we have a host of cable news networks drawing viewers away from ABC, NBC, and CBS in droves. The coverage provided by CNN of those bombing runs in Baghdad thirteen years ago is primarily responsible for the success of pay cable news.

""Live From Baghdad,"" a made for HBO film, revisits the events that led up to that epochal moment in television news history. CNN producer Robert Wiener (Michael Keaton) jumps all over the Iraq assignment at the channel's Atlanta headquarters, figuring that events there will soon heat up to a fever pitch and thus create career making opportunities. He brings in the brash Ingrid Formanek (Helena Bonham Carter), Judy Parker (Lili Taylor), and cameraman Mark Biello (Joshua Leonard) to assist him in digging up the dirt in Baghdad. The trip over to Iraq exhausts these pampered journalists, as does the drudgery of setting up shop. We see the intrepid reporters hiring a translator, securing lodgings, finding bugs in their hotel room, and attempting to set up contacts with the notorious Ministry of Information. As we soon learn, working as an American journalist overseas is not an easy job. First, you have to live as high on the hog as you can. After all, you're an American; no one can expect you to live in a hovel. Second, transmitting a story from a country on the brink of war is headache inducing. Third, the journalistic field is dog eat dog; if you're not working on a story every day, not finding an angle everyone else isn't working on, you may as well throw in the towel.

Well, Wiener and his associates overcome most of these difficulties. Bob even strikes up a friendship with Naji Al-Nadithi, the Iraqi in charge of dealing with foreign correspondents. Both Al-Nadithi and Wiener profess to want peace, but larger issues keep getting in the way. For example, the CNN crew convinces the Iraqi government to let them into Kuwait to cover the now infamous incubator story. Unfortunately, the reporters become the story when accusations arise that Hussein's government is using them to propagate its own version of events. A few stories dealing with American workers trapped in Iraq, and the problems at the American embassy, act as filler for the big finale. As the deadline for invasion nears, the other news agencies leave the country, but Wiener and a few members of his crew decide to stick it out. Joining them are three now famous individuals: Bernard Shaw, Peter Arnett, and John Holliman. Thanks to Wiener's deft handling of the Iraqis (or is it the other way around?), the reporters witness the air strikes raining down on Baghdad outside of their hotel room window and manage to transmit video and audio transmissions to Atlanta via a special communications gizmo. Thus CNN scooped the other networks and the rest, as they say, is history.

I generally liked ""Live From Baghdad."" Keaton and Bonham Carter do a good job with their characters, as does David Suchet as Al-Nadithi. It's always nice to see the beautiful Lili Taylor in another movie. The film portrays Peter Arnett (played by Bruce McGill) as a devil may care boozehound, a depiction that provides a few humorous scenes. Too, the special effects used to recreate the air strikes are quite frightening. Regrettably, I have a few problems with the film. My opinion of the American media systems is at an all time low, and has been for many years. I think the emphasis on churning out new stories at breakneck speed contributes to many problems, the least of which is sloppy and superficial reporting. We see that here with the incubator story. Moreover, and probably most important, is how the film attempts to portray these reporters as heroes. C'mon folks! They sat in a hotel room and stuck a camera out the window. I don't know about you, but I'd rather have that job any day compared to flying the planes over Baghdad or serving as a soldier in the ground invasion that followed the air war. The media make themselves out to be heroes because anyone else who can prove otherwise never gets airtime.

Still, I did enjoy the movie and would watch it again. HBO discs rarely offer anything in the way of extras, but this DVD does. You get cast and crew biographies and a commentary track from director Mick Jackson. I haven't subscribed to HBO for many years now, so I never heard about this film until I stumbled over it quite by accident a few months ago. I think the irony of its release date, coinciding with the second invasion of Iraq by the younger Bush in 2002, is more than amusing. I'm surprised the movie didn't engage in blatant, far left propaganda but tried to depict both sides of the conflict. Perhaps I'm wrong, and if so you should watch the movie and judge for yourself. You'll probably like it.",1094169600,,5648,4.777891504605937
1881997,4,B00009ATK2,"Yet another crisp production from HBO, a glimpse into the life and travails of reporters who covered the first Gulf War. Adapted from the memoirs of a real reporter, Bob Wiener.

  How easily this could have gone down as a lame self-aggrandizing project underwritten by one member of the Time Warner family on behalf of another. But it's riveting drama instead, with dollops of integrity thrown in for good measure.

  While the film is surely guilty of toting the CNN badge at times (it's just a TV channel folks) it does a remarkable job in capturing the grim realities of war time coverage, including many honest protrayals of the failings of the crew. The horror wreaked on Kuwait is brought back vividly during a sequence in which Wiener and his team travel to Kuwait to investigate allegations that Iraqi troops had ripped babies out of incubators as part of their plundering. Such news is hard to come by though, as is palpably evident in the hunt for that prize interview with Saddam Hussein.

  Blood-curdling mindgames, inscrutable obstacles, ethical question marks, even a romantic subplot (which I believe could have been snipped a bit) -- the movie has oodles smooshed in, most of which have a powerful ring of truth and a striking sense of authenticity, as relevant, insane, urgent as tomorrow morning's headlines.

  Heartily recommended all-round entertainer for discerning viewers.",1091577600,,1398,5.030434782608696
1881998,5,B00009ATK2,"I liked this movie and so would you. It is based on a true story of CNN heroes who are and decide to stay in Iraq during the Gulf War despite the so many risks. Their brave hearts make them the envy of every journalist from all over the world as this CNN crew is the only one that covered Gulf War - LIVE.
Michael Keaton rocks in this movie. I liked his performance here more then in the famous Batman movie or any other he played before.
I would especially and highly recommend this movie to those people who burned their own flags that represent Justice and Democracy for a scumbag such as Sadam Hussein and its loyal followers which today thanks to U.S.A are the sorest losers as they have always been. Then you'll see how ""smart"" you were to burn your own flag for someone who is a menace to the civilised world.
A must watch movie. Well done to all the people who made this great movie. Well done to CNN heroes too. CNN rocks - as always.",1081728000,,943,4.186813186813187
1881999,5,B00009ATK2,"I found the story compelling to follow, I've watched this movie 3 times and enjoyed all aspects of it. Because the characters are real (i.e. CNN's crew) it was credible. But the most moving part was the background music. This would make an awesome CD to own, ranking it right up there with Black Hawk Down Sountrack. I can't find any reference as to the availability of this in a soundtrack, but if it exists......I WANT IT!",1077667200,,424,4.51948051948052
1882000,4,B00009ATK2,"I liked this movie because I'm a news junkie and a fledgling journalist myself, but I also liked it because of the acting by the various leads. Micheal Keaton has refined the manic energy of his more extreme roles to portray go-getting CNN producer Robert Wiener. You'd never think that Helena Bonham-Carter is British, I had no idea she was this good an actress. David Suchet as the Iraqi official who heads the Ministry of Information is superb also. The rest of the cast likewise deserves a big hand.
The question is whether or not the story is accurate or if the filmakers have taken ""liberties."" I tend to think that author and scriptwriter Wiener has given himself a small pat on the back in his portrayal of himself. In the movie he starts off as a hotshot relentlessly pursuing his agenda. When he inadvertantly puts the life of an oil worker in danger he finds himself questioning his journalistic ethics as well as his own morality. Ultimately his motives are noble and he is absolved of any wrongdoing. So what's the real story? Is this realism or idealization? I'd say it's some of both. In what proportions it is hard to say exactly. I'll give the movie the benefit of the doubt.",1074816000,,1192,4.60093896713615
1882011,5,B00009ATK2,"Who would have thought that one of the best producers of quality films these days is a premium, cable television channel?  It's one thing to have terrific shows like THE SOPRANOS & CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM, but to consistently put out films that are, in most cases, better than what gets released to local movie theatres is no small feat.
With ""Live From Baghdad,"" HBO has outdone themselves, once again.  Based on a true story and a book by Robert Wiener, this film tells the story of how the 1991 Gulf War put a fledgling news network, CNN, on the map.
Wiener (played by the always excellent and underrated Michael Keaton) and his crew set up shop in Baghdad on the eve of the war and, while all the other major networks bail as the Americans eventually strike Baghdad, they make the bold decision to stay and report.
I remember, clear as day, sitting in my living room, with my father, watching the coverage of CNN that night America first attacked.  I was amazed at how daring and amazing the three reporters (John Holliman, Peter Arnett & Bernard Shaw) were at that time, as they remained in their room of the Al-Rashid hotel in downtown Baghdad with a microphone put up right by the window so that viewers could hear all the bombing.  Director Mick Johnson perfectly recreates this scene and keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat.
Keaton receives excellent support from the likes of Helena Bonham Carter (wonderful and sexy, as always), Lili Taylor and, especially, David Suchet, who plays Naji, an Iraqi gentleman from the Ministry of Information who assists Wiener and, eventually, befriends him.
Perhaps what's most effective with LIVE FROM BAGHDAD is that it doesn't take the easy way out and tell a one-sided view of the Gulf War. Nor does it let the viewer off the hook with a typical, triumphant, Hollywood ending.
While it's obvious that Wiener and crew are thrilled with what their bravery and courage has earned them, they are clearly conflicted and saddened that it took such utter death and destruction to get them such accolades.
I highly recommend listening to Mick Johnson's commentary.  It's quite fascinating and engrossing and puts things in a much different perspective by reminding us that this thrilling and action-packed story is based almost entirely on fact!
Kudos again to HBO for producing quality material like LIVE FROM BAGHDAD.  As usual, they have impeccable timing, for, as the film was about to premiere, America was on the verge of invading Iraq yet again.  This is all the more reason to view LIVE FROM BAGHDAD, for it serves as a reminder of just how daring Wiener and his crew were.
With America's current occupation of Iraq, the television coverage is constant from the likes of the three major networks, BBC, FOXNEWS, etc.  But, back in 1991, as one character in the film puts it, CNN ""owned the war.""",1073520000,,2846,4.758620689655173
1882012,3,B00009ATK2,"After Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, CNN positioned a television news team in Baghdad. When the U.S. commenced the First Gulf War in January of the following year, only CNN stayed in the Iraqi capital while all other major news organizations scuttled for cover. The executive producer of the team was Robert Weiner. LIVE FROM BAGHDAD is based on the book of the same title by Robert Weiner. The film's script is by, you guessed it, Robert Weiner. Please forgive my cynicism if I think this film a self-congratulatory spasm.
Perhaps the main reason to view LIVE FROM BAGHDAD is to watch Michael Keaton play Weiner. Keaton's film career began about the same time as that of Tom Hanks, yet the latter has completely eclipsed the former. Yet I wonder why this should be so since Keaton is a fine actor. We don't see enough of him on the Big Screen (much less the Small Screen that hosted this HBO production).
Helena Bonham Carter plays Ingrid Formanek, Weiner's co-producer, a role incorporated into the script for completeness, but which otherwise left me at a loss to appreciate. Early on, Weiner declares to his boss that he and Formanek are bitter rivals. Yet, the two are apparently soft on each other, a state of affairs resulting from the two of them having gotten drunk together in ten different countries while on assignment. But there's never any real chemistry between the two, and Ingrid's occasional brilliant but enigmatic smile just isn't enough to carry the character.
Most of the film is contrived suspense as the CNN team works around, or is manipulated by, the Iraqi Ministry of Information. At one point, Information Minister Naji Al-Hadithi, wonderfully played by David Suchet, cunningly uses Weiner and his crew to refute rumors that Iraqi troops had torn Kuwaiti babies from hospital incubators. (I mention this because that ""atrocity"" has since been revealed to have been anti-Iraqi war propaganda falsely manufactured by the Kuwaitis.) In any case, most of the film's excitement occurs at the end as CNN correspondents Peter Arnett (Bruce McGill) and John Holliman (John Lynch) eyewitness report U.S. bombing of Baghdad on the first night of the war. The pyrotechnics are spectacular.
History marches on, and America, having since toppled Saddam, is now militarily mired in a wretched place. The biggest problem with this film is that the Second Gulf War has made any news of the First pass&eacute;. Does anybody care at this late date besides Robert Weiner and CNN?",1061683200,,2486,4.94976076555024
1882013,4,B00009ATK2,"From the opening frames of Michael Keaton trying to weasel his way into what he suspects will become the assignment of a lifetime, this production of CNN producer Robert Wiener's best-selling book, ""Live from Baghdad"" is a tightly shot, nerve-racking melodrama depicting how the CNN team bribed, cajoled and maneuvered their way into the story about the road to war in Iraq in 1990-91 and wound up being the only news network to cover the actual outbreak of the American bombing campaign. In the process they also single-handedly vaulted the reputation and stature of CNN into becoming the premier news source for the world at large. In one provocative scene, it shows the eyes of Saddam Hussein and George Bush after the first night of the war, both of them focused on the TV screen before them, tuned in to CNN.
Wiener literally sneaks the small and ill-regarded CNN team into Baghdad after the invasion of Iraqi forces into Kuwait amid threats form American President George Bush that the Iraqi invasion meant a certain American military response with an international coalition. Keaton plays the ambitious and neurotically-driven Wiener quite well, and he has an excellent leading lady by way of Helena Bonhan Carter, playing his erstwhile assistant producer, Ingrid Formanek. By far the most interesting character depicted is the Iraqi Information Minister Naji, is played to perfection by David Suchet (of Poirot fame on BBC TV). What ensues is a clever and dangerous `cat and mouse' game in which Wiener takes what victories as can be grabbed and dispersed over the secure lines he has conned the Iraqis into allowing. For example, they film Saddam's frightening interview with a young British boy, and without any voice over, catch the essence of the extreme fear of the boy in a way that both electrifies the world wide audience into understanding how horrific Saddam is and puts the lie to the idea that such hostages were merely the ""guests ""of the regime.
But the CNN team is manipulated and used by the Iraqis as well. In one particularly telling case, they are allowed to go to Kuwait city to interview doctors to quell the rumors of Iraqi soldiers having stolen incubators while leaving infants dying on the cold hospital ward floors. At the hospital, Wiener discovers the doctor is trembling with fear, an indication that the whole interview is a set-up, and when he attempts to alter the situation, finds himself and the crew forcibly ejected and manhandled back into the escort vehicles and quickly flown back to Baghdad. Arriving back in the city, he finds a nightmare situation; the Iraqis have meanwhile already leaked the news story they want, that being that the CNN team had found no evidence of the stolen incubators in Kuwait. Suddenly, the CNN team becomes the story of the day rather than just reporting it.
The final scenes leading to the initial American bombing attacks are accurate, well-produced, and nerve-shattering, as the team finds itself alone in the hotel and free to report the exclusive unfolding story of the invasion with an incredible job of voice-over reporting `live from Baghdad"". The film is a thought-provoking production, and the ""location shots"" are quite realistic and very believable as being Baghdad, which obviously they were not. The panorama provided of the aftermath of the first night's bombing is horrific, and clearly portray the cruel and savage nature of modern warfare. While the movie pulls no punches, it is fairly apolitical, sticking to the basic story of how it is that CNN came to be the sole source of news for the first few days of the war, and how that happenstance launched CNN into becoming the news organization it is today.

It brings to life what was going on over there. I was 15 when I was watching The Gulf War on TV... It was scary, but at that age I didn't understand. I'm glad to learn the truth in history, especially from movies. I felt the same about the movie ""Thirteen Days"". Keep bringing those movies that teach us our own history.

I watched the first gulf war on tv as a kid and learned about it live from the reporters showcased in this movie.  Looking back and watching it now, after having participated in the latest war in Iraq, it strikes me how little has changed.
