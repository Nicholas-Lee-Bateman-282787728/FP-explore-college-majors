8331651,5,B001OWQBY2,"On a flight about a year ago, I watched this movie ""10 Promises to My Dog"".  I really enjoyed it despite the fact that it was in Japanese and therefore subtitled.  Normally I hate watching a movie with subtitles but this particular movie was different.  I had to keep watching it.  It is quite sad but in a nice way - I would not consider it depressing even though it is impossible not to cry.  Anyone who loves dogs should watch this movie.",1242086400,3,441,4.265060240963855
