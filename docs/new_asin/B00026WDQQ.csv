8022978,5,B00026WDQQ,This is a low budget film that es rescued quickly by Gloria Trevi's charisma. This is actually a very entertaining movie. her other two are better but this is fantastic to watch.,1270339200,,178,4.59375
8022979,3,B00026WDQQ,"As truly reported by G Trevi  herself, this made was quickly made and it shows... poor image quality and some bad takes kept anyaway... still the film is a big hit due to the huge success of the raising star, eveybody wanted to see her if not  live in a concert  at least on film! and that is what the film delivers: songs in the middle of a poor plot.",1173398400,2,352,4.0
8022980,5,B00026WDQQ,"This film brings back so many memories for me. It was a time when a latin star was REALLY about to explode! It was a time when dreams can come true and there she was proving just that!

It's very nostalgic for me to have this and I'm glad it was released on DVD.

This is her best film to date! Her other ones are O.K. particularly Zapatos Viejos. La papa sin catsup was just a mess I'm sorry to say. But this one ""pelo suelto"" is where everything was fresh for her and her acting albeit at times not very good was still spontaneous and even funny. It didn't seem as forced as it was on her next couple of films particularly her last one.

Give it a try and have fun with it because that was really the intention of the film I believe.",1138233600,,735,4.02054794520548
8022981,5,B00026WDQQ,"THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT GLORIA TREVI IS AND WILL BE AN INTERNATIONAL STAR, AND IN PELO SUELTO SHOWS WHY. THE MOVIE A BASED IN HER TRUE STORY MIX WITH FICTION, AND IS GREAT TO HAVE TREVI'S FIRST SONGS ON A MOVIE, WHO CAN FORGET PELO SUELTO, NO SE QUE VOY A HACER SIN EL AND AGARRATE FROM HER 5 STAR CD TU ANGEL DE LA GUARDA, THE MOVIE WAS A BIG HIT ON THE BIG SCREEN WHEN MOVIES WERE NOT MAKING ANY MONEY IN HER HOME COUNTRY MEXICO,IT BROUGHT PEOPLE BACK TO THE MOVIES.YOU SHOULD GET THIS DVD, IT IS GREAT TO SEE GLORIA SING HER BIG HITS, SINCE SHE'S NOT THE KIND OF ARTIST THAT FILMS A MUSIC VIDEO FOR EVERY SONG SHE RECORDS. YOU SHOULD ALSO CHECK HER FOLLOW UP MOVIES ZAPATOS VIEJOS AND UNA PAPA SIN CAPSUP, BOTH MOVIES WILL SHOW GLORIA TREVI'S GREAT SONGS. TREVI ROCKS!!!!!!",1130803200,3,775,4.139072847682119
