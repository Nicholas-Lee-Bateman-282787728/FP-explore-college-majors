8030724,1,B0002Q9VGQ,"I don't understand how people can find these movies funny.

I enjoy a crude comedy as well as the high-brow stuff, having been raised on ANIMAL HOUSE and CADDYSHACK and AIRPLANE!

But the Broken Lizard movies are just lame and laughless.  I realize that humor is very subjective...but these movies are horrible.  I laughed once in SUPER TROOPERS (that's one more laugh than I had for THE WATERBOY or any Kevin Smith film).  I've caught most of CLUB DREAD on cable and, though the blonde chick is smokin' hot, the movie just lays there like a dead teen in a slasher film.

Their latest film, BEER FEST or something, is being advertised as a worthy successor to SUPER TROOPERS, CLUB DREAD and Broken Lizard's last masterpiece, THE DUKES OF HAZZARD.

At least they're consistent.",1156723200,2,776,4.746268656716418
