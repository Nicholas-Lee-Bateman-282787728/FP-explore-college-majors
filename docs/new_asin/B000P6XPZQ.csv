2812274,5,B000P6XPZQ,There are a few things anime can do better than any other entertainment medium and this anime proves it. Good heart and laughs with unique risky love and interesting setup. One of my personal top ten favorites. Moto like this! Moto!,1268352000,,232,4.682926829268292
2812275,5,B000P6XPZQ,"A very funny comedy about a newly graduated gym teacher trying to find a job.  Unfortunately he doesn't have much luck finding a job and he finally runs out of money about the time he gets an apartment near a junior high school. He's determined to get a job there as a gym teacher but the school has a principal and vice-principal who are misandrists, being very prejudiced against men and refuse to hire them as teachers.

Fortunately for the main character, Hibiki, when he expresses his determination to get a job there in spite of that, his new landlady offers to help him get that job by teaching him how to dress and act just like a woman so the principal will hire him.  After some ""hard knocks"" training from his landlady, he lands the gym teacher job as a woman gym teacher.  From there on things start to get really funny as he gets caught up in all kinds of ticklish situations while trying to hide his true gender and also do his best to care about all his students while trying to teach them the really important things in life like responsibility, true friendship, selflessness, commitment, honesty, courage, acceptance of differences, compassion and heart.

There are a lot of laughs in this series but also a lot of heart and some good life lessons as well as some really touching moments.  While the ending may seem bitter-sweet, it offers hope for the future for the two main characters.  Definitely a series that is worth the time and money.  It's unfortunate they didn't make a sequel.

Sound and video quality in this particular collection are excellent.

If you enjoyed the movie Tootsie, you'll probably enjoy this series too.",1261526400,5,1649,4.655172413793103
2812276,4,B000P6XPZQ,"While browsing for new anime boxed sets at a store in Van Nuys, the clerk suggested I try watching each volume of this show at their shop, should I buy the lot. You see, after finishing the complete Fruits Basket DVD boxed set that I bought from that same shop earlier, I went back for similar anime genres.

I, My, Me Strawberry Eggs was truly an enjoyable series but not exactly one you'd watch over and over again.  Unlike the light blend of Fruits Basket, this series is more about a male teacher who recently finished his degree and out to get his first job so he could pay his rent at a nearby apartment. And, if luck would have it, the old landlady have the knack of using a wide variety of tools when collecting rent from its tenants. Regrettably, the nearby high school institution only accepts FEMALE teachers, so that made Hibiki Amawa more at a loss.

At that point his landlady (who used to be an electronics expert, but then retired) offered to help Hibiki become a ""woman"". Teaching him how a woman walks (on heels), and equips him with a removable set of chests and a voice-altering device disguised as a choker to change his male baritone into a woman's alto. Not bad, since he's neither stocky enough nor have that extra weight (consistent to most men) but of slim-built. Passing up as a lady teacher turned up a success. After that, the fun begins with ticklish situations that would break anyone other than him (for real).

H-things must be pretty common to a whole lot of shoujo anime shows from Japan, although they're mostly incidental in this series. More of a character's clumsiness than done purposefully. It's a bit similar to Gakuen Heaven but less the H-ness of its male teachers. Here, it's only Hibiki acting as the new homeroom teacher doing a woman's job.

For those of you who doesn't mind gender-bending situations or light H scenes, this is a nice show to watch. The creators should release a continuation of the series (or 2nd season) since the ending of this set proved somewhat lacking. It's good for most of the volumes but, like most anime shows, you'll also find some disagreeable characters included in. Maybe such improve unfunny parts, but not to me. You go rent it out if you're not sure about buying the whole thing. Relax and enjoy!  :)",1200441600,8,2284,4.58578431372549

8189546,5,B000P6XPZQ,"Great Show,  Is a classic Comedy that most anime fans will enjoy.",1405382400,,65,4.416666666666667
8189547,4,B000P6XPZQ,Used to see a little of this anime back when I was in college and anime was just a new thing.  The series was hilarious and I can find enjoyment from it.  Though it can't hold a candle to anime now but back when this just came out it was like Wow!,1397865600,,247,3.730769230769231
8189548,5,B000P6XPZQ,"Not my usual taste in anime, but the be true to yourself message is just too good to miss out on.  Wholesome depiction of he standard difficulties and questions often asked by many of us of all ages.

Even if you turn around and resell, it's worth a single watching.",1387152000,,266,4.3
8189549,5,B000P6XPZQ,"Funny, respectful, and unique as a story line. If you not into gender bent story lines you will not like it. But I enjoyed it.",1357516800,,126,4.08
8189550,4,B000P6XPZQ,"A friend suggested this (for me) when I was looking at anime to give my mother.  I enjoyed the series but decided not to share this one with mom (bought Fruits Baskets for her, which I preferred to Strawberry Eggs.)  This anime has the feel of a children's show but with content aimed at a more mature audience.  It is a well done series with a good message, if you can get past the numerous quirky, taboo and somewhat unsettling plot points.",1325721600,2,442,4.365853658536586
8189551,5,B000P6XPZQ,"Ok I absoulutly love this anime. In my oppinion, it would be one of my top 5 all time favs. So obviously I was giddy to get the series in a complete boxset form.

The box seems pretty durable and is a seethru plastic. The only thing strange for mine at least is that disc 2 is under pionear instead of Genon, which is funny to look at, seeing those big G's and then a little pionear. XD

Back to the anime... Pretty much if your looking for a laugh and like gender confusion. Then this is for you. Fuko is adorable and the situations are hilariouse. Your going to want to watch it again and again and alway's wish there was more.",1321574400,,629,4.105691056910569
8189552,1,B000P6XPZQ,"This series isn't really my cup of tea it was cute and funny but the concept was a bit strange.

A man poses as a woman to get a job at an all girls school if it sounds cool check it out if not Id stay away theres not much here for people who aren't fans of crossdressing.",1305244800,,272,3.689655172413793
8189553,4,B000P6XPZQ,"Excellent service from a company looking to keep their customer's happy.  Would definately use them again if they openned up their selection a bit more.  Oh well.

What can I say about the product that is not already been said.  It is a well thought out story of a teacher student relationship and how one grows to depend on the other as much as the other parts.  How in a society strict on disciplin and honor within its schools, it allows a peek at what it is like to see a person struggle to find work and having to hide their real personna simply to get a job.  Something can be said about how society treated the individual and those similar to the teacher, whether in fantasy, fiction, or plain old real life.",1287100800,,715,4.338345864661654
8189554,5,B000P6XPZQ,"Like the other reviewers have said this anime begins with an improbable situation (as most do) and comes around to a rather serious conclusion. There are many tropes to be found in the story such as the man hating principle, sycophant assistant principle, the (annoyingly) cute girl, the tough guy (with the heart of gold), the school uniform obsessed guys, and so on. To be honest I was kind of disturbed by the various pantsu shots (as these girls are supposed to be only 13 to 14 years old) but there were not too many of them. the love quadrangle towards the end is done pretty well, in fact the story telling was not all that bad considering that this is supposed to be a comedy. The only problem I had with the entire series was with the ending. I do not want to give too much away but if you are looking for a happy or uplifting ending - keep searching. Overall I really enjoyed the series and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a bit of light-hearted fun with a ""realistic"" ending.",1282262400,2,1002,4.363636363636363
