3699964,4,B001MT7ZJW,"I picked up a few of these Goosebumps dvd's be ause i was born in 1990 and i like to go trip down memory lane,plus my kids 1 day will enjoy them as my nieces enjoy them.
The episodes here are 1. The Scarecrow Walks at Midnight 2. Don't go to Sleep & 3. Calling all Creeps. The first and third elisodes are the best while the second one seems goofy,even by the standards for a show that cost 90bux an episode to make. But i think there great becase they are cheesey & yea i grew up on em. So on Halloween pull these dvds out & reminisce about your childhood when you watched it & show your kids how cool the show was. R.L Stine is the Stephen King of childrens books.
Scarecrow has to do with these 2 kids goin to their grandparents for the summer but things seem strange,the farmhand is into black magic and the scarecrows he raised or summoned and they walk at midnight...
Don't go to Sleep a kid thinks being 8 sucks so he has a crazy dream & he wakes up glad he doesn't have to make adult decisions
Calling all Creeps is where a kid wants revenge on a girl bullying him so he puts her number on a piece of paper with a message stating...you guessex calling all creeps,are you a creep? Call.... and then aliens actually keep calling him thinking he is their leader and they have  been waiting to strike.",1423699200,2,1305,4.158102766798419

3699967,5,B001MT7ZJW,Great,1412640000,,5,5.0
3699968,5,B001MT7ZJW,best scare of the RL Stine movies. This movie is a more scare with your imagination movie that even gets to adults until they show Scarecrow.,1392249600,,141,4.461538461538462
3699979,3,B001MT7ZJW,"I bought this for my kids as a creepy but not terrifying video to watch around Halloween time. It's made for TV acting, so not the greatest, but fun for kids especially if you've read and enjoyed the Goosebumps Series by R.S. Stine",1387843200,,231,4.395348837209302
3699980,4,B001MT7ZJW,"The best one in this set is The Scarecrow Walks at Midnight, I give it 5 stars! The episode about a boy who publishes an ad in the school newspaper, hoping to get revenge against the kids who are picking on him is pretty good too, I give it 4 stars. The last episode wasn't good at all to me, I found it boring.",1374537600,,311,3.875
3699981,4,B001MT7ZJW,I bought this for my Grand kids to watch when they come to visit. They enjoyed this. It dumb on an adult level but just right for a child or most children. I had one who didn't like it because it scared her but not to the point of nightmares. but the rest never moved till it was over!,1364428800,,285,3.847457627118644
3699982,5,B001MT7ZJW,"Bought this for the grandaughter and she loved it .I do this every Halloween for her instead of candy, the neighbor kids enjoy watching with her.",1355097600,,145,4.615384615384615
3699983,5,B001MT7ZJW,Ordered this and several other Goosebumps movies for viewing during Halloween. Scary but not too much for younger children. Always entertaining on a car trip and keeps the young ones quiet while watching.,1351555200,,204,5.212121212121212
3699984,5,B001MT7ZJW,"The Goosebumps series consisted of low-budget special effects, bad acting, and a cut-down story due to being only 22 to 44 minutes.

The episodes on this single disc are:

The Scarecrow Walks at Midnight - Jodie and Mark are visiting their grandparent's farm, when twelve odd scarecrows show up.

Don't Go to Sleep - Matt Amsterdam wakes up from a nap to find out that his whole reality has changed.

Calling All Creeps - Ricky Beamer wants revenge on a mean girl at school. He puts her phone number in an ad for all creeps to call her, but he wasn't expecting non-humans to reply.

These three tales are some of the best of the Goosebumps series. Don't Go to Sleep reminds me of an episode of the X-files, The Scarecrow Walks at Midnight is creepy, and Calling All Creeps is insane!",1346457600,,783,4.485915492957746
3699985,4,B001MT7ZJW,Everything I show any of these shows to children they all just stop and stare. It is not to scary and good mysteries.,1291852800,,117,4.130434782608695
3699986,4,B001MT7ZJW,"The kids liked this one a lot. Only one part really spooked them. If you have kids around the 1st thru 6th grades, that's about the age range on this one.",1268956800,,154,4.0
3699987,4,B001MT7ZJW,"The R.L. Stine ""Goosebumps"" book series has been popular for years, and my three children enjoy watching the new series on DVD.  This disc contains three scary episodes: ""The Scarecrow Walks at Midnight"", ""Don't go to Sleep"", and ""Calling all Creeps"".

In the first episode, Jodie and Mark go to their grandparents' farm to spend the summer.  Upon arriving, the children sense something different from the times they were there previously.  The field is full of scary scarecrows, plus, the hired hand is acting very strangely.  But, the terror begins when the scarecrows come to life!

In episode two, Mark Amsterdam is jealous of his older brother and sister getting to do whatever they wish.  Mark wants to move his bedroom to the upstairs attic.  Before moving, he goes to the attic and falls asleep.  During his nap, he has a strange dream that convinces him that things are better they way they are.

In the final episode, Ricky Beamer publishes an ad in the school newspaper, hoping to get revenge against the kids who are picking on him.  Unfortunately, someone changes the ad, and now Ricky is the one getting strange phonecalls late at night.

My children and I really enjoy the ""Goosebumps"" series.  The stories are scary, but not so much as to really frighten young children.  The episodes are short, so the kids maintain their attention throughout.  If you want a good, fun scare, then check out this great DVD, as well as others in the series.",1256083200,9,1456,4.768

8321743,5,B001MT7ZJW,"The Scarecrow Walks At Midnight (based on the book by R.L. Stine) is one of my favorite episodes of the Canadian TV show ''Goosebumps''. It's a great episode with some freaky and disturbing moments. It's well written, well directed, and Heather Bertram gives a great performance as Jodie.

This DVD is perfect for Halloween, and I highly recommend it.",1504828800,,351,4.9491525423728815
