8693846,4,B00R26E902,"Very silly caper movie that wears its heart on its sleeve. There's a lot that happens in its lean run time of 69 mins, almost at a breakneck pace not slowing down for an instant from the get go. Got some funny lines and plenty of situations that border on slapstick. But its Rodney the superbly well-trained Doberman that steals the show and is the true star of this enjoyable flick. Allyn Joslyn's character plays out like a doofus while Carole Landis is pure class. Don't look for cinematic excellence here, just play along with the spirited cast lead ably by a K9 and you'll secure your money's worth. Print's in good condition - there are the occasional specks, scratches, splices everything that characterizes a film of this age but none of these visual anomalies prevents one from enjoying this light-hearted  fare. Audio is fine as well with very little hiss and good fidelity for a film that's not been subject to any kind of restoration (which is why its on a MOD DVD-R from the Archives collection). If you have a pooch(es) as companions, there's no way you will not enjoy the very well-trained Doberman. 4 woofs outa 5 !",1501804800,,1131,4.626865671641791
8693847,5,B00R26E902,"Carole Landis was one of the 1940s most beautiful and talented stars. Sadly she committed suicide just two years after she made this film. It Shouldn't Happen To A Dog is not the greatest movie she ever made but it's a fun comedy and Carole gives a wonderful performance. She plays a female police detective (unusual for 1946) whose partner is a very smart and well trained Doberman. William Gargan plays a reporter trying to solve a crime - he becomes her love interest. The plot is a little silly - there is a mix-up over a robbery and Rodney runs away only to be found by a mobster. Rodney of course steals every scene he is in! The supporting cast includes the lovely Jean Wallace and Harry Morgan. This was Carole's last film at Fox and if you're a fan you should watch it.

Thank you Fox Archives for putting more of Carole's films on DVD!",1419638400,8,845,4.382165605095541
