7966285,5,B00006ADDC,Was sent promptly and the film worked great. It was still in the shrink wrap and everything. Very satisfied.,1433808000,,108,4.7368421052631575
7966286,4,B00006ADDC,"Victor Frankenstein only wanted to restore his family's name after generations of failure... His newest creation, however, is anything but perfect. ""Frank"" has quite a bit of learning to do as he tries to adjust to modern living, but when driving lessons and love making prove to be a bit... complicated given his ""condition,"" the monster leaves to find his place in the world. Alain Jessua's quirky French comedy FRANKENSTEIN 90 is quite unlike any other take on Mary Shelley's classic tale. Eddy Mitchell carries the bulk of the picture through his endearing performance, bringing Frank to life with his subtle mannerisms and clever comedic timing. The tragedy that accompanies Frank's unusual size and strength makes for many memorable moments. Jean Rochefort is also quite funny as the hopelessly ambitious Dr. Frankenstein, who is caught in a constant struggle between his obligations to the family trade and his neglected responsibilities as a loving husband. Jessua's particular brand of humor will not suit all tastes, but those who are interested in a unique new twist on FRANKENSTEIN will be right at home in FRANKENSTEIN 90.

7966287,3,B00006ADDC,"Alain Jessua is one of the few French filmmakers have to work in the genre of fantasy films, with varying degrees of success. Sometimes very inspired like LES CHIENS, it borders on absolute ratage with LES COULEURS DU DIABLE, his last film. With his version of Frankenstein, it is rather on the side of failure, but the film is primarily a sketch, a comedy that takes the Frankenstein myth on modern fashion and comic willingly. Baron is played by Jean Rochefort and the creature by Eddy Mitchell, a french rock star.",1357344000,,517,4.6923076923076925
7966288,4,B00006ADDC,"Being a film fan,and having a large interest in the Frankenstein legend,having seen most film versions there are,I had to see this film.

Practically forgotten,this French comedy is not really a sequel to any previous Frankenstein,but rather a bloody and nudity filled film that melds elements of outrageous Horror of the 80s with Romantic comedy and a large touch of Young Frankenstein(1974).

In this film,a descendent of Frankenstein is still experimenting on the thing that has made his name infamous,but with somewhat different results.

The Man that Frankenstein creates is actually cared for and nurtured by the doctor,and is basically a decent fellow who,like all Frankenstein Monsters,just wants to have someone to love.

Eddy Mitchell does not quite look the part of Monster,but is likeable and does gain audience sympathy.
However,this Frankenstein Monster also has no clue of his strength and does have bouts of murderous rage every so often!
Still we root for him anyway!

An interesting plot twist takes place,wherein after the creation of the female monster(whose parts are found in a strip club),the Monster realizes he dosen't love her(she's kind of a nympho)and has the hots for the doctor's very cute girlfriend instead.

With the police closing in on him and so much anxiety building,this causes him to run away to the original Frankenstein castle.

This part is one of the most poignant moments in Frankenstein film,as the Monster discovers the old laboratory and the resting place of the beloved Original Monster(who rests in a Karloff,complete with Karloffian makeup....my question? How did they manage to BURY the big guy?)

This film has an ending that should please all those FRANKENSTEIN fans who wished that things could end well for once for the Frankenstein family.

Alot of fun and a delight for fans of the genre.",1228608000,2,1845,5.1644295302013425
7966289,5,B00006ADDC,"Great job Anchor Bay!!! This cult classic looks great on DVD!!! A great French version of a Frankenstien story,pretty strange indeed but still a great little cult film,not for everyone's taste!!!  But Anchor Bay has always done a great job releasing great hard to find horror films!!! A+",1219536000,3,287,4.979166666666667
7966290,5,B00006ADDC,"I thought this was a pretty cool sequel. It shows you what happens when the French take on Hollywood's biggest star. A few years after Frankenstein and the monster from hell(I think)someone has decided to make his own Frankenstein. Once he does, there actully pretty good friends at first. Later Frankenstein goes a little crazy and goes on beating people up. He later meets a new sientest, who makes him a female partner(the female was pretty cute, unlike the guy). After a big fight with the police, Frankenstien is wanted by the goverment even more. So he goes up to the castle of Frankenstein the first( the one we all know and love from the first film) were his girlfriend finds him. I'm not going to spoil anything else, you'll have to se the movie to find more out! The film has a French look which I thought was a cool change. I perfer the American and Britsh Frankenstein over French but this is still a good film. The MPPA did not give this a rating, so I will
Rated R for Violence and Nudity",1085184000,5,1002,4.421621621621622
