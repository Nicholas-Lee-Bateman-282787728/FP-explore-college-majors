8480330,5,B005NCLL94,How refreshing!  So many resources want to focus on the methods instead of focusing on creating the right culture for healthy growth.  The culture you create will determine what grows in the culture.  What you attract people with is what you'll have to continue to provide to them to keep them.

8480332,5,B005NCLL94,"CULTURES: 3 Cultures Necessary for a Church to Grow are Prayer, Change, and Ministry to Young Families.  In this DVD, Dick breaks down to us why each is so important and why they must remain a constant in our ministry efforts.  A church without prayer is a body without a brain or blood.  A church without change is a body that dwarfs from lack of growth.  A church without ministry to young families is a body with a young expiration date that will die before its time.  All three will drastically affect a church's quality of life and very possibly kill it all together.  3 Cultures Necessary for a Church to Grow will help you to avoid these downfalls.",1322524800,,655,4.46218487394958

8480336,5,B005NCLL94,I'm fascinated with the concept of 'culture' as it relates to the local church. Dick Hardy highlights 3 aspects of a culture to build in the local church to achieve kingdom purposes. He is practical yet profound in explaining these cultures and in providing a manual to assist in leader dialogue with the goal of implementation. I highly recommend this coaching material.,1322438400,,371,5.0
8480337,5,B005NCLL94,"Dear Pastor/leader,

I cannot express enough to you the value of this material.  We purchased the entire series for our staff in Mid August at the teaser price.  What interested me was the true coaching approach that is part of each package.  My plan was to use it as enrichment on our annual planning work-away the following month.  I believed that we could plow through them while we were away.  WOW! was I wrong on that one.  The material is so relevant, so thought provoking that we only got through one of them, but was it a wonderful ride.  Discussion was deep due to the excellent coaching questions asked.  Certainly one of the greatest aspects was the application/action questions that served to put calendared legs on the discussion.  The team could see it before them.  We are not just fleshing this out as a church, but each ministry is doing it as well.

I must say that if the other packages in the series are anything like this package [and they are I have looked ahead] we have a years work of priceless, relevant discussion and action ahead.  Blend that with asserted prayer that binds it all together and keeps it on course, and you have a winning combination!

No matter the size of your church, you will find this material excellent for your teams.  Additionally, I serve as the Presbyter for the N.E. part of our State. I am planning in 2012 to help make this resource available to our pastors by direct training workshops and direct purchases.  Dick and team are also working on other levels via the internet to assist our Sectional pastors beyond the materials.

The Hardy Group has hit a home run here.  Pastor/leader could not ask for a more genuinely caring, interested and experienced team to work with your team.

From one leader to another,

Make the investment!

8480338,5,B005NCLL94,"""You can have all the elements in place for your garden, but if you don't work hard for the garden, having those elements doesn't guarantee it will grow.""  In this ten-minute video, Dick Hardy discusses the three cultures necessary for a church to grow.  His disclaimer that these three cultures do not guarantee growth was appreciated.  Rather, he guaranteed that the lack of these three cultures would cause non-growth.

Much like a garden, growing and maintaining a church takes work and time.  It cannot happen overnight.  However, this video and the workbook serve as yet another tool in cultivating our ministries.  Pick up this video and find out which three cultures are necessary to produce a good soil for growth.  From there, start working... and make it happen!",1321228800,,773,4.984375
