8455013,5,B00535V4UC,"I had encountered a superb deal at amazon.com for this product: Le Cronache Di Narnia - Il Viaggio Del Veliero (3D) (Blu-Ray 3D+Blu-Ray+Dvd+Digital Copy) and watching it at ""Reggun Theatre"" which comprises of my Panasonic Vierra 145CM 3D FUll HD PLASMA; a  Panasonic 3D Blu-ray Disc PLAYER/RECORDER- DMRBWT800GL; and a 7.1 Surround Sound System SONY 7.1CH 3D READY AV RECEIVER SKU: STRDH520.  Watching this movie in 3D is as if I was just like being in the theater again. The visual high quality is just incredible. To Amazon.com customers who have a 3D-capable home theater or any type of 3D capable HDTV (Smart TV or not), this is the version you need to get and it includes a 2D Blue-Ray copy as well as standard DVD.  Since I upgraded to 3D, I found it futile to watch normal DVDs ; mostly now I only do purchase Real 3D movies; and my collection is expanding and if those 3D are from amazon.com it's worth the expenses. Beware, this
type of 3D experience can only be with Real 3D Blu-ray not 3-D DVD as the latter is for Anaglyph
3-D red-and-blue glasses viewing ie. Plastic Glasses (Definitely Not 3DTV Blu-Ray Technology).
