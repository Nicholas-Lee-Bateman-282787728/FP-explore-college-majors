8031009,3,B0002RQOVA,"I purchased this DVD to become more familiar with wedding videography.  First, the material is dated.  Some of the camera models shown are probably[...] or older.  Some of the wedding video samples that are used to emphasize points are definitely taken in early 90's.  There is 1 great sample video but no discussion is made on how the videographer actually shot or assembled the footage, only that ""you can do various things in post production with an NLE (non-linear editor)"".

The instructors explain what basic equipment you will need to shoot a wedding (tripod, wireless mic system), and to show up for the rehearsal so you'll know where you can place your camera during the ceremony to avoid problems.  Other than a handful of tips like this, there are no real tips or advice given on how to creatively shoot a wedding video - other than to take a shot of the cake, flowers and don't use the zoom too much.

In my opinion, the video is very pricey given the dated material, format of delivery and amount of content included.",1226361600,9,1030,4.657458563535911
8031010,5,B0002RQOVA,"The Dean of videouniversity.com, Hal Landen, has produced an essential instructional video for wedding videographers.  Here you will see some of the best wedding footage from two of country's best videographers, Terry Taravella and Joel Peregrine.  The nearly two-hour long DVD is organized into eleven chapters, plus it has a generous amount of breathtaking scenes from every aspect of the wedding day.

The DVD opens with beautiful bridal prep footage shot by Taravella.  It has slow motion, romantic music and even a shot of a dad overcome with emotion when he sees his daughter in her wedding gown.  Then we see Peregrine's beautiful opening montage with soft-focus effects, film color effects and slow motion.  This sets a heartwarming emotion and demonstrates how a professionally-produced wedding DVD can look like a cinematic masterpiece.

Somewhat abruptly, the video cuts to a studio shot of the two on-camera narrators.  Their style is much like a corporate training video - fact-filled but without emotion.  The DVD includes plenty of the beautiful footage from Taravella and Peregrine, as the narrators talk, but there is an incongruity between these two different emotional levels.

Fortunately they present plenty of content that could benefit both the seasoned pro and the beginning videographer. Using spectacular wedding footage, they demonstrate essential camera angles and show how to use multiple mikes. They list important B-roll to capture, they emphasize to attend a rehearsal, and they have a good suggestion for an alternative to interviews.  You will see examples of an opening montage, highlights, ceremony, reception, bridal party, and bride and groom interviews. The DVD lists the five keys to successful shoots and the four reasons how a wedding video could fail.

This is a professionally produced DVD with plenty of chapters and a ton of footage from two of the giants in the industry.  The narrators recommend that you produce low-volume, high-budget wedding videos, and they emphasize that you can do this without having to purchase top-end video gear.  This very thorough DVD equips you with an arsenal of techniques that will help you to shoot and edit beautiful videos that families will cherish for years to come.",1207526400,8,2252,5.271708683473389
8031011,5,B0002RQOVA,"This DVD covers all of the aspects for a typical wedding.  The information on equipment is very good with details about microphones and types of cameras.
The area on editing is a little weak, but then editing is a personal style.  They stress to the viewer that when you tape a wedding try not to make a work of art, but a documentary of the event.  The artistic aspects can come later.
I found it very informative and will use it as a refresher from time to time.",1188432000,7,464,4.25
