8303291,4,B001G0KB7U,I got this movie because the director is going to be the videographer at my wedding.  It's actually a lot better than I expected it to be.  Typical girl meets boy movie...until the girl meets another boy.  I'll leave it at that.  My fiance and I did enjoy watching it.  Had some great lines in it.,1249257600,,297,4.232142857142857
8303292,5,B001G0KB7U,"I loved this film!  The writing is uncommonly good: it manages to embed some truly intelligent explorations about what is considered attractive and valuable in our society (physique? intelligence? loyalty? honesty? humor?) in the midst of a funny and poignant love story/sex comedy.

Five stars (unless, of course, you have to have big budget Hollywood production values)- a gem of an indie!",1230940800,,391,5.290322580645161
8303293,4,B001G0KB7U,"As a true ""independent"" filmmaker, I all too often hear about an ""indie"" films I ""must see"" only to  find out the budget was five or ten million dollars.  I walked in on the last fifteen minutes of Mona at the Kansas film festival and could just tell it was good.  There was a sincerity to the tone of the film that was not sentimental.  I wanted to see the whole movie, so I bought a copy, and have to say it is one of the stronger ""no"" budget indie films I have seen.  Some darkly lit scenes and lack of set design assure me the filmmakers were on a frayed shoestring, (as does the fact that the director also produced and edited) but this is not a film you buy for the art direction.  The writing is the strongest element.  Crisp, honest, and enticing.  That is not to take away from the actors.  They deliver authenticity in every scene.  The story sucks you in, and for as funny as this comedy is (laughed out loud a few times), it is also heartbreaking.",1227916800,,959,4.191256830601093
8303294,5,B001G0KB7U,"The movie explores the very real & complicated nature of love triangles.  Does the ""unattractive guy ever win the ""hot"" girl?  The uber-genius writer challenged my ideals on friendship, stereotypes, and had me rooting for the underdog.  I have to admit that even though I was rooting for Bob to win Mona, Eric has a raw sexiness to him....made me wonder, who is going Mona going to pick????",1222214400,,390,4.705882352941177
