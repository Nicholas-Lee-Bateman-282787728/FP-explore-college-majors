4112080,5,B003DU50RM,"I have been searching for ""Evolution's Child"" on DVD for many years. I am thrilled to finally own it. If anthropology, genetics, herbology, immunology, etc. are the kinds of things that turn you on, then this is a great movie. Even some science and medical ethics. Admittedly, the other movies on this set are hokey. But ""Evolution's Child"" is a winner. It is a bit poignant, but it is a great way to address the issues of independence and uniqueness. I would give it 10 stars if I could.",1336608000,7,488,4.49438202247191

8394936,5,B003DU50RM,"I bought this mainly for the title ""IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE II"" which I remembered the movie/plot, but not the title or actors. Then one day while watching ""Jacobs Ladder""  starring Elizabeth Pena, causing a light bulb(in my head) to burn bright, checked her filmography on IMBD, found my long lost movie title, then found it in this collection at AMAZON.",1501459200,,356,4.741935483870968

8394938,5,B003DU50RM,"This is the only place you can get ""Night Visitors"", the old Thomas Gibson, made for television, science fiction film from the nineties. Actually, it is the only place you can get several made for television science fiction films from the nineties, but, since that one was why I bought it, I thought I'd point that out. A couple of these have been released independently on dvd in other countries. However, those releases re-timed the films, altering the speed such that films in 24 frames per second play faster (at 25 frames per second) in those releases, which, as you may know, really ruins a film's flow and cadence. When you speed up a film, voices play higher, bodies move faster, the actors' original sense of timing is completely destroyed and, at times, people seem to be speaking far too quickly. Having wasted money on a Region 2 release of Night Visitors, I can tell you that this version, though it is crammed onto a disc with two other films (each disc contains three films) is the best version available in the world. It is presented at the original speed in the original video format, preserving the 24 frames per second intended by the director and actors. As to the other films, all are presented in standard NTSC (24 frames per second) and none have been altered. For the money, this is a great deal for some fun television films. Good luck finding what is right for you.",1480636800,5,1391,4.612903225806452
