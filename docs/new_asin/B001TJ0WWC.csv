8341638,5,B001TJ0WWC,"This is an adult film that is nostalgic with some powerful performances by the entire cast. Everything about this film captures the era of the early sixties from the houses and their contents to the innocence portrayed on the screen. Lea Pool has crafted a film that anyone would and should view. The original music score composed by Laurent Eyquem (nominated for three major Canadian Awards) was touching, memorable and first rate.
