3418129,2,B0018PH3M4,"To be honest, I really thought this film was going to be better than the original, considering the remake's budget and cast. If you've ever seen the original, then you'd know what I'm talking about. Don't get me wrong, though. The original Wizard had a very low budget and it shows, but it had something this movie doesn't but should have: creepiness!

After I saw the original version, I thought to myself, ""Did some high school kids puts this mess together?"" However, days after the first viewing, my mind began to filter out the trash and left me with elements of horror which made me wonder if the movie was the work of a genius or a rank amateur who was just experimenting. I still can't say for sure, but I will say it left me with a chill.

Unfortunately, this modern remake did not. I was not scared in the slightest and Glover did not persuade, in my opinion. It was nice seeing Combs and Dourif together in the same movie and I thought that was a nice touch.

The only good thing about this movie was the interesting angle they used to explain Montag's magic. A decent plot with a flat script but there's no saving this one.

All in all, I do appreciate the effort that went into this film; I may come off harsh at times, but I do appreciate those directors who bring horror fans new material that they can view, thus keeping the genre alive.",1219449600,,1352,4.374501992031872
3418130,2,B0018PH3M4,"The best that can be said about this new version of ""The Wizard of Gore"" is that it has a bigger budget than the original. This allowed for better looking sets and the ability to hire actual actors. Unfortunately, the overall telling of the story is out of whack. For starters, I am unclear as to why the main character seems to be stuck in the 1930s. Everyone around him is modern, yet he and his immediate surroundings are of the 1930s. The film tries to play off on this, attempting a noirish cinematic style but it is jarring rather than artistic. I kept focusing on all the antique oddities in the main character's home rather than the plot of the film. Keep in mind the guy is not stuck in some weird time warp thing or something, so there is no real explanation for this strange 1930 vibe. Once Crispen Glover gets on the scene, the film picks up a little due primarily to his crazed acting style. The gore set pieces are not very impressive as they are usually CGI obscured, (he puts his intended victims behind a fog covered screen) so as to not really be worth much. As the story progresses it becomes less coherent and eventually just turns into a whole lot of nothing. The film boasts an appearance of the ""Suicide Girls"" and they spend most of their limited screen time without clothing, so that's another positive I guess. The DVD contains a few making of supplements, a directors commentary track, deleted scenes and outtakes. Most of the supplements are better than the actual film. The director obviously had a good time making the film and hanging out with the suicide girls. One thing I did note is that the DVD master appears to be too dark so you might have to make adjustments to your screen. This film is a rental at best although you could probably find something a lot better.",1219276800,5,1801,4.477203647416413
3418131,2,B0018PH3M4,"I had high hopes for this remake of H.G. Lewis' The Wizard of Gore based solely on the casting of Crispin Glover as Montag the Magnificent.  Unfortunately this opportunity for a fun revamping turned out to be horribly directed and acted garbage that has none of the energy found in the original.  The biggest problem is Kip Pardue, an actor who delivers his lines like he's reading the ingredients off a cereal box.  Since he's the main character the film spends 90% of its time on him, and it makes for a very dull viewing experience.  Lewis fans looking for the ""gore"" of the title will also be left sorely disappointed.  Even Glover is disappointing, approaching the Montag character as more of an evangelist than a magician.  The best parts of the movie belonged to Brad Dourif and Jeffrey Combs, two actors that could teach the kids in it a thing or two about how to properly go over-the-top.  Coming on the heels of 2001 Maniacs, The Wizard of Gore just doesn't measure up.",1219190400,5,979,4.591954022988506
3418132,5,B0018PH3M4,"Hi!  I'm Maxx Gillman.  I actually got to work on this movie.  I'm friends with the director, Jeremy Kasten, and committed endless hours to help make this movie (and DVD) as good as I could.  It became my (and Jeremy's) passion project.

This unrated cut basically is the ""director's cut"".  Sure it has a bunch of blood and effects that were always meant to be in there...but there's other stuff too.  A bunch of the music is different (we actually got original music from Black Heart Procession!  and Danny Lohner!  And Stanton LaVey!  and Eric Powell of 16 Volt!  You have no idea how giddy I was as these pieces started coming together).  And there's little editing things too.  Crispin, Brad and Jeffrey all seem a little bit more evil...or a little bit crazier...something.  They're just more fun in this cut.

But enough about the movie.  I'm gonna let that speak for itself.  I love it.

When the DVD was getting made, I was explaining what i think makes a good DVD.  And managed to be given creative control on a bunch of the content.  (holy crap!)

There are 8 Deleted Scenes.  Good ones.  and I remembered on the DVD of Pi, Darren Aronofsky introduced the deleted scenes.  I thought about how rad that was and how it was really interesting to understand why a scene didn't make the cut.  So I got Jeremy to introduce all the deleted scenes and add some insight to them.

There are 3 Featurettes.  I'm sick of DVD extras being like ""It was so fun making [say movie name] and working with the other famous people.""  It's so generic and why bother.  So I was really careful while making them to make sure they actually had CONTENT.
-We've got a general ""making of"" covering everything from casting the actors to production design and costumes (codpiece!) to the spooky haunted elevators (no...really).
-The piece about the effects talks in detail about all the practical and digital effects ranging from an animatronic puppet of Flux Suicide to chopping off Amina Munster's leg to setting fire to a mannequin head in the producer's backyard and using that for a shot.  It was low budget and fun and the stuff we managed to get away was awesome.
-The SG piece gets into casting the part of Dell with a bunch of audition footage of SGs trying out for the roll.  And also carefully painting all of amina's tattoos onto her fake body.  and the blood wrestling.  oh the blood wrestling.

I researched the commentary by running off and watching what i heard were some of the better commentaries out there (UHF, Fight Club, Goonies, Seven Samurai, Orgazmo.  the list goes on and on)  I took notes of what I liked and didn't like and i got to invite the people who really made this movie awesome and had war stories to add to the commentary.  No, none of the actors are in it.  I think their work shows itself excellently in the movie.  But we've got the writer, director, DP, producer and...me.  I gave a everyone a speech about how not to say ""oh!  I like this scene.  let's watch it.""  because i HATE when commentaries do that.  We just opened the whiskey and let the stories fly.  I hope you enjoy it.

I've just realized how much I've written so i'm gonna stop now.  Let me close by saying that I'm not making a dime if you buy this DVD.  But there is a lot of my blood and sweat in it.  This DVD is made because it's what I want to see in a DVD.  And the movie is made by people who really cared and really enjoyed it.  And I hope you enjoy it too.",1218844800,30,3453,4.401587301587302
3418133,4,B0018PH3M4,"Just caught a screener of this one today, and wow - i was really floored - It's a thoughtful (and surprisingly less explicit!) remake of H.G. Lewis's campy existentialist horror trash-flick clas-sick from 1970 which really delivers... Crispin Glover was great as Montag, the infamous Wizard of Gore, and the story really takes some neat twists the likes of which were only hinted at in the original. Not a perfect horror movie, but compared to the rest of the ones i've seen lately, it was pretty neat. The special effects were well done, and the acting was pretty damn good - especially the un-recognizable and over the top turn by Jeffrey Combs. (See if you can spot him - i had to wait for the end credits.) i liked this movie a lot more than i was expecting to, and i'd highly recommend it to any horror afficianado as both an unexpected surprising thought-provoker, and a remake which actually improves upon the original.",1218758400,10,926,4.6871165644171775

3418136,1,B0018PH3M4,"I totally love the original Wizard of Gore.  Herschel Gordon Lewis's classic is nothing short of hilarious!  The first time I saw it, in the 80s, I was shocked and horrified.  But after another viewing I saw the zany humour in it!

I so wanted to love this remake.  I was soooooooo excited when I ordered it.  But unfortunately it was a total let down.  I was so bored I couldn't even watch the whole thing.  I tried a couple times to watch it, and eventually gave it away.  This new Wizard of Gore just don't cut it.",1279584000,,517,4.1938775510204085
3418137,2,B0018PH3M4,"You'd think a cast of notable eccentrics like Crispin Glover, Jeffrey Combs and Brad Dourif would make this remake of Herschell Gordon Lewis' cult classic fun and entertaining, but you'd be wrong. 'Wizard Of Gore' looks terrible, is horribly acted and contains a ridiculous twist ending that not only doesn't make total sense but isn't hard to predict thanks to an annoying voiceover narration.

Edmond Bigelow (Kip Pardue) is a self-styled 50's gumshoe living in modern day Los Angeles. To say that he clashes with his surroundings would be an understatement - he looks like a ridiculous poser. Ed is the publisher of an underground newspaper whose masthead features an illustration of a white rabbit. After an eventful Halloween party, Ed and his girlfriend Maggie (the always sexy Bijou Phillips) get sucked into their own hellish rabbit hole thanks to a mysterious magician named Montag (Glover). After getting invited to one of his shows by a dirty bum (Combs) they witness Montag select a female ""volunteer"" from the audience, a woman whom Ed recognizes as a stripper, and bring her onstage where he proceeds to hypnotize her and commands her to take off her clothes. Then he kills her. As the horrified audience scrambles for the exit, the house lights come on revealing Montag and the woman who is a little dazed but otherwise unharmed. Ed, fascinated by the show, decides to write a piece on Montage - where he comes from, how he chooses his volunteers, what he uses to hypnotize them and, most importantly, how he pulls off the ""trick"" of mutilating them without actually harming them. With the help of Maggie and his friend Jinky, a forensics student, Ed begins an investigation that gets him into all kinds of confusing and dangerous situations that ultimately test his sanity.  When the female volunteers actually start turning up dead, in the same manner they were killed onstage, Ed realizes he's dealing with something far more bizarre than he anticipated.

I'm a huge fan of Pardue but he's terrible here. His performance is nothing more than an elaborate series of tics that are distracting and annoying. Glover, sporting a pompadour and decked out in a white suit that comes complete with a giant prosthetic crotch, is the most fun to watch but his performance is far from being one of his best. Dourif, whose character was originally conceived as a Chinese hip-hop doctor, is reliably spooky but his only purpose in the film is to explain to Pardue what is happening whenever things get too confusing. Combs is a background character during the film's first half and doesn't get anything important to do until the very end. It's a good scene though full of Combs' manic energy and twisted humor. It's disappointing though since all of these guys have been so good in other movies that the one time they appear together in the same movie it had to be this one. Oh well, at least there's the lovely Bijou to look at.",1273536000,2,2934,4.829025844930418
3418138,1,B0018PH3M4,Very very hard to follow. I didn't understand who the main character was. What was in the brown bag? The comparison to the original is very weak. The effects were better in the newer verson but at least in the original a grade school child could understand it. Didn't like it at all.,1273449600,,283,4.3584905660377355
3418139,1,B0018PH3M4,"This movie was TERRIBLE, i was soo disapointed having been a huge fan of all of Lewis's works like The gruesome twosome, 2001 maniacs and of course the Wizard of Gore, i was so excited for the remake, from the trailer it looked like they made almost an amusment park from hell

but sadly it was more like a sideshow attraction at Larry Flynts pad.
i mean honestly what kind of carnival do you know has a room where you can get naked and throw tomatoes at each other.

the FX were terrible, especialy with the girl in the incinerator, what did they use a prop skeleton from wal mart. The random full nudity was neither tastefull or needed really at all, and frankly when it kept cutting to the flashback of the lead character at a strip club i simply just turned it off because they had lost all credibility of even trying to do a remake.

if your under age and are tired of the ""amazing"" plot of the american pie movies then rent this
its just plain terrible but theres nudity",1265932800,,976,4.293478260869565
3418140,2,B0018PH3M4,This movie was really wacky and horrific and hard to follow and comprehend but I was intrigued by Crispin Glover's performance as a magical gory magician. But the story and plot just really threw me off. I just didn't really understand this movie at all. But I just enjoyed watching the performances of Crispin and Kip Pardue. Guess that's all I can say about this one. LOL!,1260489600,,374,4.597014925373134
3418141,1,B0018PH3M4,"I was excited to see Crispin Glover in a remake of the HGL classic The Wizard of Gore. Unfortunately, this movie bored the heck out of me and was not the least bit interesting. Take a pass on this one.",1255651200,,201,4.05

3418143,2,B0018PH3M4,"The updated Wizard of Gore has the look of an episode of Tales from the Darkside or one of those movies that I used to watch on cinemax at midnight on a Sunday night in the late 80's because I wanted to somehow prolong the weekend.  Rather than pay homage to H.G. Lewis, this film sets a dark mood, with low lighting and looming shadows, and attempts to put the plot first, over the gore.  The gore is actually very well done, but is not nearly as prevalent or gratuitous as portrayed in Lewis's films.  While the acting is much, much better than anything in a Lewis film, lead actor Kip Pardue gets way too much screen time, while Crispin Glover is somewhat wasted.  Glover comes off suitably demented as Montag, but the bulk of his performance is on stage performing his act.  I would have liked to have more verbal interaction with other characters.  Ultimately, I became bored with the various plot twists and especially Pardue's character.  This isn't a horrible film, and seems fairly ambitious in gore fx and casting (Brad Dourif & Jeffrey Combs both perform admirably as usual) given the obvious budget limitations.  The problem is linking it with H.G. Lewis.  This Wizard of Gore looks nothing to me like anything Lewis would ever come up with, which makes it fairly misleading as far as I'm concerned.  It's too bad, because there are some things to appreciate here, just not enough for me to recommend.",1248739200,,1413,4.63855421686747

But these old films have something of an advantage over the remakes.  Time.  In my humble opinion, remakes usually suck.  Especially with the crutch of technology.  Somehow this one worked for me - not crazy about the all the cgi in the more recent movies, but Mr. Glover brought it home!  Good for the collection.",1239235200,,472,4.470588235294118
3418155,1,B0018PH3M4,"1 word, HORRIBLE! First off, this is more of a film noir art flick. Hard to follow & boring as hell. If your going to remake a classic then stick to the original formula, just make it more colorful. Don't stray & show all this confusion or dreamlike states that were hard to follow. Perfect example of a good re-make, My Bloody Valentine. The original was good & the re-make was good as well. The director knew what he was doing & did not stray away from the original concept. He enhanced My Bloody Valentine with memorable scenes from the original & built upon them, with this re-make (The Wizard of Gore) I could not wait till it ended,...I swear I threw it right into the trash after I viewed it. It compares nothing 2 the original & Crispin Glover was terrible in this film, his acting was bad & came off as corny. He should of chosen a more mystical & low caliber character to portray instead of this gospel sounding preacher like maniac. His character was not convincing at all so you could not take him seriously, he was a bad choice for this role & several others seem to think so as well. Kip Pardue's narrations are terrible as well! The dialogue was spoken to fast & obviously without any feeling. The words were just muttered like he was reading a cue card or the ingredients off of a soup can. The only 3 good things about this flick are Brad Dourif, Jeffrey Combs & the gore FX. Both Brad & Jeffrey's acting was impeccable (as usual) & the gore FX were done very nicely, FANTASTIC I must say. The film just never took off, kept me in the same spot,... just trying 2 B 2 artsy. Sorry, but no bloody thumbs up for this re-make. Don't waste your time or money as I did.

3418156,2,B0018PH3M4,"I had looked forward to Jeremy Kasten's remake of Herschell Gordon Lewis' The Wizard of Gore, especially with Crispin Glover playing Montag the Magnificent.  And while Glover steals the show and this remake delivers most of the goods that fans of the genre and of Lewis' original will look for, there just seems to be something missing overall in the whole affair.  What that something is basically amounts to anything resembling an entirely coherent plot, as the film offers plenty of confusing moments in its attempts to deliver twists and turns as it moves on through its running time.  Edmund (Kip Pardue) is a journalist who is investigating Montag, whose on-stage dismemberments appear to be crafty magic tricks, until the bodies of the girls (played by the Suicide Girls) start to pile up.  Soon enough, Edmund becomes obsessed with Montag's theatrics, and also finds himself trapped in a web of lies, murder, psychotropic drugs, and above all else, confusion.  Pardue is pretty wooden in the lead role, while Bijou Phillips doesn't do much better as his shady girlfriend, but Glover's appearances on-screen more than make up for their shortcomings.  The rest of the cast includes horror stalwarts like Brad Dourif, an unrecognizable Jeffrey Combs, and Near Dark's Joshua Miller; all of whom do considerably good in their roles.  There's decent gore to be found as well, and all in all this remake of The Wizard of Gore isn't terrible, but it just winds up leaving you wanting more than what you get here.",1232409600,,1512,4.952569169960475
3418157,5,B0018PH3M4,"I announce, with trembling, the remake of Hershell Gordon Lewis' ""The Wizard of Gore"" is a dazzling, brain jarring, reality bending and breaking masterpiece. The oft-asked, Why don't they take a crummy film and make a classic?--they have. A merging of so much complexity, directed and written and acted and lensed to highest artistry-this is a film to be noticed. It is one of those movies that says at the first minute, you are going to have a good time. Jim Thompson's killer inside me. Film noir of much assured perfection.
 Fragments of pain and magic and resurrection, with a meat puppet allegory-as we use the inside of ourselves and find that ticket to the magician show is all we live for. The blood and gore used for ink is no accident and it is an assiduous audacious idea.
That one of the worst filmmakers ever could be used to bounce this bunny trail of towering, biting  intelligence is cause for celebration. Crispin Glover, Kip Pardue and Bijou Phillips are honed to the nth degree in this land of going thru the lowest basement and finding the clue to the whole baffling thing is crafted right in front of your eyes, keeping you guessing, keeping you running it back and in your memory too--this is a friend of a movie. Take all the crack reviews of ""Five Across the Eyes,"" which was a joke, and put them on this film instead. And the SuicideGirls are hot of course. Slam land and lower binges and who gets theirs first? And again.
Zach Chassler has written, and Jeremy Kasten has directed, a main wire to the most complex circuits of the brain, in a journey to a depth that is so cleverly and so deliberately muscularly ennervated, and excised something more than film, something that is in the province of what we call us.
As we come flying apart. As we come seizing the night and the lostness that is more than a theoretical concept. This movie picks up the bloody pieces and throws us back in our faces and these things become hauntings. From the oily Glover, to the burnt-out reporter, Pardue, to the girl he ""met at church,"" Phillips, all on a canvass of blood red and dark time neon signs.
All the backgrounds, all the dialogue, all the music, the effects, the mixed up time periods, the horror fun house mirror, all the formenting and tricks that are not tricks. These are to love as only a horror film fan can.
Where we are set up for reality, in all its grotesqueness, without the veneer of fakery, which most of us see it in, this film does not pretend, does not look to make a quick buck, in low budget is a crashed world of a type of splender. It throws bear traps on us and says look again, the wizard dares you--what indeed are we afraid of?
 And after the ending of everything--find yourself still horribly alive--the roles played don't care about the actors switched round--that's the great joke of the thing. Imagine getting ready. Imagine the reality of what you don't see. Who doesn't, after all?
A great movie. A classic. One not to be missed. One to be noticed. To be talked about. Written about. Congratulations to the film makers, you are geniuses, wrapping up pieces of puzzles in burlap and then tossing the burlap bag in our eyes straight to our brain, to constantly challenge us to unravel it. And is it worth it?
Most assuredly.",1224288000,,3273,4.534686971235194
3418158,4,B0018PH3M4,"Director Herschell Gordon Lewis' THE WIZARD OF GORE (1970) is a cult exploitation film with a reputation that is greater than the actual quality of the film itself. Still, it has an interesting, if poorly executed, premise--a magician uses his exceptional hypnotism skills to prevent his audience from realizing that, before their very eyes, he is literally killing people during his act--that is compelling enough to hold an audience through the entire film despite the poor acting, the egregious special FX, and a plot with more holes than a brick of Swiss cheese.  After viewing the film, one can't help but wonder what would happen if that premise could be used in a film that has a good writer, a skilled director, great actors, and convincing special FX. Well, one need wonder no more: Jeremy Kasten's 2007 remake is everything Lewis' original film could have been...and then some.

In the 2007 remake of THE WIZARD OF GORE, screenwriter Zach Chassler takes the premise of the original film and spins it into a contemporary urban mystery that takes place in the post-punk underground of present-day Los Angeles. In the midst of the murder mystery, Chassler's story also raises interesting questions about the nature of reality and the trustworthiness of human perception.  Visually, the new film's aesthetic is based on the tattoos, piercings, and dreadlocks--not to mention the copious T&A--of the Goth pin-ups known as the Suicide Girls (a few of whom even appear in the film in minor roles), providing a dark atmosphere that matches the grim nature of the film's overall theme. And the oozy, sanguine special FX (by Autonomous F/X, Inc.) are both clever and gut-wrenchingly convincing, living up to the titular gore in ways that put to shame the butcher-shop leftovers of Lewis' original film.

The cast of the 2007 remake is an outstanding mix of hip young actors and genre veterans.  As the title character (a.k.a. Montag the Magnificent), the always-entertaining Crispin Glover is both bizarre and mysterious, yet he somehow achieves this while refraining from his usual tendency to go way over the top.  Glover is reunited with his fellow RIVER'S EDGE (1986) castmate Joshua Miller (genre fans will also recognize Miller from his role as the youngster vampire in 1987's NEAR DARK), who here plays a cynical young coroner introduced to Glover's magic show through the efforts of an underground journalist.  Said journalist is played by Kip Pardue, whom some may recognize from a recurring role on TV's ER, and playing his girlfriend is Bijou Phillips, known to genre fans from her appearance in Eli Roth's HOSTEL: PART II (2007).  Rounding out the cast are genre greats Jeffrey Combs (barely recognizable under heavy make-up) and Brad Dourif, as well as the most famous (and arguably the most beautiful) of the aforementioned Suicide Girls, Amina Munster.

The DVD release of THE WIZARD OF GORE remake offers a pristine digital transfer of the film in its theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1 (anamorphic for 16x9 TVs).  Also included are an informative and entertaining feature commentary by the filmmakers, a making-of featurette, a featurette on the special FX, a mini-documentary on the Suicide Girls, and more.  Gorehounds and other horror fans will definitely want this disc in their movie collections.",1224028800,2,3317,5.11275415896488
3418159,1,B0018PH3M4,"What a horrible actor Crispin Glover is? To be honest, yes, I did purchase this film, and I didn't make it to the end. The only thing Crispin did convincingly was to portray Marty McFly's father in the first Back To The Future movie. Other than that, he's worthless. OK, so he did a decent job in the remake of Willard, but that's not saying much. He even did a horrible job in the Friday The 13th Part IV. Especially his death scene which was pleasing only to know he wouldn't return.

I made it about 45 minutes into the movie before I took it out and literally threw it in the garbage. But CG is mostly to blame for this terrible POS, and his acting as well. Why he was even chosen for this role is beyond me. I guess nobody else tried out.

Do NOT waste your time on this movie, don't even rent it. It was even a struggle to make it as far as I did, and I bought it. Rent a movie you've never even heard of before you try this garbage.

I guess much of its `shock' value have greatly been diminished since we already have an idea just how it will turn out, but I do think that is no excuse. THE WIZARD OF GORE does have one thing going for it; and you guessed it--an abundance of BLOOD and GORE. I'm no gorehound, but this remake of the 1970 classic at least stayed true with its brutal violence, and somewhat to the original`s plot.

Halloween night; a happy couple, Edmund Bigelow and Maggie (Kip Purdue and Bijou Philips respectively) are having a ball in a small town, taking in the sights, among costumed townsfolk.

The two attend the magic show, and they see the same unkempt hobo bite off a rat's head and consume it. Gross isn't it? Shortly after, Montague chooses a young woman in the crowd--and not long after, she is stripped of all her clothes and brutally slaughtered on stage, only to appear alive a minute after. Edmund gains a special interest on the show, and decides to come back for repeated servings. Each `volunteer' in the show is found dead a day after the show, with the same wounds inflicted on them after. Edmund, Maggie and Jinky (Joshua Miller) becomes obsessed in finding the truth behind the mysterious Montague.

Horror filmmaking has taken a step backward the past few years or so. To tell you the truth, I can't remember when was the last time I enjoyed a truly memorable horror film. ""Wizard of Gore"" may not be perfect but it knew exactly what it wanted to do; present a gore-feature to emulate the essence of the original. It succeeds, the naked women, the blood and brutality is omnipresent in the proceedings, and may well be worth the price of purchase alone. The victims are played by members of the ""Suicide Girls"". Some of the gore effects seemed to look a bit ""campy"" and it was a little difficult for me to tell whether some blood effects were CGI. The film has a very grainy look that adds some atmosphere to the film and promotes a somewhat ""dreamlike"" feel.

The film throws in a detective story amid all the blood and gore. To be honest, the film started interestingly enough but the plot is a little difficult to follow. The direction by Jeremy Kasten seemed a little convoluted at times, and the main antagonist Montague, felt a little underused. (which is such a shame, Glover exhibits such an unbalanced creepy charisma). The script threw in a lot of ideas but never fully develops each one. The final minutes of the film had a severe feeling of disconnection from the viewer, as you question just what everything was all about. I love mind-benders but this movie was too convoluted for its own good; the flashbacks, the dreams, the unanswered questions, all serve up to frustrations and the film confuses to the point of irritation. The film may have been better if it was longer, but the 90 minute running time is just not enough to justify its twists and turns to a credible resolution.

Bijou Philips is an interesting presence onscreen. I didn't really realize how pretty she was in her previous films. Kip Purdue is decent, but I think he was a miscast in his role. His character felt a bit bland and uninteresting. The cinematography is quite good though, the tilting style of the camera and extreme close-ups may seem slightly overdone but it does succeed in what it wanted to do. The feeling of ""noirish"" detective films may come to mind as the camera work does have its strong points.

My memory of the original film is quite unreliable, it has been many years since I've seen it in order to properly give a good comparison. (time to re-watch) Despite the feeling of frustrations I've felt, that I was disconnected with the film's script--I followed the film pretty well and I do think it would be up to the viewer to decide whether it was just a figment of someone's imagination or if it all really happened. The film just doesn't offer any solid answers and whatever attempts it made to confuse is definitely successful, it's just that after awhile, you will start to lose interest because of it's rushed direction. As a mind-bender, it feels rather pretentious but as a gore show--it is a very solid attempt. Those who are looking for an abundance of gruesome sequences will not be disappointed. While those scenes didn't exactly go beyond its limits or push the envelope of brutality; for horror fans, the blood-soaked nudity may well be worth the price of the movie itself.

Recommended timidly to horror fans, RENT it first. [3- Stars]",1220832000,4,4841,4.689411764705882

Crispin Glover was amusing in the role of Montag the Magnificent, and his monologues with his unsuspecting audience made gave me goosebumps. This film keeps you constantly guessing what comes next in it's downward spiral of insanity. I highly recommend it.",1219536000,,362,5.1525423728813555

8270460,5,B0018PH3M4,"A remake of a classic,reinvented. This movie kept me confused man,the story has alot more depth than the original,there is a very deep & underlying story that will confuse you. I don't want to tell what happens cuz it will ruin the film but i will say it is gory but not straight up hack scenes that go on,it shows it but it is CGI as to makeup and dummies with red syrup. The crazy leech shaman played by Brad Dourif(voice of Chucky) and a reporter addicted to thrills get caught up in a violent,crazy sideshow that leaves victims turning up left and right yet they walk away from the sideshow alive. So like i said it is a head film. Watch and pay close attention,i think in it's own way this is just as good as the original. Check it out gore fans.",1423872000,,751,4.222222222222222

8270462,5,B0018PH3M4,"I really don't understand all the hating when it comes to this film. Maybe I don't take my movie watching seriously enough. Maybe others take it too seriously.

I remember watching the original WoG when I was in high school. My friends and I rented it not knowing who H.G. Lewis was and not knowing what we were about to watch. I remember all of us wondering what in the world we were witnessing and really not getting into it. Years later, I came to know exactly who H.G. Lewis is and also found that he does not take his films seriously at all. This alone made me feel better about his movies.

When I heard they were remaking WoG, I was excited. I'm not sure why since I never did get into the original, but I was. When I was finally able to see it, I honestly was not disappointed at all and enjoyed the film, though some of the scenes were still cringe-worthy due to the gore. Then again, the title gives fair warning that there will indeed be gore and it doesn't disappoint.

I think most viewers are way too harsh on Kip Pardue's performance. I may be bias since I find the man attractive (though to find him attractive in this role has me questioning my taste in men), but I believe he portrayed Ed wonderfully. His confusion about everything that was going on had me feeling bad for him at some points, but I also felt wary of the character as well. The end had me disliking him but smiling at his attitude. Basically, I couldn't hate the character even though he was responsible for unspeakable acts and was not the most mentally stable.

Crispin Glover played Montag magnificently (excuse the horrible pun). He overacted but I think the character called for that type of portrayal. I don't think another actor could have played the role as well. The man has always come across as an odd person, but he does put his all into a role and you have to admire that.

Brad Dourif is quickly becoming a favorite horror movie actor of mine. Before this film, I really only knew him as the voice of Chucky. After this, I took note of him in Rob Zombie's versions of Halloween and Halloween 2 and really liked him in those as well. He's funny but can be creepy at the same time.

I've never been a fan of Bijou Phillips, but she plays the role of Maggie well. I believe other actresses could have done just as well, so I've not really anything special to say about her performance.

Horror fans should give this one a chance and NOT compare it to the original. While remakes are aplenty currently in our cinemas, I think that they get a bad rep overall. Don't go in expecting the same thing. If they did the exact same things that were done in the originals, there would be no purpose to make the films. Honestly, they shouldn't even call them remakes, but re-envisions. Because that's what ends up happening most of the time and sometimes it can be a good thing.",1359072000,,2863,4.370300751879699
8270463,4,B0018PH3M4,Purchased this movie simply on a whim and was suprised that I actually enjoyed the movie. Feared receiving a low budget late night cable flop... The Wizard of Gore held its own as a movie.,1319155200,,188,4.4
8270464,5,B0018PH3M4,"I have seen both the original Wizard of Gore and the remake at a friends house.  The first one may have been good in its day, the concept greatly appealed to me as a horror movie enthusiast, however the first movie was left widely open to interpretation, even featuring the main characters sitting around asking about the unanswered questions and still getting no where.  I am not saying it wasn't good, just not to me.

The remake here was equally confusing, and as I read over the bad reviews, I can see where they are coming from.  With the remake, it needs multiple viewings to be understood, to follow the complex plot.  Perhaps many horror movie enthusiast seek instant gratification, no plot gory kills, and my opinion is they are the one who gave this movie such bad reviews here.  I am not saying their preferred method of entertainment is wrong.  I am simply saying this movie is not for them.

It took me many times watching this movie to understand it fully, and it just got better every time I watched it. The movie does not coddle you, it does not point and say ""This is what is going on"", it does go for the slandered plot twist at the very end (Or should I say the beginning.) and to the uninformed it would be very confusing.  I believe it is a true masterpiece of a movie, surpassing the original in every way.  It stimulated me with every viewing, and I still enjoy it, with every viewing I learn a little more about the plot, the trick and the ultimate illusion of the movie.  The movie also comes with an all-star cast including Brad Dourif, Jeffery Combs, Crispin Glover (Who has not seen the completed film still at time of writing.) and many others.  I think this is a very under appreciated gem of a film that everyone deserves to watch at least twice to see if they grip it.",1312502400,,1800,4.404833836858006
8270465,1,B0018PH3M4,"The problem with the original Wizard of Gore was the repetitive storyline and that the gore scenes were all pretty similar. A modern remake with a good rewrite could have improved much on the original, both in terms of the gore scenes and in terms of narrative. Unfortunately, these filmmakers did just about everything wrong. One, the story: Yes, the story could have been much improved. But screenwriter Zach Chassler has added way too much that doesn't improve the story but only makes it feel contrived and incoherent. Next, the style of the movie. The original was lightweight entertainment, not to be taken seriously. This one, on the other hand takes itself very seriously. The director seems to have tried to make some neo-noir, complete with silly voice over narration. I get the ompression the films is supposed to be stylish and goodlooking, but it only feels pretentious and certainly not well made. It made me think of Battlefield Earth, which also had lots of weird camera angles for no apparent reason.

This movie has a bad, contrived, completely uninteresting story. It's certainly not a scary horror film. It's not an interesting mystery. And it's definitely not the well made and stylish film the filmmakers seem to have attempted to make. I got nothing out of watching this, except that I got bored. Not recommended to anyone.",1295654400,,1346,4.929515418502203
