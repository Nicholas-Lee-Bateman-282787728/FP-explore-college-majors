7812028,3,6301450493,"This film is not about the Missouri Raid and is a revised version of the James legend. For example, not Jesse, but Frank is the gang leader. They and the others in the gang are good people. The gang started after they tried to give up after the Civil War, but a Union major ignored the governments pardon and did all he could to kill them in revenge for them killing his brother. It is he, not the Pinkertons, who are against the James gang, first as an Army major and then after being kicked out the Army as the head of his own Detective Agency. The gang members who want to live in peace have their homes burned. The mother of the James boys has her arm cut off. Jesse's girl, later his wife, is insulted. Frank and Jesse are blamed by the major for robberies they did not commit. And there are many other revisions.",1460419200,2,818,4.2165605095541405

7812031,4,6301450493,"Filmed in and around Sonora CA. Some river scenes at Parrot's Ferry on South Fork of Stanislaus River. I was working with Reno Sardella at his Pinecrest Stables at the time. Reno supplied the horses for the movie. I enjoy the story and especially the river scenes. Not a documented telling of the Jesse James Story, but fun to watch. Check it out.",1378771200,,347,4.523809523809524
