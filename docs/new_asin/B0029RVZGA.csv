3880569,2,B0029RVZGA,"When people in a movie theatre start checking their cell phones for messages, getting up and down to visit the restroom and rustle constantly through miscellaneous candy bags for another hit of sweet or salt, the film being presented just isn't all that good. Either that or the audience's expectation is not being met which quite possibly could be the culprit in the case of director/writer Tony Gilroy's billed intelligent thriller, ""Duplicity,"" starring Julia Roberts and Clive Owens.

As confirmed by the presence of about fifteen pre-teenagers escorted by two wise mothers who after watching their charges noisily pile into two of the theatre's upper rows seated themselves at the aisle level with the exit, the audience anticipates either a redux of the sexy fast-paced ""Oceans"" trilogy or a spy-stylized ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pretty-Woman-15th-Anniversary-Special-Edition/dp/B00081U7HC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pretty Woman (15th Anniversary Special Edition)</a>"" Instead of a mane of beautiful hair and that famous toothy smile, they had to settle for a dour looking Roberts with an obviously surgically altered upper lip as a former CIA agent gone corporate spy. Roberts plays the machination maven Claire by pursing already pinched lips; we get the sense of a stepped-up&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Erin-Brockovich/dp/B00003CXFV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Erin Brockovich</a>&nbsp;brow-wrinkling intensity, where tube tops and tacky denim minis are traded in for sleek tailored blouses and pencil skirts. The object of her affections or deceptions is Clive Owens, one-time MI6, also a converted corporate spy who wants to venture out on his own, sting the big guys, and retire comfortably with Roberts and 40 million big ones in a place so secluded it may only have an anonymous email address. He does look good in suits cut in the James Bond template, but fails to own the panache required to give ""Ray"" that playful yet able-to-take-care-of-business je-ne-sais-quoi. Indeed, an audience seeking the urbane style of Cary Grant teamed with Ingrid Bergman in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Notorious/dp/B001D8W7EK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Notorious</a>"" should skip this one and rent the Hitchcock classic.

""Duplicity"" duplicates the pace and jumbled chronology of Tony Gilroy's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Michael-Clayton-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00121QGPY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Michael Clayton (Widescreen Edition)</a>."" But where ""Clayton"" fascinates with its character study of George Clooney's `fixer,' Michael Clayton, this film stumbles with repetitive dialogue--Claire and Ray sashay through a standardized opening repartee meant to suggest a teasing combativeness between the two leads, too banal an attempt at comedy--when Ray decides a pizza corporation may be his financial nirvana we wonder why MI6 didn't kick him to the curb or just give him a desk job--and locale that should be exciting (Dubai, London, Rome, Miami and New York make appearances) but gray-faces the viewer with too many fluorescent bulbs lighting a rabbit's warren of dull office cubicles. Supposedly clever and sexy, ""Duplicity"" confuses rather than excites; it needs a boost of the same adrenaline found in Gilroy's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bourne-Trilogy-The-Bourne-Identity-The-Bourne-Supremacy-The-Bourne-Ultimatum/dp/B001F12J0C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bourne Trilogy (The Bourne Identity | The Bourne Supremacy | The Bourne Ultimatum)</a>&nbsp;and less full screen shots of Roberts and Owens trying to look smartly skeptical, knowingly superior or wildly outraged.

Bottom line? ""Duplicity"" attempts to recreate the magic of Tony Gilroy's ""Michael Clayton"" with the added bonus of romance blossoming between the lead characters. Sadly, the much-touted chemistry between Julia Roberts and Clive Owens falls short, so much so that the only duplicity going here is the magic the film promises but fails to deliver. An overly maniacal Paul Giamatti and an anal Tom Wilkenson dueling with crazed glee as the two rival corporate CEOs may fascinate for a few seconds before the reflex to yawn kicks in. Recommended only if you need to kill 2 hours and 5 minutes of your precious time.

3880624,4,B0029RVZGA,"The director and i will discus this film largely through his commentary,a very good commentary and at first he tells us the star Julia Roberts,was unavailable,so he waited for her before making this film. She finally came on board and he admits her role is more character driven then movie star,and the word papparazzi often appears in his commmentary. This is a film about the 'real reality',and he tries to bring the movie there rather than 'manipulate'
a very art type film and you will be rewarded for trying to understand complex and intelligent film which works on many levels. The first is the area of vocabulary,examining grammar,words and enunciation which orientates the action. Julia here is like a super sleuth,and works her way around the all too fallible male character,as the director tries to find the 'genesis' of the characters,and he says its a 'testament' to the film and the actors it turned out as good as it has. Part of the charm of the film is the locales of Rome,which represent 'infinite' and old age values as they relate to these modern characters,the male character whom we first see in a sexual experience and he argues who seduces who,and cant adequately see his sexual experiences and nature how can he assess and understand much of anything,and near the end of the film after seeing the Roberts character he says 'i cant stop looking at you' after seeing her so much he should look deeper (see the film ' a woman's face' with joan crawford)
and there's a reason why the Roberts character continually emasculates the male characters,and many reviewers see the film as  a joke. The film is about spying and reality,about sexual esperiences feelings and interpretations,the link as the director says between 'experience and learning', knowing how to interpret. The world we live in is very complex and there are allusions to Russia,and khruschev(a reforming character undone by government bureaucrats)..
Julia roberts does well in this film appearing stacatto which suits this role, and the director said he was impressed by her person 'rational sweet' as opposed to sacharine sweet...a mature person. The director distinguishes our modern life of 'nasty emails' but sais 'the dawn is coming' in these characters lives he hopes...the very business like word 'efficient' is used throughout and like all directors he tries to be 'greedy enough' to get the most out of this cast and very difficult movie....everyone should watch this film as it has much to teach us which swiftly went through american theatres.",1337040000,,2539,5.002364066193853
3880625,3,B0029RVZGA,"I watched it reluctantly and in desperation after watching Millennium Trilogy 50 times each. The film bombed at the box office. The story was complicated enough to be interesting, but the lead characters, or at least the portrayal of them, were very unlikable which turns me off right away. I need to like the characters, no matter how mean or nasty they are, and I could not like these two, especially the Julia Roberts character. That said, if you like'd Michael Clayton sort of story, you'll like this.",1332633600,,505,4.75
3880626,4,B0029RVZGA,"The Cold War ended long ago, but the spy-movie genre remains as strong as ever. Instead of nuclear secrets or assassinations, though, these spies deal in industrial secrets and character assassination. Julia Roberts and Clive Owen work well together, keeping the tension and surprise high down to the last moments. The double and triple loyalties seem complex enough, but there's always one more layer to peel away in this thoughtful adventure.

Plot pushes this movie along, something that many viewers will find unfamiliar. There aren't any guns or high speed chases. Nothing burns or blows up (unless you count someone's temper). Instead, the characters really make this one work. The ongoing tension between them started years before, when they first met during their days as agents for different governments. Roberts's character seduced Owen's, then drugged him unconcious and relieved him of national secrets. With a start like that, you can bet they're looking over their shoulders every minute, at each other.

All of which invites comparison to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mr-And-Mrs-Smith/dp/B001GJ9G90/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mr. And Mrs. Smith</a>. Despite a few core elements in common, the two movies differ in all the ways that matter. The biggest differences is that the Smiths superficially seem close, but in fact have deep divisions between them. ""Duplicity"" reverses that: despite continuous displays of distrust, Roberts's and Owen's characters have a commitment to each other a lot stronger than either seems to realize.

This might make a good date movie, when she wants a non-violent ""relationship"" flick but he wants suspense without the mushy stuff. Don't wait for a date, though. I liked it a lot, even seeing it by myself.

The screenwriter and director are too cute by half. The flashbacks do become annoying and are not as clever as the director would like us to believe.
  The biggest problem is the couple steal a formula and offer it to Swiss businessmen. The Swiss company tests it and discovers it's fake. Meanwhile, an American corporate CEO is announcing this great find. Duh. The American company would obviously test this formula too and find out it's phony.

I liked the moving back and forth in time, but it was obvious there was a twist so that element lacked surprise.

Duplicity is a confusing movie about corporate spies with twists and jumps in time.

Our two stars are ex-spies. Roberts is ex CIA and Owens is EX MI6.

They decide to go into the private sector to swindle a large chunk of cash from an unsuspecting corporation.

As the movie unfolds, you aren't quite sure who to believe as neither character trusts the other.

Who will end up with the money?

Duplicity boasts a stellar supporting cast: Tom Wilkinson and Paul Giamatti play the CEOs of competing businesses and they are at each other's throats.

Wilkinson's company has a secret new product that will revolutionize the business and Giamatti wants it. Enter our spies.

The chemistry between Roberts and Owen is taut and remains impenetrable through the whole film experience, with caring and passion but also this nagging suspicion that one or the other or both are ""gaming"" the other.  It is completely believable, sexy, funny, and pathetic for what it reveals about them as people and the kind of lives they live (or lived, as master spies).  Then there is the caper itself:  to put it mildly, there are games within games and they are not the only ones in the competition for duplicity.  Happily, the ending is one of the logical possibilities and it is brought off extremely well, not as some kind of outlandish scam, but as the execution of a realistic plan you can fully believe.

3880634,2,B0029RVZGA,"Oh, intended (operative word, intended)--- elements of DUPLICITY...as movie fans, how do we love thee?

We love sharp romantic comedy, finely executed satire,  captivating that is so well done  it diverts and engages us seamlessly.

Finally---and I think this is not a quantum leap assumption---we especially love fully realized  depictions of  subtle, mindless,  merged, intensifying crescendo of eros between two humans whose perfectly polarized  charge makes that precious gift possible

Cause is that phenomenon not one of the true miracles of life for which the Universe got a 4.0 in Engineering?  (Rhetorical.)

All of the above were clearly the intended elements of Duplicity, and I submit... all fell shamefully short, except, perhaps the second:  satire of corporate hysteria- greed, malfeasance, the end justifies the means.  That one worked to some degree thanks mainly to  Paul Giamatti who never runs on empty and never phones it in.

Most important of all: being  attractive well matched in said attractiveness (Ms. Roberts & Mr. Owens in this regard could have been a fine brace of carriage horses in a more elegant century)....is IN NO WAY SHAPE OR FORM a guarantee of molten polarized erotic crescendo  building between those two humans . viscerally & PALPABLY.

I take pride in my eros meter.  It's not an app one can download--but I think it's factory loaded in all of us....and reviews celebrating the ""chemistry"" between the two leads in this movie....simply boggle.

Each time they meet in public---the rich European locations are fabulous, no question-- Ms. Roberts & Mr. Owens engage in a little ritualistic exchange that is sometimes confusing.  It is meant to be confusing at first....but it is also sad, because despite it's  about hooking up, did we or didn't we?,  not a shred of erotic dynamic/subtext/juice  emanates from either Julia or Clive.

Relatedly, speaking lines quietly and with as little affect as possible is NOT THE SAME AS BEING COOL

COOL... is about OWNING/BEING centered, crystal clear, self contain, distilled intensity of the species that communicates in specifics with no words.

It, like eros,  originates & lives inside and can not be emulated via some  technique of line delivery.

We experience it clearly in American classics starring Hepburn and Tracy via several directors.  And while the two actors in question were lovers in real life, that's not required to potray the level of polarized charge we deserved to get in Duplicity.

What Duplicity was  trying to be... purported to be, but  never  achieved......was accomplished in 1968,  tho to be sure, the  classic in question is no kind of romantic comedy nor did it ever want to be one.

It is, of course, THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR

3880638,3,B0029RVZGA,"I love a good mystery, a good whodunit. ""Capers"", they used to call them. What I like even more are movies where nothing is what it seems and nothing ends the way that the audience thinks that it will end. Remember the first time you saw The Sixth Sense? We were all blown away when it was revealed that Dr. Malcolm Crowe, played by Bruce Willis, had been dead from the start of the film. However, if we had paid attention there were clues throughout the film pointing to the fact. All we had to do was pay attention. How about The Sting? Remember what it was like when you realized at then end of the film that Newman and Redford also stung the audience?

Duplicity seemed like it was going to be one of those movies. Just the name, Duplicity, tells the audiences that things are not going to be what they seem. The director, Tony Gilroy, does a good job leading viewers through the world of corporate spies whose job is to steal secrets from competing companies, at the same time protecting their own secrets.

The story revolves around corporate spies Ray Koval and Claire Stenwick, convincingly played by Clive Owen and Julia Roberts. Koval and Stenwick have a plan to steal a secret formula for their boss, Richard Garsick (Paul Giamatti), from a rival company owned by Howard Tully (Tom Wilkinson). However, they never intend on turning anything over to Garsik. Their plan is to sell the secret formula to the highest bidder.

This is where things get tricky in the movie. We can never be sure if either party is being honest. There are enough hints that Claire might be trying to screw Ray out of the formula and the big payday. There are also enough hints that Ray may throw Claire under the proverbial bus to protect his own hide. Because they never know when the other one can be trusted, the audience is left guessing which one will screw the other one first.

For the duration of the movie, there is a build up to the conclusion where our suspicions are either going to be proven correct or there is a twist that we missed along the way. What we get is far from the ending that anyone expected. And not in a good way.

It turns out that there never was a formula. Tully set up the whole thing, from the beginning, to screw over Garsik. There is no way we could have known this though. There were no hints, clues, or signals that Tully had someone in Garsik's company. How were supposed to know that there was a camera in Koval and Stenwik's secret apartment?

This is Duplicity's greatest failure. It would have been a great ending to a great movie, but there were no clues or hints that the people being duped were Koval, Stenwick, Garsick, and the audience. There was a chance to turn this movie into one of the classic what-you-see-is-not-what-you-get films, a movie that people would have talked about with friends. However, we have to learn that Tully had orchestrated everything through a montage of flashback scenes.

Should we have been on the scam that was being pulled? No, half the fun of this kind of movie is learning that we got scammed, too. Should we have had some clues? Some hints? Yes. The other half of the fun is knowing that, had we paid attention, we may have caught on to what was really going on. The viewer should have gotten that ""ah ha"" moment, but we were cheated out of it.

I expected something more than a clichd technique from a director who's last film, Michael Clayton, was one of the best films of 2007. When directors pull this stunt, ""this"" is what really happened, but we just didn't show ""you"" stunt, it says to the audience that they are not smart enough to figure things out if it was presented in another way.

However, this one flaw doesn't warrant the banning of Duplicity from your DVD player. Far from it. Duplicity is a good film if we set aside the fact that Gilroy wanted to make a cute film with a twist and look at the film as a romance. Yes, a romance. At its heart, Duplicity is really nothing more than a romance.

In the process of stealing the formula, Ray and Claire learn to love each other for who they are and, more importantly, they learn to trust each other. As anyone that has been married can tell you,a relationship, for all its ups and downs, is about trust.

At the end of the film, when they don't have anything to show for their efforts, they still have each other. Really, what's more romantic than a couple that has been through the ringer and has come out stronger on the other side?

Rent Duplicity for the great acting, but stay for the romance. Watch it with that special someone in your life. You won't regret a moment.",1283817600,2,4608,4.446682464454977

The romance is befuddling between Owen's and Roberts' characters, as neither has much of a spark for the other and seems only interested in appeasing corporate and self greed. In this respect, they seem more suited for a lonely rise up the corporate ladder rather than having steamy sex in hotels and apartments. The one thing the two of them DO have (occasionally) is some interesting dialogue where they try to figure out if each of them is playing the other. But that's about it.

It's a good, complicated, and pretty cleverly structured film with stylish but credible performances to match.

This isn't a film to watch while you're doing something else; fixing dinner, checking your emails, etc.  The screenplay was brilliant and it kept me on the edge of my seat.  I never lost interest, not for one moment.  Clive and Julia have terrific chemistry and I loved the dialogue.

This film plays to an intelligent audience and it keeps you on your toes.  I've watched so many films where the ending is predictable.  There was nothing predictable about ""Duplicity"".  It may have you feeling that you've nailed it, only to turn around and pull the rug out from under your feet.

I'm very selective about the films I actually choose to purchase.  When I finished watching this last night, I knew I had to have my own copy and I want one with all of the bells and whistles, including interviews with the Director, Producer, actors, etc.  I'm watching it again tonight and that's a rave for me!

I love Clive Owen and he has some really memorable lines.  It's great to see Julia Roberts back in full force.  She's as stunning as ever and plays this role with great finesse.

If you want an action paced thriller (ho hum), this isn't your movie.  No graphic sex scenes either but lots of great sexual chemistry.  I hope to see Clive & Julia team up again soon.

The entire cast is brilliant!  Paul Giamatti and Tom Wilkinson fit their roles like a pair of old shoes.  I don't know how anyone could find this film boring.

Owen and Roberts first meet at a party in Dubai, she tricks him and steals secrets from him. They meet after five years. Throughout the movie it is unclear whether these two are in love or are going to cheat each other eventually. Their cat and mouse game and between the two multinationals that they represent has been directed by Tony Gilroy, who has earlier directed Michael Clayton.

 The story is told in flashbacks and thus is quite difficult to follow.  Julia Roberts and Clive Owens are spies representing different countries who meet, fall in love and engage in a long and elaborate plan to bilk a corporation out of billions of dollars.  There is an arrogant attitude imbedded in all this plotting: the assumption that they are far smarter than any corporate security organization and they never doubt their own capabilities.
There is a lack of chemistry between the two that makes their plans hollow.  They do not seem credible or sympathetic and the flashback storyline further adds to making them remote.
Paul Giamatti plays one of the corporate chieftains and he dominates the screen, he grabs our interest.

3880671,3,B0029RVZGA,"Two government spies who fall in love with each other and decide to follow the money into industrial espionage may be a slightly hackneyed plot, but in the right, humorous hands, could have made for a delightful movie.  Duplicity is not delightful.  It is entertaining as a caper film, but as a romance, not so much.

I never got the chemistry between Julia and Clve and their initial meeting in Dubai was dumb beyond belief.  For all Clive's profession of lust at first sight, quite frankly Julia didn't look all that good and what kind of creep doesn't back off at ""no""? Sorry. I just didn't believe the attraction furthermore, didn't care.  This was surprising from two actors I really like.

There was much to disbelieve on a skills level also. Throughout J and C's decision making and subsequent foray into crime, there was such bumbling and so many mistakes made, it was hard to believe these two were ever competent spies.  Of course, if they'd spent as much time on the actual caper as they did on dissecting their relationship and why they shouldn't trust each other, maybe things would have gone differently.

It struck me as unintentionally hilarious that two spy/con artists would get all angsty and appalled at evidence of untrustworthiness in each other, yet arguments on the subject took up a great deal of screen time.  Yawn.

On the other hand, Paul Giamatti was a treat to watch as was Tom Wilkinson as rival CEOs.  Their slow motion fight during the opening credits was the best scene in the movie.  Both Owens and Roberts are nice to look at, the locations were interesting, and there was one moment of genuinely agonizing suspense, if unnecessarily contrived.

The denouement was nicely unexpected and, since I wasn't invested in either character, very satisfactory.

Bottom line? There are much better movies in this genre.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mr-Mrs-Smith-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000AP04FG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mr. & Mrs. Smith (Widescreen Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Fish-Called-Wanda/dp/6305161879/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Fish Called Wanda</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/To-Catch-a-Thief-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000MX7V5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">To Catch a Thief (Special Collector's Edition)</a>, or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Entrapment-Special-Edition/dp/B00004SC3M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Entrapment (Special Edition)</a>.

Tom Wilkinson and Paul Giamatti are fun as rival CEOs but the overall plotting of the movie should be obvious to anyone with a familiarity with such films and aside from a few laughs there's not much else going on here; Owen and Roberts don't have the type of chemistry required for these roles (Mr. and Mrs. Smith wasn't very good but Pitt and Jolie at least knew what they were doing with similar characters) and, while not terrible, Duplicity emerges as a very forgettable film.

3880673,3,B0029RVZGA,"The 'Con' has long been a film staple, an intriguing 'tease' that challenges the viewer to piece together an elaborate scheme that unfolds as we watch. In the best of these films, there are three unwritten rules, that makes them special; first, a plot that challenges, and provides surprising, yet believable twists, to keep us on our toes (think, ""The Sting""); second, intelligent and despicable villains that deserve to be brought down (Andy Garcia, in ""Ocean's Eleven"", for example); finally, even more intelligent and likable protaganists we can identify with, and cheer for (two of my favorites were Audrey Hepburn and Peter O'Toole, in ""How to Steal a Million""). Director/screenwriter Tony Gilroy, in ""Duplicity"", provides a clever, modern 'twist' to these rules, but the ultimate 'mark' his con is played on is the viewing audience, and I admit, this disappointed me, even more than the misleading ads that implied the film was a 'romantic comedy'.

First off, I never saw the 'sizzling chemistry' between Julia Roberts and Clive Owen that some critics raved about. Both characters were always so duplicious that I couldn't warm up to them, much less root for them (particularly as, through most of the film, each had different agendas). Their attraction seemed contrived, lacking any heart, and when Julia Roberts can't touch your heart, you have a problem! Next, the 'villains' (Tom Wilkinson and Paul Giamatti) are presented as so cartoonish and petty (opening the film in a shouting match that ends in a brawl), that you'd think even ""The A-Team"" could bring them down, without breaking a sweat (yeah, I know, this was all a part of the set-up for the 'Con'). Finally, the actual heist itself was so routine and easy to accomplish, I'm amazed two 'professionals' like Owen and Roberts weren't even a tad suspicious. The surprise 'twist' of the finale has been described as pure Hitchcock, but the 'Hitch' film it reminded me of, ""Family Plot"", handled it's twist ending (and the entire story, for that matter), with far more panache and wit.

""Duplicity"" has it's share of fans, so I admit my personal disappointment in the film may simply be a lack of 'sophistication' in Gilroy's modern variation of the 'Con', but if you are not thrilled after you view it, don't say I didn't warn you!",1256688000,,2299,4.953367875647668

The plot, of a plan between ex-CIA and MI-6 professionals(Julia Roberts and Clive Owen)to steal a multi-billion dollar formula for curing baldness from greedy American corporate interests and sell it to greedy European corporate interests, all the while not really trusting each other except while having sex, is lost in the midst of all of the morally deficient characters trying to prove how clever they are to one another. The dialogue between Roberts and Owen repeats itself a lot in a poor attempt at comedy, and the characters who end up outwitting this morally bankrupt couple at the end are not even explored.

Nevertheless, the movie drags on for a seemingly interminable length of time following them around the world, including a Cleveland populated by taxis with New York license plates. I ended up watching it with a morbid curiosity just to see if anything really surprising or redeeming would surface, only to sigh in relief when the end credits started rolling.

Julie Roberts, Clive Owen, Paul Giamatti and the blessed Tom Wilkinson all in the same movie; too good to be true, right?  I mean, this had success written all over it; and from the guy who wrote and directed the most surprising film of 2007 (for me, beings that I expected to hate and wound up loving it), I just couldn't wait to see him take on a lighter film.  The trailers looked all sorts of cheeky and delightful; and some of the initial reviews were borderline raves so I was all psyched out for this.

Um...well...yeah.

The film opens with clear chemistry between Roberts and Owen; which is maintained throughout the film (thankfully) and then explodes in a slow-motion fist fight between Giamatti and Wilkinson that is utterly hilarious and as brilliant as the film gets.

It's all downhill from there.

The main problem with the film is its structure.  Tony Gilroy is a very accomplished screenwriter; serving up all three `Bourne' films as well as the Oscar nominated `Michael Clayton' and this years surprisingly deep `State of Play', so I was astounded (in a bad way) with what he did here.  `Michael Clayton' (which he also directed) had this eerie sense of mysterious suspense, but it never became too complicated for its own good.  I understand that `Duplicity' is in another category, but the same formula should apply.  Yes, when dealing with a crime caper you have to enlist an arsenal of tricks and twists to keep everyone guessing; but `Duplicity' is so all over the place that the mystery becomes more frustrating than intriguing.  There needs to be at least a sense of clarity so that the audience doesn't become irritated, trying desperately to figure out just what is going on, for if it is too hard to grasp the audience gives up.

My wife went to sleep.  I would have too if I wasn't determined to write a review for this today.

The timeline jumps become even more confusing when you are trying to figure out just when certain things are taking place.  Because of the fact that they will jump back short time spans as well as long (they'll jump back 5 years, then 18 months, then 3 years, then 3 months) one can easily become lost as to the exact timeline of events.

I loved the final twist, even if it was too little too late, and I loved the performances.  Owen and Roberts were utterly delicious and worked effortlessly together.  Giamatti is a ham, but he is perfect for that type of character work.  Tom Wilkinson makes EVERYTHING better, but he is so underused here.  I love what he does, his calm and collected delivery just aching for more screen time, and his final scene is flawlessly delivered.

Great actors giving great performances in a muddled mess of a movie; don't you hate that!

I can't really recommend this one.  It is boring, horribly paced and confusing as all get out.  How do you find yourself OSCAR NOMINATED for your directorial debut and then follow it up with THIS?  What is even sadder is that Gilroy wrote the script for `State of Play', which was also released this year and was 100x's better than this mess.  `State of Play' could have turned into a muddled mess as well, had the script been poorly executed, but Gilroy turned in a very cohesive and easily understandable thriller that maintained an air of mystery, intrigue and calculated suspense; everything this film lacked.

At the end of its interminable 126-minute running time, it just didn't feel that painful to part ways with them.

Roberts plays CIA operative Claire Stenwick (her last name is a play on Barbara Stanwyck, speaking of ""The Lady Eve""), and Owen is thoroughly smitten MI6 agent Ray Koval. Their mixed motives of foreplay and espionage inform the film's overture, and when they reunite five years later, they are lured away from undercover government work into corporate counter-intelligence. As kindred spirits who can't help mistrusting each other, the lovers hatch a scheme where each will spy for rival multinational firms - Burkett & Randle, headed by Zen-master Howard Tully, and Omnikrom, led by bullying blowhard Dick Garsik. This idea sets the plot off into admittedly unpredictable directions leading to the pursuit of a secret formula. With the use of multiple gliding split screens as scene transitions (like an episode of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/24/dp/B001L5SRJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">24</a>), it all starts to feel a little too familiar down to the climax which rests on their faith in one another's actions, which of course, reflects the shakiest of intentions. Neither obviously wants to be the first to show any weakness or confess any hint of unconditional love for the other. There are no rules in the games of one-upmanship constantly at play here, and this does lead to some intriguing set pieces. By the end, however, it all proves just wearing.

It's hard to believe it's been nearly two decades since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pretty-Woman/dp/B00081U7HC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pretty Woman</a>, but Roberts still shows the same effortless charisma as Claire. Her face has now hardened into sharp angles and plains with her famous smile downsized, yet it all works for the smart, tough-minded character she plays here. Owen really plays the traditional ""girl"" part here as Ray since he is the one who displays more obvious hurt and disappointment as their relationship evolves. Luckily, he uses his alternately rough-hewn and debonair manner to give his feelings of vulnerability a nice ironic edge. The other actors fare well in roles that suit their screen personas - Paul Giamatti shows the intoxication of megalomania as the obnoxious Garsik, while Tom Wilkinson plays closer to the vest as the ber-orderly Tully. Denis O'Hare and Tom McCarthy (director of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Visitor/dp/B0015OKWKI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Visitor</a>) are mostly in the background during the plot machinations, but there is a nice bit by Carrie Preston as a perky travel agent willingly seduced by a double-dealing Ray. The 2009 DVD contains only one significant extra, an informative commentary track from Gilroy and his brother John, who serves as the movie's editor and co-producer.",1252800000,,4496,6.491666666666666

3880690,3,B0029RVZGA,"I used to love the Spy Vs. Spy bits in MAD magazine.  It's no secret then, that I enjoyed this film. `Duplicity' is a twisty, witty, globe trotting spy's night out at your favorite Italian restaurant, with a fine bottle of the house reserve. Of course, Julia Roberts and Clive Owen serve it up in a wonderful presentation. They play ex-spooks available to the highest bidder. Add a side dish of Paul Giamatti and Tom Wilkinson, vying for your attention and we have a who's-gonna-do-it in the grand tradition. If either of them went up in the supporting actor category, it would be to close to call. They made excellent use of the time and limited material they were provided with.

Owen has made great strides since his entrance onto the main stage in Croupier. He has steadily moved up the ranks and is now rubbing elbows with major star power. Not bad for a boy who seemed to misstep when overlooked as the heir to the 007 dynasty. Was it a fluke that he looked like the real McCoy (if only for a moment) decked out in a white dinner jacket for his first poolside scene with Ms. Roberts? Maybe. At any rate, Owen interacts well with Ms. Roberts and shows fine form. It appears that he is now firmly entrenched as the go to guy, the UK version of Nicholas Cage if you will. They even resemble one another.

Ms. Roberts is still A number one.  She is quite cool and handles the role well. What, with a wagonload of talent on her heals it won't be long before she is bumped up to the Grand Old Dam home for yesterdays leading ladies. Don't worry about her; she will be rewarded with elegant but tempered roles from here on out, albeit in the supporting category.  There she will join the likes of Faye Dunaway, Helen Mirren, and Diane Carroll who have kept a seat warm for her at the bridge table.

`Duplicity' was written and directed by Tony Gilroy. He has an impressive resume as a writer: The recent `State of Play', `Michael Clayton' and the `Bourne' Trilogy, He also directed `Michael Clayton'. The plot twists in `Duplicity' are complicated only if you have the attention span of an action film connoisseur. In `Duplicity', I found comedy, romance, suspense and intrigue.  I also like the fact that not too much is given away early on.  As an example, we do not know exactly why the services of the ex-agents are required. Gilroy does a solid job in piecing it together though (much like he did with Michael Clayton).

`Duplicity' is rounded out with nice performances from Oleg Shtefanko, as Owens' field ops assistant; and Denis O'Hare, with Rick Worthy as the ops team leaders who provide some nice comic touches.

I recommend the film as seen on the Blu-ray edition.  The picture is excellent, the sound quality superb (5.1 DTS HD, digital surround). I watch the material on a 40"", 120hz, 1080p high-end screen. I use headphones for all my reviewed as well. The extras however are limited to the `My Scenes' feature mainly commentary provided by director Tony Gilroy and editor John Gilroy. That is OK, as I only use the commentary for subsequent screenings of films I find outstanding. The `Making of' featurettes are nice, but not expected. Finally, I review all screenings directly after viewing.",1252627200,,3209,4.612280701754386
3880691,3,B0029RVZGA,"3.5 stars. This movie is mostly a triumph of casting and production design over a labyrinthine plot, but it's good, stylish fun nonetheless. Julia Roberts and Clive Owen reunite (after 2004's ""Closer"") for this sparkling and often incomprehensible romp through various capital cities of the world as two competing corporate spies who fall in prickly love despite their all their best professional instincts. Just who's conning who here becomes the central question of the convoluted flashback flashforward flashback again plot. Trying to keep it all straight will be a guaranteed headache-inducer; better just to sit back and enjoy Julia and Clive having such a great time onscreen, and looking fabulous doing it. Owen here shows just what he could've brought to the James Bond franchise, and Julia's patented laugh takes us back to 'Pretty Woman' days. Tom Wilkinson and Paul Giamatti as their respective bosses bring their own memorable energy. Just how much these two CEOs loathe each other is amply demonstrated during a slo-mo opening title fistfight. Though thoroughly modern, 'Duplicity' definitely pays homage to the kind of picture Cary Grant and Barbara Stanwyck used to make. It's a welcome return to old-school Hollywood glamor with a 21st century twist.",1252540800,2,1266,5.303482587064677
3880692,2,B0029RVZGA,"Julia Roberts achieves the impossible: no sexual chemistry with one of the hottest men on film.  Her scenes with Clive Owen are flat and unconvincing.  She ""acts"" fiesty with him in her usual manner, but when they actually have to kiss or jump in bed, it's like Roberts pulls back completely and is kinda grossed out.  Hard to imagine, I know.  She's still carrying alot of baby weight, which may be why she's completely covered in most scenes, and the two exchange maybe three lukewarm closed-mouth kisses the entire time.  I would have demanded that no less than 5 fully nude sex scenes with Owen be written in to my contract, but that's me.  He looks hotter than hot and his husky bedroom voice is showcased perfectly in most scenes.  The corporate espionage plotline is pretty funny, if completely Byzantine.  Tom Wilkinson and Paul Giamatti do the best they can trying to muster outrage and deep personal conviction about... face creams and lotions.  Their opening scene over the credits is hilarious.  There are also plot holes galore: if Roberts can take a photo of a document with her Blackberry, why was one entire scene necessary???  The cinematography is very Ocean's 11, which I liked.  Roberts has some chic outfits and handbags, but with her signature hip waddle, they look cheap at times.  Gwynneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett or Maggie Gyllenhaal would have been better choices by far.",1252454400,,1397,4.86864406779661
3880693,4,B0029RVZGA,"""Duplicity"" is a reflection of the current state of corporate maneuvering as well as the state of romantic relationships. The dynamics between Roberts and Owens are reminiscent of Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo in ""The Thomas Crown Affair.""  They are a lot alike, which draws them to each other. But, in this instance, their strengths become their weaknesses.  By being the best corporate ""spies"" in the game, their current client uses their proclivity to ""double cross"" against them. The plot can be confusing, but the concept is discernible.

As eminent psychologist Alfred Adler once noted, we are slaves to our motivations. Once individual motivations are uncovered, the individual can be manipulated. The excitement and challenge of ""Duplicity"" is the machinations that manifest through the intrigue.

I highly recommend ""Duplicity.""

3880694,3,B0029RVZGA,"Julia Roberts has seen better days and better characters.  Here she just couldn't bring the vitality and charm necessary to convince me that Clive Owen's dapper and suave but cautious double agent and schemer would be head over heels in love with her jaded and untrusting con-artist and corporate spy.  I know that might sound like I'm applying a double standard, but it's not just that Julia Roberts has aged, it's that the role was unsympathetic and she was unconvincing in it; by contrast, Clive Owen's role was something of a stereotype and not so much of a stretch from another recent role of his in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-International/dp/B001V7UTV6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The International</a>, but he is convincing in the role and brings an intriguing combination of jaded and optimistic.  While this isn't Roberts' worst outing and isn't Owens' best they're both mostly interesting to watch and there are elements of this film that I found quite entertaining.  Tom Wilkinson and Paul Giamatti give the standout performances here as jealous rival CEO's, whose fistfight on an airport tarmac is almost worth the price of admission (or a rental).  The direction and look here is engaging and assured, the cinematography is top notch, and the editors did intriguing things with multiple screens, but sometimes less is more as in Tony Gilroy's better and more gripping film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Michael-Clayton/dp/B00121QGPY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Michael Clayton</a>.

Duplicity aims to be an old school Hollywood caper comedy and battle of wits between a man and a woman who marshall together against the world, but with a postmodern spin -- and it almost makes it, but tries so hard to keep the audience guessing that it could threaten to lose them.  It mostly makes sense in the end, but only because nearly all that is confusing gets explained all too clearly all of a sudden in preparation for a final twist.  There are other moments and elements of chronology that are never really explained.  I like movies that make me pay attention and keep me in wonder, but there has to be a better payoff and there has to be something that really engages me throughout.  I wanted to really like this one, and did, somewhat, but had mixed feelings in the end.  I can't recommend this strongly, but if you're in the mood for a caper you could do a lot worse.",1252368000,,2474,5.317948717948718

The repetitive double-crosses, flashbacks and flash-forwards become so monotonous that the ""twist ending"" has no punch whatsoever.

3880698,1,B0029RVZGA,"If you've ever seen the film THE STING then you've seen, perhaps, the greatest con artist movie ever made. Unfortunately, ever since directors and writers have been trying to top this film with little or no success. Some come close but most fail miserably like DUPLICITY.

Julia Roberts and Clive Owen star as Claire Stenwick and Ray Koval, a CIA agent and MI6 agent respectively, who meet and fall into bed together some time back. She takes information from him and leaves him behind with a grudge. Fast forward to the present and we see Ray working for a corporate spy group and who is his contact? None other than Claire.

The duo spar back and forth every time they meet from here on out. Well, at least in the present they do. Both have gone freelance and now work in the world of corporate espionage. Claire is undercover at a corporation run by Tom Wilkinson while actually working for his main competitor Paul Giamatti. This results in the routine back and forth play between the two leads of the film.

But all is not what it seems as we travel back in time. The two met up again prior to this meeting and fell in bed all over again. As they discuss who did what to whom in the world of spies, Claire begins to peek Ray's interest when she discusses the option of leaving. For what reason? To scam those involved with corporate spying and take them for as much as they can.

Of course the pair did make this decision way back then and we move forward again to see if they can pull it off or not. At the same time we have to figure out if they are truly in love with one another or if they will end up scamming one another as well.

So where does this movie go wrong? How can a movie starring two of the biggest box office stars go bad? Easy. Director and writer indulgence. Director/writer Tony Gilroy takes what could have been a decent film and makes it so convoluted that from one moment to the next you're not quite sure who is on which team. And by the end of the film even THAT changes.

The first problem lies in the overuse of flashback in this film. He did the same thing in MICHAEL CLAYTON. The movie gives us clues but sparingly and always done in flashback. So we start a number of years prior, we come back to the present, we go back again, we come back again, we go back months, we come back, we...well you get the idea. And each flashback doesn't necessarily move the story forward so much as just give us more details on the past and how we got to where we are now. It makes weak padding to a film that could have been shorter.

A good mystery or con artist film offers clues to the viewer to give them an idea where it will lead. It involves you as you watch the story unfold. This film gives you meaningless details off and on that do nothing more than bore you. I honestly found myself dozing 3 times while watching this movie. Those clues that are offered should give you the chance to piece the puzzle together as you go. This film gives information but no clues and the ending comes out of left field with no hint of anything involved in the resolution. This leaves you feeling cheated for wasting two hours.

The only thing you can give anyone credit for in this film is the actors. Both turn in decent performances with what little they have to deal with. Both still look good. Both carry their weight. And the supporting cast does a great job too. Unfortunately they all do a good job in a bad film.

I rarely find a movie I can't find anything to support. I've even liked some low grade Z movies and found something entertaining in them. The bad news is that I can't find a thing to recommend in this movie. It's not even a film I'd like to go back and watch a clip or the preview of. With the number of choices available at the rental counter, even one of those old drive in Z films would make better viewing than this film. Avoid it.",1251763200,10,3871,4.25578231292517

3880701,3,B0029RVZGA,"Tony Gilroy's films (such as Michael Clayton, Dolores Claiborne, the Bourne series etc) are bright, fast paced, and full of good dialogue. And they keep the audience involved and entertained.  Here, in DUPLICITY, he directs his own script, adds a cast of fine actors, finds locations that are fascinating, and paces this journey into the world of corporate espionage  with an eye to the brain of the audience.  And that seems to be where the trouble with this film begins.  Yes, it is refreshing to see a film that is not dependent on fancy car explosions, alien invasions, and gross brutality, a film that challenges the viewer to piece the fragmented story line together and keep pace with the twists and turns of the story.  But that is where Gilroy as director loses control.  By flash forward and flash backward sequences that fail to do more than show off his characters' repartee he leaves the viewer dangling with self indulgent 'can you figure this one out' moments that take away from character development in a gimmicky manner.

Another problem is that there is very little chemistry between Julia Roberts and Clive Owens as the spy couple du jour: Roberts looks unflatteringly old and Owens seems on the periphery of attraction to her - again, more the fault of the direction than the screen presence of the actors.  Tom Wilkinson is barely in the film after the opening titles sequence that adds little to the movie concept that follows other than giving the director an opportunity to display his cinematographer's gifts in a slow motion fight with Paul Giamatti. The film seems for naught in the end - the good points drowning in the production and cockiness of a writer that usually knows how to pull off caper films such as this.

Maybe that was an economical way of saying you were in a flashback. Or maybe the film on the cutting room floor got so tangled that the editor called it a night and just spliced together whatever was still lying around.

Well, I thought, there's a cure for all of this.  Surely the wise, intelligent DVD compilers would provide us with SCENES IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER, so I could watch the film again and figure it out. No such luck.  No such wisdom. No such intelligence.

Julia Roberts' star quality is undeniable while Clive Owen cuts every expression, be it exasperated or relieved, convincingly and sexily. (B)",1250726400,,666,5.737373737373737
3880712,2,B0029RVZGA,"I found this film very confusing.  I realize it is an elaborate spy vs. spy in a corporate espionage matter.  One spy is Julia Roberts and the other is Clive Owen. At first it seems like she is the one with the upper hand as she rolls him after one wild night.  Then the scene shifts and he has gotten one over on her.  They leap in and out of bed at various points because they are wildly attracted to one another.

It didn't work for me.  If sparks were jumping between these two, if love and lust were in the air between them, I couldn't sense it.  So there were two things we were supposed to care about: would Julia and Clive get together and, secondly, which of their clients would win in the spy war?  More than an hour into this film, I realized I did not care about the resolution of either issue.  I stopped watching it, I was that bored.

I am not a huge fan of Julia Roberts although I think she is talented.  She just rarely does it for me as a romantic interest.  Conversely, I LOVE Clive Owen and it is very rare for me to be bored with him.  I also really liked CLOSER which also featured Owen and Roberts.  They didn't need wild attraction to one another in that film though.

Much to my surprise, the NEW YORK TIMES absolutely loved this movie.  Its review found this movie a stunning pairing of Roberts and Owen plus the spy scenario vastly entertaining.  Its review says, ""It's a caper movie, a love story -- with Clive Owen and Julia Roberts, no less -- an extra-dry corporate satire. However you describe it, 'Duplicity' is superior entertainment, the most elegantly pleasurable movie of its kind to come around in a very long time."" I was shocked to read this.  I read the whole review and it's as if we were seeing two different movies!  So go over and read that review if you are still interested in this film.

3880713,4,B0029RVZGA,"I think the writer/director of the Bourne series had set a very high expectation for all, even more so with the presence of Julia Roberts and Clive Owen. Sorry that fans of action thrillers like Bourne""s"" and Taken will be disppointed. For those who can enjoy a classy romance with a good spy/agent plot (and shrewd script, too), better if you are a fan of Roberts or/and Owen, you will enjoy the film very much (perfect if you watch this with a glass of wine). Otherwise, please give this a pass. p.s. Roberts' acting is brilliant in this movie.",1249862400,7,546,4.525252525252525
3880714,3,B0029RVZGA,"A bit like a less energetic ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"", but with a high-falootin' chronology and a proposed glossiness that does not really deliver, ""Duplicity"" still manages to be an entertaining enough mishmash of corporate espionage, intrigue, and office-to-bedroom politics. It's not going to win any awards but is, as a lot of movies are, a pleasant exercise in visual storytelling, with attractive leads and just enough plot to keep you interested.

The plot is less than it seems at first glance: Roberts and Owen play corporate spies, who, having shared a turbulent romantic past, find themselves working the same job in the present. Enter a forgettable supporting cast of ""Hey! I know him from somewhere"" C-listers, a satisfyingly megalomaniac turn from Paul Giamatti as an exclusives-obsessed CEO, and fairly trite direction by The Bourne Trilogy's Tony Gilroy, and you'd be forgiven for thinking this isn't a very good movie.

It's not bad, though, and you have the combined talents of Roberts and Owen (and Giamatti) to thank for that: there's plenty of Star Quality and some mild comic relief going on to keep your interest, and while this is no James Bond (the twists and turns are too predictable for that), ""Duplicity"" isn't a bad lot/

Don't expect a lot from this one, and certainly don't bother spending money on buying it - rental is plenty. It could have been better, but that could be said of all films. There's tons of missed opportunity in ""Duplicity"": Kathleen Chalfant and Tom Wilkinson are definitely able to deliver more than the screenplay allows them, ditto the plot - cutting up the timeline to mask a fairly bog standard storyline never works, and here it's more noticable than in most films.

With this in mind, after the final reel has rolled, you could be forgiven for thinking ""... ...huh."", but, while you're in the middle of it, the likeable hijinks and competent performances by the three central characters will certainly keep you entertained.

Rent it, it's a Tuesday night movie.",1249603200,9,2015,4.949704142011834
3880715,5,B0029RVZGA,Julia Roberts has her first leading role in five years and commands the screen like the movie star she is. This is a dialogue driven romantic/comedic/dramatic thriller. And it really does have some of the best dialogue on film in quite a while. And the chemistry with Clive Owen is undeniable (who is always at his best when opposite Roberts). Paul Giamatti and Carrie Preston are a lot of fun in supporting roles. It is pretty perfect.,1249430400,7,436,4.675324675324675
3880716,4,B0029RVZGA,"Rarely have two leads ever been brought together that have this much on-screen chemistry. I say this even realizing that Julia Roberts and Clive Owen were in ""Closer"" together and I think this film eclipses that. The story has one two many twists but the characters are so rich and the way in which some of the plot points play it out is just genius. Also, the dialogue is some of the best I've heard in any movie in the past few years which is important for a movie that is dialogue driven. This movie is definitely better than the two star ratings it has gotten on here so far. It's incredibly fun to watch and definitely worth a viewing.",1249430400,,640,4.341666666666667
3880717,2,B0029RVZGA,"...and absolutely nothing to do with this movie. This was supposed to be a SLICK (am I saying this LOUD ENOUGH to the directo?) mouse-chasing-its-tail kind of movie. Instead, Julia Roberts falls in love. Instead, Clive is filled with doubt. Results: both are obviously suckered by the very people that hired them. From the very beginning, you can see that money is NOT the root of all evil; it's not even sex (though that's where the blame is being leveled). It's the idle mind; too bad neither character learned to think like the devil. If you don't trust anyone, you better trust yourself.",1249344000,,591,4.747572815533981
3880718,2,B0029RVZGA,"Clive Owen is the greatest thing to come along in the Leading Man Department since George Clooney, and, come to think of it, Duplicity is a movie that would very much like to recapture the spark of that classic Clooney vehicle Out of Sight. Julia Roberts, on the other hand, is no Jennifer Lopez. Roberts has aged into a technically competent but utterly uncharismatic actress, and she plays an essentially unattractive character here unattractively. It's a role that really needed some of that old Roberts sparkle, but most of the time, she just seems old. The ultimate selling-point for this movie, then, is Tony Gilroy's script. Gilroy wants us awfully to see how clever he is, but this tale of double-crossing double agents really just plays like an overlong episode of the old TV series Alias, but funnier. By the time Duplicity lurches to its rather logically fuzzy conclusion, the final twist isn't nearly as surprising as Gilroy thinks it is. As a director, meanwhile, Gilroy wants awfully to be Steven Soderbergh, even resorting to split-screen devices and non-chronological narrative elements. But he just doesn't have Soderbergh's frisson. Among the supporting players, Tom Wilkinson is utterly wasted, while Paul Giamatti (although a little bit hammy and more than a little too young for the role he's playing) continues to demonstrate why he's his generation's finest character actor. Movies come alive when his funny mug comes on screen.",1248912000,20,1451,5.1265822784810124
