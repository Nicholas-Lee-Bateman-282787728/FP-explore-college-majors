5135080,3,B0086IMOA2,"I'm not one to diminish the Red Scare of the 1950s.  The American citizenry had every right to be legitimately frightened of Communism after the Soviet Union obtained nuclear technology and a war being conducted in Korea.  That said ""My Son John"" comes off as something of a dated diatribe.  Robert Walker who plays a government official accused of Communist sympathies died during the production of the film.  His passing probably caused a number of rewrites which gives the film something of an unwieldy feel.  In the scenes Walker is in he is mesmerizing giving a reassuring face to a doctrine that threatened so many peoples core belief systems.  The film is somewhat hindered by over the top performances by Dean Jagger and notably Helen Hayes as Walker's god fearing parents.  A provocative film for sure not without its flaws.",1381449600,,833,4.9071428571428575
5135081,3,B0086IMOA2,"John is possibly a Communist living in a conventional household with Helen Hayes as his over-bearing bother and Dean Jagger as his tough father who cannot understand or forgive Robert Walker's ""politics.""  A little too sentimental film by the master of sentiment, Leo McCarey who is more famous for AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER!  So be warned, Helen Hayes cloying mother role is a bit over the top but Walker's role is worthwhile, to see this underrated actor after his triumph in Hitchcock's STRANGERS ON A TRAIN. MY SON JOHN is not an easy film to buy, but I did find it at amazon and it was recorded from a very good print.  In fact, Walker died during the shooting and Hitchcock supplied some footage to the director to complete the film, which I never saw till 2013.

5135085,3,B0086IMOA2,"I have just recieved and watched the Blu-ray version of ""My Son John"".. I'de seen it when I was a teen ager in the 50's and I thought it was pretty slow, but interesting. I went to see it because of Robert Walker who had been MGM'S Golden Boy next door. He was such a sweet charming guy in those Golden Age of MGM films. But of course Walker never got a chance to really act until he got from beneath MGM's grasp. Like he did in Hitchcock's ""Strangers On A Train"". And I don't believe that Leo McCarey produced or directed anything quite like this either. Poor Robert Walker had a sad personal life and I believe it showed in his face in this film. And it's a shame that he passed away, because he had just proven what a great actor he really was. But I don't believe they had the help back in the early 50's that they do now. Help that may have saved Robert Walker. Helen Hayes was also very good, but I thought that half her scenes were drawn out too long and very overacted. (excuse me Helen Hayes fans, but that's the way I saw it)
I know they probably didn't know really how to deal with communism on film 'back in the day', but some of the scenes were very vague. And like Kurt Corbin said in his review that it was hard to catch onto what Robert Walker's character ""John"" was really up to. And I really couldn't really tell if he was 'all that bad'. Because my open-mind is set in the new millennium, not in the early 50's. What was John really up to?
What were the unlawful activities? Yes it was rather vague. But I do remember as a child and teenager the sence of patriotism all around me. I sort of miss that 'long ago feeling'. I'm afraid with all that's going on today people don't know what to believe anymore and that's a damn shame. Dean Jagger was also very stong as a real old fashioned patriot. God bless his character. And I remember many like that. Oh yeah. So I say this is 'a time capsule of the way people thought back in the day. And God bless each and every one of them.

5135086,4,B0086IMOA2,"One of the best things to happen in the world of home video in recent days has been Paramount releasing a virtual explosion of classic titles on both Blu-ray and DVD under the Olive Films label.  The stellar releases continue with MY SON JOHN, an anti-Communist picture from the early fifties that's part political thriller and part family drama, featuring an outstanding cast that includes Helen Hayes, Dean Jagger, Van Heflin and, in his final screen appearance (he died during the film's production), the great Robert Walker.
The story concerns some proudly patriotic and religious parents (Hayes and Jagger) who begin to have suspicions that their oldest son (Walker) is a Communist.  Walker gives a fascinating performance, similar to his role in Hitchcock's STRANGERS ON A TRAIN but this time giving his character a kind of scoffing arrogance to go along with his sinister charm.  You get the feeling that this guy is so much smarter than everyone else that he finds their beliefs and traditions rather amusing.
Script-wise, the film has some weaknesses.  There seems to be a conscious effort to avoid any specific explanations of what's going on regarding unlawful activities: we never really learn exactly what John has done or get any insight into his political philosophy other than a few vague inferences here and there.  One keeps hoping that John and his father will have a meaningful conversation about the relative merits of communism versus democracy, but it doesn't happen.  This is one case in which some over-the-top patriotism would have added some punch to the story.  Further, the fact that Robert Walker died before the film was completed (the shots of him in the last part of the movie are taken from STRANGERS ON A TRAIN) leads to a somewhat unsatisfying ending.
Script problems aside, MY SON JOHN is one of those movies that can be appreciated both as a drama and as a historical document in the sense that it's very much a product of the time in which it was produced.  Admittedly, it's not for the casual viewer - some people would undoubtedly find it too long and overly talky.  It's not as entertaining as THE RED MENACE or as well done as I WAS A COMMUNIST FOR THE FBI.  However, if you're someone who enjoys watching fine actors and loves films that reflect a particular period in history, MY SON JOHN is a thought-provoking movie that will stay in your memory long after you've seen it.",1345507200,26,2419,4.821256038647343

5135090,4,B0086IMOA2,"PLOT: a close knit Catholic family is about to find the oldest Son is a communist.

1951~ The USA is at the ""height"" of the RED Scare /Communist worry. This starts with a middle age Couple (HELEN HAYES) and (DEAN JAGGER) going to mass with two of their sons. The two sons have on military uniforms and the family joke about the usual ....Helen taking too much time to get ready. They arrive home and the two brothers leave for military duty and catch a ride with the family Doctor. The air builds with strain when the oldest son...John shows up (ROBERT WALKER) clearly John and his father do not see eye to eye. John (WALKER) comes across as a know it all and spouts 'radical"" opinions on everything. He clearly looks down on his parents. Soon John and his father argue. When DEAN shoves his son in the kitchen.....Helen breaks up the strained and on going bickering between father and son. John has his pant leg tore. after changing his pants he tells his mother to ""give the clothes"" to the church clothing drive. When John leaves it becomes clear Helen is not well and she is ""worried"" about the changes in her favorite son John. Van Heflin shows up as a man they had a minor fender bender with and Helen more than brags about her family. We later find out that Heflin is really an FBI agent keeping an eye on John. The paper headline is the arrest of a FEMALE communist agent. and John calls his mother and wants the tore pants ""retrieved""...this makes no sense and Helen gets the pants and finds an ""mysterious key and chain"" in the pants pocket and takes the next plane to surprise John with the pants. While in Washington DC~ Helen is being followed by Heflin and the FBI because of her son John. Heflin again tells her that John and the ARRESTED communist women were ""involved"" so Helen takes the key to Communist girls apartment and realized the KEY unlocks the Communist girls door. Helen now confronts the truth that John is a communist. AS she confronts John she returns home and sends for the doctor who feels she is a bit hysterical. John is now...realizing he is in over his head and calls FBI man Heflin who talks him into coming to the FBI for his own safety and the Commy gang is hot on his trail. This Is a good movie....but unless you were raised in this era not likely to hold the interest. Helen Hayes  is outstanding as the mother who overlook the obvious in loving her oldest son. Jagger is the solid American man who loves his son but loves his country more. Walker is very good as the arrogant cold John who clearly humors his parents home spun 'outdated"" views when he comes home. I give it 4  STARS~ Helen Hayes steals the show. Robert Walker died shortly before this movie was released due to a medication ""reaction"".....screenplay won an Oscar nomination. at times HOKEY but still a good view of the paranoid times of the Communist scare.",1454889600,,2868,4.459047619047619

5135111,3,B0086IMOA2,"This is a three-star movie for me because of Helen Hayes and Dean Jagger both of whom delivered a stellar performance in spite of a smarmingly, patriotic script by Leo McCarey. It is telling of the political atmosphere of the time that McCarey actually received an Oscar nomination for the script, while Helen Hayes' performance was ignored. It is also not surprising that McCarey had an enthusiastic conservative bend in his character which led him to believe that he needed to instruct Americans on their moral responsibilities.
Sadly, Robert Walker died during the filming of this strange movie. His disagreements and disgust with McCarey's directing certainly must have played a part in Walker's nervous breakdown.
It is heartening to see that movie critics gave it poor reviews mostly for the script. I think it is appropriate that it is in black and white as the tone of the movie is dark and disturbing. It was a time when Joseph McCarthy was ranting about the infestation of communists everywhere, and people were generally frightened and unsure of the future. If nothing else, the movie is part of the historical record of how close America came to becoming a fascist state or worse - a state of paranoia that existed in the very communist nation it feared.",1429660800,,1266,4.8930232558139535

At first, I could put myself in John's shoes, avoiding family and all the baggage and baby stories and memories in favor of something more intellectually stimulating.  Of course he would have a difficult relationship with his father, prefer to stay away from the old values of religion and patriotism his small-town parents stand for - he's the next generation, the one his parents have counted on to bring their dreams to fruition rather than seek out new ones of his own, experiment with new philosophies and political ideas. Superb cast.  I've never seen Helen Hayes or Robert Walker better, as well as the rest of the cast.  Well crafted story, great script, great print/sound quality.  A real different side of the ""witch hunts"" of the anti-Communist era, different way to view ""liberalism"" and politics, nationalistic fervor, American pride, mother love, family dynamics.

Walker plays the older son of a middle class family. He is brilliant and becomes a famous scholar. His mother (played by Hayes) is a liberal woman, while his father (played by Dean Jagger) is a High School teacher and patriot. His two younger brothers have just shipped out to Korea. While at college Walker becomes enthralled by a communist professor and joins the Party. He then becomes involved in espionage. He lies to his mother about his affiliation, but she eventually discerns his real intentions.

The dialogue is outstanding and takes this film to the highest level as Walker character has to fight a personal battle over the view that the end justifies the means.
