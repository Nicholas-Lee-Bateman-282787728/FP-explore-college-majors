6097423,5,B00GOYC3D8,"If you're a skier, you must watch this movie.  It is such a moving film that makes me pumped to go skiing and skydiving.  I might skip on the base-jumping though.

Shane was such an inspiration and it's a real shame is life got cut short.  He's a great example of living life to its fullest.  I didn't realize how big of an impact he had on the skiing community until I watched this movie.

I've watched this three times and will continue watching it regularly.",1451347200,,461,4.3023255813953485

6097450,5,B00GOYC3D8,"Wonderful, brilliant, special movie. We were channel surfing for football, came across the movie and promptly forgot about watching the game.  We haven't stopped thinking and talking about it. Loved it. Thank you Sherry.

Reading some of the other reviews - this is a terrific portrayal of a great man who loved life, had great friends, beloved husband to a great wife with their child.  They all made choices with their lives as we do with each of our lives - who are we to critique?  I'm quite a bit older but thinking about the movie made me remember the value of pushing my limits a bit out of my comfort zone.",1420156800,,614,4.455357142857143
6097451,5,B00GOYC3D8,"Watch this and it will very likely motivate you in many ways.  Feeling young, staying young at heart, not being afraid to let your kid side shine, challenging yourself above mediocrity.  The guy flat out at the spirit of a lion.  One critical comment is he should have gone back to easier sky dives instead of base and manageable ski lines when he brought a kid into the world.  Buy it, watch it again and again and go find a passion and chase it big time!",1419811200,,456,4.267441860465116
6097452,1,B00GOYC3D8,"I'm angry right now that anyone in the world would shed a tear or be upset by the death of this man. He spit in the face of death a thousand times and laughed even at the possibility of dying....OR....leaving his loved ones behind that apparently meant nothing to him.

Here's a guy that is so selfish that he cares NOTHING about his child's future or how others will be crushed by losing a loved one. He did what he wanted in order to not have to work a job no matter how much pain that brings to others or his absence being a husband and father or son, so why would I ever feel sorry for his passing??

I feel terribly sorry for his family that must go on living and dealing with a needless, senseless death that did nothing good for anyone in the world. It's not like you died in the line of duty or helping others to live.

I'm sorry that most will read this note and be angry at me, but a million people out here are clinging to a thread of life, doing everything they can to keep that ember burning just to have two more minutes of life with people they love while a un-just death stalks them every second in order to take the life they fight tirelessly to hang on to.

This man HAD LIFE, and chooses to simply throw the dice time after time for no reason at all....but selfish, senseless ego is what it comes down to.

I'm a decorated soldier....X-cop......that admits totally I haven't the courage Shane had to do what he did, if in act that's what you call it because most others simply call it ""nuts"".
May God bless his child, his wife, parents and those that loved him.",1419033600,8,1580,4.201320132013201
6097453,4,B00GOYC3D8,"Shane was obviously a one-off, a guy with less fear about risking his life skiing down near-vertical mountainsides and jumping off buildings and bridges than most of us have just walking down the street. There's some incredible footage of his many astounding feats here, no doubt. But somehow despite all that, I was left feeling that this film could have been better.

No complaints about the endless spectacular stunts shown, and watching it just for that will leave anyone who appreciates true daring exhilarated and maybe exhausted. McConkey routinely went for tricks that even the average daredevil considered insane, and seeing some of them will put butterflies in your gut. There's a lot of mind-blowing footage here, footage that Shane risked his life for time and time again.

Was it worth it? That's the very tough question that this film sort of attempts to answer, rather than simply showing the stunts. But by the sad end (no spoilers here, it's pretty clear from the start that Shane is no longer with us, and if you're watching this you probably know that already), I was left with a few questions about the way this film showed Shane's life.

The best thing here is McConkey's sense of humor. He didn't take life too seriously and was a truly funny fellow. His naked ski runs show a guy who just wanted to have fun, and also to remind others that fun is what skiing, and life, are all about for him. That love of laughter, combined with Shane's maniacal quest for extreme thrills as a way of daily existence, made him a truly unique individual. He did what he loved, every day. How many of us can say that? However you measure success, it can't be far from that.

One fascinating thing early in the film was after he left school and was floating around looking for what he wanted to do. A number of people say, ""He was aimless, and he was living in a little shack, and he was even a busboy."" OMG!! A busboy?! O the shame. So what? The shots of him during that time show a very happy young man doing what he loves. So what was the problem? Many people NEVER figure out why they want to do. Why would the son of a (successful) skibum want to start seeking security when he just got out of school? The guy just wanted to ski. So why do his some of his friends and family look back at it like he was somehow a failure for taking his time, eschewing greed and security for the freedom of chasing his dreams? That's a strange thing here, but Shane showed that following your bliss is how you get to be happy, that's for sure. Was he happy? He sure seemed to be. Maybe guys like him will never be happy unless they are risking their lives. Thanatos for happiness? Some people are just wired that way.

I know some will say, this guy is selfish for risking his life after he was married with a kid. I don't fully subscribe to that notion. His wife married him knowing full well who he was and what he did. They both wanted to have kids, though he wanted them sooner. Upon hearing her say that, my first thought was he knew the odds were that he was going to buy the farm sooner than later at the rate he kept jacking up the risk level in his stunts. Thus he wanted a kid as soon as possible just in case that was true. Is that a selfish thought? Very tough question, and one I can't answer. It was his life to risk, after all is said and done.

But one of the issues with that is that this film makes it clear how deeply affected he was by not having his father around as a kid, and how he ended up idolizing his father's uber-skibum ways, and carried on likewise. Was this in his DNA, or was it a product of his emulating the man his Mom clearly didn't like, seeing as she left him when Shane was 5 and moved thousands of miles away? Interestingly, she comes off as quite bitter here, while his father seems like he's at peace with his son's decisions and life. He never left Shane, it's worth noting; his Mom took him away from his father.

But Shane knew what he wanted from life, and it was what his Dad wanted: thrills and fun! And he sure got them, as this film shows. But one of the things I found a little lacking here, as this film tries to be a doc and not just a typical highlights film, is that they barely mention the many brutal injuries McConkey suffered throughout his career. They're mentioned briefly in passing, and only near the end of the film. I felt they should have been integral to the course of the film; as it is, it all seems almost safe and doable to the average kid watching this, and you know there will be plenty. Shane rarely wore a helmet for some of his most nutty stunts, but hey, he was one in a billion, and most kids don't have his intense skillset. A little more emphasis on safety would have been nice.

For instance, it's mentioned in passing a couple times that Shane was very careful about planning his stunts. But we almost never see him doing that, or hear about how he did it. That is a VITAL detail! This flick often makes it seem like the guy just saw a cliff and skied off it. We need, I mean the kids watching this need, a little more awareness of how much work and planning went into these stunts. At least, I think they do. Maybe I'm wrong, the filmmakers bear no responsibility of that sort, and it's all fun and games until someone pokes your eye out with a stick.

But let's be honest. McConkey died doing an almost pointlessly dangerous stunt, one he obviously didn't prep well enough for. One he was maybe too old to reliably pull off. One maybe he shouldn't have ever attempted with a little daughter waiting for him. One that left her to be raised by her Mom, just like her Dad was. Except she won't get to reconcile with her father years hence.

Does that make Shane selfish? Probably, but I really don't think it's our place to judge him for it. He made his living doing these things. He paid his family's way risking his life. His wife knew that and accepted that's who he was. She's a cool lady and she understood. But his daughter didn't. Will she one day? Probably, but it's still all very sad. Yet in the end, it was McConkey's choice to make, and make it he did.

Which brings up the question this film neatly sidesteps, though it's truly at the heart of the project and of Shane's life: was it all worth it? Was all that crazy footage worth his life? He clearly thought so, and so do the filmmakers, judging by how they avoid the subject of his death until the very end, instead of leveraging his achievements with it as the film goes along. The guy never really grew up, and seeking thrills was his sole raison d'etre, even after having a family. Is that admirable?

That's for each of us to decide, and I wish it was examined more carefully throughout the film. If you read the many books about the Everest catastrophes, for instance, you see over and over men deciding that their thrill of climbing paled in comparison with staying healthy for their loved ones' sakes. It took a near-death experience to wake them up to that. Shane had those basically every day! His decision was to never stop seeking them, because they made him feel good. Is that selfish? Well, look at how many of us are entertained by his risk-taking. We give him (and the cameramen who make their money from others risking their lives) our cash in return for seeing them take chances we never would, or could.

And it's that ""could"" that I wish we saw more of here. McConkey was a freak, a super-talented guy who decided death was just an inevitable side effect of seeking the most extreme thrills. But most of us watching this, and especially the kids, might think they can try this stuff too...without the benefit of seeing how Shane carefully planned the stunts, or what training he put in, or even all of the brutal injuries he suffered, again and again. This film kind of seems like it takes advantage of the footage Shane risked his life for, while rarely showing what work led to that footage. It's all a lark! That feels somehow wrong.

But maybe that's not the filmmakers' job, and it's all about the thrills and the fun. But if that's the case, why was I left feeling sad after watching this? Not just for Shane's wife and fatherless child, but for the 99.999% of kids watching this who will never have the innate talent that McConkey did, but think they do, and take chances far beyond their abilities. And also for Shane, in a way. What drives a man to risk the life he had worked for and achieved (admittedly by risking his life)? We get hints of an honest look at that question here, but somehow it feels not only sad but unsatisfying by the end.

Maybe I'm crazy though, and this is all just radical fun, dude! One thing for sure: if you want to see a lot of death-defying stunts, and one that wasn't, here they are.

6097476,5,B00GOYC3D8,"The story of Shane McConkey is a fun ride that ends too soon, as did his life.  While it doesn't answer all the questions about why Shane pushed himself the way he did, it certainly gives you some good ideas as to what was pushing him.  You can't help be moved by the events that ended Shane's life, it is presented in a very stark and honest way.  There's no way to sugar coat his death, but thankfully it does shield the viewer from the actual grizzly scene.
That aside, you will laugh.  You will feel empathy to his friends and family.  And you will enjoy some of the best skiing ever captured on film.

6097477,5,B00GOYC3D8,"If you've got that thrillseeking blood burning inside of you, you'll greatly appreciate this documentary. Having spent 10 years as a member of the United States Parachute Association and making 796 jumps before it came time to hang up my jumpsuit, watching this film brought back countless memories that I'll always cherish. Yes, you spend enough time in this sport, you'll lose some friends along the way, but just as Shane's amazing thrillseeking passions exhibited, living life to it's fullest potential was a gift not only to the sport he so thoroughly treasured, but also to the countless others who will follow after his footsteps. In all my years jumping, I never encountered anyone who was a fearless as Shane McConkey. But it wasn't a careless fear. He approached every challenge with the utmost preparations and analysis. Unfortunately, just as the saying goes ... there are old skydivers and there are bold skydivers, you just won't find any old, bold skydivers and Shane left the community much too soon.",1413763200,,1016,5.017751479289941
