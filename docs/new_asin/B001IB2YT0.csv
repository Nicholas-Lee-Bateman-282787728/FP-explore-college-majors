3646567,2,B001IB2YT0,"1. I understand that the movie was supposed to be rhetorical/ didactic, but what does it mean to prove the value of human existence? That's nothing for which there is a right answer. To imagine that someone cared about all this desperate motion that goes on on planet earth. Well, that's probably the chimpanzee part of the brain working.

2. So, some species came to planet earth and looked exactly like humans and had the same biochemical profile? They could be injected with sodium pentathol? Um.....ok

3. If aliens came from some distant planet outside the solar system, then they would have to have travelled from a place that was so far away that by the time they perceived human beings doing ""bad things"" and decided to act on it by traveling.....everyone that was involved would have been long dead. (There is probably not enough hydrogen in the sun to be fused to last the time it would take for something to travel from a distant solar system.)

4. The way the scenes were shot was just a bit corny. How was the whole city empty and orderly doing something like this. Was there no rioting or chaos or looting? (""Independence Day"" was a lot more believable in this sense.)

Save your money. Someone  had a bright idea after taking a philosophy course.....but didn't see it all the way through.",1231113600,,1303,4.647826086956521
3646568,1,B001IB2YT0,"To compare this awful movie with ""The day the earth stood still"" is really unfair.
""The day the earth stopped"" is so horrible and such a huge waste of time and money, that you would be better of wasting your time kicking yourself in the head.
It's absolutely impossible to say anything positive about this movie - other than I am glad I didn't have to pay to see it.

Ohh wait - there's one redeeming aspect: One of the ""aliens"" is an absolute knockout - in a kind of porn kind of way.

For a B-movie it belongs more in the eighties - with its very unconvincing scenery og more than unconvincing actors, and the dialogue is - well amateurish.",1230595200,17,642,4.297520661157025
3646569,4,B001IB2YT0,"THE DAY THE EARTH STOPPED
Theasylum.cc
C. Thomas Howell, Judd Nelson
Forget the lawsuits, hype and tension...This is a good Sci-Fier !
C. Thomas Howell can direct and when we watched the extras (Always first for the homework of critics) he has a bigger role then anticipated.
Tiny Juggernaut again comes thru with some reel effects that don't give away the budget.
There is some discussion of Bug Hall, Playing the alien when he is known as the ""New"" Alfalfa from Little Rascals remake ; He did a nice believable turn.
This movie is a throwback to the Old Asylum, Who just went for it on film, Not PC anymore ...Okay There is NUDITY, There I said It !
...Hate to mention this, But script is closer to Michael Rennie / Gort The Robot version then Keanu is attempting .",1228780800,6,767,4.485714285714286
3646570,5,B001IB2YT0,"Not as good as Day the Earth stood still, or Independence Day but I still liked this as well. Giant robots invade Earth, Around the world giant robots are invading the major cities and demanding the human population prove they are worthy to survive or perish forever by morning. Sending a beautiful alien messenger in to reveal the ultimatum, that should do the trick. Acting is great storyline is marvelous so what more could you ask for, convincing with plenty of action and suspense thrown in. I rated this movie an A grade for full on amusing entertainment that will have you guessing as to what is next. The world is trembling and everyone are running for there lives, but no-where to run to. Just imagine that all happening, how much more spectacular can it get. Oops! getting carried away, I'll leave it to you now so refresh your popcorn pick up the movie and judge for yourself as your opinion might be different to mine and make a comment of your own, sit and relax to a night in with a classic of not so long ago. Enjoy!",1394064000,,1031,4.4603174603174605
3646571,3,B001IB2YT0,"Massive robots appear in all of the major world capitals with an ultimatum: Prove the value of human civilization or be destroyed. Josh Myron witnesses an arrival and this is, basically, his story.

Despite its' similarities to 2008's The Day the Earth Stood Still, I thought the Day the Earth Stopped was okay. It was a decent film for it to be C. Thomas Howell's second directorial duty for The Asylum(his first being War of the Worlds 2: The Next Wave). It's not quite as awful as some reviewers here are leading you to believe. Course, it wasn't made on a million dollar budget- after all. It was made on a low-budget. Yes, it shows...but it's a good watch, nonetheless. It was cool getting to see Judd Nelson acting again, even if it was for just a moment. The only thing I saw wrong with the movie was that massive robots appear in all the major capitals around the world....so, why not have more than one or two robots on the screen at any given time? If there were more there, I might buy into the movie alot more.

Overall, it was a good production. Fantastic by low-budget standards. Another recommended movie by The Asylum.",1365120000,,1134,4.5268292682926825
3646572,1,B001IB2YT0,We were unable to watch this movie.  It refused to play.  Has anyone watched it?  I am a C. Thomas Howell fan.,1360800000,,110,3.909090909090909

3646574,2,B001IB2YT0,"I heard one remark on this movie that goes something like this, ""It's like they titled the movie using a thesaurus."" Yeah, this movie feels a lot like they are ""rewording"" a mix of films in an effort to capitalize on as many themes as it can. I see elements of not only The Day The Earth Stood Still, but also films like Independence Day, 2001, Starman, War of the Worlds, and a dash of... oh I don't know... pick any Roland Emmerich world disaster film. There is even nods to The Matrix on the cover design. I'm sure others will find even more films this one borrows from. In spite of all this it's still a straight to video movie that on it's own merits is simply not well thought out, and the execution is just as haphazard for the most part.

The plot isn't the problem as it's straightforward. Hundreds of giant robots... 666 robots to be exact (these guys are really trying too hard to be ironic or poignant)...  referred to as megaliths land all over the Earth. A naked ""harbinger"" and her naked sidekick also arrive (and this nakedness at the beginning of the movie is the sole reason for the R rating). They deemed us a threat to them and plan to irradicate the planet unless the people of Earth can convince the harbinger that we are worth sparing before sunset. Of course this message goes way over the heads of those in charge and begin to do all sorts of stupid things completely contrary to what they should be doing. Luckily one man has the good sense to listen, right?

Not too bad of a story in a nutshell, even if it's been done already. The defining moment of any plot, no matter how simple or complex it sounds in concept, is how well you can execute it on the script. One example (and I'm trying to stick with low budget action/thriller films to be fair) is Mad Max, which is just about a cop avenging his family's death from a bike gang. While it's not Shakespeare the movie could have went into a completely and horribly different direction if it weren't for the script paying attention to some details and focusing more on some character development.

The Day the Earth Stopped did have a some character development, but spent very little time on it. You do get a couple moments of a lucid script, however they are too few and far between compared to the elements of the script that I feel weren't well thought out. One speech between alien and soldier/father doesn't disuade the several instances of hackneyed dialog trying to push the story with the sublety of a sledgehammer.

What can make or break a script, no matter how it's written, is it's execution. Lets look at Blade Runner. Look at the script alone and you have a weak movie. It's just detective noir with very little detective work and an akward bit of romance thrown in. However, as anybody who has seen Blade Runner can tell you, the movie is a must see. Why? The movie didn't focus on the weak script. It focused on elements that enhanced the experience like the setting and tone while downlplaying any of the weaker elements. So even though the script couldn't carry the movie the movie still stood tall.

The Day the Earth Stopped didn't have execution down either. I know it's a low budget movie, but I'm not concerned with the fact the government command center was a collection of old CRT monitors and the same screen graphics over and over. I am not concerned so much with the fact it seemed it was enough to label somebody a soldier by putting a helmet on them and tying a grenade to their shirt. Lots of little faux pas and quirks like that all over the film (so much you can make a drinking game about it). What bothers me is the very simple things you can do to enhance a movie were ignored. Exposition through proper focus of what the camera is catching. Paying attention to subtle details that enhance the theme and mood. I would even be happy if they just had an editor to take into account plot consistencies. What they filmed and presented as a movie was weak. Weaker than the simple plot device or the unrefined script.

This being a sci-fi movie special effects come into play, and to be honest I have absolutely no problems with them. The aliens when they use their powers I feel were done the right way. Subtle enough with the right amount of cinematic flair. I will even go so far as to say even with a bigger budget I can't see a much better execution of those effects. The giant robots? They were done well too; especially for the budget. The flying scenes were akward and luckily extremely few. The rest were pitch perfect with slow and deliberate movements winning over flashy action, which would have killed their imposing coolness. So the one unadulterated plus on this film is how they handled the special effects, hands down.

The acting is very unbalanced. C. Thomas Howell stars and directs this film, and tries to hit the dramatic marks. For the most part he's not bad, but I have seen him do better. Too much of one emotion coming from him and not enough depth and range. Still he's part of the better group of actors. Sinead McCafferty seems to only be there for her looks (being the nude harbinger in the beginning of the film. I don't know if from lack of direction or lack of talent, but her character goes into inconsistent ranges from alienish to completely normal girl with no story queues to back it up. Darren Dalton plays a mostly one dimensional character with a single scene where he can play some depth. I do notice he sneaks in a little more dimension in the character a couple times, but overall it's a wooden performance. Bug Hall as the harbinger's assistance is the only one that plays his part with consistency. Stephanie Greco gets honorable mention as the unnamed government agent with no meaningful speaking part, but gets a fair amount of camera time just looking at a computer screen.

Music is as to be expected for a low budget sci-fi. It sounds like some guy on a synthesizer playing all the music queues trying to sound like a full orchestra in some parts and a club mix on others. The limitations are glaring instrumentally, but the music does hit the necessary level of emotion the film requires.

All in all The Day the Earth Stopped is weak low budget sci-fi movie that fails to make a difference due to both being too much like other sci-fi films and by not standing apart where it counts. I am thinking this movie is best viewed by those of you who are into filmmaking (science fiction especially) so you can use it as a training exercise as to what works and what fails in making a film. There are enough elements to show what does work within a limited budget as well as what ""can"" work if done a little differently. More importantly it can show a young and budding filmmaker what doesn't work and what to avoid.",1310601600,,6771,4.466451091350041
3646575,3,B001IB2YT0,"I just stumbled on it and watched it, thinking I'd last for about 10 minutes, but I ended up watching it to the end.  This is low budget sci-fi with rather well done special effects where it counts, and some at least sort-of-likeable characters.  C. Thomas Howell reminds me a little of Richard Dean Anderson.  If you think of this movie as a long Outer Limits episode you might be able to lower your expectations and enjoy it.

Perhaps over the coming years we can look forward to ""The Day the Earth Moved Not"" and ""The Day the Earth was Stationary"" and ""The Day the Earth was Put in Time Out"".  The possibilities are endless.",1309910400,,627,4.417391304347826
3646576,5,B001IB2YT0,"I read a lot of complaints about how bad this movie was.  In reality I think the producers of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" are giving it the bad reviews.  It has been compared to the remake of this classic and even the producers of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" sue the producers of this film for its comparison.  This may be why so many people are giving this film such bad reviews.

In reality this movie (in my opinion) is better than the Remake of ""The Day the Earth Stood still"".  C Thomas Howell plays a great part and the effects are not really that bad considering this was suppose to be a B-Movie ripoff.  Now a warning to some people who are easily offended -- there is some nudity in this film, but overall it is definitely worth the $6.00 most people are selling it for.",1295740800,3,787,4.213333333333333

3646578,1,B001IB2YT0,"Jut to make sure nobody else has to watch the movie...

In the end all the transformer like megaliths that just stand around and shoot off a couple lasers during the entire movie leave. As best as I can tell because the alien saw a baby being born.

In case that wasn't enough too keep you away...

Stupid movie, terrible acting, unrealistic physics in the CG (although some CG actually looked decent), the plot made no sense, people made decisions that were unreasonable, the science was not reasonable. Multiple EMPs wipe everything out in the entire world - shows globe with all lights going off, even in north america where it is supposed to be daytime as the world will end at sundown - sundown just in new york? the megaliths are everywhere...

3646579,4,B001IB2YT0,"This movie, of course, bears a great resemblance to ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"".  These characters work and are more than copies of the characters from that other movie.  Four stars.

Judd Nelson only has a few minutes of screen time, and he does a good job.  But it's not his movie by any stretch of the imagination.  This movie belongs to C. Thomas Howell, Darren Dalton, and the female Destroyer.  Their characters grow throughout the movie.  The special effects are fair to good.  The acting is good.  The scenes are good.  And, yes, the script is good.

Why only four stars?  I wanted more special effects.  I wanted a greater sense of danger.  I wanted the Doctor's role to be clearer.  Some of the minor characters should have had smaller roles.

The DVD extras are also worth watching.

I am not an Asylum shill; read my other reviews to see what I thought of their other movies.  Some Asylum movies are good, and some are terrible.  I have watched my share of bad movies over the years, and I knows 'em when I sees 'em.",1278633600,2,1032,4.422459893048129

No need to get into the plot at all - just an utterly stupid movie, doesn't even merit a review of the bad parts - it is all bad.",1266624000,4,424,3.9529411764705884
3646581,2,B001IB2YT0,"This movie was released straight to DVD, and it looks like one of those Scifi movies of the week, which once you get past the very cheap looking special effects doesn't have to be a bad thing. In the beginning of the movie we see a bunch of gigantic robots landing on Earth. At the same time two beings who look like humans land in a forest and are both captured fairly quickly and taken to a secret military complex. At first neither one of these beings talk but eventually the female known as Sky in this movie talks to Myron played by C. Thomas Howell. She informs him that she has the ability to read minds, and that the human race is becoming a threat due to there incresed technology with weapons, and unless she is shown the value of this planet and it's people by sunset the planet will be destroyed.

  I can't compare this to The Day The Earth Stood Still, as I haven't seen it yet, however once this movie gets going it's actually not that bad, granted I would not pay ten dollars to see it in the movies, and would certainly never buy it, but it's not a bad scifi movie rental of the week kind of thing. So if you have a rental store, or service like a Netflix and are looking for a Scifi movie to watch on a Saturday night and can get past the low budget effects (Giant Robots and Airplanes look like they are out of a Gozilla movie) then I say give it a shot.  I'm giving it a 2 out of 5.",1257033600,7,1402,4.087272727272727

Well, for starters you'll get a very poor sound track and musical score, uninspired dialog and zombie-like acting, one tarted-up and naked woman, lots of editing mistakes, disappointment that the large robots never really do anything, and the knowledge that you'll never get the 2 hours of your life back that you wasted watching the movie.

I'm giving Day the Earth Stopped a three. It really IS a crappy movie. At the same time, it is FAR superior to Day the Earth Stood Still (2007 version). It actually makes more sense, is easier to follow, and isn't any where near as painful to watch. My expectations were actually exceeded!

In this case, a couple of naked aliens show up on Earth to observe the animals in their natural habitat and decide whether or not they deserve to occupy the same space as they do.  Things don't look good for humanity when some military thugs get a hold of these two aliens and imprison them.  Quelle surprise, the aliens are a bit miffed at this hostile treatment, death threats are made (silly humans, prove your value or else!).  Well, didn't that stymie the American aggressors a tad.  After that, it's up to C. Thomas Howell to prove humanity's worth.  While the military thugs are clearly establishing why humanity should be wiped out, C. Thomas proves his point with the delivery of a baby in the backseat of a car.  Although I don't see how an act of procreation could be considered proof of our value as a species.  Considering the aliens' argument was our intrinsic violent nature, which made us a danger to the entire universe.  Procreation only means more people, more of a threat, more unrest, more destructive capabilities.  How on earth was that the right answer!?!?!?!?!?  Especially considering the military thug's parting shot!
