1394010,5,B000055XM6,"This is beyond a doubt one of the most addictive movies of all time!!Like most of the reviews I've read, I too watched this movie as a kid. I remember our copy being recorded off of HBO and we wore it out. I rent this movie, from the one BLOCKBUSTER in town that carries it, at least once a year. It amazes me when I ask people about this movie and they have never seen it. To this day my family still quotes this movie. ""he wants to know where the old light house is!"" I think it's ""hysterical"" to look back at the things in the movie I laughed at as a child. I don't even know why it was funny to me then because alot of the humor is based more towards adults. I laugh at my own naivite, but it's good to know that you can watch it in front of the kids without much worrying. When you watch this movie for the first time watch it begining to end. You will be amazed at the non-stop humor pouring from every second of it!!",1062979200,14,923,3.9411764705882355
1394011,1,B000055XM6,While the movie it self is a classic the DVD leaves much to be desired. I was disapointed to find that the DVD was in full screen as opposed to the wide screen I prefer. It also received no treatment whatsoever on the transfer. The titles are shakey as well as the picture. If i had to guess they transfered right from a video tape found at a local video store. If i had it to over again I would have stuck to my copy on VHS and spent my money on something else.,1059177600,6,462,3.925531914893617
1394012,5,B000055XM6,"I saw this movie when it first came out when I was a teenager and I never laughed so hard. I must have watched it over and over on video until the tape was no good and it had to be thrown out. I was never able to get another copy again and I don't know why it is hard to find in many video stores, even the ones that carry old movies. It is a great movie for all crowds and I cannot explain how great this movie is because I think you should watch it and then know for yourself.",1048636800,8,478,3.696078431372549
1394013,5,B000055XM6,It's so good that you can't pull your face away from the screen.  Of course for then the effects are kind of corny but It still makes me laugh as hard as I can every time I see it.  When I was a boy I used to watch this non-stop untill I wore out the tape it was on. It's a feel good movie of the day.,1045094400,4,301,3.4776119402985075
1394014,5,B000055XM6,"OH MY GOD!  I have been trying to find this movie for YEARS!  My husband cannot believe that I'm fanatical for this movie.  Tried to explain it, but if they haven't seen it, they won't realize the value of this movie.  My brother and I used to watch this all the time and we would laugh hysterically!  Loved the Hudson Brothers' Show, so this movie was just the perfect venue for them.
IF you want a great parody movie that just sticks in your mind FOREVER (All work and no play makes Caper a friendly ghost- and it's been at least 15 years since I've seen it), then this is the movie for you.  A cult classic!",1041984000,7,610,4.170940170940171
1394015,5,B000055XM6,"My best friend in high school, who unfortunately is no longer with us, hooked me onto this picture.  I had forgotten about it until it somehow popped into my head.  This movie has great one-liners (""Quick, take my picture!""), and although I haven't seen this movie in almost 20 years, I will buy it on DVD just to re-live the memories of great fun with a good friend.  This one is for you, James!",1034899200,3,396,4.324324324324325
1394016,4,B000055XM6,"Saw this when i was a kid, still makes me chuckle now when i think of it. Like that crazy guy on the bike shouting
""WERE ALL DOOMED !!""
and then he crashes. One of the Hudson brothers, his eyebrows keep growing when he tells lies, and many more stupid little things i found amuzing.
I am after a copy of this on VHS or R2 DVD. Anyone know where i can get a copy in the UK ?",1033084800,3,373,3.7341772151898733
1394017,5,B000055XM6,"For those of us who have actually seen this movie, it's almost a cult classic.  If you enjoyed the Hudson Brothers on their 70's tv show, this is even better.  Full of jokes that become funnier every time you see it, and an unbelievable cast!  My husband, parents, siblings, and now nieces and nephews, watch this movie EVERY year at Thanksgiving--an odd tradition, maybe, but we LOVE this movie!  If you don't see it for yourself, YOU'RE DOOMED!",995673600,19,446,4.67948717948718
1394018,5,B000055XM6,"It must be over 15 years since I saw this movie. My best friend at school got his parents to hire it (on betamax) for a week from a dodgy guy with a suitcase. We must have watched it twice a day and would shout lines and imitate characters in class. Completely stupid, but thats just the way I like 'em and I can't wait to see it again.

1394057,5,B000055XM6,"It gets funnier every time we watch it! (no we're not stoned like the tour boat people). It applies to your everyday hum drum life...  Youre DOOMED!  PASS THE SALT!  Get out of the mans pool Fritz!  What difference does it make?!  Librarys closed, all white people must leave.  ""Fritz, your pants are down!""  (BTW cute bunns of steel Brett! Wootwoot!

1394058,1,B000055XM6,"I would like to be writing a review of this item because i purchased it and enjoyed it.  HOWEVER...i am now asking anybody who is looking for this movie to explain why...WHY is this movie, used, at least $81..?  a DVD of a movie from 1983 selling for $81 used is ludicrous.  that there would be somebody selling this used for over $400 is even more asinine.  Can somebody please explain this ridiculous pricing for this movie that came out when i was 8?  mind you, these are used prices because the new option is $180 +.  My wife wants this movie, and i buy everything off of amazon...but this?  This is just pure craziness.  I've never heard of this movie, or the actors, but yet somebody who  bought this movie back in 2004 or so is now going to sell their used, scuffed, dented case, ripped insert...for over $80.  Please fill in the blanks for me so i can understand.",1360972800,,871,4.354037267080745
1394059,5,B000055XM6,"I went to high school with Mark, Brett and Bill Hudson and love this movie! I liken it to Indiana Jones meets Dracula meets the Three Stooges. Great cast and of course so crazy silly! Wish it were easier to find! Love the scene with Dracula (Charlie Callas) so funny! Wish Netflix had this one!",1356912000,5,294,4.363636363636363
1394060,5,B000055XM6,"My ""children"" who now range in ages 33-41, still quote from this movie.  As their mother, I quote right along with them.  ""Fritz! Get out of the man's pool!"" ""YOU'RE DOOMED!"" They never get old.  It's a ""funny every time!"" thing.  Bought a DVD that I am going to try to make copies of for my darlings.  Hard to justify $50-$70 times 4 in this economy.  But once didn't hurt too bad.",1339804800,2,382,4.236111111111111
1394061,3,B000055XM6,"I had not seen this film since my childhood when VHS first came out in Australia so was pleased to find DVD available online as it was one of those  80's vintage comedies I had fond memories of as a forerunner to the Flying High Zucker era flicks.

Was a blast from the past to see it again and had some good laughs with my kids.

Great nostalgia value but not quite as slick and funny to me now as it was when I was a kid, but a great piece of comedy that was perhaps a bit of a pioneer in the spoof genre.  Deserves a spot in the comedy library next to others of the genre on that basis.",1311120000,,589,3.84297520661157
1394062,3,B000055XM6,THIS IS  NOT THE GREATEST MOVIE BUT I'VE SEACHED LONG AND HARD TO FIND IT TO GIVE IT TO MY DAUGHTER AS A GIFT BECAUSE SHE LOVED THIS MOVIE. SO I WAS VERY GLAD TO FIND IT AND GET IT A COUPLE DAYS AFTER I PURCHASED IT.,1280448000,,216,3.595744680851064
1394063,5,B000055XM6,My brother was the recipient of this DVD and he was gobsmacked that it was possible to get it at all. Arrived well before it was due too!,1260748800,,137,3.9285714285714284
1394064,5,B000055XM6,"My husband has been looking for this movie for years now. It went out of print in 2001 so we have been very unsuccessful in finding it. When i saw it on here i had to get it for a Christmas present for him. Well I gave it to him and he almost cryed he was soo happy!

Thanks soo much for giving me the chance to surprise him!!",1198713600,,326,3.7246376811594204
1394065,5,B000055XM6,"I am so glad to get this when came on DVD. I have been a long time fan of the brothers and to find anything with them on the latest technology, well it's rare. And if you can get your hands on this, definitely get it. I wish they would put out more stuff on cd and DVD, like their show Razzle Dazzle.",1194652800,,300,3.7777777777777777
1394087,5,B000055XM6,well the titles says it all. it is comedy at its best with scenes and references we all know twisted into gutbusting laughoramas.,1167782400,,129,4.6521739130434785
1394088,1,B000055XM6,Well after watching this movie..i know why the hudson brothers never won any oscars....Well at least mark hudson did some decent record producing..Bill spawned kate hudson...the acting horrible..lighting was shabby..have to be a REALLLLL  big hudson brother fan to enjoy this,1130025600,4,275,5.7073170731707314
1394089,4,B000055XM6,"For fans of bad tv variety shows this movie is a must. The Hudson Brothers were very amusing for a comedy team but not the best actors in the world. Kate Hudson will probably be the best product from their past (yeah I know only one of them is her father but I can never remember which one). The movie spoofs just about every adventure and ghost movie that was out before it. Lots of Indiana Jones jokes. My favorite line is still a well-worn ""Your Doooooomed!"" Good movie for Halloween to get a break from blood and guts - lots of zombies, little blood. It is a comedy after all.

The DVD doesn't offer much in the way of extras but the transfer is good.",1129075200,,655,4.198412698412699
1394090,4,B000055XM6,"This movie isn't Shakespeare, but it is awfully amusing.  Growing up, my mother found this movie somewhere and, like most boys between 10-15, I could watch it over and over again.  Since then, it holds a special place in my heart, but I did go back recently and watch it again and I still found it pretty amusing (so it isn't a matter of me favoring this movie for nostalgic reasons).  It's full of visual puns and silly dialogue and ridiculous plot threads, but I would still recommend it to anyone who can avoid taking it too seriously.",1127433600,2,538,4.469387755102041
1394091,4,B000055XM6,"I think this is a classic for all horror movie lovers.  It is a parady of most horror movies made in the 60's and 70's.  If you Like movies such as Airplane! , Transylvania 6-5000, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, Top Secret, or the Files from Police Squad, this is another movie you need to have, or need to see.",1125619200,2,311,4.166666666666667
1394092,2,B000055XM6,"I was in this movie and I can hardly watch it.  I was living in Oregon at the time and was working at the Newport Hilton, when the movie company came to town to film this movie.  My brother and I had a blast with the cast and crew, and they just had to get us in the movie...., So, we were put in the scene with John Lariquet(sp?)

Where Richard Kiel comes out of the water and scares us all off the little tour boat.  We were the two young men that had to look stoned right before we fell into that cold water....,

Thankfully, my scene is early in the movie, so I don't have to watch it all to see my scene.  And actually, I am in the same scene twice.  I am also on the bridge looking down at myself as I jump overboard into the water.  Oh the magic of film....,

I was 20 years old at the time, and my brother is 17.  The movie company adopted us, since many of them were surfers, and we were some of the very few Orgonians that surfed at that time.  They were so nice to us and paid us well, and fed us well.  It was one of the funnest experiences in my life, and I still am thankful to all the nice people involved in making this movie.

It never hit the theaters in my area, and took a couple years to show up on HBO, so I didn't know it had been released until my friends started calling me and telling me they just saw me on HBO.  Very cool....,Luckily, they did closeups of my brother and I to make sure our friends would recognize us.  As I said they were really nice...,",1114992000,4,1482,3.9096989966555182
1394093,5,B000055XM6,"This movie is definitely a cult classic. My chunky friend and I haven't seen the movie in almost 20 years and we still call each other frequently, repeating many of the lines...Fritz, your shoe is untied...Fritz, your zipper is down...Fritz, YOUR PANTS ARE DOWN! Fritz, pick up you pants! Are these guys serious? Of course we're serious, why do you think we're dressed like this...thhhhhhhhhh! Some say we're crazy, others say stupid, but when you can laugh at stuff you did when you were a kid it can always change a bad day! Luv ya slim!

1394095,1,B000055XM6,"I don't understand the other reviews.  This movie is not funny.  The acting is atrocious and the story cliched.  The quality of this Image DVD is also bad.  The colors are dull and the sound is so soft I had to max out my volume.
I couldn't watch this.  It's not even suitable for family viewing.  There are some very crude(not funny or creative) moments.  The only explanation for the good reviews is if the Hudson brothers are reviewing incognito.",1085184000,8,449,4.5375
1394096,5,B000055XM6,"Oh Man!  I've been waiting for so long for this movie to show up on DVD.  I'm a self-professed lover of ""stupid movies""- and this one has to top the list.  It is over-the-edge bizarre and totally silly, but you just can't help but laugh.  I would think this movie scores high among the 12-15 age range scoping out all of the dirty subtext.  And,this movie captures such an excellent atmosphere- I think it's visually perfect - including the sets (lighthouse on a cliff- creepy small town) - and the makeup for the ""what difference"" zombies.  Top notch-",1074211200,13,552,4.581632653061225
