8024092,5,B000293OE8,"Spencer Williams Jr. acted in, directed and produced ""Girl in Room 20,"" yet he seems to mainly be remembered as his role of Andrew H. Brown on the Amos 'n' Andy television series from 1951 to 1953, in 78 episodes, 4 are lost! Because he played Andy on Amos 'n' Andy, it seems forgotten he helped pioneer sound in motion pictures in the 1920 or that like Oscar Devereaux Micheaux, also produced movies. He gave positive roles to African-Americans when Hollywood cast black women as maids and black men as buffoons. Amos 'n' Andy was an all black cast except for occasional white actors appeared in a few episodes. They could be lawyers, judges, policemen and police-women as well as business people, not just the characters of George ""Kingfish"" Stevens, and Alvin Childress as Amos, etc. Thanks to Mr. Williams, we can see black made fioms we would have had fewer examples of the less than 100 of the 500 films made, most were lost, sad to say! It was not until the 1970s African-Americans were featured in films other than as side-kicks or nominal roles. Those films with Richard Roundtree and Fred Williams can be found also on Amazon.com and are priced right and worthy of being in your DVD library as well!",1427500800,,1209,4.654205607476635
