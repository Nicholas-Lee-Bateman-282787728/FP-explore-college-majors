1855798,5,B00008O32J,"Man I cant wait for this second ""Kick ***"" season box set! The first season was awsome and I cant wait to add the next one in! Ive already seen most of these episodes and I can assure you that they are funny as hell with holarious quotes, characters, and the elusive secret to who Cartmans dad is! Sadly there will be no commentary by the genius creators bu Im going to blame that on Warner Brothers and not them, but I hear that there will be many other good extra features that you can look forward to.
  So come on down to south park and be prepared to watch this over and over again once you buy it!",1051574400,3,603,4.0588235294117645

I will say the recent seasons have dropped in quality, but the first 10 seasons are AMAZING. I had to buy the actual DVDs because I need to be able to watch this whenever, where ever. And I have actually used this so much. I've had marathons, I've lent it to friends for marathons. I've used it to inspire friends to love South Park as much as me. I'ld say which episode is my favorite, but I can't choose!
It's also cool because this season has an alien easter egg on one of the episode select screens (that's all I'll say; you need to find it yourself)",1456099200,,660,4.246031746031746

1855926,5,B00008O32J,"Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the warped geniuses behind this proudly gross yet brilliant, hilarious and eminently rewatchable series, once noted that they don't like any of the first three seasons of South Park. With all due respect to the talented gentlemen who brought us one of my top series of all time, I have to disagree. This season is actually among my very favorites overall. Sure, like all South park seasons, there are a few episodes that don't work for me. (I guess this is where I shamefully confess that I'm not a Terrance and Philip fan and tend to skip those episodes!) Season 2 also, however, contains some of my very favorite episodes. There's an almost sweet nostalgia to rewatching these earlier seasons of the show, and they have a dash of real heart mixed in with the sneakily thought-provoking insights and scathing humor. Episodes like Chickenlover, City on the Edge of Forever, Spookyfish and Gnomes are all still among my favorite of the show's long and illustrious run. So this is the one instance where you shouldn't listen to Trey Parker and Matt Stone---I'd highly recommend that you buy this reasonably priced second season no matter how critical the creators were of their own work :)",1416355200,,1215,4.818181818181818

It is agreed that this is the worst. Its a mess. It contains the single worst episode the show has ever produced, City on the Edge of Forever, and most of the rest of the episodes are mediocre at best (Summer Sucks, anyone?) It does contain a few classics like Chickenlover, and my personal favorite South Park episode Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus. That said, this season is for fans only.

But, when I opened the packaging,saw that it was factory sealed and looks brand new. Not sure if its really new or used. Unable to tell the difference.

1855980,4,B00008O32J,"Most people, including Trey Parker and Matt Stone themselves, think this is the worst season of South Park....and it is. However, that's like trying to name  Christopher Nolan's worst film even though it's still terrific.

True, the show really started coming together around the third season and the rest is history; South Park is now entering it's fifteenth run of shows and seems to just keep getting better with age. The kind of brilliant social and political satire that has become a staple of the adult cartoon wasn't as apparent in the first two seasons. In this batch of shows, for example, there aren't many celebrity parodies or biting pokes at religion. Instead, we have Mr. Garrison trying to decide which hand puppet he should spend the rest of his life with; Underpants Gnomes are determined that if they steal underwear they will somehow collect a profit, and the Chickenlover certainly has twisted ways of teaching children ""the magic of reading.""

These early shows are more focused on the bizarre characters that inhabit the zany world of South Park and some of the episodes rank among my very favorites. Sure, in recent years you can count on Trey and Matt to give a good roasting of everyone and every current event imaginable but sometimes it's nice as a South Park fan to go back and check out the shows that didn't really have anything to say...they just wanted to tickle your funny bone and believe me, they do.",1304985600,4,1435,4.778225806451613

It's sad that the opening episode, ""Not Without My Anus,"" an April Fool's joke that was sprung on an unsuspecting populace that had been waiting for the conclusion of the cliffhanger ""Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut"" from season 1 for over a month, ended up turning so many people off on the series who didn't come back for years or never came back at all.  ""Chickenlover,"" ""Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,"" ""Spookyfish,"" ""Prehistoric Ice Man,"" and ""The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka"" are all absolute comedy gold.  The only weak episodes in this season were ""Merry Christmas, Charlie Manson!"" and the overrated ""Gnomes.""",1272412800,,749,4.968

Every time I go back and re-watch South Park from beginning to end, I learn to enjoy Season Two even more. While some people revere Season Five as their break away, Season Two offers the excellent development of the most beloved South Park characters and themes. It introduces more mystery stories, features the first full Terrance and Phillip episode, shows South Park's ability to satirize current events and fads, and displays amazing creativity with a Three episode intertwined story.

I implore you to purchase this DVD new, or watch the full episodes for free online at the official South Park website [...]. However to get the full experience you have to buy the DVD, one of the greatest reasons to own the DVDs is the hilarious introductions by creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone.

1855995,5,B00008O32J,"...maybe its my fav bc it was when i first starting watching it in like 3rd grade.  the first episode i ever was the chicken effer episode and i remember thinking it was the most hilarious thing id ever seen.  but all the other episodes just add to the hilarity of this season...the most memorable one i think is the drugs are bad episode with mr mackey, who hasn't seen that one.  some of my other favs are the divorce one with fat abbot from the hood, i think that was the funniest thing ive ever seen.  the chickenpox, the planterium episode, cow days, the list goes on and on,  if i could only own one season it would be this one.  I just wish the newer seasons were as funny as these but they're just not.  theyve lost the immaturity and they're just trying to shock people now, which is good too, but the old episodes used to do both...it was more childish and immature i guess, which is my kind of humor.  u can get it used for a really good price so pick it up if you haven't already its really good...its one of the funniest shows ever made.  one more thing i almost forgot to mention were the opening sequences b4 the show starts...the bakin bacon thing...omg just hilarious and the bacon casserole looked delicious but id probably die from a heart attack after one bite.  check this dvd out ull love it!",1255564800,,1314,4.283400809716599

1855997,4,B00008O32J,"Television programs usually have an unwritten code that making fun of some things is just plain wrong and telling lies or demeaning celebrities can get you sued... except when it comes to South Park.

For some reason South Park seems to have been granted immunity from criticism by the masses. It is the only show that appears to be able to do anything it wants, however it wants, whenever it wants, and gets away with it scott free. Sure the hotlines to the television watchdogs might be ringing off the hooks when it really gets offensive but quite frankly nobody is answering because it seems that the world just likes a good old demented outlet now and again and the safest venue appears to be the adult cartoon South Park.

The concept is simple. Combine dumbeddown 2D animation with unique characters with quite interesting and deep personalities with complex backgrounds combined with outrageous stories, horrific sequences, extremely black humour, absolute stupidity, relationships gone wrong, real life famous personalities, layers of offensive material so nobody gets away unscathed, all within the framework of a small backward town that is on the tip of exploding into mayhem for one reason or another. It is all outrageous stuff... but bravo to the makers because its sooooo very funny.

Matt Stone and Tray Parker just let their minds loose every episode to come up some of the craziest television that is so original in concept that nothing out there can compete. At the same time you either love or it or hate it. There is no middle ground. You either find it 1 star extremely obnoxious or 5 stars ridiculously funny.

The downside to Season 2 is that the start is nothing like Season 1 and almost runs into to becoming simply not-funny for the first few episodes. It does get better and so some misses lets the season down but the makers pick up the pace and correct it for some of the funniest South Park to date. While season one was quite limited to only 13 episodes, season 2 has 18! Episodes include Philip and Terrence, Cartman's mom, chickens, circumcision, conjoined fetuses, frogs, alternative dimensions, summer holidays, Chef's chocolates, diseases, planetarium, divorce, cows, live aid, killer fish, Charlie Manson, gnomes and prehistoric icemen.",1235952000,,2275,4.963254593175853

1856005,5,B00008O32J,"The adventures of South Park, Colorado's intelligent and potty-mouthed third-graders continue in this 18-episode second season collection.  Season one ended with a cliffhanger that promised to reveal the identity of Cartman's father.  The air date for the second season was on April Fool's Day, so instead of the conclusion to the cliffhanger, viewers were treated to a special episode of ""Terrance and Phillip"".  In season two the viewers meet the school guidance counselor, Mr. Mackey, for the first time (o'kay), meet the school nurse for the first time, relive some favorite SOUTH PARK moments from the perspective of the kids, are offered to taste of Chef's salty chocolate balls, see the kids suffer through chickenpox, spend a Christmas with Charles Manson, visit the underground lair of the underpants gnomes, and see a man come to life who was frozen in ice since 1996.  The episodes on the season are as follows.

""Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus""--The Canadian farting friends, Terrance and Phillip, rescue Terrance's daughter Sally from the Middle East while Saddam Hussein uses the rescue as an attempt to take over Canada.

""Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut""--The boys wait for Mephisto to recover from his gunshot wound so that Cartman can find out who his father is.  Meanwhile, South Park is hit with a blizzard and many of the town's citizens resort to cannibalism to stay alive.

""Chickenlover""--Someone is going around South Park raping chickens.  Officer Barbrady is on the case, but is put on probation after he announces he can't read.  The boys are deputized to help solve the case and Cartman becomes a criminal's worst nightmare.

""Ike's Wee Wee""--Ike's going to be circumcised.  Kyle thinks it means his parents and rabbi are going to cut off Ike's Wee Wee so he sends him on a train to protect them.  Meanwhile, the school guidance counselor, Mr. Mackey is fired and falls into a life of drugs and alcohol.

""Conjoined Fetus Lady""--Meet the school nurse, she has a dead fetus attached to her forehead.  Also, the boys travel to China and compete in the World Championship Dodgeball Game.

""The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka""--After the boys believe that Stan's uncle Ned and his friend Jimbo lied to them about their exploits in Vietnam, the boys trick Ned and Jimbo. Meanwhile, ""Jesus and Pals"" attempts to compete with the ratings juggernaut of Ned and Jimbo's cable access show.

""Flashbacks""--the schoolbus almost drives off a cliff.  While waiting to be rescued, the boys relive some of their favorite adventures so far, complete with a sitcom laugh track.

""Summer Sucks""--School's out and the boys are bored.  They're looking forward to the 4th of July until they're informed they can no longer buy fireworks.  The mayor tries to fix things by burning the world's largest snake.  Meanwhile Ned and Jimbo travel to Mexico to get some real fireworks for the kids, Mr. Hat leaves Mr. Garrison, and Cartman has to take swimming lessons.

""Chef's Salty Chocolate Balls""--Robert Redford brings a new film festival to South Park turning the quaint mountain community into a mini-Los Angeles. The strain causes the sewer systems of the town to overload and bring Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo to the brink of death. Meanwhile, Chef tries to earn some extra money by selling his tasty confectionaries.  Look for the obvious allusions to E.T. and PHANTOM OF THE OPERA.

""Chickenpox""--the boys' parents have them all spend the night at Kenny's in an attempt to give them the chickenpox.  Kyle's mother arranges for Kyle's Dad to go on fishing trip with his old friend, Kenny's Dad.

""Roger Ebert Should Lay Off the Fatty Foods""--in this takeoff of a Star Trek episode, the children visit the planetarium and are strangely drawn to keep returning.  Cartman skips out on the trip and tries to gain some national fame by auditioning for a Cheesy Poofs commercial.

""Clubhouses""--Wendy promises Stan to play Truth or Dare with him if he invites her to his clubhouse. Stan doesn't have a clubhouse and has to build one.  Wendy's friend Bebe thinks Kyle is hot and want to make out with him in Stan's clubhouse.  Cartman gets angry at Stan and Kyle and builds his own clubhouse with Kenny.  Also, Stan's parents get divorced.

""Cow Days""--At South Park's annual Cow Days the boys are determined to win some Terrance and Phillip dolls from a crooked vendor.  When Cartman receives a blow to the head, he thinks he is a Vietamese prostitute named Ming Li and the boys use him to enter a bull-riding contest in an attempt to win $5,000.

""Chef Aid""--Chef sues a music company to get credit for a popular song he wrote entitled ""Stinky Britches"". He looses his case and is left broke by the record company. He starts whoring himself to all the women of South Park in an attempt to raise some money. Meanwhile, the boys seek out some of Chef's famous friends from the music business and hold a music benefit concert.

""Spookyfish""--A Halloween episode.  Aunt Flow makes her monthly visit to Stan's Mom Sharon and gives him a pet goldfish.  Stan believes the fish is demonic, but no one believes him until dead bodies start showing up in his room.  When the boys befriend an ""evil"" Cartman from another universe they discover that a portal to another dimension has been opened and they have to find a way to close it.

""Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!""--the boys travel to Cartman's Grandparent's house to spend the night and eat a holiday dinner.  Cartman's Uncle Howard breaks out of prison and brings Charlie Manson with him.

""Gnomes""--Mr. Garrison's is being evaluated by the school board and assigns Kyle, Stan, Kenny, and Cartman are assigned to write a report with Tweek to present before the school board.  The boys can't think of anything to write and are saved from failure when Tweek's dad promises to write their paper for them.  He write a brilliant piece of exposition about the evils of big corporations (such as the Harbucks Coffee that is moving next door and threatening to put Tweek Coffee out of business).  Meanwhile, Tweek tries to convince everyone that there are gnomes that steal his underwear.

""Prehistoric Ice Man""--Kyle and Stan uncover a frozen man in an ice cave.  Dr. Mephisto thaws the man out and he comes out of hibernation.  It turns out he's a missing hiker who got lost in 1996.  The man seem unable of coping with how much the world has changed in three years and wants to go back to his own time, but the government wants to keep him as a permanent display.

The first twelve episodes in the series are prefaced by an introduction with Matt Parker and Trey Stone.  The Terrance and Phillip episode is as close to a real introduction these two ever give and they explain the why they did things at the start of season two that they did (April Fools!). The next few episodes have Matt and Trey playing at a retirement home and the rest of the introductions feature them hosting their own cooking show, ""Makin' Bacon with Macon."" Out of all the ""intros"" they have done for the shows, these are the most disturbing I have seen: the mascot of the show is a pig named Macon that they keep feeding bacon to over and over and over.

The special features with this season include a musical video of ""Chocolate Salty Balls"" and a fifty-minute long behind-the-scenes documentary about the show entitled ""Going Down to South Park"". In ""Going Down to South Park"" Matt and Trey actually let their guard down a little and reveal some real information about their start and the show. However, less than half of what they say is true and the rest is an act as they perform for the camera.

So, let's go on down to South Park and meet some friends of mine.",1204502400,,7719,4.782051282051282
1856006,4,B00008O32J,"I am a huge South Park fan, and this was the first full season I have ever bought. watching it on TV, I have never seen an episode I haven't loved, every single one has been funny, crude, and smart to the extreme, but after watching the first five minutes of the opening episode, a full length Terence and Phillip episode, I found myself drifting off to sleep without so much as a chuckle. Same with the next two episodes, Cartmans Mom is Still a Dirty **** and Chicken Lover. The jokes were bad, the political satire was cheesy, and did I mention the jokes were bad?

Plus, another downside for this set, at least for the first two DVD's is that there is a five minute skit before every episode with the creators either yelling at old people in a nursing home or feeding a pig bacon. Not cool, because i CAN'T SKIP THE STUPID THINGS! If you press the skip button, it goes all the way to the next episode.

Other than that though, this set is a definite winner. The rest of the episodes are very well done with that smart crude political and social satire that we've come to love, making fun of everything from big business to Nebraskans (something I found really funny because I'm from Nebraska myself). They pull no punches in South Park, nothing is safe from the brilliant minds of these two dorks (their names i can't remember off the top of my head). So go ahead, kill Kenny, join a cow cult, and play with a Christmas poop. if you don't find this show offensive, your dead, but no matter what I guarantee you it is sure to have you rolling on the floor in laughter.

1856007,4,B00008O32J,"This is still a sophomoric show with more than its share of low humor but it still has a strange appeal. The cast of characters consists primarily of a bunch of kids. They go through life getting themselves into sticky situations and generally come out of them better than the adults around them. Though animated, it is not a show for kids. The humor is adult in nature, often gross and always irreverent.

Episode synopses follow:

Terrence and Phillip in Not Without My Anus - Last season left off with a cliffhanger episode in which we had to wait for this season to find out the identity of Cartman's dad. Instead of resolving the cliffhanger, though, they produced a special ""April Fool's"" episode featuring Terrence and Phillip. It's fairly lame.

Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut - The cliffhanger is resolved...after the mad scientist is shot, put on life support, taken to the hospital etc. Cartman is freaking out trying to figure out who his father is...He does not take well to stress.

Chickenlover - The kids get sent out to a bookmobile only to learn that the driver has a fetish for chickens. This is a crime that has little chance of being solved since the only policeman is illiterate.

Ike's Wee-Wee - Stan's brother is going to be circumcised and the kids are invited to the celebration. They don't really understand that it's the first big ripoff in life.

Conjoined Fetus Lady - Kyle hurts his nose playing dodgeball in school and is sent to the nurse. She has a conjoined twin fetus attached to her head. The town decides to raise awareness about this condition while the kids go to the dodgeball world championship in China.

The Mexican Staring Frog of Souther Sri Lanka - The kids are assigned to interview of somebody who was in Vietnam. They interview a psycho uncle and his sidekick who host a hunting show. The show runs opposite a talk show run by Jesus.

Flashback - The kids' schoolbus gets caught on a cliff and the harridan/driver goes for help. The kids do a flashback episode while the driver develops a career as a comedian and falls in love.

Summer Sucks - School lets out and the kids are looking forward to buying fireworks only to find that fireworks have now been banned.

Chef's Salty Chocolate Balls - The Sundance Film Festival gets moved to Southpark. The resulting influx of Hollywood types threatens to destroy the ecosystem of the local sewers.

Chickenpox - Kenny has the chickenpox. When the moms learn that chickenpox is more dangerous for older people, they decide to send the kids to spend the night so they will get the disease young. The kids want vengeance.

Roger Ebert Should Eat Less Fatty Foods - The kids visit a planetarium run by a strange man. It seems that his equipment is some sort of strange mind control device.

Clubhouse - Stan and Kyle build a clubhouse so they will have a place to play truth or dare with the girls. Cartman and Kenny decide to build their own competing club.

Cow Days - The kids investigate the midway at the local Cow Days. They blow their money trying to win Terrence and Phillip dolls. Meanwhile, the local cows form their own cult.

Chef Aid - Chef finds out that a song he wrote 20 years ago has become a hit. When he raises the issue, the record company sues him. He winds up owing 2 million in legal fees and the kids try to raise money to help.

Spookyfish - It's a Halloween special and everything is weird.  Stanley's mother is having a monthly bout of PMS and strange things are happening. These include Cartman being nice and a haunted goldfish. Death and mayhem are the order of the day.

Merry Christmas Charlie Manson - The kids go to visit Cartman's grandparents and learn that Eric's traits are genetic. While there, his uncle breaks out of prison and brings his friend, Charles Manson with him.

Gnomes - The kids get assigned to write a report on current events in Southpark. One of the parents is fighting a corporate takeover of his business and writes the report for them. It's a difficult choice over whether to submit the prewritten report or work on one about little gnomes stealing underwear late at night.

Prehistoric Ice Man - While hunting for crocodiles in the mountains of Colorado, the kids find a body frozen in the ice. Theories abound as to whether the body is prehistoric or not even though it is dated to 1996.",1187481600,2,4346,4.590439276485788

It was enough of this that it doesn't appear intended to be funny. But this episode will take you back to the time before all that when it was fun. I don't mind what they're doing with the show, but they're taking a turn for the worse, to something violently disturbing, or at least if any cartoon is going to disturb people, it's South Park. Watching a dog commit suicide with a gun with every bloody detail, watching Chef die after becoming a child molestor. These kinds of episodes are difficult to laugh at.

1856026,5,B00008O32J,"The second season opens with Matt and Trey explaining why they ran ""Terrance and Phillip in Not without my Anus"" on April Fools day rather then the conclusion to the episode about who is Cartman's father.

The second disk seemed to have some editing problems.  The sound for Matt and Trey's opening was low and yet the shows had a normal sound level.  Be careful or you will get blasted.

Overall I liked all episodes.

Terrance and Phillip in not without my Anus:  Scot the Canadian Prosecutor tries to frame Terrance for murder in order to eliminate the duo.  He fails and later gets a call from Saddam who offers to help get rid of them.  Terrance and Phillip will head to Iraq to rescue Terrance's illegitimate daughter (Celine Dion is the mother) and Saddam will move to Canada.  Saddam quickly takes over Canada and its up to Terrance and Phillip to save Canada.

Carman's Mom is still a dirty slut:  Matt and Trey open this episode.  They are helping the elderly in a rest home.  Mephesto is shot before he can reveal the father of Cartman.  They rush him to the Hospital and people freak out about the killer.  America's most wanted appears and offers to help.  The boys and Chef are snowbound in the hospital and offer to help out.  The people at the America's Most Wanted Studios are snowbound as well and have to take extreme measures to stay alive!  In the end we learn the identity of  Cartman's father.

Chickenlover:  Matt and Trey open this one as well.  We get a Cops type episode involving Barbrady.  Somebody is having sex with chickens and we soon learn Barbrady can't read.  He has to leave the force and South Park falls into anarchy.  The mayor even comments that he actually kept the peace in town.  The boys offer to help out and Cartman takes over patrolling the streets teaching people to ""respect my auhoratay!""

Ike's Wee Wee: Matt and Trey open this one as well.  Mr. Mackey gives a substance abuse talk to class.  He uses Marijuana as an example and it disappears.  He gets fired for being an idiot.  Soon his world falls apart and starts drinking and taking drugs.  Kyle invites the boys over to Ike's brisk.  To his horror he quickly learns what that means and decides he has to save Ike's ""fireman""  After saving him, Kyle learns a secret about Ike.

Conjoined fetus lady:  Matt and Trey open this one as well.  The boys have PE with Chef.  The game of the day?  Dodge ball.  The boys explain it to Pip and he turns out to be a natural.  During the game Kyle gets hurt and has to see the nurse.  The rumor is the fact that kids never return.  Kyle learns she has a disease called ""conjoined twin dyslexia"" which means she has a dead fetus attached to her head.  The town decides to have an awareness week for her.  While this goes on the boys go on to be national champions of dodge ball and head off by bus to China for the world games.

The Mexican staring frog of southern Sri Lanka:  Matt and Trey open this one as well.  The boys have to write a paper about Viet Nam.  They go talk to Jimbo and Ned who tell them tails of Merry-go-rounds, log rides and single handedly destroying the Viet Cong Army.  Mr. Garrison sends the class to detention as a result.  The boys then decide to make Ned and Jimbo look like idiots by sending them footage of the Mexican staring frog.  A side story involves the falling ratings of Jesus and Pals.  Jimbo and Ned's hunting show is killing the show.

City on the edge of forever:  Matt and Trey open with a cooking show involving bacon.  This was a funny episode involving flashbacks with twists.  It starts when the bus gets into an accident.  Mrs. Crabtree goes to get help and leaves the children on the bus which is hanging on the edge of a cliff.  I liked the Star Trek reference.  Mrs. Crabtree finds love and her dream; stand up comedy.  While the kids are missing, the parents hold ""we are the world"" type concert to try and get the kids to come back from having run away.

Summer Sucks:  Matt and Trey open again.  School closes for the summer and Mr. Hat goes missing.  Mr. Garrison flips out.  The 4th of July celebration gets a setback as fireworks are outlawed.

Cartman takes swimming lessons and learns about the 1st graders do in the pool!

Chef's Salty Chocolate Balls:  Matt and Trey open again and this time the sound is ok.  Robert Redford decides to move the Sundance Film Festival to South Park!  Chef sets up a booth to sell fudge cookies!  ""Life getting you down?, fudge it""  The resulting health food eating crowds put a great strain on the sewer system which makes everybody's favorite talking poo sick.  Kyle tries to appeal to the crowds to save his friends life.

Chickenpox:  Matt and Trey open again and sound is ok.  Shelly catches Chickenpox and the parents decide to intientially get their children infected since you have a harder time if you catch Chickenpox when you are older.  The boys take revenge by having a streetwalker named ""Old Freda"" help them give their parents Herpes.  Kenny's dad and Kyle's dad were once friends when they were kids.  Kyle's mom gets them take an ill-fated fishing trip.

Roger Ebert should lay off fatty foods:  Matt and Trey open again.  Sound is ok.  In a tribute to the old Star Trek episode ""Dagger of the mind,"" the boys go to the planetarium for a field trip and get programmed to love the planetarium.  Cartman enters and wins a contest to be the Cheesy Poof jingle singer.

Clubhouses: Matt and Trey open again.  Sound is ok.  Bebe starts making her move on Kyle.  Stan and Kyle have a race to build a clubhouse so they can play truth or dare.  Stan first has to build it and then he has to figure out how to play  truth or dare.  During this time, Stan's parents split.  Stan's mom hooks up with Roy and Stan's dad gets an earring and a fast car.  Maybe the magic of clubhouses will come through.  There is a funny bit involving the old Cosby show.

Cow Days:  A couple wins a game show.  Their prize?  A trip to South Park for the celebration of Cow Days.  The boys try and win a game by throwing a ball through Jennifer Love-Hewlett's mouth.  The game is rigged so the boys need more money.  They get Cartman to ride a bull.  In the middle of training, he gets hurt and thinks he is a Vietnamese prostitute.  During this time the cows discover a monument of a cow that kind of looks like Buda with a clock in his stomach.  They decide to form a cult.  In the end, the boys declare shenanigans on the carnival people.

Chef Aid:  Chef learns that a record company stole a song called ""stinky bridges"" which he wrote 20 years ago.  He asks for credit and gets sued by the record company.  Kyle gets his dad to defend him and the record company gets Johnny Cochrane.  Things go down hill when the Chewbacca defense is used.  The boys decide to try and help him by setting up chef aid.  While this goes on somebody is attacking Mr. Twig.

SpookyFish:  This episode involves scary vision!  The boys run into evil Cartman from another dimension.  Stan's Aunt Flow appears and gives Stan a fish that might be killing people.  Stan's mother thinks Stan is killing people and starts hiding bodies and locks Barbrady in the basement.  The boys decide they have to get rid of the goldfish.  Evil Stan and Kyle appear to claim their Cartman.

Merry Christmas Charlie Manson:  The boys head off to see Cartman's grandmother in Nebraska.  As the sign says ""You are now entering Nebraska; Sorry""  They arrive and enter a room full of Cartman's.  During, their stay Cartman's Uncle Howard escapes from Prison with his friend Charles Mansion.

After getting drinking coffee for the first time, tweak tells them a story about underpants gnomes that steal underpants.  They wait up and find out that they wasted time instead of writing the paper.  Tweaks father saves the day writing a paper about Corporations destroying small businesses.  The paper ends up starting a cause against corporate take overs.

Special Features:

Chef ""Chocolate Salty Balls"" Music Video:  Worth a watch!

""Goin' Down to South Park"" Documentary:  A look into the internal workings of making South Park.  I wished I had their office!  Worth a watch as well!",1149120000,22,8947,4.482242990654205
1856027,5,B00008O32J,"Although season one was excellent, season two is where South Park really starts to hit its stride, starting with the April Fool's season premiere in which we were supposed to find out Cartman's parentage and sit through a Terrance and Phillip episode instead. What is really hilarious about this April Fool's joke are the irate callers to the show who use a great deal of colorful language to voice their dismay. In ""Chicken Lover"", the town lawman, Officer Barbrady, is discovered to be illiterate and must return to elementary school...a task he seems to like just a little too much. Cartman offers to take up the slack of patrolling while Barbrady is in school, and we are treated to a ""Cops"" style interview of Cartman while he is patrolling on his bigwheel, nightstick and sunglasses in tow. In ""Summer Sucks"", a law has been passed outlawing all fireworks except snakes. Thus, the town builds a giant incendiary snake for the 4th of July. When it is ignited it gets out of control and manages to kill animated guest star ""Dr. Katz"" as he is psychoanalyzing Mr. Garrison. This season also contains two of my favorite episodes of all times, ""Gnomes"" and ""Ike's Wee Wee"". In ""Ike's Wee Wee"" Kyle misunderstands what a circumcision is, and to save his brother from this horrible fate, puts Ike on a train to Nebraska until his parents are sane again and it is safe for Ike to return. When everything is cleared up, Ike's parents arrive at the station in Nebraska and look for Ike, and find him in a local bar being used as a table post. Also during this episode, Principal Victoria probably has the quote of the season whe she observes ""There is a time and place for everything...and it's called college!"" in reference to some marijuana that has been stolen during a third grade lecture on drug use. We also learn that apparently college kids have a unique and not entirely wholesome use for the show ""Teletubbies"".

In ""Gnomes"" the boys have to write a paper on business and are helped by underwear gnomes that have been stealing the underwear of their over-caffeinated friend Tweek. The gnomes are stealing underwear as part of their 3 step business plan:

1. Steal underwear.

2. They don't know yet.

3. Make lots of money.

It's odd how this looks like the business plan of several people I know, and it is also odd how step two is always the hard part.

I really enjoyed this season of South Park, and I highly recommend it's smart brand of humor.

P.S. I am reviewing season two here because I have the room to go into details. However, if you already know you like the entire series, seasons 1-5 are now selling as a package set on Amazon for about $20 less than what you would pay if you bought each of the first five seasons individually.",1139616000,,2750,4.588594704684318

1856032,5,B00008O32J,"I remember one day I was in school and one of the kids had a South Park hat on with the 4 kids at the bus stop and for some reason everybody was like ""wow, neato!"" and ""I gotta get me one!"". Of course no one figured out where he got it since our stores here suck. The second season has some classic episodes and they really start their biting satire here with some great results.

Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus: Instead of the part 2 cliffhanger about Cartman's father's identity, we got a full half hour of Terrance and Phillip since it aired on April Fool's Day. Meh. 5/10

Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty S***: Just before the identity of Cartman's father is revealed, Mephisto is shot. America's Most Wanted is filming a special but is snowed in and the boys become honorary doctors at the hospital. 9/10

Ike's Wee Wee: Kyle's brother Ike is going to get circumsized and the kids think his parents are nuts. Meanwhile Mr Mackey starts doing drugs, and drugs are bad mmkay? 8/10

Chickenlover: It's actually called Chicken****er in some places. It's about Officer Barbrady's illiteracy as the town tries to solve who keeps ****ing chickens. One of their most outrageous episodes. 7.5/10

Conjoined Fetus Lady: 2 in a row? Wow. The kids are entered in a dodgeball tournament where they have to face the deadly Chinese team and the team goes too far with Conjoined Team Myslexia week. 7.5/10

The Mexican Staring Frog of Sri Lanka: The boys are assigned an assignment about the Vietnam War but are lied to(well, supposedly) by Uncle Jimbo so the boys pull a prank on him by filming the dangerous titular frog only it's fake. 8/10

Flashbacks: The boys are trapped in a schoolbus and they reminisce about past episodes only this time there's lots of ice cream. Also, Mrs Crabtree becomes an unlikely comedian. 8/10

Summer Sucks: It's the summer which means no snow and Colorado banned fireworks so they decide to light a huge smoke snake. Cartman also takes up swimming but finds the first graders are rather nasty. Meh. 6/10

Chef's Salty Chocolate Balls: Hilarious puns regarding Chef's new pastry dish when tourists come to South Park after Robert Redford opens a film festival. The return of Mr Hankey and a funny spoof of the Sorceror's Apprentice. 8/10

Chickenpox: The mothers of the boys plot to give the boys chickenpox by spending time with Kenny since it's rather hazardous for them when they're older. Kenny's father and Kyle's father try to reunite after parting ways. 8/10

Roger Ebert Should Lay Off the Fatty Foods: In a spoof of Dagger of the Mind episode of Star Trek, the boys find something wrong with the planetarium and Cartman wants to be a star by appearing in a Cheesy Poofs commercial. 9/10

Clubhouses: Stan's parents get briefly divorced as the boys hurry to build a treehouse so they can play truth or dare with Wendy and Bebe, who has the hots for Kyle. 7.5/10

Cow Days: A couple wins a vacation to South Park's Cow Days annual festival only to be rather weirded out. The boys try to win cheap Terrance and Phillip dolls at a rigged carnival game so they enter Cartman in a bull-riding contest, but acts like a vietnamese prostitute. 8/10

Chef Aid: Chef finds out that an Alanis Morissette song is playing even though he wrote it years before. He sues but loses and has to pay 2 million so the boys try to raise money but end up attracting Elton John, Joe Strummer, Ozzy and others. 8/10

Spooky-Fish: The Halloween episode finds Stan's new goldfish killing people but no one'll believe him and the boys find out there exists 2 Cartmans. Displayed in Spooky Vision, meaning there's 4 small pictures of Barbra Streisand on the tv. 8.5/10

Merry Christmas Charlie Manson: The boys visit Cartman's relatives in Nebraska but end up housing escaped convict Charles Manson, who ends up being reformed by christmas specials. 7.5/10

Gnomes: The introduction of not-really-popular character Tweek as the boys are unknowingly used as pawns to take down the new Harbucks coffee shop. Tweek is also ranting about tiny gnomes that steal underpants. 9/10

Prehistoric Ice Man: Due to an accident, Kyle and Stan find a cave housing a man in ice all the way from the year 1996. The town doesn't want him leaving in the new age(couple years later) while Kyle and Stan fight over the right to name the guy since Kyle found the cave but Stan found the guy. 8/10

There's a lot of classic moments over the season and as usual some pretty outlandish deaths for Kenny although some are kinda tame(he dies of chickenpox in one, and gets trampled twice while others are pretty nasty). There still isn't some classic characters yet like Timmy or Butters but it's still a good season.",1117324800,6,4706,4.675544794188862
1856033,5,B00008O32J,"This set includes the infamous April Fools joke where they showed a Terrance and Philip special instead of the payoff for the season one cliffhanger.  It's funnier than I first thought when I saw it on that fatefull April first, and that is coming from a Canadian!  Furthermore, my favorite episode of all time, The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Shri Lanka, is in this set.  For everyone who hated playing dodge ball in school, who is sick of film festivals that sold out years ago, who just knew that their pet fish was a serial killer, this is the set for you.",1108080000,,565,4.466019417475728
1856034,4,B00008O32J,"I want to complain that Trey Parker & Matt Stone go too far on ""South Park: The Complete Second Season,"" only (a) their obvious aim in life is to ""go too far"" and (b) they cross the threshold for me on their introductions to the episodes on Disc 2 and not in any of the actual episodes (although clearly there are many who will disagree on both of those points).  It has long ago been established that Matt & Trey are not as funny as themselves as any given episode of ""South Park.""  In their introductions on the first disc they are back haranguing the people in that retirement home, but on the second disc we are treated to a faux infomercial for ""Making Bacon with Macon,"" where they keep feeding bacon to a pig.  I do not know why pig cannibalism bothers me when I thought nothing of Parker's musical ""Cannibal!"" but then consistency is the hobgoblin of something or other.  Therefore, by way of protesting persistent feeding of bacon to a big, I have rounded down and not up in rating this DVD set (take THAT, Matt & Trey).

Considering these eighteen episodes without the introductory bits, which disappear on the third disc to be replaced by a documentary on ""The Making of South Park,"" there are at least a half-dozen classic episode:

(14) ""Terrance & Phillip in 'Not Without My Anus'"" is infamous because instead of finding out who is Cartman's father, as an April Fool's Joke we get a complete Terrance & Phillip episode.  The  best part of this one is the attempt to stop Saddam Hussein from taking over Canada. (3.5 Cheezy Poofs)

(15) ""Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut"" prolongs answering the question about who is Cartman's dad by a pair of running gags,  the narrator reviewing possible suspects for absolutely every question posed in the and Liane Cartman's confusion over the differences between ""abortion"" and ""adoption.""  While Eric might disagree the answer to the big question in this one is pretty sweet: who saw it coming? (5 Cheezy Poofs)

(16) ""Ike's Wee Wee"" has two main plotlines, the better of which is Kyle and the boys freaking out when they discover what is going to happen to Ike's ""fireman"" during a Bris.  Then there is Mr. Mackey being fired (m'kay) when the sample of mary-j-uana he passed around the boy's class as part of a drug & alcohol prevention lecture (they're bad) disappears.  (4 Cheezy Poofs)

(17) ""Chickenlover"" proves that reading is more FUN-damental than we thought.  Obviously the big parody here is of ""COPS"" as Cartman demands everyone respect his ""authoritah.""  (4.5 Cheezy Poofs)

(18) ""Conjoined Fetus Lady"" is another one where the two plotlines go their separate ways.  The satire of people helping those who do not want help is good enough, but the whole dodgeball competition bit is even better as the boys finally learn why it is okay to hate foreigners when it is not okay to hate Americans of different races or ethnicity. (5.0 Cheezy Poofs)

(19) ""The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka"" somehow gets from Uncle Jimbo telling the boys about the good life in Vietnam during the war to Jesus cursing.  Telling the truth is apparently an important thing.  (4.0 Cheezy Poofs)

(20) ""City on the Edge of Forever"" (a.k.a. ""Flashbacks"") is a brilliant twist on a television clip show.  Trapped in their school bus on the edge of a cliff, the boys recall previous ""sticky situations,"" only all of the familiar scenes now include ice cream.  Meanwhile, Ms. Crabtree becomes the hottest comedienne around and the parents record a song to have their ""runaway"" children come home.  (5.0 Cheezy Poofs)

(21) ""Summer Sucks"" is a kitchen sink episode that combines Mr. Hat's disappearance with Cartman taking swimming lessons and the biggest fireworks snake in the world.  A guest appearance by Dr. Katz stands out in this one.  (3.5 Cheezy Poofs)

(22) ""Chef's Salty Chocolate Balls"" has South Park becoming the site of an Independent Film Festival and we learn that Chef's culinary creation does wonders for Mr. Hankey.  The music video in the special features is better than the episode, although you have to appreciate the idea of Mr. Hankey as a metaphor for modern American cinema.  (4 Cheezy Poofs)

(23) ""Chickenpox"" has the parents conspiring to have their boys get the disease while they are young.  Kyle learns of the conspiracy and the boys come up with a way of teaching their parents a lesson.  Amazing what they will laugh at on this show, dude.  (4 Cheezy Poofs)

(24) ""Roger Ebert Should Lay Off the Fatty Foods"" is the one where the kids go to the plane-arium and come under the mind control of Dr. Adams.  If you need Matt and Trey's introduction to recognize this episode is based on the ""Dagger of the Mind"" episode of the original ""Star Trek"" series, you need to bone up on popular culture.  (4 Cheezy Poofs)

(25) ""Clubhouses"" is all about divorce and playing ""Truth or Dare,"" which are more closely related than you would think.  This one has one of my favorite moments in the series, when Stan's mom agrees that, yes, the divorce is indeed Stan's fault (""Dude, you're not supposed to tell me that!"" he complains).  (4.5 Cheezy Poofs)

(26) ""Cow Days"" introduces us to not only South Park's big summer festival, during the brief period of summer, but the great principle of calling ""Shennanigans.""  Anything involving the cows of South Park is usually good, even this tragic tale, especially if Cartman thinks he is a Vietnamese prostitute named Ming Li.  (5 Cheezy Poofs)

(27) ""Chef Aid"" has the boys coming to the aid of Chef when he is sued by a record company for noticing that Alanis Morresette had recorded one of his songs without giving him credit.  Truth is on Chef's side, but Johnny Cochran and the famous ""Wookie Defense"" are on the other.  Fortunately a lot of big stars from Elton John to Meatloaf to Ozzy Osbourne lend their support and their voices to this episode.  (5 Cheezy Poofs)

(28) ""Spooky Fish"" is the gift that Stan gets from Aunt Flo, his mother's monthly visitor.  The fish tends to kill people, but that is not the strange part of this one.  That would be the ""evil"" Cartman with his goatee, another ""Star Trek"" reference (""Mirror, Mirror"").  Unfortunately this one is done in ""Spooky Vision,"" which means you have to put up with pictures of Barbra Streisand in each corner of the screen for the entire episode. (4.5 Cheezy Poofs)

(29) ""Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!"" is actually funnier than the first season ""South Park"" Christmas episode.  How can it now be since it combines Charles Manson with the key elements of ""A Charlie Brown Christmas""?  This one is sick enough to be really funny.  (5 Cheezy Poofs)

(30) ""Gnomes"" is about the attempt of Tweek Bros., the gourmet coffee house in South Park, to fend off the competition of the corporate giant, Harbucks Coffee.  Fortunately the boys are able to get the help of these gnomes who have been stealing underwear, although it is not exactly the type of help you would expect.  (4 Cheezy Poofs)

(31) ""Prehistoric Ice Man"" has the boys discovering a cave man frozen in a block of ice.  Dr. Mephisto thaws out the cave man and discovers he has been frozen for (gasp!) 32 months.  Can a primitive human being from 1996 understand the world of today?  Good question.  Meanwhile, Stan and Kyle fight over whether the cave man should be called Gorak or Steve, but work together in the end to send the cave man to a place where he can be happy.  (4.5 Cheezy Poofs)

The key defining element of the best episodes is that they are usually strong in terms of parody and/or satire.  Fortunately their use of ""Star Trek"" episodes is moving in the right direction, but when are they going to get to the really good stuff?",1105833600,5,7685,4.693572496263079
1856035,5,B00008O32J,"Season 1 was groundbreaking, but season 2 is when it got really good.  The April Fool's joke was a good way to start it off, even though most people didn't think it was funny.  This set includes such classics as Chickenlover, The Mexican Staring Frog Of Southern Sri Lanka, Chickenpox, and Prehistoric Ice Man, but my favorites are Clubhouses and Gnomes.

1856036,5,B00008O32J,"Season 2 is my personal favorite season of South Park.

Descripctions:

* The INSANEST and TWISTED episodes are Spooky Vision and Flashbacks!!!!

* The FUNNIEST and SENSELESS episodes are Chikenlover and Gnomes!!!!

* The COOLEST episodes are Chef Aid and Clubhouses (my personal favorite episode).

There are another funny stufs like Wendy and Stan watching gay ""indi"" films, MR. Garrison diving in poo, MR. Mackey gets ""High"", the boys spend the night with Charles Manson and Cartman dancing the german dance.

Season 1 and 2 are the best and classic seasons, the others were great but not THAT special and classic as the first two seasons.

Here is the BEST of each season:

* Season 1- Cartman's Anal Probe, Big Gay Al, Pink Eye and Cartman's Mom is a Slut.

* Season 2- Chikenlover, Chef Aid, Spooky Vision and Gnomes.

* Season 3- Starvin Marvin in Space, World Wide Concert and Chinpoko Mon.

* Season 4- This is one of the VERY BEST seasons of South Park.

* Season 5- Scott Tenorman, Towelie, Cripple Fight and Osama Bin Laden.

* Season 6- This is one of the VERY BEST seasons of South Park.

* Season 7- Is GREAT but not THAT cool except for Cancelled and Cristian Rock Hard.

* Season 8- The best episodes until now are Fun with Weapons and Passion of the Jew but is still GOOD.

I think its mainly due to the fact that the comic value of the first episode with terrance and phillip went down as the episode progressed...c'mon..the fart jokes got kinda old. You can only fart so much in a single episode and keep it funny. This season set however does contain some of the best classics ever such as when Cartman becomes the law enforcer with ""authoritah"", when spookyfish kills people and when Cartman tries out for the cheezy poof commercials.

1856049,5,B00008O32J,"OK I've seen most of the episodes and they are all funny.  But I saw a reveiw that made me mad.  This lady said to ban South Park because of what her son saw.  First of all I don't beleive the story, because I have a friend and sevarel cousins who are mentally challegenged.  Noone says ""My retarded son.""  Come on.  Even if this IS true, seriously, if you have a mentally chagllegened child, you need to ha a V-Chip in your TV, or at LEAST look sat the ratings.  It's obvious that it is rated TV-MA.  What did you expect?  A show about flowewrs and lambs?  Where were you when he was watching this?  That's just bad parenting through and through.  Then he got beat up for saying a cuss word he saw on South Park?  And why was he playing in the park all alone?  You or a teacher or gudrian were WHERE when this happens?  You can't ban everything your don't like.  Heck, if I could do that Atheists and Liberals would all be banned from socitie!  So, lady, don't tell it to us, OK?  Who's with me on this?  I mean, it just sounds like terriable parenting to me!  By the way, I have seen MOST of the episodes on here.  If your not offended easyily, by cussing or politically incorrectness, then this might be ashow for you.  But it is an accuired tatse.",1096934400,2,1251,4.168067226890757

1856051,5,B00008O32J,I love this show. Not more than god of course. I like the episodes. one of the best is chickenlover. I also like the one where stan gets the killer fish.

1856052,5,B00008O32J,"After ending the first season of South Park with the cliffhanger of who is Cartman's father, show creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone decided to play an April Fool's prank (the second season's premiere just so happaned to be on April Fool's Day) by airing an all Terrance & Philip (two fart loving TV characters who the kids watch) episode called ""Not Without My Anus"".  Many fans were angered by this, which only showed how dedicated South Park's fans are.  After that the kids go through more misadventures including a christmas time meeting with Charles Manson, and the infamous Chef Aid episode where Chef is thrown in jail and the kids raise money to help him out by throwing a music festival (that episode includes special guest voices by Ozzy Osbourne, Elton John, Ike Turner, Rancid, and Primus among others).  The only thing disappointing about this DVD set are the lame extras.  The intros from Parker and Stone are directly taken from the single disc releases of South Park episodes which included four episodes per disc.

1856056,5,B00008O32J,"Well, first off let me say that the second season of South Park was a major improvement from the first. But, the second season DVD set is a step down, because the entire disc 3 has no introductions whatsoever. The episodes are great, but c'mon those intros were the real reason why people buy these right? Well, basically this season is a look into the world of the relationship between beastiality and literacy, and gay cowboys eating pudding.
I love South Park and I can't wait for season 3, and 4, and 5, and 6, and 7, and so on and so forth.",1062547200,5,545,4.300970873786408
1856067,5,B00008O32J,"South Park...over 100 episodes and they're still going to make more new episodes in October. If you're reading this review you've probably bought Season 1 on DVD and are thinking about getting Season 2. This DVD has 18 classic episodes and contains some of my personal favorites including Chicken Lover(You will respect my authoritah!), Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls, Prehistoric Iceman, and the episode revealing who Cratman's father is. Special Features include subtitles, the documentary""Goin' Down to South Park"", the music video for Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls"", and the original Unaired Pilot. The Unaired Pilot is the original first episode but 28 minutes long. That original episode was made out of constucion paper by Eric Stough, Trey Parker, and Matt Stone in a room the size of a closet and took three months to make. If you're a fan of the show this is a must have.

1856068,3,B00008O32J,"First let me start off by saying that I reviewed this item before it came out which in most cases is always a bad thing to do for you have no idea hows the product really is until you buy it.
Now that about a month has gone by and I have watched this constantly I am able to simply say this; buy it for the episodes but nothign else. You see unlike the first season edition this second season box set was lacking a certain something. I couldent put my finger on it for weeks, but then it finally dawned on me, it was lacking energy. If any of you have seen the first one then you can fondly remember all of the hilarious short commentaries by the makers of the show prior to each episode. They have the same on this but it changed, the creaters look bored and tired and do not put there best into it. On the third CD of this set I think that they don't have any commentary at all! This may not seem like a big deal but after watching this box set youll have a craving for more South Park, but won't be able to find it. Even the promo's for other Comedy Central shows and the special features feel very lonely and boring with a short biography on the show and a music video. The video quality on these discs is very good, but the sound causes quite a problem, on some of my TV's I have to crank up my volume to the highest to get a good sound.
  So as I said buy this for just the episodes and nothing else. Hopefully the third season will bring back the special features, commentaries, and everything else that I loved about the first season box set. Three and a half stars out of five",1056153600,4,1585,4.044585987261146
1856069,5,B00008O32J,"This season of South Park is absolutely hilarious. It's got some of the best episodes of SP like Flashbacks, The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka, and more. This season also inroduces Tweek which is one of the best characters. This season is a little more money than the first season but it's worth it.

Unfortunately, I am very disappointed with this DVD set.  The sound is very quiet, so you'll have to crank your volume.  The video is TERRIBLE....  how can you screw up transferring computer animation to DVD!?!??!  The outlines of the characters appear speckled in many places and I've seen other complaints about the video being over compressed.  The picture is what I'd expect to see if somebody made a 3rd generation VHS copy of the program... it's that bad and THAT noticible.
I'll not buy another southpark DVD set, not until they start doing a better job with the transfers.",1055721600,6,659,4.848214285714286
1856071,5,B00008O32J,South Park is and always will be the master of comedy. It has always been a great show and still is to this day. I've also purchased Season 1 which wasn't as good as good as season 2 but was still amazing. This season marks moving over from fart jokes and senseless vulgarity. To witty jokes and structureed vulgarity. The episodes are presented in an even better format than last time. Plus everything is up to code. A job well done!

1856072,5,B00008O32J,"Although I think the show has been going downhill lately, the second season is when it hit its prime. The writing is sharp and hilarious. Every episode is a classic one. I almost died laughing when cartman threw a chair at Ned while they were on The Jesus & Pals Show during the episode ""The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka"". I also love Barbara Streisands picture in the corners of the screen during ""Spooky Fish"" It was truly terrifying. Another classic moment is Cartman trying to stick his thumb in various animal's [rear-end's] during ""Prehistoric Ice-Man"" Overall, this is a great season (although not the best one) and any south park fan, or comedy fan who is not easily offended by swearing should buy it.",1053043200,5,724,4.708661417322834

The infamous first episode of season 2, caused quite a stir in the media. Fans rioted against the creators. The network was flooded with calls. But when all is said and done, Terrance and Phillip are the best spin off since the Ropers.
