8042715,5,B0006SSOT0,"Two movies that  both contain zombies but that is where the similarities end.

Dawn of the Dead is your classically epic horror film, delivered with a well balanced cast.  Every horror film fan should watch it at least once.

Shaun of the Dead is still one of my favorite slapstick comedy films worthy of being as memorable as Airplane!, Caddyshack or any one of the National Lampoon Vacation movies.",1418169600,,400,4.753623188405797
8042716,5,B0006SSOT0,"If you like zombie movies and awesome comedy, this is the package for you.  It's a great deal.",1266105600,,94,4.222222222222222
8042717,4,B0006SSOT0,"I really enjoyed both of these movies.  They satisfy different kinds of urges for zombie movies but I certainly consider them both satisfying and being able to get them at a reduced price as a package was nice.  Remakes like ""Dawn of the Dead"" always live in the shadow of the original but this one holds up pretty well and has some of its own flavor.  As I write this, I sit a couple of miles away from the shopping mall where the original was shot so I have a pretty high standard!  ""Shaun..."" is funny but without being too far over the top.  It never completely abandons its roots as a zombie flick though it does have laughs.  That's not an easy balance but it walks it beautifully.",1179360000,,687,4.286821705426356
8042718,5,B0006SSOT0,"This is by far the best Zombie movie of the genre.  Great pacing, amazing effects, and a really good cast.  Number one in my top 5 Zombie Movies of all time.",1143331200,,157,4.032258064516129
8042719,4,B0006SSOT0,"""Dawn of the Dead"" is a violent, bloody zombie movie. If blood and guts is your taste, you'll love this movie. On the other hand ""Shaun of the Dead"" is the funny, witty British version of ""Dawn of the Dead."" I definitely preferred the British version the best!",1125446400,,260,4.4375
8042720,3,B0006SSOT0,"This review is only for the new Dawn of the Dead, haven't seen the parody yet,(Shaun of the Dead) but heard its entertaning. The new dawn of the Dead is fast paced, gorey, entertaining, and enjoyable. But it lost the point of the original. Consumerism gone bad. The original had more of the survivors enjoying the FREE access to the mall's kingdom, and even constructing a home amongst the mall. Everything was at their fingertips, clothing, food, ice rink, tools and weapons, but not once did they over splurge, they jokinly checked pricetags and weighed their food. The point, Zombies taking over, no one really knows what the hell is going on, but yet a group of bikers, non Zombies invade the mall because Steven,(a survivor in the mall) is apprensive to let them join and spoil there good fortunes. Greed, greed, and greed. The bikers break in, spilling the Zombies in and snatching everything up in their hands as possible. Now it is survivors fighting survivors instead of the zombies. Pure greed. like a kid running amuck in a candy store. This film shows how people can act with wants and dreams instead of looking at the whole picture, brilliant. None of this occurs what so ever in the remake, just more action and gore. The original is a classic and will forever make studios try to copy and immulate without even getting close. Buy the original and enjoy what George Romero intended.",1117670400,,1396,4.725409836065574
