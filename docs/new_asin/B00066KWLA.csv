8039253,1,B00066KWLA,"WARNING, this DVD does not play on DVD players from the US.  It is a British made movie and is designed for their players.  When I contacted the company, they said they do not have a copy designed for the US but that they would give me a full refund. I did not send it back  because the shipping amount was double what I paid for it.

They also claim they have a warning about the incompatibility of the disc on US players.  I could not find a warning anywhere.

My 2 year old son watches the little red tractor on YouTube and loves the series.  It's too bad I can't get a copy made for the US.  Now I am stuck with a useless DVD.",1385942400,2,630,3.9444444444444446
