8005482,3,B00011D1A4,"It's all on 1 disc - 10 standards plus a original called Light and Lovely which I seem to remember him recording in the company of 3 other tenor men for Prestige records way back when. Duke Ellington supplys 2 tunes which can now be classifed as standards and also Frank Foster's Shiny Stockings and a well known Jobim Bossa Nova. You get Just Friends, Out Of Nowhere and The Shadow Of Your Smile in sucession. Eddie's in good form. But all this is too familiar for me.",1379635200,,469,4.340909090909091
8005483,5,B00011D1A4," Eddie ""Lockjaw"" Davis Quartet Vol. 1 & 2
Davis is part of the generation of tenor saxophonists with their roots in the swing jazz but who became trendy and inspired by younger greats. This particular combination makes him a very interesting musician, keeping his great tune from his earlier era. ""Lockjaw"" has had several tenures with the Count Basie Orchestra. Here he is accompanied by Ed Thigpen (Oscar Peterson's favorite drummer), Niels Jrgen Steen on piano and Jesper Lundgaard on bass.",1080864000,,493,5.08641975308642
