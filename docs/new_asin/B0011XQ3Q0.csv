8242912,5,B0011XQ3Q0,Alex Filippenko so loves astronomy that his lectures will infect you with his enthusiasm. This set of lectures will blow your mind as you come to understand the origins of everything. It is a great first foray into the subject.,1433721600,2,227,4.7
8242913,5,B0011XQ3Q0,"This course is superb! It contains everything, from rainbows to supernovas, from sunrises to dark energy. (One of the early lectures demonstrates that the sun does not rise nor set - instead, as we know, our planet rotates on its axis). Professor Filippenko is an excellent choice of instructor, combining wit, humor and his endless amount of energy, all as a backdrop to his formidable amount of knowledge on the subject.
I found the course to be challenging, but in a pleasurable way, one that allows the learner to form new concepts (or perhaps, in some cases, to go over ideas and formulas that one may have initially studied in the past). Best of all is the amount of lectures: Ninety-six in all. My attention was riveted from beginning to end during each lecture. It is clear that Professor Filippenko meticulously prepared each class, making abundant use of slides, graphs and other materials to render the lessons even more interesting and understandable.",1426636800,2,963,4.950617283950617
8242914,5,B0011XQ3Q0,"Alex Filippenko is a marvelous lecturer. I remember short talks by him some 10 - 15 years ago. He uses the best images available. Once a year you can get these lectures from The Great Courses people directly at 80% off, which is about $140. But can you wait until June?",1370822400,3,269,4.294117647058823
8242915,5,B0011XQ3Q0,"I have just started watching these lectures and so far so good, the way the Prof. Alex presents them is captivating and it's so much fun to listen and watch him take you through this wonderful journey",1344211200,4,200,4.4324324324324325
