8491282,3,B0062NHPFM,"I taped SHOCK CHAMBER off of the USA Network cable channel over 20 years ago.

This is a Canadian TV movie. Pretty low production values. Obviously shot on videotape.

Back in the 1980s, videotape had a distinctive ""TV look."" Today it's harder to tell whether a project was shot in film or video, but SHOCK CHAMBER has that cheapish video ""quality.""

I taped SHOCK CHAMBER because it sounded like a horror anthology, but it wasn't. More of a crime/suspense anthology. Here are the three tales:

1. A Chunky Femme Fatale and her Tough Guy lover plot to swindle a Naive Rich Boy. Here's how: the Tough Guy sells fake love potions to the Naive Rich Boy, and the Chunky Femme Fatale pretends to fall in love with him. But the potion only ""lasts"" a week, so the Naive Rich Boy keeps having to buy another $1,000 vial of this fake stuff. Naturally, there's a surprise twist ending.

2. A criminal with $300,000 in kidnap loot stops at a tourist trap, run by four criminals (including an Aging Femme Fatale diner waitress). The four criminals kill the first criminal, steal his loot, then proceed to betray each other. But in the end, there's another surprise twist ending.

3. Two brothers -- a loser doctor and a loser ex-con -- plot to defraud an insurance company. The doctor will drug his ex-con brother so that he appears dead, will certify him dead, and then bury him. Then he will unbury him, and they'll collect the life insurance money. But there's a surprise twist ending.

Aside from the low production values, the actors range from mediocre to not so good.

Despite it all, I kinda liked this oddball crime/suspense anthology. It's not very good, and no horror content. Yet it's interesting to see these old, obscure oddities, largely because they are obscure and odd.",1331078400,2,1774,4.681672025723473
