8371932,5,B002KFV1HO,"""Learn Fingerstyle Guitar In 8 Weeks""
by Jason Shepherd

It is instructional for beginners and intermediate guitar players looking to refine their finger-picking technique.

I like the presentation because it is slow in the beginning assuming that a student has little experience. The instruction patiently progresses a student over 8 weeks. I have been playing guitar for many years and I still found the instruction to be helpful. Especially, when it comes to finger-picking. I am self-taught and have acquired some habits that were affecting me to play a classical guitar proficiently. One cool thing about the DVD was that my mouse scrolling wheel allowed me to 'go forward' or 'go backwards' to a previous lesson in seconds. The close-up views and the instructors patient-style-of-teaching make it so easy to see exactly how to do the lesson and progress from week to week.

The cost of the DVD is less that one half-hour lesson and makes learning easy, providing that you practice daily.

I recommend this DVD to anyone wanting to play-improve Classical Guitar finger-picking in 8 weeks.

Order it, you won't be disappointed.",1389225600,2,1131,5.125
8371933,5,B002KFV1HO,This is a great DVD if you're new or have little experience picking.  The finger picking techniques and triplet picking really improved my guitar playing.  My girlfriend was totally impressed with my progress when I was halfway through the program.  Definitely recommend this DVD if you want to improve your finger picking skills.,1294704000,4,330,5.188679245283019
