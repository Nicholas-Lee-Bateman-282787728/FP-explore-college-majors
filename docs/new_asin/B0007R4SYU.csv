2234104,5,B0007R4SYU,"Here is a truth-based and fictionalized account of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda told through the eyes of a soldier turned victim who lost almost everything including his family.

The term ""heart wrenching"" probably applies more adequately to this film than any I have seen in recent years, even a real life documentary on the origins of AIDS, for this movie details the real affect of 1 million deaths in the small African nation that occured during a span of less than a year.

As well as showing the human toll through the actors and the homeland -- this film was shot on location in Rwanda -- it demonstrates how the world, and the U.S. in parcitular, knew the genocide was occurring and how it avoided involvement for most of its duration. ""These are Rwandans killing Rwandans,"" one government official says, as if to say the slaughter is a national, not international, problem.

The film suggests that the killing ended when a revolutionary group took control of the nation and world powers began to ascend on the equatorial country. By omission, it also suggests the killing parade could have been ended after a month if the world became involved at that time. The U.S. was still licking wounds from its adventure in Mogadishu when the Rwandan genocide began, making it difficult for Clinton administration officials to commit resources to end the atrocities.

Unlike ""Hotel Rwanda"", this film eshcews Hollywood glitz and style to portray a slice of life look at what organized murder can become. It is stark in its portrayal of ruling party members coming into neighborhoods for no reason other than to murder residents who belong to the wrong group in the caste society.

For me, it was akin to the zombies from ""Night of the Living Dead"" being given guns, machetes and clubs as well as governmental power and told to go on their merry way. It is a very sad but realistic portrayal, one that stays in the viewer's head long after the cinematic portrait is over.

At one point a woman who houses two victims from a massacre at a girl's school says they can stay in her home until dark, when her husband will return. ""My husband and son-in-law are out killing,"" she says, matter-of-factly, as if describing their day jobs. The film is most effective in demonstrating how killing can become routine when the majority supports it and how regularly it can be carried out in your neighborhood, in your church, in your school, and on your street, which is full of dead people.

This is an important film and one that has lasting value in our world. Unlike ""Schindler's List"" it doesn't have big stars and the Hollywood glamour machine supporting it. But its story is equally as telling about an event in the real world that most of us gave about as much thought to as the remnants of our morning toothpaste going down the drain.",1111363200,11,2828,4.701010101010101

2234184,5,B0007R4SYU,"There have been over the year's some good films made that told of the horrific mass killing that occurred in the small African country of Rwanda in 1994. The movie ""Hotel Rwanda"" and the PBS documentary series ""Frontline: The Ghosts of Rwanda"" have been among the best I have seen. The best of all of them though is I feel ""Sometimes in April"". Made by HBO for television it is story telling at its very best as it tells how the events were set in motion that would spiral out of control so quickly and especially brutally. Started in April of 1994 within one hundred days around 800,000 men, women and children were slaughtered.

This is one intense movie. It will keep you on edge. Even so while it tells about the violent actions that took place there is no overly gruesome scenes of blood and gore. Still this might not be a film for young children to watch because of how intense at times it can be. But this is a film I highly recommend to watch. It does an excellant job of telling what occurred and the results of the actions that would take place. I very highly recommend this film.",1451001600,,1091,4.374384236453202

2234283,5,B0007R4SYU,"Amazing movie and avoids the over emotional and gratuitous violence in so many of these films.  Sometimes gives a personal insight into how chaotic and devastating the genocide was for Rwanda as a whole.  It illustrates the mass murder committed by friends, neighbors, and colleagues based simply on an imposed classification system.  I have watched several films on genocide, it is my area of research, and Sometimes still affects me emotionally, not just because of the killing, but the failures of the international community to intervene appropriately.",1436832000,,556,5.367816091954023

2234305,5,B0007R4SYU,"Sometimes in April is a terrific, powerful and difficult film about the Rwandan genocide.

I have seen this many times.  I bought the DVD awhile back after watching it online and it affects me e-v-e-r-y time.  A wonderful cast, mostly African, including a deeply felt, moving and effective performance from Idris Elba, a large, imposing man, whose mother is from Ghana and whose father was from Sierra Leone. Elba you likely know from his role as Stringer Bell in The Wire.  I have never seen him give a bad performance even in less than stellar films. 

 Raoul Peck, the director, is a Hatian whose family fled the Duvalier dictatorship for Kinshasa.  Several actors are Rwandan.

Sometimes in April  manages to be a richly evocative, dramatic film and at the same time have the impact of a riveting documentary.
Highly recommended.

This movie gives a sensitive portrayal of what they endured in 1994, and this viewer wishes that our country had responded sooner.",1330387200,,261,4.777777777777778
2234391,5,B0007R4SYU,"I first watched this harrowing drama several years ago. The drama depicts the events in Rwanda in 1994, and also focuses on the aftermath and how survivors have coped since the terrible events. Idris Elba plays Augustin Muganza, a Captain in the Rwandan Army whose brother Honore Butera works for the tribalist Radio Television Libre des Mille Collines. They have different views on politics, and their brotherly bond is further tested with the outbreak of violence. Things get really bad, and Augustin fears for the safety of his Tutsi wife, Jeanne, and their three children - Anne-Marie, Yves-Andre, and Marcus.

Unlike Hotel Rwanda, another powerful movie on the subject, this production depicts violence in gruesome detail. I don't think I'll ever be able to get images of machete-wielding thugs out of my mind, the dragging sounds they made in anticipation of a fresh kill. It just gives me goosebumps, and watching these villains maim and kill thousands of innocents makes me wonder if humanity ever learned anything from the Holocaust which saw the genocide of 6 million Jews and 5 million others?

The film credibly portrays the tide of politics which led to the outbreak of violence and how survivors have learned to cope with the aftermath. I wonder if true forgiveness is at all possible in such cases, and yet, how can one possibly forget? The horrors of that time, and the scars of painful memories, of having lost one's nearest and dearest, will forever be carried within by survivors.",1327363200,,1499,4.968127490039841

2234393,5,B0007R4SYU,"This was a wonderful movie.  I visited Rwanda in August and traveled throughout the country with my daughter, who lives and works there.

What is striking, given the date of this review, is just how ludicrous the world can be. It is shameful! People knew the events were taking place but with no oil or resources for nations to maul there was no interest to lend a hand. There are no acts of humanitarianism by super powers, just self fulfilling acts that benefit leaders of nations - self interest. Take the wikileaks for example that are surfacing today. The ""problem"" is the leaks? How can that be? The leaks are documents of criminal acts by leaders of governments - so why is the site questioned and not the leaders?

If you want to get a sense of international mismanagement - I feel we have the responsibility to do so, please watch this video. Other sources on the topic would include Darfur now, and The History and Sociology of Genocide (see below).

This video is a great entertaining presentation of an event we should not have to document.

Obviously, there has been wrongs committed on both sides here, but the Hutus' referral to the Tutsis as ""cockroaches"" over public radio is outrageous--as well as their inhuman treatment of the Tutsis that is very similar, in my opinion, to the Holocaust of the Jews.

I found this film to be much better;  better written, acted, overall storyline more engaging and gripping, without any overt editorializing from a western viewpoint.  On the otherhand, perhaps I feel that way because I read Paul Rusesabagina's book (An Ordinary Man), on which Hotel Rwanda was based,  and it was 1000% better than the  film.

In the interview the editor, Cameron Strang had commented on how the local people in Rwanda had said that if they had to pick a movie that told their story, they would choose 'Sometimes in April'.  Hotel Rwanda was good, but it did not accurately capture the character that Don Cheadle played.  The main factor missing, which Hollywood inserted, was genuine compassion for the people that he was saving.

This was truly an excellent movie produced by HBO films and Raoul Peck.  Movies like these need to be made to give voice to the voiceless who are victimized and so that we here in the West, can learn from the mistakes made in the past, so that future generations will never ever let something like what happened in Rwanda occur again.

The genocide occurring in Darfur has such chilling parallels, but at least the people there don't have to shame the rest of the world into action to provide help.  There we have a chance to stop genocide as it is actually occurring.

inspired ""Hotel Rwanda"" spoke at a local college. Afterwards at the reception, I asked him what he thought of this film in comparison to his biopic ""Hotel Rwanada"" and he replied in his usual eloquent fashion, ""Sometimes in April is the book-Hotel Rwanda is a Chapter.""

Anyone who has seen both films to compare will agree.

Essentially, this is a slightly fictionalized tale of two brothers during the Rwanda massacre that began in April 1994 (thus the title). The evil brother agitates tribal genocide over the radio and the good brother risks his life to shelter victims of the madness that follows. In comparison to Hotel Rwanda (and not taking anything away from that film), this does a better job of explaining the backstory of what led to the Rwanada massacre for those who aren't familiar.

In either case, this is a fine (albeit occasionally heart-wrenching-as it should be) story of the dangers of listening to demagogues and man's inhumanity to man.

about the gripping Rwandan conflict in 1994. This is a story of two brothers whose political standing became divided by the genocide which engulfed the nation into a chaotic nightmare, a small but beautiful African nation unjustly abandoned by the international community. The movie depicts a genocide which consists of an organized attempt by the Hutu majority to exterminate the minority Tutsis. Not by gassing as the Final Solution  applied to Europe's Jews in World War II, but by bullets,clubs and, of all gory ways that could be thought of by the human mind, machetes imported from China. Moderate Hutus(Hutus against the horrible persecutiuon) as well as heroic Hutus who risked and gave their lives to defend their Tutsi neighbors and friends were also targeted for murder. The lot more easier to identify Tutsis ,thanks to the Belgian Colonists who issued Identity Cards to distinguish Tutsis from Hutus during those colonial times. The admissions of guilt, the confessions, remorse and pleas for forgiveness can not make up for the senseless slaughter of loved ones as experienced by the protagonists in this movie although they are trying their best to forgive and start a new life. However,those memories will linger for the rest of their lives. Rwanda in 1994 has shown the world that without any genuine and effective effort of control nationally and internationally, genocide can still haunt this planet we live in.",1179705600,7,1504,5.089068825910931
2234478,5,B0007R4SYU,"""Sometimes in April"" is a difficult, often disturbing movie to watch, but one I think is important to see.

Shot in a semi documentary mode largely on location in Rwanda, with lots of flashbacks from the present, it tells the story of the attempt to systematically wipe out the Tutsi minority (referred to as cockroaches) by the Hutu Majority.

After first giving the viewer a synopsis on the genesis of the bad blood between the two tribes from the days under Belgian colonial rule, the movie settles into the story of two brothers, Augustine (a soldier in the army) and Honore Muganza (a radio presenter; excellent performances from both actors, as well as the entire cast which was comprised largely or Rwandans), as tensions rise in the country, cumulating in the shooting down of the president's plane which serves as the spark for the massacres to commence.

It is heartbreaking watching former neighbours and friends turning on one another with machetes, clubs and guns, all because one is from the `wrong' tribe, the death of Kurt Cobain getting more airtime, and foreign governments debating whether `acts of genocide, or an act of genocide' is taking place, while an estimated million people were killed over a period of a hundred days.

Much more graphic than ""Hotel Rwanda"", where the viewers were largely insulated from the savagery going on outside the hotel walls, it was important that this tale be told, and mankind, hopefully learn from this, and while ensuring such a thing never happens again, also realize that every human life is worth something, regardless of whether oil runs beneath your feet or not.",1178668800,6,1625,4.941391941391942

2234480,4,B0007R4SYU,"It's shocking the extent of indifference in our country to situations in nations that don't rest on our borders or house our greed-feeding resources. The Rwandan genocide of 1994, the extermination -- for the Hutus referred to their Tutsi brothers as ""cockroaches"" -- of close to a million people over the course of 100 days, is perhaps the most incredible and disgusting event in modern civilization. But who remembers it as well as Kurt Cobain's suicide which was discovered the same day as speculation that a civil war had broken out in some country and between two peoples nobody had ever heard of? Seemingly worse than Nazi extermination in its pure senselessness; more akin to the Bosnian-Serb split on fast forward. It would be as if Nazi Germany had divided its Jewish population into two classes and let them slaughter one another -- that's what Belgium effectively did when it divided Rwanda into two camps. ""Sometimes in April,"" named for the month in which the carnage took place, is a haunting view from the inside told through the eyes of a Hutu soldier with a Tutsi wife who is himself in danger and loses his wife, three children and watches his best friend killed in the process. In fact, he loses everyone in his circle save one: his brother, who over the radio helps fuel the Hutu propoganda machine, and who 10 years later wants to own up to his crime, while trying to reconcile with his brother. The docudrama, which spares no detail of the horror of those 100 days, is interspersed with political tiddlywinks here in the U.S. in which, when hundreds of thousands are known to be dead, the talking heads aren't even able to agree whether the term ""genocide"" applies -- and which leaves one ultimately wondering: What if they had been white Christian families?",1153785600,10,1780,4.763754045307444

2234507,4,B0007R4SYU,"This was one of the most moving films I have ever seen. Didn't have the flash of Hotel Rwanda or Schindler's List, but possibly surpassed them in substance. This is not a film for the squeamish, but a film about genocide shouldn't be if it is to deliver its message with maximum effect. Even 11 years on, we in the West get only glimpses into the happenings of the Rwanda Genocide and even fewer in the Western World even attempt to understand the reasons. In just 100 days, over 1 million Tutsis and Moderate Hutus were killed while the world looked the other way. I think this film demonstrated this very well, while at the same time it showed that there were some (Debra Winger's character) in the West who tried everything to help but could do nothing. It doesn't blame the West for the genocide like an uber-liberal, Michael Mooresque America-bashing festival would, but doesn't forgive the West for letting it happen either (which is more than reasonable). ""It was Rwandans killing Rwandans"", was the line used by the US Army general in the film to give an excuse as to why nothing was done by the outside world. But I think the most important message in this film was that in the living hell that was Rwanda during the genocide, there were still incredible acts of courage and humanity (the Hutu farm wife who sheltered the Matron and the school girls). An aspect of the film that struck hardest with me was how quickly the spiral of madness and slaughter struck so quickly and so terribly. The interplay between the main characters also showed that many of the people who complied in this most evil of crimes were not monsters out of a horror novel, but regular people who through self-interest or ethnic bigotry became the tools of this remarkable insanity. To sum this up, I gave this movie a 10 out of 10. The reason why I did is because this is a movie that should be seen by all. To paraphrase the motto of the survivors of Hitler's Holocaust, ""Never again"", Sometimes in April reminds us all that we should keep to that promise.",1136246400,5,2042,4.551630434782608
2234508,5,B0007R4SYU,"SOMETIMES IN APRIL is the powerful and stomach-churning story of one family caught in the middle of the 1994 Rwandan genocide of one million Tutsis, Tutsi sympathizers and anybody else who got in the way of the Hutu army.  Did you get that number?  One million dead in the streets and their homes in 100 days!  At one point our fleeing protagonist sees a convoy of dump trucks filled with dead bodies.  He just stares wordlessly in disbelief.

One of the strongest virtues of the film, besides being filmed in location in Kigali, Rwanda, is how very un-Hollywood this film is.  The main character (Augustin, a Hutu married to a Tutsi woman) is just a man.  He's not weak or overly strong, he's neither a victim nor a hero he's a common human and that makes it very easy to identify with him.

This film has some highly graphic images that should not be seen by children (a dog eating a dead child, brutal machete hackings, children gunned down), but for adults this movie is a real eye-opener that needs to be seen.  I cannot recommend SOMETIMES IN APRIL enough.

2234509,5,B0007R4SYU,"I loved this movie. I found it more powerful than ""Hotel Rwanda"", partly because it was filmed on the spot, right where the events took place 10 years ago.

The main actors were great, although not Rwandese themselves, particularly the first male caracter who acted brillantly. I wasn't so convinced by the actress who played a teacher and his girlfriend though, perhaps because she didn't look or speak much like a Rwandese.

The director took a meticulous care at depicting people and re-enacting events where they took place. Having visited Rwanda and Uganda, I was particularly moved by this story ( and I could see and smell all the colors and scents of Africa, which are still so vivid in my memory. Such as the smell of the earth when rain is falling... ) You can catch the beauty of Eastern Africa, and perhaps have a glimpse at what politics there look like...

The relationship between poor African nations such as Rwanda and the rest of the world hasn't changed much since the genocide, although a lot of efforts have been put to let us think otherwise. More than any other movie or documentary made on the subject, the director succeeded well in showing the hypocrisy of politicians and bureaucrats in the West, who matched but did nothing as thousand of lives were savagely murdered.

On the other hand, there was not enough emphasis perhaps on the political climate prior to the genocide. The disparity between rich and poor, the fact that power usually lays in the hands of a dominating and ruling tribe, are just one of the few reasons which can explain this massacre.

The Rwandan Genocide

The Rwandan Genocide killed almost a million Rwandans of both Tutsi and Hutu ancestry(?) The Hutus outnumbered the Tutsis by almost six to one but had historically been subservient socially and economically to the Tutsis.

There is really very little difference between the tribes who share a common language and history and had gotten along well and been intermarrying for four hundred years. Physical differences had almost disappeared totally when Belgian colonialists, who had taken over the country from Germany after the First World War, started categorizing the population as either Tutsi or Hutu based on their version of physical traits. Still even though arbitrarily ethnically divided, the newly defined Huts and Tutsis got along fairly well, even though the Tutsis were the Belgian darlings and had been put in charge, via a monarchy.

This changed in the sixties when the sister countries of Rwanda and Burundi received their independence. Hutus outnumbering the Tutsis took control of the government and lashed out at their oppressors, killing thousands and sending hundreds of thousands of refugees into neighboring countries. Eventually a group of Tutsi ex-patriots decided to take their country back by forming the RPF (Rwandan Patriotic Front) and invading Rwanda in 1990.

This set the stage for the murder and mayhem of Tutsi and so called collaborating Hutus, including the systematic slaughter of innocent women and children which took place in the spring of 1993. This is the setting for one man's story in the movie Sometimes in April

I cannot begin to imagine what it must have been like to go through something like this, yet thousands of survivors must have witnessed or heard about their wives, husbands, brothers, mothers, sisters, fathers, sons, daughters, nephews, nieces, in laws or friends butchered like vermin. There was no mercy, no humanity, no hesitation, only grim determination to wipe out all vestiges of the Tutsi tribe from Rwanda.

Our hero, Augustin (Idris Alba)- I really don't know whether to call him a hero but being a Hutu and former soldier, on the run from fellow Hutus, made him seem like one - lost his entire family and his best friend to the madness that was present in that spring in 1993. His brother Honore, (Oris Erhuero) was complicit in the rampage as a radio personality exhorting and inciting the mobs that roamed the streets and countryside of Rwanda but he got to see the results of his evil deeds first hand, while trying to perform his only good deed, witnessed the murder of his two nephews. His sister in law was wounded and he later managed to get her to church refuge, where she later died.

Augustin, after seeing his friend Lionel shot to death in front of him, manages to find safe haven in a hotel (Not the hotel in Hotel Rwanda but didn't know his families whereabouts. He later finds and starts to take care of Jeanne, (Carole Karemera)the woman who tried to save his daughter, both of whom were part of a mass gunning in the Catholic school she attended. Eventually in the present time Augustin finds out from his brother, jailed in neighboring Tanzania, what befell the rest of his family.

The story was told from present time with Augustin reflecting back to his ordeal. Saying there was a story is probably a misnomer. The story in the early part was denial, escape, helplessness, hide, resolve, hunt, terror, cruelty, kill, finality, death, SURVIVE and in the latter part anguish, melancholy, memories, hope, loss of hope, apathy, move on, SURVIVE.

Conclusion

This movie was a colossal downer, though the story did need to be told and viewed. It lasts some two hours and twenty minutes but it never dragged. The film moved along well and held my interest the whole time. I thought the director, Raoul Peck, did a magnificent job and even though this was a made for TV (HBO) movie it never seemed low budget. The acting was nothing short of sensational. The fear was palpable as was the anxiety and other emotions.

As you might imagine hundreds if not thousands of actors participated on both sides of the line dividing good and evil. I couldn't get over the cavalier attitude of the young executioners, their total disregard for life. I noticed they kept referring to their victims as snakes or cockroaches as if calling them that made them less then human and made them feel more like exterminators. I'm sure this is the mindset that took place in all previous genocides and the current extermination going on in Dafur, Sudan.",1124236800,13,5053,4.937573616018845
2234533,3,B0007R4SYU,"Unlike most of the reviewers of this film, I was overall disappointed with the film.  I was vey enthusiastic about seeing the film after reading ""Shake Hands With the Devil"" (UN General Romeo Dallaire's accout of Rwanda's genocide) and seeing Hotel Rwanda).  However, I was disappointed by the end of the film.  I feel the writers tried to cover too much of the war and from too many perspectives.  In addition, I was alarmed that the writers did not emphasize the power tool of the RTLM, the Interahwame's brainwash radio.

However, there were parts of the film that I did like.  True accounts can been seen throughout the entire film.  The girl's school genocide did occur and the schoolgirls did stick together.  The militia did go house to house killing off all opponents and political activists for peace.  Unfortunately though, the film appeared to summarize these events than really actually tell a story.

For anyone who wants a very accurate account of the genocide, Ghosts of Rwanda is an excellent, and eerily disturbing, account of the 100 day genocide.  Also, ""Shake Hands with the Devil,"" ""We Wish to Inform that We Will Be Killed With Our Families Tomorrow,"" and ""Justice on the Grass"" are goods choices for reading.

The film is not as harsh of a depiction as Hotel Rwanda is.  And as for Hotel Rwanda being too Hollywood, I beg to differ.  Director Terry George did not depend on graphic violence and effects on this story; he relied on the powerful and heroic tale of brave individual named Paul Rusesibegina.

The film is beautifully scripted and directed by Raoul Peck, and filming in Rwanda lends it a verisimilitude that ""Hotel Rwanda"" (filmed in South Afirca) can't match.

This is largely due to the fact that all scenes were shot in Kigali itself, that the director knows the context by heart (see his other remarkable movie ""Lumumba""), that the story is more compelling and the origins of the conflict and the responsibility of the international community are well presented.

I have worked in Rwanda and talked to survivors. They depict what is shown in Sometimes in April: the survival among corpses, the dogs eating the corpses, the cowardice of church leaders, the hate radio and so much more that is depicted accurately in the movie. All is here without romancing anything. Just the naked reality as it happened.

Sometimes In April captures the viewer in the chaos that was Rwanda in 1994.  Very similar to Schindler's List in that it exploits the casualties of genocide that the International Community did not know/care enough about for a very long time.

This movie should get consideration for picture of the year. Raoul Peck should be recognized for his work and should be awarded director of the year as well. Another excellent feature put together by HBO.",1118880000,6,659,4.475
2234539,5,B0007R4SYU,"This 2005 HBO film made me think of Hotel Rwanda.  Both films are about a middle class family with a Hutu husband and Tutsi wife who are caught up in the Rwandan massacre.  But unlike Hotel Rwanda, the characters in ""Sometimes in April"" do not fare as well and the violence is all front and center, not somewhere offstage in order to make the film more palatable for Western audiences.  The characters are also more complex which makes the story more compelling.

When the film opens, it is 2004 and it is raining, as it always does in April.  Augustin, played by Idris Elba, remembers back 10 years, when his life changed forever by the events around him.  Now, he lives in a nice house with a woman who, at first we think is his wife.  She is pregnant with his child but they are not married.  He is still wearing his wedding ring from his former marriage and it is difficult for him to move on to marry this new woman.  There is a letter waiting for him which he is reluctant to read.  It is from his brother who is on trial for genocide and who he has not seen for 10 years.  He brother, played by Oris Erhuero, was a journalist who had a radio program.  It was this radio program and the voice of his brother who spurred the Hutus on to murder.  Although his brother never personally murdered anyone, his guilt is being decided by a tribunal, of which Debra Winger is one of the prosecutors.

Much of the film is a flashback to 1994.  Once Augustin had a happy family and once he even thought he would be immune to the violence because he was in the Army.  But this didn't happen.  And the audience is now exposed to scene after scene of the violence which made me shudder in a way that Hotel Rwanda did not.  It also made the two brothers very real and conflicted human beings who lived through a time where hard choices had to be made constantly.  It is not a pretty picture, and it certainly is not about a hero who triumphantly saved his people.  There is short scene in the film set in a hotel where the guests used the water in the pool to survive.  This scene was played out in detail in Hotel Rwanda and also in a recent novel I read called ""A Sunday at the Pool in Kigali "" so I can only assume that this particular incident is based on fact. But most of the film was set in other places - in a Catholic girls school which Agustin's daughter attended, at the many roadblocks where citizens were murdered unmercifully, in a church where many tried to get refuge, in the swamps where dead were dumped and the living tried to survive. And, of course, at the tribunal itself which is trying to look for individuals to blame.

The two women in Augustin's life also had hard choices to make.  And each of them performed heroic acts to save others.  Pamela Nomvete Marimbe was a teacher in a school when the soldiers came.  Carole Karemera is the wife who lost all memory of the acts committed on her family and later saved others by an heroic act of self sacrifice of her one.  I was moved by their courage during this unspeakable time.

All of the actors playing Rwandans were excellent.  I can't say the same for the actors playing U.N. inspectors, whose performances tended to be wooden.  However, I think this might have been by design of the director and in no way changed the way I felt about this film.  Too bad it was only shown on HBO and never got to the big screen.  However, it is available on DVD.  It is more than just a story about Rwanda.  It is a story about brother, about family and about how people act when the unspeakable changes their lives forever.

Highly recommended.  But certainly not for the squeamish.",1118448000,7,3639,4.317109144542773

2234554,5,B0007R4SYU,"Sometimes In April is a shocking portrayal of the lives of Rwandan survivors Augustine Muganza (excellently played by Idris Elba) and Sister Martine (talented Pamela Nomvete).  While lacking the flair of Hotel Rwanda, `Sometimes' makes up for flash with brutal reality of the atrocities committed in 1994.

The movie bounces back and forth between the genocide in 1994 and 2004, when Augustine's brother Honore is on trial for his involvement with the genocide through his radio broadcasts on RTLM ""Hutu Radio"" show.  Honore was a journalist who got caught up in the propaganda he spewed out over the airwaves, until the violence comes to his own family.

In 2004, Augustine is with Martine, and the movie goes backward in time from Honore's trial to document the horrors that both Augustine and Martine survived.  This made for HBO movie is much more graphic than theater-released Hotel Rwanda, brutally shoving into your face the mass murder of innocent catholic schoolgirls, horrific testimony from a mother who was tortured and raped for days on end, and the callus indifference of the westernized world.

""It's just Rwandans killing Rwandans,"" says one official.  ""We have no oil, no dams, there is nothing in Rwanda for you,"" says Rwandan militia member, encouraging the US to stay out of the genocide.  Equally as appalling as the mass murders are real-clips from Prudence Bushnell as she coldly described how the US classified Genocide, and all the political back-speak as the western nations tried to cover their impassiveness with words while one million human beings died.

Sometimes In April is a powerful, must-see movie, but not for the squeamish or feint of heart.  It is brutal, and reminds us to ""Never Forget"".  Expertly directed by Raoul Peck and filled with unknown but very talented actors, `Sometimes' will grab your attention and not let you go until the end.

I'm glad that we get to watch films like this, Hotel Rwanda, and Schindler's List, to understand what happened during the genocides of our recent past.

2234559,5,B0007R4SYU,"HBO continues to make exceptional films that should be seen in theaters and Sometimes in April is no exception.  Without sensationalizing the violence of the Hutus against the Tutsis in 1994, director/writer Raoul Peck nonetheless dramatizes the horror of the mass murder that took place in Rwanda.

One scene in particular illustrates the contrast of vicious Hutu army killers with the heroism of their victims.  The Hutu army has stormed a Christian Preparatory School for girls and found a young black teacher with fifty or so of her students hiding in a large classroom space. The army officer demands that the Hutus among the girls step away from their classmates, not knowing that the girls have already decided to stay together and support each other.  The officer becomes frustrated with the rejection of his order and opens fire with his men killing all but three of the young women.

Time and again cowardly, machete wielding Hutu thugs are confronted with the heroism of their victims.  Hutu radio has characterized all Tutsis as ""cockroaches"" and exhorts all Hutus to completely eliminate them from society.  In a little over three months over a million Tutsis and their Hutu supporters are brutally murdered.

How could the world, and in particular we in the United States, have watched with indifference?  The answer seems to be that Rwanda is a poor, small country in the center of Africa with no strategic or commercial importance to anyone.  Debra Winger plays the part of a key Washington official who tries to persuade the government to intervene, but with little or no support from anyone.

At the heart of Sometimes in April is the story of a captain in the Hutu army who has a Tutsi wife and three children.  This young officer experiences the tragedy of the genocide as he attempts to protect his family against the stupidity and evil that engulf his country.  The fact that he is Hutu and an outstanding officer with a fine record makes no difference in determining the fate of his family or anyone else with Tutsi blood.

Sometimes in April is an outstanding film that is sure to be in contention for honors as one of the best movies in 2005.  Those viewers unable to see this film on HBO are encouraged to get the DVD.  They will not be disappointed.",1113696000,100,2276,4.782608695652174
2234560,5,B0007R4SYU,"The gruesome tragedy of the genocide in Rwanda in 1994 absolutely must become public knowledge if we are to maintain the watch for symptoms of similar acts in the present and the future.  HOTEL RWANDA was a fine film that capitalized on the heroism of one man, and justly so, for his selfless vision that saved many lives.  But as far as a film that relates the same story without the emphasis on one hero, SOMETIMES IN APRIL is for this reviewer more powerful: the genocide speaks more loudly because it focuses on the victims.

Writer/Director Raoul Peck has created a stunning impact with this film made for HBO. The details of the history of the rebellion of the Tutsis against the Hutus is clearly explained and made far more understandable than in previous efforts. Peck wisely utilizes the talents of Idris Elba and Carole Karemera  as the husband and wife of mixed marriage and it is their story of survival and witness that makes this examination of Rwanda so intense.  Oris Erhuero and Debra Winger among others feel completely committed to this story in the way they bring honesty and credibility to their roles.

Photographed on location, this film is at first a country beautiful to look at and then the beauty of the land filled with corpses is nearly unbearable.  The contrast is typical of the way Raoul Peck has sculpted this important film.  By Hollywood standards as well as by Public Information standards, this is a film that should be seen by everyone as not only a fine movie but also an important documentation of a tragedy that should have never been ignored.
