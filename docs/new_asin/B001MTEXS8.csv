3700188,3,B001MTEXS8,"Complete series, so it is as advertised. However, there are two drawbacks. Only about six episodes fit on each DVD, so if you're settling in for a binge session you will need to constantly put a new disc in. It also doesn't have the auto start feature, so if you like to doze off to your favorite sitcoms (as I do), when the current episode ends, it will go back to the main menu, as opposed to starting the next episode. Otherwise, no complaints.",1492646400,2,447,4.333333333333333

3700453,4,B001MTEXS8,"If you're actually reading a review on Martin because you're unsure weather or not to buy this, let me tell you to stop. You either know how amazing this show is/ was or you don't. This show is CLASSIC & easily one of the funniest, most well written shows that was EVER on TV. We aren't talking about this show though, we are talking about the product so hold tight...

The packaging is fun & colorful. The disks come in that weird overlapping packaging that requires you to move other DVD's to get to the one's behind but that's something that's forgivable. It's been a while but I believe that the 1st season doesn't come with the ""Play All"" option so you'll have to hit play on each episode separately. Besides that, no issues.

*SPOILER (KINDA) ALERT!!!!!!!!!* I guess my only issue & critique of this amazing show is the last season. It's almost unwatchable because of Tisha Campbell filing a lawsuit against Martin & some *I believe* producers on the show. It got so bad that she didn't want to appear in any scenes with Martin. Because of this, the last season is truly painful to watch because you can see an obvious shift in focus of all the actors. Shame really. The show could have had 10 seasons easily.

Either way, this is an absolute must buy. If you're a fan of 90's sitcoms this is the only one to OWN.",1347926400,2,1319,4.419753086419753

It is less expensive to buy them individually since each season is only 14.99. I'd rather pay the 75.00.",1284076800,5,263,5.0
3700459,5,B001MTEXS8,"Martin Lawrence is hands down one of the funniest under rated men in the biz. The Martin show is a classic that will forever make you and your family laugh! I remember watching this show when I was 16 years old when it was on the air and I was in stitches every episode. Now I am 30 years old and I am still laughing out loud to this series! I was truly sad to see it leave the air.

There was some behind the scenes drama with Martin and Tisha Campbell (Gina) which ended the show abruptly and although Season 5 in my book, was the least funniest because of what was going on behind the scenes it was still funny! It's a shame because no other person could have played Martin or Gina besides the 2 and they had awesome chemistry on the show. Pam, Tommy and Cole are also characters that was made for the actors that played them.

Martin has always attested his inspiration to Richard pryor another GREAT comedian. Get this series you will not be disappointed!",1284076800,4,960,4.269230769230769
