8127102,5,B000FUF794,"Great political commentary of the media circus surrounding the King incident and the '92 LA Riots. Sadly, with today's 24 hour news cycle, history is repeating. A must-see for not only the common man, but for all the news outlets.",1473724800,2,230,4.775
8127103,5,B000FUF794,"Rather dark for my comedic tastes. But this is one of the better comedy movies I know of. The cast is superb, the acting is excellent and the story is absolutely bug nuts.",1469491200,,171,4.212121212121212
8127104,4,B000FUF794,"After watching the trailer i've always wanted to see this film, after I ordered on Amazon my family, boyfriend, and i were laughing so much, this is the funniest film we've saw and enjoying it.",1353715200,,193,4.542857142857143
8127105,4,B000FUF794,"Snoop Dog presents his vision of tragic 1991 year events in L.A.-race-motivated riot as farce occurred.

Personally, I like his porno ""In the Dog House"" the most.",1274227200,2,162,5.0
8127106,2,B000FUF794,This movie is horrible. It was such a waste of money and time. It's not one of those movies that you can watch twice.,1221955200,,117,3.9166666666666665
8127107,4,B000FUF794,"Not since South Park and Police Academy has comic satire been so bold, relentlessly offensive and outrageously funny. From the very first scene when white cops bet on the ethnicity of the driver of a car they pursue, you know what exactly you're in for. One of the officers, Powell (Estevez), claims that betting on black is always a safe bet. His partner, offensively-named Koon (McDonald), bets on Spanish. They start beating on Rodney King (Carter) who comes out from the vehicle while Snoop Dogg emerges form the sidelines a narrator--and a rapper. Back at the police station, there's even more racism as an officer debates on what derogatory name they should call black people. Soon enough, Asians, Jews, and Spanish people also get stereotyped and insulted, especially in satirical news stories. To add insult to injury, a TV crew follows the events for an Entertainment Show and, in a hilarious scene, the deaths and injuries increase along with the Nielson Ratings. Jonathan Lipnicki, best known as the little kid from Jerry Maguire, has a cameo as the son of an anti-Semitic father. George Hamilton also briefly shows up as a wealthy man--what a stretch!-- from Beverly Hills who tries to call order to all the chaos. Admittedly, the humor does get a bit redundant toward the end with more of the same ethnic jokes. Fortunately, writer/director Marc Klasfeld keeps the movie going at a fast, energetic pace that doesn't overstay its welcome at a running time of 80 minutes. Stay tuned through the end credits for additional scenes.
