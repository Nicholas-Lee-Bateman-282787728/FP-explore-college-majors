4651003,3,B00005JOW8,"`Manderlay' is the second in his trilogy about America (or his own idea about it), following `Dogville.' Fortunately `Manderlay' (139 minute long) is much shorter than the predecessor, told with a tightly-written script. And the length is hardly problematic when Lars Von Trier's hypnotic visuals are still there.

Like in `Dogville' the film is shot with minimum props, on the bare-bone soundstage and the white lines that mark the streets and houses of the place. This time, however, Lars Von Trier must have thought it better to give it a change, so you can also see iron fences and gate surrounding the minimalist set, which represent the border of Manderlay, one forgotten town in Alabama, where slavery is not yet abolished though the time is set in 1930s.

Grace, the same woman who left Dogville with his father (Willem Dafoe) in the first film, passes by the gate, and finds that one young black person is going be whipped for punishment by a white. Not following the advice from his realistic father, and another one from the dying old lady of the town (Lauren Bacall), Grace decides to interfere, and insists on staying there with some of the gangsters, in order to set everything right.

But the film is directed by Lars Von Trier, great Danish cynic that made `Dogville' and `Dancer in the Dark,' and her well-intentioned efforts (not without arrogant attitudes) are going to be thwarted from early on, because of the unexpected resistance from the black people who seem to prefer the old way of life. However, Grace is determined to dispense `justice' with orders and punishment, only to find that she actually embarked on near impossible task.

Bryce Dallas Howard plays Grace, who is much better than in `The Village' (and sorry, but I hated the film). She gives a much stronger performance as the heroine, but it cannot be denied that she is still miscast, more than 15 years younger than Nicole Kidman who played the same role in `Dogville.' The glaring discrepancy in age alone is trouble, but more troublesome is that it is hard to believe such a young and inexperienced protagonist can really do what she can do, even though backed up by some gangsters (who are in fact shadowy presence all through the film).

But the biggest problem is that the director doesn't seem to have grasped what he is really talking about. The film can be read as satire against today's America's foreign policy especially in Iraq, but the satire is not particularly insightful, and greatly undermined by the sub-plot about Grace's sexual fantasy about one proud handsome male. Sex scenes are graphic with Ms. Howard's nudity while Von Trier completely forgets other capable cast like Chole Sevigny and Jeremy Davies (returning from the first one in different roles). Even Danny Glover, good as he is, seems to have been underused.

Perhaps `Manderlay' is best appreciated as Grace's personal story though it is obviously intended to annoy audiences in America. And if you are living in America, you will no doubt find it annoying - in what way will depend on your perspective.",1145491200,4,3076,4.871892925430211

Von Trier's Brechtian Gamble

On Manderlay

This time ""liberal"" is a dirty word

By Jayson Harsin

  ""The movement must address itself to the question of restructuring the whole of American society . . . America must be born again!"" - Martin Luther King Jr. 1967

  ""Dear (American) liberals,

  You're Idiots!

  Love, Lars.""

In a nutshell, that is the message of Manderlay, controversial Danish filmmaker Lars Von Trier's latest effort. Yet Manderlay is a complicated film that will produce multiple interpretations. Some will walk away calling it racist and anti-American. Others will find it a condemnation of Bush's war in Iraq. Yet, as I say, it is mostly a critique of American liberal politics. A condemnation of conservative racial politics is its point of departure. The film's complicated style and extreme plot produce intentional uneasiness.

Von Trier has cited German playwright Bertolt Brecht (right) as an artistic inspiration; yet one may wonder if he is reinventing the Brechtian wheel, one that Brecht himself admitted did not turn for others as he had wished.

In the 1930s Brecht revolted against realist theatre, which he thought reproduced and naturalized the conventions of everyday life. He developed techniques to alienate spectators and remind them that they were watching an enactment of reality instead of reality itself. He wanted to force a critical consideration of the represented world, and his techniques included flooding the stage with bright light, using the most minimal props, and projecting explanatory captions on a screen. Von Trier uses many of Brecht's techniques in Manderlay, the second film in his trilogy USA: Land of Opportunity. For Von Trier, the U.S. is and has always been a land of upwardly mobile opportunities for some; for others the opportunities have been dubious, basically to be humiliated, enslaved, exploited, murdered, and kicked in the ass - sometimes all in one life.

The film begins with a kind of placard announcing that the story of Manderlay will be told in eight chapters, each one of which is similarly announced throughout the film. Like its predecessor, Dogville, Manderlay rejects high-tech flashiness, forcing audience concentration on dialogue and actions. Its set is sparse. Von Trier's use of these techniques is fascinating, but it is not clear that they are successful. After all, like Brecht, doesn't he have a rhetorical goal? While many may leave unsure of what they just saw, few will find Manderlay uncontroversial.

On one level, the film is set in 1930s Alabama, on a plantation called Manderlay, where 70 years after the Emancipation Proclamation, slavery is apparently still being practiced. Continuing the narrative of Dogville, Grace (now Bryce Howard), after touring with her gangster father (now Willem Dafoe) and his thugs since her departure from Dogville, stumbles upon Manderlay with her father's entourage. She is alerted to the anachronistic existence of slavery by a slave who asks her for help. Her father asserts that this is a ""local matter,"" echoing a common Southern response to Federal intervention in race problems that was often coded through ""states' rights."" It specifically recalls the language of Martin Luther King's powerful ""Letter from Birmingham Jail,"" in which he responded to Southern clergymen who had accused him of, among other things, being a meddling outsider.

White liberal American intellectuals will no doubt have a hard time resisting identification with the white do-gooder Grace, who, like the North, the Federal government, and the social worker, believes that race relations at Manderlay are in moral terms not a local matter. ""We have a moral obligation,"" Grace says to her father, as she persuades him to loan her gangster firepower to oversee her reform initiative.

But King was African-American and Grace is white. Should that matter? It matters in terms of Von Trier's audience (mostly American art cinema liberals and European intellectuals). It also matters for the history of white social and policy reactions to ""the race problem,"" liberal and conservative responses, from segregation to integration, welfare to workfare, white flight to affirmative action. Grace's color is extremely significant. Resonances with Faulkner's Intruder in the Dust and Absalom, Absalom can also be found in the simplicity of the white liberal Northerner's analysis and solution to race problems. In this sense, Von Trier's provocative film is perhaps above all else an indictment of American liberalism (or liberal individualism), domestically and globally. All of these aspects should be considered through the lens of his Brechtian alienation techniques. Otherwise, this turns out to be one of the most ignominiously racist films since Birth of a Nation.

First, domestically: the historical debate about freedmen and resistance to them is important. While one could go back further, the contradictions of the modern liberal-race problem invoked by Von Trier date from the end of the Civil War. From 1865-1867, white southerners made very little effort to welcome African-Americans into a reborn American society (symbolized by the historically altered Constitution). The Ku Klux Klan together with the Black Codes terrorized African-Americans physically and deprived them of education and the legal franchise. While some American historians have noted the important changes of freedmen and -women marrying; establishing households, schools, and churches; owning 20 percent more land during the Reconstruction years - others emphasize that even so, the country did not solve the problem of race. And the South in particular, in terms of land reforms, enfranchisement, and education, was not ready to change of its own accord. Many African-Americans exercised agency and made valiant efforts to become self-sufficient, yet they faced no little opposition from the planter class and some poor whites (even though evidence exists of some alliances between African-Americans and poor whites).

While Von Trier's film does little to emphasize the efforts made by African-Americans to exercise their freedom in the ways I've noted, it is virtuosic at portraying the structures many faced when they set foot off the plantation (symbolized by a shortlived character who, venturing off the plantation, waits for a sympathetic woman, a white reformer like Grace, but finds bloodthirsty white men instead). The role of a traveling salesman huckster also portrays the white mediation of emancipation through debt peonage and sharecropping. The failure of Reconstruction with the Compromise of 1877 brought a more precarious period of civil and economic life to African-Americans in the South.

And yet Manderlay makes claims to a historical context in the 1930s. Here von Trier's dramatic vehicle of slavery existing in the 1930s is again more metaphorical than realist. The point is that while the furniture of racism was rearranged, it was still the same racist edifice. In addition, the role of an African-American leader is played by Wilhelm (Danny Glover), a house slave entrusted with knowledge of the entire Manderlay plantation rules and governance. Echoing views of nineteenth-century African-American leader Booker T. Washington, Wilhelm's analysis is that under the conditions at Manderlay, his people will meet a better life by consenting to the old social structures. The fact that armed gangsters must enforce the redistribution of social roles on one piece of property, which disappears when they disappear, is not a little reminiscent of Reconstruction military occupation of the South and its aftermath.

Von Trier is using extremely exaggerated irony in order to make a larger point about the dangers and hardships ""free"" African-Americans faced in the society at large. Here he intervenes in the conservative view that African-Americans just need to exercise the freedom that was granted them in the Fourteenth Amendment. Likewise, he interrupts the liberal view that all African-Americans need is polite recognition, civil rights, and the legal franchise. More complicated structures discipline and organize daily life, reaching tentacularly up to the present and reproducing the racial inequalities of the past. This has been the unsettling lesson of African-American power/separatist movements of the 1960s and the larger Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and '60s. One should recall that Martin Luther King died organizing for a Poor People's Bill of Rights.

Von Trier's other major indictment of American analyses and solutions to the race problem involves American social welfare practices. The film dramatically attacks the social welfare solution that took hold in the post-World War II period, which is based on the individualization and pathologization of African-Americans in poverty. Instead of extending New Deal visions of economic and social rights as prerequisites for liberty to African-Americans, poverty became medicalized and culture became racialized in 1960s studies of African-American poverty. The solution was to send in stereotypically white, do-gooder social workers to rehabilitate poor African-Americans. Even in the wake of hurricane Katrina this paradigmatic solution remains dominant.

The social worker is represented by Grace. Her reformist tendencies are called forth by a slave woman who pleads for her intervention in a whipping of another slave, Timothy, who was allegedly framed for a crime in order to maintain ritualistically the white plantation power structure. Grace seeks to rehabilitate her subjects, teaching civility and democracy to those who apparently were systematically taught to never know these white inventions. They use these new tools to first of all exact Old Testament justice, being devoid of Grace's New Testament liberal sympathy and mission.

Von Trier carefully notes the slaves have adapted to their ""type-casts"" (seven categories that range from buffoon to self-serving, wily chameleon), because of ""psychological bondage"" and survival, as Wilhelm and the narrator comment. Genre narratives' type-casting requires expectations of audience; in this case the white power structure makes race relations a genre. This reflects both contemporary scholarship on ""weapons of the weak"" to survive and resist in small ways, as well as the power of media to present images of audiences (the poor, African-Americans, women, etc.) to themselves, which they may take as ""real,"" and which may encourage them to perform their expected roles in everyday life. Studies of Hollywood's historical representations of African-Americans support this point.

Finally, Von Trier's film may also be an allegory of hypocritical American foreign policy. Using military force to impose democracy and dubious freedom is shown to be much more complex than is represented in White House speeches. Combine with that the irony that many analysts stateside and worldwide, such as Von Trier, view U.S. society as savagely unequal and unfree and you have the global indictment of the U.S.

Like Dogville, Manderlay ends to the soundtrack of David Bowie's ""Young Americans"" with images of African-Americans and their history from slavery through 9/11. The sardonic narrator John Hurt leaves the audience with a line about African-Americans' rejection of a ""helping hand."" This is either fully conservative (as would be the supposed racism of the entire film) or a total indictment of the conservative position that African-Americans are free. I would say there is plenty of evidence to suggest the latter reading. Just as Von Trier's trilogy is sardonically dubbed ""USA: Land of Opportunity,"" which can hardly be read literally, the narrator's concluding comments are also hardly literal. He indicts conservative readings that emphasize legal freedom and abstract it from very real, complicated, but powerful historical structures and institutional relationships. Equally, he indicts liberal social work analyses of the problem and solution as inadequate fixes bound to end in self-hatred and frustration when the partial non-structural solution fails to bring freedom and civilization to those the conservatives claimed all along were barbarians and unworthy of their tax dollars.

These merits aside, the film's biggest problem is not that it is racist but that it does not go beyond alienation. The audience is left to choose between the perspectives of the self-hating, frustrated liberal social worker, the accommodating African-American survivalist, or the conservative gangster-social Darwinist. Like many fashionable contemporary philosophies and stories, Manderlay depicts the complexity of the problem and leaves solutions for the audience to debate. But this is not just any topic. It is the most emotionally charged topic in America, and all the world knows it. What the world doesn't necessarily know, though, is that thousands of whites and African-Americans have died struggling against these dominant visions of and solutions to the race problem. By not including any redeeming characters, especially African-American ones, and instead drawing on stereotypes, Von Trier invites the charges of ignorant anti-Americanism and racism that have already beset him. His choices, they will say, reveal more about the European mediation and popular reception of American history than about American history in books and experiences. That likelihood is aggravated by the fact that Von Trier has never set foot in the U.S.

Manderlay is a trap for the so-called educated liberal elite (forget about the conservatives: they will never see this film). Their do-goodism is seen in this film and its predecessor to be nave and undertheorized. Uninterested in playing policymaker, Von Trier leaves his different audiences to argue about his depiction of the problem and, hopefully, about some new solution that has not been widely recognized so far. For this, Von Trier should be praised; no other visible cinematic voice seems to be engaging American race problems so fearlessly. But fearless can also be careless. The greatest value of this film will be the arguments it generates.

4651027,3,B00005JOW8,"<strong>Manderlay</strong> (Lars von Trier, 2005)

The big problem with von Trier's United States trilogy is that... well, it's a trilogy. <em>Dogville</em>, the first film, is mind-bending and brilliant and has so very, very much to say about America (though one could argue that many of the criticisms he levels at American culture, both in <em>Dogville</em> and the rest of the trilogy, are hardly peculiar to the United States). <em>Manderlay</em>, the follow-up, wants to be as pointed and angry, but it's... not. Part of that, I think, stems from the fact that racism in the Depression-era American south is just too easy a target. Part of it stems from the fact that of all the criticisms one can level at America, racism is probably the least peculiar to American culture. And as much as I hate to say it, part of it--the majority of it, perhaps--is that the <em>Our Town</em>-style single-stage setting, which was a big part of why <em>Dogville</em> was so mind-blowing, now seems as if von Trier is simply saying ""hey, it worked in the last movie, let's try it again and see if it plays in Skokie a second time."" Well, it don't.

<em>The Help</em>'s Bryce Dallas Howard--and in hindsight, perhaps the best thing about this movie is watching Howard, who in <em>The Help</em> plays a staunch racist, digging into this role--takes over as Grace Margaret Mulligan here, the gangster's daughter portrayed in <em>Dogville</em> by Nicole Kidman. The gangster himself, played by James Cann in the earlier film, is also replaced, this time by Willem Dafoe. As we open, it is some short time after the events of the first film; the family are still in the same car with the same gangsters. They pass a plantation, still in the throes of slavery, despite it being decades after the end of the Civil War. Grace is horrified by this, and demands to be left there to try and fix the problem. Her father eventually agrees, leaving behind a few gangsters as bodyguards/muscle, and promising to return after the harvest. Grace eventually finds out that the plantation runs under a written code aimed at the continuing subjugation of the slaves, who are led by Wilhelm (Danny Glover), a wise old chap who treads uncomfortably close to the Magical Negro line throughout most of the film. Acting as a foil to Wilhelm is Timothy (<em>The Diving Bell and the Butterfly</em>'s Issach de Bankol&eacute;), headstrong and independent as possible under the plantation's laws. And thus we have all the main players arrayed. Grace does her darnedest to educate the slaves and teach them what freedom (and the American way, natch) is all about given the time constraint. But there's always something not quite right about what's going on...

I think on many levels this movie would have worked were it not for its overreliance on a Big Twist(TM) ending that you can see coming for most of the film. (I should clarify: the twist itself is surprising, but you know SOMETHING is coming.) This is the largest of the factors that undercuts the movie, and when we finally get there, the twist itself is something of a disappointment. Then there's the fact that in <em>Dogville</em>, the criticism worked in service to the story; at no point, with the arguable exception of the film's climax, did the movie exist for the sole purpose of moralizing to the audience. That is certainly not the case with <em>Manderlay</em>, which almost seems to turn the dynamic on its head; there are few times when the movie <em>doesn't</em> seem to exist for the sole purpose of moralizing to the audience, which makes it annoying. Still, there are a lot of very good actors here doing what actors do best, which makes it worth watching if you can get past the annoyance.

<em>Washington</em>, the third film, was originally conceived for a 2009 release. To the best of my knowledge, pre-production has not yet begun on it as I write this in early 2012. Perhaps the string of successes von Trier has had since <em>Manderlay</em> will get him back on track? Unknown. But I still have some sort of morbid desire to actually see the thing that <em>Manderlay</em>, as hard as it tried, did nothing to kill. ** ",1327449600,3,4163,4.857746478873239
4651028,4,B00005JOW8,"Lars von Trier's American Trilogy continues, with Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard) trying to continue her effort to better herself by acts of contrition, something to validate her life. You must see ""Dogville"" to fully understand Grace's motivation. Ms Dallas Howard is fine, though Nicole Kidman established the characher of Grace so completely that there's simply not the same determination. It's a noble and complete performance by Bryce, with von Trier's requisite graphic sex scenes.  I won't blab away the plot, but the gist is that they come across a southern plantation where there are still slaves who don't know they'd been freed. Grace tries to show them democracy, after the matriarch of the plantation dies, and, of course, no one agrees...just like most politics. ""Manderlay"" continues Grace's effort for survival, true to her initial integrity, and continues to be misunderstood. Von Trier's bare bones exposition works well, and one performance, that of Mona Hammond, impressed me the most; simple, sincere. ""Manderlay"" is quite good, but not as focused as ""Dogville"".

In that respect he seems ignorant and immature. But in the field of the image he is excellent. Still I really hope that he will one day go to Hollywood!,1283299200,2,476,4.6117647058823525
4651031,5,B00005JOW8,"Phenomenal:  von Trier rubs shoulders with Aeschylus and William Faulkner

Manderlay consists of 8 'chapters'.

It is part of a trilogy entitled 'USA: A Land of Opportunity'.

It is set 70 years after the Southern War of Secession.

It is filmed on a sound stage: there is something successfully Brechtian realized here; the dream of epic theater and de-oxymoronfication of the phrase Modern Tragedy.

To the charge of the film's 'racism':  Bjork, after filming Dancer in the Dark, called von Trier ""an emotional terrorist'.  Taking this comment meta-politically, Lars von Trier is hardly 'conservative'.  In any sense. In any sense /whatsoever/.  In fact, if the powers-that-be ('conservative' and 'liberal')were better attuned to this -and praise to the Lord that they are miserable philistines one and all- Manderlay would have been demonized and banned forthwith.  Satires of 'Birth of a Nation' are not your typical movie-goer fare, but the ill-perceived 'racist' element in the film cannot be imputed to its Author: he is well beyond and above /just/ that, --creative sovereignty demands such independence from such vulgarities.

""Is this movie depressive, being so tragic?""
--Not at all.  The other component of tragedy is the Satyr Play.  Humor is ingeniously employed, with great intelligence by von Trier.  You will walk away from this film laughing.  Bitter, vicious irony has to find an outlet from resentment, and this is provided; oh so generously provided! (You'll just have to see the film;)

 [first lines]
Narrator: It was in the year of 1933, when Grace and her father were heading southward with their army of gangsters.

Events:

Gangsters relocate from somewhere in Texas after a business sojourn which leaves them unwelcome upon their return:  they end up outside the Manderlay plantation in Alabama, where a black is about to be lashed for an offense.  The daughter of the gang boss is asked by a female plantation hand to help.

They become involved.  The Daughter invokes an oath made by her Father on her mother's deathbed.  The business is divided equally: the Daughter receives half the manpower and oversees the 'emancipation' of the Manderlay slave hands.

The Mistress of the plantation dies shortly after their arrival and intervention.  The Daughter has the Lawyer draw up a contract/covenant.  The four Whites of the Mistress' kin are obliged to serve as farm hands with the former slaves for the duration of one planting-harvest cycle, whence the profit from the cotton is to be distributed and both they --and the blacks-- are released from further obligation to remain.

What follows cannot be discussed in-review, the dimensions of tragedy and intensely suggestive political suggestion (if not '/reaction/' ;) Lars Von Trier has created on 35mm is totally out of the scope of 21st century humanity's expectations and rationalizations, its desperate and compulsive meting-out-of and assignment-of meaning.  The material gives solid grounding for so many interpretations and meditations that outlining the salient ones can only serve to blind the potential viewer to certain nuances and boundary-blendings that would be better perceived (and appreciated) by a naive pre-viewer understanding and perspective.

What I can say is that the Father-Gangster Boss, the Card Sharp, and The 'Proud N---er' deserve especial attention while watching this film.

[last lines]

Narrator: America had proffered its hand, discreetly perhaps, if anybody refused to see a helping hand he really only had himself to blame.

Further extensive reviews available at imdb:

[...]

In closing, a well formed insight from a reviewer found there:

""Grace's color is extremely significant. Resonances with Faulkner's Intruder in the Dust and Absalom, Absalom can also be found in the simplicity of the white liberal Northerner's analysis and solution to race problems. In this sense, Von Trier's provocative film is perhaps above all else an indictment of American liberalism (or liberal individualism), domestically and globally. All of these aspects should be considered through the lens of his Brechtian alienation techniques. Otherwise, this turns out to be one of the most ignominiously racist films since Birth of a Nation.""

I would only add that the term 'American liberalism' as used above can be pruned for a more specific, descriptive meaning:

What is meant, is the gun-diplomacy of Yanqui Liberalism.  Or ""Yankee"", if you prefer the less colorful alternative to that appropriately loaded southern-latin construction. Not that Antebellum resentments and institutions are not given their properly due damnation by v. Trier as well, but praise where praise is due:  Yanquilandia, not America per se, is where he sets his axe on this root of evil.  And quite rightly so.",1271548800,6,4790,5.306772908366534

4651034,4,B00005JOW8,"For anyone who has seen ""Dogville"" it is a natural progression to see ""Manderlay"", part 2 of the American trilogy by the famously difficult to work with director Lars Von Trier.  I personally like his films because the center of the story is inevitable a woman: strong, independent if not naive.  In this film we come actross the plantation where black inhabitants are still enslaved despite the fact that slavory was abolished 70 years ago.  Our main character Grace takes it upon herself to free them and teach them how to become (economically) self-sufficient.  As much as Von Trier's critics were complaining about this work that they claimed was racially charged adn anti-american, when one thinks about it, Von Trier simply wanted to make it quite human.  We learn that regardless of racial characteristics, people are people and they can be categorized into seven types.  Film is actually psychological profiling that explains that it is our innate psyche that makes us what we are, who we are and how we see ourselves - not race, color or class.  Definitely a powerfuil message but film still gets only four start.  I do not understand why such gifted visual storyteller like Von Trier would resourt on making a film that looks as if it is made on the ordinary theatre stage with minimal props.  If you have seen his beautiful film ""Medea"" that is so visually rich, you would know what I am talking about. Still, this is one of those directors that should not be ignored.",1202083200,,1479,4.768627450980392
4651035,3,B00005JOW8,"Man, I was so disappointed in this film. ""Dogville"" is one of the most powerful and moving experiences that I have ever had in a theatre before, and they had to follow it up with this, ""Manderlay"", starring Bryce Dallas Howard as Grace, who was originally played to perfection by Nicole Kidman. Bryce Dallas, while I loved her in ""The Village"", doesn't seem to know what to do with this role. She seems lost, and she's the main character, and everything rests on her performace.

As with ""Dogville"", von Treir has taken the minimalist approach again, and we have the sporadically decorated, but otherwise bare, soundstage where all of the action takes place. It worked in the first installment of this supposed ""trilogy"", but here it all looks cramped and thrown together. The acting is sub-par, the narration is long winded, and could be considered slightly offensive to some, and it is just lacking in every way. Don't get me wrong, there are some powerful moments here. However, there is just nothing to ponder after the credits have rolled. It's like sitting through a big, long sermon with a pastor who doesn't know the source material that well. Eventually, you just find yourself tuning it out...

Given:

1. that ""Dogville"" suffers terribly from its' slow pace,

 2. that any sense of continuity between the two films suffers terribly from the loss of Kidman (replaced by a very limited Bryce Dallas Howard) and Caan (who was replaced by Willem Dafoe).

 2.  Von Trier's (and his teams') obvious ability as a director, as evinced by the power of their ""Breaking the Waves,"" and other films ...

... Would you agree ...

3. That Von Trier's treatment of his socio-politcal themes (forgiveness and compassion have limits, ultimately power, even dignity, comes from the barrel of a gun, the unexpected outcomes of attempts at social engineering abroad) are pointed, Bergman-bleak and have some validity as critiques of American's bungling and costly efforts to influence events abroad?

4. That it's a goddamn shame Von Trier hadn't decided to drop his theatrical conceit (of adapting the modernist staging of Thorton Wilder's ""Our Town"") and chosen to shoot these scripts more naturalistically (like Terrance Malick's ""Days of Heaven"") ?  The theatricality of the staging limited the effectiveness of the storytelling medium in both films.  These scripts are solid agitprop, and would've made for some solid, if didactic, even operatic, visceral filmmaking.  They would have made Von Trier the next Costa-Gravis.

4651040,5,B00005JOW8,"This is an excellent film. In the second installment of his proposed American trilogy, Lars von Trier, touches on the subjects of racism, cultural blindness, hypocrisy and self-righteous superiority. In its way, it points at why America is simultaneously admired and despised the world over. Famously, Lars von Trier has never set foot in America (afraid of flying). So his views are the views of a foreigner, specifically a northern European steeped in the liberal tradition. Some will see that as a negative. I think it is refreshing for Americans to see how America is viewed from abroard, from someone unencumbered by its cultural baggage. What he shows is the ugly side of America. But von Trier's comment is by extension a critique on all humanity; for what Americans are here accused of, is equally applicable to other nations, races and creeds.

The story is simple. It carries on chronologically from Dogville. After destroying the godforsaken town in the bloody climax of the previous film, Grace (previously played by Nicole Kidman, and now by Bryce Dallas Howard) drives homeward with her father and his convoy of gangsters. They chance upon a plantation in Alabama where slavery is still practised, some 70 years after abolition (this is 1933). Grace gets it into her mind to free the slaves and to teach everyone, former slaves and Masters alike, about the new creed of equality and democracy. With the aid of her gun-toting gangsters, she preaches and enforces her new religion on the ""benighted"" people of the plantation. Of course, out of the seeds of her good intent, come no good at all.

The film can be viewed on many levels. The simplest is to take it as a commentary on racism. Passing a decree does not abolish racism. Nothing changes as long as hearts and minds don't change. Preaching empty words will not alter generations of abuse and hatred. On the flipside, it also poses the question: why do certain groups of people remain so backward and unsuccessful? Is it because of their past or themselves? It's a question that reaches beyond the black/white divide in America, to vast swathes of the world, from Africa to the Middle-East, where societies and nations have floundered and where they all invariably blame their past and their ""victimhood"" at the hands of white colonisers. Do they bear no responsibilty for their own fates? Is it simply easier to blame someone else than to take responsibility for one's own actions? The abdication of responsibility is sadly an all too American trait, but it is by no means confined solely to America.

We are also called to ponder on Grace's self-righteous attempt to free the slaves and more importantly, her attempt to force them into seeing things her way. Apart from its obvious ridiculing of the ""do-gooder"" abolitionists, and by extension, the superior white man with his constant chant of equal rights and democracy, it is also a comment on present day politics. America's actions across the world instantly spring to mind. Its endless, simple-minded attempts at interfering with and changing others to fit its own image, is today mirrored by other world actors; newly rising powers, increasingly resurgent religions, all of which similarly want to remake others into their own image - their prime justification being: ""I'm better than you, so you'd best do as I say."" It is a sad comment on humanity as a whole.

Like Dogville, this is a very dark film. It is not light entertainment. It is also not cinma vrit. Do not expect realism. It does not aspire to historical accuracy. It should be taken more as a parable than a history lesson. It is wide open to interpretation. I especially liked Brandon Medford's analysis (further down) which I thought was spot-on. And I agree with him that to look at this solely as a film about slavery or racism is to impoverish the work.

Manderlay follows in the Dogme 95 tradition of Dogville. It is Dogme brought to its extreme conclusion - a filmed stage-play with minimalist sets, with actors acting and pantomiming on stage. If you don't think you can sit through a 2-hour-plus stage play, this film is not for you. Acting is fine overall. I wasn't affected by the change of cast. Lars von Trier's films are not centered around stars, although Nicole Kidman was the ideal choice for Grace.

The DVD from IFC is totally bare save for the film. It is beautifully transferred in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio (enhanced for widescreen TV). Colors are accurate, black levels are perfectly set. The DD 5.1 soundtrack is front-centered and is clear enough although I turned to the optional English subtitles after a while.

Note: There is a very graphic scene of copulation, even more explicit than the rape scene in Dogville.",1160179200,27,4742,4.875930521091812
4651041,4,B00005JOW8,"I just can't help myself. I always have to see what Lars von Trier is up to. I think von Trier sees Americans as either hopelessly self-deluded or secretly self-loathing. Either way, he once again has allowed us to peer into his head in order to see America through his eyes (even though he has yet to step foot on American soil due to his own fear of flying). To say he's an irritant would be an understatement. He has quite a talent for getting under one's skin and setting up camp for a long while even after the last reel of film has unspooled. He's annoying, provocative, controversial and possibly one of the greatest directors of all time. Just like his film style and choice of subject matter - you either love him or you hate him. I kinda like that. I like a filmmaker who forces the viewer out of the gray dullness of life - to take a definitive stand and to have a direct opinion about something ... anything. He's thought-provoking, ascerbic and scathing at his best and he's a somewhat simplistic, narcissistic, petulant man-child at his worst. But, I promise you this: after seeing Manderlay, you will have an opinion and you will have food for thought for quite some time. This is a bold and daring film and von Trier delivers his message with surgical precision.

In the second part of his proposed American trilogy (the first part being his last film, Dogville), the story's hero, Grace comes upon a working plantation (Manderlay) complete with slaves and slave owners. The problem is, the year is 1933. Are these people living a vacuum? Well, it seems it's up to Grace to ""break the news"" to all involved. Her gangster father, played by Willem Dafoe, urges Grace to not get involved but headstrong and rebellious Grace (played by the talented but miscast Bryce Dallas Howard) is of another opinion. Driven by a sense of compassion or maybe a ""god complex"" or something of that nature, Grace decides to intervene and, very quickly, her good-natured intentions backfire and set into motion a tragic series of events.

This film is rich in social and political allegory. It is a scathing attack on American foreign policy namely unwelcome American intervention and democratization. There's also an even larger assault on America's history of black oppression and slavery - sometimes referred to (and rightly so) as the African Holocaust in America. I don't think it is the purpose of this film to ""point fingers"" and to place blame since slavery was an institution brought over to the New World by Old World Europeans. Even von Trier surely knows that his own country of Denmark bears the guilt of systematic oppression while it occupied, subjugated and ruled harshly over the countries of Norway and Iceland for many centuries. But, I digress... (sorry but I'm still somewhat irritated!) Rather, I think the purpose of his latest film is more of awareness and not condemnation. It is a parable or maybe a cautionary tale.

In keeping with the Dogme 95 movement, von Trier has once again stripped down his film making style to its most basic elements with the focus being on narrative. Just like in Dogville, the entire 133 minutes takes place on a rudimentary theatrical stage with props kept to a bare-bones minimum. With the stage floor once again outlined in chalk designating areas such as ""Mam's Garden"" and ""The Well"", the viewer is once again coaxed into focussing more on the dialogue and storyline as opposed to rich, scenic backdrops and computer-generated special effects. He's minimalist and thoroughly post-modern. Not only is von Trier irritating the audience with his subject matter, his ""shaky wandering"" style of filming is back. Will someone buy this guy a tripod! Just kidding. Although, it does take me about fifteen minutes to acclimate myself to this style. I really don't mind. Anyway, throughout the film, the ever capable John Hurt provides voice-over and much-needed momentum to the sometimes tedious interaction of the principals. Without getting into too many details, young Grace teaches the slaves to be autonomous, punishes the plantation owners and screws up everything in the process. Danny Glover is great as the elder slave but he is woefully underused throughout the film. The same goes for Lauren Bacall, Chloe Sevigny and Jeremy Davies (all back from Dogville but, in new roles). Although I like Bryce Dallas Howard very much I feel that she was a poor choice for the demanding role of Grace. An older actress was needed to make the part more convincing. The role demanded maturity and wisdom and Nicole Kidman delivered both effortlessly in Dogville. And although Howard tried her best, she came up short. I'm not blaming Howard for this one bit. This was von Trier's fault. Although many of his films center around the subject of female martyrdom employing a woman-child sort of protagonist possessing great inner strength (see Breaking The Waves, The Idiots and Dancer In The Dark), this trilogy requires a strong female character of a different order. Namely, a woman of emotional and intellectual maturity who is less vulnerable and more resilient both mentally and physically. A woman who is not hopelessly idealistic and moves in and out of the harsh realities of life with great agility. I think Nicole Kidman embodied the spirit of the Grace character and it was sad to see her not return to the role. I don't think she wanted to return from what I heard. Willem Dafoe replaced James Caan as well and maybe for the same reason. I'm not sure though. Anyway, that's my opinion for what it's worth.

I think von Trier wants to and likes to shock his audience out of relative complacency. For example, I read that the mule was killed ""on-film"" (allowable under Swedish cinematic law)and that it was later edited out for the US version. A good move on von Trier's part since it would only serve to stir up unintended reactions and distract from the main focus of the film. Another example would be the ""way too explicit"" sex scene between Grace and one of the other members of cast (I don't want to give too much away). I found it to be exceedingly gratuitous and it could have been more tastefully done maybe from a distance like Nicole Kidman's unfortunate rape scene in Dogville. Both sex scenes were necessary to move the story forward but, there's a right way and a wrong way to do things. Actors put their trust and faith in a director's vision but sometimes compromises between actor and director must and should be made. I think this is yet another example that shows the difference between the wiser, more mature veteran actress Kidman and a non-veteran actress such as Howard. Kidman knew where to ""draw the line"" with the director.

Anyway, it probably seems like I didn't like the film. Well, I actually did like it tremendously and although it was hard to take in both visually and ideologically, it was a necessary pill to swallow. It took me some time afterwards to process my feelings about this film and to put pen to paper (or more appropriately, fingertips to keyboard) and few films have that effect on me. After seeing Dogville and Manderlay, I'm almost dreading to see what Mr. von Trier has in store for us with the final installment of this trilogy. I can't wait!",1157328000,14,7245,4.7928
4651042,5,B00005JOW8,"[Caution: some plot points revealed in this review.]

Manderlay is yet another brilliantly transgressive, widely misunderstood film from Lars von Trier, who has made a name and a career out of messing with audience's heads, emotions, and expectations.  The film is set at an Alabama plantation where, seventy years after the Emancipation Proclamation, slavery still thrives.  The horrified Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), who arrives in Manderlay after her escape from Dogville (the previous film in von Trier's trilogy), decides to ""emancipate"" the slaves, and establishes a system of democracy in which everyone is now ""free.""  However, the former slaves simply trade one form of institutionalized oppression for another--a new system that calls itself freedom but under which nothing has really changed.

Through the character of Grace, von Trier criticizes bleeding heart white liberals (and, during the 1800's, many abolitionists were white women like Grace, who often felt more pity than respect for slaves).  Grace seems to be motivated to help the slaves by guilt, pride, or a sense of self-congratulation rather than a sincere desire to help them improve their lot.  Thus von Trier mocks white liberals who advocate for human rights because doing so makes them feel better about themselves.  This form of ""help"" continues to objectify underprivileged people and denies them any real agency.  Hence, Grace teaches the freed slaves how to vote, but then disagrees with one of their verdicts.  Again, she is less interested in allowing others to think for themselves than in forcing others to think like *her*. As in Dogville, von Trier shows how ""good intentions"" can backfire if not carried out with caution. Eventually, perhaps inevitably, Grace has come to adobt the rhetoric of the slaveowner, and in the last scene resorts to whipping the former slave whom she initially intended to ""emancipate.""

This is not to say that von Trier is arguing that slavery is good, or that it should never have been abolished, or that all liberals are evil.  Rather, von Trier uses this film to expose the complexity of America's racial hypocrisies.  The Emancipation Proclamation technically ""freed"" slaves, yet Americans' ideologies about race were not changed.  As a result, black people have continually struggled to survive in American society, as von Trier disturbingly reminds us in a montage of photos of impoverished and tortured black Americans which plays over the end credits.  A group of people cannot really call themselves free if they are still imprisoned by racist institutions that deny them true subjecthood.

This film also borrows many ideas from post-colonial theory, mainly the idea that a group of oppressed people remain oppressed as long as they are not able to act, think, or decide for themselves, which is precisely what happens in the film as a white woman attempts to ""act in the best interests"" of the black people of Manderlay.  Grace views black people as a humanitarian cause rather than as individual subjects, and therefore does not encourage them to think for themselves or make their own mistakes.

Once again, the film reveals some unpleasant truths about race in America.  The film has undoubtedly caused controversy among many viewers (which, as many have pointed out, is exactly what von Trier intends).  Viewers may be tempted to jump to conclusions or knee-jerk reactions while watching this film rather than thinking about it critically.  Again, this is what von Trier, a great manipulator, wants from his audience--to shock and anger them.  It is tempting to write Manderlay off as a racist film simply because, for example, it contains a scene in which a white woman whips a black man, and another scene in which the former slaves explain that they would rather be slaves than be free (or rather, live under Grace's version of freedom).  However, the critical viewer will be able to see that von Trier endorses neither abuse of black people nor slavery in this film.  Rather, he causes us to question racism in America and how efforts to eliminate it have been, unfortunately, mostly ineffective.",1156464000,6,4136,5.147982062780269
4651043,5,B00005JOW8,"Lars Von Trier does the seemingly impossible and improves upon the first part of the America trilogy, _Dogville_, here.  I shudder to think what he will achieve with the third  and concluding part.  Let me suggest that you get your hands on this movie immediately and you will at least know what direction Grace is heading at the end of this second masterpiece in Trier's cinema of cruelty.  The stakes are going to be REAL high in part three!

Where to begin?  And where to end?  I'm not going to trouble you with many details here because you should just watch this piece without any prejudice.  Let's just say it's an overwhelming piece that attempts to induce the truth through art.  And it's the first film where I've ever wept at the final credits.  Yes, if you've seen _Dogville_, you know the astonishing nature of the credits on that one.  Those were the first film credits I ever wrote a term paper on.  It only gets better.  And, no, I'm not being ironic.  Lars Von Trier is at such a high level of narrative and film-making craft that his credits are masterworks in themselves.

So I'm just going to say that this is about the legacy of slavery that is still with us to this day--if we are to give credence to _Manderlay_, and we better, we are also led to believe that slavery's aftermath is something we will not be able to truly smooth over any time soon (think of the Jews in Egypt).  Like in _Dogville_, nobody in this allegory of American (and, actually, Western) history ends up looking rosy at the end.  This is a panoramic and uncomfortable portrayal of Nietzsche's dictum of ""human, all too human"" that none of us really ever escape, not even those of us with sterling intentions.  This allegory is told and filmed with such amazing values that one can't help but wonder how Von Trier's movies don't even make it to theaters in Tallahassee (where I live), while indie war-horses like _Thank You for Smoking_ stay in our art-house for months (nothing against it, but I don't believe it has quite the amount of what the French call jouissance to it--this is the jouissance that really transforms, more than a good laugh--this is the laugh that laughs at the laugh--the risus purus as again, Nietzsche, would put it, that which laughs at misfortune--the most sorrowful and ironic feeling imaginable).  The Academy didn't nominate _Dogville_ and I'm guessing they won't nominate this one, either, though nothing I've seen this year comes close to touching it in sheer scope and execution.  Well, Trier can look forward to a lifetime achievement award in several decades, putting him in the company of other Oscar-less impresarios who received that award like Scorcese and Altman.

While bleak terms like ""existential"" should come to mind when discussing and watching Trier, don't get the idea that it's all passed off as meaningless.  Nothing could be more meaningful, it's just the feeling of helplessness that he prods us to examine, document, do anything but maintain the status quo with that we have done for too long.  This puts him at the helm of Western art of any kind that gets pegged with words like ""existential"": Beckett, Lispector, Sartre.  Despite the hopelessness we may derive from these masters, we often leave their works on fire more than ever to ""make things new.""

So, really, here's what we're talking about here.  This is a film by a middle-aged man at the height of his powers.  What can we look forward to when he's going gray?  Films with the resonance (and popularity?) of _Gangs of New York_ and _The Aviator_ are certainly not out of the question as he is making films of the same level now (America just ignores them because they hit too close to home--if ever a person was ahead of his time, it's Trier).  So buy this now, don't bother with rental.  You'll be able to say you knew all about this kind of greatness while the rest of the American movie establishment and public largely had its head in the sand.  As good as movies get!!!",1156377600,13,3984,4.664756446991404
4651044,5,B00005JOW8,"This review isn't intended to be particulary helpful but to rather to shed light on one of the greatest most unrecognized works of art in many years. Dogville and Manderlay are challenging and controversial films but so rewarding when watched by the right people. Being a film lover who watches close to 200 films a year, I revel in films that have an edge to them by taking a new approach to story telling and filmmaking. Trier is an incredible talent who has produced two refreshingly beautiful films that remind sometimes disillusioned film lovers like myself of the reason why I watch and love films and of what great heights films have the potentional to reach. I definately recommend anyone who sees films as an art form to watch this movie and its predecessor Dogville.",1156291200,3,776,4.7555555555555555
4651045,5,B00005JOW8,"One of the best movies of last year comes to dvd after dismal distribution in the U.S. Manderlay is the satisfying sequel to Lars Von Triers' film Dogville, but its style should be more accesible and knowledge of the first film is not required to see

the tale of a southern plantation in the 1930s which has still kept slaves. Presenting an symbolic history of Black Americans, it is a scathing indictment of the past and the present racial attitudes that refuse to be abolished",1151884800,3,479,4.635294117647059
4651046,5,B00005JOW8,"I've only seen the film once, but I felt that the most consistent interpretation was strictly about arrogant imperialism.  I found myself first seeing through a very direct lens of a slave narrative/american liberal white guilt.  This is an easy interpretation that lives on the surface.

The film then transformed into a statement about the presumption that ""we"" can teach others how to govern when ""they"" may have a system that works better in their context.  The system in Manderlay was not overseer/slave, the system was socialism/communism and each ""slave,"" as Grace saw them, had his or her own specialized role.  The inhabitants of Manderlay were free within their system, but Grace was so completely blinded by what her culture had taught her about ""freedom"" and ""democracy"" and the inferiority of all other ways of life.  The democracy she implemented was a complete farce.  Their society did not function when the arrogant outsider who thought she knew what was best for them began implementing her system with force.  The most direct comparison is ""operation iraqi freedom"" and other US nation building exercises or sponsored coups.

I found many other characters to be representations of a global system of oppression.  The card shark was an international lending institution like the World Bank or the IMF and the ""prince"" was a corrupt leader who sold out his people for a cut of the profits of the international business elites (like Marcos, Suharto, or seemingly countless others).

I was very pleased with Manderlay and thoroughly frustrated by simplistic the reviews I read of it.  I feel that this film falls apart with a straigtforward viewing.  As a white guilt slave narrative the film is mediocre.  As commentary on imperialism and an absolutely corrupt global system, the film is a wonderful composition.  I can't wait for Wasington.",1148256000,28,1857,5.082508250825082
