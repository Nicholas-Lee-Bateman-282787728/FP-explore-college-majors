I thank each and everyone of them.,1335398400,,327,4.109375

8399827,5,B003LTXC7A,"I love this show. It takes a lot of guts to get that close to something that dangerous, disasterous, and deadly. Imax film would really show the immense size of these storms and the powerful ferocity of them. Science can also help us to fully comprehend this awesome powerful destruction and save as many lives as possible.",1281312000,,323,4.684210526315789
