2879587,5,B000S2XD9U,"This is one if not the best British Comedy ever produced and I was delighted to find it available on DVD.
My husband and I watch one or two episodes every night and the dreary January weather does n ot seem to matter anymore.
I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to laugh out loud.

2879588,5,B000S2XD9U,"This is the best British Comedy of all time as voted by the British public and when the program finished after being on the air for almost 20 years, the British public demanded more and sure enough since 2000 they have created a Christmas speical every year. I have watch each episode at least 5 times each, if not more and still find them as funny as watching them on the BBC when I was growing up and living in the UK.",1191801600,7,420,4.134146341463414
2879589,5,B000S2XD9U,"This is the story of the Trotter brothers, Del-boy and Rodney. They live in a council flat in Peckham. Since their mum died when Rodney was ""barely on solids"" and their father walked out on them, Del has been the sole provider and breadwinner of the family. He makes his living buying ""'ooky gear"" and selling it in the market. His plans to become a millionare always fall short, probably due to the quality of goods he pushes. Still and all, Del is a family man, true to his loved ones and close mates. Del and Rodneys adventures take them all over the world in their 7 series run. They continued to make annual Christmas specials after the series ended leading all the way up to 2003.
The cast of colorful characters include the dim-witted Trigger, Boycie, the wanna-be posh entrepeneur, Marlene, his overly-friendly wife, Mike, the proprietor of their favorite hang-out ""The Nag's Head"", Grandad, who lives w/them intially and is replaced by their unlucky sea-faring Uncle Albert.
This series will leave you in stitches and occasionally bring a tear. The thick cockney accents of the players only adds to the humor.
Follow Del and Rodney as they marry, separate, become a father, become millionares (for a while), and live their hilarious lives.",1189728000,15,1248,4.836448598130841

Chopped episodes, episodes missing, episodes ruined by political correctness by easily offended 'liberals' that can't abide pretty benign 'cursing'. Censoring the word 'bulls***' with 'bullpoo' or something equally juvenile. How come a minority can always manage to spoil the viewing of the majority. Was going to gt this because this is probably THE best Britcom ever but with these problems, no way. I would also recommend 'One Foot In The Grave'",1431993600,,540,5.290697674418604

2879623,4,B000S2XD9U,A totally different David Jansen from Frost. If you can understand British humour you will love this series,1410048000,2,107,5.0
2879624,5,B000S2XD9U,"The first element I have to specify here is that it is a family series, i.e. a series the whole family can watch, and yet there are not many children in it, in fact there is only one, and he does not come straight away and he does not play the most important role anyway, even if he is called Damian, Damian Derrick Trotter, DDT for short, and the son of the devil as is well known. But this family series manages to have practically all along an older member of the family, a grand father at first and then a grand uncle till practically the end. These two older characters, played by two older actors is the truth in modern families: they finally depart when the second generation after them practically is beyond their mid-life crisis. It so happens that a generation is missing, the father and the mother, but that is necessary to have the type of relation we have between the two brothers, Derrick and Rodney Trotter.

The second thing is that we have here a comedy and only a comedy. They make fun of absolutely everything and nothing is serious even when it is dramatic and causes a lot of crying. It is a comedy and the real world outside is the real world outside, that means from the first episode to the last Christmas special twenty-two years have elapsed and you can easily see it with simple objects like the first microwave oven, the first portable telephone of the 1980s and then the slow evolution of these portable telephones, the first computer is a computer without a GUI that works with command lines and code and the last one is a laptop, and a small one at that. The world is changing along with the series, or vice versa if you prefer, and the events in the world are also reflected in the series: the fall of the USSR for example. At the same time these historical elements, or political elements, are not overwhelmingly present. They are only some kind of time bookmarks in the story for us to know where and when we are.

The second thing is that we are dealing with people who are at the bottom of society but who want to become millionaires one day. They are enterprising and they use all their mental and physical resources to achieve their objective. The means are simple: selling on the market, in the street. They are hawkers, street vendors. At the same time they deal behind the wings with everyone who wants a good deal on anything that is trendy at the time. They consider their business is their own responsibility and they will use all legal means and all illegal means to get their merchandise and then to sell it at a profit. They do not really make a fortune out of it but they are independent and they manage to live an eventful and comfortable, though not wealthy, life. Their main enemy is the police since they are always running from them and the theme of the police, what's more a rotten policeman, is vastly used. They live in a tower block in Peckham, hence in the county flats of the poor working people, a tower block called Nelson Mandela, quite a symbol in the period from 1981 to 2003. At the same time the opening credits are always the same, the closing credits too, and the songs of both, but also the background scene of the opening credits. The actors are aging, and some changing, but their presentation in the opening credits is always the same. And some elements never change, including of course the apartment and the three-wheel dirty yellow van.

The third element is that they are real people from Peckham, London, and they speak the language of the neighborhood, that is cockney, and cockney they do speak with the accent, the lexicon and the syntax, from the opening song to the closing song. If they are called Trotter it is because ""only fools and HORSES"" and ""Stick a PONY in me pocket / I'll fetch the suitcase from the van"" and most of the social life takes place in the local pub which is called of course THE NAGS HEAD. And the series is consistent about it. The only exception is in fact Cassandra, Rodney's wife, because she is from the middle class. Her parents are the same of course. In the same way, but maybe less clear cut, Rachel, Derrick's wife, because she is from ""outside"" and not from the inner circle of the Peckham boys that all the men in this series are. In the last Christmas special they get an old picture of the ""boys"" at school when Derrick was in his middle teens, and Rodney is officially not on the picture since he is quite younger, but in fact he is because someone who was the proper age at te time the picture was taken looks just like him at the age of 17 or so, and that's the big secret about Rodney's father that has been lurking around all along and that explains why the real father in the family, Derrick and Rodney's mother's husband, left the family shortly after Rodney's birth. That biological father of Rodney is a character of some sort and you'll have to watch the series to find out.

The last thing I will say is that the series is hilarious because it is British, and even because it is BBC. It is stuffed, filled, coated and heavily loaded with British humor, with puns and jokes, and I am sure you will not get them all, and it does not matter because the audience laughs for you and you know you have missed something. This humor has no limits and nothing is taboo, or nearly nothing is taboo, though they do not seem to make fun of religion that much and they do not practice political humor or satire. But all the rest is possible and they go quite beyond the traditional and limited themes of the desert island, marooned on a desert island, plumber's jokes, old spinster's jokes, adultery and homosexuality. They exploit situational humor tremendously and very creatively, and always with finesse, British finesse. Always associating the situation, the story being told, the language, the body language and references to cultural and contextual elements that we are supposed to know. There is a parody of a certain Elvis Presley that is absolutely murderous, with the dry sausage (of a very ""reasonable"" size) that the fake middle-age surrogate Elvis Presley gets out of his pants after his performance and his inability at pronouncing the letter R. Derrick and Rodney costumed as Batman and Robin running in the streets of Peckham at night is quite funny too. Grand uncle Albert and his stories as a veteran of the British Navy during most of his life and especially in World War II are a perfect funny illustration of the absolutely sane but excessive ranting and raving of the very old generation who try to educate the younger ones with their past.

For all those reason and at least several thousand more that's the comedy you will be able to watch night after night and probably re-watch over and over again. You have forty-one and a half hours of pleasure made eternal on twenty-six discs: that may last a good fortnight for the whole family in the evening.

2879645,5,B000S2XD9U,"ONLY FOOLS AND HORSES premiered in the early 1980s, at a time when Thatcherism was just beginning to take hold in Great Britain.  As portrayed by David Jason, Del Trotter wanted to join the ever-growing throng of yuppies making loadsamoney and spending it on champagne and women.  The only snag was that he could hardly survive in his chosen profession of buying and selling with his company Trotter Independent Traders (or TIT for short).  John Sullivan's comedy was one of the BBC's best-loved series, running for over two decades in total.  It made a star out of Nicholas Lyndhurst, while proving that David Jason was a fine dramatic as well as a comic actor, able to cope with different situations.  Mention must also be made of Lennard Pearce (later Buster Merryfield): neither of them were well-known actors, but their contribution to this family comedy must not be underestimated.  ONLY FOOLS AND HORSES conjured up a seedy South London world of dodgy deals and shady characters - all of them lovable in their own way, yet always living on the breadline.  The comedy had a social realism often missing from sitcoms of an earlier period, which helps to explain why it attracted huge audiences.",1364947200,,1199,4.876847290640394

2879648,1,B000S2XD9U,My husband ordered this for me for my birthday.  When it arrived multiple episodes wouldn't play.  Sent it back and exchanged it for another only to have the same issue.  Some discs would not play at all.,1353801600,8,204,4.45945945945946
2879649,1,B000S2XD9U,"I recently purchased the Complete Collection of Only Fools and Horses (Series 1-7 plus Specials) and was greatly disappointed in the lack of quality control in the production of this box set.  Disc 2 contained 2 defective episodes and disc 3 did not play at all.  It is unfortunate that after attempting to watch the first 3 of the 18 discs in this set, 2 of the discs are defective.  I played the discs on two different DVD players and had the same problem.  It is unfortunate that such a great series is spoiled by poor quality control in the production of the DVD discs in this set.  I will have to return the set for a refund.",1346803200,8,630,4.305084745762712
2879650,3,B000S2XD9U,"The three-star rating is a reflection of the video and audio quality, NOT the series itself, which is easily 5-star!  The series is more than 30 years old, and the video and audio quality aren't of today's higher standards, but the discs play quite well on an upscaling blu-ray player.  Picture and sound are actually quite good, and the subtitles (in clear, unobtrusive white print) are helpful.  Believe it or not, there are many sections of dialogue displayed with CORRECT grammar even when dialogue is deliberately spoken with poor grammar!

The series is also quite endearing as well as funny, due to surprising character development throughout.  Delboy, the main character, and his much younger brother Rodney share a public housing apartment with their grandfather.  All the illegal money-making schemes Delboy riggs to care for himself, his brother, and his grandfather are very funny on their own, and the outcomes often hysterical.  Much to my surprise, however, Delboy also frequently displays genuine concern for his brother Rodney and his grandfather!  The cast is VERY good.

Regarding packaging, it would be helpful if the complete series was in a digi-pak, but it isn't, so be prepared to condense the amount of shelf space the series takes up by repacking the discs in slim cases, all 18 of 'em, currently packed in a large, unwieldy cardboard box containing 5 separate cases (two of which also are cardboard!) of three to four discs each.

The  current price the complete series is being offered for on Amazon ($75 as of July-August 2012) is finally affordable...if you are interested in the complete series.  Otherwise, I'd recommend holding out 'til it is at least that price (or lower!) again.",1343865600,,1714,5.039007092198582

For the longest time the specials were not available in the States, so I was dead excited to get this gift.

Only thing that would have been nice was if they had changed the boxes to plastic instead of the carboard for the first two sets.  The two boxes from my original set seperated and the clips broken in the plastic insert so the discs no longer stay in.  Hope this does not happen with this set.  I am sure the box they come in will help resolve this issue.

For the price this is a steal. I paid $40 for each single set.

I would buy this again.. and again.... and again....",1327622400,,668,4.092307692307692

I had to purchase the 1991-2003 Specials separately. I wish this series had gone on and on.  If you like  ONLY FOOLS AND HORSES, you might enjoy some other series in which David Jason has starred: THE DARLING BUDS OF MAY, with Catherine Zeta Jones (before she became Mrs. Michael Douglas).  This is a most delightful series, and David Jason is still up to his old tricks. You will love the Larkin's!  A BIT OF A DO is another fun series.  A TOUCH OF FROST casts David Jason in a serious role.  It is a 5 star detective series.  I have all of the above, and watch them over and over again.  If you know of any with David Jason that I have missed, please let me know.  He is one of my very favorites.",1315008000,,874,4.18562874251497

Menus are very easy and fast. Has a continuous play, so you press play once and can watch all disc, you can also skip episodes during continuous play, very good feature, I wish other DVDs I have would have that as well..
Packed in seasons very clearly.

2879657,5,B000S2XD9U,"This is a remarkable body of work and I am so glad that I took the chance and bought it! It started in 1981 and ended in 2003, but unlike American series it didn't drown the watcher and the last three episodes were a year apart! There was even one 3 year gap between 1993 and 1996 and one 5 year gap between 1996 and 2001 before they took up the series again. Never have I seen such continuity in story lines. It is amazing to me that the same actors kept coming back year after year to create this wonderful body of work. It deserved every award and accolade it ever got and those were many.

The first few seasons were half hour comedies and are hilarious, but you soon get to know these characters and become emotionally invested in their stories especially when they expand to full hour shows. By season 4 I was not just laughing, but crying. ""Only Fools and Horses"" succeeded in being both hilarious and extremely endearing. We are so lucky that we get to watch their stories unfold completely without having to wait 22 years. Best of all it answers the big questions and ties it all together by the final episodes. I can't imagine how invested people must have been who waited 22 years to get their answers. I know not everyone will like this series. My husband didn't like ""To Hull and Back"" and I do admit I didn't care much for ""Miami Twice"", but even these offerings are worth watching for the comedy and irony. A great show well worth your money and your time. There has never been anything quite like this and probably never will be again! This is indeed the best Brit-com ever made!!!",1305244800,4,1597,4.377104377104377

However, disk two from series 6 refuses to play at all and several of the other disks from series 6 through the Specials skip badly. This was true of the original set I ordered AND the replacement set Amazon sent to me. I have tried cleaning the discs but no joy. Very dissapointing. I'm going to try returning the second set for a third set in hopes that somehow it will be cushdy, but seriously it seems the sets Amazon have sent me have fallen off the back of a lorry and then run over several times.",1302998400,7,572,4.070796460176991

2879661,4,B000S2XD9U,"I purchased this and it arrived promptly which is always Cushty! I am an expat Brit living in America (as are many other reviewers here) and i am very happy with this product. The only problem is there seems to be a fault on a couple of the discs. The Christmas Specials disc in Series 1-3 the episode Christmas Crackers doesn't play well at all, and Series 3 the episode select menu is a little bit of a bother to select the episodes. But the episodes are fine once they get going. I have been considering replacing the whole set but i don't know if i can be bothered considering the comments on Amazon taking ages to replace items. In short. I can live with it.

As for Only Fools & Horses. I grew up in Britain watching this and I love it. I bought this to get my new American family into it and of course to have them for myself. My wife loves it as she loves Nicholas Lyndhurst in 'Goodnight Sweetheart'

If you love British Comedy you will LOVE this. The main characters of Del Boy, Rodney, Grandad and later, Uncle Albert really a charming and loveable family. The supporting cast of Trigger, Boycie & Marlene, Denzil, Mickey Pearce and Mike really complete the show and make the complete collection really worth your readies.

Of course Del Boy is the star but he wouldn't shine without everyone else.

To me it was a little hard to understand them at times but I think to me that was part of the magic of the show. It's the best I've ever seen. The characters are loveable, jovial, and as always have humerous situations. The charisma of ""del boy"" to me makes the show and his interaction with Rodney is classic, and real. a big 2 thumbs up.
Oh and don't waste your money on seperates 2 seasons will cost you almost as much as the entire collection. By the end of it they are like family members rather then characters. We continue to revisit them a few times a month.",1275004800,7,718,4.135714285714286

2879666,5,B000S2XD9U,"With this series I discovered two of my favorite English actors in situation comedy. These were David Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst, playing two brothers living in a council flat in London.  Their grandfather lives with them too.  Jason is Del-Boy, the elder brother and he is the smarter brother.  It is stretching things to call him smart but compared to Rodney, the younger brother he is.  Del-Boy lives by trading junk.  Rodney is considerably younger than he.  Since their mother died young, Del-Boy has had to raise Rodney.  There are a whole host of other characters, mostly people in their neighborhood, and they revolve around the brothers.  That is just the broad outline for one of the most hilarious sitcoms to ever grace a tv screen.  Del-Boy and Rodney are just a great comedy duo and I can understand why this was such a hit in the UK.  Another great thing about this show for Americans is that you see a whole different class of English people whom we don't usually get to see.  These are the people on the lower end of the spectrum, which is not the stuff of MASTERPIECE THEATER, to put it mildly. I became such a fan of the brothers that I chased down their other work in other years.  Jason has appeared in tons of other things but where he stood out equally as well is in A TOUCH OF FROST.  He is just a wonderful actor.  Lyndhurst was hilarious in the PIGLET FILES, about an inept cadre of agents working for MI-5.

Now we live in America and we got a bit homesick, so I decided to buy this collection. It was the best money ever spent. I have to admit that we were watching one series per day and it lasted us for like two almost three months. I just couldn't believe it how long and how many great shows this collection have. And specials o wow..If you are a true fan of Fools and horses you have to have this!!!",1238284800,2,515,4.108910891089109

Any fan of Brit comedy needs to see this series in full. Each season gets better and better. Having said that I do think that they went about three specials too far. On the other hand I wish that they were still making episodes by the dozens.

Amazon did a great job offering me an affordable price for the collection and the delivery was prompt.",1236211200,2,520,4.148514851485149

2879673,5,B000S2XD9U,"This is laugh-out-loud stuff (rare these days).  It is not surprising that this is the most popular British comedy series ever, out of a long history that encompasses John Clees, Rowan Atkinson and many other greats.  This is all there is, complete and unedited, all of the episodes  and the specials, beautifully recorded.

My wife and I viewed them from the beginning and followed the storyline with interest and mirth. Here are over forty-seven hours of great entertainment.  We watched anywhere from one episode to three almost every day and it has lasted us two months.

Amazon.com's price appears absolutely unbeatable and this we researched carefully and internationally.  Thanks Amazon.com,  Thanks ""Delboy"", Rodney, ""Trigger"" and all the other hilarious, unforgettable characters.",1232323200,3,789,5.462809917355372

It has every episode and every Christmas special along with a fabulous documentary about the history of the show with all the main cast members.

2879676,5,B000S2XD9U,"This comedy series, is one the most popular ever shown in the U.K. I'm a Londoner, now living in Kansas City, USA. I don't think many Americans would grasp some of the colloquialisms, as it's a bit unique to the Brits.

If you haven't seen it, it is based on two brothers, with the 'can't live with you, can't live without you' touch. In the early shows, their Granddad lives with them. He sadly died in real life, and is replaced in the show by his brother, Uncle Albert. The brothers sell anything, anytime, to anyone, and try to avoid paying tax at all times! They reside in a London subsidized housing tower block apartmernt/flat. They drive a 3 wheeled van, which looks as if it's on its last legs!

A brilliant concept, brilliantly written by John Sullivan, and superbly produced and directed by the good old BBC!

It's comedy at its very best for me. If you're American, try it, you will soon get used to the phrases and London terms!",1226361600,3,941,4.459302325581396
2879677,4,B000S2XD9U,"Even though it was reviewed by others in the UK and USA that the USA version has uncut episodes, this is infact wrong. Having ordered the USA complete collection. Have found some of the following things.
1. Yes it does contain all episodes including the last 3 in 2003 and all special hour long ones etc so you won't need to buy any other DVDS to get the official released versions.
2.  The episodes from the USA DVD set are cut and music changed.  Some noticeable bits include:-
a:-  Jolly boys outing,  7 mins cut just before they realise Raquel is on stage. (this includes how Boycie and trigger end up being in the same club as del and rodney watching the magic act with raquel... this where they talk while a singer is in the background singing and most annoying, you miss out on delboys great line ""the singer will be on in a minute"". once the singer has finished.
b.nightclub seen with rodney and cassandra where rodney asks cassandra to ance and chris De Burgh sony should be playing but it has been cut and another music track put over it and annoying, they have removed rodney / cassandras voice which is noticeable where she yes to the dance question from Rodney etc. you see lips moving but no voices. (due to them talking when chris de burgh sony started in original recording so they had to remove the voices also I guess. ) VERY ANNOYING
c. everytime Rodney sees Damien etc. some scenes and you hear the music (devils music or something like that), has been changed (eg. when damien born and rodney holds him etc etc.  Have replaced music with other music and is bad.
d. 1 thing which was added in and not cut I believe, on the hand gliding episode,  rodeny asks del over dinner with debbie I think was her name , Rodney asks Del  about the faulty timer on the sun bed, don't remember it in original episide, maybe wrong though.

just beaware,  we also had to pay 20 in customs duty when the DVDS arrived fro the USA  so with the episodes being cut, music changed,  customs to pay,  Is it worth buying this from the USA for a UK buyer,  would say no/",1225756800,8,2065,4.360313315926893
2879678,5,B000S2XD9U,"Only Fools and Horses achieves what only the best comedies can; it makes you care about what happens to the characters. Yes, this will make you laugh, but it also has the ability to make you cry. The acting is good and the writing gradually improves over the years as you come to know the characters.

The first few series are funny, but quite bleak in places. The characters don't have a great life. I found myself liking the characters a lot more as I got to know them.

This set includes all of the specials, so there is no need to buy them separately. I bought both by mistake and had to return the specials.

Some of the slang and British references might not mean much to people in the US, but I still think the series will make you laugh even if you miss some of the meaning.

Buy it at the incredible sale price. I have had this on my wish list for ages and don't regret snapping it up when the price fell to $117.",1223856000,,922,4.134078212290503

Although the US version is great value for money, it is cut much in the same way as the UK version.  Musical scores have been changed and scenes have been cut.  Ones i have found so far is a scene from yuppy love and the musical score at the end of time on our hands has changed from Crosby, Stills and Nash to a woman singing.  It is still excellent value for money and i would recommend it.  Hope this helps",1223769600,6,588,3.9914529914529915
2879680,5,B000S2XD9U,"The only episodes of only fools and horses this set doesn't contain are a few short one off's:

Christmas Trees
Licensed to Drill
White Mice
Royal Variety Show
The Robin Flies at Dawn
Comic Relief Special

All the specials such as Hull and Back, Dates, The Frog's Legacy, Royal Flush, Rodney Come Home, Jolly Boys Outing etc are included.

I nearly bought the English version untill I read the reviews and found that a lot of scenes are cut. The only scenes from The American set that are cut are in Jolly Boys Outing when Del and Rodney are eating scampi at the Mardi Gras club and there's a singer singing 'just the way you are'. This was cut due to contractual reasons.

Also in Watching the Girls Go By, the scene when Yvonne sings to del badly and del says 'Gordon Bennett, that's my bloody earhole' is cut.

Also Miami Twice is the movie version in this set (which I wasn't too fussed about)

Overall I'm really glad I got this set because the English has so many cuts because of words the BBC think people might get offended about. Plus it's a lot cheaper than the english set.

Even though you need to wait for a couple of weeks for it to be delivered (if you're in england) it is definately worth it. If you are from england and you're wondering which set to get, don't bother with the english one, if you don't mind waiting a few weeks buy the American DVD set.",1223424000,4,1371,4.33203125

So watch out!

This Complete Collection includes:
The Complete Series 1-3 (E1824)
The Complete Series 4-5 and the Specials (E2058)
The Complete Series 6 plus ""The Jolly Boys Outing"" (E2389)
The Complete Series 7 plus ""Rodney Come Home"" (E2689)
The Specials 1991-2003 (E4176)

Whenever I need to lift my spirits and have a good laugh, I watch a few episodes of this series.  (I also watch ""Hogan's Heroes"" for the same reason.)

This a great show.  If you do not like this show, you are a plonker!  LOL.

I still wonder who Gordon Bennett is.  LOL.

I have always been a great fan of Britcoms.",1216425600,7,560,3.9727272727272727
2879683,5,B000S2XD9U,"Originally written, as a comment, to thank one reviewer( David ) for his review. Copied and pasted here to add more information about this Great Show.

Thanks David for answering my quesion, although you may not have read my review and known you had answered it . I am glad to see all the Specials are included with the Set . If you haven't read my review , it has a complete list of episodes in the Comments Section and you can see if ALL the shows and Specials are included . The show began many years before 1991 and the Specials Set is from 1991-2003 . I don't know if you are familar with the show or have seen it before making your purchase, but there is a lot of talk in the Reviews on Amazon.co.uk about the Collection they sell in the UK being cut and scenes missing .  Some say they purchased the American version because there were no cuts or missing scenes . I wish you had commented on this, if you know, and still do if you happen to read this . Thanks again .
UPDATE: I have read that this version also contains cuts , such as music from ""Jolly Boy's Outing"" for instance . It would be aprox. several minutes cut because of the music not being paid for by the BBC. I can live with the cuts as long as it is only music and the occasional dialogue cut, however the fact that this Collection has gone up from aprox. $111.49 during Christmas to the present $157.99 will prevent me from making a purchase . At a time when the ecommony is so lousy, Amazon chooses to raise the price instead of leaving it at a reasonable price . Pure greed is the reason, nothing less . I hope no one buys it !!!
Last Update : I have access to all of the Episodes through a friend in the UK who has UKGold . OFandH is show on UKGOLD uncut and in it's original genious . They are great, and I only want a complete collection for the packaging to save in my Brirish Collection. I purchase most of my DVDs and Blu-Rays from the amazon.co.uk web site . Once you see one great British Comedy or Drama, such as OF&H , or Open All Hours and the many, many more you will discover , you will be hooked on them and want all you can get . One thing I noticed lately, while looking for DVDs on the British site, the OF&H Complete 1-7 collection, is said by one reviewer to be the original un-cut , un-edited versions we all want . Unlike the Complete Series they also have. This would be a good way to have, at least Series 1-7 the way it was intended, IF this is true . I don't know , and will try and find out . I have friends in the UK whom I have contact with through emails and Forums who will find out for me . I will get back to here later , and let everyone know. If anyone else finds out before me , please post it here and all have a Merry Christmas, or which other Season you celebrate .",1214870400,,2778,4.039927404718694
2879684,3,B000S2XD9U,"This set contains all episodes of OFAH, including the specials.  It is simply all the seperately available R1 series box sets packaged in a big box.  The disc packaging changes between Series 4-5 and Series 6 which makes it look a bit odd, but that's a minor point.  The episodes and specials are arranged in more-or-less chronological order throughout the set - not all the specials have their own seperate discs, which probably explains why this set has less physical discs than the UK version.

However, if, like me, your main reason for purchasing this set is that you get all the episodes of OFAH complete and uncut, then you're going to be disappointed.  I can only assume that those who have previously reviewed this set, proclaiming it to be original and uncut haven't yet watched all of it.

The edition of Miami Twice contained in this set is the same edition as released in the UK, i.e Part 1 (the TV episode) and Part 2 (The film - originally broadcast WITHOUT canned laughter) have been edited by chimps into ""Miami Twice - The Movie"", with bits cut out from the beginnings of the episodes and a new canned laughter track added over the film !

It surely must have cost more time and money to butcher it than just releasing the episodes as broadcast so why do it?  No doubt the BBC have some lame excuse about ""contractual reasons"".

Yes, this boxset is vastly superior to the pathetically poor UK offering, but there is still no complete uncut boxset of Only Fools and Horses to be had on VHS or DVD.

Given the quality of some DVD releases - Dr Who and Red Dwarf for example - this is sheer laziness and arrogance on the part of the BBC.  There is absolutely no excuse for this.

However, at present, this boxset is the best available, so if you have to get the complete boxset, go for this one.  Otherwise, I'd hang back and see if it goes the same way as the Star Wars Boxsets - ie re-issue after re-issue.  This is the BBC, after all, so it almost certainly will.",1214524800,61,1981,4.43646408839779
2879685,5,B000S2XD9U,"It always pays to do some research and it certainly paid off when buying Only Fools And Horses - The Complete Collection.

OFAH has been voted best British comedy of all time by the british public which is a measure of how popular it was and still is in the UK.  IMHO it rates against any of the other classic UK comedies such as Dads Army, Fawlty Towers, etc. as it stands the test of time.

My review is intended to point out the fact that there are different versions of the ""complete"" collection and to be careful which one you choose. There are a fair few reviews on the UK Amazon site which should explain more fully, but suffice to say that the UK version has a whole bunch of stuff taken out. It appears that the main two issues were ...

1) Additional costs (bunce) related to paying for the rights to certain pieces of music. This has led to whole scenes having completely different background music in them.

2) Certain words deemed to be OK in the original versions, are now considered to be too riskee for the political-correctness-gone-mad UK censor of today. The nanny state has finally taken over. Their solution was, rather than to bleep or disguise the word in some way (which would have been too obvious and still ruined it) instead to remove the whole scene!!! What a plonker!

Whichever way you slice it, they have ruined what was and still is (in its original form) a classic piece of UK comedy, that spans the decades and indeed the miles. But hold on I hear you say, why the five star review.

Mange-tout and pot-pouri, I got the SP that the original version in Region 1 (US) format is being knocked out by on the US Amazon website for a score less than in the UK. Lovely jubbly. Apparently the US citizen, unlike myself the UK citizen, has a mind of their own.

I'm only half way through watching but I haven't noticed anything missing. The only problem is that one of the episodes doesn't play well, but that is because of a dodgy disk, not because of an anally retentive censor.

Hope this helps any other OFAH fans avoid the disappointment of getting striped by the UK BBC.

This show was deservedly voted the best British sitcom ever. It may, however, be difficult for a US audience to understand. I bought it to send to my new American husband who is working overseas. When I asked how he liked it he admitted he was stuggling with the London accent and many of the unfamiliar slang words and phrases used. I think he'll fare better when he can watch it with me there to explain, but it's one of those things that if you stick at it you'll get the hang of it.
