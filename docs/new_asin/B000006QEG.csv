7904629,5,B000006QEG,"Her voice was heard through the Pacific enticing the soldiers and sailors of WWII to give up their fighting and fall into her arms. Dubbed ""Tokyo Rose"" by the American GI's the voice was the broadcast of over twenty Japanese women who were spilling out propoganda and music for the Japanese government. Tokyo Rose existed only in the imagination of the GI's.
  One voice, however, took on the identity of Tokyo Rose which would lead to suffering and heardship for its bearer. This is the story of that voice in the person of Iva Toguri who was tried as the traitor called Tokyo Rose.
  Born in the United States and assimilated into American ways Iva had the misfortune of being in the wrong place, at the wrong time, in the wrong war and the wrong race. A visit to Japan before the war (to help a relative) ended up in her being stranded in a country that she could not call her own. To survive she worked for the Japanese government as a clerk and went onto recording scripts to temper the morale of the GI's. Iva's naivite and the racism of the time placed in a tumultuous situation that would tear her family apart.
  Iva's story is the story of mass hysteria, the internment of United States citizens who happened to be Japanese and a woman caught in between two countries and cultures. Watching what happened during that period shows us the manipulation of forces that needed a scape goat. Tokyo Rose is America's shameful example of what a country will do to its own citizens because of their race. This video is a remarkable chronicle of the hysteria of the time and a woman's refusal to allow herself to be defeated. This is an excellent video that has social and political meaning for those who are study post WWII. I highly encourage you to witness to the power of this film.",972518400,7,1786,4.513931888544891
