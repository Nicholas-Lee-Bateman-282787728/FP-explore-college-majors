8410374,5,B00005RHML,"I'm rating this 5 Stars because I love the series anyway and the movies and discs are in great shape. However be warned that it comes with ""Operation Meteor"" discs but they are only in Japanese while the OVA and Endless Waltz can be put in the United States English Dub. Not what I expected when I bought this but that's okay.",1526688000,,326,4.274193548387097
8410375,5,B00005RHML,The OVAS have always been subbed never dubbed and the Movie is the only thing that is Dubbed duh! Its quality is Superb and the movie looks Amazing and is also special edition with extra footage! the price may seem a bit much 40$ but its worth it for the standard 4 disc blueray editon. I know that the Collectors edition comes with special features so you must choose wisely and not complain your getting the standard which is Great for what it is! enjoy!,1526256000,,456,4.376470588235295

8410377,3,B00005RHML,"Love the movie love the OVA but in my view there are couple problems with this particular product.  I got excited about this because the Operation Meteor part was advertised as a prequel, its not.  Its simply a recap of the Gundam Wing series, & there is no English dub to it as well which seems really stupid considering its just a recap.  Another issue I have is on the movie the default audio is not English although this is a region 1/2 product.  So every time you want to watch the movie you have to go into the settings section and change the language, every time.  I own the 2001 special edition on DVD and that product never has that problem.  This isn't worth it for the price, so happy that I rented it from my local library instead of dishing out 40.00 dollars for it!",1517097600,5,779,4.26530612244898
8410378,3,B00005RHML,"I love this movie. I've probably seen it 50 times. Quality was great. Picture and audio at very nice. However, I'm disappointed with what I got for the amount I paid and with the special features. I was hoping for some behind the scenes or director interviews, but there was none of that. Instead I got the ""never before seen"" operation meteor episodes which are just compilation episodes of each gundam pilot. Having both the movie and OVA versions is nice, but I don't think it's worth the $35 I paid. I think $20 would be a fair price.

Also the text on the back is this dark green that's hard to read against the black background. I bought this thinking it would be a collectors edition, but it seems like there wasn't a lot of care put into it.",1514937600,7,749,4.35
8410379,3,B00005RHML,"The package on this lists English on the discs, expect the OVA on the Endless Waltz.  There is no English dub on Operation Meteor Discs 1 and 2.  Only English Sub titles. The only English dub is on the Endless Waltz movie disc.",1514160000,10,227,4.255813953488372
8410380,5,B00005RHML,Gundam Wing was and still is the most bad-ass Gundam series where they just displayed unlimited raw power. And this Special was a great way to tie things up.,1431734400,,157,4.448275862068965
