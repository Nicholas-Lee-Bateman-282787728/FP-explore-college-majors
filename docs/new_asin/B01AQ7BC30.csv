8748021,5,B01AQ7BC30,A terrific documentary on the impact of a very important 20th century architect.,1463702400,,80,5.230769230769231
8748022,5,B01AQ7BC30,"Maybe you gotta love the history of architecture, but this one is fun and worth watching to see one man's success, not just building decorations and styles in the desert.  The title is apt.  A late aunt of mine lived there and loved it.",1462579200,,236,4.340909090909091
8748023,5,B01AQ7BC30,"This superb film is indeed a history of the glass and beam architecture of the late William F. Cody but it is also the history of Palm Springs. The two are seemingly inseparable. Cody's signature work put to rest any Spanish-architecture look that The Springs may have had in its early days. He replaced it with an extraordinary design style that integrates man and desert so superbly.  Fabulously-shot footage and archival stills take you inside homes, restaurants and hotels that bear the Cody imprimatur. Critics and colleagues alike introduce us to both man and legacy.  Europe may have a wide variety of building styles but Mr. Cody has certainly defined something uniquely appropriate for the heat, barrenness and stunning mountain landscapes that make Palm Springs a special place in this country. Like all great stories, there is an element of sadness that turns up...a number of Mr. Cody's amazing structures were razed ""to make way for the future"". Pity. Mr. Cody designed a timeless future all his own and a lot of it shines brightly today as a testimony to his vision. In watching this film, you appreciate and celebrate the past. Fortunately,  it's still here today and will be around, hopefully, for a long time. This homage certainly made me want to go to Palms Springs just to look at the place from a new perspective!  Every university school of architecture should make this film a ""must-watch.""",1458086400,,1413,4.92436974789916
8748024,5,B01AQ7BC30,"This is a fine, well made, and insightfully revealing film, and it shows in every technical aspect and personal touch of the work. The professionalism of its direction, editing, camerawork, and production quality are appreciably above those of almost all other films about architects, their craft, and buildings. The interviews and architecture are intercut to illustrate and illuminate each other, providing analytic or personal understanding. This film parallels the artistry and craftsmanship of its subject William Cody.",1457136000,,524,5.818181818181818

As seen in the context of the post WWII era of development of Palm Springs as the desert playground for the rich and famous this is a fascinating history of a unique time and place and Cody's role in it all. Use of music is perfectly chosen. The modernism of jazz of the 50's combined with great cinematography create the feel of that era.",1455840000,,812,7.836956521739131
