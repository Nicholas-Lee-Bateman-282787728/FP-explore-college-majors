If you are looking for a sex and violence fix, this  is not it (that's easy enough to find elsewhere), but it provides rewards  of its own.  There are not that many out there that you can show to a mixed  audience of kids and adults and keep them all engaged, but this is one that  can (my wife and I have 95 years of mortal life and 19 years of college  between us, and it kept our attention).
  In the very opening scenes  the degree to which the scenery and clothing puts you in the right time  machine in the Bronze Age was striking.  It only got better later on, from  the ship itself to the soldier's swords, even the style of the beards and  crowns the kings wear.  The scene shifts from Olympus to earth are  imaginative and powerful, and the non-human characters, from monsters to  gods, are inventive and convincing.
  The dialog is not always  inspired, but the characters keep your attention with what they are given,  and enough plays upon their faces that you don't rally notice.  Some of  their most powerful moments are wordless anyway, from Jason's exhaustion  after his test to Medea's anguish when she thinks he has been killed trying  to get the golden fleece from the dragon.  The story ends when the  quest is completed, so Medea's bloody revenge as a dishonored princess is  not included, but that would be another story anyway.  It is a good telling  of the ancient epic, taking no more liberties with the plot than is  allowable for genuine folklore, with a nod or two toward issues in our own  society, yes, but still centering on the ageless concerns of what makes a  hero -- from a prince favored by a deity (but resented by another) to an  ugly thief (for whom an act of selfless integrity may also take herculian  effort); the dilemmas of loyalty in love and deadly risks -- from a common  soldier to a gifted princess; the temptations of power -- in an ageless  Olympian god who can bless, or destroy at a whim if he lashes out in anger,  to corrupted mortal kings and princes.  If this one doesn't give you images  you will want to savor in your mind, and some ideas on how to relate to  basic human issues in the news, whether it's to talk to your kids or  chuckle with your best friend (my wife, in my case), you're not trying.",968284800,7,2361,4.368055555555555
