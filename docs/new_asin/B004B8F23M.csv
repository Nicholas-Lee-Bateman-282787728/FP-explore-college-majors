Dragon Ball Z: The Saga of Frieza Vol. 7 that we know is sorta misleading on DVD Title name, but I knew the whole time that the episodes are actually from the first season (Vegeta Saga/Saiyan Story).

This volume contains episodes 25 to 28 in both Italian and Japanese with Italian subtitles, but it doesn't have next episode previews.
On the top of all these TV releases, the Italian dub always have this annoying PAL 50Hz flaw where the audio tempo's semitone is +0.75 higher than normal because it also happened on Italian broadcast but that doesn't even happen with their movie dubs.
That still persists if you watch the Japanese version on these Italian DVDs, same thing also happened in French and German dubs.",1444780800,,839,4.8671328671328675
