6474539,5,B00L8QP0XM,"I purchased this only for ""Bates Motel"" as I already own the sequels to Psycho.

Psycho 2- a worthy follow up to Psycho, although not quite as great. It's worth noting that they never try to re-do (or impossibly out-do) the original, instead they build upon the originals mythology and try to create another suspense story. This is easily the best of the sequels.

Psycho 3- Worth watching for some insane sequences and odd characters. This movie is certainly engaging enough to keep you entertained through out. This doesn't really add anything to the series and it seems pretty far away from the original, but there are definitely worse sequels to horror movies out there...

Psycho 4 - Just avoid this one all together unless you are a completest. Some fascinating scenes, but if you want a more interesting back story watch the A&E series with Freddie Highmore.

Bates Motel- This is the reason I purchased the collection. You can see why this television movie had a very short life.",1421020800,2,987,4.788235294117647
6474540,5,B00L8QP0XM,"Another great collection. Fine quality and loved watching these films. The first and the third are my favorites. But I am a fan of some of the stars in the second movie too, so I enjoy that one to. I have seen these about 3-4 times on VHS previously. The last one called Bates motel was stupid and shouldn't even have been put to film....they wasted the film on it. But I think Anthony Perkins never approved of that going to film either.",1416009600,10,438,4.289156626506024
6474541,2,B00L8QP0XM,Do not buy 4-Movie Midnight Marathon Pack: Psychos. All four movies are on one disc. The movies have heavy compression artifacts.,1411862400,8,129,5.190476190476191

6474543,4,B00L8QP0XM,"While Bates Motel isn't exactly high art, it's nice to see its inclusion here.

While it's true Perkins was no fan, and wanted nothing to do with it (he slated it during interviews at least one), it has nothing to do with his agreement to Psycho IV. At the time, he was aware of his condition (HIV) so agreed to star in many movies in an attempt to provide for his family once he was gone. This includes I'm Dangerous Tonight, In the Deep Woods, A Demon in my View and his last role in The Naked Target. He was very well aware of the quality of these movies, but it was all the work he could get. Once his condition was public, getting insurance on-set was tricky as there was the likelihood of not living through completion.

Psycho II and III are both good in their own way. For a sequel to the classic Psycho, Psycho II does remarkably well. III is more of a slasher movie (the gore was amped up by Universal to compete with the Friday the 13th's and Halloween's) but with references to other Hitchcock movies and some assured direction (note the transition between Maureen's hospital room and Mother's bedroom) it's actually rather good. Psycho IV was made for Showtime (on a new set) with a screenplay by Joseph Stefano (Psycho). In that regards, it's a lot better than it could have been (despite some continuity issues between the 2 movies), and Perkins is on form as always.

Of interest, Kurt Paul; a long time friend of Perkins, was a stand-in on Psycho II and III, appeared as Norman Bates in Bates Motel and played Raymond in Psycho IV.

In regards to Marlowe's comment, yes, having Bates Motel pictured third would make sense in a production order line-up. But as it ignores Psycho II and III, story wise it makes no difference when you watch it. It's like the Halloween franchise. it's either Psycho, Psycho II, Psycho III and Psycho IV The Beginning, or it's Psycho and Bates Motel.",1407974400,26,1897,4.505813953488372
6474544,4,B00L8QP0XM,"These films (in the ""Psycho"" series) have been available on DVD from Universal for years, and I'm certain that this is just a repackaging of the same transfers. However, the one new to DVD addition is the premiere of the 1987 TV movie, ""Bates Motel"", (not to be confused with the current series), that stars Bud Cort. It is rather astonishing that Universal has included it here, as Anthony Perkins himself HATED and was solemnly against that TV movie. Legend has it that Perkins only agreed to ""Psycho IV"" for Showtime in 1990 because he wanted to discredit the 1987 TV movie as even being part of the ""Psycho"" series. He was very much against it being made, and even tried to stop it from airing. He did the fourth film because the ""Bates Motel"" movie is supposed to be happening after the events of ""Psycho III"", and Perkins did ""Psycho IV"" because, with himself included in it, it is more of an ""official"", direct sequel, and excludes anything that happened in the TV movie, thus making it not part of the ""official series"".

  Shout! Factory recently re-issued ""Psycho II"" and ""Psycho III"" on very nice blu rays, and have said that Universal had very specific requests in handling the films, as they are very protective of the films, even insisting that the classic poster art be used as the covers, rather than newly commissioned artwork.

  Yet here goes Universal now, re-issuing the ""Psycho II-IV"" DVDs with the film included that Perkins was completely against. Not so protective, after all.

  Perkins would NOT approve.

As for the films themselves, obviously the Hitchcock original (not included here) is a classic for all time; ""Psycho II"" and ""Psycho II"" took beatings from the critics at the time of their release, but time has been kind to them. And now, they seem like pretty good films in their own right. ""Psycho IV"", however, mainly serves as a ""prequel"" to the original film (and actually works on that level), but the ""sequel"" elements (involving Perkins) are terribly executed, requiring a suspension of disbelief that is just TOO unbearable.

 And ""Bates Motel"" is an absolute atrocity.",1405987200,10,2111,4.8171745152354575

8664363,4,B00L8QP0XM,"Psycho: 4-Movie Pack

This product has four movies starting with the 1959 movie Psycho from Alfred Hitchcock. It was a big hit but seems tame by later standards. The carefully edited scenes suggested more than what you saw. One scary part was the sound of a knife blade piercing flesh. But a butcher knife is designed for cutting or slashing, it lacks a hilt to prevent the wielders hand from sliding down the sharp blade and getting cut. Why would a horror film be so successful? Some say a recession or depression creates a market for horror films (as with the current Great Recession). These films feature Anthony Perkins who plays a crazy maniac very well. The first movie mentioned the new highway bypassed the motel and caused a loss of customers. Does poverty cause an increase of violence, crime, and mental illness? Are there benefits from these changes? See the individual reviews for more details.

Psycho from 1959 was from a short story based on a true crime. Marion Crane takes a large sum of money and goes on a long drive then stops at a motel for the night. [Note how she has white underwear before the theft but black underwear afterwards!] Is the motel manager a nice young man who obeys his mother? A private investigator tries to locate the missing money and visits the Bates Motel. Sister Lila and boyfriend Sam try to find Marion. The good guys win in the end. A psychiatrist explains this story. Are there other missing persons?

Psycho II from 1983 shows Norman Bates released from a state hospital because his psychiatrist says he is cured. [No mention of politics cutting the budget so inmates are released earlier, or the use of drugs to control his condition.] Will Norman still obey his mother?

Psycho III from 1986 shows Norman Bates again returning home after many years. Not much has changed, for better or worse. They show parts of older movies as a reminder. You know what is going to happen, but there will be one or two surprises. Note how people who do wrong wind up getting killed, like in some classic mystery novels.

Psycho IV from 1990 shows the historical background to Norman Bates madness. This is by far the worst of the series, as if they ran out of ideas or were on a lower budget. No mention of the local voters or any control over a dangerous house.",1507680000,,2301,4.602439024390244
