8298294,3,B001EIAMPU,"It's interesting to watch a film about Falco - to most people - including myself - outside the Euro zone he's an 80s near one hit wonder. I don't think his music was great either, but it beats hearing Let's Dance and other dance songs by Bowie who inspired him. I thought the acting by Rubey as Falco was plain ridiculous and cheap - which is the norm for not only Hollywood but actors everywhere. He mistook Falco's sauve style for arrogance and that's how he plays him. Truly cliched young liberal actor going over the top in an attempt to imitate what a musician is like. The movie is also filled with sex drugs troubled artist cliches and is almost one dimensional in that respect. Anyone can seem like an arrogant prique, but nowhere did you see Falco do that. There's so much bad film making and acting around. The directing and scenes are also cliched 'art' movie Kerrap. This is for people who love Falco and or perhaps want a trip down memory lane - the movie is like all the old rock star rise and fall rubbish.",1390694400,,1021,4.378947368421053
