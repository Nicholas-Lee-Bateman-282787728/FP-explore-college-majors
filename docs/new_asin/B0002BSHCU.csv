8025732,5,B0002BSHCU,I'd like to visit there someday.  This dream would be great kick for 77 years old man to live longer.,1388534400,,101,4.05
8025733,5,B0002BSHCU,"We study Argentina in my Spanish class. This video shows so much of this wonderful country and includes a variety of landscapes. The music and fast pace make this DVD very entertaining and easy to watch. Excellent DVD copy, professionally made!",1332720000,3,244,4.975609756097561
8025734,3,B0002BSHCU,I am in love with Iguazu Falls and the photo on the cover led me to think the video would devote some time to the falls.  Only seconds were on the falls but I did enjoy other parts of the video which covered places I hadn't been.,1235606400,,229,3.872340425531915
8025735,1,B0002BSHCU,"I bought this DVD as a gift for my parents, hoping to entice them to visit my us after we move to Argentina this summer. I was surprised when they told me that the show had completely turned their stomachs with vivid portrayals of killing and gutting a cow, ripping off it's hide and opening the stomach to show what's inside. The host also brands a cow, and you hear it moaning as you watch her, in shock, asking herself WHY she had ever agreed to do such a thing. I think this would be a fine video to watch for ""documentary"" entertainment, but if you are trying to convince the average 70 year old traveler (or anyone who is not gung-ho on livestock) to go to Argentina for a holiday, this is NOT the DVD to choose! We're going to look for another, more ""travel-friendly"" program to show to the rest of the family instead.",1215561600,2,825,4.294871794871795
8025736,2,B0002BSHCU,"This video was made before 2001 and the economic crash, so they keep talking about how expensive it all is. Not up to date at all. They need to make a new one. However, they do highlight great things to do.",1191974400,,206,4.048780487804878
8025737,5,B0002BSHCU,"Seeing this Globtrekker travelogue again on TV reminded me of how well it portrays the beauty and immense scale of this amazing country.  It also superbly communicates the warmth and generosity of its people.  Disregard another reviewer's grousings about the economic inaccuracies (yeah, so what?--it's actually much cheaper now to visit Argentina), and just sit back and enjoy sweeping views of Iguasu Falls, the Argentine cordillera, windswept Patagonia, and the Perito Moreno glacier.  Justine Shapiro has just the right balance of wonder and wimsy to pull off this travelogue.  I especially like her good-humored response to a pass made at her in Buenos Aires, and her imitation of a penguin walk on the beach in Patagonia.  This is a real fun video and will make you want to visit this great country.",1159401600,18,805,5.068181818181818
8025738,5,B0002BSHCU,"Justine Shapiro is really charming and made me laugh in several instances. This video is superbly shot, and even myself, as a local argentine, found it entertaining and informative.

The reviewer before me was too harsh to give it a single star. Just discard any references you hear on the video about prices (for that, look around in travel web sites, and ANYTHING taped will get outdated over time).

Yes, this video was shot back in ~2000 when the country's currency, the peso, was artificially pegged to the US dollar, and neocons were running the country, overvaluating our currency (which as you might imagine caused the exports of anything almost impossible, as everything was cheaper imported rather than locally produced).

After the sad events of late 2001 and early 2002, the local currency was devaluated and that artificial economic policy of ""1 peso to 1 dollar"" was abandoned. After a brieg period of chaos, the country started recovering and now (2005/2006) exports are booming, job creation is on the rise, tourism is booming, and exports (both agriculture and industrial) are at an all time high. Plenty of factories have re-opened its doors and in some sectors of the economy employers are having a hard time finding people for the positions.

(...) the peso is now at around $3 pesos per US dollar. (...)

(...)
Hope this helps.",1138579200,11,1348,4.920704845814978
8025739,1,B0002BSHCU,"This DVD is dated as a 2004 release and maybe the DVD was released then but the video was defintely filmed at least five years earlier.

The video is not very helpful and full of false information about the country, particularly the  cost of traveling. Justine Shapiro states that it is VERY VERY EXPENSIVE to travel in Argenitna. It was back then when the video was made, mostly  in 1997, but now after the devaluation in 2001 Argentina is considered one of the most inexpensive travel destination in the world.

It was shot in 2004 and contains the latest information for tourists, such as the CURRENT price of hotels, food, etc.

If you are interested in visiting Argentina and really want to know how it is NOW I recommend you consider the ""Best of Buenos Aires"" video on Amazon.",1099008000,21,783,4.60431654676259
