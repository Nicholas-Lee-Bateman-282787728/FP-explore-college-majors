2230242,5,1581334893,Great instructional DVD set especially for those counter attack enthusiasts,1407801600,,75,6.6
2230243,5,1581334893,"I first found out about the DVD from the cover article Black Belt Magazine did on Yamaki Sensei a few months back. Gives fighting combinations coming off counters, feints, evasions, etc.  Very useful for jiyu kumite (freestyle sparring) or self-defense.  There is also a section on conditioning, kicking drills, stretches, and introductory lesson/demo on the vertical kick, which is unique to kyokushin karate.

Disclaimer: Since this is geared towards jiyu kumite, and jiyu kumite is by nature an advanced form of karate sparring, I would recommend this for advanced students and instructors only.  Yamaki Sensei does go over the techniques slowly at first, but overall he tends to show you the moves a few times and moves on to the next combination. Not a lot of time spent on details, so it's best to have a solid understanding of basics before you get into these. In short, this is great for brown belts and above, may be a bit much for lower ranked belts.",1405987200,4,960,4.835365853658536

2230249,4,1581334893,Not a bad DVD overall. Covers many aspects of Kyokushin techniques with some of his own favorites.

8050178,5,1581334893,"I have studied this video and incorporated the techniques in my classes.  Kenji Yamaki is truly an inspiration and talks about being bullied as a child, wanting to harm himself, hurting those who bullied him, but then realizing thru Kyokushin karate that he should be above revenge.  I shared this video with some students and it has furthered their desire to train in Kyokushin.
