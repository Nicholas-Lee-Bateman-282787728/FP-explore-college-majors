8321982,3,B000062XI9,"A young Tibetian monk is sent on a quest to recover and reunite the pieces of a sacred artifact.  He faces opponents seeking the power of the completed artifact, and has to contend with sorcery, mobsters and many challenges.  Jackie Chan only gives a cameo appearance, but the film is enjoyable in a way similar to many of Jackie Chan's early films.  It was directed and acted by Yuen Biao - one of Jackie Chan's friends who studied in the Peiking Opera alongside him.",1197936000,,468,4.5476190476190474
