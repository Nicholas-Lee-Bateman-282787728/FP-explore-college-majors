8736147,3,B016AWZFEW,The storyline was great but the acting wasn't up to par for this to be a great movie. It wasn't very professional. I was thinking that I would have enjoyed it better reading it in a novel compared to the acting. I wish that I rented it before I purchased it.,1458864000,,258,4.078431372549019
