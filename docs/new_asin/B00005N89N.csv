I received the movie in the condition mentioned and on a timely fashion.",1230422400,,134,4.1923076923076925
1628698,5,B00005N89N,"The essence of this movie, ""Heart of Dixie"", is so real as to what Southern Colleges were like, I know, in Mississippi...especially Ole Miss which seems to be the true Institution this movie is based on...the Integration of James Meredith...the first Black student to be forced in to an ALL White University in Mississippi.  These facts were common gossip and total knowledge of the inhabitants of the State of Mississippi even more than it made NEWS all over the USA (and I'm sure the World).

As a former student at Ole Miss, I can believe the reality of what the Fraternities and Sororities were like in RULING the University.  Sudents who didn't belong to these Organizations were considered of little importance; and the leading Fraternities and Sororities probably weren't much different at that time than as depicted in this movie.

These Clubs as well as Football ruled the University.

For these reasons I found the movie like a trip back in time as to what the University would have been back in that time...10 years before my residence there.

So my impression is that this movie leads to the Realistic ""story"" of the Integration of Ole Miss by James Meredith.

I really got into the concept of what really went on there at that time in History.

Hopefully my Review will cause no more controvery; but it's my truth.

If you want some very realistic concept of what life was like for the Southern Arristocracy in 1960, you will surely enjoy this movie.",1202083200,18,1463,4.75098814229249
1628699,3,B00005N89N,"Life was good in the Fifties.  This is a down side to the musical, ""Grease,"" but it is based in Alabama at Randolph University, about a group of soroity girls having a good time.  They used original records for the background and there was a good Elvis imitator doing 'Blue Suede Shoes' who lip sinc-ed the song.  The girls looked so young that, at first, I thought they were high school kids.  The wide green plastic belt was a little much, not 50s.

When they gathered in their meeting room to discuss the Honeysuckle Ball, it was a scene right out of my past as we used to be called for an evening with the dorm mother at Tennessee Hall girls' dorm in Pulaski.  Their contestant won as the Honeysucle Queen, a blonde Kim Novak clone.  The boys at the dance were dressed in gray uniforms as Confederate soldiers, and the beloved flag was in evidence.  The Queen, though blondes are not noted for their intelligence, had a good quote: ""If you betray that which you say you love, you betray yourself.""  The students were polite and uninvolved, with Southern gentility.

The dark-haired girl journalist fell hard for the UP photographer (he was a young George Nader) who influenced her articles, like I did my deejay.  Funny thing is, I had another who played 'Good Night, Sweetheart' for me every midnight and took me out in his new motorboat as we traveled in his new car, who was proud of me as I was; neither tried to change me.  We went for coffee at mignight before I left for college the next morning.  Both accepted me as platonically but I loved B. Ross and not B. Brown,  Her blonde boyfriend was a loser and was no match for a strong, independent Southern non-belle.  It was more than a disagreement, and she felt that there's nothing left to fix.

She went over to the wrong side of the tracks for her article (""This is really good, wish I had written it."") and was advised that ""This ain't your business"", but it's still going on.  At a bus meeting, I was informed that ""we have not overcome"" some sixty years later.  That was news to me; they are the ones with attitude, chips on their shoulders since the LBJ legacy of the Sixties.  Before that, they knew their place.  They pray to Martin Luther King, Jr. (who had urged them to boycott the buses) and the Jesus of Egypt, not the one in Heaven. You ain't seen nothing yet.

At the corner of Magnolia and Tulip Streets there in Montgomery (like East Knoxville), the civil rights were forced.  How can anything good be forced.  Randolph became a battlefield, all for one unwanted student, LBJ's stupidity and ignorance created a monster. You have power to set the right expectations. Leave old anger behind you. Forgive and even if you don't quite forget. James Garfield said, ""If there is one thing upon this earth that mankind love and admire better than another, it is a brave man, -- it is the man who dares to look the devil in the face and tell him he is a devil.""

It was a happy ending with ""You go get 'em, girl!"" as the journalist leaves that school for New York after she refused to apologize to one of the teachers.  That almost happened to me at Central High.  She had no choice as she was falsely determined to be other than she was.  ""I'll never forget you, I Swear I never will"" she hears from the Prom Queen to whom she bequeathed her former boyfriend. No, this was no Harper Lee who ""killed a mockingbird.""",1160352000,,3387,4.429725363489499
1628700,4,B00005N89N,"I happen to like all of the main actors in this film: Ally Sheedy, Phoebe Cates, Virginia Madsen and Treet Williams. If you like them, too, perhaps you'll like this movie.

Sure, Heart of Dixie has its flaws.  I won't argue with the previous reviewer, other than to say that a one-star rating is awfully harsh.

This is not a civil rights movie in the way that Ghosts of Mississippi or Mississippi Burning is a civil rights movie.  It's more a coming of age story. I enjoyed watching Ally Sheedy's character learn who she is and what she wants to become.

Yep, Heart of Dixie is lightweight.  Yep, it could have been done better.

And still, I like it.",1153699200,22,652,4.428571428571429

7946355,5,B00005N89N,"The story of Alabama aristocracy in the 1950s should be known, especially these days with the rise of the Neo-Confederacy and Neo-Racism becoming such a problem. The story of conscientious Southerners who sympathized with the plight of black people in the 1950s when the Civil Rights movement was in its first stages is important to know. Ally Sheedy and Treat Williams play such conscientious people, who simply cannot abide by the status quo, and recognize the wrongness of Southern white traditions and attitudes. This is a must-see movie.",1442448000,2,542,5.170454545454546

7946358,2,B00005N89N,"movie was ok. some of the actresses were way over their heads like when Virginia says 'hold on did i miss sumthing? was i not elected to b miss honeysuckle queen' it was hard not to keep a straight face and Sheedy has never been able to carry off a role stronger than her 'detached' character from Breakfast Club. when she's with Treat it painfully shows her overacting and its distracting with her honey suckle rose sweet alabama tone, ugh! so if u can get from the library and have nothing else to watch then maybe but i guarantee you will b wondering what other movie you could be watching lol",1360454400,,596,4.378378378378378
7946359,5,B00005N89N,I have watched this movie many times through the years and enjoy it every time. Gives a better understanding to how it was in the South during those years.,1357257600,2,155,4.379310344827586
7946360,1,B00005N89N,"I guess I should be grateful that I read the book that this film was (supposedly) based on before seeing the movie--otherwise I wouldn't have bothered to read a novel that stands as one of my favorite books of all time.  The novel is by Anne Rivers Siddons, and the correct title is ""Heartbreak Hotel""--unfortunately, another movie was released in that same year under that title, so this one was changed.  The only thing this film has in common with the novel is the time period and a few of the names of the main characters were used.  Other than that, the author was robbed--not sure what the writers and director were trying to do here, but they failed miserably and I have rarely been more disappointed in a movie.  Read the book--even after so many years, I still reread it periodically and find myself enthralled every time.",1348704000,2,831,4.594594594594595
7946361,5,B00005N89N,"Yes, it's a lightweight when it comes to a heavyweight issue like civil rights. However, I love the contrast of the unrealistic prep world compared to the real issues happening in the 1950's. ""Maggie"" has been brought up in a dream world of the well to do and as a senior in college she starts to wake up to the harsh realities of life. It's well worth watching in my book.",1295654400,6,373,4.267605633802817
