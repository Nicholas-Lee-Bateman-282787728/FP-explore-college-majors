8328481,5,B001NZ9SNG,i got this to help my children get into face painting.  They love halloween and they are now old enough to start working with paint by themselves. i don't like them on youtube by themselves becuase you never know what rabbit hole they may end up down.  This video is great it has lots of information that has help them become much better at face painting and i also learned a few tips and tricks that i didn't know.  You need good paint and good brushes to start but as soon as you get those i say purchase this video. You will learn thinks here that you cant get anywhere else. Face painting isn't just for halloween either. We set up at fairs and everyone loves it at my kids birthdays.,1474675200,,688,4.236641221374046
8328482,5,B001NZ9SNG,"Bought this for our kid's Halloween party just the other week and my wife and sister in law had fun recreating some of these classics. The kids loved it, the adults had fun seeing the faces and masks come to life and all in all it was a most enjoyable night. Love the simple face painting techniques covered, the step by step instructions are so easy to follow, and it's quite easy to achieve the looks that are demonstrated in the DVD. With 8 different face painting designs, we had just enough for everyone to have their own design. So great!",1415491200,,544,4.396039603960396
