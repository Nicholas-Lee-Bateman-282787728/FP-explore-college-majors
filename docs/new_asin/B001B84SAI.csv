8401811,4,B001B84SAI,"A basic conjunction of themes that bring together our lives today in the west.
Although the movie is in French the narrative is easy to follow with subtitles.",1400025600,,158,4.678571428571429
8401812,5,B001B84SAI,"Visually beautiful, emotionally rich drama set in post World War I France.  An idealistic young woman (Laetitia Casta) joins forces with a simple-minded hermit (Stefano Accorsi) in an attempt to save the last remaining wolves in France from the superstitious peasantry and greedy land developers.  This an exciting and suspenseful movie that is also a touching plea to care for the natural world we humans have inherited.

The cast is fine, with the standout being Italian film star Accorsi, who turns in a terrific performance as the half-witted (or so the villagers think) young man.  Accorsi is at times touching in his simplicity, at other times menacing.  The chemistry between him and Casta is superb.

This is stunningly photographed movie.  But then how could a film shot in the glorious French Alps be anything else?  The production values are right on target.  Apart from some rather gory scenes of the wolves being slaughtered, there really isn't much that is objectionable, even for children.

This is yet another example of a foreign-language film that definitely should be picked up by an American distributor.  It should be available to viewers who don't have access to a player that can handle PAL format DVDs.  Let's get with it Americans!",1318204800,,1256,5.043689320388349
8401813,4,B001B84SAI,"I just saw part of this definitely Euro-zone made flick in Sydney, Aus and enjoyed it.  The flashback scene of ""La Mamma"" dancing (and more) with the wolf is so full of Freudian implications....well done.  This film should be better known, but it is definately full of material that'll last film geeks for a generation or two.",1309392000,,326,4.701754385964913
8401814,5,B001B84SAI,"I happened to catch the last 20 or 30 minutes of this film on TV and was so hooked I just had to purchase and see the whole film.

Really cannot understand why this 2008 movie did not receive heaps of awards or was not lauded more internationally...perhaps because the DVD cover and all the extras are in french (there are subtitles in english).

Set in the French Alps in the early 20th Century, this adult drama tells the unusual tale of a young girl who rescues a wolf cub, only for the same wolf to save her life many years later.  Rich characterisations, a wonderful plot and beautifully filmed this movie is a feast for adults and children of all ages.

In the age of a modern industrial europe, this is dramatic  wilderness story-telling at it's best.

I loved it!",1278806400,,771,4.432624113475177
8401815,3,B001B84SAI,"I'd been wanting to see this film for some time and was pleased to finally get an NTSC copy on a region 1 disc.

The overall image quality was fine when upconverted on a Blu-ray player (though the titles looked like digitized garbage overall)and the sound was also fine.

My only real problem with the disc, and it's a biggie, is that for a region 1, NTSC disc, there is no option for English subtitles!

Now the film's not that complicated and I'm a massive fan of Laetitia Casta, so I followed it all pretty well (even though I can count the number of words I know in French on one hand), but I imagine it would have impressed me that much more if I could have followed along with subtitles, particularly at the end.

The photography is outstanding,the music is nicely lyrical, and all the performances (including Ms. Casta's...don't listen to the naysayers!) were all very well done so if you're fluent in French I'd say don't miss it.  If not, well...maybe you should wait for a subbed version to come out on Blu.",1277683200,,1017,4.475675675675675
