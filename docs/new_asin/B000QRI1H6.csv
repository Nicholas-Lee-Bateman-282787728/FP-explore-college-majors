Bronson as captain jack is memorable",1412121600,,265,5.575
2839927,4,B000QRI1H6,"Good old Alan Ladd Western which just recently came out on DVD and I recommend it to anyone whom collects his movies; not his best, but entertaining.  He is appointed as peace commissioner by President Grant and sent out to deal with the renegade Modoc Indian chief, Captain Jack, played by Charles Bronson in his first major role.  Doesn't work out as Captain Jack wants war, so Ladd has to fight the Indians and capture the chief...lots of action of course.",1411862400,3,459,4.654320987654321
2839928,5,B000QRI1H6,"I saw this movie as a young person, and I remember reading the stories about the Modoc war. It is somewhat authentic and well acted. Alan Ladd was always fun to watch. Charles Bronson in his first movie gives a very dynamic portrayal of Captain Jack. Bronson showed the promise of a rugged actor and previews of many good things to come.",1410739200,7,337,4.451612903225806
2839929,4,B000QRI1H6,"""Drum Beat"" has Alan Ladd and Charles Bronson, Marisa Pavan and others of note, but this film punishes the bad Indian, Capt. Jack, for wanting the Lost Valley which belongs to the Modoc Indians anyway. I loved the ending when Bronson says that his ""heaven will have no white people there."" I couldn't help but cheer. Ladd is very good as always, but I think it was time, after ""Broken Arrow<"" to stop giving the white folks the Hollywood Seal of Approval, which forces Ladd to give a wooden performance..how can he say with a straight face that the ""treaties will be honored?""

beautifully photographed in lavish CinemaScope, a great process with curved screens, not f;at ones, and an excellent Marisa Pavan, who loves Ladd's character but is ditched for Audrey Dalton, placid to the point of genius and very white. Pavan mentions to Ladd that she is ""dark, not acceptable.""  A good point in the film to ;push the racist issue as was done in ""Broken Arrow."":

In any case, see it.",1409702400,3,980,4.6531791907514455
2839930,5,B000QRI1H6,"We all have our favourites...this is one of mine. Beautifully photographed on spectacular locations (Arizona?) the Cinemascope print from Warner Archive hits the spot. Excellent colour clear picture and good sound. Music is classic ""Western"" from Victor Young. Ladd is good if a bit one dimensional, and the support cast is first rate. Charles Bronson steals the film as ""Captain Jack"" and really proves he can act as well as look incredibly hard. Marisa Pavan makes a splendid ""Indian Maid"", and the usual ""Indian"" actors are great - Rodolpho Acosta/Tony Caruso/Frank de kova/Perry Lopez, not forgetting Robert Keith and Elisha Cook Jnr. Director Delmar Daves keeps the action going and for 107 mins this was this horse's pleasure if you get the reference. Highly recomended to all Western fans and fans of Ladd.",1408579200,17,813,5.120300751879699
2839931,1,B000QRI1H6,"I cannot rate this movie, I had to return it as it wouldn't play on my player even though I have one with the capabilities.",1400457600,,123,3.96
2839932,3,B000QRI1H6,"Delmer Daves' initial success came with the influential 'Broken Arrow,' which was a beautiful and humane film... Daves made another film about Indians, 'Drum Beat', which he recognizes to be the most authentic of his movies...

The hallmark of Daves' Westerns is their authenticity... Where Ford pictured the West as it should have been, Daves has tried to recapture the West as it was...

The film provides Bronson with his real break-through role as a screen actor... He makes indelible impression on audiences in his vivid role as the renegade Indian heavy Captain Jack who repudiates peace talk... Captain Jack is proud, ruthless and treacherous, scaring everybody plenty...

The setting for this fact-based story is Oregon represented by location shooting in Northern Arizona's Coconino National Forest in 1872...

Indian expert Johnny MacKay (Alan Ladd) is presidentially appointed as Peace Commissioner, assigned to effect a treaty, without resort to arms, with the Modoc Indians of the Oregon-California border...

The Modoc majority leans toward the hoped-for peace, but a renegade band strongly resists, under the self-appointed leadership of the vicious Captain Jack (Bronson), whose men ravage the area and skirmish with the soldiers of Fort Klamath...

In the film's exciting climax, MacKay personally tracks down Jack and battle him in fierce hand-to-hand combat into the sweeping current of a river...

The sweet Audrey Dalton portrays the lovely eastern girl who loves Johnny 'more than any peace on earth.'

Marisa Pavan is the friendly Toby who dares to believe that she can bring peace and goodwill to her people...

Hayden Rorke is President Grant who knows in his heart that 'peace doesn't come cheaply.'

Anthony Caruso is the friendly Modoc chief who never trust Captain Jack...

Elisha Cook, Jr. is the unscrupulous trader who sells Winchesters to the Modoc Indians...

Rodolfo Acosta is Scarface Charlie who warns Captain Jack: 'You kill, or they kill you.'

Robert Keith is Bill the coachman, who yells after the murder of his woman, Lily: 'You dish out your peace, Johnny. I'll dish out my end.'

""Drum Beat"" is a lively item, thanks to Delmer Daves, who keeps the familiar story line moving at a fair clip... The material is trite but the production value gives it gloss, and the film benefits greatly from its applied research on Indian character...",1233446400,19,2378,5.19109947643979
2839933,4,B000QRI1H6,"Warner Bros. presents ""DRUM BEAT"" (17 November 1954) (111 mins/Color) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- Alan Walbridge Ladd was an American film actor appeared in dozens of films in bits and small roles, including Citizen Kane --- These barely kept him and his household afloat --- He had married a high-school acquaintance, Midge Harrold, with whom he had a son, Alan Ladd, Jr that ended in a divorce in 1941.

Ladd married his agent/manager and former movie actress Sue Carol in 1942 --- It was at this point that Carol found a vehicle which made Ladd's career, ""This Gun for Hire"" --- His performance as a hitman with a conscience made him a sensation --- Ladd went on to become one of Paramount Pictures' most popular stars --- A brief timeout for military service with the United States Army Air Force's First Motion Picture Unit did not diminish his popularity --- None of his subsequent films of the 1940s were as notable as ""This Gun for Hire"", but he did appear to good effect in Raymond Chandler's story ""The Blue Dahlia"" (1946) alongside the similarly diminutive Veronica Lake (5'2"" or 1.57 m), with whom he had been paired in ""This Gun for Hire"" (1942) --- His Captain Carey, U.S.A. (1950) was notable for its soundtrack containing Nat King Cole's classic song, ""Mona Lisa"".

Our story line and plot,  President Ulysses S. Grant (Hayden Rorke) orders Indian fighter Johnny MacKay (Alan Ladd) to negotiate with the Modocs of northern California and southern Oregon --- On the way he must escort Nancy Meek (Audrey Dalton) to the home of her aunt and uncle. After Modoc renegade Captain Jack (Charles Bronson) engages in ambush and other atrocities, MacKay must fight him one-on-one with guns, knives and fists ---  Based on a true story Director Delmer Daves wrote the story & screenplay, the film is distinguished by J. Peverell Marley's breathtaking exterior photography, and by Victor Young's ballad-like musical score --- For the first and only time an American general was killed during the wars against the Indian tribes --- The little known Modoc war was another of those lesser known conflicts, as action against the Sioux on the Great Plains and the Apache in the Arizona desert got far more attention.

2839974,1,B000QRI1H6,"Truely one of the worst westerns i've ever seen. Hard to know where to begin with this mess. Alan Ladd can be a great actor (see - This Gun for Hire or Shane) but in this he is wooden and carries an absurd, out of place, smug smile throughout almost every scene. The humor is as flat as a pancake. The historical accuracy is nil. The fight scenes are lame. The music is unbearable and layered over almost every scene. Even the photography is mediocre. Delmer Daves is a sometimes good director who has done much better then this (Jubal with Glenn Ford or Dark Passage with Bogart are excellent). Instead of wasting your time I recommend seeing something by Anthony Mann, Budd Boetticher, or John Ford if you would really like to see how great westerns are done.",1441238400,2,761,4.482014388489208

2839976,4,B000QRI1H6,"Saw this a couple of weeks ago on cable ( TCM ). Liked it so got it as soon as I found it on amazon. Actually got it through secondary seller for a good lower price. It came almost right away, so I was very happily surprised.
 This movie is very scenic and colorful and is the real story of small Indian war in California ( Modoc War of 1872-3 ) Led by captain Jack  ( Bronson ) Ladd is brought in to deal with situation because others can't. Only time in Indian war that U.S. General is killed by the enemy. At a peace talk no less. This actually happened!
 Well in his first major role Bronson steals the picture even though Ladd was the star and was good.
 Ever since I was a kid ( long time ago ) I always rooted for the Indians to win. Even then I went for the under dog and those being taken advantage of by stealing their land and life. More power to our Native Americans I say. Sad ending, though. Just like in real life.
 Very good early western. Recommended.",1433116800,3,968,4.073684210526316

For years after we would always refer to Bronson as ""Captain Jack"" whenever we saw him in a movie or TV show. The story is based on fact--the Modoc Indian war in Northern California. Years after seeing the movie I saw that region of California where the movie took place and thanks to the movie was able to appreciate the historical significance more fully.",1412985600,10,513,4.468085106382978
