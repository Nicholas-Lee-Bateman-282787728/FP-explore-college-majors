8403601,4,B003RFC32I,"This has been one of the silent films that I have dearly wished to see since my teen yeras when I found a copy of the novel chocked full of pictures from the film and the local showing of ""Beau Geste"" in St. Louis.  The story is the same, but the quality of the film is terrible--it needs to be remastered and made viewable since this copy is (forgive the expression) crappy.  That said, those who love the story and can wade through the poor quality will see a host of stars--with Ronald Colman leading the way--into the best story ever written of the French Foreign Legion.  Wlliam Powell is perfect as the rat he places.  Beery is wonderful as the villain.  I did miss Gussie.  Also, the poorly made 1966 film was mentioned but not the superior remake of 1939!",1394409600,,763,4.375886524822695
8403602,4,B003RFC32I,"Ronald Colman possessed  one of the greatest voices in the history of sound cinema so surely a silent movie would be a waste of material. Well Colman also had in abundance the ability to project his thoughts directly from his face to  the viewer( see Tale of two cities, Lost Horizon and A Double Life , for which he won an academy award. ) this may have been a spin off of his silent film experience. Beau Geste is a well directed and well acted  version of P.C. Wrens famous novel of the french foreign legion later remade almost scene for scene with Gary Cooper in 1939 . The music soundtrack is very dated but the film is an excellent example of Hollywood quality during this era  .  That Colman had a unique presence and an intelligent mind working for him is obvious while viewing this. It's well worth getting if you appreciate cinema history.",1374105600,4,850,4.458064516129032
