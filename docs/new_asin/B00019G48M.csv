You know Pantera ""Walk""-excellent video.  Forgotten but still very under-rated ""Faith No More, 'Midlife Crisis'"" 2ND for awesome on this disk.",1204502400,,281,5.222222222222222
8008821,3,B00019G48M,"Small selection of Alternative Metal hits. Collection is short with only 6 videos. But what do you want for 7 dollars? About a dollar or so a video. Though i wouldnt even pay a dollar for some of these videos ,they suck that bad. The first 4 aren't good. The pantera video was really cool (...). Thats the reason I got this dvd-  If you want a couple cool videos get it or if your looking for a specific video. Other than that its not worth it.
