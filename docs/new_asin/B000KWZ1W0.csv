It goes through the entire life of baki. It even has an alternate version of the cord cutter ova in the series. The thing that gets me is the last episode. Yujiro disappers but you never find out what happens between him and baki or between him and the guy they let out of prison to kill yujiro.
You also never find out what happens between baki and kozway.
There is also a great style in it i would like them to go further into. I know a little jiu-jitsu in reality. However the principle of aiki is a cool concept and although it's the basic principle of balance and balance points there are some concepts of ki in it. Not meaning the street fighter/DBZ Ki attacks. Real ki which is done with breathing and other sources of power.

Plus I like doppo orochi i wanted them to explore the fighters more than they did.

Loved the anime i hope there is more to come",1199750400,,936,4.194444444444445
8159177,5,B000KWZ1W0,"I've watched the eniter baki series from 1 to 12 and it was great, i'm not really and anime fan but this series opened my eyes. I'm curious as to wether or not this is the last round of the baki series though the ending leaves you to wonder of baki and his father yujiro will ever meet for their one on one match and what will happen once jack hanma recovers. Well lets hope this isn't the end because they can make a great vol 13.",1181260800,,431,3.9655172413793105
