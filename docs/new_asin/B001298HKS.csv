This show requires a certain mindedness that I don't have. It's up to the people that watch this to carry us forward. What does this have to do with a review you ask, well you must possess a certain quality to appreciate something so god awful that there has to be some good in it somewhere (just like our state of affairs)., I just can't find it. I want spoon fed entertainment fed to me like welcome back kotter",1399507200,,546,4.259615384615385
8244899,5,B001298HKS,"One of the best series adult swim has aired. Perhaps the most brilliant full length animated film I have ever seen. Characters, storyline, humor, underlying symbolism all harmoniously melded in an entertaining mind screw. A MUST OWN. I've watched it over and over again and never tire from its non-linear, subversive storytelling and deep, amazingly developed characters. Get it from Adult swim!",1321660800,,395,5.387096774193548
8244900,5,B001298HKS,"I have no clue why this gem isn't on Amazon, but it's a must buy in every way. From the Lynchian themes to the bizarrely irreverent styling it demands to be seen. So go buy yourself a copy for a mere $19 and be glad to be a proud owner of something truly great and wholly unique:

8244901,5,B001298HKS,"This show first appeared on television at the turn of the century. Competing with Amos and Andy, 12 oz mouse took a radical look at civil rights, intending to help earn women their place and giving insight on inter racial marriage. At the time, the terribly racist success that was Amos and Andy dominated the radio scene. The problem with 12 oz mouse's success was that there was only one television and it was not in color. All of the cg effects would often cause the Motorolla tube televisions to overheat. During the first world war, 12 oz mouse helped provide Americans with much needed laughter and information concerning our boys on the front lines. This DVD contains several commentaries by Leonard Martin that I found to be  both entertaining and informative. In one feautrette, he interviews sailors that claimed to have painted depictions of 12 oz mouse characters on their hookers before full invasion took place. This is the song of America. In a way, every boss is a shark, and every city is burning.",1207612800,,1014,4.761363636363637
8244902,5,B001298HKS,"12 Oz Mouse may quite honestly be the most significant cinematic work thusfar of the 21st century. At the surface level, it's one of the funniest shows you'll ever see. The dialogue is priceless and memorable, and in no-time at all you feel like you know the characters intimately. On a much deeper level, the overall plot and underlying symbolisms culminate in creating the most complex and enlightening message I've found in a long time. I don't want to be a movie-spoiler, but I can at least say that one of the larger messages of this epic-movie is: Our reality is layered into multiple yet equally insignificant larger realities, while reassurring us that no matter what reality in which we exist our actions in that reality are what define us as an individual.

The show originally aired as a series of short 15-minute episodes, but they were meant to be linked continously together. The DVD gives the story as one non-stop 3.5-hour long movie, along with some great extras. Highly recommended and highly entertaining. Easily my favorite TV Show, Movie, and overall story.",1204934400,,1078,4.890710382513661
