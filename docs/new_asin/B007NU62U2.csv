5100352,3,B007NU62U2,"Since finding Jessica Smith's YouTube channel and falling in love with those workouts, I've been going back and trying her older workouts.  This DVD was just not for me.  I found the segments either kind of boring or difficult to do with my arthritic hands and knees.",1365984000,4,267,4.659574468085107
5100353,5,B007NU62U2,"This video is amazing.  I received it yesterday and today did the entire 75 min workout and was impressed with everything about it.  Great workout that you can make more intense, or lower impact if you need. I really like cardio kickbox videos/classes, but find that they mostly have way too complex and crazy moves/combos and I really just like basic stuff.  This video delivers in that regard, just basic punches and kicks in the kickbox segment.  Also, Jessica & Guillermo are just lovely instructors.  The video has 5 workouts that are 15 mins each and they take turns doing each segment.  I particularly loved the core segment and the final segment is very tai chi/yoga/relaxation focused.  That is great as I've been trying to incorporate those into my daily workouts and it's nice not to have to go do a separate video.  This is an amazing buy and probably my most favorite of my last 20 DVD purchases!  Definitely being added to my rotation.",1365638400,6,949,4.703030303030303
5100354,4,B007NU62U2,"Haven't done much yet on it, but love both the trainers. Great workout and not super difficult. Little bit of everything in this workout dvd.",1364774400,,141,4.68
5100355,5,B007NU62U2,"I bought this DVD on impulse from Target several weeks ago. I was mainly drawn in by the fact it is kickboxing based (which I love) and features Jessica Smith, my favorite ""Hollywood trainer."" When I tried it out the next day I knew I had made the right decision. This DVD gets you a LOT of bang for your buck--the workout is 75 minutes long for the same price as many 30-min workout DVDs. The workouts are FUN to do, challenging but never too straining, and at the end there is a 15 minute Tai-chi sequence which will leave you feeling balanced and refreshed. This is the perfect morning workout to make your whole day feel a lot more productive!",1364169600,8,647,4.355371900826446
5100356,5,B007NU62U2,"I put this DVD in on a Sunday morning expecting to get a calm, light workout - that was not the case!  Although the whole mood of this video is very calm and relaxing, it was quite the challenge!  I did the whole thing in its entirety, which clocks in at 75 minutes!  The workout can also be broken into 5 15-minute segments, which is nice, so I can pick and choose which ones I want to do when I am pressed for time.  Both of Guillermo Gomez's segments are fun cardio kickboxing workouts.  I found them fun and easy to learn on the first try.  I broke a sweat, but they didn't leave me out of breath.  A beginner could pick these up easily.  Jessica Smith's segments were the surprise!  I am a huge fan of her workouts, and her segments do not disappoint! They were challenging, and more on the intermediate side.  Her first segment is full body toning (no weights) and the second is core toning (also no weights).  They were tough and I am feeling the burn in all of my muscles the day after (especially the thighs, glutes, triceps, and lower abs).

The last segment was a very relaxing stretch with tai chi and chi gong moves. This part was led by Gomez, with Smith chiming in occassionally.  I really enjoyed it! It included lots of slow stretches and deep breathing.  One thing that I noticed during this segment was the awkward banter between the two.  I know that they are currently married, but I don't know if they were a couple at the time the video was made. It seemed like every time she made a comment, he would retort back in an arrogant way.  For example, she would say something like ""I really feel this stretch in my legs"" and he would snap back ""this stretch works everywhere""...  It doesn't detract from the quality of the segment, but it was noticeable.

Overall, this was a very enjoyable, challenging workout.  I don't have anything else like it in my (large) collection of workout DVDs.",1364169600,32,1909,4.402857142857143
5100357,5,B007NU62U2,"I am a big fan of Jessica Smith, so I am partial to her portions of this dvd, but her costar gives you a good workout as well.  Each segment is only 15 minutes so you can do one alone, or do them all together for a good workout.  I wished the first kick boxing segment had some more kicking in it, but it still gets my heart rate up.  Also, I would have enjoyed more stretching in the relaxing portion of the dvd instead of the slow movements that are karate inspired (I think), but that's just my preference.  All in all I use this video frequently, and I think it's definitely worth it for the price.",1362182400,2,602,4.076271186440678
5100358,5,B007NU62U2,"This workout sneaks up on you. It is definitely do-able and not intimidating, but it works you out. You will sweat and get a great workout. I have done this video twice, and I am surprised that I definitely feel a bit sore all over the next day, since the toning is all done without weights. Jessica has some very unique moves that work the muscles. I especially feel it in my triceps and legs. The cardio, led by by her husband, will elevate your heart rate but not leave you breathless. It's just a fun workout, and I like the 15 minute segments, since I cannot always dedicate a whole hour at a time to a workout, but usually can fit in that amount of time (or more) if I break it into shorter segments throughout the day.",1360540800,21,725,4.223021582733813
5100359,5,B007NU62U2,Amazing DVD! I can keep alternating which workouts I do together inorder to keep my body challenged. I must also add that every workout in this dvd is challenging and I absolutely love the restore and relax segment to end any of my sessions :),1350086400,7,243,4.4222222222222225
5100360,5,B007NU62U2,I have this when it was called Yin Yang fusion. It is a great fun workout that I can mix and match. I always feel it the next day especially inner thighs for some reason. Its great also in the evenings when i want to do a quick 15 mins I pop it on. The trainers are fun and upbeat and the time whizzes by.,1344470400,13,305,3.707692307692308
5100381,5,B007NU62U2,Enjoy the change in workouts.  Nice pace.,1457395200,2,41,4.857142857142857
5100382,5,B007NU62U2,"Love it!!!  Both Jessica and Guillermo do amazing jobs with their cueing. You feel amazing  and worked afterwards. Each one is great by itself  or if you have more time you can combine them. And it is always nice when the instructors actually work just as hard as you instead of stopping and explaining a move while you continue to work your tail off -_- ( you know who you are Jillian Michaels!) But anyways, highly recommend! I hesitated forever to buy this dvd and boy I'm glad I finally bought it, it will not disappoint.",1457222400,6,525,4.447916666666667

5100385,5,B007NU62U2,An amazing combination of workouts.  Love the different teaching styles.  Each workout is 15 minutes long and a good introduction to each area of fitness training.  I plan to look into more videos by these two ... individually or together.  Expanded my horizons.  Love it !!!,1444953600,2,275,4.891304347826087

5100388,4,B007NU62U2,"I really do not understand the need to move so quickly through a workout video. I wish that these people would learn to take a breath in between things so you can catch up to them and get in ""a groove"" with the workout, especially if it's your first time. Workout wise: it's great. It's intense and it gives you a good workout and sweat.",1428537600,,337,4.2
5100389,3,B007NU62U2,I like how she work but this  dvd not really is was I expect,1423440000,,60,3.2857142857142856
5100390,5,B007NU62U2,"Love this workout DVD. Divided into 15 minute segments this is convenient when you don't have much time to exercise, but gives you a nice workout. The last segment focuses on tai chi and relaxation and is a nice end to a workout.",1421020800,3,229,4.348837209302325
5100401,5,B007NU62U2,Great.. Love the variety,1417046400,,24,5.25
5100402,3,B007NU62U2,"This is probably a decent full body workout, but I just don't enjoy it at all. I'm normally a huge fan of Jessica Smith, but I felt like the segments she led were hurried, like she was trying to cram in as much stuff as possible in 15 minutes. I just felt frustrated, because some of the moves were very challenging and there was no time to adjust. Another thing that really bothers me about this DVD is that you have to go through a warm-up and cool-down with each segment when you've selected ""Play All."" That's one of my pet peeves, and I wish they had an edited version that goes through each segment without having to slow down to warm up again. Finally, I just find myself watching the clock during this DVD. The segments are short, and they keep you moving, but I find myself losing interest halfway through each segment. I'm still giving it 3 stars because I think it's an interesting idea, and both instructors are okay.",1414972800,11,929,4.406976744186046

5100405,5,B007NU62U2,I really like the pase of this video.  It is not jarring on my joints.  Some segments are more challenging than others.  It is a good intro level DVD.,1409961600,2,150,4.103448275862069
5100406,5,B007NU62U2,"This is a fun video! Jesicca Smith is always great and Guillermo Gomez is a good instructor! I have to say though that he reminds me of Father Sarducci off the old SNL!!! He looks and sounds just like him! This alone endeared him to me.
The exercise segments go by quickly. I did think the Core flow was my favorite and found it challenging. Again, the segments go by so quickly it is easy to do the entire DVD. Some of Miss Smith's other routines are FAR more difficult and exhausting. This is a good one for days you have time to do the entire DVD and want to break a sweat but not be pushed too hard. Or do a segment of the kick boxing or punches for a warm up and then go onto weightlifting.",1409788800,3,695,4.043478260869565
5100407,4,B007NU62U2,This was a tough tape for me and I am a pretty advanced exerciser.  Jessica's part was not difficult but her husband's was quick moving and difficult.  It includes a lot of different exercise styles.,1405382400,,199,4.6571428571428575
5100408,5,B007NU62U2,I like this workout routine. It's effective enough to see the results necessary for achieving and even flow of a energetic day.,1402272000,,127,4.818181818181818
5100409,5,B007NU62U2,I love the fact that this dvd has five 15 minute workouts to where you can mix and match. It's great to pair up two different workouts and then 15 minutes of the yoga relax and restore.,1401148800,,185,4.027027027027027
5100410,3,B007NU62U2,"This is probably a great DVD for someone who is young and fit but not for older, less fit women. It almost killed my Nana. I gave it to her for her birthday. Guess I better get her the new Jane Fonda instead.",1397347200,3,208,3.86046511627907

5100422,5,B007NU62U2,I found this dvd a challenge and fun. You will not get bored with this routine. Jessica is excellent motivator. It has a quick pace..,1377907200,5,133,4.36
5100423,5,B007NU62U2,"Fun, different and challenging.  I appreciate the 15 minute segments, as I can piece together different workouts to keep it from getting mundane.  I like both trainers.  I was very sore after doing it the first two times.",1376784000,2,221,4.7631578947368425
5100424,4,B007NU62U2,"I really feel these, and like that I am able to keep up, that they are short enough for me to do all of.  I have some health issues that prevent me from exercising very long at a time.",1374710400,4,184,3.717948717948718

5100426,3,B007NU62U2,"This is an OK DVD workout.  I do like the various options for types or workouts, and that they are about 12 minutes each.  However, a few of them are not my 'style' so to speak, and I find myself turning it off and going for a run.  I think it's a matter of 'workout personalities', so for some this may be awesome :-)",1371168000,2,318,3.9375
5100427,5,B007NU62U2,I have to say that I have not had a bad video from Jessica Smith. I have 6 of her DVD's and they are great. This one is also a great fitness video. You won't be disappointed.,1370995200,2,174,3.72972972972973
5100428,4,B007NU62U2,"This video is made up of 5 x 15 min segments. 2 are with Guillermo Gomez (who used to work with Janis Saffell) and Jessica Smith. I mistook her for Tracie Smith which would have been a better work out. However the 15 min segments are good the best one thus far (done 3/5) is the one where she is doing the standing legwork but she's not really great at cueing the need to pivot a bit to execute a roundhouse kick.
It's pretty good. 15 mins is good. I like Guillermo.  It all works.",1370131200,3,481,4.063157894736842
5100429,5,B007NU62U2,"I thought at first the workout was just ok and that the last ten minutes were negligible but...it's an effective combination of strengthening and cardio and in the last section, the rewarding feeling of calmness at the end of a good workout.",1370044800,,241,4.761904761904762
5100430,4,B007NU62U2,"I bought this video because I have loved Jessica's other workouts and like that this one had martial arts included.  I really like Guillermo's segments - they are great for a day when I don't want to do a more advanced workout. He has a nice, soothing voice and is motivational as well. He doesn't dwell on the techniques for the kicking and punching segments, so this is not the one you want to use to work on technique - it is purely cardio, toning and balance. Jessica's segments are a little more advanced and she is excellent as usual. Good cueing, great motivation, unique moves that will make you work hard.  The things I would like to see done better on this video are titles at the beginning of each new segment, and I would love it if you could customize your workout like on the 10 minute videos. It would be nice to pick and choose which workouts you wanted to do instead of fast-forwarding through if you aren't doing the entire video. Thanks for a fun and different workout to add to my ever-growing collection!",1368144000,6,1025,4.446808510638298

8519787,2,B007NU62U2,"I really wanted to like this DVD after reading so many good reviews. I tried all the workouts this morning and was terribly disappointed. These are definitely beginner's workouts. I didn't break a sweat at all and the workouts barely even raised my heart rate. I could get a better workout walking. The workouts were all super low impact and while the moves got a little tricky at times, the cuing was good (which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1). This might be a good workout for someone who is just getting into fitness, but if you are more fit and used to high intensity/HIIT style workouts, this will seem waaaay too easy. In the cardio kick box workout all you do is punch your arms in a bunch of different ways and you move your legs around a little but it didn't feel like exercise to me at all. I did enjoy the core power and flow workout more than the other workouts, and I might on occasion do that workout, but the rest of them were just too easy to get in a serious workout. I'm glad I only spent $5 on it. Not worth the money for even a moderately fit person.",1473120000,5,1078,4.162679425837321
8519788,5,B007NU62U2,"OK, before purchasing this I saw some unfavorable comments and I cannot understand where they came from. I had a freaking BALL with this DVD, I thought it was a lot of dang fun!! The kickboxing segment is heart-pumping and constant motion with footwork and punches. Guillermo gives it a Latin flavor that is fun and spicy! The background music has a Latin flavor to it, and a couple of times in the video you can see him kind of swivel his hips in a salsa-dancing type move, which I found adorable and fun. Same thing with the lower body balance segment.

I found the whole video mentally and physically challenging, and laughed several times just because I was having fun and enjoyed Guillermo's half-Spanish/half-English cuing so much. I have a black belt inTae Kwon Do and an intermediate yoga background and I just enjoyed the HECK out of the whole thing.

The relax and flow segment was challenging but centering, leaving me feeling focused and at peace with myself.

If you are a new exerciser who needs a lot of really specific direction, you may not like it, though. Guillermo doesn't waste a lot of time with unnecessary talk. He does give cuing and direction, but mostly he leads by example. You can follow just by watching his body. But if you're a person who requires a lot of verbal direction, you may want to skip this DVD until you're a little more experienced and a little more at-home in your body.

I have several of Jessica's videos and this one is predominantly led by her husband, but I just thought it was great. Definitely looking forward to doing again and again.",1472428800,3,1587,4.597173144876325
