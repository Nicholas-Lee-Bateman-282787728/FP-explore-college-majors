616844,3,6303269966,"This movie, while fantastically outrageous, is really funny. I've read some of the other reviews of people rating this really low, complaining about the 'incredibly unbelievable' situations the baby gets into, and out of, and I just can't help but those people must be horrible to watch a movie with. I mean YES a lot of this movie is completely unbelievable...THAT IS THE POINT! It's unbelievably outrageous slapstick comedy and maybe you have to be a certain type of person but it's funny. My kids...actually most kids, thoroughly enjoy this movie. To me for an adult to say this movie is corny just doesn't make sense is dumb.

Watch it for what it is.",1492214400,,655,4.745614035087719

616847,4,6303269966,"This was not my most favorite movie. I have taken one star away for some of the most unrealistic situations. I'm usually able to look at a movie and put aside reality, but there were times in this movie that were so unreal that it was disconcerting. An example would be the scene in the zoo at the gorilla house- no one came into the monkey area? In the middle of the day? At all?

Other than that- this movie is a great family friendly movie. It was similar to Home Alone in that you have three bumbling crooks trying to make a fortune by kidnapping a baby. The baby gets out and leads the crooks on a merry chase, ending with them getting caught and the baby being happy at home with his family.

There is a little bit of sadness in that the parents are very rich and at the beginning of the movie think more of their baby as a means to the end. The nanny is the one that takes care of the baby and knows the babies likes and dislikes. However by the end of the movie they are happy to be reunited with the baby and you have the impression that things are going to change.

This is a clean movie. There really not any sexual innuendos, sarcasm or hidden adult humor that you sometimes see in childrens movies now.
It is great slapstick humor.",1489968000,,1244,4.153526970954357
616848,5,6303269966,I couldn't stop laughing from the escape to the end as it is a classic.  A baby gets the best of three robbers never stopping once with the laughter in which the criminals had one of the worst days of their lives,1488844800,,212,4.0476190476190474

I'd have been really annoyed if I'd paid to watch this.  Even our four-year-old was bored.  Our three year old loved watching the baby when things were calm, but for most of the film was terrified that something was going to happen to him, because he was, of course, perpetually in danger which he narrowly avoided just through luck.

619936,3,6303269966,"Ideal for those 10 and under, expecially for those kids into slapstick. This is basically a mindless 'Home Alone' formula but this time featuring a brilliant baby that is kidnapped from snooty millionaire parents, escapes out a window and crawls all around the streets of Chicago visiting pages from a favorite book. You have to suspend all disbelief for this one (namely how a baby could crawl along the streets of Chicago and not have filthy hands by the end of the day.) The visual slapstick, namely the three baddies having terrible things happen to them as they try to recapture the baby will have the kids laughing, but anyone older will just roll their eyes at the ridiculous unfolding of the film. Its fairly safe for all ages, with just a couple mild curse words and a few, mostly oblique adult references (e.g. a lighter held to the groin of one of the bad guys, etc.)",1415923200,,878,4.598726114649682

It is so well acted for a slapstick fun movie which is appropriate for any age from 2 to 102 and older.  One doesn't have to worry about embarrassing commercials, language, suggestive behavior or anything else.  I highly recommend this movie for all ages and I would dare say that if we had more movies like this our families might enjoy an  evening together at a time when the screens of television and theatres are more interested in the shock value of  unnecessary sexual scenes, murder, child abuse, drugs and other horrific end of the world situations.",1405468800,5,672,4.6525423728813555

621693,3,6303269966,"I can't add too much to this wildly far-fetched and unbelievable but fundamentally watchable take on ""Little Tyke Foils his Kidnappers"" except to comment on the initial inspiration to ""Baby's Day Out"" (hereafter BDO).  Lots of people must think that BDO is copying Baby Herman from ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" or a couple of Tom and Jerry shorts where the cat and mouse become allies by necessity and strive to protect a constantly wandering baby from disaster.  Well, even before that, we have a couple of '50s and '60s Popeye cartoons with the same premise.  Taking a break from gobbling spinach and pummeling Bluto, Popeye (usually at Olive's insistence) reluctantly agrees to baby-sit Swee'pea.  Unfortunately, innocent Swee'pea has wandering tendencies and easily escapes Popeye's supervision.  Swee'pea insouciantly crawls through town, with Popeye in hot pursuit.  Of course, Swee'pea comes through all sorts of disasters (like falling girders, busy streets, fierce zoo animals) without a mark on him, but Popeye, who constantly saves the baby from being hurt, gets put through the wringer until (sometimes but not always) he remembers to eat the plant that gives him super abilities.

  As for BDO itself, it's an update of the above-mentioned cartoons, plus an amalgamation of the ""Home Alone"" movies and even a smidgen of O'Henry's short story ""The Ransom of Red Chief"".  Oh, and of course the typical Three Stooges short (by the way, I'm a bit amazed that the Stooges never did a short where they had to play frazzled guardians of wandering kids, or did they?)  You have to suspend tons of disbelief to enjoy this movie, like for example baby Bink shuffling about with almost nobody noticing him except his would-be kidnappers (led by frustrated Joe Mantegna) or a gorilla cage with widely spaced bars that anybody can approach too closely and too dangerously.  But once you suspend that disbelief, you'll have a slapsticky good time, especially if you like sweet babies.  Just one warning: of course the baby is never hurt, but the kidnappers suffer excruciating and shall we say, private injuries.  Oh, well, block out the cartoonish pain too, and enjoy.",1338508800,,2165,5.0790960451977405

We still enjoyed it... anything is better than watching a whole day of that Barney idiot! We would've all ended up in the loony bin!

Naturally, when I became a father I thought my daughter would enjoy a movie about a baby's adventure through the city which she did at first... till we got to the part in the zoo and the gorilla that is! She really freaked out and got really scared when the gorilla growled in one of the goons face! Now whenever I even suggest we watch this movie she gets edgy and panicky! Not sure why she is so scared... need to look into that... tried playing it the other day and she completely ignored the TV and went to play with her blocks just to avoid it... she usually turns into a mindless zombie whenever the telly is on....

That aside, having seen this movie a zillion times, I still laugh at a lot of parts in this movie... it is a great movie for the entire family to watch, even the very young audience... but I sometimes worry that all that violence and the fact that the audience is encouraged to laugh at others getting hurt might give kids ideas to try to imitate these stunts when no one is looking, but that shouldn't be an issue with appropriately aged youngsters.

He gets away from the 3bumbling kidnappers and explores the city! (following his favorite book)

As they follow and try to catch him(the baby who seems much smarter then the 3men), the men have alot of brick walls they hit along the way(figure of speach) the baby however is safe the whole time even crawling in a cage at the zoo with a gorilla who beats up the guys trying to reach in after him and acts like Binks mother before Bink waves goodbye and crawls outside the fence outside the exhibit building and goes on his way leaving the 3 guys chasing him seeing stars inside only to realize he left to get up and go scrambling after!

This is a great family movie, i no-longer have the VHS tape as it was stolen when all of our movies were stolen years ago(but that's another story). The DVD version has the theatrical trailers as a bonus(as a movie buff might like to know), and i got this movie gem on DVD in the $5bin at walmart.

i would recommend this as a family friendly movie to anyone with kids, if you do not like family friendly movies then i would not recommend this movie to you. i do point out as stated by a previous reviewer it is not realistic, though it wasn't intended to be.

Baby's Day Out is actually a book that Bink reads, and he visits all the places that is in the book. Bink is extremely smart and cute. It's awesome that a baby can cause so much trouble for three bad guys. If you love comedy and babies, you'll love BABY'S DAY OUT!!!",1227225600,,693,4.140740740740741
621774,5,6303269966,"First - the scene in the park is one of the funniest extended slapstick segments ever commited to film.  Next - repeated viewings allow you to pick up on the dialogue - there's tons of funny throwaway lines scattered throughout the movie.  Is it great art?  No.  Is it something that will lift your spirits and leave you happier than when it started?  Yes.  Basically, it's worth it to spend $10, fast forward to about 55 minutes into it, watch the scene in the park a few times and then put it away again until you have some friends or family over.  Guys will definitely have a more over the top reaction than most women or kids, but in general it's good family fare if your kids are 10 or older.",1221523200,,697,4.2748091603053435
621865,2,6303269966,"This will mostly appeal to very young children or babies. Adults may be slightly bored or appalled watching a baby crawl out windows, through traffic, on skyscrapers, in a Gorillas cage, et cetera. Add in three bumbling idiot kidnappers that get racked between the legs a lot by falling onto things. That's the type of humor you will find in this John Hughes movie that doesn't hold a torch to ""Look Who's Talking"". I love most of Hughes movies but I was disappointed in this one. There are a few light moments but overall it is not something I would sit through again. If you enjoyed this catch ""Andre"" and ""Dr. Doolittle"".

I was grateful when the director would switch to scenes of the parents of the ""kidnapped"" baby, just so I could catch my breath.  And of course, the the baby (played by twins, as usual) is cute enough to make the hardest heart melt, especially at the inevitable happy ending.

I view it differently.  I see it as John Hughes creating a Kubrick-esque final statement on live cartoons.  The film is hilarious at moments, even after watching it several times.  The most amazing thing is the performance of the two young principals, the Worton twins.  The director, by whatever magic, manages to infuse the ""Baby Bink"" performances with wit, and a significant tongue-in-cheek aspect.  Yes, the gonads on fire joke is a bit on the nose, but the way John Hughes takes it to the extreme of this movie, who would dare to try and top that?  And how could you even accomplish such a feat?
In any event, this movie is a delight.

Watching this, I couldn't mope.  Watching all the adventures of the story book come true was too too cool.  It looked like Chicago as the setting.
So that's where the producers of the first TOY STORY got that idea of crossing a busy avenue dodging oncoming traffic.  But that took some doing with the truck actually going over the active boy.  Some special effects!
And that scene with Joe M. hanging from the shut down machinery of a high rise building during construction reminded me of Doris Day in MIDNIGHT LACE.
