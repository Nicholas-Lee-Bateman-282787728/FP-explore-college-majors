73520,4,0784017875,"I took tae kwon do for two years about a year and a half ago, and recently I had been meaning to get back into it-- however, I had gotten myself a little out of shape.  So I bought this video. She explains the kicks and punches pretty well, and as for the first twenty minute section-- whew!  I only got through ten minutes of it!  However, I finished watching the tape for future reference (I have a bit of building up to do..)and it looks like a great workout.  And from that first ten minutes (Yep, I'm definitely back to beginning level..) I could feel the burn, most definitely.  Although it's not the best tape for my level, I'm going to keep working at it-- it's worth it!",977616000,,679,4.232558139534884
73521,5,0784017875,"You are either a Denise Austin fan or not.  She definitely has a special loud raspy voice and certain phrases she likes to use.  I have another of her videos, the SIZZLER that I love.  It inspired me to buy another of her videos.  This one!  It is fun, energizing, easy to learn and gives results even after the first session (aching arm and thigh muscles)!  Enjoy!",973555200,,365,4.373134328358209
73522,5,0784017875,"I have acquired quite a collection of workout videos and this one is my favorite!  It's not too difficult to follow, yet it's challenging enough to keep my heartrate up.  When I'm finished I feel like I've had a pretty thorough workout.  During the warm-up portion of the second 20 minute segment, I substitute my own 5-10 lb. hand weights workout since I'm already warmed up from the first segment.  This allows some toning while still fitting a solid workout into 40 minutes.  As I said, this one is my favorite and I highly recommend it!",971654400,,540,4.583333333333333
73523,5,0784017875,"This was the first Denise Austin video I purchased, and it is great.  I saw results in 2 weeks.  The workout is fast paced and fun.  She is very upbeat and I like that.",951782400,,168,3.8823529411764706
73524,5,0784017875,"when i first bought the video i did not think it would be hard at all. after trying and working up a sweat i was convinced. it seems like where ever i go, what ever i am doing i try to keep my tummy tight and firm. this  video is great for starters.",950745600,,249,3.69811320754717
73525,5,0784017875,"great workout! I have been wanting to try kickboxing workout and I started with this one. I like Denise Austin's other tapes and her show on Lifetime so I gave hers a try. I liked it. It is very challenging but not too fast  for beginners. She keeps you motivated and moving. She does talk throughout  the workout but I find that a ""good"" thing. It keeps you  distracted from the pain. She does a good job with explaining moves and  what is coming up next. I highly recommend this tape for a taste of  kickboxing workout.",949536000,2,521,4.329896907216495
73526,4,0784017875,"Let me just say that this is a great workout for ANYONE...I've been working out for about 18 months, and this one definitely made me work up a sweat, even though each workout is only 20 minutes. I really don't have any  complaints, other than I wish there was more of the punches and kicks...I  felt like I didn't do enough.",949536000,,324,4.295081967213115
73527,5,0784017875,"I've done PLENTY of work out videos, and i find, that when they don't talk, it keeps me wondering when the video is going to be over. I love Denise Austin, she is so motivating and in-shape! I love this work-out,  too. Way better than step aerobics. it is medium cardio, and great toning.  i like the kick/punch combos. It keeps everything interesting. I recommend  this tape.",948067200,2,376,4.582089552238806
73568,3,0784017875,"As far as Denise Austin is concerned, this is probably the worst tape by her that I've come across (and I've tried quite a few of them!) She's quite obnoxious here, more so than she usually is, and is constantly shouting annoyingly lame phrases like ""if you rest, you rust!"" or ""if you don't squeeze it (your [...]) no one else will!"". Plus, the tape just screams cheesiness, b/c they start the workout using the ""rocky"" theme song. I literally winced when I first heard it, thinking ""you've got to be kidding me...""

This workout isn't the best either. It's not very well-queued and her background exercisers (there's too many of them in that small boxing ring they're working out in!) are a bit annoying. One of them - this guy - is a bit distracting as his moves vary a little from Denise...he puts in this extra *umf*, like he's trying to show her up or something.

There are 2 twenty minute workouts in this tape, and neither of them are particularly challenging if you're an intermediate...perhaps if you're a beginner, you'll find this challenging for a bit, but after a few goes I think you'll be bored with it.

Ok, so I've spent quite a bit of time bashing this tape - it's not that horrible. For the money actually, it's not a bad buy at all if you're just starting out. However, if you're looking for more of a challenge (or perhaps a less perky instructor and less cheesiness) you might want to try Kathy Smith's kickboxing workout with Keli Roberts and Keith Cooke. I'm not terribly fond of Kathy as she shouts a lot, but her DVD is much better than this tape, and runs a bit longer.",1152662400,,1597,4.462328767123288
73569,5,0784017875,"Maybe I just have really high tolerance of supposed annoying people, but I LOVE Denise Austin. Her chants such as ""You can do it!"" and ""Its worth it!"" are fun to listen to and create a positive enviroment. This tape, although its hard and makes my calfs burn, is the one that gets me results fast! Within two sessions, I notice a difference. Ive tried the gym, Ive tried dancing at home, Ive tried running and somehow I always resort back to this tape. This one and her Fat Blasting Yoga DVD are incredible. Her cueing isn't the best, but its easy to catch on. I love Denise Austin, she's the only fitness instructor that I like listening to and watching. And Ive got great abs thanks to her!",1112572800,8,692,4.372093023255814
73570,3,0784017875,"Well, this video was very drabby to me. It's kinda gray and black and there's not much vibrance to it. Denise can be inspiring at times but on this video she was mostly annoying with her, ""yes, punch it, yes, come on, yes, that's it"". If you close your eyes to this video, at times you may think your watching a ""different"" type of video. It was a bit over the top with her remarks. I do not think this is a begginer video at all. The back up work out people behind her looked rather clumbsey and asleep, missing que's and moving the wrong way, or off beat. Some of them even looked like begginers. I give it 3 stars because although it did get my heart pumping at times, it was not worth more then 3 dollars.",1106092800,2,709,4.107913669064748
73571,3,0784017875,"I watched this tape in order to get some new ideas for instructing my kickboxing class which consists primarily of 30-45 year old women with beginner to intermediate skills.  Not only did I find the music and Denise's cuing seriously lacking, but her kickboxing knowledge and abilities leave much to be desired.  Her constant blabbering, while positive and perhaps inspiring to some, was bothersome to the point of distraction.  Her choreography was sloppy and disjointed, and her backup ""class"", most of whom possessed the requisite skills, seemed unprepared for her sudden changes and often contradictory verbal cues.  She could use some instruction in proper kicking and punching techniques.  While this video might be suitable for absolute beginners who need constant cheerleading, I would not recommend it for anyone who has any kickboxing experience.  Leave cardio kickboxing to Billy Blanks.",1093564800,4,898,5.424460431654676
73572,4,0784017875,"This is a good workout, but make sure you are in actual shape before you buy this one!",1086220800,2,86,3.8333333333333335
73573,4,0784017875,"Denise jumps on the kickboxing band wagon with a workout that will get your heart pumping and you will feel results in a few weeks with active use.
This is actually 2, 20-minute workouts, and I highly recommend these for beginners or intermediates. (Although both workouts together make a good workout for any fitness level.)  The movements aren't too complicated, so I recommend this more for those new to kickboxing workouts or getting back into working out.  This is one tape that, while you will not drop to the floor in exhaustion when you are done, you definitely will feel the effects.  I also recommend this for women in their 30's and above.  I just don't think Denise is for younger women.  She incorporates too much mom/wifeness into her routines that I don't think younger women will relate to.
As is typical for any Denise Austin tape...her cues are HORRIBLE.  If you are used to her, you know what to expect.  If you aren't used to her, watch it a couple times to get a feel for her tempo, because if you rely on her cuing alone, you will end up making a lot of mistakes initially and getting frustrated.
Overall, a terrific tape to add to your home gym collection.",1041811200,,1179,4.559241706161138
73574,3,0784017875,"This tape came out around the same time that the original tae bo tapes came out.
I bought this tape back then thinking it'd be a great kickboxing video (kickboxing being the new aerobis at the time, and not being able to afford the [price] the tae bo tapes were at the time), and i started doing it, but i couldn't even finish it; the problem is not that it isn't challenging enough, it can be hard if you work hard, but i mean it is how annoying this woman is!!!!
she can't kick right, punch right, she can't do kickboxing, period!
This tape is divided into 2 20 minute workouts, the background is a boxing ring with a few back-up people who cant stop smiling...the first workout seems to be for beginners and the second is for more advanced people.
If you got the money, spend it on tae bo, you won't regret it; but if u don't want to spend much money on a tape or 2, buy this one, but just remember to kick the proper way to achieve maximum results!

I gave this tape 3 stars because it isn't so bad, i mean the workout itself, but lost stars because denise and the people in the video, who look very cheesy.",1037664000,12,1111,4.167441860465116
73575,3,0784017875,"This is not a bad workout - you'll work up a sweat and the moves are not difficult to pick up.  That's the only reason I continue to use this tape.
Denise's seriously incessant talking drives me so crazy that once I got the moves down, I just put it on mute.  It's not just that she talks non-stop - it's the annoying things she says (""You're strong!"" / ""Protect that beautiful face!"") and her tone of voice.  I've done many other workout tapes and this was my first try at Denise Austin - I probably won't buy another of hers.",1036800000,3,527,4.198019801980198
73576,3,0784017875,This is a great workout but the cuing is off pretty bad.  Even the people in the background were off.  I could tell that Denise isn't use to kickboxing.  This is a good workout once you get pass the bad cuing and looking at Denise's kickboxing nots.,1033948800,,249,4.25531914893617
73577,5,0784017875,"For those of you who have tried Billy and feel like you just can't keep up...  This is no wimpy work out by any means, but I was eager to get into the kickboxing craze.  I tried Tae-Bo, but the moves were too fast and confusing for me.  I have loved working out with Denise Austin every since I have begun.  I have lost 28 lbs and have kept it off even after having a baby.  It took a lot of will power, but Denise Austin is a very motivating person.",1031356800,2,450,3.901098901098901
73597,5,0784017875,"I purchased several kickboxing videos and this one is the best. The steps are easy enough to pick up, but not boring.  She creates moves that are not awkward or out of step with the music. You can vary intensity easily depending upon your ability. I was sweating at the end.",1030579200,,274,4.372549019607843
73598,4,0784017875,"As a huge Billy Blanks Tae-bo fan, I have also been using Denise's Kickboxing workout, as well. She properly instructs on the techniques and guides you along on a two, 20-minute workout set. The first is more instructional but still gives a calorie-burning workout. The second workout, ""Drills"" is more powerful and you feel every bit of the 20 minutes. I always go back to this tape when I want a quicker, yet productive workout. Another workout video of Denise's I use is Blast Those Last 10 Pounds, which combines a high-energy, 20-minute cardio kickboxing workout, with the second 20-minutes as an interval-training workout with weights. Another great tape!  I wish Denise would make more kickboxing workouts--they're much more time efficient and very effective!",1017100800,7,766,5.17741935483871
73599,5,0784017875,I love this videos so much. It gives your great caloric burn and it is alot of fun. I still do this video alot. I know alot of people find Denise annoying but i find her encoraging and she is and excerise physioligist so you know she is giving you moves that will help your body. The second workout is very hard and it still tires me out. But both workouts are alot of fun and give you a great aerobic workout. I was intimadated with kickboxing before i bought the tape but now i absoultly love it!! And even if you are scared to try it don't be because Denise will show you all you need to know and it is very unintimating! You will have alot of fun with this tape.,1016928000,2,666,4.015037593984962
73600,4,0784017875,"I was doing the tae bo basic and then tried the advanced and didn't really like it.  Plus on the basic their is a leg kicking round at the end and my hips would really be soar(not in a good way).  I find denise cues better than Billy Blanks and your heart rate is much higher.  Hers is a good next step to his basic, where he uses walking in place she using jumping rope (more aerobic)  I also found with her tape it works your legs a little more than tae bo.  Plus for less money you get two different workout- so it is a more economical purchase.
I gave it four stars because she is annoying and a little condescending.  But the workout is worth it and it is only 20 minutes and you feel better for having worked out anyway.",1014768000,3,726,4.041958041958042
73601,2,0784017875,I like exercise videos and am in generally good shape...I didn't like this video at all.  Denise Austin moves too fast and assumes that everyone can keep up.  It will give you a workout if you don't throw your back out in the process.  I have other Denise Austin tapes that I like...but this one is not one I'd recommend.,1005696000,,321,4.316666666666666
73602,5,0784017875,"This is a great 45 minute workout!  Love it!  I would highly recommend this video.  I have really noticed a big difference in the strength in my legs.  Can't say enough about it, I was at a sort of stand still - ya know bored with the usual same thing every day workout.  Then I incorporated this into my weekly workouts and wow! It really helped me combat the monotony in my workout routine!",1002844800,,392,4.243243243243243
73603,4,0784017875,This is great for anyone with any kind of kickboxing experience.  It is easy to follow and leaves you feeling great in the end.  The music is kind of lame but it is great for someone starting to get in shape or looking for a change in work out routine.,994032000,,252,4.02
73604,1,0784017875,The box says you don't need to have kickboxing experience but what it doesn't say is that it's very difficult unless you are in perfect shape!  I have been working out since January and have lost 43 lbs.  I love to exercise but I could not keep up!  I wish I knew it was that intense.  I guess I'll save it for next year - maybe I can do it then!,991353600,,346,3.8309859154929575
73605,2,0784017875,"I have most of Denise's tapes and was really disappointed by this one.  Kickboxing is definately not something she does well.  Her techniques are poor and the routines are too.  She should stick to what she knows (aerobics) and not try to ""jump on board"" a trend.  I do have about 20 of Billy Blanks workouts, and love them.  If you want a good Denise Austin tape, stick to her ""hit the spot"" and ""gold"" series.  Their definately the way to go.",978048000,3,444,4.353658536585366
7790818,5,0784017875,"I love this workout, short and sweet, but if you're using proper form you're going to find your abs fast! I do this workout as well as Austin's Pilates workout and it's the perfect combo for keeping my core strong.",1525305600,,214,4.375

7790825,5,0784017875,"This is hands done my favorite/most effective (condensed) overall body workout of all time!
Denise offers two 20 minute workouts here.
1)Introduction (beginners do this first)
2)2o minutes of sweat, strengthing, cardio, flexibility and balance.

This done twice a week alone or combined with walking, gym workouts, or other videos will work even faster.

Denise Austin is effective because she gives you workouts that are 4 people who -
* Don't have alot of time
* Hate Working out
* Are fit but need to change things up now and then
* Multiple uses! U can do 20 minutes of her Power Kick Boxing and then a 10 or 20 minute stretching or yoga tape/dvd of hers. You can always mix and match

*I was in very good shape as a professional Boradcaster, spokesperson and model. Still, this tape had me whooped at first. Don't give up, please. After each workout you'll get stronger and more fit, promise. Just do the best u can at your level and you'll soon find how far u have improved.

""Power Yoga Plus""  is second all time fav! Two 20 minute workouts. 1- Yoga that strengthens, releases tension, makes u sweat and stretches areas you didn't even know existed. All that in 20 minutes! The Pilates segment is similar and you'll find some days you do both.

Denis Austin is Queen because she shows that exercise does not have to B dreadful.  All of her workouts are designed to keep u from giving up. Thats why she makes them 10, 20, 30 minutes long most of the time. You will feel powerful mastering the moves after just two weeks.

There are alot of great wokrout videos and personalities but Denise gets it! You may take to her or not but there is no denying her success and sales. Most videos I just don't enjoy because they are too extreme, long, don't hold my attention etc.. I do have some others I do like alot though.

I luv my denise Austin workouts combined with gym workouts, 30 min to one hour cardio sessions.

It's 2012 and her VHS and DVDs are still relevent! Check your local cable, DirectTV, Dish or exercise channel to see if they are re-running her daily workout tv series. ""Getting Fit"" with Denise Austin I recently taped over 40 episodes on my DVR and then you can save them to dvd.

I do wish she would offer ALL of her old VHS series on DVD.

Hope this helps and good luck everyone

There is no magic pill for fitness or weight loss but you can attack it withouth feeling or being overwhelmed.

7790826,5,0784017875,"This is my favorite cardio kickbox workout.  High energy, high impact translates to lots of sweating, fat and calorie burn.  It works, and it's fun.  I usually do levels 1 and 2 consecutively, but you could always stick with level 1 for a while if you're new to working out, before moving on to level 2.

Denise Austin is a fun workout trainer/personality - encouraging and sweet, very perky.  But do not underestimate this workout, it will kick your butt!",1324339200,,456,4.65
