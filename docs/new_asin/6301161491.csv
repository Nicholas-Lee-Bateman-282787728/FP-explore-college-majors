This is another weird Dutch film which will either satisfy or not, depending on your weirdness quotient.  Totally bizarre, a woman detrains from a passenger car in the middle of nowhere and by the time she realizes here mistake, the train has pulled out and stranded her there.  The only other person is a switchman (the pointsman) who lives in a station house for the track switching point.  No other trains come by, slowly the days pass, the seasons change and still she is there, enduring the Pointsman and a few other occasional persons of no identifiable purpose, who nevertheless drift into the plot from time to time.  Time passes, she endures.  There are two different endings.  The VHS tape ending is totally surreal, like something out of Dali, while the DVD alternate ending is toned down quite a bit.  Of course I prefer the original ending.

If you like totally strange movies, this one's for you.",1458000000,,1044,4.625
