6401496,5,B00K2OBRVU,One of the most important films of our time - Edward Burtynsky and Jennifer Baichwal again hit the ball out of the park with another hard-hitting expose' and glimpse into the mind of an artistic genius. This film should be required viewing for anyone concerned with water conservation.,1430179200,,285,4.958333333333333

6401499,2,B00K2OBRVU,"Disappointing, I expected better. I didn't even finish watching it, because it was so boring. I expected more cool images, etc. it's message was poignant though.",1415664000,,161,5.230769230769231
6401500,5,B00K2OBRVU,"Stunningly beautiful and powerful images highlight this examination of how mankind re-shapes water and how it flows  for good and ill, more often ill - and in turn how the water re-shapes civilization and human behavior.

There's no real story, just a series of visits to locations around the world where water powerfully interacts with humanity, like the pilgrimage of 30 million people to bathe in the Ganges river.

Without narration and a specific focus the film could be accused of being too diffuse. But for me the raw power of the images  Burtynsky is one of our greatest still photographers who has spent much of his career creating huge images of humans and nature clashing and interacting - give the piece a poetic, if not literal, power and solidity. The film manages to be a wake-up call about our use and abuse of water while rarely giving in to traditional lecturing.  It trusts us to look into its images and interpret for ourselves.

Also, if the film is not enough, there's an almost 40 minute gallery of Burtynsky's amazing still images, which look great blown up on a HD set, as he explains the photographs and how they were taken. That extra alone is reason enough to own the blu-ray. It's like the world's best photography book, with the images at least a little closer in size to Burtynsky's massive prints.",1414800000,5,1329,4.706896551724138
6401501,1,B00K2OBRVU,"waste of time and film .... shallow, superficial, crass treatment of an incredibly critical subject....not much here other than super deluxe photography that anyone can do with a good camera...the crew should have enlisted a scientific consultant or two with wisdom and knowledge, with an ecologist, watershed expert and a few knowledgeable environmentalists....then we should have something significant...as it is, this is a touristic, paparazzi meandering from spot to spot, literally worthless....",1414627200,,500,5.958333333333333
6401502,1,B00K2OBRVU,"Very bad, boring film on water issues on our planet.",1410652800,3,52,4.3

6401504,3,B00K2OBRVU,"Water is the most importance source of life for us that is under siege today from pollution and other man-made disasters. So how could a documentary about something so important be so...boring?  It's almost as if the film makers decided to take all the real-life examples of how water impacts our daily lives and make them as uninteresting as possible.  I normally love this type of documentaries, but this one didn't quite engage me.",1404950400,4,434,4.851351351351352
6401505,5,B00K2OBRVU,"What can you say about an artist with such a talent except having the opportunity to enjoy his work time after time. Every shot in this DVD and picture in his book is a masterpiece with a story that I can glare for hours and hours. This is his best work only if you happen to love water and ocean as much as I do as a surfer. Thjorsa River in Iceland, what a color combo, shocking. Bravo.",1400025600,4,388,3.9871794871794872
8655357,3,B00K2OBRVU,"Features a series of water-related images with locals giving a monolog about their situation/existence. Does not explain how they are all connected. Includes poverty, pollution, and a surreal spiritual sacrament.  Building of dams appears to be part of the problems. Does not appear to offer any ideas for a solutions.",1491782400,,318,5.36
8655358,5,B00K2OBRVU,"A must own DVD for me. Serene, beautiful, calming, inspiring. This is amazing to watch or to put on in the background while studying, reading or whatever.",1491264000,,154,4.7407407407407405
8655359,5,B00K2OBRVU,"More a meditation than a documentary, ""Watermark"" takes the viewer on a world tour of places where mankind has had a profound effect on the world's surface through the redirectlion and manipulation of water.  Much of what we see is based on the work of photographer&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Edward-Burtynsky/dp/3869306793/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Edward Burtynsky</a>, who specializes in high-resolution, high-altitude views of human activity that verge on the abstract without quite crossing the line into pure texture and color.  There's little in the way of the exposition found in a typical documentary; the people we meet share their impressions of the vast forces that have shaped the area they live in, as if these industrial projects are aspects of the natural world.

Stunningly beautiful yet at the same time disturbing, ""Watermark"" showcases our awesome responsibilty in our relationship with the planet.",1483228800,3,967,6.095588235294118
8655360,5,B00K2OBRVU,"This is a beautiful movie. There is little dialog. It is very interesting to examine water, something that is such an integral part of our lives.  studied water with minimal commentary, and realized how critical it is in our lives. The photography is stunning, and watching this move is very relaxing.",1480032000,,301,4.901960784313726
8655361,5,B00K2OBRVU,"Wonderful.  Beautiful.  Please watch this and then start thinking about your water use differently.  We started watering all our trees and plants by hand; we turned off the sprinkler system.  Our plants are doing better, our water usage is down and it's just the beginning (I hope) for us.",1470700800,,289,4.836734693877551
8655362,5,B00K2OBRVU,This documentary involved the viewer in a larger context of looking at water as a global community issue.,1461628800,,105,4.888888888888889
8655363,2,B00K2OBRVU,"The photographs are oustanding,but there are very little explanations/commentaries,which makes the documentary dull ,possibly because its target are specialists on the subject.
The diretor of the documentary should follow the examples of the documentaries produced by NATGEO, Discovery Channel,etc

8655364,5,B00K2OBRVU,Wonderful images.  I had seen his exhibit at a local museum and was impressed.  I was great to see how he made the great images.  Wonderful and interesting to most.,1436140800,,164,4.4
8655365,3,B00K2OBRVU,The images in this movie are stunning.  However there is no narration and that makes it feel disjointed. At least to me it did. You would be a dam and then you would switch to a printers place.  Where I think the author the book 'Watermark'  was going over his photographs.  I suppose this is  like a video version of that book.  Water in it's many forms is pictured here and sometimes we have people talking to the filmmakers as well. We see the horrible disaster of man's misuse of water and then the good things it brings as well.  It's interesting and very well filmed but I wish they would have stated what the mission statement was.  I am only assuming that this is a video version of the book.  I don't know for sure.  It's a interesting film but not,1430870400,3,757,4.267605633802817
