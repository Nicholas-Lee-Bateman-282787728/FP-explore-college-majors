It's so flawless you almost believe the film to be over-rated. While I'm certain most will feel the story is too fairy-tale-ish and cornball to like, I felt the narrative and driving force worked well enough. The transition and timeline are well-planned. And the tiny bits of emotion and despair that occur at times are heart-wrenching. Those who hated Amelie, won't like this very much either. IT's very french. And it's a beautiful story for me. simple but makes an impact, like a silent explosion. i'd recommend it w/ the full knowledge that some will really hate it. :)",1025222400,4,724,4.894308943089431

Other than some sharp dialogue the story is simply a ""Rube Goldberg"" vehicle to facilitate the preordained, and rather off putting, ending.

So many times, you would think they could avoid doing it haphazardly.  Too many storylines, too few clear characters, too many loose ends.  And in the end, I was so ready for this movie to be over that I couldn't have cared less whether the young lovers wound up together.

Synopsis: Andrey Tautou stars as [Irene] a pleasant young girl with a friendly face about to begin her first day at a new job. While riding the subway on her way to work a stranger asks for the date of her birth and reads her horoscope to her. According to the stars she will discover her soul mate before the day is over. However her true love can only be encountered after a series of bizarre and seemingly unconnected events must take place in order to allow their meeting to occur.

Critique: Released in '00 `Happenstance' is an enjoyable, though somewhat uneven film that explores the myriad of choices, and unplanned occurrences that can unknowingly alter our lives and destinies. The movie takes the audience on a sometimes whimsical, sometimes quirky journey through a day in the life of several individuals showing how the most simple of actions can create a myriad of repercussions in the lives of the characters of the film.

You will probably find watching this film a fairly pleasant way to while away an evening as you follow the string of ""what if's"" leading to an infinite number of possible conclusion. There are moments of greatness overflowing with profound and memorable conversation scattered throughout the film. There are also however some spotty moments here and there serving as nothing more than filler material pushing the storyline forward until the next great moment comes along. My favorite sequences in the film involve the appearance of an unnamed character referred to in the credits as ""The Destiny Man"" played by Gilbert Robin. When he's on screen the dialogue is fascinating but these moments are too short and not quite often enough.

1691117,1,B000063K0U,"Audrey Tautou hardly says three words in this movie even though she is prominently featured on the cover.  The movie is obliquely about her character, but she is on screen for ten minutes or so.  It reminded me of a cross between Amelie and the Richard Linklater movie Slacker, but with none of the charm of the former and none of the character of the latter.  Most of the characters are losers, but instead of being loveable, interesting losers, you keep hoping that one or more of them will get hit by a bus or something.  The only one to root for is Audrey Tautou, but her fate is decided by some idiot throwing stones at a statue in a park, so there's no point in hoping.

Most importantly: while this movie is rated R, it is for a pointless scene of unflattering full frontal nudity of a man, and the actresses who would have been quite appealing in some stage of dishabille remain fully clothed.  That alone is reason to get your money back.",1169164800,6,947,4.382857142857143
1691118,1,B000063K0U,"Witty.  Quirky.  Genuine.  Surreal.  Butterfly wings?  One could ask what all of these words best describe, and some (those in fuse with the international film community) may quickly say Happenstance, but others may jump aboard the more American train and immediately yell, The Butterfly Effect.  Strangely, I would be one of those screaming for that sci-fi Kutcher film mainly because none of those words that I initially mentioned at the start of this paragraph accurately depicts the Tautou feature that I witnessed.  Sure, we all loved her in Amelie and thought she was the daughter of Jesus in The Da Vinci Code, but in this film first-time director (of a feature film at least) Laurent Firode doesn't give Tautou the opportunity to shine.  Sadly, he gives nobody the opportunity to really demonstrate themselves because he is too delicately caught up in the moments of ""random chance"" to bring this film to anything but just a shimmer (never a true boil).  Firode has ample, and I use ""ample"" as a small word, moments throughout this film where he could have built us a fantastical story, a genuinely whimsical fairy-tale of love and coincidence, but instead he fell face-first into a mud-bucket of chaotic intertwining that overwhelmed us with inconsistent characters and a story that left us gasping for less.

Tautou's beautiful face adorns the cover of this box, but do not be so taken immediately as I did in assuming that this was going to be another monumental journey into Tautou's French cinema.  Tautou is in this film, do not get me wrong, but one could argue that she is not at the center of this story.  Firode's job is to create a series of random events that eventually will lead to an audience friendly (albeit confusing) ending which exemplifies that meaning of refreshing ""melodrama"".  He utterly, utterly fails.  Firode fails by giving us, the audience, too many characters.  With too many characters he gives us too many random interventions, and by the end you don't really care who is who, or what is what, or how is how; your main focus happens to be centered solely on the ending credits and the time destination of their arrival.  Tautou could have saved this film from the disaster it was if only Firode would have given her the center.  Alas, he did not, but attempted to seemingly force a group of 12 through a theoretical film hole about the size of a penny.  It just didn't work and we were left with a jam in which we were completely stuck.

Firode fails because he focus' so intently on the minor details that, for one of those rare film occurrences, he actually forgets the central focus.  I can say that there was no defined central focus to Happenstance.  In the beginning he attempts to create one with our two supposed main characters discovering that they share the same birthday and their horoscope promises love by the moonlight, but we never go back to that throughout the film.  Instead, again, we are bombarded with new characters, stuffy scenes, and meaningless drivel obviously chosen to direct us away from an actual story and more into a world full of ""ifs, ands, and buts"".  I couldn't do it.  I couldn't believe this film.  Writer Firode (yes, the same guy directing this garbage) uses a technique so primitive in this film that I immediately felt like ending it immediately.  He must have been assuming that many of us were incapable of actually following the storyline (or the scientific premise) because he grabs the aid of a homeless person to actually fill in the respective blanks.  I didn't need this, nor do I think Firode needed to belittle his audience in this matter.  While there were other elements that just didn't seem to work for me at all (again, felt like a jumbled Parisian collage of shredded paper), this was the icing on the cake.  I don't need my hand held through films.

I will give this film one star for credit.  This is a rather difficult genre to master successfully.  Time travel films are especially hard because of the innumerable amounts of possibilities that are never accounted for, but with Happenstance it works because Firode semi-explores the different avenues.  While I will counter with saying that he does not do it well, it did make for at least five full minutes of enjoyment.  I liked where Firode was headed with this film, he had a genuinely diagramed story, but the final execution just blew this film to shreds.  Firode could have saved this film if he would have strengthened his characters, while lightening up his premise and story.  I think my overall mood of this film would have changed if just these two simple directions were taken.  Oh, how I only wish I could time travel back to the production of this film to show Firode the errors of his ways.

Overall, for the first time (and probably last), this was a Tautou film that I must say utterly disappointed me.  From the choppy opening to the apathetic ending, I just felt that Happenstance failed due to Firode's leadership and horrid marketing.  Marketing is something that I didn't mention before, but why would anyone purchase this film thinking that it was an Amelie 2 (per the title released in Hong Kong), and why would you place Tautou squarely on the cover knowing full well that she wasn't carrying this film at all.  I believe that from the first minute that passed on my DVD player, this film was in shambles.  While I will applaud his subject, everything else was well below the level of mediocrity.  I cannot suggest this film to anyone.

Audrey Tautou is her usual brilliant self as a young girl who sets out on a Metro one day, for work, only to have her entire life change because of the actions of other people. Tautou loses her job and the day spirals into more of the same leaving her deflated and without hope, but on her way out of Paris things begin to change and another great French film is born.

This film is filled with a cast of interesting characters who manage to change and shape the lives of the strangers around them. A dirty bum falls at someone's feet, a married man bases his decision to tell his wife on a skipping stone, chocolate and coffee even have their own distinct roles.

Mixed within all of the sweetness of this film is the subtle message of cause and affect. In the matter of a day each and every person causes a reaction based upon their own actions. It is an interesting concept to ponder because it shows how the world is tied together as one whether we like it or not. But the best thing about this movie is that it conveys the fact that even on our worst days, where nothing seems to go right, we all have something interesting waiting for us around the bend and under the watchful eye of a bright full moon that shines the world over.",1091491200,6,1337,4.276679841897233

1691125,3,B000063K0U,"A film by Laurent Firode
There is an idea that life is made up of a serious of coincidences and that any small action can have a wide ranging effect and connection to the lives of various people in ways that we cannot even imagine.  Little events can affect big events even though the two are not truly related, at least not in any way that we can directly see.  It is like the butterfly in Egypt flapping its wings and causing a hurricane over the Pacific Ocean.  This is the overriding idea of ""Happenstance"".
The movie opens with Irene (Audrey Tautou) on the subway.  A lady sitting across from her is reading Irene's horoscope and tells Irene that soon she will meet her soul mate.  Irene gets off the train and the scene changes.  From here we are brought into the lives of multiple people (men and women) living in Paris.  We see their actions and how their actions affect each other.  Even though Irene opens and closes this film, it is not truly about her and she is a more minor character than I had expected (or hoped).
It is interesting to see how all these lives intersect and affect each other, but even with the ending wrapping things up, ""Happenstance"" did not feel like it truly amounted to much, or did a good enough job making me care about any of the characters (except Irene, but that may be because of Tautou).  It was difficult for me to engage with any of the characters, or find any of them memorable (though some of the intersecting events I can remember, but not the characters themselves).
The best I can say is that ""Happenstance"" was just okay.  Despite Tautou being all over the cover/poster for this film, she is not the star, this is a true ensemble piece.  The ensemble just didn't add up to a strong whole.

1691126,4,B000063K0U,"The film _Happenstance_ investigates how one small, seemingly meaningless event, can change the lives of many others.  The script weaves a large web, with few degrees of seperation between the characters.  There are no ""main"" characters in the film, because each story is so interlocked with the others.  The French title of the film translates to ""The Beating of the Butterfly's Wings"", and it is unclear why they changed the title for the American release. The word ""Happenstance"" does not come up in any conversation in the movie, however a major scene in the movie discusses the butterfly's wings.
Audrey Tautou's face is on the DVD cover, (not even a picture from this movie, I might add) and it is clear that the American marketing firms wanted to show off Tautou and use her recent fame to attract attention.  While I think it is misleading to plaster her picture on the front when there are many other deserving actors in this movie, the marketing did work for me:  I would not have found this movie had I not seen Audrey's face advertising it.
A fun and rewarding film that is sure to leave a smile on your face.",1082764800,4,1121,4.641414141414141
1691127,5,B000063K0U,"In the middle of Happenstance, aka Le Battement d'Aile du Papillon, (The Fluttering of a Butterfly's Wings), the bald-headed man of destiny, a mysterious man gifted with precognition, tells a man throwing pebbles and hitting a weird metallic sculpture in a park, to deliberately miss it.  He does.  What happens?  Richard, a man sitting nearby at the bench opposite, decides not to tell his lover that he's told his wife about them.  The point is that every insignificant action, however small, affects the course of everyone else, with people choosing one of an infinite number of choices, like a parallel universe where each universe is different because of a variation in choice.  Does this mean then that we can change history, or that we can shape it?  It all goes back to chaos theory, with that famous example of how a butterfly's wings fluttering eventually cause a hurricane.
Laurent Firode's creative and philosophical debut film examines that theme via a plethora of characters, who affect the destiny of other people without knowing it.  Take Richard.  He has decided to leave his wife and child and settle down with his lover.  Trouble is, he's indecisive and weak to the point that he makes his decisions based on what other people do.  At a cafe, he looks at Luc at a nearby table and decides if Luc eats his chocolate, he will tell his wife he's leaving her.  He might as well ask someone to flip a coin for him, but he's too afraid to do that.
And Luc, one of the more interesting people here, is a man of thirty, still being cared for by his mother, immature and a man of inaction.  He just sits there at a metro bench as a bum collapses from illness.  A Moroccan or Algerian berates him for not doing anything and is arrested for attacking a policeman at that subway.  He's taken before Luc's mother!  Luc though, has a penchant for being inactive, and later, telling people he did positive things other people did, or reversing roles so that he's the more important person.
Audrey Tautou, star of Amelie, doesn't have much screen time, but her salesclerk character, Irene, is a more brooding character, whose day, which begins with a woman telling her horoscope, that she will meet her true love.  However, something happens to her involving a red-jacketed man who not only meets Luc's grandmother, returning a broken coffee machine, but who has previously met Luc and Richard.  Unknown to her, a young Algerian business owner has the luck to have been born the same day as Irene.  And guess what having the same horoscope means for the two?
Think of many dots, each representing a person, and lines that connect the dots.  One can thus form an indirect link from Person A to Person B, whether the path be two degrees of separation, A-C-B or seven A-H-E-L-C-G-F-B.
But it makes one wonder is it choice or luck that shapes one's life?  Firode makes it clear that predestination is not involved, but that it's an individual choice that shape that individual's destiny and that of others, like a rock thrown into a pool--the larger the rock, the larger the ripples, the larger the consequences.  A thought-provoking film that bears watching over and over.",1081468800,,3172,4.7309090909090905
1691128,4,B000063K0U,"You know the old saying about the ""butterfly effect,"" that the beating of a butterfly's wings can set off a storm over the Amazon jungle. That idea is half the basis of ""Happenstance"" (original title: ""Le Battement d'ailes du papillon"" -- more on butterflies), a sweet little French bit of froth that will leave you warm and fuzzy.
Irne (Audrey Tautou) is on the subway to her job when a woman doing surveys tell her the horoscope: She will meet her true love that day. The handsome young man, Youns (Faudel) who sees her, has the same birthday and same horoscope. Coincidence? There is no such thing in this film. Elsewhere, an indecisive man promises his mistress Elsa that he will tell his wife that he wants a divorce.
Fallen leaves, tossed stones, discarded sneakers, a mugger's yellow jacket,  heads of lettuce, Algerian sand, uneaten chocolates and nose injuries all affect Irne and the people who brush by her in everyday life. After the end of that fateful day, nobody's life will be quite the same. Some people will come home, some will make break up, some will miss dates, and some will live happily ever after.
""Sliding Doors"" was a shaky but interesting romantic comedy, and ""Run Lola Run"" was frenetic and full of visual gimmicks. But the slower-paced, more forthright ""Happenstance"" may be the most interesting look at how little things can change our lives -- it's not just one person's life, with a few people affected around him or her. Instead, it's a dozen or so, whose lives change for better or worse because of little things.
What little things? A head of lettuce falls off a truck and causes a bike crash. A pebble fails to get through a modern sculpture, causing a man to lie to his mistress.  A thousand little innocent events cause major changes in people's lives. But above the idea of chaos theory is the concept of fate and karma: You know that forces are slowly driving Irne and her soulmate together. A few bad things may happen to the two future lovers along the way, but they are just stepping stones.
Cinematography is nothing special, but nice and somehow makes Paris look like more than a postcard, with the subways, grubby side streets and sparkling night skies. The intricate script is bound to trip itself up a few times. A couple of storylines are left mildly unresolved. And perhaps the most intriguing character -- the enigmatic ""Destiny Man"", who seems to be all-knowing -- appears once and then never again. How does he know other people's plans and secrets? We're never told. (Maybe the guy is supposed to be God)
Tautou displays a different kind of acting from the charming ""Amelie."" Here, she's more downbeat and outspoken, but gradually softens as she comes to realize that things don't happen purely by accident. Faudel is a good counterpart to Tautou, quiet and unassuming, but quite sweet. The dozens of supporting actors are given less to do, but are charming too.
Do you believe in fate and true love, that somehow you'll be drawn together with your soulmate, the one meant specially for you? If you do (even a little bit), then ""Happenstance"" will charm you.",1076371200,10,3113,4.731123388581952

The problem lies with the U.S. marketing approach to this movie, which is a complete hack and an affront to any moviegoer's intelligence.
First - there's the marketers' blatant attempt to hitch a ride on the contrails of the Audrey Tautou/Amelie phenomenon.  For example, while the cover box features nothing but a pigtailed, doe-eyed Tautou, the movie is anything but a Tautou star vehicle.  Granted, she's in the first scene, but she disappears for stretches of up to 15 minutes at a time.  'Happenstance' - released in 2000 - was pre-'Amelie,' and Tautou is just part of the woodwork here.
Second - and more egregious - the cover box picture of Tautou isn't even from the movie itself.  It's been lifted directly from the cover box of 1999's 'Venus Beauty Institute' (check it yourself with an amazon.com search).  Now, why would anyone reward behavior like this by recommending 'Happenstance' to a friend?

In return, her friendly fellow commuter reads Irene her horoscope from the newspaper and remarks that she'll find her soulmate before the day's end. Why? Because there's a full moon that evening. After Irene gets off the train, a handsome young man, who until now hasn't said a word, remarks to the news reader that he too has the same birthday. Right there the viewer can surmise the film's conclusion.
Irene only seems the lead because she begins and ends the film. In between, she's one of a cast of many unremarkable characters whose lives intersect through a series of minor random events, causing them to make decisions and take actions that lead, like a Rube Goldberg apparatus, to the final denouement. And we're not talking earthshaking events either. Leaves of lettuce fall off the back of a delivery truck. A half-eaten macaroon cookie is thrown into the street. A small cockroach crawls into a woman's handbag. A pigeon drops a big one on a couple's photo album. A package is abandoned on the Metro platform. A cafe customer decides not to eat a chocolate candy. A pebble is thrown from a balcony. Algerian sand imported by an illegal immigrant blows from a window.
The concept of HAPPENSTANCE is an interesting one, but, the ending being a foregone conclusion, no more profound than if I wonder what would have happened had I eaten chunky peanut butter instead of smooth back on October 17, 1964. And fans of Tautou's AMELIE may be disappointed in her Irene character, who's not only very ordinary, but sometimes cranky and rude (just like the rest of us).
While not eliciting an ""Oh, wow!"" from this viewer, HAPPENSTANCE is a respectably clever, gentle, well-acted, and deftly choreographed film that deserves to be rented for a quiet evening of contemplative, home viewing. And Audrey  has those enormous, brown eyes that could melt linoleum!",1058918400,4,2443,4.775413711583925
1691136,4,B000063K0U,"Like many who've been caught under the immaculate spell of the charming and talented French actress, Ms. Audrey Tautou of Amelie, I too have begun my own personal obsession of searching and exploring her other works.
Happenstance is my second film after Amelie, and judging from other reviews, I was to expect a much smaller film in scope. And that basically what Happenstance is. It may not be as elaborate or artistic as Amelie, but it's a wonderfully fun film nontheless. It involves a number of varying characters and the actions they take throughout the movie have adverse effects on each other, which make for a cleverly fabricated plot that jumps you from character to character. The story itself, is not heavy or thick by any means mind you, but rather it allows the audience to follow these characters from different points of views and how the role of chance plays between these characters. And it's one of those movies where you can go back through it again and again and pick up important plot subtelties that you may have missed the first time through.
Audrey Tautou may not have too much of a presense in the movie as some may have hoped for (that would include myself), but she does do a terrific job playing her part nontheless. With so many characters to take in, there was only so much time given to Audrey (and any character for that matter). Also, for people expecting to see the same starry eyed and cheerfully adorable Audrey from Amelie, will find Happenstance a joyous treat. She smiles a lot less in this movie than in Amelie but her charm is still as evident as ever.
Again, it's a small film, and may appear very simple on the surface, but some who are willing to take a deeper look, will probably find its brilliantly crafted intricacies underneath. It might have been unfair to compare Happenstance with Amelie, but since the cover of the DVD shouts out loud ""the star of Amelie,"" it was inevitable to measure the two. It may also be helpful to note that I did hold a much greater appreciation for the movie on my second time through, partly due because I had to watch the crummy VHS version, but mainly because I picked up more things that I hadn't before. Anyone that likes a good romantic comedy should definitely check this movie out if your interested at all, and if you're an Audrey fan, there's no reason why you shouldn't be watching this now. It's a fun and entertaining movie at heart that I definitely recommend.",1043971200,39,2452,4.613272311212815
1691137,4,B000063K0U,"This is the question at the center of this film.  It is a light, but very thoughtful little film that looks at lives of 6 major characters and how their ""inconsequential"" actions alter their, and others', fates at every turn.  Audrey Tautou is great, but so are many others.  You'll have to see it multiple times to pick up on some of the nuances, but it is definitely worth it.  I am buying this one.",1043625600,2,401,4.306666666666667
1691138,5,B000063K0U,"Yes, I have to say it: ""Happenstance"" (the original French title is ""The Beating of a Butterfly's Wings,"" referring to chaos theory) bears certain resemblances to the charming ""Amlie."" The most obvious comparison is that it stars Audrey Tautou, the wide-eyed innocent beauty from ""Amlie."" It, like ""Amlie,"" takes place in Paris and follows the lives of a group of people whose lives are intertwined by fate. The comparison ends there. ""Happenstance"" is difficult to categorize: it has elements of romance, humour, quiet desperation, racism, and the dark side of human nature. None of the small coincidences ever seems forced, no matter how trivial the first event nor how grand the repercussion may be. We meet people from all walks of life: an ill homeless man, a compulsive liar, a thief, Gypsy fortune tellers, sales clerks, a cheating husband and his mistress, an Algerian looking for true love after hearing his horoscope (played by gorgeous and talented ra singer Faudel). The smallest things in our lives can determine the course of events: throwing or not throwing a pebble, dropping a crumpled newspaper ad from a pocket, a cockroach crawling into a purse, hence the chaos theory, which is explained by one of the characters in the film. It's sort of a cycle of karma, if you will. Do something good for someone, and it will come back to you. Bear them a grudge and...well, I for one will always think twice about coffees in cafes after seeing Youns' revenge. The numerous subplots can be a bit confusing at times, as can the flashbacks, but ""Happenstance"" is a charming film that is worth the time.

While Tautou was great, the movie was slow and I was bored.  The story just wasn't as riveting or enjoyable as I had hoped.  My friend's DVD player was on the fritz and we had problems watching the movie, so we ended up skipping ahead to the last chapter to see what the outcome was.

These actions effect other events taking place in the city of Paris where Irne lives and they will lead Irne to her love.

7959548,3,B000063K0U,"SPOILER ALERT! My initial expectations of disappointment never fully came to fruition since this movie turned out to be better than some reviews suggested. In fact, my inclination to skip this one after the first few scenes quickly fizzled into an enjoyable excursion of dramatic intrigue. Even though this film delved deeply into how some people place their reliance about their mortal futures in the hands of either some ancient superstition (astrology) or on the outcome of some random occurrence dictated either by the arbitrary whims of chance or by the predetermined will of fate, I tended to focus more upon another theme that to me was just as prevalent and less controversial. What I am referring to here is the philosophical view as to how all of our lives are interconnected in ways we cannot quite fathom and might never fully comprehend...how no person can escape the benefits or the penalties that may come as a result of relationship to other persons. I will not give any specific examples from the movie since the journey it offers the viewer is one that involves slowly unfolding the connectedness of seemingly unconnected people and events. If I connected the dots about connectedness for you, where would be the fun (for you) in that? So I guess you could say that this movie validated some of my philosophical views: I believe that there is an organic unity in the universes of time and space which seems to underlie the whole fabric of cosmic events, inexplicably manifested ever and anon by what appears to be an amazingly fortuitous co-ordination of apparently unrelated universe happenings. I am also inclined to believe that it is this far-flung and generally unrecognizable control of the co-ordination and interassociation of all phases and forms of universe activity that causes such a variegated and apparently hopelessly confused medley of physical, mental, moral and spiritual phenomena so unerringly to work out to the glory of God and for the good of men and women and angels...but not always for the good of a bug (in this case, one who had a walk-on role but whose agent forgot to include a tiny clause in his contract that specified enabling this creepy-cute character-actor to walk off the set in the same healthy condition he was in when he crawled forth onto it to shoot his final scene...and to make matters worse, no listing in the opening credits, no ""IN MEMORY OF"" dedication at the end and worst of all, no favorable recognition from the Academy for opting to do all his own stunts).",1331251200,,2527,4.865429234338747

7959550,3,B000063K0U,"After havine recently watching ""Amelie"" with Audrey Tautou, I set out to find other films she's done and came across this one.
It had some pretty good reviews, so I took a chance and ordered it.
After having watched it, I'll probably be donating it to my library and gettng rid of it. It's not a horrible movie, but it really didn't impress me much.
None of the actors really made me feel anything for them, and since I mainly got it for Adurey Tautou I was particularly disappointed with her character. She doesn't have a big part in this movie and when she is in it, she's just seems to be standing there while things happen.

The premise of the film leads you to believe ""what if THIS happened, instead of THAT"", but they really don't explore the different possibilites that could happen. The movie just rolls along doing it's thing until it's over with.
I've seen quite a few foreign films so I understand that they aren't like our American ""Hollywood"" films, but this film left me without even wanting to think about it afterwards. I was just glad it was over so I could take it out of my player and watch something else.

If you like Audrey Tautou, this really isn't a great showcase for her acting abilites.
If you like movies that explore the ""what if"" aspect of certain actions and their consequences, this doesn't really play out like that.
I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, actually. I just didn't find it to be as good as I was lead to believe.",1296086400,,1464,4.458955223880597
