2679761,5,B000JVT074,"(I'm reposting my review because it did not post when I wrote my original - I've already ordered my copy and so should you!)
Okay, so I was looking for a cool dvd to project at my christmas party - I just bought a new projector and thought it would be cool to mix it up a bit at the party. I wanted something soothing and chic and not too distracting.  I thought I should look for a lava lamp or something like that, then I saw a BORING dvd with a lava lamp on it and I was disappointed a bit, really, I could just aim one of my cameras at a lamp and let it go all night - no fun and a bit lame.
But then I came across this Vjworld lava bubbles that was AWESOME, it looks like it fills the entire screen - its totally different and full of color, exactly what I wanted. I can't wait to show it at my bash - my friends are going to be so into it!
Oh and the best part? IT IS AFFORDABLE!!!!!
I want to see what else this Vjworld company puts out - they are doing some really cool stuff.  Yeah, I want more Vjworld and you should too! Cheers!",1164412800,7,1039,3.827906976744186

8153396,5,B000JVT074,Great as background when friends round or relaxing effect when on your own looks great on my 50in tv be good for parties too.,1325030400,,125,4.25
8153397,5,B000JVT074,"Lava bubbles is just what is describes, video of lava lamp bubbles, nothing more.
But if you are looking for background video for a party or dance event, then this is perfect. Lava bubbles has various video loops of different colored lava lamps.
They run in 5 or 10 minute loops and give you the choice of choosing one color for 5 to 10 minutes, or all loops for 5 to 10 minutes. The loops are continuous and do not stop until you press stop on the dvd player. These loops look great on a large TV or projection system. Even if you only have a small TV this is a great buy and safer than a real lava lamp. If you have never owned a real lava lamp, then you do not know of the cons of owning one. Real lava lamps run very hot and cause fires if left on overnight. Plus they take about an hour to heat up the wax inside the bottles. Last a real lava lamp begins to break down the wax into tiny bubbles the longer it runs. Those huge neat looking waves of wax start to get smaller and smaller the hotter the wax gets. Plus they are made of glass, the worst thing to have at a party. So save yourself some money on that next 60's party and just pick up this really groovy dvd.",1282089600,,1172,3.991489361702128
8153398,5,B000JVT074,"This DVD is fun for a 70s party or just a night of nostalgia. There are six loops which you can loop separately or in 5 minute or ten minute segments. All of which will loop continually. There is no sound track which is probably just as well since who likes the same music from the 70s? But the segments don't cross dissolve into one another, they just freeze for half a second and the next color of lava bubbles starts. Some of the colors (like the aqua and yellow bubbles) seem like they are not true colors but have been manipulated in an editing program. This manipulation has made the shadowy parts look somewhat dirty (since probably they inverted the image and made a negative version of the original colors, that is, the highlights are inverted shadows and vice versa with the shadows). But most of the colors are fine. Another negative is the resolution. You can clearly see jaggies on screen. But it is difficult to mark where the quality begins and the cheesiness ends with lava bubbles, right?

I still give the DVD five stars because it is a good price and probably few people will notice these flaws. However, if someone came out with a good quality version I would buy it instead.",1268352000,3,1195,4.506912442396313
8153399,3,B000JVT074,"Lava Bubbles is a cool concept, but doesn't quite live up to my expectations.  Being someone who's always been into psychedelic and relaxing things, I was really looking forward to seeing this on my big screen TV.  Unfortunately, the image quality of the lava flowing on the screen is slighty grainy or pixelated, so the ""realness"" factor isn't there.  Luckily, I have WinDVD which is one of the only programs that can upscale the graphics/images, so I'm able to clean up the look of the lava to the point where it's near impossible to really notice the pixelation that would normally be there.

If you have a DVD player that can upscale it, or if you have software like WinDVD to upscale it, I would say it's worth the money.  If not, and you wouldn't be happy looking at pixelated lava bubbles, I would say don't waste your money.",1265500800,4,832,4.557046979865772
8153400,3,B000JVT074,It wasn't as great as I expected it to be. Some of the colors of the lava bubbles just wasn't as visually appealing as I thought it would be. I'm still trying to figure-out if it's possible to play lava bubbles as I play music.,1207353600,2,227,4.066666666666666
