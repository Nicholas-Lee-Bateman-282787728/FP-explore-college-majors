5399672,5,B00A8ICDEU,"Loved this film so much I actually grabbed the Orphan Killer mask. This is a true slasher that any 80s slasher fan will immediately enjoy. The lead actress was great and this is a killer I really want to see more of.
It's Halloween month and this one is a must-watch for fans of horror and especially slasher fans. I expect big things from the director of this film.",1381276800,2,366,4.318840579710145
5399673,1,B00A8ICDEU,"Just one bloody butchering after another, with no particular story of interest to drive the movie forward. A complete bore.",1376784000,4,123,5.2
5399674,1,B00A8ICDEU,"Ridiculous horror movie that'll have any horror fan giggling. Obviously from the description the director was trying to shoot for the creation of some big slasher franchise. The plot is extremely similar to Halloween what with a brother trying to kill his sister. The twists to the tropes aren't big enough to make any difference so if you want to see Halloween revolve around an orphanage instead of teenagers in highschool maybe you'll like this movie? Except I don't know how anyone could. Everytime someone is about to get killed you know because annoying metal guitar and speed-metal drums kick in and don't even fit the situation. Maybe those people that cheer everytime someone gets killed would dig this, in fact that seems to be who the film is aimed at I suppose. The kill scenes are gore filled but unrealistic. Even the responses from some of the victims aren't even believable. (Apparently people moan and groan when strangled with barbed wire and don't make any kind of gurgling sounds at all!) All the kill scenes are fast and the whole movie has no suspense (thanks to the metal guitar) except for in the scene about how said orphan killer and his sister became orphans. Just another copy paste slasher film with nothing new to offer the genre. But if you want just another slasher film to get drunk and laugh at, this is a good choice for that kind of horror entertainment. The funniest part was when the killer burns a picture of the pope. LOL. Also priest torture is always good for some giggles. Also the killer talks and sounds like Bane from The Dark Knight rises. His lines even sound like something Bane would say if he were slightly a religious fanatic. LOL.",1376006400,4,1683,4.6891891891891895
5399675,5,B00A8ICDEU,"While The Orphan Killer is flawed, it is a great homage to 80's slasher films and is full of excellent gore and kills. It is face paced, unforgiving, and absolutely brutal; an unknown B rated horror film definitely worth checking out. Although this will not have a cult following, it is still a great popcorn flick any horror fan will surely enjoy!",1375920000,5,348,4.629032258064516
5399676,1,B00A8ICDEU,"Please, don't waste your time, this movie is just piece of sh..! It was more like comedy than horror. By far one the most pathetic ""horror"" movies I ever seen!
Continue searching and don't waste your time unless if you want to laugh a bit about stupid murderers..",1375315200,4,263,4.5
5399677,1,B00A8ICDEU,"I watched the first 20 minutes or so of this and just couldn't stomach any more...The script was horrible, the actors were worse.  Felt like I was watching a flick made in a high school video arts production class...was just hoping for even a ""bad"" slasher flick, but I didn't even really make it that far to get to the slasher scenes.",1372377600,4,335,4.403225806451613
5399678,5,B00A8ICDEU,"I loved this film... it reminded me of some of the great films made during the 70's and 80's. Was starting to wonder if the days of the old Classic Horror Films were long gone. The Directors and Producers of this film were fantastic and did quite a remarkable job making this film. Loaded with suspense, gore, special effects, and sexy actresses in damsel in distress situations, all the ingredients of a true horror film. the brother / sister... killer / heroine theme was well thought out and the acting was simply superb. this film kept me on the edge of my seat and was so utterly provocative. The chase scenes, torture/suspension scenes were incredible, and you could almost feel the pain the actress had to endure. Hope that there is a un-cut version that is 15 mins longer that may be available that may have more deleted scenes, would love to see more of the very sexy blonde heroine. Again awesome movie that will set a new stage for the making of future horror films.",1371340800,2,977,4.556818181818182
5399679,4,B00A8ICDEU,"Matt Farnsworth (IOWA) delivers this time, and BIG TIME with a killer inspired by many killers from the eighties slasher flicks. And if far from perfect on the side of Editing (No big deal), the movie succeeds in many ways, on many other levels.

Marcus Miller, the orphan killer grew on Facebook and other social networks 4 a time before hitting the fame he finally received as i heard and it was about time, and well deserved. Being the oldest of 2, Marcus Miller and his Young sister Audrey witnessed as their parents were killed during a robbery gone terribly wrong. Having no immediate relatives to take care of them, they were sent to the state's orphanage. But soon, little Audrey is adopted while Marcus and his ever degrading behavior stay locked up with the nuns of the orphanage. No matter the punishment inflicted though, Marcus Miller won't repent.

You probably can tell that years later, Marcus comes back to confront his sister and teach her a lesson about loyalty by inflicting pain on her, and her surroundings.

If you are one that thinks it gets harder to Watch horror movies as there are more severed limbs and more blood and gore each time a new film is made, well you might want to avoid this one. But if you love slasher flicks, this one is probably one of the best since Nightmare on Elm Street and there are reasons. Yes, it's a gory film, can't hide this. But there is also a complete story or plot if you will. We already know enough about Marcus and his sister after the first film to know them and realize that there's room for a franchise to be build around their mythology, without turning them into clowns (Which i'm sure Farnsworth can avoid.) Characters are interesting and full in their own way, as the story around them.

 And in these years with hollywood's big companies making remakes of great horror movies to balance their profit and be able to keep making 250 to 300 000 000 productions, while not caring about how they'll screw up a classic by overusing bad CGI (Thanks Platinum Dunes.) And in times when everything that was once good about Entertainment has become nothing more than superficial, say 4 romantic movies and girly flicks. The Bieber and Kardashian rule in all tablods and even further. In one word, in times when a guy's forced to Watch Twilight to please his girl and might even end up having to do with such superficiality as horror stories, well i'm more and more convinced that violent flicks like TOK are relevent, even VITAL if only to congrat the good old makeup artists. And if it sounds like too much nostalgia to appreciate a well made slasher, well i'm one that thinks we are in need of this nostalgia. And this can't be more of a poison or bad influence than Bieber or the Kardashians.

We are in need to bring back many great and important values in our Entertainment universe. And until then, horror fans need more HORROR flicks like this one. Let us keep them the way we love them.

5399680,5,B00A8ICDEU,"Great homage to 80s slasher flicks, gore, girls, awesome slasher with interesting background, and a priest getting killed.  What more do you want?",1370044800,3,146,5.3478260869565215

5399682,5,B00A8ICDEU,"I scour the internet for movies like this. I cannot spend all of my movie time watching flicks like this, but I do love it when I'm in the mood and I run into movies like this. I really enjoyed this movie. I just sat down in my recliner and lost myself in the mindless torture and pain being dished out by our resident serial killer, Marcus Miller. Marcus is unhappy with his sister. He feels she has been disloyal to him. He teaches her lessons in pain and suffering. He also teaches many others at the orphanage the same lessons. Except with much more permanent results. This is a torture movie plain and simple. There is a lot of torture. A lot of blood and pain and a ton of crying and whimpering. Begging, crying, screaming, you know, that old chestnut. Good old fashion fun. If you do not like horror movies that are basically pain and suffering from beginning to end, then skip it. This is not Halloween or Friday the 13th. There is not a lot of time between kills for laughs and story developments. No way. Yes, the story is set out there for you so you know what is happening and why. But the story is simple and therefore Mr. Miller can get on with his torture and death. Fun stuff. I like it!",1456617600,,1203,4.25764192139738
5399683,5,B00A8ICDEU,"The story of The Orphan Killer is truly a modern, creative one with a new evil stepping up to the horror plate creating a nightmare perfectly framed in the aspects of religious grandiosity. There are certain little moments that take from various elements of the storys slasher genre past that act more to highlight and pay tribute to Matt Farnsworth love of the genre, moments that are best left for the fan to discover than to point out in this review. I just have to say that even though I noticed small moments that are reminiscent of some horror classics, pretty much every aspect of this film has a unique feel and vision all its own. The Orphan Killer does truly offer up a new nightmare killer and powerfully intimidating horror icon.

The acting and visual style of The Orphan Killer somehow blends the surreal and American grindcore cinema  techniques effortlessly. The continuity and unease of atmosphere that echoes through the film provides a nonstop intense, chilling ride into hell. There were moments in the film I had to look away from the graphic display, not from a weak stomach but because the seen was so intense I needed a moment of relief. The characters in The Orphan Killer are straight forward, grounded characters and yet there are some moments in the story that display widely unnatural behavior-but I am not Catholic, nor did I grow up in a Catholic world so I don't know if nuns really fantasize about sucking cock. Maybe they do. Anyway this movie is pretty epic in its storytelling, artistic style and character integrity both with the killer and the protagonist.

The Orphan Killer is truly one of those great indie horror films that gets it all right. The story is morbid, dark and intense. The acting and action is thrilling from almost the word go. The kill sequences and special effects are gruesome and realistically unsettling. The soundtrack rocks and the The Orphan Killer himself is a true, terrifying force of evil that isn't easily forgettable. This film is definitely one to see for all horror fans.",1432512000,2,2043,4.781869688385269
5399684,4,B00A8ICDEU,"I've heard many say this movie was terrible, I thought it was pretty dang crazy. Its very graphic and disturbing at times. I even got offended a few times watching this and turned my head. This was a very nasty one thats for sure. Make sure you are at least 21 or older to watch this. Im actually surprised some of the stuff they did in this movie. I think in some parts it was a bit too much. The soundtrack to this movie was awful though, the constant death metal just seemed out of place in scenes. The Orphan Killer was something else though; I may need to be baptized now for watching this.",1431129600,,595,4.182608695652174

5399687,3,B00A8ICDEU,"Ok, first of all I AM NOT RELATED TO OR FRIENDS WITH anyone involved in the making of this film. There, thought I'd get that out of the way because I'd like to actually review this movie rather than just slate it. First of all, the negatives (and they do out weigh the positives)... This film is MOSTLY woefully acted, I mean REALLY BAD acting! The story line (yes, there is one) is mired in rather haphazzard editing and a desire to overdo the gore fx. A lot of scenes are REEEEAAAALLLLLLYYYYYY long and over done. The dialogue is mostly crap and weakens otherwise strong scenes..And the killer talks! Not just the odd line either! Ok, the positives... The gore fx are EXCELLENT!!!!! AND PRACTICAL!!!! The Orphan Killer is a truly menacing character (always a plus). Most of those responsible for poor acting and dialogue are killed in fine style before they can do any real damage and yes, the female lead is pretty hot and not too shabby with her acting skills. Well, thats it. But check those negatives against some of the best cult horror films from the 70's and 80's and you will see this film is almost an homage to a massive time period of horror. Imagine sitting through the video nasties right up to the torture porn style flicks of recent years and you might just see why this film was made in the first place. Give it a go, even if you do only slate it after, at least then you'll know why this film continues to split it's audience...",1404691200,3,1447,4.443609022556391
5399688,5,B00A8ICDEU,"I gave this movie a five star rating because I could see the blend of modern horror elements, alongside some classic ideas, such as the Psychology and emotions. There are a few brutal scenes and I think it will be worthwhile to watch the sequel, to see how the story shall evolve. I think the majority of Horror fans, old and new shall enjoy this. There will always be good reviews and bad reviews about anything which is created. I am rating this movie, not just being a lifelong Horror admirer, but also from within the creative aspect too. I am looking forward to the sequel. AC",1403308800,,581,4.4392523364485985
5399689,4,B00A8ICDEU,"Lots of blood and gore and torture porn and religious perversion. If these are things you want in a movie then watch it; if they turn you off you will hate it.

5399690,5,B00A8ICDEU,I am a budding special fx artist and actor. I was really impressed by the realism of the fx. Cool killer character with a decent back story.,1398297600,,140,4.222222222222222
5399691,1,B00A8ICDEU,"This movie is absolute garbage. Don't know who is hyping this so much or why but they must be friends of the people who made it. Take it from a lifelong horror fan who was raised on classic slasher movies: This is not a throwback to any classic slasher movies and don't believe anyone who says otherwise. The acting is bad and the plot is indeed dumb but of course plots are not always important in horror movies so that leaves atmosphere, score and good special effects to make it worthy. This pile of cinematic poo has none of those things! No creepy atmosphere, a lame metalcore/screamo soundtrack and the gore effects are decent but nothing to rave about. All this movie has going for it is a very hot leading lady, which is the only reason this movie got so hyped in the first place. This actress plays a teacher at a CATHOLIC SCHOOL in this dumb movie yet for some reason she is dressed like a hooker and wearing a short skirt and fishnet pantyhose to school!  Don't worry though because she strips out of the skirt and pantyhose for a random shower scene and some bum and boob shots. Normally I would call a scene like this pointless but it is the only scene worth watching so skip ahead to 13:15 to see it. Bottom line is this movie is a big ol' pile of overly hyped poopy. Unfortunately many horror fans these days seem to be morons and love to praise crap like this so I am sure it will get a sequel. Since a sequel seems inevitable I am begging the director to have way more nudity in it! You are truly one of the worst film makers ever but Diane Foster is very hot, so if you are going to make a terrible movie with her in it then please make one that has non stop nudity to make the whole thing watchable.",1393632000,3,1718,4.221884498480243

8548229,3,B00A8ICDEU,"Competent and gory low budget slasher film is watchable but that's about it.  The Orphan Killer is the kind of movie that benefits little if at all from a Blu-ray transfer since it's so low budget, has no production values beyond the gore effects and appears to have been shot cheaply on video.  The story concerns the title killer who wants to murder his grown sister since when they were children she was adopted and he was not.  His sister is a dance teacher overseeing a sparsely attended recital at a Catholic school.  The Orphan Killer seals the building with bloody barbed wire wrapped around the door handles to prevent them from opening and kills anyone who gets between him and his sister.  And that's about it.  The Orphan Killer has no interest in plot, character development or any other film niceties that don't involve stalking and murder.  The acting is pretty lousy but slasher movie fans who are more interested in gore than decent production values or good writing might find this acceptable enough.  But pretty much any authentic 1980's slasher film you might come across is likely better.",1489881600,,1109,4.8
8548230,3,B00A8ICDEU,"It's time to turn your brain off and put your love for Drive-In b-grade wonderment of entertainment to it's test. Time to take a trip into nothing more than a bloody, gory reality of viewing.

The Orphan Killer is a total throwback to the reality of ultimate gore and violence. This is an acquired taste, not all will get this style of cinema, but for those who love or are a gore hound of simplistic films, then this is a total winner. This is a total B-grade piece of cinema. The acting is horrendous at times and the plot is what it is, but thats all the point, because these styles of films are not meant to be award worthy, they are meant to just entertain with blood and guts, and a Drive-In of entertainment that bleeds the old Grindhouse cinema days.

This is a 2011 film and is happily brought out on a wonderful top notch, high quality Blu-ray that utterly stands out in that the company Reel Gore Releasing always pays great respect to the films they choose.

This is directed by a new comer, Matt Farnsworth, and is also written by Matt Farnsworth. Now not only does Matt write and direct, he also stars in it as Officer Mike Hunt. This is his second feature film as director, his first being the 2005 Crime drama Iowa.

The best way to describe The Orphan Killer is, if Herschell Gordon Lewis had an incestual orgy with Jorg Buttgereit and Roger Corman, and then ended up miraculously giving birth. This would be the prime example of that love child between them.

Your main characters are Audrey and Marcus. Now to add to all the child dysfunction, their parents were brutally murdered. Both are sent to Saint Michaels Orphanage. Now to make a long story short, Audrey is adopted and Marcus is left behind. His violent nature is all over the place due to his parents brutal murder, and his total isolation at the orphanage. He is punished by having to wear a mask. Flash forward and as you would guess, murders start to happen. Brutal murders it seems to all those that caused pain and suffering or at least all those that just happen to get in the way of a psychotic killer seeking revenge.

Starring David Backus as the Orphan Killer and Diane Foster as Audrey. Both maintain their roles in different styles. Each seem to control and execute the reality of their characters into a believable reality.

This is a low-budget creation sparking a bang at times, and most of all a blood red bath. Go into this with the idea of a Late-night Ghoul Hosted Midnight Movie, and it works with all its cheesy acting and drive-in mentality. This plays out like a low-budget, direct to video reality. For those who love the torture porn type of scenario in horror films. This is a pure visceral watch of violence, and you become the victim.

Some will like, some will not. It does have its flaws, but it also has its brutal reality of hardcore type scenario's of a graphic over the top violent nature. Truly a brutal blood drenched mayhem, one pissed off killer seeking his justice.

Audio/Video:

The audio and video are splendid and is a high-quality reality to this Blu-ray. The video is vibrant in color and the audio is crystal clear to the ears. A perfection.

English Language

A nice array of special features. I would have expected more, considering some of the other Reel Gore Releasing Blu-rays, but I still enjoyed the Video Diary, anything dealing with how movies are made is a huge plus in my book.

Behind the Murder - Exclusive Video Diary
Trailer, Music Clip, Slideshow
And you get the Collectible O-Card which always displays a Gore girl and the bloody mayhem of the films brought out by Reel Gore Releasing.

Overall:

As I have stated this film is not for everyone. This is a spiraling orgy of violence and B-grade cinema, that lingers on the boundaries of a Late Night, Drive-in Style, Grindhouse flick. This is a wonderful product by a wonderful company. They supply the darker more twisted pieces of cinema. A brutal array of violence and darker horror. Highly recommended Blu-ray for the gore hound.",1485129600,,4167,4.648979591836735
8548231,5,B00A8ICDEU,"Produced mainly by Farnsworths company, entitled simply enough Matt Farnsworth Films, in association with Full Fathom 5, The Orphan Killer has rightfully found a friend at the Reel Gore Releasing home distribution label with a Hi-Def 1080p Blu-ray and DVD combo release. The 2.35:1 aspect ratio presentation sharply defines details, especially in the blacks, and does well with desaturating the hues to give it a gritty, dirty appearance that compliments the abandoned sections of Saint Michaels. Two audio options are available, an English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and Dolby Digital 2 channel; the 5.1 delivers a heart pounding score, but the soundtrack by Bullet Tooth releasing, featuring a slew of hardcore metal bands, oversteps into some dialogue sequences. However, Ventanas cover of Cry Little Sister kicks off right after the opening credits; an early sure sign of good things to ahead. Bonus features include a behind the Murder: an exclusive video diary, teaser trailer, theatrical trailer, music clip, and a slideshow.
