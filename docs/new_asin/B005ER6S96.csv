This piece let us see their struggles as well as their talent emerge individually. We all love the Beatles and the impact they had on music as we know it, we must also respect the individual artistry. These two men are and will be remembered for talent beyond our imaginations and songs that will live on for generations to come. We may not all agree on the outcome/approach of this video, but we must agree about the genius of their work. I loved it, well done.",1373155200,,609,4.495495495495495

4667044,5,B005ER6S96,"There is a new addition to the ""Composing The Beatles"" series out on dvd this week, concluding the lifelong contribution to music that John Lennon favored us with, along with the continuing attributes of Sir Paul McCartney.

The `now-in-total' four disc set, (sold separately), reveals the trials and tribulations regarding the `Lennon-McCartney' partnership, as some would say, the greatest songwriting team of all time...but...

In the first disc of The Beatles early years, it was indeed a team effort that quickly grew apart where the songwriting was concerned, and, by disc 2, it was all over but the memories. This `team', although credited as such, rarely wrote much together, and it's evident to all those questioned, as well as to all those who listen, who really wrote what.

Disc 3 and 4 go under the paraphrased titles of ""Composing Outside The Beatles"", and take a look at the solo careers of John and Paul, after the breakup.

Clearly, in all four discs, the consensus is that John was indeed the better writer of the two, and that never becomes more clear than on disc 3, where their early solo efforts contrasted like night and day.

While John released brilliant efforts like ""Imagine"" and the `Plastic Ono Band' l.p., Paul was struggling with efforts like ""Wild Life"" and ""Ram"".

But, on disc 4, the newest entry, Paul's fortunes change, and, though he still isn't given much credit as far as being a songwriter goes, the charts told a different story, as he skyrocketed to #1 with the album still considered his post-Beatle magnum opus, ""Band on The Run"".

John, at this point, was not very focused on the music, and personal issues took him away from it for a while. Personal issues, however, constantly plagued Paul's new band `Wings', as the band members became a rotating multiplex of names and faces, struggling to find their place amongst the ex-Beatle.

And, sadly, by the end of disc four, the fatal day occurred, practically moments after John got back into the studio to release one of his most prominent efforts, ""Double Fantasy"". All four of these discs together mark the legacy from beginning to end, and struggle to understand it all, while simply appreciating the time we had.

4667045,4,B005ER6S96,"James A. Stewart, DVD Verdict --The general angle of Composing Outside The Beatles is that McCartney fared better in the post-Beatles world by going after popularity with Wings--the band he formed with his wife Linda, Denny Laine of the Moody Blues, and a number of other people who came and went--while Lennon's artistic ambitions were less successful.

Whether you agree with the conclusion or not, Composing Outside The Beatles does a good job of outlining Lennon's and McCartney's work and presenting its case. It generally gets closer to McCartney's life, thanks to contributions from Laine and Wings drummer Denny Seiwell, but manages to show how a rough patch in Lennon's marriage to Yoko Ono affected his music--and led to a reunion with McCartney. Music videos and concert clips are plentiful, excerpted to give viewers reminders of songs such as McCartney's ""My Love,"" ""Live and Let Die,"" ""Band on the Run,"" and ""Coming Up,"" and Lennon's ""Whatever Gets You Through the Night"" and ""Woman."" Comments from critics and acquaintances help present a rounded picture of the artists' decade.

Composing is a little long, clocking in at over two hours, but it rarely bogs down. It's apparently a three-part television documentary released as one long unit on DVD; it would have been helpful to keep any divisions so viewers could watch at their own pace. I also noticed that there's another volume available on Amazon.com.

As you'd expect, picture quality varies widely, depending on the clips. It's an all-regions disc. Some extra Laine comments, particularly on his ""friendly competition"" with McCartney, and contributor bios are included. The DVD box gives a rundown of the contributors so you know who's who among the talking heads.

McCartney's the one whose career took off, but at the price of popularity over profundity.

I think however it must be watched as a set or you will end up thinking it is somewhat bias to either Lennon or McCartney depending on which of the instalments you are viewing. It is at times brutally honest in its criticism's of particular works by both artist but that should be expected when watching a documentary of this sort. You can't take one persons opinion of one particular album and dismiss all the positives this series brings up. Watch the whole series and then make your judgement.

4667112,4,B005ER6S96,"This documentary would have better if it didn't contain the idiotic and mean-spirited remarks of Chris Ingham. To suggest that John Lennon's Double Fantasy is his ""weakest music"" and to completely dismiss the significance and brilliance of a song like Starting Over makes me question his intentions and his opinion. He seems like a narcissist who holds his own perceptions as fact and does not seem sensitive or keyed in at all to mass consciousness, such as when he questions why anyone would buy an artist's last album posthumously.  Not only is this a way of paying tribute but it is also an attempt to connect with the collective soul of shared grief and nostalgia for a public figure who has changed the world in some form or fashion for the better and has contributed to the evolution of our humanity, especially in the case of a musical genius like Lennon.",1414886400,2,863,4.71523178807947

4667129,4,B005ER6S96,"This is the fourth DVD in this series and the second looking at Lennon and McCartneys solo output.  The previous disc looked at the period 1967-1972 and was a disappointment for McCartney fans, being very Lennon orientated. This disc is much more likely to appeal to Pauls fans, than Johns, as Johns output came to a halt in the mid-Seventies, until his return with Double Fantasy.

The programme begins with the formation of Wings and Wild Life.  Although this is pretty much dismissed, I love Pauls early albums  McCartney, Ram, and Wild Life- and although I think they work better as albums,  listened to in their entirety,  there were some individual tracks that could have been discussed, surely!  However, we then move on to My Love, giving Paul his first big solo hit and seeing him begin to regain control over his career.  Denny Seiwell discusses Paul writing Live and Let Die, in about ten minutes and it is clear that he is ready to go out and work again.  Good to hear Denny Seiwell and Denny Laine interviewed and worth getting the DVD just for their contributions.

John, meanwhile, had released Mind Games, (The NYC album is dismissed by the panel as pretty much just an embarrassment).  Mind Games is described by the experts as weak, (you will certainly not always agree with their opinions!)  but there are, at least,  some songs discussed. You do feel it is a shame that Pauls early albums were not given the same attention in the earlier DVD, but Mind Games, is certainly a good album.

Band On the Run, is the next album offer and the beginning of the problems with Wings, which led to many changing line-ups over the decade.  John was heading into his infamous  Lost Weekend, and Klaus Voorman returns in this DVD to discuss that period and Pauls role in reuniting John and Yoko.  Walls and Bridges, and his Rock and Roll albums are discussed.  Walls and Bridges is my favourite of Johns solo albums and it is good to hear that the critics on the panel also feel it merits more attention than it usually gets.

At this point, Wings were poised to become one of the biggest bands of the Seventies and there is a critical appraisal of Venus and Mars, Wings at the Speed of Sound, Wings Over America, London Town, Back to the Egg, and the demise of Wings.  Among individual songs looked at are, Juniors Farm, Listen to What the Man Said and Mull of Kintyre.  Again, it is really good to have Denny Laines input about those years.  The end of Wings saw Paul back as a solo performer and the release of McCartney II which, of course, contains the excellent Coming Up, and Waterfalls.  It is suggested that ""Coming Up"" was the song which gave Lennon the challenge he needed to get back in the studio and so, we move on to Lennon's. ""Double Fantasy.""

Double Fantasy, is given quite short shrift as an album.  Even if, like me, you remember the lukewarm reception of the album in the short time between its release and Johns tragic, and untimely, death, it is still shocking to hear that album criticised.  It was, at that time, everywhere and took on a certain emotional quality, which I still find hard to be objective about.  Of course, though, that is the panels job and, even if you may not agree with everything they say (and I didnt, often!), they are interesting to listen to.  Taken together, the four DVDs are essential watching for fans and are sure to be watched again and again.

Also, unlike the previous DVD,  this has at least one included extra  an extended interview with Denny Laine  in which he puts aside rumours that he argued with Paul (rumours largely based on interviews he did for Geoffrey Giulianos revolting biography, Blackbird) and lets slip the news that he is writing an autobiography, while interestingly reassuring fans that he is not intending to be negative.  Obviously, Laine has done little of note after Wings and is looking to get fans back on side. Personally, I would  be interested in reading this when (if?) it is released and it is certainly good to get his take on Wings, as he was Pauls collaborator during most of the Seventies.",1396396800,,4091,4.597241379310345
4667130,4,B005ER6S96,"Well, I would say this makes up for the second documentary in the series, in that it pays major homage to McCartney with a little bit of Lennon thrown in. Not bad if you want more details on the ups and downs of Lennon and McCartney after the breakup of the Beatles. I hadn't listen to a lot of the McCartney/Wings tunes in a long while, so it was a good reminder of how good some of the songs were and are.",1392681600,,407,3.975609756097561
4667131,4,B005ER6S96,"The rise of relatively inexpensive desktop video editing has produced something of a cottage industry in rock 'n' roll documentaries, often characterized by repetitive use of grainy, fourth-generation stock footage, public domain photos and dubious ""reporting."" I'm happy to say that this is not one of those.  ""Beatles--Composing Outside the Beatles"" features concert footage, official song videos, a wide variety of still photographs, and a good roster of interviewees like former Moody Blues/Wings member Denny Laine, Klaus Voorman, Rolling Stone editor Jann Wenner, and a number of other credible critics and music insiders. While the documentary is overly long, it's nonetheless thorough and informative.  You will certainly learn things from this video and be better able to place John and Paul's post-Beatles output into context with their days in the Fab Four.",1392595200,,868,5.568181818181818
