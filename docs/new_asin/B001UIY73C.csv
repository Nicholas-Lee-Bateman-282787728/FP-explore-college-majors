This is an obvious ploy of advertisers to boost sales.  But seriously these reviews are way overblown.

All the elements of the next big blockbuster are there - intrigue, action, 200 foot shark, and romance. Deborah Gibson delivers an Academy Award winning performance as a marine biologist caught between 2 primordial forces, with the fate of the world at stake. Lorenzo Lamas swaggers his way to a career making performance as the hard driving military man who has an unexpected sensitive side. Although some parts of the film were cliched (who didn't foresee that Mr. Sakamura was actually a android?) nonetheless, the film embraces the cliches and makes them into timeless classics.

3801439,3,B001UIY73C,"Released in 2009, Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus chronicles events after an illegal military experiment accidentally unleashes two prehistoric creatures frozen in mid-combat: A Megalodon shark and an equally colossal octopus. The beasts start wreaking havoc on the world, attacking ships, oil drills, and even airplanes at 28,000 feet. A marine biologist (Deborah ""Debbie"" Gibson) teams up with her former professor (Sean Lawlor) and a Japanese man (Vic Chao) and they, in turn, hook up with the military (lead man played by Lorenzo Lamas) to provoke a fatal battle between the shark and octopus

Considering the cheesy title and the fact that this is a The Asylum movie, you basically know what you're going to get  A Grade C creature feature with cartoony non-special effects. Whether its entertaining or not depends on (1.) how compelling the story is and (2.) the quality of the cast. While the story is only mildly compelling and sometimes downright dull, the likable cast makes up for it. Theres a palpable warmth to the relationships of the four protagonists (despite some gruffness here and there); and the way two of em hook-up romantically is almost touching, not to mention you can tell they all had a good time making the flick. There are also a couple of laugh-out-loud moments, which shows that the filmmakers regarded the material in a tongue-in cheek way, as in Yes, we know this is schlock, but were going to have a good time and hope the viewer does too. There are also numerous cool visuals (of the sea, mountains, beaches, etc.) plus an intense stand-off in the last act, which is pretty effective. Lastly, Debbie is still cute and a pleasure to behold. But none of these positives can redeem the movie from what it is  a mildly amusing low-budget giant monster flick with weak effects. Nevertheless, it's worth seeing IF the positives trip your trigger.

The film runs 88 minutes and was shot in the Greater Los Angeles area of Southern California.

3801455,3,B001UIY73C,"Gimmick casting aside, this is just another standard monster flick filled with bad acting, bad FX, and bad dialog.

The story has been oft used, to greater success.  Near the coast of Alaska, renegade oceanographer Emma MacNeil (played for all her grin was worth by Deborah Gibson), accidently comes across two prehysterical creatures frozen solid in a glacier.  The ice breaks allowing the slumbering critters to instantly thaw and take off to cause trouble in multiple locations around the world.  What follows is the usual chaos one expects from a creature feature.  Things get destroyed, Emma gets fired, the usual shady government types kidnap her and her cohorts so they can be grilled by a dangerous wacko with authority (Lorenzo Lamas, channeling Yosemite Sam).  Of course this includes the expected denouncement about global warming (you can't go anywhere near a glacier without mentioning that.  It's described as our ""comeuppance,"" that these creatures were unleashed on the world as a direct result of our tampering with nature).  Yeah, whatever.  Meanwhile, destroyers are destroyed, subs are dispatched, the world is teetering on the brink of pandemonium, but there's always time for sex (Gibson and Vic Chao).  Thank goodness they had a ready supply of test tubes and colored water to play with, they were scientists after all.  No surprise, the ultimate default solution is brought up: when in doubt, nuke `em.  Instead, they played tag with the critters for a while.  That was amusing.  Then they thought to pit one creature against the other with standard results.

Yes, this sci-fi flick is hopelessly inept.  Even so, it does have a certain peculiar charm (odd casting choices notwithstanding).  I did like it, to a point (not including Deborah Gibson & Lorenzo Lamas).  Otherwise, just what you'd expect from the crap factory (aptly called The Asylum).",1407024000,2,1873,5.145695364238411

When Mega Shark and Giant Octopus turn on each other however, a spectacular battle for supremacy of the sea unfolds....and what a battle it is!

This SyFy original is one movie I knew straight from the get-go was going to be a humdinger of a B-movie. How so? Ridiculous title...but, what really sold me was Debbie Gibson and Lorenzo Lamas being in this movie. These two in a Sy-Fy movie together? I have to see this, I told myself.

3801482,2,B001UIY73C,"The title should say, ""Don't expect much."" I expected a bad script, bad acting, bad science, and bad special effects. In that regard I wasn't disappointed. If you decide to turn it off after a giant shark jumps out of the water and takes a jet out of the sky, wait. We later find out they can travel 500 knots, but have trouble catching a nuclear sub doing less than say, 40 knots. No wait. These nuclear subs have something called ""emergency turbos"" so maybe they can go faster. Sailors on nuclear subs don't carry handguns. Really. Who would they shoot underwater? At one point they flash the locations of the recent attacks. Nearly all were in the Pacific ocean as expected. There were 3 in the Atlantic. As Sarah Palin might tweet, ""WTF?"" These creatures for some unexplained reason are impervious to conventional weapons so the military led by our secret government kidnaps three scientists to employ them for information on how to kill them. They get right on the task by mixing water tainted with various vegetable dies. We discover red water added to blue water makes purple water and that blonds love Japanese men who try to act like Sulu as much as Orientals love blonds. After a romp in a closet, they figure out they can lure the creatures into certain ports (San Francisco and Tokoyo) which have a natural shelf and then trap them. The idea being they can get in, but somehow they can't get out, unless they catch a ride with a plane flying overhead. They then manufacture a phermone of an extinct animal for which they would normally have no idea where to start. We know they are successful because when they mix two liquids together it turns florescent green and Debbie Gibson smiles.

At one point Japanese and American subs are in the same area. All the American subs are destroyed but one. The Japanese civilian scientist asks, which one is it, as Debbie or now Deborah Gibson is on one of them. The captain says, ""No way of telling."" After making subs (this film and Moby Dick) do all kinds of things beyond any smidgeon of realism, they claim they ""can't tell."" Really they can tell. Each sub has its own unique underwater signature.

The creatures look very artificial. But what did you expect? If you enjoy getting stoned and watching ""Lost in Space"" episodes, give this one 5 stars.

I can honestly say, if you viewed the trailer for this film, you saw the best aspects of it!  This film really could have been a lot of fun, given the idea, but I can't even say I had fun watching this one.  Very flat an uninspired acting, bad CGI and probably the worst mistake....no eye-popping kills, which, let's be honest, the only reason most would even give a film like this a chance, to begin with.

Save the money you'd spend on this and the time you would waste and check out some real classic 'B' film!",1315008000,2,704,4.185185185185185
3801487,2,B001UIY73C,"Well of course I knew this was gonna be bad, but with the trailer showing the Mega Shark eating a passenger airplane, the film was screaming out to be watched!

But yes, it is really bad. 95% of the film is spent watching the cast emote and talk about the two monsters and only 5% of screen time is devoted to actually showing them. The budget must have been really low because even with this tiny amount of on screen time the filmmakers still repeat several of the shots multiple times, such as the Mega Shark (I love calling it that!) bombing through the water towards the camera, or the Giant Octopus opening and closing its tentacles like an umbrella.

Nearly all the creature shots are underwater and VERY murky, and the few that aren't are SO brief that you can barely see them. Let me list them:

Mega Shark attacks a plane: about 2.5 seconds of monster footage. Giant Octopus attacks an oil rig - about 3 secs of monster footage. Mega Shark eats Golden Gate bridge - 3 separate 1 second shots of monster action.

And all of this is in the trailer! So if you want to see almost two hours of Debbie Gibson and some bunch of no-name actors waffling about science, aquatic life and plans to capture the creatures, all seemingly filmed in one cardboard set featuring dials and switches that slightly look like a warship deck only with different red, blue and green lights on it for different scenes, then this film is for you. If you want to see a giant CGI shark and octopus destroying CGI ships, planes and bridges, watch the trailer and save yourself a whole lot of time.

What saddened me slightly is that you can tell the film makers went to some effort to make this, it's proficiently filmed and at least they did stage a few good scenes but if you call your movie ""Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus"", you gotta deliver a hell of a lot more mega shark and giant octopus than this!

Luckily things improve in the follow up film Mega Python Vs Gatoroid, when the cast and scriptwriters start taking themselves less seriously...shame this one was just before that change of heart because there's no humour at all",1315008000,,2112,4.472727272727273

All extremely amateurish. Oh, and what was all that black and white flash-cutting about?

The one thing I couldn't work out was whether the film is deliberately being ironic or is meant to be taken at face value. Either way, I couldn't care less.

Maybe if you've downed a bottle of wine, are in giggly mood and with friends, it might be fun. Otherwise, and to repeat myself: plain old rubbish!",1314057600,,778,4.58273381294964

3801490,2,B001UIY73C,"I guess it was just too good to be true.  Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus, with the object of one of my teen crushes right there in the middle of the action.  Man, I had been looking forward to this movie so much, especially after seeing the cheesy greatness of Mega Piranha.  Sadly, I must report that Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus just doesn't deliver the goods.  Rather than letting us sit back and revel in the prehistorically gigantic havoc wreaked by our two title characters, some nimrod went and used up most of the time with a poorly written, downright stupid storyline.

As the story is told to us, a Megaladon and a giant octopus chose to stay and fight when all the rest of their species were fleeing the effects of the Ice Age (as if the Ice Age just suddenly happened overnight rather than over the course of a few million years).  There they stayed, frozen in ice, until some stupid government project accidentally unleashed them on the world.  The next thing you know, both military and civilian vessels are being attacked all over the world.  The US military throws its collective hands up in the air after failing to kill the giant shark with a few naval guns, while the Japanese are apparently content to put all of its government trust in some junior scientist who comes to America to join forces with a university professor and his former student.  Normally, as we all know, the Japanese would find some little boy in short pants and put him in charge of a whole task force, so I don't know what they were thinking here.  Anyway, our trio of scientific geniuses comes up with a plan to lure the creatures into San Francisco Bay and Tokyo Bay.  You can guess how well that works out.

The absolute highlight of this entire movie involves Mega Shark and a commercial jet (Michael Jordan has nothing on Mega Shark).  It's all downhill after that scene - and, unfortunately, that scene takes place fairly early in the movie.  Except for a grumpy Lorenzo Lamas, this whole film is basically an exhibition of bad acting.  I was a Debbie Gibson fan long after it was no longer a cool thing to be, but Deborah is less than convincing here as a renegade marine biologist and - as much as it pains me to say it - she has not aged all that well.  She's still a better actor than her co-star Vic Chao, though.  The romantic subplot that develops between their two characters has to be the most tepid and lifeless romance in the history of cinema.

Even though this is the most disappointing of all the Asylum monster movies I've seen, Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus has the distinction of being the first Asylum production to be given a theatrical release.  According to IMDB, it only opened on one screen in the UK, but I guess that's enough to count as an official theatrical release.  I can also report that, having done Mega Shark wrong with this movie's inane plot, Asylum brought him back to fight a giant crocodile in the much more entertaining Mega Shark vs Crocosaurus.",1311465600,,2980,4.5139664804469275
3801491,1,B001UIY73C,"Why even watch Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus? Well, I like giant monster movies and the Blue Ray was only five bucks at the store, so how wrong could I go?  I guess the first clue was that the movie starred Deborah Gibson, the former teen pop star from the 1980s known then as Debbie Gibson.  Gibson may be a has-been as a singer (or maybe she's still okay, I don't follow her music), but as an actress, she's practically a never-was.  She is not just a bad actress, she's a BAD actress.  The only thing that helps her performance is that she's surrounded by many other bad actors and actresses.

The plot involves Gibson as a marine biologist who witnesses the title monsters being freed from a glacier, where they proceed to go their separate ways and wreak havoc in the sea lanes.  Mega Shark is so big, it can leap out of the ocean and grab a plane or the Golden Gate Bridge in its mouth.  Giant Octopus treats submarines as if they were bath toys.  Both travel super fast and cannot be stopped by naval destroyers.

Of course, in a movie like this, science and even plausibility can be thrown out the window, but that's still no excuse for the many other flaws in this movie.  From the get-go, there are continuity problems, as we see Gibson's close-up hand with dark nail polish, and then in the same scene, with no polish.  Almost every actor seems to be reading off of cue cards, with the rare overacting ham providing a distraction from all the stiff acting.  There are dozens of clichs, including the secretive government agents, many in suits and dark sunglasses.  Oh, and then there's the awful directing....

All of which would be no problem at all if the main event is any good.  You don't watch Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus for the writing, acting or directing.  You watch it for the monster-on-monster action.  Even this is a disappointment; by the time we get to the big fight, there's barely fifteen minutes left in the movie, and the fight takes maybe three of those minutes, with action that is murky, hard to follow and kind of boring.  Obviously, everything is CGI, but still, we don't see that much, as if the director is flinching away from the key scenes.  This is not so-bad-it's good; it's just cynical moviemaking at its worst.",1308960000,,2252,4.502463054187192

Plot: For two million years a Megalodon has been frozen in a giant ice glacier but he was not alone for a Gargantious Octopus has also been in the block of ice and apparently they were fighting before they were froze. But now they are loose from global warming and are out on a rampage destroying things from planes to bridges! Only Deborah Gibson along with the help of three men (A Chinese man, a Professor, and Lorenzo Llamas) can stop the terror!

Review: This film just tanked... it had horrid special effects, and acting along with terrible action scenes, and suspense! I was psyched to see it when I heard about the Trailer for it appearing on MTV I thought that it was going to be epic and big and it was... just for the wrong reasons!

Acting: Deborah Gibson wasn't as good as I hoped and to tell you the truth I never heard of her until this movie! Lorenzo Llamas is just a B-Movie kind of guy and that isn't what this movie needed!

Gore: nothing worth mentioning!

The Bottom Line: This movie had a lot going for it but failed in its attempt to make a good impression or impact on me and a lot of other people as well! I mean come on... I measured the shark compared by it image and the description of the tooth and I got the estimate that the shark was around 720 feet.... that's just ridiculous especially since sharks for one don't jump out and attack objects besides seals and the average Megalodon is 60-80 feet!

3801497,1,B001UIY73C,"I don't see how they could have possibly made a worse film. I'm a huge fan of campy horror movies (I own all the Godzilla, Ghidrah, and Gamera films for example, as well as a nice collection of horror cheese from Lake Placid to House). I've always enjoyed such things. Yes, I even own many of Ed Wood's cinematic atrocities.

But, as others have said, this film doesn't even qualify in the ""so bad it's good"" category. Some years ago I wrote a column called ""Zippers"". In it, I would point out the mistakes made in films. Sometimes it was as small as a cigarette burning backwards and other times it was something huge like the self-repairing yellow Porche in ""Commando"".

This alleged film has so many errors that I was constantly distracted from the movie itself. For example:

1. The actual battle that the movie title comes from takes place after an hour of each creature being in separate oceans.

2. The battle is mostly made up of 2 or 3 clips, each about 2 seconds long, played repeatedly as jump cuts.

3. Several times we see the massive shark roughly 10 yards behind a sub. Yet when the sub fires the stern torpedoes at the beast, the creature is nowhere to be seen and we see the torpedoes racing through a completely empty sea.

4. A sub - complete with a super secret joystick driven control panel AND turbo power - is reported as 20 meters away from hitting an undersea rock outcropping. Roughly 20 seconds later, a crewman announces that they are now 15 meters away. Then, after still more time passes, just 10 meters away. I could row a danged destroyer quicker.

5. Ahh never mind. There were over 75 such errors I found just in a single viewing of this Blu Ray. If I were to really list them, we'd be here for days even without me complaining about the massive loss of life in Japan that we are told about, but never get so much of a glimpse of. Way to save on the budget guys!

This clunker is more lame than a 1-legged man with a broken ankle.

I've read bad reviews of films I love hundreds of times. Some people just don't appreciate the pure campy joy of watching a deliberately cheesy movies like the Puppet Master series from Full Moon studios (or anything else Full Moon produces for that matter) or the trash masterpieces from Troma studios. This is not one of those. I LOVE such brainless fun!

Fans of the type of ""funny"" and low budget movies that Roger Corman built his career upon - take this from a fellow cheese-a-holic and MST3K junkie. If you buy this movie you will lose money, time out of your life, and quite possibly lower your IQ by several dozen points. If you can't survive without seeing pictures of an adult Debbie Gibson, just surf the web or watch the trailer online for free. Her presence is only there to create a curiosity factor (much like Tiffany in Mega Pirannha) and her acting while not atrocious, is not reason enough to watch this movie.

I spotted this in the $5 bin at Best Buy, and couldn't resist.

""MS vs GO"" is beyond ludicrous. The sight of a (roughly) 1000-foot (!!!) shark leaping into the air a height several times its body length (!!!!) and snatching/snacking an airplane (!!!!!) has to be one of the most-idiotic scenes in the history of motion pictures.

The acting and directing are on the same level. The actors exude an almost-continual cheeriness that's completely out of place. The director has no concept of pacing or tone. He doesn't make the least effort to create a sense of fear or dread, or even /frighten/ the audience, something that even awful '50s flicks attempt.

If ""MS vs GO"" is /supposed/ to be a spoof, ya coulda fooled /me/. The closest it approaches satire is the way the Japanese scientist (Vic Chao) talks like the scientists & reporters in a Godzilla movie. The writer (one ""Ace Hannah"" -- is that the screenwriting equivalent of Alan Smithee?) misses many opportunities to skewer the genre.

The CGI is cheap-looking, but appears to have been so expensive (relative to the minuscule budget) that the same shots are used over and over and over again. Even after the shark has bitten off part of a tentacle, the following scenes show the octopus intact. The shark more or less resembles a shark, but the octopus looks like a cheap plastic toy. And when they finally battle it out, it looks like /two/ cheap plastic toys struggling in a bathtub of dirty water. Say what you like about the films surrounding them, but Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion animation had /style/, something utterly missing from this film. The closest it gets to style is -- what appears to be -- the dying octopus waving ""bye-bye"" at the end.

A great party flick. But make a note of the best sections so you can skip to them. Your friends aren't likely to tolerate sitting through all 90 minutes.",1296518400,,2018,4.686440677966102

3801501,1,B001UIY73C,"Quick, what's part-shark, part-octopus, and gorges itself on stupid morons just dying to be eaten?

Before there was Sharktopus, there was Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus.

It all starts with Debbie Gibson in a submarine.  Read that carefully.  Debbie.  Gibson.  Submarine. Got that?  Good.

So the U.S. government is trying to shatter the ice shelf, which accidentally releases a carcharocles megalodon (Mega Shark) and octopus giganteus (Giant Octopus). Never mind that they were frozen in ice and instantly come to life as soon as the iceberg is shattered.  Point being they're free to continue their battle, which is to chase each other around in the ocean, destroying battleships, submarines, and slow-moving jetliners in the process.

Then Lorenzo Lamas shows up as a government representative, with an evil-mandated ponytail (of course).  The entire purpose of his existence is apparently to contradict everything Gibson says with a snarky aside.

As an acting exercise, this is a terrible film.  The stultifying presence of Lamas' perpetual sneer and Gibson's wide-eyed, heavily-made up gawk create such a black hole of suck that the only reason the octopus and the shark don't get pulled into it is because they're so big.

As a gore-fest, this is a terrible film.  The monsters are so large that there really isn't any gore to speak of.  They just smash poorly rendered CG of planes, trains, and automobiles.

As a kaiju monster battle, this is a terrible film.  The monsters never appear in their full glory; instead, the octopus lamely wraps a tentacle or two around the shark.  Then, because the guys at movie house Asylum obviously didn't have enough budget, they replay the scene again.  Then they flip it and replay it again in the vain hope you don't notice. We noticed.

As a film, this is a terrible film.  The hand actor who uses different nail polish to pilot the submarine is obviously not Gibson, who doesn't wear the same polish.  ""Science"" consists of brightly colored beakers poured into test tubes. Battleships fire in just one direction (forward) even though the giant monsters - the proverbial broad side of a barn - are right next to them...because Asylum couldn't get stock footage of the guns turning.

Don't be fooled by the fact that the trailer for this movie went viral.  Those are the only good scenes in the entire film, and they alone are not enough to save it. No, nothing can save it; not even the combined superpowers of Debbie Gibson and Lorenzo Lamas.

3801505,3,B001UIY73C,"I saw part of ""Mega Shark Versus Giant Octopus"" when it had its cable TV premier on the idiotically renamed Syfy channel a few months ago. I knew I had to obtain it for my library. How could I not, it has all the stars in the cheese universe perfectly aligned: ridiculous title, ludicrous plot, complete lack of knowledge about sharks, octopi, or the military weaponry needed to fight them, preachy environmentalist plotpoints, terrible acting, and cast members that Ed Wood could only dream of, most notably Debbie (oh sorry, Deborah) ""Shake Your Love"" Gibson, and master cheese maker Lorenzo Lamas. It's a perfect conflagration.

The film starts in the mountains (?) of Alaska, and after a very long credit sequence, progresses to oceanologist Emma (Debbie Gibson) driving a stolen submarine under a glacial icecap while a helicopter hovers overhead dropping a secret buoy into the water which makes a pod of whales get suicidal, and ram into a glacier freeing two long-frozen combatants, a huge shark and really huge octopus from millions of years of freezer burn. For some reason the helicopter crashes, and Gibson doesn't know about the buoy, but the helicopter pilot intones over the radio that it's a secret and that it could endanger national security. But Debbie hijacked the sub, right? So why is the secret government helicopter helping her look for whales? What? Huh? This is just the first five minutes of the movie. Unfortunately it gets way less lucid from there.

Shortly Gibson gets fired from her job, and goes to live with her old brilliant professor, Lamar (Sean Lawlor) who was booted out of the Navy for running a nuclear sub aground to avoid hitting a pod of dolphins. Oh yes, there's more true-to-life backstory for you. Meanwhile, a deep-ocean oil rig gets eaten by the giant octopus, while the giant shark gets busy by jumping 30,000 feet in the air and eating a 747 in cruise flight. Truly, Asylum Home Entertainment really pulled out all the stops on this creature feature. And the CGI is so lifelike, too!

There's a lot of extremely ponderous dialogue in the movie, much of it with a brain-addled environmentalist bent, but also lots of terrible pillow talk, ridiculous science talk, and perhaps worst of all, oodles of military and nautical jargon horribly misused by the screenwriters. A favorite example is when in a discussion of the release of the giant creatures Debbie says ""Maybe this is our comeuppance."" Why would that be? Oh, of course: it's because man is melting the polar ice caps with his global warming releasing these prehistoric predators. The shark and octopus dyad is also analogized to Hurricane Katrina. I am not even kidding.

There are two scenes of shark versus battleship (there are no battleships in the active Navy inventory, by the way, but that is picking at nits) and at one point the shark manages to set a hijacked Finnish oil tanker on fire after it was hijacked by pirates. How did the shark do that? Some unnamed government agency headed by Lorenzo Lamas (as Allan Baxter, complete with ponytail) interrogates Emma, Lamar, and Emma's new love interest, the pointedly Japanese Seiji Shimada (Vic Chao, who probably turns in the best performance of the movie) in a room that Lamar accuses of having ""the same lighting as Guantanamo"". Got to get every popular anti-government jab in, no matter how laughably executed.

After the eye-rolling exhortation ""Sharkzilla's going to own the seas!"" from Lamas, the scientists come up with a plan to corral them in San Francisco and Tokyo Bays for the shark and octopus respectively. But how to lure them? While working under armed guard, Emma suddenly feels...urges...and invites Seiji into the broom closet to help shake her love. It's then they get their ""ah ha"" moment...pheromones! They will synthesize giant octopus and mega shark pheromones to lure them to their respective bays ""using UAV technology"". Again...what?!? Really?

After the gratuitous destruction of an F-15/F-14/F-18 (depending on which piece of the stock footage you were paying attention to) by an octopus tentacle, we get a load of pontification from Emma analogizing herself to Einstein and Oppenheimer and the decision to build the atomic bomb. (Seriously.) After some submerged action of a highly ridiculous nature, they release the shark pheromone with much ado, the shark accelerates to 500 knots underwater (marine engineers, feel free to chime in on hydrodynamics here) and the Octopus is cornered in Tokyo Bay by similar means. The shark promptly gets loose, eats the Golden Gate Bridge (why?) and Lamas considers the nuclear option prompting disgraced Irish former submariner Lamar to say that the nuclear option is preferred by the US government because ""that's the military way."" This only goes to prove not only the reflexive ideology of the filmmakers, but their total lack of grasp on actual US military policy, training, or strategy. Not that I should expect much from a movie like this, of course.

Emma decides that the way to get rid of them is to have them battle each other, so a flotilla of navy ships and submarines puts to sea with more pheromones attracting the two combatants to each other. All goes about like you would expect, with massive causalities (""All five ships destroyed by octopus!"") and Emma and Lamar taking their submarine through an ice floe to lose the pursuing shark (which is, of course, impossible if he can swim faster than most jets can fly). Obviously the final smackdown happens in good time, and amid clouds of ink in a ferocious battle, the two prehistoric killing machines sink out of sight. Are they dead? Wait for the sequel.

The film ends with lovebirds Emma and Seiji planning their future dreamily on a beach (their chemistry is...uh...amazing) when Lamar walks up and requests their services to help identify another giant life form in the North Sea. Groan.

I gave the film three stars. I would have given it four for camp value but the complete ignorance of the subject matter and portrayals of the US military as idiots lowered the rating. Submariners are not likely to mutiny by pulling a pistol on their skipper, but then again they aren't likely to battle a giant shark either. This film takes itself way too seriously for the subject matter, but would have made an excellent MST3K.

 - Lorenzo Lamas chewed up scenery like there was no food available for the entire shoot.
 - Deborah Gibson's and Vic Chao's (Seijii) characters had less than zero romantic chemistry, yet were paired as a romantic couple.  Emma and Seijii's canoodling was creepy beyond measure.
 - Ms. Gibson was terrible as a grim, and determined, Emma.  Surprisingly, Ms. Gibson was pretty good at portraying a happy, snarky, Emma.
 - The set for the submarine was so cheap, and cheesy.  Yet, the same set was used, with virtually no changes, to represent other locations.

The most dramatic part is when the shark attacks their sub and they play the music really, really loud and fast and the actors fall all over to pretend the sub is in the sharks jaws. I think the director and script writer conspiracy to make these people look incredibly bad would have gotten better screenplay. You'll find more suspense staring at a cat napping.

There are two scenes of shark versus battleship (there are no battleships in the active Navy inventory, by the way, but that is picking at nits) and at one point the shark manages to set a hijacked Finnish oil tanker on fire after it was hijacked by pirates. How did the shark do that? Some unnamed government agency headed by Lorenzo Lamas (as Allan Baxter, complete with ponytail) interrogates Emma, Lamar, and Emma's new love interest, the pointedly Japanese Seiji Shimada (Vic Chao, who probably turns in the best performance of the movie) in a room that Lamar accuses of having ""the same lighting as Guantanamo"". Got to get every popular anti-government jab in, no matter how laughably executed.

After the eye-rolling exhortation ""Sharkzilla's going to own the seas!"" from Lamas, the scientists come up with a plan to corral them in San Francisco and Tokyo Bays for the shark and octopus respectively. But how to lure them? While working under armed guard, Emma suddenly feels...urges...and invites Seiji into the broom closet to help shake her love. It's then they get their ""ah ha"" moment...pheromones! They will synthesize giant octopus and mega shark pheromones to lure them to their respective bays ""using UAV technology"". Again...what?!? Really?

After the gratuitous destruction of an F-15/F-14/F-18 (depending on which piece of the stock footage you were paying attention to) by an octopus tentacle, we get a load of pontification from Emma analogizing herself to Einstein and Oppenheimer and the decision to build the atomic bomb. (Seriously.) After some submerged action of a highly ridiculous nature, they release the shark pheromone with much ado, the shark accelerates to 500 knots underwater (marine engineers, feel free to chime in on hydrodynamics here) and the Octopus is cornered in Tokyo Bay by similar means. The shark promptly gets loose, eats the Golden Gate Bridge (why?) and Lamas considers the nuclear option prompting disgraced Irish former submariner Lamar to say that the nuclear option is preferred by the US government because ""that's the military way."" This only goes to prove not only the reflexive ideology of the filmmakers, but their total lack of grasp on actual US military policy, training, or strategy. Not that I should expect much from a movie like this, of course.

Emma decides that the way to get rid of them is to have them battle each other, so a flotilla of navy ships and submarines puts to sea with more pheromones attracting the two combatants to each other. All goes about like you would expect, with massive causalities (""All five ships destroyed by octopus!"") and Emma and Lamar taking their submarine through an ice floe to lose the pursuing shark (which is, of course, impossible if he can swim faster than most jets can fly). Obviously the final smackdown happens in good time, and amid clouds of ink in a ferocious battle, the two prehistoric killing machines sink out of sight. Are they dead? Wait for the sequel.

The film ends with lovebirds Emma and Seiji planning their future dreamily on a beach (their chemistry is...uh...amazing) when Lamar walks up and requests their services to help identify another giant life form in the North Sea. Groan.

The DVD comes with extras, notably a lame ""making of"" feature and some bloopers, which aren't especially funny. Feel free to skip both. I gave the film three stars. I would have given it four for camp value but the complete ignorance of the subject matter and portrayals of the US military as idiots lowered the rating. Submariners are not likely to mutiny by pulling a pistol on their skipper, but then again they aren't likely to battle a giant shark either. This film takes itself way too seriously for the subject matter, but would have made an excellent MST3K. This would make an excellent Christmas gift for the lover of cinematic cheese in your life.",1279324800,4,6553,4.933816863100635

3801514,2,B001UIY73C,"Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus (2009) sounds like a monster battle flick from the 60's, and it's a rather poorly done, drawn out adventure, featuring two creatures that come to life after being freed from being frozen in ice.  The monsters are not presented very well, and hardly appear until the end.

Singer/actress Deborah Gibson (Electric Youth), is oceanographer Emma MacNeil, she is teamed with her old college professor Lamar Sanders (Sean Lawlor), and Dr. Seiji Shimada (Vic Chao) from Japan, to try and figure out what they are up against.  MacNeil and Shimada become lovers, and tumble onto the idea of using pheromones to trap the beasts.  Shimada heads back to Tokyo to try and bait the giant octopus, while the US team try to tackle the mega shark in the San Francisco area.  The shark is unbelievably huge, and its behavior is completely ridiculous, leaping out of the ocean to chomp on an airliner, and also the Golden Gate Bridge!  Failing to stop either creature, the last option plan is to pit them against each other.

This is a terribly unrealistic film that disrespects the US Navy, by presenting the service as completely incompetent, inept, and lacking in military discipline.  The huge mega shark, somehow falls off sonar screens, and then pops up and destroys a navy destroyer.  A submarine achieves unrealistic speeds, and features a mutinous helmsman, and a suicidal commander.  This is complete madness, where because of the incompetence of Navy personnel, the civilian scientists assume command positions.

In a starring role, Deborah Gibson's performance may surprise some, as she does OK with some pretty dreadful material.  The philosophical Chao sprouts out his lines, seemingly channeling Sulu from Star Trek.  A ponytailed Lorenzo Lamas, plays a total irritating and obnoxious bureaucrat, who is mysteriously in charge of the operation.

The special effects are not very impressive, as the creatures are mostly seen battling each other in dark murky waters.  In addition to trashing the US Navy, the ending of the movie is completely lame and weak.  If you are an old Debbie Gibson fan, you might want to see how the lady is holding up nearing forty, but otherwise there isn't much to recommend about this one, written and directed by Jack Perez (La Cucaracha).

So, with that said, how bad is this movie?  Pretty bad.

An experimental sonar system sets free two prehistoric beasts that have been in suspended animation, frozen for millions of years up near Alaska.  One is a giant octopus and the other one is a megalodon.  They were frozen while duking it out millions of yrs ago.  Guess what?  You guessed  it - now they're ready for Round 2.

The Sy Fy channel has put out a plethora of monster movies, and some are pretty fun.  This one is kinda fun.  Unfortunately, the FX are far more cheesy than even most Sy Fy flicks.  On top of that, the ""seawater"" is tinted so dark that you can barely make out what's going on.

This is an example of a movie that is made without the producers or anyone else affiliated with the project knowing ANYTHING about the military.  There is a battleship in the film & they call it a destroyer.  What's worse, the film-makers have obviously never seen a battleship's  18 inch guns firing, as the salvos fired in no way resemble the way it really looks.

Also, there is a fighter pilot flying an F-14 (Navy) and he is addressed as a Colonel (there are no Colonels in the Navy!).  Lorenzo Lamas remarks that they're unable to locate the sea beasts with SR-71s.  Hello!  SR-71s have been moth-bolled since the early 80s!  They were made obsolete by spy satellites.  If he had said they were searching for them with P-3 Orions, then that would @ least be semi-plausible.

OK, I know that B-movies are not supposed to be nit-picked.  I will end this review with the one aspect that makes the present film remotely intriguing:  Deborah Gibson.  For those (like me!) who grew up in the 80s, she's better known as former pop-star Debbie Gibson.  After posing for PLAYBOY, she's now trying her hand @ making B-movies.  Nothing wrong w/that!

If you want a fun monster movie that's not to be taken seriously, then MAYBE this one is worth a look.

Debbie Gibson's finest hour comes with a gritty, mesmerizing performance in what has to be described as the film of the decade.

The plot, written by premier director Jack Perez, focuses on the age old undersea battle between the two aquatic giants of the sea, which, as we all know, is that of the Shark and the Octopus.

It was only after watching the film 8 times I was informed that the crisp special effects had been done using CGI......incredible! The shark is so lifelike I literally voided my bowels every time this nauseating monster came into shot Perhaps the biggest highlight, of this orgasmic blockbuster, is the romantic sub plot involving Gibson and Vic Chao. Thrown together in a time of world catastrophe the two scientists battle masterfully subtle feelings of sexual tension........now I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but lets just say there is a groundbreaking, red hot conclusion that will leave you shocked and stunned ;) The sequel, Massive Panda vs. Quite Tall Aardvark, is due to hit our screens early in 2010, and, if this film is anything to go by, you will need to make advanced bookings at your local cinemas.

I don't know why I keep doing these things to myself. This is the movie equivalent of self-harming. Maybe it's a cry for attention.

This ""masterpiece"" from the aptly named ""Asylum"" production company is about a prehistoric Megalodon (Mega shark, get it?) and a giant octopus (pretty straightforward that one) that were locked in battle 10 million years ago and frozen in ice. They manage to get free (somehow they are still alive!!!) by some US government interference (grrrrrrr! Those guys, don't get me started!) and they race off around the world causing various disasters (the monsters, not the US government). These disasters include some of the most ridiculous scenes I have ever witnessed in a film.

At one point the ""mega shark"" jumps into the air to attack a jet airliner!!! Considering that aircraft like that usually fly at over 30,000 ft, that has to rank simply stupid. No matter what film it's in. It also bites a chunk out of the Golden Gate Bridge!

Anyway some ""scientists"" get hijacked by a government official (grrrrrrr!), who turns out to be Falcon Crest's Lorenzo Lamas and they have to come up with plan to capture/kill the silly creatures. One of the scientists is Debbie Gibson, teen pop sensation from the 80's! She's accompanied by a stereotypical Japanese guy (sayonara!) and a Dubliner (Jaysis howaya!) So, er...the world is in pretty safe hands. Either way, through the use of incredibly ridiculous plot devices (even for a film with this title) they manage to get the two terrible CGI leviathan's to have a fight...hence the name.

The producers of this rubbish are so desperate to latch onto that dubious B-movie glory, that everything is played straight as if they were trying to make a serious movie in the first place and ended up with an Ed Wood feature instead. The problem is that Ed Wood really was trying to make serious pictures and failed, due to various reasons, but left us with with some B-movie gold (although I have to admit I've never been a fan). However, 'Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus' is flashing it's mediocrity all over the place and hoping that it'll fall into that category and because of that distain for the audience, it's ends up being un-enjoyable.

Unfortunately, explaining the premise of this film is SO much better than having to actually sit through it. The movie is just too stupid to be entertaining. It's knowingly trying to hit that ""so bad it's good"" vibe, but it fails miserably because it's doing it in a deliberate way.

Oh that silly Asylum is up to it again this time bringing forth two giant creatures from the sea to do battle. Well that is of course if they don't kill all of us as well, oh them crazy monsters. The Asylum Productions is one of my favorite production companies because they actually don't care and put out not only stuff like this but Mock Busters as well. Those would be the rip offs of other successful films out there, yes you read that right. Still this is an Asylum production so you really can't expect much these days, except the director is actually good. Well at least he was when he directed one of the best the company had called ""666 The Child"", and an excellent episode of Hercules The Legendary Journey [also wrote a Xena episode].

The film follows some researchers who are in the artic or something and accidentally release two frozen monsters from their icy cages. You guessed it a giant shark, sorry Mega, and a giant octopus, got that one right. Once that happens both creatures whom I guess were frozen in mist of a battle with one another instantly go opposite directions and start killing all humans on the sea or in the air [even planes are not safe]. So countries come together and try to first capture and then kill the creatures. Of course that does not work so they lure them together to continue their once legendary battle.

This is exactly what you think of when you think B movie with little in way of a budget, really it is that horrible. The CGI for the creatures are just laughable but hey I guess that is all they could afford. But the writing and direction of Jack Perez whom I like and have enjoyed some of his other work must have just done this for the pay check. I would like to think that he was held down by the budget and his vision was dramatically altered, I hope. His film for Asylum called ""666 The Child"" was excellent for low budget fare and was a great low budget version of ""The Omen"". But this one is so bad it could be good depending if you like this type of stuff. Also the acting in this is down right awful most of the time with only a few moments of decency.

This film is bad and I mean it is really bad with horrible CGI monster jumping out of the water eating planes and a huge shark taking a chunk off of the Golden Gate Bridge.

Two mortal enemies from the ice age are released due to the melting of the ice shelf.  Sent to save the world is Debbie Gibson? and Lorenzo Lamas?.  The casting alone adds to the giggle factor.  The shark stakes out the west coast as his territory and the octopus chooses the coast of Japan.

Each of our giant critters have their own hilarious and improbable destruction scenes.  The shark manages to fly from the ocean and swallow a airliner-he also bites the Golden Gate Bridge in half.  Octopus slaps a military jet to pieces-admittedly the jet is only flying 100 feet above the water-I was laughing so hard at these scenes, tears were literally running down my face.  I had to wipe them a few more times watching Lorenzo Lamas trying to act macho, and Debbie Gibson not acting at all.

Heavy artillary fire and torpedoes and explosion do nothing to slow the rampaging creatures so Debbie has the brilliant idea to lure the mortal enemies together and let them kill each other.

This leads to a death battle that makes the viewer start to chuckle, that leads to a guffaw, that leads to an all out belly laugh.

3801539,3,B001UIY73C,"Watched this thing last night.

Okay, let's see...

Cool premise. I mean, really, a big shark versus a massive octopus? That just reeks cool.

The story was more or less solid. Some parts were predictable, especially the ""how to get rid of them"" part.

The acting . . . well, aside from Deborah Gibson, who I thought was the most believable in terms of how she presented her character (except when she screwed around with Vic Chao, which seemed really out of the blue), needed lots of work. Seemed forced in a lot of ways, but this is a B-movie we're talking about so I was willing to not nitpick the acting because I just wanted to see shark vs octopus action.

The special FX were okay, a 6 or so on a scale of 1-10. Some stuff looked super fake. Others, namely the underwater sequences, looked real. My only issue with the underwater stuff was that you lost all sense of scale because there was nothing to compare these guys to (as compared to when the shark took a huge bite out of the Golden Gate Bridge). However, you did get your sense of scale when the submarines tried to take the shark on.

The shark vs octopus fight was pretty good. How often do you see a giant octopus wrap its tentacles around a shark's entire body? I just wish, though, there was the budget to drag it out because the fight was kind of short-lived and was very simple in terms of the ""fight moves"" from each creature. Likewise, other shots of the creatures throughout the movie were just a glimpse here and there.

On a fun scale, this gets an 7 out of 10, but my official rating is a 5. I think there was better acting in Transmorphers, and, well, guess I am nitpicking a little.

Next thing you know, they will have a shark so big, it can swallow an Aircraft Carrier WHOLE, or an octopus so big, it could reach out of N.Y. Harbour and rip the Empire State Building apart!

If the Acadamy Awards had a ""worst film of the year award"" this movie would win hands down (or should I say ""tentacles down""?).

Grade: C+

O.K., the title says it all. If you want to see a mega shark fight a giant octopus, this is your movie. (When I first saw the preview, I knew this was my type of movie...) But, after much debating, I decided that the problems with the movie outweigh the good things about the movie. (Any movie with a title like THAT deserves some sort of credit....)

The title is basically the plot, so there's not much to say there--it's the actors that really surprised me. Deborah Gibson and Lorenzo Lamas--along with all the other actors--play their parts like they really weren't in a movie with that title--they all have energy to their acting in Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus. The acting is probably what saves this movie.

What really hurts Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus though is its budget. Obviously small, the movie dreams big, but doesn't have the money to back up those dreams. The CGI looks like it could fit right in a video game, and it's not even shown much. The scenes of mega shark (Charcarodon Megalodon) and giant octopus (the Kraken) are brief, and you only see fast, jittery action. For example, when the Megalodon catches a plane, the camera cuts back and forth, as to not show the shark that much. It was a cool scene though.

In the end it's not that Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus is bad, it's just that it's ambitions were too high, and the budget too low. In the hands of Steven Spielberg, this film would have been a summer smash. (It was actually set for a summer release, and in 3-D! But then they cut some of the budget, and took away the 3-D. Then they cut more of the budget, and decided not to show it in theaters. Then they cut even more of the budget, and managed a straight-to-DVD release. Maybe the economy had something to do...nah. The economy DEFINITLY had something to do with this...)",1245715200,4,1864,4.470588235294118
3801549,3,B001UIY73C,"...and here's why:
When I saw the previews I was pretty excited. Here was a 21st century production that reminded me of childhood Saturday's watching old Godzilla movies. I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. When it arrived I got the kids together and put it on. Now, don't get me wrong. So much of this film is exactly what I expected. Silly, exciting, entertaining. What I didn't like was the moments of course language and the sex scene. Totally not needed in this kind of movie that should really be a true ""G"" rated film in order to rate up there with the most popular ""B"" movies of the 50's and 60's. If not for that, I would've easily given it 5 stars for pure ""FUN""!",1245456000,9,676,4.248062015503876

3801551,1,B001UIY73C,"Come!  See a giant prehistoric Megaladon shark jump from the ocean depths into the sky to snatch an airliner out of the sky!  Come!

See a giant prehistoric Megaladon shark, who seems to get bigger throughout the movie, take a bite out of a U.S. Navy battleship!  Come!  See a giant prehistoric Megaladon shark take a bite out of a major U.S. landmark!

Seriously though - Wow, just wow, that's all I can say.  I'm a fan of B movies and the cheesier the better.  I also rarely, IF EVER, would utter the comment ""that was the worst movie that I have ever seen"".  However, I found myself saying just that as I watched this cinematic cheese fest.  Basically, this movie is about a prehistoric Megaladon shark and octupus who are awakened out of a prehistoric deep freeze by a government (at least I think it was a government experiment, it never says) experiment.  Debbie Gibson just happens to be under water in a mini-sub when this happens and catches it on tape.  She, along with other scientists and a lone survivor of one of the beast attackes (who, for some unexplained reason is locked away forever in prison for surviving the attack), then began to be followed by ""the government"" for whatever reason.  The two beasts then begin to wreak global havoc (if taking out a few ships can really be considered global havoc and a threat to mankind) and must be stopped.  As has already been stated by others (and in case you are clueless, it's all meant as sarcasm), Debbie Gibson and Lorenzo Lamas give Academy Award winning performances (as does the rest of the cast which is like 20 people) in this film.  Debbie Gibson is some kind of marine biologist/scientist and Lorenzo Lamas is the black suit wearing, pony tailed, secret government/ military operative (or whatever he was supposed to be since they don't bother telling you) happily sacrificing U.S. service personnel in the name of eradicating the global meance of the shark and octopus.

If you like cheese with your movie (and I'm talking Limberger here), completely ridiculous scripts that were written by 10 year olds who somehow got enough money from someone to make a movie, CGI effects made by the same 10 year old on their desktop computer, the same background/supplemental/CGI scene shown over and over again instead of filming something different, watching people who must have been picked off of the street at the last minute try to act, and sitting through a movie that begins to make taking your own life seem like a pleasant alternative, than this is the THE MOVIE for you - let me tell you!",1243382400,9,2648,4.682505399568035

An example of how bad this movie is: There is a scene where a pilot is flying an Air Force jet. A giant tentacle comes out of the water. Cut to the pilot saying ""Mayday I'm going down"". Then cut to the same scene only this time the tentacle hits the jet and destroys it. There are also numerous scenes where the audio is off track. I felt like I was watching a dubbed Godzilla movie.

Deborah Gibson actually steals this movie from time to time, When you're not watching the monsters chew on the planes-boats-scenery.
