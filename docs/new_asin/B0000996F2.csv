7990179,5,B0000996F2,"I had taped this movie on a VHS tape years ago when it aired on TV.  I watched it again recently and loved it just as much as the first time I saw it.  It is a movie I talk about often.  I regretted that I hadn't transferred the VHS version onto DVD as I watched it recently, never thinking there was a DVD copy out there.  Naturally, I was thrilled to learn it was indeed out on DVD. The ending makes the whole movie although the writing for the story leading up to it is excellent also.",1253923200,3,488,3.9489795918367347
