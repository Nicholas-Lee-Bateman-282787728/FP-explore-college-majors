377624,2,6301758641,"The quality of this version is good, and it has some nice bonus features, however I don't like the movie. There's 0 character development for the first cliche filled 45 minutes. The latter half of the film gets slightly better with some interesting ideas but over all it steals ideas from Miami Vice, Manhunter, Lethal Weapon, The French Connection and other popular movies and tv of that era without the writers and producers having an understanding of the material. It's like a film student made it, that's how pretentious and pointless it is. The only reason you'd want to see this is for the car chase, and it is AMAZING, rivaling the one in French Connection. It's too bad that it's brought down by the lack of reason for its being.",1499212800,,737,4.633587786259542

377678,4,6301758641,"Review-There are very few films that hold a special place in my heart. That film that I can watch over and over again. Each time, will feel just like the first time. I was a 17 year old Jr. College student in 1985. I called my dad, when I got off from work and asked him if he wanted to meet me at the movies. I remember it was November 6th, the show started at 9:45. I bought the tickets early, so my dad would not buy them. We went into this very empty theater, with a big bag of popcorn and two sodas. I remember the film trailers being  Runaway Train. Which I whispered to my father that we have to see this film. The next one was  Spies Like Us, my dad was laughing at the gags and I knew that we would be seeing that as well. The last trailer being  Aliens. I was so stoked and I knew that my father hated horror films or science fiction, so he was not game. ( That being said though, my dad loved Predator and Terminator, you figure? ) You could hear the projector upstairs start to crackle. ( Which means it has finished the last trailer and the splice tape is going thru the projector to indicate the film was next) To Live and Die in L.A. is all about a federal agent named Richard Chance. He is the one that does not know about a rule book. Who dances to the beat of his own drummer. He has the delivery of a guilty priest and the outlook of a devil may care basket case. In this film, he is trying to avenge the death of his partner. The catch is, he retires in less than two days. You can clearly tell with this film, that Miami Vice and its popularity seemed to help out. While both were released around the same time, it seems this film needed Vice and maybe Dirty Harry as a litmus paper of sorts. This film is very graphic in the way it depicts violence and action. When action happens on the screen, it is shot very believable and intense. This film reeks of the sleek coolness of the late 80s, The musical score in this film really captures the time and setting very well. The music in this film play like a romance of sorts. The way this film is shot is definitely different and at times borders on unpredictable. The acting, the strong screen presences and the charisma, make this film such a must watch. If we are talking 80s treasures that should be on blu ray, I am still holding out for Band of the Hand, TuffTurf and Police Academy. The sad part of watching this blu ray, is that my dad is not alive to enjoy this with me. I always miss my little buddy after films, to go down the road and get a bite to eat and talk about the movie we just watched. Movies are not meant to be torn down by people who think they are better than or above them, they are meant to be cherished. Create a memory that will last you for your lifetime. That one memory that sparkles in the rain.",1477526400,4,2797,4.081818181818182

So when i saw this video, I was excited to get it. But my question is ""what's the difference between the collectors edition and the regular version (the other on advertised)?""

377684,2,6301758641,"I was pretty young when this movie originally came out (single digits), so I never managed to see it until one of my older friends brought it over the other evening.  He was adamant that it had a great chase scene, was kind of slow, but was a great movie.  My wife and I just managed to sit through it, trying to maintain a cheerful face for our friend who very obviously enjoyed it.  Through sheer determination my wife did not pull out her Kindle, and I did not fire up my laptop and distract myself.  If he hadn't of been there, though, we would have turned the movie off.

It was probably a very inventive and well written movie for the time, but for me at least it hasn't aged well.  Almost every part of it screams out 80's.  A lot of the ""police procedural"" elements are here.  The tropes come out in force.  A partner is killed who has a few days until retirement.  His partner now has to deal with a new partner (but apparently only a few minutes of screen time grief).  This dude is a loose cannon and doesn't do things by the book.  He has an angry captain.  The new partner has some dubious connections that both help them track down the main bad guy, but also bring into question his own connections.

On the other side, it was really neat to see the actual process of counterfeiting played out.  The actual bad guy is played well by Willem Dafoe, but registered rather high on the creepy scale.

The interactions with the handful of women in the movie are rather awkward and painful to watch.  The snitch seems to be trapped in a life she doesn't want, and I'm not entirely sure what part Dafoe's ginger girlfriend is supposed to play in the machinations aside from ""honeypot"".

Overall, the story is incredibly cliched from the standpoint of someone who grew up watching all of the movies that came after it.  It is possible that these cliches and tropes didn't exist when this movie was made, and that it was new and fresh.  I don't have the wealth of experience to draw from to know that.  I can see possible influences the movie had on Heat, which I consider the best cops and robbers movie ever made.

Overall, I would not watch again.",1467072000,3,2154,4.35929648241206
377685,4,6301758641,"I thoroughly enjoyed seeing TO LIVE AND DIE IN LA again.  My Special Edition cost  $19.95.  Good price with the special features including good enough director William Friedkin's commentary and the better ""making of documentary"".  Star of movie William Petersen explains how airport security refused to allow him to run through the crowded airport scene!  Really?!  Airport dudes that is so high school; and if you have seen movie you know the scene.  Petersen ran though the airport anyways ... ""Screw You.""
The best thing about the extras is the alternative ending.  It really is a hoot!  Petersen agrees stating, ""This was not an Eddie Murphy movie.""  Indeed.  Thank god they didn't use it.
But, despite (to me) LIVE AND DIE LA'(S) not realistic closing of the opening sequence with the terrorist on the roof ... and the explosion!?  Where did all the debris go?  The Secret Service guys were right NEXT to him ... shoulda' been messier, no?
Anyways, TO LIVE AND DIE IN LA is a cop-thriller masterpiece (for the 80's) that does not lose (much) of its scathing, authentic, cynical viewpoint (message?); and the feel of this counterfeit, neon LA world is given life (still) by that Wang Chung soundtrack.  Whoda' thunk Wang's sound would hold up but it does in this gripping 80's action movie where almost nobody can be trusted.  Not even the protagonist cops.
Comparison's to Director Friedkin's French Connection are noteworthy.  Good question (and argument) to which one is better?!  Both are definitely good for the two different decades they represent.
But, the 'wrong way' car chase scene (Live and Die in LA) is famous for good reason; there's at least one great story twist; and that stunning (close to the end) ending.
Willem Dafoe as the painter is also a lethal counterfeiter on the side.  It's fairly amazing Dafoe did not get type cast as bad guy after this early performance.
Check out this pretty seedy LA world again.  It's just TO LIVE AND DIE for ... cynical 80's style.",1463011200,10,1989,4.831360946745562

377759,4,6301758641,"Although it generated a profit back in '85, To Live and Die in LA has long since slipped off the popular radar, known to little outside its cult fan base. The reasons for its relative obscurity likely reside in a couple of factors. One, the film is a time capsule, its aesthetics and synthetic score drenched in mid-eighties hell. Two, it is, simply put, a ruthless film. I imagine few people saw this thing a second time during its first run. The story utterly refuses to give you a hero, shoving a big one-finger salute in the face of average conventions. Ironically, it's the very nihilism dripping off the movie that makes the experience seem more relevant now than it did way back when. William Friedkin sets a pace nearly as pitiless as the characters, culminating in a truly intense car chase, one of the best ever filmed. The actors are well cast, from Petersen's smug passion, to Dafoe's stony villainy. Sure, some of the dialogue flirts with camp, but it's perfect for the neo-noir genre.  The DVD's extras include the film's alternative end, which, thankfully, was not used.",1419984000,3,1085,4.7407407407407405

Even as I was watching it, it seemed to capture the vibe of that time, the culture and Miami Vice fashion-esque pastel feel, which is usually rare when you are in the middle of living it, that usually comes after the time has passed in refection. As I recall it did not do well at the box office, which is a shame. It is a taunt suspense thriller, one of Friedkins best. Yes, the car chase is/was compared with Friedkins own watershed car chase in THE FRENCH CONNECTION, but it stands on its own and fits great into the plot. When you are a great filmmaker there are always those who will continually compare past and current works, that is the pitfall of fame and as a film buff its best to ignore that stuff and just watch the film and judge for yourself. Its a wild and unpredictable ride worth adding to your disc collection.

377841,3,6301758641,"Note: I saw this movie yesterday via XFinity On Demand.

MILD SPOILERS!!!

The concept of the film has intrigued me for some time, and I decided to view it yesterday. William Petersen, in one of his earliest roles, is a Secret Service Agent who vows to bring down the criminal who murdered his partner, and he does a lot of things that make you want to hate hi, but at the same time, you can't help liking him. The acting is really good, particularly from good guy/rogue agent Petersen and coldblooded counterfeiter Willem Dafoe. Well-written script, too. The ending, though, didn't work for me on one level, but it made sense thematically. The alternate ending, available on the Special Edition DVD & on YouTube, is very good, and nowhere as bad as the director makes it out to be. However, the ending used in the final cut of the picture works much better.

My only problem is with the several misuses of God's Name. That seems to be a major content concern in almost every movie made from the late 1970's to now. Why film-makers feel the need to profane the Name of God in a movie is beyond my understanding. The Bible saith,
""Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His Name in vain.""

To Live and Die in LA is a perfect storm of action, suspense and a kickin soundtrack by Wang Chung.

William Petersen plays a secret service agent named Richard Chance (love that name) who, when he's not jumping off suspension bridges with a wire attached to his leg, stops an Assassin from getting the President. When his partner says, 'I'm too old for this,' you can be forgiven for laughing. This movie came out a year before Lethal Weapon.

Soon, Chance is tracking Rick Masters (another cool name) played by Willem Dafoe, an artist who's also a top notch counterfeiter.

Despite being with the Secret Service, Chance isn't a nice guy. He threatens his confidential informant with prison, after having sex with her.

As Peterson gets more desperate to catch Masters he and his partner Vukovich (another cool name) start taking more chances (get it?).

All this culminates with a kidnapping/chase against traffic on the California highway system.

It should be pointed out that William Friedkin liked to have his car chases reflect the personality of the characters in the chase, i.e. in the French Connection, the French man, an upper class drug dealer, is on an elevated train while Gene Hackman, a street cop, pursues him in a car from the ground.

Get it? They're on two different levels. Literally.

Here, Chance has broken every law he has sworn to uphold and is heading in the wrong direction. Literally.

This movie takes it's main characters to places none want to go and does so with great style.

Willem Dafoe is good (as usual) as the bad guy here, but Peterson is just trying too damn hard, and the entire film suffers for it. The hammy dialog doesn't help, ultimately proving that a great car chase does not a great film make.

Although I love the first Beverly Hills Cop, I think this movie was intended to be the precise opposite of that sort of film. Hard, gritty, with a deadly cast where the cops are just as determined as the criminals. This is to the world of counterfeiters and the secret service agents that track them the way that Jack Bauer and 24 is to the war on terror. Hyper-elevated reality, I guess you could say.

As you will learn from the documentary, many of the scenes of the movie were filmed after the actors were told to practice a scene. Then the director (William Friedkin) would say ""cut"", and they'd use that in the film!

I ended up buying the Wang Chung soundtrack to this film after seeing it, the various tracks really capture the feeling of the eighties. Wang Chung never made a movie soundtrack before, but you'd never know that from listening to this.

Besides the great retrospective documentary, the movie also includes an amazing commentary track from the director. I say amazing because he tells you this is not going to be a precise play-by-play for the film, and then gives you a great two hour lecture on how movies are made, and what went into this film. William Friedkin has such a great speaking voice you forgot he's the director, great to see the movie for itself and then to watch it with the commentary track.

Without trashing other people's work (Transporter 2 comes to mind), see this film and find out what great filmmaking is like. Not one bit of computer graphics in this one, every scene had to be filmed at the right moment. This is as real as the counterfeit world of LA gets.",1351036800,7,1839,4.54380664652568

I'd describe it as director William Friedkin's fourth-best film (after 'The Exorcist,' 'The French Connection' and 'Sorcerer')-- although I must qualify that by saying he's made exactly four great films in his once-charmed, five-decades-spanning career. Having recently acquired 'L.A.' on Blu-ray and compared it scene-by-scene with the 2003 DVD release, however, I think the sound and picture enhancements, while nice, constitute only a marginal improvement and, as another reviewer points out, this edition doesn't even include Friedkin's worthwhile commentary. A lukewarm recommendation for those who appreciate the movie and the format, but I wouldn't put it on my list of Blu essentials.

377871,5,6301758641,"A: ""Because you're chasing me"".

""To Live and Die in LA"" centers around the well worn concept of the fine line between cops and robbers and what motivates them to do what they do. A continual battle between the good guys and the bad guys, or two sets of adrenaline junkies who simply hate the monotomy of everyday life and are easily seduced by power?

Beyond that cliche, most everything else in LA was grounbreaking at the time, and the movie stands up incredibly well. With a great 80s soundtrack the film itself serves as a nice retro time capsule, and features William Petersen before everyone knew him from ""CSI"" and a young Willem Dafoe before ""Platoon"". The movie is worth seeing for their performances alone, but as you watch it you'll see that even though it was relatively unknown at the time that it must have been required viewing amongst the inside Hollywood set as it was a precursor for several later movies (including ""Training Day"" and most recently ""Drive""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Drive-UltraViolet-Digital-Copy-Blu-ray/dp/B0064NTZJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Drive (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy) [Blu-ray</a>] , which felt almost like a direct homage to LA in several ways).

You don't need to know too much about the plotline other than it is about a secret service agent (Petersen) avenging the death of his partner who is killed mere days before his retirement by one of the top counterfeiters in the country (Dafoe). To reveal too much more or the ending would be one of the worst spoilers a person could put into a review. Bottom line, the movie has a great soundtrack, two strong peformances by actors before they were famous, the *best* car chase scene of all time, and two great plot twists that no one sees coming.

For both police and criminals its hard to get out once you're in, and LA provides a nice balance of both style and substance as it drives that point home. Closest thing to 80's true noir to ever get made, the movie has memorable supporting roles by John Turturo (unwilling informant), Dean Stockwell (criminal lawyer), and John Pankow (Petersen's new partner).",1335225600,4,2155,5.0790960451977405

'To Live and Die In L.A.' was in a double feature when I first saw the film. I was absolutely on the edge of my seat the entire movie. This film should be recognized as the first feature length film that had no clear definition of good or evil. The lives of these seemingly unrelated people are woven together comprising of a series of funny, bizarre and uncalled-for incidents. The car scene chase was so realistic, and has never been duplicated. The casting for this project should rank as one of the best in discovery of all time. Each cast member went on to huge careers, marking once again the pure brilliance of William Friedken and his staff.

I felt that a sequel was coming, as the ending took such a completely unexpected turn. The soundtrack and musical scores were both as perfect as possible. It was the first 'Pulp Fiction'-type movie, and should be a priority purchase for those fans out there that love cops and robbers-type psychological thrillers. I have been searching for a film with the same shocking genre ever since, and nothing even compares to this absolute classic. The gritty and completely intense performances of William DeFoe, William Peterson and John Pankau should have been nominated and recognized by the Academy. I challenge anyone to find more believable performances for the time it was done. No doubt this film would receive a four star rating from me. The editing, cinematography, and camera work were also top-notch. The best thing about this shocking and compelling story is that is based on events detailed in the amazing novel by Gerald Petievich. What an imaginative and twisted story. Very film noir for those film students out there. This has been my favorite movie for a long, long time.

377875,5,6301758641,"<strong>To Live and Die in L.A.</strong> (William Friedkin, 1985)

Here's a secret about William Friedkin, at least a secret to most of the casual moviegoing public: while it seems Hollywood would have you believe that Friedkin left his best days behind him as the seventies died, he never stopped making good-to-great films, though like most directors, he had his ups and downs. It's odd (or, perhaps, not so much; more on this later) that it's been Friedkin's flops over the last thirty years that have gotten the biggest pushes from Hollywood. A lot more people remember <em>Jade</em> than remember <em>The Guardian</em>; a lot more remember <em>The Hunted</em> than remember <em>Bug</em>, one of the very best American films of the past ten years. And in all the hoopla, Friedkin's single finest moment remains almost completely ignored: <em>To Live and Die in L.A.</em>, a damned-close-to-perfect piece of neo-noir released in 1985. To give you an idea of how badly this movie has been treated over the years: it was theatrically released in 1985. It did respectably, pulling in $17 million. It then briefly appeared on the pay channels, which is where I initially saw it. Once it was gone from there, I started haunting the action section of the video store... where it kept not appearing. It finally scored a VHS release in 1990 which went out of print almost immediately. It stayed that way until a 2003 DVD release, the first time the film had been widely available since the mid-eighties.

Before I get into my conspiracy-theorist ramblings about Bill Friedkin vs. Hollywood, a quick plot summary: Richard Chance (William Petersen, who at this point should need no introduction) and Jim Hart (<em>Play It Again, Sam</em>'s Michael Green) are counterfeit squad detectives on the LAPD obsessed with bringing down Rick Masters (Willem Dafoe), LA's biggest counterfeiter. During a lone-wolf-style raid on Masters' print shop, Hart is killed; Chance is teamed up with a by-the-book rookie, Vukovich (<em>Monkey Shines</em>' John Pankow), who is less than thrilled with Chance's by-any-means-necessary tactics.

Yes, it's all very familiar, as it should be with <em>noir</em>. What makes it so great is all the behind-the-scenes work that Friedkin does so well. The research is impeccable (Friedkin had ex-cons on the payroll, and the bills Rick Masters is printing in the opening scene are so realistic that despite having some obvious flaws, someone of them actually got out onto the street and were used as money for a time before being discovered), the pacing pristine, the music (by eighties one-hit wonder Wang Chung) perfect, the acvting top-notch from front to back; this is only the first time Willem Dafoe got passed over for a Best Supporting Actor nom when he richly deserved it, but it may be the most egregious. Cinematographer Robby Muller (who has since become the go-to guy for Jim Jarmusch) does pitch-perfect work here. And I could keep going. There isn't a single technical flaw to be found anywhere in this film. As far as the craft of making a film, William Friedkin was at the pinnacle of his career when he made <em>To Live and Die in L.A.</em>. So why was it ignored?

I'm not sure we'll ever know what happened in 1977.

While it's commonly assumed that the death of Bill Friedkin's career came with 1980's <em>Cruising</em> (a similarly excellent film; I reviewed it back in the nineties, but no copy of that review seems to have survived on the Internet anywhere), Friedkin's first big box-office flip was three years previous. <em>Sorcerer</em> was a big, ambitious, overly-complex, close-to-plotless, confusing mess of a movie that isn't exactly a remake of the classic 1953 film <em>The Wages of Fear</em> (both are adapted from the same Georges Arnaud novel, but Clouzot's adaptation, if Friedkin used it, is uncredited). Upon release, it sank like the Titanic, pulling in $6 million in rentals on a $22 million budget, and to this day it's almost impossible to find. (One wonders why there hasn't been a cheap DVD release, which given the director and cast, would almost certainly make up the loss even all these years later.) Unlike Friedkin's bigger, louder, more successful films, <em>Sorceror</em> was nominated for only a single Oscar (Best Sound). It was a failure by any metric, save that any Friedkin film is probably better than 95% of what you're going to see by other directors that year. He followed it up in 1978 with <em>The Brink's Job</em>, an even more obscure crime-comedy Peter Falk vehicle; while you'll see the occasional VHS copy of <em>Sorceror</em> floating around, good luck trying to find a copy of <em>The Brink's Job</em>. And thus, <em>Cruising</em> was simply the final nail in that coffin.

No one gets blacklisted anymore, right? The McCarthy era is long gone. And yet it's hard to look at William Friedkin's post-1977 career, as studded as it is with gems, and not see the hand of some sort of guiding force. As I intimated before, it seemed like after that, every one of Friedkin's great films was buried, given almost no publicity, playing in theaters for short runs before disappearing altogether (there were no plans at all to release <em>Bug</em> on DVD domestically; it was only two years of fan pressure on the studio that brought about a domestic DVD release), while the mediocre-to-awful got huge publicity, big releases, and the inevitable downfall. Was there really anyone in Hollywood who believed that <em>Jade</em> was a better film than <em>Rampage</em>? That <em>Rules of Engagement</em> was better than <em>Bug</em>? I can't imagine there was, but if you look at the pushes film A in each of those comparisons got in America compared to film B, it looks like <em>everyone</em> in Hollywood believed it. Which should tell you that either someone in Hollywood really doesn't like Bill Friedkin, or everyone in Hollywood is an idiot. I'll leave you to decide which is more accurate, and tell you that, as is the case here, the less you've heard about a Bill Friedkin movie made since 1977, the better it is likely to be. **** ",1325116800,2,6110,5.025666337611057

10/11: William Friedkin sure knows how to make movies. Although I never liked The French Connection, To Live and Die in L.A. is the better version of it. It's that good, and it's almost like a Michael Mann picture. It is easy to see how the elements of Manhunter, which was released a year later, were improved on. There are so many strong forces that made To Live and Die in L.A. a compelling film to watch, but William Peterson's performance is the biggest of them all. He is that good in it, even for a first timer in a leading performance debut. Of course, Michael Mann saw so much talent in him that he immediately had to use him in Manhunter which is one of the greatest movies made. Then, there is the young Willem Dafoe in a brilliant and chilling performance as Eric Masters. After his performance, he would go on to star the next film called Platoon and receive a deserving Oscar nomination for his work. The way William Friedkin shot the film is the reason why time went so fast. It's just brilliantly done, and the car chase in the middle of the film, very similar to The French Connection, is arguably one of the best scenes I've ever seen. The strong performances by everybody else in the cast keep the film rolling very well, and I've never seen anything like it before although there are similarities to several other films. The ending is quite surprising and unpredictable, I've got to say. I feel bad. All in all, To Live and Die in L.A. is a hardhitting masterpiece and is among Friedkin's best films.",1318636800,,1544,4.475177304964539

Seeing how two Secret Service agents would go through many obstacles in order to hunt down a notorious counterfeiter is an almost phenomenal experience. I especially admire the famous car chase sequence, which simply rivals a majority of car chases in today's movies. There are also outstanding performances throughout the movie: credit should go to Peterson, Pankow, Dafoe, and Fluegel for their award-worthy material. The cinematography is brilliant: the dark night sky and the decaying urban buildings and even the neon lights surrounding the City of Angels sure gives a grim, but beautiful, look to the film. Wang Chung's song ""To Live and Die in L.A."" is a marvel, though their other songs aren't as pleasing to the ear as I would have expected before. William Friedkin may not be one of my favorite directors, but he has sure created an underrated classic. I do think that this movie will soon become one of my all-time favorite films.

It has a fantastic car chase scene, a chase through LAX, and great views of parts of L.A. that one usually doesn't see. It reveals the characters as very human and believable, presenting both the dark side as well as the hero image without the normal bad-guy, good-guy stereotype roles, thus making it more real.

In both cases, the bad guy (Willem DaFoe in this movie, Lee Van Cleef in the other) is more true to himself and his principles than the supposedly good guys are. In a weird way, I respected the bad guys more for that.

The other thing I loved about this movie was the opening scene where Willem DaFoe is making a bunch of counterfeit money. (But I always like seeing how things are made.  When I was a kid, I used to watch the 15-minute ""Industry on parade"" show every Sunday morning.) It's almost a step-by-step tutorial.  Of course, you'd have to have the printing plate, so it's not like it's going to encourage anybody to start counterfeiting.  And anyway, today I think the counterfeiters probably do it by computer.

In any case, a good movie.

377905,3,6301758641,"Pros of this movie IMO would be the decent action scene, the car chase was the best, good scene loved it. The acting and general scene shots were at expected levels. However, what got me a bit hesitant about letting this movie do its complete run is the fact that the characters all remain indifferently and uninteresting.

!!!POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILER WARNING!!!

One of the biggest flaw that I saw in this movie is that there was not one single character that had me rooting for them. Usually when you watch a bad vs good guy movie such as a police/FBI/Secret agent movie is that you're usually rooting for one or the other and rarely ever the middle. No real person SHOULD remain neutral throughout a movie, at least a good one. You're usually persuaded based on your own personality to eventually and ultimately pick a side. It gives you something to cheer for, like a sports team, what's the use in rooting for both teams? Most people would like to take side with their favorable character or group of characters, partially if not completely and faithfully. It gives them anticipation in hopes that their pick will somehow meet a happy or satisfying ending.

In this movie, you can't really side with anyone because there is no ""good guy"". Good guy in this situation is put in quotation marks because it does not really represent good, but rather the favorable guy in relation to the eye of the beholder. In the end, you'll find it very hard to root for anyone because no one in particular will stand out or hold favor in your heart because everyone is messed up and the plot and storyline does not assist you in in choosing one. Everyone's character and personality feels a bit indifferent. No one is exceptionally charming, cool, funny, or whatnot.

I really dislike the main semi-heroine because of his negative attributes and therefore seek favor towards the bad guy, who in turn after examining throughout the movie, is not much of a better pick. So it left me feeling very passive about the characters.

So in conclusion:

The major con that made me feel a bit unsatisfied with this movie is that I had no one to root for and all the characters feel boring and lame. Felt like they all came from the same bucket, it was extremely hard to find someone to cheer for. No use watching a sports team that you could care less who wins, same thing applies to this movie.",1279929600,,2371,4.580188679245283

377932,3,6301758641,"I first saw 'To Live and Die in L.A.' twenty-odd years ago, and though I thought it was impressive, I promptly forgot about it.  Reading some positive references to it recently, I wondered if I'd neglected a true classic, and made a special effort to get a copy.  Like most genres, gritty cop films range in quality, but I'm always open to those that appear to transcend the conventions and clichs.  I consider Abel Ferrara's original 'Bad Lieutenant' to be one of the best examples - though it has its flaws - due to its powerful presentation and the dominant personality of Harvey Keitel.  With director William Friedkin's 'To Live and Die in L.A.', I was hoping to find another challenging film, one that I'd overlooked for a long time.

A very young William Petersen plays Secret Service Agent Richard Chance, whose older partner is brutally gunned down while trailing after the counterfeiter Rick Masters.  Willem Defoe, as the decadent, creepy Masters, plays cat and mouse with Chance and his partner's replacement, Agent Vukovich (John Pankow), as they tighten the net around him.  Suspicious of the two undercover agents when they attempt to set up a deal to buy the counterfeit bills, Masters knowingly asks for more front money than the Secret Service will risk in a sting operation.  This is where the unstable and revenge-bent Chance, who has been disintegrating throughout the movie, goes completely off the reservation.  After hearing of an unrelated drug deal going down in the near future, he hatches a plan to kidnap that deal's mule and steal the 50,000 he's carrying, giving the agents enough money to entrap Masters.

It seems to me that with this film, director Friedkin succeeded in upping the ante for ambiguous stories about the porous borders between cop and criminal, and this is probably why I thought of it as unique when I saw it the first time around.  But it's as if Friedkin expected his amoral exploration alone would carry the film.  All these years later, I find the set up of the principle characters hackneyed and the dialog often verging on cornball, and the first twenty minutes feel like lazy filmmaking shorthand for character development.  Friedkin is able to recoup some credit as the film moves along, but I was never able to consistently suspend disbelief - mostly because of William Petersen's portrayal of Agent Chance.  I'm not sure he was ready to carry the lead role - what I've seen of his recent television work suggests that he's better suited at playing an older, meticulous personality than a young loose cannon.  Willem Dafoe as Masters, and John Pankow as Chance's new partner do well with the material they're given - although Pankow seems miscast to me - but when Petersen is onscreen, I can never quite lose the feeling that I'm watching a bunch of actors.  But the film turns on his performance - depending on how you react to it will probably determine what you think of the film.

There are two other points in this film that people often point to as highlights - the soundtrack and the car chase.  I agree that the car chase was well done - probably not the best ever, but well done - but as far as the Wang Chung soundtrack goes, all I can say is I didn't like it much twenty years ago, and it hasn't improved over time.

377964,5,6301758641,"Hang on to your hats, folks, this movie is genre revisionism with a vengeance. William Friedkin's 1985 take on the Rogue Cop movie, made at the genre's high tide (between ""48 Hours"" and ""Lethal Weapon,"" while Stallone and Shwarzenegger were churning out programmers like ""Raw Deal"" and ""Cobra"" and ""Miami Vice"" was the hottest thing on the tube), takes the hoary cliche of the vigilante cop who will stop at absolutley nothing to take down the crook who killed his partner (days before retirement, of course) and pulls the audience into very dark territory indeed. So dark the audience didn't follow, and the movie was a box office and critical fiasco. Which, as is so often the case, means To Live and Die is a masterpiece. Over and over again, the movies have encouraged us to cheer when a cop throws out the rule book and gets down and dirty to bring down the bad guy; Friedkin meticulously, rigorously designed this film to make the cheer die in our throat and turn into a cry of despair.

William Peterson plays Chance, a US treasury agent, whose partner has been gunned down by a counterfeitor he was tailing named Masters (Willem Dafoe). Peterson begins by attempting to smoke Masters out by surveillance, then by busting his associates and attempting to turn them, but when all that fails, he goes undercover as a buyer of funny money --and finds himself crossing over the line between law and crime.

I don't want to spoil much here, as this film is dependant on numerous narrative turns where the rug is completely pulled out from under the audience. Note first the casting -- Peterson, now of CSI fame, but then a svelte, atheltic graduate of Chicago's Steppenwolf Theater Company, and Dafoe, then a recent grad of the avant-garde NYC theater troop The Wooster Group, were then complete unknowns. As a result, we don't know until the end who, if anyone, is going to get out of this bloodbath alive, because stardom provides no clues. Moreover, Friedkin points out in the excellent commentary, since this is a film about counterfeiting, nothing is what it seems. The tough macho cop becomes so obsessed with his mission he becomes an extorionist, a pimp, an armed robber, a thug, a bully and much,much worse; the diabolical, quick to violence criminal mastermind is an artist, a devoted lover, and lives up to his own peculiar moral code. Throughout the film, Friedkin uses the unfamiliarity of his stars to play with our identification until we realize too late, we're trapped in a wilderness of mirrors, completely unable to get our moral bearings. Then Friedkin closes in for the kill, because if you don't agree the last half hour of this film is one of the most shocking finales in mainstream Hollywood history, I'll stop posting reviews!

Other plusses -- a phenomenal supporting cast: Dean Stockwell as Dafoe's lawyer, an oily fixer who knows no matter who goes down, he'll always come out on top; John Turturro, in his first significant role, channeling Timothy Carey as Dafoe's ferocious bagman; Darlene Fluegel as the T-Man's sex-slave/informer/mistress, kept in his thrall with the threat of bail-revocation; John Pankow (later Ira on ""Mad About You"") as Peterson's green partner, continually prodded against his conscience into breaking the rules by the older law-man's undermining of his masulinity.
Also: the landscape of Los Angeles, a star in itself in this film -- I am convinced the look of ""To Live And Die"" was a significant goad to Michael Mann when he shot ""Heat"" -- both films use location masterfully, the sprawl, landscape diversity, and alienating qualities of the city make it a virtual third antagonist in the film (shot by Wender's DP Robbie Muller, in glowing oranges and tropic greens). ""Heat"" also borrows To Live and Die's cat-and-mouse sructure, the narrative juxtaposing both the cop and crook's moves-and-counermoves while paralleling their love lives, obsessions, and devotion to their jobs.

And action? There's a car chase the wrong way down the 10 Freeway at rush hour that has got to be among the best ever filmed -- as a plus, the chase is absolutely integral to the narrative, not an add-on effect, as even the best so often are. The film's violence is ugly and unrelenting --for example, when people are shot, it's full on in the face, and faces come off. Fist-fights are messy, exhausting, protracted affairs. In the car chase, the drivers are screaming in legitimate terror.

Michael Mann again -- I mentioned Miami Vice ruled the roost when Friedkin shot this film; he deliberately cribbed that show's ""MTV/Cops"" frenetic editing, pumped up '80's soundtrack (Wang Chung, who actually do a good job!!!) and shiny color scheme, to the point where Mann publicly considered a lawsuit. But the effect here is subversive -- like LA itself, Friedkin creates a glizty sun-blasted alluring surface, just to show us the festering sores underneath.

Friedkin gave us the paradigmatic gritty police procedural in 1971 with The French Connection, and the most elaborate Hollywood horror excursion ever with The Exorcist in 1973; In To Live and Die, he gives us both, and I leave it to you the reader to decide which genre, cop film or horror movie, the film's last image leaves us with.
One of the best of the '80's, IMHO; think of To Live And Die as a metaphorical prophesy for Camp X-Ray: you'll never want your lawmen breaking the rules again, no matter how honorable their intentions at the outset, after you see it...",1220054400,6,5466,4.884698275862069

For 'The Exorcist he focused completely on the story, character motivations, and themes of wide range and scope.

377992,3,6301758641,"William Friedkin's To Live and Die in LA is a fairly deeply flawed film, contrary to the recent reviews of this film.  Yet those flaws don't necessarily make it unwatchable or unenjoyable.  These flaws just keep this movie from being what it could have been which is a gritty neo-noir thriller.  Instead it's a stiff, occasionally clownish movie with great ideas.

I won't re-hash the plot as that's been done in other reviews with significantly more detail than I would be up for.  But the film gets off to a bad start when William Peterson's partner is up for retirement and after fighting a terrorist he actually says ""I'm getting too old for this S-.""  Ebert's Little Movie Glossary isn't working right now, so I can't find the exact name for this cliche, but you know there is one.

Shortly after this, William Peterson--who I'll just call Grissom--begins turning in one of his worst acting performances.  You, dear reader, try saying this line out loud:  ""I'm gonna get Masters 'cuz he killed my partner, amigo.""  There, you just said it the same way that Grissom did.

But I can't blame Grissom or any of the other fine actors in this film, and To Live and Die is filled to the brim with fine actors.  Dean Stockwell and John Turturro both feature prominently and give similarly flat performances--a true rarity, especially for Turturro.  Willem Dafoe plays his usual disinterested self, but here he seems disinterested in the dialog. We also know that Grissom was a fine actor around this time because of his excellent performance in Manhunter.

This also stars the shockingly big-headed John Pankow as Vukovitch, Grissom's new not-yet-ready-to-retire partner.  You may remember John Pankow as the irritating nebbish friend on the irritating nebbish show Mad About You.  Same nervous character here but with hammy dialog.  Wow.

There are a few other scenes that are so unartfully done as to distract from the plot.  A great example is when Grissom pulls a Captain Morgan/William Riker pose while interviewing stool pigeon Turturro.  Or perhaps the John Conaway in Grease move of leaping over a couch to sit with his girl.  If I didn't know that Peterson is a great actor I would really have to wonder what his beef is with David ""Horatio Cane"" Caruso's constant silly posturing.  Peterson's just one swipe of the Ray-Bans away.

So what happened?  I blame Novel Dialogitis.  All the text sounds directly lifted from a book, amigo.  As a result, all the actors have the same cliche-ridden tough guy pastiche voice, baby.  One scene encapsulates this:

Grissom is pulling a sting on Masters, the counterfeiter baddie.  Grissom brings Masters 30 grand in a money belt.  After Masters receives it, he says, ""Love your work"" and laughs maniacally.  The others with him join in.  Now, in print you can use your imagination to come up with something that seems malevolent.  But in a movie this is just weird.  Really weird.  I had to ask what was so funny?  Did I miss something?

Contrasting this is a genuinely interesting story about counterfeiters, cops who are willing to break the law to bring a criminal down, severe judgment lapses, backstabbing, and integrity.  Others have written about this as well, so I think it can safely be skipped.  But I do want to add that the plot is very lean.  Even when it seems that something is extraneous, you learn that it is integral to the very tight storyline.

Wang Chung's soundtrack is a highlight of this film.  It occasionally relies too much on contemporary technology which sounds quite dated (care for an Emulator II violin sample?  Care for it again?  And again?).  But there are times where the soundtrack is so good that I wonder why they weren't tapped for more film work.

Finally, I should mention the car chase.  It is indeed great, and like all the best car chases, it propels the storyline.  Mysteries develop as the chase expertly unfolds.  The reveal on these mysteries admittedly prompted a trombone waah-waah in my head, but that didn't take away from the intensity of the chase sequence.  Grissom and the human Macy's Day Balloon Pankow both give their best performances in this scene.  Probably because they don't talk much.",1196380800,3,4195,4.829817158931083

The story of a Secret Service agent played by Petersen who is determined to stop at nothing in order to take down his adopted nemesis; a counterfeiter who poses during the day as an artist. The complexity of their differences is astounding. Petersen's character, Chance, is the type of guy who lives by the seat of his pants.  He's always taking risk after risk with his own life. He's hotheaded and tempermental.  With a personality like this, it's amazing he's a Secret Service agent whom we first see guarding the President!

Meanwhile, Dafoe's character: Masters is the polar opposite.  He's disturbed, like Chance, but he takes his craft, his art, his talent and puts it where far too many people don't: he makes money for himself...litterally.  He not only forges legal tender, but sells what he makes.

William Friedken is a genius when it comes to crime drama.  More precisely, based upon films like this, The French Connection, and The Exorcist, he's a master of the thriller genre.  The heroes in his films are flawed to say the least, but determined.

The action in To Live and Die in L.A. is a pure adreneline rush.  It's nice to see Petersen running and dodging danger with gusto not seen in his more subtle, laid back approach to his CSI role.  The infamous car chase is one of the best filmed to date.  Just when the audience thinks it may be close to completion, another obsticle stands in the heroes way, then another, and another!

Then there's the ending, shocking to say the least.  I believed I heard everything there was to know about the film, but then the last fifteen or so minutes blew me away.  Original, and fantastic.

But of course, if one should decide to give someone else a tour of pure 80's style action films, this should not be the first.  The music, albeit considered classic now, shows its age.  The style, far from lackluster, is obviously low budget.  The budget doesn't hurt the story, script, directing, or flow, mind you, it is just something which could go unappreciated by first time watchers.

Anyway, the movie is well worth whatever price you decide to pay.  For Friedken Fans, for Willam Petersen fans, for Willem Dafoe fans.

The characters are rich to say the least.  This is the type of action movie and cat-and-mouse game a lot of films long to be.",1174608000,3,4355,6.842391304347826

The film is as terse and taught as it's actors, giving the viewer especial insight into the L.A. art scene, particularly the performance art of the times.

It's really good to see William Peterson's early work, since we are so accustomed to seeing his eccentric introvert on CSI.  Here he's a hotshot, fledgling Secret Service agent on the trail of a counterfeitor, Willem Dafoe. Dafoe is memorable as artist Rick Masters who is so high on his own ego that he has no boundaries---so it is interesting when he runs in to Peterson who lacks boundaries as well.  It's all very no-holds-barred.

Friedkin has a real feel for the ambience of the town as I remember it, and it's no slouch as a thriller either, but don't expect hearts and flowers or a cozy mystery.  It's harsh and sometimes hard to watch, but worth the effort.",1167868800,2,951,4.468208092485549

378020,5,6301758641,"When people look back at great films, things that tend to stick with people, such as a great story/script that makes one think, and even debate pre conceived notions in their heads, cinematography that is breathtaking, a film that is arragned to have both dialouge and action, not to mention a soundtrack that helps move a move along, make the film into a classic if done correctly. To live and die in LA delivers on all accounts.

  This film is as intense as you can get, but doesnt overwhelm. The story has no sympathetic characters, and shows the self destruction of its lead character Richard Chance(William Peterson) close up, as he becomes little different than the criminal Rick Masters(William DaFoe), and it shows the almost unwilling, and also coming undone of Chances new Partner, John Vukovich(John Pankow), be caught up in the downward spiral that Chance' life has become. Another highlight is supporting actor, Dean Stockwells role as a slick LA lawyer, working for Masters, but also giving advice to the by then way over his head Vukovich.

  Not to give away any spoilers, the movie breaks up many cliches one usually sees in cop films, with failures to execute plans in a competent manner from both the law enforcement and criminal ends.

  Also, director  Willam Friedkin, whose carrer in terms of quality had been on a downward path for some time, went back to the top in terms of quality(though his return would sadly be short lived with a series of bland films afterwards). The pacing of the story was perfect, and the cinematography was nothing short of artistic. As other reviewers have mentioned, the film showed the gritty side of LA, with the smog drenched orange sun shineing down on an industrial wasteland. Also the soundtrack must be mentioned. While Wang Chung later became the butt of many jokes, they shined on this soundtrack, with the must obviously from the 80s, but still with a timeless quality as well that moves the story along.

  Lastly, it is obvious that Friedkin on this film was heavily influenced by fellow director(and creator of Miami Vice) Michael Mann, in fact, Michael Mann sued, albiet unsucessfully,  Friedkin because the story and direction was so similar to that of Manns on Miami Vice, but again, it only elevates this film.

I was in my mid twenties when this movie came out.  And I remember seeing it.  And I remember the brash exhuberance of the 80's very well.  I'm really not so shallow as to have actually thought this of the film, but I do remember thinking that it was not going to sit well with the current crowd.  ""Don't drag me down, man, I'm  tryin' ta get my groove on here... and you're a real downer, dude...""

The 80's are about Madonna... Tears for Fears... the Brat Pack... Ferris Bueller... Pretty in Pink... der Commissar and David Bowie.  And then there THIS thing...  This gritty, dirty, depressing, violent, bummer of an experience.

Nobody wins.  Everyone loses.  Everything.  And like in real life, they lose it all SUDDENLY too.  Blam!  ""Wait... That's it?  it's over?  What the hell...""

I actually felt in L.A. like I felt watching the movie.  This one and ""Less Than Zero"" were two of a kind that I feel really captured the mood very well.

That in itself should be some kind of recommendation, especially since I haven't come close to watching any other movie as much.  Why did I find it so appealing?  It wasn't really the story, the script, the acting, or a lot of other things.  Mainly, I think it was the way it looked and sounded, the way it was filmed with images that could have been still photos, but not pretty postcard-like pictures, but shots of gasoline storage tanks, shipyards, junkyards, railroad tracks, warehouses, a couple of horses and a gypsy wagon, the beauty of the industrial wasteland, the orange sun through the smog and palm trees, the title credits in brilliant electric green and red, accompanied by Wang Chung's ""City of Angels"" which reminds me of Peter Gunn on meth.  The soundtrack for this move is perfect and a major contribution to its overall impact.  And it's not that there isn't a basically interesting story line.  William Peterson-- trying to be a little too cool at times in his tight jeans and cowboy boots-- nevertheless is pretty cool and in his thirty-something prime here as he plays a rogue Secret Service agent operating outside the law to do whatever it takes to capture a counterfeiter, played by Willem Dafoe who also is in his early prime, who killed Peterson's partner in cold blood.  There are several great chase scenes, both in cars and on foot, both as pursuer and being pursued, and just like The French Connection, there is a scene where a car is chasing a train.  Friedkin must have a thing for trains.  There is much that could have been better about the script, however.  The black and female characters are portrayed unflatteringly.  The fight scenes are stupidly unrealistic.  I didn't like the end at all.  Having the hero Peterson shot and killed while trying to arrest Dafoe was a boldly honest touch, but then having Dafoe killed was a cop out.  He should have escaped, since he was a skilled artist and counterfeiter who could have easily forged ID and simply made his own money.  Nevertheless, the poetic visual language of the movie is the overriding factor.  The locations of various semi-cheap bars and restaurants and the way even a sleazy place like Shipwreck Joey's Cabaret topless bar was shot in the early morning sunlight and fresh blue sky made it look good.  It also helped to have several beautiful women, great performances from Dean Stockwell and John Turturro, etc., etc.  I loved it.",1133049600,8,2571,4.7242152466367715

I think we have all been in situations in which we wanted to impress and emulate someone we perceived as being somehow superior, and when Agent Vukovitch (Pankow) becomes paired with (the appropriately named) Agent Chance (Petersen) he finds himself in waaaay over his head. Chance is a wild man, while Vukovitch is straight laced and conscientious; similar to (but without the cartoonishess of) Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in the more recent Lethal Weapon series. No matter what dangers befall Gibson & Glover, you KNOW that somehow they will survive....not so with Chance & Vukovitch, whose expression  reflects, with increasing horror, the rapid descent into hell brought about by his loyalty to a lunatic partner. The dangers they face are all too real, and Vukovitch acts like we would in this escalating situation...he becomes despondent, frantic, and tries to find a palatable way out of a nightmarish situation that only gets worse. Without revealing the surprise ending, lets just say that he finally does find a way to overcome a problem that he just can't beat, and in so doing provides a proper noirish ending to this gritty tale.

Additional observations: The sex is as raw and gritty as the rest of the movie, and graphically portrayed....and yes, that really is Daphne from ""Frasier"" as the lesbian temptress.

The DVD form of this movie contains valuable insights (provided retrospectively by the major stars and the director) into its production. Set up for the infamous car chase scene is fully explained, for those (like me) who always secretly suspected that they simply drove the wrong way on the freeway during rush hour, and filmed it. The directorial method that yielded such stark, unpolished realism (i.e. scenes like the lengthy and difficult opening of the silver briefcase) is well described and rather amusing. They actually did print about a million dollars worth of fake money, which is a felony, and were almost prosecuted for it. All in all, the DVD version is definitely the way to go for picture quality and additional features.",1121385600,9,2371,5.074358974358974
378026,5,6301758641,"When I saw ""To Live and Die in L.A."" in the 1980s, I was struck by its worldliness, its style, its sexual energy, and its shocker of an ending. It was immediately one of my favorite films of the decade. I recently watched the film again to see if it withstood the test of time. And I was a little surprised to find that ""To Live and Die in L.A."" is still one of the most complex and cynical neo-noir films, 20 years after it was made. The film was based on the novel ""To Live and Die in L.A."" by former Secret Service agent Gerald Petievich and adapted for the screen by Petievich and director William Friedkin, the creative force behind the previous decade's ""The Exorcist"" and ""The French Connection"". At the risk of being blasphemous, I have always found ""To Live and Die in L.A."" more memorable than ""The French Connection"", which is why I was tempted to see it again.

When his partner is killed while tracking down a notorious counterfeiter, hotshot Secret Service agent Richard Chance (William Petersen) vows to nail the killer at any cost. The counterfeiter is Rick Masters (Willem Dafoe), a promising abstract expressionist painter and cunning criminal. Together with his new straight-arrow but spineless partner John Vukovich (John Pankow), Chance tries surveillance, extortion, and subterfuge to incriminate Masters, but Masters is always one step ahead of him. Chance resorts to stealing funds for an undercover operation, and even the corrupt interplay of cops and criminals begins to unravel.

Director William Friedkin wanted a cast of virtual unknowns, and maybe that's why ""To Live and Die in L.A.""'s box office receipts didn't reflect its quality. More likely, the world of 1985 wasn't in the mood for a film in which everything is counterfeit: the money, the relationships, the cops, the criminals. Nothing is what it pretends to be. But Friedkin can hardly be faulted for choosing an excellent cast. This was William Petersen's first major film role, and I can't help but think that, together with 1986's ""Manhunter"", it would have made him a big star had it been made a few years later. Both films were ahead of their time. Not because they were better than other films being made in the mid-1980s -although it happens that they were- but that their themes were simply not timed to coincide with what audiences wanted at that moment. In any case, Petersen gets credit for generating the energy that keeps this story moving. John Pankow gets credit for being the human expression of a world falling apart, through whom we sense the chaos. William Friedkin gets credit for the fantastic counterfeiting sequence and the creative decisions in story, music, and cinematography -including the gutsy ending- that make ""To Live and Die in L.A."" exceptional. This is a must-see for fans of neo-noir.

The DVD (2004 Special Edition from MGM): There is a nice package of bonus features on the Special Edition disc, including a making-of documentary, an alternate ending, a deleted scene, a photo gallery, and an audio commentary. ""Counterfeit World"" (30 minutes) is a documentary about making the film that features modern interviews with director William Friedkin, the film's cast, and some principle crew, as well as a bit of on-set footage. Definitely worth seeing if you like the film. You can see the Alternate Ending (5 minutes) and Deleted Scene (4 minutes) with or without introductory featurettes. I recommend viewing the featurettes, so you'll understand what you're watching. The alternate ending was made at the request of the producers and is truly horrible. The ""Stills Gallery"" is a slideshow of stills and on-set photos. The audio commentary by director William Friedkin is worthwhile. It's not a scene-by-scene analysis, but comments on filming, story, casting, music, cinematography, and various interesting tidbits. Subtitles are available for the film in English, French, and Spanish. Dubbing is available in French and Spanish.",1114732800,63,3958,5.030487804878049
378027,5,6301758641,"If you're reading this, you've probably seen the movie--I'm not sensing a lot of people here who searched for this film.

So to the point: this movie will always remain in my mind for, first and foremost, its ending.  Never before in a film had I seen the story line go the way this one did (those of you who've seen it know what I'm talking about).  I was literally slack-jawed when all that went down... I just couldn't believe it.

Anyway, to the point, DVD owners: what's cool about owning it on DVD?  First and foremost, the movie holds up.  The Wang Chung soundtrack doesn't sound dated--it sounds like they created it in their own little timeless universe.  Nobody really sounded like them anyway, and they didn't sound like anybody.

The story is a blast and what a rush to see before-they-were-famous performances from Petersen, Dafoe and John Turturro.  They're all household names now, but at this point they were literally unknown.

The sound and the print are great; and the car chase is an all-time classic.  Somebody here dissed it in comparison to the Matrix Reloaded--which is bunk, because 70% of that chase (although it's awesome) was CGI.  This was actually done for real.

But what really makes the DVD awesome are the extras--the making-of short is a must-see, and it's a kick to see interviews with the original cast members, who obviously enjoyed being in this movie.  There's a present-day CSI William Petersen reflecting fondly on the shoot, along with Willem Dafoe.

But the biggest kick of all is the alternate ending shot for the film, when the studio balked at the original (and final) ending--OMG, how ridiculous.  The actors literally seem to be smirking through the scene, knowing how absurd it is.  Thank the Lord the director never took it seriously.

Friedkin's commentary is very entertaining, if sometimes rambling.  He doesn't necessarily dissect the movie scene-by-scene, but rather offers a general, overall philosophy of film making.  What's also interesting in retrospect is that apparently this film didn't do to well at the box office; to me it's an easy Top 10, but on the other hand it would be hard to market a film which is not easily explainable in 25 words or less.

To own or not to own on DVD?  The answer is: yes.",1106524800,16,2267,4.758974358974359
378028,4,6301758641,"""To Live and Die in L.A."" is one of those films I heard a lot about when it first came out, heard even more about in the intervening years, yet only recently got around to watching. Friends praised this film directed by William Friedkin as one of the coolest crime thrillers to ever hit the big screen. Friends whose opinion I greatly value when it comes to films said the same thing. Obviously, I thought, I've got to find some time to include this one in my to see list. After all, there is nothing like a great shoot 'em up film loaded with tons of car chases, violent killings, and do or die macho dialogue to help decrease high stress levels. Give me Charles Bronson sweeping through a gang of punks like he's the Angel of Death, Chuck Norris mowing down the baddies, or none other than Arnie Schwarzenegger dealing out doom to worthy recipients and I'm a happy camper. Let 'em use bullets, grenades, heavy artillery, hand to hand techniques, water, fire, missiles, swords, knives, ropes, whatever--anything that will do in the various enemies they encounter during the course of the film. You can probably tell I'm not that demanding when it comes to this genre.

Occasionally I am demanding, however, as in the case of ""To Live and Die in L.A."" It's the story of a Secret Service agent by the name of Richard Chance (William L. Petersen) who moves over to a new position in the Treasury department after he thwarts an assassination attempt on the president. His new job involves hunting down a most interesting criminal, a master counterfeiter by the name of Eric Masters (Willem Dafoe). This guy spends a lot of his time painting elaborate works of art and then burning them outside his house. He fills the rest of his hours running off thousands of sheets of money out in a warehouse in the desert. He's good, the best that there is, and the feds have been trying to shut his operation down for years. Chance's involvement becomes personal after his partner, a man very close to retirement, decides to launch a solo investigation of the warehouse only to meet his doom at the hands of Masters. Now Agent Chance will do anything in his power, both inside and outside the law, to bring the counterfeiter to justice. It won't be easy, however, since Masters is an absolutely ruthless thug who kills anyone--be it law enforcement officers, associates, or underlings--who gets in his way. Got a great idea for double-crossing Eric Masters? Forget about it; he will find out and pay a most painful visit to sort things out.

Chance soon gets another partner, the rather uptight John Vukovich (John Pankow), and the two start gunning for Masters with a vengeance. The agents shake up one of Masters's underlings, a guy named Carl Cody (John Turturro), in an attempt to make him turn snitch. They also set up a stakeout on a chap known to be one of Eric's best customers. In both instances, the feds botch the job. In order to get Carl Cody released from prison and into the custody of the Treasury Department, Chance had to convince a grouchy judge that signing a release order would help nab Masters. Unfortunately, Cody beats Chance to a bloody pulp and runs off at the first opportunity. The stakeout goes south when Masters manages to sneak past the prying eyes of Chance and Vukovich, kill the guy under surveillance, and escape without a scratch. These failures and the steadfast refusal of Treasury Department superiors to authorize a large cash payout to sting Masters leads Chance to take steps beyond the law. I won't spoil the ins and outs of how Agent Chance and the increasingly guilt ridden Vukovich procure the money, but the killings and resulting car chase form the most memorable aspects of ""To Live and Die in L.A."" So does the ending, which truly turns the action genre on its head.

I want to say I loved this movie. It does have great things going for it, including solid performances from Petersen, Pankow, Turturro, Dafoe, and Dean Stockwell as a sleazy attorney. It's also incredibly nuanced for an action film, with lots of twists and turns that you'll never see coming and characters that possess both good and bad traits. The action sequences grab the eye, especially the two scenes where characters take a shotgun blast to the face--surprisingly, the camera doesn't pull away when this occurs. What prohibits me from professing total adoration for ""To Live and Die in L.A.""? First, the car chase didn't impress me. I'm sure that it took forever to stage this sequence, and I have no doubt that it looked impressive back in 1985, but so many films made since have elevated chase scenes far beyond what we see here. Second, I could never get my mind around the Treasury Department's refusal to authorize more money for the sting that would reel in Masters. Here's a criminal responsible for the death of a federal agent, a guy churning out hundreds of thousands of sheets of top notch funny money, and the feds don't want to cough up a few bucks to catch him? Nope, I'm not buying it.

The DVD contains several extras, including a commentary with Friedkin, a making of feature, and deleted scenes and an alternate ending. Kudos to the director for sticking to his guns and insisting the studio keep the original ending intact. The alternate conclusion is so ridiculous that had the film initially used it, it's highly likely that ""To Live and Die in L.A."" would not have the following it has today. An enjoyable film, one that is highly evocative of the 1980s, ""To Live and Die in L.A."" is well worth watching. It's just not the masterpiece many make it out to be.",1106352000,4,5593,4.669371196754564
378029,4,6301758641,"This movie was co-scripted by Gerald Petievich -who  wrote the original novel on which it is based ,and this is a great plus point in the movie's favour as it helps in preventing a dilution of the message in the book ,namely the essential corruptability of every man

It is a tough and gritty movie about two US Treasury agents ,Chance and Vukovich ,played by William L Peterson and John Pankow ,to get the goods on a slick and depraved violence ridden counterfeiter ( Willem Dafoe) who killed Chance's partner .

Chance is wholly dedicated to his job and has no life or relationships outside the strictly professional ones dictated by his work -which is also his mission in life .Everything and everyone is a means to an end -the destruction of his enemy , Masters

The well made  violence riddled movie is the story of his pursuit .To the accompaniment of a pounding score ,and punctuated by car chases and shootouts he sets about achieving his goal

This a movie with style and great performances but without a real hero or a moral centre .It is a grimly cynical picture in which all the characters are driven beings and this is problem in one way because there is no one to really root for or identify with .

Provided you don't object to this then sit back and enjoy a visceral movie with a  uniquely dark vision which compensates for its lack of real narrative suprise or moral sensibility.

Despite the movie being very very eighties it's actually really great.  The fact that it has a nostalgic 80's quality to it makes it even cooler.  The cast is really the thing that makes this movie work.  In 1985 when this movie was released this film was seen as a small gritty independant film with a bunch of nobody stars.  Willem Dafoe(Spiderman)had yet to breakthrough with ""Platoon"" and had done virtually nothing before this film.  He talks about the risk the director took with his actors in the extra stuff on the dvd.  You probably will recognize William Peterson from ""Manhunter"" and the current ""CSI"" on television.  Then theres John Turturo(O Brother Where Art Thou) who was also virtually unknown who would go on to make numerous films.  When I first saw this movie years and years ago it was like watching real events unfold.  Mostly because the film is gritty and was even grittier made by the horrid version available on tape at the time.  It was also really grittily realistic because you didn't know any of the people that were in it, so it felt much more real.  But it still stands up as a good movie after all these years.  It also has an outstanding car chase, probably one of the most intense I've ever seen.  I mean the Matrix 2 car chase was cool but it was all that cgi crap.  Every inch of this carchase is real and it shows.  Maybe some of the directors of today can take a few notes from watching these old movies and realize that taking the time and effort to do real stunt work really does pay off.",1102464000,2,1650,4.428571428571429
378058,5,6301758641,"I strongly recommend this film for the ones looking for differents types of films. The story may seem conventional but that's probably why it hasn't drawn much attention in France but what makes this movie very worthwhile is the brooding atmosphere created by the hyperrealisttic settings, the dusky scenes and such a compelling soundtrack thanks to Wang Chung's cooperation. Another interesting aspect is that the main protagonists are torn apart between their eagerness to avenge their partner (esp. the main character W. Chance) and their fear to breach the legal rules cops are supposed to comply with (whereas Vukovich is often afraid of getting into trouble on account of their misdemeanors). Such a film has stood out sharply to me since the first time I saw it on TV and it has been contented so far by the critics sofar despite its apparent commercial failure. Director W Friedkin showed once again how talented he was in this particular field (remember ""French Connection""?).

What's not to like?  Great photography, an excellent cast, tightly directed, a haunting theme and visually seductive.

378061,5,6301758641,"William Friedkin's reputation has faded somewhat since the glory days of ""The French Connection."" This is a shame, because ""To Live and Die in L.A.,"" made some 15 years after ""The French Connection,"" is at least its equal. With its nudity, profanity and horrifying violence, it's not for the Holy Name Society (and unfortunately it also helped open the floodgates for films that use those things for shock value only). But the film paints an unforgettable portrait of the Los Angeles underworld, depicting cops and Feds who are as out of control as the criminals they hunt. Secret Service agent Richard Chance (William L. Petersen)  is reckless to the point of idiocy as he breaks every rule of law to chase down Eric Masters (Willem Dafoe), the consummately evil counterfeiter who murdered Chance's partner. John Vukovich (John Pankow), Chance's straight-arrow new partner, is extremely dubious about Chance's methods but feels he has no choice but to go along with him. The resulting action in this 1985 film is state-of-the-art even by the standards of twenty years later, including a car-chase scene that for my money is the most exciting ever put on film, bar none.
The film's relative lack of success is demonstrated not only in Friedkin's fading fortunes, but also in the histories of the lead actors. It took Petersen, Dafoe and John Turturro (who plays one of Dafoe's flunkies) years to become household names; John Pankow's greatest fame came from playing second banana to Paul Reiser in ""Mad About You;"" and Debra Feuer and Darlanne Fluegel, playing Dafoe and Petersen's super-sexy molls, essentially were never heard of again. But in ""To Live and Die in LA,"" their star quality comes across loud and clear. Robby Muller's cinematography is top-notch, as is the editing by Bud and John Smith. The songs by Wang Chung are wonderfully atmospheric and greatly enhance the film's seductive mood. The DVD contains a number of fascinating extras, including the ridiculous alternate ending the studio made Friedkin shoot (and which he wisely discarded as soon as he shot it).",1096761600,3,2079,5.0436046511627906
378062,3,6301758641,"From the Wang Chung soundtrack to the ""I'll do anything to avenge my dead partner"" plot mechanism to the inevitable Los Angeles River car chase, so much of this movie feels overworked, overwrought, dated, or just plain wrong... and yet, it's an oddly compelling picture. There's a nervous energy in the performances, and as the narrative goes forward, a growing ambiguity emerges in the motivations of the protagonists - and earns some real discomfort from the audience. Sprinkle in the great extra terrestrial actor Willem Defoe as a kinky counterfeiter, and you've got Friedkin's last interesting movie. That said, if you're expecting ""The Exorcist,"" or the vastly underrated ""Sorceror,"" I can't recommend it.

It announces the debut of William Petersen in the crime genre, as well as the supposed ""comeback"" of William Friedkin. But of course, this film fizzled at the box office back then, thus pulverizing Friedkin's return to Hollywood stardom.

What struck me about this film is the soundtrack, the atmosphere and the aura of it. This film looks and sounds as if it was from a time capsule from the 80's. Full of cliched cop and robber lines and characterisation. The Wang Chung soundtrack is truly a blast!

However, the film's piece de resistance is still the highway car chase scene. It's among the most taunt and tense car chase sequence ever filmed. How Friedkin did it at that time, was beyond comprehension.

This DVD edition is as good as it gets. While the picture transfer is not perfect and shows its age, the sound however was remixed and is excellent. So are the extras.

I think this is an extraordinary crime film, competent sufficiently to stand on it's own 2 legs with Friedkin's other great effort, ""The French Connection"" and also the interesting and now rarely seen except for late at night ""The Seven Ups.""
That it was also near introductory roles for Will Petersen and Willem Dafoe almost adds to the rawness of the plot, actors and the roles they play really living on the edge, taking chances. The solitary confinement of 'the job,' the apocryphal manly humor, the viciousness of the bad guys . . . and the good guys, reminds me of McQueen's role in ""Bullit,"" notwithstanding that Bullit's car chase (in that beautiful Mustang) is the only one that comes close to this car chase on the Long Beach Freeway.

378101,5,6301758641,"To Live and Die in LA is one of the finest crime dramas of all time, right up there with Michael Mann's Heat or Carl Franklin's One False Move.
It was also brutal in its depiction of graphic violence, which made it ahead of its time (as work coming from a major director). Thus, the critics perceived it as a slumming effort from Friedkin, barely above a drive-in splatter film. It was dismissed with a superior sniff. All the critics seemed able to comment on was the brutal, bleak nature of the film. Now, years later, the great film making that was present all along has gotten the chance to rise up through the blood.
In a nutshell, this is a revenge film. A secret agent is after the counterfeiter that killed is partner, and he'll do anything to get the guy. All the Friedkin hallmarks are here. The very leanness of the film is classic Friedkin, the way he closely follows the main thread of the story without ever veering off course. Nothing is wasted. Not a shot - not a line.  Also (much like Michael Mann) the viewer is immersed in a criminal world with great authority. Friedkin obviously did a great deal of research into the world of counterfeiting, and it shows in the dialogue and the cinematography.
The film is expertly written (and the hardness of the dialogue was also ahead of its time) with ex secret service agent, Gerald Petievich, adding much blunt realism to the script. The acting is great, and it is a treat to watch William L. Peterson as the agent out for blood. Peterson, with his stint on TV's CSI, is now seen as professorial. But this is 1985, and back then he was much leaner and meaner - the cock of the walk, in fact, all strut and attitude. His nemesis is Willem Dafoe who is also tremendous as the genius/savant counterfeiter. His evil is so complete, he is nearly spiritual in his purity. Dafoe has never been such an effective and threatening bad guy.  There are great character parts in this film as well, with the ever-psychotic John Turturro turning in a prototype eyes-like-coal-pits performance.  I think my favorite bit part in the film comes from Dean Stockwell as Willem Dafoe's lawyer.  Stockwell is the very essence of cool control in this role.
The cinematography is by Robby Muller, and it is beautiful - extremely rich in texture and all vibrant color. The long, wordless scene where the camera watches the process of Willem Dafoe actually counterfeiting money is simply gorgeous and mesmerizing - one of my favorite sequences of any film.
Finally, this film boast one of the most thrilling car chase scenes ever. I am a bit of a car-chase-scene buff, and this is one of my favorites. Suffice to say, this is one of the few car chase scenes that I actually felt myself flinching in reaction to the brilliantly filmed action onscreen.
This film is a winner and built to last. I highly recommend it.  -Mykal Banta",1078704000,7,2865,4.587890625

That the movie is set is LA is perfect. Total and modern decadence and being teasury agents that chase ""funny"" money fuels the fire. And fire is a major theme as well. The bonus of seeing three excellent character actors hone their craft, unrescrictedly, is a tribute to Friedkin as a director. Pacing is well done, and the action only breaks long enough to catch one's breath before the next jolt of excitement. The secondary characters are well acted as well. None of the actors overshadow the characters that weave the story to a splendidly, twisted ending, especially for a hollywood movie.

378129,5,6301758641,"William Friedkin (The French Connection, The Hunted) directed this gritty, gut churner that fully displays that there is a very thin line between enforcing the law and breaking it.  William Petersen (Manhunter, TV's CSI) stars as a hot shot special agent who, after his partner is killed, will go to any length and any means necessary to catch the killer who is a career counterfeiter played by Willem Dafoe in psycho mode.  Soon, Petersen is teamed with an idealistic and green behind the ears agent (John Pankow) who reluctantly helps his new partner bend the law farther and farther in his quest for revenge.  The acting is superb.  Petersen, Dafoe, and Pankow are sights to behold, with Petersen and Dafoe coming close to brilliant.  Friedkin's direction is also the best of his career since the classic French Connection, showcasing one of the most memorable and exciting car chases to ever be caught on film; a car chase that film makers would mimic for years to come in films such as Ronin and recently in The Matrix Reloaded.  MGM finally had the good sense to release To Live and Die in L.A. on a generous Special Edition DVD which includes a commentary by Friedkin and an alternate ending which Friedkin wisely chose not to go with.",1075507200,6,1242,4.753488372093023
378130,4,6301758641,"For anyone who has not already seen this absolutely terrific action film, it is one of the best depictions of the street struggles of the Secret Service against counterfeiters yet filmed. The movie was also a brand new showcase for the emerging abilities of a very young William Petersen, now better known as the star of the hit TV show, CSI. Here he plays an agent obsessed with catching a particularly clever and ruthless counterfeiter, played by another emerging screen presence, Willem Dafoe.  The counterfeiter has brutally murdered Petersen's partner, and once the agent catches the trail, a deadly cat and mouse chase ensues. All of this is done against the backdrop of Los Angeles, where the counterfeiter is living the life of a wanna-be struggling artist who finances his high life style with bogus bills.
Petersen catches the trail and enlists the help of his young new partner in pursuing Dafoe, and amidst the car chases, carnage, and pulse-raising suspense of various encounters, moves in for the final encounter. This is a gritty and realistic look at the ways in which both sides of the law bend circumstances to their advantage, and the action unfolds in a kind of no-man's land where law and civil order are mere trivialities neither side bothers much with, except as it furthers their personal, private agenda.  One of the most memorable sequences involves a breath-taking car chase through LA at rush hour, and is the first of many chases against traffic ever filmed. At the time, it was heady stuff indeed.
The movie is ably directed by William Friedkin, and also features a splendid supporting cast, including John Pankow, John Turturro, Dean Stockwell, Robert Downey, and Debra Feur. The cinematography is superb, and the action sequences quite stunning and very believable. The DVD has a number of interesting features, and the new DVD markedly improves the print quality from the original VHS version, which suffered from a bad production effort.

It's 80's postmodern film noir, and was way ahead of its time. Perhaps that's why the critics panned it. Be sure to look at the still photo gallery; there are some fabulous black and white portraits of the cast.

Willem Dafoe can do no wrong as an actor in my opinion, and plays his role marvelously, exuding calm, cold ruthlessness. The soundtrack is perfect and anybody who says it's ""dated"" is being silly. Of course it's dated! It's a movie very much of it's time and place ( Reagan's 1980's) and the soundtrack echos that, helping to drive the picture along.",1073347200,4,732,4.7265625
378133,5,6301758641,"To Live and Die in L.A. was a film ahead of its time. When it was released in 1985, it failed to connect with a mainstream audience that was put off by its amoral, unlikable characters and downbeat, nihilistic ending. What did people expect from the same man who brought them the equally uncompromising The French Connection in 1974? William Friedkin's film has long been out of print on VHS and so MGM's new special edition DVD is exactly what fans of this influential crime thriller have been waiting for.
Director William Friedkin provides an informative audio commentary that pulls no punches. He goes into detail about the world of counterfeiting and the Secret Service. For those who enjoyed his commentary on The French Connection DVD, this new track is a must-listen.
""Counterfeit World: `The Making of To Live and Die in L.A.'"" is a wonderful retrospective look at how the movie was made. There is some excellent archival, behind-the-scenes footage of Friedkin and his cast in action. Fans are in for a real treat as the fantastic airport foot chase between Petersen and Turturro is discussed, as is the famous car chase on the Los Angeles freeway. This featurette is crammed with tons of anecdotes and new interviews with Petersen, Pankow and Dafoe.
Also included is an alternate ending that the studio forced Friedkin to shoot because they didn't like his original downbeat ending.
There is also a deleted scene that fleshes out Pankow's character a bit more.
To Live and Die in L.A. was William Friedkin's last great film. He has failed to deliver anything on the level of his 1985 film. MGM has produced an excellent DVD with a stunning transfer (including a new 5.1 surround soundtrack) and a solid collection of extras that should please fans of this crime thriller masterpiece.",1073260800,11,1793,4.881967213114754

378135,4,6301758641,"Back in 1985, ""To Live And Die In L.A."" was an edgy, gritty police thriller much in the vein of ""The French Connection"". In fact, it could be said that ""L.A."" and ""Connection"" are quite similiar with both having main characters that are living on the edge and great car chase sequences. However, I believe ""Connection"" was the better story/screenplay.
The main difference with this film from other films of its kind is that something great happens to the main character. He's not perfect, he's not a great guy, he makes big mistakes like a real person might make. I have yet to see a law enforcement officer thriller that matches this character (played by ""Manhunter"" and ""CSI"" alumni William L. Peterson). This is what is sadly lacking in today's cop/secret service/FBI/CIA films.
The next difference, and this was good at the time but not so good now, was Wang Chung creating the soundtrack. I like Wang Chung, have all of their cds including this soundtrack. I think this soundtrack is full of great music and that it fits the film, but Friedkin overused them. Nearly every scene had some soundbite from the band and it began to grate. Well, then again, this was the era of ""Miami Vice"" and MTV. It was trendy then to overuse popular music in the film score. Despite this shortcoming, the music didn't spoil the film.
Lastly, Willem DaFoe and John Turturro made great bad guys who appeared fairly realistic and not superhuman like Nicholas Cage's character in ""Face/Off"". I agree with some of the other reviewers here that this may very well have been the last good Friedkin film. I think what he needs now is a good script--forget flimsy material like ""The Hunted""!!!!",1073088000,,1672,4.74914089347079

This is great escapist fare, but it's not mindless. This movie takes you on a wild ride that tickles your brain but never makes you think TOO hard. The movie centers around the struggle between U.S. Treasury Agent Richard Chance (William L. Petersen) and graphic artist-turned-counterfeiter Rick Masters (Willem Dafoe). Both are great characters played by great actors. Dafoe expertly portrays one of my favorite all-time screen criminals. This is a guy who is too smart to be a criminal, but uses his intelligence to be an even BETTER criminal. He's smart enough to discuss art history, but tough enough to deal with the street crooks who buy his paper. This was the first time I'd seen Willem Dafoe (in 1985), but it's easy to see why he got more movie parts after seeing his work here.
Towards the end of the movie there is a great car chase which is even better than the one in 'The French Connection', in my opinion.
Fans of William L. Petersen (CSI) should definitely check this movie out...he's really terrific. (Also check out the HBO movie he did in 1989 called 'Long Gone'--a very good 'Bull Durham' knock-off)",1072915200,,1532,4.720149253731344

TO LIVE AND DIE IN L.A. was a challenging thriller when it came out in 1985.  With a cast of relative newcomers, William Friedkin blurs the lines between good guys and bad guys to such an extent that anything is possible--even as to who gets to ""live and die"" in the end!  The car chase is outstanding in its stunts and dramatic execution (you realize something is up when guys with M-16s keep popping up EVERYWHERE).  Friedkin's vision of L.A. wipes the gloss off most 80's thrillers and the Wang Chung soundtrack gives an electric pulse throughout the film.
I loved Friedkin's commentaries for THE FRENCH CONNECTION and THE EXORCIST and he doesn't let up here.  The ""alternate ending"" is a good example of what happens to most Hollywood movies (corporate decisions wrecking story creativity) but TO LIVE AND DIE IN L.A. didn't share that fate.

This violent and odd film has gathered a huge cult status around the world for one particular reason...the twist at the end of the film is one of the most surprising and breathtaking scenes in american motion picture history. The acting is top notch and you couldn't expect any less from a master like William friedkin or actors William Petersen and Willen Dafoe. The cinematography, well, it has a little resemblance with Dante Spinnoti's earlier work in Michael Mann's ""Manhunter"", but not quite as effective as Spinnoti's masterwork. In fact, the whole film has a bit of Manhunter all around. The plot is terrific, the acting is thought-provoking, the violence and persecution scenes are magnificent just like in every Friedkin film and the twist at the end is worth the price of the DVD alone. My only two negative aspects to the film are the outdated and horrible synth soundtrack/score and the pathetic and laughable early 80's fashion, but besides that everything else is quite amazing. So do not think twice about bying this copper...if you love TRUE cop dramas, then To live and die in L.A. will definetly make your day.",1072569600,,1560,4.802973977695167
378150,5,6301758641,"I have always been a fan of this movie for its portrayal of the seedy side of LA, a place of which I am a fan.  Viewed now, this is very 1980s.  This DVD is probably best remembered as the starting point of the careers for William Peterson and William Defoe, two actor's actors.  Both have gone on to fame but neither of who has sold out for money or fame only.  And this is where the DVD is at it's best.  Friedkin gives freely of his style and history of the movie for an excellent narrative that would be enjoyed by all aspiring movie making students.  Of particular interest is the casting director used and how these actors were picked.  I was so fascinated by Friedkin's narrative that I used the option to watch the movie in its entirety with Friedkin's tell-all voiceover.  I then watched the alternate ending that I didn't like and am glad they stayed with the present version.  Then I later watched the movie which I hadn't seen in years.
Another advantage of watching an aged movie like this with the director narrative is the ability to research what has happened to actors you may have enjoyed but don't remember seeing anywhere else.  I always use IMDB.com to do this.  In this movie the two stars both have attractive girlfriends who played interesting roles.  It was interesting to hear one of them on the remake and notice how she had aged (gracefully) in 16 years and then view their film history (limited).  Also, I have always liked William Peterson for this role.  The description of his commitment to theater and how he got this role is a tribute to William Friedkin as well as the actor.
If you like studying movie history this is a must purchase.  If you have an interest in street life in LA or like 80s culture and it's influences, this is a great review.  I strongly recommend this DVD.",1071964800,3,1813,4.4650455927051675
378151,5,6301758641,"I just want to add my support to this oft-overlooked, but truly great crime thriller.  With 18 years of hindsight, it's interesting to note how prescient this movie was about the direction crime-thrillers would take us.  No longer was the cop to be a ""dressed-in-white, Joe Friday"" good guy with a perfect moral compass.  Now cops would fight for us, but on their own, less-than-perfect terms.  We saw some of this in Friedkin's superior FRENCH CONNECTION, of course, but LIVE AND DIE...was even closer to the edge.  And in many ways, I see this film as opening a door for films like NARC and TRAINING DAY, and shows like NYPD BLUE.
It's great fun to see William Peterson, much younger than his current CSI days, playing a cop who really plays by his rules.  And Willem Dafoe, in a fairly early role, really laid the groundwork for his future career as a creepy villain. But this character is more rooted in reality and really gritty, unlike his villain in SPIDERMAN, let's say.
All in all, this is a most unpleasant, but totally fascinating film.  There is a GREAT car chase, one that is both thrilling but again, rooted in some sense of reality.  I like a good car chase, such as in BAD BOYS II, but those kinds of chases mostly make me admire the admiration of their creators.  In LIVE AND DIE...we spend most the the chase kinda clutching our seats in anxiety.  It hearkens to great chases like BULLITT or yes, FRENCH CONNECTION.
The ending is a shocker.  It's become a cliche about this movie to say it, but the big twist was more than just a gimmick when it first came out...it was making a statement about the brutality of the world these cops lived in.
If you haven't seen this film and you enjoy cop movies or thrillers...do yourself a favor and watch it TODAY.  It is very nearly a classic.
(And yes, it is kinda fun to hear all the WANG CHUNG music.  The music of this now obscure band really roots this movie in a specific time and place.)",1071964800,3,1951,4.461971830985916
378152,4,6301758641,"To Live and Die in L.A. like Michael Mann's Manhunter had a huge impact on the look and feel of a lot of action films in the mid-80's. William Petersen stars as an FBI agent who tracking a counterfeiter (William DaFoe). Their game of cat and mouse and the relationships they destroy in their bid to achieve their goals is part of the larger tragedy of this classic action film. Petersen seemed briefly to be headed for major stardom after this and Manhunter appeared. It took a bit longer and he did eventually achieve the accolades he deserved with CSI. The strong cast also features a very young John Pankow (Mad About You)as Petersen's younger, by the book partner. There's a dark cyncism at the heart of L.A. that suggests that both Petersen and DaFoe are essentially tainted by their single minded obsession; Petersen 's obession is to catch Dafoe and Dafoe's to use his art to create riches for himself regardless of the body count.
The transfer is an improvement on the crappy looking video transfers we've seen over the years. There's still some analog artifacts and some minor compression glitches but, on the whole, the picture is very good. The sound, on the other hand, isn't quite as sharp. The soundtrack seemed a bit compressed and flat to me. Yes, it was an improvement over the earlier video versions but hardly what I would consider top notch considering that this is a special edition. Still on the whole the sound is pretty good.
Director William Friedkin (The French Connection, The Exorcist)always makes L.A. vivid and visually interesting. The photography by Robby Muller is alive with color and interesting visual angles and choices. The soundtrack by Wang Chung is probably one of their better contributions. To be frank, I was never a huge fan of the band but the title track captures the films mood perfectly.
The special edition features a number of deleted scenes and an alternate, absurd ending. It's clear that Friedkin made the right choices with his film. The studio shot alternate ending needs to be seen to be believed.",1071360000,,2054,4.805084745762712

There's a whole lot of acting, not just action, taking place in this movie and if you are unable to recognize depth of emotion you might want to stick to Roger Corman movies.
William Peterson puts in a brilliant yet subtle stint as a secret service agent bent on getting the criminal who killed his partner. Willem Dafoe plays a respectable yet sly master criminal who proves his mettle against the ""good guys"". This same story was rehashed eight years later in ""Boiling Point"", but personally To Live & Die.. is a lot more nail-biting.
Speaking of which, the car-chase scene on the LA freeway is spectacular. Comparisons have been made to more modern car-chase, action sequences such as the chase on the Paris freeway in ""Ronin"" but this chase scene is clearly the blue-print for many that followed it. This scene alone is worth the price of admission.

378154,4,6301758641,"To Live and Die in LA is an excellent movie, despite any minor flaws I may have noticed during my recent viewing.  It stars William L. Petersen (Manhunter) as federal agent Richard Chance.  He's an adrenaline junky, seemingly living for that next fix, unable or unwilling to establish any real connections with other humans other than that of his long time partner and mentor, a soon to be retiring agent.  Did I say 'soon to be retiring' agent?  Maybe I should have said soon to be dying, as, in Hollywood, they mean the same thing...major clich, but I got past that, as the film is really good.
Anyway, the old-timer agent gets kakked, in a particularly nasty fashion, during a solo investigation of a recent facility used by a particularly skilled counterfeiter Eric 'Rick' Masters, played by Willem Dafoe.  Seems Masters has been under investigation for a while, and this agent just happened to get a little too close.  (As the editorial review gives away this plot point, I didn't feel like I was spoiling anything giving it up, too...)
With the death of his friend and partner, the investigation becomes personal for Agent Chance, and the boundaries of the law and proper procedures become blurred in his quest to take Masters down.  This raises some serious conflicts with Chance's new partner, John Vulovich, played by John Pankow.
The pace is a little uneven, but that wasn't a negative issue for me.  Friedkin does a wonderful job in keeping the viewer drawn to the screen.  Sometimes I wondered how the investigators got from point A to point B, as there was some minor muddling in the plot, but this did little to reduce my enjoyment of the movie as a whole.
One of my favorite parts of the movie was the car chase scene where agents Chance and Vukovich procure monies needed to make a deal with Masters outside of normal practices, and are subsequently pursued by a number of mysterious individuals interested in stopping them.  The scene is extremely gripping and realistically portrayed, reminiscent of the chase scene from The French Connection (1971), also directed by Friedkin.
While this movie is not at the level of The French Connection, it certainly holds it's own.  It was really nice to see Friedkin return close to form with this movie.  Also, this movie is helped along with a strong, supporting cast including John Turturro, Dean Stockwell, and Debra Feuer.
The picture and sound quality are excellent, and there are enough special features to make this 'special edition' actually fit the label, including an alternate ending and deleted scene, commentary by the director, a making of documentary, a photo gallery, and various trailers for the movie.  After watching the movie, be sure to watch the alternate ending and see how the studio almost botched the movie by trying to tack on a completely goofy ending for fear that the original ending would not sit well with audiences.  It's truly hilarious and serves as an excellent example of what happens when studio executives try to get involved in the creative process.",1071014400,10,3047,4.857142857142857

This is a rare example of a film from the 1980s that still has an impact. The ambigious view of the bad and good guys, represents the tone of this movie throughout. To Live And Die In La is a very violent film, that still shocks.
In merry old England it was on television a few years ago and it totally blew me away. The following day I went to my local HMV and to my horror I found it was unavaliable for years. So in dire desperation a paid a small fortune to purchase a old VHS copy, from a UK deleted Video company.

378157,5,6301758641,"To Live and Die in LA is as good an example of crime drama as any you're likely to see.  Using a straightforward, high tempo approach in the plot, director William Friedkin delivers a realistic look at intense, down and dirty police work.  In making a comparison, this movie was in 1985 to what Training Day was in 2001.
Secret Service agent Richard Chance (William M. Perterson) and his partner John Vukovich (John Pankow) are on the trail of a ruthless counterfeiter Rick Masters (Willem Dafoe) who operates without a conscience and evolves into a stone cold killer when the wrong people cross his path.  To be able to make an arrest, the agents need front money to buy counterfeit money from Masters that the Treasury Department won't allocate.  Using an ill-advised tip from Chance's informant, the agents plan to steal their needed money from an unknown person completely unrelated to their case which completely unhinges their own operation.  The designated victim ends up being killed, the agents grab the money, and soon after they learn that they took down and undercover cop working for another agency.  As the movie progresses, Agent Chance is willing to do whatever it takes to destroy Masters while his partner struggles with inner demons and his conscience on how to proceed.  Living on the edge and taking risks around each and every corner, the agents methodically and ruthlessly pursure Rick Masters to the end building up to an excellent climax in the movie.
It was a long wait to get this beauty out on DVD but it was well worth it.  The acting is top notch, the plot is fast and exciting, and there are a few good extra features thrown in.  The most noteworthy of these is the featurette on the making of To Live and Die in LA that is very revealing and shows the surprising lengths that director William Friedkin went to while making this film.",1070582400,6,1865,4.713846153846154
378198,5,6301758641,"To Live and Die in L.A. is one of the most memorable of all movies from the 80's and one of the best cop films ever made!  Friedkin directed this and THE cop film of the 1970's:  The French Connection.
As is required in any great cop film there is the ubiquitous car chase scene.  This one does not disappoint.  Imagine going the wrong way on Santa Monica Blvd. AT RUSH HOUR!
William Peterson (of now CSI fame) makes possibly his most marked role of the 1980's in this film.  As his partner, John Pankow (of Mad About You) creates a antithesis to Peterson's character.  Both play Secret Service agents on the case of a counterfeiter - Willam Dafoe.

I almost said something, but after guessing his age (he was probably 8 years old in 1985), I kept mum. Those ""in the know"" can tell you exactly why ""To Live And Die In L.A."" is flying off the shelves-it is simply the best ""neo noir"" to ever be criminally ignored by the home entertainment industry (until now!) Essentially a remake of ""The French Connection"", infused with the ""Greed Is Good"" 80's zeitgeist, this Noir fan's wet dream is every bit as good as we remember it, addressing the cinemaste's senses on all levels: visual, aural and visceral. Perhaps most amazingly, director William Friedkin's unique use of L.A. locales remains unmatched, despite the fact that it is the most oft-filmed city on the planet. Friedkin's L.A. is painted in contrasts of dusky orange and strikingly vivid reds and blacks; an atmospheric Noir Hell. The starmaking performances by William Peterson and Willem Dafoe top off a uniformly excellent cast. Interestingly, most ""professional"" movie critics gave this one the 'thumbs down' back in 1985-I would challenge them to view it again, in context of the Hollywood offal in current release, and make a re-assessment. DVD notes: The stunning widescreen transfer should allay any fears fans may have had that the studio would ""blow it"". One disappointment: No 2-channel stereo audio option.

378201,5,6301758641,"I won't go into the movie itself. Those who have seen it know what a gem this piece is from the 80's. Gritty, real, unexpected twists. Instead, I'll go into what the ""Making Of"" featurette spells out, which makes this movie even better than before.
What is amazing is the story behind the camera. The 30-minute featurette that accompanies this DVD really defines why this movie, it's actors and it's sets seemed so real. Because they were. No fake studios, no rehearsals, just actors playing out their real emotions and not even knowing it.
William Friedkin is a master of getting what he wants on film. The feature shows how he made the actors think they were in a rehearsal take, but Friedkin would have the cameras rolling and more often than not, that would be a take with no one knowing about it until Friekdin would say, ""We're done!""
The whole scene where Chance and Vukovich steal the money and they finally get the guy down below the streets was supposed to be shot up until the point when Chance is about to slam the briefcase into the concrete piller. Friedkin never stopped shooting when Will Petersen started hammering the case into the wall. Having been told before by Friedkin, Petersen just went with the moment. The case bashing was not in the script and all the realism of when the case flies open finally and only a phonebook comes out was real. Petersen and Pankow didn't know what was in there. The emotions afterward of anger are real. Friedkin kept shooting because he didn't want to lose that edge that was present at that time. And you know what? It works to perfection.
The scenes of Pankow white as a ghost during, what is in my honest opinion one of the best car chase scenes ever filmed,  are real. The whole scene took 6 weeks to shoot and Will Petersen did a LOT of the driving, which made Pankow cringe and wonder what was going to happen next, which is why his looks of fear are real. This car chase even beats the car chase in Matrix Reloaded because there are NO digitally enhanced cars added in, especially during the wrong-way drive down the highway. It's all real and scripted by one of the best former stuntmen and now stunt coordinator, Buddy Joe Hooker. What's even more amazing is something I never noticed until it's brought to your attention in this feature: Peterson and Pankow, even though they are driving head-on towards on-coming traffic, are actually driving on the right side of the road! The cars on the other side of the median going the same direction as Peterson and Pankow are actually driving on the wrong side (left) of the freeway. It was a trick Friedkin did to generate confusion, just as you probably would have if you actually DID drive down the wrong side of the freeway! Absolutely amazing and ingenious.
Even though this feature is only 30 minutes, it reveals so much of how this movie was made and covers everything. It doesn't seem too short and covers a lot of what went into making this movie.
The infamous counterfeiting scene with William DaFoe? That was real conterfeit money they were making and the Secret Service DID get involved due to a crewmember's kids getting ahold of one-faced twenty dollar bills (unknowingly) and trying to buy something from the local mart. In fact, they obtained a ""creative consultant"" who apparently actually did some time because of his help with this movie. I'm not sure if that's a joke that the crew members were telling during the feature, but it's still amazing what lengths Friedkin went to try and make this film as real as possible. William Friedkin wants realism in his movies, and in this one, it's gritty realism right down to the bone and that's because, he shot it in real locations, with real emotions from then unknown actors (Petersen and Pankow) who were told to play by their emotions.
There is even a part where Pankow explains how he was approached by an undercover cop who saw the movie a year earlier. In the scene were Vukovich is going nuts after the robbery gone bad, we see he is in a blind panic. The undercover cop stated to Pankow that he had been there and that Pankow nailed it; the emotions, the rage, the fear, everything. What better complement as an actor can you get than that?
Other features include a deleted scene between Vukovich and his wife and an alternate ending (which thankfully Friedkin refused to put into the final release) where Chance and Vukovich end up in the North Pole somewhere. You can either watch the scenes without commentary or else, you can get a quick explanation before the scene to understand what was going on and why. Excellent stuff.
You even get audio commentary from Friedkin himself. I haven't watched the movie with the commentary yet to see how it is, but to know it's there is great.
(...) No fluff, just pure gritty realism that leaves you breathless when it's all over. Oh, and the soundtrack by Wang Chung fits perfectly here. Get the soundtrack as well. It, like the movie, puts you in a different world, but it's a world that exists and not the one Hollywood would normally want you to see LA depicted as, but it's there and it's real.",1070323200,9,5120,4.601750547045952
378202,5,6301758641,"Undoubtedly _the_ defining film of the 1980s.  It's all here - the greed, the corruption, the double-crossing... If you've forgotten what it was like to live through those times, or you weren't there and you've been brought up on vicarious retro-memories and have a romanticised view of it, here is the nature of that decade stripped bare:  A criminal who ""makes a mockery out of the whole god-damn system"", a law-enforcer who disregards the rules, breaks the law and siphons off the funny-money that he's supposed to be destroying in order to support his own lifestyle, and a legal system that's ham-strung by dogmatic procedure on one side and sleazy lawyers on the other.
It's just a shame that the public wasn't prepared to stomach such a realistic depiction of the world at the time.
Even though I live in England, my copy of the Region 1-only DVD has arrived (before the official US release date too) and all I can say is 'Hallelujah'!  It's every bit as good as we all remember.  It hasn't been panned and scanned, it's got interviews with Friedkin, Petersen, Pankow and the technicians and a hilarious alternate ending which is guaranteed to make you cringe.  There's only one deleted scene included, and that's unfortunately pretty poor quality (from a well-worn videotape, by the looks of it) but there's enough background to the shooting of the film in the documentary to make up for it.  Well, almost...  Trouble is, when you see some of the footage during the doc that didn't make it into the final cut you wonder whether there could have been a longer version - the original always seemed as if it had been trimmed quite a bit and the tantalising behind-the-scenes stuff that we see just whets the appetite for more that isn't available.  Ah well, it's here now and we should be grateful.
Also, we can at last Exorcise our memories of how To Live and Die in L.A. didn't become a hit on its release, yet about a year later Lethal Weapon became a massive one.  But then, nobody ever lost money by underestimating the taste of the public, did they?",1070150400,2,2059,4.665745856353591

Eric Masters ( Willem Dafoe) is a master at creating counterfiet cash, and is at the top of the agency's most wanted list for killing Chance's long time partner. Now Chance is willing to do whatever it takes to take Masters down, and the line between cop and criminal is starting to run thin. Both Chance and Masters waver on both sides of the law, as they take us on a cat and mouse chase through the streets of L.A. that is extremely suspenseful and never lets up!
""To Live and Die in L.A."", has to be one of the most suspenseful and action packed crime films that I have ever seen. Director William Friedkin is best known for the films ""French Connection"" and ""The Exorcist"". However, this has to be his best film. This is the first crime film that I have ever seen, that deals solely with the Secret Service, and NOT the FBI, CIA, or the police. That alone, makes it original. Not to mention the fact, that this is the only crime film, where the hero of the story has traits of a villan and is vulnerable. Some of Petersen's actions are actually questionable. William Petersen is an outstanding actor , and I have enjoyed all of his films. Secret Serive Agent Richard Chance, is one of his best characters by far because he loves to live on the edge, and plays by his own rules. Willem Dafoe is amazing in everything he does, and Eric Masters is one of his best roles. Masters is the story's villan, who is cold, calculating, highly intelligent, charming, and extremely ruthless! You don't know whether to like the guy, or hate the guy. John Turturo and Dean Stockwell are also both outstanding in their roles. This film also has one of the most surprising and disturbing endings that I have ever seen. The soundtrack is also amazing. It is basically a Wang Chung's Greatest Hits CD. Wang Chung is one of the best 80's groups of all time. Every song used is perfect, and really drives each scene.
In my opinion, it will be extremely difficult to find a crime film better than this one. Everything about it is perfect. The story is EXTREMELY original, the acting is phenomenal, the overall suspense will keep you on the edge of your seat, and the soundtrack is amazing. All I can say, is that it about time that this film was released on DVD. An absolute must buy!!",1068336000,42,2396,4.423076923076923
378205,5,6301758641,"It's nice to see that there are plenty of fans of this often-overlooked gem from 1985.  This has to be one of the best crime movies in a long time, and easily one of the best counterfeiting movies as it shows this dirty business from all angles.
William Friedkin was on top of the world for a brief time in the 1970s.  After Cruising (1980), he suffered personal and professional setbacks.  This film is proof positive that he is an exceptionally talented director with some of the best technical skills in the biz.  Indeed, Rules of Engagement and The Hunted provide recent proof that he can still deliver the goods.
To Live and Die in LA is not your ordinary cops and robber, dirty money, sex and violence tale.  The casting and the scripting are excellent; there is a lot up on the screen.  The characters are not superhero cops and crooks, but human beings driven by greed, revenge, hubris, and lust for money, power, and violence.  William Chance (the excellent William Petersen of current CSI fame) is a Secret Service agent whose partner is murdered by counterfeiter extraordinaire Eric Masters (Willem Dafoe).  Chance swears to take down Masters, one way or the other, a promise that sends he and his new partner Vukovitch into a tailspin of cat and mouse where they break the rules and get in over their heads.  This is not the old buddy movie formula or the typical Dirty Harry and the new partner scenario by a long shot.  Chance is an appropriate name for the hotdog agent who enjoys base jumping in his spare time (note the quick flash to his jump off the Vincent Thomas during the hectic chase).  Vukovitch is caught between doing right by his partner and bringing his career and his life crashing down.
This is not your typical LA cop film; Friedkin has gone to great lengths to film LA differently than most directors.  Indeed, this is the precursor to Heat and City of Industry, movies that dare to show LA as more than Hollywood and the hills and the downtown
area.  The title indicates a `life is cheap' attitude that is reflected in the poor, industrial landscapes of the City of Angels.  There's another Friedkin car chase that rivals The French Connection and was not made with any computer generated Matrix help.  Wang Chung add an excellent score--no joke!  The haunting piano riffs, synthesized screams for help, and loud, pulsing drum machine and sequencer tracks underscore the action without getting out shouted by the sound (like a lot of electronic film music).  The disc is in print, though oddly enough their hit 'Dance Hall Days', featured in the film, does not show up.  They even work the title of the film into a song(!)
The film is noir-ish quality in its character treatment.  Chance shacks up with a hooker who feeds him info, but he's ready to throw her back in the can if she doesn't deliver the goods.  There's a sleazy lawyer played by Dean Stockwell.  There's a gangly, nervous turncoat played by John Turturro.  There's a street hood played by Steve James who distributes 'paper' for Masters. And Vukovitch?  I won't dream of giving up the ending here.  There's even Ronald Reagan's voice making a cameo in the beginning.
This tough, violent film does not pull punches.  The world of cops and robbers, dirty lawyers and convicts, police politics and male ego, and above all, dirty money, are all starkly presented.  The lines are blurred when the agents will do anything to stop a suave
crook who is more complex than the cops themselves.  I love the scene of Masters burning his new painting after completing it.
How has this film been out of print for so long?  When a local video store was going out of business (squeezed out by a major), I snatched this tape up in the liquidation sale.  Thankfully, the film is FINALLY getting a proper DVD release.  Hopefully they'll widescreen it and give us a good print; the VHS version does not do the film any justice.

The grit and heat of L.A. are captured magnificently, the realism (no black and white, but real everyday grey realism) permeates every scene, the chase scenes equal or surpass the French Connection and Bullit, and the music keeps beat with the fast paced action.

378227,5,6301758641,"Yes, there are those squeamish souls who don't like ""To Live and Die in LA"". There are those who object to Sex and Violence in film, the same sex and violence that have been the shaping forces of every species on Earth.

In To Live and Die in LA, sex and violence are a metaphor for male goaling, male goaling that becomes so obsessive, it veers into nihilism -- but they are just a small part of an indelible cinematic package that appeals equally to the intellectual and the primal in all of us -- and no other actors in cinema have brought male conflict and male goaling to a sharper or more suicidal razor's edge than William Petersen and William Dafoe in their unforgettable portrayals as Chance and Masters. They both burn brighter here than in any role since.

Mr. Friedkin's work has frequently if not always been brilliant. But here he outdoes himself and brings the crime-genre film into new territory with Live and Die's fascinating exploration of the lives of secret service agent Richard Chance and counterfeiter Rick Masters.

In the apparently cold, pornographic, and oil-refinery-infested LA landscape, (with many locations in the Long Beach area) the two antagonists open it up with ""death wish"" sequences, Masters by burning his self portrait, and Chance by jumping off the Terminal Island bridge. Then the two go on to break all the rules and stop at nothing in this deadly and ultimately suicidal game of cat and mouse.

This film is dirtier, meaner, and leaner than Friedkin's earlier street crime epic, The French Connection. But the energy and vitality of Live and Die makes the earlier Best Film of 1971 look slow and turgid by comparison. The director has learned a great deal since those early days.

How did Friedkin even get permission to show all this counterfeiting stuff? Well, as we now learn in the DVD release, he didn't. Even showing US currency in films used to be illegal. Ex-secret service agent Gerald Petievich is Friedkin's inside connection, for he wrote the novel on which the film is based and co-wrote the screenplay for the film. But this celluloid is still so hot you'll be half expecting the Feds to confiscate it right out of your DVD player at any moment.

The gestalt of Live and Die is about the Zen yin/yang duality in every respect. Everything comes in pairs, including the cast. William and Willem. John Pankow and John Turturro. Debra and Darlene. Counterfeit currency and real currency.

The DVD release has been executed with loving care, from the awesome menu page and transitional effects to the special features, which include a sensational commentary track from Friedkin himself, a featurette about the making of Live and Die, two wonderful theatrical trailers (one of them narrated by the late Don LaFontaine), an alternate ending and a deleted scene.

Live and Die may be about counterfeiting, but the one thing Friedkin won't accept is cloned or ""counterfeit"" performances from his actors. As he explains in his commentary, he often goes for first performances or rehearsals, seeking the freshest, most spontaneous take possible.

Extremely high kudos to Bud Smith and M. Scott Smith for their superb editing, Wang Chung for their rich, rich electronic-rock score, with it's crystalline, coke-snorting piano samples and thick and punchy percussion. (with counterfeiting as the theme of the movie, using acoustic instruments would have been inappropriate -- the phony string samples sound better). The opening titles and the entire film are a delight of pacing and unsurpassed graphic style.

The plot is quite interesting, as are many details -- predominant among them, a portrayal of a means by which counterfeit currency is made -- and the story features the best movie chase scene of all time.
There are, in the context of this film, some great lines. Secret Service agent John Chance (William Petersen, he of the bowest bow-legs in America) is an edge-of-the-envelope adrenalin addict who spends his spare time bungee-jumping off huge bridges. At one point, he casually asks his weeny partner, ""Ever do any base jumping?"" -- as a normal person might ask another, ""Ever go bowling?""
Chance is shacking up with a beautiful hooker who doubles as an exotic dancer and police intelligence source. Soon after they've enjoyed, uh, congress, she asks what he would do if she could no longer help him. ""I'd have your parole revoked,"" he says bluntly. After she tells him she needs money, he says, ""If you want bread, (enjoy intercourse with) a baker.""

378292,5,6301758641,"This is Friedkin's masterpiece and one of the greatest crime movies of all time, still horribly underrated since its box-office (half-)failure in 1985. It's even more underrated than the (good) novel it's based upon, written by Gerald Petievich, a former FBI special agent. And it's so underrated that there's still no DVD of this film released, despite its high success in VHS. Frankly, I don't understand...
Everything is surprising, everything is amazing in this movie: the first roles played by unknown - but far from bad - actors, the dark atmosphere of L.A., described as a decadent, upside down city, as fake as Masters' counterfeited bills, the haunting soundtrack composed by the Wang Chung band - hear 'City of the Angels', 'Dance all Days' and 'Wait' -, a strong editing by Bud Smith, a great photo by Robby ""Paris, Texas"", ""Ghost Dog"" Muller and of course a superb directing, despite the low budget.
As underrated as the movie, William Petersen, in his first leading role (four years after an appearance in Michael Mann's first movie, ""Thief""), is perfect as a 'kamikaze' cop, who breaks the law to revenge Jim Hart, his master, partner and friend. His confrontation with great Willem Dafoe, as the charismatic, cool, pervert gangster, is the most interesting aspect of the movie. After ""To Live and Die in L.A."", Petersen played Will Graham, the very first 'profiler' in movie history (created by Thomas Harris in his cult novel, ""Red Dragon""), facing Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lecter in Michael Mann's ""Manhunter"". And after that - and despite his starring status in blockbuster series 'CSI' -, nothing, not one single main part in movies... Can this be explainable? The car chase (the one of the 20th century!) is perfectly shot and edited, with plenty of malice, easily beating the ones in ""Bullitt"" and ""The French Connection"". But the most surprising film is that final sequence, showing the main character shot in the face... a unique plan in history.
This is a masterpiece that frankly deserves a DVD release, more than all the zero movies released every year. I got it in VHS and I've been waiting for many years now. But we have to say that William Friedkin doesn't need such a release: the DVD of his ""Exorcist"", still among the top list about thirty years after the film came out in theaters, seems largely enough...
Such a shame. All we can do is 'Wait', as the Wang Chung band singer says in the end...",1052179200,,2426,4.848192771084338
378293,5,6301758641,"For the last 100 years motion pictures have been defining and depicting the world we live in.  Some movies epitomize the time and place they represent, and some movies are defined by their times.  ""The Thin Man"" is New York City in the late 1930's.  If I wished to show somebody what America was about in the mid 1980's I would show them three films.  ""Top Gun"", because it shows who we hoped we were, Blade Runner because it shows who we were afraid that we were becoming and ""To Live and Die in LA"" because it shows how we really felt about a large segment of our society.
William Friedkin directed this cops-and-robbers thriller about pair of secret service agents (William L. Peterson and John Pankow) on the trail of a brilliant counterfeiter (Willem Dafoe).  The characters are cutting edge clichs played by actors, at the time largely unknown, who came close to perfection under Friedkin's able hand.  There is a seedy, underbelly appeal to this film that ranks up with the best of the 1030' & 40' detective movies.  There is an excellent story line with enough angles and turns to satisfy the most Machiavellian mind.  Even the one brilliant bit of homage to the modern police drama, the obligatory ""car chase scene"" is handled with finesse and a twist that leaves you breathless even after the umpteenth time you've seen it.
The score by Wang Chung gets directly to the point.  From the opening scene of the rippling, wind whipped flags of a Presidential motorcade to the final, stark line ""You're working for me now."" there is no doubt that this is not a ""nice"" movie.
The film however belongs to Robby Muller and his magic cameras.  He shows up what we came to see, the LA that we never see on TV, the LA of the street hustler and the white, lower-middleclass junkie.  There are no awe inspiring special effects, no laser light shows, no larger-that-life action sequences with kung foo fighters wiping out hoards of bad guys.  There is just the reality of LA by the back door caught on film by a master craftsman.  Here is cinematography that holds your eye, even when you wish that you could look away.
""To Live and Die in L. A."" is breath taking and exciting, hard and mean and too real.  I love this film.  It takes ""Miami Vice"" the next step into reality.",1051833600,5,2270,4.542997542997543

378295,5,6301758641,"This was, as another reviewer said, one of the best films made in the decade of the 80's.  Why this one has not yet made it to DVD is beyond me (particularly given some of the other trash we get the privilege to buy every day). Inexplicably, it is even out of stock on VHS! In a nutshell, it is the story of a young U.,S. Secret Service agent, whose partner gets killed by a master counterfeiter, and the chase to payback.
I don't know how realistic it actually is, but the scenes with Willem Dafoe actually creating his counterfeit money are very well done.  It is as if this is the way to do it.  This gives the movie more than an edge, but a incredibly realistic feel.
Ably directed by William Friedkin.  I guess someone challenged him to do a more harrowing chase scene that he did in The French Connection.  He starts with a short O.J.-like (from his Hertz days, that is)chase through LAX (ending with a bit of humor in the bathroom as Secret Service agents have the drop on the bad guy, awhile the L.A.P.D. has the drop on the Agents, and a citizen shows saying he showed up just to relieve himself). Then, he really outdid himself and came close with his chase through the Los Angeles rush hour highways (yeah, I know it is an oxymoron), ending up going the wrong way on a freeway.
It is a rather bleak look at cops and robbers (aren't they all?), with the Federales and the lawyers, and the crooks, and the inmates and the informants all working at their contrary purposes.
Incredibly violent (like when the first Secret Service agent gets shotgunned by the bad guys).  As noted, a great soundtrack by Wang Chung. Great early performances by Dafoe, William Peterson, John Turturro, and a host of others we now see with regularity. But the bottom line is one man chasing another, doing everything to get the job done.

The plot is quite interesting, as are many details -- predominant among them, a portrayal of a means by which counterfeit currency is made -- and the story features the best movie chase scene of all time.
There are, in the context of this film, some great lines.  Secret Service agent John Chance (William Petersen, he of the bowest bow-legs in America) is an edge-of-the-envelope adrenalin addict who spends his spare time bungee-jumping off huge bridges.  At one point, he casually asks his weeny partner, ""Ever do any base jumping?"" -- as a normal person might ask another, ""Ever go bowling?""
Chance is shacking up with a beautiful hooker who doubles as an exotic dancer and police intelligence source.  Soon after they've enjoyed, uh, congress, she asks what he would do if she could no longer help him.  ""I'd have your parole revoked,"" he says bluntly.  After she tells him she needs money, he says, ""If you want bread, (enjoy intercourse with) a baker.""
You'll recognize most of the stars.
