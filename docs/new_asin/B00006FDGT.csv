1747692,4,B00006FDGT,"This is an enjoyable, if light, little flick.  A fairly simple plot, held together by the personalities of its stars.  Adrian Grenier plays his role as the title character with a kind of moody unfocused intensity that suggests a profound intelligence combined with a serious lack of impulse control.  Sarah Michelle Gellar is decidedly un-Buffy in perhaps her best screen role to date.  And Joey Lauren Adams - ah, Joey Lauren Adams, sounding more intelligent (and hence sexier) than I've seen her since, oh, ""Chasing Amy.""  I liked this flick, I recognized it was flawed, but I didn't care.",1028678400,3,591,4.929292929292929
1747693,5,B00006FDGT,"Although James Toback's editing style takes a little getting used to (he tends to cut back and forth from scene to scene) this is still a great thought provoking film about a college student's attempts to escape the ever increasing banality of his life - first with sex and then by taking a huge quantity of LSD.
Adrian Grenier does a fine job in a difficult role, as the eponymous Harvard Man, however the real star of the film is Sarah Michelle Gellar, who as always, is superb and hugely entertaining - playing a smart, sexy, manipulative and fast talking gangster's daughter with the delightful name of Cindy Bandolini.
Okay, so this won't be to everyone's tastes I'm sure but if like me you're a fan of Sarah Michelle Gellar's brilliant character acting or James Toback's unique style of film making then this is a must-see.",1023408000,8,829,4.684931506849315
1747694,1,B00006FDGT,"Harvard Man, the plot:
A sexy Boston College cheerleader and daughter of the local mafia boss (Sarah Michelle Geller) convinces a Harvard basketball player to join her in a risky and illegal gambling scheme. The player throws some games, starts a romantic involvement with his philosophy professor, and indulges in drugs.
Later, everything starts to unravel, and the Harvard cager has to find his way out of the mess, and deal with the cheerleader, her mafioso father, and the FBI.
Even Eric Stolz can't save this, nor can Joey Lauren Adams.
Buffy fans beware:  this one's a stinker.
It nearly went straight to video without a theatrical release at all, and the reason is:  it's pitiful.
It's a terrible movie; nothing works...",1023235200,4,727,4.950819672131147
1747765,3,B00006FDGT,When you watch this movie you will experience Harvard like you've never seen before and realize why you will think this is more of a cult and not something mainstream. All in all it's very enjoyable experience. If you liked trainspoiting you will like this.,1270598400,,257,4.733333333333333
1747766,5,B00006FDGT,"This Movie is good, if your a Sarah M.Gellar fan you will like it. If your not then you will not understand it. She is NOT BUFFY in this movie. There are SEX acts you will not belive your eyes, but little Nudity for Sarah M. Gellar. It involves Drugs and a Basketball player and the Organized Crime Family from Boston. I like what the Director James Toback did with the Drug scences in the movie. It does take place at Haravrd University and Sarah is a Cheerleader for Holy Cross University,dating the player from Harvard. I like it and have watched it many times.",1258934400,,564,4.380952380952381
1747767,3,B00006FDGT,"Alan Jensen (Adrien Grenier), the point guard on the Harvard basketball team, enjoys an exciting college life. He is deeply involved in philosophy and  hopes to one day reach the other side and figure out what is really inside of him. Helping him to find himself are two beautiful women : Chesney Court (Joey Lauren Adams) his philosophy professor, and Cindy Bandolini (Sarah Michelle Gellar) the daughter of a rumored mob boss. Alan enjoys nothing more than sleeping with them, getting high with them and discussing the meaning of life with them. But when his parent's house is destroyed in a tornado Alan becomes desperate to raise enough money to buy them a new one. This is where Cindy comes in. She tells Alan that her father will give him the money as a gift. Alan later learns that as payback he must throw an upcoming basketball game. His morals won't let him but once he realizes that this is his only option he goes along with the plan.  What he doesn't count on is that Cindy is using him to make some cash for herself. Factor in Allan's drug use which he has stepped up to LSD, two FBI agents (Eric Stoltz and Rebecca Gayheart) who are into threesomes with Chesney and who want her to help them get Alan, and Al Franken in a funny cameo and the film becomes a confusing mess with far too much going on. That's exactly the way Toback likes it though. He likes throwing as many characters and plot points in the mix so that he, like Alan, can find some truth in things. The film is intelligently written and often stylishly directed. The performances are hit and miss: Grenier is occasionally good as Alan but most of his line readings are embarrassing, Gellar and Lauren Adams handle themselves quite well, Gayheart is okay in a limited role and Stoltz is quite amusing as a man who as one character puts it ""speaks in four different accents and walks with a limp"". The film is a good comedy/drama full of Toback's usual blend of sex, gambling, and philosophical debates. He provides his usual entertaining commentary in the DVD extras.",1242345600,,2047,4.574931880108992

1747770,1,B00006FDGT,"Like most reviewers, I rented this movie because Sarah Michelle Geller was in it.  I am a HUGE fan of Buffy and her other movies such as Scream and the Grudge. She is an extrememly talented acctress and after watching this movie I can't imagine WHY she agreed to star in this film.  Quit simply it was horrible. Some of the sex scenes she had were too racy for my taste and just dissappointing that she would agree to sell herself like this.  Oddly enough after this movie her next 2 hits would be the Family movies - Scooby Doo and Scooby Doo part 2.  I read on alot of fan sites that they were upset in her role in this movie.  After this her roles were MUCH more carefully chosen.  Thank Goodness !!  If you are still unsure .. I highly suggest renting this instead of spending your $$ on purchasing it.",1154131200,5,806,4.228758169934641
1747771,2,B00006FDGT,"The only reason why I decided to buy this movie was because Sarah Michelle Gellar was in it. And well that's maybe because I am the biggest obsessor of Sarah Michelle since her day's in All My Children. But i've followed her through everything she has been through and I have boughten it all, and respectably all her movies have been great to watch. But this. to make this plain and simple.

The only thing this movie has going for itself is that Sarah Michelle Gellar was in it. Adrian can not act for his life. He has to be one of the worst actors in Hollywood ever. It's pathetic over how he books any movies or gets on tv. Sarah Michelle Gellar's acting pretty much saved this movie from the big negative stars it would have been. But Sarah Michelle could have chosen a better movie to be in instead of this, but you know. Money is money I guess. So if your a fan of Sarah Michelle Gellar, or the mafia, you may like this movie. But for me, this is the worst movie Sarah Michelle Gellar has done, even though she was not bad in it. Her acting shines time and time again.",1139616000,2,1074,4.213592233009709
1747772,1,B00006FDGT,"I dearly love Sarah Michelle Gellar and Joey Lauren Adams.  The whole reason I bought this movie in a $5.99 bargain bin was because of the two of them.  And neither nor both of them was enough to save this film for me.

This movie jumps and bounces all over the place.  The basketball player is cheating on the mafia girl with his professor.  The professor is cheating on the basketball player with a couple of swingers.  The chemistry student made up LSD ""according to the original formula"" and the basketball player carried it on a plane and no drug dogs caught him?  And a Harvard student is stupid enough to take five doses when he's been warned only to take one?

And as if the previous part of the movie wasn't bad enough... then we get to watch the rest of the movie through the funhouse mirror of an LSD trip, the swingers coincidentally turn out to be FBI agents investigating the mafia girl's dad, the deal with the dad turns out to be a sham... what the HECK?

Sorry but this movie stinks.  Like I said above, I only paid $5.99 in a bargain bin for it and I feel like I got ripped off.",1137024000,2,1096,4.251207729468599
1747773,2,B00006FDGT,"James Toback on occasion makes the good films, Two Girls and a Guy and Black & White being two good movies he has done...a real bad one would be When Will I Be Loved with Neve Campbell which was so annoying and the characters were so annoying. Adrian Grenier (HBO's Entourage), who's only good in times when he's preaching what his teacher has said or when he's blitzed out of his mind on 500 Grams of the new ""LSD"" other then that he's flat, plays the Harvard Man here who is sleeping with his Professer, played by Joey Lauren Adams (Chasing Amy) and also a daughter of a Mafioso, played by Sarah Michelle Gellar (Tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer) and who borrows money from the don in order to buy his parents, whose old house got destroyed in a hurricane, a new house but then things suddenly go down hill with his friends and the don and some cops and then he takes the 500 Grams of LSD in which everything around him suddenly changes in reality, bends and contorts and he's preaching nonsense and hearing voices in his head. Adds up to being a big headache of a movie. Sarah Michelle isn't special here....she has some scenes where's shes being a naughty girl but she isn't that great, Adams is really flat, Eric Stoltz (SciFi's The Triangle) and Rebecca Gayheart (Nothing To Lose) are wasted, so is John Neville (Urban Legend), Ray Allen (He Got Game) didn't act in this and Al Franken (Saturday Night Live, Stuart Saves His Family) had a funny cameo. Could've been better, hey and it could've been worse.",1134172800,,1508,4.507299270072993
1747774,3,B00006FDGT,"Like most viewers -I suppose- I initially felt curious about the film because of Sarah Michelle Gellar; yet how much more I got, than just SMG- for this film wasn't, first and foremost, all about sexy good looks...

The film's casting is extremely well thought out: both Adrian Grenier (as green ""Harvard Boy"") and Joey Lauren Adams (as cool, sophisticated philosophy teacher) carry off their respective roles with tremendous talent. What's more, I couldn't find in it one single actor or actress who wasn't EXACTLY what the film needed.

So- superb casting. Adrian Grenier is good precisely for he's such 'your ordinary young Harvard guy'- and Adams, for she's the typecast epitome of sexy, hot and -at first sight- glib coolness. Yet as the film evolves, Adams, especially, turns out to be much more than that- her glibness hiding wisdom far beyond her years (it may well be that Adams' performance was the best among all these -here, very talented- actors/actresses).

Gellar's part, surprisingly, is not a central one. Yet she carries off her Daddy's girl bitchiness, and callous sex appeal, with flying colours (this is probably the film where, to this day, her acting's by far the best- nothing to do with her poor performances in the two ""Scooby Doo""-es, or even in the record- breaking [??] ""The Grudge""). Rebecca Gayheart and Eric Stoltz (as the two FBI agents, and pretty unhealthy sex-seekers) are perfectly chosen, their acting both cool and convincing, their persona tortuously screwed-up. One special mention I'd give to Giani Russo, as Gellar's maffioso Daddy (strangely enough, Russo's not even credited on the DVD's cover, nor its back- a shame!).

The plot is good; is clever; is full of unexpected twists and turns; and yet, is not at all your average 'crime-thriller', bland all-American product (as easy to watch as it is to forget...).

I shan't go here into the storyline. I'll just say it's sharp; intellectually challenging; affording us plenty of food for thought. Toback's depicting of the developing of a drug addiction is blunt and factual- all the more effective in all that it hints at, rather than it would have, if it'd explicitly and darkly ""accused"".

So- after such high praise, why do I give this movie ONLY 3 STARS???

For two reasons:

- first, a very disorganised (and often annoying) soundtrack: practically all of the pop sound's good, but... the Bach, good heavens! What's it meant to say- express- CONVEY? Sophistication? Some sort of 'seriousness'?

Well- to me, that Bach IS a misfire.

- second, and also extremely difficult to digest: COLOUR!!! Who on earth may have thought up that drab, dirty brown photography? Did the film, when shown at the movies, show the same tasteless colours? Or -more prosaically- did something go wrong in the developing process??? One couldn't do much worse than this brownish, teal-ish Technicolor mess.

However, attempting to tie up all strings: on the whole, this is a VERY satisfying, sharp, intelligent film, with superb acting, close-to-perfect script and dialogue, and no maudlin soppiness- in fact, definitely a film I'd recommend to all viewers who -in spite of the annoying Bach soundtrack, and the close-to-nauseating colour scheme, at least in its DVD form- like to THINK OVER a film, after seeing it; REFLECTING on what they've seen, as they run the movie in their heads again. This is a film I'd suggest 'intellectually curious and active' people have at home, so they can view it again when they feel like it. For 'Harvard Man', I think, grows on you; and requires much thought, and 'finesse'.",1124496000,,3587,4.991624790619765

1747818,5,B00006FDGT,"I actually liked this movie. Initially, the cheesy DVD cover and the creepy-looking leading man grabbed my attention. Honestly, I only decided to watch this movie for the enjoyment of a good laugh. Yes, I do admit to being a Buffy the Vampire Slayer fan, but not an obsessed fan of Sarah Michelle Gellar. (Xander is more my style.) All of Sarah's movie choices seem to be hit and miss outside the realm of Joss Whedon. However, I've never attempted to pursue any kind of acting career, so who am I to judge?

This movie is fragmented yet well constructed. It definitely moves fast and keeps your mind active. The LSD trip does completely remove you from the plot and you can't help but giggle at the distorted faces. Then the non-stop voices do become extremely annoying. When the voices disappear the plot reappears yet now seems unimportant. I found this fascinating.

So, I immediately watched it again.

The second time through, I got it. The ride the movie takes us on is extremely artistic in nature. All the scenes going on at once completely reflects ""life"". Even the editing jumps in the film reflect the scenes of life as we see it. When our eyes move from one place to another, the space in between DOES jump! Think about it. It completely makes sense to me! The key to understanding focuses upon the dialogue of that cheesy-grinning character, the Philosophy Professor. Pay attention. Through her lectures, she describes ""insanity"" and the curiousity surrounding it and crossing over into it. She is the one who explains what the entire movie is about. Not Sarah. Not the creepy-looking guy. The professor.

Although the movie requires much deep thinking and reflection, it's really genius because of that. The viewer is innocently lead into a scary situation more powerful than being chased by the FBI or organized crime. The one thing that surpasses fear: insanity.

So all you artistic/philosophical thinkers out there, definitely watch this movie. But remember, you must watch it more than once and listen to the professor.",1123459200,2,2039,4.8645533141210375

Since im a fan of her... well The biggest fan of smg, I had to love it! she was so0o0 funny and mean to people, she just made me laugh. It was about a collage student (Allen) in havard that needed $100,000 for his parents because there hous was wrecked in a tornato. So Allen asks Cindy (SMG) for the money, since her father is a gangster (and very rich). He ends up getting the money and police find out and attact Cindy and allen, but they don't arrest them, since there all drug users and sex addicts. I recomend this to all Sarah Michelle Gellar fans around the world!",1098748800,,637,4.316666666666666
1747822,4,B00006FDGT,"This movie is pretty much only for you if you are an SMG fan. Like, a BIG SMG fan. I could hardly stand Adrian Grenier. He was so annoying. The plot is kind of retarted. Like I said, Sarah Michelle Gellar looks great in this movie, but the role is not like her usual ones. She is a pivotal part of the plot, yes, but she's not the lead.  This movie showed that she has range and can play the daughter of a mafia/mob-boss-type-guy. Like I mentioned before, the plot is kind of diluted. The main character, Alan (Adrian Grenier) is short, skinny and whiny- how in the world did he get to be POINT GUARD for Harvard? That and he's ugly. You'd think someone like Cindy Badolini (SMG) would go out with (and screw) someone a little more attractive, being as she is a rich, beautiful mob daughter.  Alan is a nice kid, trying to help out his parents; but really, who asks a mobster for $100,000 and throws a game for it? The FBI angle is totally stupid, with some sick agents, which ultimately get Alan and Bandolini out of the whole mess. The drugs are dumb as well, and although the drug induced special effects are cool, they get boring.

  Chesney (Joey Lauren Adams), Alan's professor/lover, is pretty much the only sane one in the entire movie. I can't see why she would bang Alan either, unless the guy is seriously packing, if you know what I mean.

  Bandolini's lackeys are funny and interesting to watch. They offer some much needed comic relief to this movie.

  There are a few love scenes, if you can call them *love* scenes. The two with Cindy and Alan are odd in that they don't even look at eachother in either of thier scenes, and in the second one, they are discussing Alan throwing a game for the $100,000.

  Alan's character is full of crap, spouting some stupid philosiphy while doing drugs after a romp with Chesney.

  All in all, this movie is okay. SMG has plenty of scenes, and she does really well playing a mob daughter. If you're not a fan of her though, don't watch it, cause she's pretty much the only reason to watch it.",1091404800,3,2048,4.375661375661376
1747823,4,B00006FDGT,"First off, as a rather big SMG fan, I cannot believe this film has received lower ratings than ""Simply Irresistible""!  That was a limp, wooden ""romantic comedy"" featuring a couple who lacked any chemistry.
""Harvard Man"", on the other hand, has a modicum of style, plot, and intelligence behind it.  It doesn't really work in the final analysis - not because of any failings of the acting, which is mostly excellent (although I just can't overcome my aversion to Joey Lauren Adams' squeaky voice), but because the movie doesn't quite hit the pitch of danger that I felt it needed to sustain the drama.  Toback, however, does compelling things with sequencing, flash forwards and back, and with camerawork, split-screen and so on, and the dialogue is mostly fine. The lighting has a nice grainy amber texture to it and the soundtrack is a fun mix of hip-hop and classical.
Grenier in the lead does well, Stolz and Gayheart are great, and Sarah Michelle - and yes, I do have a slight bias - proves again that she has excellent range.  As well as being a cutie-patootie.  ""Scooby Doo"" and all is fine, but please, SMG, pick a project that will demonstrate your dramatic chops to the non-believers out there! I'd love to see her do work on the big screen as fine as that in ""The Body"" or ""Innocence"" in BtVS...",1087257600,,1305,4.632034632034632
1747824,2,B00006FDGT,"I am a little surprised that Harvard has not sued the makers of this film for associating the ivy-league college with such a horrible cinematic experience.  I, like many, sought this film out because Sarah Michelle Geller was in it; when I learned Rebecca Gayheart was also in the cast, I thought to myself: How bad can a film with both Geller and Gayheart be?  Let me tell you: pretty doggone bad.  First and foremost, the storyline and script are simply dreadful and ill-conceived, and these problems are only exacerbated by the prominence of some untalented actors in the cast.  Alan Grenier is Alan Jensen, supposedly the starting point guard on the Harvard basketball team, despite the fact that he is rather short, has no semblance of athletic skill, and really doesn't even try to look like he knows what he's doing when he's on the basketball court.  Honestly, this is one of the worst casting decisions I've ever seen.  Did I mention the fact that his acting skills also seem to be in short supply?  Sarah Michelle Gellar plays Cindy Bandolini, the unprincipled daughter of a mafia don and girlfriend of Alan; talk about your odd couple; several love scenes between the two are just icky.  Of course, our ruggedly unhandsome Alan is not content with Cindy; no, he is also sleeping with his philosophy professor Chesney Cort (played by the helium-voiced Joey Lauren Adams).
Back in Kansas, a tornado destroys the home of Alan's parents, and he is determined to get the one hundred thousand dollars needed for them to rebuild.  In steps Cindy with a plan to make a killing off a sports bet; all Alan has to do is throw the big game against Dartmouth.  Soon, the FBI is nosing around, everybody sort of panics, hope rises in the viewer that at least one of these dreadful characters will die, and then a pretty impossible if not ludicrous ending is thrown together at the end.  You don't really even care how bad the conclusion is because you are just glad the film is finally over.
I don't think I've ever seen a movie go to such lengths to annoy its audience.  Almost every scene features what I would call stop gaps; every few seconds, the film seems to jump a few frames for no reason whatsoever; this is a short-term technique that should be used sparingly, but the director of Harvard Man shot the entire movie this way, and it made me want to scream.  Then there is the music; it's just awful, and even worse it is constant and far too loud most of the time.  I guess a lot of it is supposed to sound Italian or something, even though the Mafia bit is not that important to the film.  The inclusion of Ray Allen, an actual basketball player, in the movie also makes no sense.  When Allen's character talks to Grenier, both of them seem to be in a race to see who can say his lines the fastest, and Allen tries so hard not to look like a professional basketball player that he ends up looking just as bad as everyone around him on the court.  Just when you think things can't possibly get any worse, we are taken along for an extended LSD trip in which all the voices the character hears building up inside his head assault our own ears as well in a rising crescendo.  This, in conjunction with all the other problems, qualifies this film as pure and utter torture.  I have no idea why Sarah Michelle Gellar chose to participate in Harvard Man, but it almost has to be a decision she now regrets.",1063756800,26,3408,4.4943273905996755

The directing in this film is also wonderful, I really like the tone. I gave this movie four stars, because It was good. I just didn't like one thing about it, when the main character, Allen (adrien Grenier, or however it is spelled!), is on drugs, I guess they wanted you to see the movie from his point of view, but all that really happens is the picture squishes (for lack of better word) up, and THAT REALLY GETS ANNOYING!

1747826,5,B00006FDGT,"Well, I was surfing the TV channels late at night one day and I ran across this movie on UPN. I had never heard of it before, and I decided to give it a try due to the fact that I was extremely bored.

  Myself being a casual Buffy fan, meaning I've seen 15 episodes at the most, I figured I'd watch it because Sarah Michelle Gellar was in it. But keep in mind that is only what got me to watch the movie in the first place and skip over Goldeneye on Telemundo (which is, by the way, a very good version of the movie, si t hablas espaol and can find it on some station.)
  If you go into this movie expecting to see a lot of Sarah Michelle Geller (henceforth called SMG), you will be grossly dissapointed. She doesn't have that big of a role in this film. I went into the movie with an open mind, and tried to ignore the really annoying scenes in the beginning with slow frame rates and jerky camera movements, plus hearing 2 songs at once, overtop of commentary.
  But even though the beginning is very annoying, the rest of the movie is very good. I don't need to give a rundown of the plot, but I will say it takes a bit of understanding and intelligence to be able to take in all that is happening and not be overly confused.
  I personally really enjoyed the movie, and can't understand how all of these negative reviewers didn't like it at all. In my opinion, it is a must buy.",1053820800,8,1383,4.111524163568773
1747867,3,B00006FDGT,"I watched this movie because it had Sarah Michelle Gellar in it and I am a big fan of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer.""  I am not, in common parlance, hot for Gellar (Alyson Hannigan's smile does it for me), but for those who check out ""Harvard Man"" specifically to enjoy the actress this film starts to deliver while the image on the screen is still blank.  However, it will not take long for you to figure out that Gellar is just eye candy in this film (even more so on the DVD) because the real focus is on the character of Alan Jensen (Adrian Grenier), the alter-ego of writer-director James Toback who takes a kitchen sink approach to loading problems on this particular Harvard student to make his life explode for our cinematic enjoyment.
Alan is the point guard for Harvard's basketball team, who is ""seeing"" Cindy Bandolini (Gellar); she is not only a cheerleader at Holy Cross, but her father (Gianni Russo) is also the chief Mafioso for the Northeastern United States.  He is also seeing Chesney Cort (Joey Lauren Adams), a Harvard Philosophy professor with one of the more interesting lecturing voices in the history of academia.  But then Alan's life is disrupted by a tornado in Kansas that wipes out his family's uninsured home and a chemistry student friend who has baked up some new and improved LSD.  So Alan needs $100,000 and suggests to Cindy that maybe her father can float him a loan.  Cindy reports that this can happen, but Alan would have to do something in return and suddenly we are into the wonderful world of point shaving in the big Harvard-Dartmouth game.  If this was not enough fun, Alan pops the acid just as the FBI are about to make their presence known.  Almost all of the above action takes place to the accompaniment of music by J. S. Bach.
""Harvard Man"" will remind you of some of Toback's earlier films, especially his first script for ""The Gambler"" and his 1987 ""The Pick-Up Artist.""  These a films where not only are we watching interesting things happening to the characters, but where the characters tend to explore themselves and their actions in great detail (a tendency that extends even to the Mutt and Jeff Mafia hitmen running around in a sub-plot).  For those of us who remember drug sequences from Sixties films trying to represent acid trips, ""Harvard Man"" is relatively tame and Toback ends up trying to pull a rabbit out of the hat at the end to set things right.  Still, Gellar actually does end up with more to do in this film than look good and the story managed to get Eric Stoltz, John Neville and N.B.A. superstar Ray Allen on board.  ""Harvard Man"" ends up being a high-paced roller coaster ride in which you have no idea how it is all going to play out, which is certainly nothing like being boring and predictable.

1747868,3,B00006FDGT,"This is not a film with out faults by any means, who ever thought casting Adrian Grenier was a good idea needs someone to scream what where you thinking - the boy cant act! at them, as its true, He hasn't got the range or charm to carry this film. But Sarah Michelle Geller and Joey Lauren Adams on the other hand do have a lot range and charm, the former being a very sassy a devious daughter of a mob man and the latter being a cool and chilled out Harvard professor.
The picture is edited with frenetic energy, Toback uses jump cuts and inter cuts scenes at every opportunity. Annoyingly the sound track he picks to accompany this movie isn't always the best, using rap and hip hop music and playing it at the same time as classical pieces can be quite hard on the ears and very distracting from the dialog.
Over all Harvard man is a film with plus and minus points, neither one really dominating (thus the three star rating) with a different leading man and better soundtrack music this could have been twice the film it already is. I suggest renting it before purchasing.",1045440000,4,1076,4.385
1747869,2,B00006FDGT,"Two stars for having Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ray Allen in believable and well-portrayed roles.  Otherwise this (deservedly) direct-to-video movie is a mess filled with extraneous jump-cuts, overdone acid-trip subjective view effects, cliched mob boss scenes, gangsters so stupid that it's not funny, and even dumber FBI agents.  Don't trust ryan deffley's review, he couldn't even get the facts straight in his synopsis.  (the mob boss DID NOT want or instigate the point-shaving scheme)
Adrian Grenier did a creditable job as the main character who tries to find meaning in life, but at the end settles for being himself and doing what he enjoys.  For a better movie involving gambling, gangsters, and getting out of trouble, try _Rounders_.

I was pleasantly surprised that the plot ended up being somewhat good.  The acting isn't very good at all.  SMG does her best to play a limited part, but just can't carry the film.  I really thought I would like this film as I'm a huge SMG fan and I really like some of the other actors in this move.  When it was over, I felt I had wasted my time and really felt this move shouldn't get any stars.  There is a reason it went direct to DVD.

Adrian's parents are stripped from their homes, and need money to get one, $100 000! Cindy(Sarah Michelle Gellar) is one who is able and willing to give him that money! He also meets his professor(Joey Lauren Adams(Michael)) who happens to fall in love with! Anyways, it's not bad, not the greatest, but it'll do!",1037836800,,601,4.733333333333333
1747873,1,B00006FDGT,"Honestly, the only reason for me seeing Harvard Man is the presence of Sarah Michelle Gellar in the film. I believe her being in the film is what actually sold the movie to a studio. Rightfully done, since she was the only entertaining part of the whole film. And even her performance was a bit weak.
 Harvard Man tells the story of a young Harvard student (Who is experimental with drugs, and is fairly promiscuous) who gets involved with a mob boss' daughter. When a bet is made between the two that leads to him throwing a highly important basketball game, all goes down hill. Fairly simple, yet I found myself losing the point of the story occasionally. Just why exactly did the FBI want with the Harvard guy? To have a link to the big mobster guy? Hm?
 Along with the dialogue, performances seem a bit rushed. The only one who seems to sit back and enjoy was Eric Stoltz. Not that he has much screen time. The main star here is Adrian Grier (Drive Me Crazy). I didn't enjoy his performance. Only when he was high off of 15,000 somethings of ecstasy was his performance even the least bit interesting. Sarah Michelle Gellar was great as always, and actually seemed to take the movie into her own hands. Joey Lauren Adams is undeniably cute, and she fairs well. Rebecca Gayheart was shortly seen, and her character just seemed off. And were the two Italian hitmen supposed to be for comedy relief? No, to me, they were just plain annoying.
 Hard to say if I'll ever sit through another watching of Harvard Man. Ever. Again.",1037404800,,1526,4.521739130434782
1747874,2,B00006FDGT,"Read the other reviews for plot and story information.
After reading the synaposis about sex, drugs and gambling on the video cover in which Sarah Gellar, Joey Adams,and Rebecca Gayheart are present, I could only anticipate the sexy possibilities that could be forthcoming.
Unfortunately, the lack of any interesting storyline in the plot killed any notion of that even 1/2 hour into the movie.
It's hard to even imagine that Alan Jensen (Adrian Grenier) would even be able to bed both the Professor Chesney, and his girlfriend Cindy even if he is on the basketball team. We never know what Jensen's personality is really like except that he is into drugs. Is he smart, funny, what got him into Harvard? Who knows & who cares?
Gellar is acceptable as the daughter of a mobster. Adams is the most enjoyable part of the movie, with her raspy, sexy voice. She makes sense and is the glue that holds the stories together . The sex scenes, and they are not explicit, contain a lot of noices, but are boring, and except for Cindy and Alan's performance in the woods, none of it even matters.
The Director does amuse a little with some camera effects after Jensen takes some LSD, but those again, get boring and overused.
The performance of Stoltz and Gayheart as FBI agents is a joke. (I just ruined the only twist of the movie.
This was a long 2 hours. I hope Harvard is better than this!",1036972800,7,1383,4.580645161290323
1747875,4,B00006FDGT,"The movie starts off, with Alan Jensen ( Adrian Grenier )and
Cindy Bandolini ( Sara Michelle Gellar ) having moaning sex before a havard basketball game. Cindy is a cheerleader and
Alan is a harvard baketball player. Alan is moving quickly with his love life, juggling to different girlfriends, Cindy Bandolini
and Chesney Cort ( Joey Lauren Adams ). One day when Alan and Cindy are having a drink in a bar, Alan hears that a tornado
hit where his parents live, He immediatly hops a plane to his parents and find out that they need $ 100,000 to rebuild there ruined home. Alan, worried about his parents finds out that Cindy's father, Andrew Bandolini ( Gianni Russu ) is a local mofia man , and desperatly asks him to borrow the money for his parents. Andrew says yes as long as he misses a couple of games
and sheds some points. On the way back Cindy and Alan
have sex yet again , and that is the plot. After that Alan
get in trouble every minute of the movie, with the FBI , mafia
and 3/4 through the movie evens takes an overdose of old fasioned
acid, or LCD. The director, James Toback did a great job on the LCD scenes , making peoples faces mush round in circles, after a while it makes you feel like your on LCD. Sara michelle gellar
was facinating as ever, Adrian Grenier did a great job in the acid seens, and Joey Lauren Adams was good to. I know alot of people have said this is an awful movie, who gives a crap what they say, who gives a crap what i'm saying, Only you can decide , so just rent the movie when it comes out and watch it, if you hate it then return it , just don't watch it because someone else said not too , screw them, see it for yourself.",1034899200,2,1670,4.173374613003096
1747876,1,B00006FDGT,"First of all let me say one thing: DON'T BUY! RENT! DON'T BUY! It's a waste of money. I am from Germany, and they already released the DVD here - when I spotted it in the store, I just HAD to buy it - I mean , SMG, right? Boy, was I disappointed. Alan Jensen (Adrian Grenier) is the Star of Harvard's basketball Team, has good sex with his mafia-girlfriend Cindy and his Philosophy Teacher and he's always on drugs. After a hurricane destroys his parents home, he borrows [$$$] from Cindy's father, a Mafia boss. Being that, it's not easy for him to fulfill his part of the deal...
The story is confusing and without any real sense, and watching Alan Jensen (Adrian Grenier) being on an overdose LSD trip makes you feel you're on LSD,too! It's also filled with stupid and misplaced sex-scenes,that even made SMG look like an amateur. Even if I'm sounding redundant, the story has no plot. I did not experience a part of the movie where I went ""Oh, that's cool"". I had a hard time watching this movie, in fact, it took me 2 days, because I couldn't stand Alan on his LSD trip. The only mentionable thing is that Adrian Grenier did a really good job - so did Sarah , i guess, if the movie wouldn't suck so bad. So, if you wanna be smart, then save your money for something else, but don't buy this one - it's only worth it if you've always wanted to hear Sarah Michelle Gellar moan like there's no end in sight.-
