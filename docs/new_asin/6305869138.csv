1083426,4,6305869138,"IL ROSSO SEGNO DELLA FOLLIA(Hatchet for the Honeymoon) is laced with interesting and creative touches, but Bava discharges most of the narrative in an off-handed, almost thoughtless fashion, suggesting that he had little faith in the project. Whereas SEI DONNE PER L'ASSASSINO manages to creat a genuinely disturbing atmosphere, this film is constantly undermined by a cluttered, muddled narrative. In Bava's best work, psychological motivation is not terribly important (the main motivation is greed), but by relying on the old ""twisted mamma's boy"" motif, the film often seems like an imitation of PSYCHO. In a brief, almost tossed-off line of dialogue Bava (intentionally or not) sums up this major weakness. While interrogating Harrington, Inspector Russell remarks: ""I can accept any crime as long as I can understand the human impulse which motivated it."" Paradoxically, IL ROSSO provides too much explanation for the bloodshed. For Harrington, violence takes the place of sex. The fact that he is impotent is slyly alluded to in the dialogue. For example, Mildred refers to her first, deceased husband by saying, ""At least while he was alive, he was a man. But you. . . How easily one can be fooled by appearances."" Harrington's overwhelming desire to find out the truth about himself (ironically, the one thing that would probably cure his sexual inadequacy) compels him to channel his energies into violence, and it is in this medium that he finds satisfaction. Early in the film, Harrington locks himself away in his private study. After examining the carefully made up mannequins that adorn the room, he goes over to his desk drawer and withdraws the butcher's cleaver with which he murders his victims, and proceeds to stroke it in an almost sexual fashion. The implications of this scene are subtle, but very clear. The cleaver, which penetrates the bodies of his female victims, serves as a Freudian phallic symbol. The act of ""stroking the cleaver"" therefore becomes a form of masturbation. As a prototypical macho man, Harrington has no problem in overwhelming his victims with his ""sexual"" prowess, but in Helen he meets his match. It is Helen who knocks the cleaver out of his hand, rendering him helpless. Without wanting to stretch the point too far, this act of severing the phallic weapon from the murderer's hand has a slight under-tone of castration. For the very first time in the film, Harrington's air of smug self-assuredness crumbles when Helen counters his attack; he is reduced to tears. The links between sexual images (the fashion salon, Harrington's pretty-boy demeanor, the immaculate way his victims need to be dressed in order to ""excite him""), the sexual act itself, and violence are therefore very clearly worked out for the observant viewer, though the somewhat heavy-handed Freudian approach of Santiago Moncada's screenplay hamper Bava's efforts.  Bava's favored theme of surface appearance vs. reality is very much on display in this film. Like Massimo and Christina in SEI DONNE PER L'ASSASSINO, Harrington owns a fashion business, establishing a witty tie to bava's first fully developed giallo, while at the same time confirming the director's mistrust of ""beauty"" in its ideal, almost pornographic form. Harrington is a literal fashion peddler. Not only does he sell chci wedding apparel at his salon, but his style of dress suggests a marketing tactic of a different kind. He is a kind of gigolo, selling himself to the female public in order to find ""willing"" victims. Apart from enabling him to carry on with his sanguinary activities, this also serves to satisfy his inflated ego. This idea extends even further witht he revelation that Harrington cannot ""function"" without the presence of a wedding gown. In this case the image -- the surface gloss -- serves as a catalyst for violence.  In the end, this cannot be considered one of Bava's more accomplished works. Though there is plenty to praise in the film, IL ROSSO SEGNO DELLA FOLLIA simply lacks the impact of Bava at his best. It is momentarily eye-catching -- espcially for experienced Bava-philes who can recognize the director's ""handwriting"" -- but the viewer leaves it feeling empty; the expected connection between the film (or narrative) and the audience simply is not there.

1083427,4,6305869138,"There are naturally two possible ways to apprehend italian director Mario Bava's 1969 HATCHET FOR THE HONEYMOON. If you consider cinema only as a saturday night distraction or as Michal Bay's private territory, this movie is not for you. Firstly, the movie is an old movie. In colour yes but the Image DVD is deceiving, the master hasn't been cleaned at all. Then, not ONE of the special effects has been treated by computer. The actors are dressed in strange green, yellow or sky-blue clothes, they look as if they had popped out of a 1970 movie. In short, HATCHET FOR THE HONEYMOON is not in.
On the contrary, if you have a curious mind, if Hollywood hasn't succeeded with you in its global attempt to suppress every ounce of intellectual rebellion among the movie audience, Mario Bava's film will certainly have a very special place on the shelves of your library. You will be delighted to discover Laura Betti - the intellectual actress by excellence - as Mildred Harrington, the wife of John Harrington, HATCHET FOR THE HONEYMOON's hero and madman, played by the canadian actor John Forsythe. John Harrington is mad and is not afraid to admit it during the first three  minutes of the movie. So, the film is not an authentic ""giallo"" after all.
Is the movie a psychological thriller -  la Hitchcock - with his main character dressed as a wedding bride and running after his wife with a hatchet in the hand ? Or is HATCHET FOR THE HONEYMOON an homage to Edgar Allan Poe's strange novelettes with its ghost invisible for the hero but visible for the other characters ?
Who cares if it's impossible to classify this movie ? The important is that the images of HATCHET OF THE HONEYMOON will provide you 90 minutes of sheer cinematographical entertainment. They will remind you that cinema is not only a matter of over US$ 50 millions budget. Mario Bava often directed his movies with peanuts, his actors weren't paid a lot if they ever get paid but the result is outstanding.
A movie which is not seen is a dead movie. So buy this one.",986601600,,2036,4.621546961325967
1083428,2,6305869138,"I'm a newbie to the world of Mario Bava, but having already seen ""Black Sunday"" and ""Black Sabbath,"" both of which I enjoyed immensly, I found this film nowhere near the same level. To me, this film is hopelessly dated, and overall it's poorly conceived and executed. Whereas ""Sabbath"" and ""Sunday"" have aged well, this one resembles a bad '70s TV movie. Everything about it looks and sounds cheesy, most notably the whiny sound effects, the jarring sound track, sloppy editing, and Bava's goofy overuse of the zoom lens. While the story here could have been interesting, the execution suffers to the point that it greatly detracts from the film. I mean, why would the killer's wife not divorce him? She's the one with the money, she despises him and chides him for being worthless, yet she tells him she'll never give him the divorce he wants. Seems like she'd be the one wanting the divorce! This is important because this is the plot device that ultimately drives the story, yet it's so logically flawed that it gets the whole affair off on the wrong foot.
Also, the killings are so tame they are unrealistic. In one scene, the killer is butchering his wife with a cleaver and is interrupted by the nosey detective at the front door. The killer then answers the door and there's no blood on him or anything! I would think if you had just hacked somebody with a cleaver there'd be blood just about everywhere!
So, while there are some cool aspects to this movie, overall it's a klunker and only recommended for fans looking to see all of Bava's work.",985737600,,1552,4.6268115942028984
1083429,4,6305869138,"A unique blend of giallo and ghost story/tale of madness, Hatchet for the  Honeymoon is quite an entertaining trifle.  The plotting is careless, what  with the police inspector showing up at just the right moment at least  three times too many, but Mario Bava's many visual and editing flourishes  are so clever they're downright witty.  I particularly like the way the  psycho, John Herrington, literally puts his wife at a distance by looking  at her through the wrong end of his binoculars while she harangues him.  Also wonderful is a transition where the camera pans across a line of  mannequin heads that seem to float against the black background of a  darkened room. The camera stops at the final head, which we realize with a  start is Herrington, and we hear a woman's voice speaking. There's a  momentary sense of dizzying disorientation before the camera suddenly  continues its pan and we see the woman speaking and realize that we're in a  different scene now. There's also a bit worthy of Hitchcock at his best  involving a single drop of blood poised to drop from a dead woman's hand  that threatens to expose Herrington while he's being questioned by the  police. The picture and sound quality of the DVD is not in the same league  as other movies in the Bava Collection such as Black Sunday or Black  Sabbath, but it's safe to assume that Image did the best they could with  the best source material they could find. Overall, perhaps not among Bava's  very best films, but still more than worthwhile for those who appreciate  imaginative, well-crafted filmmaking.",969321600,11,1581,4.817164179104478
1083430,4,6305869138,"Bava's intriguing and original twist on the Italian giallo (a genre he had pretty much invented with Evil Eye and Blood and Black Lace) with an  empathic view towards the killer (who is never hidden like in other  thrillers but revealled right at the start).  However, this is not a  harrowing portrait of perversity like Henry:Portrait of a Serial Killer or  even Psycho.  Bava's colourful compositions and beautiful cinematography  give the proceedings a decidedly playful appeal - and his surreal  flashbacks whenever the killer strikes avoids the use of on-screen gore.  His use of voice-overs in the opening is inspired, as our 'hero' ponders  his madness, what drives him to kill, etc.  All this is delivered with a  suitible ironic european flavour that non-Bava fans may be rather baffled  by.
It's a shame that 'Hatchet' didn't receive the sort of dvd treatment  'Black Sunday' or 'Lisa & the Devil' got from Image, but it's a solid  addition to any collection of Bava's work or fans of early Italian horror.  The image quality looks reasonable enough, but the sound quality is rather  distracting, although perfectly audible.  Of course there aren't any  extras.",967334400,5,1172,5.041884816753926
1083431,3,6305869138,"Bava's ""Hatchet"" is not one of his better films, but it is definitely entertaining and worth a look for fans.  Actually, I enjoyed the film more now than when I first saw it years ago so it's aged pretty  well.  A cross-dressing maniac is dispatching young brides one by  one....what is the secret from his past that makes him want to murder all  these young lovelies on their wedding nights?  It's a fun giallo with  a neat twist regarding his ugly wife returning from the dead to haunt him.  The DVD from Image is a very basic package....no trailer this time, just  a small poster-photo gallery and the always excellent liner notes by Video  Watchdog's Tim Lucas.  The film itself looks better than previous VHS  releases,  but the colors are not as sharp as they once were and there are  some blemishes to the print materials used.  Still, it's overall a nice  presentation and worth the $$$$.",964483200,3,896,4.611464968152866

1083485,4,6305869138,"I've seen most of Bava's horror outings and the more I rewatch them, the more entertaining they become. They all have the same mix of interesting photography, stylish decor, and beautiful people confronted with murder or supernatural mayhem. They also contain deep wells of black humor (not necessarily camp, but sometimes present) that might not initially sink in on first viewing. That's why this one has grown on me. It offers up an almost Anti-Patrick Bateman - a handsome narcissistic playboy psycho presented as a an almost emasculated, pathetic flop. His sad attempts to rid his life of the spectral presence of his overbearing, ball-busting wife was a great plot development. The movie is gratifying by seeing the killer so tormented. He's in hell before he even gets there!",1387324800,,782,5.069767441860465
1083486,5,6305869138,"Mario Bava's HATCHET FOR THE HONEYMOON opens w/ a bloody double murder of a newlywed couple on a train. we are introduced to the killer, John Harrington, who tells us that he's a paranoid murderer, a madman in fact. John is a dashing young fashion-designer, specializing in bridal attire. He's also every bit as insane as he says he is! He likes to visit his mannequin-bride collection in their special room. He REALLY likes these mannequins! This room is where he keeps his meat-cleaver (there is no hatchet in this film). It's where he most likes to take his victims. Oh, and John enjoys puttering around in his hothouse, where several of his victims are used as human fertilizer. John's wife is almost as batty as he is, and she's very involved w/ spiritualism and channeling dead people. Her name is Mildred, and she's insufferable! She's also rich, and John loves her money. He finally gains enough courage to give Mildred the cleaver treatment, only to be haunted by her shrewish ghost, or is it just his insane imagination? HONEYMOON is full of absurd situations and hilariously crazy dialogue! It's also loads of fun to watch! Just wait until you see John in his veil and lipstick!

1083487,4,6305869138,"[Hatchet For The Honeymoon - 1969 - Widescreen - English - 88 minutes] The HD blu ray treatment of this film is certainly worth the upgrade for all Mario Bava aficianados - the picture quality is superb, the colors rich and vibrant, the contrast uncanny for a film this old. Over and over again while I was watching I had to remark to myself how gorgeous it was, unlike a lot of other blu ray flicks I 'upgraded' lately. The audio, however, is a slightly different story - it appears that with each new reel of film, there's an abundance of snap, crackle, and popping and some hiss for around 20 seconds before it clears up. After that, it's fine. A minor distraction, but worth the trade for the video brilliance offered.

Not technically a gaillo, due to the fact that we know the killer's identity within three minutes as he gives an internal monologue declaring his psychological dilemma and love for killing women, this is still Bava working full throttle, though not necessarily paving new roads with this film. It's very different from his 'Bay of Blood', from the following year which, along with Sergio Martino's 'Torso', ushered in the slasher film about six years before John  Carpenter's 'Halloween'. This is more like his other 60's film's, psychological horror without the gothic feel, yet the goth elements are evident everywhere - the lead's wife is a spiritualist, the elaborate castle manor they live in, the creepy mannequins that dreadfully dominate and dictate his desire to kill, and the childhood murder that haunts him currently, puzzle pieces of which he still can't come to grips with all play out with elaborate visual splendor, as Bava also plays cinematographer as well as director.

Stephen Forsyth is excellent as the stylish, good-looking psychopath married to a shrew of a woman (Laura Betti) who won't grant him a divorce, as she holds the financial pursestrings, and makes his life more hellish than it already is considering all the emotional baggage he's burdened with. Dagmar Lassander is always a treat to watch, and was popular in around a half-dozen gailli and trailblazing Euro-exploitation films ('The Frightened Woman',  'Forbidden Photos of a Lady Above Suspicion' and 'Black Emmanuelle' come to mind), and there are a few other comely Eurobabes to keep your attention riveted to the sumptuous visuals as Bava does his thing, which is, for me, always fascinating to watch. And the cat-and-mouse game with the police inspector (Jesus Puente) adds to the fun, though we've seen it done before, by both Bava and his contemporaries. Of which he had few.

Another entertaining example of a genre created by this master of the macabre, 'Hatchet' may be slight on gruesome gore and arterial bloodspatter, but is a classic example of the 'less is more' old-school psychological horror prevalent back in the 60's. Bava would turn this genre around and reinvent it again with his next adventurous film, but here he plays it safe. Assuming that the serial-killing of new brides and being haunted by a ghost is your idea of safe. 4 stars.",1369785600,4,3071,4.909441233140655
1083488,2,6305869138,"The only good reason to watch this film is to see Stephen Forsyth, one of the most beautiful and breathtaking men God ever did create, play a pscyho.  Other than the regal himbo, this is fairly standard trope.",1367625600,,209,4.5
1083489,4,6305869138,"""Hatchet for the Honeymoon"" tells the story of John Harrington, an outwardly-normal man with recurring nightmares resulting from a childhood trauma - the brutal murder his mother and her second husband on their wedding day. Though it always stops before he finds the identity of the murderer, John learns the dream progresses a bit further each time he murders a bride on her wedding day. Fortunately for John, as owner of Harrington House - a high-end bridal salon - he has access to an unlimited supply of brides to murder! Things go well until he decides to murder his nagging wife. What's more, a police inspector has begun to notice that the murdered brides are usually Harrington House clients.

The movie is not so lurid as it sounds, with the story concentrating on John's relationship with his wife, and the cat and mouse game he plays with the inspector. As with many Bava films, there is a double twist ending.

The Blu-ray is a great improvement over the earlier Image Entertainment DVD, and well worth upgrading for Bava fans. The price is reasonable (about $20 on Amazon) - unlike many genre Blu-rays.",1366416000,,1115,4.802083333333333
1083490,4,6305869138,"This is from Mario Bava's middle period, when his work becomes more ""tongue-in-cheek."" It doesn't have the same level of intensity, or belief, as Black Sunday or Black Sabbath or Whip and the Body or Blood and Black Lace. The plot could have made for a good Giallo thriller but Bava pushes it towards the comic or absurd. What is interesting though is the way Bava - serving as his own cinematographer - experiments with the visuals, including the use (perhaps overuse) of the zoom lens. Some of the visuals are first-rate, and the new DVD/Blu-Ray release does them justice. So too does Tim Lucas who provides his usual excellent audio commentary. Glad to see Bava finally coming out on Blu-Ray! Can't wait to see Bava's color Giallo thrillers get the Blu-Ray treatment they so rightfully deserve. (I only hope that when they are eventually released they come with multiple language/subtitle options. The English dubbed films are usually poorly done and quite distracting.

He is driven to kill brides-to-be, dressing them up in wedding gowns and then killing and incinerating them. Each death brings him closer to remember a repressed childhood memory that he believes to be at the root of his madness. In classic giallo style, this horror film is as much a mystery story as a horror tale. The use of lighting and sound effects to accomplish the transformation as John slips in and out of madness is expertly done, and gives us the feeling of being inside his squirming brain. Dagmar Lassander is excellent as his nagging older wife, who suspects him, but is too in love with him to give him up, creating a palpable tension. Wild sets and tense scenes with the police as they play cat-and-mouse with John complete the picture.

1083492,4,6305869138,"First of all, Hatchet for the Honeymoon is not going to scare anyone who is into horror films. Its value is classic camp. The film will not make you scream out of fear, but it is screamingly good fun.

Hatchet for the Honeymoon (1969) is a Mario Bava film starring Stephen Forsyth as John Harrington, or John Harrington as Stephen Forsyth. The names are interchangeable, no? The European hero is preposterously handsome: huge eyelashes, a pile of curvaceous black hair, and a closet full of ascots.

As I watched our suave Euro-dude showering and shaving while describing his habit of killing young women, I had to wonder if Bret Easton Ellis ever saw this film before he wrote American Psycho. Whether he did or not, the narration-by-perfect-yet-certifiable-stud routine is not as original as I once believed:

""No one suspects that I am a madman, a dangerous murderer!""

Not simply a murderer, but a dangerous one.

Later on, Euro-dude trades snotty quips with his angry German wife over breakfast on their fancy terrace. He notices the morning newspaper headline, and says mournfully:

""How sad--another bride killed!""

Yes, if you check out this film, be warned: Brides will die. That's because our hero runs a bridal shop, so he gets first dibs on all the pretty brides-to-be who need killing. Please note: Euro-dude does not call it a bridal shop; he refers to it as ""the fashion business"" he inherited from his mommy.

This film has so many things to recommend it. I don't know where to start. So I'll just sling it out there:

* jittery camera movement
* dubbing that is either genius or begs for a new translation of the original
* a soundtrack ranging from music box twinkle to shrieking death-a-coming warnings
* saturated late 1960s colors (dig the groovy deep purple/screaming yellow combo)
* actors who snarl, stare, and fume as if they were in a silent movie (which, given the sound quality, they might as well be)

The visual quality depends on how crazy you are. At one point Euro-dude describes a flat-chested model as ""37-22-37."" Or maybe he was thinking of the combination to his office safe. It's hard to tell, since he's nuts.

After correcting this estimate of her figure--he got the waist wrong by half an inch--the flat-chested woman tells him she's modeled a few wedding dresses in her career. He lets her know she'll have to model them ""constantly"" if she's hired, because she might not have noticed she's applying for a job at a bridal shop--sorry, Euro-dude--""fashion business."" Then he says she'll have to model pajamas and ""land-jury."" In other words: ""Everything a bride might use on her wedding day.""

So forget that travel outfit and toss the extra suitcase in the river, girls. All you're going to need is a wedding gown, jammies (he doesn't say what kind, so I guess flannel's okay) and ""land-jury.""

The killing method involves mannequins and bad dancing. For the rest of the plot, you will have to rent this beauty. Let me just say: When a scene about toast cracks me up so bad I have to hit the pause button, I'm giving the whole movie four stars.

But I'm still not doing justice to Hatchet for the Honeymoon...

When our hero decides to stop messing around with models and focus his considerable craziness on his wife, the story gets much deeper and weirder. In this mid-section of the film Bava's camera work achieves the level of high art. Some of the imagery is stunning and unforgettable. The wife, a dedicated spiritualist, has her own special way of fighting back which is eerie and chilling.

Oh, and there's a suave Euro-cop who doesn't like our hero. When he shows up to investigate the disappearance of a Harrington model, he struts his smooth style and his jurisdiction by saying to 37-22-37:

""There ought to be a law against pretty models going away without leaving a forwarding address.""

Yeah. There ought to be a law.",1258243200,,3874,4.765321375186846

  As with all of Mario Bava's movies, ""Hatchet for the Honeymoon"" is beautifully filmed with his trademark use of bright reds and blues.  It has a dreamlike, hallucinatory effect on the viewer.  This film is not a giallo, as some claim, but a gothic ghost story that is set in the swinging, ""groovy"" sixties.  It is entertaining, but is not one of my favorite Bava movies.  It is not as suspenseful as Bava's other gothic horror films such as ""Kill, Baby . . .Kill,"" ""Black Sunday,"" or ""Baron Blood.""

Although we may call ""Hatchet..."" one of the first maniac movies because there were few pictures at that time to explore the mind of a serial killer, this film also tries to be what it's not. It tries to be a slasher, a detective-story, all-in-one. Hence it gets too puzzle-headed to my opinion.

I wouldn't call it a bad movie, it was rather fresh and innovative for its time but now it just looks a little faded. More to it Mario Bava had much better pictures - ""Blood and Black Lace"" for example. So if you're a big fan of Bava or giallo in general don't hesitate to buy it.

1083536,5,6305869138,"Italian director Mario Bava (1914-1980) is one of the giants of the horror film genre. His films, no matter what the plot, always promised great style mixed with scenes of murder and mayhem. Bava's big break into the industry came with his 1960 black and white classic ""Black Sunday"" starring fan favorite Barbara Steele. This was only the beginning, as Bava churned out a series of gruesome shockers over the next seventeen years. Perhaps Mario's biggest contribution to the horror field was his 1972 picture ""Twitch of the Death Nerve,"" also known as ""Bay of Blood."" It doesn't take too long to realize ""Friday the 13th"" shamelessly cribbed from Bava's bloodbath. The director's inventiveness goes far beyond hacking up a few unfortunate souls, however, as ""Hatchet for the Honeymoon"" shows. This is a relatively bloodless movie that attempts to rework the always entertaining Italian giallo formula, a movie that is a wildly inventive jaunt into the inner recesses of a mind twisted by insanity. Mario Bava is no longer with us, much to my regret, but the Bava legacy continues with son Lamberto, one of the guiding lights behind ""Demons,"" an instant cult favorite with gorehounds worldwide.

I've seen quite a few Bava films at this point, and I have to say I think ""Hatchet for the Honeymoon"" one of his best. It's the story of John Harrington (Stephen Forsyth), a successful designer of female wedding apparel who suffers from two big problems. First, Harrington himself is the first to admit he's completely insane. An incident in his childhood involving a shadowy memory of echoing footsteps on a staircase and the gruesome murder of his mother haunts him. In order to discover the identity of the culprit behind this infernal crime Harrington decides he must murder woman with a small hatchet, a rather unpleasant situation all around. Each murder uncovers a bit more of the memory, and as Harrington ups his body count he comes closer and closer to revealing the identity of the person who took his mother's life. Second, and probably the biggest immediate problem, is his wife Mildred (Laura Betti). Theirs is a loveless marriage held together by Mildred's threats to leave and take her money with her, money that revived John's faltering business. Mildred also suspects John of infidelity, although she doesn't know anything about his true motivations for picking up women.

How crazy is John Harrington? Quite crazy. Every time he dispatches a victim, Inspector Russell (Jesus Puente) shows up at the house to ask a lot of pointed questions. It becomes clear rather quickly that this cop knows Harrington is behind the disappearances, but can't do anything for a lack a proof. But the good inspector doesn't necessarily have anything to do with Harrington's increasing insanity. What really sends our man over the edge, what really makes us aware of how far gone this guy really is, occurs when he decides he can no longer abide the presence of his wife Mildred. In a chilling scene that will probably stay with me long after the rest of the film fades away, John dons a wedding veil, along with some lipstick, and chases his dearly beloved down with the aforementioned hatchet. And wouldn't you know it? Russell happens to show up right after the conclusion of the dastardly deed. Harrington escapes through mere luck only to discover his crime has the sort of lasting consequences he never intended. And as John pursues his final victim, model Helen Wood (Dagmar Lassander), he finally learns whose footsteps he heard padding up that staircase, and who it was that killed his mother.

I absolutely adored ""Hatchet for the Honeymoon."" Everything worked like a charm to create a truly creepy, atmospheric horror film. Stephen Forsyth is great as the massively unhinged Harrington. Here's a guy who is a successful, good looking, cultured chap on the surface, but inside he's gone stark raving mad. It's to the actor's credit that he manages to convey all of these divergent traits at the same time. What really makes the film a winner is the style. Bava effectively uses flashbacks, lighting, camera tricks, and set pieces to craft a truly frightening film. The somber environment of Harrington's house, replete with a special little room full of mannequins wearing wedding gowns, serves as the centerpiece for most of the unfolding madness. Those flashbacks, with the booming footsteps and screaming woman, send chills down your spine even as you figure out exactly what happened to Harrington's mother long before the final denouement. The best stylistic element of the film is the clangy, driving score. It's haunting and creepy without going over the top. Bava fortunately doesn't overuse his background music, something that I cannot say for many of the other Italian horror masters.

Sadly, the mediocre picture and audio quality on the DVD nearly upset the effect of the film. There is no excuse for such a pedestrian transfer to disc; I know for a fact there are thousands of Bava fans out there that would willingly pay good money for a better quality DVD. The shoddy treatment afforded ""Hatchet for the Honeymoon"" recalls unpleasant memories of the audio problems on ""The Twitch of the Death Nerve"" disc, although it is unfair to say this DVD is as bad as that one. Extras on this disc include stills and a Mario Bava biography and filmography. ""Hatchet for the Honeymoon"" is now my favorite Bava film, and that's saying a lot. I hope a decent DVD arrives in the near future. If you want to explore the world of Bava, this is a great place to start.",1096588800,2,5572,4.91817215727949
1083537,4,6305869138,"Mario Bava's Hatchet For The Honeymoon tells the story of a unhappily married, very disturbed, young wedding dress & lingerie designer with a ""killer"" Oedipus complex, not to mention a MAJOR SEXUAL fetish for women mannequins, wearing wedding veils, & hacking up young brides with a smallish meat cleaver. Let alone his passion for his toy train set & his boyhood bedroom, untouched all these years.
The young man is COMPELLED to keep killing so that he may recollect what terrible and horrible things happened to him while a young boy.  Great flashback scenes while the main character is a tad stuck in his childhood throughout the movie.  That is precisely WHY you feel compassion for the killer.
The BEST part of this film isn't really the plot nor the acting although they are fine and stand on their individual merits alone.  However, it is the directing & cinematograpy that really stands out in this gem!  The movie is highly vivid and shot in a beautiful, fluid, cinematic style while systematically building the eventual outcome and great ending of the film.
If you like Bava's work or just like Italian horror in general, you will be pleased with this film. Happy Watching!",1083456000,2,1183,4.841584158415841

1083539,4,6305869138,"The incredible atmosphere!  The music!  The exquisitely beautiful European actress!  Yes, this delectable little giallo film comes from the grand master of the art, director Mario Bava.  Hatchet For the Honeymoon may not be Bava's best film, but it is definitely worth watching.  You just won't find movies like this made in America; European films such as this just have a look and feel all their own, and I for one can't get enough of it.  Unhappy with the problems a big budget brought to his previous film, Bava went out and made this relatively low-budget giallo gem of a film.  You won't see any blood and gore here, as the killings take place off-camera for the most part, but you will get a double whammy of good old insanity and the always-welcome ghost.
John Harrington (Stephen Forsyth) has some issues; he freely admits in the opening narration that he is quite mad.  His favorite hobby is killing brides on their wedding nights, but of course no one suspects that he is anything other than perfectly sane.  Even after a certain policeman starts insinuating himself into his life, Harrington plays it pretty cool.  The fact that many of the dead brides were killed in dresses Harrington designed and sold does seem a little suspicious to the cops, of course.  As for why Harrington feels compelled to murder young brides, the source of the problem goes back to his childhood and a painful memory he has blocked out of his mind; each time he kills, he gets a little closer to finding out the truth locked inside his brain.  You do have to feel sorry for the poor fellow in a way because he is trapped in a loveless marriage with a vindictive battle axe of a woman who refuses to divorce him; his wife Mildred (Laura Betti) insists that she will always be there by his side, and she really does mean it.  Dagmar Lassander makes a great film even better, helping us get inside the mind of a madman while simultaneously allowing us to bask in the glory of her beauty.  The movie sort of reshapes itself halfway through, stepping things up a notch to an even more enjoyable level, and the ending, while not exactly unpredictable, is pulled off very well.
I don't know what it is about Bava films, but I love everything about them.  The distinctive music is just addictive to my ears, and Bava knows how to shoot scenes in the most interesting ways possible.  There are some wondrous transitions between scenes, all sorts of awkward and slightly disturbing camera angles, and even the special effects, what few there are, come out feeling just right.  Hatchet For the Honeymoon is basically a psychological film taking us into the disturbed mind of a madman; Harrington could be any man you see walking the street, a rabid wolf in sheep's (or in one case a bride's) clothing.  Honestly, Bava was a genius; you could take away all of the dialogue in the film yet still follow events fairly closely thanks to some solid acting performances, the superb cinematography, and that ever-so-important music.  If you are curious about giallo or European horror in general, this film makes for a great introduction to the genre.",1072656000,,3124,4.688644688644689

1083541,2,6305869138,"As always, my review is based on the QUALITY of the DVD.
I appreciate Image Entertainment giving us the opportunity to view ""Hatchet for the Honeymoon"" and another work of Mario Bava to observe.  It is remarkable that we have this new entertainment medium and that we can enjoy these films from so long ago.  But -- this DVD is the worst one that I own.  The picture is lousy and the sound is awful.  You get the 1.66:1 screen ratio, but that wouldn't be so bad if the picture was CLEAR.  I'm not sure if this was released prematurely.  Just take into consideration my review of picture + sound to make your decision if you really want to buy this.  In addition, it comes in a snap-case although there are some notes within.
Volume is at an all-time low.  I had to crank up my speaker and software volume to the maximum and still had trouble hearing the dialogue.  You could not possibly eat potato chips and listen to this at the same time!
The movie itself is pretty good, perhaps worthy of three stars.  Some good points:  a nice, recurring love/fantasy theme music or melody.  Perhaps the love theme is derived from the bridal costumes and weddings.  Parts of the movie are quite haunting.  There are no luscious beauties here at all found in other Bava films; the women are rather plain with the exception of what appears to be one beautiful, tall Black woman walking by (quick) and an extremely nice, long pair of legs close-up.
While the theme music is pleasant, there are nauseating guitar sequences during action shots.  Horror buffs and people who crave gore will not find either in this movie.  Own this only if you are serious about building a Mario Bava collection (I am).",1012953600,9,1685,4.529801324503311
1083542,3,6305869138,"This film has a similar mood as a whole compared with Alfred Hitchcock&iexcl;s &iexcl;Psycho&iexcl;. First of all, main character of this film, John, he commits murder because he cannot get out of his wife&iexcl;s spirit. In this film, when John commits murder, he always wears a wedding dress. It is similar to &iexcl;Psycho&iexcl;, when murderer commits murder, he wear a mother&iexcl;s cloth. Anyway, two of murderer is not normal they have an abnormal mentality. Most of thriller movies like these, usually as if these characters appear. Whatever the reason, the mood of this film is excellent. It is supposed to be a film with good background music and mood.

Its about a wealthy fashion designer who feels he must commit murder to regain a supressed memory of who killed his mother on her wedding night.  Bava also bings some style into the mix(the 1st murder, the victim's face reflected in the hatchet blade, and the persistant ghost).  However, being that Hatchet is baddly dated, a predictable ending, and slow first half really mar interest for one of Bava's more underrated works.

7896381,3,6305869138,"Probably not the best Bava film, the flavor of it reminds me of ""Blood and Black Lace, Kill Baby Kill,"" and ""The Whip and the Body"". There's a satirical element to the film, which will remind many of ""American Psycho"". John Harrington owns a fashion house, and is tormented by his estranged, cold wife. He also witnessed the murder of his mother as a child and relives it by killing brides to make sense as to who was responsible, and he is playing cat and mouse with a detective who suspects him, but can't find the evidence to capture him. Stephen Forsyth manages to be tormented, yet cold and detached for most of the film. There's a few nice touches, a ghost that everyone else can see by John. As well as a sequence where John is watching a horror film in TV. Bava's own ""Black Sabbath"". This features many of the obsessions seen in other Bava films, and does riff off of the same themes in Hitchcock's ""Psycho"". Bave's cinema photography remains stellar as always.
