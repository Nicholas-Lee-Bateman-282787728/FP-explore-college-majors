1283316,5,B00003CXT7,"Actually this is not particular a girls movie. This movie really makes fun of the main character Bridget. But because she is made fun of it is also a movie for guys. It is more of a girl movie because probably a lot of girls have the same situations as Bridget. I know I do.
The movie is really about struggling to find yourself.
Why I love this movie so much is because I really think that Renee has done a good job. It's a real fun movie. I even laughed at bits nobody else laughed at. I have seen this movie three times in the first week that it opened in our country.
I am definitely going to buy the DVD when it's out !!
This is a SEE/ WANNA BUY movie.",999993600,,657,3.9473684210526314

1283318,4,B00003CXT7,"""Bridget Jones's Diary"" is much more than a chick flick.  This movie has all the makings of the funniest of funnies- it combines comic situations with mature (and not-so-mature) humor, but also takes a more serious tone.
What makes this movie much more than it seems is that it is a modern day Pride and Prejudice.  The central characters all line up to Austen's- the plot is very similar, if not exact.  Helen Fielding cleverly makes this movie about womens' issues enjoyable even for men.  See this movie with a date, or by yourself for a good, hardy laugh.",999561600,,559,4.616161616161616
1283319,4,B00003CXT7,"I did not read the novel before seeing the movie, so I didn't know what to expect. Renee is brilliant! She never loses her English accent--which is saying a lot because she is from Texas! The two leading men portrayed in this movie remind me of leading men in The Philadelphia Story, two men competing for one woman's affections. This is a classic love story set in the new millenium. You really feel for these characters and wish for more long after the credits roll! I could see this movie again and again. There is a lot of humor mixed with real emotions- a must on DVD!",999043200,,573,4.364485981308412

We see here an ordinary person battling weight (sounds familiar?), hanging midway in her 30's, still looking for a good job & to top it all off... still single & looking for Mr. Right. It's a hlarious way to present every woman's (most if not all) fear, especially upon reaching the dreaded 30 stage. This movie reminds all of us female, that we must never lose hope, that we must keep our heads high & eyes straight. Afterall, we have Bridget to remind us that all will be well at the end.",998870400,,583,4.3090909090909095
1283322,3,B00003CXT7,"I am a huge Fan of the Bridget Jones-Books (I especially liked ""The Edge Of Reason) and I love this character! When I read the Books I just could see Rene Zellweger infront my eyes, how she would talk, move and react and she realy DID great work! BUT I was v. disapointed when I saw the Movie. I had an Imagination of every single character and as watched the movie I just couldn't understand who they could have chosen those actors and actresses! I mean Bridget, Mark and Daniel are just perfect but her Mom, her Dad, Jude and Shazzer were just... not right! I mean Shazzer looks like REbecca should look like and that made it very difficult to me to enjoy this movie. But I have to say that the Script is great but I also missed some stuff! It went to quickly for me with to many wholes!

1283323,5,B00003CXT7,"When i first saw this at the cinema back in March I found myself astounded by how well it presented Bridget's somewhat outrageous actions from the book. Helen Fielding has managed to create modern role models for many generations to look to for fun and useless advice, many of whom have been fabulously incorporated into the screenplay.  However, they do have extremely minor roles (Why??).  Colin Firth was fabulous as Mark Darcy and even Hugh Grant betrayed some ability within him to act (Very peculiar for him).  Full credit here goes to Renee though as her superb Bridget is lively as well as incredibly romantically pathetic.  Highly recommended, this is my film of the year if not the best romcom ever. I can't wait until they make a sequel for the diary's follow up, Bridget Jones: the edge of reason. See it ASAP.",997747200,4,822,4.7272727272727275

1283517,4,B00003CXT7,"In structural terms, BRIDGET JONES DIARY doesn't have too much relationship to its source; the diary-form is soon abandoned in favor of the basic romantic comic plot. What the film does have, however, is a winning central performance from Renee Zellweger in the eponymous title role; many of her thoughts are heard in voice-over, and director Sharon Maguire has great fun exploring the distance between such thoughts and what really happens in Bridget's life. In many ways she is an idealist, perpetually in search of the ideal boyfriend but doomed to spend her life with lowlifes and/or cads. As Daniel Cleaver, her boss and one-time lover, Hugh Grant is a perfect example of this latter kind of person, the guy who protests love for Bridget on the one hand while trying his best to exploit her credulity on the other. The film also brings out the story's Austenian echoes; Colin Firth is wonderfully standoffish as Mark Darcy, but he understand his true nature from the way he stares at Bridget, even though he moves scarcely a facial muscle. Proud of his public image as a hotshot lawyer, he finds it difficult, if not impossible to acknowledge his true feelings - at least until the climactic fight sequence with Cleaver. BRIDGET JONES DIARY also contains at least two memorable cameos from Gemma Jones as Bridget's mother - whose antics put her daughter to shame - and Paul Brooke as Mr. Fitzberbert (or Tits Pervert as Bridget calls him), Cleaver's snobbish sidekick. In short, a film that improves with repeated viewings.",1388188800,,1528,4.903474903474904

1283569,3,B00003CXT7,"The late movie for last night was ""Bridgit Jones's Diary"" starring Renee Zellweger, Colin Firth and Huge Grant. I found the movie on our DVD shelves and it must have been there by the action of my separated wife. I have trouble watching sappy romance movies, and she loves them. In any case, Zellweger was the main character (Bridget) and played an unmarried mid-thirties woman who was becoming ever more apprehensive about her situation. Her two off - again, on-again love interests were Hugh Grant (a dork hampered with a dour personality), who she met at one of her mother's social gatherings, and Colin Firth (Mr. Smooth)  who was her supervisor at the office where she worked. Yaawwwnnnn! Neither didn't seem to go very well and neither was convincing. She hated Grant, so Firth turned out to be first in line and all was going well until he was discovered playing around with a high-powered lawyer. Next came Grant. Oh yes, somewhere along the line, in a non-convincing little side plot, her mother gave her father the boot for a seedy on-screen television salesman. Alas, then Grant seemed to have problems with the same lawyer. Ho-hum. Life in London is so complicated.

The movie was well produced and flowed along at a nice rate. The photography and settings were well done. The Acting was fairly good. However, all this just couldn't overcome the dreadful script. I was awaiting the ending after about the first half hour.

1283570,5,B00003CXT7,"If you haven't seen this original and quirky comedy, pop some popcorn, add some melted butter and enjoy a girls' night in.  There's a lot of comedy-romances out there but what makes this one so popular?  I think it's the original character of Bridget herself.  She seems authentic; she's a mess-up.  We can relate because we've done similar stupid things ourselves.  And she really doesn't change from clumsy duckling into beautiful swan in the movie--she's still the gauche duckling but suddenly her gaucheness becomes quite charming. Her authentic self is an asset when she finds a situation that suits her.  This is the original message in the film and why it's so popular, I believe, because it says maybe we're okay, as is, too. We don't have to become perfect to be lovable. We just have to find a place and people who appreciate our unique and original self.

Renee Zellwegger doesn't even seem like she's acting as she's got the role of Bridget down so well.  Hugh Grant plays the cad perfectly and Colin Firth is charming as the cold and arrogant Darcy.  The change in him to the warm and playful Darcy seems a bit abrupt but maybe the aloofness was just a facade.  The tarts and vicar party is one of my favorite scenes. I can watch this movie every year and even the guys in my life seem to like it.  It's fun for a Friday night in.",1337558400,,1343,4.508264462809917

1283573,5,B00003CXT7,"Sharp, witty and charming; `Bridget Jones's Diary' kind of has it all.  Couple that deliciously fun screenplay with one of the best comedic turns of the past decade (yes, I'm looking at you Renee Zellweger) and you have an instant comedy classic.  Yes, the character of Bridget Jones alone is worth the price of admission, but it's what Zellweger does with the character that will keep you hooked.  The film, which is basically a modern retelling of `Pride and Prejudice', centers around an overweight and underloved young woman named Bridget.  Bridget records in her diary her troubles with her weight as well as her troubles with men (ALL BY MYSELF).  Things change when Bridget becomes emotionally torn between the handsome Mark and her boss, Daniel.  Mark is a little distant but wholly more desirable (in the long term) than Daniel, who is a womanizer and is basically using Bridget for one thing.  But, at least Daniel is using her.  The star of the show is undoubtedly Zellweger, who gained quite a bit of weight for the role.  She is shameless, and that is seriously needed to convey such a `complete' character.  This is sadly an underappreciated film that should be appreciated more!",1315872000,,1193,4.861386138613861

1283575,5,B00003CXT7,"I have to say that I was going through a very rough patch with my love life when I first came across this movie. I watched it so many times that I was simply inspired by it. I saw myself through Bridget's eyes - a bit impulsive and getting myself into scrapes - and that was me. So much so that when I finally dumped the creep I was seeing, I came back home (I was living abroad at the time) and I wrote a romantic comedy based on my own story.

To me, Bridget will live on as one of my heroes, even though she doesn't always get it right, but isn't that what being human is all about? And yes, like many women before me, we all fell in love with Colin Firth and we all went on to watch ""Pride and Prejudice"" all over again so we could see the man take off his jacket and jump into a lake, coming out looking very sexy in a wet shirt. Woo hoo!

On a final note, I have to say that I loved the adaptation into film from Helen Fielding's book - which I also read several times. Great story!

1283669,3,B00003CXT7,"RENEE ZELLWEGER plays such a klutzy frump of a girl in this British screwball comedy that it's hard to imagine COLIN FIRTH and HUGH GRANT fighting over her. We're told that it's because she so ""natural"" that she has men buzzing around her. Well, that might be true if Miss Zellweger looked more like Carole Lombard. In fact, one could easily see this as a screwball comedy back in the '30s if Hollywood made the story starring Lombard, Cary Grant (not Colin Firth) and James Stewart (not Hugh Grant). Get my drift? Instead, Miss Zellweger looks more like pudgy Lynn Redgrave of ""Georgy Girl,"" an overweight and rather awkward young woman given to wearing tight clothing and making the most inappropriate remarks at the most crucial moments. She speaks her mind without any regard for the consequences and lands into one troublesome social situation after another because of her quirky attitude.

An inside joke has COLIN FIRTH's character called Mr. Darcy--and indeed, he behaves as that gentleman did in ""Pride and Prejudice,"" at first utterly rejecting Bridget Jones and then making a pass at her which she turns down, only to change her mind before the final reel.

HUGH GRANT has a thankless role as a witless cad but plays it with his usual charm, the sort of role James Stewart might have done had this been made back in Hollywood's Golden Age when screwball comedy was just as mad but a lot less risqu.

But Renee, Colin and Hugh are not Lombard, Grant or Stewart and the film suffers because none of them can make this kind of material seem like anything more than a manipulative romantic comedy about an awkward girl finding her Prince Charming in a Jane Austen kind of way--with all the modern sensibilities destroying most of the charm.

Unless you're a devoted fan of these stars, this one is pretty hard to recommend except as very lightweight entertainment in quirky British style, but Bridget's gaffes are too monumental to be accepted by Darcy.",1222732800,3,1960,4.789940828402367

1283672,4,B00003CXT7,"Many were irked when Rene Zellwiger was chosen to play Bridget Jones, her being an American (let alone a native Texan) when Bridget is an English heroine.  Still, she puts forth a good performance, as so many things are universal.

Bridget Jones is a thirtysomething single woman living in London, struggling with the trials and tribulations a la Woody Allen crossed with Cathy from the comics.  She has to loose that weight, stop drinking so much, quit smoking, and find that intangible Mr. Right.  As opposed to all the shallow, self serving female characters in most chick flicks, we related to Bridget best.  She is sweet, trying her hardest and making efforts, and her bumbling antics make us laugh as much as they make us cry, knowing we have all been there at one point or another.

In a classic Jane Austinesque situation (and one of the male leads just happens to be named Darcy on top of that), Bridget finds herself torn between two men.  On Christmas Day at her mother's annual party, she meets a vain, arrogant, rude man named Mark Darcy who her mother is pushing her into being friendly with.  When she overhears one of his insults, she is bent into thinking what a terrible man she is and is naturally, as Miss Austin would be proud of (no pun intended), prejudiced against him.  At work, she is hot for her boss, a slick, charming skirt played very well by Hugh Grant (when he is usually the lovable good guy in all his roles).  In a moment of weakness, Bridget gets played.  (Who hasn't been there?)  She soon finds out that Hugh Grant is not just a player, but contrary to what she had been lead to believe, he was caught mid coitus with Mark's wife and not vice versa.  In a great scene that we women can only dream about, the two get into a fist fight on the streets over her.

And Mr. Darcy ... He's the perfect man after all.  Even when he finds her diary with all its stabs and slams against him, he goes out and buys her a new one.  He knows he's not perfect and loves Bridget just the way she is.  Isn't that what we all want?  And he even likes those nasty granny panties she wore.",1184716800,4,2107,4.372750642673521

And I thought it absolutely hilarious when the music seemed to interact w/ the characters - just as you think the romance is getting sappy the music comes to a complete and screeching halt.  HA!  I loved it.

Then there is the use of the original ""Mr. Darcy"" that you just love to hate, but then find yourself very amused by his sexual tension.

On a negative note, there was waaaay too much language.  It wasn't necessary because this movie can hold it's own without it.

Bridget Jones is a unique woman, though worthy men seem slow to recognize this rather odd bird's charm. Okay, she smokes and drinks too much and she has a habit of saying what's on her mind before she can edit her remarks. Also, a lot is made of her size. Yet, in her role, she is definitely more attractive and fit than most thirty-something-year-old single female office workers. But it is her spirit, her spunk, and sincerity that makes her attractive enough to realistically have Mark Darcy and Daniel Cleaver fighting over her affections.

'BRIDGET JONE'S DAIRY' HAS A SIMPLE BUT ELEGANT PLOT {plot spoilers below}

Our heroine, Ms. Bridget Jones is a 32-year-old, single, working woman who has just decided it is time to get serious about avoiding becoming a spinster. She's a young woman who smokes, drinks, and eats all seemingly to excess as she returns home for her parents' Christmas party. Upon arrival, she is informed that her mom would like to set her up with a recently-divorced son of one of their long-time neighbors. Yes, Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) is the visiting neighbors' son.

Sadly, Mark not only seems disinterested, but spews numerous insults about Bridget while she is within earshot. Well, she didn't like him anyway, and for the new year she has decided to start a diary and lose weight, maybe. Back at the office, the rejected Bridget falls for the office cad, her boss Daniel Cleaver {Hugh Grant), a wanna-be Romeo who sends her lewd e-mails that lead to a dinner date. Daniel does tell Bridget that he and Mark went to Cambridge together and that Mark had stolen his fianc'e and broke his heart. Of course, Daniel the cad is lying, but that does come out later when it matters. When Bridget then finds Daniel fooling around with an American colleague, she decides a change of scenery is needed and takes a job as a TV reporter on an exploitationist TV show.

At her own birthday party, for which she is cooking and destroying the dinner, Mark shows up again and now expresses his affection for her. Almost simultaneously, cad Daniel pops in and insists he wants Bridget back. Then, out in the street and in a seemingly gay eating establishment, the two fight over who deserves her affections the most. Though Mark was the clear winner, it was not until Bridget learned that Daniel had really stolen Mark's wife and the broken heart was Mark's that Mark and Bridget really connected in a meaningful way. This new info seemed to tip the balance in Mark Darcy's favor. Though there were still to be a few tense Bridget moments, such as when Mark read Bridget's diary and discovered that she had hated him, the two were destined to begin a lasting and meaningful relationship and to live happily ever after, or so we were expecting before they came out with a sequel.",1162425600,,3063,4.704672897196262

1283735,5,B00003CXT7,"This movie will always be a classic for single women because it's a fairly accurate reflection of life for a demographic of women that is growing with our generation. I don't have the statistics, but I don't think there has ever been a time where so many young women have delayed marriage for so long (for whatever reasons) and have high incomes, live alone without roommates, rely on their friends as family, and date so freely. We get to learn about Bridget's life through her diary, in which she is unabashedly honest.

I lived this life when I lived in London, and so much of this movie rang true to my life. Renee Zellweger's accent is spot on, and Bridget is so loveable because she is so open and honest about her flaws. She has the same struggles and fears that we all do - being afraid that she'll die alone and be eaten by dogs because no one will notice, the fact that she needs to wear granny-panties to hide the lumps under her tight dress, but she also shows us that there is MORE to a woman than her romantic relationship status (Bridget writes the same sort of self-improvement lists that my friends and I all did - we would resolve to read intelligent books and magazines, go to museums, eat more vegetables and stop drinking/smoking/partying).

And sometimes, when you're not even looking for it, love pops up at the last place you'd ever expect it.

I hope that someday I have a daughter and can watch this movie with her when she's old enough. Highly recommended.

The script isn't as good as the book, but it fits the essense of the book into two hours, which is about as good as you can do. The cast is amazing from beginning to end. The production is great. The only thing I can complain about is only because I know London - the scenes don't line up - Bridget walks past Picadilly Circus to Tower Bridge on the way to work and magically walks down the block from Southwark to Bank without crossing the river. Oh well. I'm being overly critical.

It's a great movie based on a great story.",1140566400,3,2012,4.412398921832884
1283736,5,B00003CXT7,"As a huge fan of the books, I had incredibly high expectations of the movie. In order for the movie to work for me, it had to capture Bridget's plucky-heroine character and the hilarious-poignant emotions that are in the book. Needless to say, `Bridget Jones's Diary' the movie worked very, very, very well. Although Helen Fielding also wrote the screenplay (w/ Richard Curtis, very skilled with romantic comedies) and keeps the laughs coming, this movie could have fallen flat on its face. But it doesn't because one, the casting is absolutely divine and two, smartly builds on some elements the book downplays.

Renee Zellweger is absolutely perfect as Bridget Jones. She has always been one of my favorite actresses and here, she totally displays Bridget's pathetic cuteness. Zellweger gained weight for this role, too, so she looks adorably plump. It's very, very hard to not fall in love with her the moment you see her at her family's Christmas party or drinking alone at home or listening to sad, Celine Dion music. (You have a heart of stone if you aren't moved to laughs or tears or pity for her.) I can't imagine anyone else playing Bridget Jones. Zellweger fits the role because she is very much normal and approachable...we can relate to her.

As Daniel Cleaver (her caddish Cassanova lover/boss), Hugh Grant is smoldering and hilarious. (Ok, I might be a little biased because I've been in love with him for ages and ages, but you can't deny he is a great comedic actor.) There's no trace of his stuttering that we saw (and I loved) in `Four Weddings and a Funeral' or `Sense and Sensibility.' Grant morphs effortlessly into a cad that we all love to hate and all love to love. Yes, it's a paradox, but that is what Grant brings to his role. He makes being `bad' look so sexy. You can't take your eyes off him; he brings his own humor to his role. It's lovely, smoldering, and incredibly sexy.

Colin Firth is also a delight to watch onscreen as Mark Darcy (I think I might be in love with him, too). He is also sexy and smoldering, but not in the same wild, fiery way as Daniel Cleaver. Firth brings a very cute sweetness to his role. I don't know if it is his adorable face or his hair or the way he dresses or just the fact that he is a major sex symbol, but you can't help but fall in love with him the MOMENT you see him onscreen. There is also one very beautiful moment where he tells Bridget, `I like you very much...just the way you are.' It's incredibly romantic and, for me, ranks right up there with Tom Cruise's `You complete me' in `Jerry Maguire.' He also has rather explosive chemistry with Renee Zellweger, which is moving and sexy all at the same time. (And, of course, the author Helen Fielding used Colin Firth as the basis for Mark Darcy, so it all works out marvelously.)

I also mentioned that the movie smartly builds on some elements that the book downplays. Yes, there are certain parts of the movie that cannot be found in the book, but I'm still glad they put them in the movie. Most of what they added doesn't necessarily build on plot but it does add to the characters. I don't want to give anything away because it's rather hilarious what unfolds onscreen. The movie is filmed in an almost Ally McBeal type of way but it remains true to the sincerity, cuteness, and pathetic naivete that Bridget Jones embodies. There are no pretensions. It's an entirely wonderful film. 10/10",1138924800,2,3419,4.554471544715447
1283737,3,B00003CXT7,"OK, I don't know much about film making, so let's suppose the diary form of the original novel makes it difficult to adapt it exactly the same way on film (even those who don't have much experience on book adaptation movies don't expect that), but surely it can't be as difficult??!!

Let's make it clear for those who've only seen the film: the book is great, witty, funny and hilarious! Its author Helen Fielding was one of the three scriptwriters, so how they managed to come up with such a lousy script between them is beyond me, truly!

The scriptwriters and director managed to damage the concept of the book and Bridget's character. They seem to have completely forgotten the FACT that although she tends to end up in pathetic and embarrassing situations, she is witty, intelligent, honest and warm-hearted! There was nothing wrong with Ren&eacute;e Zellweger as Miss Jones, she was very good, so were all cast members! It wasn't their fault that they couldn't breathe life into the 2dimensional characters they were made to act. And to give Ren&eacute;e even more credit: she even got me to like the dimwitted bimbo they made her play. Shirley Henderson (Jude), Sally Philips (Shazzer) and James Callis (Tom) were all great: it's a shame how minor parts they were given, although they play a major role in Bridget's life.

Despite all the flaws (and there are many) the film is rather enjoyable but even wonderful Colin Firth wasn't enough to send me in a swoon. An extra point, however, is that the deleted scenes (some of them are far more hilarious than anything in the movie!) are included.

Loosely inspired by Pride and Prejudice, but in a way Ms. Austin never intended, what with all the shagging and all, the movie is not exactly like Ms. Fielding's book either.  One of things I liked about the book was the little diary notes, which obviously couldn't be brought out the same way in the movie, and quite a few other side stories had to be scrapped as well, including the entire ending.  Bridget's friends and family have had their parts drastically cut, to make way for a first class compact comedy, focused almost entirely on Bridget, Daniel (loving the beaver) Cleaver, and Mark Darcy.

Never-the-less, like the book, the movie is a laugh out loud affair, with Renee Zellweger accurately capturing the spirit of the awkward and ditsy Bridget, Hugh Grant being the consummate cad, and Colin Firth (sigh) replaying an updated yet still straitlaced Darcy.

Guest appearances by Salman Rushdie and Jeffrey Archer add a little literary support, and the DVD is loaded with features like deleted scenes, comments from the actors and director, as well as from Helen Fielding.

My suggestion would be to read the book first, then watch the movie.

1283800,3,B00003CXT7,"Helen Fielding, author of the Bridget Jones books makes no bones about her admiration for Jane Austen, and the parallels between the characters in Bridget Jones and Pride and Prejudice are clear. This is even more obvious in the respective film adaptations of the works. Colin Firth - sex symbol emerging dripping wet as Mr Darcy from the lake in the BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice returns as - yes, Mark Darcy, hunky human rights lawyer in the Bridget Jones movie. This is a Richard Curtis chick flick rom com with all the trademarks that featured in movies such as Four Weddings and a Funeral - the on/off romance, the stammering reserved Englishman, the desire to find true love, the saccharine ending, the cliched humour, young professionals in London all having far nicer appartments and more free time than they could afford in reality etc. I don't really rate Curtis as a first rate comic writer, but you have to credit his commercial awarness and his comedies do romp home at the box office.

Incidentally, the best part in the film is Hugh Grant who gets all the best lines as caddish, cocky, teasing Daniel Cleaver. The main problem in the film (acknowledged by the producers) is that Daniel Cleaver is obviously the most appealing character - how many girls go for the stuck up boring lawyer over the raffish charmer? Bridget dumping him as he lies bloodied on the ground after a fight scene with Mark Darcy just doesn't convince, she knows which side her bread is buttered on, which gives a considerable lack of realism to the love dynamics in this movie.",1111968000,,1574,4.723636363636364

Have just watched Bridget Jones's Diary for umpteenth time and wondered, ""Does anyone really need yet another Bridget Jones review?"" Well - yes.

Warning: if you are offended by excessive drinking, smoking, profanity, workplace flirting, sexual innuendo, and gratuitous shots of Hugh Grant in wet shirt, you probably will not like this movie.

On the other hand, if you ever have loved wrong man (person), wondered if you would die old and alone (and eventually be eaten by dogs), or walked across London Bridge after night of shagging Hugh Grant look-alike (perhaps not), then you will find this movie v.v. amusing and quite entertaining.

The plot is well known - 30-something singleton Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger) hooks up with caddish boss Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant), whilst finding self increasingly attracted to aloof human rights barrister Mark Darcy (Colin Firth). Mark Darcy is eerily similar in personality and appearance to that other famous Mr. Darcy of Pride and Prejudice. Not a coincidence, as Helen Fielding's novel was based on Pride and Prejudice, and of course both Mr. Darcys are broodily and gorgeously portrayed on-screen by Colin Firth.

Bridget is rather unique among romantic comedy heroines, as she is not thin, has questionable taste in clothing, and has hair which is almost always having a bad day. She is clumsy, often says the wrong thing, and doesn't much like her job. (And she can't cook.) Most women can see a bit of themselves in Bridget, even as they congratulate themselves for having much better hair and clothes.

But Bridget's flaws are not only hilariously funny, they are lovable. We laugh with her, and wouldn't really want her to lose those 20 pounds, or get a better hairstylist, or curb her verbal diarhhea. We love her, just as she is.

This movie is all about Bridget, but there wouldn't be a story without the men in her life. And who wouldn't want to have Colin Firth and Hugh Grant fighting over her? (Colin Firth - wet white shirt in Pride and Prejudice; Hugh Grant - wet white shirt in Bridget Jones's Diary; it's a very tough one to call!) Grant is funny and sexy and v.v. bad as sleazy (yet charming) Daniel Cleaver. Firth is haughty and sexy and v.v. good as repressed (yet smoldering) Mark Darcy (and he makes a mean omelet).

Bridget Jones's Diary is one of the few movies based on a book which not only does justice to the book, but adds to one's enjoyment of it. Zellweger, Firth, and Grant add personality and faces to the characters of Bridget, Mark Darcy, and Daniel Cleaver. Forever more, Renee Zellweger will be the face of Bridget Jones.

1283807,4,B00003CXT7,"If you loved Helen Fielding's novel you will find both similarities and differences in the film version of her story. I have to admit I laughed harder reading the novel than while watching the film but I found the movie endearing in its own right.

Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger) is a bumbling British woman who at the age of 30 or so has decided that she is turning into a spinster. Her friends and family make every effort to find her a mate but only end up embarrassing her more than she is capable of on her own. Jones is secretly in love with her hunky but totally unavailable boss (Hugh Grant) and spends an enormous amount of time trying to get his attention. Along the way she meets a family acquaintance Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) and they play back and forth at a serious stab at a relationship. All the while Jones writes down in a red diary all of the escapades she encounters as well as her obsession with her weight thus leaving a trail of words in her wake that could come back to bite her.

Renee Zellweger has successfully managed to become British for her role as Bridget Jones. Much has been made about her weight in this movie but in reality she is still slimmer than the average American woman even though she is supposed to possess ""enormous underwear"" Zellweger has excellent comic skills and hits this character on the head but unfortunately the director left some of Helen Fielding's funniest written scenes out of this movie. Hugh Grant is perfect as a cad but somehow still lovable. Colin Firth is so appealing as Mark Darcy and the friction between him and Zellweger works as beautifully as a romantic comedy should. Overall this movie is fun and entertaining capturing all of the awkwardness felt by those of us who never quite fit into this world so bent on perfection and leaving us with someone else to laugh at besides ourselves for a change.",1100044800,,1874,4.541420118343195

1283898,4,B00003CXT7,"What really makes this movie stand out from other working girl fantasies is the familiar but one-of-a-kind personality of the irrepressible Bridget Jones. Created by novelist Helen Fielding, who also wrote the script, and brought to life by the talented and zany Rene Zellweger, Bridget Jones is a 32-year-old pleasingly plump London working girl, a ""...verbally incontinent spinster who...dresses like her mother"" (to quote Colin Firth's character, Mark Darcy). She is also clumsy, the kind of girl who might spill sauce on her blouse, a little overweight, smokes, drinks too much and sometimes says what she thinks without consulting her brain. She is also very good at improvising on the spot, a talent that charms not only the two leading men, Hugh Grant and Colin Firth, who vie for her affection, but also the five o'clock news audience who like her bum and knickers just fine.

Director Sharon Maguire, in her first outing, combines Brit witticisms, slapstick pratfalls, raunchy, sharp and realistic dialogue, and a blatant but inoffensive sentimentality into a romantic comedy that surely has Nora Ephron and Meg Ryan paying close attention. She keeps us guessing about who will get the girl (and who really deserves the girl) with the usual misdirections and misunderstandings characteristic of the genre. There's a little dead time about half way in, and the uncertainty about whether Bridget wants Hugh Grant or Colin Firth is milked a bit overmuch, otherwise this is a nicely paced entertainment sure to chase away a blue afternoon.

Hugh Grant and Colin Firth are both very good, and Gemma Jones as Bridget's mother is a charming, dotty sight to see. Bridget's friends are funny as a kind of foil to the tired glamor of Yank TV's ""Friends."" And there's a darling ""home movie"" sequence during the closing credits purporting to recall Bridget at four and Mark Darcy at eight, that retrospectively and adorably frames the movie.

Should a CHICK FLICK ALERT be declared here? No doubt, but thanks to a warm, bubbly, funny and decidedly unprudish and unaffected (and, I must say, somewhat daring) performance by Zellweger, we'll ignore it because we ""like her just the way she is.""",1097452800,4,2189,5.058171745152355
1283899,3,B00003CXT7,"Renee Zellweger stars in this star-chocked movie based on the best-selling novel by Helen Fielding. Zellweger herself is charming enough, and she looks fantastic with a few extra pounds on her. She's not exactly what I envisioned Bridget as-- the moviemakers try to make her homely, with the dishwater blonde hair and chubby face, but she still is the lovely Zellweger no matter how one looks at it. Still, she pulls off an admirable English accent, and she says most of her lines with convincing Bridget Jones charm.

Most of the cast succeeds as well. Hugh Grant is perfect as the slimy, noncommital Daniel Cleaver, and the role of Mark Darcy just had to be played by Colin Firth. Jim Broadbent is delightful as Bridget's father, but Gemma Jones just seems a little too wide-eyed and sweet to portray the frenzied, adulterous Mrs. Jones featured in Hielding's original novel.

It is the script, then, instead of the cast that makes the rest of the movie so utterly disappointing. As a movie itself, it would probably succeed as an amusing chick flick with a considerable amount of eye candy. However, as a movie supposedly based on Helen Fielding's novel, it fails miserably. The character of Bridget is portrayed as a dimwitted, unmotivated moron instead of the absentminded but charming woman in Fielding's book. Though the movie tries to be as funny as the book, it captures none of the beguiling humor of the character of Bridget.

The rest of the film is similar. Though there are most definitely a few incredibly funny one-liners and even some touchingly romantic moments between Bridget and Mark, the movie lacks a certain humor and charm that Fielding's novel became so famous for. Firstly, Bridget's ""urban family"" are given little more than 15 minutes of screen time. While the moments they are onscreen are wonderful, they appear so rarely that it leaves the viewer feeling unfufilled. Worst of all is the fight between Darcy and Daniel Cleaver. The whole scene is an embarassing, ridiculous waste of film time. The gentleman in Darcy that the movie took two hours to develop is suddenly lost in five minutes of animalistic behavior.

The ending is unreasonably silly as well. Though it would have been very boring to have Bridget and Mark just run up to Jones's apartment and leave it at that, the alternate is completely stilted and unnecessary. The fact that the movie squeezes in one last conflict feels awkward to the viewer, especially since there is such a strange solution to the problem. Admittedly, the final kiss between Darcy and Jones stirs a slight feeling of satisfaction, but not enough to make up for the rest of the disappointments.

This movie has its moments, but not enough of them. The parts that are charming are delightful, but everything else makes the viewer want to cringe. As a movie, it might be mediocre to good, but as an adaptation of the book, it's a major disappointment.",1093651200,3,2918,4.85140562248996

All Renee Z. had was her usual chubby cheeks, and maybe slightly heavier upper arms -- and that's ALL.  The scene where she puts on a girdle was so silly; the actress had NOTHING to conceal!  Typical Hollywood - couldn't show a realistically large woman's (jiggly, stretch-marked) stomach and thighs.

The movie's plot is like a Harlequin romance-novel fantasy, which could be enjoyable, but unfortunately this movie's characters are not especially endearing; they don't grow on the viewer.

(It was the same with the book, I thought; very lightweight characters in a silly plot, just a lot of self-consciously clever quips thrown around; very ""chick-lit"" in every negative sense of those words.)

Frankly this movie's all-around Hollywood-gloss phoniness just annoyed me more than anything.  A phoney-baloney portrayal of a so-called ordinary woman, struggling with, in romantic-comedy fashion, a relationship with a rotten guy and finally realizing there's a good guy there for her.

1283901,2,B00003CXT7,"Well, to start off tactfully I would have to say that it was interesting to see Colin Firth in a more modern role. He's as photogenic as ever, but really seemed to lack motivation. Hugh Grant was quite an interesting character with some truly hilarious lines, although I couldn't quite see that he was so horrible. As for the main character I know nothing about the actress but the character has to be one of the most stupid and embarassingly inept people I've ever seen. This is definitely a chick flick in that it seems to say that a woman can be forgiven for being mind-numbingly stupid, hopelessly incompetant and completely self-absorbed as long as she gets herself a guy. Further more, all of the above are not reason enough for her to be cheated out of her rightful due of a prince charming who loves her for being just who she is. Frankly she'd better hope he does, because it's really hard to see what other motivation anyone would have for putting up with her. One could almost forgive her for simply being really simple-minded, but her lack of dignity, social restraint, or balance make her such a complete embarrassment that it's hard to imagine wanting to be seen in public with her. This movie has only the most passing resemblance to Jane Austen's story which featured a main character who was intelligent, considerate and independent. She may have felt badly about losing marriage prospects since there weren't many other options at the time, and even been upset over losing Darcy's good opinion, but she would never have angsted in such an appalling fashion over simply being single. It's hard to imagine a bigger difference between them. This could definitely be a contender for most annoying movie of the year if I weren't aware that it would be underestimating Hollywood's capacity to turn out truly awful films.

1283903,5,B00003CXT7,"Renee Zellwegger is absolutely fantastic in an Oscar-nominated role as the plump, zany, and loveable character of Helen Fielding's biting sature. The film stays pretty true to the best-selling book, but it's a lot more fun and very clever. The casting is impecable and the performances are grand. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth are beautiful, charming, and easy to love, making us understand why Bridget would be so torn up between the two.

The movie strings together one funny set-piece after another, as when Bridget goes in costume to a party where she thought the theme was ""Tarts & Vicars."" Or when she stumbles into a job on a TV news show and makes her famous premature entrance down the fire pole. Or when she has to decide at the beginning of an evening whether sexy underwear or tummy-crunching underwear will do her more good in the long run. Bridget charts her own progress along the way, from ""tragic spinster"" to ""wanton sex goddess,"" and the movie gives almost unreasonable pleasure as it celebrates her bumpy transition.

This is a fine film, full of terrific one-liners, memorable scenes, and great characters. It is one of the few film adaptations to do the novel justice. It makes me anticipate the heavily hyped but ultimately pointless sequel. Can't Wait!!!",1092700800,3,1275,4.870967741935484

 The cast in this movie is totally perfect. I was especially impressed with Colin Firth (I don't know any woman who has seen a movie with him in it who hasn't fallen in like/love with him--he's extremely charming and handsome), and Renee Zellwegger. Hugh Grant played the slimeball particularily well, too. I loved to hate his character. The actors and actresses who played Bridget's friends were pretty funny too.

Being pretty banged up I decided to get crocked off my bean and watch a romantic comedy, preferably something featuring Renee Zellweger. So to make a long story short, I went down to the video store and rented Bridget Jones' Diary from the two jackasses that work there.
 I repaired to my living room with beer and whiskey, fully prepared to watch the flick whilst getting quietly steamed. As the show began to unfold before me, I construed that Renee Zellweger would, in this production, be playing a British citizen and, as such, would be talking in a British accent. I was drinking Spaten Premium with a Johnnie Walker Green Label chaser; this followed by some bourbon. This followed by more bourbon. Charmingly for me Bridget Jones was also a problem drinker! Ten Stars!
 Update, 7-27-04, 1:47 AM. Have just watched Bridget Jones for the second time. Now, utterly trashed due to earlier unmentionable trauma of an entirely uncerebral nature which necessitated intake of large quantities of booze. Bridget Jones better than before. Renee Zellweger more charming than ever. Booze, ditto. The ad line for this movie should have been not, ""See it with someone you love"" but ""see it p*ssed off your conk"" You'll be glad you did.

1283974,5,B00003CXT7,"In 1995, the Jane Austen classic ""Pride and Prejudice"" was aired as a BBC miniseries - and women all over Britain (and a year later, the US) fell in love with actor Colin Firth's portrayal of the enigmatic Mr. Darcy. Author Helen Fielding was one of those women, and in an homage to the classic novel (not to mention Firth's performance), she began writing a series of newspaper columns modernizing the classic tale.

 Bridget Jones, a modern-day Elizabeth Bennett, is a thirty-something living in London. In January, Bridget decides to begin a diary to reveal who she really is. She vows to lose weight, find a sensible boyfriend, and prove that she is a dedicated woman with inner poise. What follows is a hilarious and all-too-true journey into Bridget's life over the next twelve months.

 Like many best-selling novels, ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" has become a movie, and while some specific scenes have changed, the plot line stays the same in a fantastic adaptation of Helen Fielding's beloved creation. Renee Zellweger is perfectly cast as Bridget, and she provides a realistic and brilliant interpretation of the heroine. Hugh Grant shows his charm and wit as Daniel Cleaver, the cad who vies for Bridget's affections (a la Austen's character of Wickham). And, in a bit of a reprisal of his BBC role, Colin Firth plays Mark Darcy (a tribute to ""Pride and Prejudice""'s Mr. Darcy), a friend of Bridget's who seems so wrong for her he might actually be Mr. Right.

 With first time director Sharon Maguire (the real-life inspiration for Fielding's character of Sharon) leading the team of writers Richard Curtis (""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Love Actually"") and Fielding herself, the beloved Bridget Jones emerges from the page to the screen in a hilarious film you will want to watch over and over again.",1090454400,5,1813,4.927868852459016
1283975,5,B00003CXT7,"Bridget Jones's Diary was an unexpected surprise for me.  I suppose I expected a sappy Renee and Hugh love story.  It's not.  Substitute sticky for sappy and lust for love and your getting in the right neighborhood.
I didn't have to identify with Bridget's (Renee Zellweger) biological clock to get the squirmy wormies during her multiple awkward situations or to feel triumphant when she overcame in spite of her embarrassment.
Hugh Grant plays the lovable rogue and the object of Bridget's heart.  Even though the role of the scoundrel is a departure for Grant he plays it much as he does when he's the victim of love.  If anything his good guy history adds to the allure of twists in the movie.
I am a Renee Z fan anyway but her portrayal of an undesirable, overweight, out of the game English spinster was amazing.  None of these terms come to mind when I think of Ms Zellweger yet she was completely believable.
Oh yeah, I forgot the most important thing; I laughed out loud a lot.  This is a very funny movie.
The story is great.  The cast is great.  Buy the movie.",1090022400,4,1071,4.507772020725389
1283976,4,B00003CXT7,"What sets this movie apart from other romantic comedies is that its heroine is a witty, self-deprecating, socially clumsy woman who isn't stick-thin, who doesn't look polished, and who will not have to undergo a makeover or any other kind of enormous transformation just to steal the hero's heart.  He likes her just as she is.  And so do we, even if we think her a bit daft for taking so long to realize that he's the right man for her.
But before Bridget even allows herself to admit that the proud and reserved Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) is not as bad as she thought, she's first swept away by her boss, Daniel Cleaver, played in a delightfully rakish way by Hugh Grant.  And not only does she have to sort out her feelings for Darcy and Cleaver, she also has a host of other difficulties to deal with - her parents' troubled marriage, her fondness for fatty foods, her love of drink, and her tendency to speak without thinking.
Highlights of the movie include Bridget dressing up as a Playboy Bunny for what she thought was a tarts and vicars party.  Another funny scene is her in the kitchen, ineptly making blue soup and swampy-looking gravy for her birthday dinner.  Sometimes the movie did go too over the top, as in the fight scene between Cleaver and Darcy.  Also, in the DVD outtakes, I didn't see any additional scenes with Colin Firth (a pity, because he's so well-suited for such a role and so easy on the eyes...).  But on the whole, the movie was delightful, fun and full of warmth.",1089676800,3,1496,4.477941176470588

She finds her man in no time, Daniel Cleaver, who is her boss, but shortly finds out that he is NOT the man she's been looking for. In a strange turn of events, Bridget quits her job and finds another as a TV personality. After more events, mad depresssion, getting hung over, a (REAL) fight, and a divorce in the family, she finds the truth about jerky Mark and Daniel, and finds true love.

He is perfect in his role, although I don't think anyone else could have played it.  Hugh Grant, whom I normally don't like (with the exception of Sense & Sensibility), is wonderful in his role as Daniel.  I've never liked him much as a good guy in movies, but he makes a perfect jerk.
This movie is a must-see, whether or not you've read the book.  There are a lot of subtle references to P&P that can easily be missed and are fun to find.  Such as the first time I watched I didn't notice that the publishing company was called Pimberley.  I didn't notice until I saw the logo on the wall in one of the scenes.  I'm sure if you've read the book, this doesn't seem so subtle, but it's still fun to recognize these things.

1283981,5,B00003CXT7,"Unfairly or not, ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" received a lot of attention because Renee Zellweger (title character) announced that she would gain (gasp!) twenty to thirty pounds to portray England's most beloved weight-challenged singleton.  (It's hard to say it's unfair when the movie's producers kept hyping this part of the movie.)
""BJD"" actually deserves plenty of praise on its basic merits -- excellent acting, witty screenplay, and great camerawork.  For those who doubt how important camerawork can be to the making of a great comedy, watch how many of the laughs in this film come from the reaction shots rather than the jokes themselves.  ""BJD"" has great writing, but there is some visual artistry in this movie that elevates it to more than a collection of funny jokes.
For example, in an early scene, Bridget confronts Mark Darcy, a seemingly grim, definitely handsome attorney Bridget's mom hamfistedly tries to set up with Bridget.  While Bridget hammers on about abandoning drinking and smoking for New Year's (while clutching a cocktail and cigarette like they are life preservers), Darcy's stoic-yet-fuming reactions are priceless.
The plot is pure chick-flick.  Bridget is a thirty-something singleton looking for love in the big city.  Infected with bad taste in men, she pursues her boss (and office cad), played with gleeful self awareness by Hugh Grant -- check out the glint in his eyes when we first see him, a close-up with Aretha Franklin blaring on the soundtrack.  Soon in an ill-advised romance with her boss, Bridget too late recognizes the signs that her boss is not a nice guy.
While enduring the excruciatingly funny torture of her mom's affair with a walking white elephant of a man (the host of the shopping network), Bridget decides to be her own woman.  Breaking out on her own, despite some unfortunate slips of the tongue during job interviews, she finds herself marching to her own tune and eventually occupying a dream space -- with Colin Firth and Hugh Grant fighting over her (rather wimpishly, I might add) outside and through a crowded restaurant.
More than a touching romance, more than a journey of personal discovery, and yet so very small and perfect, ""BJD"" is one of those great feel-good flicks that should be a chick flick, and yet is very much more.
The DVD's extras are also wonderful, including a delightful set of ""interviews"" with Bridget's former boss in a bar with his succession of inadequate girlfriends.  A good DVD for a great film!",1083542400,7,2490,4.995169082125604
1283982,5,B00003CXT7,"I love this movie!  I loved reading the book.  Bridget is a single and in her thirties.  At a Christmas dinner, she is set up by her mother with a childhood neighbor Mark Darcy, who is bitter after his divorce.  He doesn't do much to make Bridget to feel welcome.  She thinks that he is too uptight for her so she persues Daniel.  Daniel, who has an appetite for women, is impressed with Bridget.  They go out until she finds out that he is engaged to be married.  What a terrible surprise!  That is the turning point for Bridget to get herself together.  And she does.  She gets to know more about Mark and does like him.
Mark put a shield around himself because of what happened to him.  He used his job to avoid having fun in his life.  Colin Firth did a good job portraying his character as he did in ""Pride and Prejudice"".  Hugh Grant was sexy in his role as Daniel.  And the other characters were just as good portraying Bridget's family and friends.
This is a good movie for any single woman.  As single women, there is a great deal of pressure from the marrieds as to why we aren't in a relationship or even married.  Some of us are trying to get a life of our own before even giving up a life that we have yet to explore.  I am still single and have no qualms about it.

Sure it's sappy at times, but more often it is something I have far more regard for--hilarious.  Zellweger plays Bridget perfectly, portraying her awkwardness in a way that makes her loveable and endearing, an anti-heroine for a genre so saturated in Julia Roberts that it is disgusting (sorry if no one understands what I mean by this, but it IS true).
And of course, there is Mark Darcy, played by Colin Firth.  Firth is by nature perfect for this role, as it was designed for him, and I am afraid I will not understand any woman who does not fall in love with him--or rather his characters, I grudgingly suppose.  Hugh Grant's character is of course smooth, but evil, and played suprisingly well by an actor we're all used to seeing fill the role of the good guy who always gets the girl.
All in all, this is one of my favorite romantic comedies, notably for its goofy humor, heart, and of course, its Britishness.  All I can do now is wonder if that is a real word.",1078012800,3,1083,4.422110552763819

Don't write this movie off as a chick-flick.  It is both fun and engaging for women AND men.  Give this movie a try.

This hilarious comedy is centered on Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger), a 30-something single woman who works at a publishing company where she has an affair with her boss Daniel (Hugh Grant). This is where the fun begins and from this point onwards, her childhood friend turned nemesis Mark Darcy (played with sarcastic finesse by Colin Firth) becomes hesitantly interested in her but unfortunately because of twisted lies, Bridget is completely antagonistic towards him. The film continues to show that Bridget has two men to choose from: the womanising Hugh Grant or the composed Colin Firth. Which man does she choose? The film is great in confusing the audience while adding extra dimensions by explaining other subplots.
Some people might say that this film is too light-hearted to be taken seriously but it is such a laughter-riot that it makes the viewer remember that films don't always have to be serious and you can laugh and enjoy a film with a top cast.
Zellweger is great in portraying the self-conscious Bridget Jones, Grant = smooth as the arrogant publishing boss and Firth is fantastic at what he does best : the calm and aloof lawyer.

If you are like me and revelled in Helen Fielding's remarkably witty written work then you will probably be somewhat disappointed by the movie.  Perhaps a more apt title to the movie should have be ""Bridget Jones's Diary - Abridged"".  I note that Helen Fielding herself executive produced and co-write the screenplay and all I can ask is, what happened?  Don't get me wrong, the movie if examined by itself is actually decent, Renee Zellweger is absolutely spot on as Bridget Jones in her search for ""inner poise"".  I thought the casting of Hugh Grant as Daniel Cleaver and Colin Firth (reprising his role in Pride and Prejudice as ""Darcy"") was genius and quite the inside joke.  In the end it wasn't the actors or the acting that let me down, it was the way the screenplay seem to completely water down the clever wit and charm of the written material.  If you've seen the movie, whether you liked it or not, I urge you to read the book and be prepared to laugh out loud.  I feel like the subtle farcical complexity of Bridget Jones's inner voice was given the Hollywood treatment and reduced to a rather straight forward romantic picture.  The subtlety of Jane Austen replaced by Fatal Attraction (what was THAT all about?).

The fault lies not with Renee Zellweger with her flawless performance but perhaps with the script or direction or the failure of Colin Firth to convince the viewer of the transformation that takes place that draws him to Bridget - as I said it happens as a requirement of the plot.
But for me this was only a minor flaw in what was otherwise an entertaining film.  The various plot sequences - really character development sketches are on the whole well done. The emotional feelings of Bridget to her evolving situation are enhanced with a skillful choice of songs.  For me it was the use of music that raised this to a 4 star production.
Poor use was made of the two outstanding performers Jim Broadbent and Shirley Henderson (""Yum-Yum"" in Topsy Turvy) in what could only be called minor roles.  The ensemble casting was only average.

Considering it was filmed in England, there were a lot of English actresses up for the role, including Kate Winslet, but I'm so glad Renee got the role. And how she ever managed to perfect that English accent, and not let a slip of her Texan drawl through was amazing.
The song ""All By Myself"" is the song/motto that single girls should live by! Heaven knows I've played it often enough! And Bridget's men self help books are well documented in the film, and the scene where she throws them in the bin and then takes them back out again, is very poignant, cos every woman has at least one of those hidden away in her bookcase!
In every entry in the book, it starts by listing her weight, cigarettes smoked, and alcohol units, and I would have preferred to see that more often during the film, as it was good in the book.
The scene where Hugh Grant first appears is enough to make every girl swoon. Hugh's character, Daniel Cleaver, shows Hugh going away from his usual ""good guy"" image in films, and moving into the ""bad boy"" image! Hugh is hardly what you would call a sex god normally but in this film . . . Ding-dong. And the scene where Hugh falls into the water, and surfaces in a wet shirt - well, you could just watch that scene over and over again!
Bridget's friends, Shazza, Jude and Tom should have had a film just to themselves, and will hopefully appear more in the sequel. They were brilliant.
To think the sales of the ""scary, stomach-holding-in pants, very popular with grannies"" actually soared after this film! Very scary thought.
Mots of the audience will hate Mark Darcy's (Colin Firth) character and love Daniel Cleaver, but your feelings go back and forth throughout the film . . . well, until the finale anyway. The fight between Mark & Daniel is pure hilarious entertainment; backed by Geri Halliwell's ""It's Raining Men"". A very camp song for a very girly fight. If this is how real men fight, it doesn't bear thinking about! Hugh & Colin do a good job of fighting like a pair of girls  - and even that's saying something, as girls could fight better than that - slapping, scratching, kicking and hair pulling. Colin Firth is definitely so sexy in the finale. He's got really nice eyes.
There's apparently a mistake while I haven't been able to spot yet. When Bridget & Daniel on away on the weekend mini break together, they're driving along and Bridget's wearing the scarf and sunglasses, trying to look like Grace Kelly. When the scarf blows off, it's supposed to be pulled off by a mysterious hand, which you can see when you go through the scene frame by frame.
When Bridget goes to the Tarts & Vicars party, in her bunny girl outfit, if you watch the bunny ears, they reveal her moods. When she's feeling good, the ears are perky and upright, but as it progresses the ears gradually dip down, as her mood gets worse.
The extras include Sharon MacGuire's commentary; behind the scenes featurette; Shelby Lynne's ""Killing Kind"" music video; Gabrielle's ""Out Of Reach"" music video; deleted scenes and original Bridget Jones's Diary columns. Both music videos have very inspirational lyrics. The featurette shows the woman behind the book, Helen Fielding, and Bridget Jones herself Renee Zellweger. Helen Fielding admits to ""stealing"" the plot from Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice, which doesn't make sense, but then again, I've never had the pleasure of reading that book!
And THAT kiss. Everyone knows which kiss I'm talking about. That is the perfect kiss. Nothing could amount or even surpass that perfect kiss!
There is a bit of Bridget Jones in everyone, and I can't wait for the rumoured sequel, The Edge Of Reason, which Renee Zellweger is busy putting on weight for - and its all going on her cheeks. I hope it's as good as the first, but I didn't find the book as good as the first. And in the sequel, Bridget Jones gets to interview Colin Firth - but he's already in the film. How are they going to explain that one?",1063843200,3,4212,4.534822601839685

1284156,5,B00003CXT7,"Renee Zellweger is a delight in the title role of this frothy film.  I was floored by her klutzy radiance.  I had just seen a super slim Renee in ""Chicago"" and marvel at how youthful and appealing she is with a few extra pounds.
""Bridget Jones Diary"" is a chick flick that transcends the genre. The plot has the barest nod to Ms. Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" though Elizabeth Bennett would be flabbergasted to find Bridget in her role. Colin Firth actually recreates Mr. Darcy (see his fine BBC performance of P&P) with his tongue firmly in cheek.  Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) is Bridget's wicked temptation of a faithless lover.  I must say if Hugh Grant is lovable as a dim wit comedian, he is devastating in a charming villain role.
Bridget is a not-quite-featherhead, obsessively concerned with her weight, sex life and self-perceived lack of charm, looks, and luck. In her early 30's, she worries about expiring in her lonely room and being eaten by dogs. She dislikes ""smug marrieds,"" but is fearfully intimidated by them.  Bridget makes sporadic attempts to take control of her life usually with disastrous results.
It took me this long to see the movie because I was lukewarm about the book.  However, Ms. Zellweger brings Bridget to life in such a way that I was instantly won over by her ditzy charm.  I fervently championed her every triumph and was saddened by her setbacks (usually brought on by herself).  This is a feel-good film and definitely worth a 120 minute investment.  Treat yourself to a guilt-free chocolate sundae after the movie.  Enjoy!

The story here is a wondrous love story that takes many turns and twists, just like real life, but in the end the heart always wins.

Why? Helen Fielding captured a certain time in a single woman's life (the early 30's) at a certain era in our cultural history (post women's lib, at a time when women are supposed to want it all, yet society still demands marriage). I, and most of my single female friends, related so strongly to the trials and tribulations of our heroine. The loving 'urban' family, the smug married friends, the sleazy bosses...are all true to life for so many contemporary women.
The movie retains the charm of the book. Renee Zellwegger is a revealation as the chain smoking, food binging heroine. Yet she goes way beyond capturing the compulsions of Bridget-she also movingly portrays Bridget's more poignant sides and the lonliness many women (and men) feel in the dating jungle. Hugh Grant is his usual charming self. Yes he is nastier in this film but he still has a light and charming way about him. Colin Firth
is wonderful. He too portrays a character, who despite tremendous professional success, also seems to struggling with issues of social unease and lonliness.
Of course, some people won't like this movie. Hugh Grant, british comedy, romantic comedy-if these genres are not your thing, this movie will not change your opinion. But a treat for the rest of us..

Renee portrays Bridget Jones with a certain chaotic, goofy, babbling, bad hairdo, kind of charm. And while I'm sure Kate Winslet could have done a marvelous job as well, she is just too darn pretty to play the plain, lovelorn, singleton, Bridget Jones.

First he's rude, cold, condescending and distant, and suddenly.........he's adorable, sweet, hot, and sexy! He completely steals the show away from Hugh (Who?) Grant.  So after I finally got around to reading the book, I was surprised again to discover that it was better than the book!

The most saliant problem with this movie is, who is it trying to fool ? Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger) is obviously too attractive and intelligent to still be single at 30-something. This is an utterly pointless premise.
Bridget Jones' Diary is, simply said, a caricature of single life. Most of its characters are caricatures, that only exist to either torment Bridget about being single, to be the stereotypical ""group of friends"", or antagonists.

Thank God for the years of selfless campaigning for the rights of women while fighting against oppressive domination. As a result the silver screen is proud to present it's first female role model of the new millennium. Bridget Jones.
OH MY GOD.
What does Ms Jones do with her hard won liberty? She spends her life looking for the perfect man to marry.
Bridget, a 32-year-old, single white female - played by Renee Zellweger - works in the PR department of a publishing house and lives alone. She spends her nights drinking vodka and worrying about dying a lonely death as an old spinster and being eaten by her pet dogs. Bidget has surely spent too many long evenings in front of the tele watching repeats of Ally McBeal and Sex In The City. Looking for the perfect man? There's a large haystack without a needle.
During the day she's at the office, working for a sexist, womanising cad of a boss - Hugh Grant - with whom she decides definitely not to have a relationship. They exchange sexy emails about the shortness of her skirt and the niceness of her chest, before embarking on a relationship.
Prior to bedding the boss, Bridget bumps into the beastly Mark Darcy - Colin Firth - at her parents annual curried turkey New Year's day dinner party. They don't really hit it off and she hopes never to see the rude, unemotional human rights lawyer again. You can guess what follows.
If the plot sounds a tad familiar, then well done for paying attention during those dry old English lit classes at school. Thanks to a ouija board and a pack of tarot card, Helen Fielding, the writer of Bridget Jones's Diary (newspaper column, best selling novels and now smash hit film), was able to collaborate with the very dead Jane Austen and use the plot from Pride and Prejudice.
In fact Colin Firth shot to stardom following his role as Mr Darcy in the BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, a few years ago. In it he played an unemotional, over privileged, rude man with an upper lip so stiff it could be used as a load bearing wall. This time his character is completely different as he doesn't wear tight breeches and overly high collars. The Noddy Holder sideburns are, thankfully, still in place.
Luckily Hugh Grant was chosen to add spice and originality to the role of the fun loving cad. A part that needed the slimy ooziness of Terry Thomas or Leslie Phillips (ding dong). And Hugh gave a virtuoso performance as...well..ah...um......ah.....yes.......um......himself. Full marks to Hugh, he does play himself incredibly well, he really gets under his own skin. He is obviously method acting as you can genuinely believe he has fully become himself.
If I've given the impression this film is mutton dressed up as lamb, then I need to put on my best Hugh Grant voice and say...ah.....um....sorry..........ah....ah..sorry.....yes.....sorry. As it isn't. It's a very good film. An incredibly enjoyable film that made popcorn shoot out of my mouth when unexpected laughter took hold of me (another sorry, this time to the people in row H). And there are lots of truly original moments, like the very English street fight between the two well brought-up men.
Mr Grant and Mr Firth do act their socks off and are both very impressive. (But they have had a lot of practice at these two roles). Renee Zellweger is definitely the star of the film, making me cringe with embarrassment when she had to speak in public and I did end up hopping this mad middle class madam would eventually find happiness in something other than booze, food and fags.
It was nice to see a leading lady sporting a normal body. No half starved twiglet suffering from I-want-the-waist-of-a-twelve-year-old-itus, with silicon balloons superglued to her chest cavity. It's the first time I've ever seen a big name actress with a bottom (described by her uncle as one you could park your bike in and rest your pint on). Although she was far from being fat.
As for American Zellweger's English accent, it was really rather jolly good. A little strange at times and quite hard to fit a post code to, but if I hadn't known she was from the colonies I would have sworn she was from somewhere in the home counties.
Poor Bridget Jones is from the Cosmopolitan generation. She's a women who learns her life skills from glossy magazines and self help books. She aspires to life long happiness with men who are barely equipped to deal with the emotional turmoil of boiling an egg. She was born into a middle class world where everyone must be happy all the time, but no one ever is. Bridget Jones was born to be a post feminist icon, women love her and identify with her, but would never, ever admit to being like her.

I almost didn't see this movie, because I had glanced at Helen Fielding's novel, which the film is based on, and it didn't seem interesting at all. In fact, my co-worker and I used to make fun of the book. So naturally, when I saw that they were actually making a movie out of the book, I groaned, thinking it was a stupid idea.
Boy, was I wrong. Bridget Jones's Diary is the best romantic comedy I think I have ever seen. It's sweet and charming, and it has some real laugh-out-loud moments. The heart of the film is Renee Zellweger, who is not British but who does such a wonderful British accent, you would never know she is American. She does a beautiful job as Bridget. Hugh Grant is excellent, as usual. I think he's at his best when his characters are jerks and players. And Colin Firth, whom I had never seen before, is outstanding as Mark Darcy, the straight-laced, never-seems-to-smile foe/friend/romantic interest of Bridget's.
My co-worker finally watched it the other day and loved it. After discussing it for a few minutes, I remembered how much I loved it, and went right home that day and watched it again! The DVD includes behind-the-scenes featurettes, a couple of music videos, deleted scenes, and director's commentary. The only thing missing, in my opinion, is a cast commentary. The three leads all have great chemistry together, and it would have been interesting to get their input. But other than that, I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys romantic comedies.

The tale of her romantic and professional misadventures - and ultimate victory - will have you cringing and crying with laughter at the same time.  In any other year, Zellweger might actually have secured the Oscar for this role.  Not only did she display incredible physical commitment in mastering a British accent and packing on real pounds to play the part, she perfectly captures the endearing insecurity of the contemporary woman along with its necessary antidote - a bedrock of self-respect which has her rejecting the kind of man who thinks he can always have her (Hugh Grant), and hanging on for the one she really wants (Colin Firth).  Helen Fielding's novel has been brilliantly adapted - improved, even - thanks mainly to the peerless comic flair of co-writer Richard Curtis.  Where the book eventually slipped into a dull repetitiveness (which I suppose one could argue is deliberately emblematic of the lifestyle it portrays), the film is more focused, more funny, and knows precisely when to call it a day.  First-time director Sharon Maguire directs with remarkable confidence, revealing a great eye and ear for gags.  This is, quite simply, a perfect comedy.

1284337,5,B00003CXT7,"BRIDGET JONES' DIARY is a refreshing mix of actually funny intellectual and slapstick comedy.  This is a story about a single workingwoman in her 30's making her way through the ever-convoluted ""dating scene"".  It is not about the much media-touted CEO who, in her 20's, has turned down an onslaught of marriage proposals for a lucrative career.  DIARY is more representative of the average woman who did not marry at a young age, and who over the years comes to find dating much like rolling around in a minefield.  By her early to mid-thirties, Miss Jones has begun to ponder the likelihood of never marrying, of dying alone, her unfound body getting eaten by dogs, or - even scarier - ending up like Glen Close in FATAL ATTRACTION.  All this while plagued by invasive references to her ticking biological clock.
The freedom to drink and smoke at will, due to her single, childless status, is no longer without consequence, as most who are of a certain age eventually discover.  Jones' weight creeps up the scale.  Her over-30 constitution has her commenting at a Christmas Day party that she wishes to be ""...laying with my head in the toilet like most normal people.""  Pressing issues such as these are presented with as much fun as possible, while still allowing for the full blow of inevitable stress and self-doubt which results.  DIARY is smart, though merciful, in its parody of social pressure to conform, and the individual's various reactions to these less than subtle demands.  However, Bridget's recognizable offences do not leave you scoffing with disdain or cringing in horrified self-recognition.  Familiar situations reap giggles and identifiable cads and cattiness are almost likable, or just too funny not to enjoy.
Renee Zellweger is flawless in her role as Bridget Jones.  Her performance and prose are delivered with such smart, smooth mastery that at times it seems she must be ad-libbing as opposed to delivering rehearsed, directed lines.  Her mastery of the English dialect is exquisite, and she churns it out as neatly and naturally as adding a lime to gin.  Well done!
Hugh Grant plays Daniel Cleaver, the all-too-familiar Bad-For-You Boyfriend whom women all too often know and love - Grant's natural charm as the sweet, bumbling sardonic nice boy does not get lost in this bad boy role.  In no way does his character become the villain you love to hate.  In fact, you just love him!  Like Zellweger, he presents such a hilariously smooth performance, that one comes to wonder how a rehearsed and scripted line can be presented so naturally!
Colin Firth is nothing less than perfect in the role of the romantic hero.  His initially subdued, straight-laced manner gains depth through interaction with Bridget, Daniel Cleaver, and varied other characters - so that finally the chance of the true sweetness of love comes to light in Bridget's life.  I say - Mr. Firth can embody Mr. Darcy quite well in any literary incarnation!
The supporting cast includes several actors not mentioned here in detail.  Let me just say that they are as brilliant as the stars that have drawn people to this gem - which is without doubt a mosaic worth examining at every detail!",1038528000,11,3188,4.901303538175046

The story centers around Bridget Jones. Female, 32 (and counting) she fears her life is going exactly nowhere. After another disappointing Christmas at her disfunctional family's home she decides to take matters in her own hands.

1284415,5,B00003CXT7,"Not to be overly enthusiastic, but oh how I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this movie!  Oh, what the hey, I can't help but be overly enthusiastic about such a warm,funny, cute, witty,and just absolutely adorable, feel-good movie as Bridget Jone's Diary!  I have but a handful of ""favorite comedies"" that I  never grow tired of watching (and seem to find funnier with each successive viewing) and Bridgette is now one of the handful - perhaps she's even on the top of the pile!
This is one of those movies you most definitely should buy, simply because it makes you happy to watch it.  No matter how depressed or cranky you might be, this movie is like the best therapy around!  It will put you in a good mood - I guarrantee!  Why?  First of all, it's funny!  Very, very funny; funny in a cute, silly sort of way, not a tacky, tasteless, Scary Movie sort of way. This is a movie that's just bursting with fantastically silly dialogue - and the best dialogues are the ones going on right inside Bridgette's own head!  It all boils down to something people tend to forget about:  The Writing!  And the writing for this movie is excellent!
Okay, next: the character of Bridgette Jones; played to perfection by Renee Zellwinger (who, by the way, I was not very crazy about before this movie, but this woman can really do comedy and her English accent is dead-on!  Plus, she's not afraid to look bad; very commendable for an actress).  The character is adorable!  She's so humble and lovable - you will indeed fall in love with her.  You just can't help it!  Unfortunately, for her, she falls in love with Hugh Grant's character in the movie, who plays her ""playboy of a boss""!  And as everyone knows, Hugh Grant is fantastic at playing those rakish ""bad boy types""!
So the acting is good; the writing is good; and never once does it lose steam or become boring. And here's another thing; this movie has depth.  It's not your typical slap-stick just going for the humor comedy.  It's not some boring old cliche of a romance, either.  No, it's much, much more.  It's funny; yes, but it also has heart and soul!  Then ending, I promise you, will raise your endorphin levels to new heights!
What's the movie about?  Well, it's about a single thirty-something woman living in London who drinks too much, can't seem to meet the ""right sort of men"", and basically feels her life is a mess. So, on New Year's, she decides to start keeping a diary, lose some weight, cut out the drinking; and basically get her life back on track.  Like most resolutions, though, they seem to get swept down the toilet!
Is this a chick flick?  I suppose some people would say yes (possibly men)!  But honestly, my husband liked this movie, too.  Maybe not as much as me, but I have to be honest.  It would be hard to like this movie as much as me!  But go ahead; give it a try and see what you think!  Whether you're in your thirties, single, or not, I think that Bridgette Jones Diary is a very special movie.  And I have brand new respect for Renee Zellwinger!",1035331200,,3029,4.452727272727273

Because we go to the UK as often as possible we understand accents and slangs that most Americans don't get.  We just wanted to jump into the screen and be back there!
While I must say that the outcome is predictable, we do have a lot of fun getting there.  Hugh Grant was perfectly slimy and Colin Firth was perfectly boring in a nice sort of way.  I told my daughter that this is how it is with Mothers and daughters.  Any boy my mother thought I should date was the one I stayed away from and I expect her to do the same.  It's just human nature as Jane Austen and Helen Fielding seem to understand.  I am now purchasing the DVD for my oldest daughter who is also an Anglophile but didn't come with us.  She is not old enough to be in Bridget's position yet but this will make her feel better about the whole dating situation and hopefully alleviate some of the pressure that society (and mothers) put on young women to find a mate.

Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger) is your average 32-year-old single girl who smokes too much, drinks too much and can't seem to land Mr Right.  An affair with her cocky, self-obsessed boss (Hugh Grant - NOTTING HILL) ends up in tears, while a childhood friend, Darcy (Colin Firth - PRIDE AND PREJUDICE) just rubs Bridget up the wrong way.
When her parents (Jim Broadbent and Gemma Jones) unexpectedly break up, Bridget is left questioning the longevity of relationships and commitment in the long run.
Everything - from ciggies to snogs - is recorded in her faithful diary, a record of her life and her dreams.
A fantastic, hilarious film that only improves on repeated viewings.
The DVD includes director's commentary by Sharon Maguire, deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes footage/interviews, actual segments from Fielding's original 'diary' entries and music videos for ""Killin' Kind"" (Shelby Lynne) and ""Out Of Reach"" (Gabrielle).",1026432000,3,1122,5.303370786516854
1284586,4,B00003CXT7,"Bridget Jones's Diary is a surprisingly good movie. Detractors who deride it for its admittedly minimalist plot miss the point - this is a film that shows life without the layers of artificiality favoured by directors (resulting in movies somehow removed from the realm of the everyday in which us mere mortals dwell). Life is frequently aimless and trivial; and therein lies the movie's attraction. Notwithstanding of course that this is a very funny and highly original comedy.
Bridget (played with considerable aplomb by Renee Zellweger) belongs to the ranks of that modern phenomenon - the over-30, unmarried career woman. Just when it seems Bridget may be destined for terminal spinster-hood, two opposing forces enter her life - charming cad Daniel, and uptight (but very sexy) lawyer Mark. Which of the two is her Mr. Right? And why does everyone insist on asking that question detested by all singletons - ""How's your love life going?"" The movie's conclusion is predictable, and although any other ending would leave the audience feeling cheated, it does seem somewhat tame and ultimately unsatisfying.
The film encourages the viewer both to get involved with Bridget emotionally and to laugh at her at the same time. Perhaps the best joke is the milieu inhabited by her parents - where the mini-gherkin is the height of sophistication, and 60-year-olds throw garden parties with such alarming themes as 'tarts and vicars'. Bridget is certainly no social butterfly, and whilst we cringe at her public embarrassments (notably her TV report involving a fireman's pole and a bottom the size of Brazil), we triumph with her when she manages to turn a bad situation to her advantage. Maybe we can recognise a little bit of Bridget Jones in all of us.",1026172800,,1753,5.027491408934708

As soon as Bridget began to lip-sync to ""All By Myself"", I related. Every time she floundered through some public moment by screwing up totally, I related. In the end though, her appeal isn't that she does mess up,  but that she doesn't let it keep her down. She gets up and moves on, as life always must. Renee Zellweger does an admirable job with the whole British accent/slang challenge. In fact, after the first minute, I forgot that she is American. Also, I would like to say that she looked far better at 130 lbs. than at 100 (much too thin), which is her usual weight. As her love interests; Hugh Grant(Daniel)is an insensitive skirt chaser, just as he is supposed to be, and Colin Firth(Mark) is everything else...perfectly. If his expressions of sympathy and empathy throughout the film doesn't melt your heart, than you have none. Both he and Renee can express more in one look than most actors can do with an entire speech.

What this film does have going for it is a fantastic cast.  Zellweger is absolutely charming in the title role.  It's just unfortunate that the story wasn't better.  It was obvious right from the beginning how all of the angst about whether she should choose Hugh Grant or Colin Firth and who is really the nice guy and who the cad and what really happened between those two and the Japanese girlfriend would turn out.  Add in other stock romantic moments like the kiss-in the-falling-snow and chasing-the-lover-down-the-street-at-the-last-moment-because-you-suddenly-realize-that-he's-really-the-one-for-you and the whole thing becomes a bit tiresome by the time the final credits roll.",1025222400,,1037,5.608974358974359

Renee is totally believable in the role, and she does truly stand out in this movie. The problem's I slightly had the most with were the content of coarse, but the most was the scene where Bridget finds an unexpected visitor in Daniel's (Hugh Grant) apartment. That scene made me very upset. The character of Bridget is indeed a lady you can fall in love with because I do have an ex-girlfriend who is like her in some ways.

This film is a funny, warm, and realistic take on singledom.
Renee Zellweger not only pulled off a near-flawless British accent to where I almost forgot she was from Texas, but she brought a lot of charm and wit to Bridget.  She wasn't perfect and she often embarassed herself.  I think movies too often try to portray these perfect women and the guys as the idiots who humiliate themselves to get near them.  But women do silly things to sometimes.  And these things can be just as funny as Freddie Prinze, Jr. falling down or something.
The men are good in this movie too.  Colin Firth is the smug British male, unwilling to admit his feelings, insecure.  You spend half the movie trying to figure out whether to love or hate him, but the end fills in the gaps for you.  Hugh Grant, always great, is cocky and slimy.  But how many mistakes have women dated?  All of us girls have seen this character in our dating life.
My only criticism:  Bridget is not fat, at least Renee wasn't fat in the film.  I get tired of the Hollywood standards of what is beautiful and skinny.  Renee looked like a normal healthy woman to me, a kind of girl who has become unappreciated in this society as of late.

1284687,4,B00003CXT7,"...what do you think about making a 21st century version of ""Pride and Prejudice""?
Well, that's what gives here. Not a novel idea really; Jane Austen's ""Emma"" was already served up pretty well some years back in Alicia Silverstone's ""Clueless"". What was funnier for me back then was that I hadn't known that before I was in the theatre with ""Clueless"", and it only dawned on me during the scenes with Elton, named for the maritally overreaching minister in the original novel. Here in ""Bridget Jones' Diary"", we've got a Mr. Darcy, just like in Austen's novel, too (even played by Colin Firth, the latest PandP Mr. Darcy). But this time I already was clued into its being an updating, so the fun of the shock wasn't there.
However, a movie needn't have to produce an epiphany to be amusing. This is a very amusing film, about a somewhat ribald, smoking, drinking, overeating young woman and her New Year's resolution to cut down on all the bad habits and get herself a man. She wears the most appalling  mini skirts to work, and so eventually receives an email come-on from her cad of a boss, Hugh Grant. She launches her affair with him, all the while bumping into the staid Colin Firth, whom she met at a Christmas party and took a dislike to when she heard him talking about her behind her back. And just like Jane Austen novels, it really looks like  our heroine will lose all and be one lonely lady, until everything miraculously works out in her favor.
So, if you're up to seeing a new spin on a classic romance, sneak a peek at ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" sometime in the near future.",1023062400,2,1586,4.522648083623693

Finally I see this ""imperfect"" perfect heroine, funny to the point of beeing ridiculuos, not so self assured, dealing with the trauma of loneliness, social pressure about marriage, trying to find the ""Mr. Right"", afraid to be a ""tragic spinster"" in her 30's, weight-obssesed and trying to quit: food, alcohol and smoking, a real woman, that's what she is!!

She is the first female character that doesn't make me feel bad about myself as a mortal beeing, she is full of normal flaws, with normal worries, and a normal HEART. And, thank God!! She finds true love for beeing ""just as she is"".
 I certainly believe that love can be found in the most unexpected person, that the person who really loves you does everything to help and support you to be a better person, not to change who you are, and if that person gets to know you in your worst moment and still likes you, well, IT'S A KEEPER.
I do believe Rene Zellweger deserved the Oscar as best actress, because her performing was flawless, you could read every emotion in her character all the time, even in her slightest gesture. You could see the change in her weight from ups and downs, hard thing to do!! But she looked very beautiful with those extra pounds, maybe should consider to keep them, or at least some of them. I can say the rest of the cast was well chosen, and the director did an excellent job, with simple and clean cinematographic language but taking care of the most insignificant detail to be perfect. I actually like the way the soundtrack of the movie, a selection of songs, matched very well with every moment of the movie, bringing an hilarious, warming and less presumptuous touch.
I have seen both ending credits from the american and the english versions, and I can say both are excellent, but if you have seen only the american ending credits version, where some characters tell their opinions about the new realtionship of Bridget, you just have to see the english version, because it's a home-made 8mm movie of Bridget and Mark in their childhood, when she used to ""run naked in his paddling pool"", absolutely adorable!!

I saw this film only because there was nothing else to watch.  I was very pleasantly surprised at what a sleeper this was.

It is an out and out romance film with the funny, likable Bridget Jones alternating between two leading men as her romatic interest, Hugh Grant and Colin Firth.  Grant plays a charming rat and is her boss.  It is easy to see why she's smitten with him though as he can be absolutely adorable when cranking on the charm.  Colin Firth plays the good but more wooden guy, Mark Darcy, a barrister, who is essentially a modern day version of Fitzwilliam Darcy from ""Pride & Prejudice.""

I have not talked to any woman who did not adore this film. Bridget's parents also turn in an excellent subplot of marital discord, with Jim Broadbent as her father, showing once again that as an actor he has few equals.  Hubby did like the little home movie which played over the end credits, which shows the child versions of Bridget and Mark at a party together, already interested in one another, set to the wonderful Rodgers & Hart tune, ""Have You Met Miss Jones?""  I really loved this part too but for me it was merely more frosting on an already perfect cake.  I saw this in the theater and bought it on DVD immediately and loved it both times.

1284781,3,B00003CXT7,"...I had actually looked forward to the release of Helen Fieldings novel "" Bridget Jones Diary "" on the big screen. Though, in the words of most of my male friends, considering this to be a 'chick flick' ...I had thought the movie sounded promising plus, being a life-long fan of Richard Curtis...I'm willing to see almost anything with his talents attached to the screen-writing credits.
Perhaps I should begin by simply stating that as far as the lead character Bridget is concerned, American actress Rene Zellweger does a marvelous job portraying the frumpy thirty-something Ms. Jones as a slightly over-weight, hopelessly neurotic, and at times even 'boyfriend obsessed' career girl in London. I could make a point of them not finding a proper British actress to fill the role but I do understand the studio's need to have a 'name' to sell more tickets upon it's release. That being said....while I have not read the novel on which the film is based I must say I was slightly disappointed by the almost sloppy comedic aspect that permeats the entire movie. Don't misunderstand me, I thought the film had it's moments....it just seemed after a short while that I was watchng a film that was simply made up of chaotic scenes with Bridget falling into one crisis or another. Comedy that, for the most part, seemed far too broad and slapstick to be able to stand up under the riguers of an entire film. While some of the lighter moments did hold up well ( I did enjoy the 'panties' scene with the incorrigable Hugh Grant ) I can still remember cringing upon the scene with Bridget sliding down the firefighters pole while there under the premise of conducting a story. A calculated scene that came across as merely 'silly', as opposed to being laugh out loud funny! Plus, attending a function dressed as a Playboy bunny, mistakingly believing it was a costume party, was far too contrived to get a laugh out of this viewer. Simply put, much of what I was seeing just seemed too forced for me to believe that alot of time and effort went into the actual writting of this once promising comedy. And, unfortunately, that is quite possibly the focal point of this less than sterling review....
A book that is as highly thought of and universally enjoyed, on both sides of the Atlantic, by so many delighted readers can generally be seen as a 'blessing and a curse' for the studio that brings that well loved novel to the 'big screen.' Stay true to the essence of the lead characters many comedic episodes ( and the spirit of the novel! ) and hopefully you've a captured audience far too enraptured with seeing their heroine on 'larger-than-life' before them. And, ( with any luck! ) many of the films obvious short-comings simply go by unnoticed in some viewers over eager desire's to truly enjoy what they are seeing. My 'gut-feeling' suggests that many film goers had, quite possibly, already had decided that this was a movie that were going to enjoy....almost regardless of what they were viewing on the screen. As long as the producers didn't tamper too much with the original format than I do believe that many ticket holders had subconciously walked into the theatre simply ready to be thoroughly enjoyed by Bridget and Co. A more self-fullfilled prophecy I've yet to see concerning an audience's expectations upon entering a movie theatre. I'm not suggesting that the makers of "" Bridget...."" are being disingenious, it seems as if they are simply being 'creatively lazy' in bringing a product to the screen that asks the audience to cheer on our protagonist simply by virtue of the viewer's loyalty to her in book form.
Overall, while there were some enjoyable aspects of the movie ( casting Hugh Grant as Bridget's obnoxious boss and swarmy love interest was a stroke of genius! ) it generally left me with the unsettling feeling that this was a movie that was trying far too hard to be liked. Again, pleasant enough but in the end feeling as though an opportunity had been lost. And that is perhaps the real shame here.....Bridget should be shown as a complete, whole woman, not a silly caricature of who we think she should be. 3.5 Stars",1016496000,4,4145,4.726519337016574
1284782,4,B00003CXT7,"Bridget Jones's Diary was a best selling book by Helen Fielding and it was only a matter of time before it was brought to the screen.  The book is extremely British in nature, so it was a major surprise when Renee Zellweger was cast to play the title role.  Not only is Ms. Zellweger not British, she seems to be the exact opposite of the overweight Bridget who drinks and smokes too much and is a self described singleton.  Despite the seeming miscasting, Ms. Zellweger is absolutely winning as Bridget.  She perfectly captures the mini-crisis's that Bridget faces with charm and perfect comedic timing.  The supporting cast is excellent as well, headed up by Hugh Grant as Bridget's playboy boss with whom she has a relationship with and Colin Firth as a stuffy lawyer who her mother is constantly trying to set her up with.  But again, this is Ms. Zellweger's film all the way and she gives the best performance of her career and one that garnered her a 2001 Oscar nomination as best actress.",1015977600,3,995,4.625
1284783,5,B00003CXT7,"I don't know if the British are funnier overall than Americans, or if we are exposed only to the best they have to offer. I do know that Bridget Jones's Diary is very British, even if it does star an American from Texas, and is one of the year's best comedies. It also travels well, as they say. Bridget's problems and fears are familiar to millions of people around the globe. She's the kind of character we laugh with instead of at.
Bridget [Renee Zellweger] is in her early thirties. She lives in London in a modest flat. She has an okay job at an upscale publishing company. She doesn't have a bad life, but she has reached that age where she's beginning to fear much of the good things in life may pass her by. She's also beginning to fret about her bad habits. She smokes, she drinks, and she eats too much. One day her urbane and sexy boss, Daniel [Hugh Grant], notices her. Bridget is worldly enough to know this may lead to something but too innocent to see that an affair with him probably won't turn out well in the long run. Mark [Colin Firth], a handsome but priggish acquaintance of Bridget's definitely knows Daniel is no good for her, but his way of telling her this only serves to make her want Daniel more than ever. Meanwhile, Bridget's parents are having problems of their own, and Mom winds up running off with the silly, pompous host of a TV show.
Zellweger was reluctant to take on the role of Bridget because, while the story is universal, it would not have survived being lifted out of its native England. New York for example, would have been entirely the wrong setting. She must have got the role right because the movie has been an even bigger hit in the U. K than it has been in America. After seeing her in it, I can't imagine anyone else's playing Brigit. It is a role she will always be identified with. Hugh Grant is marvelous, as always. He played a sort of male version of Bridget in Four Weddings and a Funeral, but, if anything, he is even better at playing a cad than he is a portraying a nice guy. Few actors can sum up a character in the first seconds of screen time as Grant does here. In his first scene he enters with a little smirk on his face that instantly tells us he's up to no good. As Mark, Colin Firth is first-rate. It's a role few actors could get right because Mark must always act prim and proper, yet also project enough warmth for the audience to relate to him. IF Firth hadn't been able to do this, the movie wouldn't have made sense.
Bridget Jones's Diary's greatest appeal is to women because her problems, as well as her responses to them, are mainly feminine ones. Still, many men will also be charmed by it because it's so original and funny. This Bridget's definitely a winner.",1015891200,4,2741,4.35546875

1284858,5,B00003CXT7,"Bridget Jones's Diary was one of the best films of 2001, and genuinely funny: that is the big difference between the modern American teen flicks which try hard to be funny, and this film which is effortlessly hilarious. Renee Zellweger was a surprising choice to play the completely English and dumpy Bridget, but she pulls it off brilliantly, particularly with the dull middle-class English accent which is very realistic. Bridget is 32, overweight, underpaid, and without a boyfriend. The flim, through the eyes of her diary, follows her amusing attempts to shape up, and get a man. In fact, she gets two men; her swarmy boss Daniel Cleaver, and a lawyer who she has known and detested from the age of five, Mark Darcy. Hugh Grant is wonderful as the slimy but irresitable Cleaver, and Colin Firth just as good as the slightly abrupt and reticent Darcy. There are good cameos from Jim Broadbent as Bridget's bumbling but likeable dad, and Gemma Jones as her snobbish mum. There are even surprise cameos from Jeffrey Archer and Salman Rushdie, both playing themselves. This cocktail makes for a most enteraining movie. There is emotion and seriousness in the right places, but lighter moments are never far away. The film will probably appeal particularly to younger women, but there is plenty in there for everyone, mainly because the film produces so many wonderful human charactitures. It's well worth buying, and bringing out over Christmas and when friends and family come round. If nothing else, the music soundtrack is brilliant.",1014940800,5,1537,5.0078125
1284859,3,B00003CXT7,"I'm a native Texan living in Britain.  Trust me, we don't blend.  Not even when we're putting on the most ridiculous, toe-curling English accent imaginable, like Zellweger did.  I remember stories in the press about her ""blending in"" at a London publishing house.  Americans aren't aware of this, but London publishing houses are full of obnoxious twits who are ALL putting on a posh accent, so they probably thought Zellweger was some lass from the Midlands trying to sound rich.
The film itself is not nearly as good as the book.  The book revolved around Bridget as well, but not to the extent that this film does.  It revolves around Bridget to the exclusion of all others.  This is why in the film her reasons for falling in love with Colin Firth's character are incomprehensible.  Firth and Hugh Grant were spot-on as their respective characters, the anal retentive barrister and the womanizing boss, but Zellweger's hammy performance ruins the entire movie.  I may be mistaken, but the impression I get from the film is that we are supposed to be sympathizing with Bridget and rooting her on.  I personally got a lot of enjoyment watching her fall on her face, arse, and other body parts.  I wanted her to fail, not to succeed.  That is how hateful Zellweger's Bridget was.  Also, I don't see how I'm supposed to believe for an instant that Bridget is overweight.  In the book, she got up to about 140 pounds.  Zellweger at her heaviest still looks to be about 10-15 pounds off the mark.  The frumpy Bridget from the book is nothing like the stick-thin Bridget that Zellweger presented us with.  She has agreed to do the second film but has refused to gain 20 pounds again to play the character, which will ruin the character still further.
Other faults with the film:
1.)  Cameos by famous British authors.  STOP IT.
2.)  Not nearly enough Perpetua.
3.)  Vile Richard did not even appear on screen.
4.)  Bridget is rich.  I don't feel sorry for the wealthy.
5.)  Bridget is a drunk.  Drunks are pathetic.
I thoroughly enjoyed both books, but I was not impressed by this film with its poor character development, laughable script, and slapdash, ham-handed performance by Zellweger.  Someone ought to tell Americans to STOP TRYING TO SOUND ENGLISH.  The British press did not heavily criticize Zellweger's accent, but I think that was only because they didn't want to hurt her feelings.

1284860,4,B00003CXT7,"This film is an adaptation of the book of the same name (unread by me), the story of a 30-something single woman trying to find love, confidence, and possibly a better job in the Big City (in this case, London).  Instead, she finds Hugh Grant, playing her sleazy boss, and Colin Firth, son of family friends who is an uptight and smug barrister.  Naturally, she chooses the sleazy boss first, then we follow her through a career change, a boyfriend change, multiple lifestyle changes (or, at least, attempts thereof), all accompanied by her loyal and equally single friends.
This sounds like a very formulaic film, but the quirky character of Bridget Jones is carried off wonderfully by (the initially thought to be oddly cast) Renee Zellweger, who is a thin Texan playing a chubby Brit.  Zellweger really gets into the role, including gaining 20 (?) pounds.  Grant and Firth are equally well cast as the competing suitors; Grant as the sleaze has more fun and juicier lines.  In all, it is very funny, and quite universal - I'm sure audiences in America and Australia will enjoy it just as much as audiences in Britain.
The DVD edition is quite nice, with a short making-of documentary (that thankfully is not simply an extended trailer), some cut scenes (some of which are a loss to the film, but others were rightfully cut), a couple music videos (not particularly interesting), and, of course, a director's commentary.  This commentary is pretty good, from first-time director Sharon Maguire, with tidbits on the actors, comments on how the film diverges from the novel, etc.
The only problem is the ending - there are simply too many false crises delaying the happy ending that we know is coming.  Other than that, it's a well-plotted and funny romantic comedy.",1014681600,,1766,4.847176079734219
1284861,5,B00003CXT7,"Avoiding this film in the video stores, I was prompted to rent it when Renee Zellweger was nominated for an Oscar. I've always liked her, from her initial appearance in ""Jerry Maguire"", to supporting Meryl Streep's Oscar nominated peformance in ""One True Thing"". (Everyone admires Meryl, but Renee deserved the nomination). The DVD version is loaded with out-takes & interesting stuff. Then we have the film, itself. I originally thought this might be one of those ""women's"" films and, being a fairly open-minded male, I opted for other fare. Imagine my surprise! This is a film, based on a very specific idea of a single woman's mind. Here is a woman with no idea what she's looking for, listening to her friends who are as desperate as her; to her mother, who's stuck in the 60's; to married friends who are as phony as $2 bills (or pound notes). She's clumsy, inarticulate, overweight; and totally loveable. Renee is from Texas and delivers the most perfect English accent since her former co-worker Streep (in ""French Lieutenant's Woman""). Hugh Grant is smug and more confuident than usual, and Colin Firth seems to play his part not much differently than he did as the scorned husband in ""English Patient"". Good triumphs over evil, after many misunderstandings, love triumphs over all; but it's some of the very sensitive female secret psychological moments that our Renee draws us in; she gives in to despair, drinks a lot, alone at home, and, while channel-surfing, always seems to come across a channel featuring ""animal sex"", whether lions, tigers or bears...oh my...  Overweight, neurotic and totally out-of-touch, Renee Zellweger's Bridget is among the most delightful characters I've seen in a long time. Even ""Entertainment Weekly"" judged her as a long shot for an Oscar nomination because, face it, how do you compete with Alzheimer's, mother's losing children, etc.? This is a thoroghly engaging film with an outrageously courageous performance from the brilliant Renee Zellweger. I would vote for her, if I were able.",1014508800,,2033,5.068656716417911
1284862,4,B00003CXT7,"The movie is great; it made me want to go get the book and read it.  (I highly, highly recommend getting the book it is hilarious.)  There are many differences between the book and the movie.  Most of the time this makes me mad on the author's behalf, however, in this case I can totally understand why they made the changes they made.  Just in case you are interested, the character of Mark Darcy is really underdeveloped in the book.  The movie makers must have felt it imperative to draw more on Jane Austen's portrayal of Mr. Darcy to make the character worth having Colin Firth as its actor, because in the book the character of Mark Darcy does not pop up near as many times as it does in the movie.  There are so many things that the movie adds that were never in the book.  Daniel never lies to Bridget about Mark having slept with his fiance.  Daniel and Mark never have that big huge fight scene that occurs near the end of the movie.  Mark never gets a job in America and does not fly out there for any reason.  Mark also never sees her diary and she never runs after him in her underwear during a snow storm.  Bridget's parents never reconcile.  There is a big part of the book that is left out of the movie and that is where Bridget's mother runs off with Julio and a bunch of stolen money, as Julio is a scam artist.  (For those who have seen Pride and Prejudice this scene correlates with Lydia's running off with Wickham)  Mark Darcy is responsible for then tracking them down and clearing up all the mess that they have caused.  (Just like Darcy is the one who saves the day in Austen's version.)
The character of Bridget is hailed as an every woman, and I think that this is quite fitting.  Bridget is always getting caught in embarrassing situations that are very hard to watch and read about sometimes.  She is a character whom all women should be able to relate to on some level.  She is the kind of character we can definitely laugh with because she is very witty at times and that makes her into a very likable person.",1014508800,,2040,4.309711286089239

She is adorable, likeable, and REAL as Bridget.  I think every woman in her thirties can relate to some aspect of Bridget.  It was refreshing to see Zellweger cast as a real-looking woman, not a stick-thin Hollywood icon.  And she actually looks quite good with the extra weight.

1284923,4,B00003CXT7,"Controversy is the breeding ground of many great films, it seems, nowadays.  While I wouldn't attribute greatness to Bridget Jone's Diary, it certainly managed to overcome great dispute when an American actress was chosen to play the beloved Brittish heroine to become one of the best romantic comedies in years.
The actress in question is, of course, Renee Zellwegger, the star of Jerry Maguire, Nurse Betty, and Me, Myself, and Irene, best known for her ability to make people go ""awwww, she's so cute!"".  And she maintains that status with ""Bridget"", but adds to it a new demand for respect as a serious actress with very broad capabilities, a respect she surely deserves.  Her accent, least of all, is pitch perfect.  It is, however, the skillful way that she transformed herself (not just physically, although she did gain 20 pounds for the role) into this dowdy Brittish spinster, creeping up on middle age, that is so remarkable in this film.  Aaahhh yes, the film.  Better say a few words about that as well.
The mood is light, almost silly at times, delving into the serious only at arms length, a quality most romantic qualities lack (I am not a fan of the dramedy).  The only time this mood changes, is when Bridgets heart is broken, and that is a fleeting period in the movie.
The supporting cast is brilliant, especially Bridgets mother, who is so effective in her role that you just want to shake her and scream, but know you'll be laughing at the same time.  The development of a relationship between the Bridget and Mark is endearing, and heartbreakingly bittersweet. His warm and sullen demeanor is a brilliant contrast to Bridget's neurotic, insecure manner.  They compliment each other beautifully.  The chemistry is there, the plot development is grand, in fact there is only one thing with which i have a problem.  How many false endings can one movie have?  Kiss her already.",1014249600,,1897,4.820987654320987
1284924,5,B00003CXT7,"Renee Zellweger fills in the shoes of Bridget Jones, very nicely thank you! I must admit, however, I was one of those skeptics that wasn't sure how well she would fair in the role from the best selling book by Helen Fielding. To my surprise, and obviously that of many theater goers, Zellweger, mastered her accent and took the part to heart. As the loveable Bridget, she takes us through a year of her life, dealing with her troubles with men (Hugh Grant, Colin Firth) and her job and friends. Hugh Grant is good as the bad boy that treats her shabbily and Colin Firth is good, as well, as the stuffy, but good hearted man that continually crosses her path. This is an excellent romantic comedy for a date or to settle in with some good friends and enjoy. The dvd has some extras, such as music videos, that are a nice addition.

You laugh, you scream, and you get really turned on whenever Colin Firth enters the scene.  What is there about Colin Firth?  The man can enter a room and hold you in the palm of his hand.  Something about his eyes, his voice and the lake scene in Pride and Prejudice.  By the way, if you liked the movie, you MUST read the books.  Fielding's ""Edge of Reason"" aka ""Bridget Jones 2"" will have you rolling.  Hint: Bridge lands an interview with Colin Firth.
Fielding's Wit shines and Zellwegger's acting will keep you rolling.  This is a film you may want to see several times, especially on a girls' night out.",1012953600,5,769,4.482014388489208

Once I got over the initial shock of hearing a British accent coming out of Ms. Zellweger ( it only took a couple of minutes), I was completely sucked in to this woman's life.  I think men will equally enjoy this movie because it gives them some insight into the working mind of REAL WOMEN.  If the inner workings of Bridget's mind weren't enough to keep you interested, the romance is.  OHMiGOD!  Could Colin Firth BE anymore sexy??

1284930,4,B00003CXT7,"What a wonderful surprise this movie was to me.  I resisted it I admit, thinking I wouldn't relate to the plump heroine coping with loveless sex, dueling suitors and haughty English folk.  Yet, not only does the movie sparkle in unexpected, laugh-riot moments, Renee Zellweger proves yet again what a stunning actress she's become.  In the title role, she's silly and coy, at once vapid and brilliant, a heroine for our generation.  Hugh Grant is slimy-sleazy as her boss, a real departure from his ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" Jimmy STewart-ish character.  And, Colin Firth excels as an unlikable suitor who in the end hooks Bridget with intelligence, heroism and a deep warmth that is rarely allowed to shine (ultimately it's Bridget who brings him out of his shell, while exchanging her own for a newer model!)
Ever since ""Jerry MaGuire"" made her a star, Zellweger was dazzled in on screen roles like ""Nurse Betty"" and ""One True Thing.""  This is an actress who is able to fully expose her character - warts and all.  Where other actresses might shy away from brash, bold characters, Zellweger embraces them, and in the process, the audience falls in love.  She has the sort of face that tells stories with small, seemingly unimportant facial expressions.  A raised eyebrow here, a pursed lip there, she's able to convey layers of emotional context and depth that very few of her contemporaries can ever hope to achieve.  Her spellbinding work opposite Meryl Streep in ""One True Thing"" is proof positive this star is here to stay - and deserves attention as quite possibly the best actress of today;s generation.  Very few actresses could ever hope to shine opposite the legendary Streep, but Zellweger does that and more.  In that film, and this one, she delivers a fully realized character, infusing Bridget with wit, charm, charisma, and more than anything - REALNESS.  Ultimately, that's the best thing about this movie - the multiple levels Zellweger manages to pull off will allow even men to see parts of themselves through Bridget's eyes.  Warm, lighthearted, but filled with detail and myriad emotions, ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" is a winner!  Let's hope Zellweger finally cops an Oscar nomination (which she's deserved for other roles in ""McGuire"", ""One True Thing"" and ""Betty"").  At least her fellow actors know a brilliant performer when they see one - as she's been nominated for a Best Actress SAG Award (over Nicole Kidman who was thought of as a shoo in for ""Moulin Rouge."")
In a nutshell, this is a fun, entertaining movie, with great music, endearing moments of comedy, and another SHINING performance by Zellweger!",1012435200,,2632,4.947727272727272
1284931,2,B00003CXT7,"While on the whole this was an enjoyable movie, two things bothered me enough that I am not going to purchase it.  The first was the truly appalling amount of profanity.  Almost every single character is foul-mouthed.  While one character is introduced to us as liking to use the ""F"" word in her speech as often as possible, the other characters use it so often that it really isn't a distinguishing characteristic.  The other thing that bothered me was how much hard liquor Bridget downed while alone.  We're talking literally bottles of vodka all by herself.  It got to the point where I figured that it didn't matter whether or not she ever got married because she'd be dead from cirrhosis of the liver within ten years anyway!  Despite these things, I did enjoy the movie.  The acting was very good, the basic storyline was good, if most of the profanity had been deleted the dialogue would have been great, it was great to see a somewhat more approachable Mr Darcy and it was truly delightful to see Hugh Grant as a villain!

1285013,4,B00003CXT7,"Though inspired by the A&E TV mini-series ""Pride & Prejudice"" with Colin Firth playing a more modern Mr. Darcy in a clever bit of casting, and Hugh Grant's character inspired by Jane Austen's Mr. Wickam, there the resemblance ends. The foul mouthed, drinking and smoking Bridget, who usually can't organize her thoughts to speak coherently when called upon to do so, although she improves as the film progresses, is the direct opposite of the very eloquent Elizabeth Bennett -- also, Bridget has no sisters and has a philandering mom, who runs off with a game show host. This said, the film is very entertaining and Bridget is quite appealing, but there is far too little of the talented Colin Firth until the last third of the film. Hugh Grant is good in his role as Bridget's womanizing boss who had a falling out with Darcy.
Since in the DVD making of the film featurette there is much made of the fact the book and film were inspired by the A&E/BBC production of Pride & Prejudice with Colin Firth as the sexy Mr. Darcy and Mark Darcy is based on Firth's portrayal and deliberately written as his modern counterpart, I couldn't watch the film without making comparisons. And that was a mistake to do because there really is little to compare except Mark Darcy is, initially, as aloof and inscrutable as Jane Austen's Mr. Darcy, if not as arrogant, and Colin Firth was deliberately cast to reprise and update his role. But it is hard to see what Mark Darcy sees in Bridget, and what attracts him to her as we never see his point of view. And unlike Elizabeth Bennet, Bridget doesn't engage him in clever verbal repartee (she's eloquent primarily in her first person narrative and diary entries), so we don't see why he falls in love with her. Firth does provide us with some more those smoldering Darcy gazes, a wonderful smile and great one-liner in the blue soup sequence and, I hope without giving too much away, a terrific kissing sequence sadly missing from Pride & Prejudice. If only we had seen P&P's Mr. Darcy kiss Elizabeth the same way Mark Darcy kisses Bridget. Whoa!!
Overall an enjoyable and entertaining film with perfect casting.",1011052800,18,2147,4.69761273209549

It loses the daily up and down entries referencing the battles with weight, cigarettes and attempts at healthier living, the occasional (and hilarious)drunken postscripts, and some great lines and subplots.

I share the first name of the heroine (though a different spelling).  <p>It was very refreshing to see Hugh Grant as the reprobate instead of the affable good guy he usually portrays, and Colin Firth wearing that ""lovely"" reindeer sweater was practically worth the price of the movie alone.  It was a lot of fun also to see a number of British actors and actresses that I had only seen before in period pieces in ""civilian clothes"".  I wasn't particularly impressed with Renee Zellweger, though I'm not certain if it was her or the script for the part she was playing.  <p>I did think that the script went a little overboard with the ""goofiness"" of the Bridget character.  At first her mistakes were amusing.... after a while it became boring and annoying.  Everyone has had moments where they want to crawl into a hole and die of embarassment, but the film portrays this character's every action as one mistake after another and after a while it simply ceases to be funny.  The audience can sympathize with a character that has ""bad hair days"", but after a while, just plain stupid isn't funny.  The viewer is left wondering what either male lead could possibly find interesting or attractive about Bridget Jones.  I'm not sorry I bought the film - it just wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be.",1010102400,,1454,4.571428571428571
1285018,3,B00003CXT7,"My sincerest salute to Renee Zellweger.  Not that many actresses would be willing to put on weight, dress in incredibly tacky wardrobe, and play such an utterly uncool, verbally clumsy, constantly humiliated heroine.  Yet here she is, taking on a British accent, getting dressed in ""granny knickers"", and tripping on her tongue for the lead role of Bridget Jones -- how refreshing to see a high-profile actress forget vanity for the sake of truth.
Bridget Jones's Diary isn't exactly groundbreaking.  It's a fairly standard, acceptably executed romantic comedy, above-average because of the dedicated Zellweger and two absolutely killer love interests, Colin Firth and Hugh Grant.  Nobody plays a ladykiller slimeball quite like Grant, with his devilish smile, wit, and self-deprecating screen presence.  Firth's clean-cut, straight-faced performance gives Grant his foil.  Alas, script-wise, the touches that made the novel (the first one, at least) stand out are largely missing.  The ""diary"" motif disappears for a good hour in the middle of the movie where plenty of laughs could've been milked (that one use of the subtitle was hilarious); instead, the movie relies on its voice-over, altogether not nearly as fresh a device as the superimposed subtitle.  And it isn't really explained why both men fall head over heels for Bridget because the development of the two love interests is somewhat shallow, so the premise for romance is a little forced.
No matter, though.  You could do much worse than Bridget Jones's Diary to satisfy your taste for romantic comedy.",1009843200,2,1568,5.290322580645161

1285082,5,B00003CXT7,"If you think that BJD is just another chick movie, think again: truth is this film is a masterpiece, a great comedy, witty and hilarious, with a brilliant cast.
Texas born Rene Zellweger is a perfect Bridget: overweight, obsessed with calories, goofy and with a great british accent. Bridget is a 32 year old single who is desperatly trying to follow her New Year's resolutions: quit smoking, quit drinking, loose weight and, most of all, find true love. Which is not easy! Her mother is trying to make her hook up with Mark Darcy (Firth), a stuck up and apparently rude barrister, while she has a devanstating crush on her super sexy boss, Daniel Cleaver (Grant). The two guys couldn't be more different from each other: Daniel is a charming, humorous, flirting guy, ready to lie and cheat at any given occasion. On the other hand Mark looks serious, aloof, but very sexy, in a stuck up kind of way. And during the movie we learn that first impressions sometimes are very wrong! And so does Bridget. As she gets to know her two suitors better her impressions and feelings change quite a lot. It won't be easy for her to decide between the two of them, but it's a pleasure for everyone to see her getting through her life day by day, with the help of her friends and a lot of vodka.
If you have read the book you will find the movie quite different, but you won't be disappointed. Director Sharon McGuire has made a great adaption, full of hilarious gags and incredibly good dialogues.
The strenght of Bridget is not just her being utterly funny, but also her being very different from the usual female characters we have seen in other romantic comedies. She's goofy, she drinks too much, she always ends up saying the wrong thing, but she keeps being herself. And eventually ends up finding happiness by being ""just as she is"".",1008892800,2,1828,4.576219512195122
1285083,4,B00003CXT7,"This is a pretty good movie and nothing like my preconceptions. The hype doesn't do it justice, the diary itself is very different in texture to this movie, and the three main actors are cast  against type. Serious Firth plays a loveable comedy character, honest Hugh plays a bounder, and American Zellwegger plays an English woman. That they all succeed is tribute to their acting abilities as well as the first time director Sharon Maguire.
The DVD features a pretty good commentary from her although her voice grates after a while and it would have benefited from a second voice as she leaves lots of gaps. The commentary is made for the American version of the film, but used on both the U.S. and British discs, so it does not tie up in one or two places with what we see on screen. The extras include a large number of deleted scenes, any of which could have stayed in the film, but which Maguire wisely decided to cut for reasons of timing. I think she was right. The film is 1 hour 31 minutes including credits and to have been any longer would have dragged it out.
The London scenery looks wonderful, and there are some nice crane shots of London and Bridget's parents' snow-covered village. The jokes in the script mostly hit the mark, and just the right amount of 'diary' is included to warrant the title. There is a great soundtrack, especially in the new songs from Robbie Williams, Gabrielle and Shelby Lynne. I confess to being a little mystified by the suggestion that Zellwegger had piled on weight to play the role as she looks perfectly normal to me, and not at all unattractive. I suspect it's a girl thing! The one complaint I have is that we seem to be living in a part of London where there has been no immigration in the last forty years and where only people from the upper-middle classes live. What a curious impression the Americans must get of us!",1008201600,6,1874,4.511764705882353
1285084,4,B00003CXT7,"(...) I enjoyed it tremendously, especially on DVD.  Colin Firth reanimates an updated edition of the stuffy Mr. Darcy character that he so magnetically portrayed in Pride and Prejudice.  There is something so entrancing in the way he engages the audience with those intense brown eyes.
Renee Z. is really cute and believable as Bridget Jones. She has the pale skin and cheeky wholesomeness often seen in British actors even though Renee is an American. Her considerable, innate personal charm adds to a role that, in the hands of a less gifted actor, may have been difficult to pull off. Hugh Grant is, refreshingly, quite thoroughly smarmy in his role as the boyfriend who is basically a jerk. I always enjoy him as an actor, and this film adds a new dimension to his acting chops. His recital of that really vulgar poem while sitting in the boat on the lake where Firth and his companion are also boating and trying to discuss legal matters in their formal and so correct manner is hilarious.  They overhear the recital and watch as Grant straddles the two boats in his attempt to join Bridget in hers and when Grant falls into the water it is a real ""gotcha"" on film.  It was embarrasing, funny and you can tell that the actors were having a ball doing that scene.
This is a fun movie for those times when one needs a reminder about relationships and how they impact one's life and one's mood, good, bad or indifferent. As Colin Firth portrays in this story, at times it is hip to be square.  A cool film.",1008115200,5,1509,4.533088235294118

1285086,4,B00003CXT7,"Bridget Jones Diary evolved from a newspaper column, became a book and then almost simultaneously became a film and a second book.  While Helen Fielding locked herself in an LA hotel room penning 'The Edge of Reason', accomplished screenwriters Richard Curtis (of NOTTING HILL and BLACKADDER fame) and Andrew Davies (PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, VERY PECULIAR PRACTICE etc) hacked about at the first Bridget Jones novel to create the screenplay for this movie.  Fielding had no track record on screenplays, so it was understandable that an experienced professional should be drafted in.  But two??  The end result is something reasonably satisfying, but as a romance it's not as convincing as say, NOTTING HILL, and as a comedy, it's not as funny as FOUR WEDDINGS.  There just aren't enough top-quality jokes spread about the movie -- the writers don't make the most of Bridget's two opportunities to deliver really bad speeches, for example.  I get the sense that if Richard Curtis had been given total authorial control over the screenplay, he would have put more effort into it.
This DVD goes nowhere to explain the resentment Fielding felt about having the two screenwriters brought in.  She is tight-lipped in the interview on the DVD, but the questioning is undemanding.  Fielding has deliberately set the screenwriters an insoluble task for THE EDGE OF REASON, because in that book Bridget Jones goes to Italy to interview Colin Firth as Colin Firth.
As for the other extras on the DVD, it's clear that the editor did a good job: the right deleted scenes were left out of the movie, even if one or two contained a greater sense of the diary feel of the original book.
When I originally saw this at the cinema, the audience, who seemed to be 90% female, enjoyed this enormously.  My main criticism of the plot was that Bridget doesn't provide Darcy with sufficient grounds for falling in love with her.  Bridget seems to win largely through comparison with Darcy's snooty lawyer girlfriend.  We see big leaps in the affection Darcy has for Bridget, and it would have been nice to have had a couple more scenes to smooth out those leaps.
Contrary to all my expectation, Renee Zellweger gives an excellent portrayal of Bridget.  Her English accent is flawless, and she only gives her American roots away by occasionally looking too directly into her parents' eyes.
I liked it.  A good movie, but not a great one.",1007251200,4,2408,4.872549019607843

Which to do first - read the book or watch the movie?

The only place where it fails is in the friends of Brigid.
They are flat and muddled and very uninteresting.
But on the plus side we have injokes with Mark Darcy echoing some of his poses and walks from Pride and Prejudice and a good central performance from Renee Zelweger as the hapless Brigid.
Maybe you will lose a bit of patience with her as she does not develop as a character but this often happens if an actress is mostly concerned with putting on an English accent to the detriment of character development.
You`ll either love it or be completely indifferent - that depends on the amount of interest you have in thirty-something singletons living in London and in Colin Firth as the sexiest hunk of all time.

I had a hard time focusing on the plot because I was wondering the whole time if we're supposed to believe that Brits use the f-word in every other sentence. I remember back when Al Pacino's Scarface was criticized for its language. It didn't bother me in that movie because you expect gangsters to use it.

1285147,5,B00003CXT7,"This is a story about a thirtysomething woman in merry old England struggling to make it on her own in her career, society and romance. Based on the popular novel of the same name, the film relates the events that happen around her in the course of one year, one very eventful year.
  Firstly, she gets to shag her boss and then gets dumped by him for an 'American stick-insect'. Then she appears on national television (or rather her derriere the size of Texas does) sliding down a firemen's pole. Meanwhile she meets and falls in love with a man who is so absolutely wrong for her, he just might be Mr. Right.
  Renee Zelwegger acquits herself most admirably as the overweight but brimming with charm Bridget Jones with her believable but a tad too 'posh' english accent.  However it is the supporting cast that almost steals the film. Colin Firth practically reprises his role of Mr. Darcy in the 1996 BBC production of 'Pride And Prejudice'. Indeed, even his character in this film is also a Mr. Darcy, Mark Darcy to be exact. And it was also quite a pleasant surprise to see Hugh Grant in the villain's shoes this time around. I must say that he does it quite convincingly and thus, my opinion about his acting abilities has changed for the better.
  As for the extras in this DVD, the main highlight would have to be the documentary which contain interviews with the cast and crew of the film. Also, look out for two music videos of songs from the soundtrack, namely Gabrielle's 'Out Of Reach' and Shelby Lynne's 'Killin' Kind'. Really brilliant songs.
  All in all, this is a very funny and well-paced film with good acting all round. If there is anything to complain about this movie, it would have to be that there is quite a bit of profanity which does distract the otherwise intact integrity of the film.

1285148,2,B00003CXT7,"I pushed the eject button on this DVD wondering ""Why on earth would anyone, leave alone a stand-in for Mr. Darcy, want to be with Bridget?
Don't get me wrong, I understand the idea: the main character is lovable despite her flaws, and for once it isn't a Cinderella story about becoming beautiful (read: skinny) when you thought you weren't. She drinks, she smokes, she's kind of a bumbler socially, but she can still be happy, right? She can still find true love. That's a likable premise.
Except... um... why were we supposed to like this woman again?
Hugh Grant and Colin Firth are really fun in this movie. Grant seems to relish his role as the scoundrel, and man, the guy has wonderful comic timing. Colin Firth basically is meant to be Pride and Prejudice's Mr. Darcy -- the character's name is Mark Darcy, and Firth played Darcy in the BBC miniseries version of that book -- but instead of being proud or disdainful, it seems as if the direction might have been ""do your best to bore the audience."" He's a bland, bland guy, Mark Darcy. Firth works through that okay, he's a flawless actor and he can make his limp noodle of a character stand up -- but even he can't rescue the idea that his character would fall in love with Ms. Jones. Why would he do THAT?
This movie's working really hard to make Bridget adorable, to make her haplessness touching. It didn't work for me. Bridget's an ""event magnet""; she's the sort of person things are always happening ""to"" mainly because of how oblivious she is to everything outside her own head. She's self-involved, and things just sort of keep knocking over when she accidentally stumbles into them. The lovable quality just didn't outweigh the obnoxious one. She's really kind of a jerk in several spots.
It isn't Renee Zellweger's fault, she's basically as adorable as anyone going. It's the writing and the directing. I mean, c'mon -- the character goes to a ""tarts and vicars"" costume wearing a playboy bunny costume. When she realizes it isn't really a costumer, she continues to wear her outfit, complete with bunny ears, for the rest of the party and (apparently) all the way home to her flat in London. Hours after her humiliation, she hasn't taken the ears off? That's pretty DANG contrived. Jack Tripper could have stumbled in from ""Three's Company"" at any moment, making lovey eyes at Bridget, and you wouldn't have blinked.
This struck me as just another poor, soundtrack-pushing adaptation of a pretty good pop novel. The DVD includes some of the original ""Diary"" entries as an added feature, and they give you the sense of a bright-enough person who's being endearingly self-deprecating in her journal. That never came across for me.
My advice is to try the books.",1006214400,11,2727,4.719077568134172

Basically BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY is about a single woman in her early 30's trying to get by in everyday life. She's also tired of being alone and is trying to find a man. That's all I'm saying about that. I don't want to give too much away. Anyway, the acting is well done, the plot is great and it's an all around enjoyable movie.",1005436800,,683,4.428571428571429

Zellweger was the perfect Bridget Jones.  In my opinion, this is her best performance to date!  This is a must own DVD!",1005004800,,293,4.0
1285155,5,B00003CXT7,"Unlike other reviewers, I do not believe that Bridget Jones is a role model for women.  She is just too human.  And that is what makes this movie so wonderful.
Although she is an incredibly poor public speaker, Bridget is given opportunity after opportunity to prove the point.  After making an idiot of herself, at a literary party attended by the real Salman Rushdie, and Jeffry Archer, she sleeps with the boss, is royally screwed and then moves on to television.  She lands an on air job with Sit Up Britain because no one at Sit Up Britain ever gets fired for shagging the boss.  There she slides down on a firemans pole, exposes her barely clad derriere to the nation, and is rewarded with a plum current events assignment on human rights.
Bridgets love life is dismal.  Her mother tries to set her up with a dull lawyer Mark Darcy played with understatement by Colin Firth.  (They had to dress him in a ridiculous reindeer turtleneck sweater.  Otherwise the movie would end just five minutes after they meet.  Although gorgeous, he is just impossible to take seriously in that sweater.)  Of course, Bridget has a torrid affair with her boss, played marvelously by Hugh Grant.  He is quite the cad and ends the affair almost immediately after Bridget uses the word L word (love) in a bedroom scene.  Meanwhile, the two male leads have there own history that plays out.
Bridgets single life is attacked by friends and family.  When she goes to a dinner party by herself, she is told that her biological clock is ticking tick tock, tick tock, asked to why there are so many single women over age 30.  Apparently, it is open season on single women.
Romantic comedy has changed a bit since Tracey and Grant, but it is still enjoyable. The casting here is perfect, as is the music.  Sharon Mcquires direction is superb.
Timing is everything, and Renee Zellweger has impeccable comedic timing.  She also has a wonderful believable British accent.  She proves in this role that she can carry a whole movie.
Although I highly recommend this dvd, I would give a word of caution.  Women will laugh first.  Some of the funniest moments may be gender specific.  It is possible that you will have to explain why that is so funny to your date.  If you can overcome that small problem, just sit back and enjoy.",1004745600,4,2301,4.6182266009852215

I was pleasantly surprised to see Renee Zellweger give such a convincing performance as a 30 something British gal. Her accent was flawless (I should know, I'm English). How refreshing to see Hugh Grant play the baddy for a change, a roll he performs extremely well, he makes a great irresistable scoundrel. Colin Firth is excellent (and those deep pools of rich chocolate eyes just make me melt!). He is the perfect dashing English gentleman and is much more likeable in this role than he was in the BBC's adaptation of Pride and Prejudice (on which Helen Fielding based her story, as she states in an interview on the Bridget Jones DVD).
Overall, a great story line, plenty of hilarious mishaps for Bridget, (you'll find yourself feeling embarassed for her) and a lovely fairy tale ending.",1004572800,5,919,4.672839506172839

One thing that I thought was very neat is in the book, Bridget dreams of being with Colin Firth, and he is actually one of the stars of the movie!

Zelleweger played the role of a dumb blond, unsure of what she wanted.  She ended up being torn between two men, unsure of which she truly loved, and which loved her.  It shows her struggle in life to really find out what her own identity is.  Mixed and confused, naive and low self-esteem all characterize Renee's character whose life is full of twists and turns.

1285221,4,B00003CXT7,"This film is another excellent showcase for the talents of Rene Zellweger.  It is a fairly common occurrence for British actors to play American characters with varying degrees of success in duplicating an American accent.  It is almost unheard of for an American to play a British character, and when it does happen the accent is almost always awful.  Zellweger nails both the accent and the demeanor of the quintessential middle class English girl and is absolutely charming in the role.
The screenplay is an adaptation of Helen Fielding's novel of the same name that follows the single life of everywoman Bridget through the trials and tribulations of being a singleton.  Fielding unabashedly admitted in interviews that the original story was borrowed from Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"", going so far as to name one of the main characters Darcy (Colin Firth), the identical name of the corresponding character in Austen's novel.  To complete the bizarre crossbreeding, Firth played Darcy in the BBC production of P&P just before being cast in this role.
Fielding's screenplay is full of the ironic and droll humor that makes English comedy unique.  Bridget is written as such an adorable ditz that you can't help loving her, especially with Zellweger playing the role.  First time director Sharon Maguire does a bang up job of keeping the silliness moving at a rapid fire pace.
Zellweger is perfect for this role and must be commended for expanding her horizons (in all senses of the word).  She packed a great deal of weight onto her normally svelte frame to properly depict Bridget's weight problem.  She then boldly allowed herself to be photographed in various skimpy outfits where flab burst forth from every seam.  Even more important than her excellent English accent is her comic ability to make the most of every peculiar situation with matter-of-factness so natural it is hard to believe that she didn't grow up in England.
Zellweger totally eclipses her male leads in energy, comedic ability and charm.  The normally likeable and bumbling Hugh Grant is sorely miscast as the jerk.  Grant's strength is his sincerity and his character doesn't possess any, leaving him adrift in his ability to interpret the role.  Firth, who has excellent comedic and dramatic skills, is really wasted in a role that mostly sees him leering dourly at Bridget for two thirds of the film.  When he finally gets a chance to interact he is very good in a stuffy sort of way that is right for his character.
This is a delightfully wacky comedy with a fabulous performance by Rene Zellweger.  I rated it an 8/10.  It is peppered with funny truisms about single life that make Bridget's plight one that is with which easy to identify.",1003622400,3,2730,4.927947598253275

Bridget(Renee Zellweger) is a woman working in publishing,who has a crush on her boss(Hugh Grant),who gets her attention thru some not-so-politically correct flirtations. At the same time, her over the board mother tries to set her up with a childhood neighbor (Colin Firth)They instantly do not like each other.

I realize that the target audience is twenty to thirty something females, and being male,  am decidely not in said demographic. However, my girlfiend is smack dab in the center of it, and she to thought this movie was purile sop.
  First off, the script based on Helen Fieldings novel of the same name, is just another exuse to let famous actors, who usually play wholesome, good natured protagonists, act vile and promiscuous. Renee Zellweger, who has been lauded in the press for gaining twenty pounds to play Bridget, looks a lot more normal than she does at her normal malnourished weight. In, fact it surprised me that this movie was not panned by critics for portraying a woman who is slightly more rounded than is the hollywood norm, as overweight.
  Hugh Grant plays a corporate cad who seduces Ms. Jones, then ruins her illusion of love with a super model esque american. Colin Firth has all the acting range of a corpse with severe rigor mortis, but with a tad less charm. This faux love triangle
is played out at a tepid pace, only to conclude with an ending that is so far-fetched, so inane, that it mad me want to scream.
  The whiny, complaining, life-is-so-hard tone of the film wore thin after 10 minutes. It also proceeds to reaffirm the stereotype that a woman can not be happy nor complete, with out a man, a marriage and a few kids. One of the worst films I have watched this year.",1003190400,19,1499,4.509225092250922
1285224,4,B00003CXT7,"The film flows very well (you do not get bored for a second), script is smooth and tight and maintains nice rhytm. All the leading cast is exquisite (and Hugh Grant looks so much better in the role of a heartless two-timing bastard than in his usual application of an oh-so-cute puppy-eyed stammering British nancy-boy), the British home counties accent of the Texan Renee is accomplished and good jokes abound.
However, the book on which it is based is so much more complex and intriguing. It is not the fault of this movie: only so much plot can be crammed into a limited time, and I should have known better than watch a film based on a book when I know already what's in the book.

It was one of those heightened moments in time, when two friends experience the magic of a good movie and come out feeling the same way about it. I had read both Bridget books and fell in love with the sentimentally cynical heroine, her 'Urban Family' and her diametrically opposed suitors. The sheer joy I felt as Bridget slowly bungled her way towards true love was almost as severely felt as when I first read Pride and Prejudice. So, even as I sat in wonder at Renee's swell English accent and Colin's perfect English bum, I couldn't help but think that the movie lacked much of the book's ironic nuance and humor. Well, I ended up separating the book from the movie in my mind, and it worked, because I have a huge soft spot in my heart for this film. As for the DVD version, I am a tad disappointed. The widescreen letterbox makes the characters seem too distant. Bridget's emotional world is so vulnerably in-your-face that to watch it from a distance waters it down. And my disc was slightly out of focus, making me rub my eyes to see if I could see it any better.  But forget about all that!

1285296,4,B00003CXT7,"From the very beginning, when single thirty-something Bridget Jones begins recounting her experience at her mother's New Year's Day party, I knew I was going to like her. In fact, I completely fell in love with ""Bridget Jones's Diary,"" a film that not only takes an upbeat approach to being single (what romantic comedy doesn't at some point?), but also employs some of the most witty, sarcastic, and quite refreshing humor I've heard in a movie this year.
Renee Zellweger plays Bridget, who works at a publishing firm in London by day, and sits on her couch eating ice cream and drinking wine by night. She dreads her mother's parties as her mother always plays matchmaker, so when she introduces Bridget to Mark Darcy, played by Colin Firth, she feigns interest, and is insulted when Mark makes demeaning comments about her.
Setting out to find the right man, she begins a diary, beginning with her New Year's resolution of finding the perfect mate, who, for the time being happens to be her boss, Daniel Cleaver, played by Hugh Grant. For one glorious week, they shag, they laugh, they have dinner, and for a small time, Bridget seems happy. But once she mentions love, it's bye, bye, love, and she's single again, and soon finds herself drawn to Mark, who has a past score to settle with Daniel.
The key to making this comedy work is the casting, which is phenomenally bright. Zellweger is the perfect compliment to the portrayal of Bridget's many awkward moments, and she handles the material with such confidence and humor that her character becomes an instant smash. She plays Bridget not as a whiny, waifish martyr whose emotions are on constant overload, but as a full-figured, witty and refreshingly different single girl who looks at being single the way many of us would like to.
Hugh Grant proves that he is much better when he's playing the twit, and as Daniel, he's given the perfect chance to act as such. Colin Firth is surprisingly effective as Mark Darcy, employing a subtle wit and charm into his character that becomes engaging and, at times, humorous. Each of these actors share a warm chemistry and delightful exchanges of dialogue with Zellweger, selling us on their romances together while keeping the sap to a minimum.
What makes the movie shine is the fact that it strays from the garden variety chick flick agendas and comes out with some very original material. There are inklings of Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" throughout the movie, though most of the material is given a new feel. And instead of being a boring, melodramatic yarn about yuppies in love, it becomes a bright, upbeat comedy about the single life and how one very awkward woman handles hers.
The comedy that emanates from the movie is undeniably hilarious, one of the better comedies of this year. Bridget's situations are funny because she handles them with a serious demeanor. The scene involving her trek down the fire poll is a comedic gem (""Excellent. Am national laughingstock. Have bottom the size of Brazil.""), as is Bridget showing up at an outdoor party in a skimpy bunny suit after the plans were changed to formal wear.
In the end, though, what really makes this movie shine is its lead actress. Renee Zellweger is a wonderful actress, one that brings a new face and a new meaning to comedy. In ""Bridget Jones's Diary,"" she takes Bridget's single life and turns it into some of the most funny, highly humorous moments in recent memory. The material is original and refreshing, and makes this romantic comedy a cut above the rest.",1003017600,2,3543,4.800327332242226

You hate him at first and think he is such a snob and by the end you want to run to your t.v. and kiss him! The movie addresses everything that plagues the modern bachelorette- sex, alcohol, men, weight, dealing with married people, parental troubles...it covers everything!

All the moments you turn into a blithering idiot and the more you try to extricate yourself, the worse it gets.  And while in some ways you feel guilty that you're like this, you really do spend that much time trying on different outfits and worrying about each little item of clothing, each body part.  It's nice to see that in a movie character, because it gives you so much more to identify with than the visions of perfection we so often see.  Sad that we have to hear about how hard Renee Zellweger had to work to get up to a weight most of us have gotten up to effortlessly -- she was great at the part, actually, but why can't we for a change see someone who didn't have to work hard to look like most of us?
That's not a problem with the movie itself, though.  Like I say, Renee Zellweger gives an excellent performance, as does Hugh Grant.  I still don't see the Colin Firth thing myself, but he was good in this.

Toward the end of the film there is a street brawl while ""It's raining men"" plays in the background.  Women in the audience were actually bouncing up and down in their seats and clapping their hands.
Every scene in BJD is handled beautifully and a very good story is told through a very funny movie.
Plus it's fun to see Hugh Grant being a ""naughty man"".
Guys,if you get brownie points for taking your wife/girlfriend to girlie movies... see it, buy it, rent it, whatever.
It's the most (only) palatable chick flick since Notting Hill.",1002758400,3,778,4.557142857142857
1285303,5,B00003CXT7,"A great touch of irony for the single woman on the prowl out there.
Every single woman knows what it's like to have to be looking for the perfect man, and every married woman knows that there
is no such thing as a perfect man.
Excellent humor and touches of irony.
Go BRIDGET!!!!",1002672000,,279,4.283018867924528

For those of you who read the book - watch the movie, it is just as good if not better. And even if you didn't read the book, the movie will make you want to.",1002585600,2,291,3.5625
1285336,4,B00003CXT7,"Let's face it... this is a comedy, and you are not supposed to read more into it... it's just a nice film for laughs, and especially if you are a girl, you will identify with the always embarrasing, many times funny situations Bridget gets into.
The acting is good, now, as I said, it's a comedy, so it doesn't have to be serious, just plain fun!!.. and it is very believable.
I highly recommend this film, because it is funny, you can identify with it, and it makes you laugh all the way through!",1002585600,,497,4.297872340425532
1285337,5,B00003CXT7,"Watching this movie feels like watching my own life story. Always feeling too fat and too often attracted to the wrong kind of guy. Bridget Jones, self-proclaimed 'spinster dan lunatic' takes us into her psychotic, romance-less life through her little diary. The bottom line, if you like Ally McBeal then you will L.O.V.E Bridget Jones's Diary!!",1001980800,7,345,5.178571428571429
1285338,5,B00003CXT7,"Ive always liked Renee Zelwieger and in this movie she was so adorable that she is now my favourtie actress. One could really feel for Bridget Jones who she played
It was comedy but also touching and thoughtful.
I loved the music and thought Colin Firth was superb in the role of the originally pompous but ultimately good hearted Mark Darcey
Hugh Grant's character was a slimy and shameless cad and enjoyed seeing his face punched in
I absolutely loved it",1001721600,9,456,4.6419753086419755
1285339,4,B00003CXT7,"Brilliant adaptation of Helen Fielding's acerbic novel about the day-to-day life of the titular boozing, smoking and somewhat ungraceful little lass played with career-topping zeal by Renee Zellweger (who manages her Britishness perfectly). In adapting her novel to the screen, Fielding and her two colleagues (which include her good friend and Four Weddings and a Funeral scribe Richard Curtis) have pared down her witty but sometimes repetitive novel, keeping in the best moments, and amalgamating some of the others to even greater effect. Zellweger is matched ably by her two co-stars, in one corner the sexy but vile Daniel (Hugh Grant), and in the other corner the stiff but always-too-honest Mark Darcy (Colin Firth, a brilliant riff on his Darcy character in Pride and Prejudice), both of whom are vying for the lady's attention. Bridget Jones is unapoligetically embarassing, self-destructive and has no willpower, and for all those reasons she's more real to her viewers than anyone seen on film before. Watch it again so you can catch all the funny bits you missed the first time.",1001635200,6,1091,5.169491525423729
1285340,5,B00003CXT7,"This is one smooth piece of work. There are no surprises, but it's so well done that this doesn't matter. Grant and Zellweger are perfectly cast (Zellweger is so perfect that you forget that she's an American, and she looks ""real"" with the extra weight, although by no stretch of the imagination could she be considered fat.) I don't think that you need a synopsis of this movie, and if it sounds like something you might like, you definitely will. It's probably going to become a holiday tradition in our house (along with ""Home for the Holidays"" and ""Miracle on 34th Street"").",1001548800,,578,4.676470588235294

1285343,3,B00003CXT7,"This is a very enjoyable experience: Zellweger is really something special, the inversions on expectations are nicely done and lend a valuable moral, some of the comedy is quite stellar. The major drawback is only that the surprise twist of the end is quite patently forseeable at the more genuine surprise twist of the middle. Why Ms. Jones does not see the obvious in the middle can only be chalked up to a plot necessity and not human reasoning capabilities as practiced in the real world. Hence the whole late middle portion of the film I couldn't identify the least with her conflictedness, already clearly apprehending the bit of knowledge that would erase that conflictedness. So, I couldn't feel with her again until the end, when she finally got things straight as even a child could have a forty-five minutes or so earlier. Dramatically, I was already quite a bit lost by then. But I liked the end, the spin on romance, Hugh Grant's performance for reasons I won't mention out of fear of wrecking some of the plot.
A well cast, well played, well written, well intentioned film about characters who are welcomably fresh and interesting for the romantic comedy genre.  Just one harmful miscalculation in plot timing that hurt it a bit for me.",1000080000,,1250,4.787037037037037
