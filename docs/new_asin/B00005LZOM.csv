7944482,5,B00005LZOM,"This is a suspenseful movie with a surprising good ending. Scott Bakula is a remarkably gifted actor who was in the skin of his character all the way thru. If you are a Bakula fan, this movie is one to have in your collection.",1419465600,,226,4.159090909090909

7944485,5,B00005LZOM,"This is one of the best DVDs I have bought on Amazon. I like the fact that it has English subtitle, not like many that have subtitles from other languages, and not English, or don't even have subtitles at all. The quality of the video is excellent. It was delivered fast. Great item. It is worth for the money you pay.",1320451200,2,318,4.229508196721311
7944486,5,B00005LZOM,Interesting storyline.  Writing is not the best.  Scott Bakula's acting can make much more out of mediocre material. I did enjoy the movie.,1312502400,2,139,5.0
7944487,5,B00005LZOM,"Annabella Sciorra (The Hand that Rocks the Cradle), Scott Bakula (Quantum Leap, American Beauty) and Ed Asner ((Up!) star in this thriller about the perfect husband in a perfect family living in a perfect suburban town who might actually be a mafia hitman on the lamb. Sciorra plays the trusting, faithful wife who begins to realize the father of her children is definitely NOT who he says he is. Unlike most of these kinds of films, you believe the way each of the characters behaves and therefore have to stay with it 'till then to find the truth. Very tightly directed, too.",1291507200,3,577,4.666666666666667
7944488,5,B00005LZOM,"""Above Suspicion"" offers both a plausible plot and realistic character portrayals. The dilemma of the story becomes apparent when a family man's (Bakula's) past comes back to haunt him, consequently tearing his life and his family apart. His wife (Sciorra) becomes more and more unsure of her husband as the story progresses. ""Above Suspicion"" has the qualities of an intense psychological thriller, as well as a heart warmer. It's a must see for almost any movie fan. Just don't confuse this ""Above Suspicion"" with the film starring Christopher Reve!",996883200,29,551,5.202247191011236
