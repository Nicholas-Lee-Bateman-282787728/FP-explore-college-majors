6085878,5,B00GM1X2RO,Finely heatvof rhe night series on dvd. Still one of the best dramas on tv. I hope seasons 2 &3 and 6 & 7 will come out before years end.,1391212800,,137,3.6

6085880,5,B00GM1X2RO,"The TV series of In The Heat of the Night is the best TV series of all time. I have never saw a bad show. They had the best actors & actresses of all. I love Bill, Bubba, Parker, Jamison, Sweet,Tibbs, & the rest of the gang. The best entertainment TV ever had was this show. Season 4 is an excellent DVD. I'm trying to collect the whole series. I have season 1, season 8, & the marathon, & now season 4. I will be watching for the rest of the series on DVD. I'm so glad this show came out on DVD. I will never be bored. I takes my DVD's with me to work. Thank you for making this series available. It's the greatest!!",1388448000,4,617,3.9047619047619047
6085881,3,B00GM1X2RO,This appears to be inherent in all these DVD releases of this series. Episodes titles are sometimes so badly messed up grammatically and with spelling errors that it is a little difficult at times to realize what the episode really is named. I get the feeling that a bunch of grade school kids were hired for the job of writing the package descriptions.,1388188800,3,353,4.619047619047619
6085882,3,B00GM1X2RO,"WARNING MISSING EPISODES ON SEASONS 4 AND 5!!!  While I love this show, I am puzzled and a bit upset that 2 episodes will be left off season 4 and 3 episodes are left off of season 5. Is this because 5 years from now they will offer one of those complete series packs so that to get the missing episodes we will have to dish out even more money!!!

So be warned. But having said all that the show is great It takes on a ton of social issues. Racism is always just under the surface of every episode and many episodes takes on that issue. There is a good mix of off beat humor. This adds some relief when dealing with sensitive issues.

A great show but missing episodes!!! See the website ""tv shows on dvd"" for the reason for the missing episodes as well as a list of the missing episodes for seasons 4 and 5.",1386892800,18,809,4.0754716981132075

6085906,2,B00GM1X2RO,"I recently ordered ITHOTN Seasons 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, & 7.  The DVD packages are very cheaply made.  Many broke in transit or when being packed and the DVDs rattled around in their cases along with broken plastic bits damaging the read surface of the discs.  For about 25% of the DVDs the damage was so severe that discs don't play properly - producing skips, stops, and player failures.  Additionally, as mentioned elsewhere here, many episodes are missing - presumably because of outstanding copyright issues.  Poorly manufactured, incomplete product not worth the investment.  I really enjoyed the original series, but this collection of discs is a major disappointment.",1434758400,3,668,5.08256880733945

6085928,5,B00GM1X2RO,In my opinion in the heat of the night is one of the best police shows of the last 80 and early 90s. The cast enhanced the shows quality of a small southern town.

6085950,5,B00GM1X2RO,"My wife and I just love this TV series.  We were very happy to see some more episodes released, and for the whole season this time (minus a few shows with licensing issues).  We purchased the past collections that had a few shows from each season, but it was really nice to finally get a whole season at a time, even with a few repeats from prior collections.  We did have to ask for a replacement set due to one of the discs popping loose and rattling around in its case, which scratched it all up so that it wouldn't play.  It was the last disc in the set but luckily we found it just before the 30 day return period ended and we had no problem getting a replacement from Amazon, which is a policy that keeps me coming back to Amazon.  The shows were all excellent except that we haven't yet seen the replacement disc which is currently on its way to us in the mail.  We're sure those episodes are just as good at the others.",1392940800,2,927,4.150837988826815
