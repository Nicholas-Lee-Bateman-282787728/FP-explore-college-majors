8103258,4,B000E0LLQS,"Saw this on tv and it touched me.  Focuses on all sorts of folks who came from all over the world to live in the US.  I am giving it to my sister in law for her birthday, since she loves Norway, because it features a bit on the people who moved here from Norway and why they moved.  Recommend the video and the seller. Very easy transaction!",1397433600,2,341,3.985294117647059
8103259,5,B000E0LLQS,"This PBS series was excellent because it underscored how many groups came to America NOT to discard all their own traditions to ""become American"" but because they could be themselves here, without persecution. A German historian who's a good friend of mine says that the most prototypical American immigrants were Amish and Mennonites, because they came, basically, to be left alone. Of course, the genius of America is some people continue their traditional ways but others weave their traditions into the American fabric, so that we benefit from their cultures and their gifts. Perhaps we should call immigrants not immigrants, but ""investors,"" because they're investing their social and intellectual (and sometimes financial) capital in America, and we all reap the reward!",1369872000,3,776,5.421487603305785
8103260,3,B000E0LLQS,"This was a really typically good PBS documentary that took contemporary stories of immigration and fed them back into history.  The first and last episodes were particularly good.  The first episode looked at the current issue of Mexican immigration and then looked at the long history of specific group immigration to the US through a clever lens (Norway, China, Mexico, Ireland).  I really enjoyed their look at Norway and Ireland and the way that they juxtaposed the Nativist Movement of the late 19th century with current anti-immigration sentiment. The last episode was also really good, focusing on the experiences of female immigrants and the shocking situations they escape to reach some idea of freedom.  As a history professor and an immigrant myself I thought this series was really great - easily accessible for students, nice personal stories, and good historical context.  I'll be using it in my Freshman US history classes for sure.",1246492800,5,947,5.163398692810458
8103261,1,B000E0LLQS,"With the PBS Banner I expected a quality product. This is not. It is boring, slow moving, not worth watching. A total waste of money. I would have liked at least something on Ellis Island. There was a lot of repeating, and repeating. Tells individual stories, but not well.",1196208000,5,273,4.591836734693878
