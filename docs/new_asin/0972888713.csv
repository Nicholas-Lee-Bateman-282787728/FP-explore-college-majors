173871,5,0972888713,This breathtaking film details the history of Buddhism in Tibet going back to Padma Sambhava.  It has an awesome soundtrack with flute music by Nawang Khechog.  The yogis that appear on this film were once sworn to absolute secrecy but have agreed to these rare interviews and demonstrations of their practices to record their vanishing culture for posterity.  This is quite simply the best and most profoundly moving film on Tibetan culture and Tibetan buddhist practices available today. Om mani padme hum.,1073606400,46,508,5.170731707317073

7794526,4,0972888713,"One should separate culture from spirituality.  The practices necessary for spiritual realization are deeply embedded in both Indian and Tibetan culture and inwardly they are one and the same, sprung as they are from the same source.  All culture is subject to change and all that is born must also perish (call it renewal).  By receiving sanctuary in India, the Tibetans have an opportunity which they are using to save their most precious teachings.  Don't get me wrong... I completely disagree with the chinese (small ""c"" intended) occupation.  But as far as the film is concerned.. it drums up more of an emotional response than a deep, insightful understanding of spirituality and practices.  Despite this, the film is well worth watching.

Paradoxically, and as the film points out, it is because Tibet has been occupied, that Tibetan monks are now found all over the West, teaching and spreading the message and practice of spirituality to a hungry and wanting audience.  Who says that their true culture is being destroyed...!!!

Destroy this temple and a new one will spring up elsewhere...!",1403481600,,1100,5.066666666666666

To have such sharing of spirit is truly unusual and a blessing in great measure. The commentary and history was ok and they didn't need to offend the yogis of India with the ""sideshow"" comment.
Thank god these Tibetans are still alive here today.
It would be a sad moment in change if they had been completely eradicated from the earth. May they live long and prosper, for all of our well being.",1352505600,,551,4.411764705882353
7794528,4,0972888713,"""Yogis of Tibet"" is a wonderful documentary on the few remaining Tibetan yogis that voluntarily decided to show and explain their secret and exclusive practices.
After a detailed description of Tibetan religious history from Padmasambava's religious revolution and the introduction of Buddhism in Tibet with the integration of the Bon religion, there are beautiful scenes of the retreats and caves utilized by yogis for meditation. A series of interviews with the Dalai Lama (by the way he is very humoristic affriming he would never want to be a yogi !) and yogis from Tibet and abroad explain the nature of yogi practice and exercises, meditation tecqniques and the deep transformation of the mystic's life after the three year, three months and three day retreat.

There is an impressive section on the meditation with physical exercise of a young yogi never filmed before, which is alone worth all the movie.

I looked for this movie after having read many things true or false on Tibetan yogis. It must be remembered that many Europeans heard of Tibetan yogis from the false monk Lobsang Rampa that with ""The Third Eye"" described apparently incredible feats performed by yogis. I must say that I have not been deluded because this work is accurate, gripping and illuminating.
Mystical experiences are common to many religions and methods to acheive a meditation state are usually consistent (fasting, elimination of external stimuli, isolation, etc) among various beliefs. The uniqueness of Tibetan yogi practice resides I think in the systematic and structured approach to this discipline that can be achieved after years of serious training. One of the points the movie wants to make is that this kind of religiosity is at danger of disappearing now that Tibetan monks live out of their mountains and isolated monasteries and partake in modern world in the United States and other Western countries. However, this ancient practice still has much to teach modern man.

Another important aspect consists in the compassionate approach that is absolutely necessary to undertake this kind of meditation and the great importance given to mind-body interaction, that consents to obtain a perfect control over even the autonomous nervous system. Voluntary emanation of heat has been scientifically demonstrated in some cases.

For a filmographic description of a yogi retreat see ""Samsara"", even if in this case the consequences are far from what is expected.

The movie is never didactic even if the instructive intent is evident throughout. In conclusion, a lively and instructive mind opener documentary.",1237161600,2,2606,5.2548076923076925

7794530,4,0972888713,"I purchased this DVD as a teaching resource for my undergraduate Asian religion and philosophy course, and it was a good choice overall.

The film begins with the stock introduction to Tibetan Buddhism, praising the Tibetan people for their culture of peace and compassion and protesting their treatment at the hands of the Chinese government. It leaves the usual storyline behind, though, when it explores the teachings and practices of the yogis, those rare individuals whose commitment to awakening is so strong that they live in caves, charnel grounds, or in other forms of ""extreme retreat"" for years or even decades. The viewer is given a look at some of those practices that have been hidden (for good reason---some of the energies worked with can be dangerous without the guidance of someone who's been there and done that) and gets to meet some interesting characters.

My only complaint about the film is that the producers of the DVD failed to take advantage of the digital technology to create chapters. The viewer must fast-forward through the movie to get to a particular scene. Other than this drawback, though, the DVD is an excellent resource for anyone who wants to learn more about the esoteric side of Tibetan Buddhism.",1202256000,8,1239,4.980676328502415
7794531,3,0972888713,"The producers of this film claim to reveal for the first time on film secrets of Tibetan mind masters, the titular ""yogis"" that spend years in solitary retreat practicing meditation and physical exercises. Unfortunately, there is very little revelatory in this film for anyone but a complete beginner to Tibetan Buddhism.

Nearly every introduction to the topic contains at least passing mention of yogis able to levitate, to communicate psychically, to see past lives, to peer into the future, or to control the death process. No such abilities have ever been documented by standards of modern science and there are no such feats documented in this film.

There are the usual uncorroborated second and third person reports (none from disinterested, non-Buddhist, non-partisan sources) of yogis exhibiting some of the powers mentioned above. One segment pretends to document the ability to generate extreme body heat, a power practiced by one of Tibetan mythology's great yogis, a man who was said to be able generate enough heat to cause steam to rise off his clothing after it and the yogi had been dipped into nearly freezing water. What the director shows us is a 5-second shot of a thermal scan of a mediator. There is no explanation of what is being shown. No wet clothing. No steam.

Perhaps the most interesting segment is a young monk practicing an acrobatic breathing exercise, one that he says took him two years to master and that he practices two hours daily. From a seated full-lotus position, the young practitioner extends his legs and launches himself into the air, rising about a meter off the ground. He quickly refolds in mid-air to the full-lotus, landing as he started. There's nothing at all paranormal or supernormal about his practice as captured on film, but as you watch him you can image where claims of levitation might have once - ahem - arisen.

A question addressed in the film is to what degree these yogis are following the Buddha's ""middle way."" Having nearly starved himself to death in the search for enlightenment, the Buddha denounced as pernicious the practice of austerities, in which he saw the counterpart to the pursuit of sensual pleasure. It was shortly after again consuming food and returning to a ""normal"" state of health that the Buddha attained enlightenment and promulgated the ""middle way"" as the ideal method for living and for attaining enlightenment. In what way are the yogis discussed in the film - men who for three years live in caves, sit in boxes to keep them upright, deprive themselves of sleep and eat only a subsistence diet - in what way are they practicing a ""middle"" way? If their way is not extreme, what is? Perhaps the answer is in how you define your terms. Unfortunately, the topic is not discussed, nor the question raised in interviews with the yogis.

If you know nothing or very little about Tibetan Buddhism, The Yogis of Tibet might serve as a useful introduction. You get a 20 minute recap of Tibetan history and its brand of Buddhism, you get some great shots of the Himalayas, you meet some of the great living religious leaders from the Tibetan tradition, and you learn that not all their claims are verifiable to outsiders. Not surprisingly, the American producers of the film (Phil and Jo Borack) are Buddhists practicing in the Tibetan tradition.
