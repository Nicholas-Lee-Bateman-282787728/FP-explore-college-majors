8567330,1,B00BEM211E,"I like documentaries, and Tesla is an interesting man whom I wanted to learn more about.  This DVD was not the answer.  It is a DVD of a hand-held camera video of an author giving a slide show and lecture of Tesla's life at a hotel conference center, with the author's own commentary about a trip he took which resulted in a book he wrote (his PHd dissertation), which he is peddling during his lecture!  At the beginning, audience members are passing before the camera taking their seats!  Many times, the author is describing a slide that the audience can see and we cannot, because the camera is on him instead of the slide screen. The fact that Amazon sells this 'dvd on demand' is ridiculous and not worth the blank DVDR it was recorded on.  A high school kid could have given a better presentation!  DO NOT BUY THIS !",1362873600,5,823,4.417218543046357
