8082082,4,B000B64U0O,"""Africa Addio"" is well worth the cost, documenting the change from Rhodesia to what ultimately became Zimbabwe, which will be similar to America's future if current policies remain in effect.  And it's nice to be able to watch this film in its entirety, rather than the censored version of ""Africa Blood & Guts,"" and also to hear it in English (as opposed to subtitles).  It is interesting to see what happened back then, as it helps us put the current situation into perspective.  The tragic dispossession of the white people's land, taken from them and auctioned off; the brutal murders that ensued; the mercenaries that were brought to restore order; the Arabs who were chased into the sea by the blacks; the animals that were slaughtered by white poachers after the disorder began; the half-wits in the streets who rioted; the negative depictions of whites in government-sponsored slides; the aftermath of the violence, with dead bodies piling--these are all things caught during the filming of this documentary, which few people would dare to do today.  ""Africa Addio"" is dangerous in that it doesn't throw on the heaps of political correctness (though there is a certain extent of it) but, rather, shows the whole, dark picture.  ""Goodbye Uncle Tom"" was, essentially, the director's response to accusations of ""racism"" (for documenting the truth in ""Africa Addio"").  They felt it necessary to ""redeem"" themselves by making an anti-white flick, which has a scene of a black on the beach visualizing killing white folks and babies--a ""bit"" twisted (though going hand-in-hand with today's PC-climate).  And this is the reason why I don't give the combination of videos a 5-star, as it would've been better if it were bundled with ""Mondo Cane"" rather than the politically correct ""Goodbye Uncle Tom.""  ""The Godfathers of Mondo"" is somewhat interesting, as it shares the directors' perspectives on these and other cult-classics they've produced, and the film also shows clips of their projects to help keep it interesting.  I have to disagree strongly with the other person who calls these films ""boring,"" as they're quite the opposite; but I don't know what he's watching in comparison that could make such a film ""boring.""",1196899200,9,2225,5.09065934065934
8082083,1,B000B64U0O,"Damn I cannot belive I was stupid enough to buy this crap! Mondo Cane sucks! Mondo Cane 2 sucks! Women of the World sucks! Africa Addio sucks! Goodbye Uncle Tom sucks! The Godfathers of Mondo, well after all that I did not even watch it. None of these films are shocking they are stupid and boring. Mondo Magic is actually a shocking movie and is very well made. But these movies in both Vol 1 and 2, I was dumb enough to buy both, suck!",1193443200,,437,4.152941176470589
8082084,5,B000B64U0O,"The two ""Shockumentary"" releases from Blue Underground are an excellent way to get their entire out of print Mondo Cane collection, for a great price.",1190592000,5,150,5.04
8082085,2,B000B64U0O,"This is only the second half of ""Mondo Cane"" collector's edition, and deffinitelly doesn't deserve the first half of it's title! There's nothing shocking inside.
So much time Antonio Climati's work ( whith or whithout Prosperi and Jacopeti) is left out, there is nothing worth the label "" Shocking "".
The only value of those wrong labeled "" Shockumentaries"" from Vol 1 and Vol 2 is Historical. And if you are interested in History of docummentaries, the buy all the set , not only halfs!",1183161600,,487,4.741176470588235
