8247864,5,B0012UR3BG,"This program is one of a 12-part series about predators.  It is superb!  It debunks the common myths about bats and sets the record straight about how important bats really are in sustaining ecosystems.  Every high school kid in America should see this!  All 12 programs in the series are great, but this is one of my favorites.  Highly recommended!",1425168000,,349,4.75
8247865,5,B0012UR3BG,There are not that many videos on bats to be found and when rating this video I still could not find a video to purchase.  If you want to learn about bats and own a video of them this would be a video to own.,1392336000,,208,3.6222222222222222
8247866,5,B0012UR3BG,"A fascinating look into the world of bats.  Highly educational, includes some talk with a biologist about how bats play an integral role in biological succession and forest regeneration.  Also shows how some people harm the bat populations by eating them.  Excellent videography.  Chiropterans are feared and under-appreciated.  As a biology teacher, I find this video very helpful in helping people understand the importance of bats and their necessity in maintaining the world as we know it.",1236384000,,493,5.35064935064935
