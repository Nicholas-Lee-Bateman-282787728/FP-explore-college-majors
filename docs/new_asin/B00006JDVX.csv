1780434,3,B00006JDVX,"Oscar Wilde's play, ""The Importance of Being Earnest"", is arguably the late 19th Century's best comedy of manners. The newest film version is pleasant and enjoyable, but it lacks much of the comic timing so necessary to giving proper delivery of Wilde's witty, acerbic lines. Admittedly, the work has lost some of its punch over the years because society has changed so much. The class system may not have entirely disappeared, but it has certainly mutated. Perhaps the movie would have been funnier had the filmmakers put more emphasis on the characters' eccentricities and less on their quaintness.
Algy and Jack [Rupert Everett and Colin Firth] are good friends. Algy is an upper-class gentleman with no money, and Jack is a middleclass guy with lots of it. In pursuit of women, Jack uses a different name in the city, while Algy calls himself something else in the country. Algy wants Gwendolyn [Francis O'Connor], but he isn't good enough to suit her mother, Lady Bracknell [Judi Dench]. Jack is after Cecily [Reese Witherspoon], whose guardian happens to be Algy. Much trickery, game playing and confusion results, right up to the requisite happy ending.
The charming, talented cast is obviously having a grand time. If Oscar Parker's direction had been sharper, the audience would be having a grand time, too, rather than merely a good one.",1037750400,3,1347,5.017857142857143
1780435,1,B00006JDVX,"Two film versions of Oscar Wilde's IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST are now available on DVD.  If you know nothing of the play or subsequent movie versions of the play, you might wonder, which is best? Which should I buy? Should I buy both of them?
The version of EARNEST released in 1952 stars Michael Redgrave as Worthing (father of Lynn, Vanessa, and Colin Redgrave; grandfather of Miranda and Natasha Richardson, etc.), Dame Edith Evans as Aunt Augusta, Joan Greenwood as Gwendolyn, Margaret Rutherford as the woeful governess, and several other fine stage actors of 1950s England.
The 1952 version is 95 minutes long and presented as a stage play with a few outdoors settings.  If you want to see the play as Wilde probably meant it to be seen, this version is the one to buy. The dialogue is snappy and smart, the humor dry and witty, the actors are filled with zest. Not only that, but the 1952 version is a Criterion DVD with `digital transfer' and historical notes.
The second version of EARNEST, released in theaters a year or two ago, and listed here, stars Colin Firth as Worthing, Rupert Everett as Algeron, Frances O'Conner as Gwendolyn, Dame Judi Dench as Aunt Augusta, Anna Massey in the Margaret Rutherford role, Reese Witherspoon as Cecily, and Edward Fox as Algeron's underpaid manservant. If Wilde knows about this version, he is probably spinning in his grave in Pere Lachaise.
The dialogue (Wilde wrote) is virtually the same in both films, and the actors for the most part are great actors, but something has gone missing from this version. I love Colin Firth, but he is dismal as Worthing. I am ambivalent about Everett but he is the best thing in the newer film (and why I gave it one star). Anna Massey is fine, I loved her as George Sand's mother in IMPROMPTU, but after seeing Margaret Rutherford play the role of the wayward nanny-turned-tutor she's pathetic.
The new EARNEST plays like an old record on warped speed compared with the Michael Redgrave film. Wilde's witty dialogue moves so slowly, the repartee is as flat as fallen souffle. On top of that, what is a knight in armor doing in this play? Did the screen play call for this bit of nonsense or did the director decide to borrow elements from a few other films! For example, in several scenes, Firth (Worthing) gives an almost repeat performance of scenes from PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. I could forgive the ripoff of P&P in BRIDGET JONES because that film is a satire on P&P, but in EARNEST it simply doesn't work.
The action in the newer version is V-E-R-Y S-L-O-W compared with the Criterion version. Did the director slow the action because he thought ""monolingual"" Americans would understand the words better?? How stupid, GOSFORD PARK did just fine. Those of us who patronize British films and the BBC understand British accents --
and many of us can identify accents by class and locale. Gee whiz, if you can follow the dialogue in East Enders you can follow anything.
If you're a drama student and can afford both versions, buy both versions. In this case actions do speak louder than words and you can discover for yourself that great script and actors aren't the only ingredients in a good film-the director matters.",1037404800,18,3205,4.741935483870968
1780436,4,B00006JDVX,"Oscar Wilde's THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING ERNEST continues to enjoy the top shelf of popular comedies.  It is written with great wit, irony, memorable lines, dextrous manipulation of the English language, and delicious entertainment.  When the cast for this reincarnation of the comedy on film includes such luminaries as Colin Firth, Rupert Everett, Judi Dench, Tom Wilkinson, Anna Massey, Frances O'Connor, Edward Fox and (yes...) Reese Witherspoon, then the product promises to be the penultimate presentation.  The acting is superb, the story goes forth, but somehow the pacing and most especially the atrocious musical score add unwelcome lead to an otherwise brisk and fluffly drawing room comedy of errors.  But in the end the perfection of Wilde's writing and story wins out.  A welcome surprise is how well Witherspoon adapts to a British period piece.  This is definitely one of her best performances and shows promise that she will probably have a healthy, lasting mivie career.",1037232000,5,985,5.282051282051282
1780437,5,B00006JDVX,I have seen both the old version and this version of the classic and I must admit that I think this 2nd version is far better.  The same dialoge was used but the timing was so wonderful in this version that I got all the jokes and the characters seemed much more real.  The scenes were wonderful and i just felt they did a wonderful job in their casting for the roles.  All I can say is WOW!,1036022400,,391,3.9871794871794872
1780438,5,B00006JDVX,"Having never read the book, and only aquainted with Oscar Wilde through seeing ""Ideal Husband"" on my sisters recommendation (a comedic success and one of my favorite films!), my husband and I went to our local theater to see the stage production of ""The Importance of Being Earnest"".  We laughed the whole time and were captivated by the wit and humor of the lines.  Needless to say, when ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" came to the movie theater we ran to see it.
I can not say enough GOOD about this movie.  It was almost line for line from the play, and the characters seemed to be made for their parts.  It took me a while to get used to serious, stone-faced Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth) being the playful, funny ""Earnest""/John, but he was wonderful in the part.  As always, Rupert Everett (the cute, wonderful, and funny Arthur in ""Ideal Husband"") lived up to my expectations and BECAME ""Earnest""/Alganon.
I would HIGHLY recommend that you watch this movie--over and over!  If you enjoy dry humor and wit, you will love this movie.  You have to listen closely to catch all the puns and one-liners, but they are so funny when you do.  One of my favorite parts of the movie is when Alganon shows up at John's house and the next 20 minutes of the movie are spent with John trying to get rid of his unwanted houseguest--the lines are classic.  My husband and I have been quoting them ever since we saw the movie!  I can not wait for it to come out on DVD--I will be the first in line to purchase it.  ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" gets FIVE BIG STARS from this reviewer!! *****",1035244800,5,1579,4.447916666666667
1780439,5,B00006JDVX,"Very entertaining, engaging and delightful film. This is a marvelous adaptation of Oscar Wilde's play, which is a very witty tale. Honestly, I laughed -out loud- (howled, actually) in the theatre. Most enjoyable film.

1780448,5,B00006JDVX,Oh Oscar Wilde how you slay me! This movie is hilarious and so well written. Based on Oscar Wildes book by the same name. Of all the versions done over the years this is my favorite. Colin Firth slays and Dame Judith Dench.....forget it! So many awesome moments. By far the funniest would be them fighting over biscuits. Everyone should watch this movie. It's smart and really witty sarcastic and absurd all at the same time. Fabulous!,1504828800,,435,4.662337662337662

1780450,4,B00006JDVX,"First there was the Oscar Wilde play. Then there was the (1937), (1952), (1974), (1985), (1986), (1992), and now (2002) movie. Each version and adaptation brigs with it its own plusses and minuses.

The story takes place in the late 1800's London but it could be anyone any where. Jack Worthington an upstanding gentleman in the country leads another life in the town as Earnest, his fictitious brother. Seems like he is not the only one with a clandestine life. Both men have a love life that hinges on being ""Earnest."" This story is more interested in relations and lack of and fortune and the lack of.

On a personal note I found this move quit enjoyable. At first I was curious as to how they would adapt the play and what the different actors would bring to the story. Soon I was just wrapped up in the fun.",1503532800,,812,4.442953020134228

1780460,2,B00006JDVX,It really lost something from the earlier versions. I can see what they were trying to achieve but Lady Bracknell is what makes this play sing. Joan Plowright was the perfect Lady Bracknell. I love Dame Judi Dench but she fell short of Ms. Plowright.,1490486400,,250,4.5777777777777775
1780461,2,B00006JDVX,"A sad injustice done to a wonderful play. As originally conceived by Wilde and when staged as written, ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" is an elegant, tautly structured, and hilarious comedy of manners. As interpreted by Oliver Parker it becomes a mere caricature of the play.

Since originally a stage play the dialogue is naturally the focus. And Wilde's effervescent dialogue is replete with subtle ironies and foreshadowings.  Parker's use of filmmaking technology -- such as the addition of action sequences, frequent scene changes, and Algernon's improbable arrival at Worthing's country house -- is a distraction rather than an enhancement. Parker has given us a cluttered, expansive backdrop into which so many engaging details fade and become lost.

In contrast, Asquith in his screen interpretation keeps the settings and characters contained, as on stage, thus keeping our focus on what they say. Drawing Room Comedy works best when kept in the drawing room.

""The Importance of Being Earnest"" is one of my favorite plays. I've seen multiple productions on stage as well as Asquith's film a number times. Parker's version suffers by comparison. I came close to giving it only one star, but decent acting just barely dragged it into two star territory. But if one is looking for the real flavor of Wilde's wit, I suggest looking elsewhere.",1490054400,3,1350,5.1506849315068495

So why does it fall so flat? Is it Reese Witherspoon's weak performance and unconvincing Brimitation? Maybe...but she's not AWFUL. I hated it the first time because I hated the addition of the scene about the tattoo. This was NOT in the original version and I though it was a horrible condescension to today's moviegoers. Even though it turns out that such ladies often DID get tattoos in such a way, I still find it jarring and inappropriate.

I will admit I hate it less with each viewing, though that's not a great recommendation. I will point out that the Blu-ray version (it's Region B locked, so beware) has stunning picture quality and did enhance my viewing experience compared to the DVD.

1780499,4,B00006JDVX,"No question Oscar Wilde was a witty, sardonic, provocative tweaker of late Victorian English mores and morals. In the end his then over-the-top private sex life did him in as the prudish side of English life that we have all come to hate (except those few who dote on the royal family and their fundamentally boring pursuits) beat down this talented man in hell-bent Reading Gaol. The 2002 film adaptation, there have been early ones, of Wilde most famous play, The Importance Of Being Ernest, captures on screen part of the reason why he has endured as an astute social critic of the late Victorian pall.

Whats in a name? Well quite a bit if you follow the story line of the film. Rural bound land-owner and guardian Jack (played by Colin Firth) who yearns to escape to London as much as possible and Algy (played by Rupert Everett) who tags along with him in hothouse London are the best of friends, best of male-bonding bachelor friends. But Jack in London is going under the war name game of, well, Ernest as he pursues young Gwendolyn, the charge of very upper-crust Lady Bracknell (played by Dame Judi Dench) who we shall find out started out life not with a silver spoon but with a nice ass and used that hard fact to entrench herself into high society via a very convenient marriage to milord, some milord did it matter as long as the title was sound and maybe the property taxes were paid.

Of course marriage and the property settlements associated with marriage among the upper crust was a very serious proposition in those days (still is if you look beneath the democratic veneer of the Mayfair swells these days particularly in London) and so an easy target for Wildes wit. Marriage, good marriages came at a price. Hence the spoof of marriage by making such a thing as a first name, an earnest ernest first name as a requirement of marriage assent by both the young women Gwendolyn and Cecily (played by Reese Witherspoon) must have had a lively ripple effect on those London audiences who saw how cheeky Wilde was being in putting them on. In the end, naturally, romance, light-hearted romance will win out but the game here is the repartee between and among the parties until we get there. Alls well that ends well. Nice.",1464134400,,2238,4.606516290726817

If you like Oscar Wilde, you can safely give this a pass, because I guarantee you will be disappointed.  Wilde's dialog is far funnier.  I'm surprised that the big name stars in this were willing to do this movie!

If you have not read Oscar Wilde's play or are not a fan of Wilde, you might find this movie mildly entertaining.

You can read the play for free at Project Gutenberg.  That is probably a better use of your time.",1457481600,,535,4.3

It feels as if Wilde would approve of everything - the entire cast really ""get"" how to be these hilarious, self-important  (but endearing) upper-class Edwardians ( I hope that's the right era), without stepping off the edge into full-blown Monty Python lunacy (not that there's anything wrong with that).  Wilde's plays demand so many rapid-fire throw-away lines, and in this production, everyone's delivery and timing really work together  - I expected Mr. Everett to shine in this (and he surely does), but who knew Mr. Furth or Ms. Dench could be LOL hilarious? same goes for Ms. Witherspoon's fantasy-fed ingenue.  The leads do a beautiful job of playing off one another, and even the bit players threaten to steal scenes with a quick glance.

The production itself is full of wonderful, unexpected choices, like Ms. Witherspoon's fantasy tableaus (based on Edmund Blair Leighton, maybe?  You know - all those ethereal,  wavy-haired maidens draping themselves over knights clad in perfect armor, who stoically put up with it) - gorgeous, but very, very funny.  Singing by people you would never suspect, but that (oddly) works, too.",1453766400,,1161,5.1005291005291005

However, this is still wonderful entertainment, a romp through silly English mores and a roller coaster ride through the attendant misunderstandings.

Dialogs are pretty faithful to the play and they are really well interpreted by Everett (Algy), Firth (Jack), Judi Dench (lady B.), etc. all characters are really funny and if you like Wilde and his humor/ irony, if you like nice costumes and decor you should watch this movie not always tender with the Victorian morality and principles.",1444867200,,624,4.831775700934579

This 2002 version directed by Oliver Parking contains additional scenes added to the original play that do nothing to improve it. On the contrary.

1780665,4,B00006JDVX,"This isn't a movie I normally would have chosen to watch, but our housemate needed to do so for college. The plot itself is, of course, a ripoff of old Shakespeare plots like Comedy of Errors--with the main character leading a double life--that being said, there were some fine comedic moments, memorable lines, and interesting plot twists. All of the actors did an exceptional job with their characters, and the script writers produced  what was, on the whole, a quite funny movie based on very old plot devices.

The casting was excellent--Earnest, like all the other characters, really suits his role in this movie. The costuming and cinematography were very good, and the whole movie seemed to be true to life--I could actually imagine something like this happening in the real world LOL. Truth is, after all, far stranger than fiction. Overall, if you're looking for a good light comedy that doesn't require a lot of deep thought, this is an excellent choice. The live streaming service also works extremely well here at Amazon--we had tried streaming this movie elsewhere online first, and had trouble with buffering and freezing.

BUT absolutely no one can ever surpass Margaret Rutherford's Miss Prism in the original.  Rutherford was in a class by herself.

I have watched the DVD several times--only with repeated viewings does one appreciate what a comic genius and satirist Oscar Wilde
really was.  I am reminded of his observation on fox hunting:  ""The unspeakable in pursuit of the uneatable.""  We need someone of his caliber today--our contemporary society is no less in need of skewering than was Wilde's Victorian milieu.",1414022400,,789,5.39344262295082

It has more in common with British television comedies like Keeping Up Appearances than films like Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, etc. where the characters are well-developed, and the dialogue and humor are witty and subtle all at the same time. Except Keeping Up Appearances is actually funny, and I didn't laugh once through this entire film.

If it were not for some of the cast, I might not have finished watching it (surely Firth and Dench's talents could have been put to far better use). Again, not being familiar with the source material, I'm not sure if the writing or the general storyline was at fault.

On a positive note, the set designers and costume designers did a fabulous job, making the film something of a visual treat. If you are interested in a lighthearted comedy, and plot isn't terribly important, give it a try. It just wasn't my cup of tea.",1404000000,2,1066,4.720430107526882

Beautiful cinematography and costumes and super acting by most, but Witherspoon's and Everett's mediocre performances and several embarrassingly silly scenes were a turn-off.  Of course, you just can't go wrong with Judi Dench, Colin Firth, and Tom Wilkinson, but even these fine actors couldn't save the scenes that should have ended up on the cutting room floor.

1780826,3,B00006JDVX,"Sometimes I ask myself whether this classical piece of English-Victorian comedy, Oscar Wilde's masterpiece and one of the most original and funny theatre plays I know (and I do know some) will ever be adequately turned into a film. Once more, the high potential was destroyed by mistakes which nipped all good intentions in the bud.

Just for a starter, one couldn't say that there is anything with this film that doesn't really work. The actors are well-chosen and play well, the costumes rich and exact in detail, the film paces well and never gets boring, and then there are... the settings. These have more than irritated me here. In the original text they change little (we have Algernon's apartment, Jack / Earnest's country house outside and then inside); and although the many different settings in this film almost all look great, they are too much - both too many and too beautiful, making you feel almost as if you were watching a fairy tale.
And that is precisely the point: ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" is a sociocritical, very exactly observed satire, not a fairy tale or a love story where all that matters is whether the two couples will find one another in the end. The marvellous pictures have an irritating tendency to distract the viewer from the actual content: the brilliant texts and dialogues, the characters portrayed with gentle tease, prejudices, clichs and relationships which were so typical for the society Wilde belonged to. While reading the play I laughed much more during one act than here during the whole running time.

My guess is that the producers thought that today's viewers will not be in a position to understand the - rather more than less - subtle hints and side blows to the time and society this story is set in. That may be true, but the play did not win anything by being sugar-coated, on the contrary. I suggest everyone who is interested to watch the film once and then to read the text with friends in the different roles, and you will soon see that the whole plot will become much funnier. Or, if you want to save time, just spare yourself this film. It was supposed to be a comedy, but that's exactly what it is not.",1391817600,,2175,4.661458333333333
1780827,5,B00006JDVX,"The story begins with two friends that each create a person who is not real. Algie pretends to be Jack's ""invisible"" and incorrigible brother Earnest, and Jack uses Algie's ""invisible"" and invalid friend Bumbery for blackmail against Algie. Both are in love with sweetly idiotic and lovely girls, and they find the roadblocks to matrimony are many.  Judy Dench is perfect as the matronly aunt who holds court.

1780841,5,B00006JDVX,"I've read and seen the Oscar Wilde play many times over the years, but this film version is a particularly funny farce. The actors look as though they had a thoroughly enjoyable time making it. Each one brings his/her character out to the fullest. It was great to see Dame Judith Dench play Aunt Agatha, and to see Colin Firth and Rupert Everett at times behave like brothers about 10 to 12 years old was just plain fun. The added dream sequences to show that the pure Cecily had more on her mind than her studies didn't detract from the actual play, and Reese Witherspoon does an admirable job of portraying her. In fact the best thing about this film is that all of the actors do an admirable job, including Anna Massey and Tom Wilkinson. They bring nuances to the characters of Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble that I've not seen in any other performance.  Massey's portrayal of a spacey Miss Prism, who abides by all of the rules by which a governess must live, but dwells in her head and her idealism so much that she does the improbable. She loses a baby by putting him in her handbag and misplacing it; and though she regrets it, it is the return of her handbag that gets more response from her than the discovery that the baby (now an adult) is safe. Wilkinson makes the audience truly empathize with his shyness. Though this film has been around a good while, I recommend seeing it if you haven't and seeing it again, if you have. Go ahead and watch ""An Idea Husband"" (another Oscar Wilde play) with Rupert Everett, as well. It's more serious in tone, but still a comedy, and both of these films are filled with witty dialogue.",1389830400,4,1631,4.4366666666666665

The old argument of movie versus the original probably does fit in this instance, as I read other reviewers distaste under one-star comments.  However, for a person who by all accounts is quite ignorant of Oscar Wilde's talents (but not his person), I found it delightful.  In fact, it has become a wonderful introduction into his work, which will only incite me to read more.

Probably what struck me the most was the lighthearted story that had me laughing out loud on my green recliner in front of the television.  There were other times that  I gasped as I heard certain lines that stunned me as an author.  One in particular:  ""The very essence of romance is uncertainty.""  It became one of those author moments where you think - ""I wish I would have written that line."" Actually, there were quite a few lines.

For me, it was a five-star introduction into a enjoyable story.  I thoroughly enjoyed the fantastic cast.  Since they are all well-known British actors, (except for Reese born in New Orleans, who keeps trying to perfect her British accent) surely they must have found something entertaining in the script to have agreed to do the movie.

Parker has taken several liberties with Wilde's text and stage directions to make a film that would be more relevant to modern audiences. However, in his adaptation, he has lost much of what the play has to offer its readers. Asquith, on the other hand, has retained more faithfulness to the text, and therefore, has retained the major themes and contrasts between earnestness and hypocrisy. Asquith retains the timeless and endearing language and many of the terse witty epigrams that Wilde provides for the reader without trying to instill an artificial relevance to modern society. Instead he creates for his audience a dialogue not only between the audience and the characters of the film, but also between the audience and Oscar Wilde that will last long after the film is over.

I watched this to for a literature assignment I had to do, but I still enjoyed it. They used an all British cast, as England is where the play is set, with the exception of Witherspoon. The acting is top notch.",1382572800,,339,4.230769230769231
1780903,4,B00006JDVX,Colin Firth with Reese Witherspoon were great in this movie.  A feel good - romance movie.  I will buy it for my library and watch it when I want a break in my weekend down time.,1382572800,,178,3.9166666666666665
1780904,4,B00006JDVX,Enjoyed the movie but I felt at the end they had made a mistake. Jack was the eldest of the two brothers as that is why he had his father's name. The movie suggested he was the youngest. I watched it again just in case I had made a mistake. It is still a great and funny story. I recommend it.,1382486400,,293,3.819672131147541

1780906,5,B00006JDVX,"The crisp and sparkling humor of Oscar Wilde is clearly evident in this terrific portrayal of his well-known play.  The actors,  led by future award winners Judi Dench and Colin Firth, are masterful in each of their roles.  Subordinate players such as the butlers are just as integral to the story as the leads.  Jack Worthing (Earnest), played by Firth, is attempting to live a double life and finds himself in a dilemma when he is found out by his friend, Algy (played by Rupert Everett).  Love and happiness ultimately prevail in this witty play as the viewer enjoys the colorful twists and turns of this delightful film.",1382400000,,624,4.7407407407407405

1780908,4,B00006JDVX,Judi Dench and Colin Firth have a lark with this spoof of...everything. So much fun. Some say it's thin. no doubt. But British humor of teh era was clever and urbane. Done with the same feeling as G&S.,1382227200,,201,4.315789473684211

The cast is perfect, the dialogue fast paced and smart, and the humor makes fun of  old british 'high society' norms / customs / styles. You'll need to keep your wits about you to keep up with the story as it takes some twists and turns. Fun and silly, and quite heart-warming in the end.",1380240000,,385,4.1891891891891895

1780930,4,B00006JDVX,My teenaged daughter and I watched this an we both found ourselves laughing our selves silly on many occasions.  The comedic timing is great and the characters really well done.,1379808000,,177,4.9
1780931,4,B00006JDVX,"Light, cute, funny, quirky movie. I imagine it was a movie based on a play that was based on a book, I'm not sure but that's the feeling I get. Stellar cast with solid performances from all involved.",1379808000,,199,4.2631578947368425
1780932,5,B00006JDVX,"Today our American culture tends to sexualize all adult entertainment.  In fact, ""Adult content"" usually means ""SEX"".  I'm an adult and I find that kind of content boring in the extreme.  I'm not a  teenager any more.  I don't find it entertaining.  This film was adapted from a play written by someone who was deemed the sexual pervert of his day:  Oscar Wilde.  He was actually imprisoned for being gay.  He was also married with children, but that seemed to be beside the point at the time.  He seemed to have seduced the son of a powerful man, so he had to be put away for the good of society.
Now, these many years later, the works of Oscar Wilde are like breaths of fresh air compared the programing offered every day in every medium of American culture.  The early evening air network television is practically x-rated, lacking only full-frontal nudity -- for that you can go to the cable network.
""The Importance of Being Earnest"" the play has been a staple of the high school drama department repertoire.  I missed out in the many performances I knew of while I was in school myself, so I was looking forward to seeing this film.  I was highly entertained.  The cast was seasoned and skillful.  The wit was, of course, outstanding.  Oscar Wilde is matchless.  I don't want to say more.  There must be a sexual subtext and there is, but it isn't full frontal.  There is something to be said for subtlety.  I appreciate it.",1379721600,,1430,4.533333333333333

1780936,5,B00006JDVX,"I love this play, and the movie adds a bit more fun, interpreting some of the finer points with fun visuals.  My favorite speech by Aunt Augusta (about the handbag) is made even better by the setting of the scene and all of the business involved in that.  The visuals are stunning, and I love the song the guys sing to the women.

I think even someone who doesn't like historical plays would love this movie.  It's a good introduction to the language that Wilde uses.  Think of it as a gateway movie.  You know you want to watch it.  Just a little.",1379635200,2,548,4.262135922330097

1780940,3,B00006JDVX,"I usually find good British comedy to be witty and charming in a way that American and other countries' types of comedy aren't able to be.  This movie was only 1/4 witty and 1/2 charming, in my opinion, and the period costumes and lovely English settings were the main pull into the movie.  The acting was probably fine, but depth and timing within the characters and their interactions were lacking.  I'm not a movie expert, though.  I know only what I like, and there were a few times that I almost turned off this movie.  I'm glad I finished watching it and found out some background.

1780946,5,B00006JDVX,"Ok, it might be difficult to not compare the movie to the play that the movie is based on.  It seems that most of the negative reviews are comparing the movie to the play.  However, if you look at the movie as just a movie though, you might find it quite enjoyable.
Without giving away the plot or spoilers, as you can read those somewhere else, the movie is a light comedy with great acting.  The banter between the characters is hilarious in the ""dry intellectual English"" way.  (This is not slap-stick humor.)

This is an amazing cast- Firth is spectacular as Jack Worthing!  If you aren't used to Oscar Wilde material, this might take you a short while to get used to.  His writing is brilliant, and there is wit and depth to every line (not an exaggeration).

The acting was superb and the storyline was entertaining and feel-good.  Oscar Wilde went all out with the dramatic irony - he really was a brilliant writer.  Overall, it was humorous and heart-warming. A great way to spend a couple of hours.",1375056000,,373,4.537313432835821
1780994,5,B00006JDVX,"We rented this from our library for our first viewing, and then we HAD to buy it! I haven't read the original play, so I don't know how accurate it is, but accurate or not, this movie is FUN, ENTERTAING, and WITTY. I'll go over a few of it's best points:

1) the cast is brilliant. Rupert Everett especially. And the charaters are great by by themselves- Ms. Prism ""Itellectual pleasures await you my child."" Algy- ""I can hardly eat muffins in an aggitated manner, can I? The butter would probably get on my cuffs.""  Jack- ""... and I don't intend to have a brother, not even of any kind!"" The hilarious lines go on...

2) the story is clever. Basically it is as follows: Jack Worthing has invented a wayward brother ""Earnest"" so that he can have fun in the city without anyone knowing; Algy has invented a invalid friend ""Bunbury"" so that he has a convenient excuse for getting out of social engagements. When Algy learns about this ""brother"" he goes to Jack's country home, and under the pretence of being ""Earnest"", becomes engaged to Jack's ward, Cecily. Jack comes home, and after announcing that ""Earnest"" is dead, finds Algy there. Gwendolen, the woman who loves Jack but knows him as ""Earnest"" comes. Pandimonium ensues. The story ends after they sort out who's not ""Earnest"", and Jack discovers that his last name is not Worthing.

3) it's VERY funny, and the music is great. The humor is abundant, and the music is a ton of fun, even if it's not totally in line with the set time period.

This movie is great. I highly recommend it.

Jack-- ""I really don't care for the name of Earnest, I don't think it suits me at all.""
Gwendolen-- ""It suits you perfectly! It is divine name, it has a music of it's own; It produces vibrations...""",1374451200,3,1741,4.511111111111111

In fact, the late great Jim Varney doesn't show up in this film AT ALL! It's just a bunch of prissy English actors prancing around and talking all fancy-like.

They really emphasize the silliness of the play. I love the dialog and the utter ridiculousness of the entire situation. The actors are fantastic. Rupert Everett is magnificent as Algernon. But the all tie best scene is where Everett and Firth sing. There are two servants carrying around a piano for Jack to play and it is great.

Gwendolyn - I am very fond of you, Cecily; I have liked you ever since I met you! But I am bound to state that now that I know that you are Mr. Worthing's ward, I cannot help expressing a wish you were- well 42 a little older than you seem to be- and not quite so very alluring in appearance. In fact, if I may speak candidly?
Cecily - Pray do! I think that whenever one has anything unpleasant to say, one should always be quite candid.
Gwendolyn - Well, to speak with perfect candour, Cecily, I wish that you were fully forty-two, and more than usually plain for your age.

Not that millions aren't in love with The Three Stooges, but I don't usually care for that kind of humor, myself.

The actors are all very talented and did their jobs well, so they weren't the problem. Actually, the dialogue was the star of the show in my opinion.  It was full of complicated sentences with deliciously disdainful, upper-class words that few people ever bother with anymore. Not in the age of Twitter and text messages. It was a real treat to hear and nice to have to exercise my brain. It was a real disappointment that some of the sentences were slurred. British dialogue apparently requires no facial expression or moving of the lips, so the words aren't always intelligible in a movie that has background sounds to interfere. What a shame.

The story itself is the most witty piece of writing I have ever read, and to see it so perfectly brought to the screen is such a delight. I watched the older version that is on instant watch on Netflix, and even that one doesn't compare.

This movie is silly, and outrageous, and yet the actors created such a fantastically natural illusion of being totally believable. I find myself laughing out loud throughout the film.

- Oliver Parker has done a great job streamlining the dialogue of the play while keeping Wilde's sophisticated wit intact.

- Rupert Everett and Colin Firth have a great chemistry, especially evident for example when they sing the ditty ""Lady Come Down"" (Oscar Wilde poem set to music by Charlie Mole)

- Judy Dench as Lady Bracknell

- A great, fun, family movie suitable for all ages

Cons
- Serious Oscar Wilde purists no doubt will find countless pedantic put-downs to criticize this adaptation, but then again seriousness is the only refuge of the shallow.",1332115200,2,567,4.864583333333333

1781060,2,B00006JDVX,"I purchased this after reading the book, which I found charming and was anxious to see it on screen. I am a fan of both Colin Firth and Reese Witherspoon, so despite some of the poor reviews of their acting in this film, I went ahead and purchased the movie. I should've listened to those reviews however, because Firth plays a horrid Jack Worthing! He plays Worthing the same way he played Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice, which is all wrong for Jack's character. And as much as I like Reese Witherspoon, she just didn't catch the essence of Cecily at all. The dialog - which was sharp and witty in my head reading the play - is just dead in this movie version. Too slow for sure, but it's missing something else, almost like the actors just didn't ""get"" the humor (maybe forgivable for Witherspoon, who is American, but what is Firth's excuse?), or maybe it had to do with the director, I don't know, but the fact remains this movie just doesn't ""work."" The tattoo scene, especially, which is not in Wilde's play, struck me as a bad attempt at perhaps adding a little sex appeal to draw a younger crowd. Was there anything to smile about in this movie version? Rupert Everett played a pretty good Algy, as did Tom Wilkinson as Dr Chasuble and Anna Massey as Miss Prism. The sets were beautiful, but none of this makes up for the lack of spark among the main actors (particularly Firth and Witherspoon) and the mishandling of the dialog.",1331596800,5,1439,4.475285171102661
1781061,3,B00006JDVX,"'The Importance of Being Earnest' is one of my favorite plays and I have watched several stage versions over the years. I attended a  badly acted and mediocre stage version a few weeks ago and decided that I needed to watch the film version.  I could not find the Anthony Asquith 1952 version so I watched this one. The 2002 version is not a bad film though it is a reinterpretation. It is definitely much better then the staged version I attended. However it lacks the panache that makes Oscar Wilde's original such a joy to read and see on stage. Under Oliver Parker's direction, the original play has been transformed into a very well made visual adaptation with much of the original words of the play intact. I did not mind very much the many changes the director made to visually hint at the lifestyle that Wilde was satirizing with words.  Some changes, particularly at the very end of the film, might even be seen by some as an improvement. However the changes, visual and eye-catching as they are, seem out of place at times in a play known for delightful wordplay. The addition of such things such as a hot air ballon, a motorcar, and the extravagent  opulence of the rich in Victorian England is overdone and not in keeping with Oscar Wilde's intentions in the stage play.
I understand that the intent of this version was to adapt the rigid stage-bound play to the openness of modern film. The original play was set in 3 scenes in 3 acts. Oliver Parker moves the play outside and to various indoor locations to capture the essense of Victorian England. He does this very well.  Visual clues are substituted for much of Wilde's dialogue. In my opinion a bit too much.
On a more positive note, the visual interpretation might inspire viewers to read the play or see an original staged version.
This is not a bad film. It has the look of a good TV movie and is worth viewing. I suggest that people interst in Oscar Wilde read the play first, then see a good stage production or get the 1952 Anthony Asquith version, then see this film.

1781070,4,B00006JDVX,"Having seen this play performed onstage (and enjoying it immensely), it was with some trepidition that I approached this cinematic version.  Film and stage are two entirely different beasts, and success in one venue often gives disappointment in the other.  While I generally enjoy live theatre more (especially comedies), I'm happy to report that this is a reasonable adaptation of Wilde's play.  If it ultimately plays better in a live theatre, the director and actors have given us a film that we can enjoy any time, i.e. when we don't have access to a live production.

Much has been made in some reviews that Wilde's ""precious language"" has been altered.  This is often considered a cardinal sin with Wilde, as the language IS the play.  Not having studied the play, I can't comment line-for-line on the veracity of the film version, but the rhythm and delivery are perfectly acceptable.  There are pieces drawn from the 4-act version (rarely performed), and some strange fantasy inserts to demonstrate Cecily's flights of fancy, but neither are distracting and, I think, they add to the cinematic quality - a movie needs to be more than just a filmed stage play, after all.

The story is set firmly in Victorian England, but continues to carry a resonance with audiences today due to its themes being rooted in universal human nature.  To wit: Algernon and Jack are friends, and each have an alternate life that allows them to escape the duties and stresses of their normal life.  Algy has invented ""Bunbury"", a fictional sick uncle who he has to care for, as a means to avoid unwanted social engagements.  Jack plays the role of Earnest, his own fictional brother, which allows him to be a degenerate when he comes to town to blow off steam.  One thing leads to another and at one point both Jack and Algy are pretending to be Earnest to different people, and both are engaged to different girls without their respective guardians' consent.  Ultimately it is a comedy of manners and social embarassment, at times no more sophisticated than an episode of ""Three's Company"", but it is always very funny.

I mentioned the 4-act play (as opposed to the usually performed 3-act version) because there is one curious omission in the film.  In the excised act there is a scene where Cecily and Algy (pretending to be Earnest) are so busy recording the events of their lives in their diaries that they forget to actually LIVE their lives.  It reminds me very much of the current fad of spending so much time tweeting about your life that you aren't really experiencing it.  This scene would add a contemporary satirical twist that Wilde never envisioned, but would serve to emphasize that this is a story of universal human nature.

Finally, a word on the performances.  Dame Judith Dench plays Lady Bracknell, the larger-than-life aunt of Algernon (often, at least at the Stratford festival, played by a man in drag).  In every scene that she's in she steals the show, and when she is not present (through much of Act II), the show seems to lose momentum, as if Colin Firth (Jack) and Rupert Everett can't keep up.  They are two actors that I normally enjoy and who can each steal their own films (e.g. Bridget Jones's Diary and My Best Friend's Wedding, respectively), so it's a little disappointing to see.  To sum up, this is a competent production.  The DVD is not particularly interesting (it is relatively bare-bones), but this is not the kind of film that needs a bid DVD box set.  I would still recommend seeing The Importance of Being Earnest live, if possible.  I just think it works better as a play.",1309392000,3,3611,4.757624398073836

1781076,5,B00006JDVX,"Oscar Wilde is undoubtably a great witty playwright and his play The Importance of Being Earnest is properly considered to be one of his greatest productions. All of the actors in this film capture the spirit and wit and acceptable silliness of the play, and it is well worth while viewing it.

Two men think that they need to use false names. One calls himself Earnest whenever he leaves his country home and goes into the city to have fun. The other uses a fictitious name to escape the social affairs that his aunt insists that he attend; he says he has to visit his (fictitious) sick friend. The first is in love with the second's aunt's daughter, who, as previously stated, knows him by the name Earnest. She tells him that she loves him, but could not love him if his name were not Earnest. She even tattoos the name Earnest on her behind. Hence, the importance of being Earnest if she wants her as a wife.

There are other humorous and witty elements in the play. The aunt refuses to allow her daughter to marry ""Earnest"" because he is a foundling. Thus ""Earnest"" needs to find out who are his parents. Also, the nephew is curious about ""Earnest""'s eighteen year old ward. He goes to the house of ""Earnest,"" who is known at home as Jack, and claims that he is Jack's brother Earnest. The ward, who is quite flacky and a dreamer, tells him that she will marry him because she adores his name ""Earnest.""",1287964800,,1408,4.453488372093023

1781082,4,B00006JDVX,"For being a motion picture production directed toward a large audience (rather than aficionados of British Literature), I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the screenplay and the loyalty to Oscar Wilde's intent. It is true that some changes were made [see below], but as a whole, the film resembled the play quite well.

Colin Firth (A&E's Pride and Prejudice) and Judi Dench (Cranford) both were quite enjoyable to watch in their roles of Algernon and Lady Bracknell. Rupert Everett and Reese Witherspoon (Miramax's Vanity Fair) additionally performed well in their respective roles.

I did experience  2 instances where the DVD skipped. The first instance was just after the butler says, ""I didn't think it polite to listen."" However, the skip was only a few seconds. The second instance where the film skipped was about 2 minutes later for diration of what appeared to be a few frames. Therefore, the skipping was minimal but still something to consider. [PS: I am not certain whether the skipping signifies an inferiority in the DVD itself or if it denotes some problems in the transfer to DVD. If the later is the problem, than hopefully, the DVD will not become worse after I play the DVD numerous times.]

For individuals very interested in (or obsessed with) Oscar Wilde's ""The Importance of Being Earnest,"" I have listed below a few aspects about the film which I disliked:

1.
At 97 minutes, a large amount of dialogue is cut from the production. While the film attempts to keep most memorable lines, the changes and omissions might disconcert a passionate fan of Oscar Wilde because they do mitigate the wit of the original play.

2.
The setting and pace are changed for quite a large number of scenes. Some of the changes in setting, I believe, enhances the film. Other changes, however, detract. Additionally, by creating a greater visual focus, ever fewer words are spoken, and they even more slowly than in any other adaptation of which I am acquainted. Therefore, the film becomes boring at times, when the quick repartees are not quite so quick as they should be.

3.
A few elements of the plot are changed from the play, although I suppose one could argue that they are possible conclusions that might be read into the play. For example, in this film adaptation, Lady Bracknell is portrayed as an actress who becomes pregnant with Lord Bracknell's child before the couple's marriage (i.e. that the pregnancy is the impetus for the marriage). Also, in this film adaptation, John Worthing's real name turns out to be John Moncrieff, with John pretending that it is 'Ernest.' I didn't find these changes particularly humorous.

In conclusion, while I DO RECOMMEND this 2002 film adaptation, I personally prefer the following made for TV adaptations, which follow the original play more closely:

- the 114 minute Consolidated Productions adaptation with Wendy Hiller as Lady Bracknell  [view on YouTube]
- the 110 minute BBC 1986 adaptation with Joan Plowright as Lady Bracknell",1275696000,,3002,4.950298210735586

This misguided version of Oscar Wilde's well-loved stage play suffers from poor direction at every turn.  The sets and costumes are too brightly colored, the actors are too tanned and robust, and their mannerisms are so distinctly modern that one never believes it's the 1890s.  One really vulgar addition to the original has two characters getting their beloved's names tattooed, colorfully, on their bums.  *shudder*

Colin Firth and Rupert Everett are both handsome, but they don't capture the period and they often mumble, which is unforgivable since the language is the best part of the show.  The two young ladies are sadly miscast:  Although Reese Witherspoon does a respectable English accent, she has to work so hard at it that it's distracting and she looks very 21st century.  Frances O'Connor as Jack's love interest is pushy and unlikable.  The real star of the film is Judi Drench who displays the perfect regal elegance and snobbiness her part requires.

The movie is pretty boring until the last 30 minutes, when all the (supposed) wackiness of two men calling themselves ""Earnest"" finally starts to make sense and several coincidences pay off.

1781091,3,B00006JDVX,"Wilde was present at the final dress rehearsal of his play and after watching the performance commented that he thought it was really splendid - indeed, in places it reminded him of a play he'd once written called The Importance of Being Earnest.

I had the same feeling after watching this DVD.  The cast is talented and capable but the direction is entirely wrong for Earnest.  The director has interpreted Wilde's lightweight comedy of social manners as though it were realist drama.  As such the vast majority of lines are thrown away and the ridiculousness inherent in Wilde's script - the self-mockery - is largely lost. Only Judi Dench and one or two supporting cast members manage to push past this misdirection to provide moments of truly comic relief.

Earnest is a difficult play to stage because it reads better than it sounds; but the same is true of several Noel Coward plays and a good director can bring these off successfully so long as the style is correct.  One can only hope that Earnest will be re-filmed at some point in the future by a director who understands how to interpret this kind of material.

in making the period work. In contrast to the British Rupert Everett and Judi Dench who have it, they just don't.

But Oscar Wilde makes frivolousness more charming and substantial than anyone else ever has, and he has no better living disciple than Rupertt Everett.

 Everett perfectly captures the sly, self-indulgent charm that makes Wilde's story such escapist fun and the rest of the cast catches his infectious appeal.  Reese Witherspoon and Frances O'Connor strike the perfect balance between romantic naivete and haughiness.  Colin Firth, as Everett's ostensibly more responsible friend, plays off him perfectly. And as always, Dame Judi Dench commands every scene she's in.

One thing that has bothered me about every Oscar Wilde play put to film so far is how dry and flat they portray his work.  His plays are light hearted and fun, not serious and boring.  I was hoping this film with its impressive cast would finally get it right.  Nope.  I will say it is better than most but Rupert Everrett comes off as creepy (my 7 year old niece ran from the room) and mumbles most of his lines.  This movie does attempt some of the goofy spirit of the play but it often comes off as dark.  It has all sorts of weird accents like hot air balloons or tattoos that I like but may bother some people.  It definitely is not period accurate if you care about such things.  The movie does get better as it goes and picks up the pace.  If you like Oscar Wilde or movies with Colin Firth then you might love this movie.  If you do not like such things you may be hopelessly lost and confused by this movie.  It's ok but could easily be better and by all rights should be better with such a cast.  Maybe my hopes were too high and I am likely being too harsh. It is the best Oscar Wild movie out there I believe and the characters that are portrayed well are very watchable.

1781114,5,B00006JDVX,"Tis a tale about convenient lies--lies told to keep gentlemen out of trouble.

John ""Jack"" Worthing (Colin Firth) has invented an imaginary brother so he doesn't besmirch his own name as he enjoys his dissipations in London.  Unfortunately, the lie gains a life of its own--as that brother, he falls in love with Gwendolen Fairfax (Frances O'Connor), the daughter of Lady Augusta Bracknell (Judi Dench).

When his best friend Algi (Rupert Everett) decides to come to Worthing's country estate, he comes as Ernest and falls for Worthing's ward Cecily Cardew (Reese Witherspooon).

Of course, both women can only love a man who is Ernest.  Well, particularly poor Gwen who has impulsively tattooed the name of her beloved on her bum.  The ensuing hilarity and confusion of identity will have you laughing through most of the film.

""In matters of utmost importance, style, not sincerity, is the vital thing,"" so says Gwendolen.  And in the end, being earnest is the critical issue.

I saw the original film long ago on the suggestion of my mother, who thought the story was one of the funniest she'd ever read.  She was right, of course, but I think this new version is the one I'd pass along to the younger generations.  Firth, Witherspoon, and Dench are standouts--if it's possible to have such a thing in an ensemble cast such as this.

I rented this film, but I'm planning on purchasing the DVD.  Being earnest is second only to being amused in this title--and it's well worth the watch for both aspects.",1197158400,4,1506,4.813229571984436

Colin Firth plays John Worthing, a wealty man who pretends to be his younger brother Earnest when he goes to London. The catch is, he doesn't have a brother. The reason why he does this is because he is smitten with his friend Algy's(Everett) cousin, who wants to marry a man named Earnest(hence the name). As the film goes on, Worthing finds a way to get rid of Earnest by telling those at his country home that Earnest had died. But before Worthing arrives home, Algy shows up to Worthing's house (because he falls in love with Worthing's young ward Cecily), pretending to be Earnest. Worthing comes home a day early, finds Algy and all heck breaks loose! This is all I am going to say w/o spoiling the ending! You will just have to see it!

1781130,4,B00006JDVX,"The new 2002 version (Reese Witherspoon, Colin Firth, Rupert Everett, Francis O'Connor) and the old 1952 version each has its own merits.

The new one have big handsome stars (especially a lively and young Reese Witherspoon who look convincingly 18 of age), and beautiful scenery of the English countryside. In one shot, imagine the main players picking lavendar in a stretching field of purple. Also, the rivarlies between the sophisticated Frances O'Connor and the young Reese Witherspoon and the competition between Colin Firth and Rupert Everette are more thoughtfully presented. Furthermore, the ending was more suspenseful, not unlike a Sherlock Holmes mystery, and the way Jack Worthing (Colin Firth) disclosed his real name to the anticipating audience had a more intriguing twist.

However, the old one had characters (Michael Redgrave, Michael Denison, Joan Greenwood, Dorothy Tutin) who looked sinisterly funny and a very comic looking Lady Bracknell (Edith Evans) with a pronounced accent. She captured every scene and is the one to watch in the 1952 movie, just look at the DVD cover. Even the costumes in the 1952 movie looked more conspicuous, colourful and exaggerating. The dialogues in both versions were more or less the same. But I believe the older version has included more of the original dialogues.

I would say the 2002 movie is the more pleasing to the eyes and romantic while the 1952 movie is more of a comedy and a play, as Oscar Wilde intended it to be. Which one to watch? Take both.",1149811200,5,1514,5.048

Perhaps it helped that I had already become familiar with the actors playing these fantastic roles.  Rupert Everett and Colin Firth have been two of my favorite actors for years, ever since I first saw Everett in ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" and Firth in ""Bridgett Jones' Diary"".

1781135,4,B00006JDVX,"I gave this DVD version of ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" four stars. There were two major strengths to the film and one distracting weakness.

First, Oscar Wilde's amazingly witty script is wonderful and the use of the one-line 'zinger' is still evident in ""I Love Lucy"", ""All in the Family"", ""The Cosby Show"" and ""Friends"". The contemporary situation comedy is a direct discendent of Wilde's witty comedies. The plot is idiotic and the lines clever - a formula followed for the last 100 years in comedy theater. My favorite line is spoken by Lady Brachnell.  Whne the rich orphan Jack Worthing tells her that he has ""lost both parents""; she responds ""To lose one parent is a misfortune, but to lose both seems careless.""

Second, the acting is very good, with Rupert Everett and Colin Firth both demonstrating their considerable talents to be comic actors as well as accomplished dramatic actors. Reese Witherspoon and Francis O'Connor are given amazingly absurd coy lines, and they both perform perfectly. Of course, Judi Dench, as the hateful Lady Brachnell gets to play the semi-villian and thus gets the Cruella DeVille type lines.

However there is a weak flaw to the film which is a series of additions, meant to maintain the interest of contemporary audiences, that should have beened edited out. There are scenes of slapstick where Algy runs from creditors, where he arrives at Jack's country estate in a hot air balloon, and where Reese Witherspoon's visions of knights rescuing damsels are superimposed and awkward.  The film would have been better had these items been removed. The most awkard addition is Gwendolen Bracknell's tatoo of the name ""Earnest"" on her rear-end; a total cultural disconnect.

None-the-less, the acting is very good and the script is very clever; which makes for an entertaining evening.",1133568000,4,1829,5.039735099337748
1781136,5,B00006JDVX,"I know a certain ""well read"" person who told me that this movie was about a man named Ernest and how important (i.e., rich and cultivated) he was.  They alluded that his name could make or break his relationships.  I thought, ""Hmmm?  Oscar Wilde.  Surely, there is more to this than the obvious.""

Remember that we are talking about WASPs: White Anglo-Saxon Protestants.  Do emphasize Protestant.  This is the saving grace for American/English cultures for centuries now.  Even with this new deal of Urban Chic, truly democratic in nature, plaid is dominant and rules (smile).  Anyway, in this movie and in life, it is very important to approach problem solving with the earnestness of a saint, which is to be as good as you possibly can while adhering to the Golden Rule (do unto others as you would have them do unto you).  The Bible speaks of Expediency as being the soul of Christianity.  Thus, you do the best you can to achieve the best results for the majority of the people.  In this story, our protagonists all are earnest in love, and are classical WASPs.  Being earnest far outweighs the name Ernest: It is enough for the idealist, when material things don't matter; It comforts the cynical soul; and it causes love to endure and thrive.

Lastly, some ladies cherish the name Ernest, while it is notorious to some gentlemen.  And Lady Bracknell (Judi Dench), in all earnestness, being mindful of ""her"" origins, decides that an earnest, gallant rogue is better than any ""mama's boy"" named Ernest, when she manipulates fate by an earnest lie, and facilitates a love match.  Now this is what Oscar Wilde is talking about.",1129593600,,1629,4.764285714285714

Oliver Parker undertook such a challenge in making ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" into cinematic fare, and the end result is, a new view of brilliance!

Starring Colin Firth, Rupert Everett, Dame Judi Dench, and Reese Witherspoon, Earnest spins the tale of comical deceit of two friends, Jack and Algernon. Each conspire through the film to woo girls of their choosing by nearly any means possible. The end result is reminiscient of some of Shakespeare's best comedies, one of implausibilities that are so absurb that you believe them all of the more. Perhaps Wilde, in his genuis of paradox, intended for that to happen all along.

Parker's adaptation of the play is brilliant in its own right. Taking much from the source text, and translating it to a visual medium, such as film, must have been quite daunting. Parker succeeded quite well, creating a film that doesn't ever work to subsume the originial, but complement it in its own unique way. I think perhaps that Wilde would love this adaptation himself!

The acting in this film is superb. First, how can anyone go wrong with Firth, Everett, Witherspoon, and the incomperable Dench, who seethes with her role with an intensity that only she can muster. They handle the comedy with aplomb and naturalness; it sparkles delightful. Reese Witherspoon pulls off her English accent quite well, playing Cicely as young and delightful as she is.

Another aspect of this film that is remarkable is the soundtrack. Normally, a soundtrack blends in to accompany the larger piece. In this movie, the soundtrack stands out as a wild, fun accourement to the film. I quite enjoyed the jazzy feel to it, and the scene where Algy and Jack serenade the girls is so bubbly fun that it inspires intense hilarity. I just purchased the soundtrack and look forward it its many hours playing on my computer.

The Importance of Being Earnest may be a forgotten gem, but once you unearth it, it sparkles like nothing you've seen on your screen in months. I highly recommend you purchasing this movie for your collection, and you may surprise yourself upon how much you actually watch this jewel yourself!",1121299200,4,2283,4.873711340206185
1781142,5,B00006JDVX,"""The Importance of Being Earnest"" was a huge success in its time.  As you listen to the language you can understand why.  The wit and fun of it carry the audience along as if we were running from ride to ride at a verbal amusement park.  Here a brilliant phrase, there sly social commentary, there a bit of romance, back again for a simple joke or an inversion of meaning (much of the play is about one kind of inversion or another).  Oscar Wilde was an easy virtuoso who had total command of his art form however light the purpose.

This movie is beautifully done and is quite enjoyable.  There are some strange changes that make no sense to me.  For example, why make Jack the younger brother when in the play he is the older brother?  The changes of chopping up scenes is a bow to movie making and the attention span of modern audiences, but it isn't Wilde.  Also, the play was presented as the present time in 1895.  This movie seems to be Victorian in dress, but later in technology and music.  And what is the tattoo business?  And why do movie makers seem to need to chop language from plays whose glory is precisely their language?  Since we go to the movie FOR the language more than the pictures of these playwrights, why not make the movie just a bit longer and leave us what the author actually wrote?

Those quibbles aside, the actors are brilliant, enjoyable, and make watching this movie a delight.

That being said, one of the issues in enjoying these popular works from a century or more ago is that we cannot enjoy them exactly as their original audiences did.  Since this was a play of the present time it is clear it is not our present.  We enjoy it with what we know about those times with their manners and customs.  We also enjoy getting to know more about how those people viewed their present.  There is also the delight in the differences between their time and ours as well as the shocking similarities.  These cultural treasures take on additional meanings as they take remain the same but take shifting places in the pantheon as our culture moves beneath them.

Films based on plays tend to lose the sharpness of a live performance, but the pacing of this film moves the play interestingly along.  Beautiful sets and costumes provide eye-candy.

What a wonderful surprise awaited me.  The fact that Oliver Parker chose to make a FILM, rather than a filmed play, seems to have upset a number of people.  Nevertheless, he made savvy - if sometimes audacious - choices in adapting Oscar Wilde's oft-produced play for the cinema.

While most people agree that Ernest is one of the wittiest plays in the English language, I find that stage productions of it have an unfortunate tendency towards being precious: smug actors smirk at one another as they affectedly recite epigrams in between sips of tea (pinkies out, naturally).  Parker's film nicely sidesteps this potential problem by transforming the prototypical English drawing-room comedy into a dynamic, visually rich and marvelously acted film.  You also may be pleased to know that the oft-heard caviles regarding Reese Witherspoon's English accent are completely unwarranted.  Highly recommended.",1095638400,44,1054,5.313253012048193

""Ernest"" is a drawing room comedy. Hacking up the different scenes--moving from the club to Lady Bracknell's townhouse or from the country house to the church--destroys that.  The tatoo parlor scene was entirely gratuitous.  Showing Canon Chasibule's drawings was a total misreading of the character.  Making Algy the older of the guys was wrong; if Wilde had wanted it that way, he would have WRITTEN it that way.  And having Algy and Ernest getting into a physical struggle over the muffins was just wrong, wrong, WRONG--it violated the whole spirit of the play, which is the use of WORDS and LANGUAGE.

Purists might say that the dialogue goes too slowly, that the acting was underdone, or that Reese Witherspoon was miscast. My opinion: the dialogue is, of course, brilliant. It's Oscar Wilde. It is also delivered wonderfully, with perfect expressions that make the witty lines even more funny. Attention is, at times, required to catch these little expressions, but they are what help make the film so great. Also: I loved the casting. I loved it the first time I saw the film. I appreciate the casting even more now that I've read the actual play--the actors portray the characters exceptionally well, with all the quirks and nuances that I gleaned from the book. The add-ins (like the knight in Cecily's daydreams) make the movie, in my opinion, even more delightful. It should be quirky, and, thank goodness, it is.

Everything's so agreeable except Reese Witherspoon's cast here... Parker must have been mistaken for Christ sake! Witherspoon is so NOT right for the choice.

The concept of the play itself is lovely, the fact that so much importance is given to being christened with an appropriate name. However, I was quite upset with Witherspoon being cast as Cecily, there are a million wonderful British actresses for God's sake, why her ? I have this image of her in Legally Blonde, and then you see her faking this Brit accent and its sad, to say the least.

1781153,3,B00006JDVX,"This movie's main strength lies in its cast of talented actors.  Other than that, I found it to be fairly flimsy.  The alterations made to Oscar Wilde's play for the purposes of adaptation do not add much; in fact I think they detract, often making the story feel strange and even a bit rushed at times.
That said, the story is still a funny one, and the actors do a nice job.  Colin Firth (beauty-ful as always) is great as Jack a.k.a. Earnest, and is especially funny during a few different scenes where he becomes embarrassed about something or other.  Frances O'Connor seemed very appealing as Gwendolen, although she didn't have a whole lot to do in this movie and I plan to watch her in ""Mansfield Park"".
Rupert Everett seemed a good choice for Algernon if a bit of a bland one.  I think the same is true for Reese Witherspoon as Cecily, though kudos must be given to her for doing such a good British accent.  Judi Dench is wonderful (as always) as Lady Bracknell.  Anna Massey is a great Miss Prism and the same goes for Tom Wilkinson (who seems to appear in everything at some point or other!) as Dr. Chazzuble.

When Jack/Earnest finally falls in love with a rich city girl (Frances O'Connor), he decides he can best end his convoluted philanderings by ""killing off"" his non-existent brother; little does he know that his best friend Algy (Rupert Everett) is intrigued by the idea of meeting eighteen-year-old Cecily, so Algy has shown up at Jack's country estate claiming that HE is Earnest.  The plot thickens as Jack tries to trace his true parentage; as a baby, he was abandoned in a suitcase that was left at Victoria Station, and his would-be Mother-in-Law (Judi Dench) is refusing to allow him to marry her daughter until he can prove that he is of noble origin.  This video is a faithful adaptation of Wilde's Victorian play, and it is suitable for classroom use.  The hilarious plot twists and clever dialogue make it a classic; without unduly changing Wilde's script, the directors have used innovative scene adaptations that make this film even funnier than the original play, which pokes fun at arranged marriages, shallow religion, the upper class, and the importance of family lineage.

Algy: Rupert Everett, who stole My Best Friend's Wedding right out from under Julia Robert's nose; Jack: Colin Firth, who made all the ladies swoon in Pride and Prejudice; Cecily: Reese Witherspoon, America's newest golden girl, and star of that truly delightful (and successful) little comedy, Legally Blonde;  and, towering over all as Lady Bracknell: Dame Judy Dench, aka, The World's Greatest Actress, merely playing the greatest female comedic part ever written!!! How, I say, how can the lucky viewer feel shortchanged with such a cast??? The answer: You Won't!! Who cares about the interpolated scenes or dialogue changes? You have the right play, you have the right cast, and you certainly have the right comedic story: Two girls desire only to love a man named Earnest, so two men take it upon themselves to vie for their affections using that name!!!

1781167,3,B00006JDVX,"This is an inventive and artful production of Oscar Wilde's play, but I can confidently say that were Oscar Wilde alive today, he would be appalled at the misuse to which his play has been put.  Indeed I think I feel the ground rumbling as he rolls over in his grave, and yes he is actually spinning in anguish.

Oliver Parker, who directed and wrote the screen adaptation, simply misinterpreted the play.  He focused on the ""dashing young bachelors"" when the real focus of the play is Lady Bracknell, the absurd and beautifully ironic representation of the Victorian mind who was then and has been for over a hundred years Wilde's singular creation and one of the great characters of English literature.  She is supposed to steal every scene she is in and we are to double take everyone of her speeches as we feel that she is simultaneous absurd and exactly right.  Instead Judi Dench's Lady Bracknell (and I don't blame Dench who is a fine actress) is harsh and stern and literal to the point of being a controlling matriarch when what Wilde had in mind was somebody who was both pompous and almost idiotic yet capable of a penetrating and cynical wisdom (so like the author's).  Compared to Dane Edith Evans's brilliant performance in the celebrated cinematic production from 1952, Dench's Lady Bracknell is positively one-dimensional.

The point of Wilde's play was to simultaneously delight and satirize the Victorian audience who came to watch the play.  This is the genius of the play: the play-goer might view all of the values of bourgeois society being upheld while at the same time they are being made fun of.  Not an easy trick, but that is why The Importance of Being Earnest is considered one of the greatest plays ever written.  This attempt to turn it into a light entertainment for today's youthful audiences fails because this play is not a romantic comedy.  It is more precisely a satire of a romantic comedy.  Its point and Wilde's intent was to make fun of Victorian notions of romance and marrying well and to expose the mercantile nature of that society.  It is probably impossible to ""translate"" the play for the contemporary film viewer since a satire of today's audiences and today's society would require an entirely different set of rapiers.

Parker's additions to the play amount to distractions that dilute the essence of the play's incomparable wit.  Most of Wilde's witticisms are lost in the glare of Parker's busy work. Recalling Lady Bracknell as a dance hall girl in her youth who became pregnant before being wed was ridiculous and not only added nothing, but misinterpreted her character.  Lady Bracknell is not a hypocrite with a compromised past.  She is everything she pretends to be and that is the joke.  Showing Algernon actually running through the streets to escape creditors or being threatened with debtor's prison was silly and again missed the point.  Algy was ""hard up"" true and in need of ""ready money"" but his bills would be paid.  Gwendolyn in goggles and cap driving a motor car also added nothing and seemed to place the play some years after the fact.

The big mistake movie directors often make when adapting a stage play into a movie is to feel compelled to get the play off the stage and out into the streets and countryside.  Almost always these attempts are simply distractions.  Some of the greatest adaptations--Elia Kazan's A Streetcar Named Desire from 1951 comes immediately to mind--played it straight and didn't try anything fancy.  Here Parker seems obsessed with ""dressing up"" the play.  What he does is obscure it.

On the positive side the costumes were beautiful and Anna Massy was an indelible Miss Prism.  Reese Witherspoon at least looked the part of Cecily and she obviously worked hard.  Rupert Evertt had some moments in the beginning that resembled Wilde's Algernon, but he was not able to sustain the impersonation.

My recommendation is that you not bother with this production and instead get the 1952 film starring, in addition to Edith Evans, Michael Redgrave and Margaret Rutherford.  It is essentially true to the play as Wilde wrote it, and is a pure delight.

1781169,4,B00006JDVX,"This is an entertaining movie.  It is enormously better than the earlier version of it made decades ago.  Firth, Everett and Densch deliver the best performances that could possibly be given of this material.  This is the film version of the Oscar Wilde play that was written and first performed more than a century ago.  I only wish it had aged as well as the films we've seen based on Austen's works. Alas, I cannot.  It does not have the same timeless, universal quality to it.  It may also really be closer to a B- or C+ than a solid B.  It is a very slight, frothy comedy, involving Firth and Everett in their foibles from inventing a fictitious person, Earnest.

Although Earnest has enabled them to get away with many things as a built in contrivance numerous times, the tables are about to be turned.  Earnest, in fact, would be best off dead.  That's the setup for what is a high camp comedy that at moments feels like everyone is trying too hard with the material at hand.  However, this does have Firth, Everett and Densch and they do their best to pull as much as they can out of this material.  Surprisingly, Everett and Firth sing a number at the end of the movie together, over the credits, which I really enjoy, ""Lady Come Down.""  I bought the DVD; I'd recommend renting it instead.  I also have the song now and, ironically, I listen to the song a lot more than I watch the film!

Second Colin Firth...who I umm...have a bit of a thing for Mr. Darcy, or Mr. Firth as Mr. Darcy or...sigh. This film had everything going for it...then it started.
Okay a little harsh. But start with the script, the play itself is a brilliantly funny farce, with Wilde's cynical social satire. Which they then proceeded to cut into jagged little pieces. Firth and Everett in the beginning, are deprived of some their character's best lines; most of Wilde's dialogues are cut short before their punchlines, the repartee of the two comes off as dull and disjointed rather than witty. Also some of the added scenes, whether for pacing or whatever, would have been better excised, (such as the tatooing scene which just annoyed me)for Wilde's own words. The women of the film seem to get the best end of the dialogue deal, their dialogues in the country retaining their original wit. The director chooses to pander to the audience, without doing them any service by it.
  The acting is also spotty. In the beginning, the film is very rough, most of characters (with the exception of Judi Dench) fumbling around and not really interacting. Frances O'Connor, falls sort of the breathy exaggeration she's shooting for and just comes off as embarrasing. Even my dear Mr. Firth dances between the genuinely funny and unintentionally bumbling.
Things do get better in the country,as the characters get more comfortable. The chemistry between Dunst and Everett works nicely and O'Connor calms down a bit. The script continues to suffer from it's own omissions. Although I'm a slight purist, I did enjoy Firth and Everett's serenade. The ending needs to be watched with the knowledge that it is intentionally silly, it is just unfortunate that the film could not keep the pacing that would make the ending feel natural rather than a bizarre, forced departure.
The film did have some worthwhile moments, though not have as many as it should have...leaving you to lament what it could have been.",1047254400,9,2188,4.832

First of all, the whole story is great, even without being on screen.  I loved all of the actors and characters.  The comedy was very funny and I laughed all the way through this show.  I especially loved how Colin Firth and Rupert Everett serenaded the girls.  How funny!  It's great!  It's for someone with a wild sense of humor.",1044835200,4,505,4.1875

And, I must admit, I enjoyed it.  Now, although there are some rather odd parts to it (automobiles, romantic dream scenes and tattoos?!) I found it hysterical.  I will admit here that I am not as familar with the play as others who have written more striking reviews.  However, after glancing through it a few days ago, I can affirm that a great deal of the dialogue is from the mouth of Wilde.
DVD-wise, the extras are quite informative, including outtakes (nothing missed really) and a good ""The Making of..."" with interviews.",1044144000,,651,4.594827586206897
1781173,3,B00006JDVX,"I first encountered this play as an English assignment in high school.  Even reading it on the page, I found myself laughing the entire way through.  I was thrilled when it became an assignment again in college and when I finally got to see it performed.  I was hoping that this movie would capture the fun of the play better then the other, but I was disappointed yet again.
The movie keeps the same story as the play.  Two men pretend to be named Earnest to get them access to places they couldn't normally go.  Both men fall in love and then learn their intended only loves them because of their name.  When everyone arrives at a manor in the country, confusion ensues.
The problem with this movie comes when the director tries to open up the action.  Several scenes that took place in one location in the play are now broken up into multiple locations.  The humor comes from the rapid delivery of lines, and breaking up the action actually hampers Wilde's intent.  The scenes that play best and did make me laugh were the ones that kept the action in one location so I could get into the flow of the scene.  All the actors give fine performances and do their best to overcome the weaknesses of the movie adaptation, but they can't quite do it.
Hopefully one day, directors will find a way to fully capture this comedic play when filming it.  Until then, I'll stick with print and stage versions.",1043193600,8,1399,4.468503937007874

1781177,3,B00006JDVX,"Writer/director Oliver Parker, who gave us a superb ""Othello"" in 1995 and a very fine ""An Ideal Husband"" in 1999, works his magic yet a third time with ""The Importance of Being Earnest,"" a high-spirited adaptation of Oscar Wilde's classic comedy of manners.  In adapting the play to the screen, Parker has managed to unshackle the work from its stage confines, allowing the action to occur in many different locales, often out of doors.  This expansion of the play's geography gives the plot a certain looseness and forward momentum that nicely complements the lightning-paced nature of Wilde's original dialogue.
The theme of the play is, of course, reflected in the name of the work itself, which, in true Wilde fashion, utilizes a clever play on words to make its point.  The ""earnest"" of the title serves a double function, referring to both the importance of honesty, truthfulness and frankness in human relations and to the fact that two men are displaying anything but those virtues when they commandeer the name Ernest as a pseudonym to advance their own selfish causes.  It is Algy and Jack, the two main characters of the piece, who learn that there is a high price to be paid for dishonesty and deception, for those two vices routinely lead to the kinds of interpersonal complications and misunderstandings from which it is often hard to extricate oneself.  Wilde has fashioned a clever, ingeniously structured plot that employs wit, romance, and gentle social satire to make his point painlessly and effectively.
The wonderful cast, which includes Rupert Everett, Colin Firth, Reese Witherspoon, Judi Dench, Frances O'Connor, Anna Massey and Edward Fox, does a superb job hitting just the right note in conveying the lighthearted wit of the text.  Moreover, the film has been sumptuously shot on location in England and boasts exquisite costumes and set design that beautifully reflect the 19th Century period in which the story is set.
""The Importance of Being Earnest"" provides both a pleasant diversion for the Wilde aficionado and a fine introduction for those unfamiliar with the author and his works.  Mr. Parker is now batting three for three in his moviemaking career and I eagerly await his next endeavor.",1041465600,5,2226,5.049046321525886

It goes quickly and is highly entertaining, but I my only tiny criticism was a desire for greater character development. I'll admit to my ignorance: that I didn't realize -- until I read some of these reviews -- that it was a classic English play. Now it all makes sense! Now that I understand this, this is an outstanding adaptation. Of course the cast is what makes this truly exceptional: Colin Firth, Rupert Everett and Dame Judy especially. Extra kudos goes to Reese Witherspoon for stretching her acting chops and pulling off a credible interpretation of a young British woman -- her accent, at least to my ears -- was credible.
This is a lighthearted romp that gives insight into roleplaying and class roles within British society...and did I mention Colin Firth and Rupert Everett? Ding-dong!",1041465600,,872,4.859060402684563

In fact, I was very tempted at several points during the movie to walk out.  Where to begin?  Witherspoon is too old for the character.  More important, anyone who thinks their dialogue is better than Wilde's should simply have written their own entire script.  Some of the best lines of this play were cut completely, in most scenes, the timing was wrong.  Trying to expand the backdrops for scenes was also, imo, a huge mistake (ie, instead of sticking to the interiors of the play, the boys go to a 'gentleman's club' & Gwendolyn goes to a tattoo parlour, for heaven's sake!)
Bad.  The whole thing was bad, the timing was *much* too slow, etc., etc.,etc.  Even Dame Judi couldn't save this bloater, & I love her work.
Ok, so I'm used to this play *as a play*, onstage, not messing around with any additional cutsey dialogue.  But lord, it wasn't good.",1041206400,15,956,4.543859649122807
1781181,3,B00006JDVX,"""The Importance of Being Earnest"" is a film where if you do not know the play (which earns five stars), then you would give this movie four stars but if you do it gets only three.  Both the strengths and the weaknesses of this adaptation of Oscar Wilde's play can be laid at the feet of writer-director Oliver Parker, who attempts to make the 19th-century comedy more palatable to a 21st-century audience.  The result can be aptly characterized as one step forward, two steps back.  Parker adds a sense of energy to the interactions of these sedate Victorian characters (there is, believe it or not, hugging in this film between gentlemen), which tends to work against the ideal delivery of Wilde's dry witticisms.
On the one hand the addition of a minor sub-plot involving paying an outstanding bill at a London establishment adds to the general sense of confusing regarding Earnest/John/Algy, which aptly fits the skewed way in which the truth functions in this story.  But then Parker decides to add his own joke at the end which totally negates the principle that makes this all work out in the end (I was going to give the film four stars until that point).  Similarly, the quick flashback into how Aunt Augusta met and won Lord Bracknell is nothing more than a cheap laugh because it ""truth"" defies all reason regarding the workings of the British upper class, especially during the Victorian Era.
Parker does nicely expand the idea of little Cecily and her fantasy world represented by her dairy and her habit of writing love letters to herself, in terms of her idealized visions of knightly romance.  But while the idea of the servants sitting around playing assorted musical instruments in the kitchen was funny, having John and Algernon serenading Cecily and Gwendolyn on piano and guitar seems a bit forced.  Again, I acknowledge the probability that only those who are familiar with the play and who recognize these changes as changes.
The cast does its best work with Wilde's original material.  Colin Firth (Jack) first impressed me as the only Mr. Darcy I have seen in ""Pride & Prejudice"" who managed to make the transition from being proud to being human.  Rupert Everett (Algy) should have at least received as Oscar nomination for stealing every scene he had in ""My Best Friend's Wedding.""  Judy Dench (Lady Bracknell) is as professional an actress as we have today; I always think of the scene in ""Shakespeare in Love"" when Gwyneth Paltrow is about to curtsey instead of bow and Queen Elizabeth just makes her pupil dilate to convey a message.  Her interview scene with Jack best preserves Wilde's original play.  Reese Witherspoon (Cecily) holds her own with the English cast and gets points for tackling Wilde.  Frances O'Connor (Gwendolyn) is the relative newcomer of the cast, but the fact she had a title role in a BBC production of ""Madame Bovary"" is a good sign.  Tom Wilkinson is rather wasted as Dr. Chasuble, but it is nice to see a familiar face, as is the case with Edward Fox who nails his too few lines as Lane.  Anna Massey as Miss Prism completes the main cast and provides the key piece to the big puzzle.
Ironically, I enjoyed ""An Ideal Husband,"" Parker's earlier screen adaptation of Wilde play, and was going to suggest it as a better example of the work of Oscar Wilde.  However, I had never seen or read that particular play, so for all I know Parker took as many liberties with that one as he does with ""The Importance of Being Earnest.""  At least there is an attempt at something of an Oscar Wilde revival, which is something that is necessary every generation.  While biopics like ""Wilde"" are good, there is no substitute for exposure to the plays themselves, even in these altered forms.",1041120000,3,3732,4.741885625965997
1781182,5,B00006JDVX,"I enjoyed this film very much.

1781183,5,B00006JDVX,"Rarely is there a movie that immerses the intellect in the intense sensuality of sensational sharp sentences. If you are so inclined, you will drown happily in the witty banter between the characters.

The Importance of Being Earnest is Oscar Wilde's (1854-1900) final and most cherished play. It opened on February 14, 1895 at the St. James Theatre in London.

Wilde's sense of humor and creative genius is fused into a comic masterpiece guaranteed to ""produce vibrations."" The wit in this cinematic adaptation is superlative and delves into such ideas as repressed desires and identity. The text has been updated, but the moments of pure splendor are direct quotes from the play.

As secrets are unveiled onscreen, the intrigue only increases. You now enter a world drenched in sexual tension, snide humor, country manors with sweeping lawns leading to lakes, crisp lavender letters, spectacular sets, fields of bluebells, intimate and yet expansive English gardens (West Wycombe Park), lavish interiors, staircases decorated with murals by Giuseppe Borgnis, assumed identities, sumptuous costumes and true love.

London

Algernon Moncrieff (Rupert Everett) appears first as he is being chased through the back streets of London by his creditors. You are instantly drawn into the mystery of the moment and desire to find out more about this character. As he displays his talents as a Jazz Pianist, we know there is more to this character than a sheer love for the unfettered life. He seems to have a romantic streak and a devotion to the forbidden.

The Country
(Filmed in Buckinghamshire at the West Wycombe Park, an 18th century landscaped garden created by Sir Francis Dashwood.)

Jack Worthing (Colin Firth) is living a double life and is trying to find his true identity. He adds excitement to his life by assuming different identities. In town he is ""Ernest the Bachelor"" and in the country ""Jack the Provincial Justice of the Peace."" He maintains a bachelor apartment in Albany and a country estate where he has the responsibility of being guardian to Cecily. He escapes to London by train, to enter his own fantasy world where he can flirt recklessly with Gwendolyn Fairfax who has always imagined she would fall in love with a man named Ernest and give him her undying devotion.

It is interesting to note that in a world of society drama, audiences enjoyed seeing images of their own aesthetic paradise on display. In the Nineteenth Century, many Englishmen were in fact living the life of ""Jack"" in the country and ""Ernest"" in the city.

Jack seems to falter in the area of romance on numerous occasions and almost seems locked behind a door of somber decorum. Gwendolyn breaks from her chains in a ""metaphysical speculation"" moment. She represents the inner desires of all the characters, yet she is the first to take action in the direction of her dreams. You have to love that she travels with her diary so she always has something sensational to read.

In the meantime Cecily Cardew (Reese Witherspoon), a sweet country rose, has built up her own fantasy life complete with knights and the desire to be rescued from her prison and her tutor, Miss Prism.

She too desires to find a man named Ernest and willingly makes up entries in her diary and even writes herself love letters from her imaginary knight. In her life, ""the essence of romance is uncertainty."" Yet, she truly almost dreams her knight into life.

The story really centers around two couples and the meddling Aunt Agusta who is absolutely entertaining. Judi Dench perfects the role of Lady Bracknell and had played the part before. As Gwendolen's mother she assumes the role of protector of her daughters purity and yet she herself realizes that love transcends social barriers.

All the characters are living lives in which they at first seem to be escaping vicariously into their fantasies. The true awakening comes when they take action to bring these ideas to fruition.

After Ernest visits London, all the characters end up back in the country where the real fun begins. After Algernon is tempted by thoughts of the innocent and beautiful ward Cecily waiting to be plucked from her country garden, this story becomes a comedy of errors with clever romantic twists. The mischievous Algernon pretends to be Jack's naughty brother and succeeds in convincing Cecily that he is in fact ""Ernest.""

Lady Bracknell's refusal to allow Ernest to marry her daughter sets off a series of events which threatens both couples romantic dreams. Suddenly there are two men named Ernest. A name known to ""inspire absolute confidence.""

Once Cecily meets Gwendolyn they even read one another's diaries and give their men a delicious little taunting session that is both cheeky and wicked.

Oliver Parker includes a poem by Oscar Wilde as a song in this scene to subtly change the atmosphere from conflict to passion.

Serenade
The western wind is blowing fair
Across the dark Aegean sea,
And at the secret marble stair
My Tyrian galley waits for thee.
Come down! the purple sail is spread,
The watchman sleeps within the town,
O leave thy lily-flowered bed,
O Lady mine come down, come down!
-Oscar Wilde

Wilde was known for his wit and penchant for lilies. He was often seen strolling through Picadilly Circus in London wearing a shirt silk, velvet coat, silk stockings and a lily in hand. As a tribute, men and women wore lilies to the performances in London.

Director Oliver Parker has added a beautiful touch of flamboyance to this film. This movie is best viewed with an unprejudiced eye. Perhaps it is true that ""Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit; touch it and the bloom is gone."" The less you know about the play the more you might enjoy this film.

This movie is a beautiful ripe peach dripping with delicious English wit.

Rather Delicious Actually!

Firth, Everett and Dench are particularly good; but director Oliver Parker seems to have no faith in the brilliant wordplay that makes this unsubstantial comedy one of the greatest ever written.  The bizarrely anachronistic touches, such as sexual aggression and tattooing, do not serve and in fact hurt the movie; Cecily's fantasy sequences are strange and disruptive; Reese Witherspoon and Frances O'Connor are respectable but not spectacular.

1781185,3,B00006JDVX,"Maybe my expectations were too high. I was hoping for greatness with this film; but it just doesn't quite get there. It is still a very good movie and is highly enjoyable. It just doesn't quite make the 5-star list.
""An Ideal Husband"" is one of my favorite DVDs. So, when I heard that the same people were making an adaptation of ""Importance of being Earnest,"" I couldn't wait to see it. Then I heard that the cast was going to include some of my favorite actors, so my expectations went up even more.
For the most part, the cast does deliver in a big way. Judi Dench, in particular, is marvelous. Firth does a great job and Frances O'Connor is very good.
The two other main cast members (Everett and Witherspoon) are a bit of a disappointment. Especially Witherspoon! She is completely mis-cast in this role. She seems too old for the role. And though it seems that she spent long hours with a voice coach to develop an English accent, it doesn't ring true. Her whole presence on the screen has a feeling of wrong-ness that I can't get over. Everett - who was so good in 'Ideal Husband' - does a passable job here, but just does not quite nail it all the way through.
As for the other aspects of the film, I give it high marks but not the highest. The direction is very good. It basically suceeds in getting all the comedic timing and pacing right. But the witty Wilde dialogue does not come across with the crispness that I had hoped for. It's ok, but it doesn't grab you the way that it should. Costumes, sets, supporting cast are all excellent. Some of the departures from the original Wilde text are a bit maddening; others though are quite funny (I admit that I laughed out loud at the tatoo scenes).
In summary: I enjoyed this film. However, it is not the kind of movie I'm going to watch over and over again. It's pretty darn good, but does not achieve greatness. A good rental; but maybe not worth buying for your library.",1039651200,3,1931,4.381615598885793
1781186,3,B00006JDVX,"not that it isn't enjoyable to watch, but its weaknesses are glaring. The main fault has to lie with the director, who didn't keep a tight rein on the story line, tried to introduce modern day stream of consciousness scenes which didn't seem to belong with a plot of Wilde's at all, and who chose America's new sweetheart, Reese Witherspoon, to play the major role of an English proper schoolgirl. Perhaps she does some fine work in this country (I've never seen any of it), but the only word to describe her work in this film is ""abominable,"" and she really pulls the movie down watching her amateurish high school-like performance while acting with some great, great pros like Dame Judi Dench and Colin Firth (and they alone must be given credit for holding this movie afloat). I like Rupert Everett, but he seems miscast in this film as well, being a little too droopy and flaccid for the character he plays, and his instantaneous falling in love with Firth's ward, Witherspoon, is not at all believable. Perhaps he is playing the character as if he smells money when he is in desperate financial circumstances.
The plot in short: Firth is in love with a lady played by Frances O'Connor (adequately), Everett falls in love (maybe) with Witherspoon. Both ladies believe these men are named Earnest because of the subterfuge of the men, and both women adulate that name. When they find out their true names, their passions hang in the air while the women try to figure things out, and Dame Judi Dench tries to throw a monkey wrench in all their plans.
The great characteristic of Oscar Wilde's plays is his fabulous wit.  In this film, all of his so original witicisms have been expunged.
Try the earlier film version (I believe it was with Michael Redgrave). It may not be as flashy, but it better captures the true, inimitable Oscar Wilde.",1038960000,8,1842,4.685185185185185
1781187,1,B00006JDVX,"I cannot imagine a better cast for this film. That makes this dreadful travesty of Oscar Wilde's play even more appalling. Oliver Parker's hubris in thinking that he can improve on Oscar Wilde and one of the finest comedies in the English language is an outrage.  He has cut some of Wilde's best lines, only to replace them with idiotic dream sequences, a ridiculous subplot involving Algernon's creditors, and even a hot-air ballon ride. Further, the production is heavy-handed and the music is just wrong.
All this pales in comparison to the overwhelming vulgarity of the scene in which Gwendolyn gets a tattoo, and fabricating a past as a chorus girl for Lady Bracknell.  Mr. Parker clearly understands neither the characters, the play, nor Mr. Wilde himself.  I can only conclude that his credit on An Ideal Husband is in error.
