4862376,1,B005S4GCQO,"THis movie may have grand things to report about the doc's ideas for treatment of cancer, AND my friend
who has moved from middle stages to late stages of cancer, has attempted to get this wonderful
treatment for cancer listed on the movie from the doctor, and lengthen his life span,
BUT the doc takes no insurance and requires a car load of cash, which my friend did not
and does not now have. So my friend is presently in last stages of life span with cancer,
feeling the intense pain, stomach eruptions, colon blockages that go with it.
So what good is the movie, without having the thousands of dollars necessary
to get the treatment the doc has discovered??",1357171200,7,663,4.533333333333333
4862377,5,B005S4GCQO,"This is a great movie is also available to watch on your computer at Amazon Instant Video.  Dr Burzynski invented the word antineoplaston for the substances that he used to treat cancer with.  He should have used the name Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors instead. The scientific underpinnings are important, the National Cancer Institute has the best slides to show one how these inhibitors work and they can be found under the title ""targeted therapies for lymphoma tutorial"" ""Inhibition of Histone Deacetylases (HDACs)"" HDAC inhibitors are thought to promote expression of p21, a cell cycle inhibitor, and Bax, a protein that promotes apoptosis.  Is there any evidence that Dr Burzynski's antineoplastons are Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors? He created a antineoplaston in patent 6372938 synthesis of 4-phenylbutyric acid.  This antineoplaston is known as a Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor in patent 802628.  Sodium phenylbutyrate is another Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor which breaks down into phenylacetylglutamine and is eliminated in the urine.  Phenylacetylglutamine is used by Dr Burzynski in patent 6943192 to make antineoplastons AS2-1.  He is presently creating different formulations to work on a wider range of cancers. If Burzynski had mentioned that he was using Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors, then others would catch on and they would use ultrafiltration devices on blood and urine samples.  This would eventually lead them to discover that genes need to be turned off by the application of the missing Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors. Flow cytometry is used to test peptides inhibiting or arresting cell growth in real time.

4862378,5,B005S4GCQO,"Here are results that go beyond the anecdote to confirmation by doctors and MRI scans and that are written up in medical records.  Dr. Burzinski's antineoplaston therapy works,  has effectively removed cancers, even some of the worst kinds, so that patients have seen their cancers disappear and not return.  And the treatment has meant none of the harmful side effects of the traditional chemo and radiation therapies which have been woefully ineffective for the most part.

This DVD set of 2 disks costs only $20.00 and is indeed a very worthwhile investment.  Those who are facing treatment for cancer or know someone who is would do well to make the investment.

It would seem that in the medical profession many doctors have adopted a prejudicial view of Dr. Burzinski, calling him a quack and a charlatan.  Certainly the FDA and the Texas Medical board have relentlessly tried to show him is a quack and charlatan without any success.  The movie demonstrates through interviews and medical records that the prejudice and the persecution have been completely unjustified.

The FDA has now done an about-face and is now supporting his phase - 3 trial, but this is likely a result of numerous of Dr. Burzinski's patients attesting before congress of the efficacy of his treatments.  His patients have very powerful testimonies.

The results speak for themselves with medical confirmation of the efficacy of the treatment with neoplastons.

I do urge those facing cancer to give Dr. Burzinski fair consideration.  Do purchase this movie.",1333238400,12,1539,5.083665338645418
4862379,1,B005S4GCQO,"This is not a ""documentary"" at all.  It's an infomercial, made by a conspiracy theory filmmaker (his past credits include the 9/11 truther movie ZEITGEIST; under his assumed name ""Eric Clinton""), made to promote the evil doings of a notorious quack.  Neither director Merola nor doctor Burzynski have shown any compunction about lying in the past, so why trust them now?

Also, as a movie, it's so very boring.  Snore.",1323388800,7,418,4.928571428571429
4862380,5,B005S4GCQO,"If you have cancer or know someone who has cancer this movie is a must see. If you are a concerned citizen and wonder why billions of dollars are spent by the government and large non profits yet nothing much comes out of it your answers will be found in this movie. Merola points out that the problems seemed to start with the user fee act which meant that every time the FDA approves a new drug the drug companies would pay them millions of dollars. This act put the FDA on the payroll of big pharma. This meant according to the movie that only the well connected multi billion or trillion dollar companies could get a fair shake for their new products and the individual scientist or doctor would have a tough time. Merola backs this up with a quote from a high up bureacrat who directly says that under his watch no research money or patents related to cancer should be given to individuals only large corporations.

The movie shows how government levers are effectively used by drug companies to cause havoc against their competition or individual genuises like Dr. Burzynski whose research threatens their market share. The movie identifies the most important government agencies for getting approval for new treatments such as the FDA, National Cancer Institute, Texas Medical Board, and how if you get on their bad side the trouble a brilliant researcher may have even if this research is the holy grail of cancer research an effective cure of cancer with no side effects. Merola effectively tells this story and the amazing stories of the patients recoveries as well as the legal battles that ensue when the Dept of Justice prodded by the invisible hands of evil forces worried about market share(drug companies selling chemotherapy agents) and having to pay for his treatment(insurance companies) try to put Dr. Burzynski in jail while at the same time his patents are being stolen out from under him.

Merola does a good job explaining but also needs to add more information on the role that insurance companies, and their dirty tricks team played in these attempts to bring down this great hero of medicine who cured patients of brain cancers which is considered one of the most difficult cancers to cure. Merola should also explain the role of the Federation of State Medical Boards which sets policies for all of the state medical boards across the country as well as the role that local competitiors who may have been jealous of Burzynski and his amazing research may have played in this story. In Texas any anonymous source is allowed to send in complaints to the medical board and they don't have to take any responsibility for any comments that they make because they are automatically protected by law. This 2 CD set adds some great new footage that will blow you away, and is definitely worth buying even if you have seen the original. Buy a few extra sets for your friends or legislator you will want others to watch this!",1323388800,24,2943,4.734892787524366
4862381,5,B005S4GCQO,"This is a great story in its own right, but the information it reveals is even more important. The story is of an epic battle between the 'powers that be' including the medical establishment and government bureaucrats at every level, versus a small band of committed makers of change, a battle that has lasted decades. The information revealed is an expose of a ruthless and corrupt partnership between government agencies and the cancer industry, devoted solely to protecting their interests. These sociopaths (no lesser word will do) are absolutely uninterested in the welfare of cancer patients; their only interest is their self-esteem and self preservation, a stunning example of organizations that have come to exist only for their own sakes, not for the principles upon which they were founded and chartered.
The theme is courage against all odds, continuing to this day, a fight truly worth fighting. Please find or buy a copy of this documentary, for your own sake if not for the sake of the David presently fighting Goliath. You won't be sorry!",1322870400,34,1054,5.0285714285714285

4862383,5,B005S4GCQO,"I was trying to research Burzysnki so I searched for him on Google. I noticed that the wikipedia page contained a lot of subjective and questionable language, which is atypical of wikipedia since the language is usually direct, to the point and clean of personal biases. It appeared as more of a hate page than an information page (check it out for yourself). I tried to remove a word from a sentence that appeared to be highly subjective and not professionally written since I want the article to be of a serious nature rather than someones hate rant. This is doable with all wikipedia articles since ""anyone"" can be an editor. Well, it appears that within about 30 seconds of me changing it, the page was reverted back to the original version. I tried it again, and the same thing happened. It looks like an automated process is in place to always keep the same content on there, no matter what suggestions are made for changes... So just one question to the people hating on him here on amazon... if this is all a big conspiracy and burzynski is just a crack pot, why would anyone bother to discredit him on wikipedia of all places? Who cares right? Who is on the other side of that wikipage constantly changing it?",1415059200,8,1218,4.540909090909091
4862384,5,B005S4GCQO,This was an outstanding documentary.  Grateful I can own it.  I am truly concerned at the Medical Mafia that exists...to squelch real heal resolves/cures in the name of a dollar bill.,1413504000,2,183,4.870967741935484
4862385,1,B005S4GCQO,"This ""documentary"" on the rapacious and unethical Houston cancer quack is in fact naked propaganda - unsurprising since the director's past credits include the Zeitgeist conspiracy nonsense. The vast majority of this doctor's patients that can bs traced, are dead. Some, he blames for dying of cancer, others he just airbrushes out if the picture.

The only thing the Burzynski clinic reliably delivers is a huge bill. Check USA Today and BBC for past exposes of this charlatan.",1413417600,3,478,5.128205128205129

4862390,5,B005S4GCQO,"Dr. Burzynski is the only one out there who has cured numerous cases of inoperable brain tumors, including children.  For this reason, he has been hounded unmercifully by the various elements of the huge Cancer Industry (mostly the same as AMA, FDA, and Big Pharma).  This is an excellent documentation of his work and trials.  I highly recommend it.  He has a clinic in Houston and perhaps the only reason he has managed to survive financially is the support of Dr. Julian Whitaker and the subscribers of Dr. Whitaker's health newsletter. This movie will be a real eye-opener to those who never question their doctor as well as a possible life-saver for anyone dealing with cancer, because chemotherapy in and of itself can be deadly.",1406764800,,735,4.856

4862393,5,B005S4GCQO,"My son was treated by Dr. Burzynski in 2000 for Medulloblastoma.  I took my son off of chemotherapy, he was scheduled to have 10 months of Cisplatin and finally the FDA approved/allowed us to seek treatment from Dr. B.  The rules back in 2000 were that the patient must fail chemotherapy and radiation first before treatment with Dr. Burzynski.  Before 2000 the FDA did not have these regulations and Dustin in this video was able to receive Antineoplastons BEFORE failing any chemo or radiation.  Therefore, Dustin is in wonderful health, complete remission, and with no long term side effects.  This is not the case so much for my son, who has a long list of long term side effects from radiation treatment since he was denied treatment due to the FDA until he failed radiation or chemo.  The side effect list would be longer if he had stayed on the Cisplatin, so I am grateful he was able to be treated by Dr. Burzynski instead of Cisplatin. This documentary is an amazing story and very hard for most people to grasp.",1400630400,3,1021,4.613259668508287
4862394,5,B005S4GCQO,"Burzynski is a genuine American hero - one who left Communist Poland to came to the states because his radical non-toxic cancer therapy was so highly acclaimed and sought.  His protocol of anti-neoplaston infusions was without the usual serious side effects of classical conventional cancer therapy.  But, once over in the states, his refusal to sell his patented processes to Big Pharma made him a sudden enemy to be put out of business.

His successful legal battles against the corrupt cancer establishment and its hordes of political hacks has cost him untold sums of money, money that he unfortunately had to recover from his patients - by way of increased charges for his therapy.

Instead of giving to the ceaseless stream of ""cancer cure"" drives, which only serve to line the pockets of the already super wealthy cancer care providers, why not take at look at this genuine medical pioneer and his work, whose therapies' efficacy has now been proven over many, many years.

Even his approach makes more common sense:  Why take a person ill with life-threatening cancer and make them even more sick by subjecting them to the traditional three pronged attack: 1) radiation, 2) chemotherapy and/or 3) surgery?  Why not, instead, as Burzynski advocates, treat the cancer patient with benign materials that once protected them from the cancer, and that are present in people who don't have the disease?

Notwithstanding the proven merits of his treatment, the cancer establishment has waged war on this brave scientist, who is also a medical doctor, trying to put him out of business.  The two films in this package give the viewer and rare insight into what is really going on to hold back medical research and the kind of advances that might in help decrease the huge costs of so-called ""health care"" care in the U.S., not to mention its terrible record of failure to help make the American public healthier.

The films are a must see set of excellently produced wake up calls to the American health care consumer. They may be documentaries, but they are easy to watch and are surely great teaching tools.",1397520000,3,2109,4.898876404494382
4862395,5,B005S4GCQO,"First of all, I loved the movie, Burzynski, and have told so many people to watch it. I wanted to mention that the 2nd video in this extended edition is tremendously interesting and well worth the purchase. You will enjoy every minute and won't be able to turn away. The American people are being taken advantage of in such a huge way, it's going to blow your mind. There's a better treatment for cancer out there and it's being withheld from us due to greed and a corrupt FDA. I thank Dr. Burzynski for all of his work. Watch this 2 DVD movie. I promise it will be the most interesting thing you have watched in 20 years.

This particular DVD focuses on the political and business end of health. The reason the federal government got into health care is because it now comprises 16% of the GDP. Scary number. Scarier health care regulator.
I know. I have worked in health care in anesthesia for almost 30 years. A lot has changed and it is linked to HFCS, fast foods and big pharma.
