1890820,5,B00009V7QE,"I am generally a diehard non-exerciser, but occasionally (usually a few months before a vacation) decide that I need to do a little work to tone up.  I bought this video, hopeful that it would be not only a good workout but also engaging - and I love it!!  The instructor is outstanding!  She's easy to follow, gives great directions, and is very motivating, without being overly perky or bimbo-ish.  The workout is definitely toward the beginner end of the spectrum - 25 minutes of cardio, followed by 15 minutes of floor work - but this is what I was looking for.  The music is also great - energizing and upbeat, but not techno-obnoxious.  There are several women working out with the instructor, which helps give the feeling that you're part of a class - more fun than exercising on your own, in my opinion.  I definitely recommend this video!",1067990400,3,847,4.6066666666666665
1890821,5,B00009V7QE,"This was my first time using Pilates, I needed something new. The gym was getting a little boring and the kick-boxing was getting old. This video combined virtiually 'no-impact' cardio, a fun rythm, and mat work. The moves were powerful, yet simple, and I was not tripping over myself as I have other videos.
I IMMEDIATELY felt the results and after a week, felt the difference. I have not let this video become part of my 'graveyard' collection.
Ellen Barrett is an excellent instructor - she is not chatty, not too cheery, and gets the job done! I can not wait for a new, more challenging workout from her.",1067904000,3,608,4.587155963302752
1890822,5,B00009V7QE,"I'm really enjoying this workout. It's fun, different and I feel my muscles working and toning on every exercise. The instructor has great energy without being annoying and there is person in the background that shows modifications. I often take classes at my gym and I just wish this one was offered. I'd love to be directly taught by this crunch instructor!",1067817600,,359,4.806451612903226
1890823,3,B00009V7QE,"This video seems OK, and has good production, but I'm beginning to understand that people make different types of Pilates videos. Some videos are more instructional and remain at very basic levels. This is one of those. I guess this is good if you have never exercised in your entire life. But if you have been active in any way, it's probably better to find a video that gives you some gusto.",1067644800,3,393,4.472222222222222
1890824,5,B00009V7QE,"I just started with pilates and love this video. I like the upbeat music, and Ellen is a great instructer with easy to follow directions. 5 minutes into the work out I was sweating and loving it. The cardio is easy to do, the mat work is more complicated and harder, but I loved the challenge. I felt muscles the next day, I didn't realize I had even worked. Love this video. Would recommend it to anyone.",1066003200,5,405,4.2727272727272725
1890825,5,B00009V7QE,"I love the Crunch Fat Burning Pilates workout!  I have been doing the Pick Your Spot Pilates workout for awhile now (which I also love) and wanted to kick it up a notch.  I tried the Fat Burning Pilates and loved it!  It combines cardio and pilates moves to give you a well rounded workout.  And the cardio portion of the workout does not wear you out like some other videos, deterring you from wanting to do it again.  Another great feature is that if you are a beginner,there is a modified version of the move shown so you can still participate.  Ellen is a great instructor too.  I would recommend this workout to anyone!",1065744000,6,624,4.373913043478261
1890826,5,B00009V7QE,"This was my first journey into Pilate's and I loved it.  The video is fast paced,  but not too complicated.  I've been doing the routine six days a week for the last three weeks and I am already seeing results.  The combinations are interesting and the routine it engaging enough to make you want to start exercising.  I feel much more energized now and I notice how my body feels toned and active.  I would recommend this video to people looking to start a routine that will keep them motivated to exercise.",1064966400,42,508,4.467391304347826
1890827,5,B00009V7QE,"For me the intensity level of this workout is perfect. It is fun enough to keep me motivated, yet it is aerobic enough to give results. I feel like I can do this workout even on my weak days, and use it as a motivating warm-up on my strong ones.",1064534400,3,245,3.92
1890828,3,B00009V7QE,"The cardio version is a little complicated for those who don't have a strong aerobics/rythm skills. However, the mat exercises are great and keep a faster pace than other pilates DVD's. A couple of the mat exercises need to have more reps.
I'll do my own personal cardio and then do the mat exercise chapters twice.
The drums can get annoying, but Ellen is great!",1064448000,,363,4.6
1890829,5,B00009V7QE,"Pilates seemed dull to me, so I took a chance and bought this DVD since the description seemed more exciting. Let me tell you - time flies! I didn't look at the clock once! I was in a sort of trance and managed to do the entire dvd straight through. I even like the music. If your goal is to work up a sweat and get your heart pumping, but not bounce around, this is the workout for you.",1062288000,28,387,3.911392405063291

1890831,4,B00009V7QE,"This is not my first Ellen Barrett DVD - I have others, which is a good portion of the reason I bought this one in the first place. This is not her best DVD out there, but it's certainly not bad, either. First off, it's 13 or 14 years old at this point, but for the most part doesn't look too terribly dated. The workout is pretty good, though I will say at the end I always end up wishing it was just a little bit longer. Or that at least the cardio portion was a bit longer. I have been doing Lindsay Brin's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pretty-Fierce-Weight-Loss-with-Lindsay-Brin-Moms-Into-Fitness/dp/B00AP88IYC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pretty Fierce: Weight Loss with Lindsay Brin & Moms Into Fitness</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pretty-Fierce-Extreme-Lean-with-Lindsay-Brin-Moms-Into-Fitness/dp/B00AP88IWY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pretty Fierce: Extreme Lean with Lindsay Brin & Moms Into Fitness</a>&nbsp;for a year now, so I'm in fairly good shape. But I wanted more Ellen Barrett DVDs as I was enjoying her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crunch-Super-SlimDown-Pilates-Yoga-Blend/dp/B000CEXF8I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crunch - Super SlimDown: Pilates Yoga Blend</a>&nbsp;on slightly easier days. (Lindsay Brin's stuff is generally not what I would call easy, definitely not once you get to the Extreme Lean set.) And just something in general that wasn't as high impact, but would still offer a feeling of having a good workout.

First off, the worst part of this workout isn't actually the workout itself. It's the camera work. The camera tends to move around more than I feel is necessary, making it harder to follow the workout when you're still ""learning"" it early on. Not to mention, what's with the long closeups of the drummer? Sure, he does a good job drumming, but as he's not doing the workout, it's a bit annoying when Ellen is talking about what you should be doing, but you can't see it. The camera work is really what takes away from this workout the most.

The workout itself is pretty good - while I don't break a sweat, it also takes a fair amount for me to do so (everyone sweats differently!), and I definitely feel warm after the cardio portion. I like that she reminds you about your core throughout it as well, as that's the thing I need to be reminded of occasionally, even after a year of Lindsay Brin doing it. As I mentioned before, I wish the cardio portion was just a bit longer, as I'm always left wishing for a bit more with that. The floor work at the end is a very nice end to the workout, and provides some nice ab work. As for Ellen herself, I enjoy her as an instructor. She has a pleasant voice, and she's not at all annoying during her workouts, this one included. That being said, I actually prefer her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Power-Fusion/dp/B005OMN9E8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Power Fusion</a>&nbsp;workout a bit more than this one. Beyond the fact that it's barefoot throughout (saving one the frantic shoe removal in the middle, which I do realize my lack of desire to pause the disc is my own issue), I just feel a bit more ""exercised"" overall after that one. The camera work is also a lot better on that one.

Ultimately, if you want to purchase only one Ellen Barrett workout, this is not necessarily the one I would list as my top choice. I would definitely choose the Power Fusion one over this one. But, if you're looking to add to your Ellen Barrett collection, or want another workout that isn't high impact but still leaves you feeling good, then I'd recommend this one in addition to some of her others",1490227200,2,3770,5.397283531409168

I like that it is easy for me to understand I work up a sweat and that is what I want.  I do not want to kill myself by trying to keep up with the young women in the video. So if you are in my age range and want a decent work out program I recommend it.",1472342400,6,382,3.269662921348315
1890837,3,B00009V7QE,"It's not Ellen Barrett's best video at all.  On the one hand, I enjoyed the live drummer they had.  But on the other hand they really should not have been panning over to him much if at all. The musician should be heard and not seen, in my opinion.  It was distracting because i would have really rather seen one of the exercisers/instructor so I could follow what was going on with the exercise routine.",1471910400,2,404,4.36

Now I'm lighter and leaner, thanks to a low carb diet and Jillian Michaels 4 days a week. So I thought what the hell, let me try this again on a day off. My ass was still suitably kicked. The only thing I can even remotely brag about is that I could do it without stopping as I had to before.

So the bottomline is: it works regardless of your fitness levels.",1441497600,,429,3.9195402298850577

1890865,4,B00009V7QE,"Overall I'm happy with this purchase.  This Pilates cardio video is fun to do, but doesn't really get my heart rate up enough.

The bad:
- not enough burn.  The cardio moves are all low-impact and low-to-moderate intensity.  Think step-touches, toe-taps out to the side, circling arms while you step forward and back, bringing arms overhead while you plie.
- There are a good amount of squats and plies (proceed with caution if you have knee issues!), but overall I barely broke a sweat.  Kinda disappointing since the title is Fat Burning Pilates.

The good:
- this video is actually pretty fun to do.
- The moves all feel very natural and graceful, and you'll get some good moderate core work as long as you keep your abs gently pulled in the whole time.  Ellen, the instructor, is good at reminding you about this, which i like.
- Ellen is pretty easy to follow, and upbeat/positive without being annoying.
- I love the other background exercisers too:  all naturally beautiful but normal-looking, and a variety of body types. That motivates me so much better than background exercisers who look like flawless Victorias Secret models.
- I felt a good burn in my abs during the short mat-work section.  Would have liked that part to be a little longer, but still good overall.
- Also love the music!  Some of the best I've heard on any workout video.  There's a live drummer on the set, which makes it feel more like a dance session than a workout.

I should also mention my boyfriend does this workout vid with me sometimes.  He likes it a lot too, and he says the cardio part is harder for him to get through.  This workout seems geared toward beginners or intermediates, but it's also good for an ""off"" day when you want to get your hear-rate going a little but aren't in the mood for a high-impact or interval-style workout.",1430006400,,1830,4.590769230769231
1890866,5,B00009V7QE,"Ellen is one of the best instructors on DVD. I've tried a lot -- via library checkouts -- and she is genuine, casual, and encouraging without being obnoxiously perky or annoying like other ""TV"" fitness instructors can be. My preschool-aged children even enjoy ""doing"" the exercises and watching along, mostly because of the good music and drumming.",1429920000,,348,5.12280701754386
1890867,1,B00009V7QE,"First let me start with the positive, the instructor was likable.  However, this was not enough to overcome the ridiculous drummer that was in the video.  So silly...what does he have to do with anything!  I also found the moves to be boring, simple and mundane.  I did not even work up a sweat.  I was watching the clock waiting for this to be over.  This is for a beginner.  Not an intermediate like myself.",1428969600,3,409,4.373333333333333

1890869,2,B00009V7QE,Not very impressed with this workout. The shots of the congo drummer were especially annoying when I needed to know what position I was to be in for the workout. I did NOT break a sweat nor get my heart rate up enough to feel like I did a complete workout so I ended up on the elliptical right after. My Fitbit says I burnt only 123 calories doing this for 40 minutes. Very disappointing. I did not enjoy it at all.,1426636800,,415,4.073170731707317

I have a tendency, as a former gymnast (tumbler), to bulk up when I work out. This workout keeps my muscles stretched and leans me out rather than strengthening workouts like P90X or Insanity.

I'm on my third disk. When I scratch or overuse this, I buy it again. I first bought it in 2003. I still use it regularly today. I never tire of mixing this workout into my running routine, etc.",1410912000,3,552,4.411764705882353

1890890,1,B00009V7QE,I was excited by the majority of the reviews being great but when I began to do the workout the instructor was just all over the place the movements weren't cohesive. I would honestly not recommend this DVD at all. Don't waste your money!,1400457600,,238,4.431818181818182
1890891,5,B00009V7QE,"Yep, that's right. I got exactly what I was looking for. Exactly what I ordered. Nothing more. Nothing less. As for the DVD itself. I love it. Rented it from the library one day. Helped keep me motivated. I liked the chick in the second row. The one wearing a yellow shirt and green pants. She has some muscles! Some day I want to look as fit as her. Maybe just doing Pilates will get me there...doubt it. She probably lifts weights like a man. Probably can kick any man's butt too. Ahhh... some day. Some day....",1399939200,,513,4.298969072164948

1890893,5,B00009V7QE,At first I thought this workout was so cheesy!  You are stepping side to side and then the guy playing the bongo?  Really?  I did give it a try and have come to really enjoy this!  I feel like I'm dancing and the bongo's are really motivated and go along with all the steps!  Nicely done!  My body has definitely slimmed down since doing this workout and I usually do Jillian Michael's workouts!  This one is just so stress free and I don't finish feeling hungry!  I love it!  My husband has also noticed that I look more lean!  Love it!!!,1397692800,,539,4.247524752475248

1890898,4,B00009V7QE,"I really like Ellen Barrett as an instructor, but I feel like this workout was 30 minutes of aerobics, which she calls standing pilates, followed by 10 minutes of actual Pilates. When I want the constant movement and a full-body workout, I prefer Ellen's Sleek Sculpt Express, which uses handweights but only takes 30 minutes.",1393718400,,326,4.945454545454545

I decided to get this for myself, only to find that in fact the video on the DVD doesn't even match the outside of the box or the DVD itself. It is not the work out I did. However that is the only reason I am knocking it a star as I should have looked at the video they posted on amazon, my bad for assuming that it was what is on the box. Ellen Barret is a wonderful teacher and for a beginner or intermediate you will not be disappointed. Her workouts flow nicely and the benefits are noticeable in only a few weeks.",1391040000,,576,3.9316239316239314

Although I needed to modify some of the moves in the beginning, I still got an amazing workout. It is extremely easy to follow, upbeat, and fun. I am a big fan of Ellen Barrett, she is a great instructor.  I even enjoy doing the mat work which I usually skip because I really hate doing mat work.

1890914,5,B00009V7QE,This is a perfect all-around pilates dvd for the beginner or physically challenged. Easy to follow and flexible format.

That being said, this DVD sat on the shelf for a long time. I've been walking away the pounds with Leslie a lot, sweating' with Richard, and been good friends with my dreadmill for a few weeks now.

That being said, I was getting bored. First time I did this, man, I found muscles I didn't know I had...and they were sore. However, I can feel it working my muscles, I work up a sweat, and it doesn't feel like a waste of time. It's enough stretching and mat work to make up for some of the repetitive motion of the treadmill.

The only thing that bugs me is just how buff everyone is in the background....a real body would be nice.

Overall though, good purchase and good to add to an overall regime.",1376352000,,834,4.067073170731708

She does have some matwork at the end,which is great for a cooldown,I love this dvd! Ellen is a wonderful instructor!",1368835200,2,392,4.865671641791045

1890924,5,B00009V7QE,"I love Ellen Barrett's workouts, she is low key and all her moves are slow but intense.  There is no high impact jumping, just slow precise muscle toning.  At 43 minutes long with no high impact you would think you wouldn't get a good calorie burn, but somehow you do (I wear a HRM) and you feel the muscles you used the next day.

The first segment of the workout is done standing floor style, with Ellen's own little moves the second part is on the floor.  If you've done any of her workouts you are used to the moves and though she calls them something different on the Crunch workouts than she does on her own DVDs, it doesn't take much to figure out what she is talking about.

I own a number of Ellen's workouts and have a few more on my wish list,  for those days when you just don't want to be yelled at and don't want an intense high aerobic workout, you can't beat her.",1367971200,2,879,4.141176470588236

1890926,5,B00009V7QE,"I have recently started working out after putting on weight in the last few years. For a beginner like me, this is a great routine. It took me 2 or 3 times to do all the exercises in sync. There are plenty of plies and squats. The mat work is good too. It  works your abs and I usually have to take a break in between. I do break into a sweat after doing this. I have been doing this twice a week for a month, and I have noticed that my thighs and butt have tightened and become toned. I also feel energized after doing this and my posture has also improved. I plan to do this more often to see more results.

Ellen is a great instructor and motivator. While doing the exercises, she makes you feel elegant and good about yourself. The girls in the background are good too. The music is good and upbeat.
Overall I am very happy with this and will continue working with this.",1367020800,,874,4.105263157894737

I discovered Ellen Barrett via my cable company's on demand fitness channel with her Grace and Gusto workout. I really enjoyed it and was curious as to what else she had available. After reading many reviews of her DVDs, I decided to buy this one. It was indeed a good purchase. This is low impact but still offers enough of a challenge to work up a bit of sweat. I absolutely love the fusion of different types of workouts (pilates, yoga, ballet). Straight cardio can be pretty boring but the fusion aspect makes it much more enjoyable and fun. None of the moves/steps are difficult but the movements are large enough to get the heart pumping. The mat work at the end is core/ab focused. Many ab exercises tend to irritate my lower back, but I didn't find this to be the case; most likely because the segment is pretty short. I actually like this one so much I went ahead and bought two other Ellen DVDs! This one is my second favorite from the ones I now have (my favorite is Burn and Firm Pilates).",1356566400,3,1159,4.420560747663552

1890944,5,B00009V7QE,"I'm new to Pilates, and to working out in general. I'm not quite overweight - I'm 5'4"" and started at 145lbs about a month ago, now I'm down 7lbs due to doing this video most days of the week and counting calories. I'm eating a healthy amount of calories with the goal of losing 1-2lbs a week, but I was finding it was hard to stick to my calorie level without exercise. Doing this workout, and sometimes adding in about 20 minutes of some extra low impact cardio, like hula hooping while watching TV, allows me to eat a bit more and still lose weight. This is a GREAT workout! I was NOT fit at all when I started using this video - the first few times I did not make it all the way through at all. There are quite a bit of squats that just exhausted my legs. But my body quickly adapted, and my muscles got stronger after only a few times of doing the workout. The cardio is good - it's not so strenuous that I felt like I needed to take a break at the beginning, but I most certainly break a sweat, even a month later, and I do this video at least 5 times a week now. I also feel my abs getting stronger - I love that the ab moves have enough repetitions to have an effect, but just when you start to feel like you're about to give up, it's over and you're onto the next move that doesn't feel as challenging, until you reach the end of the reps again. There's someone on the video who modifies a few of the mat work exercises, and I definitely modified in the beginning, but now I don't need to. I think this is a wonderful workout - the moves are fluid, there's little repetition, some of the moves allow for rest/recovery, which makes the workout feel easier to do. I've done other workouts that are only 20 minutes long (see: Jillian Michaels) and I found those harder to stick with long-term because the moves were much more strenuous. And hey, if you're pressed for time, go ahead and give those condensed workouts a try. But I found that doing a less strenuous workout for longer let me keep up with it. I'm an Ellen convert and am now buying a bunch more of her DVDs, only because I'm getting a little bored with this one. That doesn't take away from what a great video it is though!! I am looking forward to more Ellen Barrett!",1349308800,5,2238,4.170900692840647

However, I think Ellen's Crunch Burn & Firm Pilates is a better workout because the drummer in Fat Burning Pilates is so distracting to me.  Some of the exercisers look a little silly, but this DVD is almost 10 years old, and undoubtedly we all wore outfits 10 years ago that we wouldn't wear today!  I really like Ellen Barrett.  She's encouraging and uplifting, and her workouts are challenging and fun.",1346889600,,562,4.752577319587629

This routine is more cardio heavy than anything else, including some beginner pilates. I think that makes it a great set to add in with other traditional routines (as I've done) to really get a good balance in your workout schedule. They definitely modify some pilates moves and incorporate them into the standing cardio component, which makes them interesting and has a very different effect on what you'd normally do. The mat portion at the end is pretty solid and very standard for most beginners pilates routines, albeit at a slightly faster pace. I think it is overall a really great DVD, definitely will get you sweating, and really provides a strong effect for the length of the routine - I'm very satisfied with this product.",1346803200,,949,4.7926829268292686

The mat work is great compliment to what you do in the cardio segment and I thoroughly enjoy this workout video also.

1890951,4,B00009V7QE,"I have recently started working out and I found this DVD on my netflix instant streaming play and I decided to try it out.  I really have not liked Pilates workouts that I have done in the past, but right from the start, this workout was different.  It starts out fast paced (but not too fast) and got me sweating in no time.  The moves were easy to follow and Ellen Barrett offers plenty of instruction and reminders througout.  I actually felt that I had worked out after doing the DVD (not the case with all exercise DVDs).  The only reason I gave it 4 stars out of 5 was for the mat work section.  If you are really limber and great at pilates, it will be no problem, but for myself, I didn't like how she has you start the move, and then explains it while you're holding this really challening pilates position (at least for myself) and then begins the exercise.  I am not up to that level yet, so I found it a bit frustrating.  I was tired before the move had started!!!!!  Maybe after keeping with it for awhile and losing weight it will become easier.

All in all, a great workout!!!",1333756800,,1091,4.252427184466019

Also has a great mat workout portion which emphasizes basic Pilates moves and rounds out the session. The instructor's cueing is good, and different levels of exertion are presented for beginners. Music is essentially a basic drumbeat in background, which allows you to concentrate on getting the movements/posturing correct and not be distracted. All in all I would highly recommend this for someone trying to get into (or return to) a solid exercise routine, and that wants to incorporate Pilates movements into a cardio workout.

I find her extremely engaging. Her cueing is excellent. She tells you WHY you are doing something. Some of the exercises may seem repetitive or simple, but believe me, they work. If you want to build bulk, and look ""cut"" then her videos aren't for you. But if you want to have a slimmer, leaner ""dancer"" look, then I recommend her videos.",1301529600,2,733,4.42962962962963

I had taken Pilates classes earlier this year and loved how flexible I had gotten, and how rejuvenated I felt after each class. I decided to give this dvd a try, and it had me sweating after 15 minutes. The cardio part wasn't too hard, but I could really feel my muscles being worked. Abs are in the last 15 minutes, and I wish it could have been longer but I have another Crunch Pilates dvd that I can pop in to get that extra ab workout.

But if you just want a nice toning laid-back workout, this is a great video.  I have read the reviews about perfect Pilates and strippers, and I say that even if it doesn't follow the exact science of Pilates, if you do this for three months like I did, you will lose weight and tone up beautifully.

As far as the strippers comments, I can understand where that comes from: jealousy.  These are your average women who have had children and all the experiences that comes with that who deserve NOT to be judged.  I say good for them, they are not perfectly beautiful and are a great example of what we can achieve if we put our minds to it.

Her method combines cardio, standing pilates along with a little bit of traditional matwork, yoga (all the stretch without the New Age, ultra-meditative stuff), and ballet to create an invigorating, inspiring workout. I feel feminine, elegant, and graceful during the workout, even though I'm constantly working to maintain my balance and I'm sweating by the middle of the routine. (I'm a beginner in that I've let myself get really out of shape, but intermediate in that I've had experience with pilates and yoga in the past, if that helps you gauge how much you'd be sweating during this routine). After, I feel energized, almost like I've attained that mythical  ""runner's high"" that I've heard about but always believed to be an urban legend.  Ellen's cueing is perfect, she has a calming voice and elegant demeanor, and her Master's in Education shows. The exercises flow beautifully and build in intensity, so you can choose to stay at a lower level of exertion if necessary (for me, sometimes it's necessary). Admittedly, I'm a little uncoordinated, but it did take me a few times through the DVD to feel comfortable with all the moves and transitions. Don't give up, it's so worth it!

I'd personally like to stress one thing: don't focus TOO much on results. The journey is just as important, if not more so, than the destination. It's important to know your body and its needs, but psychologically, it's important to find joy in your exercise program, otherwise you grow to resent it and that's the end. Then you develop a complex (or at least, I did). So find something that gives you joy; for me, Ellen Barrett's method is perfect and makes me feel better than I've felt in a long time (admittedly I'm young so ""long time"" is relative, but you get my drift). I'm sore in the right places and content in the knowledge that I'm not only transforming my body (even if it's a little more slowly or subtly than other methods), but I'm also transforming how I think and feel about exercise.

I have many, many workout DVD's by many different instructors.  Ellen Barret is by far my most favorite.  She is very easy to follow along with. I never feel as though I am falling behind or don't understand the moves.

  The exercises are simple and she narrates very well.  With all her DVD's I have after doing them a couple of times I only need to listen to achieve the workout.  I don't need to constantly watch the TV.  Which makes for a better workout.

This happened a few times during the workout and caused me to lose my focus and had to ""catch up"".  Ellen is wonderful and delightful to workout with!  She helps you feel good about your efforts no matter where you are in your fitness level.  I discovered her trying out the Zen Workout she produced on Fitness T.V. and realized when I was done that I've never felt so good and ""relaxed"" after a workout!

This routine is easy peasy! You can pick it up really quickly. And Ellen's cueing is superb. She reminds you what to do before you get there. She gives great instruction, you never feel like you don't know what's going on. For some of the harder moves, like hip circles, there are alternatives presented by another instructor, Tracey, so if you can't quite get there yet, you can still do something similar yet less difficult. If you keep at it, however, you'll be doing the intended moves in no time.

The drums are a little distracting, but I've learned to ignore them and listen to Ellen. The format is nice, doing standing work and then moving down to the floor.

I have had a problem with a shoulder tendon popping out of position, and I was afraid this would be too much for me, but really putting my all into the arm circles and swings stablize the tendon, reduce inflammation and pain, and unfroze the joint.  Likewise, a bunion on one foot is twisting the tendons in my foot out of position, but I have found this very helpful in straightening the tendons and stablizing my ankle, as long as I remember to keep squarely on the ball and not roll to the side of the foot.  Overall I found have found it a real advantage in keeping fit and flexible.  Some critique:  so many plies and squats can develop really bulging upper thigh muscles.  For a sleeker line, replace a few of them with leg stretches.  I don't do the mat portion--too many crunchies.

I could work out much more often to this dvd because the cardio & pilates is not hectic & I feel the toning more because I am concentrating on every stretch.

I think my thighs got a good work out but I'm not sure about the rest of my body.  And the movements in the cardio section were extremely repetitive - to the point where I completely lost interest and was just counting down until the end of the section.

The (very) brief mat work portion of the video is better, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who hasn't done some pilates before, as the instructor doesn't give very detailed instructions during this part.

I'll still bust out this video when I want a change in routine sometimes, but I'm always instantly reminded of why I don't like it.  One of my least favorite crunch videos so far.",1217808000,2,946,4.556213017751479

The pace is reasonable - not ""break-your-neck,"" but not ""take-a-nap"" either - and her cuing is terrific.  The ""floor"" section is short but challenging IF you concentrate on proper form.  The music is awesome, and I wish more workouts used drumming like this.  It reminded me of The Method's Target Specifics (with Jennifer Kries), which I love both for the workout and for the music.

Overall, I wouldn't use this DVD on days when I am looking for a full-blown Pilates or cardio workout.  However, it is a great option on its own for a lighter day, or combined with a weight-lifting, cardio, or second Pilates session for a more complete workout.

As a side note, I agree with some of the other reviewers that a few of Ellen's cohorts should have reconsidered their outfits before trying to work out in them.  I usually don't notice that kind of thing - and it would never stop me from doing the workout - but it is actually distracting, especially when the camera cuts directly to them.  Try to ignore it.",1200096000,,1445,4.627450980392157
1890988,3,B00009V7QE,"It's a great idea, but not very challenging aerobically, and there are far too many squats.  You end up not getting a great workout, with the exception of incredibly sore thighs!  Anyway, I use this DVD when I'm feeling lazy and don't really want to work out--""Well, I could at least do the Crunch Pilates routine.""  One more complaint--there are a couple of women on the video who can't actually do the knee lifts and some other things Ellen is leading them in because their pants are so low they would come off if they did.  I realize that showing one's belly is the thing right now, but if you can't work out properly in what you're wearing, perhaps you should reconsider your workout wardrobe, n'est pas?",1195516800,2,708,4.551181102362205

This was one of my first Pilates DVDs, and it is still good.  However, if you are going to purchase a Crunch Cardio Pilates DVD, buy Burn and Firm Pilates first.  This one is good; that one is better.  Burn and Firm uses weights, which allows you to adjust to your level of fitness or desired exertion.

This is probably my favorite of all the Crunch videos I own. My second favorite would be Crunch Super SlimDown.

The camera work is decent though sometimes the directing bothers me, especially when getting an artistic pan (shot) of the room - or the drummer - interferes with my ability to actually see what the instructor is doing.

The squats are bearable though because she breaks them up with alot of standing moves to work your abs. Overall, if you learn how to maintain correct ""pilates posture"" (which she reminds you to do through the video) you will get great results from this, especially if you are a beginner. For intermediate to advanced, this is great for a ""light day"". Also I highly recommend Ellen's ""Burn and Firm Pilates"" for those of you who want more intensity.",1177632000,,681,4.683333333333334
1891005,4,B00009V7QE,"The quick and simple review for this DVD would be that it is a good, basic low-impact aerobics class with a nice floorwork element. I found it enjoyable and energizing without being too difficult.

Now imagine this: you walk into your new fitness class and find it populated entirely by cute young women who have just been to the hairdresser, makeup artist, and possibly a waxing session, judging by the amount of abdomen they are showing. If you thought, ""Perfect! That is just the kind of class I loove!"" then you will feel at home in this video class. If you thought, ""Oh, I wish I felt at ease in that kind of class!"" then this is perfect, since you can do it at home without feeling that anyone is looking down on you for your baggy T-shirt, age, or imperfect figure. If you would spend the whole 40 minutes hating those girls, don't choose this DVD.

I agree with an earlier reviewer that cutting to the drummer during changes in moves was a bad idea on the part of the editor of the DVD, but otherwise, this is well-done. The moves are clearly explained, the music is enjoyable, and there is a modifier. I intend to check out other DVDs from this series.",1177286400,,1161,4.420560747663552

This is the dvd I have been looking for.  You start off with about 25 minutes of aerobic exercises standing up - this did make me work up a sweat.  Then you finish with about 15 minutes of mat exercises on the floor.  The first time I worked out to this dvd, I definitely could feel muscles in my legs that haven't been used much on the other dvd's I have.  I think that you'll enjoy this dvd if you're looking for some aerobics to add to the stretching-type Pilates.

But I still come back to this one when I'm looking for a quick, invigorating, and energizing workout, or when I'm short on time.  I love how Ellen transforms traditional Pilates positions (which I find a bit too slow and boring) into standing exercises with cardio elements!  And I appreciate how she breaks even the more complicated moves down for you before going into it.

There are two parts, cardio and mat and the cardio is segmented, so you can choose each part from menu if you don't have time to do all.  The instructor's explanation makes sense for each motion.  I personally like the instruction's voice tone and a way to talk, calm and bold.  She does not talk too much, shout, laugh, or share her personal stories before or through the exercise as some instructors do.

I must agree with another reviewer that the drummer is pretty darn annoying, especially when you're first trying to learn the routine (hence the 4 stars). However, once you get the hang of it and are able to focus on yourself and not the screen as much you can just ignore him.

1891014,3,B00009V7QE,"I am a huge fan of Ellen Barrett's Crunch Pilates series.  I have all her DVDs and use them regularly.  This is the only one I have a gripe with.

The cameraman, for some inexplicable reason, frequently cuts away from Ellen just as she's transitioning to a new move!  Why? To zoom in on a crunch logo, or to focus on that annoying drummer, smirking away in the corner.  This was very, VERY sloppy camerawork in this DVD. It's extremely distracting and frustrating.

Other than that, the workout is effective, and if you watch it often enough, eventually the camerawork, although still extremely annoying, causes less problems for your workout.  I typically burn 205 calories doing this DVD, and 55% body fat.

The other DVDs don't have this problem, though, and they are great.  I have been doing the Ellen Barrett Crunch DVDs for the past three and a half months.  You can REALLY tell a difference on my body, the results are truly amazing (of course, changing my diet and dropping 20 pounds helped).  My thighs are really hard and my abs are definitely firm.

From the first time I did it until the most recent time this past week, I always have fun with this workout. I was suprised by it at first because I had associated Pilates with a mat on the floor-- the majority of the workout is standing cardio. There is about 15 minutes of mat work afterwards that nicely complements the cardio.

Although other reviewers have called it a ""light"" workout, I still break a sweat after about 10 minutes and my heart rate stays up throughout the cardio section. You'll definitely be able to feel it in your legs the next day. The mat work section is short, though, and you don't get as many reps or as much of the ""burn"" that a 40 minute mat-work-only workout would give. I personally like the change of pace you get with standing Pilates work and I enjoy mixing up my exercise routine by alternating this DVD with mat work DVDs.

One of the best things about this workout is that you don't need to be a veteran exerciser to be able to do the moves. One woman in the group does modifications so that someone at any fitness level could follow along and progress at his/her own pace. There are a few points where the camera angle/cues aren't the greatest, which makes certain points in the workout a bit shaky the first couple times around, but stick with it! Also, the instructor is easy to listen to-- not shrill or annoying or over-excited.

I have several DVD workouts that just collect dust on my shelf after being used just a few times, but this is NOT one of them. I'd definitely recommend this workout to anyone who's looking for a fun workout and willing to break a sweat.",1140998400,10,1787,4.344311377245509

The pilates is not as extensive or traditional as a Mari Winsor video, which I recommend highly if you are serious about pilates, but if I am pressed for time combining some pilates plus an aerobics workout is great for me.

I have rather weak arms, and did they feel it the next day. This is probably a 'beginner' tape, but for the time you use it, it's worth it.

1891032,3,B00009V7QE,"As someone who owns dozens of exercise videos and who hates to exercise, this was my first experience with a Pilates-based workout.  Here are, in my opinion, the Good/Bad points to this workout:

*Good:  The atmosphere, the participants, the instructor, and the music are great.*

 -  The instructor is attractive, personable, clear, and not annoying in any way.
 -  It starts immediately. The instructor doesn't waste time with introductions or drawn-out instructions or  ""consult your doctor"" warnings, like you see in so many other workout videos.
 -  The music is excellent, a rhythmic Caribbean style. There's a good-looking guy in the background playing bongos to the tune. I really like that!
 -  The choreography is easy. If you've ever used exercise videos before, you should find these steps very simple.
 -  The first half is semi-aerobic, reasonably good for getting your heart rate up before the matwork (but not enough to be considered a cardio workout - see ""Bad"" below).
 -  The supporting participants are women who are pleasing and most of their smiles seem genuine, although there are a couple forced-looking smiles now and then. There's even one woman who seems like a ""regular"" girl, not a buff athlete (but of course, they hide her in the back).  There is one girl who really bugs me, but that's just me.
 -  One of the participants does a ""modified"" position of some of the stretches, which is helpful for beginners.
 -  The stretches are gone through pretty quickly. Right when you're starting to feel some burn, we move on.
 -  The whole thing is only about thirty minutes and it goes by really fast.

*Bad:  The aerobic section is mild. The matwork is too brief.*

 -  I would consider this to be NEITHER cardio or Pilates. I do break a small sweat, and I suppose any exercise is going to help you burn fat, but I definitely wouldn't have called this ""Fat Burning"" since your heart rate doesn't increase by much. If anything, this is Low Impact.  Additionally, I haven't done any straight Pilates workouts, but I understand that they're very challenging. This is not.
 -  Now that I've been using it steadily for a few weeks, I feel there are some moves that are too simple and a waste of time - not cardio and not muscle toning.  For example, at the beginning of one set, she has you stand there with your hands on your hips, and simply tap one foot out...in...out... in.  I feel this movement would be something more suited for someone looking for an *extremely* easy exercise, perhaps elderly folks or people in physical rehabilitation.
 -  Since the matwork goes so quickly, I wonder how effective it really is. Granted, no one wants to do agonizing ab work until you're dying, but at the same time, it seems like just when you're getting into a stretch, the instructor moves on. For most of the matwork, this instructor counts only eights beats and does not have you repeat the move.

All in all, I'd say this is a good video for a beginner, someone NOT looking for a challenge, or someone who wants to get in a daily workout but is lazy (like me) and doesn't like to break much of a sweat.  It does give you some exercise, and you do feel your abs the next day.  At least in the beginning.

*UPDATE:  After using it for a month or two, the thought of doing the very boring and much too light ""step-touch"" routine has made me stop using it.  It's just not enough - not enough cardio and not enough Pilates. If I've talked myself into working out, dangit, it's got to feel like a workout!*",1124409600,15,3519,4.591639871382637

The foot work made me pull something in my leg so but yet after that i continued doing it because i thought well its probboly just a muscle getting used to working out again but no. It's hard being 16 trying to get fit because you need way more cardio. This dvd is called ""fat burning"" pilates, my only question is wheres the fat burning? the abbs part is a killer but besides that its not worth it. Your better off with Crunchs's Dance Party dvd, now thats fun and makes you sweat.",1121644800,3,615,4.090909090909091
1891035,5,B00009V7QE,"Except for the walking my job requires, I have not done any real exercise in over a year and decided to start swimming again; so I bought this video because I wanted something that would help me lose a little of the weight I gained and because I thought it would be a great way to loosen up and stretch my body after swimming.  This video did that and more.  My first day back in the pool was great but it left my shoulders really tight. So the next day I popped in this video and all I can say is WOW! WOW! The workout not only helped to loosen up and get rid of most of the soreness in my shoulders and the rest of my body, but I got a nice cardio workout.  The instructor was very good at demonstrating or explaining each exercise without being annoyingly perky.  It took about my third or fourth time using the video to get the movements down, but once I did the workouts wore awesome. I am so impressed with this video that I plan on buying the Crunch Cardio Sculp and the Crunch Boot Camp Training for when I don't feel like driving to the pool or the weather is too nasty (i.e. snow and ice) for driving to the pool. If they are anything like this video I am going to be in great shape during the winter months and I won't have to worry about getting into shape for the summer because I will already be in toned and in shape.  Just a warning to those whose fitness level is intermediate to advance, this is may not be the video for you.  I say this because with the swimming, I started to build up my stamina very quickly, so to really get the cardio benefits of the workout I had to rewind the tape before it got to the floor pilates part and start the whole cardio routine all over again.  I was really sweating after the second time around.  Since the instructor was so wonderful, sans perky cheerleader voice, I did not mind repeating the video which gave me a good 60 minutes of cardio before I finally did the floor exercise/cool down portion of the video.  I think I will keep this video even after my fitness level has gone up, just for those days when I'm feeling lazy and don't feel like doing anything too strenous.",1121299200,5,2133,4.170316301703163

It's the only workout video I want to use daily - and this is from a person that gets bored with workout videos in less than a week. My only warning is BE PREPARED TO SQUAT!!

The second part, mat work, was a little challenging after doing all the floor work. I will admit that when I first got the tape I found the first segment (25 min aerobic inspired pilates) to be enough for me but now I can do it all. I consider myself to be an advanced beginner. An intermediate to advanced practitioner may not find it as challenging and rewarding as I did.

Overall its a great tape.  As with every other CRUNCH workout I've seen, the instructor is good and likeable.  None of that yelling from the other ladies in the background.
There is a live drummer adding a nice layer of extra rhythm to the music.  He is in no way distracting or annoying.  I think he lends a bit of energy to the workout and to the set.

Overall, this is a pretty nice workout. Its one of my favorites.",1118102400,2,923,4.2701149425287355
1891038,5,B00009V7QE,"Get this DVD and stick with it and you will see results!  You could get on that stairmaster or treadmill but you wouldn't be toning your entire body (which is key).  I have been fitness conscious and physically active since my early 20s.  My experience as an aerobic/step instructor from my 20s into my 30s had given me a good base of fitness knowledge.  Now approaching 43 and having faced surgery induced menopause I have found it more difficult to stay fit, loose weight and get toned.  Always tired due to severe sleep deprivation related to (night sweats), I fell into the pit of believing that  hour a day on my treadmill or stairmaster (4 or 5 days a week) would be enough and it just wasn't.  What I found is that I began to have sagging upper arms and a larger middle section.  One day running with (very fit/ripped and trim) sister-in-law (same age as myself) I discovered that she prefers Pilates over any other workout.  An instructor herself she now only teaches or takes Pilates.

I have read many of the reviews written by other people that claim this DVD doesn't make you sweat enough.  To that I say work harder.  This video is good but you need to put in the effort and trust me you will sweat and elevate your heart rate.  If you feel like you are not sweating enough add in the arm movements earlier (once you get to know the video), step fuller/wider.  Or you could mix it up with treadmill/stairmaster or bike by alternating days.  Mix it up anyway, so you don't get board.

As for me I have been using this video and others along with some biking and my treadmill.  When I choose biking/treadmill/stairmaster over the DVDs, I always include the Ab portion of one of the DVDs.  THIS VIDEO HAS AN EXECELTENT AB WORKOUT!  I feel good, I am sleeping better, my abs and midsection are more defined, I AM losing weight, and people are noticing.

I hope I have inspired you.  Good luck and get to it.",1118102400,12,1916,4.432664756446991
1891039,5,B00009V7QE,"I love Fat Burning Pilates! Ellen is a pleasant instructor with a great video. It has the benefits of being a low impact video; it maximizes the fat burning opportunity, while target toning with intensity.

At lower intensities, fax oxidation supplies the energy for exercise, which is why moderate exercise is best for someone like myself, as opposed to working out at my max. I have seen results from pilates and it's benefits are maximized by the cardio addition in this video. Core strength is developed and used in daily life. Increased muscle strength means that your metabolism increases as well.

I highly recommend it for someone looking for impressive fat burning!",1117238400,3,674,5.008928571428571

1891042,4,B00009V7QE,"I love Pilates and have been doing it for several months, but I'm struggling to add cardio to my routine consistantly.  I'm in pretty poor cardiovascular shape so I figured this short combination video would fit the bill.  As a beginner, I found this workout very challenging.  It definately got my heart rate into the target zone.

I know the cardio was not supposed to be real Pilates, but ""Pilates inspired."" It seemed more inspired by ballet to me.  It seemed almost totally based in plies/squats...tons of them.  I have knee issues and after the workout I had to put ice packs on my knees, they were so sore.  I like the workout, but I'm not sure if my knees can take it too often.

The mat work is okay.  If you are new to Pilates I would not recommend it because she does not explain the exercises or proper form.  Beginners to Pilates really need a slower, more mindful practice to learn the exercises. Look for Ana Caban, or Stott Pilates for this.  The matwork seemed very short.  It contained a few traditional Pilates exercises and a few strange ones I had never seen.  The mat workout itself is not very challenging, except for the fact that I was already tired from the cardio when I started.

Overall I think the dvd has too much leg work considering Pilates is supposed to be about working the core abdominal muscles.  I am an apple shape and my legs need the least work, unfortunately most aerobics videos seem obsessed with squats and lunges. I like the music and the instructor and I really want to like this dvd; maybe I will if my knees get stronger.",1115856000,14,1571,4.463157894736842

You start off with a easy warmup then you go into a 25 minute cardio routine with a variety of pilates inspired moves. There are lots of plies (or as Ellen calls them ""center squats"") which you will feel in your inner thighs. You will also move through a sequence of step touches, side leg taps, knee lifts, all while using assorted arm movements including ""elegant arms"". The next cardio routine features swan leg lifts, the mermaid, knee lifts, leg extensions and more center squats all with more arm movements. The final cardio segment has out/in steps, side toe taps, center squats with leg lifts and elegant arms, then some plies and relivees (calf lifts) and you finish off with some pilates pushups. Then it's time for matwork, this brief routine starts with exercises while lying on your back like the hundred, single straight legs, double leg drops, oblique criss crosses, single leg circles, knee drops, etc. Then you flip over on the other side and do back extensions, little piece of heaven, and a new move called ""arrowhead"" where you are on your elbows and knees lifting one leg tapping it on one side then the other. Then you finish some ab work, a reclining twist and then it's time to stretch out.

This is a great workout, not incredibly challenging but lots of fun and the time flies by.  The music is good and there is a bongo drummer in the back who adds his own flavor to the music, he looks like he is having fun along with everyone else.

I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys pilates or wants to add something ""different"" to their workout library.",1113091200,4,1822,4.631578947368421

Ellen, the instructor, seems approachable and easy-going.  The drummer is in no way distracting, but the music pumps you up and changes tempo with the moves in a very motivational manner (especially at the times when you need it the most!).

On many exercise changes the camera was focused on the ""Crunch"" sign, the hand drummer, or up-close on the instructor or one of the others on the video--you can't see what their legs and arms are doing.

The next section was the pilates with mats, where she showed some basic pilates moves which are easy to follow.

I started a regular exercise routine, I do about an hour each night. I first started with Pilates at the recommendation of my sister. I fell in love with Pilates, but soon realized it did not meet my cardiovascular needs. I did not always have the time to do the Pilates I love and other exercise that met my cardiovascular needs as a heart patient.

This video gives me both the cardiovascular workout I need and the pilates that I just love to do. I perform this workout at least once a week. The instructor is also very good.

I have purchased around 20 exercise tapes since I got sick, and this is one of four I took on vacation recently.

I've taken 2 pilates classes, and in each realized just how important it is to know how to do such key things as properly breathe and roll. I've only used the video once; the cardio was EXTREMELY repetitive and uninspiring and I never broke into a sweat once. My heart-rate barely lifted and when it did it was for a very short time. I am in a pilates class at the moment (I wanted to use the video to supplement my workout on my ""days off,"") and my workouts there definitely get my heart rate up. I am also in an aerobic kickboxing class, where I do nothing but heart pounding and sweating. It doesn't take much to get me to do either, but this video did neither one. There WERE good things about the video; it moves at a pace that is easy to follow; I never had to rewind to look at a move, but I wonder if this will be too slow my second time around.

All I knew is that lots of celebrities are doing them, so I figured I'd give them a whirl. I am not an experienced exerciser--I am not totally out of shape but I do not enjoy working out either. To me it is a necessary evil that I try to keep up with whenever I have time.

After the first time I did the workout, my legs and glutes were so sore that I could not do the DVD again for 2 days because it was too painful! But in a good way--I knew I was getting what I wanted, which was a good workout for my muscles. I was doing Taebo before this and I had never felt the burn so much with those videos.

I have now been doing this pilates video about 3-4 times a week for 3 weeks, and I have to admit that I feel better about myself. I don't necessarily look any different yet, but I feel leaner and stronger than I was before.

The good thing about this DVD is that it is broken into sections based on the movement being done. So sometimes, for variation, I will do the Taebo video for cardio purposes, and then do the matwork section of the pilates video to complement it.

Overall, this is a great pilates video, at least for beginners like me. I can't speak for the more advanced folks, but I found this DVD very easy to follow--the instructions are clear, the instructor is nice and not annoying, and there is an end result you can feel.",1095033600,6,1508,4.136518771331058

Pilates is a mind-body coordination exercise, you need to be aware of your core (contracting, navel to spine) and breathing correctly. when i do any workout, i like to use the imagery of blowing a pinwheel with a strong controlled breath out, and a nice deep breath in on the inhale. that may increase your results with any exercise and video. oxygen to your muscles. this video is filled with fun, energetic and innovative moves. cardio great, the music is great (like a latin/jungle sound),i crank it up!!! sometimes i substitute the floorwork with another pilates video, to change up the routine. you work it all out here. and the result is a long, lean body with tone. she keeps you motivated, works you thighs like no other..i hate and love her for that! you will get a great workout if you pay attention to form and breathe correctly. she also has a website BUFFGIRLFITNESS.COM which is also motivating and very knowledgable. complement this workout with a pilates mat video, bellydance, hula, and yoga(joy of yoga)...even CRUNCH'S cardio sculpt(need hand weight, but also fun,motivating and effective).

1891064,4,B00009V7QE,"This workout won't give you the cardio intensity of a kickboxing or step workout - BUT this is a great little workout to put on top of your cardio work - it's good pilates training with great instruction and burns a few extra calories, too.",1093219200,3,240,4.355555555555555
1891065,5,B00009V7QE,"I must say, this is my new favorite workout video. The first part (the cardio part) is not exactly ""pilates,"" but it's a great workout that is not overly repetative. I've worked out with Denise Austin's cardio videos before and just about put my foot through the TV because I was sooo sick of doing the same moves over and over. Ellen Barrett's workout does have repetition, but she throws in different variations and it moves so quickly it's hard to get bored.

The second half, the Pillates toning, is the most amazing portion if you want to target your abs. The ab exercises are brilliant! My abs have never felt so good! Plus, the moves aren't that complicated and even someone like me (who isn't that flexible) could do them!",1091664000,2,730,4.572519083969466

It's the first Pilates video I owned, and I'm really glad I learned from Ellen.  The cuing is excellent, and they always show her feet and legs when you learn a new move so you don't get confused or lost.  Effective and fun!",1090800000,4,387,4.333333333333333
1891067,2,B00009V7QE,"This workout is definitely NOT for the beginner!  I'm trying to get back into shape and rented this video from the library.  The instructor does a horrible job of cueing the movements.  I was constantly tripping over myself trying to keep up! The only good part of the video was the pilates mat exercises at the end.  However, that segment was MUCH too short! Don't waste your money on this!!",1090368000,4,392,4.557142857142857

Awesome!!!",1088985600,3,342,4.728813559322034

1891070,4,B00009V7QE,"If you don't want to gain muscle in your legs then this workout is not for you.  True, it isn't entirely pilates but then again, pilates wasn't made to be cardio.  This video does an excellent job of incorporating the two.  The instructor is my favorite.  Its a pity she doesn't do more videos.  The other women in the video have amazing and realistic looking bodies.  They're fun to watch and definitely inspire.
One of my favorite aspects of the video is that I never got bored with it.  Every time you are about to get restless Ellen incorporates a small but beneficial variation, such as an arm movement or changing the pace.
I didn't give it five stars for two reasons.  One, the cardio portion isn't long enough.  I wanted more!  And secondly, the second half which is pilates mat work for toning, not long enough either.  You got a taste of some pilates mat work but not enough to be considered a work out.
I would supplement this with Crunch's Pick Your Spot Pilates to cover the toning outside of your legs which will burn burn burn!!!",1086998400,10,1044,4.470899470899471
1891071,2,B00009V7QE,This is more of an aerobic workout than pilates. The instructor continiously trys to convince you that you are doing pilates but really you are doing aerobics. There is a short pilates mat workout at the end that is good but the rest is not pilates. Don't waste your time.,1085961600,,272,4.46
1891072,4,B00009V7QE,"I'm very particular about my exercise videos.  I feel they need to be clear and concise, and doable.  And enjoyable.  I thought the video was all of these things.  It was easy enough for me to get how they wanted me to move and what I was supposed to do so that after only a few workouts I wasn't stumbling through the video not sure of what was next.  Instead I was having a really good workout.  The one thing I don't like about the dvd is the music and the ridiculous man drumming in the back.  I would LOVE the option to be able to turn the music off and listen to my own, but it doesn't exist.  Does this stop me from wanting to do it?  No, in fact this dvd has a permanent home in my player and has to be moved so I can watch other things, but it always goes back in so I can do it everyday.",1084665600,,797,3.8404907975460123
1891073,4,B00009V7QE,"Fat-Burning Pilates consists of two separate routines:  a 26-minute cardiovascular workout (the ""fat-burning"" part) followed by 14-minutes of matwork (the ""Pilates"" part).  The cardio section is Pilates-inspired in that instructor Ellen Barrett frequently reminds you to keep your abdominal core area tight, and she also adapts a few traditional Pilates floor exercises to be performed in a standing position.  Overall, however, this segment consists of standard, low-impact aerobics moves such as squats, knee lifts, step-touch, and also some ballet-inspired exercises.  Although this part of the workout is fast-paced enough to raise your heart rate, given the extended warm-up period (7 minutes) as well the low-intensity nature of the movements, advanced beginner to intermediate exercisers will probably find this to be a light aerobic workout at best.  The cardio section concludes with two short sets of Pilates-style pushups.
Following the cardio workout, you move to the floor for more traditional Pilates matwork.  Ellen begins with The Hundred and continues with moves from the classic Pilates stomach series.  However, she also adds her own twists to many of the Pilates exercises as well as suggests easier modifications.  Most of this section is performed while lying on your back, but there are a few exercises done from stomach down, kneeling, and seated positions (none of the Pilates side kick series exercises are included).  This entire section went by very quickly, and at the same time, my core felt challenged by only a few of the movements.
Ellen is a likeable, friendly instructor who provides good form pointers, but she frequently fails to adequately cue new movements, which makes it initially difficult to learn some of the moves.  The workout is performed on the standard Crunch set with a room full of about 10 participants.  In addition to the background music, there is a live drummer on set; some other reviewers didn't like the drummer, but I found him to be an interesting, non-distracting element.  Overall, this is a nice workout for those who enjoy blended routines and who are looking for some fresh twists on the traditional Pilates exercises.",1084060800,55,2184,5.280346820809249
1891074,4,B00009V7QE,"Having had a one-year break from the gym, I found this low-impact workout to be tough enough to get my heartrate up. I have never taken a pilates or yoga class, so I can't speak for the pilates part. Though I occassionally experience knee problems after excercising, I do not, like another reviewer pointed out, have any problems after this workout.
Overall a pretty good and easy to follow excercise tape, maybe a bit too short. I'm going to get a pilates video also, so I can learn the proper postures and techniques. Though the instructor talks about ""the core,"" she does not explain the form in detail.",1081987200,2,606,4.62037037037037
1891075,5,B00009V7QE,"""Have fun, work hard and get ready to change your body."" ~Ellen Barrett

Ellen has created an energetic, highly creative routine to encourage you to develop long, lean sexy muscles. This workout is also filled with intense leg work and you will burn those calories. In fact, the first time I did this workout, I broke into a full-body sweat which I guess is a good thing and has rarely happened when using workout DVDs. I had no idea that a Pilates workout could bring that type of intensity to my day.

Ellen is an excellent instructor who is not only highly creative; she keeps you focused on perfect posture. She has cute names for various moves, like angel arms or elegant arms. She adds a real sexy feminine touch to this workout all while subtly motivating you to a heightened level of determination.

The routine starts with a Dance-based cardio routine. Ellen incorporates Pilates moves into a low-impact, but rather fast-paced (nothing is slow, let me tell you) cardio section. The warm-up is quite effective and by the time you do the stretching, you are warm enough for the stretching to count. If you have knee problems, this might not be for you. I noticed that as you become stronger, you can handle the knee bends in this workout. I could not have handled these moves a few months ago. Ellen focuses on the ""powerhouse"" throughout both sections.

The second mat-based Pilates Floorwork Routine is best done in bare feet and a yoga mat is quite useful. You start flat on your back, which feels good after all the dancing. She starts with the ""hundred"" with a focus on breathing. Then, you move to scissors, single-leg pull, double-leg stretch, crisscross and back extensions.

If you are familiar with Jennifer Kries' workouts or Winsor Pilates, this will all be very familiar to you. A new move is the ""arrowhead"" which I've never seen in any workout before. This workout also includes the Child's pose from yoga. The hip circles are challenging, but there are modifications.

Lime green/Periodot, purple/Amethyst, orange/Citrine, red/Ruby are the colors you will find in this workout. The stone textured floor and wall in the back give this workout an almost primitive-dance feel. Of course the cute drummer on the left at the back of the room adds to the appeal. The sapphire yoga mats add to this jewel-toned set.

You will love the music in this workout because it changes in intensity just when you need an extra boost of energy. I'm watching this again while typing and I can hardly sit here because I just want to go do this routine again. The music is highly motivational.

Crunch: Fat-Burning Pilates might just be the Pilates workout you have been craving. It truly will leave you feeling more alive, polished and definitely glowing. After finishing this workout, you might start to feel a sense of tranquility, have more passion for your life and think more clearly throughout your day.

Also look for ""Crunch Pick Your Spot Pilates""
Winsor Pilates is also perfect for anyone who is just learning the Pilates moves.

1891076,1,B00009V7QE,"I've taken pilates classes at my gym and was looking for a good home video for days that I couldn't get out.  First of all, I agree with the reviewer that said that this is not for those with ""sensitive knees"" (like myself).  Mine were aching by the end of the video (and not the ""good"" kind of workout ache).  I was also turned off by the other ""class members"" on the video--they look like strippers.  I've never been to a gym where everyone looks like THAT.  The instruction was poor, form was not emphasized and the video feels more like power yoga than real pilates.  I'm going to try to return it for a different DVD.",1078876800,21,622,4.273504273504273
1891077,5,B00009V7QE,"As a self-professed dance freak, I loved this workout.  It got my heart pumping and a little winded at times.  I could feel the sweat pouring onto my mat near the end as well.  But for those of the traditionalist Pilates fans who just won't give it a rest, the cover DOES say Pilates-INSPIRED moves.  Pilates equipment is expensive and I think that this is a great alternative.  I like to alternate this with the NYC Ballet workout and Fat Burning Yoga and am getting great results.",1078790400,,482,4.494252873563219
1891078,4,B00009V7QE,"I have a few pilates tapes that I quickly got bored of.  By including the cardio as well as a mat workout, it breaks up the 45 minutes and keeps you motivated like an aerobics class.  The squats are great and I'm already seeing results.  Great way to find a mix between cardio and mat pilates.",1078790400,,293,4.196428571428571
1891079,5,B00009V7QE,I love this video. I've owned it for a few months and have only started using it recently. It's amazing. I'm already seeing results that I've never seen with other workouts. The instructor is not at all annoying and the people working out with her don't smile in that really creepy and false way that I see in so many other videos. It's an interesting and fun workout. I used to weigh 190 and now I'm down to 165. This video is awesome and I recommend it to anyone who wants to do pilates and lose weight.,1077148800,11,505,4.216494845360825
1891080,4,B00009V7QE,"I like this workout for its full body approach.  The first part of the workout is standing pilates work.  Some is a like ballet, and some is like old school aerobics.  Together it's a fun routine that is not hard to follow.  It gets my heart rate up a little, but not enough to really replace a cadio workout.  The mat section is pretty short, but it does have a few exercises for most of the major groups.  Some of the exercises are difficult especially the first time, but there are some modifications.  The people in the workout are colorful and not that annoying, and the guy playing the drums for the workout is very entertaining.  I think this is a great workout for cross training days.",1075248000,,693,4.4015748031496065
1891081,5,B00009V7QE,"I LOVE this workout!  I bought it on New Years Day and have been addicted ever since and doing it everyday.  Ellen is the best instructor that I've encountered yet. Her voice is not annoying and she motivates and gives clear instructions.  I had never done pilates before this video, but she gave me a pretty good understanding of how to use my muscles and breathe.  I saw results the first week, mainly my legs, arms and thighs.  The squats are working magic.  This workout is good for beginners and not too difficult to follow.  Everytime I use the video I get better.  I'm more limber, energized, my waist is shrinking and my abs are getting defined. I love Ellen and I recommend this video to all you Momma's trying to get back into shape that don't have time to go to the gym.  Give it a try, stick with it, you will see results fast.",1074297600,33,839,4.326923076923077
1891082,5,B00009V7QE,I was very impressed with Barrett's workout.  It's safe to say that this video is good for the beginner as well as the advanced fitness nut.

1891083,5,B00009V7QE,"Although I thoroughly enjoyed this very challenging workout for a good six weeks, my knees would not take all the squats any more. If you have some extra weight, just bad knees or previous problems with repeated squats, this may not be a good choice. I'm putting it on reserve for when I have less weight and less pressure on my knees.",1074124800,32,335,4.419354838709677
1891084,3,B00009V7QE,"This was a decent workout but I think it may be a little difficult for someone just starting to excercise.  The instructor was good and the the first segment with the cardio routine involves a lot of squats and leg work.
I think the name was a bit decieving since it is not your ""traditional"" pilates.  Also, because breathing is such an important aspect of pilates, I did not think she provided enough guidance on when to inhale and exhale during the second section. Other than that, it was a decent workout.",1070582400,,509,4.521739130434782
1891085,4,B00009V7QE,"I was surprised to see how much of this video was more like aerobics and less like Pilates.  The instructor really takes Pilates moves and speeds them up into a cardio work out.  The work out itself is not too difficult... the challenge comes at the end, when you do real Pilates stretches.
I would suggest this video to anyone who can't get to the gym and wants a bit of cardio and Pilates.
The best thing about this video is the drummer in the background who drums tribal beats while you work out.  I've never seen ""live"" musicians on a work out video before..... interesting.",1068681600,4,578,4.433962264150943
1891086,1,B00009V7QE,"The production is good. But as a studio owner and certified instructor from the New York School, I see a growing division between traditional Pilates (the way Joseph Pilates originally created his method) and variations of traditional Pilates. This DVD is a depiction of nontraditional Pilates.  The exercise orders are not Joseph Pilates' original exercise orders, there is not a seamless flow between exercises, and there is music playing. Joseph Pilates did not play music because each exercises has its own rhythm, dynamic, and tempo to be determined by the instructor during a given lesson.
It is important to protect the public interest by labeling products properly. Most other professions have a state licensing board to protect the public interest, but the art and practice of the Pilates method does not. To properly describe this video, perhaps video producers should call this workout a Pilates-based exercise routine.",1068163200,9,930,5.326530612244898
1891087,5,B00009V7QE,"I recently started doing pilates, and I really like it as a supplement to my regular weightlifting and cardio routine. This DVD is very good, because it has good music and is NEVER boring or repetitive. It combines cardio, dance moves, and pilates matwork to stregthen your abs, back, and legs. It doesn't do much for your arms, except there is a part where you do some push-ups.

I've tried others, but no other has truly stuck as much as this one has over the years.  I first purchased it when I was 22 (a hard copy), and I'm 32 now and own the digital version.  I guess I love it so much I bought it twice. :)  Although I try to mix it up, I feel best when I do this workout at least once a week.  Ellen does a great job of explaining things simply but effectively, so much so I believe anyone can follow and get it the first time through, and even improve after a few more.  I love that this feels like both a workout and a stretching session, which relieves tension rather than creates more. Lots of squats and the arms are always very active in every element.  Contrary to other reviews, I do break a sweat every time!..even as my fitness level has gradually improved over the years.  The moves are basic and may even fool you into thinking they are ""easy"" and not worth your time the first time around.  I have to humbly disagree.  I have been able to maintain definition in my abs and arms, and I don't do much besides walking on the treadmill in addition to this.  For reference, I would say I have an average level of fitness; I'm on my feet a lot but don't naturally get more than 4,000 steps per day unless I make a concerted effort. (For further reference, I trained for a 5K a few short months ago for the first time and ran it in 31 minutes.)  I'm 5'5"" and fluctuate between 122-125 pounds.  My least fit area has always been my core, and this workout targets it in practically every move.  I'm also a terrible breather (hence the 10 minute miles?), so I appreciate the focus on the breath in this workout.  I'm so glad I discovered this DVD ten years ago and am grateful it continues to be a workout staple for me.  Thanks for a true gem, Ellen/Crunch!",1502668800,,1904,4.203856749311295
