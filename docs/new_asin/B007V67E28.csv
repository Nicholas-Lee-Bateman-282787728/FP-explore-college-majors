8522150,2,B007V67E28,"This movie was one of those Timo Struckmann movies that I think are largely made by re-enactors. This one would have been OK except, that the STUPID love story wrapped into the film was superfluous and dumb. There were other aspects of the plot that failed as well. The main character's girlfriend's father was an anti-nazi and somehow Timo gets him freed from the Gestapo with a rather amateurish action. In addition, Timo plays the same character, more or less as he did in Brother's War. You know the type...the good guy German Hauptmann that is an anti-nazi and a courageous patriot and blah blah blah. The acting is pretty amateurish and the story is very dumb. I was torn between 2 versus 1 star, but gave it 2 due to the cool equipment the re-enactors had.",1467504000,,763,4.576642335766423
