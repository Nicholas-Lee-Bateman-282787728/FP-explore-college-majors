8071002,4,B000A0EC2C,"THE TUBES VIDEO, is the result of turning a band loose in a studio with a budget to sling together a video for most songs on any given album.

The DIFFERENCE, is that with a wierdly talented group, Like THE TUBES, you get weirdly fascinating results.

This VIDEO is a time capsule of MTV's early burst for videos to go with every FM hit. Since there weren't enough...strange little groups got airplay, and good videos got A LOT of airplay.

THE TUBES VIDEO contains several songs that were catchy and innocuous, and at least one hit that the video KILLED, ""Hey Sports Fans.""

The straight-in totally nude strut (showing all) of Fee WaybilL who then proceeds to dress, and be dressed, gladiator/knight style, in various sports gear, ALL AT THE SAME TIME, Not only wasted a dramatic moment for his first nude frontal, but because it caused the video to be ""banned,"" resulting in a lost a performance of the, as yet, undiscovered talent of Cynthia Rhodes (Flashdance/Dirty Dancin'.)

Okay, that forgiven, THE TUBES, run through several set designes and basically have a few concept videos and several ""performance"" videos where basically the entire band stands and plays the song, concert-style.

This was pretty straight-forward for its day. But, The TUBES are ANYTHING BUT STRAIGHT-FORWARD. As an example, on one song, the band stands there and plays on an ankle-deep flooded soundstage.

The TUBES VIDEO, even with the brief frontal nudity, is worth a watch, and for TUBES fans, a MUST. It is also good for those who collect early MTV-era movies/videos. There were only a few artists that got to release a VIDEO ALBUM, The KINKS concert video/live Album, BLONDIE's Video Album, DURAN DURAN-The Videos, etc. so in that respect this is a rarity.

A CAVEAT: The LASERDISC version has a censorship issue, a BLUE BOX floats in front of said nude WAYBILL, and is way more distracting than protective. It seems the discs were pressed in JAPAN and they have a ""pubic hair"" ban in their media, so it was declared obscene, and not allowed to be shown. This issue ruins an otherwise fine example of early 80's video albums.",1169942400,2,2112,4.814917127071824
8071003,4,B000A0EC2C,Some will say it's campy some that it tries too hard but this Video compilation of the Tubes concept album that pokes fun at the emerging phenomenon of yuppies is a gutsy and entertaining view all in all. The vintage footage of a live White punks on dope performance at the end is worth the price of the video! I wish it were available now. I have it on LaserDisc with Japanese subtitles and Fay Waybills' naughty bits blocked out on a couple videos I would like to get a domestic copy to get rid of both those.,1130544000,3,511,4.224489795918367
