7957648,4,B000060MU0,"I was just looking for some gospel on DVD when I ran accross this WOW 2002 DVD... It starts out w/CeCe Winans and gets even better.... 'bout halfway through ... you're lifting your hands in praise with Yolanda Adams...Swaying in the Spirit with Fred Hammonds, Stompin with John P. Kee and dancing with Bishop T.D. Jakes & Richard Smallwood..  Indeed this DVD... was More Than What I wanted and everything i ever had...",1028073600,9,418,4.726027397260274
7957649,3,B000060MU0,"Definately a big improvement over the WoW Gospel 2001, the 2002 DVD is getting better. However, if these are the best music videos in Christian music, then I don't want to see the second best ones! Also, whoever is leading this 'coalition' needs to work on using the DVD format to it's fullest. Subtitles are missing still, and with Music videos of live events the WoW people could make use of the angle button everyone has! Anyway, its still getting better- hope 2003 brings the glory of god to everyone again!",1027728000,,511,4.626373626373627

Being that this is the first DVD in my gospel collection, it's was a great introduction to some of the artists in Gospel arenathat  The Live performances from the various artists were very uplifting and spirtually charged!!  I have already recommended this DVD to a few people who have also felt blessed by it.  My children (6 & 13) love to hear the songs over and over...of course they have their favorites.  My 6 yr old loves ""I Believe"" by John P. Kee, and my 13 yr old loves ""Calvary"" by Richard Smallwood w/Vision. To tell you the truth, I love the entire DVD, and I'm sure you will too!!",1017014400,3,679,4.357142857142857
