8208208,1,B000T9FV0Q,"I do not know whether the point of these films in this genre is to make them so bad that they are a parody of a parody of a parody. Terrible cinematography, zero acting, tragic special-effects (nothing special about them), a plot way beyond cliche, this film is, frankly, like a few friends with zero talent but a liking for 'filums' with enough money from some source or other to toss down a large latrine thought the resulting travesty would be funny. It isn't. Don't waste your money, time, brain cells, your life by sticking this in the DVD player let alone seeing it through to the end. I needed a few beers after this, and not for the reasons I had anticipated.",1388707200,,667,4.430894308943089
8208209,4,B000T9FV0Q,"I have only seen Within The Woods, aka Camp Blood 3, so far. I did enjoy that one. The quality is much better than the Camp Blood 1 and 2 on 3d Blu-ray, I must say. This should have went to Blu-ray for a more enjoyable purchase. Fantastic price for this set.",1369180800,,258,3.980769230769231
