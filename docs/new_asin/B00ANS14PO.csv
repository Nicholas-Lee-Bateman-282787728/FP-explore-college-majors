8554865,5,B00ANS14PO,"On this DVD, Accounting 101, he explains the difference between accounting software and doing it by hand. He explains how and why accounting is so important in owning a business. He even shows you step by step how to do it by hand, how to create the different financial statements and how to show if a business is profitable or not. In my opinion, whether you have taken accounting before like myself or not, it is a great DVD to have to teach you or even refresh your mind on accounting.",1356998400,,488,4.373626373626373
8554866,5,B00ANS14PO,"This video is very unique. I don't think I ever saw accounting explained in such a clear way. In this video, the author shows you how accounting works in the real world by using a very simple business. He first started the business and recorded transactions, and then, prepared simple but real financial statements. It was really nice to see how all the statements came together and how they are connected to each other.

If you already know accounting, then this video is probably going to be too easy for you, but if you are looking to learn accounting, I think you will benefit by watching this video.",1355702400,,604,4.592592592592593
8554867,5,B00ANS14PO,"I really enjoyed watching this video. It was pretty clever how he used a ballroom dance studio to demonstrate the basics of accounting. He first showed how all the individual transactions are recorded into the accounting ledger and then, he used this information to create the three financial statements. I think that seeing how the financial statements are prepared from A to Z is really helpful. Too many investors try to understand financial statements without having a concept of how these financial statements are prepared.  I believe that real life examples such as the ballroom dance studio example help people retain the information learned instead of the information going from one ear and out the other!  The information would then come in handy when evaluating different investing choices.",1355443200,2,800,5.2421875
