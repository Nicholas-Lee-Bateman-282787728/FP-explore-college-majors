2225731,5,B0007P0XDM,"This movie is more like a documentary, but it shows you everything you need to know about NASCAR; from building a car from the floor up and more. It helped me understand alot about the behind the scenes of racing that I didn't know before.",1108252800,5,239,4.333333333333333
2225732,2,B0007P0XDM,"Although, the ""action"" was good. The close up footage was not from a real race or of actual Cup cars for that year. Also, the drivers' true identities were hidden by the visors. A real follower or fan of the NASCAR Cup Series would find that to be very irritating and hard to watch. For the casual fan, this DVD would be a worthwhile purchase.",1107993600,2,343,4.292307692307692

If you don't know what stock car racing is, this is a film that will introduce you to the everyday grind of what the sport is all about.  I loved it!!  This is a must if you have surround sound in your home.  The audio is the next best thing to being there.  I took away a star because there were some scenes that were best suited for the IMAX format and not the small screen.  But don't let the star downgrade fool ya!

I looked forward to watching this at home in 3-D, as I have with other 3-D Imax titles.  Shame on you guys for being so cheap!  I won't buy this,  just because of that.  Stop screwing over the 3-D fans!  It would not kill you to include the 3-D option, as you have with other Imax films!",1107388800,3,463,3.967391304347826

2225737,5,B0007P0XDM,"As a die hard NASCAR fan, this movie was unbelievable!  The images look so crystal clear, you could almost feel the the texture of the asphalt as you ride along.  Great 3D effect, though towards the end I had a slight headache due to eye strain.  The sound was the most authentic reproduction of a NASCAR race I've ever heard.  The engines roar as loud and beefy as being at the track.  Certainly a must see.  Even the non-NASCAR fans will enjoy it and perhaps become interested in the greatest sport in the world.  Only one thing that bothered me about the film was the fact that there are certain things that you wanted to see in focus... that weren't (hence the eye strain headache).  If you can get a seat in the back of the theater...perhaps the eye strain would be less.  Other than that... it's the best IMAX movie out there now.  A must see, and I'm buying a copy when it hits the shelves on DVD.  Not just 2 thumbs up... all ten digits up!",1091145600,2,948,4.269662921348314
2225738,5,B0007P0XDM,"This is a must see experience for everyone who has even the slightest interest in stock car racing.  The 3-D effects are awesome and brings you up close to what goes on behind what you see on the track. You felt as though you could just reach out and touch the cars, drivers and pit crew!  It was also informative, giving the history of the history of how NASCAR got it's start.
It's an experience you won't want to miss!",1088208000,,421,4.25
2225739,5,B0007P0XDM,"The people at IMAX have taken the realm of 3D filmmaking to an entirely new level with this insiders view of the world of NASCAR stock car racing.  The movie, filmed entirely in 3D, features a cinematic experience that puts the audience in the driver's seat of one the truly great spectator sports.
The movie, narrated by Kiefer Sutherland, is a comprehensive, behind-the-scenes look at the history behind NASCAR, as well as an in-depth look at the engineers, designers, spotters, drivers and fans that make NASCAR the second most popular spectator sport today.  Featuring interviews with many of today's most popular drivers and rising stars, this film also showcases many of NASCAR's most famous families, including the history of the multi-generation Pettys and Earnhardts, whose names are as synonymous to stock-car racing as Tiger Woods is to golf.
The film also takes an in-depth look at the intense engineering that goes into developing today's stock-car.  With an insider's look at Rousch Racing, Hendrick Motorsports and DEI, audiences will be given an in-depth look at the immense team of people and parts that make these cars the most powerful and complicated machines on the racing circuit.
Ultimately, though, the fans will be given a special treat as they are transported from spectator to driver in the final portion of the film.  By brilliantly using the IMAX 3D technology, audiences will weave between cars, drive bumper-to-bumper, and race around some of NASCAR's most famous tracks at 180+ miles an hour as they ride along with their favorite drivers.
With a soundtrack that boasts 20,000 watts of power, the film promises an experience thats as close as it gets to being behind the wheel of these immensely powerful and popular race cars.  For anyone who is unfamiliar with the sport, this is a great introduction to NASCAR, and for those that have longed to get behind the wheel, here finally is your chance to have the ultimate experience: The NASCAR Experience!

There was NOTHING in the DVD that came even close to being in the ""driver's seat."" I was expecting a camera view letting the viewer experience the ride from the driver's seat. I was very disappointed, and for an avid follower of NASCAR, it was too mild for my husband. There was nothing new or exciting in it that he hadn't seen before.",1438387200,2,548,4.6020408163265305

2225816,4,B0007P0XDM,"I was born and raised in the Heartland of America. High school students around this area of the country still have illegal drag races every now and again down a dirt lane. NASCAR has always been big around here, long before it began capturing the attention of the mainstream public interest. However, I've never been a NASCAR fan. NASCAR races never captured my attention that other sports and activities did. In fact, until about a month ago, I still viewed the sport as largely being expensive ""hick entertainment"" (I'm a hick myself).

Seeing NASCAR: THE IMAX EXPERIENCE changed my opinion of the sport. The movie provides a very brief explanation of the history of the sport and touches on many of the different elements that go into building and creating a successful racing organization and team. The movie is fairly short (around 50 minutes) which won't seem very long for those who already have a serious interest in NASCAR. However, for a person like me who is a complete novice to the sport, I found the movie to be both entertaining and educational. I was impressed and gained a new found appreciation for NASCAR.

2225838,5,B0007P0XDM,"I'm a die-hard NASCAR fan.  Been for a long time.  Having said that, I'm writing this review with complete objectivity now.
The movie is great to introduce NASCAR to people who are starting to have an interest but do not wish to read an encyclopedia about it.  It's a 50-minute film with Kiefer Sutherland narrating.  He definitely sounds like he's reading from the script that he doesn't exactly know where to put emotion or emphasis, but he gets the point across rather well.
The movie is dated.  Since this thing was filmed, there have been many changes to NASCAR (car design, race format, Chase format, etc) but you get a nice taste of history and very good (albeit brief) overview of how NASCAR existed and exists today.  If you *really* wanted to understand NASCAR, get out that encyclopedia and watch race after race after race.
My young son who is interested in NASCAR likes it and got a better idea of why daddy is glued to the TV set every Sunday (or Saturday night).
The soundtrack is pretty awesome if you're really into this type of stuff.  I thought the music was very appropriate for the scenes and the camera angles were quite impressive.
I saw this when it came out in IMAX and it was sweet then.  I understand it isn't IMAX on my TV but that doesn't detract from it.
Plus it's really funny to see how young some of the drivers were back when this was filmed...like Jimmie Johnson and Ryan Newman.  Even Dale Jr looks like a young pup.
I recommend for people who are fans of NASCAR.  I mean, if you really wanted great NASCAR films, you'd have to include this one with ""3,"" ""Days of Thunder,"" ""Stroker Ace,"" ""Six Pack"" and even Pixar's ""Cars.""",1371600000,,1660,4.503333333333333

2225845,3,B0007P0XDM,This is a decent movie if you aren't a Nascar fan. Will definitly get you into the sport for a first-timer. My main complaint is that I bought this on DVD when it was first released. When I saw it the box and coverart both boasted the 3D release of the film. It was not originally released as Nascar Imax but as Nascar Imax in 3D in huge letters. I would have been happy with just an anagliph presentation but didn't even get that. Also as far as extras? Don't hold your breath. There aren't any. Just a 2D presentation for a 40 minute movie. They could have at least included an anaglyph version on the same disc as there was plenty of wasted data space. Glad to see attention paid to my favorite sport but don't advertise that you are releasing a 3D movie when you really aren't. Dissapointed.,1237507200,,795,4.306666666666667
2225846,3,B0007P0XDM,"The overall impact is fine, but this isn't the title to get if you were wanting gritty realism paired to IMAX. Examples: in one scene a crash is shown from a distance, and they animate in a tire (which detaches and flies straight for the camera.) And they put an IMAX camera in a cup car and send a group out in a non-race situation, and then constantly refer back to this footage *as if* it was showing racing action. Its a staged interpretation of racing. The overall effect of the movie is fine, but it lacks intensity- and the intensity it tries to create is usually phony.",1230249600,,577,4.351851851851852

NASCAR - The IMAX Experience is a good place to start for those who have not followed NASCAR  closely, or who have never attended a NASCAR race. The plot line of the movie briefly covers the history of NASCAR including its well-known roots in moonshine running all cleverly recreated, and then  loosely follows the pre race prep of a typical team. Behind the scenes footage at this point is very good and the race scenes are also good. To get five stars I would have wished for much much more onboard footage and for cameras to be placed in strategic locations to open up the behind the scenes activities during the race. That's a lot to ask for but there it is.
Overall, a good film at a very reasonable price that would appeal to novice or younger NASCAR enthusiasts.",1191974400,,940,5.344594594594595

I bought this DVD for my son for his birthday a couple of weeks ago.  It's really interesting and well done.  I watch it having already been brought up to speed on the sport; I know nearly all the drivers, their sponsors, and their car numbers.  But I imagine this documentary would be nearly as fascinating to newbies, mostly because of the IMAX treatment -- cameras putting you ""right there,"" in this case right down on the track as cars whip by.

The DVD includes a good history lesson and great explanations of how a track functions on race day.  The pit crews get proper treatment, too.  One criticism is that few individual races or drivers are highlighted; perhaps the filmmakers simply wanted to emphasize the ""experience.""

Sadly, this isn't the case.  Granted, the movie is a NASCAR fans dream with lots of great historical information on the creation of the sport, an in-depth look behind-the-scenes at how the cars are made, what all goes into setting up the pits at the races, etc. and so on.  Plus, some wonderful in-car and racing with the vehicles perspectives.  But, without the 3D experience, the movie is just not what it could have been.  There is still a LOT of room left on this DVD for the field-sequential video edition, plus other interesting extras like a making-of featurette (which is strangely missing for an IMAX disc).

2225906,4,B0007P0XDM,"I come from the heart of NASCAR country, and I have a lot of race memories going back a good quarter of a century now.  I love racing, but I really haven't been able to watch it since that black day when Dale Earnhardt lost his life at Daytona; I doubt I'll ever be able to watch another Daytona 500 as long as I live.  Still, I'd love to get past the loss of the Man in Black and make NASCAR a part of my Sunday rituals once again.  That's the main reason I decided to watch NASCAR: The IMAX Experience.  Of course, I have only seen it in the privacy of my own home, so I can't speak to the actual IMAX theatre experience.  It's a good show, but I guess I was just expecting a little bit more out of it.

The main limitation of the film is its length; you can only say so much about the rich history of NASCAR in forty-eight minutes.  There's a decent look at the origins of the sport, but most of the historical attention is placed on a select few superstars of years past.  The behind-the-scenes look at the way cars are built and maintained is excellent, but many of the really technical aspects of car design are not covered - you'll get a quick picture of the way drafting works, but pushing and pulling, for example, aren't covered at all.  You do get a good sense of the time and expense that goes in to making each and every race happen, though.  Pit crews and spotters are given their due, and rightly so, and you also get a small taste of tail-gating and driver interaction with the public.  That interaction goes a long way toward making NASCAR the fan success it is.  You also get to hear from a few wives who bear the tough burden of being married to a driver, and this discussion easily spills over into a discussion of safety.  Several drivers also make comments throughout the film, but all too often, the actual driver is not identified - if you can't recognize the voice, you won't know who is speaking on several occasions.  I thought the selection of driver comments was also too limited, as some big names are left out entirely.  The big thrills supposedly come from the IMAX footage of on-the-track action, but there's nothing all that special about the footage outside of an IMAX theatre setting.  Frankly, I don't think the non-3D experience matches the footage you can see on your own television set come the next race Sunday.

If you're an established NASCAR fan, you may not get all that much out of NASCAR: The IMAX Experience, although you will surely find it enjoyable.  Those new to the sport, however, can get a good sense of the excitement and enthusiasm the sport generates among its fans.  You won't feel the thunder of the engines in your gut, though.  Nothing, not even NASCAR: The IMAX Experience, compares to the excitement generated on any given race day.",1118361600,23,2796,4.413255360623782
2225907,2,B0007P0XDM,"Unlike some of the other detractors of this DVD. I don't care about it not being 3-D or whatever.  I was let down in a big way.  I am not a big NASCAR fan, but I do live&breathe motorsport , so I thought ""what the heck,this looks good"". While it served as a decent documetary,with interesting facts and so on. I felt the ""action"" portion of the program is what let me down.  Simon Wincer missed the mark as far a I'm concerned.  The hodge-podge editing of multiple tracks/events as one raceday seemed contrived. Just my humble opinion.",1116806400,,535,4.428571428571429
2225917,3,B0007P0XDM,"There would be no point in denying that ""NASCAR: The IMAX Experience"" loses a little something in its transference to the small screen.  However, it's still an eye-popping documentary for both diehard racing fans and those viewers who know little or nothing about the sport - although the hardcore aficionados might wish there had been a little less talk on the soundtrack and a little more action on the racetrack to make the experience a more compelling and complete one.

This comes as a bit of a surprise, especially considering the fact that the film was originally shot in the 3-D IMAX format.  One might reasonably expect that the movie would be little more than a succession of speeding cars and hurtling objects aimed directly at the stunned eyes of the audience.  Not so, for the movie actually spends far more time on the nuts-and-bolts, behind-the-scenes aspects of NASCAR than on the racing itself.  The film provides a brief background on the organization's less-than-savory moonshine roots, then proceeds to fill us in on various aspects of the sport itself, including the construction, specifications and testing of the cars, the training of the pit crews, the loyalty of the fans, etc.  It also takes time out to honor the memory of the late racing great Dale Earnhardt, although due to the film's rather meager 49 minute running time, the tribute, like virtually everything else in the movie, comes across as a little more halfhearted and perfunctory than, perhaps, in all good conscience, it should.

To get most of the racing shots, director Simon Wincer strapped his camera crew into vehicles of their own in order to provide audiences with an experience as close to the real thing as possible.  The majority of these sequences come in the last ten minutes or so of the film.  As with all IMAX productions, the clarity and beauty of the picture is, indeed, a wonder to behold, with the colors literally leaping off the screen in many-hued splendor.  Even without 3-D glasses and a two-story sized screen, this is a great visual experience. Now if they could have just shown a little more racing...",1116115200,2,2118,4.874651810584958

2225919,4,B0007P0XDM,"As a huge NASCAR fan, we had to rush out and see this IMAX film.  While I had never seen something like this before, the experience itself was fascinating.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the driving scenes had to be created using special equipment.  It's not like they filmed this during an actual Daytona 500. Even if I had known this BEFORE going to see it, I still would have gone...because it was a rather cool experience.  I'm not quite sure how you will get the same effect at home - unless, of course, you have a heck of surround sound system and a mammoth TV!",1113696000,,589,4.232142857142857
2225920,4,B0007P0XDM,"I don't understand why they couldn't have released this in 3D.  The Imax movie, Santa vs the Snowman, was and so was Spy Kids 3D.  Other than that, it's as great as the four times I went to see it in the theatre.",1110931200,,212,3.9069767441860463
2225921,4,B0007P0XDM,"This was an entertaining disk, even for a non-NASCAR fan. And for informational purposes, the IMAX ratio is almost 1.33:1, I believe the actual ratio is 1.37:1 or therabouts, even with this modified you lose very little image as opposed to a typical theatrical presentation of 1.85 or 2.35:1 where you would lose a good portion of the image in most transfers. Bottomline: don't let the full frame scare you from this release.",1110585600,,425,4.835616438356165
2225922,5,B0007P0XDM,"This is an unbelievable movie.  I saw it at the IMAX theater and was blown away and now the DVD is almost as good.  I want to make a couple of things clear, however.  You people who are dogging this DVD for not being widescreen need to understand that the actual IMAX format is not widescreen.  It is 4:3, not 16:9.  It is IMAX for a reason.  This movie and other IMAX movies WILL not and SHOULD not be shown in widescreen format, because that is not the original IMAX format. You people should go see an IMAX movie and notice the square shaped picture and not the rectangle that normal movies are shown. Get a clue.  Another thing, making a 3-D DVD is not as simple as throwing in a pair of paper glasses.  You must have special equipment including a 3-D projector and special electronic glasses.  Even then it will not be the quality of IMAX.  Back to the DVD itself.  You will not be dissapointed.  Unbelievable picture and sound quality makes for the ultimate DVD experience.  You will love this movie.",1110585600,34,1006,4.4021739130434785

That's right. For some crazy reason they have decided to release this IMAX film only in full screen. Which leads me to wonder.......What were they thinking?!?!?!? I say throw the black flag at whoever came up with that decision!",1110153600,,401,4.506849315068493
