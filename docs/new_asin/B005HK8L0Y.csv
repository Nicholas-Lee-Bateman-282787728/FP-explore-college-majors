4702083,3,B005HK8L0Y,"I must consider myself one lucky guy having the blu ray of this performance, a dvd of the Paris Opera Ballet ""Jewels,"" the selections in the Choreography by Balanchine  collection, and memories of countless live performances by the New York City Ballet including, however vaguely by now, those by the performers on whom Balanchine choreographed the work (except Mimi Paul).

I have a soft spot for Emeralds.  Faur's music is as unlikely a choice as one can find for ballet, yet, is there music more haunting, more elegant, of a deeper green?  George Balanchine was a superb musician and he chose his scores very carefully.  He would say that if you are bored with the ballet, ""with my ballets I will give you music so you can close your eyes and just listen to it.""  With either the proceeds from a poker game (or maybe for doing some dances for a Broadway show) he commissioned from Hindemith a piece for piano and orchestra, requiring only that the piano part be easy enough for him to play. Thus came to be ""The Four Temperaments"" which he not only could play but would become one of his early NYCB masterpieces, and today danced world-wide.  So Faur, and the fine choices Balanchine made within the Faur canon. Balanchine had great affinity and affection for France and lived there for many years.  Maybe Violette Verdy inspired it the choice of Faur.  I guess emeralds themselves did too, and some persuasion from Nathan Milstein and Claude Arpels.  The ballet is very subtle, the steps never blazing, yet there are depths of emotion running  through it that sear without shouting.  Nothing like it happens again until the great ""Diamonds"" pas-de-deux.  The Paris Opera Ballet excels in Emeralds. The Mariinsky dancers do not convey through their movement an understanding of the music and are too overt in their approach, with the possible exception of Daria Sukhorukova (and I hope I am identifying the dancer correctly and not being unfair to somebody else) in the Mimi Paul part. At times I feel as if they were dancing exclusively to a count. The Mariinsky has cut the extraordinarily beautiful finale Balanchine incorporated around 1976 to the very moving music for death of Mlisande in Faur's Plleas et Melisande.  It changes the ""take-away"" character of the piece from what is shown here as just another allegro finale, to one of rapt melancholy, as dancers, almost one-by-one take leave of the stage, finally leaving only three of the boys walking diagonally across the stage to the front, and finally coming to rest in a genuflection with an arm outstretched beseeching? in awe? the courtain slowly falling.  Very apt conclusion, very moving if somewhat mysterious, somewhat analogous in feeling to the soloist carried aloft at the end of Serenade.  To see this ending, arguably Balanchine's final thought on Emeralds (""arguably"" because Balanchine was a known tinkerer with his pieces,.e.g. Apollo) you need to see the Paris Opera Ballet performance.  The Mariinsky does not give it to you. But if you see the Paris Opera Emeralds, I think you will see the best overall performance of Emeralds I have ever seen, on video or live, even by NYCB, Violette Verdy in her part excepted.  My appreciation, indeed love for Emeralds has grown through the years.  It was never meant to be a piece to cheer and clamor.  Ironically if one considers all the lip-service given to the relative independence of the individual components of the evening-length Jewels, the ending the Mariinsky chose to trim (presumably with the concurrance of The Balanchine Trust) very much sets the stage for the other pieces which are to follow.

""Rubies"" was a showpiece for Patricia MacBride and Edward Villela in equal dollops. In my memory nobody has come close since.  Nonetheless, the Mariinsky here is inspired. Irina Golub and Andrian Fadeyev dance vivaciously, rambunctiously, with great lan, making the quirky parts their own. Their virtuosity illustrates Balanchine's dictum about ""hear the dance, see the music."" It's a joy and the company excels in bringing Stravinsky's music vibrantly alive. Lyudmilla Sveshnikova is the excellent piano soloist. Of the three pieces that make up Jewels,""Rubies"" has always been the one that has travelled most on its own.  I remember seeing it in Paris in the early seventies, red costumes and all, but called ""Capriccio,"" following the NYCB penchant for dropping a ballet name for the title of the music.

For me, overall, ""Diamonds"" has always been choreographically a bit problematic. On the one hand, it contains an unquestioned masterpiece: the great pas-de-deux to the
third movement of Tchaikovsky D-Major (3rd)Symphony, his only symphony in a major key, suitably so for diamonds.  But, before getting there, Balanchine drops the first movement of the symphony, rightly thinking it undanceable: ""tempo di marcia funebre"" is Tchaikovsky's marking. ""Diamonds"" begins with the waltz-like second movement (puzzingly ""Alla tedesca"") for the corps and demi-soloists.  The patterns are quite wonderful, and in this performance beautifully filmed.  Yet to me this movement has always seemed not the freshest Balanchine; some of it as sumptuous, but warmed-over, Nutcracker snowflakes. Composers, choreographers, writers, artists recycle and play with variations of their own ideas.  The shortcoming I find here is that the context in which such ""reminiscences"" are proferred do not seem interesting enough. The Mariinsky corps dances beautifully and the movement is not long; not an ordeal.  This is followed by the eight minutes or so that make ""Diamonds"" a masterwork: andante elegiaco. Unlikely for a pas-de-deux, the partners enter from opposite sides in a diagonal that curves at times, as a grace note in movement embelishing the melancholy tune.  At the end of the movement, the pair will walk again to the same tune, but this time with the boy's arm around the girl's waist, with their movements again embelishing the tune, a most musical, cyclical closing to one of the great choreographic masterpieces from Balanchine's brain.  The fate of a ""Diamonds"" performance rests on these eight minutes. They are followed by a lively, fleeting scherzo, that lets the audience catch its collective breath from the beauty and intensity of the pas-de-deux, if indeed such were present. The final movement, fourth of the ballet, fifth of the symphony,is a Tchaikovsky polacca, the sort of music Balanchine has set before so successfully, indeed with lots of dancers in strong phalanxes,  jumping, lifting legs and arms to highly rhythmic music, so designed to bring down the house and send the audience home in a happy, if not triumphant mood.  Balanchine is a master at theatrical ""closings"" and has set the standard in many different ways. Perhaps his masterpieces in such closings are Bizet's Symphony in C, Tchaikovsky's Theme and Variations, the turns and swirls in Vienna Waltzes and ironically, the rather static finale to Stravinsky's Symphony in Three Movements. The finale to ""Diamonds"" is not up to those standards. Though certainly over years, by now, thousands have stood up and cheered. The Mariinsky executes all these group dances in Diamonds excellently with the virtuosity and discipline one would expect, but for me, without the thrill, I fear, the choreography has never provided me.  I wonder how I would have reacted to this, had I not been familiar with so much else by Balanchine, in this case, most particularly because both are set to a polonaise, the finale to Theme and Variations (from Tchaikovsky Suite No. 3).

Which brings us back to the great pas-de-deux.  Ulyana Lopatkina is a magnificent dancer, a very tall 5'9"" (175cm) for a female dancer, very strong without seeming muscular, with a flawless technique and a pure line, easily projected, and well versed in the Vaganova/Kirov/Mariinsky traditional style having been a pupil of Natalia Dudinskaya, the prima ballerina of the Kirov in the 1930's and 1940's. She is renowned for her Odette/Odile in Swan Lake and the eponymous Raymonda, but she is no stranger to Balanchine, having performed in Serenade, Symphony in C (2nd Mvt., another Balanchine masterwork pas-de-deux), La Valse, Ballet Imperial, etc. This performance of Jewels was recorded in 2006, when she was 34 or so, an age where she would be at or near the very peak of her powers artistically and physically.  Suzanne Farrell was 22 when this work was created on her.  Lopatkina's therefore is a performance that I approach with utmost respect.  Her dance is steeped in all that has made the Mariinsky, for over a century, the honorific, and for long periods, the very real, mother-house of ballet.  Her execution of the Balanchine choreography is flawless.  Yet the core of the piece I think has eluded her.  For this is not Petipa.  Even if the ""Diamonds"" pas-de-deux is set to Tchaikowsky, and flows from the brain of a Mariinsky alumnus, the piece is modern, its structure is modern, the choreography flows from the music, the body language on which it was created and for whom it was imagined was that of a very disciplined, very modern American girl-genius of dance: Suzanne Farrell. The evocation in every movement the ballerina makes is not of a princess who may turn into a swan or the pure line that has been held in place in a certain way for decades of tradition, but the strength of colt held in rein by the same discipline that could turn those limbs free and wild and flow into the steps and contortions of the Agon pas de deux.  How does this translate into what we are seeing on screen? In how the point touches the floor, how the head is held, how the eyes look, alertness, muscles that could spring. This does not mean that a performance of this pas-de-deux must turn to Farrell mimicry.  It means that diamonds are luxury present, not luxury past; that ""Diamonds"" looks forward, not back. Thus, Agnes Letestu with the Paris Opera Ballet.  It is a modern face. It is a modern attitude.  Classical ballet steps yes, but harking for today, for the future, an awareness where movement has come from and where it could go.  Letestu does not mimic Farrell, her performance is very much her own, her beauty is very much her own.  One knows it is a body through which has passed the music of Stravinsky, of Prokofiev, as well as say, Minkus, or Tchaikowsky. Legs that could wrap around as in Agon; arms that could split space as in Symphony in 3 Movements. Thus it is the modernity implicit in the way Balanchine interprets Tchaikowsky in this pas-de-deux, and that seems to elude the Mariinsky.  I wonder how much of it can be learned, or how much is the product of life as experienced, must the ballerina view the world in a certain way, or is it only how she was trained to execute her steps? Lopatkina executed all her steps correctly; but did she get them? Her partner, Igor Zelensky, is a marvelous dancer and a noble, elegant partner, and in the 1990's was a principal dancer with NYCB for five years. Alas, it is the woman who defines the  pas-de-deux. But stalwart support is required which Mr. Zelensky provides, and he shines when he is called upon to do so.

When it first opened at the New York State Theatre, Jewels lacked sets or even the faux proscenium it is now given. Somehow Karinska's costumes did not look as sumptuous as they now look in St. Petersburg (I think there were ""reinforcements"" from what they are in New York, particularly in Diamonds).  The Paris Opera Ballet uses costumes by Christian Lacroix, which, ironically, I find, surprisingly, given their respective careers, more ""danceable"" than Karinska's.

One of the joys of this performance is the glorious playing of the Mariinsky orchestra with the superb conducting of young Tugan Sokhiev. The sound on the blu-ray is magnificent.  There were a couple of shots or edits that were visual clunkers, a surprise since the direction was by the esteemed Brian Large. The colors are scintillating, and it is always a pleasure to see such a beautiful, ornate house where so much of performance history has taken place.

So what is the dance-lover to do?  Were you to have only one performance of Jewels, I recommend the Paris Opera Ballet version without hesitation.  Overall, it is better danced. It also has a very interesting documentary titled ""George Balanchine Forever"" which, among other things, includes a rare interview with Barbara Horgan, Balanchine's long-time assistant and chairman of the Balanchine Foundation. Second, I would get the volume of ""Choreography by Balanchine"" which has some selections from Jewels: bits of Emeralds with Merrill Ashley et al., and the Diamonds pas-de-deux with Suzanne Farrell and Peter Martins.  Note that those were primitive days for dance on TV, so much so that Mr. B. adapted some of the choreography to compensate for the limitations of the medium.  And third, I would consider purchasing this blu-ray, as whatever may have been criticized has all been within a level of excellence rare to find elsewhere.",1319414400,24,13027,4.973284200829111
4702084,3,B005HK8L0Y,"Russians just don't seem to get Balanchine; the camera man just don't seem to get ballet altogether.

  Frankly I don't remember much about Zhanna Ayupova's dancing in Emeralds. All I remember is the camera that hangs 45 degrees above her head and follows her all the way back and forth on the stage to make an ultra long shot (for her whole Violette Verdy solo). I am sure the camera man (or the filming director) must be very proud of this long shot, but that gives me a car-sick feeling to look at, not to mention to appreciate or enjoy an artist's dancing details. Daria Sukhorukova can not hold a candle to Clairemarie Osta (in POB production) in the same French role.

  Rubies tries to sell itself way too hard. Again this camera tries to over-dramatize things that it doesn't understand. Many unexpected close-ups are just to show performers' heavy make-up and their flirty eye contact. However, Mariinsky put visible effort in this act. Although it is neither witty nor innocent, there is a respectable Russian attempt of interpreting the modernity.

  And then comes the most disappointing act, Diamonds. Although the upward-from-foot-level angle camera work was used throughout the whole recording, it is most intensely applied in this act - to emphasize on the sense of spectacle I guess? However, it distorts the beautiful body shape of dancers and makes it tiresome to watch, because you get this feeling of raising your neck forever. The cast is even a bigger problem. In my opinion, Uliana Lopatkina would make a fantastic Russian Emerald, but she is the last choice for the sharp, dynamic, and athletic Diamond lead. Speed and energy is simply not her thing. Maybe Russians just believe in Lopatkina as the ""best demonstration of Russian style"", or probably just because the hierarchy of Mariinsky company believes that Emeralds is too small an exposure for such a star, she was pushed out for this role anyway. More than once she was merely struggling through the quick tempo and challenging steps. Zelensky is past his peak, and such partnership reduced his own vitality as well. Together they danced beautifully, but it's just not Diamonds. Although Agnes Letestu is not my farovite diamond girl, I certainly prefer her to Uliana Lopatkina in this part.

  Beautiful dancing from the corps, as always. Future stars such as Kondaurova are spotted, too. The leading cast is really dull. I would love to see Diana Vishneva either as Rubies (for her proper sense of modernity) or as Diamonds (for her sharp musicality, energy and faster footwork), but Mariinsky simply hides this treasure from any released production. Viktoria Tereshkina would be equally welcome, but for the fact that she probably had not made it that high on the hierarchy ladder in the year 2007. I would certainly go for the POB production if I could only have one Jewels.",1319068800,5,2860,4.910788381742739
4702085,4,B005HK8L0Y,"Hate the sets:  For me ""the sets"" include the curtains (are they real?  fake?) of the wings.  For me these ""curtains"" look terrible, and are roughly the color of vomit.  Further, I don't like the swathe of sparkles on the back wall and I don't like the quasi-realistic jewel-set hanging from the proscenium.  If you want great sets for this ballet, I give you those of the Paris Opera Ballet--in my opinion they nailed it.

Now for the dancing.  OK, I never have been a fan of ""Emeralds"" and I still am not.  Danced capably enough, with the interesting inclusion of Zhanna Ayupova (then about 40 years old) as the main soloist.  ""Rubies"":  Starts off OK, in my opinion, but I'm still in somnolent mode from ""Emeralds"".  Then enter Irina Golub and Andrian Fadeyev and WOW!, who turned on the lights?!  Talk about electricity!  She has sass and he has punch and they both ""get it"":  the angular and jazzy idiom of Balanchine-imitating-Balanchine (with a wink here and there to Agnes De Mille in ""Rodeo"").  A Russian review of the Mariinsky says that Golub is really the standout in this part and I buy that.  Fadeyev is certainly her equal.  A great joy to watch.  I do not agree with ""French Critic"" here in these reviews that the POB version on DVD is better; I think it is inferior for the most part, and that includes here in ""Rubies"" where the rounded and feminine dancing of Aurelie Dupont does not, in my opinion, begin to compare with the dancing of Golub (and I do like Dupont in most other ballets).  Golub slices up the air with her feet and shows personality to match.  Gotta be careful here not to talk too much about Golub, as Fadeyev (no longer with the company) is equally electric and deserves equal attention.  ""Diamonds"":  Here Balanchine seems to me to be saying, ""You want Petipa?  I can do Petipa better that Petipa!""  I rather see ""Jewels"" as Balachine's curriculum vitae, his resume to the world, where he shows that he can choreograph in the classic French style, the American style and the Russian style.  Again, I disagree with ""French Critic"":  Ulyana Lopatkina, with her customary pure line and coolness (as I see her), is like sculpted ice.  Igor Zelensky, ever the most noble and ardent of princes, is like scuplted fire.  Fire and ice.  Yin and Yang.  This is a magnificent revelation of what it means to be a ""diamond"".  I mean, you expect Russians to be good at dancing Petipa, no?

In no way do I consider myself an ""expert"" on Balanchine, but I do love ballet and I am capable of being communicated-with from the stage.  Perhaps the NYCB on any night will give you a more ""authentic"" performance of ""Jewels"";  nevertheless, I bet that you will stand and cheer for this one.  Filmed in HD; well-played by the Mariinsky Orchestra; I like the different camera angles and close-ups, consider them well-chosen.  I am giving it four stars, rather than five, primarily for the negativity of the sets.  And please excuse my great use here in this review of parentheses.",1318809600,13,2995,4.614800759013283
4702086,3,B005HK8L0Y,"In short: mixed feelings.

By way of background, I had the good luck to have seen the Mariinsky / Kirov perform Jewels in California in 2003.  Jewels had been a bit hard to catch in that period unless you lived in NYC, and no complete video recording existed at the time.  Hence I was ecsatic about the ballet, in which I saw a number of the same artists who perform in this new dvd (notably Ms Lopatkina and Mr Fadeyev).

Every major ballet company has its unique style, which is a wonderful thing.  But the consequence is that when a highly stylized group of dancers try to perform the work of a choreographer alien to their core repertoire, that style will show through.  And so it did in this dvd.  At times I had to ask myself, ""Who re-choreographed this work?""

Emeralds was danced in a workman-like fashion, but left me cold.  Ever since Violette Verdy threw in the towel as a repetiteur for the George Balanchine Trust, I don't think any company has really nailed this act.  Even the NYCB.

Rubies had an unexpected smoothness and flow where sharpness and discontinuity are called for.  The proverbial ear-whacking kicks were there in abundance, as another reviewer has noted, but the elements of thrill, spontaneity and edginess were lacking.

Diamonds, oddly enough, was problematic as well.  The tempo of the first section was way too fast (granted, the Tchaikovsky score can be a bit dirge-like), and the ensemble - albeit in the astounding unison for which the Mariinsky is famous - seemed rushed to keep up.  Now as to Lopatkina in the pas de deux, which I think is one of the master's masterpieces: perhaps she thought she was dancing Odette in Swan Lake, but her little affectations (e.g., the overly cute pointe work) detracted from rather than added to the beauty of the piece.  But the large ensemble at the conclusion did the performance justice, again with breathtaking precision.

A couple of secondary points: the costumes by Karinska were lovely and the decor was as delightfully lavish as I had remembered.  Technically, the dvd is not wonderful.  The performance was filmed from a number of vantage points, ranging from orchestra front and center (great) to fourth ring side (odd).  And some of the cameras (for the distant shots, of which there were far too many) seemed to have been ever so slightly out of focus, which was really bothersome.  Finally, the five-minute ""bonus feature"" of a self-promoting monologue by the perpetually unshaved Valery Gergiev added nothing of value.

But Jewels lovers (and I count myself as one) should not hesitate to add this dvd to their collection, as there is only one other recording on the market, albeit a better one (that by the Paris Opera Ballet).",1318636800,31,2719,4.777301927194861
4702087,5,B005HK8L0Y,"What an absolute joy! The dancers' beautiful glittering costumes fill the screen with red, green and white sparkling jewels. The first act `Emeralds' is soft and flowing, while the second act `Rubies' is all fun and frolics. The ballet ends in style with `Diamonds' featuring the world-wide star Lopatkina. There is something about her almost ethereal presence on stage that is truly breath-taking. This DVD is really something special indeed - the Mariinsky Ballet's unmatched technique is evident throughout without a moment of hesitation.",1318550400,6,541,5.4523809523809526

Their facial expressions are charismatic, alluring and provocative and the playing by the Mariinsky Orchestra is truly inspiring. Stylistically this DVD is impressive - the colors are bright and vivid for each of the three sections and the camera work is spot on. Even the way the DVD is presented is attractive. The dancers' technique is perfect and I urge you to buy this even if it is just to see how high they can lift their legs! It's incredible.",1318291200,8,628,4.616071428571429
8473235,4,B005HK8L0Y,"Great performance, but only somewhat watchable due to bad motion capture. In my entire large ballet collection, I only have three Blu-rays that have this problem: (1) this one; (2) the Ballet of the French Opera version of (coincidentally) the same piece; and (3) a Dutch version of Don Quijote. Anything moving is blurred!  Just great for ballet, right!? Especially in Emeralds, when the dancers move around fast, it's somewhat reminiscent of a Charlie Chaplin movie. Nonetheless, I do find myself watching this because I like the performance, especially the Diamonds. (If you watch with your eyes a little unfocused, it's not too bad!)  Although what they do of the Emeralds is amazing (especially the Scilienne - I'm not sure of the incredible soloist's name), they leave out ""La mort de Melisande"" at the end, which Balanchine seems to have (very wisely) added later to confirm the tragic gravity of the piece. Despite this unfortunate omission, this version is in general better than the French one. You really can't beat Zelensky and Lopatkina. Gergiev, a wildly uneven conductor, does a pretty good job here.",1520640000,,1115,5.054347826086956

8473241,5,B005HK8L0Y,"There are now two versions of this ballet to choose from on Blu-ray. This one recorded in 2006 although not released until 2011 and the one by the Paris Opera ballet and recorded one year earlier in 2005.

The ballet is a totally abstract creation by George Balanchine based on music by Faure, Stravinsky and Tchaikovsky. The steps danced in both versions are identical of course and are equally well performed. Both stage settings focus on the colour of the three featured jewels, my preference being for the slightly more sumptuous sets at the Mariinsky theatre. The music is equally well performed and recorded by both teams and both offer finely detailed camera work giving a nice combination of close and panoramic views. The sound in both cases offers good quality surround sound or stereo.

Although this is an abstract creation as mentioned above, it is nevertheless very traditional as regards movements and dress. It best rewards repeat viewing as some people might find the lack of narrative and drama a little dull at first. The target is actually to illustrate grace and abstract beauty as appropriate to the perceived characteristics of emeralds, rubies and diamonds. The music moves from gentle Faure to spikier but accessible Stravinsky and concluding with typical Tchaikovsky but un-typically using the conclusion of his less well-known 3rd symphony.

So which to buy? In this case there is no clear winner in my view and choice could well be based simply on price. I personally would wish to own both as the choices of camera angles and use of close-up and panoramic views vary throughout, sometimes favouring the Paris production and sometimes the Russians. I have not been able to pick up on the blurred faster movements of the Russians commented on by one reviewer, even checking carefully.

Prospective purchasers would be safe with either version but my slight preference would be for this one. In my opinion both are worth the full 5 stars.",1343520000,,1964,4.96048632218845
8473242,3,B005HK8L0Y,"The problem with only having one  available recording of a ballet for a long time before another becomes available is that the first inevitably colours one's impressions of succeeding recordings,  particularly the case in contemporary storyless ballets whose choreography was created recently enough so as not to have been tampered with too much.  Balanchine of course was famous for modifying or recreating choreography many of his own ballets to suit the talents, accommodate the limitations and highlight unique attributes of individual dancers.  NYCB ballerina Merrill Ashley described Balanchine's impromptu re-choreographing like pulling change out of his front pocket.

So it is that the Mariinsky recording of their Jewels stands in striking relief to the POB's and the comparisons to the former are not always favorable.

First there's the matter of the zany,  wacky, fish-eye camera work that is a tremendous distraction and in no way flatters any of the dancers.  Second, the Karinska tutus in Diamonds are a blight on any audience, and remain unassailable proof that since its founding, no one in NYCB's wardrobe department has ever figured out how to cut a tutu.  There was certainly no reason for the Mariinsky to have carried  them over wholesale.  On this score, the glistening Christian Lacroix tutus in POB's Diamonds win by a mile.

I had always loved Zhanna Ayupova's dancing so I was a little disappointed that her Violette Verdy solo came off a little flat, highlighting the inflexible and turgid pointe work that seems to be the hallmark of the Mariinski and the Bolshoi.  And surprisingly, Ayupova also missed the ravishing arms and ecstatic , swooning back ends on the diagonal  that Laetitia Pujols brought  to the solo.  The Mimi Paul solo on the other hand came off much more beautifully, highlighting as it does the Mariinski's energetic, full, connected and palpable use of the back, head and arms.  How is it that the Vaganova method breeds into all who train by it, a pulsing, preternatural coordination  that makes the dancers come vibrantly alive even when they're doing nothing more than standing still?  In the Mimi Paul solo, I much, much preferred the dark-haired and mysteriously beautiful Daria Sukhurokova  over the. POB's Claire Marie Osta.

Is it just me, in all my years of ballet training and watching in America, I've come to take for granted the fleet, crisp and punctilious footwork inculcated by Balanchine?  Neither the POB or Maryinsky capture it completely, but the POB comes closest.  Indeed almost uniformly, the ballerina feet of the POB can be likened to baguette jewels, drawing the eye's attention to them by their quicksilver beauty and strength.

 I agree with another reviewer's assessment where they wondered whether Lopatkina was making another Odette out of the czarina-princess ballerina role in Diamonds.  I suppose I could go along with Lopatkina's take on the role, provided she understood that Balanchine/Farrell shaped it as a Space Age Odette written in greased lightning.  Instead Lopatkina ""Russianizes"" it, giving it a ponderous and overstudied reading.  She misses some Farrellisms too, like the open and voluptuous sweep of the thighs in developpes and grands battements., and the barely restrained throwing back of the head and arms.  Agnes Letestu's is overall, a more satisfying reading, with her closer approximation to the speed and great amplitude that Balanchine's choreography demands.  For all of Lopatkina's formidable technique, vast experience and knowing manner, I miss most of all in her dancing, that most critical element of Balanchine choreography - daring.

I loved Irina Golub in  Rubies,  much preferring her cheeky, sassy dancing to the glamourpuss Ava Gardner approach that the POB's Aurelie Dupont takes. Rubies remains energetic from start to finish,  and turns electrifying whenever Golub takes the stage.  While Dupont evinces an old world Hollywood movie diva glamour, Golub instead gives us today's flirty, brash,  insolent hip hop party girl.  Edgy, frisky and in total control at all times,  it's evident that Golub paid attention to all the stylistic coaching points that were given her and the added a spiciness of her own.

During the bows, I couldn't help but notice the big, dark doll-like eyes of Eugenia Obratsova, in the corps de ballet during  this performance.  One wonders tantalizingly, what she would have made of the lead Rubies ballerina role.  Sofia  Gumerova gave a perfectly adequate performance as the Tall Girl, but I missed the Gallic imperiousness and wit of Marie Agnes Gillot.

Lastly, some have registered objections to the Boy in the Emeralds trio.  I happen to think that both his dancing and his looks are very easy on the eyes.",1339632000,5,4762,5.18348623853211
8473243,5,B005HK8L0Y,"Regionalism in dance is certainly alive and well. For the past several weeks I've been playing a section of Jewels from the Paris Opera Ballet and then the same from this Marinsky disc. In past years I've seen both institutions several times as well as Jewels in the NYCB productions with Suzanne, Patricia and Edward. So I feel some familiarity with this work and having watched it ""grow up"" so to speak. Both ballet companies are a pleasure to watch. Both companies have excellent musicians in their orchestras and their corps are fine. I think overall the balerinas are prettier and the male leads handsomer in the POB than in the Marinsky. But both companies are a great pleasure to watch. In general I think the Paris is a less formal, more loose and free in style of dancing whereas the Marinsky is more rigid and accurate of movement, more formal, yea traditionally steeped in history. And yes I really prefer that kind of ballet. I had expected that the Paris would have had an extra spark in the Faure' but I found the footwork too loose and slightly better done by the Marinsky. I have really grown to love this section and wish the coda that Balanchine had added would have been executed also. The Rubies section is not really my cup of tea. I love the Stravinsky of Petrushka, Fire Bird and Rite of Spring ( I saw all three on one program with the Harkness one evening WOW). But this Capriccio is too jazzy for my taste. I thought it well done but the Paris company has a looser style. The pair Fadeyev and Golub were smashing however. Whenever I watch them I want to stand and cheer at the end!
For me Diamonds is the reason for being of this ballet. I love classic ballet; Petipa, Ivanov, Swan Lake, Sleeping Beauty, Nutcracker, Giselle, La Sylphide etc. etc. Thus the beauty and elegance of Diamonds is my nourishment. And beautiful it is. Lopatkina and Zelensky were heaven to watch. She of the long arms who could have them move as if they were fluid, in the way I saw Fonteyn do in 1952. The ballerinas that open this work were breathtaking. The whole piece is pure beauty and joy. The Diamonds section is the jewel of the show for me.
I  will cherish both discs and play them often, I may even change my mind, but as of now I lay the laurel at the feet of the Marinsky.",1334275200,6,2288,4.421800947867299
