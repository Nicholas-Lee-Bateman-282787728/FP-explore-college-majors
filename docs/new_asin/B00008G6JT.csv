7982486,5,B00008G6JT,"If you don't know who Roy Book Binder is, you're not alone. He is one of many unsung country blues performers. I hadn't heard of Roy until I bought this wonderful DVD several years ago. Since then I've seen him in concert twice...well worth it if you ever get the chance. If you love the country blues and have a sense of humor, you'll love this DVD. It remains as one of my favorites among dozens that I own. His song ""She did you a favor"" is one I regularly perform at gigs and open mics. There's something here for players of all levels, although you'll benefit much more if you're already experienced with fingerstyle guitar and open tunings.",1417392000,3,646,4.436974789915967
7982487,5,B00008G6JT,"excellent source for blues pickers....if you play guitar and want to play the blues, spend a few hours with Roy...you will come away highly entertained and with a few more chops in your bag.",1368835200,,190,4.617647058823529
7982488,4,B00008G6JT,"This might be the best place for someone to start learning how to play a blues, rag style in the open tunings. There is nothing too difficult here and a lot of what is here doesn't even require a slide. I really got this to learn the Jimmy Murphy song that Book plays -- ""Electricity."" It's really not very difficult, and I picked it up in short order and have also learned some other tunes and the fundamental moves in both open G and open D.

I'd always been a standard tuning player, but ever since I've gotten a digital clip-on tuner, I've been more willing to experiment with other tunings. For a finger-picker that wants to do add some open tuned songs, this is a good place to start. If you want something more slide-oriented and advanced or to sound like Muddy Waters, I'd recommend something by Bob Brozman.",1312761600,5,816,4.44
