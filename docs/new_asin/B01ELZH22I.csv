7738674,5,B01ELZH22I,"This is a great documentary on so many levels - and I watch a lot of documentaries. Firstly, it raises awareness of the very real issue of PostPartum Depression, which still has so much stigma and shame associated with it. Secondly, the cinematography and editing is unique and visually engaging. Thirdly, the honest and open-hearted sharing of the two filmmakers' own experience with PPD is artfully interwoven other women's stories with interviews and also with tragic headlines of women who didn't make it.  Interviews with grassroots groups and women who bravely share their experiences is artfully compiled to make an engaging movie about a topic that otherwise could be hard to talk about.  While it explores a most important and urgent topic and gets crucial information out there, it is just the tip of the iceberg.  This documentary will save lives just by the simple fact it puts information out there that is hard to find. Every woman, man, physician, therapist, yoga teacher, antenatal instructors, everyone who knows anyone who is expecting a baby needs this information so that our communities can begin to support moms who are struggling with PPD. There are so many questions that still need answers (by the medical community, insurance companies and policy makers). The filmmakers could make several sequels...and I hope they will.",1475884800,2,1347,5.141552511415525

7738676,5,B01ELZH22I,"Very excellent documentary on the reality of what in the past has been called Postpartum Depression!  Now it is known as PMADs (Perinatal Mood & Anxiety Disorders).
This documentary notes that 15-20% of new mothers will have a PMAD & that it is the #1 pregnancy/postpartum complication.
**Do be aware, that there are many triggers in this documentary if you or someone you know has lived/is living through a PMAD.**",1475193600,2,415,4.928571428571429

8759137,5,B01ELZH22I,"Thank you.
Thank you to all the people who made this film a reality. I too had Postpartum Depression, and I too reached out to my OBGYN and I too was ignored. Now I am in school so that I can help bridge the gap. EVERY expecting Mom, Dad - family - should watch this so that they can be informed and prepared. Another film that raises awareness is ""When the Bough Breaks"". It's free on Netflix.",1497916800,,394,4.12987012987013
8759138,5,B01ELZH22I,"This was extremely informative!  The healthcare system is failing these women and their families. Doctors need more training to best care for their patients.  There needs to be more public awareness and understanding of this sickness.  Mothers who are suffering through Post Partum Depression or Anxiety need to be aware of what it is, given resources on where to go for help.  There should also be more education available for family members in what to do to help their loved one.",1486166400,2,481,4.901234567901234

8759140,5,B01ELZH22I,"A fabulous film about a subject rarely discussed. I wish this film had been around in 1998 when I couldn't figure out why I wasn't feeling the joy other mothers in playgroups expressed. Now, as a pediatric/ maternal health nurse I make it a point to ask women about their feelings and encourage them to share without guilt. I am glad there are resources in this film that I can encourage them to go to.",1483315200,2,402,4.373333333333333
