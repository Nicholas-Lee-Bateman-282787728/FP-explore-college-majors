7855638,1,6303918956,Not good episodes on this one don't waste your money - I wish I hadn't.,1413244800,,71,3.8
7855639,3,6303918956,"The video arrived quickly and in good shape.
 We were a little disappointed with the video.  It was not as funny as Red's other videos; not as much duck tape humor.",1258329600,,164,4.258064516129032
7855640,5,6303918956,"I bought this tape as a gift, and have not yet viewed it. I have seen the Red Green show for years, though, and I know it is funny stuff. My dad loves the show, and will enjoy this birthday gift.",1234051200,,195,3.7804878048780486
7855641,2,6303918956,"I didn't feel this VHS tape is the best of Red Green.  Whomever picked out the scenes, did not do a very good job.  Though the tape was made in 1995, there were many more shows after that.  They need to make a tape called ""The Best of the Best of Red Green"" and look through ALL his shows.  This tape is a disappointment.  I have seen much better scenes than the majority of the ones picked out for this tape.",1200787200,,409,4.0
7855642,4,6303918956,"Wacky Red Green is the leader of a great

bunch of canadian underacheivers known

as 'Possum Lodge' [without the 'O', @

the beginning of the word]. Green, his

nephew Harold and Co. are slackers of

the most imaginative sort. Building

Boats out of old vans, turning K cars

into sleds, et, al. The first very fine

VHS tape of the many to come. Pick Up On

It!",1143417600,,362,4.2835820895522385
7855643,5,6303918956,Any tool is the right tool.  Its very funny !,1059868800,,45,3.5
7855644,5,6303918956,"Sadly, many areas of our great land have a terrible lack.  Their local PBS station does not carry Red Green.
Those of us that are fortunate enough to know and love the sophisticated humor and philosophy of Possum Lodge must help to fill this gap, along with maintaining our own copies of this treasure to help enlighten our children.
This is a wonderful collection of many of Red Green's best bits.  There is enough background that people who have never heard of Red Green will be able to follow and enjoy the humor, hopefully then marching en masse to their local PBS station to demand more.",1029283200,5,592,4.5754716981132075
7855645,5,6303918956,"My introduction to Red Green was an error in changing the channel on my TV.  I could not believe what I watching and out of how hard Red was trying to be funny, I laughed.  Since that first show I have been a regular watcher.  This video is great and fun to watch Red at work.  The laughter comes easily over the nonsense of the collection.  It is nice to watch a show that takes no deep thinking and is pure entertainment.  This video has an extra introduction and history of the show, it's actors, and characters at the end. If you are already a fan of Red's get set to see some of your favorite parts.",1008288000,7,604,4.119658119658119
