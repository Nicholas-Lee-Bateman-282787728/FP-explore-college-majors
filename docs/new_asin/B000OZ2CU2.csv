2806409,4,B000OZ2CU2,"Tenchi in Tokyo is the 3rd Tenchi Muyo series. While the original and Universe are nearly beloved by all, Tokyo always gets a mixed reaction at best. That does not mean that Tokyo is a bad series. I personally found the series to be quite good.

This was the 2nd reboot of the franchise, since it worked with Universe, the creators decided to do it again. So to begin yes, it is not a sequel to either of the earlier series. It's still the same deal, Tenchi and the wild ladies have more wacky adventures.

 The story this time focuses on Tenchi going to Tokyo more a few reasons. Grandpa tells Tenchi that he must work at a shrine in Tokyo for his friend. Tenchi agrees but mostly for the fact it gets him away from the girls. The girls hate this of course, so in their desperation, they have Washu build a portal to take them to Tenchi's pad in Tokyo. Along the way Tenchi meets a new girl named Sakuya, who like the rest of the girls, falls for Tenchi. This leads to the girls finding out about Sakuya and then the fireworks start. Add an enigmatic girl named Yukie, and thus sets the story of Tokyo in motion.

The cast from the dub return as they once again knock it out of the park. It's your call which way you want to watch them but both are still top-notch.

There are some new twists to Tokyo. First of all at the beginning, Tenchi has already met the girls. You do not find out how Tenchi met them all until about halfway through the series. The story is also more moody and depressing than the earlier entries.

The most obvious new feature is the new animation style. It was done to help with the comedy scenes because the original style was felt to be too restrictive emotion wise. So they went with a new style to make it more funny. Did it work? Not really as they went back the original style after this for the first Universe movie, though they did the animation for Tenchi Forever in this style though.

The story also gets heat for Sakuya. She is not a bad character, but the fact she just entered the show and went right after Tenchi really riled up fans. Do not worry as the story resolves this in a rather unpredictable way.

Tokyo was the last full Tenchi series to arrive for Toonami. Afterwards the creators went back to making the Tenchi movies, and then the frachise went on hiatus for a few years. They returned to finish the original series with the 3rd Ryo-Ohki OVA....the less said about that the better.

Tenchi in Tokyo gets a bad rep, but when the first two entries were the peak of the harem genre then the criticism is at least valid. Some of the new characters are annoying or just plain boring. The music is also weaker compared to the previous series.

Is Tokyo the best Tenchi anime? No
Is Tokyo worth watching? Yes

Pros:The old characters are still a blast to watch.
The darker turn really helps the story.

Cons: The animation is just not as good as the original entries in my opinion.
The new characters are,for the most part, just bland and boring.

Overall: It's weaker than the original series and Universe, but it's still a worthwhile entry in the franchise. I'd say give Tenchi in Tokyo at least a watch, then decide whether it is for you.",1350259200,,3189,4.357504215851602
2806410,5,B000OZ2CU2,In Tokyo had its ups and downs but was still a great show and I can't wait to add it to my collection.,1347667200,,102,3.4782608695652173
2806411,5,B000OZ2CU2,Really entertaining... not as good as Tenchi Universe but this is still an entertaining show... pick up the set. 8 discs bruh,1301529600,,125,4.7272727272727275
2806412,5,B000OZ2CU2,"I've been waited so long to buy this BOX. I'm pretty satisfied about it.
Product arrived very fast and in perfect state.",1284336000,,120,4.5
2806413,5,B000OZ2CU2,"If you are a fan of the series I strongly suggest purchasing this well priced product.  This Tenchi series explores the gang and their seperation with Tenchi as he goes to Tokyo to train as a priest.  This series is one of my favorite not for the animation or hilarity, and the comedy is rather good in this installment,  but rather that this series shows Tenchi making a choice with his love life and the ramifications of that choice.  This series does come with its problems like low production animation in some episodes and bad translations in some parts if you watch the japanese audio, but this series never stops from being both charming and interesting.  The characters are cared for and it shows in this series.  The sense of family is this series greatest triumph.  So if you are a fan of the series I would strongly suggest this and if you are not, though I still suggest watching it, it would be best to start with the OVA's first to better get a handle on the series and what it's about.  It is better to watch the series knowing how hard it is for Tenchi to make a choice with all these women and then to watch him make a choice in this series.",1268352000,14,1158,4.328703703703703
2806414,5,B000OZ2CU2,"This finally completes my Tenchi collections.  I like the tie together in the end of the series very much.  Of course, like other Tenchis the story seems to reset itself while keeping the same characters for the most part.  Anyway, I'm glad to have all the Tenchi sets xD.",1245110400,7,272,4.510204081632653
2806415,5,B000OZ2CU2,"This is not the second or the last, its the third. Apparently the other people haven't watched all of them. I really enjoyed this series it's not the same but i think that was a good thing watching the same storyline over and over would just get old i think the first 3 series (Tenchi muyo, Tenchi universe, and Tenchi in tokyo) are all worth buying tho im not sure about GXP they seemed to go way out there replacing characters.",1230076800,9,429,4.308641975308642
2806416,5,B000OZ2CU2,"This is the second version of Tenchi Muyo TV series. Different from the original OVA collections and the first TV version, this anime seems like a face lift. By using the theme and background of the characters of the original OVA collections, a new type of production in introducing Tenchi Muyo anime can be seen. It is more funny. There is a little change in each of the characters as well. The strong point is you can have a new experience in viewing Tenchi Muyo. Tenchi Muyo series has been exisiting for a very long period; from the original OVA collections, the first TV series and movies, no one is not familiar with this anime. If identical theme, stories etc continue, it might have become tasteless and clumsy. This anime is worth of viewing.",1216425600,,751,4.611940298507463

2806418,4,B000OZ2CU2,I got this set knowing that everyone said it suck really bad so i wasent exspecting much so a watched it its pretty good its pretty funny its not like the other tenchi's but its a pretty good series adn if your a hardcore tenchi i would get it,1188259200,,243,3.979591836734694
2806429,5,B000OZ2CU2,Factory sealed as posted. I totally forgot how much I liked this show when it aired on Toonami. If you want a cotton candy kind of dating comedy this one is a really cute story.,1432598400,,177,4.085714285714285

2806433,5,B000OZ2CU2,"For those that are wondering, this is a separate series altogether from what is classically considered Tenchi Muyo, which was shown on Cartoon Network's Toonami programming block.
This series involves Tenchi moving to Tokyo to apprentice at a shrine there. Lots of hijinks ensue when Ayeka and Ryoko get Washuu to create a portal that pops them LITERALLY into Tenchi's bed. While the series doesn't focus solely on Tenchi during his stay in Tokyo, there is plenty to keep you interested in the series. Though a few episodes do seem slightly out of place, all in all, a good series for fans of Tenchi.",1415750400,,600,4.778846153846154

My biggest qualm is the subtitles. Hearing impaired here and the subtitles DO NOT MATCH UP. Typical anime translation problem.",1406160000,,225,4.232558139534884
2806438,5,B000OZ2CU2,This is perhaps one of the best Tenchi Muyo series ever! The storyline is good and the characters are all familiar as well. If you are a sci-fi fantasy fan this series is for you!,1403481600,,179,4.142857142857143
2806439,5,B000OZ2CU2,Really nice to see this again. I used to watch Tenchi Muyo on Cartoon Network during its first run and I'm glad to see it hasn't lost any of its charm. Really entertaining. Definitely worth a look.,1400371200,,197,4.351351351351352

2806441,5,B000OZ2CU2,"I grew up watching this anime. There was a lot of spin offs to the Tenchi Muyo franchise. Most people dislike this one, I however really enjoyed it. It has a more serious feel to the show and there was just something about it that I loved. This show had a near cult following in mid '90 to early '00 many years later and i still enjoy it.",1386806400,,338,3.985294117647059

2806443,3,B000OZ2CU2,"The Tenchi world is practacly destroyed in my opinion. This is a total side story that has little to do with the world of Tenchi that I like, and the took tenchi's cluelessness to all new levels in the alternate universe. I really wanted to see the story prgress, instead I got an offshoot, and the storyline is unaffected. Oh well, since it's Tenchi I'll give three, though I'd rather give two. If you want everything Tenchi like me get it. If you are looking for a good show, it is good enough, but if you want to see development in the Tenchi storyline you will be disapointed.",1382400000,,580,4.37962962962963

2806445,5,B000OZ2CU2,but the storyline could had been better. I still recommend this anime to any Tenchi fan! Great for collectors and people that like Tenchi serious.,1379203200,,146,4.88

2806447,2,B000OZ2CU2,I should've saved my money and searched youtube for the episodes.  It was a letdown after Ryo-Ohki (my introduction to Tenchi) and War on Geminar.,1377216000,,146,4.84
2806448,5,B000OZ2CU2,"Well, its not the strongest in the tenchi franchise but it is still good. Only watched it once on toonami and will watch it again. The dvd was perfect and the shipping speed was good. I greatly enjoyed the product. Thanks! I'm glad I bought it from this seller!",1372636800,,261,4.346938775510204
2806449,5,B000OZ2CU2,I seen this series long  time  ago. It is the way I remeber the story.  The story and the artwork is is bite out date. It has a good story.,1371081600,,139,3.566666666666667
2806450,5,B000OZ2CU2,"Don't really see much of Tokyo and you don't really see Tenchi doing much for the reason being in Tokyo.  However, he does surround himself with new people.  As his old clique gets drawn away mysteriously.  But friendship bonds are stronger than anything.  This is a different timeline of Tenchi Universe and Tenchi OVA series.  Each one of them just fell into Tenchi all at once versus the original.  Also, Rhyo ohki isn't the terror of the skies, but is the pet of Sasami.  Sasami plays a bigger role in this version.  The original gang is back together though and the history of each is not enlightened throughout the series.  It was a pretty devious plot that unfolds and it gets tricky the last 3 episodes to piece everything together.  Tenchi is more of a priest in training and discovers he's a planet guardian and battles against a very powerful and scheming foe.

A good adventure series.",1366243200,2,897,4.649681528662421
2806451,4,B000OZ2CU2,"As an avid fan of everything Tenchi, I had to have it.  In the ""Tenchiverse"" it is ""closer in proximity"" to the original Tenchi Muyo! OVA series than Tenchi Universe.  That said, the gang's all here! Much to Tenchi's dismay of course. As the title says, he is off in Tokyo--and the girls are NOT happy about it. They are especially displeased that he gets a girlfriend! Even though anyone familiar with the misadventures of Tenchi can easily imagine what happens when they find out, I recommend finding out anyway.",1362787200,,514,4.7
2806452,3,B000OZ2CU2,"I think this is the weakest of the main Tenchi series. In this series the cast does act more like a harem, in the other series it's more like a love triangle.

The plot takes to long to get interesting, but the last few episodes are really good, although the ending felt forced to me.  And their are a few episodes that are pointless. They serve no purpose and do not move the story along in any way, and can be somewhat boring. The main antagonist is also one of the most boring I have seen in a show.

If you've never watched a Tenchi series I recommend you start elsewhere.",1362009600,,576,4.171171171171171

It was nice that they re-released this title, when I looked for it earlier this year I could not believe what they were asking for it.

This completes my collection with Tenchi.

Thank You.",1359936000,,264,4.26
2806455,5,B000OZ2CU2,This is a four dvd set. I love Tenchi in Tokyo. It's a good series. While not as good as Muyo or Universe it still has it's own charm. And Hotsuma is so fine. I hate Sakuya though. And the animation could of been better. Overall I'm happy with it.,1358640000,,247,3.96
2806456,2,B000OZ2CU2,"Relying too much on slap and tickle funny instead of the classic formula set up in the original series', Tenchi in Tokyo sadly does everything in a strange and off-the-wall direction that may work for some but with characters that seem hell-bent on destroying Tenchi for no reason at all, to a character that up and announces her love for him to poorly-timed comedy bits that just seem downright irritating instead of funny, this series was either done without any thought of the intended audience or just to hopefully kill time until the third OVA series could be finished but whatever the reason, this Second TV series just doesn't hit the mark like it should have.

The animation makes the girls look almost triangular at times and not at all the rounded, more realistic way they had in the original OAV or in Tenchi Universe and even the music chosen seems like an odd choice from the odd tempo opening to the almost country-style, ""Yawaranai Yawaranai"" at the end credits.  Even Kagome was annoying and I LOVED her character in Universe!  Bad character designs, bad musical choices, and bizarre fight scenes make this VERY questionable as to where the creators' minds were at when they made this series.  A very strange and poor choice for those who love everything Tenchi Muyo... Watch it on Funimation Channel BEFORE buying it.",1358035200,2,1334,4.812227074235808
2806457,5,B000OZ2CU2,when Tenchi muyo first aired i was hooked and although i never got into this verison these dvds are good to get back into a episode.,1357689600,,132,4.115384615384615
2806458,4,B000OZ2CU2,"Tenchi in Tokyo is another good Tenchi series, but it's different from the others. In this series Tenchi leaves the girls. He goes to Tokyo train for the priesthood and go to high school. With the girls back home and a new girl on his mind. Tenchi's future is uncertain. Especially with an evil demon from the past gunning for his powers.

I like this Tenchi series, but it has a totally different atmosphere. The voice acting style and animation are not like the other entries. Although there are some fundamental differences, the new plot line and characters make up for what may have been lost. It is definitely emotional at times and it has plenty of action & comedy. So this anime shouldn't disappoint. Give it chance, you'll probably like it.",1350691200,4,748,4.666666666666667
