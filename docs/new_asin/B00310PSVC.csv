4048002,4,B00310PSVC,I gave this as a gift in which the I was told it had some good movies. Not really more I can say but that it arrived in great condition and was priced so low. Good gift to give to someone who likes to build movie collections.,1305676800,,225,3.8085106382978724
4048003,3,B00310PSVC,THE DVD ARRIVED IN TIME...ONLY FOUR OF THE MOVIES WORKED...SOME WOULD FREEZE AND THE OTHERS WOULDN'T PLAY AT ALL...WHAT DID PLAY WAS GREAT..I WILL BE HESITANT BUYING  A MULTIPLE MOVIE PACK,1299542400,2,188,5.064516129032258
4048004,1,B00310PSVC,"Having just seen these disks, I am amused at the reviewers (employees of the company??) who laud its value...you know like 12 movies for 'x' amount.  Well, garbage in garbage out.  I was so irritated by the poor quality that I write this at 2:10am, eschewing sleep to warn others. If you thought that this would be a collection of the sexy, saucy, drive-in movies, well it might be.  However, I guess our standards were much lower then because most of this was so mild it could be broadcast on any channel these days.
This is a collection of crap that they swept up off the film library floor.  There might have been one 'titillating scene' and -0- humorous or dramatic ones.  The quality of everything was poor; these weren't B films but F,G, or Z films.  The production cost of the films, after they picked them up at the Kodak booth at Walgreen's, must have been at least $600, including the camera rental.
People forget that the old funny, 'camp' films were intended as such...i.e. comedies.  Batman, Ed Wood...noone thought they were dramas even at the time. Instead of buying this 'value' pack, save shipping and just take the money from your wallet and place it gingerly in the trash...",1297209600,13,1193,4.625592417061611
4048005,3,B00310PSVC,"12 movies. i was expecting expoitation for the most part. but was rather pleased for about half of these were rather good, some almost of a decent dramatic dramatic quality. as with most films, it is a matter of taste, what one likes another hates. for me, i would buy this again and feel that i got my money in value with even only half being good, a couple were even pretty darn good. jane mansfield put in a very credible performance, not one you would have thought was in her. a reference was made to her death, i googled and found she died in a lousianna car accident...sad, she may have well been a rather nice person different from the bimbo creation often shown.",1296518400,3,670,4.368
4048006,5,B00310PSVC,"I was drawn in by the lovely picture of Jayne Mansfield on the cover, however having bought Single Room Furnished in the Drive-In Cult Collection Vol. 3 I had cold feet about purchasing this. I figured oh here we go it will be just another cheapo production company releasing badly transfered public domain films like Alpha Video. However I must say as a lover of bad 70's exploitation films some of these are a  real treat, all of the films are copyrighted and belong to Crown International. Does that make them good for a standard movie goer.... No, but many of these films aren't lacking in charm for the unconventional movie goer such as myself. While most of these women don't necessarily live up to the Bombshell's promised there are some generally good cult films here. My personal fav was The Hustler Squad. Police Woman isn't bad either, Superchick is fun also for a swinger film from the early 70's. All in all if ya like cheesy films, campy actresses, and of course gratuitous nudity then pick up this cheap comp.

Now the transfers are not very good, but get the job done I mean it's not as bad as some of the stuff Alpha Video has put out. I only assume the original transfers of these films were bad enough as was. Packaging is cheap also, they come in small black slips, no disc art, and double sided. You do get your monies worth for the small sum of five dollars.",1294617600,9,1380,4.472222222222222
4048007,4,B00310PSVC,I`ve had trouble with Mill Creek in the past with some of the movies not coming up for play and with very poor picture quality.  These are all in color with acceptable picture quality from Crown International Pictures.  A lot for the money ($5.00 at Kmart).,1281312000,5,257,4.565217391304348
4048008,5,B00310PSVC,"I just received this set, and have only watched Superchick and Galaxina, both prints or transfers I'd give 4/5, Superchick, was about the style and kind of movie I was expecting from this set, but Galaxina such a rare treat, to have a good print of this film in my collection I feel so rich. I doubt any exceptional or unexceptional B sci-fi like this will ever go to blu ray, and will probably go out of print in the next few years. This is easily one of if not the best cheesy B scifi flicks ever, get this set!!!
I've watched a few more of the movies now, and I am happy to report Mill Creek has finally stepped up their game all the transfers are good to very good, and complete, not like their previous bargain sets poor transfers, cuts, and sound drops, also there are no annoying logos in the corner of the films :)) I'm very pleased with this set, Hustler Squad was a great flick too, nice price, great deal.",1279756800,40,916,4.24
4048009,4,B00310PSVC,"But mostly good news.

However, being that the very first 'reviewer' on the scene chose to post information better suited to the discussion section (at the bottom of the product listing) into the REVIEW section instead (for which it clearly doesn't qualify), you should consider this the first legitimate review of this product.

I'm not going to bother reviewing the content of the films in this set as I've already reviewed some of them, as have many others, when they appeared in earlier, similar sets from BCI/Eclipse. Reviews are plentiful for every single title in this set, and Mill Creek's various new multi-movie collections are essentially repackagings of the Crown International Pictures library they inherited from BCI. As such, there are some VERY enjoyable pictures in this set.

But this is just a basic overview of the presentation of each film within the set.

The good news is, you get EIGHT of the twelve films presented widescreen.

The bad news is, you get FOUR of the twelve films presented fullscreen.

ALL the films appear to be uncut. Boobies ahoy, matey!

Here's the basics:

WIDESCREEN PRESENTATIONS with TRUE run times:
SINGLE ROOM FURNISHED - 1:38:16
CINDY AND DONNA - 1:19:56
LAS VEGAS LADY - 1:26:56
LENA'S HOLIDAY - 1:37:20
GALAXINA - 1:34:48
PICK-UP - 1:17:19
THE STEPMOTHER - 1:34:26
SISTER IN LAW - 1:20:14

FULLSCREEN PRESENTATIONS (boooo, Mill Creek, boooo) with ACTUAL run times
POLICE WOMEN - 1:39:46
SUPERCHICK - 1:33:47
HUSTLER SQUAD - 1:38:18
CHAIN GANG WOMEN - 1:25:22

Notes about the full screen versions: Both POLICE WOMEN and SUPERCHICK were previously released in widescreen versions, POLICEWOMEN in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Welcome-to-the-Grindhouse-Las-Vegas-Lady-Policewomen/dp/B000WC38Q4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Welcome to the Grindhouse (Las Vegas Lady / Policewomen)</a>&nbsp;and SUPERCHICK in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Welcome-to-the-Grindhouse-Superchick-Hustler-Squad/dp/B000WC38QE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Welcome to the Grindhouse (Superchick / Hustler Squad)</a>. Here, POLICEWOMEN has it's title reduced to ""POLICEWOME"" in the opening credits. Not cool. To the best of my knowledge, HUSTLER SQUAD and CHAIN GANG WOMEN have never been released in widescreen versions. The fullscreen editions included here seem to be identical to previous releases from BCI - grainy, dirt-specked and somewhat the worse for wear.

Notes about the run times included here: these are OFFICIAL, based on timer readings from an actual DVD player, not parroted from a press release a la the first ""review"" posted for this set. (it should be beyond obvious now that the run times he posted, as provide by Mill Creek, are incorrect). These films appear to be complete and unedited based on my having seen every single one of them, sometimes more than once, via previous sets from BCI and Rhino. There are no run times printed on the back of the Mill Creek set. Mr. Hill admittedly got his information direct from Mill Creek's press release, but clearly the company didn't check the run times of its own product. Such information should ONLY come from the discs themselves, as it now has.

This collection is comprised of three discs, two films per side, with chapter listings. No trailers or other extras.",1277683200,123,3345,5.668
