2656894,4,B000IHYXIK,"I've watched just a few episodes so far and found them to be as entertaining as the other sets in the series. The color and image quality seems to be near perfect, the sound even better (the only picture scratchiness I think I've seen so far is when the producers spliced in a bit of genuine WWII footage, that can sometimes be very scratchy).

I do have a complaint, about CBS, the first three sets had several extras (2nd season was really good) fourth and fifth seasons have nothing, not even a listing thanking surviving cast members. All Fifth season has is different colors for each disc (didn't even bother to put cast pictures on them- Fourth did do that)and a promo for several other CBS DVD sets.

I hope the sixth and final season has a lot better than that!",1167264000,7,769,4.446808510638298

2656919,5,B000IHYXIK,"One of my favorite characters on Hogan's Heroes was ""Kinch,"" Sgt. James Kinchloe.  He was wonderfully played by Ivan Dixon for the first five years of Hogan's Heroes run.  This series, the Fifth (1969/70) was the year Dixon took a bow and departed the series.  I was saddened.  Alas, this wasn't called Kinchloe's Heroes or it would have ended the entire cast at this point.

Bob Crane reprises his role as Colonel Robert Hogan, USAAF.  Many people have trash-talked Crane over the years.  His personal life was one thing, his career on the screen, another.  I enjoyed him as Hogan.  He was charming, funny and, like the RCMP, always got his man.  We know life in the Stalag wasn't as cushy as Stalag 13 was portrayed.  This is television comedy not dramatic documentary.  Hogan's Heroes added a bit of laughter to a nation at odds with itself.  Our nation was involved in Southeast Asia - Vietnam, specifically, and comedies had a way of taking the edge off the drama played out there and within our borders as well.

We need more programs like Hogan's Heroes.  These programs allow funny things to happy and gives us a chance to laugh at ourselves as well.  The world is already far too serious.",1473292800,,1197,4.628571428571429

  Now, we own the whole series and my husband and I watch an episode every night. We're on our second time through. Most of the storylines follow the same formula, some humanly impossible assignment, and everything turns out okay in the end. Nobody dies, at least not on camera, so they're involved in a good, clean war. It's the characters who make the show so compelling to watch. The heroes are a talented group and they all, except Kinchloe, seem like natural comedians. Even Hogan, although his humor is more dry than the other POWs. I enjoy the subtle touches, like Lebeau's side comments in French. When I can understand them (high school French was a long time ago), they are hilarious. My favorite character is Schultz. He steals every scene he's in. Love that man. My least favorite is Klink. He could use the same script for every show. And he's the only one who received an Emmy award for it.

Episode 1 year 5 - Hogan directs a propaganda film!!! Just too much of a stretch. The previous years were more realistic so you could believe in the comedy. It's almost like the POWS had free run of the camp whereas in previous years they had to work more and finagle more to achieve their schemes. To me the main comedy potential of HH is how the POWS improvise and negotiate to improve their conditions; even the smallest conditions. Year 5 it is almost as though they have as much power as the Nazis.

I have not seen year 4 and hoping it is better. Borders only had year 5 so that is why I bought it. Years 1-3 are priceless of course. Now I understand why it was canceled after 6 years. Sad but I am a huge HH fan.

Come on folks!  If you're an honest fan of HH, you've got to admit that the quality of the writing is noticeably deteriorating by this point in the series and that much of the cast (usually the Heroes) seem to frequently be 'mailing it in'.

Seasons 1-3 were Hogan's best, but there are still moments to enjoy here.  Werner Klemperer (Col. Klink), John Banner (Sgt. Schultz) and Howard Caine (Maj. Wolfgang Hochstetter) seem to be oblivious that the scripts are getting poorer and that series' end is in sight.  In particular, these three actors continue to deliver the goods.  Huzzah for them!

2657143,4,B000IHYXIK,"In reality there was nothing funny about a German POW camp.  The Gestapo was a force predicated on evil that was anything but a laughing matter.  Yet, somehow, in a most improbably way this show poked fun at both.  Despite the contrived plots, the utter impossibility of a group of POWs to pass as Germans, and the fact that the Germans in the plot both understood and spoke English with native fluency, the script writing still comes across as slick at it ever was.

True, one has to buy into all the illogic that the show has to offer in order to find it humorous.  The total implausibility of the whole set up is that of a classic sitcom:  A fool for a commandant, a semi nincompoop for a Gestapo officer, an arrogant egotist for a Nazi general, and witty if somewhat nutty POWs somehow becomes immaterial if one accepts the set up and enjoys the dialog and the contrived plots.

I think this is one of the show that you either like it or you don't; there is no middle ground.  I, for one, find the dialogue well enough conceived that I can ignore the other aspects of the show which, in reality, were impossible to achieve.

If you are new to Hogan and his gang, let me suggest that you give it a try.  John Banner as Sergeant Schultz is a first class actor; so is Werner Klemperer as Col. Klink.  Hogan and his crew were well acted by Bob Crane, Larry Hovis, Richard Dawson, Ivan Dixon, and Robert Clary.

Leon Askin as General Burkhalter and Howard Caine as the bullying Major Hochstetter are as well acted as they are believable in their roles.

So let me suggest that you buy into the nonsense of the plot and focus on the acting skills, the poking of fun at the Nazi regime, and the quality of the dialogue.  Those aspects of the show are enduring even if the plots get a little thin.",1178496000,,1793,4.3293413173652695

The story line of a prisoner-of-war camp in Germany in which American ""prisoners"" are running an ""underground railroad"" right under the noses of the Germans could easily have gone down a different road and not have been the great comedy it became.  It would only have taken a change in casting, using American actors for all the parts.  The casting department must have seen this, because many of the actors actually came from the countries they represented.  John Banner, for instance, was actually a German soldier in WWII.  Richard Dawson is really British.  Many of the French underground were really French, etc.  It all folds together to create one of the funniest shows ever produced, and it doesn't matter which episode you see.
