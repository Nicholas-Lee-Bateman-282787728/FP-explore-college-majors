8647477,1,B00J2MQ0EM,"I've seen bits of this show while I was down in Mexico (July 2014) and from what I've heard about it, it's a piece of utter trash. It seems trying it's best to cash-in the successes of the teen-bopper shows of Disney and Nickelodeon (both past and present; mainly the latter). The characters themselves are annoying teenager stereotypes, the show seems to glorify bullying and also has tons of painfully unfunny and forced jokes. Televisa (the producer of the show) had the nerve to team with Cartoon Network Latin America and Brazil to produce this. It may okay for some people but for most older Hispanic people (myself included) or those who aren't, I shouldn't recommended this.",1431388800,,682,4.837606837606837
