8655978,5,B000RWDYFE,"The Final Test is the best movie ever made about cricket. (Australian mini-series Bodyline and Howzat are also worth watching.) The film's screenplay was penned by the great Terence Rattigan, whom actor Peter O'Toole rightly called ""the century's greatest playwright.""

Set in the early 1950s, The Final Test features some of the great English cricket players of the period and uses a famous event from the career of Don Bradman, the greatest cricketer of all time. In a witty and moving story of a father and son conflicting over their value differences, the story dramatizes the theme of understanding and respecting the values of others. The Final Test is British cinema at its best.",1396137600,2,686,5.017543859649122
