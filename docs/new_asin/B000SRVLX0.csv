8206551,4,B000SRVLX0,"This DVD contains eight 40-minute episodes of two of Aurthur Ransome's books - ""Coot Club"" and ""The Big Six"" made for television broadcast in 1983. Neither characters nor the location has anything in common with the book ""Swallows and Amazons"", but the situations described and the characters involved in Coot Club and Big Six are very familiar.
The setting is on the Norfolk Broads in east England (for those of us outside the UK looking at a map of the area would help) a flat marshy expanse with canals, open water and slow moving rivers populated by a variety of rural characters, four local boat urchins and two visitors from London who all love boats, sailing and the water.
The books are related and events in the first are referenced in the second, but are both stand alone stories. In both stories the children land in trouble, sometimes of their own making, and have to figure a way of getting out of it. They all show a remarkable amount of pluck and independence.
The production value is high with a large cast of antique boats, buses, cars and extras.
I have a 7 and 11 year old, and both were enthralled with story. It is all very innocent and sweet without being sickeningly so. The plot is dialog driven at points and the story fairly long, so younger children may get lost.
Technical notes:
Although this is a region free (i.e. region 0) DVD it is in PAL format. Most US DVD players will not be able to play a PAL formatted DVD (the US uses NTSC format), but it will play on a computer DVD/Blu-Ray player.",1378684800,,1522,4.498194945848375
