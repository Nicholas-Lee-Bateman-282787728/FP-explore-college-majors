1113882,4,7509529700,"`Che Part One' (aka as The Argentine) explores Che Guevara's experiences during the Cuban Revolution based on his own Cuban diaries. It looks at how he developed as a revolutionary and how Castro gave him more and more responsibility as his talents grew. He comes across as idealistic and honest and looked after both his men and the peasants in the areas he fought in. Del Toro acts superbly throughout and you could really believe this is a documentary, rather than a film, as the acting and direction is so good. This is shot mostly in Spanish, with subtitles, which adds authenticity to the film and isn't a hindrance to understanding or enjoyment. This film also uses colour and black and white cinematography to good effect. The revolution part of the film is shot in colour and the scenes where Che is talking at the U.N. after the war has been won is shot in black and white. This is very effective and gives the film a historical feel to it. Having read the book I know that rather being a exact chronology of the revolutionary war, it is rather a series of the exploits, battles and experiences as told by Che. This film follows the same format and if you don't know some of the history of the Cuban issue it may be confusing at times. For example it make reference to the Bay of Pigs (where the U.S. sponsored an invasion of Cuba) but doesn't really specify any other information about it for those unaware of the history. Although in the films defence I am guessing the kind of person who would want to see this film would have a rudimentary understanding of the war and general history in the first place. This is quite slow moving at times and isn't good for those expecting an all Hollywood action movie, but if you enjoy authentic feeling bio-pics then this is well considering. It is brilliantly acted, has amazing locations and shines a light on the character of a twentieth century icon.

1113885,3,7509529700,"Steven Soderbergh created one of those movies that is lucky to have been made at all -- a four-hour-plus biopic of Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara.

But even split in half, it's something of a mixed bag. ""Che - Part 1: Argentine"" is a visually gorgeous and low-key piece of work that focuses on the pivotal slices of Guevara's life, with an amazing lead performance by Benicio Del Toro as the titular revolutionary. Unfortunately, it's also a very slow-moving affair that brushes past some of the more unsavory facets of Che Guevara's life and personality... and ironically many of the positive ones.

In the 1960s, Guevara (Benicio Del Toro) is in New York City for a UN conference, being interviewed by a US reporter about his viewpoints as a guerilla leader and revolutionary. Then the narrative jumps back a decade to when he and others (including Fidel Castro) consider the many injustices over in Cuba and start planning for a revolution. Despite being Argentinian by birth, Che follows them to Cuba and joins the guerilla revolution.

But despite his start as a medic, Che began showing talents in other areas, and becomes a leader of the guerilla outlaws in the Cuban countryside. He grapples with his own ill health (asthma), the loss of his compatriots and the attacks from the military, which also threaten some of the non-revolutionaries -- and as time goes on, their revolution gained power and notice, and began the ultimate battle for control of Cuba.

Rather than the usual biographical movie format, Steven Soderbergh approaches ""Che - Part 1: Argentine"" as if he were filming a documentary. There are no scenes of little Che being kicked by a rich guy or melodramatic subplots -- it's quite literally a slice of the pivotal point of Che Guevara's life, and a 1960s shakycaminterview adds to that feeling. As an added note of authenticity, almost all of the dialogue is in Spanish rather than poorly-accented English, giving a you-are-there feel.

Much of the story is devoted to the guerillas staggering through lush, richly green countryside, and living in very rough surroundings; while the storyline is rather slow, it speeds up gradually as Guevara grows in influence and the revolution really heats up. Pinging gunshots, explosions, tanks, tense chases through deserted streets and burning trains all play a part in the harrowing finale, all the more so because you know that all this mayhem actually took place.

Del Toro is, to put it mildly, astonishing as Guevara -- not only is he a dead ringer physically (with the right facial hair and clothes), but he exudes a quiet charisma, literate intelligence and power that make you see exactly why someone might follow him if they agreed with his politics. No one else in the story really gets to stand out, but Del Toro simply IS the cast all by himself.

Yet ironically it's a piously bland, virtuous portrait of Guevera. Soderbergh wimps out on the cruel, extremist sides of his personality and the regime he helped create; on the other hand, he also brushes over the man's fierce intellect, his writing, and world interests. It feels like we're looking at one mirrored facet of a very complex man, and surely more of who he was -- the good, the bad AND the ugly -- could have been included.

It's obvious Soderbergh put a lot of heart into producing the raw, realistic ""Che - Part 1: Argentine,"" but his glorification and simplication of a controversial figure drags the first half of his labor of love.",1248739200,22,3479,4.854974704890388

This is the Hollywood history of an important person in the mid-20th century. Ernesto Guevara joined the small band led by Fidel Castro that landed in Cuba in 1956. They survived the attacks by the Cuban Air Force and Army, grew in strength and support, and finally won the revolution against Batista in 1959. There is slight mention of the other people in Cuba who were against Batista, who grabbed power in 1952. Some say Batista had the backing of the NY bankers who owned or controlled vast tracts of sugar plantations and benefitted from low wages paid to the workers. Popular opinion in America was then with the rebels, just like it was in the 1890s. That changed by the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis. [In the 1920s National City Bank sold South American bonds to many Americans, who were swindled when they became worthless. This is like the recent Collateralized Debt Obligations.]

The movie shows the small band coming ashore in 1956. Their uniforms look like American military surplus, so too their Garand rifles. Fidel's band survived and prospered in the rural areas because the people were in sympathy with them. They attacked Batista's army and advanced on Havana until Batista fled to Miami. The new government held trials for many supporters of Batista, then shot the guilty. [This also happened in France and the other countries liberated in 1945.] One important strategy was the formation of an armed popular militia to replace a mercenary (or ""professional"") army. This eliminated the source of many revolts that plagued South American republics since the early 19th century. [The ""Alliance for Progress"" led to revolts and military dictatorships in most South American republics. These new governments borrowed and spent, taxes for foreign bankers oppressed the people. The mismanagement by military rulers led to their overthrow in turn.]

Could Cuba survive against a powerful enemy? The Bay of Pigs invasion failed because of poor planning by the CIA and a lack of popular support in Cuba. The US economic blockade of Cuba was followed by expanded trade with the former colonial ruler in Europe. Ironic? Next Fidel sought an alliance with the Soviet Union for arms and missiles for self-defense. This ended at the brink of Atomic War. An understanding saw the withdrawal of missiles from Cuba and Turkey. Che disapproved of these policies! Fidel no longer depended on Che's advice. [Around this time Cuba sent military help to countries in Africa for their fight against colonialism.] Fidel's priority was Cuba, not for any adventures against the military dictatorships in South America. Che decided to try his ideas in another country. He and a small band went to Bolivia.

Did he over-estimate his prowess because of a fatal pride? Che did not cooperate with his potential allies in Bolivia. He seemed to think he could win by military means alone (the opposite of his past actions). This was counter-productive. [Note how he blamed the failures on his under-fed troops! No support and help from the local people. The Bolivian army closed in on his band, ambushed and captured him. But their orders were not to take any live prisoners. [Did the US send specialists to locate Che? Why doesn't this work in Afghanistan?] This is like some classic drama where the prowess of a hero leads to pride, and then failure. ""Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad."" [This is from the older NTSC video.]",1413244800,,3435,4.948006932409013

7899800,5,7509529700,TRUE REVOLUTIONARY STORY CHE LIVES!!!! In our hearts and memories forever. Potrayal was tremendous. Comandante Che Guevara sacrificed everything for the struggles of others unknown to him.,1366675200,,188,6.0
7899801,5,7509529700,"Soderbergh's effort is inspired but somewhat displaced. His approach - to focus on selected aspects of Che's guerrilla career, at the beginning and end thereof - has its merits. The time limits of filmmaking require one to get at the heart of one's subject quickly and not crowd too much into a film narrative. Yet Soderbergh has ironically done that by drawing his production out into four hours.

To be fair one should see this as two films, a ""Che I"" and ""Che 2"" as a sequel. The second, like most sequels, doesn't measure up to the first and turns into an endurance test on the part of the viewer - though this may be intended, to emphasize the futility and desperation that enclosed Che in Bolivia. Perhaps he even welcomed the end of this campaign, as one welcomes its end on screen.

A better complement to ""I"" would have devoted perhaps a half hour to Bolivia. Che was not the most outstanding of guerrilla warriors in Cuba or Latin America, and there were other aspects to Che's life besides combat. A look at his time as commander of La Cabana Fortress, overseeing the Revolutionary Tribunals; or pushing a hard line during the Missile Crisis; or portraying the origin of that iconic photograph, at the mass funeral of counter-revolutionary terrorist victims, would have more engaged the general viewer and done more justice to his legacy.

Still, Soderbergh has done a better job than mainstream Hollywood ever could have, had it even deigned to touch the subject. Only Soderbergh's own radical edge could do this project any justice at all, and that we must give him.",1349308800,,1579,4.734545454545454
7899802,5,7509529700,"This is an involving account of Che's participation in the Cuban Revolution, from his meeting with Castro in Mexico in 1956, to the ouster of Batista in 1959.

The filming is wonderful.  Most of the movie takes place in the rain-sodden jungles of eastern Cuba, and the rebels march up and down mountains, forage for food and recruits, and occasionally fight.

It is a saga of learning, training, suffering, and coming to know the rural, desperately poor, population.

The parts in Cuba are in color--vivid, almost surreal greens and browns and the blinding blue of the sky--while the flash-forwards to Che's visit to the U.N. in 1964 are in black and white.  This is a superb idea.  Not only does it give a gritty, you-are-there documentary feel, but it gives you the impression that the Cuban parts are life, whereas all the political posturing and sniping in New York is mere theater.

The acting is wonderful.  Everyone, from well-known actors like Benicio del Toro and Egdar Ramirez to the many many who people the guerrillas and barrios, is really good.

The movie makes Che seem both heroic and quite human--learning from mistakes, upholding principles, finding his way to leadership skills.",1336521600,4,1197,4.945
7899803,2,7509529700,"This is classic rent-a-crowd movie making, distracted as I was by
the seeming paucity of the rebels, the village and towns people
and the army.
Cuba, controlled by an army of some 45 or so, was overrun in just
2 hours on my dvd copy by a rebel force of just 21. Give or take
those who got snipered. This was a war won by Castro's rebels
marching in and out of jungles, up and down mountains, crossing
streams and occupying villages with soothing words.
Here was Che - doctor, teacher, soothsayer, tactician, uncle,
father, brother - wheezing his way around the hills and jungles
of Cuba dispensing medicine, revolution, philosophy and the sort
of mumbo-jumbo that Sun Tzu was famous for. Go on, google him!
This extraordinary saga fails in so many ways not least due to the
lack of extras, poor editing and the slapdash and quite puzzling
battle scenes.
Put all that to one side, though, and what Soderbergh leaves us
with in Part One is the site of Che on his victorious way to
Havana castigating some young soldiers for stealing a car.
Insisting they take it back to whence it came, Che deprives them
of a glorious drive to victory. With a puff on his pipe and the
ridiculous self-satisfied look of a revolutionary with holier than
thou morals our hero heads off to meet up with Castro.
Should I bother with Part Two?
Will Havana have a population of more than 60?",1324252800,2,1366,4.512096774193548
