3946145,5,B002LFPAXO,"I was pleasantly surprised when this DVD arrived.  It is not what I thought I was ordering but after receiving it, I loved it so much I ordered two more for some friends!! Very cool!!",1360281600,,183,4.228571428571429
3946146,5,B002LFPAXO,"If you have someone, this is a great DVD to be cuddled up in front of. You will love it.",1356220800,,88,3.45
3946147,1,B002LFPAXO,"I bought this item expecting some parts of John Denvers holiday special with Olivia Newton John.  ALL this dvd is is a cheap picture of a fire in a fireplace with a number of songs.  No Olivia pictured, no John, just a fireplace and some poor recordings of songs! I'm not even returning this dvd... I'm destroying it, taking the hit! and writing this so no one will be suckered into purchasing it if they print my review!!",1330387200,10,422,4.397435897435898
3946148,1,B002LFPAXO,"When I saw this product offered at Amazon.com in August 2010, there was no product information with it and no photo, so I called Amazon to see if this was in fact the 1975 DVD of the Rocky Mountain Christmas TV special.  Amazon confirmed (after some research) that it was.  However, today I see this is just another Fireplace DVD with Rocky Mountain Christmas music as a background.  I have shopped Amazon for years and have always been pleased with their products and service; however, I am very disappointed with this experience.",1287446400,61,531,4.75
3946149,1,B002LFPAXO,"This DVD was of such bad quality that you could not determine much of the music. We thought it was a defective DVD, so we requested a new one from Amazom. When it arrived, we were saddened that it was of the same poor quality, with all of the defects in the same areas. It even quit playing at times.

There is no one to complain to, so we just sent it back and asked for our money back. We got our money back, but would have preferred a quality DVD from the on-set.

The quality was so bad, it could not even pass as a bad boot-leg copy.

I would suggest that no one purchase this product, unless they hate John Denver.

Please do not suggest we have a bad DVD player, as we use it all the time with no recording playbacks on other products.",1265500800,7,742,4.0272108843537415
3946150,5,B002LFPAXO,"The source this item was purchased from, was courteious,prompt,and professional. My shipping was even upgraded at no extra charge, so as to recieve it sooner. I was very pleased with the entire process.",1265414400,,202,5.151515151515151
3946151,4,B002LFPAXO,"I still enjoy this collection of songs after all these years. A rather interesting format, songs I would give 5 stars, format 3 stars. Not sure where the confusion came from on what it contained, unless the description has been modified to help describe it better. The cover shown is the same from the original album so at least now you know what you are getting up front. I always read the descriptions before I buy because so many on John Denver's albums available today are just remixes of older albums and you could end up buying the same thing over and over.",1256947200,13,563,4.475728155339806
3946152,1,B002LFPAXO,"What a disappointment!  The sad thing is, John Denver's Christmas special named ""A Rocky Mountain Christmas"" was outstanding.  Breaking standard practice, the whole special (except for Olivia Newton John's hit song) wasn't videotaped, but filmed.  Kodak was a major sponosor.  The nature scenes, from the mule deer running along the edge of a forest, to the egg laying, fertilization and birth of trout in a lake near Maroon Bells, the opportunity to see Annie holding their newly adopted son Zachary within the geodesic dome, the butterflies in the dome, Steve Martin and his banjo-plying, arrow through the head singing, Olivia and John doing ""Fly Away,"" and all the rest remain my absolute favorite Christmas special.  This special won Emmys for its video quality!
But no, we get a Yule Log.  Don't be screwed by this fake-out.  The CD all by itself is better, and you don't have to put up with a boring picture of a fire.  The music will keep you warm all by itself.  You don't need a fake log to feel good about the music.
But you should feel sad that most of the television shows John did have never been offered to the public.",1254960000,48,1133,4.681818181818182
3946153,3,B002LFPAXO,"I got my hopes up when I saw this title and thought it was the old tv special I remembered fondly from the 70s.(The one with Denver in the glass-enclosed dome in the snow.)Further reading revealed it is merely Xmas scenes underscored by the accompanying cd of the same name. Luckily I didn't buy it under false pretences,but I thought others might make the same mistake.
However,I may reconsider,as the original record is a tasteful,enjoyable Xmas record and I can imagine snow scenes would go well with the music. Festive albums generally are a pretty awful bunch,and this nice understated LP,with gentle orchestations by Lee Holdridge is one of the better ones. Denver's rendition of 'O Holy Night',done in his lyric,sympathetic tenor,is worth the price of the record alone.",1252195200,27,776,5.023255813953488
8372785,5,B002LFPAXO,"I purchased this DVD several years ago and, after reading some of the bad reviews, I felt compelled to write my own review;

Yes, I know, like many, I didn't read all the details and thought it was the Great 1975 video of John's best TV special ever;
don't worry, PBS reruns it at Christmas time so you can tape it and enjoy; for a while I left this dvd aside but now that I'm
very much into Christmas Fireplace DVDs, I played it the other day and was Very happy with it as a Yuletide log.

The entire Christmas album is featured as background music; you can choose the songs you want to hear (I love 'Christmas for Cowboys' and 'Aspenglow'),

and this DVD has something few of Yule log ones have: you press on the 'angle' button on your remote and you can switch from three different scenes, exactly the ones you see on the artwork; after seeing many Great Fireplace Christmas DVDs, I think this one aged very well and
I'm very glad I bought it; I like to re-play the TV Special, then the Yule log version.

To each his own but for myself, I give it 5 Stars!",1479859200,,1059,4.201970443349754
8372786,4,B002LFPAXO,an okay recording. Enjoyable watching too but the lack of animation means that it truly did not feel like a DVD,1427241600,,111,4.333333333333333
8372787,1,B002LFPAXO,"I Want the Real Thing!

Why is it so difficult to find a DVD of John Denver's Rocky Mountain Christmas TV special?????
EVERYONE is looking for it!  They could make so much money off it.
It is a very special memory for many people, not to mention an amazing show for the Colorado scenery alone.
Add to that John Denver singing, skiing and playing with a grizzly bear.
The fact that John is no longer with us, makes it even more precious.
PLEASE someone find it and put it on DVD, before it's lost forever :(",1419292800,,506,4.260416666666667
8372788,1,B002LFPAXO,I was so disappointed when I received this. I was expecting his movie which I originally seen on tv in 1985. I know it was filmed by Kodak. When I read the description on this I saw nothing about it being only music with a picture of a log burning. Ludicrous!,1418601600,,259,4.098039215686274
8372789,3,B002LFPAXO,"This is NOT the TV Special. This is a DVD that shows Christmas scenes, like a burning log, while music from John's ""Rocky Mountain Christmas"" album plays. It did not occur to me to read the reviews since I already knew I'd like the special. It looks like they added ""The Yule Log DVD), but apparently, that was not enough to convince me I was not ordering the TV special.",1418342400,,371,4.314285714285714
8372790,5,B002LFPAXO,"Ok, by now we all know it's not the TV special.  It doesn't claim to be.  If you don't like the fireplace, turn off the T.V.  What you DO get is the original album in pristine 48/24 sound.  It's amazing and well worth the money.",1415577600,,228,4.0
8372791,5,B002LFPAXO,"I have been a John Denver fan since 1970 and I bought the album  when it first came out in the 70s.  This is my favorite Christmas album, and I play it frequently during the holiday season.  The songs, especially ""A Baby Just Like You"" picked up new meanings for me after my children were born, and I absolutely love to listen to John' version of  ""Oh Holy Night.""  The yule log and winter cabin scenes just enhance the mood.",1405209600,,425,4.2625
8372792,5,B002LFPAXO,I bought this for a gift. The person I bought it for has all JD's music and dvd's. He is easy to listen to and makes sense with his lyrics.,1382745600,,139,3.6666666666666665
8372793,3,B002LFPAXO,"I mistakenly thought this DVD was a John Denver Christmas Special, however it is a video of a fire place burning for effect, and another of a winter cabin scene with John Denvers Rocky Mountain Christmas background music.  Oh well..",1365811200,5,232,4.8
8372794,1,B002LFPAXO,"Music was classic John Denver but I thought I was buying the DVD of his winter special taped in Georgetown, CO.  My mistake,",1363046400,2,124,4.391304347826087
