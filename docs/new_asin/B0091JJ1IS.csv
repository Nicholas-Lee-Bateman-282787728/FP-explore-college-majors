8534280,1,B0091JJ1IS,"Steven, Joe, and the boys need to sue whoever put this DVD together.  It's totally amateurish and is NOT a documentary at all.  Somebody strung together random video clips and then called it a ""documentary.""  Yeah right.  I could have put this together on my Mac.

There are 5 ""scenes"" on this DVD.  The first one is entitled, ""Interview Practic.""  They actually spelled ""Practice"" wrong!!  It is printed wrong on the DVD cover AND in the DVD menu.  What the heck!?!  How did this get approved to go to print with a spelling error???  Anyway, this first ""scene"" is footage of Steven, Joe, and the boys practicing their interview techniques, probably in the early 80s.  Of course, you'd never know when it was shot, because this pitiful DVD doesn't tell you. AND, during this first ""scene"" a section of the footage is repeated -- clearly an error, but nobody apparently caught it before they went into production.

Then following the first ""scene,"" there are three interviews that look like they were copied by a VHS recorder off the TV.

And then the last ""scene"" is the worst of all, because it is entitled ""Biography.""  And -- get this -- they stole the Aerosmith written biography -- probably off of Wikipedia or something -- and the it SCROLLS down the screen.  You literally would have to read the ""biography"" -- WTF?!?!

The title of the DVD does mention that it is an ""unauthorized documentary"" -- and boy is that evident.  And, as I said before, it no where near resembles a documentary. There is no cohesiveness to the ""scenes.""  There is no narration or explanations, no nothing.  Just random clips burned onto a DVD.

Tacky tacky tacky, and whoever put this together should be sued. Sorry to be so harsh, but I'm extremely disgusted by this product.  These folks should not be making any money from this.  Somebody needs to tell Aerosmith management, so they can do something about getting it out of the marketplace.",1357430400,12,1927,4.703592814371257
