5488763,5,B00AREP9VE,"One night while skimming through the channels I came across this series on our local PBS channel and it looked interesting enough to make me pause. I don't know what it was about the show, other than it has such a unique format, but before long I watched the entire show and I was hooked! At the time I didn't know if ""Death In Paradise"" was a movie or what, so I looked it up on amazon and learned it was a detective series. The pre-order price on amazon was $31.48 for Season 1 and $31.48 for Season 2. I then read a review stating the season sets are available at amazon UK for much less than what amazon US is charging, so I went to amazon UK and ordered the combined Season 1 & 2 Box Set and the total price including shipping was only $18.11!!! PLEASE NOTICE that the UK sets are ""Region 2"" or (PAL) and will NOT PLAY on a machine that is NOT a multi-regional machine. Mine is and most newer DVD players/recorders are now multi-regional I'm told, but I would recommend checking your unit before ordering. You can find the set I ordered at the following link:

5488764,5,B00AREP9VE,This is a great mystery series with the usual British humour!  The disk plays ONLY in the European Region; however a region free DVD player will play the disk.,1380844800,,159,4.482758620689655
5488765,5,B00AREP9VE,"This is an altogether charming, visually gorgeous, well-done Whodunit that never fails to surprise us when the villain is revealed. It's not about grisly crime scenes or nerve-wracking chases - it's about becoming part of a likable fictitious community and having fun while figuring out Who Dun It. Despite the fact that it deals with murder, the show always leaves me smiling. I agree with other reviewers that the role of Poole is cast and played ideally, but this can be said for every member of the cast. Two of my favorite characters are actually Fidel, the young father who tries so hard to do well in his chosen career, and Bordey's French mother, a strong, charismatic woman who never beats us over the head with macho feminism. The fact that even the supporting characters win us over so completely says something wonderful about what a well-done show this is, yet one of the show's best achievements is actually quite subtle: they've managed to allow the characters and their relationships to evolve in ways that seem natural rather than staged.",1380499200,23,1055,4.866666666666666
5488766,5,B00AREP9VE,"Simply love this series. Currently it has not been released in the US.
I saved myself a small bundle of money by buying it from Amazon. UK.it is available
In the UK now. The cost for season one in US dollars is $7.38. For season two the cost is $9.39. Shipping costs were $6.45. So add it up,the cost for season 1&2 including
Shipping is $23.22 US dollars.
Do yourself a favor and by a region free player and save yourself money in the long run if you think you will be buying more dvd's from England.
Over the years I have bought several series ( Lewis,New Tricks,Poirot,Miss marple etc)
and I saved enough in the costs to buy a region free player.
Also,season 3 will be available on Oct. 14/13
Hope this was helpful.",1380067200,54,718,4.325925925925926
5488767,5,B00AREP9VE,"It's great to finally see that this series has been released as a Region 1 set.  Its certainly about time and long overdue!

Death in Paradise manages to be a detective series with a difference - all credit to the script writers that they have been able to come up with a completely unique scenario after all the police series which have been on our screens over the years. Personally I liked the first series from the word go, but I think it has got better as it has gone along and it is certainly now right up there with my favorite television viewing.

At the end of Series 1 we saw Detective Inspector Richard Poole on the dock of the island of Sainte-Marie where the series is set, appearing to be considering remaining on the island. Series 2 sees a continuation of his career on the island, with new murders to exercise his considerable investigative skills. Ben Miller is an excellent choice for the straight laced Poole and plays the part to perfection. His rather unlikely partner is Detective Sergeant Camille Bordey, played by Sara Martins. The chemistry between the pair is quite clear and has grown as the show has gone along. This is a major factor in its success. Mention should also be made of the parts of Dwayne Myers, the oldest member of the team, and Commissioner Selwyn Patterson who was responsible for bringing Poole on board as these characters are also memorably acted.

The episodes are quite varied this time round and range from the white owner of a plantation who is found with a machete in his back, and who has rather a tangled personal life to Camille's friend, a singer, who dies mysteriously whilst performing on a yacht. Poole has his own distinctive style of operation. He quietly investigates, takes everything in and when he is ready gathers everyone together and makes his pronouncement. A different time and background, but in a strange way Poole's style does remind me of Poirot.

The last episode paved the way for a third series since Poole had chosen to return to the island after a trip to London. Indeed it has now been confirmed that another series has been commissioned and is due to view next year. Something to look forward to!",1379980800,30,2179,4.634715025906735
5488768,5,B00AREP9VE,"Still only available in Region 2 and 4 format, as was the first series so this will only play on your region 2 or region free DVD player. Why the BBC has not released this excellent series in region 1 (North American) format yet is a mystery in itself.

5488769,5,B00AREP9VE,"This series has it all: humor, exotic setting, a murder in every episode, wit and that great ""ah ha"" moment when Richard explains it all.  I even bought an all-region dvd player so I could play the dvds.  I certainly hope they bring it back for several more seasons.  Can't believe it was not as popular as New Tricks, another favorite of mine. The characters are unpredictable and the actors seem to really enjoy their roles.

The production values are a little light, which is the only reason I didn't give this 5 stars.  but the formula for the show is fun; a displaced British detective who doesn't like the sun or sand is an investigator on a small Caribbean Island.  Near the end of the show, the detective gathers all interested parties and reveals the killer.  characters are very interesting and the scenery is gorgeous.  combine that with not figuring out who the killer is and you've got a great show!",1475712000,,534,4.578947368421052

5488873,4,B00AREP9VE,"There are 3 problems with this series:
1) Use of profanity.  This could be a wonderful show for a parent to enjoy with their teen children, if Ben Miller did not periodically say, ""Christ"" (as an expletive).  It occurs once and episode, and, for that reason, the show could have been just as good and use some other word instead.
2) The silliness of Ben Miller always wearing a suit in a hot island.
3) There is often a clever murder to be solved.

The best kind of a murder mystery is one where the clues are right in front of the viewer's face, so that, if the viewer were smart enough and observant enough, he could put together the mystery himself.  Although these episodes are clever, and there are things for the viewer work out, rarely is the viewer completely able to reason out each mystery in advance.

The female co-star is charming and easy on the eyes.",1455235200,,865,4.415094339622642

5488889,5,B00AREP9VE,"Season 2 of Death in Paradise doesn't disappoint. In fact, it got better. I love that the wonderful original cast is intact. Seeing them again in this season was a joy, they perform well together. The actors have grown on me and of course, DI Poole played by Ben Miller gave this show the hilarity and detective brilliance. He's well supported by DS Camille and Officer Dwayne and Fidel. You'll see that the fish-out-of-water-character is slowly getting used to life on the island with the little help of liming with his colleagues. I enjoyed watching this original team and actors immensely so I'm glad I've got the DVD.

I had hope the cast will continue on Seasons 3, 4 and soon Season 5, which will air in January 2016, but sadly actors had to leave one by one. It's just that I don't like the new seasons as much as I like the first two seasons of DIP. But to each his own, get this and Season 1 as well. You'll enjoy it. Oh yeah, like one reviewer said, you can save buying it from Amazon UK, which I'm going to do next, (if you have a region free dvd player). Worth it not just dollar-wise but also the packaging design. I just hate the cheesy DVD covers of this US DVD release. At least, the UK DVD were decently designed and packaged. They kept it simple and not like this plethora of collage images like a scrapbook page. UGH.",1444348800,2,1336,4.344

Fairly lightweight plots--""Mr. Monk"" episodes  come to mind--but the ambience and the ""Paradise"" aspects of the surroundings make this enjoyable watching.  Do not expect depth and you'll be good with this. We've watched all of Season One and almost all of Season Two, and find it charming, the equivalent of easy listening music.

5488989,4,B00AREP9VE,"The first season caught me by surprise and I found it very engaging. Marrying the classic mystery format with the 'fish out of water' format gave it a cock-eyed appeal. The second season is more of the same with some notable differences.

Here's the scoop. Inspector Poole is back as the dyed in the wool Brit trying to cope with life on the Isle of St. Marie in the Caribbean. He still struggles with the heat, culture and lack of a good cup of tea while solving incredibly complex murder cases.

The cases themselves are near rubber stamps of those in the first season. Though some fall a bit short of the mark, most are still very clever and had me going to the end. The longer arc has changed a bit. Dutiful deputy Fidel Best has stepped up his game and is studying for sergeant stripes. There is a developing attraction between Camille and Poole which is a bit of a problem. This sort of thing has been done before but you see little things that bring the two together. That is not evident here. Poole is still the stiff-necked guy with few social skills. He simply does not know how to interact with people. So, since she didn't like him when they first met, why is she starting to like him now?

That aside, this is still a fun series. It has a good mix of plot, characters and setting. If you liked the first series this should fare well with you.",1428624000,,1355,4.326771653543307
5488990,5,B00AREP9VE,"Love this show. The acting is great. it is a light comedic mystery series. The characters have come into their own in the second season. The island is gorgeous. There are so many red herrings in each episode that it is fun to try to guess who done it. The series is done ala Agatha Christie's, Poirot.
Big wish!!! More episodes per season.",1428451200,,339,4.396825396825397
5488991,5,B00AREP9VE,This series is another unexpected British mystery drama that transports you to an island getaway in the sun.

Ben Miles' portrayal of DI Richard Poole is brilliant...he's somehow turned an annoying character into someone who is not only endearing but who you root for.  There is one episode where Poole squares off with an old colleague from the Met.  This colleague is derisive and verbally abusive toward Poole.  I found myself wanting to throttle the old copper because he was nasty to Poole.  I also love Poole's unexpected ""friendship"" with Harry, his reptilian roommate.  This is one of the few tv shows where I love EVERY episode and I can't wait for more of this show,it has totally won me over.

5489120,4,B00AREP9VE,"DEATH IN PARADISE, SEASON 2. This welcome second installment of the BBC television series, made with the support of the French  Caribbean region of Guadeloupe  and filmed thereis a quintessentially British mystery.  In a light-hearted, humorous crime drama that has been playing on some PBS channels in the United States, stalwart strait-laced English Inspector Richard Poole, in season 2, is still trapped on the stunning fictitious Caribbean island of St. Marie.  He was a fish out of water when Scotland Yard  sent him to the tiny island to solve the murder of his predecessor in the first place.  He did so successfully, only to then find himself seconded to this hot little island. Unfortunately, he hated the sun, sea, sand and seafood: the island isn't really paradise for him.  Nor is he suited to the pace of life on the island, which, while fictional, reminds me of St. Lucia.

And, at this new post, Poole has encountered a very different type of policing than what he is used to: it challenges his more buttoned-up sensibility.  The rest of the local  fictional Saint Marie police force  two cops! -- has their own unique way of doing things. But, though Poole would never admit it, together, they make a perfect team.  The season 2 box set consists of two DVDs, each holding four new mysteries, totaling about 466 minutes of entertainment.  And thank goodness, and the BBC, subtitles, for who would want to miss a moment of this delightful lilting Caribbean-accented dialog.  Though, wonderfully enough, the sound quality is quite good; even I was able to make out the entire dialog, without shaking the house on the volume meter.

Ben Miller, PRIMEVAL, makes the role of Detective Inspector Poole, the hapless, cranky, yet brilliant detective, his own, endowing it with charm and affection.  And Sara Martins, PARIS, JE TAIME, as his gorgeous new partner Detective Sergeant Borday, is fine. Other series members live up to the standard, including Danny Jules-John as Officer Dwayne Myers; Gary Carr as Officer Fidel Best; Elisabeth Bourgine as Catherine, Camilles lovely and charming mother and Don Warrington as Police Commissioner Selwyn Patterson.  Both series are also packed full of new pretty faces, British and Caribbean.  And many, many well-known British stars/supporting players: I clocked, among others Colin Salmon, (PRIME SUSPECT); Adrian Dunbar, (LINE OF DUTY); Robert Pugh, (GAME OF THRONES); Philip Jackson, (POIROT); Sharon Small, (INSPECTOR LYNLEY).  Also Gemma Jones, Joanna David, Julie Graham, Phil Davis, Claire Holman, Cherie Lunghi, Nicholas Farrell, Rupert Graves.

The episodes are:
A Murder on the Plantation
DI Richard Poole struggles to muster that loving feeling for the local voodoo festival.

An Unholy Death
DI Richard Poole is perplexed by a fatal fire at the island convent.

Death in the Clinic
DI Richard Poole is baffled by an apparent suicide at a plastic surgery clinic.

A Deadly Curse
Camille attempts to persuade Richard to take an interest in the folklore of Saint Marie.

Murder Onboard
The pressure is on for DI Richard Poole and his team to solve a murder on a party boat.

A Dash of Sunshine
There is a blast from the past for Richard when an old colleague turns up in Saint Marie.

A Stormy Occurrence
Is a storm to blame for a death at the university, or is something more sinister afoot?

A Deadly Party
DI Poole and his colleagues find themselves up against a daring and elusive opponent.

Hot, hot, hot, thats the location, location, location on the screen, and I adore the soundtrack, as I have apparently always adored Caribbean music.  You can any time give me an interlude of doing the Rock Steady to Blondies The Tide is High, of which we hear snatches here.  The mysteries: well, they're not down, dirty and depressing in the latest British style, more old-fashioned fun Agatha Christies Marple and Poirot style.  Some might consider them a bit clunky. But rather original, some even unique in my experience.  And multi-layered.  We also get some of the most charming interludes, local color mostly, that seem to  have been trimmed from the broadcast versions.  If youve the patience for an entertainment that moves more slowly than most police procedurals, certainly more slowly than most American cop shows, but offers plenty of entertainment along the way, this might just be for you.",1418428800,2,4360,5.008333333333334

5489136,5,B00AREP9VE,"Well, first of all the setting:  gorgeous. It's filmed on location.  If you want a trip to a tropical island, just watch this show.  That alone should be enough for you, that and the real cultural milieu that is uniquely and lovingly -- it seems -- filmed for this program.

Believe it or not, this is a detective, hm, what?  Drama?  Comedy?  Neither and both.  The island police department team (a little tongue in cheek here, calling it a ""police dept."" at least until a real detective arrives from cold, rainy London, whining about the heat but refusing to take off his tie and suit coat!)  Gradually, the police become better at policing, and the plots get thicker.  The writing is witty, the team are superb actors, requiring acting range from the comedic to more emotionally complex. They, and the writers, pull it off -- this incredible balance between comedy and drama.  Dramedy??  But nothing lasts too long on this island!!  The team, as it begins to coalesce under the utterly quirky leadership of the London detective, do break difficult island cases using, well, often old-fashioned methods and ingenuity.

This is one of the best shows I have seen in a long time, and I just happened upon it on my Kindle.  Watch it!!  The writing is witty, the characters wonderfully portrayed by a fantastic team of actors and guest stars, the setting is to die for. Or vacation to, if you can!!  It would take too long to write a review worthy of this show.  All I can say is, again, WATCH it, you won't be disappointed.  Then write a review of it, and BEG BBC to RENEW IT for another season and send it over to the U.S. so WE can be totally entertained and entwined with the folks who take life slower and easier but have all the human desires, challenges and foibles we all share as human beings.  10 stars, if I could!",1417824000,2,1821,4.510703363914373

5489168,5,B00AREP9VE,"Review of US DVD release of this  funny ""fish out of water"" BBC France mystery series- No spoilers! No ""plot summaries! ""Just info you can use.

IMPORTANT NOTE: As I post this review there are already 35 reviews posted here. But many are of other versions of this release.  That is because Amazon combines ALL reviews of ALL formats (broadcast TV, Streaming, Non-US region versions and US DVD) when they list the reviews. I always recommend that prospective buyers sort by ""newest first"" and then look to see what format is being reviewed. With that said, on to my review of the US DVD release (2014).

If you haven't seen Season One of this series, I highly suggest that you start there. It'll give you a little bit of background on the story. Actually Episode One will be the most important one to watch.  If you've seen Season One, I don't need to tell you much except to say that this is just as good. You already know the characters. The main ones.

What I really like about this series is that each hour long episode is a complete mystery with no cliffhangers as to who did it and how.  Yes there are some ""life events"" in the lives of the members of the Honore' PoliceForce members but they don't happen often and don't affect the outcome of the crimes. This season there are murders which involve friends or former friends of two of the cast.

I know a lot of reviewers like to give plot summaries for each episode. You won't find that here from me - and I prefer not to read them. These are mysteries and the less you know the better.

For each episode, there is a murder in the first few minutes and it is solved by the end. The private lives of Miller's character and his police team are covered too, and this creates a thread through all episodes. While - and I hope this is not a real spoiler - the series continued into for at least four series (I'm not saying any more about that!), this series ends with all the ""loose ends"" tied up. No annoying ""cliff hangers""  to deal with.  I really appreciated that!

The DVD set in the US has English subtitle option but - unlike many British mystery DVDs, I didn't have any problem understanding every word and the characters do not have heavy accents. There are no bonus features on this set either, though a short one with the cast might have been fun.

 The series was shown on US TV on regional PBS stations, not nationally, so it was new to me.  If you saw the show on PBS, it was probably edited because they need time for ""promotional"" and ""funding"" spots. But there is no nudity or strong language or graphic violence more than is usually shown on PBS.

The DVD set in the US has English subtitle option but - unlike many British mystery DVDs, I didn't have any problem understanding every word and the characters do not have heavy accents. There are no bonus features on this set either, though a short one with the cast might have been fun. I am hoping that BBC Home Video moves up the release dates for the next couple of seasons. I'm really looking forward to them

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

Meanwhile, the beautiful female sergeant on the team is developing some very warm feelings for the chief despite the fact that she regularly tells him he's pompous and pedantic and the fourth member of this tiny police force continues his carefree existence, sampling the good life whenever the opportunity presents itself.
Welcome to Season 2 of ""Death in Paradise,"" an altogether charming British detective series set on a tiny Caribbean island where crimes are pretty ordinary (murder, theft, drug smuggling) but investigations often take wildly different turns from those that Inspector Richard Poole was used to before he was posted there ""temporarily"" from England. In one case, for example, as a hurricane threatens the island the team must solve the murder of a young man. The twist: Solving the crime might just depend upon what a rubber duck saw. In another case... well, you get the picture. This is not a routine police drama by any means and if you're a fan of murder mysteries set in exotic locales you're going to want to see this second installment in this cheeky British detective series that asks the question: Will Poole ever wear shorts and sandals?.",1413763200,,1412,4.863070539419087

I really wish Ben Miller wouldn't have left as the storyline between Richard and Camille was starting to heat up and could have been an interesting subplot in future investigations.  The stories in this season help develop the main characters' storylines more than anything and probably aren't quite on par with Season 1's stories, but who cares? It's a fun, funny show with gorgeous people and places to look at.",1413504000,,446,4.868421052631579

5489202,5,B00AREP9VE,Purchased from Amazon .This show is truly different from other English shows I've seen. The story takes place in a very hot island and you see just how hot it is which is great just for a change. However the main actor seems to be unable to deal with where he is. He is a true middle class Englishman. I love the fact that he works the various crimes to the very end.,1412380800,,367,4.041095890410959

There is a lot to be learned by larger, more expensive US based TV shows from these episodes. Great casting, great settings and extremely well written scripts. EVERYTHING is great, especially Harry, which I think is an especially good added bonus!!!

Thanks again, Amazon.",1411171200,,361,5.224137931034483

5489220,5,B00AREP9VE,"This is one of my favorite shows on TV.  It reminds me quite a bit of the Colombo shows.  The only difference is that you don't know in advance ""who-dunnit"".  Beyond that, it keeps you guessing until the end.  The way the characters play off each other makes it fun to watch.  In all, it's one of the best things I have seen on TV in a long time.  Seems the plot and characters are all so well thought out that there is no need to fill in the empty spaces with sex, gore and language to compensate.",1404950400,2,498,4.030612244897959
5489221,5,B00AREP9VE,"The small island of St Marie (fictitious), part of the Caribbean's Lesser Antilles (real), is beautiful and hot, with a vibrant culture that's a mix of several countries. As the Police Commissioner told Detective Inspector Richard Poole when Poole arrived on the island in Season 1: ""Honor was colonized by the French, who lost it to the British, who lost it to the Dutch. The Dutch lost it back to the French. The French then handed it back to the British in the mid-seventies. So, 30% of the population is still French.""

This fantastic mystery series follows Detective Poole as he and his 3-person staff solve murders and assorted crimes. Poole, being a buttoned up London Metropolitan Police Detective, has culture clashes that are usually funny and sometimes sad. On the other hand, Poole is a brilliant deductor, or is it deducer, and Detective Camille and Constables Fidel and Dwayne are great in their jobs. All of them are wonderfully portrayed by excellent actors. I particularly like how Poole occasionally demonstrates forensic labwork on a shoestring. I highly recommend this series. It's not necessary, but if you can, start with Season 1, to really get the flavor of how Poole has to struggle with his new position, and how the four of them forge themselves into a formidable team.

Season 2 of ""Death in Paradise"" first aired in England in January 2013. If you haven't already seen either Season 1 or 2, I would gently suggest that you watch Season 1 first - to get the full flavor of Inspector Poole's fish-out-water introduction to the island.

The Season 2 DVD set has two discs with four episodes each. That's 466 minutes of great mysteries, presented in 16.9 aspect ratio. English subtitles are available. There are no DVD extras, which is a crying shame, given the spell-binding history and culture of the real islands.

The episodes aren't given any names when you view them. And on the discs, they're just called Part One, Part Two, etc. In my episode synopsis, below, I've added the popular unofficial titles.

PART ONE: A Murder on the Plantation
The police are called out to the Seymour Plantation, established 1715. Roger Seymour, its 71 year-old scion, has been found in the original mill with a machete in his back. This place must have seen untold pain and misery in the days of slavery. Do you believe in psychic imprints? Retribution from beyond? Poole certainly doesn't, and he concentrates on the cast of disgruntled friends and family Roger had gathered on his porch for a big announcement.
In a side story, Camille is pressed by her lively mother to pay attention to Honor's week-long celebration of Erzulie, the Voodoo Goddess of Love.

PART TWO: An Unholy Death
Father John prepares to lead a service at the Convent of the Sacred Heart. But young Therese, a postulate, has not arrived. The Mother Superior goes to Therese's cell to get her, but finds the room engulfed in smoke. Therese has died from smoke inhalation. Father John tells Poole, ""It's a big transition to make. Giving up nearly all contact with the outside world. No possessions. No money. But the cigarettes. We knew it was a struggle for her. She always smoked when she was upset.""
They find Therese's hidden cigarettes, but they're a different brand from the case found on her bedside table. And that's not all that doesn't makes sense to Poole. It's another locked room mystery.

PART THREE: Death in the Clinic
A patient is found floating face down in the pool at an exclusive clinic specializing in cosmetic surgery. How exclusive? They are called to the scene by the Police Commissioner, dressed in a bathrobe. He was there for physical therapy for a sports injury. ""Absolute discretion"" is required, which is not Poole's strong suit.
Trivia: See if you can catch it. The autopsy report says the patient had water in her lungs. But in his grand denouement, Poole says she was dead before she was put in the pool. Both can't be true.

PART FOUR: A Deadly Curse
In 1563, the pirate Franois le Clerc (a real person) buried his booty from a captured Spanish frigate on St Marie. He never came back for it, and legend has it that it's still waiting to be discovered, protected by a curse. Not that a curse keeps out the treasure hunters. Poole is called out to the jungle campsite by the latest group to make the attempt. So far, one hunter was injured in a cave explosion. And one man has been shot through the heart with a flint-lock pistol. If it's not le Clerc, who is it?

PART FIVE: Murder Onboard
Camille is dressed to the nine's. She's on a party boat, supporting her close friend Aimee Fredericks. This is the ultra-talented Aimee's last performance before she heads to Miami and the record producer waiting for her. Right in the middle of her sultry song, Aimee collapses to the floor. She has been poisoned, but how? And how many jealousies can there be?
Trivia: Aimee is played by Jamelia, and that is her own beautiful voice, though we don't get to hear much of it.

PART SIX: A Dash of Sunshine
June Anderson, a freckled redhead on vacation with her husband and sister, is confined to a wheelchair after a car accident. She's alone in the hotel room when someone creeps up behind her and strangles her with her own scarf.
Poole is nearly pole-axed when he meets June's husband. Douglas Anderson is a Met police officer, and, as Poole tells Camille, ""one of my most objectionable colleagues.""
The prior episode's murder was personal for Camille. This murder is personal for Poole: ""That's just what bullies do, isn't it? They turn the pack against you by setting you apart from the group.""

PART SEVEN: A Stormy Occurrence
Hurricane Irma is approaching St Marie. At the meteorological center, five people divvy up duties at the 5 weather stations set up around the island. One of them, though, is killed before the hurricane even arrives. Poole doesn't understand why everyone wants to interrupt the murder investigation for just ""a little wind"".

PART EIGHT: A Deadly Party
Poole and Camille have been ordered to attend a reception fundraiser for the St Marie Marine Reserve. Schmooze. Make a good impression. Meet the movers and shakers. None of these come easily to Poole. But at least he's on hand when the host, the wealthy Mr. Powell, is shot in his study.
""No one can escape their past, can they?""

A highly recommended mystery series!
