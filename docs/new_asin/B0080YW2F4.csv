8523824,4,B0080YW2F4,"They call it modern traditional, but in reality it is a string walking video, which is why I bought it.  There are all kinds of traditional archery and any one of them could claim being modern.

1) A minor quibble is that possibly because Ty Pelfrey is largely know because of an earlier appearance in a Masters of the Barebow segment, they weren't or didn't feel free to have him overtly address issues that were in that tape, which are the basis of the whole technique.  Then some of it is covered in end scenes almost like outtakes.  A little odd.  On the other hand if you know him from MBB, well that stuff isn't duplicated all that much here, even if it might have helped.

2)  Slightly annoying is the attempt to make themselves seem a little more modern than is really necessary in items of dress and the bows they use.  Pelfrey is shown spray painting a 25 in. FITA rig for hunting.  Maybe he gets a new one every year, but if I used that bow for hunting it would be camo to start with and at least not bought in red.  And how many people really use a 25"" Olympic riser for hunting.  I hear he actually hunts a fair bit with longbows.  While a very minor point, they could have probably thrown a wider net in some ways.

3) This tape has been out for quite a while before I heard about it, and I am glad to have it in my collection, but, today there is as much good info on the internet for free, particularly if you have seen the MBB segment.  I am happy I got it however.",1483401600,,1482,4.136363636363637

8523826,1,B0080YW2F4,When my dvd arrived I immediately put it the player and to my surprise the audio was completely messed up...I played a few other movies to see if my player some how was messed up and they played fine...I won't be buying another video online again. This video was not cheap either...very dissapointed.,1456790400,,300,4.679245283018868
8523827,3,B0080YW2F4,Very Poor Sound Quality. The information was just Ok. A far better purchase is G. Fred Asbell's Instinctive Shooting DVD.,1389571200,,121,5.1
8523828,4,B0080YW2F4,"Although the contents may be affected by the bow makers and parts suppliers, there were good enough information for barebow archers.  I recommend this to every barebow archers.  The only pity is the quality of the video which may be took 20th century therefore the screen seems to be rather rough.",1372204800,,297,4.803921568627451
