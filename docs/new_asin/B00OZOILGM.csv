8685867,4,B00OZOILGM,"There is great confusion here regarding this product. I have tried to get the site to fix the errors but have been unsuccessful. Here is the issue: the same product number evidently cross-references both ""The Valentine's Day That Almost Wasn't"" (which I know nothing about) and ""RiffTrax Live: Birdemic."" I bought ""Birdemic,"" yet when I click on that in my order history it brings me to ""The Valentine's Day That Almost Wasn't"". What I am saying is be careful of what you're ordering, as I doubt there are two more dissimilar products available for your viewing pleasure.

If you happen to be interested in ""Birdemic,"" I was one of the lucky ones to get to see this live in the theater and have since watched the DVD; Mike, Kevin, and Bill once again do a great job ridiculing a hilariously horrible movie (I also recommend you watch the actual un-riffed film complete with commentary if you're so inclined.) There's also a short, ""Norman Checks In"" that RiffTrax fans will be certain to enjoy: it's just another ""bag of sadness that slowly deflates!""

Make sure you know what you are getting here. The ""Birdemic"" feature is worth five stars but given the confusion about what you're actually ordering I docked it a star to alert people to the issues involved, no slight to RiffTrax or ""Birdemic"" is implied in the four star rating.",1425686400,8,1332,4.737068965517241
