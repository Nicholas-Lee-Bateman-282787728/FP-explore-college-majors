I think everyone must have seen El Hazard alredy, so we will cut the chase for the plot.  If you haven't seen it, then don't expect to see some high flying action or mind killing drama/suspense, just sit back and enjoy this fun ride.",992908800,,355,4.446153846153846

713921,4,6303853226,"This is from my website...: (goes past the first tape) The Wanderers: El-Hazard is the watered down TV series of the original, El-Hazard. It all starts with Makoto, Fujisawa-sensei, Jinnai, and Nanami all having a normal day at the school festival. Fujisawa-sensei is a huge mountain climbing fanatic, Makoto is a science genius who's building a new invention at the time of the festival. Nanami is the money making genius who is selling bento box lunches to the people at the festival. And Jinnai...Jinnai is the sCaRy student council president that is EVIL. He hates Makoto! So everyone is getting ready to go home, Jinnai messed with the machine Makoto was working on, and they accidentally get sucked into magnificent world of El-Hazard!
In El-Hazard, a woman is running through the forest, trying to escape the fearsome Bugrom. A HUGE bug that looks like a robot. Fujisawa-sensei has suddenly gained super-human strength and fights it off. The woman running is Rune Venus, the princess of Roshtaria a ""realm"" in El-Hazard. At first Makoto and Fujisawa-sensei are thought to be spies...but later they gain the trust of the palace people.
To find a way back home to Earth, Makoto and Fujisawa gain a guide, Alielle who will take them to the 3 shrines of the Priestesses: Water, Wind, and Fire. The Priestesses can't help them... so they go back to Roshtaria. Jinnai somehow becomes a supreme leader of Bugrom, the city of the Bugroms. With Diva, the Queen, he goes psycho and keeps on trying to become the supreme ruler of El-Hazard... With Jinnai adding to the problems, they discover Ifurita... she's the Devil (oooh) Jinnai becomes her master (oh no!) but Ifurita is ditzy and really nice and doesn't understand what's happening. Suddenly Princess Rune Venus gets kidnapped by Jinnai...and problems start brewing. The Princess escapes, and Jinnai hatches the plan to use the ""God's Eye"" a huge circular object of a lot of power in the sky... Ifurita is used to control the God's Eye...and too bad she goes all evil and since she already started controlling the God's Eye, she can't stop...she must destroy EL-Hazard. The only people who can stop her are Makoto, who has the mark of the king, and Rune Venus who is the descendant of the king. Since Rune Venus is still in Bugrom trying to escape, will she get back in time???",984787200,,2330,4.842105263157895
713922,4,6303853226,"This is the third volume of El-Hazard, and in my opinion it surpasses the first two tapes.  The only thing really lacking earlier in the series was a sense of interest in the characters.  I enjoyed watching them, but I didn't really feel anything for them as people.
This tape makes you care.  It is also pivotal in that it introduces Ifurita, the ""Demon God"" with the big chest and the rather shocking penchant for destruction.  Jinnai manages to awaken her, and minutes later commands her to destroy the allied nations that are at war with the Bugrom.  This she begins to do, by hovering over a large city and obliterating it with a single energy blast.  After the lightheartedness of the first tapes, in which no one really got hurt, this was almost disturbing.  The drama melds well with the comedy, though, resulting in a series that covers all bases.  I highly recommend this tape to all anime fans.",980208000,,905,4.6125

714083,5,6303853226,"In 1999 I borrowed the entire Magnificent World series on video, I recently bought it on DVD and it rocks.
If all you want is to zone out and watch a comedy set in a fantasy world, this is the thing to watch, if your looking for something deep and involving without going into the depths of a series like Evangelion you got it all right here.
Hilarious, Sad and colourful it's a must watch, even if you don't like Tenchi Muyo SHOCK HORROR!!!(same director by the way) this is ten times better and well worth looking at.",1070409600,3,519,4.3061224489795915
714084,4,6303853226,"Plot: Makoto, a high school student, ends up in a basement room at his school where a mysterious woman awakens and tells him she's been waiting for him for a long time. Makoto has no idea what's going on as she uses the last of her strength to send him to another world, a world called El Hazard. Makoto's teacher Mr. Fujisawa, his friend Nanami and his rival Jinnai also get sent to El Hazard. Makoto is mistaken for the missing younger princess of the country, Fatora, and is talked into impersonating her (which in itself is very funny). The adventure continues from there.
My thoughts: Very, very funny. Has two of the funniest characters in anime, Mr Fujisawa and Jinnai (and one very funny platypus-ish-thing in the first episode). Mr. Fujisawa and his drinking/smoking is hysterical, as is Jinnai and his laughter (my favorite anime villain). Those two characters alone are worth watching El Hazard for, but they aren't the only good ones. There's also Shayla-Shayla, Allielle, Fatora, Nanami, Miz, all who are funny also. All around well done, 10 times better than the El Hazard TV series, ""The Wanderers"". I agree with the reviewer that mentioned the dub is good, Fujisawa and Jinnai especially well done.
I gave 4 stars instead of five because it is very funny, but there were a few parts in the last episodes that I thought dragged a little and weren't as funny as the rest of the series. To me there also didn't seem to be much depth or development to the characters. There's also that outfit Makoto wears that makes him look like a girl, it just bugged me.
Not for children, I would say 15-16 and up because of the drinking/smoking, a little nudity, and adult situations.",1037577600,7,1684,4.673400673400673
714085,5,6303853226,"I speak only of the first 2 discs in this collection.  The Magnificent World is flat out the best Anime I have ever seen.  The story follows Makoto and his friends as they are transported to another dimension to the world of El Hazard.  Makoto is asked to impersonate a kidnapped Princess, and gets roped into fighting the Bugrom, a race of giant bugs being led by his high-school nemesis Jinnai.  Their teacher Fujisawa steals the show by possessing superhuman strength only when he is sober!
This is a cross between Arabian Nights, Gor, La Jetee, with a science fiction overtone.  The humor is genuine, the characters are believable and well constructed, and the story is interesting, tight, and extremely romantic.
The third disc takes place after the end of the first part, and shows the characters trying to learn to jump between dimensions.  Fujisawa gets married, and another demon goddess rises to throw a monkey wrench in the works.  I thought this was a pale shadow of the first part, and is easily ignorable in this collection.",1031529600,,1038,4.797752808988764
714086,3,6303853226,"well this show is pretty good. El Hazard one (the first seven episodes) were alright but didn't greatly impress me, especially after all the great reviews on it. For about the first three episodes the pacing is really, really slow and almost downright boring, though it does start to pick up in the second half of the show. Some of it actually did make me laugh a little but not much.
The problem is with the fact that el hazard has a strange sense of humor that isn't for everyone. All the jokes seem to revolve around the main guy (Makoto) cross dressing and the two homosexual girls, the princess and her uh girlfriend. It's not that I'm homophobic or anything but throughout the series it was dependent on this fact to make it funny. Ummm ok. What really bothered me was that the princess' girlfriend can't be older than twelve while the princess herself looks to 19 or 20. EWWWW that's just sick. Yeah and a crossdressing male and all the hyjinks that ensue from it can only be funny for five or ten minutes tops. Rather in el hazard, the main guy sports his ladies wear for more than half the show.
There is also some romance that developes between a few characters and a love triangle surrounding Makoto though it isn't all that interesting. I mean there is nothing appealing about this guy at all. He's boring and dresses like a woman for half the show, what's to like. The only relationship that I did find just toooo cute was the one between the teacher Mr Fujisawa and the water priestess, I think her name was Mizu. They are just sooooooo sweet together. Awwwwwww :D. Anyway  I  did find the ending of El Hazard one very good and Shayla Shayla is really cool. I admired her strength.
I must also add that I loved El Hazard two (last four OAV episodes), way more than el hazard one. The pacing is fast and stays interesting till the end, probably cause it's shorter. The story has more action, more cute Fujisawa/Mizu moments, and jokes that are actually funny. I really have no idea what everyone has against this second series. It's actually interesting and Makoto stays a man for a majority of it.
All in all I'd say this series is not too bad. I liked it enough to buy the boxset, I just didn't like the first three episodes which were, as I said before, boring, and some of the humor made me cringe.  Other than that this is a good anime find with nice art and beautiful use of color.",1029542400,6,2400,4.413092550790068
714087,5,6303853226,"El Hazard is my favorite anime title?
Sailor Moon, Dragonball Z, Evangelion, Escaflowne, FLCL, Ranma, and Tenchi are all wonderful, but pound-for-pound (dollar-for-dollar), you can't beat El Hazard. There is more entertainment in the first 7 OAVs of El Hazard than in most SEASONS of other anime titles. It takes everything I like about anime and does it RIGHT. While it doesn't break any new ground, it is the most sucessful mixture of action, adventure, comedy, drama, and romance that I've ever seen.
Unlike Tenchi (which many compare it to), El Hazard has NO plotholes or last minute story changes. Like Tenchi, El Hazard has memorable characters (everyone loves Shayla-Shayla), great artwork and a ""just plain fun-to-watch"" aspect to it.
Also, while I don't usually like English dubs, the English dub of El Hazard is phenominally good! Yes, even better than the original Japanese. The voice-work of Jinnai and Fujisawa are especially brilliant.
Boxed sets can be expensive (I know, I own a LOT of them), but the El Hazard boxed set is hands down, the BEST purchase I've ever made on one. I guarentee you'll love it!",1029196800,5,1120,4.962765957446808
714088,5,6303853226,"El-Hazard is, in my opinion, one of the greatest animes ever. The plot is wonderful, the characters are fun, the voice work is great, and the art is fantastic. Just imagine as mildmannered high school student Makoto and his friends are transported to the world of El-Hazard and much hillarity and action and romance and adventure. Also there arn't really any holes in the plot or weird moments that kind of make you go, ""huh, that's not quite right,"" that you sometimes see in anime, except for a couple parts that are likely just a problem in translation. The first seven episodes are, beyond a doubt the best of the set as the box set includes the seven episodes of the origional OVA and the four episodes of OVA 2, and while OVA 2 is somewhat lack luster, and a lot of people don't like it, I enjoyed it greatly. And if you enjoyed the two OVAs you'll probably enjoy the Alternative World, which is a sort of sequal series that takes place shortly after the second OVA. But anyway, overall El-Hazard is a wonderful comical/adventurous romp that will delight viewers.",1028073600,,1069,4.602094240837697
714089,4,6303853226,"There is no doubt that the original ""El Hazard"" is one of the best of American released animes.  The comedy is raunchy and clever, the characters are funny and the story finds the touching human element in a wacky sex comedy.  Top notch all the way around.
""El Hazard 2"" loses the ""clever"" part and just focuses on the ""raunchy.""  It is not bad, but it is nowhere near the quality of the original.  Worth watching, but not really worth buying on it's own.
The boxset itself is the real showcase.  It is just so...pretty.  The artwork is outstanding, and the whole thing is a real presentation.  I am not usually sold by nice packaging, but this one did it for me.  A great series, and OK series wrapped up in a fabulous package.  Not perfect, but worth having.",1019520000,5,760,4.410071942446043
714090,4,6303853226,"I bought the boxed set out of curiousity and I was pleasantly surprised.
El Hazard has an excellent mix of slapstick humor, romance, adventure, in an involving storyline (not to mention the gorgeoous artwork)
The story revolves around Mizuhara Makoto (your typical, Japanese, high school boy which tips you off right away that he's in for it), his crazy rival Jinnai Katsuhiko, Katsuhiko's sister Jinnai Nanami, and their drunkard teacher Fujisawa Masamichi. They get transported from Japan to the world of El Hazard by Ifurita (a demon god although they don't know it at the time) and have all kinds of crazy adventures.
I wouldn't let any kids watch this, though. Like the Tenchi series (in its original form) it contains a lot of nudity and sexual innuendo (two of the characters are lesbians if you haven't gotten the point by now). At any rate, its a great buy for the true anime fan.",1017619200,,889,4.779220779220779
714091,5,6303853226,"I didn't know what to expect from this series other than the fact that the creators of Tenchi were involved.  I've since watched both OVAs a couple of times and have gotten a pretty good impression of them both.  For the most part, there's a good dose of humor to go with the adventure.  What got me is that in the first OVA, which is seven episodes long, the final two episodes wrapped things up in such a tender sentimental way that I quickly forgot about the humor and got caught up in wonderment.  It's an interesting ride (almost silly in parts).  There is a circular plot, but you just have to watch to understand it.  All the characters are likable and it's a fun series. (I like Makoto the most...he can be clueless, but he means well.)  The packaging is great: from the gatefold which holds the 3 DVDs to the included booklet with episode listings.  I like the fact that Pioneer kept the original Japanese opening and ending credits and left the translated English credits as an extra.  The editor mentions there are no extras, but there are a series of line art included, an outline of the different El Hazard ""worlds"", and non-credit openings and endings.  The first OVA has a 5.1 Dolby Digital Japanese soundtrack.  The second does not.  It's a bit pricey for the number of episodes, but I'm happy with my purchase.  Follow the advice of the other reviewers and make this your first El Hazard purchase or you'll probably get confused.",1013817600,,1446,4.558139534883721
714162,3,6303853226,"I'm actually very disappointed with El Hazard. I am an avid fan of Tenchi Muyo, and I thought that it would be in a very similar vein based on all the reviews, the comment in the official review about the director being the co-creator of Tenchi, and positive comments from other viewers. Despite this, very disappointed with the product and the content. On the product side, the first DVD won't play in my DVD-ROM. I don't know why, but out of hundreds of DVDs that I own, this is the only one which the drive won't recognise. (defective? I don't know). On the content side, I loved the setting, I thought the teacher, Efrita and the protective cat were cool. El Hazard as a world is pretty interesting. But the style of anime is very different to what I was led to believe. Makoto (the lead male) seems to spend most of his time cross-dressing with a lot of toilet humour going on (he needs to pee at inappropriate times and can't find a toilet). Jinne (the head villain) is hardly credible - he is used more for comedy value than for real menace. The bugrom also appear to be the major villain here, and aren't really credible. A lot of falling about and other silliness. The love triangle which develops is not crafted as well as the Tenchi/Ayeka/Ryouko triangle. The point is that this not Tenchi Muyo. Tenchi presented the action/adventure/drama as the primarily storyline, and comedy was used to lighten the story up. El Hazard is quite different. It is primarily a comedy. If this is your cup of tea -- cool. It's just not what I expected based on the other reviews. El Hazard is definitely worth watching. Just not worth buying unless you know that it is to your taste. (suggest rent first)
Oh -- one final thing -- a lot of the other reviewers said that El Hazard 2 wasn't as good as the original. I disagree. I actually found the sequel more interesting and entertaining than the original because there was less silliness and more action/adventure/drama.",1011744000,5,1964,4.582386363636363
714163,4,6303853226,"...well, i'm not about to explain where that punch line came from but you'll get to hear in the first 15 minutes. it sets the stage for lot's o' sophomoric humor that's definitely NOT for the younger teens. there are also mild explicatives throughout.
what it does illustrate, IMHO, is how well jokes were written for the English version. there're a lot of over-the-top humor in El Hazard that have been adapted well into colloquial English plus the voice acting is quite good.
as noted by other reviewers, this DVD boxset contains the excellent OAV, El Hazard - the Alternate World and the fair made-for-TV series, EL Hazard2 - the Wanderers.
you'll notice right away that the OAV (disk 1&2) has consistantly good animation throughout while the TV series' (disk 3)animation goes from good to average. the story in the OAV is much tighter and centers around a highschool freshman, Makoto. he along with his teacher and two schoolmates, upon discovering ancient ruins underneath, of all places, their school, promptly gets transported to the land of El Hazard. once there, they are asked to help save the land of El Hazard from the opposing Bugrom forces -- needless to say, this involves the usual cross dressing, new found super powers, meeting alternate lifestyles and, of course, brief nudity.
the TV series picks up right after the OAV and deals with a search for Makoto's teacher and running into another force that could destroy El Hazard and the resurgence of the Bugrom forces.
El Hazard is pretty unique, though the best way for me to describe it is that the story is more 'Tenchi' while the jokes more 'Ranma 1/2'... but very funny.
yeah, this boxset isn't cheap but if you've had a chance to see it, you'd be exempt from 'Fujisawa's Fists of Justice'!!!",1011744000,,1764,4.805921052631579
714164,5,6303853226,"For as long as I've been a fan of anime, I've been a fan of El Hazard. As soon as I saw the first episode of the first series, I was hooked as a fan for life. I've waited a long, long time for this to come to DVD, and now that it has, I'm in anime heaven. This anime is not one of the more well-known series in the anime world, and that is a terrible shame, but one that is definitey worth giving a try. This DVD set contains the first two OAV's (Magnificent World and Magnificent World 2). The Magnificent World (first OAV, and first 7 eps.) is by far the greatest anime I've ever witnessed. It has everything I could ever want in an anime. I enjoyed every second of the series.
From the animators of Tenchi, this anime centers around the adventures of Makoto and his friends. In short, Makoto and a few friends (and one enemy) get transported from their high school to the world of El Hazard. Once there, Makoto and co. are assigned with the task of saving El Hazard (no pressure there!) from the evil Bugroms. Filled with great humour, adventure, romance, action, a great story, wonderful characters, good animation, nudity, and lesbian themes, this has something for everyone. I especially loved the ending, it was original.
There is a Tenchi-esque feel to this series, so if you like Tenchi, you'll love this. Makoto (similar to Tenchi) is surrounded by beautiful and powerful women, and is the love interest of many of them (sound familiar). But, this anime is NOTHING like Tenchi, don't think that's what I'm saying. I personally think it far surpasses what Tenchi was able to do. The animation is stunning, some of the best I've ever seen. And the animators really did a wonderful job at the backgrounds and scenery of El Hazard (beautiful, just beautiful). But it's the characters that make El Hazard a true classic. This is one of the better cast of characters I've ever seen (Nanami is a bit annoying and pointless, but you can get past her). BTW, you'll love Shayla-Shayla....she's da bomb (and my favourite)! Each character has many things to love about each of them.
The only problems I have with this anime are: 1) it's too short. The first OAV is only 7 episodes (although they do pack a lot into the series) and the second OAV is 4 episodes. 2) The second OAV isn't nearly as good as the first, it's definitely not the continuation I would have liked after watching the first series. It's still good, but when compared to the first, it doesn't stack up. But, you can easily get past these, because the first OAV is worth every second you invest watching it.
After watching these series, if you like it, be sure to check out the conclusion to this series in ""El Hazard: The Alternative World."" It's a great series as well, and a descent conclusion. And for an alternative telling to ""El Hazard: The Magnificent World"" check out ""El Hazard: The Wanderers."" It's not a continuation of the other three series, but simply an alternative telling (and some good changes are made in this telling).
All in all, El Hazard is a truly wonderful series with great characters and beautiful animation. It has something for everyone, and I personally feel that everyone that watches it will truly enjoy it. Do yourself a favour and check this one out, you won't be disappointed if you do.  Oh yes, be sure to watch this DUBBED (yes you heard me, the dubbed version).  It's actually better than the subbed, yes better.  The voices are just perfectly picked for each character.  It is one of only a select group of animes that are wonderful no matter how you watch.",1009756800,4,3564,4.546728971962617
714165,5,6303853226,"Romantic story featuring life long rivalry between two guys, Motoko and Jinai.  Motoko is a golden boy who has brains, looks, honor, sanity and a pleasant personality.  Jinai has none of this, but makes up for it with ambition.  The two, along with a couple other people get transported to another world, El Hazard,  and continue their rivarly.
ElHazard is a place that is like earth, but with differences like:
* beautiful powerful priestesses who maintain order
* a medeival society built after the collapse of a advanced civilization.
* A race of intelligent insects known as bugrom trying to take over.
The character development that occurs as the characters try to adjust to their new world is what makes this series work.  Lots of unpredictable relationships as well (It's not clear from the start if any of the goddesses will fall in love with any of the characters, and if so will that love be returned).
Technically it's pretty good.  The animation style has a surreal magical feel to it.  The magical feeling is similar to the organic feeling one finds in the Tenchi Muyo OVA series.  Sound track very good as well.  Not many DVD extras though.
This DVD Box set presents good value in that it contains both the original series and it's sequel.  Does not contain the third ""El hazard Alternative World"" or ""Wanderers"" kid friendly TV re-write of the story.  But, as with Tenchi, the original series is the best.
Caution:  Some naughtiness in two ""playfully lesbian"" characters.  Lots of jokes about sex, but nothing really happens.  Not suitable for little kids though.",1007856000,2,1578,4.83955223880597
714166,5,6303853226,"Pay no heed to the heathens who would dare to say this series is anything but the best.  If you love anime, and you love beautifully done anime then this is definitely the series for you.
This series ranks right along with Tenchi Muyo as being a very creative, very well drawn and beautiful series.  It is also hilarious!  The jokes are great and timed perfectly.  Although I must caution that the content of the series is definitely of a PG-13 to R rating, don't buy this for your kids if you aren't cool with that.
The basic plot of this series (if you have never seen it before I am trying to write this so not too much of anything is given away) is a group of ordinary people from Shinanomi High School in Japan get transported to a far and distant world called El Hazard.  Upon arrival we find a young boy who gets thrust into the ""hero"" spot of the series, and his teacher, who is sort of a cross between comic relief, and a sidekick.  Then there is his rival, and evil bastard of a high school student who happens to hate the ""hero,"" so he teams up with the Bugrum, a group of large humanoid bugs that can talk.  And we find a few more people get sucked into the world as well, as an added bonus they all get super powers upon entering the world.  The teacher becomes super fast and strong, and the evil bastard gets the power to communicate with the Bugrum and so on.
The world is in the middle of a power struggle between the Bugrum, and the alliance of nations against them.  We also learn that these nations have had wars with each other and everyone else frequently in the past, and have developed some pretty nasty weapons, including a demon or two.
Over all this is a great series, and one most any anime fan will love to own,  enjoy!",1006560000,2,1748,4.2379518072289155

714169,4,6303853226,"El-Hazard, next to Tenchi, is the most enduring series AIC has put out and this boxset is the first time that the original OVA (i.e. direct-to-video) series has been available in DVD format in the US.  However, also like the Tenchi Muyo phenomenon, none of the sequels, follow-ups, and 'reimaginings' have had the same impact as the original.
In a nutshell, El-Hazard is the story of a high school student who, along with two classmates and a teacher, get transported to another world across space, time and possibly dimensions.  The prevent one war between two races on the planet they arrive at, cause another and ultimately find themselves intimately involved with a doomsday device from that planet's distant past.  This is an incredibly synoptic description of the series, but to get acrosss the full nuances of the series, I could write for pages.  Needless to say, though, that the story itself has far more humor, adventure, romance and generally neat storytelling than my description implies.
As for the DVD set itself, though, Pioneer has missed a few great opportunities here.  While the addition of a 5.1 Dolby track is excellent (the difference is noticeable even on my archaic TV), the other extras leave a bit to be desired.  There's an art gallery, creditless openings and endings and an explanation of all the different worlds across which the El-Hazard metaseries takes place.  It's all pretty standard stuff.  No 'making-of' section, no look at the development process, no original trailers, and no interviews with the creator, producer, etc. - in other words, none of what really makes special DVD editions shine.

While the packaging is gorgeous, the sound great and the video everything you'd expect from a DVD, I honestly wouldn't recommend picking it up unless you (a) have a system that will do serious justice to the extra quality, (b) don't have the original OAV on tape or laserdisc or (c) for some reason really like El-Hazard 2 - in which case you'd be getting a decent deal.  Serious otaku will probably disregard this advice, but serious otaku will have probably already long-since ordered the set before reading this review anyway.  So, in short, the series is, as always, wonderful, but Pioneer really could have done a better job with this DVD release.  Perhaps someday they'll rerelease it on DVD at a lower price with more bells and whistles...",997142400,17,2385,4.949874686716792
714170,4,6303853226,"Years ago, I discovered an amazing Anime called El Hazard. At the time, it was only available on VHS, and I only saw it dubbed in English. Despite the format and language, I *loved* it. the characters were vivid and loveable, the scenery was beautiful. I hoped and wished that it would be available soon on on DVD. Now I hear that that day is finally coming.  While I have heard that the second series is a dissapointment when compared to the first, this DVD set will be worth it just to get the first.",995846400,,502,4.28421052631579

7853581,5,6303853226,"These have been out of print for years and the US editions currently cost around $200. It's nice to find the imported version going for a reasonable price.

This has all of the Magnificent World 1 & 2, which is a light hearted comic anime series. It was popular enough to spawn two other series: El-Hazard The Alternative World and El-Hazard The Wanderers; but it's Magnificent World that started it all.

This version is an imported edition, so don't expect the fancy box or slip covers that came with the US version, but the content inside on the discs is the same. This is all 11 episodes from Magnificent World 1 & 2. (1 was 7, 2 was 4)",1310860800,,640,4.369747899159663
7853582,4,6303853226,"""El-Hazard: The Magnificent World"" is an anime very much in the ""Tenchi Muyo!"" mold: a romantic comedy/adventure in which blank-slate protagonist Makoto is thrust into a sci-fi scenario and gets to play hero while being chased by multiple women. Though the characters in ""El-Hazard"" aren't developed as deeply as the ""Tenchi"" crew and the show occasionally suffers from awkward pacing, ""El-Hazard"" has a charm all it own. The mysterious antiheroine Ifurita is compelling, and the kids' hard-drinking teacher Fujisawa is consistently funny. Most impressively, ""El-Hazard"" tells a complete and satisfying story, tying up its seeming plot holes with an ingenious last-episode twist. Usually these types of shows start strong, only to end up limping through anticlimaxes and false endings. Even the romantic tension is unambiguously resolved!

The dub is also pretty darn good, though it tends to get overly shouty, especially in the segments centering on Jinnai. Can't the guy ever just speak in a normal tone?

""El-Hazard"" is hardly the type of show that will change your life, but if you like ""Tenchi"" or other anime in this vein, this box set is probably a good bet. (The set actually contains two separate shows: the original ""El-Hazard"" OAV and its 4-episode sequel ""El-Hazard 2."" The sequel is an inconsequential side story that unfortunately doesn't really add any value.)",1145318400,3,1376,5.2785388127853885
7853583,2,6303853226,"I purchased my version of El Hazard from a zShop for 19 bucks and I am SO glad that I did.

That said, the first series is worth watching for two main reasons: overt lesbianism and Jinnai. The former is self-explanatory while the latter (Jinnai) is without a doubt the best character in the series (despite the fact that he is the antagonist). You can't say that any of the characters are very deep or well developed, but throughout the first series Jennai is by far the most satisfyingly fleshed-out character, as well as the most ammusing and true to his nature. This superiority is all the more appearant when he is contrasted with story's main character who is shallowly developed and in no way engaging.

And this is what makes the second series (all four dismal episodes) so tragic: they nerfed Jinnai. He could never have been called a genius in the first series, but he was decidedly intelligent, cool, pragmatic, supremely self-confident and an effective leader (even though he was also manic and delusional). In El Hazard II, as if in response to the world recoiling at the sight of a humorous though competent villain, they have turned Jinnai into a slapstick-idiot persuing his increasingly nebulous ambition with foolish abandon.

I suggest purchasing El Hazard through...alternate means,... watching the first series and discarding the second. Let's face it: even lesbian humor gets old when the writing sucks and the characters are empty.",1131667200,5,1453,4.94672131147541
7853584,5,6303853226,"Being a big fan of anime comedy (the intelligent, yet lame humor) I was eager to see El Hazard ""The magnificent world"". Because of the high price of the set, I had some hesitation (because of some poor reviews on Amazon).

Well, I have to say that the bad reviews are wrong. This DVD series was totally awesome (although I admit it started a bit slow). I promise the more you keep watching, the better it gets. The plot is highly intelligent (involving dimensional and time travel) and the characters are very interesting (with distinctive special powers).

Some say the humor in El Hazard is juvenile (but I would argue no more juvenile then southpark), and seriously what good comedy isn't juvenile?

Some also say that the story is sometimes too redundant (because many episodes involve a doomsday device), to which I respond ""Do we call the original starwars trilogy redundant because they involve the death star""? no, ofcourse not.

yes this DVD set lacks some extras, but I think Pioneer did a great job. The DVD menu presentation is beautiful, and the box is very elegant too. Hopefully you can get this set for around 40 dollars on Ebay (beware of bootlegs). It's very hard to find a good authentic set. The sequel ""alternative world"" which I just ordered, individually should cost around 30 dollars if you shop smart.

For my fellow anime comedy fans, I also reccomend ""Niea under 7"" and ""His and Her Circumstances"".
