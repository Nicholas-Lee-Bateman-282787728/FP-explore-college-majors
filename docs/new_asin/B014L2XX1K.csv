7414149,5,B014L2XX1K,"This arrived this morning and as soon as it came to my door it was time to enjoy this concert video. The music was wonderful, great sound, the visuals were also great - if you have been to a Blue October concert you know it is quite an experience - and this disc really captured not only Justin but the whole band in their moments on stage. The camera angles were great, they showed the audience being excited, and at the very end there is a little audio spoiler of a new song coming out on their new album in 2016 with a nice montage of the bands new babies and families. If you feel like you are a part of the ""Blue Family"" this is a must have for your collection.",1448064000,5,666,4.053030303030303

7414205,5,B014L2XX1K,"Well what can you say about the perfect DVD ? It is simply perfect - Ok no 5.1 surround but who needs that when you have the quality of songs and performance . Not sure if its just me but these songs move me to tears  ( they are that good).I have never been through a brutal marrige break up or ever taken drugs, or married twice, but the songs on this DVD talk to me. Fear, Light me up, getting over it , worry list, and I'm not Broken anymore are truly as good as it gets - sound quality is a ten. The band and vocals are nothing short of brilliant - The only question I have is .... Why are this not band huge?  I don't get it! - Without doubt the best live DVD you will ever buy - A fans dream!",1450569600,,698,3.7739726027397262
7414212,5,B014L2XX1K,"These guys are just absolutely amazing! So much passion, style, energy, artistic ability, etc. etc. etc. This set is a must buy for any Blue October fan.
Now for the downside...the Blu-ray disk is only in 2-channel stereo (the DVD might be too). Why???????? The sound was a bit of a letdown when watching it in my movie room.",1450310400,,325,4.52542372881356
7414213,5,B014L2XX1K,"Blue October puts on the best show I've ever seen. Watching this DVD was almost as good as seeing them live. If you haven't been to a live show you are truly missing out. It's impossible to pick a favorite performance on here, but X amount of words was outstanding and I don't care who you are, Light You Up never gets old. The passion Blue October puts in every show is like nothing you've ever experienced. If I could give this DVD 1000 stars I would!",1449619200,,453,4.218390804597701

7414215,5,B014L2XX1K,"Phenomenal band, great live album!!!  In today's world of music, this band continues to be heads and shoulders above anything else that is currently played on any radio station.  Buy this album and thank me later. Buy their old albums and see what the big deal is about!",1449446400,,270,4.604166666666667
7414216,5,B014L2XX1K,"Huge Blue October fan here... The filming and songs and performing blew me away from the very opening, almost as much as seeing them live has done. This band is unparalleled. If you aren't yet a fan, you are missing out on something that doesn't come around but once...in a lifetime. Do not deprive yourself any longer! I have goosebumps that wine ever go away. Legend.",1449273600,,369,4.606060606060606
7414217,5,B014L2XX1K,I bought the Blu-Ray from their site and am now buying the digital version from Amazon so I can slowly introduce it to friends and family while on the go this holiday season.  From the moment the video started I knew it was going to be a passionate ride with Justin and the band.  Words can't describe how happy listening to their music makes me!,1449187200,,346,4.3076923076923075
7414218,5,B014L2XX1K,LOVE IT! only wish the DVD stated where each song was filmed at the beginning of each song. I've seen them so many times in Houston and one unbelievable show in Austin at Stubbs where we got the pleasure of meeting these amazing men. Fell in love with them at Sam Houston Race Park summer series in Houston years ago. Came to tears in fact. At that point had only heard a few songs but seeing that show and the intensity of Justin's emotions literally brought me to tears. Have LOVED them ever since. Introduced them to my son years ago and now we share the bond of loving them together. He's 12 now. They are real. No bulls***. I appreciate that & is an uncommon trait nowadays. Yes some lyrics are hard to swallow but life is hard to swallow at times. I love that Justin has grown into a respectable man and loves his life now. I pray that we could all improve our lives like he has... It's possible. With faith and love for each other. Peace! ,1449100800,3,946,4.2555555555555555
7414219,5,B014L2XX1K,Seriously the most incredible live shows you will ever see emotional/performance wise...Justin really captivates his audience and its no wonder they have such a die hard fan base...its deserved...the whole band is on top of their game here and the best part is that these guys are all just as nice as they are talented which is hard to come by in this industry. Purchase the live CD AND the live DVD!!!,1449014400,,402,4.597222222222222
7414220,5,B014L2XX1K,"Incredible concert quality and footage; everything anyone who has ever seen this band live would expect.  Was a little bit disappointed in the lack of bonus footage, however.  Argue with a Tree gave so much of it, and TWDaN was billed as a concert/documentary, that I expected to see a lot more off-stage footage than what was given.  Still, a truly great concert performance, though.",1448841600,,384,4.876923076923077
7414221,5,B014L2XX1K,Saw them last night in houston and left with a copy of this. Amazing band.,1448755200,,74,4.0
7414242,5,B014L2XX1K,"I highly recommend this live DVD/Blu-ray combo. Fantastic audio and video quality and great camera work.

LOVE THESE GUYS!",1448582400,,29,5.0
7414244,5,B014L2XX1K,"After watching this once, I was comfortable giving it 5 stars. Repeated viewings have only confirmed it! Blue October is such a great live band, it is hard to go wrong with a live recording of them.  The Amazon page and even Blue October's promotional info online do not make it clear that this comes with BOTH blue ray and DVD discs.  They are identical in content and have only the concert and song selection. Absolutely no extras.  Surprisingly, neither the blue ray or DVD have dolby or DTS 5.1 sound, just stereo, but the sound was just fine to my ears, even on my 5.1 system. Good mix and balance between all the instruments and vocals.  Video is likewise well done. The cuts aren't overly short and audience shots are minimal (a big improvement over Argue With A Tree which had way too many audience shots in my opinion!).  My only criticism would be that the stage is kept pretty dark and the lighting can get a little too strobe-like for my tastes.

As for the concert itself, it's great.  All the songs are from their last 4 albums, with Sway songs obviously factoring heavily. They all sounded super in live form, better than on the album, really.  That's what is so great about this band, their songs really come alive in concert.  Though the arrangements are similar to the album versions, the energy and impact is so much better live. Most of that could probably be credited to Justin's dynamic and heartfelt performance style. The other members are pretty low key performers by comparison, which is perfectly fine for this band. They all play their parts with passion and professionalism. If you are uninitiated to Blue October live, don't make the mistake of watching it around young children, because there is lots and lots of profanity.

So, if you like Blue October and are considering getting this, don't hesitate.  You'll love it!",1448582400,10,1851,4.682098765432099
7414245,5,B014L2XX1K,"In May of 2015 I had a chance to see them in Minniapolis, MN. I even had meet and greet passes, but at the last moment I had to cancle out because of financial reasons. Theres not a day that goes by that I don't kick myself for it. This DVD almost makes up for it. I love Blue October and this is a beautiful, powerful and touching DVD.
