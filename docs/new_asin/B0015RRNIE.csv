8259749,4,B0015RRNIE,"I've read a lot of ""meh"" and negative things about the Denise Druce line of workout DVDs, but actually, the ones I've tried are really not so bad (I didn't try the ones that got socked by Amazon reviewers).

This one is really rather good. The instructor, who is not Denise (who is herself perfectly good in Fit Dance Jam, despite the misleading title), is very competent, cheery and fun to work out with. I got a 35-minute or so intermediate workout composed of kickboxing combinations, about three, broken down and added on. Basic punches, kicks and knee raises are mixed together with basic hi-lo moves. If you love cardio kickboxing, this for the price is certainly worth considering.

I'm wondering if the Druce collection is stronger on basic step, hi-lo and kickboxing workouts and maybe not so much on the ""specialized"" workouts like bellydancing or salsa.",1306886400,4,864,4.870748299319728
