8282652,4,B00008VXXL,"It is a 'light' movie, made without a large budget, but it is an enjoyable movie.
It has humour, drama, romance, and even a song, or two.
The acting and the singing, from the principal actors, is quite believable.
Of course, I am a little biased, as half of this movie was filmed in my 'home' town. G.",1446076800,,301,4.206896551724138
