1730555,5,B0000694ZS,"This is an excellent christmas time story for all lovers of winnie pooh and friends, young and old alike! Its a story that can, and probably will be, watched again and again. There are two interactive games for younger children which should keep them occupied for an hour or two. My children aren't ""fans"" of winne pooh but have watched this over and over. good value for money!!",1070928000,12,379,4.588235294117647
1730556,5,B0000694ZS,I brought this movie out for this christmas since my daughtor this year is 18 months I knew she would like this movie. I love christmas so every October call me crazy but I bring out the christmas dvd's and music. I figure heck I start my christmas shopping in august gives me the spirit with out all that last minute stress. So I put this on for my 18 month old and immediately it became her favorite movie she makes us play it over and over again sometimes even when she wakes up in middle of the night she just wants us to play it cause we have a dvd in the bedroom on laptop that has happened twice. Her daddy though is quit sick of this movie now and it is not christmas he says it goes away the day after christmas. The two of us can recite the whole story now lol! It is a must have though for your little ones and you will enjoy it to the first few times once a year lol..She loves to dance to the cute songs they sing. Put ti this way I have never been a pooh fan ever and even told my mom that my kids will never have any winnie the pooh things. Cause all my friends kids had everything pooh bear it made me sick and I was the last to have my daughtor and all her stuff was preciose moments. This movie made even me a fan of the pooh clan. Buy this dvd you will not regret it is a wonderful holiday movie to enjoy with your kids!,1067472000,16,1339,3.8905109489051095

1730580,4,B0000694ZS,"Leave a comment if you have any questions and I can either take some photos or give more details.

This is a good seasonal Movie for the little ones. Especially if you can't take watching Frosty or Rudolf for the 246th time.

My 3.5 year old lost interest pretty quickly and only watched this mybe 3 times. I think she's honestly starting to grow out of the Winnie the Pooh phase and that it's nothing to do with the movie itself.

As far as seasonal movies go this is a decent one and I'm sure we'll probably watch it again next year when she's 4.

I always like to buy the DVD/blu-ray/digital download whenever possible. This lets me load a copy onto my phone, leave a copy at home and leave a DVD version at the grandparents house.

Another tip is with the Disney digital downloads, when you register the digital download you get points. With those points sometimes you can use them to get other movies too. Those sales don't always come around though. I save my points until they do.

All in all I'm glad I purchased this even though my 3.5 year old might not be too interested we have another little one on the way and I'm sure she'll enjoy it too.",1485043200,2,1153,4.314814814814815

1730600,5,B0000694ZS,"A Very Merry Pooh Year is one of my all-time favorite multi-holiday classics, alongside Seasons of Giving. This one here is even on Blu-ray, and thankfully remains in its original Fullscreen format! As Seasons of Giving contains A Winnie the Pooh Thanksgiving, A Very Merry Pooh Year contains Winnie the Pooh and Christmas Too, only digitally remastered to blend Rabbit's fur in with the rest of the movie, as with Christopher Robin's accent, in a similar manner to how Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree was seen with The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh! As for the New Year's story, you won't believe what Pooh, Piglet, Eeyore, and Tigger's New Year's resolutions are, to keep Rabbit from moving away due to their antics; Pooh being gloomy from no honey, Eeyore being so happy he makes a literal ""you-know-what"" of himself, Tigger being a scaredy-cat, and Piglet being bouncy! ""Share the spirit of Christmas and New Year's with the ones you love"" this holiday season with Winnie the Pooh: A Very Merry Pooh Year, especially with its own 15th anniversary next November, and the 25th of Christmas Too this year, which was the series finale to the New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh! Strangely, this is one of a few Pooh home video releases that aren't in the Disney Vault, as of 2016, so go ahead and get yours today, unless you've already done so a long time ago!",1479081600,5,1366,4.695833333333334

1730697,1,B0000694ZS,"My boyfriend Dave and I have a very particular taste in movies we enjoy together. Oftentimes, when we become aware of a certain movie through chatter on the Internet or Darknet, we will go to pretty extreme lengths to obtain that movie.
Most of the time, we will drive south of the border to Tijuana, but once in a while, we fly over to Germany for a few days to pick up a movie. For the most part, those trips go without a hitch and are quite enjoyable for Dave and me.
For one such movie, I was gone for two months overseas to pick it up. Dave was unable to go on that trip being tied down (heh) with his upcoming show prep for ""The Many Faces of Joan Rivers (RIP)"". Originally, I was just going to Germany to pick up the movie. However, I was tipped off to another very interesting by the the title alone in Indonesia. Without delay, I went in search of that movie. Since Dave was busy, I knew I only had seventy-two hours to work with before the movies would be lost forever. Basically, that's how it works in the industry. You have to move quickly.
Travelling by air, boat, bus, scooter and ultimately by foot into the dark underground market in search of the tip I received, I had finally reached my destination of the partially indoor market with the contact I was told about. It was a small fish shop/ mid-nineties electronics and sundry goods. When I asked the boy chopping fish behind the counter about the movie, he pointed to the doorway behind him.
Walking towards that door was the last thing I remembered.
When I came to, my mouth was gagged, both my feet and hands were bound by wire to a chair in only my white underwear and feet was ankle deep within a tub of water with jump starter cables lying nearby.  Normally, I am alright with that sort of situation, but this was a bit too unfamiliar to me not knowing where I was. Besides, I was wishing I had put on a fresh pair before I entered the country, if I was still in fact within that country. To this day, I really never knew where I was.
One of the three guys in broken English began to inquire why I was there in between slapping my face, I hesitated as to whether I should answer him immediately or not. After all, I was enjoying his face slapping. After about an hour, I tired of his shtick and answered his question.
I was here in search of ""Winnie the Pooh: A Very Merry Pooh Year"".
Then, there was silence in the room as they quietly exited.
Some time had passed as I had nodded off while sitting in the chair when I woke up to the three gentlemen standing in front of me. One of them handed me the movie I had come for while another gently covered my mouth with a smelly rag. That was the last I ever saw of them or that room.
I have no idea exactly how much time I had passed since that room, but I awoke on a ship that eventually dropped me off shore along the coast of Washington state.  The water was cold, but I was glad to be alive as I swam to the coast with only a backpack.  While resting on the shore, I opened the backpack to see the movie in it. My trip had been worth it and Dave would be thrilled to see me again.
That in itself would have been a great adventure. With all great tales, there is a twist. The twist ended up being this movie in hand was actually a Disney cartoon.  Usually, that stuff is ""code"" for something else, but in fact, the movie was just that.

1730730,2,B0000694ZS,"I remember watching this every year as a child when it came on ABC around Christmas. Maybe the older and younger generations won't remember, but any kid who grew up on The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh will know that they re-dubbed Christopher Robin's voice so he would sound like a British child and changed aspects of the movie so that it is unrecognizable to me. There are scenes added that were never in the original, such as the opening sequence, with obviously different voice actors and animation. I compared the original (found on youtube) to this version of the movie and they have cut many moments in the original to make room for the new, unnecessary scenes. They also cut much of the original music and replaced it with a non-emotional score. For me this is a HUGE part of what makes this a nostalgic movie.  Don't waste your money on this sad cut and paste movie. I recommend watching the full ORIGINAL version on youtube titled ""Winnie the Pooh and Christmas Too"".

The second half of this DVD is incredibly disturbing for different reasons. Pooh, Tigger, Piglet and Eeyore make resolutions to change their behavior because Rabbit doesn't like the way they are and threatens to move from the hundred-acre wood. So Tigger and Piglet switch behaviors, and Pooh and Eeyore switch behaviors. Pooh becomes a depressed mess and Eeyore becomes a smiling, red shirt-wearing weirdo. It's honestly just disturbing and really creepy. And the moral is just ridiculous. The animation is sub-par as well as the story.

1730734,4,B0000694ZS,"This gentle, low-key production is a welcome relief from the sometimes frantic, high-speed fare that kids seems to dial up this time of year. Its not really a full-length feature, but actually an edited combination of the 1991 TV special, Winnie the Pooh and Christmas Too.

It was a by-product of the Emmy award-winning series, The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh. Paul Winchell is the voice of Tigger in this portion, which was animated in Taiwan.

From Walt Disney Animation France come Happy Pooh Year and A Very Merry Pooh Year. The overall quality of the production is so consistently high that its difficult to tell the segments apart except that there is an episodic feel to the story  but thats generally the case with any extended Pooh feature.

The talented songwriters Michael and Patty Silversher, who wrote a good many memorable tunes for Disney cartoon series and Disney records, contribute original songs. Carly Simon makes her Pooh debut with her wonderfully warm rendition of the classic Sherman Winnie the Pooh theme.

Some of the animation is pretty much what you might expect of the high-end TV variety, but other moments have downright theatrical quality.

One example is the scene in which Christopher Robin reads his Santa letter to his friends. Its not only flowing, its all in character.

And theres even a tangible connection to all the bother in the story about letters to Santy Included with the package are two glossy wish cards with a little Pooh pen for kids to fill out and mail with the envelopes and stickers provided. A nice touch.

Other Extras (on both the DVD and Blu-ray):
 Disneys Song Selection
 Sing Along with the Movie
 Enchanted Environment (This is a cozy Christmas living room with a fireplace that you can leave on as you enjoy the holidays, much like those video logs)

This Christmas movie is warm-hearted and educational.  The lessons are good and we see them reflected in the behavior of our household young ones.  We are a three generation household of 11 and even the adults can be found humming the theme song.  A nice addition to our movie collection.,1278028800,,414,4.394736842105263

It's so hard to find media for very young ones that don't include a wicked character, even amidst Disney classics -- not something I really want my grandchildren to see until they're old enough to discuss such character...  Winnie the Pooh is awesome, and this little movie is no exception...  It's brim full of appreciating friendship and close relationships far over presents, and even innately crabby Rabbit is easily moved to a sweet and tender heart...  Very amusing when they all exchanged personas...  Love this and highly recommend it for little ones...  The special features offered on this DVD are awesome, too...",1250121600,,654,5.065420560747664

1730814,5,B0000694ZS,"Actually, more like New Year's and Christmas, as that's what this DVD features.

The story begins with an opening segment in which Pooh Bear hides a present he has for Piglet. Then our friends gather together and tell little Roo about a past Christmas. This segment comes from the special ""Winnie the Pooh and Christmas Too,"" featuring the characters from ""The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh."" Pooh and his friends are getting ready for Christmas. They decide to make a Christmas list and come up with all sorts of gifts that they want to give each other. But when the list is lost to the wind, Pooh and Piglet decide to dress up as Santa and a reindeer and make gifts.

Later, they recall a New Year's in which Rabbit wanted to move away because he was irritated Pooh's eating honey, Tigger's bouncing, Piglet's being afraid and Eeyore's gloominess. So they all made resolutions to change and swapped personalities.

One reason this production is neat is that it has Gopher in it --- he really isn't seen too much lately.

This movie features songs by Carly Simon (who also did the songs for the more recent ""Piglet's Big Movie"" and ""Heffalump Movie"") as well as by the characters. She does a great job, as always. The best is ""Auld Lang Syne"" (with Pooh-specific lyrics mixed in.) This is great, because you don't usually get to hear lyrics for this song these days, only the tune.

DVD special features include a ""Covered in Snow"" game, a ""New Year's Eve"" countdown and song selection with on-screen lyrics. These features aren't anything overly exciting, but they are fairly nice. The ""Covered in Snow"" game is a bit flawed in that you're supposed to choose objects, but it lets you choose the same ones over and over and doesn't progress the game any. Otherwise, good game. You can also put the DVD in your DVD-ROM drive (if you have one) to register it.",1136160000,30,1862,4.63030303030303
1730815,4,B0000694ZS,"A good Holiday movie with all the usual cast. I watched this movie this morning with my nephew to introduce him to the Holiday *this is his first* and I enjoyed it as much as he seemed to! My only small complaint is that when they go into different part's of the story (ie the new year celebration) it seemed a little arkward. Other then that, two thumbs up.

I hope that this will become a holiday tradition.",1101686400,7,409,4.243589743589744
