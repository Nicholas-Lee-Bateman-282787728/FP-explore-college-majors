8395477,5,B003EGWJBK,"Angelena Craig's chair-based yoga DVD is appropriate for all skill levels regardless of physical strengths and limitations. Angelena is skilled, knowledgeable, experienced, and able to explain details essential for beginners learning yoga poses. She provides precise, safe, and effective instruction.",1408838400,,300,6.525
8395478,5,B003EGWJBK,"Angelena makes a specific effort to help a person with limitations move and stretch and do what they can do with this instructional dvd.  I happen to have bad knees and had been looking for a video like this one. I am enjoying using it and will recommend it to friends, as well!",1351036800,,278,4.245283018867925
8395479,5,B003EGWJBK,"This is a beautifully produced, very professional and most helpful video.  Angelena is a very skilled, yet very relatable instructor.

For anyone who needs the help of a chair to do yoga this is a good pick.  Most chair yoga videos I've seen lose a lot of the tradition of yoga, but Angelena keeps that tradition alive.  What a great balance of work.  Nothing was left out.  I would love to attend a live class with Angelena.

If you're looking for the best of the best, this should be your pick.",1336262400,,496,4.384615384615385
8395480,5,B003EGWJBK,"Angelena's chair yoga DVD is made for people of all ages and abilities. She is able to bring in some more challenging poses and balances that you don't always see in chair yoga classes.
I also liked the soothing outdoor scenes. I would recommend this DVD for anyone who has never taken a yoga class before and is interested in exploring this practice, but is reluctant to try a traditional yoga class. Angelena is a seasoned Kripalu yoga teacher and her instructions are clear and easy to follow.",1330300800,,496,4.6477272727272725
8395481,5,B003EGWJBK,"I am a 60 year old male, a former athlete and use this dvd for myself in the office and at home. Because my knees were blown out though basketball, I am unable to do a regular yoga class, since getting up and down off the floor or stressing my knees in any way does not work for me. This chair yoga dvd lets me use every part of my body and at the same time helps me let go of the stress. The teacher is very thorough in her directions and the whole video is creatively done, making it compelling to watch, over and over. I highly recommend it to anyone of any age.",1325116800,2,565,3.9217391304347826

8395483,5,B003EGWJBK,"As a bodyworker and yoga teacher myself, I know the benefit for clients and students to have a practice routine at home. This DVD offers accessible yoga and is an excellent routine for anyone who needs to learn to relax and to move each part of their body in a gentle but energetic way.",1291420800,6,286,4.314814814814815
8395484,5,B003EGWJBK,"Besides enjoying Angelena voice, which was so calming and relaxing, I especially appreciated the way in which the video was organized, in that that I could do one section at a time, ie: neck and shoulders.  This was useful when I ran short of time.  It amazed me that I could get a total body workout in and with a chair.",1287360000,7,321,4.245901639344262
8395485,5,B003EGWJBK,"This chair yoga DVD is a relaxing treat to the senses, as well as the body. The beautiful photography and intermittent music artfully serves as background to Angelena's soothing, instructional voice. The program is absolutely perfect for anyone who wants to gently stretch and refresh the body (and mind) with no stress, tension or injury. I practice parts of it as a welcome break to the work day. As the variety of students demonstrates, all ages and physical conditions will benefit.  I enthusiastically recommend it.",1271203200,7,520,5.117647058823529
8395486,5,B003EGWJBK,"I really like this chair yoga video. The instructions are easy to follow and the teacher leads me in moving all my muscles and joints. Sometimes I do the whole video and other times just one section. I' can do the 15 minute section for my neck, shoulders, and back as I sit at the computer and all the tightness is gone. I also really like to do the last section when I am feeling stressed and my mind needs calming. I highly recommend that you treat yourself and your body to this video.",1270512000,8,488,4.202127659574468
