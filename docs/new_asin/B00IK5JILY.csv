8642913,1,B00IK5JILY,"I got this long time ago(mid last year of 2014) at a store that sells used and new CD's/DVD's/book's and etc...called Dimple records. It was 9$ I think and I was excited to have found something of a Lorde DVD documentary(being in a phase of wanting anything Lorde, but this right here is not even worth it). So I got to watching it and it sucked....lol, it was underwhelming, I could have made a better docu then that. You can find all these stuff about Lorde on the internet...so its nothing new or special about this to make you feel excited about. I refunded it the next day, I was actually lucky to get a money refund, because they told me...next time (since I have a membership) it will have to be credit points to my card then rather money refund. Basically don't buy it unless you leave under a rock and don't have an internet, lol.",1451260800,2,839,4.350318471337579
8642914,3,B00IK5JILY,"Although the cover photo does say ""unauthorized"" at the bottom, I didn't notice it until I received the DVD. You should only buy this if you are a big Lorde fan and are too lazy to browse the internet for interviews. The DVD consists of a collection of interviews most of which I have already seen on Youtube. There is one interview on a Swedish TV show (in English) that I hadn't seen and was interesting.

There is no music by Lorde, only some shots taken from her videos, without sound, that is used during the narration.

At the beginning, and interspersed throughout the 48 minutes of the DVD is some commentary most of which is word for word from Wikipedia (I love Wikipedia). The narration is competent but deadpan and not much original thought is expressed. And it sounds like it was recorded in someone's living room. Much of The video is low quality having been shot at radio studios and at music festivals. the Swedish interview looks like a VCR recording (do they still make those?). The video ends very abruptly (I played the end again to see if the disc had skipped) in the middle of a word.

Certainly don't pay $10 for this. In a few months, you can probably get it for $1.99 if you think you really need it. Or wait for a real documentary about this remarkable artist.

Apparently, no one else has watched this yet. But if anyone else reviews it on Amazon, I think they will probably not be as restrained in their review as I was.",1401321600,14,1447,4.428571428571429
