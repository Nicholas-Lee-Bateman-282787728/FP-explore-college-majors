2493006,5,B000E5KQMI,I have all three seasons on dvd and all episodes play perfectly. I however I do know that universal's duel layer double sided disks have a high defect rate. I guess I'm just one of the lucky ones or it could be that I have the best dvd player on the market (marantz dv-9500) for $2100 it better play all disks perfectly! lol.,1140220800,4,325,4.174603174603175
2493007,1,B000E5KQMI,"It is a shame that the latest seasons of a great show like Magnum PI are being sold on terrible DVD's.  I have season one and two on DVD, and they are great.  Season Three was a terrible shock.  Universal may have changed the digital labs that manufacture these products, and the new lab is incompetent.  In any case wherever these disks are made should be shut down.

The new DVDs really ARE poor.  Several episodes skip, freeze, loose audio or just lock up.  My DVD player is a very good Sony, and I have no problems playing any other DVD's, but these new Magnum DVD's are really defective.  Not only did season three play poorly, the color transfer is weak, and the images are noticeably grainier than season one and two.  Why?

The first two seasons came with four hours of bonus episodes; season three came with only one.  Also the subtitles are terrible now.  They are abbreviated and no longer accurately convey the spoken words.  Also they no longer have French subtitles.  Why not?  The DVD set only cost $39.00 so it's not worth sending back just in the hope that replacements will be better.

Universal knows there are millions of Magnum fans.  It appears that it has cut its manufacturing costs and is shipping defective products knowing that the huge fan base of Magnum fans who will buy these DVD's anyway.  That is a shame.

If you love Magnum definetly get Season 1 and 2.  If you want to buy season 3 and 4 at least you have been warned.  Don't expect them to be any where as good as season 1 and 2.  They are not.",1140220800,17,1531,4.392857142857143
2493008,5,B000E5KQMI,"I don't know what that first guy is talking about.  I have seasons 1-3 on DVD and all of my dvd's play flawlessly.  If he keeps returning the dvd's , getting new ones, and still having the same problems, it just sounds like a cheap DVD player to me.  I would suggest he invest in a better DVD player rather than deprive himself of the pleasure of watching one of the greatest series of all time.",1139875200,4,395,4.171052631578948
2493009,1,B000E5KQMI,"Magnum P.I is my favorite TV show of all time.

My original plan was to buy all 8 seasons on DVD.

However, with the releases of the first 3 seasons, Universal has repeatedly released DVDs with a very high rate of defects. Many people on many different internet message boards, including myself, have been complaining about lots of problems on these DVDs, such as pixelating, freezing, skipping, etc. Some of the episodes are unplayable. Even after multiple exchanges at the place of purchase, some people still can't get a set that plays properly. These are manufacturing defects. Universal has been repeatedly informed of these defects, but has chosen to do nothing about it.

I own the first 3 seasons. But I'm done buying this show on DVD. Withholding my money from Universal is the only real way to express my disappointment with the defective DVDs. I won't be buying seasons 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.

My 1 star rating is for the high rate of defects on these DVDs. If it weren't for the defects, I'd be giving this a 5 star rating.

Here are the episodes from season 4:

Home From The Sea - This is my #1 favorite episode of the entire series. I won't spoil it for you by revealing any of the plot. But I will say this: if you've ever seen the episode where Magnum treads water, this is it. This is a very emotionally intense episode. You know those big guys with the bulging muscles and the tattoos who claim they never cry? If you show them this episode, I bet they will cry. If you want to introduce the series to someone (of any size, age, or gender) who has never seen it before, this is the episode to show them. One thing that I love about this episode is the way that the dialogue at the end of every scene transitions into the dialogue at the beginning of the next scene, even though the two scenes are apparently totally unrelated. This episode is a masterpiece of writing, acting, directing, camera work, editing, and musical scoring. This episode is perfect. I think this may be the only G-rated episode of the series, as it has absolutely no violence, sex, or foul language. ""You turkeys!!!""

Luther Gillis File 521 - Luther Gillis appeared in 5 episodes, and it's extremely easy to get them confused with each other. This is the first of those 5.

Smaller Than Life - An old friend of Rick's appears in this episode. But even Rick isn't completely sure as to his identity. Apparently, the friend may or may not be some kind of secret government agent. This episode has a really great scene of Rick, Higgins, and Rick's friend secretly entering a building.

Distant Relative - Rick talks Magnum into chaperoning his 22 year old sister. Rick isn't too pleased with the outcome, and he ends up punching Magnum in the jaw. This is one of the best episodes of this season.

Limited Engagement - Magnum works undercover to solve a string of robberies at a chain of grocery stores. Magnum also acts as a social worker to try to save some old people from being evicted from their retirement home. This episode is lighthearted and sappy, but it's not a totally bad episode. There are a few good scenes, such as T.C. repeatedly asking Magnum to fish pickled eggs out of a disgusting jar of brine, and then saying, ""Oh dear me! I do believe that I've forgotten my wallet!""

Letter To A Duchess - A British woman is visiting the estate. Higgins writes her an anonymous love note. She mistakenly assumes the note is from Magnum. This episode is OK. But it's nowhere nearly as good as the brilliant ""Tropical Madness"" episode from season 2, which this episode kind of reminds me of.

Squeeze Play - Robin Masters makes a bet on a baseball game that Magnum is playing in. If Magnum's team loses, Robin has to give up the estate for a year to the owner of the other team. And that includes the guest house. So Magnum better win!

A Sense Of Debt - Several years before she played Brenda on ""Beverly Hills 90210,"" Shannen Doherty appeared on this episode of Magnum P.I., where she brainwashed Zeus and Apollo into forgetting what their names are. Higgins is not amused.

The Look - Magnum visits a disc jockey in Hawaii that he knew from his time in Vietnam.

Operation Silent Night - On Christmas eve, Magnum, T.C., Rick, and Higgins are stranded on an island that the navy is planning to use for gunnery practice. This is one of my favorite episodes of this season.

Jororo Farewell - The season 2 episode ""The Jororo Kill"" is one of my favorite episodes of the series. This inferior season 4 episode brings back some of the same characters, but this time, the plot is pretty bad. A young prince runs away from home because he wants to be a regular boy instead of a prince. Another lame episode with Magnum as a social worker.

The Case Of The Red Faced Thespian - This is a really cool episode with many pop culture references. This one's a lot of fun. Higgins is planning a party with a 1920s/Great Gatsby theme. In preparation, he uses miniature explosives to try to kill some rodents that have dug tunnels under the estate. But like Wyle E. Coyote trying to kill the Road Runner, Higgins ends up giving himself a concussion. When the party does take place, Magnum walks into one of the bedrooms, and sees a woman lying dead on the bed. Higgins is standing there, dressed in Shakespearean clothing, and reciting a confessional line from Othello, ""Desdemona, Dead! I killed her!"" Magnum has to prove that Higgins is innocent, and that his ""confession"" is the result of his concussion combined with his obsession with Shakespeare, and not from actually having committed the murder.

No More Mr. Nice Guy - Magnum tries to catch a drug dealer.

Rembrandt's Girl - Hooray for guest Carol Burnett, who is a phenomenally amazing actress, and always gives an absolutely brilliant performance! Boo for the lame, cliche, and unoriginal script, which has Magnum and Burnett getting locked inside a bank vault! Fortunately, Burnett would return to play the same character in the season 8 episode ""A Girl Named Sue,"" which has a much better script than this one. In that season 8 episode, Burnett has gotten her own license as a private investigator, and she and Magnum unknowingly get into a shootout against each other!

Paradise Blues - A jazz/pop singer that T.C. had been infatuated with many years ago comes to visit. She has a beautiful voice, full of emotion, conviction, and style. It's a true joy to listen to her sing. There's lots of great music in this one. However, I really hate the way the episode ends. What were the writers thinking?

The Return Of Luther Gillis - Higgins gets kidnapped. He's held hostage in a trailer with a bomb that's set to go off.

Let The Punishment Fit The Crime- This is the episode with the performance from the Mikado of ""Three Little Girls From School Are We.""

Holmes Is Where The Heart Is - Higgins recalls events of his life before he met Magnum, with a touch of Sherlock Homes added for fun.

On Face Value - Usually, Magnum is the epitome of proper gun use and safety. But not in this episode. And an innocent person suffers serious consequences as a result of Magnum's irresponsible actions.

Dream A Little Dream - Magnum recalls his first case as a private investigator, before he moved into the estate. After T.C.'s chopper gets bullet holes for the first time, Magnum says, ""I promise that that will never happen again.""

I Witness - Great Roshomon type episode. After the King Kamehameha Club is robbed by masked men, Magnum listens to T.C., Rick, and Higgins each give their own unique account of what happened. Magnum has to piece their stories together to find a common element so he can catch the thief. This is a very humorous episode, as each teller of the story embellishes it to make himself out to be the hero, and to make the others out to be cowards.",1139184000,94,7808,4.563259471050751

That's not a complaint about the show; it's just that the stories are so familiar (borrowed from other movies ,TV shows, and romance novels), that it's easy to slide into and not feel ashamed.

I will say, though, that one of the discs was not the original, it was copied off an original, and had visible scratches on it, but it played perfectly. The fine print probably said it could be replaced with equal quality if not able to find original, but I am very satisfied, it was about the third of the price that the store was selling it for, including the shipping.",1397347200,,585,4.232142857142857

Magnum is a guy show and most of us watch it for the action, fun, a few laughs and the occasional good looking chick... guy stuff.  Home From The Sea (HFTS) is none of these.  Higgins would describe it as ""a dragged out, tear jerking exercise in boredom that should only be used as a treatment for insomnia"".

The more I watch the episodes the more I think TV today has lost some of the magic it held in my youth.  Magnum combines drama and comedy in a way that few shows have been able to match since.  No episode is the same.  There is no Grey's Anatomy formula (someone cries every episode by minute 32, there is a sappy song where the troubled character assesses what they learned that episode, etc.).  With Magnum P.I. some episodes are purely light-hearted and some are darkly intense.  He mugs to the camera at one point and at another he kills an evil Soviet in cold blood.  The show is unafraid of cliche' or over-the-top theatrics (see Case of the Red-Faced Thespian).  At the same time it takes on sensitive issues like treatment of Vietnam Vets, post-traumatic stress, the Cold War and racism.  It also has at its core a group of friends bonded together through an understanding of what it is to serve and love one's country.  Even Higgins, with his anecdotes of WWII, is part of this mix.  I love it and plan to collect the entire series.",1267056000,6,1179,4.488262910798122
2493298,5,B000E5KQMI,I have recently purchased Magnum PI Seasons 1-3 and have enjoyed them immensely. I am puzzled by some of the earlier comments regarding season 3.  I have had absolutely no problems with my discs and would recommend that anyone who wants season 3 to go ahead and order it.  It's ashame that apparantly Universal ran inferior quality discs of season 3 in the past and I think they should step up to the plate and send those disappointed in the past with new ones immediately for no charge or at an extremely discounted price for the inconvenience caused.,1251417600,5,552,4.622448979591836
2493299,4,B000E5KQMI,"Magnum, PI is in its essentials about a man who sees the oncoming train of approaching middle age and flees the station. He is enabled in this by landing a dream ""job"" which doesn't really entail him having to work unless he really wants to. His friends indulge him and his fellow estate resident despairs of him.

Magnum, PI had a lot going for it - likable characters (a must for any show I watch), exotic locale, good writing, and on screen talent that could make it all work. It's a hard show to pigeonhole - it can swing from comedy to action to drama to tragedy - sometimes in the same episode.

The centerpiece of the show is the relationship between Magnum and Higgins - Higgins obviously likes Magnum but just can't bring himself to approve of Magnum's infuriating irresponsibility. Magnum for his part likes Higgins but just can't understand why he worries about things Magnum considers unimportant. The development of this relationship is a joy to watch. The relationship between Magnum and his much put upon friends Rick and TC is much more longstanding and stable.

Season 4 offers 21 episodes and 1 bonus episode from season 5. All that is not excellent is very good. There is nary a loser in the bunch - my least favorite is ""Jororo Farewell"".

I dock this collection a single star based on production values. Double sided DVDs are a crime against nature although mine played fine with only occasional artifacting. There has also been a slip in value as there are no on disc episode summaries, original air dates, or scene selections as there were for previous seasons. In addition to the season 5 bonus episode already mentioned there is a ""The Great '80s TV Flashback"" feature describing other (presumably Universal) TV shows available on DVD.

If you're new to Magnum starting at season 1 would be advisable since there is a certain amount of continuity that carries forward but nothing that would prevent you from enjoying this season. If you've already worked your way through seasons 1, 2, and 3 this is more of the same great stuff. Enjoy!",1245888000,2,2061,4.713888888888889

I'm quite an admirer of Mr. Selleck, due to his independent conservative beliefs as well as his views on the 2nd Ammendment. I also gained GREAT respect for him for his handling of the Rosie O. attack he endured! I also find his cowboy movies are especially terrific examples of his acting ability, great story telling there. Never payed much attention to Magnum PI in the 80's when on TV, but now with TODAY's TV which is...well... total garbage, this show is a breath of fresh air. So I thought I'd buy the first season of Magnum, as I recalled it was a pretty good show, plus it has Selleck. What a great decision. The whole cast and the way they interact is like a tight family, funny, strong and loyal ties that bind, and is great fun to watch. You may find that a few episodes (here & there in season 4, 5, 6) are pretty simple (poorly written), BUT the actors tried to work with it and it's still the Magnum PI family.

2493332,5,B000E5KQMI,"OK, so I am not the biggest Magnum P.I. fan to ever watch the show. Sure, I liked it when it was on... but come 1984, my interests shifted over to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Miami-Vice-The-Complete-Series/dp/B000ULPFGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Miami Vice: The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;and they never returned. Oh I still watched.. but to be completely honest, I never really cared that much if the show was on or not.

But...

When the Season Four premier episode entitled HOME FROM THE SEA first aired on 29 September 1983, I - like many other viewers - was treated to one of the most moving episodes of the entire Magnum P.I. series. I must admit that I only ever saw that episode one time... on the day it first aired... but it stuck with me for over twenty-three years. HOME FROM THE SEA was the only episode from the entire series that I vividly remembered for all of that time. It was the one episode that I told anyone and everyone about. It was the one episode that I tried and tried to catch when the show went into syndication. I never found it. So when Universal started releasing the series on DVD, I searched and I waited.

I purchased this boxed set FOR THAT EPISODE AND THAT EPISODE ONLY. And that episode alone warrants the five star rating. I cannot stress enough the impact this one show had on my psyche. I simply never stopped thinking about it. Just watch it and you will understand. I cried and so did my Wife.

I am sure that I will enjoy watching the rest of Season Four, and that may even cause me to want to buy some of the other Seasons. But all I really wanted is HOME FROM THE SEA, and now I have it. It only took twenty-three years for me to find it. I doubt if even Thomas Magnum could tread water for that long. If you are even remotely a Magnum P.I. fan, this is the Season you want because this is the Season with HOME FROM THE SEA.

From [...]

""It's the 4th of July, and Higgins is playing in a polo match, T.C. is taking his baseball team to a professional game, Rick is out with his latest girlfriend on the King Kamehameha II yacht, and Thomas is observing his annual Independence Day tradition of a solitary day at sea -- until his surf ski is capsized in the wake of a recklessly driven speedboat and set adrift. Carried off further and further away from land by the powerful Molokai Channel, Thomas relies on childhood memories of his father's training him to tread water to keep himself afloat as he struggles desperately to stay above water and fend off a menacing shark. As the hours pass, Higgins, T.C. and Rick each have a sixth sense that Thomas is in trouble, and they team up to rescue him. Thomas approaches the twenty-four hour mark in the water recalling his wedding to Michelle and his father's burial -- on July 4, 1951 -- as Higgins scoops him out of the ocean, with T.C. in his helicopter overhead and Rick on the yacht nearby.""",1231804800,5,2935,4.549242424242424
2493333,3,B000E5KQMI,"MAGNUM's 1983-84 Season is only a so-so season, because it wasn't as good as the first 3 seasons of this private detective drama and it seemed almost as if they were trying to make it too much like the 3rd Season of MAGNUM, PI because the action seemed to have started getting a less & less interesting for a while until MAGNUM hit it's 6th Season on CBS, especially since the honeymoon phase of this show was already long gone by the time this detective drama hit off its 4th Season in the Fall of 1984.

It was interesting seeing guest stars like
*Carol Burnett in the ""Rembrandt's Girl"" episode

*Robert Pine in the ""Dad"" episode after his co-starring days as Ponch & Jon's hard-nosed superior officer(Sgt. Joe Getraer) on CHiPs.

*Gretchen Corbett in ""The Look"" episode after her co-starring days as the often fastidious Jim Rockford's foxy attorney girlfriend(Beth Davenport)on THE ROCKFORD FILES

*Shannon Doherty before her co-starring days as the sleazy rebellious bad girl(Brenda Walsh) on BEVERLY HILLS 90210 and her Christine Witherspoon days on OUR HOUSE

*Robert Ito in ""The Jororo Farewell"" episode after his co-starring days on QUINCY M.E.

*Deborah Pratt in the ""Rembrandt's Girl"" episode during her co-starring days as Marilla on AIRWOLF

*Cindy Pickett in the ""Dream A Little Dream"" episode during her co-starring days on ST. ELSEWHERE

So now that Universal has all 8 seasons of MAGNUM on DVD, I'm hoping this has inspired Warner Bros. to finally release the detective drama MATT HOUSTON on DVD soon, since MATT HOUSTON was a pretty cool private detective show too that was in competition with MAGNUM, P.I. throughout MATT HOUSTON's whole 3-year run on CBS's rival network ABC, not to mention that Matt Houston(Lee Horseley) had a slight resemeblence to Thomas Magnum(Tom Selleck) except Magnum was a world-class private investigator and beach-bum who lived on a shoe-string budget rent-free at the so-called Robin Masters estate in Honolulu, Hawaii and was always broke unlike Houston who was a wealthy private detective who was never broke and lived high on the hog in a ritzy penhouse in Hollywood and always had sexy women around him living the kind of lifestyle that Magnum would've liked to have had since Magnum was constantly outclassed by Houston and always struggling to make a living & barely able to stay afloat, but Houston was a filthy-rich playboy from Texas who moved to the L.A. Area to take over a family business overseas and ran a detective agency on the side as a hobby with some help from his foxy sidekick CJ Parsons(Pamela Hensley)previously known for her role as the relentless Princess Ardala on BUCK ROGERS.

Something I couldn't help finding odd about MAGNUM's 4th Season was in ""The Jororo Farewell"" the character Ed Russler was played by John Saxon, but in ""The Jororo Kill"" episode from the 2nd Season, the Russler character was portrayed by Burr DeBenning, even though it was so-called the same person and same character since the Russler character was supposedly coming back for a second appearance on the show 2 years later after his first appearance back in January of 1982 when ""The Jororo Kill"" episodes original air-date(1/7/82) on CBS was.

MAGNUM's 1983-1984 Season also takes me all the way back to memory lane to the days when I was 11 years old and still living in my hometown(El Centro, CA) since I was living in the Imperial Valley at the time, which by the way is a small secluded desert community with nothing to do for fun or entertainment, unless of course you're married or a cop.

In the meantime, I just got word that Paramount will fortunately finally be releasing MATT HOUSTON out on DVD on March 9th, 2010 which shall be exciting news for all MATT HOUSTON and MAGNUM fans since MATT HOUSTON was a very popular private detective drama from the 80's just like MAGNUM was.",1227484800,,3843,4.869831546707504

2493363,3,B000E5KQMI,"I suppose every show has its ups and downs, and Magnum had been improving nicely from Season 1 to 3.  Unfortunately, Season 4 takes a step backward, and the shows generally have less heart, less brains, and more of the cheap sitcom-like comedy that lesser shows of the era (A-Team, Simon and Simon, etc.) routinely churned out.  Luckily, Magnum recovered in later seasons.  While there are some genuine gems in the season, there's also a lot of filler.

As usual, the best episodes revolve around the entire cast.  Bookending the season are the two best shows.  In the season finale, 'I, Witness,' Magnum tries to piece together conflicting eye-witness accounts of a robbery at the King Kamehameha Club.  The catch: the three eyewitnesses are Rick, T.C., and Higgins.  It plays on the way that each character sees himself (i.e. as the heroic one) and each of the others (likeable but deeply flawed).  However, it's the first episode, 'Home From the Sea,' that is possibly the best show of the series.  In time-honoured Magnum tradition, each of Higgins, Rick, and T.C. sense that Magnum is in trouble when he is almost run over by a speedboat, loses his surfski, and winds up in a strong ocean current pulling him away from land.  To keep himself occupied while awaiting rescue, Magnum carries on a running monologue with his deceased father, killed in Korea when Magnum was only 10.  We see scenes of Magnum's childhood in flashback, where he is portrayed surprisingly effectively by a young actor.  Another key moment, for me, is how it portrays the trust between all the characters - they may bicker constantly, but when the chips are down, T.C. has no problem with Higgins jumping out of his chopper with a life preserver for Magnum.

Overall, the characters in the series do grow, especially Agatha, who appears in several episodes, and District Attorney Carol Marcus.  Carol ends up being the perfect foil for Magnum (although she can be overused), being the only one able to manipulate Magnum into doing things for her, the same way he manipulates Rick and T.C.  The continuing expansion and elaboration of the supporting cast makes the later seasons all the better, it's just too bad the writing is not the greatest in this particular season.",1167091200,,2250,4.850785340314136
2493364,5,B000E5KQMI,"""Magnum P.I."" is probably the best idea for a TV show there ever was, and the fourth season certainly does not disappoint.  Many of the show's most rabid fans insist that the show was at its peak during the fourth season.

And this finely-done DVD includes many of the core episodes that made the show so famous.  Here are just some of them:

Episode #41:  ""Bow wow ow.""  Zeus and Apollo, Higgins's guard dogs, come down with sarcoptic mange and Magnum must use everything at his disposal to care for them and get them to a mysterious vet on distant Kuai.

Episode #42:  ""Errrrrr.""  Magnum, in a bid to test the security of the Masters's estate, sneaks through Higgins's bedroom window and is suprised to find everybody's favorite major-domo prancing about in women's undies.  Hijinks ensue.

Episode #43:  ""Senor Bigote.""  Magnum, in a alcoholic cloud, shaves off his famous ""more manly than thou"" moustache.  Zeus and Apollo don't recognize him and he is seriously mauled upon returning to the guest house.  The local animal control has the dogs put to sleep.  Hijinks ensue.

Episode #44:  ""By Any Means Necessary.""  T.C., the chummy helicopter pilot, joins the Black Panther party and refuses to ferry Magnum around the islands anymore.

Episode #45:  ""Pedal Man.""  Robin Masters gives orders that his Ferrari be repainted a hot pink, eliminating Magnum's desire to drive it around.  Henceforth the private eye must conduct his investigations by rickshaw.  (A lot of fans claim that series really took a nose-dive at this point.)

Episode #46:  ""BOOM!""  A volcano long thought dormant erupts on the island.  Millions die.  Hijinks ensue.

Episode #47:  ""Aloha Mainland.""  Hawaii secedes from the U.S.  Civil War ensues, then hijinks.",1160870400,2,1737,4.982456140350878

2493366,4,B000E5KQMI,"Magnum P.I. was my favorite show when I was growing up.  I was ecstatic when they began releasing individual seasons on DVD.  Fortunately, for myself, I have not had any problem with the playing of the DVD's like other individuals have experienced.  I DO NOT like the double-sided DVD's!!!  Way too easy to scratch and damage!!!

What I appreciate most about the DVD episodes is that they are the full-length, original, un-cut episode which runs 49-50 minutes long.  Today's syndicated episode version's have 5-6 minutes of material trimmed from their original filming.  Also, you get each season's original, beginning intro-theme song and footage as well as it's original conclusion footage and music.  A true Magnum P.I. fan will remember the cheesy, musical intro the show had for it's first 11 episodes in Season 1, which was later changed to it's more popular theme song which is more synonomous with casual fans.

Season 4 begins the slow, downturn the series experienced in the middle of it's total run of 8 total years.  Although, season 4 makes for decent entertainment, Season's 1-3 were the best, with season number 2 being my favorite.  Some of the story lines in season 4 became far-fetched and corny.  Season's 5 and 6 continued this downturn and the ratings were also, downtrodden vs. previous years.  The show became re-invigorated in Season's 7 and 8 by getting back on track with continuing storylines the show had developed over the years, bringing most to a conclusion with the exception of one.  Who was truly, Robin Master's?  Perhaps as Magnum thought, it was Higgins, but, we will never, ever know for sure.  You draw your own conclusion.

If you truly enjoy the show and have the time to view all 162 episodes, you need to own every episode from start to finish to fully understand the continuing storylines and view how the characters changed and matured throughout the 8 years Magnum was on the air.  I for one, can not wait until future season's are released.  There has not been since, another TV show that could and will ever match the the quick wit, friendly bantering, and entertainment that the cast delivered on a weekly basis.",1150675200,9,2161,4.855191256830601
2493367,5,B000E5KQMI,"For those with playback issues - try another player before you condem the discs.  Toshiba's and inexpensive base model units seem especially sensitive to dust and other errors on these Universal double sided discs. I have a very old top line SONY from the days when DVD players first came out that plays any of these discs flawlessly.  I also have a GO video DVD burner / VHS combo which has very few problems with them. My Toshiba can't seem to play any of these discs ( and many others ) without various problems ( it was a mid pack $ 150 unit when new ).  As to Magnum PI season 4 - time has made me appreciate the quality that this series grew into.  It came a long way from just bikini babes and hula shirts to real stories. You could tell there was a lot of care put into most of them. I also have a lot more apprecation for the dedication of Mr. Selleck. ( ref the ""Biography"" interviews ). His comments about being a guest on Rockford Files and how James Garner treated cast and crew members and that he tried to live up to similar standards showed more inteligence and sensitivity than Tom was credited with much of time.  I'll be buying all of the seasons and keeping in my collection.

2493368,5,B000E5KQMI,"I just want everyone to know that I have 2 DVD players and I have not seen the problems that others here have mentioned.  I have all 4 seasons and have really enjoyed them.  I am looking forward season 5 coming out.  On season 1, I had one problem on one episode with it skipping.  I am not sure if it was the DVD or some dust on the DVD.  I have had zero problems with all other seasons and all other episodes.

My understanding is that some DVD players have better error checking than others.  My DVD players are a couple of years old and are both combination DVD/VHS players.  One is a Panasonic and one is a Sony.  My guess is that if you have a newer or higher quality DVD player (not the $99 special) that you will probably not have the problems that others have been complaining about.

Regardless, the manufacturer should be dealing with these problems and especially not putting episodes on both sides of the DVD.  At least the packaging in the last couple seasons was improved from the bad packaging of season 1 where it was impossible to get the DVD's out of the case and some people broke the DVD because it stuck to the center tabs.

My recommendation:  If you are a hard-core Magnum Fan like me AND you have a newer DVD player, don't hesitate ordering the Magnum P.I. series.  I have had hours of enjoyment reliving this incredible series.  Great action, characters, storylines, Hawaiian scenary, and of course that hot Farrari.",1149465600,9,1442,4.450381679389313

2493395,5,B000E5KQMI,"Magnum was one of the last T.V. Programs that I would rearrange

my schedule to watch. It is a classic and should be a model

for current T.V. mogols to follow. I would agree that a great deal is lost due to the poor qualities of the double sided DVD's. Universal should be ashamed to release one of their greatest, classic T.V. productions on such a cheap and shoddy format.",1147910400,3,375,4.3428571428571425
2493396,4,B000E5KQMI,"My little spiel on the ""DVD sucks"" issue:

Being a Magnum fan myself, I personally identify with those complaining about the poor-quality DVD's.  They ARE lousy; two sided DVD's are an invitation to hours of incessant skipping and  frustatingly banging the DVD player (Not to mention longevity issues)!!  My problems have generally been across-the-board with each of the three seasons I currently own.  Luckily, though, Ive been able to get at least one good viewing per episode before I start having problems.  It IS a real shame that Universal has decided to release Magnum PI on the lousiest DVD format available.

In all fairness to Universal, however, there should be some gratitude for them at least TRYING to get the Magnum PI series out on DVD.  It's not like there's millions of Magnum PI fans out there waiting for the next season's release.  If you hate the DVD's, email Universal or find somebody in Chicago who'll Ti-Vo  Magnum episodes for you.  STOP complaining on Amazon.com (find a Magnum PI message board instead)!!

Sorry if this came out more as a rant than a review, but I just wanted to give the credit where it's due.

And by the way, Magnum PI is an awesome series (Cant wait for Season Five)!!",1146614400,10,1218,4.742857142857143
2493397,4,B000E5KQMI,"I'm happy to report my Fourth Season DVDs played fine. More importantly, the series really comes into its own during its fourth year on the air. While most programs designed for an hour slot, Magnum and Higgins' characters have enough depth to them that each hour is something of a glimpse into their lives. In particular, you can't watch this season without appreciating something about Magnum's past influences, his father, author Raymond Chandler, Agatha Christie and others. While all of this is wrapped in the sometimes dated trappings of an '80s TV show, a lot of the substance of the show survives.

This season includes what may be the best hour of television writing of its era, the Home from the Sea episode. As another reviewer mentioned, this is the ""treading water"" episode and it cemented many viewers' bond with Selleck's character. No staged fist fights, no explosions, no Ferrari chases. Not many episodes come close to this.

Other memorable episodes include Distant Relative, which focuses on Rick, Rick's sister and Magnum as a ""babysitter"" for a not-too-innocent twentysomething. Letter To A Duchess, in which Higgins has a crush on a British woman who falls for Magnum, also stands out: all the right sets, enough action, and it illuminates the Magnum-Higgins relationship that turns out to be the show's core.

Vietnam always lurks not far below the surface in the series, and The Look is an interesting (but dated) tie in to Magnum's past, with a female disc jockey who plays a role similar to Tyne Daly's female-friend-in-Vietnam from the excellent ""Jororo Kill"" episode in season two.

Another brilliant episode: Operation Silent Night, in which the main characters are marooned on Christmas Eve on an island used for Navy gunnery practice. By this point in the series, the writers no longer had to rely on props like the Ferrari and the bikini babes at the King Kamehameha Club to make it work.

On Face Value also rises to the top. An unexpected twist in a car chase puts Magnum into a wrenching situation, possibly the most affecting since Vietnam. An intense 'hour', all about character and inner struggle, with amazing performances by Selleck and Hillerman (Higgins). Overshadowed only by Home from the Sea.

The fourth season includes some of the best, and some lesser material -- although even the Luther Gillis episodes have their moments. There are a few here you'll only watch once, but more that are lifetime keepers.",1146268800,43,2454,4.9731707317073175
2493398,5,B000E5KQMI,"I have all 4 seasons so far and have had problems with only 1 season. I had all kinds of problems with season 3, freezing , skipping, etc, was real apprehensive about season 4. I kept waiting for the same problems I had with season 3 but I just finished and had no problems. Can't wait for season 5.",1146096000,4,299,4.084745762711864
2493399,1,B000E5KQMI,"I was greatly disappointed when I found that the A-Team/Magnum and Knight Rider TV episodes were all being released with both sides of each DVD being used - a sure sign of low-quality DVDs. Magnum may be the best show around, but ripping people off by selling low-grade DVDs is totally unacceptable. This 4th season DVd is even worse than the previous ones I bought, with numerous defects appearing. Luckily, I have a special CD/DVD Repairer kit which  can eliminate defects in most cases, but I have to use the equipment at least once or twice a month for really shoddy DVDs like this season of Magnum.

All in all, I'm disgusted by the owners/producers for betraying TV fans in this way. It's ridiculous that a smaller TV show like ""I Dream Of Jeannie"" or ""Tropical Heat"" can actually provide  better-quality 1-sided DVDs whereas a big studio can't even provide special features and interviews let alone good-quality DVDs.",1145404800,6,924,4.8354430379746836
2493400,5,B000E5KQMI,"If you're a Magnum fan, the season sets are well worth the price. I for one have not had any problems with freezing, skipping or any other defects. I didn't even know people were having problem.

My only complaint is the lack of special features. A few cast interviews or some behind the scenes stuff would be a very nice addition to an already great series.",1145145600,6,358,4.424242424242424
2493401,5,B000E5KQMI,"Hi all....I'm posting from England just to say that I have the first three series (bought from Amazon.co.uk) and all three play fine. I popped on here to consider buying series 4, because it isn't out in the UK yet (and I have a multi-region player), but after reading these reviews, I'll wait until it comes out in the UK.

I don't know if a different grade of DVD is used for the UK version, but I've not had a single problem with the first three.

It's a shame your enjoyment of such a fantastic series has been spoiled. Best of luck!!",1144454400,8,538,4.264705882352941
2493402,3,B000E5KQMI,"Seeing Magnum P.I. after all these years has brought back so many fond memories. I think the chemistry between Higgins, Magnum, Rick and T.C. couldn't have been better. Actually, it represents what true friendship is really about. But, the real reason I'm writing this review is the quality and craftmanship of the cheap DVD's Season 1,2 & especially 3 is written on. Although I've played them on several players, it seems to get around the skipping and freezing issues, you must first select scenes and choose a later break in the show to go around the problem. Yes, you will most likely miss 10-15 minutes worth of viewing but still be able to see some part of the show. I know what you're thinking ....  then why look at that episode in the first place? Right? It depends on the person actually and how much satisfaction you really require. I'm just hoping Season 4 that comes out April 4th will be of better disc quality but am still expecting the same poor performance. By the way, does anyone know if Simon & Simon that usually followed Magnum P.I. will be coming out soon for Season 1? It was another great private investigator show. Thanks!",1143072000,4,1148,4.627450980392157
2493403,4,B000E5KQMI,"Firstly, my girlfriend ordered me Season Four from Amazon and it has yet to arrive so I guess I'll just have to wait and see what happens -- as far as the defects a few people here have mentioned -- when it comes in April.  I own Seasons One, Two, and Three.  I've gotten through pretty much all of Seasons One and Two and they seem fine, as far as quaility(I own a Sony DVD player that cost around $100 when I bought it a few years back, for what the DVD player affecting the playback quality is worth).  I'm still working on getting through Season Three -- I typically pop one in right before going to bed so maybe there are defects that I doze through -- but if memory serves there was some freezing on one of the episodes -- the name of which eludes me -- but overall I thought the quality of the box set is fine.

  I will say the episode summaries on Season Three-- as opposed to Seasons One and Two -- could definitely use some tweaking.  All they are are verbatim of what's on each disc's case.  Seasons' One and Two episode summaries are much better.

  My take on Season Four, and the series overall(WARNING:  I WILL BE GIVING SOME THINGS AWAY).  I've been a Magnum fan since the series came out.  It is my favorite television series of all-time.  It brings back many memories:  bonding time with my dad; wearing down my folks' VCR because I had to tape every episode that was rerun on WGN while I was at school; talking Magnum shop with one of my old math teachers in high school; and driving my mates crazy because I just had to watch any of every episode before doing anything else with them, to name a few.  I was such a freak that I had to document every episode title and give it a star rating on how well I liked it.  Now that the Internet's in the picture, freaks like us can really find out what season each episode falls under.  Since my girlfriend bought me Season One, along with Magnum's famous red Hawaiian shirt -- she promised me the Ferrari later -- I've gotten dangerously rehooked on this vice from my youth, and I love it because she's into it too ;).  Okay, now with the show commentary....

  Season Three has one of the series two-parters that is a tie for my favorite two-parter, ""Did You See the Sunrise?"".  This two-parter ties with ""All For One"" from Season Five -- already I can't wait for the release of Season Five -- where the whole gang, except the lads, goes back to Vietnam on a mission(this is also one of my dad's favorite episodes).  Here you really start to get a sense for the darkside of Magnum and the intensity of the show.

  Season Four opens with another one of my favorite episodes of all-time, ""Home From the Sea"".  One of the previous reviewers mentioned this as the episode he would show anyone who has never watched the show before.  I don't know if I agree with this being ""that episode"" but I will say there is only one other episode in the entire eight seasons like this one(it's called ""Solo Flight"" from Season Seven I believe, where Magnum's trapped under an airplane fuselage).  ""Home"" is one of those episodes that goes into Magnum's past(such episodes deal with his wife, Michelle, his dealings with Mac and Buck Greene, and his life as a soldier, and his daughter Lily)and it certainly is a piece of quality writing.

  I completely agree with the previous reviewer who commended the way this episode jump cuts the dialogue from one scene to a completely different one -- this happens in several other epidsodes -- and the screenwriter needs to be given due props.  I can't help but think of little JFK Jr. at JFK's funeral in 1963 when I see the ending of this episode -- once you see it you'll see what I mean -- and it's one of the saddest endings to any of Magnum's episodes.

  I'm not going to summarize each episode from Season Four -- which one reviwer graciously did -- but there are some classic episodes from this season.  I only hope the quality of my belated Valentine's Day gift from my girl is good. If it doesn't I agree with the other reviewers who've vented at Universal.  There are tons of Magnum fans out there -- how many true freaks like myself I don't know, I can only vouch for those in these reviews -- and it's a shame that a piece of American tv culture is being half-assed produced by folks who are just after consumer profit.  At this day and age it doesn't take a genius to realize the technology's out there to produce quality product.  This show, and most importantly the fans, deserve it.",1142985600,5,4491,4.367913148371532
2493404,3,B000E5KQMI,"Ah! so good to know that other people had the same problems w the dvd series too. Thought I was the only one.

 I had to replace seanson 1 and 3. At least Amazon was good about expediting the replacement. I give this a 1 star because of the trouble of replacing them; a five for nostalgia...

 That said, watching this show again brings back a ton of good memories. They just don't make 'em like Magnum anymore. The early seasons are much better than 6,7 and 8. By the time they pulled the plug, the show had really run it's course.

 Luckily, they ended it well. The last couple of episodes did a nice job on leaving an open ending.

 Also, if you wanted to know the song for the last episode, it's called ""Looking for Space"" by John Denver and can be found on his greatest hits cd...",1142553600,5,785,4.1866666666666665

After that, they kinda seem to forget they are in Hawaii, most of the stories could take place pretty much anywhere, the  plots become increasingly unlikely and the gumshoe shlock and shtick get a little bit too thick for my tastes.
Still ok for die-hard fans.
By far the best episodes of this season are [I]Home from the Sea[I], featuring a relatively realistic shark encounter - something not often seen on screen - and the subtly 'Red Pill' [I]Letter to a Duchess[I].",1468713600,,625,4.530973451327434
