8650035,4,B00JDSDQ7E,"LA Maniac is a fun no-budget horror movie that any true slasher/serial killer horror fan will enjoy. What's lacking in budget is made up for in performance by lead actor Randy Tobin who plays the twisted serial killer. He truly embodies a psychopath and all around creep juxtaposed with some amazingly hilarious dialogue while trying to ""win the love"" of lead actress Celeste Marie Martinez.

Director Craig J. McIntyre casually walks that line of comedy (more subtle then Lloyd Kaufman's mind you), shock and the surreal to deliver an entertaining (and a bit disturbing- as all horror should be) movie that makes a great addition to Troma's library and yours as well.",1407456000,,668,4.964285714285714
