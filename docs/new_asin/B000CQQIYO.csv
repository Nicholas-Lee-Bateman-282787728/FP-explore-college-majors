8100821,5,B000CQQIYO,I was really digging into American and South American history and these videos helped me do that. Well worth the time and money!,1418860800,,128,4.608695652173913
8100822,2,B000CQQIYO,"I have been looking for a documentary that compares the conquest of both the Incan and Aztec empires to show to my High School Spanish class.  This documentary has the basic information that I was looking for, but it would have been nice if the editors and director had paid attention to pronunciation (important gods, places and people's names are butchered) and made sure that the visuals tied into the information that was being given.  There are many random shots that have absolutely nothing to do with anything mentioned in the video.",1367884800,,540,4.858695652173913

8100824,3,B000CQQIYO,"I bought this DVD hoping to be able to use it in a class on Latin American culture and civilization. There is much to recommend it, but in the end I decided against showing it to students.

The positives first: this video gives a relatively balanced account of the Inca and Aztec worlds and is free from the sensational style that characterizes some other videos on the subject (the ""Lost Worlds"" and ""Ancient Mysteries"" type videos). The experts brought in to discuss these two civilizations are also good. Probably the best thing is that the video presents reconstructions of both Tenochtitlan and Machu Picchu that help give the viewer a sense of what those cities looked like pre-conquest.

The first of the two big negatives, for me, is that the video focuses heavily on the conquest period, rather than on a description of what these civilizations were like before the Europeans arrived. I was looking for a video that would concentrate on the Inca and Aztec empires themselves, not on their downfall. The second negative is that the narrator consistently mispronounces the Inca and Nahuatl names and terms (ex. Huitzilopochtli, roughly wee-tzee-lo-poach-tlee, becomes ""wit-luh-puck-tlee""). I was wincing at his butchering of these words throughout the video, though besides that I didn't find his British accent hard to understand.

In the end, I could only recommend this video for those interested in the Aztec and Inca civilizations within the context of their conquest, and with the caveat to follow the pronunciation of the experts interviewed rather than the narrator.",1251417600,7,1581,5.12015503875969
8100825,3,B000CQQIYO,"I've seen many works on the Aztecs and the Incas recently, so this may skew my ideas on this work.  Based on the title, I was hoping that the documentary would discuss cultures in what is now Anglo America, but it doesn't.  In fairness, works may speak of Aztecs and Mayas simultaneously, but Aztecs and Incas are usually spoken of separately.  The work also compares the two cultures.  It seems like the Incas were a bit more democratic than the Aztecs.  Whereas the Aztecs were disappointed by Moctezuma II, the Incan people stood by their emperor.

The work stands out from others in that astrology is discussed.  They state that stars were seen as holy and only certain classes were allowed to study them.

The work has modern people dressed as Natives and Spaniards.  However, I wouldn't classify these as cheesy reenactments.  The characters stand there; they don't pretend to do anything.  This series may stand out for its 3D recollections of Native architecture.

The work does state that the Spanish were ruthless and zealous in ways that the French, British, and Dutch weren't in their colonial dominations.  Still, at one point, they say, ""The Spanish studied Aztec culture and customs, writing more about them than any foreign culture had been discussed before.""  Other works say the Aztecs had their own writings, called codices, that the Spanish destroyed in order to dominate them.  Much more could have been known about Aztecs if the Spanish hadn't been so merciless.  So I do think the work, in this instance, let these conquerors off the hook.

This work is made by Brits and possibly for Brits.  The interviewees pronounce words that end with ""-a"" as if they ended with ""-er.""  They measure things using the metric system, rather than the good-ole, old-school American way.  In fact, if you don't understand thick European accents, you might want to avoid seeing this work.",1170115200,5,1893,4.8930817610062896
