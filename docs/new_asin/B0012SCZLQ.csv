8247643,1,B0012SCZLQ,"This appears to be little more than an hour long promotional video for Mr. Friend's martial arts school. The quality of the video is very grainy, and Mr. Ground repeatedly refers to the video itself as a tape, leading me to believe it is about twenty years old. There is very little in the way of instruction, just a few demonstrations. The only good experience I had was that the good people at Amazon were kind enough to refund my money. There are some much better JKD videos streaming on Amazon.",1401926400,,498,4.483516483516484
8247644,5,B0012SCZLQ,"I've tried several videos and worked with different coaches.  ""Advanced Boxing, Jeet Kune Do Evelution Series""  is excellent.

This will work fine for a beginner. If you are an experienced boxer you will enjoy it too.  Almost has a street fighting twist but legitimate for boxing.  It's far aside from a traditional ""1-1, 1-1-2, 1-2-3"" video.

This vid does a good job of explaining the natural evolution of your skills.  He walks you through how your defense and punching become single movements and are actually muscle memory, doing the work without you having to think through the motions.  The mental development is tied in progressively with the physical drills.

If you are determined, want to really get a flow and natural fighting ability This is the best vid I've seen.  Great cardio workout too.  If you can progress through this video, training a few nights a week, you'll have an arsenal in your fists, pretty soon.  Like I now do!!",1219708800,2,944,4.83125
