8029701,5,B0002NY8CQ,"These are very cute stories mainly for the 3 - 6 year old crowd.  How do dinosaurs say goodnight? sometimes very naughtily at times.  Zin Zin A Violin would be of great use to music teachers.  The other stories as A Big, Big Pond and All of the Colors of the Earth are very good stories too.  Altogether, a very nice DVD, like all Scholastic DVDs.",1225497600,,347,4.212121212121212

8029703,3,B0002NY8CQ,"I was hoping there would be more ""How Do Dinosaurs Say..."" stories on the DVD but there isn't. My 3-yr-old son and 4.5-yr-old daughter still enjoy watching them, though not as often as the Very Hungry Caterpillar DVD.",1192665600,,217,4.7368421052631575
8029704,5,B0002NY8CQ,"this is a favorite at bedtime. We have most of the series and this is a consistent must-read. there is also a video of the book distributed by scholastic (I think). It has the same illustrations as the book, some animation with someone reading the book. Anyone with kids that love dinosaurs will find this is a great read and speaks to a kid's imagination.",1189987200,,356,4.492307692307692
