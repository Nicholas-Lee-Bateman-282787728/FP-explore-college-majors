347998,5,6301750705,"A great ""movie"" for 1944!  Lots of action, good plot, a beautiful Zorro babe.  Too bad she didn't make more Zorro films.  Would have enjoyed getting intoher hot little outfit.  We need a modern-day  female Zorro.  If you enjoy westerns, action-packed movies, good guys v.  bad guys, or exciting women, you will like this ""movie""!",935020800,6,329,4.872727272727273
348077,2,6301750705,"No matter what you may think of this Linda Sterling adventure serial, consider that:
1.) ECHO BRIDGE's reported time of 177 minutes is a full half-hour less than this 12 chapter cliffhanger originally ran.
2.) The company inserts an intermittent watermark at lower screen right.
3.) No sign of restoration on any of their antique film dubs, so quality is solely dependent on source material.

Caveat emptor.",1279324800,3,407,5.074626865671642
348078,5,6301750705,"This is a fun serial that takes place in Idaho before it becomes a state.  It is packed with action and an entertaining plot.  Serials are done in such a way so that each chapter has a suspenseful ending, which in the next chapter turns out differently than the way one is led to believe.  This one is especially good as it features Linda Stirling as the ""Black Whip"" who takes over the masked riding after her brother, who initially donned the mask, dies of a gunshot wound.  She rides in disguise and brings  law and order to a Wild West setting,  helping Idaho vote for statehood.  It is fun and clean and entertaining.  It doesn't get much better than this!",1214092800,2,661,4.404958677685951
348079,5,6301750705,"Just be aware that this has absolutely nothing to do with the Zorro character.  Not only is Zorro not present, he isn't even mentioned.  They really should have called it ""The Black Whip,"" but apparently they wanted the name recongition for the box office.

That said, it's a terrific Western.  The Black Whip is a black-costumed vigilante who's talented with a whip and rides madly around saving people in the nick of time--more reminiscent of the Durango Kid than of Zorro.  The Black Whip is a woman, no less, but no one realizes it.  This is the only serial you'll ever see where the hero gets killed in the first chapter!  He's immediately replaced by his sister, who seeks revenge.

While William Witney was away in the service during World War II, Spencer Bennet and Wallace Grissell did a good job of keeping up Republic's tradition of great fistfights and chases--hardly a piece of furniture is left standing after these fights.  The cliffhangers are very good as well; I particularly liked the explosives thrown down into a tent, the pitchfork on an unconscious victim, and the creeping flames in the mine tunnel.  I also like the way the villain got taken care of at the end.

The beautiful Linda Stirling (real name Loraine Schultz, 1921-1997) earned her title ""Queen of the Serials"" doing a whole bunch of them for Republic in the 1940's.  George J. Lewis, who usually played villians, is a questionable choice for Linda's leading man--he's okay, but I could have thought of several who would have been better for the part of hero.  Francis McDonald is an excellent villain, and the ever-present Hal Taliaferro is good as Baxter, one of his henchmen.  Yakima Canutt is listed as second unit director, so you can bet he either did some of the stunts or at least set them up.

And by the way, can someone tell me how the bad guys can do hand-to-hand combat with the Black Whip and not realize there's a woman under that costume?",1136678400,4,1939,4.678466076696165

It showed at a theater called the Riottoe, later came to be called the Ranch. 11 Pennington Ave, Trenton. NJ. For kids under twelve a nickel over twelve a dime. We never related the Black Whip with Zorro. I am sixty five and I was seven when I first saw the Black Whip,fifty eight years ago and today I still would like to see Zorro's Black Whip.

348082,5,6301750705,"This is among the best of the western serials.  It doesn't really follow the Zorro tradition either storywise or in geographical setting.  But it has some of the best western serial action you'll find.  As far as having a female Zorro type character, why not?  Hey, Linda does quite well for herself as a dashing heroine.  And the minor characters, such as the newspaper editor, add much to the fun.  This is for enjoyment and not for nitpicking.",1008979200,19,446,4.653846153846154
348083,4,6301750705,"Idaho ~ 1889. While the honest citizens stop growing spuds long enough to foster statehood, dastardly elements in the community try to frustrate the process for their own greedy reasons. Into this conflict rides the Black Whip and saves the day, repeatedly. Let's set the record straight. This 12-chapter serial is guilty of a misnomer. The Black Whip is a mysterious masked rider, but not Zorro. After all, what would Zorro, the hero of Old California, be doing in Idaho territory in 1889? Anyway, Western adventure fans will enjoy the hard-riding, slam-bang action sequences of this breathless serial. The legendary Yakima Canutt is the second unit director, which explains the great stunt work. Typical of all serials, the threadbare plot is merely an excuse for the fast-paced action. George Lewis later played Guy Williams' father in Disney's '50s version of the Zorro legend. Nobody could make Grade B Westerns like Republic Pictures. This may be the only Western set in Idaho. Relax and enjoy the ""to-be-continued"" nonsense. ;-)",1008547200,9,1035,5.166666666666667
348084,4,6301750705,"Lovely Linda Stirling, fresh from her starring role in Republic's ""Tiger Woman"" serial, got to play another athletic female. As noted in other reviews, this serial has nothing to do with Zorro, except mentioning the name in the title and the similarity of outfits for the masked rider. It's a traditional western with a masked hero known as the Black Whip, who is fatally wounded (!) in the first chapter, limps back to his secret cave, and dies -- only to have his sister take over his mission, combating outlaws who are trying to run the territory and keep out statehood. The undercover operative hero is competently played by George Lewis, usually seen as a bad guy (although he was Zorro's sidekick in the future Republic serial, ""Ghost of Zorro,"" and Zorro's father in the Disney TV series). He and Linda Stirling make a terrific team. In the last scene of the first chapter, they save each other's lives about three times in a two-minute wagon chase sequence.",979948800,8,965,4.75
348085,3,6301750705,"Not only does Zorro not get mentioned at all, why the silly title, as the story has nothing to do with him. The central character is a masked female avenger played by the very capable Linda Sterling. The title should be  ""The Black Whip"", as this is what the heroine is known. Another  disappointment is that the episode cliff-hangers are weak and the serial  also lacks the atmosphere and pulse-pounding soundtrack music of the  Republic Classic Serials such as, Zorro's Fighting Legion, Spy Smasher,  Nyoka and the Tigermen, just to name a few. The redeeming factors here are  the action sequences that are well handled and there are plenty of  fisticuffs, good stunt work coupled with some rough riding from our  heroine. The story-line is good, and has all the ingredients of a good  action packed western.",954201600,7,810,4.854014598540146
