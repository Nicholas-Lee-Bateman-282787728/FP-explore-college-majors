So I did some research and came across these DVD's Part one and two. When i Got my package i popped The first one in When that was done I popped the Second one and by the time i finished watching this set of dvd's i said i can do this. I got a called from a customer of mines and he asked me if i know of any one that can build him a fiberglass box for his car. I said well I'm getting ready to put my hand in too this fiberglass To build a box for my truck to see hoe it comes out he said well you can use my car as your test dummy. I Agreed we did the box for his car and got it painted at my uncles body shop and it came out great. This product was very informational,They even tell you the tools needed,type of materials needed and how to get your project on the road. This is one of those products that it is worth the money and time. All you need is will power ,time,and patience and a imagination that would make people think how did he come up with this.

Here are the the product links

8457679,5,B0009F4Z1Q,"I ordered the complete set of dvd's from this company via their website. I had in the back of my mind that I would like to learn fiberglass fabrication but I was mostly interested in basic car stereo installation and remote start (those are two of the others in the set of five). Anyway, it turns out these (vol 1 and 2) are the best of the set. I was really really impressed with this video. I feel totally confidant that with a few more viewings of the video I could make almost any shape for whatever I needed. Fiberglass is one of the most amazing materials. Total creative freedom. I should mention I haven't tried any of the projects yet but hope to very soon. Actually I've had the videos less then a week. My first will probably be the custom door panels that they show in this video. I recently bought new diamond audio 5.25 and am really excited to change the sound stage in my accord.

Aspects of DVD:

Quality of video - Home movie quality

Quality of sound - Narrative style instruction, easy to understand

Length - approx 57 min

Content - Starts with materials and equipment needed. Then goes into demonstration of 3 fiberglass builds. First is a molded sub enclosure for the corner of a trunk. Second is an amp rack / sub enclosure for the trunk using three subs. And third is custom door panels. That's the one i was most interested in.

Bottom line - I feel these are really well done and takes someone from no idea at all to competent beginner.",1190419200,5,1464,4.3837638376383765
