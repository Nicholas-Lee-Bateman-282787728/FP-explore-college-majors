8603074,5,B001E487LA,"This is a unique and excellent DVD.  It is an eye opener for every Martial Artist or individual who trains in street self defense.  As with all the DVD's produced by Shihan Michael Pace in his Street Self Defense series, he has again taken a unique topic and applied it to everyday situations.  The use of everyday items as potential defensive weapons and how and where to use them against an aggressor could very well save your life.  A must Have!",1220572800,,448,4.493827160493828

I really enjoy the series, and recently met Shihan Pace to thank him for the confidence he has provided me and my wife.  These videos have really made a difference",1219017600,2,310,4.5
