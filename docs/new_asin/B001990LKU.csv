3425488,5,B001990LKU,"I agree with the others, when is Season 2 of C & L going to be released.
I love this show.  I am fortunate that it runs every morning on my local digital station...but I want the original shows on DVD so I can watch them any time of day.  Come on people.....Many other shows are released on DVD that DO NOT hold a candle to this Quality show.  PLEASE release all the C&L seasons On DVD.",1275091200,,386,3.987012987012987
3425489,5,B001990LKU,"This has to be on of the greatest TV shows ever! This is a show with tough, amazing multi dimensional women, brilliant actresses, amazing storylines and powerful scripts. Cagney and Lacey ran for 6 years and never lost its edge or more importantly its humanity. The contrast of 2 very different women whose chemistry together as working partners is one of the greatest duos imaginable. It is so true with the saying ""Without Cagney and Lacey Thelma and Louise would have unimaginable""

I am still amazed it is 2 years since the 1st season was released. Come on studio execs we are eagerly awaiting the next season. It is fantastic we have the ""Menopause Years"" DVD to look forward to but this is no substitute for not having the whole series available on DVD.",1252540800,8,759,4.664179104477612
3425490,5,B001990LKU,"Cagney & Lacey is a must-see-TV!

So I want more! Season 1 was not enough, I want more drama, more Cagney-Isbecki interractions, more humor, and more old-time cop-drama fun!",1225238400,6,173,4.9655172413793105
3425491,5,B001990LKU,Please be a little swifter in bringing more of this series to DVD. I have almost worn out the first season dvd from watching it so much.,1215475200,3,136,4.074074074074074
3425492,5,B001990LKU,"I have watched Season 2 of C&L many times. There is no doubt that the series is one of the very best in television. 26 years later, fans still rave about it and newcomers who see it are enthralled. This is one show that is still serious, relevant, funny, and controversial.

Season 2 has only 7 episodes of quality television programming but still addresses such topics as pornography, illegal adoptions, pregnancy, a police labor strike, and one of the lead characters (Cagney) is shot in the line of duty. Each episode provokes the viewer to actually think about the issues involved.  And the tension that often occurs between the characters generates emotion ...and humor.

During the 6 years that this show ran, the two leads, Tyne Daly(4) and Sharon Gless(2) won the Emmy for best dramatic actress each year. It would be FANTASTIC to buy the studio release of this series. A whole new generation of fans are waiting for this release. THE BEST Series EVER!",1210550400,9,960,4.771084337349397

3425526,1,B001990LKU,"After receiving this set I was astonished to discover that there were only SIX episodes in the collection and they were all from the shortened season 3????
Here's a translation guide..
It turns out if you go on line and look up a C&G episode guide it'll list the Foster/Switt Season as 1
Season 2 with Gless/Daly says 'The true beginning"" and is these people's Vol. 1
Season 3 is labeled on the top of this page as 'Season 2', but in the fine print they tell you it's actually season 3 but they call Vol. 2.
Season 4 is labeled on this site as 'Season 3' at the top of the page, but any episode guide will tell you it's season 4 or as they call it Vol. 3.
Confused? Not as much as I was angry!",1402617600,7,693,4.028985507246377

3425530,5,B001990LKU,When Cagney and Lacey came on TV back in the 80's I was so hooked right away. I love police shows of the 80's to today. This is one my favorites. I am so glad it finally got on DVD!,1388880000,2,181,3.55
3425531,5,B001990LKU,I watched this show growing up and was so excited to see the seasons finally coming out on DVD.  A definite addition to my library.,1383868800,2,131,4.24

3425545,5,B001990LKU,I used to watch their show every week when it was on TV.  They are great stories and the 2 women are great together.,1368662400,,116,3.8333333333333335

3425547,1,B001990LKU,"Unfortunately, this was very dissapointing as it is not the""complete second series""! It is only contains 2 discs. Cheers to Amazon for giving me a full refund, but they should change the description as it is very misleading. Not sure how it works in the United States, but it is against the law to advertise something different to what the product is in Australia.",1364083200,2,364,4.703125
3425548,2,B001990LKU,"I waited so long for this second season to come out on DVD and was very disappointed that it only contained 7 episodes. The price should be lower because it contains so few episodes. What was even worse was that disc 2 was defective and was not able to be viewed. I sent it back for a new one, but that was defective as well!!! The company that produces these DVDs should be made aware and produce new copies without defects!! I love this show and still would like to have this season on DVD.",1363910400,15,492,4.189473684210526
3425549,1,B001990LKU,"I love Cagney and Lacey and was glad to see the show come out on DVD.  The episodes on Season 2 are less than the other seasons for some reason.  Also, those of us who bought Season 2 have distorted pictures and cannot view.

There were were lines through the scenes and could not be seen with out interruption. I was very disappointed because I waited so long for it. I would like a replacement for it. Please see what you can do. I usually have good luck with my dvd's, this was a disappointment.

3425553,2,B001990LKU,"Great show but it would have been nice to know up front that season 2 is just 7 episodes.  I paid about the same amount for season 1, a full season, plus each episode was sub-titled (no sub-titles in season 2).",1357603200,,210,4.121951219512195

3425565,5,B001990LKU,I bought season 1 when it came out a few years ago. I think the show was one of the best on TV at the time.  Why are they not releasing the rest of the series? I don't want it on digital download.. I want it on DVD. What's the hold up?,1341014400,,235,3.519230769230769

Bearing in mind that so much dreck has been created in the interim, it is incredibly frustrating.

3425572,5,B001990LKU,"I guess I was foolish to have bought season 1 of Cagney and Lacey.  I love the series, but I barely watch my dvd of season one because it is not complete.  I feel like I wasted my money.  You know my thinking is, if you are going to put out a season of a show on dvd then by all means finish what you start.  Why keep the fans,who really love this show and got all excited when you released the first season, disappointed and left incomplete.  I have given up hope that they will release the rest and I'll be too old to care by the time they do or dvds will be a thing of the past like vhs. KER7373@gmail.com",1310688000,,608,3.910569105691057

That's because there WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE A SEASON 2.  A massive letter writing campaign from fans brought the series back from the dead. CBS had cancelled the show after the first season because of poor ratings. No kidding? They were up against Monday Night Football!! DUH!! Well, they ran the reruns during the summer and guess what? The ratings were great! The First Season received 3 Emmy Nominations- Best Drama - Best Actress times two with both SHARON GLESS and TYNE DALY Nominated and DALY Winning.

The writers for this series were good - they make the personal experiences of the actors feel true and right. They deal with everyday issues and concerns in a realistic and plausible way.
