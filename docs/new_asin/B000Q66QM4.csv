2832541,5,B000Q66QM4,"This exercise video does exactly what it advertises.  It is a beginning strength development exercise for the whole body.  It is wonderful to get what you expected when you purchase a DVD.  Lovely background, pleasant voice, clear instructions on what each exercise is working on and how to perform that exercise.  Can't go wrong with this.",1223683200,11,340,5.017857142857143
2832542,4,B000Q66QM4,"I think this is a great DVD, but I wish there had been an index so I could go to each exercise depending uppon what I wanted to do that day. Now I have to watch the whole thing and write down when each exercise occurs so I can skip around. Other than that, it's well worth it.",1223337600,11,276,3.7758620689655173
2832543,5,B000Q66QM4,"I really enjoyed the instructor Mirabai Holland. She is calm, friendly, and not as hyper as a lot of the other instructors. With her fabulous, trim looks, she is also a great role model for her workout. In her instruction, she makes sure that you complete each exercise in correct form and with correct breathing. Having back problems, I appreciated her frequent references to protecting the lower back.",1217548800,17,403,4.9411764705882355
2832544,4,B000Q66QM4,"I bought this for my mom and she watched it and liked the music, moves and scenery.  The moves are explained clearly and slowly.  A good starter work-out.",1213747200,7,154,4.464285714285714
2832545,5,B000Q66QM4,"Without a doubt one of the best workout videos I've used.  Emphasis is focused on specific muscle groups, and the pace is designed to get maximum benefit from each movement.  I will definitely look for more Mirabai Holland videos.",1208736000,12,230,4.871794871794871
2832546,5,B000Q66QM4,"I really like this DVD. I am older, heavier, and also have Fibrolmyalgia. This was a 'just right' workout for me. I think I could go on to more streneous work now.",1202428800,43,163,4.125
2832547,5,B000Q66QM4,"Doing Mirabai's strength exercises at home is WAY better than going to the gym! This video combines educational information - so you'll know why you're doing this and how you'll benefit - with easy, helpful exercises. If you're not strong to begin with, don't worry. Mirabai lets you ease into it. The video is divided into categories, so if you just feel like doing a certain type - the upper body strength exercises are my favorite - that's OK, too. I LOVE this video!",1181692800,77,470,4.607142857142857
2832548,5,B000Q66QM4,"Mirabai's experience, knowledge, expertise, and enthusiasm make this sculpting and strength training DVD a magnificent experience. The surroundings and music make this a delight to follow, and the actual sculpting and training is easy as well as effective! Fabulous, indeed!",1181001600,29,274,5.875
2832549,5,B000Q66QM4,"This video is fabulous (forever)!  It's like getting a private lesson from Mirabai Holland.  There's lots of information besides the great workout.  It's perfect for people who are new to exercise or who are coming back after a hiatus, with a lot of support and instruction.  And the music and the scenery are super!",1180828800,46,316,4.796296296296297
2832550,5,B000Q66QM4,This is a 5-star program! The music is wonderful! The setting is divine! Mirabai Holland is the ULTIMATE teacher!!! You learn about muscles and excercise in a thourough and enervating presentation. Everyone should indulge and learn how to excercise with Mirabai Holland!,1180656000,20,270,5.4523809523809526
2832551,5,B000Q66QM4,This is a very easy to use exercise program.  It is easy to begin the program with no weights at all and to build up to using considerably more weights or to keep it very easy.  It has made a big difference for me and led me to do more exercise and to be stronger than I've been in years.,1282867200,4,288,3.783333333333333
2832552,3,B000Q66QM4,"I enjoyed her pace the 1st day - understanding that going really slow can actually be more beneficial in developing strength, than fast repetitions.  However, I started making modifications by day 2.  Now, after watching it every other day, for about 3 weeks, I have started putting it on mute (music becomes annoying & is too much in the forefront).  Some of the modifications I had to incorporate (because her movements are so SLOW) were adding hand weights, or adding arms (when there were just leg exercises) or adding repetitions by going faster.  The best part of her routine is the peaceful background of the ocean with boats bobbing up & down.  Mirabai's voice, although pleasant, is a bit condescending - as if we are children being told we are doing such a good job.  If you have never exercised before or you are recovering from being sick, it would be a GREAT exercise video!",1257120000,15,887,4.690322580645161
2832553,5,B000Q66QM4,I'm over 50 and found this DVD to be just what I was looking for. It's really easy to follow and the stretches and moves are perfect for older bodies. You can do this workout without really hurting yourself!,1247270400,6,207,4.333333333333333
2832554,5,B000Q66QM4,"It's a nice work-out dvd although a little too basic for me. It's really for beginners and the pace is slow, but it's true to the title.",1244851200,3,136,4.074074074074074
2832555,5,B000Q66QM4,This is a wonderful work-out for the 50+.  Very instructive and easy to fit into a busy routine.  Exercises are not hard to follow and as you get stronger you can add more weights to make it more challenging.  Definitely worth the time and effort.,1241827200,5,247,4.444444444444445
2832556,3,B000Q66QM4,it's ok.,1241395200,,8,3.5
2832557,5,B000Q66QM4,"I've never been a big fan of weight training, but it's supposed to be a good way to prevent bone loss, so I thought I ought to be doing it.  Fortunately, Mirabai Holland has a video for it that makes it easy.

The great thing about all of Mirabai Holland's exercise videos is her Moving Free style of exercise.  It is just is so easy to progress from one thing to another, to increase effort without even being aware that you are doing it.  It is enjoyable and pain free.  You can start out with light weights or no weight at all and just build up slowly.  I haven't been doing this routine for long, so I'm still on rather light weights, but I expect to be able to progress pretty rapidly, given my wonderful experiences with other Mirabai Holland videos.

Again, I have to say that the location shots are a big part of the video.  I feel like I am there, and the locations are just so peaceful and invigorating.",1241049600,9,913,4.267441860465116
2832558,5,B000Q66QM4,"This DVD has changed my life.  I'm 62 and used to feel like 82.  After finishing this DVD I feel like 42.  I had no idea how atrophied my muscles were until I saw the difference after completing the DVD.  Mirabel's voice is so soothing and her complete explanations of each movement assure me that I am getting the most from the routines without causing injury.  Only a few of the exercises are strenuous.  For the most part you won't break a sweat, but will still feel like a million dollars when you are done.",1229817600,34,511,4.326315789473684
2832559,3,B000Q66QM4,"I like the low-key approach, nice setting, but the exercises were nothing new, nothing special.  I probably won't be using this DVD on a regular basis.",1229472000,4,151,4.8076923076923075
2832560,5,B000Q66QM4,"Mirabai Holland really knows what she is doing, and knows how to communicate it. I've had many, many exercise videos over the years, and this is better than all of them put together. Her routines are well rounded, and you can feel the difference. Whether you are a very-beginner or very-experienced at working out, this program fits, and it evolves as you do. Ms. Holland is most pleasant. I look forward to going home every day to exercise with her. I continue to improve and grow in understanding about the benefits of her program. It just makes sense! I'm so grateful that I have found what I believe to be a lifetime of physical health maintenance.",1226275200,24,652,4.629310344827586

8194600,5,B000Q66QM4,"I am a 70 year old female recovering from a mastectomy.  This is the greatest workout ever.
My core is so week that I am unable to do the floor portion of this video - YET!  I will get there!
Currently I do the warm up, leg  exercise, and the arm exercises with the hope of being able to
to do the floor portion soon.",1362096000,,317,3.8461538461538463
8194601,5,B000Q66QM4,"I have five DVDs by Mirabai Holland. Each is filled with different, unique and very benificial exercises.
This video is 55 minutes long and will get you your daily dose of  exercise all right. I enjoy doing each one, because Mirabai is very special teacher, you feel like exercising next with her, and the beautiful surroundings let you feel like being there as well.",1337126400,,367,4.734375
8194602,4,B000Q66QM4,"This workout is great for beginners; like me that need to take it slow. As you progress you can add weights or do more reps to increase your workout. We all have to start somewhere; and this is a good start for ladies that have not worked out in a while, have stationary job or have had injuries that keep you from being as active as you should be for your best health. Good luck; just keep with it at your own pace.",1334534400,2,416,4.024096385542169
