5192148,5,B008YT8QYG,Sean Bean makes a very good Sharpe and it's fun to see how they did some of the scenes from the books!,1392681600,,102,3.6818181818181817
5192149,5,B008YT8QYG,"The entire series incorporated excellent acting, outstanding stories, and terrific production and camera work.  I couldn't wait to watch each of the five segments. The bonus which detailed some of the series' production techniques was particularly interesting.  Sean Bean and the variety of characters portrayed  added a glue which held my attention throughout.

I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys crackling good stories.",1391558400,,437,5.676923076923077
5192150,5,B008YT8QYG,"A bit expensive, but the series is great.  The main fault is the color in the beginning episodes is not as bright and clear as in the Sharpe post-series films.  The color does improve about midway through the series, but is not as good as the Hornblower series by BBC.  After watching it you will not be too concerned about the color.  There are complaints that it does not follow the book. First, its fiction and second the author approved of the changes and even the two post-series films about Sharpe in India although in his books he was a younger man then and not an officer.  If your concerned about fictional accuracy, don't read the books!  For that matter how many versions are their of El Cid,  the Alamo (which is not fiction), Superman, and the Lone Ranger?  Except for being overpriced there is really nothing wrong with the series.",1388534400,5,845,4.549668874172186
5192151,1,B008YT8QYG,"This series is my Wife's favorite so I did some research, but obviously not enough.
The various editions of this miniseries are marketed in a very confusing manner.
Some promoted as  ""Sharp's Collection"" do not have the entire miniseries included, you have to carefully read the description, runtime and number of disks included.

Sharp's Rifle Collection Set(2005) is listed as having 5 discs, but a runtime of 102 minutes. - $149.95
Sharp's Complete Series is listed as having 15 films and 8 DVD boxes with a runtime of 25 HOURS  - $50.88 ???

The second one doesn't matter because it is in PAL (European) format and won't play on a North American DVD player.
I'm not sure why it is even listed.
Many of the box covers are very similar in appearance, its hard to tell by looking at it on screen.
I don't think it is intentional, but its probably something they don't want to fix.
I wanted to buy the entire series for my wife and found the DVD set for  $195.00
After some searching I was able to find the Bluray for $229.50, expensive but better than DVD.
It also had a reproduction map, pewter letter opener and behind the scenes discs.
With shipping and exchange rate, the total was $352.33.
Yesterday I found the DVD Set, runtime 25 hours at Costco in Ontario Canada for $50.00.
I don't think the Bluray edition /Letter opener/ fold out Map/behind the scenes discs are worth $179.00 (no shipping or exchange rate).
I think I will return this.",1387411200,46,1447,4.593023255813954
5192152,5,B008YT8QYG,Its great that the Sharpe's collection is now on blu ray! Packaging is nice a nice size. One of the best series ever made.,1382572800,8,122,4.125
5192153,5,B008YT8QYG,I purchased this as a gift. I have noticed that a new episode is being watched every evening. He gets quite annoyed when I interrupt his viewing. That means it is a great success as a gift for him. Glad I found this. Maybe I'll have to watch it myself.,1381795200,12,252,4.06
5192154,5,B008YT8QYG,"This set is wonderful.  Watched them with hubby who is a Sharpe fan of the books and who saw a few of these a long time ago.  It was his birthday present but I fell in love with Sean Bean's youthful Sharpe even as I have loved his other later performances in Game of Thrones, LOTR and Troy.  Acting is great and action terrific, especially as they were originally TV shows in GB shot on very tight money.  YAY! GB and this collection.",1371081600,10,434,4.192771084337349
5192155,5,B008YT8QYG,"I'd read all the books, and thought the DVDs were of the same quality.  The costumes and equipment shown in all the episodes were authentic and first rate.",1361232000,16,155,4.535714285714286
5192156,5,B008YT8QYG,I had originally bought the set on tape. Took up too much room. Laying out over $200 for something I already had shows what I thought of the collection.,1445904000,,152,4.275862068965517
5192157,4,B008YT8QYG,I get tired of Sharpe having to get involved with a woman in every episode but overall enjoy the series.  This picture on this copy is a bit more soft focus than I like though.,1437350400,,176,4.0285714285714285
5192158,5,B008YT8QYG,Excellent,1436572800,,9,9.0
5192159,3,B008YT8QYG,Nothing like the books... the sequence is completely askew. I'm sorry I bought this.,1434240000,,84,5.071428571428571
5192160,5,B008YT8QYG,It is a very good series.  I have already watched it twice,1431302400,,58,3.8333333333333335
5192161,4,B008YT8QYG,"This is one of my favorite series. Sean Bean has does a great job as Richard Sharpe. Some of the acting can get kind of meh a times, but its still great fun! There are difference from the books, but I would say it stays true to what Sharpe is really about. The quality of the Blu-rays definitely beats the DVD, however in the first couple of episodes, there is a lot of film grain and some background noise. However, if your looking for the best viewing experience for the series, this is it. The Map and letter opener included adds a nice touch, but probably isn't really necessary. The price is relatively high, but in the end, it was worth it.",1431216000,,646,4.30327868852459
5192162,5,B008YT8QYG,Exciting action.  Good Character development.  Sharpe always gets the crap kicked out of him though.  O'Malley is great.,1431129600,,120,5.555555555555555
5192163,5,B008YT8QYG,Great!,1430265600,,6,6.0

5192165,5,B008YT8QYG,Excellent,1422662400,,9,9.0
5192166,4,B008YT8QYG,I purchased this as a gift. My friend who liked the Sharpe's series likes the show very much but says the sound on the DVD is poor.,1421884800,,131,3.888888888888889
5192167,4,B008YT8QYG,"So far I have thoroughly enjoyed the series.  Sean Bean is phenomenal in the lead role.  I had previously recorded the series on VHS from PBS, but only had a handful of the movies.  The reason I only ranked the collection 4 out of 5 Stars is the video quality is terrible for Blu ray.  I would have expected a series that costs over a hundred dollars more, for the Blu Ray version to have been digitally remastered.  My old VCR tapes were less grainy.  The video quality does seem to improve in the later movies, slightly.

Overall a great series, but save your money and buy the Standard DVD version.",1421020800,,601,4.36036036036036
5192168,5,B008YT8QYG,Magnificent collection--all the episodes plus an extra disc showing how they made them. The authentic map and sword-letter opener are nice touches. Sharpe fans will love this. It's worth every penny.,1420243200,,199,5.451612903225806
5192169,5,B008YT8QYG,Rec'd in a timely manner and as described in sales info.,1418515200,,56,4.181818181818182
5192170,5,B008YT8QYG,Sharpe's was on PBS years ago. It was so fantastic  I had to have them for my husband and me to watch. They are WONDERFUL,1417996800,,121,3.84
5192171,4,B008YT8QYG,"I've only watched the first 3 episodes, but so far I'm really enjoying them. The musical soundtrack for the series is rather strange, however. It's a hodge-podge. There's some electric guitar, some Irish tin whistles and some orchestral passages. It comes across as a bit strange. But overall, I'm having a good time with it.",1413331200,,325,4.927272727272728
5192172,5,B008YT8QYG,Great stories better than average,1413072000,,33,5.8
5192173,5,B008YT8QYG,"Great, Made for TV, video's. For a real Film see Waterloo by Bondarchuk",1410220800,,71,4.538461538461538
5192174,5,B008YT8QYG,The set contains all the dvds that you mentioned with the exception of Peril and Challenge which I bought separately.  The set also contains Sharpe's challenge and Sharpe's shooting.  The sets were new as they were packed in shrink rap.  I bought them from importcds@amazon.com and were blu ray dvds,1410048000,,299,4.94
5192175,5,B008YT8QYG,This is one of those rare series that matches up very well with the books that are covered.,1409788800,,91,4.111111111111111
5192176,5,B008YT8QYG,"While I have not purchased the set YET, I have seen most--if not all--of the Series and am looking to add it to my collection. However, I needed to ask anyone who has made this purchase: It is not listed in the description the titles of the sets included, and I know several ""collections"" say they are ""complete"" but often are missing one or more sets. Could anyone tell me if this set includes all 16 sets? They are: Sharpe's Rifles, Eagle, Company, Enemy, Honour, Gold, Battle, Sword, Regiment, Siege, Mission, Revenge, Justice, Waterloo, Challenge, Peril.",1409443200,2,558,4.822916666666667

5192178,2,B008YT8QYG,"We enjoyed the first couple of series but the 3rd and 4th series had defective discs and we sent them back.  Never saw the whole series, were very dissappointed .",1404432000,2,162,4.4
5192179,5,B008YT8QYG,Other versions of this awesome series were only in PAL format used in the UK and did not work here in the US.  This one is 100% NTSC and works great.  This is a really good miniseries for the man cave.,1403568000,,201,3.8780487804878048
5192180,5,B008YT8QYG,"Lots of history in these stories, and a look into an earlier time period.  My fiancee and I both love this series, and either one of us can randomly slip one in the DVD player and recall the major events, and the character's personal joys or travails at our leisure.  Although some episodes we enjoy more than others, they're all good!  And, Sean Bean at his peak - what more is there to say?",1403136000,,392,4.27027027027027

5192182,4,B008YT8QYG,I had seen a few episodes on a BBC channel and have read a few of B. Cornwell's books.  Now I have the DVD collection.  Wonderful series.  I do have a hard time catching everything they are saying but I can play the episode again to catch everything.  The sound at the beginning is loud then into the program I find myself turning up the volume.  I would definitely recommend this series. The letter opener works well and the period map is interesting.,1396915200,,452,4.397590361445783
5192183,5,B008YT8QYG,"If you are into history, action, and good movies, then this is the one for you... I could not stop watching each film and was unhappy when it was over... Wish the series was 100 times longer...",1396569600,8,193,4.243243243243243
5192184,5,B008YT8QYG,"I rented #8 from Netflix because i was looking for movies with James Purefoy and/or Sean Bean.  Did not realize it was part of a series, but I got hooked and after watching a couple more thru Netflix decided why wait....and bought the set.  Great series and you learn a little history along the way.  Sean Bean is wonderful as the hero, Richard Sharpe.  Makes me want to read the novel it was based on.",1393200000,,402,4.32
5192185,5,B008YT8QYG,"Or ""Boney vs. Nosey"" ... Anyway, I loved this show when it was first aired and I bought the Blu Ray so I could watch it all again. Sean Bean as what you might call a Special Forces soldier fighting Napoleon in Wellington's English army. It's great, really.",1392940800,,256,4.354166666666667

8532731,5,B008YT8QYG,Watched a couple of episodes on YouTube and decided that I had to have the entire set of Sharpe's on DVD to enjoy a better quality video.,1481500800,,137,4.111111111111111
8532732,4,B008YT8QYG,I purchased this DVD because I wanted it.,1471910400,,41,4.25
8532733,5,B008YT8QYG,"This collection is one of the best I have ever seen. Sharpe is the infantry version of the British war against the Napoleon. It represents a parallel to
the Horatio Hornblower series.  Sharpe does for the common soldier what Hornblower does for the common sailor. These two series give a beautiful picture of English warfare in the period from 1800 to 1815.",1458864000,,357,4.758064516129032

8532737,5,B008YT8QYG,The only way this could be better was if it was in high definition!,1450137600,,67,3.857142857142857
8532738,5,B008YT8QYG,It is a timeless classic series. Greaqt Adventure.,1448064000,,50,5.375
8532739,4,B008YT8QYG,"This review is in regards to the BLU-RAY Sharpe's Classic Collection set only. It was truly wonderful to see the Sharpe's series with the clarity of Blu-Ray. As others have noted, this set includes all of the films up to and including Sharpe's Waterloo, includes Sharpe's Legacy (a 90 min retrospective told from the viewpoint of Rifleman Cooper) & Sharpe's Shooting (a 25 min ""making of"" documentary). Sharpe's Legacy & Sharpe's Shooting are both DVD disks, not Blu-Ray despite Sharpe's Legacy being in a Blu-Ray case (for completion I suppose) although Sharpe's Shooting comes in a thinner, but larger DVD thin-pack casing (due to space considerations I suppose). The set DOES NOT include the later films of Sharpe's Challenge or Sharpe's Peril although I've noticed that if you find somewhere else to keep the 25 minute Sharpe's Shooting documentary and the collectors map that you have enough space to squeeze those last two in there if you want to get creative.

The box it comes in is quite sturdy and fits everything quite well. The letter opener is made of solid steel (or some other such metal) and is quite heavy as well as ... well, it's not sharp (no pun intended) but really pointy so use caution. The folded map that it comes with is a reproduction of a map from 1814 showing the UK, Germany, Poland, France, Italy, part of Spain on the one end and part of the Austria-Hungarian empire on the other. It's actually quite large and looks to be roughly 3 feet x 3 feet in size and comes with a letter of authenticity. It's so nice I may get it framed :)

If there is one complaint to be had, it's the complete and total lack of any sort of subtitles whatsoever. For those of you that are hard of hearing or just have a couple of screaming children this may be an issue. For my own part I've spent too much time in the engineering spaces that the subtitles come in handy on occasion. Same with the screaming children lol, the subtitles come in handy then too ha ha. Another minor quibble is that it gives you zero choice for any audio quality selection. The menu only lets you A) Choose one of the two movies B) Choose the scene selection for that movie or C) Play that movie and that's all you get.

Overall though, I'd say that it's quite a handsome set despite some of its flaws. 4 stars out of 5.",1446508800,,2310,4.4821852731591445
