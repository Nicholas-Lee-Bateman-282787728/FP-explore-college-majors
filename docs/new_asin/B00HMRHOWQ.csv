So many fans complain about getting double matches on the WWE releases, but with this, you can just get the documentary for cheap and not have to re buy the Wrestlemania matches that you probably already have",1397952000,,312,4.305084745762712

Just like how football has ""The Super Bowl"" & baseball as ""The World Series"", the world of wrestling has ""WrestleMania"" as the biggest annual event. Now after decades of this event, WWE has finally put out a documentary that showcases so many elements of this event via stories of happenings in-front of & behind the camera along with video footage including some that has never been seen before. You hear from various people throughout this documentary from past & current WWE talent (Gene Okerland, Vince McMahon, Hulk Hogan, Howard Finkel, Jerry Lawler, Gerald Brisco, The Rock, Chris Jericho, John Cena, Big Show, Triple H, Rey Mysterio, Ricky Steamboat, Pat Patterson, Ted Dibiase Sr., Edge, Sgt. Slaughter, Steve Austin, Jesse Ventura, Sheamus, Shawn Michaels, Randy Orton, Jack Swagger), celebrities (William Perry, Donald Trump, Floyd Mayweather, Snoop Dogg, Bob Ucker, Mike Tyson, Pete Rose, ect.), and those behind the scenes of the events that we rarely or never hear from (Publisher Of Pro Wrestling Illustrated magazine Stu Stacks, President Of NBC Sports Dick Ebersol, WWE Director Kerwin Silfies, Head Of WWE Business Strategy Basil DrVito, ect.).

The documentary begins with the talk of the territory system that wrestling was under before Vince McMahon decided to take the WWE national while connecting with the MTV Generation & celebrities like Cindy Lauper & Mr. T in the process. The process of how WrestleMania came about such as who actually came up with the name, getting the celebrities such as Muhammed Ali to Billy Martin to Liberace involved, how to get this event broadcast around the nation, how this would ""make or break"" the WWE was discussed next with Hulk Hogan even talking about how he was scared that all the talent on the show would be blackballed from the other promotions if it failed. How the success of this event led to the idea of doing WrestleMania 2 from 3 different locations was talked about next with the difference being that the celebrities came to WWE this time instead of WWE had to go to them before with the highlight being Vince going into how he always had ""lady luck"" on his side as it's difficult to do that with the technology today so imagine doing that 25 years ago to the point where WrestleMania was shown in full for free on television for the first & only time in one market. WrestleMania III in Detroit was about WWE achieving ""Super Bowl"" status as Vince wanted to break an attendance record was talked about next before going into details of how they adjusted their normal setting to make the live experience benefit everyone from the top to bottom row of fans (with showing exclusive footage of the setup & rehearsal), how the use of celebrities was different from the previous years, and talking about the two most memorable matches on the card as one that drew the house (Hogan/Andre) and one stole the show (Steamboat/Savage). The documentary then jumped ahead to the return of WrestleMania to Detroit at WrestleMania 23 & the ""Battle Of The Billionaires"" match with Vince & Donald Trump that made it the highest grossing Mania of all time before going into the long relationship between Vince/WWE & Trump that brought both WrestleMania IV & V to the Trump Plaza in Atlantic City with these WrestleMania's setting the stage for how Mania would be presented in the future as they were the first ones to be exclusively on pay-per-view & the first to have a weekend of events to draw the in the community which we see today with events like Fan Axxess. WrestleMania VI in Canada being the first international WrestleMania was highlighted by the ""Ultimate Challenge"" between Hogan & Warrior with Edge giving his memories on the event before talking about their return to the SkyDome in Toronto with both Triple H & Jericho talking about they didn't want to follow Hogan/Rock as Jericho put it perfectly, ""we went on last but THEY were the main event."" The importance of Hulk Hogan to the event itself was discussed along with the controversial angle between him & Sgt. Slaughter at WrestleMania VII that WWE claims to have caused the event to be moved at the last minute before talking about why the dream match between Flair/Hogan didn't happen at WrestleMania VIII. One of the highlights of the documentary came here as they discussed the idea behind the ""Roman Coliseum"" at WrestleMania IX with a heavy amount of never before seen footage of how they put the event together from the wrestlers backstage to rehearing entrances to setting up the arena before going into how, despite the reception of the two WWE Title changes that night, anything is possible at WrestleMania. The idea behind bringing the WrestleMania back to Madison Square Garden to celebrate every 10th anniversary (with footage from WMX & XX) is talked about before going into the evolution of adding additional events to WrestleMania such as Fan Axxess & the Hall Of Fame. WWE's ""New Generation"" era of WrestleMania is discussed next with highlights & discussions of each main event (Lawerence Taylor/Bam Bam Bigelow at XI, Bret/Shawn in an Ironman Match at XII) before going into how the submission match with Bret Hart at WrestleMania 13 would launch Steve Austin to the point where he ""saved"" WrestleMania for the next few years. Mike Tyson's participation in WrestleMania XIV was talked about next before going to how other celebrities give the event more pop culture credibility with comments from various celebrities who have participated at Mania including Pete Rose talking about his trilogy of appearances with Kane. The impact of matches from WrestleMania XV (Austin/Rock) & XVI/2000 (tag team ladder match) were talked about next before going into how WrestleMania XVII was a ""seismic shift"" as both ECW & WCW were out of business leaving WWE a monopoly in the wrestling business. WrestleMania XIX was highlighted by the retirement of Steve Austin to the point where he explained what initials were on his ring vest that we've never seen & the return of Shawn Michaels before going into why Shawn has earned the name ""Mr. WrestleMania."" With WrestleMania's XX through 22 being held in arenas before Vince wanted to take it back into stadiums was a heavy discussed topic with the talents giving observations/different opinions about the pros & cons of wrestling in an arena versus a stadium. After going into the concept of ""Going Hollywood"" for WrestleMania 21 & the introduction of the traditional Money In The Bank match, the documentary goes into various superstars talking about their moments such as walking in as champion or winning the first championship or something more personal (Randy Orton making his Mania debut 20 years after his dad participated in the first Mania in the same building of Madison Square Garden), the opinions of how Cena is as important to the event today as Austin & Hogan were in the past, and the music involved with WrestleMania was talked about next with the heavy importance of ""America The Beautiful"" being discussed (along with highlights of past performances of it) before hearing from the past bands who have performed at the event (Motorhead, P.O.D., Saliva, Drowning Pool, Limp Bizkit). WrestleMania XXIV was talked about next with the original plans for it to be held in an arena & moved to the Citrus Bowl were discussed & went into details about how people had a negative opinion of it to the point where WWE gave the that stadium a complete makeover for it to be ""WrestleMania quality"" before going into the setup of the Big Show vs. Floyd Mayweather match. The 25th Anniversary Of WrestleMania was highlighted by the match between Shawn Michaels vs. Undertaker with many discussing about the importance of it to the point where those in the WWE/World Title matches talking about how they weren't able to follow that encounter. The importance of Undertaker's streak is talked about next with talent talking about how Mania is ""his show"" and Edge stating his opinion that his matches with the streak on the line ""are more important than the title matches"" before the documentary ends on what many feel legacy of WrestleMania is.

n the end, the documentary was one of the best ones WWE has done for a while as they gave it plenty of time (around 2 hours) with the exclusive footage & additional comments from those behind the scenes of WWE that never hear from was a very welcomed addition.",1396137600,,8547,4.897170462387853
