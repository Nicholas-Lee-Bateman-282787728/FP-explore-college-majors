8164767,1,B000LXGP50,"If I could have given less than one star on this purchase I would have done so.  What a huge disappointment.  The dance combinations when performed together lasts for exactly 42.2 SECONDS!  And these are not difficult combinations.  Her segment advertising her other videos: 3:37,  her bio segment 1:03 and her performance segment 4:09.  Her performance segment in not even a bhangra dance.  It is an average performance of classical Indian dance, more notable for it's interesting camera angles and special effects.
I teach dance for exercise and was hoping to learn some bhangra to lend some authenticity to my Bollywood routines.  These combination would not even be sufficient to fill the chorus in the music.
I will definitely be returning this.",1323734400,9,750,5.090163934426229
8164768,5,B000LXGP50,"I love this work out DVD b/c I feel like I am in a class with Meera. Each move is taught separately, and is practiced slowly, and then faster, just like  a real dance class. The arm movements are also taught separately from the feet. I love how challenging this DVD is. It is perfect for because it actually teaches Bhangra moves, so by the time the DVD is over, you know a Bhangra dance! It is very challenging work out, but gets easier every time. This is exactly what I was looking for and I'm so glad I purchased this DVD!",1306713600,2,526,4.1568627450980395
8164769,5,B000LXGP50,"After the warm-up, Meera leads you through sevaral combination steps -- I can't remember the names of the steps, but they include (1) side steps (Bhangra Bounce), (2) a type of fun, bouncy mambo with a kickback, (3) a sort of wide kickback with arms (Pinjara Push), (4) some jumping moves, and (5) some punching moves with a turn (Pinjara Throwdown?)  After demonstrating each step in half time, you do them at tempo; the steps are then all combined into one workout.  The total practice and workout is about 31 minutes, including warm-up.  The advanced workout is relatively short (about 6 minutes), but is a nice add-on because you just get into the moves with no half-time practice.  The cool down is about 6 minutes as well ... so total workout including advanced and cool down is about 45 minutes.

The setting is bright and cheery, and the music is a lot of fun.  If you want to learn Bhangra or just a fun dance for a good cardio workout, this video is for you.  If you already know Bhangra dance moves, you might want to go on to something more advanced.",1260835200,16,1062,4.5
