1818716,2,B00007L4LH,"This series starts with a bad plot.
I heard it was as good as Love Hina. I have not gotten a chance to see Love Hina. If that is so, I will give both up.
Graphically, it is very crisp and clean with beautiful colors. All characters are cute. The music and songs are ""cute"". But, the plot .... I could not laugh although it is supposed to be a comedy!
Two stars are covering the technical parts of the DVD.",1049241600,,405,4.012345679012346
1818717,5,B00007L4LH,"I know, I know, you're thinking, ""We've seen it all before. Typical anime where the guy ends up living with a ton of girls and can't make up his mind which one he loves.""
Wrong.
Ai Yori Aoshi is a refreshing look at the romantic comedy genre. While it is true that there are more girls added to the series, they don't even begin to show up until the fifth episode, by which time, we already know that Aoi and Kaouru are made for each other.
Unlike most romantic comedies, Kaouru doesn't suffer from the typical indecisiveness of the standard anime male. In fact, he shows strong resolve. He's a Junior in college, he has his own apartment, and he knows he definitely wants nothing to do with the Hanabishi clan whose patriarch so horribly abused him when he was younger.
A man used to lonliness and pain, he remains in good spirits, and Aoi, with her unassuming gentleness, is just the person to be at his side for all time.
There's a bizarre sort of sincerity that comes from this series that I've never seen before in other romantic comedy type anime. Also, for those familiar with anime, the series seems to be a condemnation of the Japanese caste system that some still cling to even to this very day.",1048982400,4,1205,4.457013574660634
1818718,5,B00007L4LH,"This anime is very cute in my opinion! But if you don't like gushy love stories STEER CLEAR! It is driven by character lines not action, and in my opinion Tina Foster is THE WORST! I was watching my dvd earlier and wanted one of them to get her.... or I was gonna do it myself. Anyway, one other thing i didn't like about this anime was their focus on breasts. But for the girls Kaoru is very cute, and he's very funny. Again, if you like gushy romancey stuff, (i usually don't) don't get this anime, that's why there are some people that hate it, and some people who love it.",1048291200,4,576,4.151785714285714
1818719,5,B00007L4LH,"I've read numerous average-to-good reviews of this series, but I took a chance buying it and was pleasantly surprised by what I found. A cliche ""harem"" series with surprising depth, subtlety and romance to go with the fan service and raunchy comedy.
Comparing ""A.Y.A."" to other ""harem"" series like ""Love Hina"" or ""Tenchi"" seems fair enough, but the writers are smart enough to play around with the conventions. Instead of using stock characters in lieu of real character development, they subvert the cliches by giving depth to the concept of the hapless, well-meaning hero, etc.  It also manages a coup because they cast the traditional girl as the rebel... something vastly different than the violent, post-feminist anime heroine you find in most animes  Pretty ingenious, actually.
Summarized plot: Kaoru and Aoi were both children of privilege promised to wed.  Kaoru was physically and emotionally abused by his family, so he left to live on his own.  Aoi, who has never forgotten her childhood crush, searches Kaoru out and meets him, accidentally, in a train station.  While they obviously care about each other, marrying Aoi means returning to his family so Aoi's family hides them in a big mansion that quickly becomes populated by lots of hot chicks who all fall for Kaoru.  Comedy ensues.
Kaoru is a college junior, not an awkward High School student and conducts himself with much more maturity than your typical anime hero. He's apparently shy, a loner and a bit of a geek (for reasons in his past that are explained logically), but when the pressure is on, he's reliable. He's also sweet and well-meaning, something that also seems logical given his rough past. Most anime heroes have trouble admitting their feelings openly and the beginning of the courtship takes the entire series to develop, but Kaoru and Aoi click quickly and by episode three they're both obviously in love, if a bit naive as to what comes next.
The heroine, Aoi, only appears to be a wallflower and the traditional stereotype of the Japanese woman. Rather than being spineless and servile, we can actually see her strength as she leaves everything she knows and sacrifices her place in her family just to cling to a dream. The charm of her character isn't her desire to please her man, it's the strength and focus she shows in chasing her dream of being the best wife possible. Having seen as much anime as I have, it's a surprise to see so much thought put into a light romantic comedy/drama that could have easily skated by on the stock characterizations.
As a viewer, I liked feeling like my intelligence wasn't being insulted. There are subtle moments of character building that they don't come right out and say, which I really appreciated. If this was an American movie, they would have beat us over the head with those moments. Moments like the first episode when Aoi lets one hands rest on Kaoru's shoulder... then the other, a sign of real trust to someone she knows only as a stranger at the time. Or seeing Aoi notice that the bawdy American Tina Foster shows affection to Kaoru the same way she shows affection to a cat... and, thus, doesn't get jealous of her clinging to Kaoru. I really appreciated not having that hammered into my head.
The downsides are relatively minor if you can get past the deceptively cliche nature of the show. The character of Aoi can (and apparently does) turn people off, but I looked at it more as a departure from convention than a glorified Japanese male fantasy, though both arguments have merit. After watching a series like ""Love Hina"" where the hapless male lead gets physically and emotionally pummeled for 20+ episodes with little or no payoff, ""A.Y.A."" can be a breath of fresh air so long as you don't take it seriously. (Frankly, ""Love Hina's"" Naru is as much a male fantasy as Aoi, just to the opposite extreme.) Additionally, the dialogue can get a little TOO frothy and the fan service feels tacked on... an attempt to please both sides of the gender divide. Even if the next couple volumes rely mostly on bawdy humor and ""Tenchi""-ish misadventures, I still plan on sticking with it. To me, I like all of the characters enough that it'll be like visiting old friends, not watching some rote re-telling of the same ol' story. I've already watched this volume dubbed and subbed and I'll probably revisit it again in the near future.
Highly recommended for anime/Japan culture aficionados, but neophytes should probably start their collection elsewhere.",1047513600,24,4495,4.8311688311688314
1818720,4,B00007L4LH,"This is the first disc of Ai Yori Aoshi.  A very heartfelt series with some great romantic storylines.  The only fault I have with this disc is that the last episode seems so out of place.  In one swoop the show degenerates into a complete fan-service mish-mash.  But aside from that out-of-place ""breast"" episode ending the disc the rest are absolutely wonderful.  Definitely worth picking up even though the last episode brought down the whole IMHO.
5 stars out of 5 for the first episodes and only 3 stars for the last.  It isn't a completely horrible episode, but just seems that way because of those previous.",1047340800,3,614,4.691588785046729
1818721,5,B00007L4LH,"I went into this series thinking I was going to be in for another Tenchi clone. I was so wrong. The characters actually have a clue!
I fell for Aoi quickly and I look forward to her growth throughout the series. The introduction of Tina, the iconoclast American, brings a laugh knowing how Americans are viewed by the Japanese and how well they can parody our behaviour in their eyes.
It may not be deep, but it grabs your attention and gives you a fun experience. Much better than CNN, honest. ;)",1046390400,,497,4.413043478260869
1818722,4,B00007L4LH,"Ai Yori Aoshi needs a warning to open: if you find the idea of a woman wanting to be a traditional housewife to be somehow repulsive, you'll hate this show.  This is all Aoi wants to be: the wife of Kaoru, to whom she was arranged to be married as a child.  Kaoru left his family (for reasons made clear), but Aoi still loved him.  Therein is the heart and warmth of this show: there is no doubt that Aoi and Kaoru will be together throughout once they meet again.
Only in the last episode on this disc (which has 5 episodes) does Ai Yori Aoshi reveal itself to be a ""harem"" show--Kaoru starts finding a lot of girls around him and ultimately, living in the same house.  In its dynamics, though, Ai Yori Aoshi differs from many of the other harem shows that have been imported from Japan recently--in Love Hina, for example, one thing or another keeps interrupting Naru and Keitaro's romance.  Here, that's not the issue.
The humor in this show depends on Aoi and Kaoru learning about each other.  Because there's no real conflict between the two, Ai Yori Aoshi may not be quite as funny as a Love Hina or a few others, but it manages to hold its own in the laughs department.  More importantly, it is simply pleasant to watch.  Aoi, who in a lesser show might have come off as spineless, drives the story with her efforts to make her dream come true.  Barring an ideological problem with her domesticity, Aoi is more than reason enough to want to see more of this show.  It is when she is not on-screen (particularly when the decidedly unpleasant Tina is), that the show suffers.  Fortunately, Aoi is (and hopefully will remain throughout) the focus.
One warning to close: there's a fair bit of fanservice here, and this release is based off the Japanese home video release, which added some nudity.  It's all featureless (nothing's drawn in) and brief, but it's there, for those who want to avoid such things.",1046131200,30,1911,4.507246376811594
1818723,3,B00007L4LH,"Among the Harem animes I watched, this probably comes down as the hardest to understand without knowing chunks about Japanese culture.  Perhaps, this series should be used as the reference to Japanese culture and its psyche instead of fun anime.
If you watched plenty of animes (most of viewers did, I assume), this is not very hard to understand.  In basic, this follows the predictable plot, with bunch of girls around the main character, love triangle, etc.  Problem is that whole ingredients are combined in very sloppy manner.
First of all, the characters do not possess strong personality.  Most of them are either cliche, too goody, or both.  It is just not fun to watch them, especially when filler episodes occupies 2/3 of whole series.
Second, cultural references are too strong.  Many animes possess some cliche that has to be viewed over to understand, but this is full of them.  Aoi's character is merely thin disguise of spineless women which is sure to offend many people (At least in Love Hina, Naru had mighty punch to blow at Keitaro).  This might be the perfect portraight of Geisha in which Western people would think (which is very inaccurate).
If you have good understanding of Japanese culture, this series can be enjoyable, but not by much.  All told, this is for people who can't get enough Harem anime fans.  Even so, Love Hina is better excuted.",1046131200,,1372,4.8247863247863245
1818724,4,B00007L4LH,"Actually this should rate higher, but I'm averaging it with the rest of the series.  This 26 episode series about first love is played sweet with little conflict.  The only conflict comes at the beginning and then again at series end.  Its hard to dance a plot intended as a romatic comedy on the edge of the knife of tragedy.  It would however, have been nice to see them try.
The two characters are brought together in the first few episodes by overly coincidental fate. Then when Aoi won't leave her long lost love, the family sets them up in a controlled living situation.  This obviously a set-up in hopes the unknown relationship will run its course break-up.  Normally I would have expected a lot of ominous meddleing from the family.  Unfortunately the series turned light from here on, giving the traditional comic treatment expected of a situation comedy.  New characters arrive, mostly females to create our situations.  None of which are handled with any seriousness save a few scenes with Aoi.
We have the prerequisite animals (a ferret and some cats), the ackward girl with big assets, the standard beach episodes, and some drinking humor.  The standard bag for a light series. You can't help liking the series, but if you're expecting anything new or profound, forget it.  Series turns serious again in last three episodes.  It could have been a classic had episodes 4-21 held the same effort that 1-3 and 22-24 did.  Animation is simple but good, backgrounds are excellent.  Sound and music are both good, but not really special.
I've noticed a lot of Japanese anime, the series is mapped from beginning to end.  I wonder about that here.  Its like two slices of heavy pupernickel rye with a filling of brie.  Wheres the beef and the spiced ham when we need it.",1045440000,8,1777,4.736156351791531
1818725,4,B00007L4LH,"The Story: In Tokyo, there are two very well respected families, the Hanabishi and the Sakuraba. And eight-year-old Sakuraba Aoi is destined to be married to eight-year-old Hanabishi Kaoru when they grow up. So, the two families decided that if they are to be married, they need to befriend each other first. Unfortunately, as they start to develop a liking for each other, something happened between the Hanabishi and the Sakuraba that both didn't want anything to do with each other.
Aoi's parents thought that Aoi would easily forget Kaoru as any child forget things. They were wrong. Aoi loved Kaoru and she hoped that he will come back for her. After waiting ten years, Aoi ran away from home to live in Tokyo to search for Kaoru. After finding Kaoru by accident (Kaoru was actually helping her since she arrived ^_^), the two lovers reunite happily.
Of course, Aoi's mother rejected the option that Aoi will marry Kaoru. But she tries to be nice to Aoi and let Aoi and Kaoru live in the Sakuraba summer home for a while... with her lifelong maid, Miyabi (who hates Kaoru). Unfortunately for the two lovers, three (yes, three) women wanted to live under the same roof as Kaoru (Tina, Taeko, and Mayu). Will Aoi convince Kaoru that they are destined to be married? Watch it to find out...
The review: Yeah, I can see the words form in your head as the storyline ends, ""How ... did the story changes from a romantic drama to another Love Hina storyline!?"" Sure, the story is cliched, but Ai Yori Aoshi pulled it off beautifully. Great characters with good personalities to back them up. If you want romantic comedy (and have watched to death your Love Hina and Tenchi Muyo! s), Ai Yori Aoshi is a great choice to fill your needs. [NOTE: Ai Yori Aoshi contains some ecchi.]
Recommended for people who enjoyed: Love Hina, Tenchi Muyo! and the billion other one-guy-five-girls anime titles.",1042416000,8,1890,4.712990936555891
1818726,5,B00007L4LH,"I've seen all the episodes of the first and second aiyoriaoshi series before they were even in english and i own the first 3 aiyoriaoshi dvds

The anime Uses its comedy act alot, with nnice good mixture of romance. The nicely made storyline kills any signs of pervertedness and the comedy in it has made many people laugh.

I recommend this anime people to any anime watcher and I even recommend it to people who don't even like romance because the comedy will get you into the finely made storyline of the show.

The quaility of the dvds a really nice, way better than most anime dvds I buy, the dvd cases are very fancy, also these dvds have tons of ncie features, like previews to anime movies and japanese movies, textless endings and openings, music videos with the person who sings the openening and ending themes.

5.1 surround sound, which alot of dvds out there only have 2.1, pictures of the anime episodes, and a few otehr features I can/t think about right now.",1122940800,5,973,4.542857142857143
1818727,5,B00007L4LH,"Based on Kou Fumizuki's manga series of the same name, Ai Yori Aoshi was animated in a series 24 half hour anime episodes for the first season.  This romantic drama/comedy recounts the reunion of Aoi Sakuraba and Kaoru Hanabishi, betrothed to each other eighteen years ago, when they were both little tykes.  The first five episodes comprise all of the first manga and the first three bits of the second manga.

Aoi, now in her twenties, and quite a sweet and cute girl, goes out in search of Kaoru when she discovers their engagement is off, and to find out why.  Dressed in a traditional indigo kimono amid the Western-clothed populace, Aoi is quite bewildered at the Tokyo train station system, as it is her first time out alone. A young man who helps her find the right direction train platform and even mends the strap on her sandal, turns out to be her long lost Kaoru.

""When I think of him, I am truly grateful that I was born in this world,"" she tells him before she realizes who he is.  Aoi is the best thing that has happened to Kaoru, as she cooks him all his favourite dishes, dusts, cleans, does his laundry.  It turns out that she paid attention of what he liked-such as his dishes, his favourite colour, and the fact that he liked short hair.  And she is overly polite in her speaking manner; it's heartening.

Life hasn't been all roses for Kaoru, though.  He was raised by the rich and powerful Hanabishi clan after his father died, but there was no love there. The overly stern patriarch of the clan beat him severely with a stick, leaving horrible scars on his back.  The experience left him a bitter and distrusting young college student living alone in a small apartment.

The two end up setting up house in one of the Sakuraba's unused summer mansions, under the supervision of Miyabi Kagurazaki, the tall stern businesswoman in charge of Aoi's education.  However, in order to prevent a scandal, Aoi must act as the landlady, Miyabi the manager, and Kaoru her tenant.  And Kaoru isn't allowed to be in the mansion after ten, having to trot back to an annex where his room lies.

Episode 5 introduces two characters.  Tina Foster, the overly energetic blonde, liquor-guzzling American who speaks with a Hakata dialect, returns after a year of traveling in Africa and South America.  She's quite partial to liquor, and has an awkward way of greeting girls, by squeezing a certain part of their anatomy.  When she does it to Miyabi-san, a whole army of red X's symbolizing anger pop up on her face as she chases Tina around in fury.  Then there's Taeko Minazuki, a clumsy and shy bespectacled sophomore who joined the photo club.  Unfortunately, she's gullible enough to be exploited by Sato, the club VP who's obsessed with cheesecake shots, who tells her it's a first step in photography experience.

A few differences in the anime and manga:  in the manga, Tina becomes a tenant in regards to a sign Miyabi posted as a bluff to make the setup legitimate.  Here, she uses more cunning means.  Also, Aoi's mother never speaks to Kaoru here, though in the manga, she apologizes to him for her daughter's naivete in the world.

This is probably Ayako Kawasumi's best known voice role as Aoi-chan.  The other big name here is Satsuki Yukino (Tina Foster), who was Mutsumi in Love Hina, and Mayune in Pretear.  And Akiko Hiramitsu (Miyabi) voiced English teacher Yukari Tanizaki in Azumanga Daioh.  One bonus feature is Yoko Ishida's music video of ""Towa No Hana"" or ""Eternal Flower,"" the lovely opening theme for this series.

At the end, Aoi says to Kaoru, ""I am not perfect, but please regard me kindly.""  Put it this way:  if I had a girlfriend or wife like Aoi Sakuraba, I'd probably be the happiest guy on Earth.  Darnit, she IS perfect, indigo kimono, short hair, clingy tendencies, worrying and caring personality, and all.  A wonderful first step in Kaoru and Aoi making memories together.",1122249600,2,3916,4.67007299270073
1818728,2,B00007L4LH,"After watching all the episodes of Ai Yori Aoshi and it's sequel Ai Yori Aoshi Enishi, I've concluded that this series was not meant for girls. With alot of cliche scenes and false drama, only inexperienced drama veiewers were allowed to enjoy this. I also disliked both endings. Both felt like they were rushed and the entire series seems like there was no goal, unlike is Love Hina were Keitaro wishes to be with Naru but in Ai Yori Aoshi Kouru already has Aoi. I thing I did like was the title, Bluer than Indigo. In the end, I recommend instead READING Love Hina or Ichigo 100%.",1120089600,,582,4.4485981308411215
1818729,5,B00007L4LH,"I am too familiar with and well aware of the areas in which Ai Yori Aoshi may be criticized. And on an intellectual level I would agree. There is absolutely no purpose to Tina's overtly perverse and rude behavior, which was for all intent a grossly distorted crack at American conduct. Taeko may have been more amiable had the character not been a stereotypical clumsy but well-meaning goof of a beauty who is the most endowed among the cast. And Aoi is so subservient, deferring her own wishes, ambitions and aspirations to a weakling that had abandoned her in the first place that it defies reality and suspends disbelief. And its most significant failing may be said to be its dishonesty. To begin with exposition of a profound romantic premise that after four episodes takes not just a detour, but a full 180-degree turn to become something less and driven by slapstick and fanservice is just deceitful and misleading. As a romantic drama, the title is guilty of all its shortcomings.

But what if the original intent had not been to create a romantic drama, but to sell a product that is highly popular among male demographics? And what if success in this business venture was to be found in illustrated literature that falls under a genre in which a harem was not only common, but fundamental? Moreover, what if author and artist Fumizuki Kou was a skilled and gifted writer able to conceive strong situations that test his characters and thus move his readers? And, that despite his need to eat and pay rent or the mortgage, his respect for his own artistry forbids him from producing entirely unsubstantial material, that he devises a plan to bring about warmth, richness, and dimension to the product. And that he does so by setting its foundation on the love of two childhood friends bethrothed to one another but separated by bitter familial politics. But he would decisively and canonically establish an exciting destiny for these two no matter who was thrown in the mix. And to highten and strengthen the dramatic impact, he would develop the two in the most engrossing fashion by sparsely placing throughout the series the tender, touching, inspiring, and captivating moments of intimacy shared between them. And as the two of them engage one another, we are exposed to their thoughts and emotions, raw in the pursuit of the other's well being but founded on a compelling desire to be the source of nourishment to the other. Finally, their interaction would be pure, honest, mutually exclusive, and courageously untainted by any form of wanton and gratuitous sexual provacation (Tina's antics notwithstanding) as is common in today's smut being passed off as romance. What if the powerful romantic elements of Ai Yori Aoshi was merely a component used to enrich the product belonging to a genre from which there certainly was no shortage?

This is how I view Ai Yori Aoshi. It is an enjoyable harem anime based on a fine manga. As a harem anime, it would then be expected for one male to end up in situations where he is living with many women. Yet, the title sets itself apart in execution, as it profoundly explores and develops that romantic component that was sorely neglected in Love Hina and diverted away from in Tenchi. It is also ludicrous to judge the character of Aoi Sakuraba in light of western upbringing and not consider the cultural context from which she was conceived. Whatever it is that one may say about her only demonstrates one's position about the culture, and not fallacies about her conception. The Aoi and Kaoru moments were few indeed, but they were moving and utterly delightful, and their rareness made them all the more special when they did occur. I have nothing but the deepest affection and fondness for Ai Yori Aoshi. I've not seen anything as breadthly emotional in a romance, not the books I've read by jaded authors nor any film or video to which their efforts I ascribe superficial. This title is one that I continue to watch over and over again. If the elitist viewer can get over him or herself, there is much to enjoy in this fine production.",1115424000,3,4098,4.770422535211267
1818730,4,B00007L4LH,"Many other reviewers already hit the major points so I won't bother going into all the details. I will however, reiterate some of the points that others have already stated.

1) If you do have objections for a woman desiring to be a traditional housewife (Japanese) then you'll dislike this.

2) If you have objections to constant emotional love outbursts and subservient apologetic behavior from a girl then you'll dislike this.

If that doesn't bother you, then you will absolutely enjoy this show. I have not seen Love Hina yet so I can't compare. I can tell you this though, I was constantly asking myself, is it better to love or be loved?

In the case of Kaoru-sama, he is constantly exposed to the latter. After the dissolved arranged marriage from over 18 years, Aoi-chan has gone out of her way to seek out and meet her beloved and find out why he didn't want to marry her. Once their destined meet occurred, Kaoru-sama was overwhelmed with the love that Aoi-chan had to give for a person she hasn't seen for almost 2 decades. The show starts strong in building their relationship but then goes off on a tangent a bit when they start adding the other characters (all females mind you). Each one begins to harbor feelings for Kaoru as they get to spend more time with him. They add plenty of humor as the series goes on. However, the love and support that Aoi-chan provides coupled with Kaoru-sama's honest and gentle nature keeps him in line. Also, each encounter strengthens his growing love for Aoi-chan. For a lack of a better word, there are many ""cheesy"" moments when Aoi-chan demonstrates her love for Kaoru-sama. However, I realized that these cheesy moments is what makes the show so enjoyable.

Although the characters are pretty simple in nature, they are very loveable. The character designs are great and the show is set mainly in a bright atmosphere. Ai Yori Aoshi is one of those series that merit viewing again and again. It's a feel-good show with plenty of tender moments. There are definite moments of tragedy when Kaoru's past is re-visited but overall maintains a light-hearted atmosphere. Love conquers all when Aoi enters his life. As strongly as I believe in giving love to one I find closest in my heart, Ai Yori Aoshi makes a stronger argument showing that it is better to be loved.",1113782400,4,2316,4.694581280788177
1818731,1,B00007L4LH,"This was recommended to me by my friend about a year or two ago. She said it was cute and sad and all the stuff that are almost always abundant in anime like this, so of course I check it out. All 26 episodes.

The reviews have said that it was a more adult version of Love Hina. I can honestly say that they got that right and though Love Hina isn't exactly a great anime, I'll prefer that crazy story line than this one because Love Hina at least is funny in the parts that are supposed to be funny. This story may or may not try to be Love Hina but it certainly tries to be funny with all kinds of kinky-ness that occur between the girls and Kaoru. And it isn't funny because it's so predictable and so FORCED. This anime has serious themes to it one being child abuse and because of these themes the whole harem of girls and all the incidents is just done in bad taste and like I said done in  such a FORCED manner that it left me feeling sick.

Not only that, Aoi is just a stereotypical Japanese female. Perfect for males but being female and seeing a female like this is disturbing. Maybe it's because I'm used to my American ways but being a doormat, submissive female who does nothing but cook and clean and have absolutely no ambitions other than to be the perfect wife is just sickening. She is so out there, so clingy, so dependent, so extemely submissive, so much like a doormat. They try to make this comedic but it made me feel disturbed. Why throw away a story of ""adult"" themes, with typical female characters, the stereotypical doormat female, and the stereotypical ""incidents"" that involve said typical females.
Were the animators afraid that if they didn't do the typical ""accidental nudity"" they would lose its male viewers?

On a good note: (at least something I found worthwhile watching this farce) The beginning and ending songs are great.",1099958400,4,1864,4.425655976676385
1818732,1,B00007L4LH,"I've seen debates about harem comidies on message boards.  An old favorite that often comes up is how the guys in shows like Ranma 1/2 or Love Hina always seem to fall for the violent, untalented, and unfeminine girl rather than that really cute one that just wants the main character to be happy?  I can't answer the question, except to say that the ""nice"" girls wins out here, and it left me an empty feeling.

Karou is a standard college student who does the decent thing and helps a girl (Aoi) at a train station fix her sandal strap.  It turns out they were betrothed as children, but her family called it off.  Now she still loves him and is willing to ditch her family for that to happen.  So far so good, then things crap out.

Instead of living the poor college student life she's never know, and friend steps in and provides a place to stay provided it is as landlord and tennant to the public.  So any tension that might be caused by a difficult situation are out the window.  Then in later volumes a few other girls talk their way into being tennants themselves, all of whom are making eyes at Karou.  Again, this might have been good, but it's clear from the outset that they don't have a chance.  Karou and Aoi are madly in love and nothing will break them apart, there isn't even the illusion that they might not have a happy ending.

The comedy is standart harem comedy fare with ackward situations, accidental nudity, and gimicky behaviour.  While I'm a sucker for a good romance, happily ever ater came far to early.  If you've never seen a harem comedy before you might appriciate this more than I did.  Otherwise, this show is for people that think The Stepford Wives is a traing manual for women.",1098748800,,1717,4.423566878980892
1818733,5,B00007L4LH,"Right off the bat, I want to say that there is blatant trickery involved here. Many people bought this series expecting a certain type of show, only to find out that it wasn't like that at all. I was one of those people. And I couldn't be happier.
The blessing and the curse of Ai Yori Aoshi is another series called ""Love Hina"". Many people buy AYA because of `also recommended' links when they buy LH. The problem is that the synopsis is identical, but the two series are VERY different.
Common storyline:
When they were children, (male and female lead characters) promised to get together as adults and spend their lives together. They are separated for years, and meet again as college age adults who barely recognize each other. But due to strange circumstances, they end up in a huge house with four other women who also have an interest in (male character). Can (male character) resist all the distractions and get together with (childhood sweetheart) in the end?
I imagine two copies of this synopsis being printed and one handed to a group of writers from Baywatch and one handed to the makers of a BBC period costume drama. Then after the scripts were written, a page or two got swapped out of each finished script. At first horrified, each group read the mixed up script and decided they liked it better that way, so they left the mismatched stuff in.
So, Love Hina becomes a slapstick jigglefest with a wee bit of a love story. And Ai Yori Aoshi becomes a powerful, deeply moving romance. (...)
And one last comparison and I'll let LH rest (because that's a review on its own)... in LH they make no great effort at backstory - we're barely into the first episode when they start introducing the `other' female characters - but in AYA, they spend the first 4 episodes purely on developing the romantic relationship and (very important to the plot) history of the two lead characters. As a result, in LH, I found that I considered at least two of the other females to be a better match for the guy (in fact, found myself hoping that he would trade up in the sequel. [Shrug] no such luck...). But in AYA, there was never any doubt that there was only one romance, despite whatever else was going on.
AYA is visually stunning - they often go the extra mile in making lush, scenic backgrounds and highly detailed artwork. The background music is consistently on cue with the action, actually enhancing rather than distracting from the story.
As a certified large hairy guy, I am not often found having a strong emotional reaction to a movie, but at least twice watching this I had tears in my eyes.
(...)
As a final note, I have to point out that throughout the show, the directors most often went for simple and subtle rather than flashing-neon-sign-hey-lookee-here mode, and that was greatly to their benefit. I will remember the moment in the train station where Aoi first shyly rests one hand, then the other, on Karou's shoulder while he is fixing her sandal long, long after the clichd lovers-gazing-into-each-other's-eyes-at-sunset thrust upon us by so many other movies.
Pros:
Breaks most of the stereotypes of the genre and actually has a REAL romance - and doesn't insult the intelligence of the viewer while doing it. Amazingly, the other females in the story actually have well-explained reasons for falling for Karou, and instead of cluttering up the story, actually enhances the character development.
Cons:
Well, folks, it's an anime. (...) On the other hand, every adult female (Other than Aoi's mother, who escapes jiggle duty due to her indeterminate advanced age) is definitely female in profile view...",1087516800,10,3629,4.743670886075949
1818734,1,B00007L4LH,"I bought Ai Yori Aoshi on a whim, after hearing things like, ""If your a fan of Love Hina and Hand Maid May, you'll love this!"" What a lie.
I usually love harem-shows, but not this one.
I don't exactly know why I don't like it. Maybe that it's the fact Aoi is too persistent on becoming Kaoru's wife.
I really didn't like this one bit, and I hope I never come across another show as boring as Ai Yori Aoshi.",1086480000,2,406,4.0246913580246915
1818735,4,B00007L4LH,"This series is good couples Anime.  These first episodes bring the relationship of Karu Hanabishi and Aoi Sakuraba to the forefront.  It seems that long ago, when they were children, their families had arranged them to be married.  But, someting went wrong and Aoi wants to find out why...
The character Aoi might not be popualr to the modern American audience.  All appearances say that she has grown and developed in a very protective environment only to become the perfect traditional Japanese wife.  Some people may be quickly annoyed by her inherant subservience and overly apologetic nature.  Yet, she has an assertiveness that helps her overcome the bias of her character and helps to round out a very powerful role in the story.
Sadly the story falls into some way-too-easy comedic trappings with the 5th episode by introducing the harem aspect of the series with Tina, the ""American"".  Don't worry though, she will behave herself later.
Aside from the culture-shock and boobie-humor that this series contains, there is a good strong beginning to a heart warming and against-all-odds love affair between the main characters.
Also:  Look out for the nudity.  It's not detailed, but there are quite a bit of bathtime body pans.  And beware the English dub.  The translated voice acting sounds as if it's being read from a book with little to no attention to the emotion in the scene.",1081209600,5,1389,4.943965517241379
1818736,4,B00007L4LH,"This is taken straight from the manga, word for word. This made it boring to watch because I knew what was going to happen.
The animation is beautiful, and the voice acting is fairly well-done in both versions. But I found the story to be rather cliched.",1080086400,,254,4.425531914893617
1818737,5,B00007L4LH,"This series has a heart and soul. It is so kind and sweet you would think it would be syrupy, but somehow ai yori aoshi manages to balance the underlying story of two soulmates growing together with conflict that is far from earth-shaking but somehow reads more true for it's trivial, day-to-day nature.

Along the way you get an intriguing glimpse at the last remains of feudal/traditional japan through the two protagonists, particularly the character Aoi. The interest is greater because of the setting, a modern day Tokyo where Aoi's traditional mannerisims and garb are just unusual enough to generate interest. Aoi's ""I exist for my man"" attitude suprisingly failed to offend my more feminist-minded friends, perhaps because of her traditional background, or maybe because it's clear that Aoi has made a concious choice to live that way... I don't know, but it works and isn't offensive.

And none of what I'm saying does Ai Yori Aoshi justice. Let me put it this way. If you watch this series you will feel happy. And the feeling grows as you get further into it. You can watch trusting that in the end, things will be ok. Unless you have a heart of flint, ai yori aoshi will reach you. And you will feel better having seen it.

It's simply the most satisfying story of two people in love I think I will ever see. I can't recommend it strongly enough.",1065398400,10,1358,4.673640167364017
1818738,5,B00007L4LH,"This is the most beautifully drawn, written, and produced anime I've seen.  As I am more of an action/comedy anime fan (Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, Akira, Excel Saga) I was surprised at how quickly I fell in love with the story.  Set in modern Japan, the first few episodes are very serious, indroducing a love story that began in childhood, but was interupted when Kaoru left his clan and the arranged marriage to Aoi due to his abusive grandfather, and is attending college in Tokyo.  Devastated by the news that Kaoru's departure from his clan has also ended their arranged marriage, Aoi, a beautiful tradtionally raised girl, sneaks away from home to find Kaoru, who she hasn't seen since they were children, in the hope that he will still accept her as his wife.  As though it is fate, Kaoru finds Aoi lost and frightened in the Tokyo subway, and unwittingly guides her to the address she seeks... his own apartment.
The story progresses through Kaoru's and Aoi's daily lives as thier love for each other develops and grows, with both touching scenes mixed with some outrageous slapstic comedy (due to the fact that thier newly renewed engagement must be kept secret from everyone).  Combined with the spectacular animation, well developed characters, excellent music, and touching storyline, Ai Yori Aoshi has become my favorite anime series and I recommend it wholeheartedly.  This is not for young children, however.  There are breif scenes of watered-down nudity, and some adult humor.",1064448000,9,1488,4.975806451612903
1818739,5,B00007L4LH,"I got this DVD because I heard many people compare this series to Love Hina.  But it is not.  It seems to have a very serious story line within it.  Aoi Sakuraba wants to marry her first love, Kaoru Hanabishi, who can't marry her WITHOUT going back to to the Hanabishi Clan - which he feels he can't do.
Many times I felt very sad for the main characters and even a tad lonely, missing my own first love.  They really have touching scenes, very innocent and romantic, with scenes of silly humor and lots of fanservice.  The serious story line justs gives these other scenes more impact.
I'm not going to call it the anime verison of Shakespeare but it stands alone and should not be compared to Love Hina or other such stories.  It has its own power and its own message.  I can tell you that, because the first DVD has 5 episodes, so you get a lot of the story.
Extras include a art gallery, trailer, reversible cover(which is starting to become a standard extra now), and even a music video.",1061856000,39,992,4.3297297297297295
1818740,5,B00007L4LH,"""Ai Yori Aoshi"" is a nice surprise.  As another entry in the glut of ""harem shows,"" the expectations were low, maybe some hijinks and some laughs, but little staying interest.  However, it turned out to be really good!
The series shows plenty of promise.  The two lead characters have the simple naitivity that is charming and disarming.  The emphasis on traditional Japanese culture is nice, with both Aoi and Kaoru coming from famous kimono making families.  The additional characters, including the stereotypical loud American, and the stern guardian, make for a good mix and seem to set-up for some future fun.
Any fans of ""Love Hina"" or ""Maison Ikkoku"" should enjoy ""Ai Yori Aoshi.""  I'm looking forward to seeing more episodes, and I hope they live up to the promise of the first DVD.",1059177600,7,790,4.858208955223881
1818741,5,B00007L4LH,"This anime was extremely touching.  The romance between the two main characters does something to you and doesn't let go.  Even though after about the fourth episode, it becomes clear that this is going to be an anime that is similar to Love Hina, I still like it a lot.  It's entertaining watching the other girls show up and its also quite obvious that the main guy character isn't going to fall for any of them.
The one gripe I do have is with the american girl who is constantly grabbing other girl's chest.  who is their right mind would do that?  No one!! This is obviously thrown in for the sake of fanboy eye candy but like I said, this does little to take away from the main storyline.
The characters of this show are extremly compelling and I, someone who greatly dislikes romances, found myself moved to tears and some points of the show.  The two main characters Aoi and Kaoru show us what it means to be young and in love.",1055203200,3,935,4.344827586206897
1818742,5,B00007L4LH,"This DVD contains the first five episodes of the popular series ""Ai Yori Aoshi"".  Pioneer has actually done a DVD right, but more on that in a bit.
The story is about Aoi and Kaoru and their love.  Both come from powerful Japanese families and were engaged as children in an arranged marriage.  However, Kaoru leaves his family to attend college in Tokyo against their wishes.  They call off the engagement much to Aoi's dismay.  Despite not having seen him since childhood, she's been raised to be Kaoru's wife, so she goes to Tokyo to find out what went wrong.
The love story between Aoi and Kaoru is sweet and touching.  Some American's may not understand why Aoi would want to be the perfect housewife for Kaoru, and so may hate this title for that reason alone.  But for her, this is what she wants -- a traditional household.  That aside, the first four episodes cover about 48 hours of the young couple's reunion.  The fifth episode has the couple getting a greenlight to live together with a HUGE caveat.  You'll have to watch to see what that is.
While there is some fanservice in the first four episodes, it goes to the extreme when the character of Tina is added to the cast.  The fanservice (gratuitous shots of girls in their panties, revealing outfits, nudity, jiggling breasts, etc.) is the only negative to this series.  If you thought ""Hand Maid May"" has a lot of fanservice, this series has TONS more!  It is all uncalled for and screws with what otherwise would be a perfect romantic-comedy.
As to the DVD, Pioneer actually does this one right!  Usually I complain about how they subtitle their titles.  This time, they use ALL Japanese honorifix in the subtitles which is great.  I know some people don't like this, but honorifix don't translate well into English.  The honorifix are needed because it helps you to understand how the characters relate to each other.  Japanese are big on a hierarchy system in their society and since this is a Japanese title, keeping this helps the viewer get a better understanding of the Japanese in general as well as the characters in the story.
The English dub is also well done, though there are a few rough spots, especially with Tina.  Some of the honorifix survive in the English dub including ""sempai"". The ""-dono"" honorific gets translated as ""Sir"" which didn't really fit.  At times ""-sama"" is translated (for Aoi when her keeper calls her ""Lady Aoi"") and at times it isn't (when Aoi calls Kaoru ""Kaoru-sama"").  The ""-kun"" suffix is dropped totally from the English dub but I don't mind since I appreciate the attempt on Pioneer's part.
Bottom line:  Great romance story to beat ""Oh My Goddess"" but the excessive fanservice will be a turnoff for some folks.  Those who watch subtitles should really appreciate the job done here to include the honorifix, and the Engish dub is good too.  Recommended for most anime fans, especially those who like harem romantic-comedy titles.",1054598400,12,2941,4.7328094302554025
1818743,4,B00007L4LH,"Okay, so this is another series where there are lots of cute girls surrounding a central 'doesn't quite know how to deal with girls' guy figure.  Yes, that's a well-canvassed storyline.  But don't let that basis for Ai Yori Aoshi fool you into thinking it's a same-old same-old.
  Far from it.
  Kaoru, our leading guy, has more depth than you may at first give him credit for.  This becomes more apparent as the series progresses, and it's well worth looking out for.
  As for Aoi- she's quite unlike any anime heroine I've come across before.  She has a strong but lighthearted devotion to Kaoru, and her mission in life is pretty much just to make him happy, thus securing her own happiness.  Again, don't let that fool you.  Her character has a sensitivity and maturity that the typical busty, stick-thin and crazily energetic anime girl lacks.  I found myself growing increasingly attatched to her as a character as the series progressed.
  The humour is pretty comparable with the usual anime fare- a mix of slapstick and risque situations provide the laughs, and do surprisingly well at it, in fact.
  Voice acting is good, my only real complaint being that Kaoru and Aoi say each others names a little too often.  I think the cuteness of it lets them off the hook most of the time though.
  Lighthearted and easy-going?  Yes.
  Amusing and entertaining?  Indeed so.
  Addictive?  I found it very addictive myself.  I guess it depends on whether romantic cliff-hangers get you intrigued or not.  They work on me!
  And the animation is not to be laughed at: it's quite simply beautiful, flawless and fluid and full of gorgeous colours.  A nice feature for any anime.
  All in all, a charming and adorable series with good character development, a welcome splash of depth, and a knack for knocking you out of complacency every now and then with a surprising reality-check.
  If you enjoy romantic dramas, and fancy something a little bit different from the norm, I advise you to give this one a go.  You'd be hard pressed to do much better, and you could do a lot worse.
  Oh, and (importantly, I think) the ending is satisfying and cute.  ^_^",1051747200,11,2149,4.6873315363881405
1818744,5,B00007L4LH,"Really; it's not.
I heard many people seeing the first 6 episodes, noticing Aoi's submissive nature and seeing Tina and Taeko entering the equation, and the end result of said people's equation is: ""Oh, this is Love Hina with a twist, right?"" or ""I saw OMG and Aoi has less of a spine than Belldandy has!"" Sorry guys, but I beg to differ.
First of all: Kaoru is nothing like Keitaro or Keichi: the only thing they have in common is the first letter of their given name. Kaorufs character has balls; he knows what he wants, lives on his own and had the courage to leave his family where he had a solid future as the sole inheritant of the Hanabishi Company and fortune. But he chose not to.
Aoi is submissive, yes. She will do anything for her beloved Kaoru. But that has some reasons: she was raised that way, following the Japanese tradition of the arranged marriage, and the fact that they played together when they were little helped contribute to that. But Aoi isnft Belldandy; she knows what she wants, has the courage to get away from her powerful family to reach one of her goals and she knows how to play her guardian Miyabi to get what she wants.
I have watched the whole series two times, and Ifm currently watching it for the third time off of DVD. The music is great and makes my heart melt, every time I listen to the soundtrack. On a side note; I refuse to listen to the English dub, so I donft know if they changed the music on the dub track. The reason for this is that Aoifs English voice doesnft fit her at all and when I tried it, I began to tremble in agony, reaching for the remote to reset the language to Japanese again. I know the English VAfs generally try their best to give the characters a good voice, but this one doesnft cut the mustard for me.
About the episodes: True; the series start off with quite a serious tone, telling the initial stories of Kaoru and Aoi and why they lived their lives until the point where we start to watch the story and after 8 episodes, the story seems to go dependant of the fanservice. But not all is what it seems, and I urge everyone who turned it down because of that, to give the series a second try.
The songs Towa no Hana (Eternal Flower; series OP) and Namo Shirenu Hana (Anonymous Flower; series ED) contribute perfectly to the series magic and I recommend this series to anyone who likes this genre of anime, because itfs just a great series.
Technically; the release is great. Colours are clean and crisp, no cross-coloration or aliasing occurred while playing the discs on my region-free Philips DVD622 dvd-player.
The menus are responding quickly and switching to a sub-menu is done with animations short enough to keep them from being annoying. The menus themselves are made as photographs, with the options on the border of the photographs.
Audio tracks and subtitle tracks can be chosen independently of each other; you can decide if you want to see it in English or Japanese, either with or without subs covering all translations or just things as signs.

7977679,5,B00007L4LH,"I am a sucker for romances ill admit. If you check out the rest of the reviews that i have written the majority of them go to romance. Anyways Ai yori aoishi starts off with a girl name Aoi and a boy named Kaoru. Both of them were to become husband and wife as soon as they were old enough, but something happens and Kaoru decides to leave the hanabishi clan. Aoi has been desperately trying to find kaoru wanting to become his wife. It has been her life dream to be with the one whom was so kind to her when they were children.

Ep. 1 The episode starts off with Kaoru being in college and Aoi being on a train. Aoi has the intention of becoming Kaoru's wife, but thats if he even still remembers her. When Aoi finally arrives to the train station she finds herself living a similar scenery involving her child hood with this young man. This man then decides to take Aoi where she needs to go because based on how she was dressed and how clueless she looked he didn't want her to get lost. In any case it was also on the way to his home. What a coincidence huh? I won't say anymore otherwise Im gonna spoil this episode.

Ep. 2 Aoi and Kaoru are reunited and both of them spend the night in Kaoru's room. Since Kaoru has only one futon, being the gentleman that he is he lets Aoi sleep in it. It turns out that Aoi likes to cling onto things in her sleep.....so im gonna leave it at that. In the morning Aoi starts her new life acting as Kaoru's wife, so she decides to cook, clean and do his laundry. After all that it ends with a hilarious scene.

Ep. 3 Aoi is confronted by this woman named miyabi and is forced to go back with her to Aoi's family. Since Aoi just ran away to tokyo, Kaoru did not realize that and so when he was asked to go back to the hanabishi clan he just couldn't accept it. In the end Aoi manages to escape and they both return to the place they first met. After that Kaoru comes down with a fever and Aoi ends up taking care of him. We also lean an important part in this episode. It explains why Kaoru took off from the hanabishi clan and In my opinion i would have done the same thing. Then in the end Aoi ends up leaving with her mom, BUT she only left so that she could get her supplies and be back with her beloved husband.

Ep. 4 Since both Aoi and Kaoru are now living together, the Aoi family decide to move them to a bigger location. Aoi is now acting as a landlord and this is to prevent a huge scandal in the Aoi family because Aoi was supposed to be a girl for the head of the Sakuraba family. So with that in mind lets just say that miyabi changes her mind about how Kaoru is and decides to accept him in a way.

Ep. 5 The last and final episode. This was an eye opener for me ill admit. It starts off so beautifully with the two couple reunited, but i guess that wasn't the case for this episode. A girl named Tina comes into Kaoru's life once again. So this alone brings many various adventures.

In the end I truely enjoyed how this series started. I am looking forward to finishing this anime in my collection and hopefully it ends like it is supposed to. I recommend this dvd to anyone who enjoys watching a couple coming together.",1133136000,7,3176,4.089887640449438
