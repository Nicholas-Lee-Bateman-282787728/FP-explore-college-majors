8441293,1,B004U7EIO8,This was bad. I liked M.U.S.H. but this and Fraidy Cat were terrible.  I still want to see the Uncle Croc Block segments,1468454400,,120,4.217391304347826
8441294,1,B004U7EIO8,"This is a piece of trash animation they fed children in the mid-seventies.  Now that children from that era are in their 40's and older, the crime rate all over the country has gone down considerably.  Coincidence?  Don't be fooled by any nostalgic-minded entreaties to watch this.  You never saw it for a reason, and that is because you were watching Shazam! and Isis.  There is no value at all in this work. The animation is terrible, even by 70's standards, the voices are retreads, the ""jokes"" are improbable, unfunny ""slapstick"" and their tag lines are cribbed from the Honeymooners and Three Stooges.  I watched fascinated through one episode the way an anthropologist might watch a ritual beheading in an indigenous tribal ceremony.  By the time I realized what was really happening, it was too late.  It is my understanding that the US government forced them to burn all copies of this thing to avoid a raft of health violations charges.  Looks like one got out.

In other words, its awful.  Don't bother.",1433980800,,1013,4.797687861271676
