Lifetime Movies are my guilty pleasure and I usually put them on to laugh at them, but I must say this one had some real emotion so it gets an A+ for Lifetime movie standards.",1460073600,2,315,3.787878787878788

3872373,3,B0028EQMPS,"my brother married this man's sister.  I watched the movie because I wanted to better understand her issues/family, but the movie didn't do a very good job of any background leading up to what happened, poor demonstration of what happened during the abduction.  He was schizophrenic but not evident by the portrayal in the movie.  Its a made for tv movie... it is what it is...",1433635200,,377,4.681818181818182

3872377,5,B0028EQMPS,"This movie brought me to tears, I think everyone should watch this movie and learn from this girl, I am 22 and wouldn't of thought of half the things she did. I think the biggest part of her returning home was the fact that Tony Zappa still had an ounce of humanity left in in, and Anne spoke to that part of him. This could've ended very differently, and I'm glad that it didn't. Must watch!",1426809600,,392,4.171052631578948

3872416,4,B0028EQMPS,Interesting story about Anne Sluti and her courageous and wise ways of leaving clues for the FBI to find her.,1399680000,,109,4.5
3872417,5,B0028EQMPS,These movies were great I had seen both these stories on a show on tv and watching the movie really tells their story well! Although it was very unfortunate what happened to them they are interesting stories,1399161600,,207,4.621621621621622
3872418,5,B0028EQMPS,The acting is so on point and believable. I read Elizabeth Smart's book and the movie is true to her HORRIFIC abduction. Taken in broad daylight is on spot also. It's just hard to know sweet James Van Der Beek had to play the bad guy!! That's good acting!! These movies are great!!! It just makes you so concerned for young girls. I would say this is a watcher for young girls and adults to realize that this can happen anyone.,1397692800,,427,4.283950617283951

3872430,3,B0028EQMPS,"The story is mostly about the abduction luckily.  Good to have your teen watch for awareness purposes.  What is amazing to me is how many American's won't get involved in fear of being hurt.  Frustrating, especially when its happening to a young girl that could easily have been your own daughter.",1394150400,2,297,4.784313725490196
3872431,3,B0028EQMPS,"I thought I was ordering the book and then the package arrived and it was a DVD - not only one, but 2 DVD's. I also ordered another book and I ordered a used one in good condition, supposedly and I received a brand new book. I've order many things from Amazon for many years and I've never had this happen before. I can't believe it was my mistake - don't know who is to blame.",1392768000,,377,3.973684210526316
3872432,5,B0028EQMPS,"This Double Feature DVD is excellent.

Both stories are true and both are riveting.

I have nothing but respect for the two women portrayed.",1392681600,,140,4.791666666666667
3872433,3,B0028EQMPS,"Eh, a pair of true-life stories about young daughters getting kidnapped. I wasn't that impressed with the dialog or acting - it must be tough for an actor to play someone else instead of putting some of their own personality into the roles. To me it seemed like the police came off as prejudiced lazy and stupid and the acting regarding the family's religion was not believable.",1391731200,,378,4.656716417910448
3872434,5,B0028EQMPS,This is a wonderful movie and have seen it since it came out and still love it till now. Loving see the drama in it,1390262400,,115,3.64
3872435,5,B0028EQMPS,"The courage and intelligence of this wonderful young girl whilst under such terrifying circumstances are remarkable.  The film keeps one totally engaged right to the end. Except for one scene, I think it would be good for teens to watch. Overall it is a very good movie.",1388707200,,270,4.74468085106383
3872436,3,B0028EQMPS,"I found ""Taken in Broad Daylight"" to be well done.  I didn't particularly care for the lackluster acting in ""Elizabeth Smart Story.""  I thought they stopped auditioning actors a bit too soon.  Still a good value, considering that there are two stories for the price of one.",1384646400,,273,4.76595744680851
3872437,4,B0028EQMPS,"Truth is stranger than Fiction as they say. Not wishing this would happen to us, well put together and acted.",1383782400,,109,4.5
3872438,3,B0028EQMPS,"Felt it didn't really cover the whole story, lots of things were not told in the Elizabeth Smart Story that could have been told.",1383350400,,129,4.416666666666667
3872439,2,B0028EQMPS,Another worthless movie. Just made for money and shouldn't have bought it.  I threw my money away on junk and wish I hadn't,1381795200,,123,4.3478260869565215
3872440,3,B0028EQMPS,i liked how sometimes hollywood brings true stories to light though the sdtories were sad but atleast their was relief in the end,1379808000,,129,4.6521739130434785
3872441,4,B0028EQMPS,two very easy to watch family movies without all the noise that we get on TV without too much drama,1378512000,,99,4.0
3872442,5,B0028EQMPS,They both are very sad movies but very eye opening to how the world really is and how even if your not a little kid your safety can be taken,1376697600,,140,3.7
3872443,4,B0028EQMPS,Great eye-opening movie. Perfect for all parents to watch with their children. Older film but great message for all youngsters out there.,1376611200,,137,5.2727272727272725
3872444,5,B0028EQMPS,"I am a crime-drama fan, and followed the Elizabeth Smart story since it began. The movie seemed right on, and had you involved from the very beginning. Having followed the original story, and sort of knowing what was coming in the movie, made it interesting and still had me on the edge of my seat. Both of these movies are worth the watch!",1376438400,,340,4.412698412698413

3872446,5,B0028EQMPS,Fast Shipping!  These movies are true stories that are very sad.  I still remember when Elizabeth Smart went missing.  Her poor parents.  Oh what a story.,1373241600,,154,4.8076923076923075
3872447,5,B0028EQMPS,they were great movies and I would tell people to watch them especially if they like true stories like I do,1370304000,,107,4.142857142857143
3872448,4,B0028EQMPS,"Reviewed this film on Showtime, but kept missing the subtle plot lines.  Decided to purchase it - great viewing without all the advertising!!  James Van Der Beek  shows he is more than the youngster in ""Dawson's Creek""!!  If one sees him on the street after this film, he might have a bit of criticism as a ""bad dude""!!",1369699200,3,319,4.448275862068965
3872449,4,B0028EQMPS,"I liked the movie; because of all the media, read the book, unique story, and had a happy ending, I wanted to watch the movie and to have it for my collection (of true crime)",1368835200,3,174,4.0
3872450,4,B0028EQMPS,I bought this for my significant other who got interested after watching a trailer at work.  The ending was nopty what she expected.,1367798400,,132,4.739130434782608
3872451,4,B0028EQMPS,"Both of these movies were excellent, I like the fact that I received Elizabeth Smart story as a bonus, I seen it on Life Tiem quite some time ago and glad I now own it.",1367798400,2,168,3.8285714285714287
3872452,5,B0028EQMPS,Excellent service. I would recommend anyone to buy from them. It was in good shape and got it in the time presented in the ad. Glad you had it available to purchase at a good price. This was an awesome video. Thank you.,1364428800,,219,4.116279069767442
3872453,5,B0028EQMPS,Both movies were very informative.  The Elizabeth Smart Story gave a good discription of what she went through without dramatizing any of the numerous rapes that took place.  It was enough said by showing he considered her his wife.,1364169600,,232,4.923076923076923
3872454,4,B0028EQMPS,Watched this a long time but I remember it being a pretty good film.  You can tell it was edited for TV.,1363910400,,104,3.727272727272727
3872455,5,B0028EQMPS,A riveting account of a horrible ordeal of a young girl. Makes you wonder how she every arose from this trying situation.,1363651200,,121,4.545454545454546
3872456,5,B0028EQMPS,I enjoyed the movies and the actual happenings. I think she got use to situation because she could have gotten away.,1357516800,,116,4.571428571428571
3872457,4,B0028EQMPS,good moviewe liked it but its a little scary because its a real story. mostly a block buster night. ok,1355616000,,102,4.15
3872458,4,B0028EQMPS,"I guessed from the cover that this would be an above-average movie and I wasn't disappointed. It was actually more exciting than 75% of the big budget Hollywood action thrillers I've seen recently. The dialogue was terse but moved the plot along nicely and there were plenty of
""OMG is she going to make it"" moments. Subtracted 1 because of some awkward scenes and annoying soundtrack but overall this is probably a better investment of your time and $$$ than going to the theater.",1355011200,,481,4.738095238095238
3872459,1,B0028EQMPS,I thought I saw it has subtitle or closed caption.  But it was not.  It is useless for me to watch.,1353888000,2,99,3.6666666666666665
3872460,5,B0028EQMPS,"Two for the price of less than one!!!  These were great family movies.  Children need to watch movies like this with their parents, so they can explain certain questions the kids may have.  It is also very educational and informing.  Will be buying more.  Don't miss this deal!",1346112000,3,277,4.6875
3872461,4,B0028EQMPS,"THESE ARE TWO SEPERATE TRUE STORYS..About abduction of young girls. One is very good, the second not so good. The Elizabeth Smart story, concentrates more on her family waiting at home for news of their daughter, than what is happening with her. The second movie, Taken in Broad Daylight, is alot more interesting. About a very disturbed young guy who snatches a girl, and takes her away with him. I couldn't figure out why he took her in the first place, as nothing seemed to make sense. But later on in the movie he explains why he went and did it. I think he was just a very lonely young man. My pick of the Two movies is TAKEN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT.",1342656000,7,649,4.327868852459017
3872462,4,B0028EQMPS,"James Van Der Beek is surprising in ""Taken in Broad Daylight"".  no sign of his ""Dawson"" character at all!  I was pleasantly surprised at his ability to play such an evil person.  The story was good and the acting superb.  The reason I don't give this 5 stars is because they weren't accurate about the towns in MT that they traveled through.  It's not a big deal, but it would have been much better if they had been more accurate.

The Elizabeth Smart story was extremely good, and the acting was superb in this movie, too.  If I were to rate this movie by itself, I would definitely give it 5 stars.  In both of these movies, the kidnapped girls were the definition of brave, and I truly admire them both.  I wholeheartedly  recommend these movies!",1339113600,8,749,4.4411764705882355
3872463,5,B0028EQMPS,How terribly sad for the Smart family. How embarrassing for the authorities ! ! Do the Authorities even know their shame?  Whatever good comes to Elizabeth Smart is certainly deserved.,1336003200,,184,5.133333333333334

3872466,4,B0028EQMPS,"i watched a whole day of lifetime movies based on real life criminal events (craigslist killer, story of elizabeth smart...) Taken in broad daylight was my favorite. it was great acting that was really eye opening. movies portraying real stories like this really need good actors so more people will see them. i had so many emotions just knowing this all happened in real life. i loved the wit of anne sluti and look up to her for her ""matter-of-fact"" attitude which no doubt helped to get her out of her situation.  if anyone was to be kidnapped, it was her... there is no messing with her and she made sure you knew it. i admire her bravery and the calm and smarts she was able to keep during such a traumatizing time. i am glad her story is out to make other aware. her situation did not happen in vain and i am glad she is alive and well today.",1330300800,20,848,4.267080745341615

I hope her life since has been wonderful.  she deserves peace and happiness!",1329955200,,376,4.5
