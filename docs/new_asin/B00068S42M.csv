2176360,1,B00068S42M,"First and foremost, this movie is bad.  Not bad compared to Lord of the Rings bad, but bad compared to say, your six year old's elementary school stage adaptation of Lord of the Rings.

This is the story of some guy named Westender.  Apparently he used to be a big shot for some reason but that's not important enough to ever discuss.  He's drunk and sad because someone for some reason burned his wife a long time ago but that's not explained either so don't bother looking.  Now he and this gypsy lady miss her.  The only thing he has to remember her by is her ring which last night in a drunken game of some kind of wooden poker he lost.  Now he must set off across Oregon, er...whatever kingdom they're living in, to get it back from the slavers who stole it from the guy who stole it from him within one week's time so he can run away with his new gypsy friend whom we never hear about again so don't bother looking for that either.  Thus begins about two hours of walking.  The first hour he walks through the forest with a new found friend and the occasional fight scene apparently choreographed by that same elementary school troupe.  Eventually he falls into a river and his buddy inexplicably runs away and he winds up at the beach, er..the desert, or both seemingly.  Thus begins a good 15-20 minutes of him walking interrupted only by the occasional bout of uncontrollable crying and flailing about.  He finally tracks down the slavers but their nasty leader who carries the ring flees and he must make the grand hero's choice to chase the ring or stay and help the random slave girls who have no lines and don't even show the obligatory nudity that so often turns terrible films into terrible films with boobs.

Dialogue is almost non-existent in this film which is actually a plus, as the few lines that are uttered only serve to highlight the atrocious writing and amazingly worse delivery of the dare-I-say ""actors"".  Oddly enough, the production values of the movie and even the DVD itself, which has a few extras, are relatively high for an independent film.  This only makes one wonder how someone managed to pitch this travesty to someone else who in turn forked over money for the endeavor and why, with such powers, aren't they ruling the world.  Avoid this film.  In fact, go and drink heavily for several hours.  Go now...live free.",1098403200,13,2356,4.542654028436019

2176382,3,B00068S42M,"This is a mediocre film, and whilst not being an epic is certainly thought provoking. Considering this movie is not made by a huge film studio it is a worthy attempt at making a film. There are some flaws to the movie as mentioned in a few other reviews. The amount of film time just concentrated on the main character walking was a waste of movie time. It certainly begs the question what's wrong with riding horses. Also you see that Asbrey the main character has some deep seated issues but the film does not really explore those. Thus it is hard to relate to this character. The film also makes reference to Asbrey losing his lifes love but again it is so vague you don't really know what happened. Really the main draw to this film is seeing this man wrestle with his own personal ghosts but sadly this is just not explored enough and you are left needing an explanation. Some scenes are slightly odd and this is because the plot is just not developed well enough. Some decent fighting scenes are in this movie as well as some reasonable acting by some unknowns. Certainly i would not watch this movie over and over again but i feel it is worth a look.",1159142400,,1157,4.386046511627907
2176383,4,B00068S42M,"Okay this is not 'Excalibur' but it's a decent movie, and not as bad as the reviews here imply.  I have watched Westender twice now and enjoyed it more on the second viewing.  That's a rare occurrence. About the walking, it is a ""journey"" movie and walking or horseback was the only option in UK knight days. Sure, for storytelling purposes, I would have thrown in a horse ride for good measure somewhere along the line.  But the walking scenes in this movie are actually shorter in length than the walking scenes in the 'Good, Bad & the Ugly'.  Okay, I know it's apples to oranges, but you get the point.  As a video editor myself, I would have cut out about sixty seconds of the walking scenes, true.  But otherwise it holds together pretty well, and is beautifully photographed. Most people can identify with the theme of life as trial, because life is a pretty g.d. dismal trial after all, if people were honest about it. Some people come out with a more intact karma on the other side than others, even if nobody gets out alive: it all depends on how you look at it. To me that is what the movie was all about, and I liked it. Maybe I read too much into it, but I liked it, so gave it 4 stars.",1158364800,3,1198,4.255506607929515

Also You tend to see that the world of westender is full of peril.  But that is par for the course when your battles are faught with no armour and swords.

2176385,1,B00068S42M,"Which is what I said through the entire movie...

(THIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS)

This is not a good movie...it's pretty...but it's not good

Now it was not completely wretched, the cinematography deserves every accolade that it may receive, the beautiful landscape of Oregon is very well filmed. (I particularly liked the shots of Asbrey with the snow falling, both with the felled knight and afterwards) The score is also worth mentioning, this was a fully realized score, not a simple synthesizer created orchestra. It is a big help in creating a nice experience while watching the film.

That is unfortunately where my accolades must end. I am not sure where to start...

Perhaps this comment will frame my view on this movie ""Lord of the G-Strings without the sex and wit"" Now please listen to me...I am not holding up Lord of the G-Strings as a great piece of cinema (though it is funny from time to time), but you can see where I am going with this.

Characters: None were developed at all. I am sure there is an argument that Asbury was very well developed, given that it is his story, but it would be a weak argument. The biggest evidence of the non-existent development is the fact that only 2 characters are given names in the film. Asbury is one, and a guy who gets killed is the other. Yet in the cast list and end credits, almost everyone has a name, yet you have no clue as to who they are referring to...Is Glim the minstrel? Or the slaver? Which of the women's names is his wife's? (We assume it is his wife, but it is never said) Who was the gypsy? Why was she in that vision?  Why should we care?

The costuming budget obviously went to Asbury and, for some reason, the foreign warrior at the end. Glim's (That is apparently the name of the minstrel/Jester) costume just looked odd. And all of the miscellaneous soldiers seemed to be wearing felt tunics with black pants they brought from home. Now I can forgive a lot of this due to the budget restrictions they were obviously under and I actually give them a lot of credit for stretching things as far as they did. Though I think giving your hero a huge scar and black eye in the first scene is kind of a mistake.

The script...well...it was just awful...it really was. The plot was very formulaic (When Asbury found the cottage we all knew that either a Beautiful woman or an old wise man would come in behind him. I called the thing about the door too, though it really came out of left field.) The dialogue was almost thrown in as an afterthought. There also seemed to be a very forced ""He must lose all of his stuff"" scene. (Why would he have taken both swords into the fight instead of leaving Glim as backup?  not very good backup albeit...) And a swordsman would never sleep with his blade stuck in the ground as he slept...it would damage the blade, even if it was just sand. Nitpicky I know, but there needs to be attention to detail in order for any film to work. Due to the low quality of the script, the acting is a toss up. It is sometimes hard to tell if an actor is doing his best with bad dialogue, or if they are making bad dialogue worse. I would not say that any of them are good actors, though the old man was oddly quite a bright spot. Glim was especially bad, while I was sitting there I thought of at least 5 more appropriate ways to deliver almost all of his dialogue. Now this may not completely be his fault, but I will address this next. (As an aside, this actor also wrote the entire score to the film...and bravo to him for it, but he should stick with his day job...or his night job...whichever one writing music is.)

Finally is the direction, now this is where I think the movie was lacking most of all. There are simply too many shots that are held for far too long. Asbury walks...a lot...alone...not talking...at all. Or he looks into the distance for a long long time. (The sideways shot in this scene however is very nice, but would have been equally poignant at half the length) Or he runs...a long long way...it is like that scene in Monty Python and the Holy Grail where Lancelot is getting closer and closer to the castle. A little cutting down of those scenes would have opened the door for (here's a novel idea) more plot or at least better development of the backstory. SPOILER Especially why his wife was killed and what that had to do with his disenchantment with his calling as a protector. Or were the two things not related? Which came first, the huge battle where he is obviously weary, or the burning?END SPOILER I also think that the director is a little bit to blame with the poor performances of some of the actors. Surely he could have coaxed out slightly better performances. Take Asbury's many angry scenes. A little bit better editing or re-thinking of the scenes would have turned them from the little tantrums that they came across as, into genuine moments of agony and rage.

Now there are many more things to address, but this review is getting quite long, so I will end it there...",1126742400,4,5012,4.42407809110629

2176387,5,B00068S42M,"...WHERE HEROS ONCE STOOD, LONG SHADOWS HAVE FALLEN... That is on the cover of this DVD case and of the hundreds of DVD's that I own, this is now a personal favorite. I never heard of the film until I saw it in Sam Goody's and read the jacket. I took a chance on it and was very pleased. This is more inspiring than entertaining, more of a thinking man's film than a neatly spoon-fed plot where no mystery is left unexplained.

A hero, as highly regarded as any knight could hope to be, looses everything with the death of his love and sinks into the lowest of states in his depression. Nothing has any meaning anymore except the last symbol of his lost love in a material object, a ring lost in a drunken gamble. It is the thinest of straws for a drowning man to grasp but he sets out to recover it and along the way, recovers much more, his humanity, honor, and self respect.

I have always enjoyed this genre of film (medieval warrior films) and have many in my collection and have never been moved to write a review on any before but am complelled to do so by the narrow views taken by others here. Only a low budget film 'could' have focused on an inner struggle and not been overshadowed by special effects. The natural landscape and music more than make up for this. I even appreciated the ending with 'honor restored and life continues' without needed everything wrapped neatly into an ending. It has no end. It is a beginning with hope for all that is good to be set on the path once again.

My only main criticism was the mystical dog. Man does have a symbiotic relationship with that animal but this was either completely overdone (magical and appears when needed and does what is needed) or underdone (the relationship is not developed enough). It is a real film without action every second but the fight scenes seem more realistically timed throughout.

Great film. Bring your brain and enjoy the Oregon background and musical score while you are there. No matter how bad things get, there is always a chance and hope for redemtion of the goodness of the human spirit that you can find deep down within yourself (not relating to religion) and in us all, knights or otherwise.",1122940800,14,2188,4.4625

If one page equal one mimute of film time, that means there were actual pages saying. ""He's walking.""  Page 2.  ""He's still walking.""  Page 60  ""He's still walking.""

I understand the film crew and volunters doubled as actors (that explains so much--trust me) and now they are on Amazon writing rave reviews for this DVD.  Let's cut to the chase.  This is a absolute waste of time and money.  Consider yourself warned.",1120435200,4,713,4.754098360655738
2176389,1,B00068S42M,"I love fantasy and SF in film, from cheesy Japanese rubber suiters to big budget Spielberg. Bad films have their own peculiar charm. It pains me to report that ""Westender"" is a bona fide bomb that fails on just about every level.
It's an attempt to combine several genres, which as we've all seen can work pretty well. The problem is, it does all of them badly.
The ""Heroic Quest"" forms the basis of the plot. Without giving too much away, the story line is as formulaic and generic as you can get...MINUS the final moment of resolution/redemption that usually caps this kind of film. It didn't really end...it just sort of...stopped. Roll credits.
But there are a few other film styles that waft through this stinker like farts on a breeze. They include:
- The ""Metaphysical Journey of Exploration"", exemplified (and much parodied) by directors like Bergman and Antonioni. This accounts for the interminable sequences of the sun-baked hero staggering across vast wastes. This is Symbolic, you see, of his Inner Emptiness: and the grass on the far side of the desert is Symbolic of his Newly Awakened and Heightened Spiritual Consciousness. Phew. Pretty darned mystical. There isn't an interesting idea to be found in the whole nine hours of the film. (Yes, I know what the duration on the label says. But it FEELS like nine hours. At least.)
- ""Revisionist Medievalism"" (in the style of ""Ladyhawke"" or ""Princess Bride"") wherein people in Middle Ages costumes and settings exhibit contemporary characters and language. It can be funny. Here, it's just inconsistent and annoying.
- ""Hommage"", in which characters and situations borrowed from other films pop up, presumably to show us the director is aware of them. So we have little moments that resemble low-budget Kurusawa, Boorman, Fellini, and others. If the film worked, these might have been amusing. It doesn't, and they're not, except as a mild distraction on your descent into torpor.
Several external reviewers have commented on the ""stunning beauty"" and ""epic grandeur"" of the scenery: that's what suckered me into renting it. Be warned: if you take a camera somewhere beautiful and shoot a wide shot, you're going to have a nice looking shot. Oregon is a pretty place, and there are lost of shots of Oregon.

2176390,4,B00068S42M,"This was a lower budget movie. Rather than spend what limited money they had a cheesy special effects they went the esoteric, artful route. That actually worked well. Frankly, it was refreshing to see a moving of this genre that was not all fake places, people and things. Oregon is a beautiful state as well. The pace was a bit slow, although, not as bad as some of the big budget junk out lately. Hey, the guy was on the ""proverbial spiritual quest"". It takes time. My only real knock on this movie is that it ends before it gets started. Just when he finds himself and the real action looks like it's going to begin,, the movie ends. It turns out to be the first installment. But was it good? I must admit, I want to see what happens next. So I guess it was that good.",1112486400,6,771,4.216216216216216
2176411,5,B00068S42M,"Easily the greatest Arthur epic ever filmed, auteur Brock manages to combine the best elements of ""Camelot"" ""Arthur"" ""Lord Of The Rings 2"" and ""First Knight"" into a transporting and thought provoking genre piece that jousts with the mind and emotions as effortlessly and as skillfully as the lead character does onscreen.

The subtleties in the developments of the antagonists relationship with himself exceed in metaphor Dustin Hoffman's performance in ""The Graduate.""  Thankfully the film maker is lavish in his cuts, and the richness of the film is allowed to mature gracefully in the scenes focused entirely, and only, on the lead character.

2176415,3,B00068S42M,"Compared to the major studios' big budget medieval period pieces such as ""The Lord of the Rings"" ""King Arthur"", or even ""Timeline"", this is not even in the same league of course. So don't go into it with high expectations. But as a small, independent film done by first time filmmakers on an extremely limited budget, it's not half bad. The score and photography really carry the film. It looks very impressive most of the time. Beautiful locations. And director Brock Morse shows a lot of promise and has obvious talent. I did have some problems with the story/script. It's a bit 'artsy' and strange, with characters coming and going out of nowhere and a lot left unexplained...all of which I'm sure was intentional, so it really depends on your personal taste. My biggest disappointment however was with the DVD. One of the main reasons I would even bother to buy one of these independent cheapo films is because I am interested in the filmmaking process and I love to hear the creators (writer, director) talk about their film. I love to see the behind-the-scenes footage on how their first film came to be, the trials, tribulations, triumphs they had to endure to make the movie. I want to see interviews with the actors, director, writer, cast and crew in general, etc. Well, unfortunately NONE of this is included. There are no commentary tracks whatsoever, which is a shame and somewhat surprising. There are no interviews, no making-of sequences, nothing of note really at all. There is a 3 to 5 minute promo called The Creation of Westender but it is shallow and pretty worthless, essentially a commercial for the film. Where are these filmmakers and why did they not get more involved in this DVD? Most of the time I notice novice filmmakers are eager and delighted to share their movie and are all over the DVD. Not here. It feels somewhat abandoned. And to top it off, the DVD has English sub-titles (which are for the hearing impaired I assume since the movie is in English) that cannot be turned off (!) They are permanently present, which is a bit distracting. So anyway, overall, not a bad first film by director Brock Morse. It's quite impressive considering the low budget. It looks truly beautiful at times ...but it would have been a LOT more enjoyable if the DVD had included more than just the film.",1104364800,4,2321,4.705159705159705

I think this is an excellent jumping off point for them both and one not to miss as i believe that we will be seeing much much more from both of these talented men",1103414400,9,528,3.94392523364486
2176417,4,B00068S42M,"As a wanna-be filmmaker myself I am always keeping tabs on low-budget (or ""NO budget"" as the case may be) independent films. When a new director comes onto the scene, I think it is always worth checking out their first film to see if they have potential to be a great filmmaker (the Coen brothers' ""Blood Simple"" and Robert Rodriguez's ""El Mariachi"" denotes just that). Thus, when the movie ""Westender"" played at a local arthouse theatre, I was interested to see it (my interest piqued even more by the fact that it was shot almost entirely in the beautiful state of Oregon, where I live, and the writer/director Brock Morse is from my resident town of Corvallis). Of course, having seen so many poor independent films in my time, I wasn't expecting very much. I was pleasantly surprised when the film turned out to be really quite good.

The movie takes place in a fantasy medieval time and chronicles the journey of a down-on-his-luck knight named Asbrey who goes in search of a precious ring he gambled away while in a drunken stupor. Along the way he meets a variety of characters including an eccentric old man who lives alone and imparts wisdom to the weary knight and a comical sidekick named Glim who starts out as a foe but becomes a friend. Since the dialogue is minimal, the story is told primarily through the images (which are stunning) and the spelndid music score (composed by Rob Simonsen who also plays Glim). The performances (particulary by lead actor Blake Stadel) are quite good as well.

Of course, the film is not perfect. Though it is only 103 minutes, it feels longer. I think another 10-12 minutes could have been trimmed off its running length without affecting the narrative. Also, on occasion the sound (which is typically the most lacking element of any independent film) is less than stellar. These shortcomings, however, are forgiveable and can, I think, be attributed simply to relative inexperience on the part of the filmmakers. I'm sure these aspects will be improved upon in their next feature.

Overall, ""Westender"" is an enjoyable cinematic experience and a very promising debut which should leave the viewer looking forward to future projects by its makers.",1103328000,8,2197,4.837765957446808
2176418,3,B00068S42M,"""Westender"" could be very good, if they'd cut about twenty minutes of the constant walking that the hero, Asbrey the Westender, does throughout the entire film.  The story goes something like this:  A once great knight falls from grace.  No one knows exactly what happened and it's never revealed.  He loses his most prized possession, his deceased wife's ring, in a game of chance while he's drunk.  He decides the next morning, after recovering from a hangover and a beatdown, that he must seek out the man who cheated him out of his ring. What happens after that is pretty standard for a fantasy flick like this.  Asbrey walks...a lot.  He walks through the forests, finds the guy who cheats him, befriends him, then walks some more.  He finds out that the guy who took his ring, a jester named Glim, was jumped by some slavetraders who in turn stole the ring from him.  Asbrey walks some more.  He finds the slavetraders but is captured.  The next morning he is set free by Glim, who then abandons him.  So now he walks alone.  He is lead by a mysterious wolf(I'm assuming it's his wife) and finds his sword, suit of armor, and a mysterious old man who teaches him that material things do not matter.  Asbrey walks some more, this time through a desert that looks something like a sandy beach.  He meets a few more people along the way.  Asbrey uses all of his time alone screaming, crying, and fighting his internal demons.  In the end, our hero must decide whether or not to do what is right or take a selfish turn.

This story could have been a lot better.  The idea of the knight fighting himself more than physical enemies is great, but it is dragged out over too much time of walking alone.  It's boring to watch this guy walk through the desert.  It's boring to watch this guy walk through the woods.  The dialogue is minimal, with emphasis placed on the beautiful music throughout the film.  The acting is pretty decent, especially considering that many of the characters are portrayed by volunteers and crew members.

Overall, this film isn't too terrible.  Just do yourself a favor and skim through the scenes where Asbrey wanders through the desert until he faces a few foes.  Considering the shoestring budget, the film and music is of very high quality.  It's worth a look simply for the beautiful scenes shot in the forests of Oregon.  When the movie is green, the colors are vibrant.  When the action moves to the desert, it becomes drab.

Recommended to fans of medieval fantasy and Arthurian legend, but be warned that this movie drags at a snails pace and the action is very limited.",1103155200,7,2605,4.587852494577007

8040398,3,B00068S42M,"Many reviewers, especially on Amazon.com, have poked fun at the 'walking sequences' of this film but I think they have completely missed the point of why this film was made in the first place, and also failed to appreciate just how much pleasure and satisfaction these passages afford the viewer if he isn't predisposed to be impatient for more action. The trouble is that most people will have bought this DVD on the strength of the cover, as I did myself, and that really isn't what the film is about.
In fact the film was made as a topographic advertisement for the natural beauties of the singularly varied landscape of Oregon with funding by their tourist board and, as most of the other reviewers have not failed to notice, using amateur actors. Admittedly American accents are not very welcome in a story set in some sort of medieval period even when not actually based on any real historical time of place but in the all-purpose medieval ethos familiar from many bad fantasy novels and Hollywood films it's something that we've often had to accept and even in films actually set in the Biblical times and the real Middle ages. So these amateur actors from Oregon don't need to apologise unduly, and it IS only their accents rather than their acting which is a problem.
Because of the nature of the Oregon landscape and choice of locations which I can call the 'art direction' the result is that the visual aspect of the film achieves a much better sense of a 'secondary world' ( in Tolkien's sense of the term) than any other fantasy film I have ever seen, including all those misguided and disappointing LOTR films of Peter Jackson's in which he chose landscapes with very little of the right English atmosphere they should have had, especially in the first of the three films. Even when he chose a location that would pass for some part of Middle Earth his art direction meant that it didn't come across with the sense of freshness and new appreciation which is the whole point of a 'secondary world'; there was no sense of natural wonder or magic. This film made in Oregon does a lot better and in those very 'walking sequences' other reviewers have made fun of.

Picaresque (and I do mean 'picaresque') stories, or Quest stories involving long journeys like The Fellowship of the Ring, need to dwell on the landscape the characters are travelling through because the mise en scene and landscape or natural settings are the main point of the story along with the occasional incident that occurs in that landscape, but without the landscape being strongly experienced and felt the story might as well be updated to the present day as in the updating of Herodotus in 'The Warriors' or any other modern version of the archetypal Quest story.
The story has also been much criticised largely again I feel because of the expectations of those who bought the film on the basis of the cover which leads one to believe that it is going to be a spectacular film of medieval warfare. In fact it is an allegory of someone recovering from a collapse into depression and addiction who has lost all self respect and the ring appears to represent his not being able to free himself from the experiences which have brought him low. In a nutshell you could say that the ring represents the selfishness and self pity of the selfhood and, because of the reluctance to let it go, to some extent the connection with addiction.
The story could have been better handled as it's all a bit messy, but the scenes of the main character walking through the beautiful woods and 'country' of Oregon which, except for the desert sequence at the end (important for the allegory), could easily stand in for England or Middle Earth, are a pleasure to watch and to experience the way they stimulate the imagination.
Perhaps the most important reason for watching this film is to get some idea of how Jackson should have approached landscape in LOTR and the Hobbit and judging by the number of people who don't seem to think he did anything wrong that's a pretty important reason in my book.

Watching this terrible movie actually caused me physical discomfort. The plot is so retarded that it probably can cause miscarriages. It's not even bad-good. It's so pretentious and takes itself too seriously to be enjoyed even as a rotten tomato. I hope that whoever directed this gets cancer. If you're thinking of buying it, poke yourself in the eyes with a stick instead. You'll enjoy yourself a million times more and save a little money. Even Twilight is a better movie.",1406246400,,602,4.798076923076923
8040400,5,B00068S42M,"I love this movie.

That said, this isn't a typical movie and tends to get expectations it doesn't fill.

This is a low-action medieval movie. This makes for an interesting view because most movies set in a medieval setting are heavy action movies about dragons, huge adventures or siege warfare. It is a rare film in this genre.

Westender has a small cast and is about a man that has hit rock bottom due to the death of his wife. He embarks on a low-dialogue spiritual journey to find his calling once again. That's it. No prophecy or no adventures through strange lands, just a simple man suffering from a loss.

The plot is very simple, the dialogue limited, and this movie is by no means epic.

So why do I love it?

Honestly, I find the core plot to be very down to earth. I can relate to our hero's depression. I see him dwell in his past, despite the pain. He can't get over his loss. And yet, events conspire to get him back on the right path. He struggles against fate, but finds himself on a road to self redemption. I find his journey inspiring and also very easy to relate to.",1323043200,2,1089,4.287804878048781

8040403,2,B00068S42M,"Buried somewhere deep within WESTENDER'S meandering script there's a good story waiting to break out.  And so for over an hour-and-a-half I watched and waited for that to happen.  Sadly, it never did.  WESTENDER is the story of a disgraced and disillusioned knight's struggle to come to terms with the brutal death of his beloved wife and his own identity.  There are a few quick flashbacks, but most of the backstory is left to the viewer's imagination.  There seems to be a war on, and the King desperately needs the sword of this once-great fighter, but Asbrey of Westender just wants to be left alone with his personal demons.  We follow Asbrey on a long, tedious trek through towering forests and barren desserts where he encounters jesters, hermits, and a strange otherworldy dog while haunted by visions of his wife and past wars.  On paper the plot doesn't sound half-bad, but in practice very little about it actually works.  Most of the film is simply one scene after another of Asbrey walking...and walking...and walking.  Nothing much ever happens to break the monotony.  The acting is respectable and the cast seems earnest, but to no avail. There's just not enough story here, and too much down time.  There is a little action mixed in, but not much.  A couple of characters who seem like they're going to be pretty important just disappear and never come back.  Asbrey's visions are sometimes rather interesting but also very cryptic and never fully explained.  The end of Asbrey's journey is abrubt, unconvincing and a hopeless anti-climax.  What just happened?  What, it's not over, is it?  Yes it is.  WESTENDER is obviously low-budget, but better characterization and more drama could have made up for that.  I've enjoyed many fantastic tales of heroic quests over the years, but WESTENDER may be the worst fantasy I've ever seen.  Poorly paced and awkwardly written, WESTENDER'S journey is best left unfollowed.",1216598400,,1931,4.956386292834891
8040404,1,B00068S42M,"Wow. I watch a LOT of film...and manage to enjoy most of it just for production's sake, or for my own edification. This takes the cake as something I tried to enjoy from ANY angle and just couldn't. I tried to stay awake for most of the film but actually fell asleep due to lack of plot.  I convinced myself to restart the film the following day thinking it couldn't get any worse. I was wrong.

Getting past the lousy quality of story and action, be warned that this DVD would not play on ANY of three computer DVD machines I normally use to watch movies (my personal plus two at work) and I was amazed that it loaded quickly into an older Sony component model DVD easily.

Don't waste your time, find something that offers any of the above instead: a story, some decent acting, passable cinematography, a good swordfight, beautiful scenery, lush music, pretty production elements. Westender has none of them.",1203120000,,910,4.570552147239264
8040405,3,B00068S42M,"I picked this movie up secondhand.  I'm not quite sure I agree with any of the reviewers who gave it 1 or 5 stars.  Rather than go into depth, I'll talk about what the movie does well, and what it does not do well.
What is done well:
1. the music.  Evocative score that far outdistances the movie.
2. use of Oregon's diverse natural scenery.  In fact, this movie should be a travel commercial for hiking through Oregon.
3. Subtlety.  There is a lot of personal struggle here, and it is very nicely woven into the script.
What is not done well:
1. dialogue.  the dialogue tends to be trite and, for lack of a better word, cheesy.  (That's ""corny"" to anyone younger than Gen X).  The dialogue is either way too earnest (falls on its face trying too hard) or does not take itself seriously. Either way, the dialogue adds little to, and detracts much from, the story.  The best parts of the movie have no lines!
2. editing.  Some of the scenes need to be shortened.  Some reviewers claim this entire movie is about walking. While it isn't that bad, there needed to be another round of editing.
3. the acting.  Aside from Blake Stadel, few of the cast actually stand out.  The jester is an exception: he stands out because he is glaringly bad.  Hampered by the worst lines in the film, this character fails to convince.  The gypsy woman (played, I think, by Darlene Dadras) is a character that needed a little more screen time--she managed to stand out in spite of her bad lines.

This movie seems to have garnered more than its share of attention, considering its budget and some of its glaring flaws.  There is something about the way Westender is put together that grabs hold of an archetypal struggle.  It was much easier than I expected to identify with the protagonist.

A look at the film website's project page reveals the goals of the team behind the film.  They wanted a story about an inner oddysey that had ""mainstream"" sensibilities (read: appears to be a plot-driven narrative).  Westender suffers from trying to be too many things at once.  I wanted more of what was good about this movie, because what was there was seriously hampered by its flaws. I hope that MOB productions learns from its first time out: focus on your strengths.

I will watch this movie several more times because there is truth in the archetypal themes of Asbrey's struggle.  But this will not be a fully enjoyable experience for me, as the weaknesses I mentioned above are glaring enough to detract from the story.

In short, this is a good film that only occasionally breaks free from its bad points.",1188604800,,2586,4.557483731019523
