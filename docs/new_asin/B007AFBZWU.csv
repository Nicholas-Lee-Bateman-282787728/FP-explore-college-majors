8513258,4,B007AFBZWU,"Just though I'd correct my review which was more or less a rant about region locking.  I just recently bought a Blu-ray player I could modify for other regions so thought I'd finally buy this.  What do I find, this disc is all regions.  So ignore the Region A information amazon reports as that isn't accurate.  I tested on various players either locked to Region B or set to Region A,B,C and in all cases this plays back fine.  You get 3 films which is pretty good value.  Now I've not watched them all the way just enough to know they work.  I'll put a review of the movies when I get to watch them but thought I should let the international audience know that they can watch this after all.

This has to be a first for an Echo Bridge / Miramax release to not be Region locked and it is very much appreciated.

I leave my original review bellow for historical sake so as to be transparent, I am fallible and I've since learned not to take the Region A info from Amazon at face value, it may be what the suppliers told them but isn't true in this case.  [...] is useful for region information however in the case of this title no one had supplied any before I bought it a few weeks ago.

------ Original Review ------
Once again a Blu-ray title is only available in the US and a world wide audience can't buy it due to region locking.  I'm region B and they have chosen to lock their product to Region A.  I really wanted Ordinary Decent Criminal and would have bought it right here and now if I could.  The movie studios wonder why there is piracy, well perhaps because paying customers can't buy the product even if they want to.  Sorry I just had to rant after about the 10th Blu-ray release I've wanted to buy today and couldn't (and aren't available anywhere else but the US currently).

Sadly I don't think distributors or studios ever pay attention to their customers, so they will never get the message.

As I had to put a rating I put 4 stars for what I remember as being a very good film ""Ordinary Decent Criminal"", of course my memory would be helped if I could actually buy the damn product.",1346457600,,2104,4.2727272727272725
