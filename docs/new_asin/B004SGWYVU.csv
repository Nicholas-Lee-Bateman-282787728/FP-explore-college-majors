8439688,1,B004SGWYVU,"This is a badly made film - bad story/plot, bad set, bad makeup, bad acting, bad and boring from the very beginning to the very end. A low budget film doesn't have to be this boring, at least for God's sake not at the very beginning, but this one disappoints from the very beginning...",1322611200,,285,4.296296296296297
8439689,1,B004SGWYVU,"Pros & Excons is the only, I repeat, the only movie I have ever stopped after 20 minutes, and thrown away. This movie has the camera work, lighting, and dialogue of a b-rate skin flick. The conversations are horrible and unbelievable, not because they are outrageous, but because they are too simple and not plausable. Many scene's look as though the director was attempting a Guy Ritchie British Gangster movie and FAILED miserably. Many of the actors look, and act, like they belong in the 5th or 6th spin off of American Pie. If you enjoy witty dialogue, a real plot, characters with more depth than the people from Jersey Shore, and/or anything interesting, AVOID THIS MOVIE. If however, you enjoy obese, non-muscular people intimidating good looking middle aged fit guys during a card game bet, or junior high level humor, then this movie is for you.",1320278400,,855,4.8231292517006805
8439690,1,B004SGWYVU,"After the first minutes of the movie you will realize it is the waste of money.
This is a cheap movie like those filmed in Hawaii or Florida.
Poor acting. Bad music. Bad sound. Actors look like never been filmed before.
The ""hacker"" fits xbox player's profile, not a computer geek.
You can make better movies with your iPhone.
I had to give at least 1 star, but really this movie deserves ""1 alert""

8439691,1,B004SGWYVU,"I remember when this movie was shooting, i was talking to the director about the premise of the film, the actors, the ""new HD"" camera, and i was thinking that this has the potential to be pretty good.

Boy was i wrong....this movie has had 3 plus different cuts, an australian TV movie release and about as many title changes. The story is poor, the acting is poor (i've worked these actors and know that they can do much better) and the Directing is poor. When i watched the film i had one of those moments, when you see the director acting in 3 different roles, you realise that Australia film has taken another blow for the worst.

I wouldn't waste my money on, Pro & Ex-cons/ 3 The Hard Way/ Fink!  no matter which name they put on this film its still crap, i feel sorry for Sam Worthington, he did his hard yards acting in anything that came along. Now that he's made a name for himself they release this crap with him all over the front cover as a marketing tool.

When you purchase your copy it should come with your money back and an extra 5 bucks for your trouble. Its not as bad a Gabriel (which i almost worked on, thank god i didn't) but it comes close.",1313625600,4,1165,4.210762331838565
8439692,2,B004SGWYVU,"This movie is confusing.  The plot is confused, the director is confused, I was confused, and I am betting you will be confused.  Don't get me wrong, the acting is better than average, although not by much.  The story line is very predictable, in a confused sort of way.  It is just that you are conscious all through the movie of the nagging question, ""What in the world is going on?""

It seems that everyone is a killer.  The hired professionals, the not-so professionals, crime boss, the lazy kids who want to do nothing the rest of their lives - all are or end up being killers.  Or else they end up dead.  And pretty much everyone ends up dead.

But there is a story line in there somewhere.  Actually, I think there are four story lines in there somewhere, and that might be part of the problem.

There is the one about the three ""partners"" who create a software program to steal millions from a bank.  There is the one about the crime boss trying to make sure people either pay up or die, and he uses just about anyone to do that.  There is the one about the professional hit team who is trying to take over the crime boss as the ones in control.  There is the one about the twenty-something children who spend all their time inventing ways to stay out of work and on welfare.  And there is the one about the undercover cops trying to run a sting operation on someone, although you never really know who is being stung.

Throughout the movie we jump from one story line to another so easily that we soon realize they are all beginning to overlap and affect each other.  The overlap is accomplished by the innovative means of having the killers so confused about who to kill that they end up killing a pile of ""innocent"" people, all of them players in one of the other story lines.  By the end of the movie you realize that they have all intertwined in such a way that they are all one and the same story line.

But the movie really isn't all that bad.  There were only three times when I was tempted to play solitaire or something, perhaps anything, else.

But it was confusing...",1313107200,5,2087,4.327319587628866
8439693,3,B004SGWYVU,"The movie runs about 6 subplots making things a bit confusing. I felt like I was watching pieces of a half dozen different movies. The film starts out with an electronic bank robbery attempt, some welfare slackers, an assassin killing a man, undercover cops, the computer hacker helping a criminal, and a rich man being told his wife is having an affair..I think that is most of it.

The subplots start to come together, some through a case of mistaken identity and errors. The plot was enjoyable as was most of the actors. The manner in which it was directed and weak sound track kept it from becoming a classic. For those who like a quirky movie from time to time, try it out.

F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1309392000,,705,4.457364341085271
8439694,4,B004SGWYVU,"""We got the weapons, we got the style, we got the motivation, what could possibly go wrong?""  When a guy comes up with a plan to steal money from a bank, (kinda like what they did in Superman 3) he thinks he is gonna be rich by the next morning.  After losing $100,000 is a card game he is sure he will have the money.  Soon after this, things start going bad, quickly.  It seems to me that after ""Snatch"" and ""Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels"" everyone has been trying to make the next one.  In 10 years this is the only one that has come close.  Like ""Lock, Stock"" this one has a few groups that have thier own story line going on and somehow all converge.  This movie is equal parts action and comedy.  It was a very fun movie to watch and if you enjoy the ""Snatch"" type movies, you will love this one. Made before Sam Worthington became a star, (he is the only recognizable person in the movie) but it holds up five years after it was made. The acting and effects are a little lacking, but that does not in any way detract from the experience.  This movie is proof that you don't need big name actors and a million dollar budget in order to make a great movie. Very enjoyable to watch.  I really liked it. I give it a A-.

Would I watch again? - I absolutely would.

*Also try - Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels & Perrier's Bounty",1307404800,4,1336,4.115830115830116
