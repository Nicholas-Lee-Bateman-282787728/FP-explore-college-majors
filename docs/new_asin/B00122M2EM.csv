8243601,4,B00122M2EM,"Because of the excellent price for both the Eighth and the Ninth, I took a chance on the format.  The earlier reviewer was correct that it won't play on an American CD player, but it works just fine in a Blu-ray machine.  Karajan isn't my favorite for subtle music, but I expected stirring, dramatic performances of these works from him, and wasn't disappointed.",1350777600,,362,4.73015873015873

Firstly, this disc is sensational value. Sony initially took each symphony to the market as separate issues; here they are combined and remastered. They were both recorded in the mid-1980s when the relationship with Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic was still highly volatile after the dispute over Sabine Meyer. In both instances, one can sense Karajan's relief that he is standing in front of a different orchestra. Moreover the Vienna Philharmonic, which was a miracle of sonority in the '80s, coaxed a warmer response from the conductor. With their almost excessive torque, their Berlin counterparts could tempt Karajan into a power-play in Dvorak, enjoyable though it still is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dvork-Symphonies-Nos-8-9-New-World/dp/B0009NDKX2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dvork: Symphonies Nos. 8 & 9 ""New World""</a>. Here, the Dvorak is more poised and softer. While Karajan does not observe the key repeat in the first movement of the Ninth - he never did - the autumnal tinctures of both works are firmly in evidence and masterfully so. No self-indulgence mars the Scherzo of the Eighth or the slow movement of the Ninth (both of which can be sucker punches to conductors). Throughout, the ambience of the Golden Hall suffuses both works - the participants are already operating in the miraculous dynamic that would yield the famous 1987 New Year's Day Concert&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/New-Year-s-Concert-From-Vienna-1987/dp/B000LC4B5C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">New Year's Concert From Vienna 1987</a>&nbsp;and the Bruckner Eighth&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bruckner-Symphony-No-8/dp/B000001GAX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bruckner: Symphony No 8</a>.

In short, this is fine acquisition. Long ago, Decca adorned their Kertesz LPs with Brueghel and rightly so as Dvorak is the great affirmer of Life - and never more so than in performances of this mettle. One cannot imagine this disc being surpassed in the years to come.",1316044800,4,2326,6.198142414860681
8243603,4,B00122M2EM,"I believe that we should not rate DVDs with ONE STAR only because of the NTSC or the PAL system / problem. It would be unfair for the performers and misleading for the new buyers.
That said, I cannot comment the NTSC v/s PAL system as I did not encounter the problem.
My only reservation about this DVD is that Karajan takes a relatively long time to have the 9th symphony's 1st movement off the ground. The rest is great. This version of the 8th symphony in particular is one of my favorites, although I was a little skeptical about Karajan's conducting when I got the DVD.
The sound and picture are to the standards too.
