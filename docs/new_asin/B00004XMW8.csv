1367402,5,B00004XMW8,"We watch the Wiggles every night. My baby must see it to sooth her to get ready for bed- Nothing else works! I have all the tapes and did not see this one since it's a Christmas tape! I thought I'd give it a try a few weeks ago, and I must say, we've been watching it every night since! It is my 11 month old favorite and I can see why. All the Characters are there, and tons of dancing children. Although the other tapes are excellent like Toot Toot! and Wiggle Time, only a few songs on those tapes show children. This video has children in most every song. And what catch fun Christmas songs they are too! I especially like Henry's Dance with it Cha Cha Cha beat! They even go to the beach and have a fun Christmas picnic there. This is a tape not to bypass if you are a Wiggles fan!",997228800,19,786,4.012738853503185
1367403,5,B00004XMW8,"We have three kids - ages 8, 6 and 3.  They love these guys!  I highly recommend this for your kids.  The songs are memorable, the language non-offensive, and the tapes are watched again and again.",978393600,5,197,4.416666666666667
1367404,5,B00004XMW8,"The Wiggles strikes again!!  Our family owns the previous 3 videos from The Wiggles, and like the other 3 videos, this adds to our 2 year olds list of favorites.  This video contains many of the traditional Christmas songs, which was a great way to intoduce them to her; Jingle Bells, Feliz Navidad, We Wish You a Merry Christmas, and she sings along and dances to ALL OF THEM!  Her favorite is the Nativity Play where the children are dressed up as they nod their heads to a simple tune.  She loves dressing up as Mother Mary and plays along with them!  You can't go wrong with this video...your family and toddler will love it. I find myself singing to the songs!",976492800,13,665,4.418032786885246
1367405,4,B00004XMW8,"Our 2 year old is a big Wiggles fan.  We own all 4 of the wiggles tapes - recently purchasing this one.  Wiggly, Wiggly Christmas, like the other Wiggles tapes, contains the upbeat songs and silly dances that have become the Wiggles trademark.  The songs are a mixture of Christmas classics and original songs.  Like all of the Wiggles tapes, this one ends with a live, on-stage performance where they sing many of the songs on the tape in a medley.
I only have a few criticisms of the tape.  It appears as thought this tape was put together rather hastily.  Most of the sets are nothing more than painted cardboard. Some of the songs are repeats from other Wiggles tapes, but the words have been changed to give them a Christmas theme.  My only other critique is that a few songs are just a little slow to hold a young toddler's attention.  (such as Silent Night,  Away in a Manger).  While these are Christmas classics, they depart of the traditional Wiggles theme of having fast, upbeat tempo songs.  Our daughter loves it when the Wiggles dance and act silly.  She loses interest when they are just a bunch of guys singing and nodding their heads in time to the music.
Do these criticism mean that you should avoid this tape.  Absolutely not!  This is a wonderful tape for toddlers.  It's fun.  It encourages kids to get up and dance rather than sit passively.  It's full of holiday spirit and will introduce your child to many classic Christmas songs.  This, like all of the Wiggles tapes, will become one of your child's favorites.
Another nice feature of this tape is that it comes in a sturdy plastic clamshell case.  Not the cheap cardboard cover that many Children's tapes come in.",976147200,4,1691,4.576666666666667
1367406,5,B00004XMW8,"I hadn't heard of the Wiggles until I saw them on the Today show on 11/27/00, but when they performed two songs on the show, my one year old stopped what he was doing and was entranced by the music!  Yes, one year old!  The Wiggles upbeat music and easy dance steps make this a must-have for children everywhere!  I knew immediately I must have their works for my kids.  They're not condescending to children as some other videos can be (there's no baby talk here), and it's fun for older kids and adults alike to watch together!  My one year old sits and watches this with his 8 year old sister and 10 year old brother, and it's hard to tear them away too!  I highly recommend this tape!",975715200,6,688,4.253846153846154
1367407,5,B00004XMW8,"The Wiggles: Wiggly, Wiggly Christmas is another winner from a great group.  My 2 1/2 year old granddaughter loved it. It contains a mixture of old favorites and new Christmas songs.  They include characters from the other videos, Dorothy the Dinosaur, Captain Feathersword, Wags the Dogs, and Henry the Octopus. Some children from snowy climates may wonder why they go on a picnic on the beach for Christmas, but it will be good for southern climate children.

This band of Australian men have successfully mixed  music with likable characters to educate and capture the imagination of our  children.  In this video they have captured the Christmas spirit and take  our children on a ride of music, season joy, dance and laughter.  It is an  interactive musical video and highly enjoyable for the young of heart as  well as the young of age.  Children and adults alike grow to love this  group.  It is upbeat, fun and educational.

1367428,4,B00004XMW8,"My 2 year old boy loves the wiggles because of their upbeat singing and dancing skits.  Many songs in this video are slower tempo due to the fact that they sing about Jesus and Christmas (which I like).  We pick this DVD when it's close to nap time b/c he'll usually cuddle with you on the couch and watch it, which is completely opposite his reaction with other Wiggle videos.  Great video on teaching about the real story behind Christmas!",1261180800,,441,4.4875
1367434,5,B00004XMW8,"The Amazon.com review accurately conveys the zest that The Wiggles and their elvish dancers bring to 19 musical numbers. The precise dancing by the pint-sized kids surrounding the band is particularly impressive. Our two young daughters try to sing and dance like the kids on screen. Six of the songs are traditional carols, and the rest are 'new' songs that all have catchy melodies. The Wiggles appear before seemingly flimsy cardboard sets, and the production is not slick; nevertheless, the colorful sets lend a simple charm to the effort, much like a school Christmas pageant. The pacing is good -- several slow songs (like 'Away in the Manger' and 'Silent Night') set up the impact of fast numbers that follow. The Bethlehem manger scene is depicted and one of the Wiggles discusses the holiday's meaning with children. While one or two other Wiggles videos might be this show's equal, none has surpassed the festive fun and moments of heartfelt warmth that 'Wiggly, Wiggly Christmas' offers.",1231977600,3,998,5.054545454545455
1367435,5,B00004XMW8,"My 4-year-old asked to watch this DVD repeatedly before Christmas, and she's still intrigued by it!  Children enacting a nativity scene is her favorite segment.  Mine is a young Latino with a beautiful falsetto voice singing ""Noche de Paz"" (""Silent Night"") as his papa and brother beam with pride.  The oddest number features ""Greg"" from the Brady Bunch -- how'd he get in there?  Another sweet, fun offering from Australia's greatest ambassadors.",1231718400,,447,5.166666666666667
1367436,5,B00004XMW8,"I purchased 3 Wiggles DVD's for my granddaughters for Christmas, glad I did. Wiggly Christmas, Wiggle Dancing and Hot Potato have kept my little ones happy and thoroughly entertained. For some reason Disney has changed its schedule and the Wiggles weren't on for a couple days now the show has been cut to 25 mins and it is on later in the morning. The girls loved to wake up to Wiggles at 7:00a.m. and get their day started. Now they can watch the original programs to start the day.

1367457,5,B00004XMW8,My 3-year old loves this video!  I bought this in November and we have been watching it ever since. I agree that the religious aspects of Christmas are nicely done with the nativity play.  There are traditional songs and some original Wiggles songs that are really good.  A must for Wiggles fans!,1166572800,,296,4.653846153846154
1367458,5,B00004XMW8,"This DVD absolutely is perfect for my 2 boys, who have had this playing since early November. I have a feeling we'll still be having a Wiggly Christmas way into January.

1367459,5,B00004XMW8,"I have seen all three Christmas releases, and my daughter (almost 2) and I like this one the best. I did not mind Santa's Rockin', but my daughter got up to play after a while. I didn't like Yule Be Wigglin at all(I still don't see how it is getting such high reviews). The reasons I like this show are the easy dance moves that kids can actually do, the actual Christmas music they sing, the non traditional songs they sing, and the fact that Captain has a fitting role. I like the Captain, but I don't like it when they overuse him to just act stupid. On the first viewing I could already tell which of the songs were going to stick in my head after a while. We have been through it three times, and the first one is stuck already (Unto Us This Holy Night). I can tell a couple more are on the way to sticking if my little one keeps choosing to watch this DVD (Go Santa Go, Let's Clap Hands for Santa Claus). Things slow down a bit for Away In A Manger and Silent Night, but I like to sing to her, so niether of us mind. I really wanted to get her a Wiggles Christmas show, and was afraid it would not happen until I saw this one. I think this was their first holiday show, and to me it was their best.",1163635200,,1204,4.0
1367460,5,B00004XMW8,We purchased this when it first came out. We would watch it in the car while running christmas errands.

1367461,5,B00004XMW8,"This is a well done DVD.  It includes all sorts of songs and surprisingly some of them are obviously religious.  For example, a nativity scene showing Mary with baby Jesus.  If you want a secular Christmas DVD, this is not for you.

My only problem is that my son is not particularly a Wiggles fan--he prefers Dora the Explorer and Spiderman.  But if your child loves the Wiggles, then this DVD is great!",1162684800,2,404,4.47945205479452
1367462,5,B00004XMW8,"Our daughter (13 months) loves this DVD to the point of obsession. Don't think about this as education - this is pure escape fantasy.

You won't be disappointed.",1136160000,,325,4.344262295081967

Lots of good Christmas songs, and they switch it up with slow stuff and fast party jams.  They even get down on the beach with the infamous Captain FeatherSword.  Lots of performances with kids taking center stage.  Doesn't run too long either.  Good choice for the kids and for wiggles fans worldwide.",1135209600,,447,4.666666666666667

1367476,4,B00004XMW8,"We recently purchased this DVD to replace our rather worn VHS copy. You see, our son is such a Wiggles fan that he wants to watch this year-round, instead of just during the holidays. It's a great mix of both religious (apparently the Wiggles haven't forgotten the ""reason for the season"") and secular tunes, done with the usual Wiggly sense of fun and spirit. Traditional songs such as ""Here Comes Santa Claus,"" ""Jingle Bells,"" ""Away in a Manger,"" and ""Silent Night"" are perfectly mixed with both original songs and some fun ""re-imaginings"" of popular Wiggles tunes. For example, ""Go, Santa, Go"" is instantly reminiscent of  Captain Feathersword's theme song, but with a definite Christmas twist. Also included is ""Feliz Navidad,"" which has helped my son's budding interest in Spanish. As usual, the Wiggles include kids (some of them their own) as dancers, singers, and as players in a solemn and reverential Nativity scene. The sets are colorful, the music is often fun and playful, and the Wiggles seem (as always) to be having a blast. Highly recommended to fans of Australia's ""Fab Four,"" but also to those who want a fun and enjoyable Christmas DVD.

I hope this review was helpful.

This DVD brings loads of Christmas spirit into my home.",1071964800,4,340,4.467741935483871
1367479,4,B00004XMW8,"I bought this DVD at a discount store and read the label very carefully where it said copyright 2003.  Well, I get it home and out of the box and find this is a production from 1998.  I suppose in some legally hair-splitting way this US version was copyrighted this year, but still I was very upset with the misleading info on the label.
That said, my two preschool daughters love this video, and that is what is most important.  Especially my 23-month old!  They love to dance along and have learned the (approximate) words to almost all the songs.
I am mom to two preschoolers, so I know a lot more about the Wiggles than I would ever have wanted to.  This show from 5 years ago, like all the other Wiggles product from that period that I have seen, has the production values of a kindergarten Christmas pageant and ""choreography"" that reminds one more of an aerobics instructor than a dance teacher.  The more recent Wiggles productions have improved on these issues SOMEWHAT, with location filming and a quartet of professional dancers.  Seeing this amateurish older production now really reminds me of how much improvement they needed.
But, maybe I am being too much of a Grinch.  The things that the Wiggles are really great at are already present in abundance here.  The guys are just so darned earnest and energetic.  I just want to bake them cookies and pinch their cheeks for trying so hard to please my babies.  And the children in the cast look so relaxed, natural and happy to be there.  They are just the cure for the over-the-top kids on so many American kids shows like Barney.
In short:  Wiggles, you are welcome for shrimp on the barbie at our house anytime, mates.  Oh, and Merry Christmas!",1071100800,8,1709,4.578947368421052
1367480,5,B00004XMW8,"This is the better of the two Wiggles' Christmas videos, and with ""Hoop-Dee-Doo"" is among the Wiggle's best offerings.  (Our whole family has been Wiggles fans for a while). As with all the Wiggles productions, you have the good-natured Australian quartet, their amusing costumed side-kicks (Captain Feathersword in the forefront), very nicely choreographed dance numbers and plenty of good humor.  And by enacting Nativity plays, Wiggly Christmas isn't afraid to keep Christmas Christian.  But in the end, it's the music that makes the Wiggles' videos so charming, a clever and eclectic blend of pop, standards, new-wave--and this is surely no exception. ""Unto Us This Holy Night"" is simply beautiful. It's ironic the Wiggles are distributed by the same company that does Barney--they stand at opposite ends of the quality-nausea continuum.",1069459200,3,841,5.453846153846154

The first thing I noticed is the low production values. The camera operators seem to have difficulty keeping up with the action, and the sets and props look like a school play. All of that wouldn't matter if my daughter enjoyed it, but she lost interest in just a few minutes (something that doesn't happen with the other DVDs).
Because the actors look much younger, I'm guessing that this was shot long before the 1999 copyright credits would indicate. If the Wiggles had not become such a marketing bonanza, this one would probably still be sitting on some producer's shelf.",1069200000,4,789,4.563380281690141

There was also The Wiggles Concert where ""(A Wiggly Christmas Medley)"" took place at on stage, and ""(Wags is Bouncing Around The Christmas Tree)"", but most of all, I think ""(Unto Us, This Holy Night)"" is such a pretty song.

There are 19 great songs, the kids are all there, the costumes, while simple, are appropriate, the dancing is excellent, and even Santa is wiggling.
There are the usual funny little skits, like when Anthony is talking to the kids before a Nativity play, and Joseph says that his role is  to put his hand on Mary's shoulder. (Well, he's giving her support, isn't he?)
Between these two shows, we're going to do a lot of Christmas Wiggling - in fact we've already started.  Get them both, and have a Merry Wiggle Christmas!",1059091200,5,681,4.475806451612903

""Yule Be Wiggling"" is slicker and, I think, a bit better, but this one isn't bad.  Younger children would actually prefer it, if my daughter--a Wiggles afficionado if there ever was one--is any indication.",1050624000,,513,4.896551724137931
1367496,5,B00004XMW8,"This was the first wiggles tape I bought for my 16 mos old and he loved it.  He would sing and dance right along with the wiggles.  This was our first wiggle experience so it took a couple of viewings for me to not laugh at the video as my son watched since I had never seen 4 guys dancing around with a funny looking dinosaur, a giant dog, and strange looking guy in a pirate costume.  My son loved this video he watched it 4-5 times a day and never tired of it.  Instead the more he watched it the more he learned the dances and tried to sing along.  This is a great holiday video, get it for your little on next holiday season and it will be a hit.",1042934400,,651,3.9015151515151514
1367497,5,B00004XMW8,"Our two and a half year old loved Barney, Elmo and Snow White until the Wiggles came along.  Now it's like Barney never existed.  The Wiggles are a Godsend to parents - fun, not condesending to kids, and captivating.  Best of all, when the kids want to watch this one over and over, you don't go nuts.  They're kind of like the Beatles for three-year olds.  ...",1039564800,2,361,4.3283582089552235
1367498,5,B00004XMW8,"We bought both this video and ""Yule Be Wiggling"" this week so we had a Wiggly competition between the two. ""Wiggly Wiggly Christmas"" wins at our house hands down. The title song would make anyone want to get up off the sofa and dance--mom included--and Santa is hilarious making wiggily motions with the guys and kids and jumping around like a maniac. Another song with a catchy beat is Henry the Octopus's. The nativity scenes and ""quieter"" Christmas songs are sweet and not too long (my 2-year old definitely liked the jumpy songs best!). It is a relief to have *some* Christmas religious references in a fun children's video without having to tolerate a syrupy 40 minute sermon.
My seven year old also enjoyed this video the most out of the two (she said the computer animation for the Elf song on ""Yule Be Wiggling"" was a little creepy).  We have 9 of the Wiggles videos now, and ""Wiggly...Christmas"" is easily one of the top 3. We also saw their show in Indy in August and that was a real treat with reasonable ticket prices.",1039305600,20,1030,4.5675675675675675
1367499,5,B00004XMW8,"There is traditional Chrismtas songs on this video as well as some Wiggle originals which are energetic and fun!
Maybe I'm biased being from Australia but these guys are great.  My girls love them (1 and 2.5 years)and dance and sing along to their favourite songs.  Each song has simple dance moves so that your toddler can easily copy Jeff(Purple Wiggle), Murray (Red Wiggle), Greg (Yellow Wiggle) and Anthony (Blue Wiggle).  Captain Feathersword (the friendly Pirate), Dorothy the Dinosaur, Wags the Dog and Henry the Octopus all feature in this video as well.  There is always lots of Wiggle humour thrown in as well which my girls find hiliarious!
What I like about The Wiggles is that you can tell that each member is really having a good time - they enjoy what they do, entertaining children and their carers, and this shows through on their videos.",1014249600,,855,4.795918367346939
1367500,4,B00004XMW8,"We have an almost 3 year old and a 6 year old who love anything the Wiggles do.  This is a fun tape.  But if you're new to Wiggles, start off with Dance Party or Toot Toot first.",1011830400,6,178,3.6578947368421053
1367501,5,B00004XMW8,"This video is a delight for children of all ages.  Anthony, Greg, Jeff, & Murray and all the Wiggles Friends share the traditional Christmas songs and add new ones to be shared over and over.  This video is a keeper!",1011657600,,216,4.375
1367502,5,B00004XMW8,"This is a 'must have' for any Wiggles fan.  Along with more familiar holiday tunes such as Jingle Bells, Here Comes Santa Claus, and Feliz Navidad, the guys sing original tunes with their usual fun flair!  Among other songs, they frolic on the beach with Wags, Dorothy, etc. in We're Having a Picnic on the Beach (it's Christmas Day) and celebrate with Capt. Feathersword in It's a Christmas Party (on the Goodship Feathersword).  This video made my two-year-old an instant Wiggles junky.  Do I highly recommend it?  You bet!",1010880000,4,525,4.853932584269663
