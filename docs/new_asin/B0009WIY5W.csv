8068607,3,B0009WIY5W,its fine but im a true beginner and its a little too fast for me but if you already have some know how youll like it,1387497600,,116,3.5
8068608,1,B0009WIY5W,"Very upset with myself for buying this. I think the other two reviewers were smoking something.
This is bad on many levels, as a teaching aid, as art, maybe one could argue it works from a farcical humour perspective.
I also bought the Tomas Cruz conga method which is a very good teaching aid.
I write this in the hope that I might save someone the mistake of buying this like I did.",1257206400,4,384,4.273972602739726
8068609,4,B0009WIY5W,"This DVD has the feel of being shot by your next door neighbor.  At the same time, Jorge does a great job of explaining each of the different hand moves and demonstrating them.  You are able to pick up the essentials easily.",1231804800,3,224,4.309523809523809
8068610,5,B0009WIY5W,"The DVD goes over all the topics it covers at a moderate pace so it is not too fast for someone who may be a beginner. For an intermediate/advanced player like myself I still found some of the tips very valuable such as using ""la mano secreta"" explained a little better than a teacher of mine once taught me. I liked this DVD a lot. Of course if you are a beginner this DVD should be used in conjunction with a conga instructor. Using both will really be a good way to get started.",1174003200,17,481,4.127659574468085
