8319738,3,B001LT401Y,"This gets about three and a half stars. Taking place in the snowy mountains, a group at a cabin are stalked by aliens. Most may think the directing is poor or mediocre, and many might fast-forward or turn it off because it definitely drags in many portions with unnecessary filler that does nothing but slow the pace and bore the viewer. There's some topless nudity, which includes a topless and tame lesbian sequence. The snowy locations and cabin were a good place to film it, but they could've filmed the entire locations better and used it to their advantage. It has some really bloody scenes and does get messy in parts, but it takes too long to get to them. Another thing the hurts the flick a bit is that some of the characters act comedic at times; it isn't a horror comedy, but it would've been better with a more serious tone.  The creatures are sometimes CGI and at other times practical puppets, and I've personally seen worse CGI creations in other video flicks. Unless you watch lots of these cheap Mini DV camcorder horror flicks and have the patience for a slow starting movie, I wouldn't recommend it.

You get a photo reel and trailers for extras. The DVD quality is good.",1409011200,,1190,4.55607476635514
8319739,2,B001LT401Y,"The film opens with a man stranded at a cabin getting killed by something that doesn't like the taste of cat. After the credits a computer Generated (CG) plane filled with bad actors reading from a bad script is forced to land near said cabin.

Eventually they must combat alien rubber/CG critters who apparently can only die in a CG flame.  All the characters are fairly shallow and unlikeable.  I was hoping they would all die.

Next to the bad CG effects, the seasons  were amiss. They landed in winter with snow everywhere, yet there were outside scenes that appeared to be midsummer with high dark green grass and broad leaf trees with full foliage.  Another Ed Wood moment.

Currently available on a movie  8 pack.

8319740,5,B001LT401Y,"A very suspenseful, well-directed feature for being a low budget film.  The music was very professionally done and added to the suspense of the movie, as was the quick editing which kept the pace moving.  The only donwside to this film would be in the CGI work which is really hard to do in a low budget film and make it look like George Lucas.  But overall, the film is worth watching, and I have had friends squirming and screeming at some of the scenes.",1272931200,,456,4.341176470588235
8319741,1,B001LT401Y,"Let me first start by saying that I watch (and enjoy) a lot of bad horror films.  However, this has got to be the worst thing that I have ever seen.  I could have (and do) make better horror films with my camcorder.  What the hell were these people thinking????",1240099200,2,261,4.18
8319742,2,B001LT401Y,"The special effects stunk and were done on the cheap. There were too many irritating characters. The story was decent, which is why I could not give it one star. I am sick of the overt attempt in B-rated horror movies to inject at least one lesbian couple, as if it remotely has anything to do with the story. The lack of a special effects budget really hurt what could have been a decent 2.5 star horror movie.  The monsters were cartoonish. Not much to say about this film. I do, however, have something to say to this film. Goodbye. Don't waste your money",1236816000,5,558,4.365384615384615
8319743,1,B001LT401Y,"Hello,

Yes, I was taken in by the nice looking cover and caption.  I would rate this movie as one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  No redeeming qualities at all.

Thanks,",1235520000,6,177,4.117647058823529
