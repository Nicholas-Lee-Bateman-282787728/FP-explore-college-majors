8361783,3,B002BPPORQ,"The season overall was okay. It was not exceptional, but it wasn't bad either. It had some really great moments. It does not beat the very first season.",1354924800,,152,4.464285714285714
8361784,4,B002BPPORQ,"If anybody is reading this and saw the price on this dvd then you'll know that the only person that can afford this DVD is justin bieber,Im sorry but $153 dollars is way to much for any dvd on this planet I don't even know why they would put this on Amazon, its a good show but its not worth that much I mean dang with that kind of money I can get me a wii and bike who's ever selling this dvd must be thinking that we got big pay checks like the people that walk on the red carpet.",1304985600,5,482,3.782178217821782
8361785,5,B002BPPORQ,"This is a good buy for anyone wanting to finish off the original Digimon series. Season 4 was a fun, albeit odd, season where the children characters actually digivolved themselves,which was an interesting twist as far as Digimon goes. The story it quite interesting on its own, a classic light versus darkness idea mixed in the with the destruction of the world and its up to the children to save it. Some people have said its like Power Rangers Meets digimon, but I disagree, there may have some paraellels between the two, but Digimon isn't relaly anything like Power Rangers. Anywho, its a good buy, and a great season, I enjoyed.",1258848000,7,634,4.7207207207207205
8361786,2,B002BPPORQ,"When you buy them at first it's great, it includes all dub episodes without the TV edits so any scenes of guns and stuff are left unedited and the japanese words are left unchanged, BUT I bought this and when I watched it, it was awsome, then after just 2 months of having watched them I put the DVD's again and the DVD's are corrputed and no DVD player will show them, and they don't even have a scratch on them, it's like it changed format on it's own, not even my laptop will play them, and it happened to all but the first disc. I also bought season 3 but fortunately it hasn't gone through this, this is a bootleg and a very bad one too since the discs are only good for a month or so, then they get damaged so please be cautious when buying",1258416000,13,746,4.047297297297297
8361787,1,B002BPPORQ,"Unfortunately, this (and other Digimon releases from Alliance Entertainment) is a bootleg.  What you're buying here are DVDs burned by some guys that downloaded them off the Internet.  The license to Digimon is currently owned by Disney...which is why it airs on ABC Family (owned by Disney) often.  Disney does not license out their titles to be distributed on DVD by other companies.

Save your money and do not buy this.",1256515200,11,423,4.915492957746479
8361788,5,B002BPPORQ,"Frontier is the fourth series of Digimon. The biggest change in this season was that the digidestined were able to turn into Digimon using ancient spirit evolution. This is a great show if you a digimon fan you should get it and get it before the price goes up like the others. IF it is a good seller
