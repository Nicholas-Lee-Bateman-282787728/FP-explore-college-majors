I have used this series with both second graders and fifth graders studying U.S. History, and it is one of their very favorites.  I am amazed by how much historical detail they recall - they really LEARN so much from Pups of Liberty.  Anne Kennel and the adorable cast of dogs and cats bring the events surrounding the signing of the Declaration of Independence alive to students.
