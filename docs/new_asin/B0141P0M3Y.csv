8729314,5,B0141P0M3Y,"I am so excited that the Napoleon Hill Foundation has come out with this new Think and Learn Big series for children.  We can never start too young to teach our children to have a positive attitude.  Not only do I wish I had these for my kids when they were younger, I also wish I had it to improve my positive attitude at a younger age.  This is a must for everyone, kids or not!",1483747200,,380,3.973684210526316
8729315,5,B0141P0M3Y,"This is the only animated dvd for kids about the science of success I know of on the market, and it is great!  I liked it so much, I bought two more copies for my sister's kids.

Thanks",1480982400,,185,3.8421052631578947
8729316,3,B0141P0M3Y,"I've been anticipating the release of this DVD since the Napoleon Hill Foundation announced it was coming. I love the book Think and Grow Rich. However, like the other reviewer said the quality is poor and the length is very short for the price.

The audio mixing is off and the music is way louder than the voices so it makes it hard to follow the dialogue.

I give it 3 stars because my 3 year old does sit through it. But as she gets older there is no way she'll want to watch this over other children's videos out there.

I look forward to the improved series to come. I absolutely love the idea.

Also, the song at the end is kinda cool.",1443657600,,642,4.153225806451613
8729317,2,B0141P0M3Y,"I hope to see this series match the quality of the writing of the story line, editing, and animation with the life changing information. I beta tested this with the 8-12 year old range and there is a 0 percent chance they are going to choose this over their Disney favorite. It is also very short in length for the price... Especially considering the quality. I believe this is an amazing initial idea and I look forward to its growth.",1443139200,2,435,4.45
8729318,5,B0141P0M3Y,"If you have kids and want to teach them Napoleon Hill's Principles of Success from his book Think and Grow Rich, then Think and Learn Big's animated videos are THE best way to do that.

Because Think and Grow Rich was published in 1937, many of the people and stories are not familiar to today's children. Not only that, Think and Grow Rich is read by people from around the world, in many different languages, so stories of American business leaders from the early 20th century are often unfamiliar to kids.

If you want your kids to learn and use Hill's timeless success principles, have them watch this DVD.
