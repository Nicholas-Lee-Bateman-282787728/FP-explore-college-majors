2523666,3,B000EMTJQU,"This is a typical David Hamilton film, with a bit of nudity and trite story lines and dialogue --- certainly nothing special.",1421193600,8,125,4.7272727272727275
2523667,4,B000EMTJQU,"This is a film I first saw just a couple of years after it was released.  The storyline is fine and although the original french script is dubbed into english, and so the translation can be a little rough, it works sufficiently to not detract from the original storyline.  What is sublime about this film is the music.  Philippe Sarde, a prolific composer for film, has produced some ethereally beautiful music here.  The soundtrack provides three of the four stars in my view.  Some of the quiet slower scenes also work beautifully - when there is no speaking - just the sound of water, Sarde's music, and the scenery.  In contrast to others here, I think this is comparable to Bilitis and Laura - actually I like it better, but then I am heavily influenced by this gorgeous music.  Hamilton's films are meant to be visual art at their core, not dramatic masterpieces.  Watched as they are intended, they work quite well.",1414800000,,922,4.648148148148148
2523668,3,B000EMTJQU,This movie was good and has a great scenic view of the places that the movie took place in. This was a film made by David Hamilton a renowned photographer who's images can be of people or objects to sceneries. His models are usually young women and they are done in soft tone where there is a blurry sense but it invokes the image to life. His movies usually stars his models from his photography job. The movie was slow but it had the Hamilton flow in it. His past films like Bilitis and Tender Cousins are just done in the same way.,1405728000,8,534,4.194174757281553
2523669,5,B000EMTJQU,"I have been a fan of David Hamilton's work for a long time. I have seem his films, Tendres Cousines, Bilitis, A Summer in St, Tropez, & Laura. Now I have seen this gem of a film. As much as I enjoyed the others, this one was a really good film. The girls are not ""Shipwrecked"". It is more like a row boat they they take out an get caught in a storm. No food, no water and 10 Francs between them. It never really becomes an issue of survival as they work through that rather well. Almost didn't recognize Anja Shute of Tendres Cousines fame. She plays Dorothee. The girl who played Caroline, I believe was in a Summer In St. Tropez, but not sure, although I know I have seen her someplace. As the title says First Desires ( English translation ) this film explores that with the three girls. The film is very matter of fact without overdoing anything. In short, there is a good story, and the film stayed tight on the story without drifting into a lot of unnecessary fluff. Definitely worth a look if you are a fan of David Hamilton.",1384819200,13,1032,4.243654822335025
2523670,4,B000EMTJQU,"I am a David Hamilton fan, and he does not ONLY do young people.  As a former pro photog myself, he has a photographic skill I find marvelous, and it was very popular back in the '80s and '90s, and continues today.  The graininess is somewhat pass because of today's double-digit electronic capabilities, which I also like in their milieu.  Hamilton is closer to painters, where too much detail can be negative.  Nevertheless, he is a master photographer.  Pemiers Desirs is not Academy Award, rather it is a photographer showing his video side during a time when much video was barely quality, and lacked technological sophistication.  The plots are simple, the video grainy (like most of his photos), so, like paintings, his work is not for everyone.  But he captures an air of innocence well, and despite the dirty-minded few, I find his work to be appreciative, not leering.  So if you aren't comfortable with some of his work, the youthful nudes for example, then avoid it.  It's still so much better and more moral than skin mags, and a LOT more beautiful.  For those who appreciate beauty regardless.....",1375142400,21,1111,4.830687830687831
2523671,2,B000EMTJQU,"I watched this movie after ""Laura"" and ""Bilitis"".
It is the weakest of these David Hamilton movies.
I would give ""Laura"" 6 stars if I could.
""Bilitis"" might get 3. This one is lucky to get a 2.",1314748800,7,193,4.105263157894737
