27716,5,076785344X,"This movie disects the emotions that fans go through, although most fans do not get to fullfill their dreams with the objects of their desire. Swain's character goes from believing that she'll never succumb to the pitfalls of fandom, but falls hard for a rocker portrayed by Flanery. (Who wouldn't?) What unfolds is an endearing coming of age story with many joys and bumps in the road. This was a well acted movie with likeable characters and a plot that many can relate to. The only thing that could have made this film more enjoyable for me would have been to allow Flanery to sing the songs that Todd Sparrow supposedly does (as he sings his own song in ""Raging Angels"").",965692800,,675,4.586776859504132
27717,4,076785344X,"I have experienced and learned first-hand what Angela experiences in the film.  And that is the ""reality"" of the music business, its stars and how these ""stars"" treat those who love them.  Music, and the  person who creates it, can affect an individual so much so that the person  assumes a role they never envisioned for themself. And the  ""truth"" Angela finds about the need Todd Sparrow fulfills in her  - and the need she fulfills, briefly for Todd, is right on the mark. I  found the acting exceptional, especially Dominique Swain and Sean Patrick  Flanery in the lead roles. I LOVED the music!  Why isn't there a  Soundtrack? Does anyone know what bands and musicians performed, and how I  can get their work?",962323200,,715,4.685483870967742

27719,5,076785344X,"Girl is a coming of age, becoming a woman, grunge backfeel, and ""chick- flick"" type film, but it was a really great movie. I liked the plot, it was serious, dramatic, romantic, exciting, and confusing  all at the same time. I am a guy and I actually enjoyed this movie. In fact  I am purchasing my copy in the next few moments. The main thing I would  like to say about this movie is: High School life, grunge/punk, fate, and  love/lust, are factors that make a great movie.",961459200,,474,4.3522727272727275
27720,5,076785344X,"At first sight...the movie seems to be one of those thousands of uncountable teen-age flicks. However, here is a very positive ""but""... but you will have a chance to enjoy amazing naturalism  of Dominique Swain's acting... Her right attitude smoothes the wrinkles of  this mostly ordinary story... putting away the unnecessary  i-want-to-be-taken-seriously-as-an-actress coolness....and possessing  genuine hilarity... Her down-to-earth tender beauty is magnetizing... and  it's rare in actresses nowadays... as well as in people around us in  general.
P.S. People who have seen her in ""Lolita"" definitely  don't really need any reviews to read...",961459200,3,647,5.89247311827957
27721,5,076785344X,"I ENJOYED THIS MOVIE FIRST HAND, SINCE I WAS IN IT AS WELL.  I PLAYED A  CONCERT-GOER IN LINE (WAITING TO GET IN), AND I MUST SAY THE STORY AS A  WHOLE REALLY KEPT MY INTEREST.  I SAW THE FINAL CUT OF THE MOVIE AND REALLY  FOUND THE STORY ENGAGING, KEEPING MY INTEREST THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH.  THE  MAIN CHARACTER (SEAN PATRICK FLANERY) WAS TERRIFIC.  IF YOUVE SEEN HIM IN  POWDER, YOU'LL LOVE THIS JUST AS MUCH!  HIS PERFORMANCE IS OUTSTANDING, AND  WORTHY OF REPEAT VIEWINGS.  THE STORY IS OF COURSE GEARED MORE FOR THE  YOUNGER AUDIENCE, BUT I AS 30 YEAR OLD ENJOYED IT JUST AS MUCH.  I ALSO  ENJOYED THE PERFORMANCE OF ONE OF THE CHARACTERS (YOU'LL REMEMBER HIM AS  ""BIFF"" FROM THE BACK TO THE FUTURE SERIES).  ALTHOUGH I THOUGHT  HIS ACTING SKILLS WERE PERFECT AND HE DESERVED A MUCH LARGER ROLE THAN THE  MEASLY ROLE BESTOWED UPON HIM.  OVERALL, I WOULD RATE THIS MOVIE A PERFECT  5 OUT OF 5 STARS, BLENDING AN INTERESTING BATCH OF CHARACTERS, AND A WELL  THOUGHT OUT STORY LINE!! SO PULL OUT THE POPCORN AND CHECK IT OUT!! YOU  WONT REGRET IT!!",961372800,,1050,4.382198952879581
27722,4,076785344X,"I absolutely loved this movie! I foresee it to be a cult classic. Dominique Swaine is great in it, as is Sean Patrick Flannery. ""Todd Sparrow's"" voice is fantastic, which definitely helps. Tara Reid is in  it, and she is absolutely fantastic.

The story line was very original, focusing around a senior in high school named Angela who is trying to get in bed with a famous rock star, but when she succeds, she finds that he is not  everything that she hopes.  The music in this movie is great also,  especially that of the band Thriftstore Apocalypse.  The acting was great,  with Tara Reid, Sean Patrick Flanery, Dominique Swain, and Summer Phoenix  among others.  There is not enough I can say about this movie!

27724,5,076785344X,"When I first saw this movie, I almost cried, just because it's what every girl either wants, or has been lucky enough to go through.  The story is of a high school senior named Andrea, who wants to loose her virginity before  college, but she gets a lot more than she bargained for, in a good way.  Her stuggles and different loves are only part of this movie.  I worshipped  the friendships and courage she has, and I'm sure many of you will too. It  will interest anyone who loves chick flicks, because this is the queen of  all.  Plus, the soundtrack kicks ""butt"".  YOU MUST SEE THIS  MOVIE!",961027200,6,594,4.36697247706422

27747,3,076785344X,"Why is this movie listed in the romance category? ""Girl"" is mostly about un-requited love and career aspirations. I felt no love in this move only sexual rejection and polygamous characters. The main characters Andrea Marr and Todd Sparrow from the get-go these two clowns were romantically incompatible thus resulting in un-requited love. A conservative girl tries to date a rocker guy Sparrow--yeah right. The sex scenes were lame. Throwing in cheap sex. Not that slow-boring tender love scenes would have been any better. The unconventional characters were so flawed not that I could relate to the conservative characters any better. Both groups have moral problems to the extreme. Marrs kept lying to fit in.",1485129600,,712,5.2

27766,5,076785344X,"Underrated 90's Classic and one of my favorite teen films.  It's clear there's a lot of hate out there for this film, but I'd counter that it's a niche film for a more specific demographic.  It's a teen fantasy about exploring counter-culture, and it's not going to appeal to everyone.

Recommended for fans of independent music scenes, early 90's grunge, record stores, DIY culture and all that crap.  If you're more Empire Records than She's All That,  you're the target audience for Girl.

Great cast, led by Dominique Swain in a role she was pretty much born to play, featuring Selma Blair, Summer Pheonix, Portia Del Rossi, Clea Duvall, and Tara Reid in a surprisingly on-point performance as Cybil, a too cool for school punk rock lesbian.",1484611200,2,745,4.826771653543307

The story was pretty predictable, but it didn't matter.  I just enjoyed being with these people and sharing their feelings and experiences.  Dominique was very lovable and you wanted her to succeed.  Most movies I have watched have had boring periods when you just wanted to fast forward -- but the plot of  ""Girl"" moved right along.  I always enjoy movies like this one, where the characters are changing and developing.  For me, the treatment of how girls become ""women"" was actually insightful.

Looking back, it hasn't really held up, but for teenage me it will always hold a special place in my heart.

Todd Sparrow was the guy every girl dreamed of being with - he was aloof, handsome, and unpredictable. And Andrea somehow made him dependent on her - also every girl's dream! *swoon*

The music is still great. The memories are greater. Here we are 15 years later and I still quote Todd's line from right before he and Andrea hook up for the first time:

""If it was in your soul to do it then fate would just take you there, and everything else was just a test to see if you were the real thing.""

I was a bit of a drama queen when I was a teenager. I was a virgin. I was a goody two-shoes. I lived vicariously through Andrea and later in life was actually able to apply some of her learned wisdom to my every day adventures.

27865,2,076785344X,"I first saw this movie around 2000, not long after it came out and since I never saw it again,I held this idea of it in my mind all this time as being a great movie. I saw it again last week and was shocked at how much my perception of it had changed. The main character Andrea was terrifically smart academically but  dumb as a post in her thinking process and the choices she made. The whole movie is about her chasing after this guy who happens to be a local rock star. In the process of this chase she does a lot of stupid things like lose her virginity to  a guy she doesn't even really like so she will have some experience  when ""Todd"" ,the rock star finally gives her more than a passing glance. Other idiot moves including going over a 100 miles to a concert to see him,only not to be able to get in and spends all night in a raining alley. Then she basically dumps her friend Darcy because she didn't fit into the whole new indie rock scene she has inserted herself into to try to get closer to ""Todd Sparrow,the rock star."" Finally, she gets her wish, and Todd notices her. He takes her back to his place, bangs her, then leaves for another city to record an album and she hardly hears from him for weeks, which of course means she has to chase after him some more. Then, finally she gets the golden prize. She becomes Todd's girlfriend and then goes on to degrade herself by doing things like having sex with him on the floor behind a speaker while his bandmate looks on impatiently and having sex with him in a barn at a concert where people are milling about.
Finally, she figures out that Todd is basically a shallow, self absorbed jerk and leaves him to go off to college feeling like""a real woman."" Maybe it's because I'm a lot older now than when I saw this the first time but I could only feel annoyed throughout the film. I guess I no longer have much tolerance for behavior like Andrea's.",1407628800,2,1909,4.239010989010989

27869,5,076785344X,I just finished watching this movie and I loved it. The characters are very real and the plot moves along well. Outstanding performances by Dominique Swain and Sean Patrick Flanery make this movie worth the price of admission. If you want to remember your first crush this is the movie to watch. This is a great movie to watch on a GIRLS night in.,1311033600,,347,4.4375
27870,5,076785344X,"I came across this movie by pure happenstance. There was a trailer at the beginning of another movie I bought and was intrigued by the preview I saw. I bought a VHS copy a few months later and I was shocked at how much I loved it instantly. Andrea's uncensored stream of consciousness starkly contrasting what comes out of her mouth hits a spot of truth for me. (I.E. When Andrea first meets Todd and he asks if she wants to go to a party her inner monologue says ""I would be unavailable now, Shrouded in mystery. He'd always wonder what happened to that girl who had to go to the bathroom."" but out loud she says ""Yes I do."")

I've found myself living as Andrea Marr. I've become involved with musicians in my local music scene and been unable to see past that to the bigger picture. I love that she's a smart girl but can't seem to get it together in the boy department. I love Rebecca Farnhurst and Cybil and especially Todd. Sean Patrick Flannery is amazing as Todd. The typical brooding artist who doesn't realize his muse until he loses her.

If you loved the book and can't imagine Andrea in any other way I wouldn't recommend this movie. Dominique Swain portrays her very differently than the Andrea in the book. All of the characters have the same names but not much else. The movie is much funnier than the book. I was a little disappointed when I first read the book (having seen the movie first) but I've come to love it in it's own right. I look at the movie and the book as two separate entities because that's what they are. Turning a book into a movie is always tricky and things need to be edited and changed to fit the format of a movie and I understand that not everyone loves the end result.",1265241600,,1711,4.3105590062111805

But I know the time period has a bad reputation.  If you loathe Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Candlebox, My So-Called Life, and dyed hair, this movie probably isn't for you.
All that said, I'm making my assessment of the movie without having read the book, so if you want a book/movie comparison you'll have to look at other reviews.",1133740800,7,785,4.546099290780142
27886,2,076785344X,"I have probably spent more time on ""Girl"" than it warrants, just consider this a public service to prospective viewers who are unable to make head or tail out of the wide range of comments already posted. As to the quality of its adaptation from the novel, I won't go there because there is no purpose in ""apples to oranges"" comparisons and many others have relentlessly addressed the adaptation issue.

Bottom line the movie version of ""Girl"" is a mess-which can be guessed without even viewing. Made-for-cable movies back in 1998 were generally lousy and not the mix of quality that they are in 2005. Neither director Jonathan Kahn nor writer David Tolchinsky had done a feature before ""Girl"" and neither has done anything since 1998. Just do the math.

""Girl"" is pretty much what you would have if ""Almost Famous"" had been a long episode of ""My So-Called Life"". Dominique Swain plays the main character (Andrea Marr), basically the Penny Lane character in ""Almost Famous"". Swain's usual acting style is to brazen her way through roles, subtlety and nuance are not words that have ever been used to describe her performances. But in ""Girl"" she comes closest to a carefully crafted performance and actually shows some restraint. Perhaps this is because of her voice-over narration, which serves as a counterpoint to her actions on the screen. She has a nice voice when reined in and she was still very cute in 1998.

The most obvious problem when adapting a novel is that the screenplay can include only a fraction of the material. The more characters included in the adaptation, the more shallow the character development. This is one of ""Girl's"" most obvious flaws as there is little reason to connect or care about any of the supporting characters, their quirks exist but we receive no background information so we can never understand why. There is Rebecca (Summer Phoenix) - a big-time grunge music fan who rambles on constantly about music trivia and sex. Rebecca gets the movie's best lines. There is Darcy (Selma Blair) - a walking eating disorder who is supposed to be Andrea's best friend although all they choose to showcase is her resentment of Andrea. There is Cybil (Tara Reid) - A nihilist grunge rocker with a bad home life and a lust for Andrea. Despite Tara Reid being shockingly good in this role (by far her best performance ever) the part is so poorly written and false that it should have omitted from the screenplay. There are Kevin (Channon Roe) & Richard (Christopher Masterson) - class geeks who appear in the school cafeteria as part of Cybil's band and seem to have otherwise been omitted from the screenplay. Finally there is Todd (Sean Patrick Flannery) who is Andrea's main love interest and seems embarrassed about even being associated with this movie-he and Swain have no chemistry and seem genuinely uncomfortable together.

Girl's fatal flaw is that it can't decide if it is a comedy, a drama, or a coming-of-age story. Since the humor is confined to an occasional witty line it isn't much of a comedy, the only indication that it was meant to be a comedy is some over-the-top humor about an abusive jock being hit over the head with a board and knocked out. Once is not enough as this nonsense is repeated later in the film. Although not even remotely funny it must be there to let the viewer know that this is a comedy as there are never any consequences to those committing the criminal assault (insert ""Three Stooges"" here). The comedy aspect is finally abandoned and the last few minutes treat us to Lifetime triple feature of teen suicide, bulimia, and homosexuality. These are tacked on with insufficient explanation, apparently because the writer and director sensed that the comedy angle was weak and they needed to qualify it as a coming-of-age story.

This genre splitting ultimately undermines the Andrea character who despite Swain's best efforts comes across as a cobbled together mix of inconsistent and conflicting motivations and behaviors-making her impossible to identify with or care about. She is intelligent (headed for an Ivy League school), beautiful, self-assured, adventurous, and has a lot of friends. You have seen this character before in ""Say Anything"" but in ""Girl"" she overnight becomes one of the most hated heroines in teen comedy history. Meaning you have sympathy only for her various victims as she virtually rapes a guy to have her first sex, unfeelingly abandons her friends for cooler ones, explores her emerging femininity without regard to the consequences, and generally acts more eight than eighteen. Swain is physically perfect for the ""Say Anything"" type of heroine but this ultimately works against as her as her transformation into parental nightmare just doesn't ring true.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1126483200,11,4807,4.919852034525277
27887,2,076785344X,"I gave this 2 stars because I think Dominique Swan is right on - she was the most wonderful Lolita ever - and because as a gal who loves her rock n' rollers I thought this was going to be the greatest movie ever.  But, it failed to impress.  I was the Dominique Swan character, running after my favorite rock band because I was hopelessly in love with the lead singer and would stop at nothing for him.  I've had those nights standing out in the rain or arriving at a show that's canceled because I loved that band so much.  And my determination paid off!  *Patting myself on the back*

But the subplotting lead me to see this as a silly teen movie.  The lesbian aspect was tripe, but I realize that were I in her (Dominique's) position at her age I wouldn't understand something like that either.

The girl really does have a tremendous way of portraying a normal (or not) teenage girl. In Girl she plays Andrea Marr, a love struck teenager pining after the singer of local band the Colour Green. Throughout the film the viewer really sympathises with her, as I'm sure many girls have had a crush on the hot lead singer of a band of some description. Other realistic issues are dealt with on the sideline, such as bulimia, youth suicide and bisexuality. Although Swain's performance was highly commendable, that is not to say that her fellow cast members were anything but excellent also. Tara Reid as Cybill is a pleasant surprise, as we are not used to seeing her in such an alternative role, which she pulls off nicely. Although this movie is a little different from the original book, it should be watched with an open mind and not be compared to the book. Amongst all the deep themes that run through this film, are the quirky and sarcastic thoughts out loud  from Andrea, which are dryly humorous and entertaining.

First, the obvious: Tara Reid as Cybill? I don't know who in the film industry owed whom a favor, but it is a mystery how that happened.

Secondly, Dominique Swain just didn't act like the Andrea Marr of the book. It seemed like Dominique Swain didn't even read the book before she played Andrea. I also happen to think that she is a very poor/mediocre actress all around, but that's another topic.

The movie didn't have any similarities with the ""feeling"" of the book, even though the plot was (roughly) similar.

Portia DeRossi as Carla? Ummmm.... maybe?

Selma Blair as Darcy sort of worked.

Andrea Marr (Dominique Swain) is 18 and about to graduate from high school. Her best friend Cybil is an aspiring rock star who performs with a couple of mutual friends (Chris Masterton from Malcolm in the Middle and David Moscow from Newsies) and is well on her way to being discovered.
Andrea is only mildly interested in her friend's stardom, because she is totally obsessed with local hot guy rock star, Todd Sparrow (Sean Patrick Flannery). She goes to all of his concerts and eventually they do hook up.
Because Andrea is so into Todd, she doesn't realize that when Cybil sings a love song she's singing it about Andrea. Cybil is in love with Andrea but this fact is slowly revealed through the film and oblivious Andrea has to be hit in the head with a brick to even notice. Even her other friend's  (Selma Blair, painfully anorexic looking and well cast) bulimia is pushed aside for the great Todd Sparrow.
Andrea navigates the whole underground rock scene, exuding pure joy because this guy Todd notices her...and sleeps with her. After they have sex in a horse stall in a dirty barn after a concert, Andrea's voice over tells us she ""feels like a princess."" This film has got a great handle on the neediness of young girls and how much value they put on a guy's opinion. It explores how a girl can easily let a guy overshadow her, and how she puts him on a pedestal whether he deserves to be there or not. Like it or not, girls act like this. The film is honest and raw in its portrayal.
Andrea does wake up from her fantasy of being ""Todd's girl."" She finds her own identity and recognizes the fact that her worth is not measured by how she's judged by men, but by how she sees herself.
My favorite characters here are Cybil and Rebecca (Summer Phoenix). Cybil is just too cute with all her crazy hairstyles and that dry comeback to everyone's compliments (""It doesn't matter.""). Rebecca is Andrea's sort- of guide through the ""underworld"" of guys, music and pop culture.
""Girl"" isn't exactly like the book, but for what it is it's better than 99% of the teen tripe that's being produced these days which make teens look like [jerks]. This film shows how hard choices can be, how overwhelming love is, and how much teens really just want to be accepted and allowed to simply live without constant peer pressure and judgement. And in the end, it shows that they do learn from their mistakes and can be redeemed as they grow into adulthood.

The boy in the crowd, who could be nice, witty, and wonderful, but would only turn into a bore to a youthful girl.  But most of all, the emotionally developing girl who hasn't yet discovered her own special beauty.
If the story stopped there, it would have been enough for me.  But the intimacy of female friendships, the perils of high school, and the big virginity factor were all explored with such amazing accuracy to real life.  Even the parent parts were great.

Andrea, was the same way, but by seeing the beauty in Todd, she completely changed. I was dissappointed by the ending, though, the first time I saw the movie. I expected Todd to tell Andrea that he loved her, and that she would put off Brown for a year, go on tour with him and the two would live happily ever after.

You can order the DAM CD's which play like normal CD's as well as on mp3. 2 songs from the movie 'One Step Forward' and 'Girl' appear on ""the color green -- Jon Kahn"" [23587] and the song Cybil sings 'Never' plus 'Blood Brothers' and 'Look my way' are on the ""the color green -- Acoustic"" [71629].

The narration was magnificent. I liked the way you could hear Andrea's thoughts. The plot was a bit thin, but the movie managed to survive quite well. The whole groupie aspect was interesting and refreshing. The actors portraying the characters did an excellant job. This is the kind of movie where one can just roll with it.

27951,5,076785344X,"First of all, I was definitely a groupie in the early 90's so watching this film brought so much of that back for me. I found this to be a realistic depiction of someone like myself who gets drawn into that whole scene and becomes obsessed over band members.  It doesn't matter what state you live in or what kind of band, groupies always remain the same.  Its this feeling that is so wonderfully captured.  Its a coming of age story for teenage girls.  I especially liked the fact that she finally realized at the end what it meant to be a true woman, she saw the error of her ways but at the same time, she didn't make apologies for the mistakes she made.
The whole feel of this movie is fantastic as well as the music.  I enjoyed spending time with all these different characters that could have been quite a few people I knew at one time.  Its one of the best teen films I've seen in a while.  I also thought Dominique Swain is someone to definitely watch out for.  She's a great actress who put a lot of heart into this role.  Her groupie character is very realistic and believable.
This is a movie that I think anyone can enjoy.  If you are a groupie or have been one at a certain time in your life, you will recognize the thoughts and feelings of the main character.",980121600,12,1273,4.223140495867769
27952,4,076785344X,"Well, i just got done watching this movie, and i'll tell ya, it was great. It tells about a girl coming of age, and falling in love. Although this IS a love story, it's not completely based on that.  I recommend this movie and i give it a 4 1/2.",978393600,,245,3.9
27953,5,076785344X,"There are two things of note about the movie ""Girl"".
The first is the story itself. This is a brilliant character study. We are given a wonderful glimpse into the life of Andrea, a young woman coming to grips with her womanhood, her adulthood and her sexuality. She learns, as the film teaches the audience, that while linked the three are distinctly different. Andrea learns to differentiate between the states of her heart, her body and her mind. She learns that she can't allow herself to be ruled by the her emotions, her sexual desires or her pragmatism alone but instead must live her life by holding all three in a delicate balance.
Secondly, this film also marks the maturity of Dominique Swain as an actress. Although Swain was never a child actress in the classic sense of the word, her initial starring role was the remake of the film Lolita. While Lolita was also a mature role, her approach to playing the character was actually somewhat juvenile, as the role demanded in many senses. Here, Swain has shown that she possesses the skills and potential to remain a serious actress for years to come.
The story alone makes this film a 4 star picture. Swain's stellar performance demands that I bump my rating up to a 5.",975369600,3,1229,4.6422018348623855
27954,2,076785344X,"While the movie Girl has good intentions, it doesn't come close to capturing the spirit of the novel by Blake Nelson.  The book, which reads like a diary, spans several years in Andrea Marr's life.  Unfortunately, the movie packs the story into less than a year's time, scraps a good portion of the novel, and leaves many characters, if not all the characters, poorly developed.  The story and characters will remind you of My So-Called Life.  Andrea and Todd Sparrow, played by Sean Patrick Flannery, are a lot like Angela and Jordan.  The movie, however, doesn't match the quality of the show.
Dominique Swain is good as Andrea, and the supporting cast, which includes Selma Blair and Tara Reid, is decent, but this movie fails due to bad character development and a choppy story line.  Of course, I have read the book so I have trouble reviewing the movie based on it's own merit.  If you like this movie, you should definitely read the book, also titled Girl.",973987200,,963,4.696428571428571
27955,5,076785344X,"This movie has to be one of the most moving movies I have ever seen. It so  accurately describes the wants and needs of the teenage angst in us all.

27956,5,076785344X,"Speaking from a teenage girl's perspective, I have to say that this is one  of the most realistic and poignant films aimed at my generation I have ever  seen. Most teen flicks are almost insulting but ""girl"" really  moved me and me feel like I might have something to offer. Dominique Swain,  Tara Reid, Summer Phoenix and the entire cast do an incredible job  portraying troubled, insecure, and likeable teenagers. Not to mention the  extremely hot Sean Patrick Flanery. Not only was the movie great, but the  music was awesome too. I don't think there was a soundtrack but I did find  a band called ""the color green"" (same as the movie) on mp3.  I  guess the director of girl also wrote the music. SOme of Todd Sparrow's  songs are there for those who enjoyed the music as much I did. Together,  the acting, the story, and the music make this a must see for all young  people.",968803200,,878,4.481012658227848
27957,5,076785344X,This movie is a wonderful story with the most realistic dialogue I have ever seen in a teenage based movie.  Swain is an incredible acrtess and is  so exciting to watch.

27958,3,076785344X,"Dominique Swain is the primary reason to seek out this relatively little-seen film.  Her first movie role, ""Lolita,"" is really  something to see.  She is very natural and charismatic.  Unfortunately,  ""Girl"" isn't up to that standard in any way.  She does what she  can, but the movie is another cliche-ridden teen film.  The supporting cast  makes a great effort, particularly Selma Blair (she must be seen in  ""Cruel Intentions,"" a wonderful comedic performance).  However,  by the end of this film, I found myself wondering why the main character  Andrea was worthy of my attention for 99 minutes.  She doesn't seem to  change or grow significantly, although clearly that was the intention  (i.e., she becomes a woman, not merely a girl, because she stops chasing  after an immature rock singer).
Despite the somewhat poorly told story,  this is a cut above much of the recent teen-flick product.  Besides the  good performances, I give this film some credit for at least attempting to  treat its subject with a degree of seriousness.  As for the DVD, although  not specified here on the amazon.com listing, there is a short 'making-of'  featurette and a commentary track with the director and Dominique Swain.  Fans of Swain take note: she speaks very infrequently during the film.  Still, these features are nice to have and do add to the value of the disc.",967766400,9,1362,4.942222222222222

7789186,1,076785344X,"Is this movie called Girl because it was written by an 11-year old home-schooled girl who watched too many reruns of My So Called Life? I don't know why people like Dominique Swain- she's a horrible actress who looks like she has special needs when she dances. She only ever got acting gigs because she was one of the few underage girl actors whose parents let her play Lolita. The plot is horrible, the lead character looks and acts 14, not 18, and her love interest looks 35 years old; It's actually a lot like watching Lolita again, so maybe that's the appeal? The fashion is also about 4 years out of date when it was filmed- those 90s hair buns were cool in 1995 when Angela from My So Called Life wore them, but by 1999 grunge was over. And, yeah, let's not even talk about the fact that when her friend confessed she had been raped, she replied ""at least you're a woman now, right?""
