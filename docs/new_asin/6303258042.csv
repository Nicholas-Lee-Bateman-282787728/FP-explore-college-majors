excellent choice of songs, all sounding quite nice to the ear, Dons vocals backed up by a very rocking little band who themselves put out quite a good sound, too. Lighting is fine, as is the sound quality. An enthusiastic audience,in addition to Dons witty remarks here and there,

round things out to make for one very enjoyable concert evening on tape.

Filmed in Color, the tape length is 77 minutes. The songs: Everyday, Love in my Heart, Orphans of Wealth, Seaman, Castles in the Air, And I Love You so, Supermans Ghost, Prime Time, 1967, Headroom, Dreidle, Crying,

American Pie, Infinity, Stardust,(and my all time favorite) Vincent.",1169856000,,858,4.662251655629139
