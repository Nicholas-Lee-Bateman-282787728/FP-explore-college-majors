1085301,1,6305847045,"For one thing, none of Bacon's paintings are seen in the film. Apparently, the owners of the Bacon estate wouldn't grant permission. This would have been okay if there had been a story presented in the film, but there wasn't. About half the movie is made up of abstract, disconnected scenes of Bacon and his friends making negative comments about life and insulting eachother and others. The other half is made up of abstract, disconnected scenes of Bacon's lover popping pills, engaging in sado-masochism with Bacon, and clips of his nightmares. Bacon comes off as a ghoulish monster with no redeeming qualities and his lover, George as a helpless, empty shell of a human being. I bought this video based on the all around good reviews I found on the net and because the great Derek Jacobi and talented Daniel Craig are cast in the leading roles. Alas, I suspect the good reviews must have come from some special standard for reviewing film with homosexual content (gay is good!) and these fine actors talents were wasted on this dog of a movie.",1027814400,14,1046,4.752747252747253

1085303,4,6305847045,"I couldn't believe how much Derek Jacobi actually resembled Francis Bacon, in addition to emulating his high camp mannerisms. This impression of Bacon's relationship in the 1960s with petty criminal George Dyer has been widely panned in the UK but it must be remembered that John Maybury created the film with no cooperation from the Bacon estate, which is why none of Bacon's paintings even figure in the movie (quick quiz: which cult movie of the 60s opens with two canvasses by Bacon? see below for answer).
Still, the recreation of Bacon's milieu in 60s Soho is passable, dear, despite the filtering out of the more offensive conversational profanity which was a daily aspect of life and communication amongst the artists, proprietors, dilletantes, drunks and hangers on who formed Bacon's inner circle, or who hung out in the glorified front room of the Colony Room club or the Coach and Horses.
As Bacon would say: ""Champagne for my real friends, and real pain for my sham friends"".

1085304,5,6305847045,"John Maybury provides viewers with a creative portrayal of the English painter Francis Bacon.  Bacon was fascinated with violence both in his paintings and in his personal life.  This is evident from the very first  scene in which Bacon confronts George Dyer, the inept burglar who has  fallen into his studio.  Jacobi's chilling, yet mesmerizing, portrayal of  Bacon is seen as Maybury closes in on Jacobi's face as he deliciously  anticipates being bedded and dominated by this strange young man.  And  while the film's frank portrayal of lust and sexual dominance is clearly  evident it also explores the life of a man who consciously chose the dark  side of life.  The performances of both Jacobi and Daniel Craig, as Dyer,  are outstanding as is the inventive camera work of Maybury, who mimics the  surreal images of Bacon's paintings.  Jacobi's performance and voice-over  narration help to illuminate this disturbing and fascinating man.  Disturbing because he revelled in the violence and pain that most of us  abhor and fascinating because Bacon was so unabashedly honest in his  approach to life and his work.",963532800,48,1120,5.088397790055248

1085454,3,6305847045,"There are exquisite performances in this disjointed movie. Jacobi is uncanny in his performance which made me think of a heartless Judi Dench. My only problem was the direction of scenes where Bacon exhibits ecstasy in his exposure to violence. Jacobi came across as disingenuous and it took me out of the film for a second. Not that I was too deeply absorbed. Jacobi's Francis Bacon is none-the-less too real and a despicable person on the verge of being completely unsympathetic. Craig plays a beautiful tortured soul with chasmic depth in the eyes of a character unable to express that level of feeling. I couldn't take my eyes off of him. The story doesn't show the tie that bound them together. I thought Jacobi's Bacon would have kicked Craig's Dyer to the curb. I was unfamiliar with Bacon or his work so viewing this movie on its own merits left me on the fence. The film is interesting with some artistry at work. I later learned that some of the strange choices in scenes where the image is distorted were to mimic images in Bacon's paintings. I don't know that Bacon's work would be known by most film viewers, so the shots just seemed odd.
I found the approach gimmicky and off putting. Tear away the gimmicks and the art house aesthetics and this was a simple recounting of alleged happenings during the relationship of these two men that lacked a cohesive narrative.",1357689600,4,1380,4.683127572016461

1085459,5,6305847045,"Francis Bacon was a famous English Painter born in Ireland to English parents. He was born on October 28th, 1909 and died on April 28th, 1992.

Francis Bacon is the center piece of this movie which tells a section of his life from when he met George Dyer (played hauntingly and sexually by 007's Daniel Craig) till right after we learn the news of George's untimely death.

This movie is quite well filmed and very artsy giving us an inside view of Francis Bacon and the monsters that drove him and tormented him. This movie also shows how Francis influenced George by showing him off, baiting him to be aggressive towards Francis sexually and eventually giving George enough money to buy all the booze and drugs George wanted. George's guilt over being used, even if it was a sort of love, came out in horrible dreams that tormented George till he basically drank his life away.

My lover and I felt the movie was very engrossing although it was very hard to watch and know this happened. The great scene of the movie is seeing Daniel Craig naked in the bathtub showing everything one would want to see. We would recommend this movie as the study of a man as an artist but more of a tormented soul who brings someone under his wing only to help destroy him.

1085503,4,6305847045,"I've enjoyed Derek Jacobi's performances in other films but this was something new for me.  Francis Bacon was not a ""nice man"" but Jacobi pulls it off, balancing the tormented images in the paintings with the enjoyment of wine, sex, and song.

1085504,5,6305847045,"""LOVE IS THE DEVIL"" is a study in the life of gay English painter Francis Bacon. It chronicles his life with his lover and model George Dyer. This film is as close cinematically to a Beacon painting as one could get. Jarring, disjointed, jagged and thrillingly repulsive. It demands an intelligent, and equally hip audience willing to invest in a story of great depth, pain and love. It isn't easy but it is so well worth the time it takes to enthrall.
  Derek Jacoby is so engrossing as the raging queen of the art world of London in the 1960's. Bitter, biting and a bastard of epic proportions he manages a huge ego that is so layered in fortification that not many can see the wounded soft core to this man. For a while George, the big butch hunky crook who comes crashing into Francis' life, seems to penetrate to the heart of Bacon. But the psychology of this tortured artist defies love and denies what salvation might be found in the arms of the truly needy George. A great performance by one of the best actors around this is one of Jacoby's most brilliant portraits.
  Then there is Daniel Craig as George. He so embraces this role as to disappear into the man so thoroughly that I forgot I was watching Daniel Craig. His George is a case of great packaging that hides a rotting lost soul bound for self-destruction as a validation of being told all his life he is worthless.  This is yet another of Craig's moving, fearless performances that have made him the top star and great actor that he is today.

This film is challenging, demanding and draining, in other words a rewarding cinematic experience.",1266969600,13,1612,4.541379310344827
1085505,5,6305847045,"Returning to films remembered from the past is a fortunate aspect of owning DVDs.  LOVE IS THE DEVIL: STUDY FOR A PORTRAIT OF FRANCIS BACON is an art film that belongs in the collection of all those who admire the great British artist.  One of the aspects of this film that makes it so powerful is revealed in the latter part of the title: many of Bacon's paintings were names 'Studies for...' and what writer/director John Maybury has created here are the impulses or stimuli that probably are close to the visual and visceral seeds resulting in the canvases of Bacon.

Rather than a biography of Bacon, LOVE IS THE DEVIL is episodic, attempting to recreate some of the situations that focused the mind of the man who created such grossly distorted creatures that ranged from the Pope to athletes, to portraits of his friends, to highly charged images of his long term physical ally, George Dyer.  The camera pulls in and out of focus just the way Bacon's paintings do and instead of replicating Bacon's actual works, the film merely suggests the nidus that began the ideas: there are extended periods of Bacon, all dressed up for his smarmy nights on the dark side of town, turning from side to side, in and out of focus, not unlike his triptychs of Self Portraits.

Fully in charge of this 'study' of the genius is Derek Jacobi in a brilliant portrayal of the strange man who would become England's most honored painter. He has managed to discover myriad gestures and rituals like Bacon and whether he is in his infamous filthy studio or at The Colony bar he simply IS Francis Bacon.  Balancing the needs and fragility of Bacon's psyche is a stunning portrait of the lost and tortured George Dyer by Daniel Craig. The interaction between these two actors is magical.  And discovering the friends of Bacon who so often became models becomes a game of recollection as we are introduced to Muriel Belcher (Tilda Swinton), Henrietta Moraes (Anabel Brooks), Isabel Hawthorne (Anne Lambton), Daniel Farson (Adrian Scarborough) and John Deakin (Karl Johnson).

Many viewers would find this film difficult viewing as the life and style of the painter are less than immaculate.  But for those who love expressionistic figurative art and the joy of creative film making, this is a very fine work to add to the library.  Grady Harp, May 09",1243382400,4,2331,4.761786600496278

1085507,5,6305847045,"Last week I was going through my very old copies of Tatler, Harper's & Queen, and Vogue magazines (British issues) and found one with a review of this film.  My old issues go back 15 years some of them.  I read the review and saw the list of the actors names and said, ""I've got to get this.""  After looking at it today, I am so glad I came across the review, because I would never have seen it otherwise.

I am not a Francis Bacon fan.  His work, like Freud, leaves me uninspired. Jean Michel Basquiat, on the other hand, fires me up emotionally.  After seeing the film I do want to see his retrospective next summer here in NYC at The Met.  Perhaps then I WILL be inspired.

The film is just incredible.  The writing, the photography, the editing, the music, the acting, absolutely wonderful.  Faces who are now familiar to me would not have been when this film was made in the 90s.  Craig, Swinton.  Of course I knew and adored Derek Jacobi.  He WAS Bacon.  His looks, mannerisms, everything. The 'sex' scenes are tastefully done if that is the right word, and a lot is left to your imagination.  The British really are the best actors and actresses in the world. There is no denying that.

The story is sad, disturbing and true.  Like PRICK UP YOUR EARS, we get a fly-on-the-wall view of a forbidden London in the 60s.  The gay scene that we would not have stumbled across had we not known the bars and clubs were there.  The actors, all of them, were really excellent.  I am just so glad I happened upon the review and was smart enough to get this film.  It is money well spent.  Now I must read more about Mr. Bacon.",1224460800,4,1622,4.2838283828382835

1085510,4,6305847045,"John Maybury's study of the love affair between the great Irish painter Francis Bacon (Derek Jacobi) and George Dyer (Daniel Craig), the handsome their twenty years Bacon's younger, is more of the kind of film you can really admire than enjoy: it's a dark and very sour study of their sadistic-masochistic relationship between the years 1964, when Dyer tumbled through Bacon's skylight seeking to burgle his house, and 1971 when Dyer committed suicide in France from an overdose of pills. Maybury achieves some lovely effects by framing their relationships entirely with the seediest filthiest milieux imaginable and often using interesting distorting camera tricks (such as shooting characters through curved glass whiskey bottles or wineglasses, or using angled mirrors) to reproduce the famous ugly distorting effects of Bacon's paintings. Maybury was forbidden from using any of Bacon's actual work for the film, so if you didn't know what the finished works looked like you'd be very confused; still, it's hard to imagine anyone seeing this who doesn't have some familiarity with Bacon's work. Even so, some of the more cheaper shots (like those of Craig as Dyer threatening to jump off the ledge of a high New York City hotel) were so clearly done on the cheap they mar the overall effect of the film.

In their sexual encounters Bacon, a lifelong masochist, made Dyer the physically dominant and punishing figure (the film does not shy away from suggesting the more disturbing elements of their sexplay, which includes Dyer extinguishing cigarettes on Bacon's body at Bacon's request). But out of the bed the sour, cynical, and often intentionally cruel Bacon dominated the fastidious and unhappy Dyer, who despite his beauty felt he was a nothing, even when he was the famous model and partner of arguably the most famous living painter in the English-speaking world. Both actors really show their range with their roles, and Jacobi looks so much like the actual Francis Bacon, and adapts so beautifully to his poisonous nasty remarks that it's almost uncanny. It's fascinating to compare his performance with Craig's equally fine one: whereas Jacobi's long stage training shows in his more theatrical flourishes, Craig, who is predominantly a stage actor, goes for subtler effects, suggesting Dyer's misery, self-hatred, and complete lack of confidence. Maybury's fascination with the men's shared misery together prevents him from showing anything of Bacon's lingering years of agonizing guilt after Dyer's suicide that prompted him to create his masterwork, a triptych reproducing Craig's suicide. As a result, you feel only relief when Dyer dies and feel both men are better off without one another since Dyer seems only to be holding Bacon back and Bacon takes such relish in verbally tormenting his partner. So the whole film leaves you with the mistaken impression that Dyer didn't mean all that much to Bacon.",1197158400,9,2925,5.210191082802548
1085511,2,6305847045,"If you need the plot look at other reviews. Actually there is very little in the way of plot however that is not really a criticism there are lots of films just about mood or tension between characters that are fascinating and fulfilling. Francis Bacon was never my cup of tea as an artist I found his paintings one note and void of structure and composition but that should not and was not important when viewing this film. I agree with some of the reviews posted here that there are a lot of cliches depicting mental illness, the spiraling staircase et al but the need of the director not let the actors convey this was a big mistake.  The film is all about visuals and the lack of any actual depiction of Bacon's paintings doesn't really make a difference. He is portrayed as one of the most unsympathetic characters in film making Hannibal Lector look like a better candidate to hang out with. Okay I get it all homosexuals were totally miserable in the 60's before the word Gay was stuck on.  I doubt that was true and Francis Bacon may have been the miserable jerk this film makes him out to be but I doubt that. Having said all that I would rather watch this movie than a white wash job Hollywood bio like ""Ray"" or ""I walk the line"" any day.",1196208000,3,1248,4.351931330472103
1085512,5,6305847045,Both Derek Jacobi and Daniel Craig are doing a great job!

1085542,4,6305847045,"Let me start this review by saying that Daniel Craig demonstrated exceptional acting skills playing the role of misfit George Dyer, petty criminal lover of famous artist Francis Bacon. Derek Jacobi was also in top form playing the alcoholic bitter artist. Daniel Craig transports us into the life of the pitiful adrift Dyer, living on pills and booze, never really connecting to the larger world in which his lover was a master. Watching a man disintegrate is painful and Craig does an excellent job portraying that slow and nasty process of losing grip with sanity. Jacobi plays Bacon as a masochist but this is only the titalating aspect of his personality. In fact he is the classic artist, absorbing images and energy and experience from all those around him, digesting these experiences, and then filtering them into the creative process with a unique form of expression. In this regard, the beauty and physical grace of George Dyer becomes the inspiration for a major portion of Bacon's work. Portraits of Dyer dominate Bacon's Paris exhibit and later his Tate exhibit. But as Dyer disintegrates, his loss of sanity begins to get on Bacon's nerves. In fact, once Bacon reaches the point where Dyer is actually more trouble than inspiration he backs away from the relationship and acts as if he can't be bothered. When Dyer tries to jump off a Manhattan hotel roof, Bacon acts bored and disinterested. Thus we have a story where a petty thief, a born loser, a naturally beautiful man, becomes somewhat of a sacrifice to the canibalistic nature of the artistic genius. Bacon consumes Dyer and then spits him out into the gutter. Of course there is a scene where Bacon gives Dyer a check for  $25,000.  But this is real pocket change for an internationally acclaimed master like Bacon.

The acting alone carries this film forward. The script was probably the weakest aspect of the film. Yet overall it is a great film.",1189036800,7,1921,4.850609756097561
1085543,4,6305847045,"This black portrait of the artist Francis Bacon and his rough-trade boyfriend, George Dyer, amounts to nothing more than a bleak look at an excessively immature relationship.  The film never dips below the shallow surface of their tortured lives, its focus almost always shocking and never tender.

Not knowing much about the life or art of Francis Bacon, before viewing the film I read as much about him as I could, having been forewarned that many people find the film as difficult to understand as the twisted relationship between the two people it portrays.  From what I discovered of Bacon's life, the film is possibly quite accurate, at least as far as his relationship with Dyer is concerned.  The problem is that real life is often not very pretty, and if a film of such unseemly lives is to succeed, it would help to offer some deeper understanding of the characters it presents, or at least proffer some hint of the artistic output of a man who, if the critics and biographers are correct, was one of the most important artists of the 20th century.  Instead, Love is the Devil never reaches beyond a stark presentation of the cruel, selfish indifference of the lead character (Bacon) and the hopeless frustration of the tragic life of George Dyer.  Bacon as an important artist is never explored at all, which could have served to at least balance the harshness of his more unflattering reality.

For the life of me, I can't figure out why, if their film portrayals are to be believed, so many well-known artists seem to drench themselves in squalor and dysfunction.  In some respects, the story of Bacon and Dyer (as presented in this film) reminded me of the twisted love affair between Joe Orton and Kenneth Halliwell in the drama, Prick Up Your Ears, which starred Gary Oldman and Alfred Molina.  Orton was a hugely successful playwright and Bacon a highly successful artist, and according to their respective cinematic renderings, both lived tortured lives of romantic dysfunction, paired with partners who were far beneath their intellect and talent.  But aside from the further coincidence of both stories being set in England in the 1960's, there the similarity ends.  Orton and Halliwell were writers, one supremely talented and the other inept, but at least they were intellectually compatible, if not professional equals.  Bacon and Dyer had nothing in common beyond a self-destructive love of alcohol and a penchant for inflicting pain on each other and others around them, which appears to be the sole point of Love is the Devil.

From the very start, Dyer is clearly in over his head.  His love for Bacon is fed by his awe of a talent that his mind is unable to grasp, and the frustration of having nothing to offer beyond his physical beauty.  Bacon can provide only cruelty and bitchiness.  The relationship is doomed from the beginning, and Bacon is portrayed as an enigmatic combination of physical masochist and intellectual sadist, with nary a hint of his awesome artistic ability.  Although expertly etched by the acting of Derek Jacobi and Daniel Craig, and both actors do provide their share of brilliance, the film suffers from a limited depiction that emphasizes Bacon's cruelty and Dyer's despair.  If this is an accurate portrayal of their rather sordid love lives, it would have been better for Bacon's reputation and Dyer's memory to have simply left them alone.  No matter how much Bacon can be defended as a tortured genius, it is Dyer who emerges as the sole sympathetic figure in the piece, drowning his ineffectual stabs at romantic fulfillment in an ever-downward spiral of booze, drugs and rent boys.

Part of the message of this film seems to be, ""Avoid falling in love with genius"".  If a film is to provide such a hopelessly depressing narrative of immaturity, selfishness and alcoholism, it would behoove the film's creators to at least balance these images with some of its subject's accomplishments.  What emerges is not a very flattering picture of artistic genius or gay romance, and in the end, I decided if a film can only portray the seedy aspects of a great artist's private life, maybe it shouldn't present it at all.  I give it five stars for the well nuanced acting, and minus one for the story and direction.",1175990400,7,4270,4.851239669421488

1085545,4,6305847045,A captivating look a the tortured soul of an artist. Jacobi as usual was wonderful. Daniel Craig is poised to become one of the more important actors in cinema today. His range is astounding.,1168300800,6,191,4.647058823529412
1085546,4,6305847045,"One character in this film describes Francis Bacon's art as ""portraitures of pain,"" also an apt description of this movie about the artist and his relationship with a burglar George Dyer, played by Daniel Craig, who falls into Bacon's flat from a skylight in a bungled attempt at a robbery. Completely unfazed, Bacon (Derek Jacob) informs George that if he will take off his clothes and come to bed, that he can have anything in the apartment he desires.

I know precious little about the life of Bacon; but if this movie is accurate, he was not a particularly likeable man who treats Dyer, who comes to care a great deal for him--""I love you, Francis""-- very badly. At times George is his ""sorbet between courses."" At other times, he banishes him from his sight.

Both actors are excellent in their roles. Jacobi actually looks like Bacon; and Craig, soon to be the new James Bond, gives a fine performance as a ""tragedy waiting to happen.""

John Maybury, the director, obviously wants the viewer to be reminded of Bacon's paintings since there are many distorted and fragmented shots. Additionally, many of the artist's friends from the bar have very unsymetrical faces. Bacon makes himself up in front of three mirrors. There are several shots where the characters are so close to the camera so as to give a fish-eye effect. There is also a scene where victims of an auto accident are lying in positions similar to those of figures from Bacon's art. For the most part these ""portraits of pain"" work.

This film is certainly worth watching.",1130457600,29,1542,4.742537313432836
1085547,5,6305847045,"The life of British artist Francis Bacon was a fragmented story of abuse, disconnection and cynicism, he developed a callous disregard for human feeling seemingly because he was treated similarly as a boy, subjected as he was to the coldness of the British Public School system.
 This film chronicles the height of his career during which time he had an initially loving but latterly destructive love affair with a simple and striking east end lad, George Dyers.
 The centre of Bacon's world was his grubby, disorganised, slightly sordid, studio flat. A world into which George falls, quite literally, through the sky light while attempting to steal from the artist.
 The affair is at first one of passion and caring, George is shown off and spoiled. As it becomes evident that George is in need of simple and tangible feedback to prove he is loved so Francis seems able only to give cruel jibes and provocation based on the irritation of George's needs, thus the seeds of destruction are sown. Francis seeks solice in creating art, the only place he can make some kind of coherant sense of the fragments of his angry emotional world. George, who has almost daily nightmares, has no creative means of dealing with his complicated emotions and reactions to Francis. He can only blot out the pain in a haze of drugs and drink. On the rare occassions he can deal with his demons while lucid he does so by making dramatic and messy suicide attempts.
 The film pinacles as Francis is given the honour of being the first British artist since Turner to have a special exhibition in Paris, George takes his life the night before in their Parisian Hotel, dying in humiliating and tormenting circumstances, he was found dead on the toilet.
 The story is tragic, the camera work offers insights into Bacon's sense of distatse and disgust as motivating factors in his art, some scenes look incredibly like one of his tormented ""screaming"", portraits.
 Jacobi is superb is as Bacon and Craig is both engaigingly sweet and by equal measure, distastefully tormented as Dyer. Other highlights include the exact set replica of Bacon's dismal studio flat and Tilda Swinton as the grubbily horrid ""Mother"", Lesbian Matriarch of the seedy Gay club which provides the hot bed for both creative and destructive forces to which Bacon and his contemparies are drawn, throughout the film.",1111276800,12,2363,4.895
1085548,3,6305847045,"This film is about the famous painter Francis Bacon, specifically his relationship with his lover George. Francis meets George when George is breaking into his studio to rob it. Francis offers George a deal: he can have anything he wants if he sleeps with Francis. This marks the beginning of their tumultuous and unlikely relationship. Francis, although a famous and respected artist, is cold, sarcastic, and often cruel. Aside from George, his only other relationships seem to be a handful of artistic friends who occasionally hang out in pubs together and mostly take turns putting each other down. George, an uneducated boxer, obviously doesn't fit into this world at all. But it doesn't really matter at all to Francis, who sees him mostly as a sexual plaything, as opposed to a real partner. Surprisingly, George falls in love with Francis, and begins trying to win his attention and sympathy in increasingly self-destructive ways.
Visually, this film is very true to Francis Bacon's paintings. It's full of imagery that suggests cages, pain, confusion and psychological torture. As a character study, this film suggests that Francis Bacon was just as disturbed and unpleasant as his paintings.",1064966400,25,1200,5.190721649484536

A few of the intermittant shots are not the most original and the storyline might not be to all tastes, but the Jacobi-Craig clash and borderline humour of supporting characters combine for some wonderfully twisted dialogue that brings it alive!  If you're aware that none of Bacon's work is on offer, and appreciate tongue-in-cheek humour of it's darkest type then you will love this film.",1054857600,4,524,4.811111111111111
1085550,2,6305847045,"While the casting of Derek Jacobi for this film on Francis Bacon's tumultuous affair with George Dyer seemed promising, the film was bankrupt much on plot and they had no authority to show either the man or his work.  Instead, they opted for this odd exercise in film interpretation and come up with some of the worse cliche's of madness and creativity: Bacon smearing himself with paint, looking at himself in fractured mirrors, George descending down a spiral staircase, looking at people through distorted barroom glass.  These are all images pulled from other artist biographies obviously and seem to want to make the cooerlation that life is a distorted sewer and we're all Bacon's subjects.  Oh please.  We got that message in the first 10 minutes.  Why continue?
That said - alot of the other imagery was beautiful and some of the camera techniques would have made for a better low budget movie on Bacon had they taken the time to invest in actual interesting script development, not images and vignettes.  They did try to make an effort and draw a line between what the artist saw and how he painted.  The problem was that this failed miserably, and Jacobi comes off as petty and comical.",1046822400,5,1196,4.776699029126213
1085551,5,6305847045,"The essence of painter Francis Bacon is not a personal life lived on the sordid side but how he was forced to take in life.  Seen through his central nervous system and eyes, we experience  his world of fragments, like collage pieces of existence.  The only place he could make those fragments whole was in a painting. Otherwise, he was wholly inable to put a fully realized human being, himself, together.  Tellingly, one of his best friends comments that he has done a superb one-on-one job with his lover George in his paintings of George.  However, he has been unable to do that in his actual life lived with George!  That sums up Bacon, his art and his life, in a nutshell.

Bacon is not a person you will like but you will understand him and how the fragments of his existence made for great art.  Yet he is also the most alone person imaginable, something no amount of lovers and sordid excess could allay.  One of the very best films about an artist ever made.  You don't need to see the actual finished paintings since it is the fragments he used to build his paintings in his head that matter here.  If you want to see his paintings, you should be able to find page after page of them online in about a minute, or less, using any visual search engine.
