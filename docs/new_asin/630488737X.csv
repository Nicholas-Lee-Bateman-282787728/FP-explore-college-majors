It follows the life of several different Gret Siberian Grizzlies.
The area is the RUSSIAN Far East in Kronotsky Reserve-- few humans are around.
There are the very large solitary Male Grizzlies than are know to eat bear cubs
Another group is a first time mother with 3 recently born Cubs
The third group are two young males who are out on their own for the first time
One meets them leaving there dens high up on mountain slopes and there slow track first to grass lands for some food after the long hibernation.
They are on the way to lake and rivers where vast waves of Pacific Salmon coming to sport.
The lone large males grab all the best spots
The young mother is agood salmon catcher but must be careful least the large males attack her young
The 2 young males avoid the best fishing spots as this would expose them to those that win vigorous defend the spots-- they also have not yet mattered the art of catching the salmon.
For all the Bears it is imperative to put on a lot of weight so they have sufficient fat reserves to get them through hibernation.

Yes, you have seen it before, but this is from the RUSSIAN Far East, Canada or similar place",1433721600,,1241,4.395652173913043
