8730029,3,B0147OHF70,Really Dated USA Up All night movie. Its sexy and has a few really good jokes/laughs. But it does not hold up for anyone that wasn't a teen/adult in 1993.  Thankfully I was a teen when this thing aired on USA Network's Up All Night line up.  Not much to recommend if you don't like no budget sci-fi cheesecake. Its really dumb and would make a better porno feature than a actual movie.,1526601600,,385,4.260273972602739
8730030,3,B0147OHF70,either u get or u don't it what a good b movie all about bad acting bad lighting but good times back when movies were fun and not all bout high def,1495152000,,147,3.625
8730031,4,B0147OHF70,I loved it! Good musical soundtrack. Nice erotica. Whimsical.,1484352000,,61,5.888888888888889
8730032,4,B0147OHF70,"This is a classic Adult Sci-Fi with humor throughout.  As usual it deals with sex as the center of the story, but the Alien angle adds to the crazy humor.
 Just a fun movie with decent acting for the story.",1455148800,,206,4.125
8730033,5,B0147OHF70,"This movie is a screwy fantasy about a man whose brain is reprogrammed so he can have paranormal sex. Its kind of silly, but fun. There are a few unexpected twists that keep the story entertaining. I liked it!",1442188800,,209,4.384615384615385
