Most people didn't really want to watch an hour's worth of Oliver's parents and their misfortunes. I really do think this is a great movie, but I expected it to be a little more. For people who are like me and don't wish to see the parents, you could just as easily put on the second episode and watch Oliver Twist.",1042934400,,460,4.065934065934066
1399307,5,B000056PPA,"This version is by far the best ""Oliver Twist"" that I have seen.  The backstory is a stroke of genius, and rather than finding the added murder revolting, I thought it made much more sense than Edwin Leeford supposedly dying of a ""vague, undefinable desease"", ever so conveniently.  I like Dickens, but such an easy out is rather unrealistic, and so I'm glad Beasdale improved upon it.  I seriously doubt Dickens would have been sickened.
Also, the fact that everything is revealed about Oliver's parentage in the beginning, rather than being a mystery, adds rather than detracts.  It makes it more suspenseful, as we know all along and are just waiting for the characters to find out before it's too late.
The acting of Marc Warren as Edward ""Monks"" Leeford stood out to me as he portrayed a very intriguing character, but everyone was equally marvelous.  Micheal Kitchen was great as Brownlow, and Sam Smith as Oliver played an important role with skill surprising in such a young actor.  I give this 10 stars!",1024012800,6,1012,4.787356321839081

I was riveted from beginning to end, partly because Alan Bleasdale (Boys from the Blackstuff et al) did such a magnificent job of imaginatively expanding the story without taking anything away from the original.  Excellent performances by all, even the minor roles - I particularly liked Robert Lindsey as Fagin; Lindsay Duncan was beautifully evil; Marc Warren was wonderfully grotesque but sad at the same time; and Sophia Myles was heartbreaking as Oliver's mother.  All the actors gave 100%.  Had it been a movie instead of a TV series, surely it would have won an Oscar.

Anything Masterpiece theater does seems to know how to pick the best in actors, writers, costumes, location's the whole works. I definitely recommend this version of Oliver Twist no other. For I have seen how others have written about this story and did not in no way have the depth and the strong character's as this one of Oliver Twist.

To add characters to a story based on a Dickens novel - the author and creator of some of the best known characters in literature is silly in the attempt and has no chance of success. The editing is terrible and it is accompanied by a dreadful splash of horns and reeds. Fagan is portayed as a clown/magician. The bumbling Beadle in this screenplay is a womanizing leering creature. Andy Serkis and Emily Woof, who played Bill Sikes and Nancy were fortunate enough to receive the one small piece of the film that is believable. Where is the Dodger? Alun Armstrong and Keira Knightly should have stayed away. The Masterpiece Theatre narrator that proceeds each episode seems to apologize for what you are about to sit through.

1399319,5,B000056PPA,"My first observation is that the film provided incredible insights into life in the age of Oliver Twist - the early 1800s. The large number of orphans, perverted justice, upper-class snobbery and meanness, and the callousness of the lower classes all comes through.

The story itself is a masterpiece. Oliver is born to an unmarried woman who dies after giving birth, and then placed in a workhouse. He's sold for asking for more food (gruel with a few worms), but ends up in an even worse situation - taunted by an older apprentice in the undertaker's family. Oliver leaves after attacking his taunter when his mother's character is attacked, then accidentally falls in with a band of young thieves. There he's treated well, but arrested and sentenced to death for stealing - actually committed by another gang member. Fortunately, the victim realizes the error and rescues Oliver.

Oliver is now very well treated and appreciated, but unfortunately (re)captured by the gang - its leader is worried Oliver will tell on them. Eventually everything gets sorted out and Oliver finds his aunt and a loving home - despite a rich heir trying to have Oliver killed because he would have to split the inheritance with him.",1357344000,,1215,4.921951219512195
1399320,5,B000056PPA,"My copy is the British DVD release of this title, and is far less revisionist than any of the many other versions I have seen. Sam Smith's portrayal of Oliver screams purity and innocence, which is true to the text. Robert Lindsay's Fagin is bewitching, and it is easy to see why the boys submit to him. The evocation of London tallies with official records of what the different parts of London were like at the time. It shows clearly the difference in the standard of living of 'Respectable People' and society's most vulnerable. This was drawn directly from the text, which Dickens deliberately wrote as way of pricking the conscience of his readership. This was part of Dickens' effort to support the works of reformers such as Lord Shaftesbury and Doctor Thomas Barnardo.
One or two of the characters have been made slightly more human and palatable in this adaptation than in the original book. That is a reflection of the changing state of the audience, and detracts little from the overall effectiveness of the piece.",1354492800,,1025,4.796610169491525

1399322,4,B000056PPA,"For my money, at least, this 1999 miniseries is the DEFINITIVE screen version of Dickens' OLIVER TWIST.  Comprising four 95-minute instalments, the story plays out in great detail but the action is fast-paced and the performances are sublime - evoking all of the comedy and terror of some of Charles Dickens' greatest character creations.

The first 95 minutes are dedicated to the events leading up to Oliver's birth.  Agnes Fleming (Sophia Myles) is desperately in love with Edwin Leeford (Tim Dutton) and the feeling is entirely mutual, however, unbeknownst to Agnes, Leeford is still legally married to another woman - although long-estranged - and she is in no hurry to give him up.  Once Leeford inherits a great fortune in Rome, his wife Elizabeth (Lindsay Duncan) and sickly, epileptic son Edward, later known as Monks (Marc Warren), pounce and his fate is sealed.  Back in England, Agnes can no longer keep her pregnancy secret, and is sent into the countryside for a discreet confinement.  Hot on her trail, Elizabeth and Monks set off to destroy both mother and unborn child - their only roadblocks to inheriting the whole of Leeford's estate.

The story then follows the familiar tale of the orphaned Oliver (played with great charm and  sensitivity by Sam Smith), the boy who asked for more at the Workhouse, only to be sold off to an undertaker (Roger Lloyd-Pack), and later taken in by Fagin (Robert Lindsay) and his den of child thieves.  How Oliver winds up in the care of kindly Mr Brownlow (Michael Kitchen) isn't so much coincidence in this version, given his connection to the events surrounding Agnes and Leeford.  Brownlow is also the legal guardian of Agnes' younger sister Rose (Keira Knightley) - Oliver's aunt.

I've seen many versions of the story (and throughout childhood appeared in a few productions of Lionel Bart's musical version) but this 1999 TV adaptation had me absorbed in the action as through I was discovering it all for the very first time all over again.  I first ran into one of the episodes whilst channel-surfing one afternoon, and from there I was hooked.  I simply had to buy the DVD.

The performances are absolute perfection right down the line.  Robert Lindsay is both benign father figure and menacing magician as Fagin (one of his best ever portrayals).  As the tragic Nancy, Emily Woof is a real heartbreaker.  Andy Serkis is making something of a career speciality playing the Dickens villains (he has most recently portrayed Rigaud in the BBC's 2008 mounting of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Dorrit/dp/B001PU8N0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Dorrit</a>) and as Bill Sikes he is truly chilling.  Lindsay Duncan follows suit with her macabre Elizabeth Leeford, whilst Marc Warren just about walks away with the whole miniseries as Monks.

This DVD edition from PBS/Masterpiece Theatre is, I'm sad to report, edited from the original broadcast version (nothing terribly major but those who've seen it a few times will be able to tell what is missing).  The full version can be purchased on DVD from the UK.",1346889600,,3118,5.148809523809524
1399323,4,B000056PPA,"It is a shame it is cut from the British original.  Why it was made 360 minutes is a shameful matter even if making it an even 6 hours is the excuse.  Anyway, the region 2 is longer at 386 minutes, as marked on my dvd set, and why anyone would cut it is beyond me.

In my opinion, pitifully without motivations of perfection, this is alright, but the British full length is likely better for those who read the original books.

Yes, there are modifactions and embellisments but I consider them in the spirit of Dickens.  The themes are there for those who perceive them.  As for characters, readers of unabridged Dickens works would know Dickens created so very many, bizillions so to say, his novels are richly filled with them.  Some are complex, some not so, but all from his time as readers would know them.

I think they are not to be judged by simple stereotype thinking of today.

Of course, anyone can evaluate as each sees fit and proper, and I see no harm in many opinions which will help viewers in the course of time.

The human insight of a Dicken's work is not known in a moment.  This film is a good one.  The British is mine and is longer and I enjoy seeing it from time to time.",1301961600,,1195,4.262222222222222

1399326,3,B000056PPA,"Positives:

- The film absolutely explores the character of Monks as well as provides other important background information. Monks is portrayed as a hurt, greedy young man, but one with which an audience could sympathize.

- The production does an excellent job with Mr. Bumble's and Mrs. Mann's sequences, especially after they are married.

- Most of the plot follows logically even though the plot line has been ""twisted.""

- Fagin is at least portrayed as a bad-guy as in the novel and unlike in the musical Oliver! or the 2007 BBC production.

Negatives:

- The first 100 minutes of the film are spend exploring and interpreting 5 to 10 pages of the novel. While I think providing more background information on Edward Leerford and his parents was a positive choice, I wish they would not have spent more than 20 minutes exploring this part.

- Rose's character is not sufficiently explored. While she is portrayed as innocent and kind as a child, I really detested the are-you-the-boogie-man-sequence. Children in Rose's class were not idiots in the early 1800s. As soon as Rose saw Edward, she would have screamed and/or ran way. I understand the scene was supposed to play off of Monk's ugliness, but please, burglars have deformities as well as legendary boogie-men.

- Oliver is too young in this production. He should be played by an actor who appears at least 12 years old. The Dodger and Charley Bates are played by actors who appear almost adults. This takes away the psychological scenes between Oliver and the Dodger. In other words, there is not reason for Oliver to want the Dodger's acceptance, since the Dodger is like another Bill Sikes rather than an influencial peer of Oliver.

-Too many minor characters are eliminated or combined. Another reviewer, HAMLET, explores some of the combinations.

- Fagin is too much of a magician with a touch of insanity. In the novel, Fagin is a great psychological manipulator and hardly insane until the end when he is about to be hung.

*******************************

Overall, the production was interesting to watch.

However, I recommend the 1985 adaptation with Eric Porter as Fagin for people who want the story told in the most loyal manner. Unfortunately, the 1985 adaptation is not perfect, either (especially the 4:3 ratio and picture quality). However, it is the most loyal to the novel color production as of 2009.

If you really do not want to watch the 1985 adaptation in 4:3 aspect ratio, I would advise the 2005 adaptation starring Ben Kingley and Barney Clark with its 2.35:1 aspect ratio. (Even though this adaptation is seriously abridged, it really conveys the mood of Dickens' novel well.

Avoid the 1997 Disney adaptation and the 2007 BBC adaptation.",1245024000,,2734,4.93886462882096
1399327,5,B000056PPA,"I decided to buy this on DVD and compare it to the recent version of Oliver Twist that just played on Masterpiece Theater with Timothy Spall. Wow! I thought that one was good, but this one is the best I've seen.

I must start with the performance of Marc Warren as Edward Leeford. He took a character I couldn't have cared less about in other versions and painted a heartbreaking portrait of a disturbed human being.

I actually love Robert Lindsay's take on Fagin. From his look to his voice, he's a perfect physical interpretation of the character. Sure, the incorporation of magic into Fagin's background isn't exactly faithful to the book, but I like how it adds a bit of flavor and flamboyance to the him. While other versions have started making Fagin more sympathetic, this mini-series chose to stay reasonably faithful to the more flawed aspects of Fagin. Great job by both the filmakers and Lindsay. (Timothy Spall in the newest version is an interesting choice and very quirky. But I feel like I'm watching the true Fagin with Lindsay)

I was looking forward to Andy Serkis' Bill Sikes and he was appropriately scary. He's certainly physically brutal and not one you'd want to cross. I thought Serkis might add more layers to the character, but apparently not. In truth, it's difficult to turn a character so evil into anything more than a monster.

Julie Walters and David Ross do a fine job as Mrs. Mann and Mr. Bumble. I have to admit, however, I grew less interested everytime their characters appeared onscreen. Not the actors' fault. I just kept asking myself, ""Why do we keep going back to these two?"" Of course, they do become fairly important later on.

Sam Smith is pretty much the sort of kid I see when I think of Oliver Twist in terms of his angelic look. But I also liked his performance overall and the way he responded to others by making comments sometimes under his breath. Keira Knightly's Rose (who looks shockingly older than her actual age in this) is almost as heartwarming as Emily Woof's Nancy is heartbreaking. Also Michael Kitchen is a joy as Mr. Brownlow, as is Annette Crosbie as Mrs Bedwin. I don't want to forget Sophia Myles who really brings Oliver's mother to life.

This brings me to episode one of the mini-series, which is essentially the prequel to the more familiar story. It really ties together questions I probably had when watching other versions of the story. When I heard part one was entirely before the famous workhouse chapter, I was concerned. But Myles, Kitchen and Warren really make it work.

I was touched almost to tears when Oliver relays his story to Rose and Mr. Brownlow while lying in bed. Also when Oliver feels sympathy for Edward.

While the mini-series apparently takes a few liberties with Dicken's original story, it's very faithful compared to most versions and beautifully done.",1235433600,3,2855,4.741935483870968
1399328,2,B000056PPA,"Having recently listened to the novel read on CD, it seemed an opportune time to see a movie version. I picked this one largely because of the reputation of Masterpiece Theater. In this case, that was a mistake. I understand that a 600-page book into a two hour movie without losing some of the book. That was another part of what motivated my choice--this was six hours.

Unfortunately, the first two hours was spent ""explaining"" the background (which comes much later in the novel) and introducing major plot elements that are absent from the book. The last four hours was a lame retelling of most of the story (again, however, with unnecessary plot changes).

Part of the problem was the casting. The book takes Oliver from the age of ten to about twelve. The child chosen for the role, however, appeared to be no more than seven or eight years old, definitely too young for the part.

Another problem was the acting. Most of the characters seemed to be phoning in their roles, except for Michael Kitchen (Foyle's War) in the part of Mr. Brownlow. The actor who played Fagin played him as insane. The Bill Sikes character was a nonentity.

All in all a serious disappointment. About the only thing that can be said in favor of the movie was that they got the period setting right. Aside from that, look elsewhere for a good adaptation of the book.",1218067200,,1350,4.6125
1399329,3,B000056PPA,"When I first heard of this mini-series, my first thought was, ""Why another film version of this story?"" Then, I realized, upon seeing a scene from this series on YouTube, that this was probably the first version to include Rose Maylie, a character often cut from movie & TV versions of the story (I'd grown up seeing the 1968 musical ""Oliver!,"" which is a classic, and had also seen the Disney made-for-TV version) and wonderedhow the filmmakers had handled her character in this version. Upon learning that Kiera Knightley played Rose, I was the more enthusiastic, as I had seen her in the ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" movies, ""STAR WARS Episode I: The Phantom Menace"" and ""Pride & Prejudice.""

Ultimately, I was diasppointed. Though the decision to flesh out Oliver's baxkstory for 98% of the 1st episode was a brave one, so much of it was out of sync with the novel that at times I wondered if this was really based on ""Oliver Twist, Or The Parish Boy's Progress"" (the original title of the story when it was serialized in ""Bentley's Miscellany"" in 1837). The entire mini-series (6 hours split onto 3 discs) altered much of what was left of the novel. Some examples follow (with possible spoilers). While not a complete listing of the vast liberties taken with the novel, these are some of the most blatant.

SPOILERS AHEAD!!!! DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MINI-SERIES.

In the novel: Monks & Oliver's father dies of a mysterious ailment.

In the mini-series: Monks' mother kills his father and watches as he dies.

In the novel: Mrs. Maylie & Mrs. Bedwin are two separate characters who befriend Oliver.

In the mini-series: Mrs. Maylie & Mrs. Bedwin are combined into one character.

In the novel: Doctor Losberne is an old man and Harry Maylie is Mrs. Maylie's son & Rose's suitor.

In the mini-series: Doctor Losberne & Harry Maylie are combined into one character.

In the novel: Sikes accidntally hangs himself.

In the mini-series: Sikes commits suicide.

In the novel: Mr. Brownlow was not only an old man, but he never knew Rose personally until she came to him on Nancy & Oliver's behalf.

In the mini-series: Mr. Brownlow is depicted as a middle-aged man AND as Rose's guardian.

This last deviation REALLY IRKED me.

In the novel: Rose intereacts more with Oliver.

In the mini-series: Rose barely spoke with Oliver (not Ms. Knightley's fault; it was the screenwriter's fault); in addition, there was hardly any emotion when a secret involving both of them was revealed (again, it was entirely the screenwriter's fault).

When aired on TV in 2002, it was rated TV-PG for violence. Actually, the mini-series is Not Rated. I enjoyed it, as a period piece and, of course, because of Kiera Knightley (who was, I deeply feel, sorely underused).",1215820800,,2759,4.8012684989429175

1399334,5,B000056PPA,"Having no life, I make a point of trying to see every ""Masterpiece Theatre"" or BBC-type historical drama that I can.

And I would have to say, this is probably the best I've ever seen.  It's just so shattering, so beautiful, so emotionally exhausting to watch.  It's one of those movies that are so good that you forget you're really watching a bunch of actors, with lights, cameras, clapboards, etc.  You find yourself totally immersed.

One thing you should know is that, whether you get this movie on DVD or on VHS, there are three parts, each about 2 hours.

Surprisingly, though, only the second and third parts are, strictly speaking, adapted from Dickens's novel.  The first part is the prequel:  in the novel, the exact circumstances of Twist's provenance are left murky.  The first part of this series, made only for this ""Masterpiece Theatre"" production, is a two-hour spelling out of where he came from.  They've definitely taken some license there.

But incredibly, the first part -- the one not based directly on Dickens's writings -- is for me the most gripping and well-written of the three!  I can't believe how good it is.  Fits right in and then some.

One other note:  I'm probably not giving away anything by announcing that in the end, everything is set right and just desserts are apportioned to all.  Yet so crushing and infuriating is the Hell through which the waif Oliver must pass, that one is left to wonder if, even though the bad guys do get what's coming to them, the horrors we have seen are really made up for.

To tell you the truth, notwithstanding my regard for this production, I find myself unable to sit through it a second time.  The actors playing Monks, Bill, and Fagin do such a convincing, harrowing job of being evil to Oliver, that I simply can't take it, even though I know everything will be all right in the end.  It's just too much for me.

I also find this true of the book.  It's probably the only work of Dickens that leaves me with the feeling, when I put it back on the shelf, that the moral universe is still fundamentally out of whack.",1179100800,13,2092,4.554959785522788
1399335,2,B000056PPA,"I was thoroughly disappointed in both Masterpiece Theater and its production of Oliver Twist. The lengthy first disk contained virtually nothing out of the original Dickens novel. The characters behaved and spoke their lines as if they acting in a contemporary period made-for-TV melodrama. Oliver's father's wife seemed to trying out her lines for a voiceover as Disney's Cruella Deville. As far as a realistic portrayal of early Victorian life, viewers should remember that any man who took an umarried  middle class woman's virginity was not, and never could be, a gentleman. The prtrayal of the Beadle and the other characters in the workhouse scenes were farcical. I ceased to watch at this point. For a classic depiction of the novel on film watch the 1948 British production directed by David Lean.",1176249600,,805,5.098484848484849
1399336,4,B000056PPA,"I greatly enjoyed this DVD series for what it was -- a fine drama.  The production values are high and the acting is uniformly good.  (Andy Serkis is especially loathsome as Bill Sykes.)  However, the television ""adaptation"" merely borrows some characters and situations from the novel.  All of the first 90 minute episode takes place before the novel even begins.  It's interesting, and entertaining, to see what the script writer has made of the pre-history of young Oliver Twist.  But after he enters on the scene in the second episode, the drama strays farther and farther from the story Dickens wrote.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, as the story this film tells is a good story, and well told.  It's just not Dickens.  It bears a resemblence to Dickens, but only such resemblence as chicken soup bears to the roasted fowl.  Whilst wholesome and tasty, it's not the same thing.

Enjoy this for what it is, but look for the older BBC dramatisation for a truer representation of Dicken's novel.

1399337,5,B000056PPA,"Oliver Twist is a great adventure story of the struggles of a poor boy in England in the 1800's. The characters are realistic, interesting, people you don't meet everyday. Never a dull moment. You are taken to another time and place of adventure.

The 1948 version is best version with John Howard Davies as Oliver and Alec Guinness as Fagin, and John Newton as Bill. This 1999 version at 6-hours long is much longer than the other versions. The 1948 version is 2-hours long. This 1999 version spends a couple of hours telling about the romance between Oliver's parents, which is interesting, and which the other versions leave out. However, the 1948 version is much better cast and much more gripping. The 1933 version with Dickie Moore is not nearly as good as any of the other versions. I have seen other versions and liked them too. If you like this; Charles Dickens wrote the book upon which this DVD is based; also wrote the classics ""A Christmas Carol"" and ""David Copperfield"" also on DVD.

Other great period, adventure movies are ""Tom Brown's School Days 1935"", ""David Copperfield 1940 & 2000"", ""The Prince & the Pauper"", ""At Swords Point 1952"", ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer 1938"", ""The Three Musketeers 1939"", and ""The Scarlet Pimpernel 1935"".",1155945600,4,1254,4.8279069767441865
1399338,5,B000056PPA,"The poor reviews this movie has received (in both the DVD and VHS formats) I feel are totally unwarranted. This is my favorite put-to-film Dickens novel (except for the various ""A Christmas Carol's"" out there), and I am ecstatic that this version is finally available on DVD.
Now, in this adaption, I believe the prequel works very well. I think it makes this a much more comprehensive movie and gives the characters involved (especially Monks) much more depth. And, because of the length of this version that I am reviewing, it allows the viewer to get to know each character much deeper than the other filmed versions available. We get to know Oliver's parents and Aunt Rose up close, although it is done through liberties taken by the producer and not necessarily Dickens himself. I do feel, however, the great novelist would not particularly mind in this case.
The acting is as good, if not better, than pretty much most period epics I have seen. The actors play off of each other well - they match their roles perfectly. The costumes and sets are excellent. They have captured the early Victorian period so well  - both the good and the bad - it's almost as if the viewer is peering through a looking glass into the past.
As for the story following Dickens' original novel...well, I have yet to see any movie follow a novel to a ""T."" It just doesn't happen, unfortunately, with virtually any put-to-film novel. But this follows the original, as a whole, much much closer than the other versions I have seen - definitely more than ""Oliver,"" and infinitely more than the Disney version with Richard Dreyfuss, which was made into a totally different story than what Dickens had intended.
Don't let the nearly 6 hour length scare you off - there is no time during this whole version where one is bored (unless they are a child - definitely not a children's movie!). Being a fan of epic period movies, I found this to be as enticing as any other epic novels put to the screen.
Bravo to all involved!",1139875200,42,1999,4.630985915492958
1399339,3,B000056PPA,"Though well intentioned, it is odd that this Oliver is rated so high.  As a movie story it is excellent; however, as an adaptation of the story Charles Dickens wrote it is quite poor, I believe.  The story sequence is initially reversed distracting from Dickens' intent.  Characters and their relationship to each other does not follow the original story; some characters are used in place of others!  The script writers either considered themselves superior to Dickens and/or they never actually read Oliver Twist.  As a literature teacher I am sad that this fine theatre does not hold true to the story written by the master Charles Dickens.",1135382400,8,643,4.97196261682243
1399340,5,B000056PPA,"Absolutely the best adaption of the Charles Dickens novel I've ever seen. The acting is devilish good; especially Marc Warren (as Edward Leeford) and Andy Serkis (Bill Sikes) makes it worth watching over and over again. The whole cast seem to have put a lot of work into it, and not make this story ""just another classic costume horn of plenty"". A good story, a great writer but unique and wonderful acting.",1126569600,11,407,4.666666666666667

1399342,5,B000056PPA,"If you love Masterpiece Theatre, Charles Dickens, terrific writing and superb acting...then your life is not complete without this DVD.
I first saw this adaptation of my favourite Dickens novel when I was about 13 when it was first released.  Since then I've watched it over 30 times and memorized almost every single eloquently written line.  I fell in love with the plot and the characters, however villanous or cheeky they may be.  Just to name a few - Andy Serkis as Bill Sikes is the perfect frightening bad guy.  Robert Lindsay must be the greatest Fagin ever portrayed on the film; he is a rich, infamous, and slightly comical delight - a wonderful perfomance.  Marc Warren as the pathetic half-brother to Oliver, Monks aka Edward Leeford, acts his heart out, and one cannot help but love the character that we are supposed to hate.  Sam Smith who plays Oliver is marvelously innocent in his debut role.  That's just a few of the roles that stick out, but there are others who must be mentioned.  Julie Walters and David Ross are hilarious characters; Emily Wolf is a wonderful and beautiful Nancy; the now very recognizable Keira Knightley is a charming Rose Fleming; and Lindsay Duncan portrays the dispicable mother to Edward Leeford with perfection.
If you are looking for a word-for-word adaptation of Dicken's Oliver Twist, this is not it.  This takes many liberties with the story, and goes far beyond it, spending 1/3 of the story on life before Oliver.  It devolops every character, travels through every bit of Olivers life, and tells stories about his family, with a short but sweet epilogue.  It is incredibly believable and will impact you in some way I can garuntee.  It is one of those stories and films that will influence you, whether it is to be a writer or an actor.  I highly, highly recommend it.",1084060800,30,1824,4.752380952380952
1399343,5,B000056PPA,"This adaptation of Oliver Twist surpasses David Lean's spectacular version.
Oliver Twist is dark, brutal, and gritty, and it truly depicts the The Slums Of London, the Filthly Slums as Dickens' himself experienced it.
Alan Bleasdale penned the screenplay, and Oliver Twist was apparantly a labour of love for him. He had envisioned making Oliver Twist for his whole life, and finally sat down in 1997 to actualise his Twistian visions.
The first installment is Bleasedale's own creation; the 2nd & 3rd are the core of Oliver's hard life. The violence depicted in the series is harsh - this is not the same Masterpiece Theatre that we grew up with. The Artful Dodger is a cruel rogue in this one. Nancy is a whipping post. Sikes is woman-beater. Mr. Bumble is a nasty gold-digger. Oliver is physically abused, starved, and even walled up briefly.
This version features outstanding performances by Michael Kitchen, Robert Lindsay, Andy Serkis, Marc Warren, and Sam Smith, the young boy who plays Oliver. When Smith says, ""I want some more"", you get the chills.
Serkis & Marc Warren give exemplory, BAFTA-worthy performances as their characters. Warren reaps the benefits of Bleasedale's writings. Edward Leeford/Monks was a shady character in the novel; Bleasedale developed Monks, giving him a history, and Warren externalizes that history with shocking, authentic realism.
Thank you Alan Bleasedale, thank you PBS/BBC.",1077840000,3,1418,5.223684210526316

1399346,2,B000056PPA,"Surprisingly disappointing Masterpiece Theater miniseries. This rarely delivers any kind of exceptional performance, nor is the story organized and true to the book.

My only complaint is there are no English subtitles for the hard of hearing audience. That is a severe limitation since the new BluRay/DVD players now only have an HDMI output port. There is close captioning available, but I am forced to switch to NTSC video mode on my TV monitor. The video quality only slightly worse in the AV/NTSC mode so it is not a problem. It would be nice for the hearing impaired that a note in the DVD specification that indicate if or if subtitles in English are available in HDMI mode not just Close Caption in the standard NTSC/AV mode.",1517875200,,686,4.325581395348837
