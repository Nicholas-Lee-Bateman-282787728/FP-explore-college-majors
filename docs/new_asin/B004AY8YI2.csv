4312565,5,B004AY8YI2,"I've been attending The Bar Method classes for about 5 months now, and really enjoy them and have noticed huge changes in my body, particularly more sculpted arms and thighs.  While I aim to get to class 4 times/week, sometimes life gets in the way, so I figured I'd give this DVD a shot.  Glad I did!  It's definitely akin to Level 2/Advanced Bar Method class given the amount of thigh and seat sets that you do.  The other participants in the DVD show modifications, which are appreciated, to make the moves harder/easier if need be.  I found the instructor cheerful and informative, and I think she does a good job cueing as well as giving pointers on form, which is KEY in Bar Method.  As far as equipment, I used a lighter set of weights for shoulder work and triceps, a heavier set for biceps, a pillow and a towel in lieu of a mat, and a chair instead of the barre used in the DVD.  For the stretches at the end, I didn't find I needed a strap either-just used my hands.  If I have to pick on something, the music in class is usually a little better than the DVD, but as I do the DVD more often I may sub in my own music once I learn the moves.  All in all, great workout, very effective and much like class!",1301788800,20,1215,4.1581196581196584
4312566,5,B004AY8YI2,"The closest thing to an actual Bar Method class you will find on DVD. Fast paced and high energy, not a lot of gabber between sets. I was shocked at how much this resembled the classes I used to go to (but can no longer afford and only went to once or twice a week). It's been a year since those occasional classes, and  I've been doing this 4x a week for the past 3 weeks, and have definitely noticed the pain in my shoulders--which for the past 7 years have been in constant pain due to repetitive stress injuries--has totally disappeared. There is no other explanation for this happening except for this workout, since I still spend 8 hours in front of the computer as always. I don't know if it's the arm or ab exercises that are helping, but whatever it is, I'll take it.

(Not recommended for beginners--you should probably go to a few classes first to become familiar with the proper form and posture with each exercise, or try the Beginner's Workout DVD first.)

PS: Buy directly from barmethod.com and save tons of money.

UPDATE:

After a couple months of working out to this DVD consistently, I noticed my legs were getting HUGE. I don't think these exercises are for everyone (if you check reviews on Yelp, etc. the huge-legs complaint is pretty common). Also, it made my already bad ankles and knees worse. All that tip-toe standing is not for me. Now I skip the leg exercises altogether and am looking for an alternative.

UPDATE 2: I found the alternative--The Tracy Anderson Mat Workout (which you can buy at a discount on QVC.com). The standing abs will make feel like a total idiot, but if you do them right, you will realize after a few days that they are working. This DVD has been very gentle on my poor knees and ankles and yet kicks you in the butt. Highly recommended.",1298937600,66,1792,4.4815950920245395
4312567,5,B004AY8YI2,"I've been doing the designer sculpting and fat-free videos, but this one is much better!  Be forewarned that if you're uncomfortable with designer sculpting or fat-free, this will be a more challenging video so work up with the first two first, then tackle this one.

Contrary to an earlier review, I enjoyed Marnie Alton as an instructor.  You will observe that she is smiling throughout the entire video.  I think it's annoying, albeit in an endearing way. She is strong! She does the exercises with such ease. The other participants in the video who are fellow instructors are struggling through it.

The video shows the participants using a barre, but you don't need it as a sturdy chair will do.  She does a lot of repetitions of each move so it burns.

Again, this is a very challenging video. My husband who's never done any barre work tried this last week.  He's hooked despite it being so difficult. He's improving everyday so he's able to keep up with all the moves and have a better form.",1297814400,11,999,4.636363636363637
4312568,5,B004AY8YI2,"After becoming horrendously hooked on Bar Method classes, I needed a cheaper fix.  (Classes are up to $25 a pop!)  I tried a cheap, used ""Bar Method Body - Fat Free"" video but was entirely frustrated and bored by the slower pace and lower intensity relative to the real deal.  Still, this addict needs her fix, so I upped the ante and sprung for the Dancer's Body DVD.  I took it on vacation.

Sweet, endorphin-release bliss!  My thighs shook and burned just like they do in class!  In fact, there are some parts of this DVD that I prefer to the class.  For the uninitiated, this workout is like no other that I'd tried before--and I've tried a lot.  The Bar Method combines pilates, yoga and ballet to sculpt your body incredibly quickly.  All muscle groups are effectively targeted, and these small but crazy-intense exercises are interspersed with stretches that feel marvelous and increase flexibility.

I found myself making time for this DVD over the holidays nearly every day because I WANTED to do it--both my body and mind craved it.  This workout feels like an exploration of my body and its (current) limits.  I've never felt more mentally connected and engaged during a workout before.  In fact, because I became convinced that my body was lengthening from these workouts, I measured and discovered that I'm actually a half inch taller now.  I'm clearly stronger, and, although I haven't yet dropped pounds (no cardio in the workout and I don't seem to care to change my healthy but ample diet) I look leaner and more sculpted.  I don't think I'll tire of this workout because I liken it to cooking or any other craft--there's always something to focus on and/or improve.  It's a blueprint for a more connected mind and body...a beautiful body at that.

Some practical details:  you'll need light weights and a sturdy chair.  I'd recommend a mat, too.  If you're new to the Bar Method, this might not be the best starting point, as it moves pretty quickly and form/technique are important.  Even if you're not new, expect to be sore!  I STILL get that good sore feeling after months of this workout.  I just can't recommend this DVD enough.",1295395200,116,2152,4.7077747989276135
4312569,3,B004AY8YI2,"This is not a work-out for new moms or working moms as you won't have over an hour a day to do it. But if you have time, and you can follow through, it's a very good program. I like the stretches right after each exercise. For now, I'm on Shan T-25.",1421452800,3,249,3.8076923076923075
4312570,4,B004AY8YI2,"I love this video. It would be nice to have a choice of having no voice over once you do it a few times. The instructions are necessary at the beginning, but too much after a while.",1410134400,2,181,3.918918918918919
4312571,5,B004AY8YI2,"Took Beyond Barre classes for about a year and then had to move to another country that doesn't offer Barre classes in the area. I really wanted to continue doing Barre so I ordered this DVD. Definitely challenging and similar body workouts to what I did in my classes. I like how you can skip to certain parts of the DVD - such as working legs, abs, arms, etc. Some days I just don't have energy or time for the entire video so it works well for me.",1401148800,5,450,4.125
4312572,5,B004AY8YI2,"Amazing workout, however, I was shocked to see that it was half the cost on other websites (including the Barre method site). THANK YOU to the other reviewers who mentioned shopping around! Otherwise, excellent workout. As a certified trainer, registered yoga instructor, Pilates mat and reformer instructor, figure competitor and physical therapist I highly recommend this as an addition to a balanced workout schedule. If you are new to barre work, yoga or Pilates you might try a more beginner barre method DVD. However, if  you are already highly active or ready to take it up a notch I with your barre workout this is for you! This DVD definitely won't disappoint those who currently attend live classes, as it mimics those much more so than the other DVDs. Never tried barre work? It's a great way to add balance, core, flexibility and strength to your routine. I use it in conjunction with cardio, strength work, metabolic training, skill work, functional training and more traditional styles of Pilates and yoga.",1399161600,7,1020,5.0
4312573,5,B004AY8YI2,"I really liked this dvd and I did find it challenging but not imposible to do.  In my effort to archive a long lean body I have tried workouts like jillian michaels, Insanity, tracey Anderson, turbo fire, tonique, Cathe, Jari Love, Phycique 57, Tracey Mallett, Tapaut xt and Dream body workout just to mention some and all of the above workouts are really good but the once the I have found more effective for the womans body are barre dvd, Dream body workout and tonique and if you combined toning and cardio and I clean diet you will see amazing resuts.  My body has never been more lean and tone with out any bulk I have muscle definition now and I like it and that is amazing expecially after havinh 3 kids. This workout will leave you feeling really good.",1395446400,4,760,4.421428571428572
4312574,5,B004AY8YI2,"This is an excellent workout. You can do sections or the entire hour. I appreciate that you do not necessarily get super sweaty while doing it but can still feel like you thoroughly worked your muscles. The exercises use small, intense repetitions.

I think it is useful to look at the results of an exercise routine. I have tried many styles of exercise with limited or no results. It is very frustrating when you are not getting the changes in your body that you are looking for. I have been using this dvd maybe 4 times a week for a little over a month. Combined with watching my diet, I have lost nearly 9 pounds. My posture has improved. I am seeing more definition in all my muscles and my stomach is starting to flatten. One of the best things is that I feel like I am not punishing my body when I do it--no jarring burpees or plyometrics. For the first few days after doing to routine my calves were so sore that I had to walk a little slower, but they have since adjusted. You will probably be sore at first.

Do you want a body that looks like a female body builder or do you want to look like a lean, graceful dancer? I know my answer. Thank you for this wonderful workout! I wish I had found it years ago.",1391904000,13,1217,4.196581196581197
4312575,5,B004AY8YI2,"I got this as a Christmas present and my mother (who gave it to me) forgot to get the beginner one too!  So although Ive never done barr I decided to give it a whirl.  Its definitely a great workout and quite the challenge heres a few things you need/might want to know:
1.  You will need dumbbells/weights.  I suggest two different weights (for a total of 4 weights/dumbbells).  I used some 1.5 lb ankle weights I already had and that was fine for arms but insufficient for back work.
2. If you have poor knees this may strain them.  There are a lot of squat like movements.
3. The DVDs  are sold for half the price on the Burr Leonard website (hand weights are also sold on there).
4. I think anyone can attempt to do it but I fully understand the reason its for advanced.  She moves quickly through the exercises and you get more benefit if you perform them correctly.  That being said the DVD also has a small tutorial on the movements you can watch before you do the workout.  I found this incredibly helpful.
5. It is a core work out and you will use you abs in every movement, but there is an isolate abs section at the end.
6. You WILL be sore.",1390435200,6,1152,4.195454545454545
4312576,5,B004AY8YI2,"Wow, talk about a ""butt-ripper"" !  I have over about 10 months worked my way up from the Challenge, Sculpt I, and Sculpt II DVD's each starting out a little more difficult.  THIS one is tough!  I love it though.  I need to be challenged at all times and this does a great job of that.  By the way, I am 64 yrs old and have the body of a 35 yr old.  Seriously.  The Bar Method WILL change your body regardless of your age.  I do keep my weight down which helps but this Bar Method has toned my abs, butt, thighs, and arms better than any exercise I've ever tried.  And I've tried them all.",1386028800,14,588,3.9572649572649574
4312577,5,B004AY8YI2,"About a decade ago I purchased and used the Bar Method's Fat Free/Designer Sculpting set.  I liked it and got good results, but after a while it became a little dull and slow paced.  Coming back to the more recent set of Bar Method DVDs over the past year, I am a convert.  The new DVDs do a much better job of explaining the exercises, and there are different levels and paces to choose from.  I am currently alternating between ""Dancer's Body"" and ""Super Sculpting"", which are two of the more advanced options.
I use these DVDs as my strength workouts.  They not only work on muscles that make us look good ( the big selling point of this technique), but they also really help functional strength and posture.  I also run and do yoga, and I've been so pleased with improvements in both as I've gotten stronger through these DVDs.
I've tried Pure Barre and Core Fusion as well, and although I've liked different aspects of them, I think the Bar Method is superior.  The DVD workouts tend to be a little longer (about 1 hour), but in my opinion they do a better job offering a full-body workout and integrating stretching.
I like the slightly different take of the instructor in ""Dancer's Body"" on the exercises.  The workout is tough and fast-paced, and like other Bar Method advanced DVDs incorporates some extra sets of pushups and thigh work to the usual progression of exercises for greater calorie burn.
Echoing other reviewers: buy from the Bar Method's website--$20 plus $4 shipping.",1379721600,2,1491,4.66412213740458
4312578,5,B004AY8YI2,"I have recently returned to using Bar Method DVDs alternating with my treadmill, as I like the stretching and lengthening involved after each segment.  After only a few weeks, I've really seen changes in my body in the ribs-to-hip area that is so difficult for women to keep toned.  However, now being familiar with the routines and the instructions, I was getting slightly bored with the DVDs I already have because of the amount of cueing and the time spent between segments.  Dancer's Body is NOT the DVD for anyone new to Bar Method, as it has much less instruction and cueing than other Bar Method DVDs and is quite rapidly paced.  But wow, I sure was not bored!  Some of the pacing especially when changing segments was almost too quick, and I wasn't able to keep up with all the sets - she also does more sets than Burr Leonard does - and I was sweating and wrung out at the end.  Just what I was looking for!  I found the instructor upbeat and motivating without being overly perky.  And thanks to a previous reviewer's tip, I zipped over to eBay and found it for $19, which is an amazing price.  I wish Bar Method offered more DVDs and hope they will in the future.",1375833600,3,1174,4.398148148148148
4312579,5,B004AY8YI2,This is def an all body workout! Very small movements but my muscles are sore! i already feel my posture improving too!,1370822400,2,119,4.454545454545454
4312580,5,B004AY8YI2,"I have just about all bar type workout DVDs, along with the other Bar Method (Burr Leonard) DVDs, these are my preferred workouts, I like having a different instructor on this one, it helps to change things up a bit.",1370304000,,216,4.425
4312581,1,B004AY8YI2,"From someone who has studied dance, this DVD along with the other BAR Method Dancer's DVD's are over priced and under deliver. If you are expecting advanced dance techniques, look elsewhere. The title is catchy but fraudulent. There are less pricier DVD and books out there that offer much more. Even a child's dance book is better than this. I feel for the positive reviews. From now one even if the product has 500 5 start ratings and only 5, 1 star ratings, look at the one star ratings before making a decision. I have learned the hard way. Those 5 negative reviews are closer to the truth than the puffing of a multitude of 5 stars.  In my opinion there are very few things  out there that deserve a 5 star rating. Often these ratings are not just for the one item mentioned but if it comes in a series that can be purchased separately will be lumped together, giving a false sense that it is better than it really is.",1370044800,9,923,4.3604651162790695
4312582,5,B004AY8YI2,"If you are not new to the Bar Method, I highly recommend the Dancer's Body.  This one is the closest to the work out you would receive at an actual class and the number of repetitions (including Marni's three chances) definitely will take you to shaking and muscle failure.  I burn about 450+ calories with this workout.  The next best is the Bar Method Super Sculpting (you need the ball for this) followed by the Bar Method Super Sculpting II (also need the ball).  Doing either of these I burn around 400 calories.  The next in line are the Bar Method Change Your Body followed by the Bar Method Accelerated Workout.  These are somewhat easy if you are not new to the Bar Method, i.e. do these on Mondays after a big weekend and they burn around 350 calories.  (Of all the videos, Marni teaches the Dancer's Body and Burr teaches the rest.)
There is no substitute for the classes--especially if you are a beginner.  The DVDs go a very good job of explaining the poses; however some of the poses feel very unnatural.  Because of this, it at all possible, you should try the class at a studio to get the corrections from an instructor.  This is especially true for what the Bar Method calls its ""secret weapon"" where you are tucked, leaning forward and creating resistance to pull your leg back in an almost unperceivable motion.",1368144000,11,1330,4.550420168067227
4312583,5,B004AY8YI2,"The instructor absolutely made this DVD so great for me.  Her cheerful, sweet attitude kept you going through every lift and squeeze.  Great workout.  Do yourself a favor & buy it on the Bar Method website where it sells for $20.",1367884800,,229,4.536585365853658
4312584,5,B004AY8YI2,"For some reason this states that my DVD is with Burr Leonard, it isn't. The instructor on this DVD is Marnie Alton and she's fantastic. I am lucky enough to take classes with Marnie and bought this DVD to take on vacation with me. It's the next best thing to taking her class.",1366588800,,276,4.226415094339623
4312585,3,B004AY8YI2,"This video came highly recommended to me as a great workout.  However, I was really disappointed.  The lower body workout was challenging and I definitely had to take breaks because my muscles were on fire!  The upper body and abs workout, not so much.  Specifically, biceps and shoulders were not challenging whatsoever.  I even used heavier weights but that didn't really help.  My personal ab workout is much harder as well.

If this workout is the hardest workout they offer, then I will be looking elsewhere.  For $42, I was hoping for more.",1366329600,5,546,4.795698924731183
4312586,4,B004AY8YI2,"I thought this was a really good workout!  It definitely gets your glutes and thighs burning, and it is a good core workout.  It doesn't have as much downtime between exercises and some other Bar Method DVDs have, which I really appreciate.  The explanations are nice, but not needed after doing the workout once or twice!  The instructor was a little yoga-ish for me, but really tolerable and motivating.  I will definitely put this in my rotation regularly!!",1364947200,5,460,4.846153846153846
4312587,5,B004AY8YI2,"I prefer workout DVDs because I don't have to get fancy or give a crap what I look like or hop in the car and drive across town and be somewhere at whatever time class starts or pay $10 (or more) for a class. With a workout DVD, you really have no excuse not to work out. Having started with Callanetics in high school as a supplement to my ballet training, I have long been a barre workout aficionado. I crave that wobbly jello feeling after a kick-ass workout,  but as time goes on it's hard to find a workout that is challenging enough for me. Squeeze by Tracy is hard enough, but it also makes me want to stab the television. It's not fun, it's just grueling. This workout is super hard, but it's upbeat. Challenging but not sadistic. Marni is always offering gentle reminders about posture that really make the difference. I would love to see more Bar Method workouts starring Marni, she is a joy to work out with. The time flies, and I feel like jello afterwards. Mission accomplished!

I purchased this DVD from the Bar Method website for way less than the amazon price. You'll need a sturdy chair and light hand weights for the workout, and a bathrobe strap for stretching.",1362441600,12,1181,4.43778801843318
4312588,5,B004AY8YI2,"This is a very good, and intense workout video.  I was an avid runner for years, and had taken up cycling after a recent back surgery, so I had to come up with other workout options to stay tone since running or any exercise involving impact was no longer an option for me.  Let me tell you, the workouts in this DVD engaged all my seat, back, and ab muscles without any impact and with very little motion.  I was literally shaking at the end of it.  Also, you don't need to purchase extra equipment, at most, you will need is a set of small dumb bells, and a towel for one stretch at the end.  The rest of the exercises can be done with a kitchen chair, or counter, something above waist level to place your hands on for balance.  That is if you are not a serious ballerina, and you are just someone looking for a good workout.

If you're a cross fit or insanity lover this is probably not a workout that you would enjoy. I'm not saying this because you'll be able to power through it without a problem, I am saying this because the type of exercise could be a bit boring in comparison to cross fit or insanity.  The exercises are small controlled movements, yet intense, and are designed to aid in flexibility, all of which are very important when it comes to dancing.  This is a great exercise for those who like to workout in the privacy of their own home, who can not, or do not like high impact/energy exercises, and who are also bored with the typical squats or lunge exercises normally used to tighten ones seat and hamstring muscles.",1362268800,9,1542,4.307958477508651

I am really impressed with both videos. Both are very close to a real, class workout, with clear instructions. It gives me an amazing workout (including the burning and shaking), and seeing terrific results. The instructor in this Dancer's Body video, Marni, is energetic, encouraging and makes me fall in love with the pain I am inflicting on my body. But it's effective and switching out the two workouts has made the gym null for the last 60 days, getting better results with these workouts.

4312598,4,B004AY8YI2,"Let me address the instructor off the bat.  The annoying part is that her voice sounds like a 5 year old at times.  She particulary yells out SEVEN!!!!alot and I swear you would think it is a child talking.  She sounds very much like Julianne Hough from Dancing with the Stars.  Is she annoying?  Not as bad as I was expecting and since it seems genuine and not forced, I can deal with it.  She seems very sweet.  I wish Burr made some sort of appearance in this workout as I feel that it isn't really a true Burr Leonard workout but more of a spin-off leveraging the brand.  She does appear in an option from the menu to see the moves demonstrated.  She still looks phenomenal!

On to the workout.  I did this once when I first bought it and shelved it.  I've since done it twice more after doing bar workouts religeously for the last 6 months.  I have done bar in the past but always lose interest after a couple of months but this time I have been doing bar 80% of the time and light cardio the other 20% of my time for about 7 months and bar workouts have truly made me go down 2 blue jean sizes as Burr says.  I alternate the original 2 Bar Methods, Accelerated Workout, Change your Body, P57 Original, Core Fusion and Lotte Berk.

This review I am writing is from memory having just completed my 3rd time doing the workout.  My recollection might be just slightly off.

Traditional knee ups to get warmed up and then right into weight work.  Starting with your typical shoulder work (alternating arm lifts from leg to ears), then 2 different bicep positions and 2 different tricep positions.  The tricep work was a little different in the positioning of your palm facing down which was enough to cause nice soreness the next day since it worked my muscles slightly different.  Then there are traditional tricep dips (I think it was 5 sets, it was enough I was definitely feeling the burn and at failure at the last set).  I think it was off to pushups from there.  The instructor tells you and shows you, you can do them on your knees but all participants including her do them all on toes.  Then you move to plank pose and hold for approximately one minute.

Off to bar work. She mostly uses ballet poses which is why I think it strays just slightly from traditional Burr workouts even though the moves are very similar.  There are approx. 5 sets of calf lifts in a turned out position (I can't remember the ballet term she uses..I think it is releve?).  I think this is a good sort of warm up to get your legs ready for the pain they are about to go through for the rest of the standing workout!  Then you are in plie position with your seat tucked for multiple sets.  For each exercise, the format is 1 or 2 sets of about 8 reps and then 3 more sets of 8 pulsed reps at a faster pace.  Then several sets of feet in small pie, heels elevated together, knees over toes in different variations.  I really liked the emphasis on the tucks in the moves since I always feel the work from the tucks the most and am always after reducing hip size!  Then the last one is sideways at the bar, feet hips width apart for more of the water skier type pose (hips tucked, leaning backwards) for what seemed like a ton of reps.  This exercise bothers my feet a bit being on the balls of my feet for such a long period of time, still felt very effective.

Then there are a few stretches at the bar and stretches on the mat in a lunge/split mode.

More bar work for the glutes include bending over with your leg in an arabesque lift.  Then there is a bent knee leg lift position.  Again, the format is 1 or 2 sets at a slower pace and then 3 sets of 8 at a faster, pulse pace.  I felt the glutes were worked well but not as well as Lotte High Round Assets.

Onto the mat for ab work, I found myself recalling Burr's tips from other DVDs about breathing out as you draw your abs in.  Marnie doesn't really use the same tips as Burr but she does give tips along the way.  I miss Burr the most during the ab section, for some reason with Burr I can always work up an intense sweat during abs and stay focused.  With Marnie, I felt like I was drifting into ""when is this going to end"" mode.

There was another 2 or 3 sets (8 reps) pushups followed by a set of 16 pulse pushups.  I might be slightly off on these counts.

Then there is some stretching and on to back dancing.  The back dancing has a variation to lift one leg straight up in the air (a la Cathe Butts & Gutts) which I did and definitely felt the added burn. Again, this is where I feel there is a shift from traditional Burr method technique (not a bad thing but just noting) for example with some traditional back dancing there are variations of doing sets with heels lifted, toes lifted, knees together etc...there wasn't any of that.

There is no knee dancing and no pretzel work which is disappointing to me as I feel those moves intensely.

I will keep this workout for variety and to mix things up a bit to confuse my muscles, but it's not my favorite.  I much prefer Burr's Change your Body and the Accelerated Workout to this one.  This one also doesn't have too much of a dread factor and it does move quickly without much pre-position commentary as some of the other bar workouts tend to have (Burr's originals come to mind).",1353888000,11,5286,4.238
4312599,5,B004AY8YI2,"Wonderful, feels so good workout! Not original, but very good, in fact classic, moves (like Exhale Core Fusion, Lotte Berk, Callanetics, Pop Physique, Physique 57, Squeeze). It is a very long workout- 85 min.

It is not a beginner workout, if you are intermediate, you probably have to change the exercises a little or stop when you need it. The beauty of this dvd is that you can keep growing with it. The good thing is that I got this dvd in ebay for $12.99, I was the only bidder at that time. Such a luck. Now it is so expensive.

4312604,5,B004AY8YI2,"Wow!  I have been doing the Bar Method & Accelerated workout DVD's for over 2 years.  And the Bar Method Pregnancy DVD throughout my pregnancy.  I treated myself to Dancer's Body Advanced Workout, and it is hands down the best Bar method DVD I've tried.  I sweat like I've never sweat with Bar Method before.  And I'm seeing results really quickly.  I can now do 24 real push ups- for the first time in my life.  Some reviewers have commented on Marnie Alton's teaching style.  I actually think she's better than Burr Leonard!  She gives more specific cues. In fact, I've taken the knowledge I've learned from Marnie, and applied them to the other 2 Bar Method DVD's I still regularly use, to improve my form.  I aspire to be as strong as she is!  That's what I need in an instructor: somebody who gives specific info on correct form, who works out the whole time (I hate it when the instructor wanders around but expects me to work out the whole time!), and who is stronger and fitter than I am, so I have lots of room for improvement, and fitness goals to aspire to.  I wear my heart rate monitor and I burn at least twice as many calories as I do with the other Bar Method DVD's.  Rotating these DVD's has helped me lose almost all of my baby weight within 6 months.  I am a Bar Method devotee for life!!",1330732800,23,1307,4.30327868852459

It comprises of ballet like moves, and a lot of small movements - it gets INTENSE!! The burn is so bad that it's good! :) The best part of this workout is that as you get better at it, you can keep going up in your level by getting even more concentrated on the movements and balance.
Some people posted that they found Marnie Elton annoying. On the contrary, I found her graceful, strong, and gave such precise directions on the form right at the minute you need it! She tells you exactly when to concentrate on keeping your shoulders down, elongating your neck, keeping chest out etc....without her instruction, it would be hard to do this workout with the proper form. And form is extremely important for this type of workout to be effective.
In terms of results, I can already see changes - my body looks ""smaller"".",1319500800,8,972,4.405555555555556
4312607,5,B004AY8YI2,"I have just completed week 1, 4x a week Dancer's Body Advanced Workout and I must say it IS a workout.  My calves were on fire for 3 days straight, but on my designated workout day, I got back into it.  Today was day 4 and I am proud of myself that I stuck with Marni and the other master instructors.  I know they have more time invested in this workout, but I could see the endurance it took on their faces and it made me feel normal.  I am determined to give it my best and even add another day on before I embark on The Bar Method's Sculpt I&II.

I was pleasantly surprised at how tiny movements can make such a huge impact on your body. There is no jumping around, just precise movements that make you focus on what muscles you're working. Also, this video is hard. I am able to do it because I am pretty fit but if you are a beginner do not buy this. I am absolutely in love with this video and how I feel afterward.
