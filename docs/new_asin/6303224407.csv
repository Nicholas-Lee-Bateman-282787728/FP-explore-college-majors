599015,4,6303224407,"This movie is ideal to show for children and for family gathering as the first 10 chapters are talking about a Christmas party.  Lot of children on screen aroused interest to my children as they pay attention to what's  happening next.  Once we would like our children to sit tight, we would  show this movie to them.  Other movie or even cartoon could not do such a  good job.  Of course good music from Tsak do help their concentration.",946339200,2,438,4.468354430379747

If you have a young dancer like me, and you're thinking about what to get her or him, get  this! She'll love it!

My DVD of this, which apparently is out of print with no blu ray version available (why they never issued this in blu ray is beyond me). For some reason, the picture improved some as it went on, but the sound is awful. My guess is that the streaming uses the MP3 codec, which, if you have an excellent ear for these things, sounds awful. Amazon, encourage Warner Bros to put this out on blu ray!!",1483488000,,537,4.223300970873787

Amazon was kind enough to give us a refund but I have no idea if this is something they fixed or if it will happen if we try again. We stream all the time and never have trouble.

599153,4,6303224407,"I'm not well versed on The Nutcracker or ballet. The first time I saw it in a theater it made no sense (yawn). Now, of the two Nutcracker DVDs I own*, this version is much easier to appreciate as an amateur. I have another that is more professionally done and likely truer to the ballet form - but it's still quite difficult for me to relate to. Appealing music, acting, dancing.  There's no dialogue. The performers communicate through dance, gesture and expression. Beautiful scenery. Just enough background  narration to help guide you through the sequences. A delight to view. My only complaint is the video quality isn't up to today's standards. It's certainly colorful and watchable - but leaves me longing for a sharper clearer video image.

The other Nutcracker I own is a blutooth edition of the Royal Ballet performing live at The Royal Opera House in Camden Gardens,  London. Top-notch ballet performance  performed in a magnificent hall. Beautiful transfer to DVD as well. This one is not for beginners, however,  and probably won't appeal to many children.",1480723200,,1069,4.944134078212291
599209,4,6303224407,"I loved this! I remember seeing this as a kid back when it came out, I loved it then and I love it now. Kids (and some adults, too!) need more culture nowadays and this is a great way to introduce them! Don't listen to negative reviews from parents saying that the movie is bad because their kids wouldnt sit through it ... that's not the movie's fault! As for Macaulay's role as the Nutcracker Prince, I had no issue with it and I thought he did a great job, considering he wasn't a technically professional dancer. I loved watching him as a child actor, and always appreciated how seriously he took his role in this presentation.

The only reason why this isn't 5 stars, is because I think the quality of the movie itself could have been better, I would have liked to have seen it digitally remastered with a clearer picture and better packaging.",1480377600,,848,4.435897435897436
599210,5,6303224407,"I grew up watching this version of the Nutcracker on VHS and bought this when my old VCR finally died. It's a great version of the Nutcracker with superb dancing! As a child I loved it because Clara (or Marie) and the Nutcracker were also children and not adults playing children, they don't really dance but there's plenty of other amazing dancers to make up for that!

Balanchine's Nutcracker with New York City Opera in Vanity Fair in December so we were curious and wanted to see it. Not living in NY, buying the DVD was next best. The scenery was absolutely splendid (I was afraid it wouldn't be the stage highlighted in the December article). The dancers were phenomenal, no exceptions. Videoing was also extremely well done. (We have a video of River Dance where every three seconds they changed the angle; what a pain, when you buy it to see the dancing). They did not do that with Nutcracker. Balanchine was a genius and I'm so glad we had a chance to see his version. Of course, the music was awesome, too. It's  too bad Tschaikovsky did not live long enough to see it produced or know how the public loves it.

I am critical of the Balanchine story--the choreography and the costumes are exquisite, and the performances leave nothing to be desired, however, MACAULAY CULKIN as the prince? As an older viewer, and,I do realize this particular movie released in 1993--I still question the use of a recognizable star. Mr. Culkin was not old enough to be a real romantic. I particularly disliked his blond, insipid appearance. I thought he added a big ""vacuum"" instead of being dazzling, and desirable.

600499,3,6303224407,"If you're going to watch a version with the kids, it's probably the one to pick. It's easy to watch because there is narration for the story, good production values, pretty sets. But you spend FOREVER at the party, and just when you think it's over, they throw in a dream sequence where she flashbacks half of it because they're afraid you've already forgotten what happened, I guess. If you're watching for the actual ballet dancing, there are better versions. Macaulay Culkin was only cast because he was popular at the time, and you can tell he is trying hard, but he was clearly given only as much training as was necessary to do a few steps, and not particularly well.

Basically, I wouldn't say it was made for the 'lowest common denominator,' but it's definitely been dumbed down for mass consumption. I enjoyed it, I suppose, but I wouldn't watch it again.",1418688000,,864,4.647058823529412

600561,4,6303224407,"I have always loved productions of the Nutcracker (and Tchaikovsky's music, of course) since I was a  little girl.  I looked forward to hearing the music from ""The Nutcracker"" every Christmas season.  It was dancing in  Ballet West's version of Nutcracker as a party girl and soldier for several years that really made me adore George Balanchine's Nutcracker. I really wanted to introduce my love for this magical story to my son and this year I decided that I would at least make an attempt to try with a 2 year old! I had a wonderful time watching this with my 2.5 year old son...and even he liked it at his young age! The story and narration is very appealing to even the youngest child. He really enjoyed the whole introduction with all of the party girls and boys all the way through the Nutcracker's battle with the mice.  His attention started to drift when the actual ballet started...right around the Waltz of the Snowflakes (but even that isn't fair to say, because often times he will watch well into the ballet dancing!) As a dancer, I have to say that I like some versions of The Nutcracker better than this one (ESPECIALLY the version with Baryshnikov, Kirkland, Charmoli... that is one of my all time favorites). I am only giving it 4 stars because of this reason. I personally think that other versions that I have seen have incorporated more actual ""ballet dancing"" in the scenes with the young children (like the productions I danced in when I was a young girl...the children seemed to actually ""dance"" much more than in this particular version.) It this version, it seemed more like they were acting than dancing (from my point of view) but I still think that it was very entertaining and there is still plenty of ballet to go around after those beginning scenes. For young children though, I think this one is wonderful version and my son has really taken to this magical story and he now pretends that he is the Nutcracker Prince. I have (get) to be Clara (Marie). :) I enjoyed it very much and will probably make a tradition of watching it every holiday season.",1418515200,,2083,4.60377358490566

600905,4,6303224407,"I wanted to view this recording of Balanchine's Nutcracker ballet because of a book I've owned for a long time called A Very Young Dancer, a photo essay documenting a young ballet student's participation in this production, back in the 70s.

The production and filming of it are overall good - the DVD picture is fine and the photography is good - it's not easy to capture dance on film - some productions edit too much or don't focus on the whole dancer.  Some reviewers have noted that the production looks a little dated, but for me that's part of its charm.  It's true that the costumes and sets haven't changed much over the years, judging by photos I have seen, but I like that it has that continuity.

I don't like the narration, but I think it's good to have it for first-time viewers and kids so they understand the story line.

I wouldn't have cast Macauley Culkin, but I realize they probably did it because he was well-known at the time and I imagine the filmmakers were thinking that a ""name"" would bring in people who don't normally watch ballet.  I'd have preferred an anonymous young dancer, the way it would be in the actual stage production.

As far as the performances, the child dancers sometimes look nervous or stiff - understandable because they're kids and if one were watching the performance on stage, their faces would be too far away to see the expressions.  I like the fact that Balanchine used children in his productions when it was appropriate, rather than short dancers impersonating children.  As for the adults - WOW!  The ""Coffee"" dance and the Sugar Plum Fairy/Cavalier pas de deux are worth the price of the DVD alone.  Both are absolutely breathtaking.  The ""tree angels"" were great - I loved how they looked like they were floating across the stage.  The rest of the cast are across-the-board very good too.

If watching this with kids, bear in mind that the first part is mostly the party scene and there isn't much dance.  I got a little bored and I can see kids losing interest quickly.  It really picks up in the ""land of sweets"" second act.  While I was watching, I kept thinking that I prefer the first act of Baryshnikov's Nutcracker and the second act of this one.  It's probably better live - most things like this are - but as I said, I think it's worth watching for the performances of the adult dancers alone.

I think this recording is valuable because we need to preserve performance - whether dance, music, or theater - as a cultural reference for the future.  I would highly recommend watching this if you are a ballet fan or if you have an aspiring dancer in the house.  It's also fun to watch the other well-known version starring Baryshnikov and Gelsey Kirkland and compare the two, as I was doing in my head while watching this one.  They're both quite worthwhile.",1403827200,,2824,4.572564612326044

601114,5,6303224407,"This is the best video to introduce young kids to the Nutcracker, in my opinion.  It has an un-intrusive narration that helps children understand the story, especially all the ""treats"" in the second half.  Clara (actually Marie in earlier stories, I think) is young enough for the kids to identify with her and be more emotionally invested in the story.  It has drama, but is not too dark or scary.  It also has Clara/Marie's love-interest-turns-Nutcracker as a boy roughly her own age (Macaulay Culkin, who, frankly does very little dancing and is just fine, neither here nor there to us).  Having someone her own age works well, I think, and avoids the creepiness that is in some versions between Clara/Marie and the adult Drosselmeir.  It also seems to be the version that actually stays closest to the original Russian folk tale, as far as I can tell.  However, in the folk tales, the mouse king disappears when Marie hits him with her slipper, NOT when he is stabbed by the nutcracker-- the whole point is that SHE defends and protects the nutcracker, which she has vowed to do after her brother breaks it in the first act.  I wish current ballet productions would go back to that important detail of a bit of empowerment for Marie/Clara; it makes the story make so much more sense.

As an aside, our favourite picture book of the story is the Susan Jeffers ""the Nutcracker"", as it, too, stays closest to the original tale and has really beautiful pictures.  It is a great one to give as a gift, if you are looking.",1386460800,6,1520,4.617100371747212

How can you argue with Ballanchine's version, the one that made this ballet finally popular?

It was only a couple of years after ""Home Alone"", so Culkin was a child mega-star at the time. Casting him as the Nutcracker Prince was a way to bring people to the theater who may not have otherwise considered watching a ballet. Same goes for the occasional narration by Kevin Kline -- obviously it's there for novice Nutcracker viewers.

601422,5,6303224407,"There is another listing for the Nutcracker suite bearing an almost identical disc cover (save for the printing in the open mouth)which has nothing to do with this film version. From reviews there, it appears to be a non-professionally recorded version taken from the audience of the staged Balanchine performance.
Certainly, I have nothing to add to the other reviews as to the content. As far as I was concerned, never have seen the staged version by the NYC Ballet, this is what it purports to be, a film taking what it can from Balanchine but a film in its own right to be seen as that. As a ballet, certainly it would be better to have the children played by adults, as a movie it makes sense to have it as it is (I assume this is true for the projected audience for the film). What we see of the children dancing is charming, for children dancing. None stood out as the next Gelcey kirkland, but then, who can tell at that age. Where the NYC Ballet appears, in adaptations by Peter Martins, who succeeded Balanchine, they look good in lush settings appropriate to the season.
I can only guess at how well the film goes over with various age groups and types of audience; my guess is, that it will be fully appreciated by people who fully appreciate this sort of film. Since the last child actor I saw singing was Margaret O'Brien (no singer then or later) in a duet with Judy Garland, I found it a pleasing film when one is in a holiday mood or cares to be reminded of the holiday mood.",1276905600,5,1492,4.370503597122302

601481,5,6303224407,"In 1954, Russian-born choreographer George Balanchine staged a new version of ""The Nutcracker"" for his New York City Ballet. What sets Balanchine's version apart from the subsequent incarnations that would emerge in Soviet Russia and Europe is that it utilizes the original 1892 libretto. In fact, Balanchine's may be as close as one can ever get to seeing the original Maryinsky production by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov. Most notably, he preserved Petipa's emphasis on narrative over dance (used to great success in 1890's ""The Sleeping Beauty""), especially in the Act I party and battle scenes and the Nutcracker Prince's pantomime in Act II. We also get conventions that were eventually weeded out in other productions such as a distinctly German setting for Act I, and Act II divertissement representing actual confections as opposed to just geographic regions. This is a very pure version of the ballet: no strange Freudian undertones as with Maurice Bejart's or Rudolf Nureyev's versions, no oppressive Soviet realism as with Vasily Vainonen's production (or with productions influenced by it, such as Mikhail Baryshnikov's version for the American Ballet Theatre), and no adults playing the children's roles as with all of the above. Here, we get a simple story of childhood whimsy culminating in some spectacular visions of Christmastime including a giant Christmas tree, a torrential snowstorm, and a magnificent Land of Sweets.

Here we have the 1993 film version of the Balanchine production, some forty years after its premiere; and a very fine film it is. It is directed by Emile Ardolino whose influence on the filming of American dance cannot be underestimated. For years, he racked up Emmy Awards (seventeen in total!) for his work profiling dance on PBS's programs ""Dance in America"" and ""Live from Lincoln Center."" It is Ardolino's finesse in guiding Ralph Bode's cinematography that sets this ""Nutcracker"" apart from others - in particular Carroll Ballard's 1986 film of Pacific Northwest Ballet's version and the recent San Francisco Ballet release (which, though beautiful in its own right, is marred by insensitive camera angles). Ardolino understands ballet and understands what a dance audience looks for. As a result, we get some gorgeous shots that are perfectly framed that maintain a respectful distance from the dancers. Oftentimes in dance films, we get so many close ups and odd camera angles it is impossible to get a holistic feel for the dance. Not so in this case.

The actual production has never looked better. Rouben Ter-Arutunian's set designs are absolutely stunning up close and, although Barbara Karinska's costumes are somewhat old-fashioned (including some rather heavy tutus for the Waltz of the Snowflakes scene), they have a nostalgic, stately charm. Jessica Lynn-Cohen is a surprisingly mature Marie. Her performance is nuanced and fully conceived. I wish I could say the same for her co-star, Macauley Culkin as the Nutcracker, in an odd example of stunt-casting. His performance is comparatively stilted and awkward. This would be perfectly serviceable in a stage production, but up close on film, it doesn't pass muster. Thankfully, his time on screen is relatively limited.

This production was filmed just before the New York City Ballet's status as a ""Balanchine company"" began to wane somewhere in the mid-1990s (although some would attest this happened earlier). Thus, we get to see some performances that represent the zenith of the company's potential. Darcy Kistler exhibits fleet, elegant precision as the Sugar Plum Fairy. Her Pas de Deux with Damian Woetzel (who has since gone on to become a formidable dance director and lecturer) is breathtaking. Kyra Nichols gives an exhilarating, powerful performance as the Dew Drop leading the Waltz of the Flowers. Bart Robinson Cook plays a delightful Drosselmeyer (a role which Balanchine played himself in the early years). Likewise, the way the corps throw themselves into numbers like the Waltz of the Snowflakes and Waltz of the Flowers is unparalleled.

All that said, the true star of the show is still Balanchine's sensitive choreography. With the libretto being so bare bones, it is up to the choreographer to make or break this ballet. Here, we get an atmosphere of warmth and love in the Act I party scene, a detailed master class in expressive movement. Utilizing only mime and gesture, Balanchine imbues every character onstage with a distinct personality and place in the action. (Credit must also be given to the talented students of the School of American Ballet.) Also palpable is the familial air of the Stahlbaum household, exemplified in a brilliant and sweet entr'acte that Balanchine interpolates between the party and battle scenes (utilizing music cut from Tchaikovsky's ""The Sleeping Beauty"") in which Marie's worried mother (played by the lovely Heather Watts) comes looking for her daughter who has fallen asleep by the Christmas tree. After the narrative subsides and the dancing takes over, the corps numbers become organic extensions of Tchaikovsky's brilliant music. In fact, with Balanchine, the dancers become embodiments of the music - this is especially the case with the Waltz of the Flowers closing the divertissement of Act II. Just seeing the melodic patterns work themselves out through the dancers is breathtaking. Speaking of the music, Tchaikovsky's score gets a wonderful, sensitive performance here from David Zinman and the New York City Ballet Orchestra.

  This is a well done ballet with some very good dancing even from the children. Macaulay Caulkin sometimes turns me off with that smirk of his, however. One can tell that these children are well trained, especially the Marie character.

The computer animation is also another turnoff as it lacks the spontaneity of a live performance with audience reaction. It goes down as a spectacle instead of a performance.

So it was startling to watch Emilio Ardolino's film version of George Balanchine's THE NUTCRACKER (1993) on videocassette and just adore it.  The sets and costumes, by Rouben Ter-Arutunian, use color to perfection.  The Tschaikovsky music is glorious.  And the dancing, by the New York Ballet, is outstanding.  I could even follow the story with just Susan Cooper's minimal narrative read by Kevin Kline.  It is a great ensemble cast, and Macauley Culkin fits in nicely as the Nutcracker Prince.  Bart Robinson Cook as Godfather Drosselmeier is magnificent, and newcomer Jessica Lynn Cohen is enchanting as Marie.

I clearly don't have a lot of experience in stage NUTCRACKER's, or any live ballet.  A NUTCRACKER expert may pan it for something.  Leonard Maltin asininely called it ""much too stagey""!  Leonard, they call it filmed ballet!  Of course, it is stagey!  And this 1993 production is as good as ballet gets for me.

I'm trying to get the ones who think ballet is stupid to find it interesting, and grainy film does not help!!!!) and also because the parts of the children in the story are actually danced by children.  It makes it more authentic and childlike, which a child's fairy tale story should be!  Plus, I know my students would be distracted by Baryshnikov's (and the other male dancers' in his version) very prominent shiny ""package""; I am not in any way a prude, but when a ballet is meant to be shown to children, who are easily distracted by details, it would be more appropriate to choose costumes that aren't quite so ""crotch-tacular.""

She followed it easily, with a few explanations from me, and was in awe of the dancing and actors.  She talked about it all night before bed and even waking up in her sleep and talking about it.  I think it is an excellent way to introduce fine music and ballet to children at a young age so that they can understand it and appreciate it, rather than limiting your child to just the traditional children's music that is out there; which is fine, but this exposure to dance and music and creativity and imagination will allow them to use other methods of thinking.

601668,5,6303224407,"Was Balanchine the most imaginative choreographer of the 20th

Century?

I think so.

How many of us have seen the Nutcracker ? Since it is such a staple and so popular with community and school groups, I would say that a huge percentage of us have seen it in one form or another.

But I don't think anyone has put together a more creative, magical version than Balanchine.

There are many Nutcracker DVDs available, many different approaches to the piece, but this is the one that I like best.

This film is a fairly exact, expanded for film, version of the stage production that the NYC Ballet puts on stage for about 6 weeks each year during the holiday season. Although the Balanchine version is now 50 years old, it is still fresh and endlessly entertaining.

Although the first act can often be uninteresting with so much of it being pantomime, Balanchine treats the two lead children as the main players. Balanchine wisely casts Marie/Masha/Clara

(the girl has different names in different versions) as a child rather than have an adult ballerina play the role. Most ballerinas can't stand the close scrutiny and tend to look ridiculous as a child. Perhaps the only exception here is the latest Royal Ballet version with Alina Cojocaru, if any ballerina has the looks and charm of a little girl, she has.

But this version is spoiled with Anthony Dowell's fussy, hammy Drosselmeyer. Some one needs to take that cape away from him, he fiddles and swirls it endlessly.

Back to Balanchine. I don't think there has been any version of the mouse fight that is more fun. I love how the mice cheer from the sidelines as the King Mouse seems to be winning the battle with the soldiers.

All the adult dancers are very effective in their roles and again Balanchine's great imagination comes into play with the wonderful staging of the Act 2 divertissments in the Land of the Sweets.

Just a few quibbles. I can understand the logic of casting Macaulay Culkin as the young prince with his box office draw. But he is the single biggest flaw here. The young prince has been done far less self consciously by other children from the SAB.

Balanchine painstakingly recreated the young prince's famous mime scene in Act 2 where he describes so beautifully the battle scene with the mice. As a child, Balanchine knew this from the early 20th century Kirov production under what was still the Imperial Russian Era. In the theater this scene has tremendous effect , the children in the audience inevitably break into cheers.

Here Caulkin does the mime in a fuzzy, sloppy , unmusical manner. This blunts the impact of one of the major scenes. He also lacks the grace of movement needed here.

Also, although I'm sure the effect was to open up the ballet for film, I dislike the bed flying through the air as the children leave the house and go into the snowy forest. The effect is somewhat cheesy, the directer should have stayed closer to the stage version where the house vanishes and the children walk immediately into the forest where the snow starts falling. It's a magical effect that is missing here.

Still, let me not appear to quibble too much. This is a wonderful DVD and both adults and children will enjoy it immensely",1109376000,6,3222,4.676106194690266
601669,5,6303224407,"I saw George Ballachine's Nutcracker when I was in high school back in the late 60's!!! It was an unforgetable experience in the theater. I'll never forget how enthralling it was to see the Christmas tree growing accompanied by Tchaikovsky's incredible music. It could be argued persuasively that it is the finest staging of the work ever conceived. I've not seen one to equal it!

This DVD is a beautiful document of the classic production. No expense has been spared in bringing the production to life. The costumes and the sets are as I remember them. A few sections have been done by ILM to enhance the video presentation of essentially a stage work. The ballet flows beautifully. Video quality is excellent; vibrant colors and clear picture unlike alot of ballet videos.

The dancing couldn't be finer. The cast is attractive and energetic including the children. The presence of Mr. Culkin does not detract at all from the quality of the performance. He's there to help sell the thing and he is just fine.

The NYC Ballet Orchestra has been playing this score for decades and their mastery of it under Zinman's baton is evident throughout. This is simply gorgeously played and rivals any other Nutcacker played by world class orchestras.

A benefit to the proceedings is the fact that Zinman is conducting an actual balletic performance and his zippy tempi add just the right amount of panache. It is a very transparent reading and makes Tchaikovsky's delicious orchestrations sound like a shiny new car! The dancer's tempi doesn't mean that there is a lack of ""symphonic"" presence. The recording engineers have done a beautiful job in capturing the majesty of the performance as well.

If you love the Nutcracker, this DVD is essential. We are fortunate to have Balanchine's masterpiece so beautifully documented for posterity! This is the perfect holiday gift to introduce young people to this glorious work of art!",1100476800,8,1923,4.959627329192546

601671,4,6303224407,"If you have a young child who wants to see the Nutcracker at home, this is the version to buy (I bought it for my 3 year old boy who loved the ballet):  Here are its selling points and comments on some previous remarks
1.  There really aren't that many versions out there.  Baryshnikov's is not a very child friendly version.  Yes it's true, this does not have the precision of some of the other corps but this version is really geared to young children.  And it's a great version for them to see.
2.  It is a plus that it features many child dancers.  It allows children to see others like them dancing.  Additionally, a big bonus is that there are acutally boys dancing male parts - parents of boys who love ballet like myself will appreciate this.
3.  Yes, Culkinis a bad dancer but as someone else noted - if it  helps sell the movie, then it gets ballet out to more people which is a plus (I personally think it's better than a Barbie doll version of Swan Lake).  Again, for parents of boy dancers, it's nice to see a boy with a real dancing part.
4.  The main character is called Marie because that's her name in the original book by ETA Hoffman (which by the way, is a VERY different story from the one we traditionally see in the ballet.  It's a great book and for a special treat of the video performance of the real story see the Milwaukee Orchestra's Notes Alive: The Nutcracker:  The Untold Story, based on Maurice Sendak's illustrations).  In the original story, Clara is one of Marie's dolls.
5.  I did not find Culkin's expressions to be disinterested or bored.  To the contrary, I was impressed with  his focus and respect throughout the show.  There is a nice photo text book that accompanies this video.  The book explains that the expression on his face early in the show may be his attempt to show that he is different, more refined, than the other more boisterous boys at the party including Fritz, Marie's brother.",1085616000,24,1936,4.430594900849858

However, the second half is very good. Darci Kistler is incredible at her age, and Damian Woetzel does some magnificent jumps and a superb turn section. Kyra Nichols' triple pirouettes are perfect, and Tom Gold radiates energy as the candy-cane.

601724,4,6303224407,"I can easily give this DVD four stars- maybe even five in time. This tale is interesting to dissect, because there are apparently two camps for this very famous, 110 year-old ballet: those who like it as a children's story and those who like it as an adult's. It's been staged both ways in the past, as others have already mentioned (and I won't repeat here, I promise). This version, which allows the kids to be front and center, has some stellar 'adult' moments in it: the Act 1 finale dance of the snowflakes, while not adult in content, is the personification of sophistication and beauty with its ice-blue lighting and costuming and multiracial corps de ballet. A beautiful sequence of dance which stands on its own, and which you'd enjoy replaying. The other moment comes in the second act, when the relatively innocent dances of various sweets give way to the Arabian solo of Wendy Whelan. The pink-and-purple lighting, the floating camera work, and the dancer's sexy, serpent-like movements (jeeez!!) do not resemble any other moment in this already polished film, and one can't help but think that either the director or the choreographer wanted it that way. (It's like watching Ann Reinking, Vicki Frederick, or Carol Haney on the Broadway stage.) As far as Macaulay Culkin- it didn't bother me since he was the right age (12) at the time of filming, and, frankly, he looks bored in *most* films he's in.

601729,5,6303224407,"All things considered, I have to say that this is quite an enjoyable theatrical presentation of Balanchine's ""The Nutcracker.""  Looking at ""the show"" itself, its most rave-worthy characteristic is how well the team of Peter Martins (ballet master), Emile Ardolino (director) and Ralf Bode (cinematographer) collaborated to actually ""choreograph the camera"" to the movements of the performers.  Thanks to a talented movie crew and an incredible amount of consideration given to viewing angles (read the description in the disc's ""special features""), the TV always seemed to be showing exactly what I wanted to look at on the stage.  Add in some nice work by Industrial Light & Magic, decent narration, and a top-notch production team, and the result is a superb presentation.
From a performance standpoint, I'd give this an A-minus mainly because the versions of ""The Nutcracker"" I've seen most often cast the Nutcracker Prince in a much more active role dancewise.  Still, everyone else did a fantastic job.  Noteworthy were the Pas de Deux by the Cavalier (Damian Woetzel) and Sugarplum Fairy (Darci Kistler), and the powerful dance presence of Coffee (Wendy Whelan).  The other ""Sweets"" performed very well also.  So long as you try not to picture Macaulay Culkin as a ballet dancer, you'll be okay.  Let's face it:  you can't expect the little guy to measure up next to the NYC Ballet, but he is there to add a little star appeal and possibly sell ballet to your kids (which may not be a bad idea).  Nuff said.  By the way, the younger performers from the School of American Ballet were wonderful.
Regarding disc features, the DVD has some cool stuff to offer:  two viewing formats, 30-scene index, and some good production notes regarding the history of the show, camera choreography and description of ILM's special effects.",1010102400,170,1829,5.039867109634551
601730,3,6303224407,"There is little to criticise the dancers in this beautiful production.  The use of children, often absent in other productions, brings the brilliant show closer to an important audience: the children themselves.  The music is good enough that it isn't distracting, although a little more rubato would have been appropriate, particularly in the waltz.
George Luca's special effects are extremely well done, leaving the first-time viewers convinced that these effects can actually be done on stage (they weren't)
I said there is little to criticise the dancers.  Macaulay Culkin cannot be described as one of the dancers and he can't dance, walk, or even move in the manner dancers do.  The producer deserves the bulk of the criticism for selecting him.  He just can't dance.  George Ballanchine must be rolling in his grave.  If someone who can actually dance played the nutcracker's part, my rating would have been 5 stars.",989280000,20,923,5.113333333333333
601731,4,6303224407,"... this was pretty good. I bought it so my girlfriend and i could watch it, because it was always something on our ""to do"" list. Well, i have to admit, it was entertaining. I'd never seen the play or heard about the story, so the content was very fresh to me. The musical score is, of course, very solid, and the extras on the DVD are also good to flip through. I like to know the historical background of stuff like this, so the extras did a very good job on those terms.

NOW I HAVE REVIEWED OVER 300 Christmas MOVIES. I HAVE NO AGENDA. I AM FARE.

The director of ""Dirty Dancing"" could have done a better job in filming this production. The is not the first feature film to showcase the world's most beloved ballet.

This is a huge chore to watch this interpretation of the holiday classic ballet! The Nutcracker tells the story of a young girl whose love for a toy turns it into the handsome prince Macaulay Culkin (""Richie Rich,"" ""Home Alone""), and together they are brought to the Land of Sweets, where an enchanting spectacle awaits them. Directed by Academy Award-winner Emile Ardolino (""Sister Act,"" ""Dirty Dancing"") and narrated by Academy Award-winner Kevin Kline (""Dave,"" ""A Fish Called Wanda"").

The lack of closeups and static shots hinder the viewer from fulling embracing it.  The 1986 Nutcracker: The Motion Picture is a better viewing experience!",1509235200,2,1123,4.894736842105263
