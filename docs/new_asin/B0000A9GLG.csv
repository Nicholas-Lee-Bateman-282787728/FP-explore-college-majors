7996676,4,B0000A9GLG,"This was an episode of a show, that ran one some premium channel in the 90's. In this format, it was packaged as a stand alone movie. The series revolved around a mysterious remote that when pointed at someone, sends their libido through the roof. So yeah, not a deep political thinker.

The fun starts when a man gives the remote to the episode's ""protagonist"" essentially a low level political whip. He charges our ""hero"" with doing some good with it. So our hero proceeds to blackmail every politician on the planet and sexy sexy hijinks ensue.

like I said, not a deep thinker, I bought it because I'm a huge Jacqueline Lovell fan, who plays a token scumbag reporter on this. And as usual is the highlight of this otherwise laughable movie. Still if you're a Lovell fan, it's worth a look.",1440547200,,793,4.538461538461538
7996677,1,B0000A9GLG,"There is a fair share of solid erotica to be found on this unrated version, with particular note going to a single but tantilizing sequence in a movie theater with porn star Tatiana, and two very stimulating scenes involving video vixen Jacqueline Lovell.  The story is sometimes humorous, always cheesy, and if not for the DVD packaging I might actually have given this film a better rating.  Now for the incredible negatives on this DVD package.  There is no menu.  I mean, there is no menu!  No scene selection, no promotional features, nothing.  The DVD starts immediately with two previews then follows the feature presentation as if it was being shown on VHS.  The picture quality is fine, and the sound is passable, but to have to watch the film from beginning to end in one sitting is ridiculous!  What if I can't watch the whole thing at once?  There is no scene selection, so by the time I want to view the DVD again, picking up where I left off, I will have to fast forward through the previews and on through the film until I find the last scene I saw.  What if I want to watch a particular scene again?  I would have to fast forward to get there.  Oh, but that's not all!  In this unrated version, whenever an uncut scene unfolds a subtitle appears at the bottom of the screen that reads: ""For Screening Purposes Only.""  It stays there for the duration of the scene.  Not only is this distracting from the torrid action, the words are so large that they often obscure parts I would like to see in full.  The film itself is fine with some scorching sequences worthy of every man's full attention, but the packaging is completely undesirable.  Don't pick up this edition...unless you love to fast forward.  This DVD is ridiculous!",1094169600,12,1741,4.543408360128617
7996678,3,B0000A9GLG,"Do you remember the movie back in 1989, ""The Turn On,"" when a mad scientist uses a special remote control to turn on women? I'm sure some of you remember. After eleven years later another sequal came out called, ""The Ultimate Attraction.""
""Sex, Lies, and Politics"" is the third installation of ""The Turn On."" This story involves money, power, seduction, and a man named ""Ron Slick"" who loves to use the remote control on beautiful women when they least expect it, such as Congress Woman during her conference, a sexy reporter during a newscast, and so on so on.
I'll give it three stars for the effort. There are total of 6 installations of ""The Turn On."" Well, three down and three more to go. It took a long time for each movie to come out. By the time the last one becomes available, a decade will pass, and we'll all be ten years older.",1079481600,16,840,4.425806451612903
