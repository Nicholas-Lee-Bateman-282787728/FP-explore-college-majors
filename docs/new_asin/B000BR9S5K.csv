8091442,5,B000BR9S5K,"In Volume 6 of Kyo Kara Maoh the story takes a serious turn and leaves the cuteness behind. With some of the best episodes of the series yet we learn more about Hube and Conrad's backgrounds. We also learn one of the main reasons why Conrad cares so much for Yuri. In the last episode of this volume Yuri finds himself called back from the human world by enemies of the Demon Kingdom. Unlike in previous episodes there is a real feeling of danger for our heros and we learn the hard way that they are not invincible. Also, in an excellent turn of events, Yuri finds himself not the only person transported to the Demon Kingdom. If you were beginning to find that the story of this series was becoming too cute and sweet, you will be happy to know that the story gets back on track with this volume.",1143244800,8,798,4.291390728476821
