2784048,1,B000NVIGA2,"I purchased this novela a while ago.  Recently I had plenty of time to sit down and watch the novela.  Disc 1 Side A played fine.  Then I flipped the disc over for Side B, hit play and then the picture started to freeze and skip.  I checked the other discs and clearly visible on the discs are scratch and scuff marks. I checked the Amazon reviews on this product and many reviews mention the scratch marks on the discs. I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing the product but I didn't.  Clearly a lesson learned! I contacted Amazon to inform them about the product.  The associate I spoke with reassured me that the replacement they will send will be free of scratches and scuffs.  The associate told me that Amazon takes the reviews customers post seriously.  So the problem with the discs should be fixed.  Ok, so I waited for the replacement, it came and low and behold scratches and scuffs on the discs again!!!  Once again, I called Amazon and told them discs are scratched and scuffed. Amazon credited my account.  I do not want another replacement of the novela because it would not correct the problem.  The problem is how the discs are packaged.  The discs (8) are laid on top of each other and the plastic in which the disc lays, has a ridge that scratches and scuffs the next disc.  Very poor packaging!  I suggested to the associate that this novela be removed until the maker of this product corrects the packaging problem.  Do not purchase!!",1351814400,,1464,4.509505703422053
2784049,2,B000NVIGA2,"This telenovela is a complete waste of time and money. I painfully endured the entire first DVD, and it completeley failed to grab my attention. This story takes place during a Mexican civil war, which I believe goes on thru the entire production. I'm a huge fan of Barbara Mori, but this is one of her early days telenovelas, when she was a young girl starting her acting career. Her acting, as well as that of the other actors, is terrible. Very dissappointed.",1342483200,,462,4.578313253012048
2784050,2,B000NVIGA2,"I hoped to get this telenovela for language practice purposes, but I can't really utilize it.

Many of the DVDs arrive badly scratched and scuffed from the packaging. It seems that it's a recurrent issue as the seller had to issue me a full refund because ALL the other NEW copies they had of it were in bad condition to.

It's nice that this is the entire the series rather than a chopped compilation, but really sad that they had to mess up the manufacturing in the process.....",1326758400,,480,4.443181818181818
2784051,1,B000NVIGA2,This is the worst DVD I have ever purchased. I was induced to acquire it by the number of stars it had. But actuallyI don't think it deserves even one. It is a very disgusting mexican telenovela extremely light and absurd. I feel very upset.,1270771200,,241,4.377777777777778
2784052,2,B000NVIGA2,first disc was informative but boring. did anyone have the problem i had?  end of first disc second side ended when azul came back after being kidnapped and believed dead but rejected by her farher thinking she had been raped and would be shunned by society.  disc 2 starts with azul in fine clothing with a fine man at her side & no explanation or surprise to town people or to her now x-boyfriend now with a lady on his arm. azul's x-boyfriend now appears to be doing very well in wine business considering in the last disc he was a poor unkept man. what happened? how did everyone find out and accept her return?  and so on.... and so on....other plots appear to have jumped in time with no explanation. i have not rated this because i cannot continue without the missing time in the story.,1265328000,,793,4.380952380952381
2784053,5,B000NVIGA2,"I was looking for something else on amazon.com when ""AZUL TEQUILA"" came up,
I couldn't take the name and image off my mind for about a week.............
........I bought it and I have to tell you it is one of the best and emotional
love story.....ever.....If you are like me and like country, farm, authentic Mexican traditions and costumes you will fall in love with this Telenovela. The only thing I didn't like about it is that it has no English subtitles I am Brazilian and speak fluent Portuguese and Spanish but my husband is American, he doesn't speak Spanish and one of our favorite romantic thing to do besides going out to eat and plan for vacations is watch TV toghether...........I had to watch the whole telenovela (48+ hours) without him...........................
.................................Anyway I have to confess that I had a really cozy and homey time doing so.",1257897600,,886,4.993243243243243
2784054,1,B000NVIGA2,"I was not able to watch it till the end. First I thought after while it would get interesting but, unfortunately, the war never ended and finally I gave up. I love Barbara Mori, she is brilliant in Rubi and in My Brother's Wife (la mujer de mi hermano), she is pretty in Azul Tequila as well, but the story is awful. And also I have to mention that DVD quality also is very bad. So if you want the story that will catch your eye don't buy this.",1239753600,2,444,4.0
2784055,5,B000NVIGA2,"I have been looking for Telenovelas that were not the summarized edited versions which are mostly what there is on Amazon and retail outlets. I found this one and purchased it.

AZUL Tequila was excellent; we watched the 40 hour telenovela over several weeks and were hooked. The telenovela is so well done, I found the acting for the most part to be excellent and the story riveting. The photography and music were also beautiful.

Note: This Telenovela does not have captions either in Spanish or English, so you would need a decent command of Spanish to follow the story and the dialog. Fortunately that was not an issue for us.

Message to the Telenovela studios:
Please notice that there is a huge market for Telenovelas complete versions. Please make them available and we will buy them, don't you want to make money??

Inmportant note regarding the DVD packaging:
The DVD packaging for this product is badly designed so that it damages the DVDs in it , scratches them. So the first thing you should do when the DVDs arrive is take all the discs out of the DVD packaging to avoid any further damage to the discs.",1237939200,7,1118,4.6313131313131315
2784056,5,B000NVIGA2,"This telenovela is awesome. All my friends in Germany spent many hours remembering our past thru this historical dramatic novel. One chapter after the other you could feel the passion of those days in tandem with the smell of country. Agave Azul burst my heart with memories, five stars it is not enough. By the way Mr. Mauricio is an outstanding actor but the administrator of the Hacienda that hung himself, should be in hollywood!!",1233964800,,434,4.8
2784057,5,B000NVIGA2,"Azul Tequila is a great novela and definately worth viewing.  I watch and study novelas as a spanish student and I have seen them all. This one is fantastic quality. Though there are no english subtitles, the dialogue is interesting and clearly spoken for those of intermediate level spanish. The background music is excellent also, well placed and not annoying like so many other poorly edited novelas. This is a full-length novela without missing scenes. If you are going to own only 5 novelas in your library this should probably fill the #1 slot. Highly recommended.",1227312000,,570,4.9375
2784068,5,B000NVIGA2,"I have a passion for Spanish Drama, but this DVD has no English Subtitles.  So I (not being Spanish) had to make up what they were saying...still all the same ""He loves me, he loves me not"" stuff, but would have appreciated Amazon.com reporting that the DVD had no subtitle features in their description of it.",1225670400,,310,4.535714285714286
2784069,5,B000NVIGA2,"I Love Azul Tequila, I live in Australi and it is very hard to get any latin novelas here and well this was just the best specially since is not cut ohhh just love it they have done a great job.",1222732800,,194,3.7560975609756095
2784070,5,B000NVIGA2,"This is a love story in the true tradition of telenovelas, long on love scenes and fight scenes, short on subtlety. However, as a student learning Spanish I thought this was great entertainment. Although there are no English subtitles, the story is easy enough to follow and the Spanish is spoken clearly. I grew weary of the cat and mouse nature of the relationship between Azul and Santiago - will they ever find each other? - but it is entertaining and the costumes and scenery are spectacular. After nearly 48 hours of following the love story lines, the ending seemed to come rather abruptly - I would have liked a little more detail and more follow up after the hours I had invested in following the characters. The five stars is for the story but I had serious problems with the discs. They are packaged so that they rub against each other causing visible scratches. Two of them would not play at all, but Amazon was great about replacing them. Just be sure to test each side of each disc before the 30 day replacement deadline. Also note that unlike most discs the label (which is almost impossible to read) refers to the actual side of the disc you are looking at. I did not realize this and played Disc 1 side 2 first, not realizing it was the second side. Also, my player could not identify the chapter, the time played or the time remaining, so stopping and restarting at the same place was a real pain. Overall I am very happy I bought it and may even watch it again someday.",1212451200,22,1488,4.454212454212454
2784071,5,B000NVIGA2,Azul Tequila is a treat for all telenovela viewers. The best part is that it is unedited and all the secondary plots and actors are included. The setting  and acting are superb. I highly recommend this purchase. It is a bargain. Only 24 dollars for 48 hours of entertainment.,1207440000,,275,4.612244897959184
2784072,4,B000NVIGA2,"I immediately purchased Azul Tequila because it was the first advertised Telenovela I saw that included the complete version of the soap opera. When I finally received it, I quickly inserted the first disk and wasn't able to stop watching once I started.  It is truly a wonderful story and the price is worth every penny.  Unfortunately, the overall picture quality is terrible as some of the DVDs do not show very well.

I'm not sure if it was just my copy, but in the middle of watching the second DVD, the story was interrupted by static for about 25 minutes.  After forwarding through the static, the picture finally came back on and I was able to catch up with the story after watching a couple more scenes.  When I watched the next few DVDs, everthing seemed to be fine until I inserted the very last DVD.  The DVD started cutting in and out again.  I tried fast forwarding, but when the picture came back it was jumping like an old VHS tape.  Lines were constantly going across the screen and I was unable to see the final ending.

Almost all telenovelas end the same with weddings and happy endings.  Don't get me wrong, I was pissed at the time; but I eventually realized that overall it was an excellent telenovela.  I decided to purchase another copy from another seller to see if I'd get better luck.  Once I receive it, I will send an updated review.",1200096000,,1363,4.473684210526316
2784073,4,B000NVIGA2,"I like this movie- I love costume dramas and enjoy telenovelas as a chance to work on my Spanish skills. The filming is good, the storyline interesting. Of course it could be edited down to a much shorter version, but I enjoy getting a lot of bang for my buck- there is a lot of movie to watch! As I am watching it it is growing on me more and more- I am only on the second DVD. I would also highly recommend Alborada (I think that was how it's spelled) It's a GREAT costume drama, and has english subtitles.",1197072000,,508,4.09
2784074,5,B000NVIGA2,"This is by far, the best telenovela. I couldn't stop watching it, very addictive. the best is 48 HOURS!!!!!!!!! I hope they make more like these! Barbara Mori and Mauricio Ochman are amazing, the chemistry they share is powerful!
very good telenovela, great story and very romantic :)",1193702400,,284,4.9375

2784076,5,B000NVIGA2,I have not stopped watching since I started!!! And I have never fast fwd the telenovela. It has a great story line and quite romantic. I would do it all over again if I had to. Barbara Mori is great and whilst the cd were scratched here and there because of its packaging it was not much of a dissapointment. I am sure if you wish to purchase this item and you are a telenovela lover like I am then you will enjoy it!!,1187827200,,418,3.988095238095238

8181677,5,B000NVIGA2,"Excellent story but there is no subtitle! However, the Spanish is clearly spoken and someone with beginning Spanish will easily be able to follow the storyline.  Note that the DVD box is missing discs 1&2 which is about chapters 1-17.  I contacted Amazon and customer service was very responsive in replacing the DVD boxset, but the replacements had the same problem (missing discs 1&2).  I finally gave up and went to YouTube to watch chapters 1-17!  I highly recommend this telenovela for those who enjoy fictional historical drama. The costumes are beautiful!",1440633600,,562,5.076086956521739

8181680,1,B000NVIGA2,"I gave this only a one-star rating because I didn't have an option of giving it a ZERO rating. Why didn't I follow the advice of others who rated this before I bought it? Guess I thought this stuff doesn't happen to me. DVDs inside looked like someone dragged them around a paved parking lot several times before putting them in a broken DVD box.

Come on, Amazon, you are looking at delivering products using drones, you successfully run an advanced business computer system, and your efficient business model has put just about everyone else out of business, but you can't take basic medieval technology and pack something more carefully in a box? Even the Dead Sea Scrolls, packaged over 2000 years ago in home-made clay jars, came out in better shape than the DVDs you sent me. Read the similar complaints about this and do something about it.",1399507200,2,847,4.684563758389261
