3849849,5,B0025X4PAQ,"Years after Andy Griffith left his own show, he portrayed District Attorney Victor Worheide in the NBC Series, ""Fatal Vision,"" based on the true crime involving Jeffrey MacDonald, who brutally killed his preganant wife and two daughters. After the premiere of that TV movie, Andy received such splendid reviews on his portrayal, that another network felt he would be perfect in a lawyer-based series of his own. The character, Ben Matlock, with his pale blue-gray suits and down-to-earth manner, was a true characteristic of the DA he had portrayed in Fatal Vision. The series is a winner, and each Matlock case holds my interest, even though I have seen them numerous times before. Andy Griffith was a true legend - a wonderful actor, a great musician, and a true gentleman. There is no one like him and we are all the poorer that he is no longer with us. I am thankful I have this series so I am able to bring him back to life - even if it is only on the screen.",1376611200,2,964,4.514285714285714

That includes the so-called comedies (both live and animated) and even the game shows (many clues on Jeopardy have been leaning way Left or presented by way-Left celebrities and politicians). The reality shows are stupidly unreal with a mercenary goal. Fortunately, Amazon sells many of the wholesome old TV series from when TV was rated G for everyone and whether a comedy or drama their purposes seemed more to entertain than to indoctrinate or promote an agenda.",1366156800,2,609,4.922330097087379

3849873,4,B0025X4PAQ,"Most of these shows are murder mysteries.  You witness the murder, but the perpetrator is not revealed.  An arrest is quickly made, but what if they are innocent?  To provide justice for the accused, Atlanta's most notable defense counselors are found in the offices of the small law firm of Matlock & Matlock. . . .

If you have been accused of a murder, then Benjamin L. Matlock is your best shot at exoneration.

Ben's associate is Miss Michelle Thomas, and in most cases, she will be questioning other suspects and she will sit on your left at trial.  She is a capable lawyer.  Occasionally, young Alex Winthrop may perform her role.  He is a little wet behind the ears, but he is dedicated and, with Ben in the lead, you need not worry.

In some cases Ben will employ a private investigator, Mr. Tyler Hudson, to tail suspects, infiltrate suspect businesses or groups, and do special and sometimes unpleasant tasks such as digging up a dead horse.  Tyler is a real pro, a risk-taker, and he never shirks the most dangerous of situations.

Now, when you go to court, the prosecuting attorney may be Miss Julie March.  She is one of Georgia's most able district attorneys.  You be may be alarmed to learn that Julie and Ben are strongly attracted to each other, but they never let that interfere with their professional conduct at the trial.

Ben Matlock may look like an old country lawyer, with a passion for strumming his guitar, collecting rare coins, repairing his own boots, and an insatiable appetite for hot dogs, but he will prove to the jury that there is ""reasonable doubt"" that you are guilty.  Ben is just the lawyer to get justice for you. . . .

3849884,5,B0025X4PAQ,"I have always enjoyed watching the classic Andy Griffith Show with Andy Griffith as the mild-mannered sheriff Andy Taylor along with his bumbling and lovable deputy, Barney Fife.  This was truly one of the great comedy teams of all time.  In 1986, Andy Griffith returned to series television playing the country lawyer, Ben Matlock.  The first two seasons were filled with comedy, mystery, and good courtroom drama.  In the third season, Don Knotts joined the cast in the recurring role of Les Calhoun, Ben's neighbor.  What a thrill it was to see these two comic geniuses together again on television.  This made the third season a must for my DVD collection.

One episode to note is the season premiere, ""The Lemon,"" where Les purchases a used car from a not-so-honest dealer and then gets framed for his murder.  Of course, Matlock has to defend him.  Les also makes memorable appearances in more episodes such as ""The D.J.,"" ""The Black Widow,"" and ""The Psychic.""  There were also many intriguing mysteries written for this season like ""The Captain,"" ""The Other Woman, ""The Model,"" ""The Blues Singer,"" and ""The Priest.""

The third season of Matlock is a must for any fan of Andy Griffith, Don Knotts, or just good dramatic mystery stories.",1252540800,28,1242,4.894736842105263
