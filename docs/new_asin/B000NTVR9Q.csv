8181312,5,B000NTVR9Q,"Simply timeless, ""Adventures in Odyssey"" continues to entertain and educate children on godly character decade after decade. I remember listening to the show on 88.5FM KLJC. Twenty years later, not only do I enjoy listening to ""Adventures in Odyssey"" with my own daughter, but we also enjoy watching the cartoon together. ""Race to Freedom"" is an epic tale that children will enjoy for years to come.",1357948800,,399,5.0606060606060606
