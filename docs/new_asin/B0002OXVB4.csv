8030027,4,B0002OXVB4,"Sam Elliot will always remain one of my all time favorite American actors.  He's so believable in his role as the angry cop.  I must comment on the back jacket of the cd as the person who wrote the brief description of the movie puts the scene in NYC!  The movie location is actually in California, San Francisco, I believe.  Anyway, another great cop movie what leaves the viewer wanting for more.  Didn't like the ending.",1438300800,,423,4.5131578947368425
8030028,5,B0002OXVB4,Sam Elliot is a wonderful actor the other two are preaty good ones too. I like the guy on NYC Blue he is the best one they have had for that part. But can not figuar out hoew they excpect us to believe that these stupid people who can not figuar out how to make a case.,1387238400,,269,3.736842105263158
8030029,5,B0002OXVB4,I gave this as a gift so i do not know if it is good are bad but with Sam Elliot in it i think it will be good!,1354924800,,111,2.8620689655172415
8030030,1,B0002OXVB4,"Good title.  Throughout I felt like I was watching a dog of a movie.  Instead of good writing and subtle acting for character development, we get sledgehammer stereotypes.  The script had all the finesse of a gumshoe story found in the sleeziest of porno mags.  Even the walking of the actors seemed a gorilla-like off-balanced hyper-macho strutting.  EVERYTHING was repeatedly over the top!!!  One reviwer gave it 4 stars and called it a sleeper.  Well, the only sleeper in the room was me, trying to stay awake to watch this flick.  The music was too loud and 1940-ish sax to hear the actors, whose enacted states of mind seldom be discerned from their statements and voice intonations.  UInteraction effects were grossly absent.  The actors seemed like robots that took a moment to scan their hard drives after the other guy did or said something i order for them to determine what they had to do next-- as if each actor knew only his/her own lines, and each seemed constantly caught by surprise that the previous speaker had finished speaking.  Overacting was abundant.  This film seemed to have been made as a drama school exercise.  And the Mike Hammer type music playing off on its own kept grating on my nerves.  It was almost as if each element and part had been recoreded independently in a booth somewhere and then put together after-the-fact.  Handgun shots sounded like Howitzers.  Breathing was also loud as hell.  What a mess.  Sorry to say all this, but it seemed to have been done by these actors just so as to pick up a couple of bucks and then get the hell out of there as fast as they could.  I hate talking this way about someone's work, but the filmmakers seemed to have no concern for the viewer-- or the poor fool who actually went out of his way to purchase this disaster.",1345334400,,1797,4.59433962264151
8030031,3,B0002OXVB4,"I really like Sam Elliott and that voice!  The movie was ok, but I really like Sam Elliott (did I mention that voice!)  Does he do the tough guy role great? Any other type of role just wouldn't do.",1265932800,,197,4.0256410256410255
8030032,1,B0002OXVB4,"Don't know what the movie ended up being like, the language was too filthy so we just stopped it.",1263340800,,97,4.157894736842105
8030033,3,B0002OXVB4,I love elliot especially in his cop roles.  This is great as he plays a pissed-off cop who bitches about life & kicks the crap out of everyone.  A great guy movie,1220140800,,162,4.03125
8030034,4,B0002OXVB4,"This is a sleeper indeed, well worth your attention.  While the script
is somewhat lacking, the direction and acting are superb!  Elliot has
never been better; Esai Morales is credible and straight forward; and
the supporting cast, including Paul Sorvino, are spot on.  In the crime
genre, it's a more realistic look than we're often afforded in terms of
the police world.  And some of the scenes are unsparingly honest in
portraying a cop's difficult life as he maneauvers a morass of morality
and illusions -- some his own, some not of his making.  Well worth
watching!",1208304000,11,571,4.845360824742268
8030035,3,B0002OXVB4,"This production never quite overcomes its straight-to-video quality, but it's well cast -- even in the smaller parts -- and sticks to its plot in an efficient though unimaginative way. Praise goes to the writers and director, as well as to Sam Elliott himself, for refusing to make Elliott's character likeable or ""misunderstood."" Also thanks for giving Elliott a bare-chest scene. Even at age 51 (or thereabouts) he still looks good when he strips to the waist and shows off a torso that's never been subjected to a make-up artist's razor.",1151625600,6,540,4.945054945054945
