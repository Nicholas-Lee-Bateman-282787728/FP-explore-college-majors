3819805,5,B001V7YZD4,Midsomer Murders 13 contains all the episodes from other 'bits' - I received Midsomer Murders 12 and found to my dismay that these episodes are exactly the same as series 9 - what a rip off!,1252368000,5,190,4.305555555555555
3819806,4,B001V7YZD4,"This is more a message to the fans of Midsomer Murders in The USA who get tired of having to wait almost two years after the show is broadcast to see it on DVD.

First the big review.....These episodes are as wonderful as all the previous shows. The ability of the writers to keep up the quality is nothing short of amazing. What a track record. Whoa!

Now the boring message...these episodes were released on dvd in the UK in September 2008. The entire TEN EPISODES of that season were released as ""The Sixth Collection"" You can buy it from Amazon UK for about $70 including shipping. This USA release has only four of those episodes issued one year later at about $36.

The one catch here is the UK releases are on the region 2 PAL format which will not play on a lot of the USA region 1 dvd players. BUT you can buy a dvd player that will play the region 2 PAL format right here on Amazon. I did.

Series Note....John Nettles will be retiring at the end of 2010 with one final series of eight episodes. With the way Acorn chops up these programs into little three and four episode packages for the USA it will be 2012 before we get to see any of them.",1250812800,49,1154,4.208144796380091
3819807,5,B001V7YZD4,"For those new to this British masterpiece, Midsomer Murders is a long running ""who done it"", based on the novels of Caroline Graham, starring John Nettles (of the Bergerac fame) as the unflappable Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby. The series is set in the fictional Misomer County, which comprises of many cosy, rural villages, where wealthy and poor alike seem to do each other in at an average rate of three to four bodies per episode. The series has a worldwide following, not in the least due to the creative and macabre ways in which the MM victims are typically dispatched. I give the series as a whole a five star rating, though set 12 was a bit dissapointing (four stars) in that it lacked some of its trademark British humour which in the past acted as a buffer between the viewer and the grim reality of the bloody murders... Let's hope Set 13 sees MM back to its best form!

Set 13 contains the following episodes:

ep 52: Dance With the Dead; orig air date: Nov 2006
ep 53: The Animal Within;  orig air date: Jan 2007
ep 54: King's Crystal;  orig air date: Jan 2007
ep 55: The Axeman Cometh;  orig air date: Feb 2007

SPOILER ALERT!!!: In The Axeman Cometh we meet Simon, Cully's intended. Her wedding is in ep 60 (which I guess will be in set 15). END OF SPOILER ALERT!!!

If you own any MM sets from Region 2, you may already own at least some of the above episodes, as the Region 1 and 2 sets are NOT synchronised. Better check... I read somewhere there were fewer MM episodes released in the US in order to keep the price of each set more affordable. If that was indeed the case, then it is a great shame... I would like to see those missing episodes released at some point in the US as well.

PS: As a side note, John Nettles is retiring soon, though we should see Barnaby episodes well into 2011. The makers are still shopping for a suitable lead who will pick up the baton. All they will confirm is that Barnaby will NOT be killed off, and that his current sidekick (played by Jason Hugh) is NOT in the running. The actress playing Cully has already retired from MM (her last episode was shown on British TV this summer; it was her character's wedding episode).

UPDATE (Feb 10, 2010): Nettles' replacement has been revealed. I have included the details in Set 16 review.",1248048000,75,2291,4.409952606635071

3819853,5,B001V7YZD4,"As a long time Midsomer Murders fan, I had been looking for a good British series. The entireity of the series is exceptionally good and entertaining. New characters are introduced, and it did not take long to welcome them. In fact, Every well known English actor has appeared at least once in this series. It made the last of the series a little more exciting. I was given this series from a pal in the UK

John Nettles is Barnaby and Daniel Casey is his DS. Barnaby is thinking if retiring. He is young with city experience and wonders if country life will suit him. However, he is more than willing to give it a try. Badgers Drift is the scene, and there seem to be more murders than necessary. The mysteries and murders continue. We meet some of the families of all involved. All of the episodes are well done and entertaining. And the last episode, well..wait and see.

We've just about finished this collection and look forward to settling into a mystery with detective Barnaby. It's nice to find a main character with a ""normal"", happy family life. The characters are a bit quirky. The plots are intricate and have a definite English twist to them, which makes it nice for something different from our American series (which we also enjoy). Very entertaining!
The only drawback is that every now and then we get a disk that sticks. I hate to miss any of the stories due to this. Still giving it 5 stars because we enjoy the series so much.",1411171200,,643,4.649122807017544

3819940,5,B001V7YZD4,"This is a great season and I relished every moment as I knew John Nettles was quitting with this season and letting another actor carry on as of season fourteen. I can't imagine this show without him.  He has been the  anchor to the whole series. Besides, this also makes his wife and daughter unnecessary as well and they were vital too.

These final Nettles' episodes are terrific.  As usual, we have idyllic English settings and gatherings where the grisliest murders intrude. One episode is set in Brighton, a seaside town famous as a retreat for the ton of the regency during the summers. Nowadays going to the beach and the rides adjacent to it are where most of the action occurs. So naturally a guy gets his head cut off in the haunted house.

Another episode involves Tom and Joyce going to rest at a spa.  So, of course, the bodies start piling up shortly after they check in.  Joyce encounters the first body when she enters an isolation tank. It is a real hoot seeing Tom trying to relax at a spa.

Another episode shows a Wild West show going on in a bucolic English village setting.  This is enormously popular and the villagers even belong year long to wild west societies based on the American old West.  They build fake saloons, have shootouts between Billy the Kid and the marshall, and so forth. We think of the Brits as anti guns but this is not true in these villages with the country sporting life accent.  EVERYONE owns a shotgun and uses it regularly.

Tom retires in the final episode of this season and his cousin, John Barnaby, a DCI from Brighton, steps into his job.

I saw the Midsomer series listed on Amazon and based on the synopsis, took a chance. We love them! The actors are marvelous, the casting brilliant. The scripts/stories are all different and well written and the scenery is beautiful. The mythical town with its wonderful shops and houses, the uniquely individual inhabitants are something we just don't see in productions here. The acting in even the smallest role is outstanding.
John Nettles, the lead, settled into character with the very first show and is absolutely brilliant as the stern detective with a strong sense of justice, a good sense of humor. His love and affection for his family lights up his eyes during even the most difficult case. It is nice to see.

3819946,3,B001V7YZD4,"I have watched most of the earlier series. But, I found this series to be a bit boring, especially ""Dance with the Dead"" and ""The Axeman Cometh"". There was very little in the investigation of the murder and too much of what I call filler. Somewhat disappointing.",1268524800,,262,4.595744680851064
3819947,5,B001V7YZD4,"For anyone who enjoys good murder mysteries in the English style, this series is a two thumbs up. I'm a huge Agatha Christie fan, and I think this series is worthy of her. Caroline Graham was the original author of five of the series early episodes based on her books. The rest are delightfully clever. The most original part of the Midsomer Murders is Detective Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby who is a happily married man with a grown daughter. His interaction with his family and his assistant is completely lacking the angst usually associated with police dramas. It makes this a thoroughly enjoyable series.

I've never bought a TV series before, but American television has stopped showing the Midsommer Murders. The stories are intricately written, the conclusions are logical, the acting is first rate, and the body count doesn't stop at one. The English country settings are both quaint and surprising. I'm sure no English village ever had so much mayhem visited upon them in real life.

Even the violence is kept to a shadowy minimum. Like Agatha Christie, the violence is mostly implied, and the audience only sees the aftermath, hears the noise, or sees the movement of a weapon. Tom Barnaby treats every suspect and witness with sensitivity and respect, but doesn't allow the perpetrator to escape justice.

This is actually good family fare -- basically PG13 -- and a pleasant way to spend an afternoon. So, prepare a big bowl of buttered popcorn, settle in on the sofa or your favorite chair, and enjoy a remarkable story. Make room for Tom Barnaby, Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot.

I recommend this series for any mystery buff.",1267660800,,1639,4.884892086330935
3819948,4,B001V7YZD4,"I have all the previous DVDs of this series and I absolutely love them.  Set 13 however was a different animal!  I noticed that the series has now taken on a rather 'free and easy' tone that I didn't notice in other episodes.  For instance, in one of the episodes a man stands in a bar hollering a word I, personally find offensive and I'm not used to having this kind of thing happen in any of the other sets of this series.

Overall, it's always a treat to see Barnaby and Jones (although I equally liked his previous two sidekicks, Troy & Scott).  I would just issue a slight heads up for those of you used to a bit less 'modern' words and scenes, if you will.",1266969600,,663,4.1484375

Barnaby and his three police co-horts are so entertaining and the back story of his wife Joyce and daughter Cully only makes him more amusing and human.  Despite the short lifespan of the residents there, we would love to live in Midsomer villages!",1266451200,,468,4.5476190476190474
3819951,5,B001V7YZD4,"If you are familiar with the series, you will understand that more of the same is a good thing to say about this latest release.  Your favorite cast of characters return to provide yet another good performance.  British actors bring a certain sense of ""quirkiness"" that Americans seldom get to see.  The series provides a fresh perspective to solving murder mysteries as compared to its US counterparts.

We now have all 13 Sets of ""Midsomer Murders"" and they are the best of any of the British Murder Mystery series.

This not dark and moody like the majority of British Mysteries, the characters are excellent. The actors bring the characters to life in an enjoyable and realistic way, that makes them appear real.

The plots have many twists and turns with very unusual and surprising outcomes.

The locations chosen as the settings of each episode allows the viewer the chance to see the extremely beautiful countryside, homes, and villages of rural England.

We have view each DVD at least twice and some more than twice.

We have seen every one of them and were so excited that more were coming out.  This is our Saturday afternoon, grab a bowl of popcorn, and when that familiar theme music starts, it is so relaxing to watch. There is no foul language or car chases.  It is just a mystery movie that always keeps you guessing.  I was so glad to be able to get this set from Amazon, and have already ordered the next set.

One of the things we like about this series is...Inspector Barnaby and his wife have a great relationship, and their daughter doesn't have emotional issues...etc., due to her father being a policeman. Nor do we have to suffer through 45-60 minutes of heavy gunfire between police and crooks, horrible car chases that destroy half of a city as we do with American crime shows.

I am therefore reluctant to buy sets without knowing if those sets contain episodes I haven't seen, as it would be a waste of my money to buy sets containing episodes I've already seen. Does anyone else have this problem, and if so how do you deal with it in deciding what sets to order. Is there a reason a summary of the episodes can't be lsited in the amazon entries for each set?

is a weak plot every once in awhile it,s so far superior to what
we can see over here. I didn't particularly like, the episode:
The Axeman Cometh. I could hardly make heads or tails of it.

'how it ends'. So bought the set which had the episode Dance With the Dead...I must have missed that one in regular broadcasts. The other three were familiar but still engaging in crisp, clear imagery. Plus! you can speed forward or backward if you want to revisit some nuance that may have passed by. A simple observation I know;  but after a year or two one can watch them all over again at one's leisure as if one never saw them before. Of course you have to know what you are getting as far as the shows go. It is already 10 years after the original broadcast.
