8614519,1,B00000F993,"This video was quite a disappointment.  This video appears to be just a half hour episode of something that was supposed to run on tv or may have in the past.  What is quite disappointing about it was that the majority of the 30 minutes was spent talking about sailboats.  The end had a little section about windsurfing ,I think right after the segment on tying knots, but it was very basic and the boards and sails were really old stuff.  It gets at least one star because of the historical value of it.  Basically if you have ever gone windsurfing before you won't learn anything new.  If you have ever seen a windsurfing video of any type you won't be seeing anything new.  This is certainly not a video to wow you by any stretch of the imagination.",994723200,10,752,4.366906474820144
