8638143,5,B00I0WR6UW,"On 11/24/2014, Manga Entertainment released Dragon Ball: Season 5 in the UK 4 years after the Remastered US release by Funimation Entertainment. This Remastered Season set is not the same as the US release from 2010, because it's actually a re-release of the older DVD releases of Dragon Ball: Piccolo Jr. Saga Part 1 and 2 (2003) and this time there are 31 episodes on 4 discs otherwise known as the conclusion to the Dragon Ball anime.
If you look at the pictures, it's actually another yellow brick on a jumbo DVD case not to be confused with the DBZ Dragon Boxes, DVD cover sleeve is also reversible.
I love how Manga Entertainment does with their PAL Anime sets in packaging cooler than Funimation's region 1 releases.
However, the video quality is not remastered but the same as the TV broadcast from Fuji TV or Cartoon Network's Toonami, otherwise you've already seen it on the 2003 Piccolo Jr. DVDs.
As far as I know, the DVD menu is actually the same as the Australian Region 4 releases by Madman entertainment sometime in the early 2000s. Still there are no next episode previews on any of its Funimation or Manga Entertainment releases.

And that's how the Dragon Ball Remastered sets should've looked like on Region 1, especially the original Dragon Ball logo you see on the package just like in the opening anime song, Makafushigi Adventure.

Well the story continues after the battle between Son Goku and King Piccolo, and there's more going on before training for the next tournament.",1439337600,,1499,4.783783783783784
