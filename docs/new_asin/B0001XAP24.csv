2042189,5,B0001XAP24,"Life is one big party for los hermanos Morales; Jose (Pedro Infante), and Luis (Antonio Badu) get a reputation as ""un par de escandalosos"" as they go from town to town, and from fiesta to fiesta, seducing the girls, and getting  the male population very upset. They get tripped up, when they come to the town where Don Carlos Salvatierra is Mayor, and Don Carlos tricks them into thinking they're coming to town as celebrities. The Mayor meets them with a mariachi band, and deftly escorts them into a comfy prison cell, decorated with a large and threatening portrait of their mother. What follows is a hilarious romantic romp, with fast pacing and a sharp, witty script, that will keep you entertained from start to finish.

The cast is superb, with Infante and Badu once again making a great team (they made ""El Gavilan Pollero"" the previous year), and Andres Soler marvelous as Don Carlos. Irma Dorantes and Carmelita Gonzalez are funny and sassy as Don Carlos' daughter Maria and and her friend Gloria (""las dos Rositas""), and Emma Roldan is the much feared Maria Morales (""quien manda, manda!""). Directed by Fernando de Fuentes, and with music by Manuel Esperon, there are lots of songs, and it's hard not to get misty eyed while listening to Infante's superb rendition of Jose Alfredo Jimenez' beautiful and melodic ""Corazon, Corazon."" This is one of the best of Infante's romantic comedies, and will delight his fans, which still number in the millions, 50 years after his untimely death, by crashing his plane near Merida, in the Yucatan. The film quality is only slightly deteriorated (you'll be laughing so much you won't notice it) and there are no subtitles available.",1176336000,5,1681,4.874125874125874

8017747,5,B0001XAP24,"His fellow Mexicans like to say he didn't die: Pedro NO est muerto!  His spirit and incredible charisma, wit and beautiful voice certainly didn't; but I would point out that Pedro, who died --IF he died -- in the crash of a self-piloted plane at age 40, will/would be 100 years old in 2017.  His movies are products of the late 1940s through 1957, the Golden Age of Mexican Film.)

The only Pedro movies with English subtitles are Los Tres Huastecos and Los Tres Garcia and its sequel, Vuelven Los Garcia.

I love Los Hijos de Maria Morales and most of Pedro's other movies (wonderful, carefree, mostly ""singing cowboy"" style) and I love his voice and music. I'd recommend the hilarious book by New Mexican Denise Chavez to his English-speaking fans... although it's probably more fun for women, a ""chick book"", about a handful of southern New Mexico Hispanic women and their romantic woes who belong to a chapter of the Pedro Infante Fan Club, who get together regularly for ""meetings"" to re-watch his movies, and using the movie Pedro as a reference point in their own lives.",1444867200,,1077,4.712765957446808
