7910456,4,B00000ICUG,"This set contains the last episodes of Diana Riggs' reign as Emma Peel. The episodes are not the best but even the worst episodes in this season by far out do anything else on tv then amnd maybe even now, The episodes are The Positive Negative Man it is easy to follow and could use more Steed and Peel interplay, Murdersville is the most interesting and fun episode definitely was back to the quirky basics for the show. Mission Improbable is not the best idea but Patrick Macnee saves it with a funny and tongue and cheek performance. Forget Me Knot is the last for Diana Rigg and the first for Tara King played by Linda Thornson. The set is worth it for this episode alone. The transfers are solid and the show is one of a kind not likely to ever be done again.",1364515200,,764,4.275862068965517
7910457,5,B00000ICUG,I can't get enough of the British style of mystery.  If that's what you're looking for these super sleuths fill the bill.,1363305600,,121,4.5
7910458,5,B00000ICUG,"This is a wonderful old British TV series but buy the TWO volume set for a better deal:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Avengers-67-Set-4-Vols-7-8/dp/630529996X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Avengers '67 - Set 4, Vols. 7 & 8</a>

You can check out my full review of each episode there as well as my other more general comments about the series. Be aware that this volume includes FOUR episodes instead of the usual three which includes Mrs. Peel's ""farewell"" and the introduction of Tara King, (played by Linda Thorson), as Steed's new partner!

Also, be aware that when you buy the TWO volume set, it comes with an additional cardboard (very nice) packaging case to hold together the two Plastic DVD cases in one unit. This cardboard packaging has all the details of both DVDs on the outside.",1211846400,,837,5.423076923076923
7910459,5,B00000ICUG,"Set 4, Volume 8 contains 4 episodes of the series. ""Mission Highly Improbable"" is highly inferior to the other 3. Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg are both espionage veterans via this British TV series as well as appearing subsequently in ""A View To A Kill"" and ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" respectively. As we see Mrs. Peel make her exit, enter Tara King played by the highly overlooked Linda Thorson in ""The Forget-Me-Knot"". Electrifying ""The Positive-Negative Man"" is reminiscent of an animated ""Batman"" episode. Zap! ""Murdersville"" is very good and offbeat and leaves the viewer curiously paranoiac. Good luck, Mrs. Peel! I hope see more of Tara soon.",972345600,,657,5.092592592592593
