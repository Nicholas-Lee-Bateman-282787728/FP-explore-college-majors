564314,5,6303092020,"This is one of my favorite Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau movies. It is up there with the Fortune Cookie and other great ones.

Sadly this movie was never released in DVD. It needs to be.

Walter has really acted brilliantly here as a crusty professional assassin who keeps getting fouled up by the incompetent suicide attempter (Jack Lemmon).",1150416000,11,343,4.796610169491525
564315,5,6303092020,"With all the junk that comes out weekly on DVD, you would think that a comic masterpiece  with Jack and Walther would be out and in the stores by now.  Matthau is brilliant as a hitman, very funny.",1136246400,10,197,4.157894736842105
564316,5,6303092020,"I can't believe some of the crap film companies are releasing on DVD while Buddy Buddy isn't available on DVD format yet (even worse: this film is out of stock on VHS!!!!!!)

Do it at least as a Jack Lemmon tribute, for crying out loud!!!!!",1130284800,32,240,4.333333333333333
564317,5,6303092020,This nice comedy must be released on DVD ( please wide creen ). I hope we don't have to wait very long.,1106092800,21,103,3.727272727272727
564318,5,6303092020,"is there any better jack lemmon/walter matthau movie than ""buddy buddy""? maybe yes, but this is still a splendid performance from both of them.
victor clooney (jack lemmon) is a suicide attempter who manages to appear in trabucco's (walter matthau) life at the wrong time and with each meeting becomes more and more annoying. while trabucco tries to finish a contract before retiring as a hit man clooney thinks that his life isn't worth living any more because of problems with his wife.
i really liked the movie because it's a funny but not ""standard"" comedy. once i've been told that we laugh when things are true. though i never met a suicide attempter while i tried to shoot someone, the main story (meeting someone annoying at the time you really needn't) served me a lot of laughs and i can just recommend this movie to those who like to laugh while watching a movie (and - of course - to other lemmon/matthau or billy wilder fans).",980812800,24,939,4.62874251497006

564679,4,6303092020,"This is not considered Jack Lemmon's and Walter Matthau's best film but it is one of my favorites. This DVD is, as far as I can tell at this time, the only legal copy of the film you can purchase not on VHS. For any English speaking viewers reading this, there is an English audio track if you do not want to listen to the movie in Spanish.  The DVD is in a PAL format, which is non-standard for the United States. If you are in the US or another DVD Region 1 country you will need a PAL compatible DVD or BlueRay player or you will need PAL compatible DVD software.  I have found that the current Mac OSX DVD player has no problem with PAL.  For Windows users you will need the current VLC or similar DVD software.

I watched the DVD on my MAC, which is plugged into my 42"" LCD TV via a DVI cable. The video was smooth but fuzzy and lacked fine detail, also colors were muted.  It was not any worse than watching on an older non-flat screen TV but is a noticeable when compared to more recent movies that were encoded in the last few years.  The DVD has none of the extraneous material most modern DVD's and and BlueRay disk's have.  There is no Director's commentary or making of, just the movie.  And best of all, no previews. Just pop the movie in and hit play.",1312070400,3,1265,4.134693877551021
564680,2,6303092020,"Out of date movie but kind of funny  It wasn't as good as I remembered and the tape I bought was not in good shape,  so I had lines running through middle of movie  I think this movie was not a good choice for these two,  All though on Paper it looks good  years later when they did grumper old men  was much better,  Not as good as fortune Cookie",1311379200,,347,3.8714285714285714
564681,5,6303092020,"Two of America's finest comeday actors in possibly their finest performance and THEY WONT RELEASE IT ON DVD?????????

This is a fantistically and histerically funny movie. Walter Mattau is trying to assasinate a witness from a hotel room while Jack Lemmon is trying to kill himself in the next room. You can figure the rest.",1310774400,8,324,4.890909090909091
564682,3,6303092020,"I love this movie,one of the best of these two actors projects together,however this spanish release is only ok,sound is mono no problem,but picture is 2.35,which even on a 37 inch tv like I have it`s a bit tight to watch,why the film industry does not use the standard blu ray widescreen of 2.40 on everything is a pain,however my vhs copy had already worn out the left channel,so this dvd is still miles better,if you want an old style laugh then get this film,much better than alot of new so could comadies,why the us and uk dvd firm`s will not put out a proper release is a crime.",1308873600,,584,4.36697247706422
564683,4,6303092020,I saw this movie years ago and wanted it as a gift for a friend. Netflix didn't have it! so... I found it on Amazon from a private seller. It was pricey but the giftee was delighted. Very typical Lemmon/Mathau movie from that era. Not there best work but worth watching.,1300406400,3,270,4.313725490196078
564684,4,6303092020,"I was also searching this film for some time now. Have seen it on TV once in French and enjoyed greatly -and I really wanted to see it again. However, once I had the opportunity to see it on DVD, I did not have the same impression of entertainment or fun. Anyway, my watching mood should not reduce its qualities. I recommend it as a relatively fun film, an entertaining plot but could have done certainly better (for ex. Peter Sellers in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Party/dp/B00005JKH9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Party</a>).

Final recommendation:
No need to spend more than necessary if you're still in search of this DVD. It costs really high and the art work at the end, does not worth that much.",1294012800,,755,5.34453781512605
564685,5,6303092020,"I have been searching for this movie for years and finally found it. It's a great comedy starring Jack Lemmon who has been ditched by his second wife and is on his way to see her to try and patch things up and when she tells him it's over he tries all sorts of ways to kill himself and poor Walter is trying to assassinate an informant and keeps getting interrupted by jack lemmon's antics.

564686,1,6303092020,"Even Billy Wilder disowned his Americanized version of the hilarious French comedy ""L'Emmerdeur"" (1973). The legendary director's final collaboration with screenwriter I.A.L. Diamond resulted in this notorious stink bomb. Almost entirely set-bound, ""Buddy Buddy"" (1981) is a desperate farce that garners no laughs - despite the seemingly sure-fire presence of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. Rarely have such gifted comic actors been so relentlessly unfunny. Since Wilder's celluloid disasters were few, it is better to ignore this depressing swan song and remember the brilliance of his earlier work.",1278115200,2,601,5.840909090909091
564687,5,6303092020,This is a Lemmon-Matthau classic.  This rates equal if not better the the grumpy old men flicks.  Jack Lemmon is one of the best actors of all time and Matthau is superb as well.  I can't understand how this is not available on DVD.,1197417600,9,232,4.2272727272727275
7838205,3,6303092020,"I think this was a good movie, but it's not without its plot holes.  Matthau and Lemmon are always good together and fun to watch.  Matthau does a bit of cursing (but coming from him it's art) and there's some minor nudity.  A solid 3.5 stars.",1518652800,,243,4.239130434782608

7838211,2,6303092020,"Am a huge fan of Director Billy Wilder - I count nearly a dozen films he created amongst some of my all-time favorites. More so when he worked with frequent collaborator and fellow Oscar winner Jack Lemmon. And adding perennial curmudgeon Walter Matthau into the mix - what one expected from this trio of historic talents should've been pure magic.

This effort from 1981 produced pure crap.

A nearly worthless comedy that proves that putting together an all-star team doesn't necessarily equate to success.

I'm heartbroken to write this review since, as I said, Billy Wilder is one of my favorite filmmakers.

'Buddy, Buddy' would be Wilder's final directorial effort - and it was obvious that he had reached the twilight of his amazing career; one that started in 1929 as a junior writer for Warner Brothers. His cinematic journey began just as the ""Talkies"" were being introduced to an eager public; suddenly words began to matter. And oh what a way Billy Wilder had with words!

But even for a creative master - 50 years a long time.

In this production he tells the tale of two incongruent men whose paths cross one fateful afternoon in a small Arizona town.

Both are seeking death.

One is a depressed jilted husband looking to commit suicide, the other a contract hitman on his final assignment.

The latter is Mr. Trabucco. He's finally saved up enough money to get out the business.  An independent contractor, he's found a small tropical island where he's going to spend his golden years away from the messiness of murder-for-hire. He's ready for this. Been ready for years. This last job will top off his retirement account.

The former is Mr. Clooney. A desperate husband on a quest to retrieve his wife from a sex cult. But, failing that, he's decided that life isn't worth living. He's going to sacrifice himself on the altar of their failed marriage.

As both men travel to the county seat, they discover that they share adjacent rooms in the same hotel - one because it offers a perfect view for a scoped long-rifle, the other because it's perfectly suited for any number avenues of self-inflicted harm, from hanging oneself to a serious case of height-induced cement poisoning.

What Trabucco needs is quiet solitude. No attention. No distractions. One shot and he's sipping Mai Tais on a tropical beach. But his accidental neighbor's desperate and maniacal actions are bringing everyone within earshot to pay attention. The assassin is now forced to befriend, support, and if necessary, facilitate the broken couple's reconciliation.

But he's on a deadline - literally. Time passes quickly and he needs to get back to his room and make the kill shot.

Torn between vanishing Mr. Clooney in the desert or helping him straighten his life out - will he be able to complete his assignment?

Wow, I wanted so much for this movie to work. <smh>

Overall, I can't recommend this film for anything other than to cross it off one's cinematic list of Director Wilder's filmography, or to checkmark another Lemmon/Matthau team-up.",1409616000,3,3041,4.87378640776699
7838212,3,6303092020,"Tha last films of Billy Wilder, and this was the  last one, were not as good as many others that he made, but I love this man, and with this movie I almost complete my B:B: collection, there is only one I need to buy that's Fedora, but at the moment, I can't afford  it.",1406073600,,270,3.890909090909091
7838213,3,6303092020,"The movie is hilarious, but I'm not going to discuss that.  This review is about the DVD release, not the movie.

It is nice that ""Buddy Buddy"" is finally out on DVD.  It's unfortunate that this is a Region 2 DVD so you need a multi-region player to be able to watch it.

On the plus side, the picture quality is reasonably good, and the sound is also reasonably good.

On the minus side, this is not an anamorphic transfer.  This means that, on a 16:9 TV, the picture is small; it fills only about 60% of the screen.  I didn't try it on an old format 4:3 TV so I can't report on it.  If you don't mind the ""microscopic"" size picture, you'll be OK.

There are no English subtitles.",1400716800,2,681,4.137404580152672
