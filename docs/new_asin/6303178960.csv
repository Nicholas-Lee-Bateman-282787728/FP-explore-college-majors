596341,3,6303178960,"Sort of a comedy family western with kids, a singer (Charlotte Ross)  and a woman gun fighter.
The Indians are good and kind, the terrible mountain man is a kind hearted hermit and the fake Indians are the stage robbers.
The best part of this movie is the singing by Charlotte Ross.
Otherwise the movie is a pretty boring and predictable adventure
family western.",1231459200,2,363,4.671875
596342,3,6303178960,"Not bad, not good.  This movie has basement-level production values, including mono sound, mono music.  There are in fact no stars in this movie, but that's okay.

In this movie, the Indians save the white people, the women save the men, the Black man saves the white man.  Such is the age we live in.  The trouble is that you know this is what is going to happen, even though you don't know exactly how.

The rescue at the end is not particularly exciting or especially inventive, and is over very quickly.

Whoever wrote the script had no idea what he was doing.  The story is much too short and had to be padded and stretched to fill the available time.  And the padding used was talk.  This is a ""talky"".  That would be okay, if the talk had something going for it.  It doesn't.  It's pedestrian, off-the-shelf, generic.

Still, it does have a story: people take stage, stage is attacked, people walk, people are attacked, people are rescued.  Curtain.

There are so many good movies out there, of every genre.  You can certainly find a better one than this.

Not recommended.",1184630400,13,1080,4.536458333333333

Featuring an all-star cast and great production values, it's no surprise that critics and audiences have made this a major word-of-mouth best seller!  Check it out!",1121731200,,307,5.51063829787234
