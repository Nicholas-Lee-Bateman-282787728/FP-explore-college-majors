Just like the other movies mentioned, this one is pretty much the same, maybe a scene or two with a bit of a chuckle, but for the most part it's an instantly forgettable waste of time of bad jokes, failed sketches and skits that could have worked had they been 30 seconds long, and not a whole segment in itself.

Fans of Seinfeld's Newman might be surprised to see him as one of the stars of the movie... lol, who are we kidding, he doesn't have fans, he's souley known as Newman and the fat guy who caused the Dinosaurs to get free in Jurassic Park. Apart form him, there is pretty much no known faces. The whole thing plays out like it's a new program with commercial breaks, but you can obviously figure that out from the title. It's over filled with gratuitous nudity... which ya know, as a guy, it kept me watching, but in the end does not make me rate this thing any higher than it's worthy of being rated.

By the way, unlike other reviewers, I'm not going to over rate this thing just because it brought back a found 1985 memory, nor do I live by some unwritten law that anything not converted to DVD yet must mean it's a rare gem yet to be rediscovered... even the second hand VHS copies are going cheap, so yeah, don't over hype whats not worth hyping... Mortal Kombat II is no longer available on DVD, but you'd be out of your mind to consider it a collectable now and buy it for more than the price of the CD it's burned onto.

If you do wanna check this thing out, it's on the ole Y, you know, the Y that sounds like a U with something that rhymes with boob after it. Go check it out on there so you don't waste any time buying or looking too hard for this thing. Cause in the end, you came, you saw, you'll never be back again.",1404345600,,2014,4.119592875318066
8032649,5,B0002VAZ4S,"i can understand why this comedy is NOT on dvd yet.it is diplomatically written,
it is also underhandedly racist,which i think is ironically funny! though anybody possessing a real brain knows racism is the crown jewel of ignorance,which i laugh at. i rented this film in the early 1990's behind the west covina mall at tower records.my state of mind back then(at 17 yrs) was borderline racist and very homophobic and anti-semitic(considering i am half russian/jewish).today i'm the polar opposite concerning racism homophobia and anti-semitism.i admit i only watch my copy of this film occasionally(three or four times a year)at best.

THIS MOVIE IS A MUCH IGNORED UNDERRATED CLASSIC FOR A RIP-OFF OF THE
KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE. THOUGH NOT NEARLY AS, FUNNY!!!",1272067200,,758,5.213114754098361

8032651,2,B0002VAZ4S,"If THE SEX O'CLOCK NEWS is remembered at all these days, it's for the first credited big screen appearance of Wayne Knight ('Newman' on TV's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SEINFELD/dp/B000VECAEE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SEINFELD</a>).

This intelligence-insulting ""comedy"" is reminscent of another '80s poor taster, Robert Downey Sr.'s&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AMERICA/dp/6300235106/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AMERICA</a>&nbsp;(1986). Both have blackout vignettes that center around the runnng gag of a strange news show, although -this- one's far less-coherent and has infinitely more wincingly bad moments. It's the sort of picture that's best summed up by the old Henny Youngman one-liner: ""This movie wasn't released... it escaped!""

Make sure you don't watch this with someone who'll question your sanity afterward...

(Hey! Look out for porcine 'Captain Sticky' as Superman, and that familiar-sounding announcer is none other than Don Pardo!)

""Sex O'Clock News"" is NOT available on DVD (why would it be?).

Parenthetical number preceding title is an imdb viewer poll rating.

8032652,3,B0002VAZ4S,"If Kenticky Fried Movie and The Groove Tube are your idea of a purely unadulterated, raucous, hilarous good time the you'll love THE SEX O'CLOCK NEWS with its flamboyantly outrageous updates on the latest state of affairs in sexual fashions, practices and behaviors.  There's something in this movie to offend absolutely everyone!  Just under cult status, this comedy from the 80's has received the following reviews:

""Wild and off the wall..."" Pravda

""Totally gross..."" National Star

""Outrageous, irreverant, insanely funny..."" N.Y. Tibune

Long out of print, this one will most likely never see the light of DVD so grab a vhs copy if you can still find one!!",1092787200,4,663,5.092592592592593
