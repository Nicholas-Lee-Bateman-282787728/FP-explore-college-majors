2747854,1,B000MTFDF6,"I thought that maybe I would finally get a decent, un-edited copy of this movie. It's just another really bad, distorted, edited transfere. If there was a lower rating than one star, that's what  I would give it. Can I get my money back?",1196467200,22,237,4.386363636363637
2747855,2,B000MTFDF6,"I got this film for one reason. Jenny Agutter is one of the most beautiful women in the world. Anyone who disagrees should go back and see LOGAN'S RUN. Unfortunately Jenny has very little to do in this movie except look pretty, but even her great beauty if concealed most of the time.

As Italian westerns go, I suppose it is passable, but without Clint Eastwood in it, who cares. There are many westerns, even Italian westerns, that are much better. Unless you are as big a fan of Agutter as I am, chose SILVARARO or some other much better western. Or better still see Jenny Agutter in WALKABOUT or EQUUS or AMY. All of those films are better than this one.",1190937600,2,658,4.39344262295082
2747856,3,B000MTFDF6,"This is an interesting old west story mixed with a love story. The film quality isn't the best, but it is typical of the era in which it was produced.",1179705600,,150,4.033333333333333
2747857,1,B000MTFDF6,"Don't waste your time buying this DVD.  The ad says it is rated R.  However, this is the edited version with all spicy scenes completely deleted. The picture quality looks like it was filmed directly from a movie screen and is on par with a VHS tape.  You would think by now the studios would know that viewers want the unedited version of this movie.",1175472000,58,351,4.369230769230769
2747868,1,B000MTFDF6,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, but it looks like a camcorder copy, sound and picture is horrible, no sublilites, I thought it would be like the copy I saw Direct TV, how does these people get away with this crap, this is no way a copy of the original.",1389744000,,271,4.132075471698113
2747869,4,B000MTFDF6,It was great movie.  My only question was that I requested the un-cut version and nothing was said about that  was what I recieved.,1388275200,,131,4.416666666666667
2747870,4,B000MTFDF6,I had seen this movie years ago and loved the song Ronee Blakley sang throughout the movie and at the end(No more lonly nights).  Warren Oates is good in ANYTHING he's in!,1376784000,,171,4.34375

2747872,4,B000MTFDF6,"As with most disc of this movies, the soundtracks don't do justice to the good singing.  No subtitles either.  Other than that fine and inexpensive",1360972800,,147,4.84
2747873,5,B000MTFDF6,I love one actor in here. jenny Agutter. I have all her movies. if you are a fan of her's I recommend getting this movie,1353110400,,120,3.84
2747874,1,B000MTFDF6,I don't know where they got this but it was awful.  Looked like they filmed it AT a theatre with a camcorder.  Do Not buy!,1345507200,,122,3.84
2747875,3,B000MTFDF6,"It was a pretty good movie, but the copy a got was chopped or cut. There were parts that were obviously not smooth, but jumped to another scene, as if a part of he original movie was cut out.",1329264000,3,191,3.923076923076923
2747876,1,B000MTFDF6,"No censored dvd can be rated higher than one star.  As others have mentioned, the uncut version has been shown on the Encore Western channel in sd, but it has also appeared on the Encore-affiliated channel RETRO in high definition and that version is very uncensored.  DISH carries the RETRO channel, I don't know who else does.",1326931200,5,328,4.7368421052631575
2747877,1,B000MTFDF6,"this was supposed to be an unedited version of the movies, including the 2 hot love scenes. they are deleted. i wish to return this movies. very disappointed.",1318809600,2,158,4.678571428571429
2747878,1,B000MTFDF6,"I had expected the oridgeal version and i received the cut virsion 2 i mean 2times i purchased to video's and had to pay for both. I would very much like my money back. I have purchased things from Amazon in the past and have been very satisfied, NOT THIS TIME. You said it was the oridginal and it was not. MONEY BACK PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1318118400,4,340,4.328125
2747879,1,B000MTFDF6,"I wish I had read the review before buying this trash. I now have two copies of a really bad copy of the movie. I ordered this movie because it said 98 minutes. The first two I looked at were 72 & 84 minutes long. Well, The 96 minute DVD has been cut also. If you don't need it right away you'll have to record it from television. That's the only full lenth copy I've seen. If you are still reading DON'T ,DO NOT buy this DVD......",1315872000,2,431,3.9655172413793105
2747880,1,B000MTFDF6,The Leonard Maltin guide lists this film as being 102 minutes run time and all the dvd versions listed on Amazon appear to be much less...the longest one is 92 min and one is only 78 min with one other being 82 minutes.  This is a terrible rip-off of the buying public and a disgrace to the film industry in general. Try to always avoid buying films that have been cut so badly.,1297296000,5,378,4.178082191780822
2747881,1,B000MTFDF6,"This is an ultra-grainy copy of the EDITED TV version of this film!! Do NOT waste your $!!

Guess he doesn,t have the rights to this one, but I love other Monte Hellman films & wish someone would finally release a great, uncut transfer of this good film!!",1283472000,12,255,4.3125
2747882,1,B000MTFDF6,"Poorly edited tv version, not the original movie. It is only missing the commercials. These types of modified versions should be clearly flagged by AMAZON as they are fraudulent misrepresentations of the movie. Don't waste your money.",1270339200,17,234,5.351351351351352
2747883,1,B000MTFDF6,"Hate to say it, Amazon, your stuff is usually pretty good but this is the same old heavily cut version, poor quality,from some tired old VHS version, 4:3. I have a better version recorded from TV years ago, still 4:3, but apparently intact. THe cover art has nothing to do with the film. When will someone release the uncut widescreen version? Rating no stars. Had to put one in to submit this.",1265760000,3,394,4.486111111111111
2747884,1,B000MTFDF6,"This is not only a horrible print of the film from a dubious VHS copy of the movie, but it is the edited for television version of the film.  I regret buying this and would warn off any other people that may have an interest in this.  All of the nudity and violence has been excised.",1264118400,2,283,4.035714285714286
2747885,1,B000MTFDF6,"I will add a whole-hearted second to the previous three reviews and add that this is DVD is a prime example of how a widescreen or letterbox conversion can butcher a perfectly good 4x3 movie format.  This DVD-R appears to have been copied from a standard format VHS tape by enlarging the frame to obtain a letterbox width and then chopping off the bottom and/or top of the frame to achieve the widescreen effect.  The result is very noticeable, especially if you have seen the original movie or VHS tape.

This is the second Reel Classic Films DVD I have been burned on.  I will steer clear of this company in the future!",1197763200,12,621,4.469026548672566
2747886,1,B000MTFDF6,"Terrible, horrible, I may need a thesaurus to adequately describe how truly awful this copy is. There is no menu, no chapters, the sound and picture quality are extremely poor. The picture jumps and skips. I threw mine away after one viewing.",1197331200,18,242,4.785714285714286
2747887,1,B000MTFDF6,"""Caveat emptor"" means ""Let the buyer beware.""  Please beware of the following before purchasing the Reel Classic Films release of CHINA 9 LIBERTY 37.  It is a DVD-R.  It is a cut version.  It looks like the worst VHS dupe ever made.  The video is distorted.  The audio is distorted.  If it were sold at $0.01, it would be overpriced.  I purchsed it in the hope of some small improvement over the other versions on the market; I watched it with mounting rage at the gall of offering such a travesty for sale. Stay far away from this one.",1196726400,30,536,4.343434343434343

8172089,1,B000MTFDF6,The video quality of this movie is completely unwatchable and appears to be an edited for TV version rather than an unrated version. I should have read the reviews but that does not excuse selling a useless product.,1510099200,,215,4.684210526315789

So, if you are a very patient person, you can DVR their version or, perhaps contact the TCM network direct and request they offer the DVD in the on-line shop.
