This is an improvement over UFC: Best of 2011 with 25 full fights. It still bothers me that the main feature is fight highlights only as the past yearly UFC Best Ofs used to show full fights in the main feature. However, the main feature is not completely useless as it covers every UFC event in 2012 so it does give you a nice summary of UFC in 2012. While the main feature only shows highlights of fights, Ryan Jimmo vs. Anthony Perosh from UFC 149 is shown in full and Donald Ceronne vs. Melvin Guillard from UFC 150 is almost shown in full as only the first 10 seconds are edited off.

While this does have more fights than the 2011 edition, some of the choices are weird and questionable. First, there are strange omissions. Henderson vs. Edgar I, Ortiz vs Griffin III and both Anderson Silva fights from 2012 are not shown in their eintirely. Second, some of the fights that were chosen to be shown in their entirely are not featured in the Best of 2012 main feature. However, there are still great fights in this blu-ray like Chan Sung Jung vs. Dustin Poirier, George St-Pierre vs. Carlos Condit, Jon Fitch vs. Erick Silva, Diego Sanchez Vs Jake Ellenberger and the Joe Lauzon fights from 2012.

While UFC Best of 2012 is not perfect, it's still a worthy purchase for UFC fans and MMA fans in general. This blu-ray has over 6 hours of full fights and the Best of 2012 main feature is over 2 hours.",1362441600,36,3743,4.339130434782609
5509870,3,B00ATP24DM,This blu ray set is just like the 2011 version. It does not show the full fights only highlights. It comes out every week on fuel tv ch 618 (direct tv) check it out and save some money.,1360886400,8,185,3.8947368421052633

5509872,3,B00ATP24DM,"I'm a big ufc fan and when I saw this at bestbuy I had to buy it.
For the price it is a good deal, but beware!
This DVD only has 10 full fights.
There's tons of other fights that aren't full fights, only very short clips of the fight with an extremely annoying announcer talking about the fight in the background.
I only bought this so I can watch full fight, I don't want a 10 sec clip of a fight.
But apparently the blu-ray version has a lot more full fights, but I don't own a blu-ray do I'm stuck with 10 fights.
For $12 it's not a bad deal, but I would have rather paid $30 and have 30 full fights.",1371945600,,603,3.870967741935484
5509873,5,B00ATP24DM,"I'm kinda new to the world of UFC. Just to hang out, I've started to go with my friends from work to see the matches at a bar every few weeks. To my surprise, I've really begun to enjoy it! However, I don't really know all the fighters, or their history, or even some of how UFC works. So, I picked out this DVD, first, hoping it would give me a much better overview.

I absolutely loved it! Two of my friends joined me on the couch for what we thought was going to be a an hour-and-a-half of merely cool clips, but we quickly found ourselves on the edge of our cushions. This amazing highlight reel actually lasted much longer than expected (not sure how long). It felt like 3 hours, but we never wanted it to end. The three of us, with beer and pizza in hand, just sat there oooooing, ahhhhhhing and groaning with sympathy for every crunch and splat. By the end, we all had new respect for the UFC. We knew the key fighters much better and had a list of personal favorites, yet we were still hungry for more highlights!

Disk two had a bunch of ""best fights of the year,"" but we didn't necessarily enjoy them as much as the highlight reel. They were definitely some of the best fights I've seen, but these were all combatants who were perfectly matched, so they almost all went the distance. As a result, you get some of the most uncomfortably bloody matches of 2012, which was a little more gruesome than expected. (Don't worry- I'll be okay!) I was surprised at how many fights from the highlight reel got stopped after a few key shots, but with most of these *full* matches, the fighters just battered each others' faces into hamburger meat and the ref never ended the fight. When you watch nothing but matches like these, it can feel way more brutal than the UFC norm, so as a result, we all preferred the highlights way more than the complete fights.

Having watched this set, I already feel like I can talk more intelligently about the sport with my friends, and I've even started to win more free glasses of beer when we all bet on the big matches! I plan to pick up a few more of these ""Best of"" sets for my collection, so I can lend them out or pop them on the TV when we are just chillin' at my place. The three of us have been raving about Best of 2012 to our other friends and coworkers, so I'm sure we'll fill my couch when I pick up the Best of 2011!",1371340800,,2366,4.218543046357616
5509874,5,B00ATP24DM,"I love it because it was well-done, great camera coverage, fair Refereeing, well organized and great action, the real thing, pleasant and exciting to watch..
The UFC has evolved from almost total domination by the grappling arts to higher level of mixed martial arts styles.. The fighter today must be very well rounded in all aspects of the Mixed Martial Arts world to even be ranked.. No more hours of boring rolling around on the floor in the Octagon..! Thank God..!
It seems all of the top ranked fighters these days are accomplished in TaeKwon Do, and/or other striking arts, along with all the very necessary skills in the grappling arts.. My point is the narrators have not kept up with the correct terminology.. Example; in the fight between GSP and Carlos Condit 2012, to someone trained in aspects of striking arts, kicks in general, the differences between the two combatants were painfully obvious.. GPS used TaeKwon Do stile techniques while Carlos used the more restricted and less powerful kicks usually associated with the Japanese stiles.. The narrators of that fight, were clueless to the differences..? They were clueless to the proper terminology, they missed the beautiful double kick GPS used.? They also seemed to be clueless as to how the kicks were being used and to what targets..? UFC needs to up-date their narration/narrators, so they are more and more unfamiliar with the evaluation of the Mixed Martial Arts we are seeing more of today..",1369785600,4,1468,4.971544715447155
5509875,3,B00ATP24DM,"In retrospect, 2011 was a very big year for the UFC.  Not only had the company started its deal with FOX network, in terms of live events, it was also breakthrough for expansion of its pay-per-view hosts in terms of foreign countries.  Along with that we, as fans, were treated to some truly historic fights and moments such as Jon Jones having what is arguably the best year any fighter has had in the UFC, the Edgar/Maynard feud which produced not one but two fight of the year candidates, the absorption of the WEC roster, GSP/Shields playing main event to the biggest UFC crowd in history, as well as the historic Velasquez/dos Santos fight on the first FOX event to name a few.  Now, how does 2012 stack in comparison?  Well, it's a bit odd considering but 2012 may long be remembered for the fights that didn't happen, as opposed to the fights that did.  Fights like Jon Jones/Dan Henderson, St-Pierre/Diaz, Junior dos Santos/Alistair Overeem, Wanderlei Silva/Vitor Belfort, Dominick Cruz/Urijah Faber III, as well as Roy Nelson/Shane Carwin.  To say that 2012 was hurt by injuries and rescheduling is probably an understatement (Just look at what the original lineup for UFC 148 was and you may understand where I'm coming from) but let it be said that it was still filled with a number of great fights and moments.  My only problem is that some of these great fights aren't shown in their entirety in this set.

If you bought the 2011 set you know that the first disc was comprised of a highlight reel format.  This was a huge slap in the face for most fans as many of the fights that were featured were edited and chopped up so that only bits and pieces of the fight were shown (I realize I gave a full explanation for the definition of ""highlight"").  Even more troubling was the fact that of a two disc set the entire first disc was the highlight reel.  Granted the second disc had a number of amazing fights, and quick knockouts, but all that wasted space of a first disc was thrown away largely for fights that were repeated on the second disc.  Again, slap in the face.  This year the format was a little bit different.  Yes, there's still a highlight reel that takes up a large portion of the space on the first disc (Why, just why...?) but thankfully there's still some ""bonus"" fights which allow for a more even spread of fights in the collection.

For all the things that were done right on this set, which include a number of the big fights from 2012, this set still left a sour taste in my mouth.  The first, and most obvious, is the use of a highlight reel to again focus on fights, many of which are either repeated in the ""bonus fight"" section or some of which just should not be part of a ""Best of"" (Faber/Baro).  As pointed out by another reviewer many of the more obvious choices are left out for some reason such as Edgar/Henderson I, Silva/Sonnen II, Griffin/Ortiz III, as well as Silva/Bonnar.  While these fights are touched upon in the highlight reel I have a hard time understanding the need to leave out their full bouts.  Granted some of those fights were one-sided but the UFC typically doesn't stray away from such grand performances (Personally, I'd rather see Silva/Bonnar than Jones/Belfort, quicker and more entertaining).  These pretty much account to personal preferences but this is my opinion so I figured I'd just share that bit.

Another personal preference I have, which has gone unanswered since the 2008 set, is the inclusion of personal retrospect from actual fighters on memorable fights.  2008 was a set that largely had trainers and fighters talk about their own personal fights which was okay but I truly enjoyed 2007's retrospect.  Getting some insight from other fighters in the business on the kind of influence certain fights have on people is really quite interesting.  It seems that whatever company the UFC has been using for the production of their DVDs has been going without the use of behind the scenes features as of late, evident in most of the event DVDs of the current year, it seems like this will most go without happening for any future set I'm afraid.

Overall, a pretty good set of fights marred by another highlight reel which takes away from the full space that other fights could have easily been placed on in favor of for overall quality.",1369440000,3,4315,4.631233595800525
5509876,3,B00ATP24DM,"Not a big fan of only highlights. Should've had the Ortiz vs griffin, silva vs sonnen fight. Also on the bonus fights they don't show the tale of the tape. So if the fighters are guys I've never heard of then I don't know who they are (I could look at the chapter list but who wants to do that 25 times) or what weight class they're in.",1368230400,2,336,3.9558823529411766
5509877,2,B00ATP24DM,"Watching this compilation of the ""best"" fights of 2012 only reaffirmed my belief that the UFC peaked as an organization three or four years ago. Yeah there were plenty of entertaining fights in 2012, but most of the best ones were between non-contenders or various mid-level fighters. Many of the title fights sucked and the top dogs like Jon Jones and Anderson Silva were involved in a series of bouts against challengers who offered them little or no competition at all.

The fact that they included Jon Jones' fights against Rashad Evans and Vitor Belfort as two of the best fights of the year, really speaks to how desperate Zuffa is to push the big name fighters even when their actual fights were neither entertaining or competitive.  The only fight of the year that felt like a real superfight was the rematch between Cain Velasquez and Junior Dos Santos, which turned out to be a disappointingly one-sided mismatch that went the full five rounds. It was a good fight, but hardly a great one. But apparently that's how far the UFC's standards for greatness have fallen.

Also no bonus footage whatsoever is included, aside from the full fights.

The fights look great in HD...but that's about the only really positive thing I can say about this disc.",1367452800,4,1257,4.778801843317972
5509878,1,B00ATP24DM,"Great blow job AGAIN by ufc.
why?
1, NO anderson silva fights on this set.
Maybe someone can slip me a few bills while explaining why the pound for pound best fighter ever was not featured on this ""best of set"" and i will understand.
2, I seem to recall Mr Hunt had at least one sweet KO in 2012, but its not here, a lot of good quick fights are not here.
3, Those tiny little dudes, mighty mouse? i'm sorry but I'm not wasting 30 minutes of blue ray to watch you hopped up mexican jumping beans bounce around with no finish.
4, Too many second rate fights from mostly b grade fighters.
5 no bonus features, just 25 fights, several of which I don't ever plan on watching.
6, A lot of fighters on this set were dropped from the ufc in the interim. They put on some good fights, so why are they fired from the ufc? Levar was roided up and not a big mouth like Sonnen or belfort, but Sass is an excellent prospect, seems stupid to cut an up and coming brit.
I will never watch this set again.",1367020800,2,989,4.051020408163265

So i love the UFC for doing this cause it's really good. Yes, you don't get to see every fight, but just think of as you are getting a year in review, then, plus something like 'Ultimate Card' where the best fights run in their entirely in the second cd (best fights they put together but mainly have little argument).  So now the bad; The bad is that the year of 2012 didn't really have a whole lot to talk about.  There were good exciting fights, but nothing like a few years back and mostly because there are new up and comers entering the Octagon. Until the best get put with the best of them the year would kind of get a little tame until we have those grown folk fights break out again.  Over all, it's a good product, I love the year reviews at the end of the year cause like I said.. if nothing else.. and you don't order any UFCs.. then at least you can get a second disc that has full fights of some of the best fights that year and you kind of have an 'ultimate card' DVD of the year to crack open a beer to and enjoy yourself. For that, this, and the others, are always well worth the money.  You won't find the best fights anywhere else, unless you wanna pay pay per view the entire year or spend about 20 bucks and put on your own party. It's great.",1380067200,,1578,4.160655737704918
