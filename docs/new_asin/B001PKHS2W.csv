3747496,1,B001PKHS2W,"One can always hope, but expectations can be shattered so quickly. I believe one of the actors summed it up best in the deleted scenes commentary: ...""buy the American High School DVD - oh you already did suckers...""

This is a story of a SOCal high school filled with people aged 25 or older, a perverted administrative staff, including a sexist principal, a nude art teacher, a school nurse that tries to have sex with the students, and so on. Nicki Ziering gets plenty of boob time on screen, Aubrey O Day (another Playboy alum) tries to fill some lines out, and all of the guys walk around without shirts so the gals can have something to watch.

Haven't described the plot because there isn't one, but sufficed to say this film covers the last few months of a graduating class learning about life. But the way this group was written they could never have learned anything (even the lines). The deleted scenes total 20 minutes and have a built-in commentary from about six people having way too much fun laughing at themselves.

I can laugh at and love to watch corny high school/college films, but this didn't make the recommendation list. As the director said in commentary ""get the pause button ready"" when Ziering would be getting naked, obviously the reason they made the whole film.",1238803200,3,1292,4.682819383259912

3747500,1,B001PKHS2W,as unintelligent as a movie can get - thank god for fast forward - and of course not dedicated watching - something to practice guitar with but still worthless junk that got stopped soon.,1393286400,,187,4.529411764705882
3747501,1,B001PKHS2W,"Normally I enjoy movies that are ""so bad they're good"". Sigh, this aint one of em. Omg, this was so horrible I threw it in the trash. I tried giving it away but no one wanted it. I am not exaggerating. I laughed whole heartedly when American Pie came out, I still laugh at South Park, Family Guy & Robot Chicken. All I did during this movie was roll my eyes & apologize numerously to my husband for wasting the $3 spent & the 90 minutes gone from our lives forever. I don't normally bash any movie this hard but trust me when I say, I'm trying to do u, the reader, a favor. Once ur precious time is lost, it's gone forever. This was a huge waste of time.",1371081600,,654,4.038461538461538
3747502,2,B001PKHS2W,"Basically, this is one of those B rated movie with no real plot and a whole lot of nudity. Every scene has either sex, nude girl, or half nude guy. The movies tried to give the viewer a story by making the movie about the main female lead, Gwen. Gwen is basically, trying to finish up her senior year in H.S., and that's what the movie is about, but you won't understand that unless, you see almost the whole movie.

A little more about the movie. Gwen is already married to a guy and they are supposed to be in love. You have another girl trying to steal away the husband, so that she can break up the marriage. She is also Gwen's rival for everything. Gwen family isn't support of her, and in fact, they don't even like her. Also, the whole school doesn't like Gwen. There are two guys that are the clowns of the movie. They are always talking about nothing and making dumb stupid H.S. jokes. You have many staff and teachers characters trying to have sex with students throughout . The worse character is Gwen's own father trolling the school for H.S. girls. Gwen's father was some big porno star back in the day, and he also a muscle head. The female students are somehow really into that.

If you love seeing hot/nude girls with almost no story, then this is the movie for you! I found the lead female actress very attractive, while the story makes fun of her all the way. I really into girl's wearing dark make up, so that's maybe why. lol I give this movie a 2 stars for the hot leading lady.",1369872000,,1499,4.293286219081272
3747503,3,B001PKHS2W,"I think the makers of this film were trying to create their own low budject American Pie.  But-- I think they were either immature, or maybe drinking. It is not terrible by any means. But the script is uniquely surreal. I have never seen a weirder high school film. The girls are great, although they are about 25 [still in high school], but the script is all over the place. What were they thinking?",1365811200,,400,4.405405405405405
3747504,4,B001PKHS2W,Why does this movie get such bad ratings by so many people?! Like the society of people are getting more stupid by the day. This isn't a 5-star movie but damn close to it. Extremely funny movie that I could watch over and over.,1360195200,,227,4.181818181818182
3747505,1,B001PKHS2W,This DVD was a total waste of money. The very few scenes that tried to be even remotely funny...weren't. Not even the scarce display of female nudity helped this disaster.,1334620800,,171,4.733333333333333
3747506,5,B001PKHS2W,"I am a huge fan of Aubrey O'Day, I think that anything she does is genius.

This movie is clearly in a way a spoof of all the ""teenage"" movies that have come out until this movie was released. It is meant to be so stupid that it is funny.

If you have a strange sense of comedy, you will love this movie! It is worth it!",1325462400,2,320,3.7611940298507465
3747507,3,B001PKHS2W,this movie just reminds me of american pie. but cheaply made. i don't think this was a really good film. it was okay to watch once but twice no.,1287360000,,144,4.0
3747508,5,B001PKHS2W,"If you want to laugh your head off, go out and buy this movie.  If you are in the least bit depressed, if you are in the dumps with this economy, if you just broke up with your significent other, then run to get this flick.  But word of warning.  If you take this movie at face value or as in any way real, you will lose out.  But if you view it as a parody, as broad slapstick, you will love it.  It is a combination American Pie and Scrubs.  It's like Woddy Allen let loose.  It is downright dirty and silly which is part of its charm.  Director Cannon is either a comic genius or he fell into this without knowing.  (I'd love to see him work with Ben Stiller or Will Farrel - Cannon appears to have their crazy sense of humor.)  He treats all his characters the same...he makes fun of them all.  And in doing so, he is making fun of all the stupid teen sex comedies out there.  No one can be taken seriously and I think this was done on purpose. Cannon paces things well.  You are never bored.  This movie is downright silly on purpose.  The teens are bad but the adults are worse.  The principal is a sleeze bag as is all his teachers and staff. The parents are worse than the kids.  When it all ends and the smoke clears, you are left with a surrealistic comedy that is zanier than you have ever seen.  This is a very good choice for a weekend afternoon popcorn flick with your best buddies.",1250208000,2,1396,4.088560885608856
3747509,5,B001PKHS2W,"ARE YOU ENTERTAINED!?!?  this looks like a transitional movie for the disney channel audience, ween them on something that makes them cry back to mickey mouse's safe, oversized hands.  make no mistake, you will cry.  whether it be for the lack of storytelling, talentless directing, or actors that couldn't eat their way out of a paper bag, because all they know how to do is suck, and blow...no...american high school is quite possibly the ed wood jr plan 9 from outer space- of teen comedies.  it's that wonderful.  i'm waiting for the tim burton remake fifty years from now...with dakota fanning in the 'aubrey o'day' role, despite being decades too old at the time- would only add to the marvelous black hole of casting this movie employs on the viewer's senses.  american high school is that impressive.  buy it.  buy it to show young snot-nosed-punk filmmakers what they'll be doing after an american education.  and watch them cry- tears of ""unfathomable sadness"", as eric cartman of south park describes it.  an absolute gem.  crank these stars up to 11!",1250121600,3,1062,4.877094972067039
3747510,1,B001PKHS2W,"just like The Hills...but worse.

might have made an halfway decent vlog a la ""Dr. Horrible"", if it weren't for the acting, story, or production value. more than likely, the wrap party was more fun than the screening.

the eye candy however will make it worth the $3 you'll pay at the gas station for this direct to DVD stereotypical high school flick.",1248912000,2,352,4.571428571428571

3747512,1,B001PKHS2W,This has got to be one of the worst movies ever made. I feel like i was ripped off even though i only paid a dollar to rent it. Please rent it first before you even think of buying it. I have not reviewed anything on amazon in a long time. But this movie was so bad i felt like i had to write a review.,1243382400,,302,3.590909090909091
3747513,4,B001PKHS2W,"I bought the movie cuz I needed a laugh, and I did... a hella lot!  It was fun to see all those MTV reality stars in a movie... that was funny in itself.

3747518,4,B001PKHS2W,"I think this movie is really funny.

8333440,2,B001PKHS2W,"I'm sure that someone, somewhere could have cranked out a better script for these young actors to perform to.  The jokes were lame, the stereotypes were even worse and the only truly redeeming gag was a word play regarding Ms. Apple that reared its hilarious head partway through the film.

Otherwise, it was lame.

Lame - lame - lame.

The only thing to recommend it was the price - dirt cheap - and the fact that I can pass it off to someone else and proclaim its great production values (of which it has none).
