4460573,2,B004RE29S6,"The plot and suspense of the movie was downright dull and boring but what keeps this movie alive is Tom Sturridge's lively and brilliantly talented performances as a street entertainer and the magic tricks he can do from juggling with apples and baseballs to fire sticks in the air. He was absolutely moving, lovable, charming and touching. I'd give him all the stars for his performance in this. But the rest of the movie was just...eh...nothing to really write home about.",1304899200,4,474,4.864197530864198
4460574,4,B004RE29S6,"What I Can Tell You:
This movie reminded me of Benny and Joon starring Johnny Depp. The character of Will played by Tom Sturridge is just adorable. There is something sweet, innocent and genuine that shines through in his smile.

There is a train accident. Will's parents die. He leaves his home town with his brother to live with relatives but never forgets his best friend Emma who helped him by telling him his parents will always be with him. Fast Forward maybe 10 years and Will is headed back home when he hears that Emma's father is dying  to finally tell her that he loves her. He has been in love with her forever and follows her around just to catch a glimpse.

While Emma's complicated life gets in the way of her happiness, Will shows her the simple pleasures of the past. Before they can live happily ever after, a turn of events and a jealous boyfriend has Will arrested and charged with murder. His innocence is tested but love always finds a way.

I loved this movie and was shocked that I had not heard of it. It may not be award worthy but this different twist on young love is sweet and introduced me to Tom Sturridge. You can't go wrong with friendship movies and young love",1304640000,4,1194,4.389140271493213

4460591,5,B004RE29S6,"This is a really underrated indie film that is worth a watch. Its a love story of 'sorts' so with valentines day coming up.... :)

NB Some minor spoilers may follow.

The story centres around Willy who is basically a stalker (in the shadows) of his childhood friend and love of his life Emma (this is rather obvious in the first 15 - 20 mins) The difference with this film is that it is told from an incredibly sympathetic point of view. Strange? well yes it is very strange!

Willy (Tom Sturridge) has some issues. He follows Emma (Rachel Bilson) around the country and this part of the story centres on her returning home (with Willy following) and the events that unfold. Willy is very sick and its where the movie gets a bit deeper as it is a result of childhood trauma. You never get the sense he is dangerous rather the opposite - but he doesn't realise his own illness and those around him have generally accepted it or enabled it to a degree which is a cause of differing conflict.

Several side plots keep the action running and the scene where Willy finally talks with Emma is masterfully dragged out as we the audience are privy to the information Emma isn't. The moments of slight awkwardness that unfold and eventually the situation reveals itself is very well acted.

Willy is a dreamer... obsessed and he isn't all there but he has a sense of optimism which is hard not to like. Emma is dealing with her own life melt down and internal family issues. There are some very emotional parts and other parts feel a tad uneven. It's terribly easy to be an armchair critic though and on the whole its a great movie.

It is a movie for those who at least know that feeling of wanting someone you can't have. It isn't perfect but it is most definitely worth a watch.",1423526400,,1772,4.420245398773006

4460630,2,B004RE29S6,"This movie falls very, very short.

I will start with the pros.
- the man who plays Willie is an amazing actor. He pulls off a ""special"" person very well, which is hard to do. That was enjoyable.
- there are a few memorable characters (like Emma's mom) who are delightful to watch.
- the quality (lighting, cinematography, music) is good; I can't complain.

The cons can mainly be summed up in one sentence: The story is terrible.
I can't count how many loose ends they left us with. I had so many unanswered questions in my mind by the end. ""Why did she say her show was horrible?"" ""Why did she throw the vase at Aaron?"" ""Why was Willie screaming her name in jail - I mean what did he think he figured out?"" Besides those, the whole concept is creepy. I couldn't help agreeing with Willie's brother that what he was doing with Emma was wrong - that he was a little crazy. His stalking her is basically portrayed as ""okay"" because he's special. It's supposed to be romantic that he ""goes where she goes"" but it's not. It's plain creepy.

There are many other things I could say I that made this movie as poor as it was, but I'll stop there. Please just trust me and don't waste your time. Go watch The Vow instead.",1352678400,5,1214,4.292576419213974

I am 80 - not a kid!  But this movie is so very charming and is so very possible.  The sad thing is that most people may think this could never happen, but I know it can.

I did not know the leads in this but from the beginning I was charmed.  I watched it on the computer screen and leaned into the movie to be as close as I could be.  Tom Sturridge has my heart and Rachel Bilson turned out to be as dear in the end as he was throughout the film.

I can't say more than this but buy the film at the price on Amazon.  You will find it may be a cult film.  The music is great.  I bought the soundtrack on iTunes, too.  I literally have no words but WONDERFUL for the film.

The last scene, shot at the wharf in San Francisco,  is a killer scene!  You will play it over and over.  Enjoy and fall in love again!",1336608000,,912,3.751322751322751

His friends are trying to ""encourage"" him to finally talk to this girl, but you can tell that they think he is insane and an escaped mental patient. FINALLY...he tells the girls he has been stalking her...she freaks out (THANK GOD, ITS CALLED A RESTRAINING ORDER) and tells her criminal boyfriend all about him. He takes the liberty to falsely accuse him for a murder crime that he committed.  The only interesting characters in this movie were the parents, who were in themselves outrageous and crazy also. Finally after crying himself to sleep in jail...his brother bails him out and he ditches his brother to join the circus...and in my opinion...this is where he belonged at the beginning of the movie...

4460649,4,B004RE29S6,"Waiting for Forever is a very unusual film but one reminiscent of movies made during the 1930s and early 1940s that contain an underlying and somewhat clich&eacute; theme that love lasts forever or returns in some form.  With this as the main premise of the film, main characters Emma Twist (Rachel Bilson) and Willie Donner (Tom Sturridge) had been childhood friends, become re-acquainted when both return to their hometown after leading separate lives.  Emma became an actress in Hollywood while Willie dealt with his parents' death and became a street performer somewhere along the West Coast while still attempting to find Emma.  The film appears to have a predictable storyline, however, beyond that portion of the story, complications arise.

The film has dramatic and romantic overtones but also involves the intricacies of relationships.  Both Emma and Willie must confront major concerns within each of their respective families as well as friends that enter the picture.  For Willie there is much concern of his state of mind by his brother who has taken the responsibility of keeping in touch with him while he literally juggled his way through a vagabond life.  And for Emma, she along with her mother (Blythe Danner) have had to deal with her father's illness that is not completely explained and is one of the odd portions of the storyline; this part of the story appears fragmented because Emma's father (Richard Jenkins) appeared like he was getting well but by the end of the film it is questionable.  And to add to the complications, Emma's boyfriend (Matthew Davis) surprisingly shows up to forgive her for past misgivings, but his story is much more complex than realized as well as her own -- one of those whiplash moments.  But by the end of the film, the story between Emma and Willie come full circle.

Waiting for Forever has moments of drama and witty irony that one usually sees in an unpredictable film.  That important aspect makes the movie very interesting and thought provoking. Although when one watches the first half hour or hour of the film, it may appear to be a typical storyline.  However, it is unpredictability between Emma and Willie and the focal point of the relationship, friendship and memories that make the film worth watching.",1326499200,2,2275,4.957894736842105
4460650,1,B004RE29S6,"Wow, this is a fairytale come true for all stalkers.  The only part of the movie that made sense is when Emma told Will to leave her alone.  A restraining order would've been the happy ending here.  I'm in utter shock that anyone would consider this a decent movie.  Although this is a ""movie"", I found it such a stretch from reality.  They might have well ended the movie with her on both knees proposing to him while a random flash mob broke out into song and dance.  The poor acting matched the horrendous script.  The only credit I'll give the movie, is it kept me watching in shock of how I could predict the next outrageous scene over and over and over.  It was almost like a game.  Anyone who can relate to Will, I would recommend psychiatric help.  I'll repeat this is two thumbs up for stalkers....any sane person, stay away from this movie!",1323993600,3,850,4.391025641025641
4460651,4,B004RE29S6,"There were some humorous scenes in this movie as well as some scenes that will make your eyes well with tears. I found the story compelling and at times wasn't sure what to expect next. The main character, Will, is a dreamer, the boyfriend is pretty scary, and Will's memories of their childhood were sweet to experience with him as he remembered better times. But he lived in a bit of a fantasy world. That was well done. I thought the acting was pretty good too. You could tell a lot from their expressions without them having to say a word. I love movies like that. When the heroine found out the hero, Will, had been following her, her reaction was palpable. The look of shock, then fear, then horror, then confusion all played out in her expression, and I thought the actress did a great job showing emotion in that scene. I also loved the scene where the older brother picks Will up and they are in the cab and Will says that life isn't peachy and things don't always turn out right. His stark realization of the hard truths in life and the way their emotions play out were well done. That scene was quite powerful. Anyway, what I love most about a movie is not just the story line, but the acting. This one had some great acting, and the plot kept me guessing quite a bit.

4460667,2,B004RE29S6,"Judge Franck Tabouring, DVD Verdict -- ""Waiting for Forever tries really hard to come across as a heartwarming fairy tale, but as much as I hate to say this, it simply doesn't succeed. I can see how this film could have had some potential on paper during early developmental stages, but as a finished product, it's loaded with annoying flaws that make it nearly impossible to fall in love with. The movie takes quite long to introduce viewers to every character in the film. While that is certainly admirable, it doesn't necessarily move along the story we should be caring about. We're also forced to fight our way through a bunch of backstory, and while it definitely helps build the central story, it sure could have been reduced a little. By the time Will makes contact with Emma, I found myself unable to care about either one of them. I wish I could say I loved the performances in Waiting for Forever, but that wouldn't be true. While Bilson has a few solid moments giving her the opportunity to show off her acting talent, Sturridge seems to struggle with the portrayal of a crazy dude running after the girl of his dreams. Let's just say his delivery remains stiff throughout. The only one shining in every scene he's in is Richard Jenkins, who plays Emma's sarcastic dad. Then again, we're talking about an actor who pretty much always hits the right notes. I give this to director James Keach though: he sure managed to deliver on great production values. The film's shot well and looks great, and anything from locations to costumes just fits the mood. On a similar note, I must applaud 20th Century Fox for giving the film a superb Blu-ray treatment. Presented in a 1.85:1 widescreen transfer, the movie boasts a clean image quality rich in colors and sharpness. Audio tracks are balanced fairly well too, so technically speaking. Special features are nowhere to be found.""",1310774400,,1886,4.735562310030395

Sadly as stated in other reviews he was pretty much the only good thing about this movie. 3 stars for his performance, a few good side characters + the awkwardly romantic story line. *Spoilers. You know that things are going to get rough since Emma Twist(Rachel Bilson) has no idea that Will(Tom Sturridge) has been following her around like an adorable lost puppy all over the continent for years. A super adorable charasmatic puppy but still. The story could have been she finds out, freaks out then realizes she loves him as much as he loves her but there is this whole thing w/ her bofriend that felt just completely random. I guess they needed some way to get him out of the picture. So don't go in expecting a cute romcom this is way way more romantic drama. Will has the boyfriend + his horrible timing to contend w/. He choosees to tell Emma he's been following her when he follows her home because her father is dying. Yeah awful timing. Especially since things are going good until he tels her about his tag along fixtion w/ her. Since Will has this everthing is always good view of life that his brother wants to force out of him but his friends embrace his innocence + obsession and just enjoy his being there. Reality does slap him around but he still comes out the same great hearted guy. Does Emma succcumb to his magnetic personality, well I'm sure you can figure that out on our own. Give this one a look see for Tom Sturridge's performance alone. You'll fall in love w/ his character right outta the gate + root for him throughout the entire film.

4460675,4,B004RE29S6,"In the beginning of the movie, I liked it. In the middle, I thought it was so weird the way the main character (which is the guy?) acted like. He seem like someone who was crazy and needed helped. I almost want to stop watching the movie, but when he got arrested, the movie turns out to be great. I really didn't know what to expect. It almost made me cry. The movie has taught me a valuable lesson: Don't judge a book by its cover. Everyone has a story behind the way they act. Get to know them, and you may be surprised. I will definately recommend it. Please don't regret ordering the movie if you find the beginning or the middle boring. The end of the movie is worth watching it. You have to see the whole movie to love the ending. You will get it the moral of the story afterwards.",1305936000,2,788,4.123376623376624

8439008,5,B004RE29S6,A great movie about a girl he loved that he lost contact with then found and although things didn't play out as he wished he found gratitude for all that she taught him and was thankful for their time together from beginning to end.

8439010,4,B004RE29S6,"This is an idealized look at love and loss.  Willy grew up with the great love of his life, Emma, in childhood only to be torn from her when they were 10 years old.  Throughout the subsequent years, he keeps his love alive by being in places where she is even if it means only catching glimpses of her.  When the illness of Emma's father bring her back to their hometown, Willey follows and magic occurs but not in any conventional, or for Emma, completely knowing way.  The unfolding of the story and its conclusion are beautifully told by Rachel Bilson (have always adored her) and Tom Sturridge with strong support by the always great Blythe Danner and Richard Jenkins, one of our finest actors.  The film is endearing but also heartbreaking.  The theme of the death of one's parents permeates every aspect of the story but is done with taste and the proper reverence. To those who have experienced this, have some tissues handy to dab away your tears but don't let that stop you from watching this delightful movie.",1462924800,,1019,4.602209944751381

8439014,5,B004RE29S6,"One of the undiscovered and unsung gems, and mostly due to the talents of the leading man/boy who made me remember a little of what truly matters in my life.  Tom Sturridge's portrayal of the lead character is one of the most nuanced of any attempt at edgy psychotic love I've ever seen in the movies.  What he managed to give us poor, sane plain old everydayers was a pure glimpse into great soulful beauty.  The result of a well written and filmed story that can still make me tear up.  I'm convinced there are more people out there who will one day discover the lovely beauty of this film.",1447113600,2,592,4.3545454545454545
