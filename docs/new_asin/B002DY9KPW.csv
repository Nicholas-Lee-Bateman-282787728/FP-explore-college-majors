8366289,5,B002DY9KPW,"I have been buying DVDs from Amazon for years and I have quite a collection.
A lot of them are military action which is my favorite.  I was even lucky to find
old releases now on DVD.  All of the DVDs ordered new or used have all played
without a problem.",1392076800,,255,3.980392156862745
8366290,1,B002DY9KPW,"I agree with reviewer, Lynnette D. Harstad, that this DVD is a RIP-OFF
It's because it is just a part of Battle 360 - season one. Season one consists of 4 DVDs in one set and it is sold at around 18 dollars. Meanwhile this single DVD, about  the Battle of Guadalcanal is sold at around 5 dollars. Moreover, the DVD set was released in 2008 as stated on Amazon.com while the single DVD was released in 2009!

Why did History Channel release only part of Season 1 on a single disc after releasing the whole series in a set of 4 discs?

In short, the content is interesting but the DVD is a waste of my money. I did not know this before buying it from Amazon. Of course, after viewing it, I could not return it. Aggg! Save your money on this one and buy the whole set of Battle 360 - season one instead.",1335484800,2,800,4.082802547770701
8366291,1,B002DY9KPW,"WARNING: If you already own Patton 360 and or Enterprise Battle 360 you already have what is on Battle 360 Guadalcanal. (Note Patton had NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BATTLE FOR Guadalcanal and is included with this DVD). THIS IS NOT A NEW SERIES DEDICATED TO Guadalcanal, ALL IT HAS IS PARTS OF THE OTHER BATTLE 360 SERIES. We enjoyed the others and recommend both of them. This one is nothing but a DECEPTIVE MARKETING PLOY TO RIP OFF FANS OF THE BATTLE 360 SERIES!",1314748800,7,460,4.423529411764706
8366292,4,B002DY9KPW,"In telling the story of the Big E, an over-reliance on compouter-generated imagery (CGI) is quite evident and often annoying.  There are lots of archival sources for combat video which could have been and should have been used.  The graphics utilized are done so repetitiously as well.  Individual CGI sequences however are done well and get the point across cartoon-like.

On the positive side, the story of the Big E's actions are clearly described with a fair amount of detail.  Daily life on board the carrier, armaments, weapons are dealt with often in an abbreviated style.  Comparisons of Japanese and American weaponry and tactics are present but sparsely explained.  The relationships between these differences and the resultant tactical choices are sketched but could have been expanded.

The benefit of this 1 disc out-take is to give an introduction to the entire Battle 360 series which ran on the History Channel.  If you like it, you would probably like the entire series, and the price of the whole series isn't much more than this one DVD offering.  On the other hand, there is a lot of filler in each episode (I have also watched the entire series which unfortunately suffers the same flaws of this single DVD)",1278115200,3,1228,4.91747572815534
8366293,3,B002DY9KPW,"I fell asleep viewing the first disk.
I wish the History Channel would stick to the facts and
proper time sequence in telling about the events of World War II.
Instead of facts such as dates, weapons, tactics, equipment, rations
and leaders,we get something less than a John Wayne movie,
that is edited by hacks.",1277337600,5,312,4.6909090909090905
