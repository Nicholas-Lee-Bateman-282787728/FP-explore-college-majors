3920599,5,B002EZLO5E,Absolutely beautifully filmed in one of the most exciting places in the world !!! The only slight negative is the endless bonus commentary which of coarse you don't need to watch anyway. This has to be Rudy's best work yet!!!,1252800000,4,225,4.65

3920615,5,B002EZLO5E,This Travel DVD of Japan covers Tokyo and Kyoto..It shows the Japanese people and their 1000 year old Temples and tradtional Culture..It is one of my favorite Travel DVDs..Japan kept 1000 year old Temples and traditions alive...Japanese Gardens and Archeture survived for 1000 years...This DVD is one of my favorite...Its well done and affordable...Its fascinating...Japan is on the other side of the World....Japan was completely isolated .....basically isolated for 1000 years..,1422921600,2,480,5.774647887323944
3920616,5,B002EZLO5E,Great video tour of Thailand hosted by Rudy Maxa. Entertainingly presented and hits the highlights of a trip to Thailand from Bangkok to theBridge over the River Kwai to the beaches and Jungles.,1421884800,,194,4.909090909090909
3920617,2,B002EZLO5E,"So disappointing.  The beginning of the DVD is an advertisement for hotels--the entire show is an advertisement for wine tasting and hotels.  I wanted to see Argentina and instead he covered the same story in two cities that were completely similar.  There was no countryside to speak of--even though Argentina is famous for the waterfalls, plus glaciers...and great beaches.  Nothing of that sort was covered.  A very poor travel video and I do not recommend it for any true view of the country.  After watching this, it gave me no increased desire to visit--too much time talking of the fruity yet deep flavor of their wines, which by the way probably took up 1/2 of the production.  Boring.  I didn't want to buy an infomercial.",1420416000,,731,4.792
3920618,4,B002EZLO5E,I like Rudy Maxa in all his travels but this was a little of a duplicate for me because I own most of his collection.,1418256000,,117,3.72
3920619,5,B002EZLO5E,"Gave as a gift to daughter when travelling to Argentina, very helpful for places to eat and travel",1410912000,,98,4.5
3920620,4,B002EZLO5E,this is an area I had visited and I wanted a video of this area,1405468800,,63,3.2666666666666666
3920621,1,B002EZLO5E,"This DVD was a joke, !!!
Don't waste your  on this
video. First of all it is not
the 78 minutes long and
it only covers 3 sections
of the country, I t does not
go into the major city of
Thailand and it's people.
A few shots of beaches

from the air and a dull commentary.
Save your money you won''t learn
anything about this beautiful country.
How did this Clown get this job anyway
???",1403308800,,386,4.0
3920622,4,B002EZLO5E,"On the contrary to the other reviewer, I found these shows on Argentina very fun to watch.  As always, Rudy has a great sense of humor and provides interesting information.  I agree that he perhaps spent a little too much time on the wine industry in the Mendoza episode.  However, that is one of the things that Argentina has become known for in recent years and Rudy doesn't spend all of his time there in that particular show.  The Buenos Aires show is the more entertaining of the two episodes on the disc, as Rudy explores the tango, the food of Argentina, the unique and large Italian contribution to the country, its love affair with soccer and its zest for life.  You might be able to rent something like this from the library first before buying it, to see if it is worth the purchase, and I think it is.",1395273600,,813,4.3933333333333335
3920623,5,B002EZLO5E,This is a warm intro into possible travels in Thailand.  Well written script and the video quality is not bad.,1390694400,,110,4.5
3920624,5,B002EZLO5E,"Beautiful show of two lovely countries, Russia and Estonia.  Worth the investment!  Some gorgeous footage you will be hard pressed to find in other videos",1386720000,2,154,5.12
3920625,1,B002EZLO5E,"The title is misleading as in fine prints it says and shows only Tokyo and Kyoto. Confusing main page does whatever it wants. All content shown is available on you tube. As I go to Japan every year I hoped to see something new, instead its a very short show of well known places, food and advertisement of sponsors. Its funny how all these videos never mention any prices be them hotels, food or anything like all tourists are rich. No, they are not and I research my expenses well in advance on internet. Avoid.",1380844800,4,512,4.4
3920626,3,B002EZLO5E,"This DVD is informative enough. I suppose if you have JUST started looking into Japan the DVD would be a good place to start, but if you have already been researching Japan then I doubt you will find this DVD presents you with much new info.",1378425600,3,241,4.260869565217392
3920627,4,B002EZLO5E,"Rick Steves is my favorite tour guide, but for some inexplicable reason, he only does Europe. Rudy Maxa will never be Rick Steves. Nevertheless, I enjoyed this DVD.

The DVD showed Tokyo's impressive skyscrapers, shopping districts, and attractive women. Rudy stopped by a Pachinko Parlor and the Cherry Blossom Festival. He also visited the Tsukiji Fish Market. He used the Tokyo Metro to get around. Although it is overcrowded, it is a clean and efficient system. I also enjoyed the Kyoto episode since it featured the geisha. The DVD is a little short, but definitely worth the price.",1371340800,5,587,4.989795918367347
3920639,5,B002EZLO5E,As always RM gives a very  good overview of the area of travel under consideration.  Good introduction and coverage of the area with beautiful footage.,1364515200,2,151,5.0
3920640,3,B002EZLO5E,"Hits the three or four main parts of Thailand. Gives a great overview. Should give a person who has never been there some idea of Thailand, but for those like me who have been there-it really doesn't offer you anything new.",1363046400,,223,4.463414634146342
3920641,5,B002EZLO5E,"Recommend this video to anyone before they travel to Russia, it will be very helpful in choosing places to see.",1358640000,,111,4.6
3920642,5,B002EZLO5E,"Sorry I have not been able to view the video yet.
It was meant for a hospice patient and he passed away before getting to see it.
I am sure it is a good video as I watch Rudy Maxa on PBS all the time and all his shows are terrific.",1335484800,3,231,3.549019607843137
3920643,2,B002EZLO5E,"While this video gives a good overview of Thailand, its not worth the price.  There are other better resources out there for travelers.  This gives a nice overview, but not a true lay of the land.  I spent most of my viewing time wondering how a guy like Rudy landed this gig...unless he self financed and produced??? Don't buy this, head down to your local library.  Also wikitravel.org is a fantastic resource for anyone heading off to unknown territories.",1311552000,,458,4.7594936708860756
3920644,2,B002EZLO5E,So i got this dvd to play at my office while patients wait.  T though it would be of the beautiful beaches and site seeing.  Its good if u want a recap of the country not for the purpose i got it for.,1294617600,,200,3.627906976744186
3920645,4,B002EZLO5E,"This DVD serves as a very rough introduction to Thailand.  It only covers 3 area:  Bangkok, the Golden Triangle area, and the southern beaches.  The images are beautiful, but the real value of the DVD lies in the producers/writers commentary in the DVD extras section.",1266105600,6,268,4.911111111111111
3920646,2,B002EZLO5E,"I wanted to like this video. I am about to go to Argentina and I want to see what is good to visit and what is not worth my limited time. I expected Argentina, with some Patagonia, Parks, Glaciers, Cities, Food info, Wine, Leather, Markets, travel advise, etc. But this was very limited.
  The people I am going with, sat with me and watched this video. We ended up fast forwarding through most of it. Too much on too little. It was just on Mendoza and Buenos Aires. And even there, there wasn't much about where to go. For instance, most of Mendoza was about wine tasting and the industry. It wasn't what I am going to travel all the way down there to see and do, especially since I live a little over an hours drive from Napa. In Buenos Aires, there was a (too) long segment about the Tango.
  I asked everyone who watched it with me, ""was it just me, or did anyone else feel like it was not that good?"" We all agreed, it wasn't good.",1262995200,8,936,4.183333333333334
3920647,4,B002EZLO5E,"Rudy's shows tend to be rather restrained and businesslike, and this doesn't mesh so well with India, but he does a good job with it.  There are segments where he looks decidedly uncomfortable with the grit and grime of India.  In one scene he visits a small rural farming settlement and he's wearing what looks like Friday casual business attire.  He appears most at ease in a scene where he's reading the paper in the lobby of his large, western style hotel, safely insulated from the chaos outside. I suppose he is out of his element a bit here.

On the plus side, his coverage of Delhi and Jaipur is quite good, with some really great footage.  There are a handful of segments in Delhi which really capture the street atmosphere.  Overall video quality is top notch and Rudy is professional and well-informed, always respectful, never obnoxious.  His voice is silky smooth.  Good for the middle class and upper class traveler.

BTW, I saw him filming on the street in Pushkar when i was there a few yrs ago.  He looked like he wanted to be somewhere else but I could be wrong.",1259366400,10,1080,4.549222797927461
3920648,5,B002EZLO5E,planning a trip in the near future and loved this dvd. Rudy is a great traveler and seems to be an expert on Thailand since he respects and loves this country.  5 plus stars!,1255910400,4,174,4.117647058823529

8368529,5,B002EZLO5E,Very satisfied with the product,1513468800,,31,5.4
8368530,2,B002EZLO5E,There is a flaw in the DVD. It is presented in two segments: The Taj Mahal and Delhi; and Rajasthan. It is impossible to separate the two parts and when clicking on the first one it always goes to the second part. We have been unable to see the first Taj Mahal and Delhi portion of the recording.,1509408000,,296,4.120689655172414
8368531,3,B002EZLO5E,"This DVD definitely makes you want to visit Bangkok. It's a hidden gem that's overshadowed by the more popular Asian cities like Tokyo and Hong Kong. In particular, I liked Rudy's visit to the mall with the aquarium in it and the market where the trains ran through it. However, like many Rudy Maxa episodes, this one was too brief. It left me wanting more. I wish Rudy was like Rick Steves where he'd visit a city multiple times and cover different aspects of the city each time, rather than to rush through a 25 minute episode.",1489363200,,529,4.463917525773196
8368532,5,B002EZLO5E,I will be taking my first trip to Thailand soon to visit our Thai daughter from a student exchange program.  The possibilities are somewhat overwhelming.  I ordered a few DVD's to get a basic overview of the areas that I am most likely to visit.  This was the best DVD of all that I have seen so far.  Highly recommended.,1486080000,,321,4.3

8368534,5,B002EZLO5E,I saw this documentary before purchasing so I knew I would love it.  It's has a variety of Japanese tourist stops as well as places off the beaten path.,1470960000,2,152,4.241379310344827
8368535,5,B002EZLO5E,"I have several documentaries on India, and this one is different (in .a good way) from the rest. It is more personal and oriented toward what the traveler would want to know before traveling to two or three key areas of India. In this sense, it is helpful in ways that the other (fine) documentaries were/are not. Strongly recommended for anyone wanting to see India as a knowledgeable traveler might.",1468540800,,401,4.742857142857143
