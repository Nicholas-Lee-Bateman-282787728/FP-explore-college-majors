7842250,5,6303247792,"I would like to state that the 5 stars rating is for the movie and not for the TZ/EDDE tape.  Several people have been refering to this movie as Zombi and suggesting that Fulci's (okay, 20% his) Zombi 3 would properly be called Zombi 2. This movie which was released in the U.S. under the name Zombie, was released in certain parts of Europe as Zombi 2 by the distributors of said movie to follow the success of Dawn Of The Dead which was released under the title of Zombi, which was a different edit done by Argento.  Fulci's Zombie/Zombi 2 also is known as Zombie: Flesheaters; Island Of The Living Dead; Gli Ultimi Zombi (Italian); and other titles. Zombi 2 was released in 1979 in Europe. It was released in 1980 in the U.S. as Zombie and ran several years on Drive-In and Grindhouse circuits (Arthouse if you prefer).  As for recommendations, this has to deal with the different distributions of this film by video companies.  The TZ Video/EDDE Entertainment release as Zombie 2: The Dead Are Among Us on VHS is a rather grainy affair presented in a cropped full screen mode which will fit your TV screen. I have not had any tracking problems with it as another reviewer has claimed; however, I have had tapes from the same company for the same movie and had one with tracking problems and one without. The graininess does add a certain atmosphere to the movie if you like that though.  If you would like a fullscreen crop with some good pan and scan and better image quality on VHS then look for the one put out by Magnum Entertainment. I have not seen this one listed on Amazon but you may find one here used.  The Anchor Bay release on VHS and DVD is a widescreen presentation of a 2.35 to 1 ratio which is also referred to as an anamorphic widescreen presentation or what I just like to call very wide. If you do not have a large TV screen you may not like the widescreen presentation. (Just in case you are interested; anamorphic is a process which utilizes a special lens on the film camera and on the projector. The lens on the film camera essentially compresses an image onto the film which is wider than the ratio of the film frame. When the film is played on a projector, the image is uncompressed by a corresponding lens on the projector thus producing a widescreen image on the screen. AKA: this is known as useless trivia)  There is going to be another release of this movie on DVD under the title Zombi 2 in a 2 disc set containing lots of extras. Amazon does have it listed in the DVD section. It is scheduled to be released (I believe) on July 27, 2004 and can be pre-ordered.  I would offer a review of the movie, but that has been done to death (no pun intended, seriously). All that I can say is that I have always liked this movie and Fulci's style. Add to that the talents of cinematographer Sergio Salvati and Special Effects Make-Up Master Giannetto (Gino) de Rossi, and you have a well crafted end result which is one of Fulci's best pieces of work.  Now that I have shared some of what I know about zombie movies I will be off to look for a life I apparently misplaced somewhere.-Bob",1086393600,3,3113,4.390625
7842251,2,6303247792,"This movie is not what you would exactly call a horror movie. It's a movie if your a big fan of gore and a big Lucio Fulci fan which I am. Unless you can enjoy his movies like The Beyond and Don't Torture A Duckling than you won't like this. This movie got two stars because the makeup was incredible. As was the gore. I'd give the gore and makeup a 20 star if I could. Especially the scene where Olga Karlatos gets her eye pulled into a wooden splint. It's agonizing and not for the queezy but then again thats Lucio Fulci for ya. However the plot is probably the weakest I've ever seen. So unless you want a movie full of a gore, don't buy this.",1006300800,,647,4.0625
7842252,1,6303247792,"First of all, my rating does not go for the movie. It goes for the quality of the tape. I bought this movie because I love the movie ZOMBIE and I bought this before Anchor Bay released a remasted copy of the film. The quality of the tape is the worst I have ever seen. First of all, it won't play well in ANY VCR!!! It jumps and scrolls up an down the screen for the entire film! The color is horendously. It is UNWATCHABLE! T-Z video (a division of EDDE entertainment) got the rights to an awful reel to the film ZOMBIE, blatenly added their own spliced in title called ZOMBIE 2: THE DEAD ARE AMONG US, and released it on the unsuspecting world. DO NOT be fooled by this, pay the little extra and get the remastered version by Anchor Bay. I cannot stress this more!",1003104000,,766,4.1824324324324325
