Presents a story but leaves the main characters somewhat mysterious and leaves you with as many questions as it answers. Good fun - you just have to watch it again to try to figure it out. As others have said, beautifully filmed and quite well done. Our first Metzger film, but not our last!",1279756800,,416,4.4868421052631575

1027917,2,6305339929,"The Lickerish Quartet, though tame by today's standards comes from an era when for a movie to have some explicit content would have to be deemed ""to have political, social or artistic value"". The ""experimental"" aspects of The Lickerish Quartet are weird or don't make sense like sudden cuts to Bosch paintings or a couple making love on a floor with words written on it as from a dictionary that suddenly happen to be words relating to sexual terms. The whole ""was it real or just a dream?"" plot barely pieces together. It is a relic of its time. Radley Metzger, unlike Russ Meyer (Mudhoney, Vixen) the other ""auteur"" of this genre puts together a film that is fun to watch as a camp classic but otherwise will have you scratching your head one minute and laughing the next.",1152921600,4,774,4.575539568345324

Anybody who has been captured by (or curious about) the mystical splendor of Europe's old castles doesn't want to miss this 1970 movie. Whether it's erotic enough (or too erotic for an art film) is another story. Cinematography alone defines pretty well the difference between ""Lickerish Quartet"" and thousands of sleazy flicks out there. (P.S.

1027919,5,6305339929,"""The Lickerish Quartet"" is a shining example of alternative 1970's film making. In a time when adult films had to be classified as ""art-films"" to avoid censorship, writers and directors were forced to put a lot of effort into plot, dialog, and storyline. The end result sometimes worked better than others and here we see just how imaginitive a.... film can be. Beautiful cinematography, grandiose setting, and a certain ""twighlight-zone"" twist, make this film anything but boring. What makes it shine is the way it reflects the ... vision of 1970. The sex is free and easy, though carefully handled and practically ""R"" rated. If you like seduction, passion, and lovers running through the grass, this is the film for you. There's plenty of porn around, but this is something else. The motorcycle stunt scene is worth the price of the film alone.

It is very ""70's"" looking (and sounding) and has little value as a  supposedly erotic film. Outside of a few visually interesting scenes (i.e.  an older (ugly) guy and a young (very attractive) woman rolling around on a  floor covered with what looks like giant pages out of a dictionary, with  definitions of sexually oriented terms). Most of the film came off as  pretentious, boring, and outdated.

1028714,5,6305339929,"There are many reasons to respect this film.

This film was a made in 1969 - a time in which nudity and sexuality in film were relegated to the category of ""pretentious smut"" in grindhouse ""art"" theaters.

This film is an early exploration of human sexuality at a time when exploring our sexuality was still ""taboo.""  Many people didn't experience this period in our history.  This was one of the first films released in the U. S. to (tastefully) depict full frontal nudity, lesbian encounters and the healing powers of intimacy.

The film is about the mystical powers of intimacy that heal and empower individuals.  There are only four characters in the film.  Each of them represent one of four archetypes in the symbolism of the Tarot.  Mysticism (beyond organized religion) was also a taboo subject up until the early seventies.  For example, the principal character is a young (""smokin' hot) woman who is sexually independent, confident in her sexuality, and, engages the other three characters in intimacy.  She is represented by the ""priestess"" in the Tarot.  The Tarot is fairly described as a map of human consciousness expressed in universal (and timeless) anthropological symbols.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tarot-Handbook-Practical-Applications-of-Ancient-Visual-Symbols/dp/0874778956/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tarot Handbook: Practical Applications of Ancient Visual Symbols</a>.

The young boy in the film (just coming of age) is a metaphor for the ""magus"" (magician or transformer) in the Tarot.  He is young, innocent and mercurial.  His archetype represents the power of innocence and youth to transform.  There was an entire film from the period, with Anthony Quinn, that was devoted specifically to this archetype.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Magus/dp/B002BVZUAG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Magus</a>&nbsp;(with a young Michael Caine and Candice Bergen).

Typical of films directed and written by Radley Metzger, this film focuses on human sexuality.

Metzger was not permitted to make films like the Likerish Quartet in the U.S.  However, in the more receptive venues in Europe, he had the freedom to add to his list of pioneering art films in the area of human sexuality.  At the time, in the U.S.,  Metzger was considered a director who exploited nudity and explicit sex scenes as perversions.  His list of films (many of which are now highly regarded and respected) include: (Therese & Isabelle) (exploring tenderness in lesbian intimacy)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Therese-and-Isabelle/dp/B000CCD1Y8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Therese and Isabelle</a>; The Image (exploring sado-eroticism and BDSM)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Image/dp/B000063K1Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Image</a>; and Camille 2000 (exploring the emptiness of meaningless sexual relationships (sex without intimacy)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Camille-2000-Extended-Version/dp/B004Y125WM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Camille 2000 (Extended Version)</a>.

These were forbidden subjects in U. S. film in 1970.

Although many viewers considered the nudity and sexual encounters in the Lickerish Quartet as ""shocking"" back in 1970, the film is tasteful and tame by today's standards.  It's not a film for prurient interests.  It is a view of how tenderness and sexuality can combine, in our relationships, to heal and allow us to grow.

Why did Metzger include ""shocking"" nudity and sex scenes in his films?  There are two reasons.  First, he was a genuine avant-garde of artists who believed that human sexuality was something positive for humanity, instead of something salacious to be hidden in dark rooms.  The word ""lickerish"" means ""lecherous, lustful or lewd"" - the film shows that sexuality is a healing power that can transform, instead of being a burden to our consciousness.  Second, Metzger wanted his films to be widely viewed to bring our sexuality out into the open - the nudity and explicit sex made the films commercially viable by attracting more (sexually active) viewers.

Metzger's films are now regarded as innovative masterpieces instead of grindhouse smut.  The prurient sex scenes in the film distract many.  However, underlying all of his films, there is a tender view of male and female sexuality and its mysteries.

In one of the scenes, Sylvana Ventrurelli (the ""priestess"") is seeking out the young man.  She finds him on the roof of an old castle, waiting for her.  She says that it was difficult to find him given the many staircases and passageways of the old castle.  She didn't think she would find him.  The innocent young man (the magus or transformer) responds that on his way to the roof, he had ""left a thread of hope to guide her through the labyrinth.""

""A thread of hope to guide us through the labyrinth"" of human intimacy is Metzger's legacy to us.",1344729600,22,5042,5.959666203059805
1028715,3,6305339929,"This new Blu-ray of Radley Metzger's THE LICKERISH QUARTET isn't bad, but there are some source-related issues.  Specks and lines are not uncommon.  It looks like you're watching a film print of an old movie that's been around the block a few times.  That said, it's certainly watchable, and you can tell it's high def.  Maybe it would even take away from the ""grindhouse"" feel of the film if it looked too clean.  Just be sure to temper your expectations.

The interesting thing about THE LICKERISH QUARTET is that while it is a softcore film, it's more ambitious than a lot of regular films.  The sex scenes may be longer than necessary, but they always serve the story.  Many scenes are surreal, and we're never completely sure what is real and what is a fantasy.  The idea behind the film is that while a film is permanent, the viewing experience can change depending on the viewer.

A man, his wife, and her adult son view a porn film in their castle featuring a stunning blonde.  The bratty son gets tired of it, and they go to a carnival for his entertainment.  There, they notice a performer who looks just like the blonde woman in the film they just watched, and the man invites her back to the castle to watch the film.  However, when they get her back to their place, the film is not the same as it was before.  The next day, each one is seduced by the alluring blonde (Silvana Venturelli) and learns a bit about who they really are.

THE LICKERISH QUARTET is quite dated.  What turned audiences on in the early '70s seems pretty tame, even funny, today.  That said, it's still an entertaining artifact from a different time and there's really not much else like it.

The Blu-ray comes with a decent amount of extras, including an informative audio commentary by Metzger, a making-of, trailers, and more.",1304985600,19,1815,4.56656346749226
