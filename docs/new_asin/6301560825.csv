7812763,4,6301560825,"The tape is identified as for Beginner's.  For each dance, the couple show the basic steps plus two turns.  Then, they show the dance with some music.  The tape runs about 35 minutes.  Too bad they did not make an Intermediate and Advanced tape or extend the lessons to include more.  (If there are Intermediate and Advanced tapes, it does not appear that Amazon has them.)

The teachers show two variations on the waltz and polka that must be peculiar to Texas Dancing in particular or Country Dancing in general.  The Waltz is linear - no side-together.  The Polka is done with the dancers side by side.  Why not?  The box clearly states that these are Texas forms.  They look like fun.

If there is a trophy for Lowest Budget Stage Set, this tape would win it hands down.  May have been made in someone's basement.  Bare white walls plus a couple hay bales. Sometimes, the offstage band gets into the corner of the shot.  Ordinarily, this would drive a producer over the edge.  Here, it just seems to fit with everything else. No harm done.

Well worth the money. Left me wanting more.",1215993600,,1088,4.525773195876289
