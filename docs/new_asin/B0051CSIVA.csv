It's a fairly thorough workout but I was getting bored with it so I was looking for something new from her that was still in the Beginner's area.  The Energy Flow Vinyasa is actually not challenging enough for me, I'm surprised to say.  It's a good practice with some great explanations of poses but I'm beyond that. Guess I maybe be ready for her intermediate DVD.",1473984000,2,542,4.4
