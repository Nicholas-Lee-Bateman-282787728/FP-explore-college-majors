5463366,5,B00AOCDEDY,"This is a compelling and frightening look at how religious fundamentalists have distorted U.S. history and continue to do so. They have made truth, history and critical thinking
almost criminal while making millions for textbook publishers whose works slant in one, very dangerous direction. If religionists in the two largest textbook markets (TX and CA) can distort history for the rest of the nation, we run the risk of an even less informed electorate than we have now.  This DVD is a must-see for people who think, for parents who want quality education for their children and for a nation facing powerful competition in a world market.",1376611200,5,641,4.990654205607477
5463367,5,B00AOCDEDY,"I recently reviewed a film in which the following statement was made: ""Fanaticism is often nothing more than the other face of madness."" Watching the powerful and very informative ""The Revisionaries,"" I couldn't help but think about this statement, and how true it is.

The documentary can be viewed as a tragic-comedy, as it displays how sad and serious, as well as at times funny, the state of our union is in regard to some issues. In this case, the issue is science versus religion. Director Scott Thurman, who also produced and wrote the film, takes us to the glorious state of Texas, where we meet Don McLeroy, who is being grilled by state officials in reference to ""fifteen bills around here, to strip your authority."" You see, McLeroy is a local dentist and Sunday school teacher, who heavily supports the ""intelligent design"" concept and is against evolution. He also happens to be the Texas School Board's chairman, and he is part of a select group that decides the contents of the science books in the state. Scary, right? It should be, as we are taken to several of the board's meetings, and we witness how much power this fellow has, and how convinced he is of his beliefs - he is truly a fanatic. Sadly, he is not the only one on the board against evolution. He has big support with Cynthia Dunbar, who happens to teach religion in Liberty University. The rest of the members are not strong in any issue, and depend on outsiders. Luckily, these outsiders - invited consultants or observers, I guess - include Kathy Miller, from the Texas Freedom Network, and Dr. Ron Wetherington, an anthropology professor. Both individuals are a thorn in the bud for McLeroy and Dunbar, and bring sanity to the hearings. Director Thurman not only takes us through the meeting and each party's arguments, but also examines McLeroy's thinking in detail, his rise and fall - the man is an open book...and a joke.

As noted by Michael Moore -- a fighter for the common good in his own right --, ""I hope that every American sees this film."" I agree, as ""The Revisionaries"" takes a look at some of the scary things that happen behind doors in those government buildings in right-wing states, in which some lunatics use our freedoms to push their agendas and, sadly, their ignorance.

5463369,2,B00AOCDEDY,"Finally the questioning of the evolutionary theory is being brought to the public school. Finally kids will not be indoctrinated into thinking that all that is known is that we think that we are sure that we evolved from 'soup'. But movie isn't totally neutral; it tries to show Christians as bullies. Also it shows their belief-driven behavior (praying, quoting Bible) which surely looks weird to an atheist. I think that the movie should've shown evolution-driven behavior as well (eugenics, racism, euthanasia, abortions, etc) to level the perception. A couple of quotes I liked:
Texas Citizens for `Science': ""High school students don't have expertise or the abilities to discuss and critique scientific theories and hypothesis...""
Riiiight... so they should be exposed to one theory only, so their undeveloped brains wouldn't get all confused, and start malfunctioning all over the place.

- ""There is no evidence to dis-prove evolution"".

5463370,3,B00AOCDEDY,"Summary:
(18 min ) I will give Scott Thurman the credit that there are several people making decisions of educational material that do not have a rich understanding of the content at hand. However, I would claim that each party involved on the board is misinformed on key issues of the debates. Thus immature decisions were made in determining acceptable educational material for textbooks.

Scott Thurman presents Don McLeroy as if he should be as a historian overseeing educational material. He is not a historian as he does not know large amounts of details that a historian would. However, he does have the general idea of how to balance religion and science in public education in a truthful manner and the right idea of the Christian message of the book of Genesis. Thus as an overseer I saw him making fine judgment calls in scientific textbooks.

As far as I understand for the Social Studies portion, there is an issue with censorship and separation of church and state.

The Science Debate:
- Myths (falsifying Scott Thurman's arguments):

- (7 min) Science and Religion do not conflict with each other. (key flaw in argument)
--They do conflict with each other. For example, the religion of Christianity states that if we are not born of original sin as it is written in Genesis 3 then there is no need for a savior, Jesus Christ. For Jesus Christ came to redeem those born of sin. Thus no Jesus Christ, no Christianity. Therefore also either man was the original creature made from dust or man's ancestors inherited new traits and evolved with new organs over time. Source: Darwinism: Science or Philosophy, Chapter 4 - Darwinism and Theism, by Phillip E. Johnson.

- A historian is not a scientist. (13 min)
-- Irrelevant. Both a historian and a scientist desire to seek and reveal the truth. They both build an argument using facts, an posteriori approach, or use inductive reasoning, to prove a theory.

The Social Studies Debate:

-myth: (54 min) take the politics out of state board of education?
-- The board is a political organization.

- (55 min) The message seems to be that separation of church and state is to extract any ideas that are related to Christian jargon. If Christian jargon was written in American government writings then we ought to use it.

- However, there seems to be a lot of censorship done to the textbooks in the state board of education of Texas that was based on personal preference. Interesting.",1368576000,,2443,4.783847980997625
5463371,5,B00AOCDEDY,"The Revisionaries showcases how public education has become the latest battleground in a new wave of cultural, religious and ideological clashes, with local Texas education board members advancing agendas of Creationism and other religious issues in public schools. This documentary highlights how their tactics have had the effect of rewriting key tenets of U.S. democracy and are affecting educational policies at the national level",1367280000,17,434,5.796875
5463372,5,B00AOCDEDY,"Texas native Scott Thurman reports from the latest of the front lines of the American culture wars: The Texas State Board of Education. Thurman captures the action as the the far-right majority of the board, led by governor-appointed chairman and small-town dentist Don McLeroy, decide on the language used in public school text books for the state of Texas until the year 2020.

The first battle is over language used in science texts, specifically in regards to wording about the ""weaknesses"" of theories and how it affects the teaching of the theory of evolution. Battling the board members are activists with the National Center for Science Education and the Texas Freedom Network. This may at first seem to the casual observer to be a bit of hair splitting and semantics--a case of left v right political squabbling. But then we see the board members' true intentions in the film's behind-the-scenes footage, as McLeroy publicly brags about his belief in a 6,000-year-old Earth, people walking with dinosaurs, and the logistics of animal poop on Noah's ark--or (perhaps more disturbingly) as fellow board member Cynthia Dunbar travels to Washington DC and gives a speech that ends with a prayer for God to ""invade our schools."" It also becomes abundantly clear that these board members lack even a basic understanding of the theory they are attempting to denigrate. At one point during the debates, McLeroy is called upon to explain the concept of evolutionary stasis to a fellow board member, and his bumbling, incoherent response shows that he hasn't the slightest idea what it is.

If the fight over science doesn't disturb you, the battle over social studies curriculum should. This time McLeroy and allies:

- make sure that students learn about the importance of ""the conservative resurgence of the 1980s and 1990s, including Phyllis Schlafly, the Contract With America, the Heritage Foundation, the Moral Majority and the National Rifle Association""

- replace mention of hip hop with that of country music (why both can't be mentioned is unclear),

- replace the term capitalism with ""free-enterprise system,""

- replace the teaching that America is a democracy with the term ""constitutional republic,""

- insert the name ""Hussein"" between ""Barrack"" and ""Obama,""

- reduce the role of minorities in American history classes, and

- cut Thomas Jefferson from a list of thinkers who influenced the American Revolution, replacing him with Thomas Aquinas and John Calvin

...among other things.

Perhaps you don't live in Texas so you don't think this affects you or your children. Well, think again. Due to the massive population of Texas (and therefore the sheer number of books purchased by the state), how the State Board of Education rules on text books purchased there affect the text books distributed all across the US. What's taught in Texas has a ripple effect on what's taught in classrooms nationwide.

The Revisionaries is as eye-opening and disturbing as it is entertaining and, at times, hilarious. The film is also very even-handed and balanced. Thurman makes the wise choice to stay mostly silent throughout the film, allowing the subjects of the documentary to speak for themselves. McLeroy et al. get plenty of screen time to explain themselves and defend their actions. They aren't vilified, and they in fact come off a bit sympathetic and very sincere. McLeroy in particular seems to be a very nice man who honestly wants what he thinks is best for children, Texas, and the nation as a whole--however crazy it may seem to those of us who aren't religious fundamentalists and card-carrying members of the Tea Party.

At the risk of sounding trite, The Revisionaries is a must-see... whether you live in Texas or not.",1359676800,49,3745,5.079804560260587
8555382,3,B00AOCDEDY,"This focuses upon a man who aspires to have the text book in Texas have a Christian perspective on the origin of species. Shows the guy he is running against for the position. People argue about what is knowledge/science, weather it is possibly provable and weather or not high school student should be talking about what they comprehend.",1467676800,,338,4.844827586206897
8555383,3,B00AOCDEDY,"I really can't imagine how either side of the creationism issue are really happy with this film. On the scientific side, they must believe that Mr. McElroy was treated with kid gloves.  Mostly his beliefs that the world is 6,000 years old and that evolution doesn't exist is presented and allowed to stand or fall on its own merits. (No one asks him, for example, how the two penguins walked thousands of miles in time to jump onto the ark with the dinosaurs and the incestuous handful of humans}  Perhaps the earth was not only younger than science believes but smaller also.

And on the Creationists' side, they must have been disappointed that a light would be pointed at their efforts, perhaps making their further editing of history and science more difficult in 2017 when the textbooks come up for revisioning again. I thought it was also interesting that the creationists were allowed to import slick outside experts while the science side only had access to Texas experts. That scientist was eloquent and smart, but for the bigger picture presented by the Social Studies issues, the scientist probably wished someone more knowledgeable on history and philosophy could have been present. Not that it matters, as often happens in partisan politics, the game was rigged by the votes anyway. It was ironic that Mr. McElroy stated he was taking a stand against experts because someone had to (he didn't say why someone had to), but then he set himself up as an expert when he taught young schoolchildren how big the ark was and where they put the dinosaurs and dinosaur effluent. (My favorite moment was when he called out ""Were there dinosaurs on the ark?"" and the kids called out ""No!"" So he had some work ahead of him converting them to his narrow world view.

The real revelation is one thing political organizers on both sides of every issue will agree on: if you don't think your vote or interest counts for much in a national or statewide election, in a way you are correct.  But as the elections scale down to county or city wide issues, you can make a difference, and letting others do it all can be dangerous and, well-intentioned or otherwise, cause things to be done with a very small percentage of public support or approval.  So attend or at least follow your local council meetings.  We can all be wrong sometimes, but there aren't many awards given out for ignorance or apathy.

This film could have been presented in a hundred different ways from numerous angles, but it is good that at least one version of the story of how history and science in school textbooks can be manipulated or eliminated to support a political viewpoint, any political viewpoint, is out there.",1449014400,5,2690,4.732905982905983
8555384,4,B00AOCDEDY,"There are some people who believe the world is flat and others who believe the world is on a giant tortoise. (During a public lecture when one of the ""tortoise believers"" was asked by the scientist-speaker what the tortoise was on, the woman very confidently said ""It's tortoises all the way down!"") There are also people who deny the Jewish and Ethnic Holocaust of the 1940's. While these three ideas seem contrary and far-fetched to most rational 21st-century minds, the people who believe these notions are very fervent and positive their assertions are correct. Now superimpose some biblical stories relating ideas about the origin of the world and the universe in the place of the flat-world and the giant tortoise, and replace Holocaust Denial with ideas about America's Founding Fathers and The Civil War. In this case, origin myths from the Bible are believed by some people to be the basis for scientific reality and not residing only in religious-spiritual imagination. Yet others, often overlapping, want to believe but also propagate the Founding Fathers created a ""Christian"" nation by minimizing the secular-enlightenment views of many of the founders, such as Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and most importantly Thomas Jefferson, who distrusted the Bible. They have also sought to distort the facts about slavery before America's Civil War, stating the issue wasn't about slavery per se but only state's rights. These are the issues discussed in the documentary ""The Revisionaries"".

During the first decade of the 21st century, the Texas Board of Education reviewed textbook items for the coming years. While most school boards around the country either accept or reject a textbook already published, Texas wields textual power over these books because of their huge market. Textbook writers and publishers are pressured to include and exclude whatever the Texas Board of Education deems proper and improper, even if some items may be contrary to what the writers and publishers intend. Most of the people making the decisions on this board are not necessarily educators, scholars, and scientists in these fields, and yet some, not all, are using their political power to determine curriculum which meshes with their own views.

By the time of the hearings, the board was comprised of members of the religious-right who sought to impose their own ideas about science and history into High School textbooks. A window of opportunity had presented itself for the right-wing Creationists and Historical Revisionists because the Texas High School curriculum was under review. The documentary takes us inside the hearings of the school board and shows how the debates unfolded, revealing a sharply divided public about what material should be part of the books and what shouldn't. In other words, a political body was determining material, as if what is and what is not science and history could be voted on by a committee. Would you want a policeman deciding what is and what is not architecture in an architectural school, especially if you're going to be residing in buildings designed by people graduating from these schools?

Much of the documentary focuses on Don McLeroy, appointed the Texas State Board of Education Chairman by Governor Rick Perry. McLeroy is a self-proclaimed Evangelical and Young-Earth Creationist. While, to his credit, he concedes that Creation-science doesn't belong in science textbooks (at least that's what I gathered from the documentary) he largely rejects the findings of science in regards to Evolution. He also believes dinosaurs and human beings walked the earth at the same time, a notion which has received no proof in science. He also teaches children at evangelical schools. Then why in the world does he want to have a say in the public sphere?

His ideological rival is Ron Wetherington, a professor of anthropology at SMU in Dallas. Wetherington makes the case that unfortunately whether they believe or don't believe in evolution, the Creationists do not understand evolutionary theories, and yet they tout themselves as bona fide experts. One aspect, which I wish was discussed more thoroughly, is that the Darwinian Theory of Evolution is not the idea of common ancestry among species. That notion is regarded as a fact and was not proposed by Darwin alone. Darwin's Theory of Evolution, the mechanism by which species evolve into other species is ""Natural Selection"". And yet, over and over again, the Creationists say that the Theory of Evolution, meaning common ancestry, is ""only"" a theory, in the sense that it's just an unproven idea but we really don't know. Common Ancestry is not the theoretical part. ""Natural Selection"" is the theory, and a theory of this kind in science is a very painstakingly researched series of principles which are thought to well-describe phenomena in nature, in the same way ""Newton's Theory of Gravity"" is not about whether or not gravity exists, but how gravity operates, in this case how large objects attract smaller objects.

An engaging, sometimes confusing, and often enraging series of scenes in which people whose educational background is questionable in regards to disciplines about which they are making huge decisions about education. Should a dentist and a lawyer decide whether or not particular science and history material should or should not be included? Scientists and historians do have full-out drag-out debates on these ideas, and their findings are what should end up in the textbooks. Not a vote by people who are not really in these fields. Otherwise, it is not unforeseeable that a committee could vote to include in a textbook that holds the earth is flat and sitting on a giant tortoise.",1430006400,6,5712,5.170810810810811

Because of Texas massive education system they can determine what goes into texts books. I think that the documentary was well put together and offered a clear point of view. The documentary was pretty bias to the idea that our text books shouldnt contain ideas of Creationism. It showed people who were adamant in their beliefs of Creationism as being crazy and radical. In reality a lot of people in the United States don't fully accept Darwins theory of evolution. Even if I do believe that only scientific theories such as evolution should be put in our text books, the documentary showed the Creationists as being completely crazy. The film used a lot of shots of Don McLeroy being proven wrong and stumbling with his words to make the viewer angry that such a close minded man could determine their childrens education. I think that overall the film gave a great look into the issues in our education system that need to be solved. Its a B- film with great reviews and funny moments.",1413072000,,1111,4.702564102564103

The Dover decision was summed up nicely in this Nova episode:

[...]

You would think that getting smacked down by a federal circuit court judge would be sufficient, but it isn't.  The creationists have simply changed tactics to try and force schools to teach that there are ""flaws"" in the theory of evolution.  This would be to grossly overstate the areas of evolution that need further refinement, but most importantly, this would serve the purpose of trying to put creationism on more equal footing.

The documentary does a great job of profiling the current players and the huge influence that the state of texas wields in this matter.

Naturalistic abiogenesis, the teaching of non-life to life is still just an unconfirmed hypothesis, not even a scientific theory due to lack of evidence, yet it is the basis of evolution and is being taught to every student!

Ultra liberal and anything but ""balanced"", this standard left wing documentary considers the actions of conservatives to be a ""cultural war"" where their ""tactics"" will somehow destroy our children's intelligence. The left need not worry- they've already won the battle, and with nothing but far fetched theories, have legislated God out of our nation. Make no mistake, the issue isn't evolution vs creation- it is atheism vs Christian teachings. The belief in evolution is every bit as much faith based as any other religion. The facts are filtered, distorted, and mostly ignored by the liberal elite. Genetic mutation always leads to disease, not improvement. Adaptation is totally different- A finch with a different beak is still a bird. The physical universe moves toward disorder, not order. (Entropy- second law of thermodynamics). Stating this is not a ""closed system"" is just plain silly, leading one to conclude that we were spawned by aliens, but where did they come from? The fossil record has huge gaps- Where are all the ""transitional states""? The ""missing links"" should be everywhere- in fact, they should be walking around with us today! The theory of ""punctuated equilibrium"" is simply a joke. It was thought up- not based on evidence, but the lack of evidence. Darwin knew this was an unanswerable dilemma, yet it is not even brought up in most classrooms. I am a creationist, if you couldn't already guess- and I am fully aware that are also questions that we find hard to answer; however, there is a key difference. We believe students should be presented with ALL the facts & all the science available, and then be allowed to decide what they believe- not just what those who hate God believe. You see, atheists don't believe in God, and Christians don't believe in atheists.
