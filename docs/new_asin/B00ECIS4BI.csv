5903375,5,B00ECIS4BI,"She wants to watch this one often when she is at our house. She has plenty of others to choose from but this is a favorite. She even sometimes picks it over Max and Ruby now!  She often acts out some of the story lines too....carried a big rock around the yard one day pretending it was ""a treasure"" just like in the DVD. And she often ""goes across the meadow in search of food""",1400198400,3,378,4.04
5903376,5,B00ECIS4BI,We saw this late one night on the Disney Channel and couldn't believe they made a cartoon about my daughter and my husbands favorite book together.  Now they love watching the cartoon together.  So glad I found this on Amazon!,1396396800,2,226,4.625
5903377,5,B00ECIS4BI,"This was a great video collection for my daughter.  She really enjoyed the cuteness of the characters.  It's one of her go to movies.  I chose this movie b/c she really liked the original book.  We has since also purchased the Friendship Adventures, which she also loves.  Easy going movies.  No strong themes or words.  I even enjoy watching it as well.",1393804800,3,354,4.612903225806452
5903378,5,B00ECIS4BI,"I gave this to my 3 girls (ages 8, 6, and 1.5) for Valentines Day.  They all curled up on the couch together and watched with big smiles and giggles.  All of the stories are all joy, happiness, politeness, empathy, good choices, being a good friend, helping out, thoughtfulness, and positive problem solving.  If everything our kids watched was like this, it would be a happier world indeed.

Hidden Treasure - discover the wonders and treasure in the nature around you

Finder's Keepers - making the right and empathetic choice when you accidentally take something that belongs to someone else

It's Okay - handling accidents and apologies with grace and respectfulness

Slip Slop Slide - learning to laugh at ourselves, handling embarrassment, practicing to figure something out

Inside Day -  Hibernation, Appreciating the Winter season, being silly

Where's Little Redwood Fox? - playing games, being tricky and clever, giving compliments, stay curious, think, think, think

Snowflake - The fun and beauty of snow, uniqueness of snowflakes, brainstorming together as a group,",1392336000,,1079,5.251461988304094
5903379,5,B00ECIS4BI,"My daughter and I watch this show every evening, when we can catch it, on the Disney Junior channel. It's absolutely adorable. It's quiet, soothing, not loud and obnoxious. It's our ""nighty night"" time show. Helps her wind down. I searched high and low for this on dvd, in the ""american"" english dub, and kept coming up empty. Then FINALLY, here it is. I love the story, ""Guess how much I love you"" and this program is super sweet. It showcases curiosity and friendship as well as the bond between parent and child. I hope to see more dvd releases of this show.",1389225600,2,561,4.456310679611651
5903380,5,B00ECIS4BI,"Very gentle and sweet dvd for little ones. Simple story lines, suitable for toddlers and preschoolers. Lovely animation. Much more gentle (and young) than Beatrix Potter stories - the predator animals in these stories are all friends with the prey.",1388448000,,248,5.225
5903381,5,B00ECIS4BI,"My son loves this collection of episodes.  He smiles the whole time it's on, laughs and repeats some words that he hears (new words and expressions for him). My husband and I like that the episodes are short, so we can limit our son's screen time. We are looking forward to the release of the next set in February.",1388102400,,314,4.322033898305085
5903382,5,B00ECIS4BI,"Finally, the long awaited DVD release of Guess How Much I Love You has come! A year ago I stumbled upon this show, by chance on Disney Jr. channel. With beautiful non-cgi animation, lacking needless and void of meaning sing-alongs, this program is like a throwback to 90s Nick Jr. and Maurice Sendak's beloved Little Bear. Unlike most modern children's programming that feels like a time filler, meant for mere in the moment entertainment, this program is very relaxed. Moving at a pace to comfort each 10-11 minute episode as needed.
This DVD release features 7 episodes, with 6 of them Winter-themed, and 1 Autumn themed. The lone Autumn episode, ""Finders Keepers"" is about Little Grey Squirrel and very special acorns. This episode deals with sharing and lying. The titular episode of the DVD, ""Hidden Treasures"", is about Little Nutbrown Hare discovering the beauty in all objects, including ordinary rocks. The lesson is that beauty is on the inside, for even ordinary objects are a hidden treasure! ""Where's Little Redwood Fox"" is an episode about snow-seeking, a game of hide-and-seek using snowprints. More or less, the lesson is that with wits, you can win a game, haha! ""Snowflake"", is about Little Nutbrown Hare finding the most special snowflake, while Little Field Mouse and Little Redwood Fox help him give it to him. A lesson that the greatest gift is love. ""Inside Day"", is about Little Field Mouse and Little Nutbrown Hare imitating Little Grey Squirrel in hibernating. The lesson is of patience, and enjoying time of the present.
The episode ""It""s Okay"", is about Little Nutbrown Hare building a pinecone tree (a pine tree made of pinecones.) The lesson is about accepting that accidents happen.
Lastly, ""Sliop, Slop, Slide"", is about Otter teaching how to ice-skate, while Little Nutbrown Hare struggles. Two lessons here, accepting differences of others, and overcoming fear to do what you desire.
All seven episodes are very peaceful, and great for anytime, day or night! As I wrote before, and cannot fail to repeat, beautifully animated! The reflection of the stars on a frosty river in ""Hidden Treasures"" being just one example. Love this program, and anticipate more future releases!",1386806400,5,2208,5.068681318681318
5903383,2,B00ECIS4BI,I love the show Guess How Much I Love You & so does my daughter but this was completely different from the other DVDs that I've bought. The narration is now in a English accent & it doesn't even sound the same.,1457740800,6,210,4.023809523809524
5903384,5,B00ECIS4BI,"The original ""Guess How Much I Love You"" book has been on my daughter's shelf ever since she was born. We used to ""read"" it before she was talking and have continued to have it be a chosen favorite during our bedtime routine. That said- my family was very excited to see our favorite character Little Nut Brown Hare come to life in this animated series. The episodes on this disk are all wonderful stories that I thought really reinforce the value of solving problems and persevering through hardship. Nut Brown Hare and his friends are great problem solvers- and it is something I am currently trying to re-enforce in my 5 year old so I found this disk incredibly timely for us as well. The Busy as a Bee episode was our favorite- we really loved the story and talked a lot about how important keeping our promises is. I have found these stories to actually create conversation with my 5 year old and I love that! We will watch this many times I am sure!!!",1457654400,,957,4.4124293785310735
5903385,5,B00ECIS4BI,"The animated DVD, Guess How Much I Love You: The Song of Spring is really wonderful. It is super cute and has lots of life lessons to learn. I especially like the main character, Little Nutbrown Hare because he is always so curious. If there is a problem he tries to figure it out.
There are 7 different stories on this DVD based on the classic books by Sam McBratney. In each of the stories there is a mystery to solve and important lessons to learn. Every episode is about growing up and learning life lessons by friends helping each other.

One of the episodes I especially like is the Busy as a Bee story. In this fun episode Little Nutbrown Hare makes a promise to help his father but really wants to play with his friend, Little Field Mouse. Little Nutbrown Hare learns a valuable life lesson; in this case, even when you may want to do something else like play with your friends, if you have already made a promise it is important to keep that promise. Another episode I really like is Little Green Worm. Here we learn some science facts such as discovering how a caterpillar turns into a butterfly. We also learn some cool science vocabulary like chrysalis, which means cocoon.

The message of this film is to feel free to explore, don't be scared and how having a friend at your side helps you get through anything. I love that this message is told through heartwarming stories about friendship, family science and more.

I think the character voices are amazing and fit the characters just perfectly. The animation is simple, but very believable. The animated characters are adorable and all the stories take place in an animated forest and meadow that are beautifully colorful.

I think viewers will love this DVD released by N Circle Entertainment because, overall there is a lot of heart, great messages and lots of educational lessons. It is a fun and an entertaining DVD. N Circle offers a nicely package product and they even include a fun craft activity. The animation and stories are simple enough for little ones to understand and, at the same time, offer good learning lessons for older kids. I give this DVD 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 4 to 8. Check it out!

5903386,5,B00ECIS4BI,My 2 year old daughter could not get enough of 'Guess How Much I love you'. We have read the book in the past but having it in DVD form was a new experience for her. She was able to watch and connect with the story even more and especially loved the transformation of the little caterpillar.

5903387,5,B00ECIS4BI,"What a sweet sweet childrens movie! The book ""Guess How Much I Love You"" is one of my favorite books to read my daughter so I was excited to see that they had made DVDs in its likeness. My daughter laughed and smiled the entire way through- the little gray squirrel being her favorite character! One of the greatest things about this dvd is that it is focused on positive relationships and love- two things all children need! Way to go NCircle!",1456444800,,444,4.426829268292683
5903388,5,B00ECIS4BI,"I think the Guess How Much I Love You series is seriously the best animated collection ever!
We saved every tv episode on DVR forever until I could finally find them here on Amazon and now on Netflix.
All the stories are fun, positive, and friendly.  I like that I don't have to worry about my kids seeing any fighting, violence, crude humor, scary themes, etc.  All the stories are just about friends, family, having fun, and appreciating the world that God created for us!  Each ends with Big Nutbrown Hare and Little Nutbrown Hare telling each other how much they love the other!  I love how sweet, grateful, and uplifting these stories are!

8603879,5,B00ECIS4BI,"Guess How Much I Love You: The Song of Spring was an instant hit with my 4 year old son! We have read the book many times, but until recently I wasn't aware there was a television show based on the bestselling book! I'm so glad that Big and Little Nutbrown Hare get to continue on bringing enjoyment to children through their many adventures on this adorable show. This particular release has a running time of approximately 80 minutes and contains 7 episodes. The stories included on this disc are Little Green Worm, Too Big/Too Small, The Lucky Egg, Echo Game, Busy as a Bee, Where are my Acorns? & The Song of Spring. I really appreciate the fact that each short episode has a lesson to be learned such as accepting differences, making new discoveries, the importance of keeping a promise and finding true friendship. I would say this show is best suited for ages 2-6. This release even included a cute and simple flower craft activity that was a nice bonus. My little guy is excited to see more of this sweet series!
