8532289,4,B008Y1YJPE,"Hes the man everyone loves to hateexcept one guy. Starting out as an illiterate track walker for the railroad, Tom Garner rises to railroad magnate status initiated by his wifes ambition. In the process, he becomes a different mana hated, misguided power-lover. This soap opera is a fascinating character study. Spencer Tracy morphs from likable to hated throughout the film, and genuinely portrays both sides of his character. It is gratifying, too, to see silent film star Colleen Moore faithfully portray her role as Garners wife. This is a good story with good acting from established and emerging stars. I highly recommend this film.",1529020800,,638,5.144230769230769

8532291,3,B008Y1YJPE,"The Power and The Glory, 1933 film

It begins in a church for a funeral service for Thomas Garner, president of the Chicago and Southwestern Railroad. One man is glad he croaked! A business associate looks at an old picture. The man died a suicide. One strike killed 400 workers; he dumped his wife for a younger woman. We learn about his boyhood friendship with Henry. Later in life Thomas is president or a large railroad and wants to expand by buying a smaller railroad. The Board follows his lead. Tom is dictatorial and knows about the stock market. In his early life Tom was illiterate at twenty. A schoolteacher educated him. The owner of that small railroad shows up with his daughter. Toms son was expelled from college (drinking). Dad finds a job for him as a bookkeeper. Mother disagrees with this treatment. Sally wanted Tom to be somebody and get more education.

He did. Sally went to work as a track walker to support her husband as he got an education. Tom is attracted to Miss Borden. His wife wants them to go to Europe to be alone together. Tom tells Sally about his new love. Sally walks outside and meets a trolley! Henry discusses their life. Tom gets a promotion and a raise, Sally tells him about a baby. Tom shows up at a strike meeting to tell them to work or quit! They will be replaced by 5,000 men from Chicago, the State Militia will enforce order. There was violence at the strike, 406 men were killed. Tom makes a surprise visit home to see his new wife and overhears her telephone conversation. He is shocked by her comment he looks just like you. Tom cant concentrate on business now. His new wife tells him the truth. Can he handle the news? Then there is a loud noise that alarms Henry! Henry tells his wife what happened.

This film was produced before the Hollywood Production Code of 1934 which censored stories like this: divorce, adultery, and suicide. It also avoided labor struggles (which were often in the news). There were some exceptions, such as the 1931 movie Frankenstein which passed censorship. You won't see the original 1931 The Maltese Falcon on broadcast TV, it had more believable characters. Note how the president of that small railroad pimped his daughter to stay in office! Can you compare this story to Citizen Kane?",1419811200,,2278,4.619753086419753

8532295,5,B008Y1YJPE,"This is a relatively short film of 1 1/4 hours that has the feel of a pre-code Warner Brothers crime film - it moves quickly and crams into it, a lot of incidents that highlight a railroad tycoons rise and fall with the film openning with his funeral and highlighting the revulsion his family, friends and co-workers feel for him - even in death !! So the question is why do they despise him and how did he get to the point where all his worldly success doesn't keep him from committing suicide ? Spencer Tracy plays Tom Garner a man who comes up from nothing by a singleminded ruthlessness to achieve wealth and influence and how in his hell bent quest for power he loses everyone and everything he loves. This movie is perhaps best known as one of Preston Sturges earliest screen writers credits and as a precursor of Orson Welles 1941 classic ""Citizen Kane"". Sturges screenplay {9 years before Kane} utilizes in it's basic storyline of the rise and fall of a ""larger than life"" tycoon, a flashback narrative structure in which a voice over narrator reveals Garner's mindset at the end of his life and how past incidents, influences and hubris brought Tom from poverty to success, disaster then death. Did Welles and his screen writer Herman Mankerwitz take a ""long hard look"" at Sturges screenplay as a prototype for ""Citizen Kane? Spencer Tracy is excellent and he is so young, slim and fit - only 33 years old with eyes flashing, teeth bared as he delivers his dialouge with verve and bite - he is simply marvelous. Colleen Moore {a 1920s silent film superstar}in one of her last screen appearances gives a nice performance as the ""good wife"" and Helen Vinson {who never quite made it to top stardom} is surprising effective as the ""not so good"" bored second wife"" who looks for ""Kickier Kicks"" in the wrong place with horrible consequences. Preston Sturges screenplay is compelling. Director William K Howard is content to let the performers and storyline dominate the proceedings and ace camera man James Wong Howe positions his camera perfectly for the intimate and big sceens of the film. The narrative flashback juxtapostioning Garners current and past choices that  make where his life goes, the search for success and what he missed in all his relationships when ""right in front of his nose"" are the themes of this excellent film that I give a rating of 5 stars.",1367280000,14,2374,4.706730769230769
