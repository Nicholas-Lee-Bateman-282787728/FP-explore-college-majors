8039093,5,B00065Q28I,"i liked this it was a good start on bass i have been messing with bass for a while and have learned i like to slap and pop

while watching this he teachs his way of slapping which i didn't much like anyways i learned it im not going to diss without trying it out first so i did and relized i still use my method but when i us the lower 1-2-3 strings i use his method  to get a brighter louder slap

im not done with all the lessons i don't watch the whole dvd at once i go step by step until i master it all but so far very good instructor very basic will build up speed and strength and help teach individuality i highly recomend",1236643200,,630,3.830769230769231
