8210207,5,B000F6ZFOU,Not a real popular band but one that has a rabid following.  For an underground band this is an amazing find.  It doesn't have the production values of a big act but the ICA concert has good sound quality and the performance is awesome.  The other concert included had something wrong with the sound mix but it was also a good performance.  If you are a Queen Adreena/Katie Jane fan you must see this.  If you like the music of Hole or that genre you will like it.,1390089600,,464,4.2272727272727275
