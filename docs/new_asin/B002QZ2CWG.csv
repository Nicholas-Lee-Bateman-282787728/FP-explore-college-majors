Soft spoken but firm, Dr. Orloff is witty and to the point... it's your choice, if you want to be free and enjoy every second of your 'now'... some things you already know others not so clearly - she candidly lays it all out. The question the viewer needs to present to himself after viewing video: Do I choose to be emotionally free or not?? You decide ;) !!!",1495497600,,463,4.213483146067416
8378156,5,B002QZ2CWG,"I love Dr. Orloff's message!  I teach a positive psychology graduate course and I play this video every semester (and I use reflective processing questions and journaling afterwards).  My students love to quote her and talk about the ""emotional vampires"" in their lives.  She does such a nice job of giving the viewer the permission to let go of the emotions that can dominate our lives and make us miserable.  I buy and preview a lot of self-help videos (and it's frustrating because there is a lot of garbage out there- and you never know what you're going to get).  I would rank her video in the top five (out of dozens and dozens that I've seen).  Watching this video is a treat and a tremendously reflective reminder about what's really important in life.  She is funny, engaging, intelligent, and her stories and anecdotes are not only emotionally moving, but practical and useful.  She comes from a clinical perspective and her message really rings with students of psychology.  Many have immediately gone out and bought her books after seeing her.  Her messages are easy to remember, meaningful, and stay with you.",1435190400,,1122,4.827225130890052

8378160,4,B002QZ2CWG,"Dr. Orloff provides some very valid points on how one can improve the quality of one's life.  Although the setting is somewhat uninspiring, her words are quite eloquent.  (BTW, picture on DVD cover is not Dr. Orloff.)  She is a fashionably dress lady with great stories and messages.",1295049600,4,283,4.854166666666667
