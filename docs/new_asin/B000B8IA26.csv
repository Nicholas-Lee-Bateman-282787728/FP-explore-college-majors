2408432,5,B000B8IA26,"Well, where do I start? I'm not living out on the street but if you see the Movie Ricky and Pete you will hear that amazing song that I have these childhood memories of singing along while in the car.

Ricky and Pete is a great Aussie movie that should have done better back in 1988 when it was released in cinemas around Australia. Perhaps set back by economic woes of the late 80's in Australia this movie is worth a look and a buzz to watch Ricky and Pete look for that little something in life to fill that empty hole that can sneak into all our life's at some time or another.

Great comedy, great Music, a great infamous Australian film worth a look if you want to take a step back in time to 1988 and see how great Aussie pictures can be.

Follow Ricky and Pete from Melbourne to Mount Isa and see how they manage to win the hearts and admiration of the locals doing the things they love and how they remind us of being able to chase our dreams if we dare take a step forward.

A little warning to parents, there is a nudity scene in this film,  one to be aware of before any young ones watch this film. Mild use of swear words to be expected.

I would recommend this film for anyone who has seen it in the past and has finally stumbled across it here at Amazon and anyone who like alternative comedy and 1980's movies mixed with adventure and sweat and tears.",1371513600,,1367,4.139622641509434
2408433,5,B000B8IA26,"Pete is a wayward soul, a brilliant mechanical inventor, and likely to get thrown in jail for trying to avenge his mother's injury (caused by the local police chief).  Rikky is a stable and accomplished geologist as well as a singer who plays guitar and sings at a local bar.  To save her brother, she gets a job in the Outback and drags Pete away from Melbourne to safety.  What they find is a wild set of characters, a mine that could very well make them a great deal of money and more trouble.  Can the love of his sister and new girlfriend Flossie save Pete?

Rikky and Pete is raucous fun and just an all-around good story.  We watch it regularly and it's always good for lots of laughs.  There are a couple of scenes with nudity and a little language, but nothing I'd keep my 17-year-old from viewing.",1242604800,4,807,4.34
2408434,5,B000B8IA26,this is a great movie to show you what it is to live in the australian outback,1212364800,,78,3.6470588235294117
2408435,4,B000B8IA26,"If the first five minutes of this film don't grab you then you probably don't like cinema.  From the opening frames of Pete's newspaper delivery truck to ""Evil Donald"" and the local Keystone Cops, you cannot help but laugh out loud.

The DVD is labeled full screen, but it is letterboxed on screen.  HOWEVER it appears it was not mastered from the film but from the laserdisc master, like the upcoming ""original"" Star Wars DVD people are complaining about. It just does not seem to have full DVD resolution.  The colors are vibrant however, and the film deserves to be seen, even if ""on laserdisc.""  At least you don't have to flip the disc over!",1152057600,,646,4.582608695652174
2408436,1,B000B8IA26,"Yet again a truly great film is treated to a full screen dvd transfer. Americans want this but the rest of the world does not. Give us WIDESCREEN,and respect the cinema fans of the world.",1133136000,7,187,4.371428571428571
2408437,5,B000B8IA26,"Parts of this movie had me laughing myself off the couch.
It is an understated and unpretentious film, basically a love story or a coming of age story - I guess a mixture of both.
I had to give it 5 stars, it is not a 5 star movie even though Tetchie Agbayani looked totally delicious, but I figured the other reviewer gave it 4 stars, now it averges out at 4 1/2 - just about right.
Well worth seeing. It is part of my library and I bring it out as a special treat for company that I know can appreciate it.",1058400000,4,508,3.941747572815534
2408438,4,B000B8IA26,"This movie is a typical Aussie sleeper. It starts out slow, with laffs at the expenes of the local police, and then moves out of town and North to ??????? All the characters are excellently cast in their roles and provide continuity in the trek North for gold and adventure. If you enjoyed the first ""Crocodile Dundee"" you will definitely enjoy this.",1029110400,6,350,4.661290322580645

8083313,1,B000B8IA26,"I ordered this finally after having loved the movie from many years ago. I was excited to have a copy. Unfortunately, it appears this item is an Amazon-created disc manufactured in their Lexington, KY facility (this is stated in very fine print above the UPC barcode on the back of the case: ""Manufactured by Amazon.com kydc Lexington, KY""). My copy arrived with only the DVD menu burned onto the disc and only the ""Play Movie"" option present. After testing it on multiple devices and on a PC, I found the video track wasn't present and had to return the DVD as defective. Since I like the movie, I've requested a replacement and I'm hoping the next copy actually works.

Update: 3 strikes... the replacement was exactly like the first. After wrangling with customer service, I received a refund and third, free, exact duplicate of the other two. I also telephoned the studio, however they seemed largely uninterested and said they were unable to do anything about this. I was referred back to Amazon who ""notified their technical support"" about the issue, but evidently it hasn't been corrected. The studio did confirm this is an ""on-demand"" disc from Amazon, but said they therefore have no control over it. This may likely mean this DVD is now out of print. I am extremely disappointed.

In the end: this was a disrespectful treatment of the movie and a total disappointment to the customer. A clearly failed attempt to further widen profit margins at the expense of the consumer.",1487548800,,1483,4.811764705882353

8083318,5,B000B8IA26,"Oddball flick, but I've liked it for along time.",1428364800,,48,4.444444444444445
8083319,4,B000B8IA26,"A surprisingly entertaining little Australian movie.  Offbeat but charming.  The story concerns two siblings Rikky a good talented singer and geologist and her highly intelligent, but slightly wacky, brother who set off in their mom's car into the outback to make their fortune.  Rikky actually just wants to get Pete away from her domineering fathers influence.  His acting out against authorities is starting to get our of control.  Although they are from a wealthy family, Rikky has no doubts at all that they can get by on their own.  A great little gem of a film.",1408579200,,568,4.864583333333333
