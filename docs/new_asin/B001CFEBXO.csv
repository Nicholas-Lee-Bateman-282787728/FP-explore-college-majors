8536300,3,B001CFEBXO,"The video indicates there is a website to download the printable instructions for the various activities. I especially wanted the theater building instructions, as I believe the video tutorial on the dvd was hazy and not direct about how to put it together at all. I've been trying for a year or two to get to this fabled ""website"" as time allows, but it always tells me I'm timed out and the connection is lost. I've got a pretty recent computer, so this is probably not the problem. So, I tried to use search engines to find ""it"".  (the printable instructions) but I never can get anywhere there, either. I'm very frustrated on this issue. However, the dvd does have some generally useful information. and there is a blog-  but no instructions- (the links don't work.) also, the puppet patterns need to be printed out, too, to get the shapes right. What's the deal, activity tv? Ultimately, we've watched it 4-5 times, but unable to do any of the activities. Mind-numbing...",1433289600,,976,4.701754385964913
8536301,5,B001CFEBXO,"I like the ideas for various types of puppets, especially the sock puppet.  There were also ideas on how to make the puppets come alive.  For example, it was nice for my kids to see that the puppet should move it's mouth while the puppeteer is talking.  My favorite part of the DVD was the instructions for the puppet theatre using a wardrobe box.  After watching the DVD a few times, I was able to construct it.  My kids helped decorate the stage.  As a family, we put on a puppet show for our peers and it was a hit!  Many of these activities were suitable as craft projects to work with my 5 and 7 year olds.",1401062400,,611,4.127118644067797
