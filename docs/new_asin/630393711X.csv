7855857,2,630393711X,"This movie I have to give some credit- it tried. Dear God, you can tell it tried. It almost tried too hard. It ended up sucking none the less. The whole thing has a 'late-night-low--budget-movie feel to it. It revolves around Petey, an ex-smuggler who spent most of his eairly life in prision because of a mix-up with his older brother Matt (played by Scott Cohen, my favorite actor). Petey (Lou Dimond Phillips) is being 'checked out' by a female reporter (who he ends up sleeping with, oh wow, bet you didn't see that one coming). His brother is partners with a dirty cop named Doc, and that's all I care to talk about. Matt get's killed and there's smuggling, more dirty cops, gun fire, and more dirty cops. I think this was a 'I'm-a-nobody-actor-and-I-need-a-salary-NOW kind of thing for all involved in it. I really like Scott Cohen ('10th Kingdom,' 'Gia,') but PLEASE!? What were they thinking??? Oonly a good movie if you like the main stars.",974678400,3,949,4.688622754491018
