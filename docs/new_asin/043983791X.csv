7788068,5,043983791X,perfect mix of story videos.  I had been looking for our own copy of Good Night Gorilla (checked out from the library numerous times) but didn't like the mix of other stories.  Found this as a resale - it was a no brainer because the other stories are good too.  Good Night Gorilla is a sweet story - the best at helping settle down for the night when everyone is wound tight and books aren't going to work as the bed time routine.  Arrived quickly and it plays with no problems - description from seller was accurate.,1400889600,,518,4.309278350515464

7788070,5,043983791X,This video is actually books with a animated format. It is a great way to introduce your child to books. Each book is about 3-5 minutes in length. Not an exciting format for real young children but a very good format for school age.,1157328000,,232,4.295454545454546
