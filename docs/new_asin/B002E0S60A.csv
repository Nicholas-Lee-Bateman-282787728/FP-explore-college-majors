8366678,3,B002E0S60A,"Slow Exploitation Cinema starters. As the movies' unfold, all the things that you would expect to happen, do.

Some good old time small southern community humor. A good choice for fans of the original American Graffiti (1973).

These films are worth checking out only if you like the Exploitation genre.",1383523200,,303,5.04
8366679,4,B002E0S60A,"This exploitation double feature is one of the better entries into the Grindhouse Collection. Although these are B-grade movies, there is a tangible likeability for Teenage Graffiti and Teenage Mother. These two stories serve as cautionary tales of the responsibilities involved in growing up and acting out in mature ways. Every person should be responsible for their actions, which the movies poignantl share than many people act first and think later. Although a majority of the characters develop into individuals with less than reputable morals, there is a redeeming storyline that should be taken note of by viewers. It is simply to be a person that does not compromise who they are as a indiviual for anyone else. I recommend this double feature for an audience that can grasp the true intent of the story and respect it by learning something from viewig these movies.",1360195200,,875,5.041379310344827
8366680,5,B002E0S60A,"I've been a fan of these double feature discs for a couple of years  now.  Both of these films work ok togethor ,but the main reason you should purchase this is for the uncut version of TEENAGE MOTHER.  TEENAGE GRAFFITI is a bit too slow and melodramatic for my taste but it has a few spots of nudity that will make exploitation fans smile.  Extras include trailers and an audio commentary by Cinema Head Cheese thats very funny but bound to rub some viewers the wrong way. Overall a great package. Reccommended",1280620800,4,511,4.521739130434782
