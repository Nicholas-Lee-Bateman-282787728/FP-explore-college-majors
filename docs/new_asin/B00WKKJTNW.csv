8713655,3,B00WKKJTNW,"There is lot of talking in When Evening Falls on Bucharest or Metabolism. A film director is having an affair with his leading lady on a shoot in Bucharest. They talk a great deal although it might be more accurate to say that he talks a great deal. He has theories about everything and wants her to be interested. They have sex once behind a closed door so that the camera can only ""hear"" the proceedings. Ostensibly, this is an investigation into the complexities of falling hard for someone who will never take you seriously. Then there is the question of deception inevitably to be taken up in the context of adultery. The film is presented in long takes during which the characters got on my nerves as much as they clearly got on each others. So there is emotional reality conveyed here. But, to my tastes, the colloquy is way too arid and austere. Art House lovers can expect to be treated to a film of technical interest but most others will prefer something with a little more flesh on the bone.",1434240000,3,1003,4.4863387978142075
