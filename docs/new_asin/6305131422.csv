8233357,3,6305131422,"This film is my all-time favorite Jet Li film. Jet's son in the film is set to be the next Jet Li and is an awesome powerhouse in his own right. This movie has some wonderful fighting sequences, though it does seem to drag in a couple spots, when trying to establish the relationships. I didn't get the English version ""The Enforcer"" because the title has nothing to do with the film (it sounds like a rejected Steven Segal title that a studio exec came up with) and that the dubs are a little cheesy. However, after watching this DVD, I'd have to say I prefer that version. The video quality is barely better than VHS video, and the audio is very tinny, no highs, no lows, even on a 5.1 system, it sounds like it was all recorded in a tin can. The disc seems to be recorded with little to no quality control. Putting the disc in my computer's DVD-ROM drive, the title did not show up as ""My Father is a Hero"", it showed up as ""Untitled"". Also, none of the DVD functions are labelled. Selecting subtitles does not give you the choice of English or Chinese (simplified) or Chinese (traditional), it gives you subtitle 1, subtitle 2 and subtitle 3. You get to play around with it to find out. The menus are static images with a single word in English and Chinese for each page/function. It looks like this disc was put together with no care about how it will look. All that I could forgive. The problem that made me return this disc to the store is the subtitles. Chinese film translators, understand this: CONSULT A NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKER. I hope they heard that. Every single scene in this movie is filled with lines that either make you go ""hunh?"" or make you laugh. When Kung Wei tells his boss that he has to go see his son perform, his boss tells him: ""If you do that, beware your brain!"" Yeah, I'll have to watch out for my brain there, jefe. The subtitles were so horribly/hilariously done, that it was so distracting I couldn't even watch the whole thing through. It's a travesty that this was done to my favorite Jet Li movie. Until some company releases a proper hybrid English/Chinese DVD with a readable/reasonable translation, I guess I have to stick with the cheesy, Hollywoodified dubbed version. Sigh.",988070400,9,2216,4.474074074074074
8233358,5,6305131422,"Ok, first of all if you want to see the dubbed version don't buy the dvd where he is standing with his back towards you. That has only a chinese language option. Now all the people that said this movie only has like  three fight scenes don't know what they are talking about. Sure there were  only three fight scenes that were 15 minutes long but the rest were good  all the same. The action is great and the last fight scene is sick when Jet  has those two stick and when he and the kid are fighting together. So  basically what I am saying is buy this movie it is really cool and worth  having.",957830400,,596,4.094827586206897
8233359,3,6305131422,"The Chinese title to this one was extremely deceptive:  ""Letters to Father"".  It suggests a full-out drama and, to its credit, The Enforcer (an entirely inaccurate title, actually) does contain more dramatic elements and better acting than the usual martial-arts/action  fare.
What we have here is a true polarization:  Truly amazing moments  juxtaposed with extreme clumsiness at spots.  The ultra-sentimentality of  the script is beaten to death time after time in this movie, and sometimes  even a pretty good actor falters because of the overkill.  Anita Mui isn't  very well used in this movie; the part when she breaks down and cries at  the death of the mother is completely unbelievable, because the story  didn't sufficiently set up the rapport between the women.  Xie Mao, who  plays the child, is unusually watchable as an actor thanks to some  less-than-obvious choices (when his mother dies, he goes for an attempt to  be strong which works quite well), and he moves well (though some shots of  him in action appear to be sped up).  But too much sentimentality still  ends up hurting the character.
The action sequences and fight  choreography are wonderful, without most of the vices that plagued Fist of  Legend (slow-mo being the most important one).  There *is* too much camera  trickery at some points -- overheads, triple cuts, etc. -- but in this one  it's acceptable.  Less so are the incredibly disorienting ellipses in the  storyline, and the incredibly bad acting of Yu Rong Guang, the lead  villain, entirely without charisma or humanity, just another smart-cracking  bad guy with no depth or real power.  When will action writers realize that  a villain works better when he's smart and likeable to a degree?  This  villain is a typical Wong Jing villain (Wong Jing being the tasteless  exploitation producer/director who came up with this story), and completely  grating to watch.
Jet Li does well in this movie, the character tapping  into the more brooding side to his cinematic persona, but for nearly 20  minutes his character leaves the film, resulting in a temporary  void.
Worth a look for slam-bang action sequences, but could've been  much, much more given better above-the-line talent and less sentimental raw  material.",957225600,12,2257,5.079452054794521
8233360,3,6305131422,"I have the Chinese import version which is titled my father is a hero. I prefer a movie which has subtitles rather than dubbing. I rate the import 4 1/2 stars. The transfer from film of the recently dubbed movies seems much  better than the imports. More Hong Kong films are being dubbed but I wish  they had the choice for multi-language.
There is a good balance of drama  and action in this film. The acting is decent but the story is more  believable than other HK films.",956880000,,474,4.3522727272727275
8233361,2,6305131422,"Jet Li and the kid in thes movie are good... when they actually fight which isn't a lot at all. The Kid has a fight scene, and Jet has one at the end..., and aside from the opening that's all there is. I know overall it's  a good movie, but I usually just watch Jet Li for fighting... which this  movie lacks.",947203200,7,309,3.967741935483871
