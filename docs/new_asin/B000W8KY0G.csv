2963128,3,B000W8KY0G,"It was good to see the old (Original) Outer Limits episodes.  Unfortunately, there is still significant improvement needed in the double sided DVDs.  Volume TWO was NOT watchable for the episode ""Behold,ECK!"".  I was able to work over the disk and get the other three episodes to play on that side of the disk.  I wish the series was available on single sided disks.  TOO bad!",1199145600,23,376,4.636363636363637
2963129,4,B000W8KY0G,"The Outer Limits has always been my favorite TV show which I was glad to finally have on DVD. I would give this product 5 stars if all of the episodes made the transfer to digital well, but ""The Man Who Was Never Born"" ""Nightmare"" ""Second Chance"" ""Moonstone"" and ""The Special One"" have scenes which look snowy. Also some of the problems with the original MGM/UA set still exist in some discs. Hopefully in time, 20th Century Fox will address all these issues because this series deserves better.",1198368000,13,495,4.636363636363637
2963130,1,B000W8KY0G,"Update here too. I found two of the sides in volume 3 were defective. Amazon makes it easy to return and get a replacement. I was a little uneasy thinking the replacement would be the same, but they have to wait for a new shipment, and J from NY said that MGM was aware of the problem. I am sorry to have to return the entire 3 volume set as 45 of the episodes seem fine, although who knows.

My Original review message here:

I had just started to watch this series from the beginning and was enjoying it when I read a review saying Vol 3 disc 2 still doesn't work. Well, I put mine disc into 2 different players and neither of them would play this disc. There are 6 double sided discs in this package Plus an extra disc in the Volume 3 Disc 2 box which has and extra disc that has only ""The Probe"" on side B, and The Inheritors pt 2 and Keeper of the Purple Twilight"" on side A

It's quite confusing, but instead of getting 49 hour episodes, we get 47. I'm hoping MGM or whoever will make amends to thous of us who have defaulty discs, but I'm not holding my breath",1196294400,23,1067,4.04739336492891

(Remember when they even sold cards - like baseball cards - with gum in them where the cards showed the creatures?!)  The stories were wonderful and very advanced for it's time.  Although now we're used to all kinds of special effects, you just can't beat watching the olden-day way of doing them (with little or no budget!).. and they were fun!

One of my favorite episodes attests to this - the one about all things coming to a halt while the X-15 is making its approach.

The show, I've never been a fan of.  Only maybe 4 or 5 of the original 49 episodes are ones that I enjoy watching.  At one hour, the show is just too slow-moving and the plot lines are seldom interesting.  O.L. is unfairly compared to Twilight Zone and other shows...it really did stand on its own as an innovative show from a cinematographical perspective, and the kinds of stories it presented.  They had a number of good actors as well, many of whom went on to become very famous in their own right.  But, as I say, at 53 minutes per episode, not many of which are really all that interesting, it's a very hard show for me to watch.",1437609600,3,783,4.285714285714286

My set (double sided), has issues in that several episodes now fail to play or lock up on a variety of upper tier bd players. The disks themselves are not scratched and like all others in my collection, handled with care. The transfers as well, are second..no third rate. This series deserved much better!

2963168,4,B000W8KY0G,"TOL came out around the time The Twilight Zone was coming to an end, and while the shows were definitely similar, Zone remains far superior and better stands the test of time. That's not to say TOL wasn't worthwhile; its blend of gothic horror and sci-fi themes is certainly compelling, and it definitely helps that many episodes are shot beautifully. True, the special effects may look archaic now, but the designs for the aliens, monsters and other weird things are incredible, and seeing them filmed with deep, luscious shadows is a thing of beauty. Guest stars such as Robert Duvall, Robert Culp, Martin Landau and David McCallum liven things up as well. It's interesting to see guest stars who appeared in Zone show up in TOL, and many of them also starred or guest starred on the original Star Trek a few years later.

That's not to say it's all good though - there are definitely duds even in the first season, and while I won't call the second a total waste (Soldier and Demon with a Glass Hand are memorable standouts), the loss of the original producers is definitely felt. The show became pedestrian and felt rushed, perhaps even more a testament to how much better it had been early on.

Other standout episodes:
- The Man Who Was Never Born (a dreamy episode about time travel and the possible destruction of mankind not with weapons but with a disease, and with one of the most heartbreaking endings you'll ever see)
- The Chameleon (a human infiltrates an alien ship to see what they're up to, and finds a part of himself in them)
- Cold Hands, Warm Heart (okay, William Shatner overacts to the extreme here, but he makes this episode!)",1412380800,2,1651,4.631399317406143

that MGM Home Entertainment has treated this 1963-1965 TV series,is dangerously insulting! as DVDs became the norm over a decade plus ago,like many of you,i waited a long time for MGM to finally release the series on DVD,,and in Fall 2002,that became
a reality-or so it seemed! what many consumers got for the price we paid,were these damn,Blank MultiDiscs,that really looked and felt like they were burnt copies,,and that was one compounding insult,,the other serious insult,was that the original episodes did NOT have
the much waited for special features,nor was any thought given in the least,about the unaired TV pilot, ""PLEASE STAND BY"",which
was the very 1st Outer Limits segment-pilot made,that eventually became ""The Galaxy Being"" episode! no special features,no anything,but a damn insult,to the serious money paying consumers,who deserved way more then this! and they compounded the insult AGAIN,when they re-released the complete series in late 2008-in the same damn format,,Blank MultiDiscs! i encourage any
consumer and fan of the original series to demand that Metro Goldwyn Mayer re-release the series,on a normal,labeled DVD disc,
and that they include as many special features as they can,because the original ABC promos are on You Tube,and they should also
be included on DVDs,which in this case,they chose not to do! and since MGM and 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment are in
cohoots with each other,then the consumers need to target these people,and make that a HUGE issue,because many of the MultiDiscs i have brought from them,are FLAWED and have video malfunctions! and trying to call up their so called customer service
line,is another serious insult,because THEY DON'T CARE!! and that is NOT fair to the Fans and consumers,who got ripped-off and treated like this! in addition to the original OUTER LIMITS TV series,other classic TV shows from MGM/Fox like ""THE TIME TUNNEL"",""THE PRETENDER"",""VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA"",and other classics,have been made with these same flawed discs-so serious consumers need to get the message to MGM and 20th-stop cheapskating your consumers,and release our
TV classics on better professionally made DVD discs! because for the money we have spent on these items,our money shouldn't include video clitches and scratches on poorly manufactured DVDs-that is inexcusable!! that is the main reason why i will not buy
the Complete series collection-i refuse! if MGM and 20th are wise,then they should re-release ""OUTER LIMITS"" and the other mentioned classics through SHOUT! Factory,since their Timeless Media Classics division released ""STONEY BURKE"" last year-and in GREAT quality,too! i encourage disgruntled consumers to make their complaints known to MGM/Fox,so that they are aware of our
absolute dissatisfaction!-,because this NOT ACCEPTABLE!!",1403654400,4,2933,5.52

2963178,5,B000W8KY0G,"I love The Outer Limits.  The classic, from the early 1960's.  We watched this show as children, and it amazed, enlightened, and terrified us.  It only lasted two seasons, but it made a huge impression on me.  The first season was the best.  It featured the talents of Joseph Stephano (who wrote the screenplay for Hitchcock's Psycho).  His stories were eerie and uplifting.  Conrad Hall's cinematography was stellar.  The Outer Limits was an anthology show (different stories and characters every week), and some very young (now famous) actors and actresses appeared.  There were William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and James Doohan, soon to be piloting the Enterprise on Star Trek; Sally Kellerman, who would be most famous as Hot Lips in the M*A*S*H movie;  Martin Landau, who would win an Oscar for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi in Tim Burton's Ed Wood;  Luana Anders (catch her in Easy Rider and Dementia 13), Robert Culp (I Spy, Greatest American Hero, and many movies), David McCallum (Man from U.N.C.L.E.) and many other stars enhanced these stories.  The second season was not quite as good.  Joseph Stephano and Conrad Hall went on to other projects, and a more business-like production team was put in place.  Kenneth Peach was the cinematographer, and while his work was good, he did not capture light and shadow with the same brilliance.  Still, there are very few television shows of the caliber of The Outer Limits, and I would rather watch its worst episode than the best episode of many other programs.  It was that kind of show.  I put it  in the same class with The Twilight Zone and The X-Files.  Obviously, I like the more outr and weird in TV, and The Outer Limits supplied it!

2963184,5,B000W8KY0G,"The Outer Limits is a must for Twilight Zone fans or any fan of the science fiction genre.

Excellent scripts, fine actors, taut directing, the series had it all.  Unlike the Twilight Zone, which used suspense and surprise as its primary goal, the Outer Limits had a moral story in most shows, with the 'control voice' at the end informing us the moral of the story.  Normally, the moral was that Man is flawed, imperfect, but inherently good...at some level.

The series was not expected to be a big hit so it was shot on a shoestring.  The producers later regaled fan magazines with stories of how they had 'special effects' from the most mundane of things (many sound effects came from a vacuum cleaner).  The inexpensive sets were later used by Star Trek (the flowers with the deadly spores), among others.

Had the show spent the money to film in color, it might still be on repeats, but it would've lost something.  This was film noire on TV, science fiction as an intellectual exercise.  It was Twilight Zone writ large, with a full 60 minutes to fully develope a plotline and then, the denouement.

I have only watched one disk, and one of the eight shows was corrupted.  This was validated on 3 different DVD players.  I have no idea how many more will be bad.  Note that the media was clearly new with no scratches or marks of note.  It makes me wonder if these are not actually counterfeit.

Rather than go through the hassle of returning it for another bad set, I used a robust media player (VLC on a computer) and skipped around the 2 minutes that went bad.",1384473600,12,759,4.402877697841727

Beware when buying this set as some of the dvds are defective and will freeze and skip on you. I bought 2 different sets last year, my first set came with dvd's that were scratched and smudged with fingerprints (a new unopened set!), since I didn't want to go through a return/refund scenario, I just settled for what I got but unfortunately my dvd's wouldnt play correctly and I was forced to exchange them for another new unopened set. When set 2 finally arrived 2 weeks later I wasn't as enthusiastic as I was before unboxing my first set but I was relieved none the less...that was until I unboxed my second brand new boxed set. At first I thought someone had played a sick joke on me...but that wasn't the case, indeed my second unopened box set had scratched, smudged discs like my first set but luckily the dvds were able to play...I was forced to settle for a mediocre physical product with smudges, scratches and double sided discs...BEWARE.",1383264000,8,1051,4.536842105263158

Even the few episodes that drag a little are still good. You will see many tv stars from yesteryear and some youve never even heard of. There are no special features but who cares.

2963192,5,B000W8KY0G,for some of you out there this series is to old for you to remember. Outer Limits is a timeless classic,1381190400,,103,3.9523809523809526
2963193,5,B000W8KY0G,The Outer Limits is a classic TV show that every sci-fi fan should have in their collection. If you've never seen The Outer Limits you are missing out on some great television viewing.,1379894400,3,184,4.606060606060606

2963195,5,B000W8KY0G,"Fifty years ago today - on September 16, 1963 - I was among those who thrilled to the startling first broadcast of ""The Outer Limits"". Many people who saw the original series in the '60s spent decades nursing fond memories of these shows. They struck us then as boldly dramatic, hauntingly atmospheric, richly textured, sometimes profoundly philosophical and even occasionally moving. During the first season in particular, they were somehow able to get an intention across, or at least to suggest a mood - however out-of-date the style of production may seem to us now. It's hard to deny that ""The Man Who Was Never Born"" and a few other episodes do evoke a measure of ""the awe and mystery"" that the weekly intro explicitly promised.

  But for new viewers, it is difficult to understand why this series had such a powerful impact back then. Even for us die-hard original fans, it is impossible to re-experience that effect when watching the DVDs today. The turbulent world of the past half-century (!) has changed our reactions and expectations. Without the context of 1963 (the anxiety & xenophobia of the Cold War) - and without a tolerance for the tedious pace of early '60s TV - these shows may no longer seem to have the qualities we thought we saw in them when they were new. Does that consign the DVDs to nostalgic oldsters only? Not necessarily. Perhaps younger viewers can stretch their historical imaginations and find the value in these shows, especially with the help of David J. Schow's excellent book ""The Outer Limits Companion"", a detailed account of the actual production (almost everything anyone writes or says about the series is cribbed from Schow - I just wish they would plagiarize him accurately).

  Most of those involved in making these show are no longer around; those who are should still be proud that they contributed to it.  The series is still recognized as ground-breaking. Though the weaker episodes are best forgotten, the implications of some of the best ones are still written about and discussed today. Though not by me, because I personally know no one who remembers the series - a sad way to observe the 50th anniversary of ""The Outer Limits"".",1379289600,,2186,4.8445040214477215
2963196,5,B000W8KY0G,"This show first aired when I was twelve years old. My family wasn't into SF, so I only had access to one show, the first one in season one. Years later, I had a few of them on VHS. Finally, I have the whole bunch, and am so glad they're on DVD. My set plays without any problems, and the sound is great. As a blind SF fan, I would have been totally lost without the plot descriptions on the Wikipedia site. Thanks also to the reviewer who posted a disk index; you have no idea how handy that has been as I've heard these episodes! My main comment about the series is that the stories have held up quite well. I kept thinking that although this series ran between 1963 and 1965, and the technology was nothing like what we have these days, the writers were incredibly skilled, and there are twists and turns in the plots that are quite unique. For example, who would have thought of trying to prevent nuclear war by staging an alien invasion? Thank you, Amazon, for such a great series!",1378771200,2,985,4.2727272727272725

It is great seeing all the wonderful actors who were just starting out, too.  Ok, so the effects are a bit corny.  But you have to remember that this was the early 60's...and television.  The story lines are what's important here.  There's even a bit of protest against pollution, war and prejudice that is still ongoing today.  For all television/movie students, this is a must to watch and study and to see the influence it had for future television spook-a-thons line ""The Twilight Zone"", ""Star-Trek"" and others.",1377302400,,664,4.615384615384615

I, Robot
The Inheritors (Parts 1&2)

Excellent actors, including:
Robert Duval, Sally Kellerman, Robert Culp, Cliff Robertson, Jack Palance, and others

The series held many of us spellbound during its original transmission.

It also had some of the best actors in television in every episode of the series. Some of my favorite episodes were ""The Sixth Finger"", The Man Who Was Never Born"" , "" The Architechs of Fear"", and ""The Zanti Misfits"". Then the second season came and the producers changed everything about the series. The stories, the photography, the music, and the monsters weren't as imaginative.

2963214,5,B000W8KY0G,"The Outer Limits is my favorite show for many reasons. The first is the introduction, which is one of the most iconic moments in television history. The narrator explaims we control the virtual and horizontal and has taken control of your television sets. This give the impression that some other worldly force is at work.  The Outer Limits may also feature the most impressive black and white cinematography shown on television. In many respects it is shot like a moody horror film, yet the show is probably the most pure science fiction ever produced for television. Each episode has a strong grounding in science fiction, morality, and atmosphere. The eerie black and white atmosphere also gives the aliens and characters in the stories a haunting appearance. The special effects though not elaborate by today's standards, are sufficiently imaginative to overcome any budgetary restraints. One of the main problems with science fiction today is that special effects are used to carry inferior storylines and characterizations. The Outer Limits featured excellent scripts and interesting characters. This should not be surprising since the show featured upcoming stars and future science fiction writers like Harlen Ellison.

What is surprising is that this impressive show only lasted two seasons and 49 episodes. This should be further evidence that network executives have little clue on what makes a good science fiction show. It should also be noted that the producers of the Outer Limits were in constant conflict with the network over creative content of the show.

The picture and sound quality are excellent. Once in awhile you will see a little grain in some of the scenes but nothing that takes away from the overall presentation. One point to make is that MGM got a little cheap by putting the entire series on seven double sided discs. They are easy to scratch and get fingerprints on which will cause playback problems, however, I clean these discs each time I play them, and handle them by the edges only. I have an average Sony DVD recorder/player and as many times that they have been played I have yet to see any of them skip. You take care of your discs and handle them properly and you will have no trouble with this set. The Chiller channel was showing ""The Outer Limits"" awhile back, but there was 10 min cut from each episode in order to fit in the time slot. These episodes are made to be seen in their entirety and that is what you get with this set. All 49 episodes are here, complete and uncut on 7 double sided discs.

In addition to the great story telling, many of favorite Baby Boomer actors and actresses had early rolls on the show. David McCallum (Man from U.N.C.L.E. and NCIS) is in the very first episode and does a phenomenal job as a man who has the chance to advance his intelligence considerably -- and of course, mystery ensues.

2963241,3,B000W8KY0G,I was very excited when I purchased this old classic show. I knew I had seen some good and bad episodes years ago. I figured I would get into the series as it went along. Unfortunately I found that I often fell asleep in many of the espisodes. Some stories are pretty decent while others are simply dreadful relying on stupid monsters or some hokey dimension monster or some energy creature etc. I have the first five seasons of the New Outer Limits and it is by far the better product. It seems the problem with the original series was simply the weak sci-fi writing. The writers simply didn't know where they were going with a lot of the original stories. They didn't seem to know how to flesh out the ideas. So for the classic episodes that are in this collection I will give the show three stars but I can give only three stars because many episodes are simply tedious and dreadful.,1346371200,,886,4.408536585365853
2963242,5,B000W8KY0G,"I just received this set and am delighted with it. I really thought hard about it because of the negative comments but my set has a total of 7 double sided disks all of which play just fine.  As far as picture quality, it's just as good as when I watch the episoded on tv or hulu.  Were they remastered? NO.  Are they very watchable and good quality, I think so.  I also did not have the issue with missing episodes and have posted a disk by disk listing of what was actually on the dvd's that I received.  If you loved the Outer Limits, this is well worth buying and I see the price has gone done even further than when I purchased it a week ago, a real bargain!

2963246,3,B000W8KY0G,"OK - I give the series a 5....I give the DVDs a 1 and if there were minus numbers, I'd get into those!  Double-sided DVDs aren't my favorite, but sometimes they're all that's available and you want something so bad you get it knowing you're not going to be particularly happy.  I was pleasantly surprised in watching Season 1, Disc 1 - quality was superb and my immediate thought was that maybe - just maybe, the technology had improved.  Fooled me.  Disc 2, Season 1 was a total DISASTER!  It wouldn't play on one side and on the other side the video and audio quality was abysmal - in other words, it's one I'll use for a Frisbee or target practice.  Naturally, my viewing of this abomination came after the 30 day limit, so I can't return the piece of trash.  Anyone know where I can find just that one disc?  eBay maybe?

At this point, I don't particularly care if I watch any of the other discs or not because I might be setting myself up for more disappointments.

A word of Warning - Buyer Beware!  If you're contemplating purchasing this item, remember, one or more discs might be a piece of garbage.  Just make sure you watch them all within the 30-day return window.

As the series progresses, many of the episodes default to aliens and space travelers.  Some good episodes which avoid these frequent plots include ""The Zanti Misfits,"" ""The Guests,"" ""The Forms of Things Unknown,"" and ""Don't Open Till Doomsday.""  ""Demon with a Glass Hand"" is innovative and imaginative.  I think my favorite episode, thus far, is ""Cry of Silence"" with menacing tumbleweeds in the desert.  The rest of the disc I've just started seem to all involve aliens, spaceships, and robots.  ""Cold Hands, Warm Heart"" is just downright boring without any real point I can discern.  I did see most of these when I was a kid and they were originally broadcast.  I wish I'd just rented these and not bought them.

I am hoping (!) that this series will eventually get the same treatment on blu-ray that was afforded The Twilight Zone series. Those episodes are jaw-dropping in their quality. Of course it all depends on the condition of the original elements. The OT transfers are a bit iffy here, especially some of the audio. But that's really only apparent when (unfairly) comparing them to the TZ BD.

Why can't this very important series that has countless followers and fans be given a presentation on freeze-free single-sided discs? This is an historically important tv series featuring quality writing, directing and acting. Is someone just being stupid here or are we all re-living a lost episode?
If this series was ever re-issued properly on SINGLE-SIDED discs that actually play, those knuckleheads in charge of this fiasco would be surprised by the amount of sales that would be generated.

I find the episodes refreshingly fun and sometimes still scary to watch.

But I also am having issues with some disks, in particular some episodes having freezes, skips etc.
The Zannti Misfits episode would only play about 3\4th through before skipping and freezing till it was not watchable.
The Mice episode played about halfway through, but when I restarted it now it won't play at all.
The packaging is ok and not the problem........I think some of the disks have errors from the factory.
I have no idea how many others are going to be a problem since I am only starting the third disk.

It is really too bad people are having problems and cant count on the Outer Limits set to play as expected.
I don't think its worth the shipping cost and hassle to send them back.
We Outer Limit fans can only hope that someday a reliable set will be released.

Update:Ive watched the rest of this series and haven't had any further problems with freezes etc.
If your a sci-fi fan of the older series you should seriously consider adding this boxed set in your collection.
It really is a classic from the past and worth the investment.

2963256,5,B000W8KY0G,"THE OUTER LIMITS predates the imitative THE X FILES by three decades, and yet for me, it's the earlier show that stands the test of time better. Watching the series now, I'm struck with how much Chris Carter took from OUTER LIMITS for his own show, although he usually cites THE TWILIGHT ZONE and THE NIGHT STALKER as his main influences.

THE OUTER LIMITS ran for just two seasons - 1963-'65 - but it pushed the boundaries in the way television presented science fiction, horror, and paranormal phenomena. The opening sequence in which a voice assures us that ""there is nothing wrong with your television set"" and that ""we are controlling transmission"", was a brilliant concept, and probably the best opening of any T.V. show before or since. It was a way of acknowledging us as being not just detatched observers, but active participants in what was about to unfold. I vividly remember being simultaneously terrified and fascinated by it as a three - four year old when the show went into its first rerun in the mid-'60's. It was on a weeknight from 8 - 9 P.M., and I literally couldn't be torn away to go to bed until that ""control voice"" came on again to reassure me that my TV was back to normal.

The scripts were always intelligent and thought provoking, being written by some of the most respected sci-fi authors in the business at the time. The first season contains the cream of the crop; some of my favorite episodes are ""The Hundred Days of the Dragon"", ""The Sixth Finger"", "" The Man Who Was Never Born"", ""Obit"", ""The Zanti Misfits"", ""Zzzz"", ""The Mutant"", ""Fun and Games"", and ""The Forms of Things Unknown"". Second season highlights include ""Cold Hands, Warm Heart"", ""Behold Eck"", ""Demon With a Glass Hand"", ""I, Robot"" and the two parter, ""The Inheritors"".  However, the entire series is well above your average TV fare, and while its influence on other shows is clearly evident, OUTER LIMITS still retains its uniqueness and timelesness.

Expand your mind with this groundbreaking classic.",1323820800,4,2002,4.777456647398844
2963257,1,B000W8KY0G,"I purchased these discs a few years back and buyer beware, some of the discs were defective and would not play back. There is something wrong with their two-sided recording process. I tried the defective discs in two different machines and there is nothing wrong with the machines. MGM would not cover the the problem they created.
 If I could make one recommendation, check all the discs the day that a buyer receives them.

2963258,5,B000W8KY0G,"The Outer Limits, Original Series circa 1960's has always been my favorite of all time TV SciFi series. The shows were well written and scripted, and for the small budget they had was able to scare the pants off of kids growing up in that era. The boxed set has every episode from all 3 seasons. The have been digitally remastered and fit on HD wide Screen TV's, video and audio quality is excellent! The DVD's are double sided, this was a bit of a downside because they are not labeled, they are only numbered, you really can't tell what's on what side of the disk until it's loaded in your player.

The quality of the video and audio is very clear. Personally, I wouldn't spend over $40 for this set, but it's a worthwhile investment if you can tolerate a steady diet of monsters. ;)

2963263,4,B000W8KY0G,"I love the Outer Limits show, along with Twilight Zone, One Step Beyond and all of the old scifi shows! Having these shows to watch whenever I feel like it is wonderful! My complaint is with the packaging. The discs are 2 sided and aren't labeled so you'll have to squint to see the tiny writing on the inner part of the disc to figure out which disc you have in hand and if it's side A or B. This might sound easy but trust me, this writing is tiny! And whatever you do, don't mix up your discs!! You'll go into the outer limits trying to figure them out!
You know how you're sitting around and you think of a particluar show and want to watch it? You can do just that with this movie set, but it won't be easy finding which disc and which side.
All in all, I'm thrilled to have these episodes to watch at will, I'm just not happy at all with the way the discs were made or how they're presented.
If you're a fan like me, it's worth it ... but plan to grit your teeth here and there!",1315440000,2,984,4.0
2963264,2,B000W8KY0G,"This review is largely based on my experience with this set and of the past of this same series.  Otherwise the set is plain basic no extras of any kind in slim disc cases in a thin cardboard holder for the set.  Not considering the defects mentioned below I would rate this set about a 4.5, just because it's plain basic doesn't make it bad considering the price I paid was about $32 OTD (out the door) fulfilled by Amazon.

Experienced numerous stoppages/disc failure (player ejects disc), freezes with this set.  The first error noticed is on volume 1 Disc 1 titled The Galaxy being.  Second is on volume 2 Disc 2 Fun and Games, chapter 4, 6:20 minutes.  Third is volume 3 Disc 2-3 The Brain of Colonel Barham, chapter 5, 1:15 minutes.  These issues are repeatable, meaning the player will react at the same point repeatedly.  Most likely there are other errors in this set because not all episodes have been viewed.

Generally most, including myself, would consider a defective product just one of those things that is remote, perhaps a small percentage of the whole for a given source.  I have some of the episodes of this same series on LD (laserdisc) and it too suffers from defects in the form of laser rot, a defect that is rather specific to LD.  Meanwhile I have the Twilight Zone on LD, individual DVD volumes, and in recent years the entire series in a DVD box set.  No issues at all with any of the discs.  Same goes for most videos on disc with a few exceptions.  Those exceptions are of titles that tend to be rather obscure or perhaps comparatively poor sellers.

I feel the defects are because of the studio/distributor because they dictate the quality standard for the replicator.

My suggestion is to play, not fast forward, all episodes within a timely manner that is well within the return period.  This series being about 2500 minutes will not be easy to evaluate within the return period.  Playing the discs without actually viewing will not ensure it being defect free because a defect may cause the player to skip a chapter or two and keep playing.

Amazon fulfilled this purchase making return easy but delayed because the seller never responded.",1314576000,3,2173,4.641361256544503
2963265,5,B000W8KY0G,"Point 1:
Buy this, because it's great stuff.  But when you get it, take the discs out of the original packaging and put them in some better form of storage.  Two of the seven discs in my set have cracked a little bit around the hole because the original cases hold them too tightly.

Point 2:
Some reviewers have written that the digital transfers are bad.  I actually let this keep me from buying the DVD's for a long time.  After watching about a third of the episodes, my opinion is that the transfers are perfect.  Any flaws in graininess, contrast, etc, appear to me to be artifacts from the original filming.  Sometimes, what now looks like a flaw was actually done deliberately with fabric or vaseline in front of the lens.  The degree of contrast in a transfer is a rather subjective thing.  In these transfers, blacks are black, whites are white, and there is plenty of gray scale in between.  So, I don't see how they could be any better.  Likewise, I don't hear anything wrong with the audio:  the audio quality just seems true to the source material.

* * * * *

I was watching when this show first debuted on my 11th birthday.  I have loved the series my whole life.  In the '80's I tried to tape them all on VHS from late-night reruns, and bought prerecorded VHS tapes of the ones that got away.  Now I can enjoy them much better than that.  Of course I wish that the DVD's weren't 2-sided, that the packaging was better, etc, etc.  But these will do for now.  I'll probably buy them again later in some new and better format.  It will probably always be my all-time favorite TV series, or nearly so.

By the way, get the book too:  ""The Outer Limits:  The Official Companion"" by David J. Schow and Jeffrey Frentzen.  It's fascinating and it adds a lot to your viewing experience, especially if you've already seen the episodes many times and formed your impressions about them.",1312070400,5,1892,4.446064139941691

There are episodes I hadn't seen in years & really enjoyed them. DVD transfer is excellent, as good or better than watching each week on tv. Beginning is a little corny with "" Don't adjust your DVD player"" but when episode starts it's complete just like the  original.

I have not watched every show all the way through but the several I did watch are perfect. The double sided discs are a minor inconvenience because I use them in a DVD 400 disc changer that only reads one side, so I have to turn them over manually (if more DVD players would read both sides I would prefer double sided discs). But it is so fun to have a copy of these old shows, there really is nothing quite like them.

2963274,4,B000W8KY0G,"I first watched some of this series back in the 60's in Australia, ""The Galaxy Being"" completely freaked me out at 8yrs old and now it is fun to rewatch and revisit.
These shows, Outer Limits, Invaders, V and some others I have purchased have made me very aware now, of how frightening it must have been to be living in the USA under the threat of nuclear war and communist take over.
I would recommend this series to any one interested in 60's sci-fi, it is now very dated and the special effects are not up to present CGI capability, but considering what little they, the originators of the special effects, did have to work with, I think the special effects people have done a great job.
Some of the episodes, not many, are damaged and not as sharp as others, perhaps the big fire on the MGM (?) backlot was responsible, whatever I still enjoy them and have waited 40 years to get my hands back on these gems of original sci fi.",1303603200,,931,4.325714285714286

The Outer Limits : The Complete Original Series Volumes 1-3  contains a total of 2515 minutes of some great viewing. All of the episodes are black and white and were filmed during 1963-64. Full frame 1.33:1 ratio. Each episode runs around 50 minutes long.
The set breaks down to Vol. 1 with 16 episodes...Vol. 2 with 16 episodes...Vol. 3 with 17 episodes.
Packaging has a outer laminated cardboard boxing which holds 6 inner plastic DVD casings. Each plastic casing holds 1 double-sided DVD....except for Volume 3 Disc 2-3 which holds 2 double-sided discs. All of the discs play fine on my player...have not had any problems at all.
Like other reviewers I always considered The Twilight Zone as the definitive Sc-Fi series of all time, the Outer Limits was never even considered. After watching this collection my view of The Outer Limits has definitely changed. Created with an obvious low television budget, props were at a minimum, monsters looked kind of hokey ....but the rich story material and superior acting more than made up for it. I can now say this series is on par with the Twilight Zone.
Like the Twilight Zone ; The Outer Limits was a true acting playground for future stars such as : Robert Culp, Robert Duvall, Cliff Robertson, Dabney Coleman, Martin Sheen, Adam West, Donald Pleasance and many others. It also featured a few  actors from a ""future"" television series that would be known to us as ""Star Trek"" such as : Leonard Nimoy, William Shatner and James Doohan.
It is hard to pick out all the best episodes out of these 49 shows but a few that come to mind are : "" The Zanti Misfits "", "" The Sixth Finger "", "" The Hundred Days Of The Dragon "", "" Nightmare "" and "" Specimen: Unknown "".
This was also a very affordable collection , it sold on Amazon at Christmas for a low price of $29.88.

The Outer Limits brings back nostalgic memories of a time when families sat around the television set together and when you didn't need blood, guts and extreme violence to be entertained.  It's nice to see these old favourites available for both young and old to enjoy all over again.  For those of you who loved the Outer Limits in younger days, or for the younger generation who want to see what all the fuss was about, I would thoroughly recommend anyone to buy this beautifully presented boxed set, grab the popcorn and sit back for some seriously good sci-fi.",1293667200,4,726,4.576923076923077

After researching to be sure I understood exactly what I should be getting, I decided to take a chance on Amazon's reputation. When the product arrived, I checked it over carefully, watched every episode, and found no defects or missing episodes.

Overall, the shows were delightful. I would have rated the show 5 stars, but most of the special effects, especially the creatures, were ""cheesy."" (Think people dressed up in costumes.) If you refuse to be distracted by that, however, and evaluate the show for its entertainment value, this is a good purchase. Looking for a pleasant escape from reality for an evening?

No commercials really improves the quality of the stories - a local station is broadcasting reruns of The Outer Limits and it really chops the stories up with commercials, which is a major reason why I got this complete set. The cheapie special effects and mostly excellent scripts and acting are enhanced by the episodes being in black & white - it causes the viewer to use their brain to imagine, and at least for me, be the basis of some really entertaining dreams at night when I sleep after watching an episode. I highly recommend this box set.",1292544000,,727,4.557251908396947

It was and still is some great storytelling and in watching several episodes the viewer can see that some story lines haven't changed much in almost 50 years even with new Sci-Fi shows. Of course there are what I feel are stand out episodes that are as good today as anything made. And there are also some corny episodes too given the era and morals they were made in. Even with it all in black and white, it remains a great series that I highly recommend! And the great Amazon price and no commercials and with none of the stuff on a TV screen one has to sit through nowadays makes this collection one of the best ways to really enjoy the series.",1292371200,3,848,4.407643312101911

As an adult, it has taken on a whole new meaning for me.  I was able to appreciate the simple moral messages that were evident in each of the episodes; some of them very applicable to today's society.  Simple messages like, ""Look after Mother Earth - or else!""  I was actually just wanting to watch one particular episode that had stuck in my memory, but ended up watching all of them with interest.  Despite the patently fake looking special effects and the black and white playback, I just loved them and would highly recommend them - to a person of any age.",1289606400,,687,4.456
2963292,4,B000W8KY0G,"Back in the early 60's, a sci-fi show came along in the form of a ""Twilight Zone"" wanabee called, ""The Outer Limits."" It did not last long back then, although a later color version (also quite good) has since appeared. The original OUTER LIMITS (basically 1963-65) was a real trip, even by today's standards, and while there ARE some crappy episodes (as seems with every TV sci-fi/fantasy series there ever was), a good majority of these original Outer Limits episodes still hold up, and quite well.

In fact, almost too well. If you are at all squeamish or easily frightened by strange, crawling or ethereal, very alien, both good and evil creepy entities, both cerebral and not, and some things from your worst nightmares, I'd advise you to read the episode descriptions before watching, especially late at night. For while almost half of the episodes of the original series are very talkative, slow moving and complex, about a dozen or so of these stand out as truly intelligent/wise comments on not only the human condition in general, but about the cold war era and the frightening nuclear paranoia of the times in particular.

What's ultimately clear is that almost every episode is a moral allegory of some sort.  The famous ""there is nothing wrong with your television set"" CONTROL VOICE most often sets up the story, and its supposed philosophical roots, then comes back at the end to tell the viewer what ""lesson"" they've just hopefully learned. While this was kind of gimmicky and was dropped entirely in a few episodes, this show was way ahead of its time, especially considering today's almost totally inept network TV sci-fi offerings. In fact, about the only thing going for sci-fi programs after this, have been and are much better special effects. No sci-fi shows today however, whether network or syndicated, come close to the overall quality of the ideas expressed in most of the 48 episodes here (one is a two-parter).

The worst episodes of this, the original series, are at least entertaining. The best episodes though, really make the viewer THINK. And while the sum of the whole and the rather dull presentation (no extra DVD features) keeps this from getting 5 stars, the price is right and this should be a must-buy for any TV sci-fi series collector. Seeing several actors and actresses appearing here in minor or major parts, BEFORE they became much better known and true celebrities is fun, and there are many of them. Nick Adams, Eddie Albert, Ed Asner, Dabney Coleman, Michael Constantine, Robert Culp, Bruce Dern, Robert Duvall, Sally Kellerman, Martin Landau, David McCallum, Vera Miles, William Shatner & Leonard Nimoy & James Doohan (Star Trek), Lloyd Nolan, Warren Oates, Donald Pleasence, Cliff Robertson, Martin Sheen, Adam West, Nancy Malone, and countless others.

All episodes were and are well written and directed, and thankfully, none feature this whole new shaky-zoomy, no shot longer than 3 second, Michael Bay-ish ""style"" seen so frequently today on such horrible fare as ""The Office"" (ugh) and the truly awful (and unwatchable for me) updated version of Battlestar Galactica (gag). I mean really, the first thing I learned in film school was to use the zoom feature as little as possible, and when exactly was it when ""tripod"" became a dirty word?

The constant and consistent theme throughout this original show is all about ""control"" and/or the lack of it, and if one considers it for a moment, the lack of control over any given situation in life (even in sci-fi fantasy worlds), is more often than not, truly scary. This theme is what makes the show so great, and so many episodes truly remarkable and unforgettable. In fact, while watching all 48 episodes in their original broadcast air date order, this factor, this idea of not being in control, became very clear to me. This theme is also what makes many of the best episodes truly frightening or at least deeply thought provoking.

For me, the ten best episodes (in no specific order) are ""The Architects of Fear,"" ""The Sixth Finger,"" ""Nightmare,"" ""The Zanti Misfits,"" ""Controlled Experiment"" (the only humorous episode of the lot), ""The Mutant,"" ""Fun and Games,"" ""A Feasibility Study,"" ""Cold Hands, Warm Heart,"" and ""The Probe"" (which was the last episode of the original series). Of these gems, perhaps the scariest and most memorable episodes for me personally are ""Nightmare"" and ""The Zanti Misfits."" The first is very aptly named, and the second should definitely not be watched alone, late and in the dark, where things go bump in the night. Or crawl up your arm making weird faces at you and even weirder noises.

It's a real shame that there is nothing even approaching this on television today, especially in science fiction, but that's as may be. This program showed an enormous respect for its viewers, and for moral intelligence in general, and for those reasons alone, it will always remain something quite special, even after almost half a century.

2963293,5,B000W8KY0G,I remember this series as a child. I was only twelve at the time. The Outer Limits was a budget series. Its special effects were done on a tight budget. All 49 episodes were done in black and white. I particularly liked the musical score by Dominic Frontiere. Many Hollywood stars appeared in these episodes before they were well known. They were obviously created for adult viewing.,1286841600,,383,4.731343283582089

2963295,3,B000W8KY0G,"What?  Only 3 stars?  Well, I will have to admit that for many years I considered Outer Limits to tell a fairly superior tale, as compared to Twilight Zone, which I thought to be really gimmicky.  And after watching every episode in this Outer Limits anniversary edition I'm persuaded that many of the stories, in my opinion, really aren't so great after all, even after making the necessary allowance for antique Fx.  In fact I've been growing more fond of the Twilight Zone, it seems.

I will, however, call your attention to one exceptional episode:  ""Controlled Experiment,"" dated Jan 13, 1964.  Call it droll or funny or campy--it's absolutely delightful.  It stars Carroll O'Connor (All In The Family) and Barry Morse (The Fugitive tv series) and features prominently Grace Lee Whitney (Yeoman Rand, Star Trek TOS).  Just seeing these veteran actors back in the ""early days"" was a real pleasure.  And this one episode I must say was nearly worth the price of the whole package.",1284940800,,983,4.867469879518072

2963298,5,B000W8KY0G,"I was a little kid who really enjoyed science fiction when the original (and to me the only real) Outer Limits premiered. It was with great anticipation that I watched the first episode, with its novel beginning about how they take over your television set. Of course being the brat I was, I got up and turned off the television and turned it back on and changed channels just to say ""nyah"" to the voice on the show.

I think I was too young for this series. It didn't hold my attention, as it was more talky and complex than Twilight Zone. While I would watch the shows, I didn't understand all of it.

I bought this set after reading the plot summaries of the episodes, many of which I remembered, because they sounded so interesting. Unlike some of the reviewers, I had no problems at all playing the discs on my dvd player. I really do not like double-sided discs and would prefer the standard one-sided ones, but they play fine.

Now that I'm older and maybe a little bit wiser or more intelligent, I appreciate the stories much more than back in the 60's when a lot of it went over my head. I have to say that the special effects and props are laughingly cheesy and some of the logistics don't make any sense, but what I admire are the premises for these episodes. I mean, they had really great ideas for each show and so many of them brought a chill to me as I watched them for the first time after mucho years.

The only thing I don't really care for is the ""lesson"" that is taught at the end of each episode. Sure, it's relevant but I could just as well do without the preaching. Nevertheless, this was a television series aimed at the thinking person (unlike the remakes, which were just plain horrible) and I am glad I bought this. Amazon has a very good price for the box set that contains the entire series.

Oh, a note about the video and audio quality: don't expect much. It is passable but that's about it.  Picture quality is uneven and sometimes there is a thin stripe on one side of the screen; the film is very grainy at times; the audio levels are not always stable.

the experience and keeps me from purchasing this new set.

Does anyone know if the newest Complete Collection still has this lame change in the menu, that is, does the ""control voice"" in the newest release still say:

There is nothing wrong with your DVD player. Do not attempt to adjust the picture. We are controlling your DVD player. We already control the horizontal and the vertical. We now control the digital. We can change the focus from a soft blur to crystal clarity. Sit quietly and we will control all that you see and hear. You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to... The Outer Limits.

?

I think people making these decisions have to be young, because people my age, who lived when this series first came out, would never change what the control voice said.

I would purchase the new DVD set if I thought it didn't have that lame change on the menu.

Does anyone at this site know if ""they"" put back the original control voice in the menu of the newly release DVD?

Show, ""The Outer Limits"" was a special show.  The writers

2963305,3,B000W8KY0G,"I did not buy this set, nor do I own it. I do however, own the individual seasons of this set. I state this only because box sets often come with extras. If this set does, I have no way of knowing about it. However, about the episodes that make of the set, I have much to say. Many episodes are made of decent stories for the time period, the special effects hokey at best, pitiful at times, and as one would guess limited to a tight budget. There are many scenes with which I found myself confused or able to see mistakes that should have been edited out. The story's are mostly weak, sometimes OK, and rarely good or great. There are three stories that warrant the purchase however, one is famous for it's retelling of the Isaac Asimov story ""Robot"" with Leonard Nimoy, who really pulls off the whole episode almost to the point of making this collection worth whatever price they charge. The second is a story about greed and how to dispose of prisoners. We did it with Australia, who is to say that other planets have not found a way to create penal colonies elsewhere. In this story, that is just what happens, as a ship of prisoners lands in one of our deserts. The third is the only two parter in the series that I can remember, and it's a different take on the ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" theme. Those three episodes in my opinion are the very best of the series. There are a few others barley worth mentioning, but enjoyable to a point, nonetheless. The rest, I can only say were a complete waste of time in my humble opinion. Many hours of my life gone, that I will never see again. But, by my own choice. So, buy this if you are a serious collector of this sort of stuff/nostalgia like myself. I had remembered conning my parents to let me stay up late to see these, biting my nails weekly until the very next episode I was so excited. Too bad, as an adult, I just find them missing something I remembered as a child.

One would expect more from a company like MGM releasing a set like Complete Outer Limits, but the content of course is great, 51 of what would have been hour long episodes, each one like watching a full length 60's scifi movie, over 2500 minuets of content at a current Amazon price of around $30 Best Buy can't match. The set is quite simply a must for any collector or fan of the 60's scifi genre, it practically defines it.",1274054400,5,705,4.3816793893129775

2963310,5,B000W8KY0G,I was very happy with this boxed set.  The quality was great--sound and picture.  It arrived quickly too!,1269475200,,105,4.777777777777778
2963311,5,B000W8KY0G,"To be honest: When I bought this DVD collection, I had very low expectations on the overall product quality.

Instead, I was very positively surprised! The menus are very easy to navigate through, and the image and sound quality are very good for a show that was aired more than 45 years ago. The screen format obviously is not widescreen, but I suppose that would be too much to ask for.

The only complaint I have is regarding the double-sided discs not presenting a clear A or B-side label. There are markings, yes, but they are tiny and kinda hidden in the DVD label, which many people with poor vision simply can't read. Shame on you, MGM.

NOTE: Closed Captions are available. When playing the discs on my notebook I found out that I am able to choose Closed Captions in the media player, and they work just fine. To my surprise though, the CC refused to work on my standalone DVD player. Anyway, I just plug the notebook to the TV via HDMI, and problem solved.",1269216000,3,967,4.451977401129944

For those not familiar with the series, the episodes are usually sci-fi ""parables"" (thought provoking stuff).  If you've found the new Outer Limits, along with most of the Sci-fi presented since the 1990's, nauseatingly PC (exceptions - first 2 seasons of Sliders, Dead Zone and Stargate SG1) you may find this series just wonderful.  The great director Robert Wise(The Day the Earth Stood Still) said ""you need to make everything as believable as possible in order for science fiction to work.""  This is where the original series stands out, and why it will always be classic.  If you like real Sci-fi, and not the formulized stuff the Sci-fi network has  served up, this may be a be a great investment.

This is because of a combination of top notch acting, execllent directing and script writing, and careful use of camera effects combining to create an atmosphere that makes this, and every episode in the series, riveting. These are qualities that rise above any particular date at which the drama was filmed, and make a series like this one timeless. This is a series that takes seriously the material it presents.  In any series that are this old, there is a tendancy to compare to modern science fiction shows the effects and sets and  presentation of the material.  Frankly I think The Outer Limits holds up better than some of the modern series. Again, it's because of the care and respect given to the material.

For example, in the series opening episode , when the strange glowing radioactive being who was drawn into this world by accident, is wandering down the sidewalk of a street at night, the camera takes you on that disturbing walk from within the creature's perspective, you see the crackling magnetic energy disrupting and overturning trash cans, shattering windows, radiation causing objects to glow, and then the creature wanders into a closed pawn shop and you see this utterly alien yet intelligent creature picking up and examining figurines and jewelry boxes and instruments, and you get a sense that this creature is as curious and fascinated about the contrivances of our world as we would be of his world. But what is most notable is the interaction between humans and this alien, trying to understand each other, trying to communicate, and when they finally achieve that on a rudimentary level, it feels like a tremendous accomplishment. And that's just the opening episode.

The series has well known star actors including;  Ed Asner, Martin Sheen, Robert Duval, Martin Landau and Leonard Nimoy.

Great science fiction author Harlan Ellison wrote two of the series stories, ""Demon With a Glass Hand"" and ""Soldier"".

Each episode is a stand alone drama confronting a different frontier of the unexplained, science pushing the cutting edge, people in the real world intertwining with the stark idea that other worlds and other dimensions exist. It is a journey worth taking. This is a great investment in a highly entertaining and thought provoking series.  The disks are double sided, but they worked flawlessly. The video is very clean, very sharp, excellent. The audio also is very clear.

To get an idea of the series you can watch some full episodes online for free at the IMDB ( Internet Movie Database ).  Simply go to the IMDB web site on the internet and type in the search term ""outer limits 1963"", and you will find links to some of the full episodes.

But it doesn't compare to having the DVD's to watch on your home televsion screen as they were meant to be viewed.

2963314,3,B000W8KY0G,"I don`t think this is the best tv-series i have seen, but it does have some good episodes. From what i seen from this show, i actually prefer the updated 90`s version, which i think are more dark and adult and have better episodes. They don`t have monsters in every episode.

I even think the intro and the voice controller of the new OL is better. Still i think the original is good, but they rely heavily on a monster in nearly every episode. That may not be a bad thing, but the depends on who you ask and if they like monsters. I like monsters, but not in every episode.

Ok, enough about the 90`s version. I like The Sixth Finger. I think David McCallum played his part very well. I also felt this could have worked liked as an Twilight Zone episode. One thing,the doubled sided discs are not good.  They could also have used single sided DVDs.

Greedy studio. I don`t like double sided discs even one bit. Especially clear white faced dics that it is nearly bound to come so many finger prints on the DVD over time that one i would stop playing or just skip and freeze heavily when you watch a episode. You can avoid that like i do. I use a cleaning cloth each time i touch the DVDs. So, i think these double sided DVDs deserve the rating 1 out of 5. And the series 3 out of 5.",1267833600,4,1283,4.161290322580645
2963315,3,B000W8KY0G,"Star Trek's first season began in the fall of 1966.  Two years before, in the fall of 1964, three of the actors that would appear in the Star Trek series, appeared in the third season of 'The Outer Limits'.

In 'Cold Hands, Warm Heart' (Rating 4), William Shatner (Capt. Kirk) plays an astronaut, who has just returned from the first orbit around the hot planet Venus, and now he finds Earth's climate a bit too cold for him.  The name of his mission: 'Project Vulcan'.

In 'Production and Decay of Strange Particles' (Rating 1), Leonard Nimoy (Mr. Spock) plays a lab technician at an experimental atomic reactor.  Something goes wrong and particles in the reactor take on a nasty life of their own; Nimoy goes in to save another technician.

In 'I Robot' (Rating 5), Nimoy plays a newspaper reporter who assists the beautiful niece of a scientist who invented a robot.  Unfortunately, the scientist is dead and the robot is now accused of murder.  (Asimov-like story.)

In 'Expanding Human' (Rating 3), James Doohan (Scotty) plays a police detective investigating a series of mysterious murders.  He suspects the experimental conscious expanding drugs at the university are somehow connected to the case.

Most of the stories in 'The Outer Limits' series have a nightmarish quality - replete with monsters and creatures of every description.  All of these shows take themselves seriously, all but one, that is.  In 'Controlled Experiment' (Rating 5), they take a break from the nasty old monsters and have a little fun with two Martians who want to understand the human propensity to murder each other.  Their struggle to understand this alien concept is quiet humorous.

2963321,3,B000W8KY0G,"THE OUTER LIMITS-THE COMPLETE ORIGINAL SERIES
This is, without a doubt, one of the best series ever on television.  Some reviews complain that there are no closed captions, but that is a minor problem.  My only serious complaint is that while all of the episodes are listed on each plastic container, some episode are NOT, in fact, available.  For example, on Disc One, episodes 33-40, the information says that Side B contains four episodes, beginning with the classic, ""Demon With the Glass Hand"".  That side has only two episodes instead of the listed four.  There are other strange exclusions with no warning.  There are no liner notes to explain these exclusions.
BUT, as a series, The Outer Limits had some of the best writing and (occasional) acting for its time.  For truly creepy and scary atmospherics, this can't be beat.  The productions are magnificent, even with the obvious budgetary restrictions faced by the creators.  Some are masterpieces of ""film noir"".

Of course the 1990's version has digital effects and the sixties version has more primitive effects. Still the 1960's stories are brilliant moral plays and lessons written by the best sci fi writers in the business at the time. The acting is all first class and filled with true artists, even the directors are top notch. Few series are this good overall and in spite of it's age and lack of color , it's the stories that matter , even if one could hope for a digital effect option on these early 1960's stories the effects are still good enough to be effective to the storyline.  This show is a anthology show of different stories;  a format that isn't around much these days.  Which is a shame and is why someone should bring back the outer limits for a third time!.",1257206400,,880,4.41358024691358
2963323,4,B000W8KY0G,"I was very happy to pick up this set of all 49 episodes for less than $32. In the bad old days of video you had to pay a lot more for a lot less and of course it took up a lot more room. This entire set is only a little thicker in it's box than the first movie of the Lord of the Rings Platinum Extended Version, ""The Fellowship Of the Ring"".

This is a no muss no fuss set of 6 (actually 7 I later learned - see below) double sided DVDs, each in their own slim plastic container. Picture quality is fine and it's a real treat to be finally able to see all 49 episodes of this very entertaining TV show anytime I want without watching edited shows on the Sci-Fi Channel which they've stopped showing in any event.

My DVD player has had no issues playing the DVDs. Some remastered video and maybe some commentaries and documetaries would have got a 5 star rating. No complaints really - I love this set.

I should add that the packaging on the 3rd Volume does not reflect the actual contents. Disc 1 is missing the last 2 titles which are in the last container. In that final container there are 2 DVDs rather than just Disc 2 as indicated on the outside so they should be Discs 2a and 2b. and they indicate a total of 9 episodes - in fact there are 11 episodes in that last container, 2 DVDs, 2 of which are listed on the packaging for Disc 1, Side B. So, in Vol. 3, Disc 1, Side A is correct while Side B is missing the last 2 titles indicated. Those 2 titles are on what should be called Disc 2a, Side A in the next container along with what should be the first 2 from that container. Then, that Disc 2a Side B has 2 more. Then Disc 2b, Side A has 4 episodes and the other side of that has the one final episode.

It's confusing as hell but all 49 episodes are there, just don't go by the packaging when you get to the last two containers for Volume 3.",1256515200,22,1855,3.9919137466307277
2963324,4,B000W8KY0G,"When I was a kid, I LOVED this show! I'm not old enough to have watched it first run, but I watched it whenever it came on. The episodes I remember most are ""Mutant"" (those 'fried egg eyes' haunted me for years!), ""The Glass Hand"", and of course, ""I, Robot"".

When I bought my DVD player 5 years ago, one of the first series I went looking for was The (original) Outer Limits, but it wasn't out yet. They had only started releasing the new ones, and I wasn't interested in those. Nice stories, but I really like the older ones better... the same way I really like The (original) Twilight Zone. In my book, the more you rely on special effects to tell your story, the less you rely on writing and acting.

The only thing that disappoints me about this set is the same thing that other people complain about; no extras, no interviews, no specials, nothing. I did have trouble getting my DVD player to recognize one of the episodes, but because of the way mine is set up, I was able to get it to work anyway by double-clicking the icon with the select button. It does seem to be a problem with the manufacturer. I haven't tried it in my son's PS2 yet. An annoying problem I find is that I can't tell ""side A"" from ""side B"". Maybe I'm missing something subtle in the teeny-tiny text, but for the life of me, I couldn't figure it out, and often got it wrong. I found it very frustrating. Also, after the first season, MGM insists on blasting you with their theme song and advertisements before getting you to their robotic version of the Outer Limits control voice every time you load the disk. Holy heck! Enough already!

What wonderful scripts & outstanding mix of guest stars.

There is nothing really wrong with this box set technically, I just remember the episodes being better than what they are. Maybe when you are over 40, your idea of what constitutes good entertainment changes. Even a classic episode like ""The Zanti Misfits"" seems a little slow and not as scary as I remember. I guess what I want to say, is that if you wish to recapture the magic you experienced as a kid growing up watching this series, that magic is probably gone, replaced with thoughts of how you would have shot, directed, and edited the episode and or series. I have yet to finish season 1, and I am in no hurry to finish watching the rest anytime soon.

As I said before, for a 40 year old plus series, there is nothing technically wrong with this series. The black & white image is sharp, with very little damage. Audio is good, sub-titles would have been nice. Maybe if you were watching this box set for the first time, you might find it interesting, but some of the stories seemed like they had run out of ideas, and were desperate for a story, episode ""ZZZZZ"" comes to mind.

2963333,4,B000W8KY0G,"This is my second review in as many that has given a zero to the poor packaging and contents and higher marks to the show itself. Let's take a look at the show first and then we'll take a look at the rest.
This is one of the top Sci-Fi shows ever to appear on television. Created by Leslie Stevens and Joe Stefano the show made its' premiere in Sept. of 1963 and WHAT a premiere it was.""The Galaxy Being"" certainly scared the living begeesus out of me and I will never forget that. The whole look and feel was totally different and it definitely was not The Twilight Zone but a deep and darker version of it. Nothing that intense had been seen on  TV before and nothing would equal it's impact for many years. The show was directly helmed by the team of Stefano and Stevens with Dominic Frontieres' great scoring in the background through all of season one. When Season two arrived all three had departed and were replaced by others. The format underwent minor changes but it basically stayed true to its' roots. The entire story is detailed wonderfully in the ""Outer Limits Companion"" by David Schow and Jeff Frentzen.
Some prefer one season over the other but there is much to recommend both. Season one has its' ""Galaxy Being"",""The Zanti Misfits"",""Second Chance"" ,""Production and Decay of Strange Particles"" and ""A Feasibility Study"".Season Two ""The Inheritors-Parts 1&2"",""Keeper of the Purple Twilight"" and one of the entire series top eps ""The Demon with the Glass Hand"".The series is filled with many well known actors like Cliff Robertson,Ted Knight,Robert Culp,Ed Asner,Eddie Albert,Robert Duvall and so many more. There is also a huge Star Trek connection as William Shatner,Leonard Nimoy and James Doohan would all make appearances,along with many of the future shows supporting actors. The ep ""Production and Decay..."" contains at least five future Trek actors at once,including Leonard Nimoy!
The show never had a big budget and many of the shows today look dated as a result but in quite a few like ""Demon..."",the props are totally minimal and it is the great script,direction and acting that more than compensate for any shortcomings in the special effects department. That the show could do so much with so little at times,is a testament to the skill of everyone involved.
It is so unfortunate it only lasted two short seasons as the show should have gone many more. As one ep in the first season states:""Maybe young people are the only ones who listen and understand-you can't reach a closed mind"".And so it was,as the almighty ratings beast dictated to the head network honchos just how they ought to proceed with shows;promising or not. The biggest shows' fans were the younger gen of the time who did write in frequently praising the show but it was the adults in the end who controlled the decision making of what to watch and they weren't generally impressed with the show;at least not enough for ABC to continue with it. To top this,in the second season it was put up against the ever popular(among the entire family) Jackie Gleason Show;and Gleason wasn't going anywhere. The show may have been cancelled but it has continued in syndication ever since staying in the collective memories of those who first saw it and gaining new fans along the way.
Now let's look at the presentation. The one thing positive about this new set is the price. The original release about eight years ago broke the series into two release sets and both at the same price(at least $10 higher than this set per season!).Everything else goes down hill from here. MGM has decided in their ""wisdom"" to re-release this set again in the double sided disc format. BAD choice,period. As I stated in my other recent review Universal and MGM(among others) have a fondness for this type of release;it is cheap and yields the greastest profit. DVDs are notoriously scuff and scratch prone and that alone should preclude any such release of this type if these companies actually cared about the product and consumers.
The second thing about this ""new"" set is...that it isn't. I do not see any difference in the transfer of this product onto DVD from the original release sets.""A Feasibility Study"" was particlularly grainy in the first release and it remains so in this one and all other eps with any excesses in this area are also the same. So the question presents itself:""Why?"".Why would MGM not remaster these eps like they should be,after all this time?
I can certainly recommend the series itself as a groundbreaking one of its' day,as many of the eps still hold up very well,despite the budgetary restrictions. But it gets a zero as far as release presentation goes. It certainly is cheaper than the original release sets but it is just a simple re-packaging of the material on hand. Shame on MGM.",1243123200,365,4792,4.794437726723095

2963339,3,B000W8KY0G,"I purchased this boxed set to replace my older Season-1 only set.  I thought I was getting a set of one-sided discs, to load into my big 400 disc mega-player.  However, when I opened the box, I found the exact same set of two-sided discs with season 2 added.  In order to be able to load them sequentially into the big player, I have to load BOTH sets, side A facing in one direction, and Side B of the other set.  I'm glad I didn't give the old set away, as obviously both are needed in my situation.  So, if you have a mega player and want to see all the content, buy two sets (a rip off), or play them in your single-disc player.

  The original series of The Outer Limits was cold-war-scare infused, cheaply produced with lots of men-in-monster-suits-all-decked-out-in-foam-rubber-and-plastic-scales-with-silly-backdrops, but it was so imaginatively done that I still, after all these years, find it compelling.  These days, we need multi-million dollar computerized digital effects just to keep us from yawning.

So now I have the whole set and it is a treasure to watch. In all it's wonderful black and white tight, artistic stories and camera work.

I was impressed with crisp clean EZ to use menus.  The B/W video and Mono audio quality was excellent.

I did miss bonus extras, and the lack of closed captions for those of us with  less than perfect hearing was also sorely missed.

Others have mention problems with the double sided discs.  My toshiba DVD player had NO such troubles.  Either disc quality has improved, or maybe these other people just need to upgrade their hardware.

2963353,5,B000W8KY0G,"When my father first watched this, he would have been about eight or nine years old. Growing up myself, Outer Limits has been one of my classical favorites. What's even more amazing, is that after forty five years, this show is still considered great. Now my father is in his fifties and I'm in my twenties, and quite amazingly we still enjoy this show even after all this time. It's even more amazing that you can watch this movie nearly anywhere, from your laptop computer, to your dvd player at home. If anything, the very fact that you can watch this anywhere would have been science fiction at the time when Outer Limits first appeared. Outer Limits was very close to Twilight Zone, with the exception that it was an hour long (although Twilight Zone had a few hour long episodes), and most of the episodes were based on alien concepts, robots, or dimensional concepts. Like Twilight Zones, you see many famous actors/actresses appearing on the show. One comes to mind would be Leonard Nimoy in ""I, Robot"" which was a great episode.

I highly recommend this collection. You will enjoy it a lot. It is in the original black and white, and each episode is about fifty minutes long and you get forty nine episodes in total, the entire collection. There is one problem though, and that is the dvds are given in double sided dvds. Which is fine and all, but after so many usage, you get a lot of finger prints on one side or the other.",1224460800,152,1435,4.519230769230769

2963355,4,B000W8KY0G,"I read all the reviews before purchasing these disks and was a little apprehensive from all the bad reviews about the DVD quality. Well, I eventually decided to take a chance and am very glad that I did. I found the quality of the episodes to be EXCELLENT. These are all B/W video. I do not see why people complain about the lack of remastering, as there would be little improvement in the quality. I bought these to view the original episodes and this is exactly what is provided. And I really could care less about ""Special Features"".

I was able to view all episodes with no problem. The double sided DVDs are a real pain and have to be handled very carefully. I agree with others that say these should be on single sided DVDs, but it doesn't appear that this is going to happen as even the new ""Complete Box Set"" that is coming out later in the year have exactly the same 7 double sided disks. So, to combat this problem, I have made backups of all the disks and only view the backup set (I have found this to be completely unnecessary for single sided disks).  Even at a 55% compression ratio, the quality of these episodes are excellent on all three of my DVD players.

I would whole heartedly recommend these DVDs to anyone with the caveat that the double sided DVDs require extra care and probably will not survive children's handling.",1221091200,,1343,4.42914979757085

Take Care",1218153600,,309,4.15
2963359,4,B000W8KY0G,"I'm glad that all 48 episodes are still in their original black and white, retaining the film noir eeriness. Each episode deals with black and white philosophical and ethical issues, often resolving to shades of ambiguous gray. The Outer Limits is more sci-fi oriented than the better known Twilight Zone, though it would be interesting to discuss which show had the greater influence on future shows and movies. The Outer Limits led to Star Trek and to the movie Terminator, both of which exerted their own influences. There is even one episode with Eddie Albert, as a successful businessman, with his elegant wife in reluctant tow, wanting to give up the rat race and start a gentleman's farm. I wonder if this episode (Cry of Silence) was the inspiration for the comedy TV series Green Acres? Except there is nothing comedic about what goes wrong on this farm, and it is perhaps the most frightening episode of the series.

Most episodes feature some kind of ""monster,"" creature, or alien, but they are not always evil and often enough it is humans that are evil, out of fear, ignorance, or the desire for power. Some of the earlier episodes have an annoyingly moralistic and preachy tone, and a lot of what I call ""filler"" - boring repetition, unnecessary dialogue, and pointless action, perhaps because The Outer Limits was an hour long and not thirty minutes like Twilight Zone. Thankfully these flaws get worked out before too long. Then, towards the end of the series, the stories and scripts are not as good again. The best episodes are sandwiched between the first and last group of episodes.

The best episodes are good, but in honesty I have to say that less than half of them are good. The worst episodes are so bad as to be nearly comical. Nonetheless, fans of this series will not be disappointed if they purchase this set, as it is reasonably priced. In one particularly bad episode the employees at a research institute are subjected to a frightening experience (a menacing cloud) in order to induce a heart attack and then given a pacemaker. In this way their loyalty to the institute is guaranteed, as any disobedience results in the short-circuiting of the pacemaker. Stronger, braver people take longer to die from fright. Sounds pretty bad, doesn't it? :-) But there are diamonds among the coals.

I'm not a fan of sci-fi, but I like this series for the same reason I like the original Twilight Zone series, because they are good stories. These episodes are not about fantastic action sequences, special effects, or blood and gore, just good old-fashioned story-telling that leaves you something to think about.

Regarding the problems with the DVD discs that some reviewers have mentioned, I have been lucky not to have any of them. I hope that those problems get worked out, and I noticed that Amazon will be offering a new complete set of DVDs in November of 2008. Perhaps they will be more reliable.

Out of 48 episodes I think the following 16 are noteworthy:

The Man Who Was Never Born - A horribly mutated man from Earth's bleak future travels back in time in an attempt to alter the past and save mankind from its hideous fate.

Corpus Earthling - A doctor with a steel plate in his head questions his own sanity when he begins hearing the conversations of a strange race of alien rock creatures intent on conquering the world.

Nightmare - A band of Earth soldiers is captured and ruthlessly tortured, both physically and psychologically, by their alien captors.

Controlled Experiment - Two Martians conduct an investigation at the scene of a murder to try to determine why humans kill one another.

ZZZZZ - A queen bee with sinister intentions is transformed into a human to seek out the perfect mate.

The Bellero Shield - An ambitious scientist, with hopes of taking over his father's corporation, creates a laser that inadvertenly brings a gentle alien to Earth.

Second Chance - Believing that they're going on a mere carnival ride, a crew of discontented dreamers unknowingly boards a space ship bound to save the future of the human race.

Moonstone - Lunar colonists find themselves in grave danger when they attempt to aid five fugitive alien scientists.

The Mutant - After being exposed to a radioactive ionic shower, a scientist on a distant planet develops telepathic abilities and is driven to madness.

Fun And Games - The fate of the entire Earth is at stake when a man and woman are transported to a satellite, where they must fight the members of an alien race for the amusement of their captors.

A Feasibility Study - The people of Earth surprise their alien captors when an entire neighborhood is transported to another planet as part of a plan to enslave the human race.

Behold, Eck! - The fate of the Earth is at stake when an optometrist discovers special lenses enabling him to see a frightening and otherwise-invisible two-dimensional creature.

Cry Of Silence - Otherworldly forces are at play as a couple of motorists find themselves roadblocked and trapped by animated tumbleweeds.

The Invisible Enemy - An encounter with extreme terror awaits a crew sent to Mars to investigate the disappearance of an earlier expedition.

The Inheritors - After being shot in the head, four soldiers gain a genius I.Q. and begin working fervently towards a mysterious scientific goal.

The Premonition - An out-of-control test flight traps a pilot and his wife in a slow-moving time warp, and they're not alone.",1214352000,2,5460,4.82441113490364

The show, I've never been a fan of.  Only maybe 4 or 5 of the original 49 episodes are ones that I enjoy watching.  At one hour, the show is just too slow-moving and the plot lines are seldom interesting.  O.L. is unfairly compared to Twilight Zone and other shows...it really did stand on its own as an innovative show from a cinematographical perspective, and the kinds of stories it presented.  They had a number of good actors as well, many of whom went on to become very famous in their own right.  But, as I say, at 53 minutes per episode, not many of which are really all that interesting, it's a very hard show for me to watch.",1437609600,3,783,4.285714285714286

3197665,4,B000W8KY0G,"TOL came out around the time The Twilight Zone was coming to an end, and while the shows were definitely similar, Zone remains far superior and better stands the test of time. That's not to say TOL wasn't worthwhile; its blend of gothic horror and sci-fi themes is certainly compelling, and it definitely helps that many episodes are shot beautifully. True, the special effects may look archaic now, but the designs for the aliens, monsters and other weird things are incredible, and seeing them filmed with deep, luscious shadows is a thing of beauty. Guest stars such as Robert Duvall, Robert Culp, Martin Landau and David McCallum liven things up as well. It's interesting to see guest stars who appeared in Zone show up in TOL, and many of them also starred or guest starred on the original Star Trek a few years later.

That's not to say it's all good though - there are definitely duds even in the first season, and while I won't call the second a total waste (Soldier and Demon with a Glass Hand are memorable standouts), the loss of the original producers is definitely felt. The show became pedestrian and felt rushed, perhaps even more a testament to how much better it had been early on.

Other standout episodes:
- The Man Who Was Never Born (a dreamy episode about time travel and the possible destruction of mankind not with weapons but with a disease, and with one of the most heartbreaking endings you'll ever see)
- The Chameleon (a human infiltrates an alien ship to see what they're up to, and finds a part of himself in them)
- Cold Hands, Warm Heart (okay, William Shatner overacts to the extreme here, but he makes this episode!)",1412380800,2,1651,4.631399317406143

a reality-or so it seemed! what many consumers got for the price we paid,were these damn,Blank MultiDiscs,that really looked and felt like they were burnt copies,,and that was one compounding insult,,the other serious insult,was that the original episodes did NOT have
the much waited for special features,nor was any thought given in the least,about the unaired TV pilot, ""PLEASE STAND BY"",which
was the very 1st Outer Limits segment-pilot made,that eventually became ""The Galaxy Being"" episode! no special features,no anything,but a damn insult,to the serious money paying consumers,who deserved way more then this! and they compounded the insult AGAIN,when they re-released the complete series in late 2008-in the same damn format,,Blank MultiDiscs! i encourage any
consumer and fan of the original series to demand that Metro Goldwyn Mayer re-release the series,on a normal,labeled DVD disc,
and that they include as many special features as they can,because the original ABC promos are on You Tube,and they should also
be included on DVDs,which in this case,they chose not to do! and since MGM and 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment are in
cohoots with each other,then the consumers need to target these people,and make that a HUGE issue,because many of the MultiDiscs i have brought from them,are FLAWED and have video malfunctions! and trying to call up their so called customer service
line,is another serious insult,because THEY DON'T CARE!! and that is NOT fair to the Fans and consumers,who got ripped-off and treated like this! in addition to the original OUTER LIMITS TV series,other classic TV shows from MGM/Fox like ""THE TIME TUNNEL"",""THE PRETENDER"",""VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA"",and other classics,have been made with these same flawed discs-so serious consumers need to get the message to MGM and 20th-stop cheapskating your consumers,and release our
TV classics on better professionally made DVD discs! because for the money we have spent on these items,our money shouldn't include video clitches and scratches on poorly manufactured DVDs-that is inexcusable!! that is the main reason why i will not buy
the Complete series collection-i refuse! if MGM and 20th are wise,then they should re-release ""OUTER LIMITS"" and the other mentioned classics through SHOUT! Factory,since their Timeless Media Classics division released ""STONEY BURKE"" last year-and in GREAT quality,too! i encourage disgruntled consumers to make their complaints known to MGM/Fox,so that they are aware of our
absolute dissatisfaction!-,because this NOT ACCEPTABLE!!",1403654400,4,2933,5.52

3197675,5,B000W8KY0G,"I love The Outer Limits.  The classic, from the early 1960's.  We watched this show as children, and it amazed, enlightened, and terrified us.  It only lasted two seasons, but it made a huge impression on me.  The first season was the best.  It featured the talents of Joseph Stephano (who wrote the screenplay for Hitchcock's Psycho).  His stories were eerie and uplifting.  Conrad Hall's cinematography was stellar.  The Outer Limits was an anthology show (different stories and characters every week), and some very young (now famous) actors and actresses appeared.  There were William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and James Doohan, soon to be piloting the Enterprise on Star Trek; Sally Kellerman, who would be most famous as Hot Lips in the M*A*S*H movie;  Martin Landau, who would win an Oscar for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi in Tim Burton's Ed Wood;  Luana Anders (catch her in Easy Rider and Dementia 13), Robert Culp (I Spy, Greatest American Hero, and many movies), David McCallum (Man from U.N.C.L.E.) and many other stars enhanced these stories.  The second season was not quite as good.  Joseph Stephano and Conrad Hall went on to other projects, and a more business-like production team was put in place.  Kenneth Peach was the cinematographer, and while his work was good, he did not capture light and shadow with the same brilliance.  Still, there are very few television shows of the caliber of The Outer Limits, and I would rather watch its worst episode than the best episode of many other programs.  It was that kind of show.  I put it  in the same class with The Twilight Zone and The X-Files.  Obviously, I like the more outr and weird in TV, and The Outer Limits supplied it!

3197681,5,B000W8KY0G,"The Outer Limits is a must for Twilight Zone fans or any fan of the science fiction genre.

Excellent scripts, fine actors, taut directing, the series had it all.  Unlike the Twilight Zone, which used suspense and surprise as its primary goal, the Outer Limits had a moral story in most shows, with the 'control voice' at the end informing us the moral of the story.  Normally, the moral was that Man is flawed, imperfect, but inherently good...at some level.

The series was not expected to be a big hit so it was shot on a shoestring.  The producers later regaled fan magazines with stories of how they had 'special effects' from the most mundane of things (many sound effects came from a vacuum cleaner).  The inexpensive sets were later used by Star Trek (the flowers with the deadly spores), among others.

Had the show spent the money to film in color, it might still be on repeats, but it would've lost something.  This was film noire on TV, science fiction as an intellectual exercise.  It was Twilight Zone writ large, with a full 60 minutes to fully develope a plotline and then, the denouement.

3197692,5,B000W8KY0G,"Fifty years ago today - on September 16, 1963 - I was among those who thrilled to the startling first broadcast of ""The Outer Limits"". Many people who saw the original series in the '60s spent decades nursing fond memories of these shows. They struck us then as boldly dramatic, hauntingly atmospheric, richly textured, sometimes profoundly philosophical and even occasionally moving. During the first season in particular, they were somehow able to get an intention across, or at least to suggest a mood - however out-of-date the style of production may seem to us now. It's hard to deny that ""The Man Who Was Never Born"" and a few other episodes do evoke a measure of ""the awe and mystery"" that the weekly intro explicitly promised.

  But for new viewers, it is difficult to understand why this series had such a powerful impact back then. Even for us die-hard original fans, it is impossible to re-experience that effect when watching the DVDs today. The turbulent world of the past half-century (!) has changed our reactions and expectations. Without the context of 1963 (the anxiety & xenophobia of the Cold War) - and without a tolerance for the tedious pace of early '60s TV - these shows may no longer seem to have the qualities we thought we saw in them when they were new. Does that consign the DVDs to nostalgic oldsters only? Not necessarily. Perhaps younger viewers can stretch their historical imaginations and find the value in these shows, especially with the help of David J. Schow's excellent book ""The Outer Limits Companion"", a detailed account of the actual production (almost everything anyone writes or says about the series is cribbed from Schow - I just wish they would plagiarize him accurately).

  Most of those involved in making these show are no longer around; those who are should still be proud that they contributed to it.  The series is still recognized as ground-breaking. Though the weaker episodes are best forgotten, the implications of some of the best ones are still written about and discussed today. Though not by me, because I personally know no one who remembers the series - a sad way to observe the 50th anniversary of ""The Outer Limits"".",1379289600,,2186,4.8445040214477215

Years later, I had a few of them on VHS. Finally, I have the whole bunch, and am so glad they're on DVD. My set plays without any problems, and the sound is great. As a blind SF fan, I would have been totally lost without the plot descriptions on the Wikipedia site. Thanks also to the reviewer who posted a disk index; you have no idea how handy that has been as I've heard these episodes! My main comment about the series is that the stories have held up quite well. I kept thinking that although this series ran between 1963 and 1965, and the technology was nothing like what we have these days, the writers were incredibly skilled, and there are twists and turns in the plots that are quite unique. For example, who would have thought of trying to prevent nuclear war by staging an alien invasion? Thank you, Amazon, for such a great series!",1378771200,2,985,4.2727272727272725

The story lines are what's important here.  There's even a bit of protest against pollution, war and prejudice that is still ongoing today.  For all television/movie students, this is a must to watch and study and to see the influence it had for future television spook-a-thons line ""The Twilight Zone"", ""Star-Trek"" and others.",1377302400,,664,4.615384615384615
3197696,5,B000W8KY0G,Having watched this so many years ago as a ten or eleven year old kid and having been scared to death by the Zanti Misfits and virtually every other episode I can honestly say this series had something to do with who I am today. You want your cold war anxiety? You want your creeping gooseflesh at some of the creepiest music even put to film? You want to see Rodger Culp turned into an alien and have to say goodbye to his wife in one of the most unsettling scenes I've ever seen? You want the real black and white stuff that will turn your hair white overnight? Here it is.,1376870400,,575,4.142857142857143
3197697,4,B000W8KY0G,"The only thing that gets me sometimes is often the episodes have a negative ending with the characters screwed. It kind of deflates the viewer as they are rooting for the protagonist and he/she ends up in a horrible situation.

3197700,5,B000W8KY0G,"Along with The Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits is a landmark series that featured science fiction as no series had before. The Outer Limits featured:

Great stories,including:

The Galaxy Being
The Architects of Fear
Fun & Games
The Chameleon
Demon with a Glass Hand
I, Robot
The Inheritors (Parts 1&2)

Excellent actors, including:
Robert Duval, Sally Kellerman, Robert Culp, Cliff Robertson, Jack Palance, and others

The series held many of us spellbound during its original transmission.

My recommendation, is that you get the Single-Sided (Region 2) sets for Season One and Season Two from Amazon. UK - they are no more expensive than the US sets, yet are on Single-Sided rather than Double-Sided discs.",1373932800,,709,5.184210526315789

The stories , the beautiful black and white photography , the direction, the atmospheric music, and of course the incredible monsters , known by the writers  as the ""Bears"". It also had some of the best actors in television in every episode of the series. Some of my favorite episodes were ""The Sixth Finger"", The Man Who Was Never Born"" , "" The Architechs of Fear"", and ""The Zanti Misfits"". Then the second season came and the producers changed everything about the series. The stories, the photography, the music, and the monsters weren't as imaginative. I watched every episode but it wasn't the same . The network cancelled the show before the season was half over.

3197711,5,B000W8KY0G,"The Outer Limits is my favorite show for many reasons. The first is the introduction, which is one of the most iconic moments in television history. The narrator explaims we control the virtual and horizontal and has taken control of your television sets. This give the impression that some other worldly force is at work.  The Outer Limits may also feature the most impressive black and white cinematography shown on television. In many respects it is shot like a moody horror film, yet the show is probably the most pure science fiction ever produced for television. Each episode has a strong grounding in science fiction, morality, and atmosphere. The eerie black and white atmosphere also gives the aliens and characters in the stories a haunting appearance. The special effects though not elaborate by today's standards, are sufficiently imaginative to overcome any budgetary restraints. One of the main problems with science fiction today is that special effects are used to carry inferior storylines and characterizations. The Outer Limits featured excellent scripts and interesting characters. This should not be surprising since the show featured upcoming stars and future science fiction writers like Harlen Ellison.

What is surprising is that this impressive show only lasted two seasons and 49 episodes. This should be further evidence that network executives have little clue on what makes a good science fiction show. It should also be noted that the producers of the Outer Limits were in constant conflict with the network over creative content of the show.

After nearly 50 years the show has lived on, which is not bad when you consider how short the show ran in its original run.",1369526400,,1698,5.144927536231884

The erie beginning always caught my attention. My favorite episode to this day is still 'The Mutant', but enjoyed the entire series. I held off buying when they started releasing season dvds in hopes that the complete series would someday be released. The set does contain all episodes and whether remastered or not, its a thrill to watch, and have no beefs about picture quality or sound.

Using that Cold War dark themed paranoia in all of its themes sent chills up and down my spine when I was a child. I found the galaxy being most terrifying and had nightmares about it for years not understanding that he was benevolent and not really malevolent, but hey, I was a kid. The time I was growing up the monsters looked really cool. Perhaps lame by today's standards but photographed in black and white in a film noir style pretty scary stuff.

3197728,4,B000W8KY0G,"I received The Outer Limits DVD Set as a Christmas gift.  The DVD set is wonderful - great for old time sci-fi fans.  Many now well-known actors appeared in The Outer Limits such as Robert Culp, Leonard Nimoy, Ivan Dixon, Martin Landau, Robert Duvall, Sally Kellerman, etc.  It was funny seeing The Man from U.N.C.L.E.'s Illya Kuryakin/NCIS's Ducky with a huge head.  This set has brought back many childhood memories although the series was short-lived.  I had no problem with the DVD's playing and they loaded well (at least the first DVD).  The packaging is not good at all.  The DVD's are not marked and the box is very chintzy.  I don't expect the box to last long even though I take good care of my things.

3197729,4,B000W8KY0G,"I recently ordered the box set ""The Outer Limits"" original series. I have watched all the episodes over and over again, and each time it is better than the last. The picture and sound quality are excellent. Once in awhile you will see a little grain in some of the scenes but nothing that takes away from the overall presentation. One point to make is that MGM got a little cheap by putting the entire series on seven double sided discs. They are easy to scratch and get fingerprints on which will cause playback problems, however, I clean these discs each time I play them, and handle them by the edges only. I have an average Sony DVD recorder/player and as many times that they have been played I have yet to see any of them skip. You take care of your discs and handle them properly and you will have no trouble with this set. The Chiller channel was showing ""The Outer Limits"" awhile back, but there was 10 min cut from each episode in order to fit in the time slot. These episodes are made to be seen in their entirety and that is what you get with this set. All 49 episodes are here, complete and uncut on 7 double sided discs. They are attractively packaged and include all release dates when shown for each episode. I highly recommend this set for its overall quality and for anyone who is a fan of the best Si-Fi series, ""The Outer Limits"".

3197731,5,B000W8KY0G,"This wonderful collection of Sci Fi/paranormal/out-there ideas still holds the test of time today for quality story-telling. The Outer Limits reminds man of his universal faults and strengths. Each self-contained episode was full of a wonderfully-told story and a classic moral at the end. Think Aesop's Fables meets the Twilight Zone.

In addition to the great story telling, many of favorite Baby Boomer actors and actresses had early rolls on the show. David McCallum (Man from U.N.C.L.E. and NCIS) is in the very first episode and does a phenomenal job as a man who has the chance to advance his intelligence considerably -- and of course, mystery ensues.

This is a set of shows (in black and white) that you can watch with your kids. Any ""monsterish"" characters aren't scary by today's standards at all! And who doesn't want to teach their kids a good moral. The stories are clever and surprising.

A great investment for your home DVD library.",1356566400,,950,4.925

3197738,3,B000W8KY0G,I was very excited when I purchased this old classic show. I knew I had seen some good and bad episodes years ago. I figured I would get into the series as it went along. Unfortunately I found that I often fell asleep in many of the espisodes. Some stories are pretty decent while others are simply dreadful relying on stupid monsters or some hokey dimension monster or some energy creature etc. I have the first five seasons of the New Outer Limits and it is by far the better product. It seems the problem with the original series was simply the weak sci-fi writing. The writers simply didn't know where they were going with a lot of the original stories. They didn't seem to know how to flesh out the ideas. So for the classic episodes that are in this collection I will give the show three stars but I can give only three stars because many episodes are simply tedious and dreadful.,1346371200,,886,4.408536585365853
3197739,5,B000W8KY0G,"I just received this set and am delighted with it. I really thought hard about it because of the negative comments but my set has a total of 7 double sided disks all of which play just fine.  As far as picture quality, it's just as good as when I watch the episoded on tv or hulu.  Were they remastered? NO.  Are they very watchable and good quality, I think so.  I also did not have the issue with missing episodes and have posted a disk by disk listing of what was actually on the dvd's that I received.  If you loved the Outer Limits, this is well worth buying and I see the price has gone done even further than when I purchased it a week ago, a real bargain!

Double-sided DVDs aren't my favorite, but sometimes they're all that's available and you want something so bad you get it knowing you're not going to be particularly happy.  I was pleasantly surprised in watching Season 1, Disc 1 - quality was superb and my immediate thought was that maybe - just maybe, the technology had improved.  Fooled me.  Disc 2, Season 1 was a total DISASTER!  It wouldn't play on one side and on the other side the video and audio quality was abysmal - in other words, it's one I'll use for a Frisbee or target practice.  Naturally, my viewing of this abomination came after the 30 day limit, so I can't return the piece of trash.  Anyone know where I can find just that one disc?  eBay maybe?

At this point, I don't particularly care if I watch any of the other discs or not because I might be setting myself up for more disappointments.

A word of Warning - Buyer Beware!  If you're contemplating purchasing this item, remember, one or more discs might be a piece of garbage.  Just make sure you watch them all within the 30-day return window.

As the series progresses, many of the episodes default to aliens and space travelers.  Some good episodes which avoid these frequent plots include ""The Zanti Misfits,"" ""The Guests,"" ""The Forms of Things Unknown,"" and ""Don't Open Till Doomsday.""  ""Demon with a Glass Hand"" is innovative and imaginative.  I think my favorite episode, thus far, is ""Cry of Silence"" with menacing tumbleweeds in the desert.  The rest of the disc I've just started seem to all involve aliens, spaceships, and robots.  ""Cold Hands, Warm Heart"" is just downright boring without any real point I can discern.

Of course it all depends on the condition of the original elements. The OT transfers are a bit iffy here, especially some of the audio.

I find the episodes refreshingly fun and sometimes still scary to watch.

But I also am having issues with some disks, in particular some episodes having freezes, skips etc.
The Zannti Misfits episode would only play about 3\4th through before skipping and freezing till it was not watchable.
The Mice episode played about halfway through, but when I restarted it now it won't play at all.
The packaging is ok and not the problem........I think some of the disks have errors from the factory.
I have no idea how many others are going to be a problem since I am only starting the third disk.

It is really too bad people are having problems and cant count on the Outer Limits set to play as expected.
I don't think its worth the shipping cost and hassle to send them back.
We Outer Limit fans can only hope that someday a reliable set will be released.

Update:Ive watched the rest of this series and haven't had any further problems with freezes etc.

3197753,5,B000W8KY0G,"THE OUTER LIMITS predates the imitative THE X FILES by three decades, and yet for me, it's the earlier show that stands the test of time better. Watching the series now, I'm struck with how much Chris Carter took from OUTER LIMITS for his own show, although he usually cites THE TWILIGHT ZONE and THE NIGHT STALKER as his main influences.

THE OUTER LIMITS ran for just two seasons - 1963-'65 - but it pushed the boundaries in the way television presented science fiction, horror, and paranormal phenomena. The opening sequence in which a voice assures us that ""there is nothing wrong with your television set"" and that ""we are controlling transmission"", was a brilliant concept, and probably the best opening of any T.V. show before or since. It was a way of acknowledging us as being not just detatched observers, but active participants in what was about to unfold. I vividly remember being simultaneously terrified and fascinated by it as a three - four year old when the show went into its first rerun in the mid-'60's. It was on a weeknight from 8 - 9 P.M., and I literally couldn't be torn away to go to bed until that ""control voice"" came on again to reassure me that my TV was back to normal.

The scripts were always intelligent and thought provoking, being written by some of the most respected sci-fi authors in the business at the time. The first season contains the cream of the crop; some of my favorite episodes are ""The Hundred Days of the Dragon"", ""The Sixth Finger"", "" The Man Who Was Never Born"", ""Obit"", ""The Zanti Misfits"", ""Zzzz"", ""The Mutant"", ""Fun and Games"", and ""The Forms of Things Unknown"". Second season highlights include ""Cold Hands, Warm Heart"", ""Behold Eck"", ""Demon With a Glass Hand"", ""I, Robot"" and the two parter, ""The Inheritors"".  However, the entire series is well above your average TV fare, and while its influence on other shows is clearly evident, OUTER LIMITS still retains its uniqueness and timelesness.

The have been digitally remastered and fit on HD wide Screen TV's, video and audio quality is excellent! The DVD's are double sided, this was a bit of a downside because they are not labeled, they are only numbered, you really can't tell what's on what side of the disk until it's loaded in your player.

My complaint is with the packaging. The discs are 2 sided and aren't labeled so you'll have to squint to see the tiny writing on the inner part of the disc to figure out which disc you have in hand and if it's side A or B. This might sound easy but trust me, this writing is tiny! And whatever you do, don't mix up your discs!! You'll go into the outer limits trying to figure them out!
You know how you're sitting around and you think of a particluar show and want to watch it? You can do just that with this movie set, but it won't be easy finding which disc and which side.
All in all, I'm thrilled to have these episodes to watch at will, I'm just not happy at all with the way the discs were made or how they're presented.
If you're a fan like me, it's worth it ... but plan to grit your teeth here and there!",1315440000,2,984,4.0
3197761,2,B000W8KY0G,"This review is largely based on my experience with this set and of the past of this same series.  Otherwise the set is plain basic no extras of any kind in slim disc cases in a thin cardboard holder for the set.  Not considering the defects mentioned below I would rate this set about a 4.5, just because it's plain basic doesn't make it bad considering the price I paid was about $32 OTD (out the door) fulfilled by Amazon.

Experienced numerous stoppages/disc failure (player ejects disc), freezes with this set.  The first error noticed is on volume 1 Disc 1 titled The Galaxy being.  Second is on volume 2 Disc 2 Fun and Games, chapter 4, 6:20 minutes.  Third is volume 3 Disc 2-3 The Brain of Colonel Barham, chapter 5, 1:15 minutes.  These issues are repeatable, meaning the player will react at the same point repeatedly.  Most likely there are other errors in this set because not all episodes have been viewed.

Generally most, including myself, would consider a defective product just one of those things that is remote, perhaps a small percentage of the whole for a given source.  I have some of the episodes of this same series on LD (laserdisc) and it too suffers from defects in the form of laser rot, a defect that is rather specific to LD.  Meanwhile I have the Twilight Zone on LD, individual DVD volumes, and in recent years the entire series in a DVD box set.  No issues at all with any of the discs.  Same goes for most videos on disc with a few exceptions.  Those exceptions are of titles that tend to be rather obscure or perhaps comparatively poor sellers.

I feel the defects are because of the studio/distributor because they dictate the quality standard for the replicator.

My suggestion is to play, not fast forward, all episodes within a timely manner that is well within the return period.  This series being about 2500 minutes will not be easy to evaluate within the return period.  Playing the discs without actually viewing will not ensure it being defect free because a defect may cause the player to skip a chapter or two and keep playing.

Amazon fulfilled this purchase making return easy but delayed because the seller never responded.",1314576000,3,2173,4.641361256544503
3197762,5,B000W8KY0G,"Point 1:
Buy this, because it's great stuff.  But when you get it, take the discs out of the original packaging and put them in some better form of storage.  Two of the seven discs in my set have cracked a little bit around the hole because the original cases hold them too tightly.

Point 2:
Some reviewers have written that the digital transfers are bad.  I actually let this keep me from buying the DVD's for a long time.  After watching about a third of the episodes, my opinion is that the transfers are perfect.  Any flaws in graininess, contrast, etc, appear to me to be artifacts from the original filming.  Sometimes, what now looks like a flaw was actually done deliberately with fabric or vaseline in front of the lens.  The degree of contrast in a transfer is a rather subjective thing.  In these transfers, blacks are black, whites are white, and there is plenty of gray scale in between.  So, I don't see how they could be any better.  Likewise, I don't hear anything wrong with the audio:  the audio quality just seems true to the source material.

* * * * *

I was watching when this show first debuted on my 11th birthday.  I have loved the series my whole life.  In the '80's I tried to tape them all on VHS from late-night reruns, and bought prerecorded VHS tapes of the ones that got away.  Now I can enjoy them much better than that.  Of course I wish that the DVD's weren't 2-sided, that the packaging was better, etc, etc.  But these will do for now.  I'll probably buy them again later in some new and better format.  It will probably always be my all-time favorite TV series, or nearly so.

By the way, get the book too:  ""The Outer Limits:  The Official Companion"" by David J. Schow and Jeffrey Frentzen.  It's fascinating and it adds a lot to your viewing experience, especially if you've already seen the episodes many times and formed your impressions about them.",1312070400,5,1892,4.446064139941691

I would recommend this series to any one interested in 60's sci-fi, it is now very dated and the special effects are not up to present CGI capability, but considering what little they, the originators of the special effects, did have to work with, I think the special effects people have done a great job.

The Outer Limits : The Complete Original Series Volumes 1-3  contains a total of 2515 minutes of some great viewing. All of the episodes are black and white and were filmed during 1963-64. Full frame 1.33:1 ratio. Each episode runs around 50 minutes long.
The set breaks down to Vol. 1 with 16 episodes...Vol. 2 with 16 episodes...Vol. 3 with 17 episodes.
Packaging has a outer laminated cardboard boxing which holds 6 inner plastic DVD casings. Each plastic casing holds 1 double-sided DVD....except for Volume 3 Disc 2-3 which holds 2 double-sided discs. All of the discs play fine on my player...have not had any problems at all.
Like other reviewers I always considered The Twilight Zone as the definitive Sc-Fi series of all time, the Outer Limits was never even considered. After watching this collection my view of The Outer Limits has definitely changed. Created with an obvious low television budget, props were at a minimum, monsters looked kind of hokey ....but the rich story material and superior acting more than made up for it. I can now say this series is on par with the Twilight Zone.
Like the Twilight Zone ; The Outer Limits was a true acting playground for future stars such as : Robert Culp, Robert Duvall, Cliff Robertson, Dabney Coleman, Martin Sheen, Adam West, Donald Pleasance and many others. It also featured a few  actors from a ""future"" television series that would be known to us as ""Star Trek"" such as : Leonard Nimoy, William Shatner and James Doohan.
It is hard to pick out all the best episodes out of these 49 shows but a few that come to mind are : "" The Zanti Misfits "", "" The Sixth Finger "", "" The Hundred Days Of The Dragon "", "" Nightmare "" and "" Specimen: Unknown "".
This was also a very affordable collection , it sold on Amazon at Christmas for a low price of $29.88.

The Outer Limits brings back nostalgic memories of a time when families sat around the television set together and when you didn't need blood, guts and extreme violence to be entertained.  It's nice to see these old favourites available for both young and old to enjoy all over again.  For those of you who loved the Outer Limits in younger days, or for the younger generation who want to see what all the fuss was about, I would thoroughly recommend anyone to buy this beautifully presented boxed set, grab the popcorn and sit back for some seriously good sci-fi.",1293667200,4,726,4.576923076923077
3197781,4,B000W8KY0G,"The idea behind this show has always been interesing to me, but based on other reviews and comments about missing episodes and an inability to access certain shows, I almost did not make this purchase. After researching to be sure I understood exactly what I should be getting, I decided to take a chance on Amazon's reputation. When the product arrived, I checked it over carefully, watched every episode, and found no defects or missing episodes.

Overall, the shows were delightful. I would have rated the show 5 stars, but most of the special effects, especially the creatures, were ""cheesy."" (Think people dressed up in costumes.) If you refuse to be distracted by that, however, and evaluate the show for its entertainment value, this is a good purchase. Looking for a pleasant escape from reality for an evening? Try opening this box. Just don't expect to be able to compare it to a big box office Hollywood production.",1292716800,2,926,4.860759493670886

No commercials really improves the quality of the stories - a local station is broadcasting reruns of The Outer Limits and it really chops the stories up with commercials, which is a major reason why I got this complete set. The cheapie special effects and mostly excellent scripts and acting are enhanced by the episodes being in black & white - it causes the viewer to use their brain to imagine, and at least for me, be the basis of some really entertaining dreams at night when I sleep after watching an episode. I highly recommend this box set.",1292544000,,727,4.557251908396947

I remember watching this original series in early reruns as a kid. It was and still is some great storytelling and in watching several episodes the viewer can see that some story lines haven't changed much in almost 50 years even with new Sci-Fi shows. Of course there are what I feel are stand out episodes that are as good today as anything made. And there are also some corny episodes too given the era and morals they were made in. Even with it all in black and white, it remains a great series that I highly recommend! And the great Amazon price and no commercials and with none of the stuff on a TV screen one has to sit through nowadays makes this collection one of the best ways to really enjoy the series.",1292371200,3,848,4.407643312101911

3197788,5,B000W8KY0G,"Okay, I'll admit it.  I was trying, in part, to recapture my youth by watching one of my favourite childhood TV series again.  As an adult, it has taken on a whole new meaning for me.  I was able to appreciate the simple moral messages that were evident in each of the episodes; some of them very applicable to today's society.  Simple messages like, ""Look after Mother Earth - or else!""  I was actually just wanting to watch one particular episode that had stuck in my memory, but ended up watching all of them with interest.  Despite the patently fake looking special effects and the black and white playback, I just loved them and would highly recommend them - to a person of any age.",1289606400,,687,4.456
3197789,4,B000W8KY0G,"Back in the early 60's, a sci-fi show came along in the form of a ""Twilight Zone"" wanabee called, ""The Outer Limits."" It did not last long back then, although a later color version (also quite good) has since appeared. The original OUTER LIMITS (basically 1963-65) was a real trip, even by today's standards, and while there ARE some crappy episodes (as seems with every TV sci-fi/fantasy series there ever was), a good majority of these original Outer Limits episodes still hold up, and quite well.

In fact, almost too well. If you are at all squeamish or easily frightened by strange, crawling or ethereal, very alien, both good and evil creepy entities, both cerebral and not, and some things from your worst nightmares, I'd advise you to read the episode descriptions before watching, especially late at night. For while almost half of the episodes of the original series are very talkative, slow moving and complex, about a dozen or so of these stand out as truly intelligent/wise comments on not only the human condition in general, but about the cold war era and the frightening nuclear paranoia of the times in particular.

What's ultimately clear is that almost every episode is a moral allegory of some sort.  The famous ""there is nothing wrong with your television set"" CONTROL VOICE most often sets up the story, and its supposed philosophical roots, then comes back at the end to tell the viewer what ""lesson"" they've just hopefully learned. While this was kind of gimmicky and was dropped entirely in a few episodes, this show was way ahead of its time, especially considering today's almost totally inept network TV sci-fi offerings. In fact, about the only thing going for sci-fi programs after this, have been and are much better special effects. No sci-fi shows today however, whether network or syndicated, come close to the overall quality of the ideas expressed in most of the 48 episodes here (one is a two-parter).

The worst episodes of this, the original series, are at least entertaining. The best episodes though, really make the viewer THINK. And while the sum of the whole and the rather dull presentation (no extra DVD features) keeps this from getting 5 stars, the price is right and this should be a must-buy for any TV sci-fi series collector. Seeing several actors and actresses appearing here in minor or major parts, BEFORE they became much better known and true celebrities is fun, and there are many of them. Nick Adams, Eddie Albert, Ed Asner, Dabney Coleman, Michael Constantine, Robert Culp, Bruce Dern, Robert Duvall, Sally Kellerman, Martin Landau, David McCallum, Vera Miles, William Shatner & Leonard Nimoy & James Doohan (Star Trek), Lloyd Nolan, Warren Oates, Donald Pleasence, Cliff Robertson, Martin Sheen, Adam West, Nancy Malone, and countless others.

All episodes were and are well written and directed, and thankfully, none feature this whole new shaky-zoomy, no shot longer than 3 second, Michael Bay-ish ""style"" seen so frequently today on such horrible fare as ""The Office"" (ugh) and the truly awful (and unwatchable for me) updated version of Battlestar Galactica (gag). I mean really, the first thing I learned in film school was to use the zoom feature as little as possible, and when exactly was it when ""tripod"" became a dirty word?

The constant and consistent theme throughout this original show is all about ""control"" and/or the lack of it, and if one considers it for a moment, the lack of control over any given situation in life (even in sci-fi fantasy worlds), is more often than not, truly scary. This theme is what makes the show so great, and so many episodes truly remarkable and unforgettable. In fact, while watching all 48 episodes in their original broadcast air date order, this factor, this idea of not being in control, became very clear to me. This theme is also what makes many of the best episodes truly frightening or at least deeply thought provoking.

For me, the ten best episodes (in no specific order) are ""The Architects of Fear,"" ""The Sixth Finger,"" ""Nightmare,"" ""The Zanti Misfits,"" ""Controlled Experiment"" (the only humorous episode of the lot), ""The Mutant,"" ""Fun and Games,"" ""A Feasibility Study,"" ""Cold Hands, Warm Heart,"" and ""The Probe"" (which was the last episode of the original series). Of these gems, perhaps the scariest and most memorable episodes for me personally are ""Nightmare"" and ""The Zanti Misfits."" The first is very aptly named, and the second should definitely not be watched alone, late and in the dark, where things go bump in the night. Or crawl up your arm making weird faces at you and even weirder noises.

It's a real shame that there is nothing even approaching this on television today, especially in science fiction, but that's as may be. This program showed an enormous respect for its viewers, and for moral intelligence in general, and for those reasons alone, it will always remain something quite special, even after almost half a century.

3197790,5,B000W8KY0G,I remember this series as a child. I was only twelve at the time. The Outer Limits was a budget series. Its special effects were done on a tight budget. All 49 episodes were done in black and white. I particularly liked the musical score by Dominic Frontiere. Many Hollywood stars appeared in these episodes before they were well known. They were obviously created for adult viewing.,1286841600,,383,4.731343283582089

3197792,3,B000W8KY0G,"What?  Only 3 stars?  Well, I will have to admit that for many years I considered Outer Limits to tell a fairly superior tale, as compared to Twilight Zone, which I thought to be really gimmicky.  And after watching every episode in this Outer Limits anniversary edition I'm persuaded that many of the stories, in my opinion, really aren't so great after all, even after making the necessary allowance for antique Fx.  In fact I've been growing more fond of the Twilight Zone, it seems.

I will, however, call your attention to one exceptional episode:  ""Controlled Experiment,"" dated Jan 13, 1964.  Call it droll or funny or campy--it's absolutely delightful.  It stars Carroll O'Connor (All In The Family) and Barry Morse (The Fugitive tv series) and features prominently Grace Lee Whitney (Yeoman Rand, Star Trek TOS).  Just seeing these veteran actors back in the ""early days"" was a real pleasure.  And this one episode I must say was nearly worth the price of the whole package.",1284940800,,983,4.867469879518072
3197793,5,B000W8KY0G,The Outer Limits came out in the 60's when I was a young kid and I always enjoyed watching the TV show and it was great to watch the shows again and see the difference on things that I missed.,1284422400,,192,3.825
3197794,5,B000W8KY0G,"Purchased as a gift, this series is still an excellent watch!  My son loves it and has rewatched many of the shows. Old fashioned Sci-Fi that stands the test of time. You must buy it!",1283817600,,183,4.228571428571429
3197795,5,B000W8KY0G,"I was a little kid who really enjoyed science fiction when the original (and to me the only real) Outer Limits premiered. It was with great anticipation that I watched the first episode, with its novel beginning about how they take over your television set. Of course being the brat I was, I got up and turned off the television and turned it back on and changed channels just to say ""nyah"" to the voice on the show.

I think I was too young for this series. It didn't hold my attention, as it was more talky and complex than Twilight Zone. While I would watch the shows, I didn't understand all of it.

I bought this set after reading the plot summaries of the episodes, many of which I remembered, because they sounded so interesting. Unlike some of the reviewers, I had no problems at all playing the discs on my dvd player. I really do not like double-sided discs and would prefer the standard one-sided ones, but they play fine.

Now that I'm older and maybe a little bit wiser or more intelligent, I appreciate the stories much more than back in the 60's when a lot of it went over my head. I have to say that the special effects and props are laughingly cheesy and some of the logistics don't make any sense, but what I admire are the premises for these episodes. I mean, they had really great ideas for each show and so many of them brought a chill to me as I watched them for the first time after mucho years.

The only thing I don't really care for is the ""lesson"" that is taught at the end of each episode. Sure, it's relevant but I could just as well do without the preaching. Nevertheless, this was a television series aimed at the thinking person (unlike the remakes, which were just plain horrible) and I am glad I bought this. Amazon has a very good price for the box set that contains the entire series.

Oh, a note about the video and audio quality: don't expect much. It is passable but that's about it.  Picture quality is uneven and sometimes there is a thin stripe on one side of the screen; the film is very grainy at times; the audio levels are not always stable.

3197798,4,B000W8KY0G,"I would give this collection five stars if it is not like the first official release was with the double sided DVDs and the change in the menu that ruined
the experience and keeps me from purchasing this new set.

Does anyone know if the newest Complete Collection still has this lame change in the menu, that is, does the ""control voice"" in the newest release still say:

There is nothing wrong with your DVD player. Do not attempt to adjust the picture. We are controlling your DVD player. We already control the horizontal and the vertical. We now control the digital. We can change the focus from a soft blur to crystal clarity. Sit quietly and we will control all that you see and hear. You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to... The Outer Limits.

?

I think people making these decisions have to be young, because people my age, who lived when this series first came out, would never change what the control voice said.

I would purchase the new DVD set if I thought it didn't have that lame change on the menu.

Does anyone at this site know if ""they"" put back the original control voice in the menu of the newly release DVD?

called, ""The Outer Limits"".  It was back in the late 1950's
when science fiction was at its greatest.  There were a couple
of shows that were produced for television back then.  This
Show, ""The Outer Limits"" was a special show.  The writers
were very talented as they created story lines that seemed so

The double-sided discs don't seem soo bad; and there are lots of DVD Collections which do not give much of a guide.  My set seems to play as the versions of the show were shown way back when.

3197802,3,B000W8KY0G,"I did not buy this set, nor do I own it. I do however, own the individual seasons of this set. I state this only because box sets often come with extras. If this set does, I have no way of knowing about it. However, about the episodes that make of the set, I have much to say. Many episodes are made of decent stories for the time period, the special effects hokey at best, pitiful at times, and as one would guess limited to a tight budget. There are many scenes with which I found myself confused or able to see mistakes that should have been edited out. The story's are mostly weak, sometimes OK, and rarely good or great. There are three stories that warrant the purchase however, one is famous for it's retelling of the Isaac Asimov story ""Robot"" with Leonard Nimoy, who really pulls off the whole episode almost to the point of making this collection worth whatever price they charge. The second is a story about greed and how to dispose of prisoners. We did it with Australia, who is to say that other planets have not found a way to create penal colonies elsewhere. In this story, that is just what happens, as a ship of prisoners lands in one of our deserts. The third is the only two parter in the series that I can remember, and it's a different take on the ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" theme. Those three episodes in my opinion are the very best of the series. There are a few others barley worth mentioning, but enjoyable to a point, nonetheless. The rest, I can only say were a complete waste of time in my humble opinion. Many hours of my life gone, that I will never see again. But, by my own choice. So, buy this if you are a serious collector of this sort of stuff/nostalgia like myself. I had remembered conning my parents to let me stay up late to see these, biting my nails weekly until the very next episode I was so excited. Too bad, as an adult, I just find them missing something I remembered as a child.

Instead, I was very positively surprised! The menus are very easy to navigate through, and the image and sound quality are very good for a show that was aired more than 45 years ago. The screen format obviously is not widescreen, but I suppose that would be too much to ask for.

The only complaint I have is regarding the double-sided discs not presenting a clear A or B-side label. There are markings, yes, but they are tiny and kinda hidden in the DVD label, which many people with poor vision simply can't read. Shame on you, MGM.

NOTE: Closed Captions are available. When playing the discs on my notebook I found out that I am able to choose Closed Captions in the media player, and they work just fine.

This is because of a combination of top notch acting, execllent directing and script writing, and careful use of camera effects combining to create an atmosphere that makes this, and every episode in the series, riveting. These are qualities that rise above any particular date at which the drama was filmed, and make a series like this one timeless. This is a series that takes seriously the material it presents.  In any series that are this old, there is a tendancy to compare to modern science fiction shows the effects and sets and  presentation of the material.  Frankly I think The Outer Limits holds up better than some of the modern series. Again, it's because of the care and respect given to the material.

For example, in the series opening episode , when the strange glowing radioactive being who was drawn into this world by accident, is wandering down the sidewalk of a street at night, the camera takes you on that disturbing walk from within the creature's perspective, you see the crackling magnetic energy disrupting and overturning trash cans, shattering windows, radiation causing objects to glow, and then the creature wanders into a closed pawn shop and you see this utterly alien yet intelligent creature picking up and examining figurines and jewelry boxes and instruments, and you get a sense that this creature is as curious and fascinated about the contrivances of our world as we would be of his world. But what is most notable is the interaction between humans and this alien, trying to understand each other, trying to communicate, and when they finally achieve that on a rudimentary level, it feels like a tremendous accomplishment. And that's just the opening episode.

The series has well known star actors including;  Ed Asner, Martin Sheen, Robert Duval, Martin Landau and Leonard Nimoy.

Great science fiction author Harlan Ellison wrote two of the series stories, ""Demon With a Glass Hand"" and ""Soldier"".

Each episode is a stand alone drama confronting a different frontier of the unexplained, science pushing the cutting edge, people in the real world intertwining with the stark idea that other worlds and other dimensions exist. It is a journey worth taking. This is a great investment in a highly entertaining and thought provoking series.  The disks are double sided, but they worked flawlessly. The video is very clean, very sharp, excellent. The audio also is very clear.

To get an idea of the series you can watch some full episodes online for free at the IMDB ( Internet Movie Database ).  Simply go to the IMDB web site on the internet and type in the search term ""outer limits 1963"", and you will find links to some of the full episodes.

But it doesn't compare to having the DVD's to watch on your home televsion screen as they were meant to be viewed.

3197811,3,B000W8KY0G,"I don`t think this is the best tv-series i have seen, but it does have some good episodes. From what i seen from this show, i actually prefer the updated 90`s version, which i think are more dark and adult and have better episodes. They don`t have monsters in every episode.

I even think the intro and the voice controller of the new OL is better. Still i think the original is good, but they rely heavily on a monster in nearly every episode. That may not be a bad thing, but the depends on who you ask and if they like monsters. I like monsters, but not in every episode.

Ok, enough about the 90`s version. I like The Sixth Finger. I think David McCallum played his part very well. I also felt this could have worked liked as an Twilight Zone episode. One thing,the doubled sided discs are not good.  They could also have used single sided DVDs.

Greedy studio. I don`t like double sided discs even one bit. Especially clear white faced dics that it is nearly bound to come so many finger prints on the DVD over time that one i would stop playing or just skip and freeze heavily when you watch a episode.

3197812,3,B000W8KY0G,"Star Trek's first season began in the fall of 1966.  Two years before, in the fall of 1964, three of the actors that would appear in the Star Trek series, appeared in the third season of 'The Outer Limits'.

In 'Cold Hands, Warm Heart' (Rating 4), William Shatner (Capt. Kirk) plays an astronaut, who has just returned from the first orbit around the hot planet Venus, and now he finds Earth's climate a bit too cold for him.  The name of his mission: 'Project Vulcan'.

In 'Production and Decay of Strange Particles' (Rating 1), Leonard Nimoy (Mr. Spock) plays a lab technician at an experimental atomic reactor.  Something goes wrong and particles in the reactor take on a nasty life of their own; Nimoy goes in to save another technician.

In 'I Robot' (Rating 5), Nimoy plays a newspaper reporter who assists the beautiful niece of a scientist who invented a robot.  Unfortunately, the scientist is dead and the robot is now accused of murder.  (Asimov-like story.)

In 'Expanding Human' (Rating 3), James Doohan (Scotty) plays a police detective investigating a series of mysterious murders.  He suspects the experimental conscious expanding drugs at the university are somehow connected to the case.

Most of the stories in 'The Outer Limits' series have a nightmarish quality - replete with monsters and creatures of every description.  All of these shows take themselves seriously, all but one, that is.  In 'Controlled Experiment' (Rating 5), they take a break from the nasty old monsters and have a little fun with two Martians who want to understand the human propensity to murder each other.  Their struggle to understand this alien concept is quiet humorous.

3197818,3,B000W8KY0G,"THE OUTER LIMITS-THE COMPLETE ORIGINAL SERIES
This is, without a doubt, one of the best series ever on television.  Some reviews complain that there are no closed captions, but that is a minor problem.  My only serious complaint is that while all of the episodes are listed on each plastic container, some episode are NOT, in fact, available.  For example, on Disc One, episodes 33-40, the information says that Side B contains four episodes, beginning with the classic, ""Demon With the Glass Hand"".  That side has only two episodes instead of the listed four.  There are other strange exclusions with no warning.  There are no liner notes to explain these exclusions.
BUT, as a series, The Outer Limits had some of the best writing and (occasional) acting for its time.  For truly creepy and scary atmospherics, this can't be beat.  The productions are magnificent, even with the obvious budgetary restrictions faced by the creators.  Some are masterpieces of ""film noir"".

Of course the 1990's version has digital effects and the sixties version has more primitive effects. Still the 1960's stories are brilliant moral plays and lessons written by the best sci fi writers in the business at the time. The acting is all first class and filled with true artists, even the directors are top notch. Few series are this good overall and in spite of it's age and lack of color , it's the stories that matter , even if one could hope for a digital effect option on these early 1960's stories the effects are still good enough to be effective to the storyline.  This show is a anthology show of different stories;  a format that isn't around much these days.  Which is a shame and is why someone should bring back the outer limits for a third time!.",1257206400,,880,4.41358024691358
3197820,4,B000W8KY0G,"I was very happy to pick up this set of all 49 episodes for less than $32. In the bad old days of video you had to pay a lot more for a lot less and of course it took up a lot more room. This entire set is only a little thicker in it's box than the first movie of the Lord of the Rings Platinum Extended Version, ""The Fellowship Of the Ring"".

This is a no muss no fuss set of 6 (actually 7 I later learned - see below) double sided DVDs, each in their own slim plastic container. Picture quality is fine and it's a real treat to be finally able to see all 49 episodes of this very entertaining TV show anytime I want without watching edited shows on the Sci-Fi Channel which they've stopped showing in any event.

My DVD player has had no issues playing the DVDs. Some remastered video and maybe some commentaries and documetaries would have got a 5 star rating. No complaints really - I love this set.

I should add that the packaging on the 3rd Volume does not reflect the actual contents. Disc 1 is missing the last 2 titles which are in the last container. In that final container there are 2 DVDs rather than just Disc 2 as indicated on the outside so they should be Discs 2a and 2b. and they indicate a total of 9 episodes - in fact there are 11 episodes in that last container, 2 DVDs, 2 of which are listed on the packaging for Disc 1, Side B. So, in Vol. 3, Disc 1, Side A is correct while Side B is missing the last 2 titles indicated. Those 2 titles are on what should be called Disc 2a, Side A in the next container along with what should be the first 2 from that container. Then, that Disc 2a Side B has 2 more. Then Disc 2b, Side A has 4 episodes and the other side of that has the one final episode.

It's confusing as hell but all 49 episodes are there, just don't go by the packaging when you get to the last two containers for Volume 3.",1256515200,22,1855,3.9919137466307277
3197821,4,B000W8KY0G,"When I was a kid, I LOVED this show! I'm not old enough to have watched it first run, but I watched it whenever it came on. The episodes I remember most are ""Mutant"" (those 'fried egg eyes' haunted me for years!), ""The Glass Hand"", and of course, ""I, Robot"".

When I bought my DVD player 5 years ago, one of the first series I went looking for was The (original) Outer Limits, but it wasn't out yet. They had only started releasing the new ones, and I wasn't interested in those. Nice stories, but I really like the older ones better... the same way I really like The (original) Twilight Zone. In my book, the more you rely on special effects to tell your story, the less you rely on writing and acting.

The only thing that disappoints me about this set is the same thing that other people complain about; no extras, no interviews, no specials, nothing. I did have trouble getting my DVD player to recognize one of the episodes, but because of the way mine is set up, I was able to get it to work anyway by double-clicking the icon with the select button. It does seem to be a problem with the manufacturer. I haven't tried it in my son's PS2 yet. An annoying problem I find is that I can't tell ""side A"" from ""side B"". Maybe I'm missing something subtle in the teeny-tiny text, but for the life of me, I couldn't figure it out, and often got it wrong. I found it very frustrating. Also, after the first season, MGM insists on blasting you with their theme song and advertisements before getting you to their robotic version of the Outer Limits control voice every time you load the disk. Holy heck! Enough already!

All in all, I'm glad I bought it. I can see myself watching it 2-3 times a year, especially around Halloween when my Twilight Zone and Night Gallery DVD's emerge along with my Universal Studios classic movie monsters : - ).",1256169600,4,1841,4.3615160349854225

I never watched this series as a boomer--was into the ""fluff"" of that era. Watching this series now I realize I sure missed something special. What wonderful scripts & outstanding mix of guest stars. This show had such intelligent writing that to the average person in 1963 it might have been over their heads-that's not a put-down, but it's a statement saying this show was way ahead in it's open-minded aproach to new thinking for tv at that time.

3197827,3,B000W8KY0G,"With great anticipation, I awaited the arrival of my ""Outer Limits"" box set. Sometimes our memory makes us believe that things are better then they actually are, or were. There is nothing really wrong with this box set technically, I just remember the episodes being better than what they are. Maybe when you are over 40, your idea of what constitutes good entertainment changes. Even a classic episode like ""The Zanti Misfits"" seems a little slow and not as scary as I remember. I guess what I want to say, is that if you wish to recapture the magic you experienced as a kid growing up watching this series, that magic is probably gone, replaced with thoughts of how you would have shot, directed, and edited the episode and or series. I have yet to finish season 1, and I am in no hurry to finish watching the rest anytime soon.

As I said before, for a 40 year old plus series, there is nothing technically wrong with this series. The black & white image is sharp, with very little damage. Audio is good, sub-titles would have been nice. Maybe if you were watching this box set for the first time, you might find it interesting, but some of the stories seemed like they had run out of ideas, and were desperate for a story, episode ""ZZZZZ"" comes to mind.

My personal favorite is Harlan Ellison's ""Deamon With A Glass Hand"" with Robert Culp. The other, ""Soldier"" with Michael Ansara.

3197830,4,B000W8KY0G,"This is my second review in as many that has given a zero to the poor packaging and contents and higher marks to the show itself. Let's take a look at the show first and then we'll take a look at the rest.
This is one of the top Sci-Fi shows ever to appear on television. Created by Leslie Stevens and Joe Stefano the show made its' premiere in Sept. of 1963 and WHAT a premiere it was.""The Galaxy Being"" certainly scared the living begeesus out of me and I will never forget that. The whole look and feel was totally different and it definitely was not The Twilight Zone but a deep and darker version of it. Nothing that intense had been seen on  TV before and nothing would equal it's impact for many years. The show was directly helmed by the team of Stefano and Stevens with Dominic Frontieres' great scoring in the background through all of season one. When Season two arrived all three had departed and were replaced by others. The format underwent minor changes but it basically stayed true to its' roots. The entire story is detailed wonderfully in the ""Outer Limits Companion"" by David Schow and Jeff Frentzen.
Some prefer one season over the other but there is much to recommend both. Season one has its' ""Galaxy Being"",""The Zanti Misfits"",""Second Chance"" ,""Production and Decay of Strange Particles"" and ""A Feasibility Study"".Season Two ""The Inheritors-Parts 1&2"",""Keeper of the Purple Twilight"" and one of the entire series top eps ""The Demon with the Glass Hand"".The series is filled with many well known actors like Cliff Robertson,Ted Knight,Robert Culp,Ed Asner,Eddie Albert,Robert Duvall and so many more. There is also a huge Star Trek connection as William Shatner,Leonard Nimoy and James Doohan would all make appearances,along with many of the future shows supporting actors. The ep ""Production and Decay..."" contains at least five future Trek actors at once,including Leonard Nimoy!
The show never had a big budget and many of the shows today look dated as a result but in quite a few like ""Demon..."",the props are totally minimal and it is the great script,direction and acting that more than compensate for any shortcomings in the special effects department. That the show could do so much with so little at times,is a testament to the skill of everyone involved.
It is so unfortunate it only lasted two short seasons as the show should have gone many more. As one ep in the first season states:""Maybe young people are the only ones who listen and understand-you can't reach a closed mind"".And so it was,as the almighty ratings beast dictated to the head network honchos just how they ought to proceed with shows;promising or not. The biggest shows' fans were the younger gen of the time who did write in frequently praising the show but it was the adults in the end who controlled the decision making of what to watch and they weren't generally impressed with the show;at least not enough for ABC to continue with it. To top this,in the second season it was put up against the ever popular(among the entire family) Jackie Gleason Show;and Gleason wasn't going anywhere. The show may have been cancelled but it has continued in syndication ever since staying in the collective memories of those who first saw it and gaining new fans along the way.
Now let's look at the presentation. The one thing positive about this new set is the price. The original release about eight years ago broke the series into two release sets and both at the same price(at least $10 higher than this set per season!).Everything else goes down hill from here. MGM has decided in their ""wisdom"" to re-release this set again in the double sided disc format. BAD choice,period. As I stated in my other recent review Universal and MGM(among others) have a fondness for this type of release;it is cheap and yields the greastest profit. DVDs are notoriously scuff and scratch prone and that alone should preclude any such release of this type if these companies actually cared about the product and consumers.
The second thing about this ""new"" set is...that it isn't. I do not see any difference in the transfer of this product onto DVD from the original release sets.""A Feasibility Study"" was particlularly grainy in the first release and it remains so in this one and all other eps with any excesses in this area are also the same. So the question presents itself:""Why?"".Why would MGM not remaster these eps like they should be,after all this time?
I can certainly recommend the series itself as a groundbreaking one of its' day,as many of the eps still hold up very well,despite the budgetary restrictions. But it gets a zero as far as release presentation goes. It certainly is cheaper than the original release sets but it is just a simple re-packaging of the material on hand.

So, if you have a mega player and want to see all the content, buy two sets (a rip off), or play them in your single-disc player.

  The original series of The Outer Limits was cold-war-scare infused, cheaply produced with lots of men-in-monster-suits-all-decked-out-in-foam-rubber-and-plastic-scales-with-silly-backdrops, but it was so imaginatively done that I still, after all these years, find it compelling.  These days, we need multi-million dollar computerized digital effects just to keep us from yawning.

So now I have the whole set and it is a treasure to watch. In all it's wonderful black and white tight, artistic stories and camera work. Who cares if it was low tech, frankly that made it even scarier! For hard core fans you must get the Outer Limits Companion by David J. Schow. There you will find the behind the scenes info and pictures on all the episodes and how it was born by creative gurus Leslie Stevens and Joseph Stefano. For any creative type you will appreciate the determination by this team to get it on the air and fight for budget and script quality. Add this to your collection of classics. I have viewed most episodes and  the disc quality has improved over other OL collections of the past. You are about to participate in a great adventure!",1231632000,15,1056,4.28
3197845,4,B000W8KY0G,"I got this for my husband for Christmas this year and we are having a blast watching all these old episodes again. And even though they are 40 years old, they still manage to give me the heebie jeebies! My only complaint is that these disks are two-sided which I find pretty annoying. No matter which side I put in, inevitably, it's the wrong side for the episode I want.",1230681600,3,371,4.314285714285714
3197846,1,B000W8KY0G,I picked this set up at Best Buys on December 20.  The picture was crisp and the sound fine until Episode 3 on Disc number 1.  The picture started sticking and the audio disappeared all together.  I replaced this set with a new one at a different store.  All was good until episode 3 on disc 2 exhibited the same problem.  I do have a relatively new DVD player with progressive scan and still had this problem.  Having watched this series religiously as a child I was so excited when this box set was released and now so disappointed.  In this case 3rd time is not the charm and I now have a store credit.,1230336000,41,605,4.208695652173913
3197847,4,B000W8KY0G,"Bought this and watched all of the episodes - in order of course.  When I got to the last disc in volume three, I had the same episodes that were on another disc.  Duplicate discs!  I contacted MGM and they had me send them the discs with a photocopy of my receipt.  About a month later I got a new volume three in the mail.  These discs were perfect.  Loved the series when I was a kids and I found out I still love it.  Recommend being careful when you buy this, but it's well worth the money.",1229385600,,495,3.989795918367347
3197848,4,B000W8KY0G,"My only disappointment with this is that there are a couple of episodes that won't play. I've cleaned the disc, but to no avail. I loved the series as a kid, and I still love it. I'd be interested if others who've purchased this have the same problem.",1229385600,3,251,4.25
3197849,4,B000W8KY0G,"A single release of this 60's SciFi series was a welcome addition to my DVD video collection.

A recent visit to the local best buy clocked the series at nearly $100 for the three individual volumes.  BB had this new single set priced at a savings of 50%.

I was impressed with crisp clean EZ to use menus.  The B/W video and Mono audio quality was excellent.

I did miss bonus extras, and the lack of closed captions for those of us with  less than perfect hearing was also sorely missed.

Others have mention problems with the double sided discs.  My toshiba DVD player had NO such troubles.  Either disc quality has improved, or maybe these other people just need to upgrade their hardware.

While the ""monster"" FXs are very dated, the stories have held up well over the years.  All in all, enjoyable to watch.

4 stars.",1224979200,136,823,4.486486486486487
3197850,5,B000W8KY0G,"When my father first watched this, he would have been about eight or nine years old. Growing up myself, Outer Limits has been one of my classical favorites. What's even more amazing, is that after forty five years, this show is still considered great. Now my father is in his fifties and I'm in my twenties, and quite amazingly we still enjoy this show even after all this time. It's even more amazing that you can watch this movie nearly anywhere, from your laptop computer, to your dvd player at home. If anything, the very fact that you can watch this anywhere would have been science fiction at the time when Outer Limits first appeared. Outer Limits was very close to Twilight Zone, with the exception that it was an hour long (although Twilight Zone had a few hour long episodes), and most of the episodes were based on alien concepts, robots, or dimensional concepts. Like Twilight Zones, you see many famous actors/actresses appearing on the show. One comes to mind would be Leonard Nimoy in ""I, Robot"" which was a great episode.

I highly recommend this collection. You will enjoy it a lot. It is in the original black and white, and each episode is about fifty minutes long and you get forty nine episodes in total, the entire collection. There is one problem though, and that is the dvds are given in double sided dvds. Which is fine and all, but after so many usage, you get a lot of finger prints on one side or the other.",1224460800,152,1435,4.519230769230769
3197851,4,B000W8KY0G,Great collection to have. Some episodes you can watch more than once like Galaxy Being or Demon with Glass Hand. Others maybe just once though.,1221523200,,143,4.76
3197852,4,B000W8KY0G,"I read all the reviews before purchasing these disks and was a little apprehensive from all the bad reviews about the DVD quality. Well, I eventually decided to take a chance and am very glad that I did. I found the quality of the episodes to be EXCELLENT. These are all B/W video. I do not see why people complain about the lack of remastering, as there would be little improvement in the quality. I bought these to view the original episodes and this is exactly what is provided. And I really could care less about ""Special Features"".

I was able to view all episodes with no problem. The double sided DVDs are a real pain and have to be handled very carefully. I agree with others that say these should be on single sided DVDs, but it doesn't appear that this is going to happen as even the new ""Complete Box Set"" that is coming out later in the year have exactly the same 7 double sided disks. So, to combat this problem, I have made backups of all the disks and only view the backup set (I have found this to be completely unnecessary for single sided disks).  Even at a 55% compression ratio, the quality of these episodes are excellent on all three of my DVD players.

I would whole heartedly recommend these DVDs to anyone with the caveat that the double sided DVDs require extra care and probably will not survive children's handling.",1221091200,,1343,4.42914979757085

3197854,1,B000W8KY0G,"This is merely another repackaging of the same double-sided discs foisted on us twice before. Read their press release. In ""honor of the 45th anniversary"" they're releasing a single box of seven double-sided discs with NO new bonus materials for a list price of $59.99. Hell, I just bought all three boxes of the last ""new release"" from the dust bin at Best Buy for $12 each!",1218326400,58,375,4.611940298507463
3197855,4,B000W8KY0G,"A classic staple of American Sci-Fi. Two excellent examples of great episodes are back to back on Disc 1-side B; ""The Sixth Finger"" and ""The Man who was never born."" If you don't want to buy all 3 volumes. Volume one is a safe buy or go on itunes and pay $1.99 for each individual episode you want.

Take Care",1218153600,,309,4.15
3197856,4,B000W8KY0G,"I'm glad that all 48 episodes are still in their original black and white, retaining the film noir eeriness. Each episode deals with black and white philosophical and ethical issues, often resolving to shades of ambiguous gray. The Outer Limits is more sci-fi oriented than the better known Twilight Zone, though it would be interesting to discuss which show had the greater influence on future shows and movies. The Outer Limits led to Star Trek and to the movie Terminator, both of which exerted their own influences. There is even one episode with Eddie Albert, as a successful businessman, with his elegant wife in reluctant tow, wanting to give up the rat race and start a gentleman's farm. I wonder if this episode (Cry of Silence) was the inspiration for the comedy TV series Green Acres? Except there is nothing comedic about what goes wrong on this farm, and it is perhaps the most frightening episode of the series.

Most episodes feature some kind of ""monster,"" creature, or alien, but they are not always evil and often enough it is humans that are evil, out of fear, ignorance, or the desire for power. Some of the earlier episodes have an annoyingly moralistic and preachy tone, and a lot of what I call ""filler"" - boring repetition, unnecessary dialogue, and pointless action, perhaps because The Outer Limits was an hour long and not thirty minutes like Twilight Zone. Thankfully these flaws get worked out before too long. Then, towards the end of the series, the stories and scripts are not as good again. The best episodes are sandwiched between the first and last group of episodes.

The best episodes are good, but in honesty I have to say that less than half of them are good. The worst episodes are so bad as to be nearly comical. Nonetheless, fans of this series will not be disappointed if they purchase this set, as it is reasonably priced. In one particularly bad episode the employees at a research institute are subjected to a frightening experience (a menacing cloud) in order to induce a heart attack and then given a pacemaker. In this way their loyalty to the institute is guaranteed, as any disobedience results in the short-circuiting of the pacemaker. Stronger, braver people take longer to die from fright. Sounds pretty bad, doesn't it? :-) But there are diamonds among the coals.

I'm not a fan of sci-fi, but I like this series for the same reason I like the original Twilight Zone series, because they are good stories. These episodes are not about fantastic action sequences, special effects, or blood and gore, just good old-fashioned story-telling that leaves you something to think about.

Regarding the problems with the DVD discs that some reviewers have mentioned, I have been lucky not to have any of them. I hope that those problems get worked out, and I noticed that Amazon will be offering a new complete set of DVDs in November of 2008. Perhaps they will be more reliable.

Out of 48 episodes I think the following 16 are noteworthy:

The Man Who Was Never Born - A horribly mutated man from Earth's bleak future travels back in time in an attempt to alter the past and save mankind from its hideous fate.

Corpus Earthling - A doctor with a steel plate in his head questions his own sanity when he begins hearing the conversations of a strange race of alien rock creatures intent on conquering the world.

Nightmare - A band of Earth soldiers is captured and ruthlessly tortured, both physically and psychologically, by their alien captors.

Controlled Experiment - Two Martians conduct an investigation at the scene of a murder to try to determine why humans kill one another.

ZZZZZ - A queen bee with sinister intentions is transformed into a human to seek out the perfect mate.

The Bellero Shield - An ambitious scientist, with hopes of taking over his father's corporation, creates a laser that inadvertenly brings a gentle alien to Earth.

Second Chance - Believing that they're going on a mere carnival ride, a crew of discontented dreamers unknowingly boards a space ship bound to save the future of the human race.

Moonstone - Lunar colonists find themselves in grave danger when they attempt to aid five fugitive alien scientists.

The Mutant - After being exposed to a radioactive ionic shower, a scientist on a distant planet develops telepathic abilities and is driven to madness.

Fun And Games - The fate of the entire Earth is at stake when a man and woman are transported to a satellite, where they must fight the members of an alien race for the amusement of their captors.

A Feasibility Study - The people of Earth surprise their alien captors when an entire neighborhood is transported to another planet as part of a plan to enslave the human race.

Behold, Eck! - The fate of the Earth is at stake when an optometrist discovers special lenses enabling him to see a frightening and otherwise-invisible two-dimensional creature.

Cry Of Silence - Otherworldly forces are at play as a couple of motorists find themselves roadblocked and trapped by animated tumbleweeds.

The Invisible Enemy - An encounter with extreme terror awaits a crew sent to Mars to investigate the disappearance of an earlier expedition.

The Inheritors - After being shot in the head, four soldiers gain a genius I.Q. and begin working fervently towards a mysterious scientific goal.

The Premonition - An out-of-control test flight traps a pilot and his wife in a slow-moving time warp, and they're not alone.",1214352000,2,5460,4.82441113490364
