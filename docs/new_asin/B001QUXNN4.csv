3771191,5,B001QUXNN4,"A princess from outer space, named Valkyrie, crashed her ship into a bath house owned by Kazuto and his little sister. In order to make amends she gives a portion of her soul to Kazuto and swears to marry him. Unfortunately she is transformed into a child when she does this. There are bunches of other Valhallan princesses and pirates that have other plans for her.

This anime is a lighthearted story. It has a sweet and fun-filled mood about it. It is the kind of anime that makes you fell all warm and tingly inside. It's so much fun. The animation is good, the story is interesting and funny, and there are a lot of colorful characters to keep you laughing. This is a really good series and I can't see anyone not liking it. I think It's worth a look see.",1349568000,,760,4.314685314685315
3771192,4,B001QUXNN4,"This is a great and funny anime if your into the more chibi, childish harem types. In a sense similar to Love Hina this has plenty of girls along with plenty of laughs. You get season 1 and 2 plus a couple of OVA's so it's actually a pretty good deal for your price. Although it is a romance anime, don't expect it to be very deep. It's more of a comedy type thing but don't let that stop you. And with season 3 and 4 coming out, this will surely be an anime to add to anyone's collection.",1247443200,5,489,3.9494949494949494
3771193,4,B001QUXNN4,a gift I had given to my little brother. I wouldn't know but he likes them. I'll buy more. thanks,1389571200,,97,3.9
3771194,4,B001QUXNN4,"Partial Nudity.  Not really harem, but almost comes close.  So a princess of Valhalla escapes her duty to be married off for political motivations.  She crash lands on Earth and into the life of Kasito.  For compensation, she gives him 1/2 her soul and changes into a little girl.  That's where the adventure starts.

She changes back to and adult once she kisses Kasito in times of crisis. . .Together they battle other princesses, pirates, ghosts and bag guys.  Mainly its other princesses.

This box collection has 5 disc to include the Season 1, Season 2, and OVA Special that is sold separately. . .no need to buy it.",1379376000,,622,4.6422018348623855
3771195,5,B001QUXNN4,its came in good condition with no problem it is an excellent anime and it was amazing to watch and see,1379289600,,103,3.9523809523809526
3771196,4,B001QUXNN4,This is a good classic anime. The DVDs all played fine and arrived on time. The cover art is some of the best i have seen. But for anyone who buys this be warned the DVDs come in a stack-pack format. This means all the disc are stacked on top of each other. This can cause damage to your DVDs and its hard to get to the disc you want to watch. I was not happy about this. But out of respect to such a great classic anime I will deduct only one point.,1378166400,,450,3.797872340425532
3771197,3,B001QUXNN4,"Good story, it was just saturated with too much fan service. It took away from the story and was almost too distracting.",1369353600,,120,4.5
3771198,5,B001QUXNN4,"This is a confusing series at first. I thought they had the episodes in the wrong order or something, but they just sort of had a jump start. I love the theme music to this show, and both the japanese and the english voice acting is wonderful. The animation hits the spot. It is not upper crust, but it really sets the proper mood for the show, sort of like school rumble, which I also love. If you do not like silliness this anime is not for you. But if you like wacky comedy that delves into an occasional dramatic side, then this series is well balanced. One or two episodes do test the bounderies of mayhem, but it stayed true enough to the story to keep it going. Valkyrie is an alien princess from the planet Valhalla, who has run away from an arranged marriage, and in the process crashed her ship into the Tokino Bathhouse mortally wounding the young ""Manboy"" who inherited it, Kazuto Tokino. To keep him from dying, Valkyrie gives him half of her soul to keep forever, which reduces her to a child, however whenever the souls of Valkyrei and Kazuto are perfectly aligned she can reclaim her true form for a short time ( a transformation which provides mere fan service insues, and transformations of other characters abound as well supplying further fan service). While in her adult form Valkyrie has amazing powers and wields ""The Key of Time"". Naturaly, the two drag their friends and family into many insaine adventures, and comedy abouds. It is a really fun show to watch, but the music is absolutly beautiful, Decembr Princess, Meguriai, Agape, All in All, and Itoshii Kakera are my favorites. I also bought the soundtrack UFO Princess Valkyrie: Best Theme Songs. This set includes the first two seasons, with two bridal training episodes in between, on five discs, wich are so hard to get out of the container, that I put them in separate cd holders to keep from damaging them while getting them out. All in all a great purchase! Season 1 has 12 episodes. Then there are 2 bonus episodes. Season 2 also has 12 episodes, for a total of 26 episodes. seasons 3 and 4 are sold on a separate save dvd.  Enjoy!",1369008000,4,2119,4.532637075718016
3771199,2,B001QUXNN4,"I admit I liked the show, there were some funny moments and I'd recommend it to all anime fans.  However I would like to complain about its packaging.  The discs are all stacked on top of each other, so it is a real hastle every time you want to watch a specific disc.  If I am going pay $30 for a boxset, I would at least wish for the discs to be placed in a different slot.",1364342400,,375,3.844155844155844
3771200,5,B001QUXNN4,"Great show, the thing I liked most was they released this which allowed me to complete my collection. I got season 3 & 4 from Funimation but for some reason they don't have Season 1  & 2 and this new reprint made this  a perfect and affordable way to finally complete this show in my collection without breaking the bank and I also find the DVD Case to be way nicer then Funimation's casing for Season 3 & 4.",1361577600,,408,4.151898734177215
3771201,5,B001QUXNN4,I give you guys two glorious thumbs up the packag arrived on time and you guys rock. until next time.  Piece,1358726400,,108,4.142857142857143
3771202,5,B001QUXNN4,"There is intelligent life out there, and Earth is where they have come to live and visit.  Kazyo runs his families bathhouse (much to the displeasure of his parents) with his younger sister to bring comfort and enjoyment to the locals residents and visitors, at least until a starship crashes into the roof killing him.  But all is not lost (or this would have been a very short series), the pilot Princess Valkyrie of Valhalla (the youngest and most attractive princess of the planet who was running away from an arranged marriage) brings him back to life by offering half her soul, but at the cost of her going from bodacious to baby sized.  Then things get weird.  Throw in a militant, cat-eared maid, his sister, his childhood friend who has a severe crush on him, the other 6 princesses of Valhalla, the fact that his dog Spot was a former mercenary pilot of great fame, and not to mention that he is now Valkyrie's fiancee and people are after her (but that is okay, for when they kiss Valkyrie goes from pint sized to eye popping. Can Kazyo bring success to the bathhouse and eventually marry the girl of his dreams.

I have all these on original disks (including the OVA's)and I have to admit I was taken for a loop with this. This is a reprint of Seasons 1&2, so do not expect anything new. The Ecchii level is a little more than most romantic comedies and the situations can go a little over the top, but overall the story was a fun filled romp as two people from different worlds (literally) try to find happiness and hopefully not lose their minds while doing it.",1357603200,2,1575,4.473867595818815
