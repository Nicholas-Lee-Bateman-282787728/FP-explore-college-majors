2958820,4,B000VZADPG,"This is a series about a father and his two children having to move in with his Aunt and Uncle because his wife, who's addicted to crack, accidently burned down their home.  Overall the series is pretty entertaining, however there are a lot of scenes that add nothing at all to the plot or current story. It's as if they just threw them in as fillers in order to fill a 30 minute time block.  The only other negative I have on the series is that some of the actors aren't that good and their lines don't come off naturally.  Especially the little girl.  Not trying to pick on her but it's true.",1207008000,2,594,4.230088495575221
2958821,4,B000VZADPG,"I saw the initial screening before this series was put into effect.  The story line and relationships were different then and I wasn't too keen on it.  However, some changes were made so when the program came into the main stream, it flowed really nicely.  I found it funny and light comedy would be my best way of describing it.  They were believeable characters and the connection between them all was very good.  Some of the episodes were a little off but not enough to have me turn off the tv.  Near the end the episodes tend to get a bit empty and too dramatic and the comdey seems to go away.  I look forward to the next season to see how it turns out.  Not just the story line but to see if the humour picks back up or not.",1204502400,,730,4.127659574468085

2958889,5,B000VZADPG,"Is it Tyler Perry's fault that America think this is funny? No way. Is it Tyler Perry's fault that lower-income people don't have discriminating senses of humor? Nyet. Is it Tyler Perry's fault that watching these programs will lower your IQ while it entertains you? Not on your life, buster.

Tyler Perry is giving the audience WHAT THEY WANT. You and your educated ways and your East Coast academic mindset aren't in vogue anymore. So take that college degree, set it on fire and sit down and prepare yourself to be taken to a different place. A place where fat people get very close to making you laugh and everyone has nice clothes and haircuts and you will you reflect on things for a while. It can also inspire you to think that you could be a writer on a Tyler Perry sitcom because they don't have high barriers to entry when it comes to needing to have actual writing skills. And that's why Tyler Perry is a man of the people, he's not being elitist and superior, he's being lowbrow and common THAT'S THE POINT PEOPLE!

So tired of the traditional media judging us.

Tyler Perry is America's version of Belgian TV producer Melange. Melange was famous for giving people what they wanted and cashing big check because of it. If you don't like that, maybe you should do something yourself. Tyler really does make it look easy.",1303776000,3,1331,4.560669456066946

funnier than ever. *Uncle Curtis* will keep you in stitches.
When your watching this show you have to laugh, from beginning
to end. As you stay dedicated to the show, you will find out

us with a message that we can relate to, while making us laugh at the same time.

2958907,1,B000VZADPG,"Wow!  I mistakenly bought this dvd believing that because I've enjoyed some of Tyler's movies this would be a great series.  Boy was I wrong.  The jokes aren't funny or believable.  The acting is horrible, the token white character isn't funny.  The little girl seems rude and not a cute spunky Rudy Huxtable or Raven.  Even the laugh track is annoyingly unbelievable.  If you can, rent this from the library for free just don't waste your money.  The writing seems sloppy and lazy.

It can also inspire you to think that you could be a writer on a Tyler Perry sitcom because they don't have high barriers to entry when it comes to needing to have actual writing skills. And that's why Tyler Perry is a man of the people, he's not being elitist and superior, he's being lowbrow and common THAT'S THE POINT PEOPLE!

So tired of the traditional media judging us.

Tyler Perry is America's version of Belgian TV producer Melange. Melange was famous for giving people what they wanted and cashing big check because of it. If you don't like that, maybe you should do something yourself. Tyler really does make it look easy.",1303776000,3,1331,4.560669456066946

3193398,5,B000VZADPG,"Tyler Perry is the man. ""THE HOUSE OF PAYNE"" is
funnier than ever. *Uncle Curtis* will keep you in stitches.
When your watching this show you have to laugh, from beginning
to end. As you stay dedicated to the show, you will find out
that each episode comes with a meaning. ""Tyler Perry"" always leave
us with a message that we can relate to, while making us laugh at the same time.

3193404,1,B000VZADPG,"Wow!  I mistakenly bought this dvd believing that because I've enjoyed some of Tyler's movies this would be a great series.  Boy was I wrong.  The jokes aren't funny or believable.  The acting is horrible, the token white character isn't funny.  The little girl seems rude and not a cute spunky Rudy Huxtable or Raven.  Even the laugh track is annoyingly unbelievable.  If you can, rent this from the library for free just don't waste your money.  The writing seems sloppy and lazy.  Come on Tyler, don't take your audience for granted.  This is terrible and even you must know it.",1224979200,8,581,4.663366336633663
