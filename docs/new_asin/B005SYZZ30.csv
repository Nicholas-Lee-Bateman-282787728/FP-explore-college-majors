4887906,4,B005SYZZ30,"I remembered seeing this movie at a drive-in eons ago. It's a great story and it would be wonderful to see it remade. That said, I loved Stacy Keach in this movie! He was the most charming executioner of all time. He had a way of comforting and consoling those he was about to execute to the point that they were looking forward to the trip to Elysium, so they could die for their crimes with a smile on their face. But when he has to execute a woman with whom he has fallen for, he becomes a criminal himself and has to face his own electric chair with an undertrained assistant to carry out the sentence. The ending would make Rod Serling cheer.
The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it is a little too obscene with lots of unsavory prostitutes and illicit sex scenes. But that is what sold movies back in the 70s (or no in this case?). If you like Stacy Keach you will really enjoy this movie.",1422144000,3,907,4.159090909090909

4887910,4,B005SYZZ30,Saw this movie a long time ago and though it isn't actually Oscar material it is one of those movies that seem to stick in your memory for a long time. Most of my friends had never heard of it so I was thrilled to show them that I was imagining it. Keach does a great job at bringing the main character to life without being overly zany.,1400025600,3,337,3.9705882352941178
4887911,2,B005SYZZ30,"The last time I saw this movie was during it's first release, and I recalled it as a dark comedy.  I remembered it as interesting enough, after 40 years, to see it again, with the advantage of nigh unto a half century of seasoning.  I used to judge a movie by how long it would hold my interest before I desired a cigarette.

While it's been 15 years since I've had a cigarette, a new review of this self-indulgent indy made me want to step out for a smoke before it was 1/3 over.  It wasn't worth the small fee I paid.",1399334400,,519,4.0588235294117645

4887913,5,B005SYZZ30,"This is a hilarious dark humored comedy.  Stacy Keach is at his best, as Jonus Candide, a traveling executioner.  He has the job of ""Frying"" his first woman.  He ends up falling for her, and a crime spree begins.  This film is fun and full of cheesy lines, and silliness all done on purpose. A must have.",1336262400,4,304,4.280701754385965
4887914,3,B005SYZZ30,"[The Traveling Executioner - 1970 - Widescreen - Directed by Jack Smight] Surprisingly, there's nothing remarkable about this film - for a black comedy, it's not really funny, no one gives a memorable performance (in spite of the details claiming Bud Cort excels in his five minute role), the direction is pedestrian to the point of looking like an ABC Movie of the Week, the plot falters and wanders all over, and Stacy Keach (who never looked worse) is miscast in his role as the lead. I know this sounds harsh, but it's true nonetheless.

There is one great segment of dialogue as the film begins regarding ""The fields of Ambrosia"" the condemned are headed for, extremely well-delivered by Keach, indicating that we're in for a good little oddball film, but it soon becomes apparent that we're just killin' time as Keach fries felons for profit - not very profitable for us viewers though. And this inspired monologue is used three times during the film, so it loses its impact by the third time it's heard. The plot suffers from too many subplots involving a good-looking female in isolation awaiting her turn in the chair that both Keach and a slimy guard want a piece of before she's toasted, sneaking hookers into the prison at night so the inmates can have a go while the prison doctor stuffs his pocket and later provides penicillin to the penal ward, shifty card games and saloon clichs from every kind of Western you've seen, silly chase scenes that rub shoulders with 'Benny Hill' and a weak return to the original story that reeks of ""too little, too late"".

Obviously, I expected more from this minor mess that evidently and understandably couldn't find an audience even when it was first released, but the Warner Archive edition is a great print with good audio, like most of their releases. But, at the prices asked for these bare-bones DVD-R's, it's criminal enough to warrant a trip to the hot seat. Barely 3 stars, IMO.",1326499200,7,1938,4.730769230769231

8485692,4,B005SYZZ30,"For starters this has to rank with ""Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter"" as one of the strangest films ever made by a major studio, in this case MGM.  I have nothing against offbeat offerings but just because a film has a skewed sensibility doesn't necessarily make it good as is the case with the fore mentioned vampire movie .  Regardless, I was intrigued by this film's goofball premise.  In order for it to work, though, you need compelling performances by the main actors and the makers of the film get a spirited turn by Stacy Keach in the title role.  Keach makes believable his account of the state executioner who offers the condemned tender loving care before he dispatches them to the ethereal fields of ambrosia.  A lot of the dark humor is hit-or-miss but the script hits enough bulls eyes for me to recommend.  The film's relative obscurity demonstrates why they don't make many like it or why Metro isn't a big league player anymore.",1436054400,2,944,4.6909090909090905
