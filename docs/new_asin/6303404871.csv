However they did do a good job of consolidating characters and sticking to the main points of the story. Even if you have read the book you will enjoy watching the movie.

One of the plusses of this movie is the character that plays Edward Symmington (Michael Culver.) He is in several other English films and plays Prior Robert in the Brother Cadfael Series.

One of the minuses of this movie is the Lisa Doolittle scene; it is totally out of character for aunt Jane films.

You have the characteristic mystery and the usual (or unusual) suspects. Aunt Jane is confronted with a problem that may snowball into murder if she does not figure it out in time. But as everyone says, ""Ask Miss Marple."" She usually has the right answer.""",1501804800,,847,4.596026490066225

I watched this movie without reading the 1942 Dame Agatha Christie novel that it was based on.  (Christie wrote twelve Miss Marple murder mysteries altogether.)  I'm glad I did this!  Why?  Because it forced me to really watch the movie in order to try and deduce who the murderer was.

A series of poison-pen letters (lurid, wicked, untrue letters) is being circulated in an English village.  A resident of this village and a friend of Miss Marple calls Miss Marple (the late Joan Hickson) to her home to try and learn the identity of the author of these letters.  Miss Marple gets more than she bargains for since a person is found killed with a suicide note being left.  Also, a poison-pen letter is found.  Eventually another body is discovered.  To rule out murder in both cases, Police Superintendent Nash (Geoffrey Davion) is officially called in to investigate.  Unofficially Miss Marple investigates.

Who are the people affected by these letters?  They are as follows:

1. Gerry Burton, a renter  (Andy Bickhell)
2. Joanna Burton, Gerry's sister (Sabina Franklin)
3. Maud Calthrop, a friend of Miss Marple (Dilys Hamlett)
4. Emily Barton, the owner of the estate Gerry and Joanna are renting (Hilary Mason)
5. Partridge, the cook/housekeeper of this estate (Penelope Lee)
6. Beatrice, the estate's maid (Juliet Waley)
7. Mr. Cleat, the estate's gardener (Gordon Rollings)
8. Edward Symmington, the estate owner's lawyer (Michael Culver)
9. Angela Symmington, Edward's wife (Liz Counsell)
10. Ellise Holland, the Symmington's nurse/maid (Imogen Smith)
11. Dr. Owen Griffith (Martin Fisk)
12. Eryl Griffith, Owen's sister (Sandra Payne)
13. Megan Hunter, Edward Symmington's stepdaughter (Debbie Appleby)

Joan Hickson (whom Agatha Christie herself wanted to play Miss Marple) captures the essence of the heroine super sleuth in her performance.  (Hickson was 79 years old in this movie!)

This murder mystery is especially good because it's not obvious who the murderer is.

Finally, the cinematography of this movie is good.  All costumes are authentic looking.  The background music adds to each scene.

In conclusion, this is a fun movie even if you have read the novel it's based on!

7845582,5,6303404871,"Bravo to the makers of this film, who faithfully adapted Agatha Christie's story to the screen, keeping the plot and characters true to the novel.  Joan Hickson is the quintessential Miss Marple and finds herself with an excellent supporting cast that enhances this classic whodunit.  A generous helping of romance and two deadly murders make this a most entertaining way to spend two hours. Mystery lovers will be challenged with the unexpected twists and red herrings that made the book so popular.  Was it the overzealous sister?  the genteel antiques collector?  the timid spinster?  the glamorous governess? the unhappy stepdaughter who evolves into Cinderella?  All is revealed on location in a picturesque English village.  Sit back and enjoy!",984700800,10,750,5.296610169491525
7845583,5,6303404871,"Joan Hickson has come to define Miss Marple. Her performances are flawless, entertaining, and blessed with a beautifully subtle humor. The Moving Finger is no exception to this rule. In this installment of the Miss  Marple series, Joan Hickson receives the added assistance of an excellent  supporting cast. Even those with minor roles do full justice to their  parts. This particular Christie mystery offers something for everyone:  classical whodunit twists and turns, the transformation of an 'ugly  duckling' into a swan, and a touch of heartwarming romance. The interaction  between Miss Marple and Inspector Nash is reminiscent of Sherlock Holmes  and Scotland Yard's Lestrade, adding yet another dose of deliciously sly  British humor to the mix. Fans of the book will be pleased to note that the  film remains quite true to the plot and dialogue with only minor  exceptions. The Moving Finger is really a must for any mystery film  library.",950140800,14,948,5.171052631578948
