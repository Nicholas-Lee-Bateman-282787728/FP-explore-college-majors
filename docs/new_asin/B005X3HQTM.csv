4900034,5,B005X3HQTM,Excellent dvd!  I am in my 30s but I am a big Roy Rogers fan because I grew up hearing stories about Roy from my grandparents because my Grandma used to live down the street from him.  My Grandma and Roy were baptised together in 1948.,1429920000,8,235,4.086956521739131
4900035,5,B005X3HQTM,"THE BACKSTORY OF DALE EVANS REVEALS A SIDE OF HER LIFE WE NEVER KNEW DURING THE YEARS SHE AND ROY WERE IN THE SPOTLIGHT. DALE AND ROY WERE TRUELY THE ""GOOD GUYS"" THEY PLAYED WITHOUT SEEKING ANY PUBLIC RECOGNITION FOR THEIR KIND AND LOVING LIFESTYLE. THE SOCIAL MEDIA HOGS OF TODAY SHOULD TAKE NOTE TO LEARN GENEROSITY AND  HUMILITY FROM THE ROGERS.",1384473600,11,348,4.612903225806452
4900036,5,B005X3HQTM,I really enjoyed viewing this production as I have always enjoyed watching these favorite motion picture and television heroes in the past.,1380499200,9,139,5.363636363636363
4900037,5,B005X3HQTM,I had the pleasure of meeting Dale's husband (Roy Rogers) when I was very young in the 1950's. They were both class acts and a tribute to Christianity. Wish we had more like them.,1356220800,11,179,4.294117647058823

8488219,5,B005X3HQTM,Has so many of their good movies!,1523664000,,33,3.857142857142857
8488220,5,B005X3HQTM,"Good quality product. Features and unusual emphasis on Dale Evans which is well  deserved and very interesting. The tribute to Roy Rogers contains good quality prints of several of his and Dale's movies with ""The Lights of Old Santa Fe "" as the highlight. This may be their very best movie together.  There are also several episodes of the ""Roy Rogers Show"" from television that are good prints and highly enjoyable as well. While the DVD does not break new ground concerning this wonderful couple it is an excellent compendium of their talent, music, and personalities. I highly recommend this to all fans of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.",1516924800,,636,4.825688073394495

COULD  HAVE  TAKEN  SOME  OF  HER  GREAT  SINGING  IN  MOVIES  WITH  ROY.  SO  WAS  DISAPPOINTED  IT  WAS  STILL  TOO  MUCH  ROY  ROGERS.",1497916800,,299,4.270833333333333

8488225,5,B005X3HQTM,"A great documentary on the life of Dale Evans. I grew up a Roy Rogers fan but never knew much about Dale except she was married to Roy. This film brought back a lot of memories to me, thank you. A (2) DVD set which has (2) movies of Dale and Roy together on (1) DVD and Dales story on the other DVD. If you enjoy western heroes you well enjoy this movie.",1448323200,4,354,3.863013698630137
