8587758,2,B00CZ2P91G,"The story of THE WATCHTOWER is a compelling one: Nihat (Olgun Simsek) takes over as a guard in a lonely watch-tower in Central Anatolia, living entirely alone except for occasional communication via radio with his fellow-guards. He has lost his wife and child in an accident and shuns company as a result. Seher (Nilay Erdonmez) has taken a job as a ""hostess"" with a small bus company; it soon becomes clear that she has abandoned her life as a student. She has been raped by her uncle, and is now pregnant, even though she dare not tell anyone. Eventually she has the baby in a lonely room and abandons it in the bus station forecourt. Nihat and Seher are brought together as Nihat rescues the baby and takes Seher in; however, the two of them find it difficult, almost impossible to get along. As two of life's misfits, they prefer solitude, with the power of self-determination. In structural terms, however, THE WATCHTOWER is a bit of a mish-mash; it begins with the kind of long, lingering shots of a landscape with one character moving within the frame characteristic of Nuri Bilge Ceylan's films; it subsequently includes the kind of interior shots with washed-out colors reminiscent of Zeki Demirkubuz; and ends with a melodramatic plot straight out of Atif Yilmaz's SELVI BOYLUM AL YAZMALIM (1978), the classic love-story starring Turkan Soray. The ending is a total cop-out, as it shows Nihat looking out into the desolate landscape, while not telling us anything about Seher. While being an admirer of Esmer's previous work, I have to say that THE WATCHTOWER is is perhaps her least satisfying effort.",1374192000,,1612,4.865454545454545
