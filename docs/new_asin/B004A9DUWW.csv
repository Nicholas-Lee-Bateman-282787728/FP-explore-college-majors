8419839,5,B004A9DUWW,"Quickly shipped and received before the expected delivery date!!  Extremely satisfied!!  It teaches phonics, writing,  and math!! My daughter watched this over and over. Sometimes in a row. Lol. She flourished after watching this dvd!!  Awesome learning tool!! Highly recommended!!",1519430400,,281,5.95
8419840,4,B004A9DUWW,We used this on vhs with my 3 older kids (bought around 2000).  They are excellent readers and they still remember some of the things like Z is for zipper with fondness.  I like that the letters getting taught don't get lost in a story.  My little ones are now using them but we had to reorder because our vhs tape was damaged.,1475020800,,327,4.158730158730159
8419841,1,B004A9DUWW,Wasn't what I was looking for. I typed in CD Rom and got a DVD instead. Not what I needed.,1437955200,,90,3.55
8419842,4,B004A9DUWW,"My granddaughter is learning quickly with this program at 4 years old, she's already writting out words, making sentences :)",1418169600,,124,5.25
8419843,5,B004A9DUWW,"Ankther reviewer mentioned that it looks very old and therefore is terrible.  I admit, they are right in that it looks like it could have been on a VHS in 1988 (hey, maybe it was).  I was skeptical, but tried it out.  My 3.5 year old is absolutely in love with this video.  Everything else he watches is HD quality, satellite tv...your typical Disney Jr stuff.  But this somewhat old-fashioned movie is a hit in our home.  And, most importantly, I think it does an excellent job of teaching uppercase and lowercase letters and sounds, how to write the letters, and some basic math...and I can be picky; I taught kindergarten and 1st grade in the past.",1409356800,3,651,4.521367521367521
8419844,5,B004A9DUWW,This is a very simple DVD it is clear on the information that is presented to the child and they can easily follow along my children like how much it reminds them of a video game.,1393804800,,179,4.0
8419845,5,B004A9DUWW,"My little two year old absolutely loves this video, the arithmetic is still a little above him but he enjoys watching that one too.",1388880000,,131,4.5
8419846,1,B004A9DUWW,"I purchased this DVD to go along with our Horizons Preschool homeschool set. This literally looks and sounds like it was made in the early 80's on VHS tape. Couldn't hold my 4 year olds attention even through the first letter A because it goes so slow to introduce each letter, sound, formation. I wouldn't recommend this learning DVD to anyone. Can I give less than 1 star? :/",1385337600,,377,4.478260869565218
8419847,4,B004A9DUWW,I use this as a supplement for my son's preschool homeschool curriculum. It's got cute little characters and songs and I think it's good for reinforcing letters and numbers. I think the arithmetic section is kind of advanced in that it's doing a little addition problems. My son is still learning his number! But I guess it's a good foundation for the future.,1362441600,,359,4.714285714285714
