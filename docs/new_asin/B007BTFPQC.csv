8514089,4,B007BTFPQC,"This is an interesting account of the Japanese American experience during WWII. Without politicizing the issue, the straight forward recollections of the times from people who experienced America's concentration camps are very telling. A serious injustice was made that clearly must not be repeated. I have seen more detailed and higher level historical accounts of this event which have aired on network television but this documentary focuses on the personal recollections of people who where there. This was of real interest to me as my Japanese American parents did not speak of of their ordeal except to answer specific questions when asked. This documentary did describe the life that the inmates lived. Apologists say that it wasn't really harsh like prison. Euphemisms such as ""Relocation Centers"" and ""Camps"" have often been used but never the less 111.000 people were incarcerated against their will.",1527984000,,910,5.370629370629371

Being capable of admitting, accepting and looking at our history, face to face, will help us to avoid doing the same mistakes all over again (hopefully...), and that is true to what ever country you live in...",1338508800,,329,4.857142857142857
