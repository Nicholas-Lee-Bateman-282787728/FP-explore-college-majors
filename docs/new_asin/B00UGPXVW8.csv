8706374,5,B00UGPXVW8,"I've read this series through 2 generations and love it. So I was worried to try the DVD version. But Phase 4 Films did a FANTASTIC JOB?
The best of the book is included and the art is wonderful. Every scene is beautiful painting in itself. The portrayal of the kids is perfect in my opinion.  I would love to see these artists do the sequels.",1458259200,,343,4.196969696969697
