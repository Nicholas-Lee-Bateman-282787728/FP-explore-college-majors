3618540,5,B001GP5TK4,"Denise has re-invented traditional pilates moves in two 10-minute workouts.

The first one is a killer upper-body workout using light weights. These exercises simultaneously engage your abs and legs while you're lifting weights. Each area of the upper body is targeted with a single set of multiple reps that get progressively more difficult.

The second workout incorporates classic Pilates core exercises, but each one has been tweaked by Denise to offer an even greater challenge.

There is also a 20-min. dance workout, which I have not yet done (I honestly bought this just for the Pilates). Between the three workouts on this dvd, one can get a well-rounded workout (cardio, strength, and stretch).

For me, this workout is indispensable because of the strength training aspect. I usually find weight workouts to be a huge bore that I dread doing. But this one is so fun and challenging, requiring my complete mental focus, that the time flies and I am already looking forward to doing it again by the time I am done.",1235606400,4,1023,4.930232558139535
3618541,2,B001GP5TK4,"I have tried this video 3 times now. Normally I like something that i can pop in, it will give me a decent cardio workout and at the end I feel as if I've accomplished something.  If you feel the same, then this is not the video for you.  There is no intructional portion to familiarize yourself with the moves before hand, you have to figure it out as you go.  By the time I watch to see what foot they're starting on, the full body movement, and get the hang of that move, she's onto the next step, where again, I have to figure out what she's doing.  I spend more time watching the video than actually moving.  Definately not something you can just jump into and have fun.  If all her videos are put together this way, I will definately not be buying another one ever.",1233792000,,771,4.175675675675675
3618542,4,B001GP5TK4,"There are 3 segments:  30 minutes of easy-to-follow dance combinations with plenty of waist and hip action.  There is no warm-up, but it didn't seem necessary.  There's a nice stretch at the end.

10 min of standing Pilates with light weights.  If you have Denise's Power Yoga workout, you'll recognize some of the work from the 2nd segment of that DVD.

10 min of floor Pilates.  Classic floor Pilates.  You start with the usual ab work, including the 100, but Denise gives you variations to keep it interesting.  Also a few things from the side-kick series, along with the ever fun Can-Can.

A pleasant, effective workout with Denise's patented ""girlfriend"" factor, and better cueing than usual.  (Yes, the music could've been better.)",1231286400,18,737,4.959016393442623
3618543,4,B001GP5TK4,"This DVD suprised me. It's actually quite good and of intermediate challenge.
The 30 minute cardio/dance section was really fun to do. The first part had more of a latin flair and the second part was more hip-hop oriented. It was also easy to modify the moves to make them higher impact for a more intense workout.
The 10 minute standing Pilates segment worked the upper body and core with weights. The time just flew by.
There is also a 10 minute floor Pilates routine targeting the abs and legs. Strap on wrist and ankle weights and it becomes nicely challenging. Denise is also very pleasant throughout, just the right amount of friendliness. My only gripe is the music. Had they used better and more motivating music in the dance portion, this would have been a 5-star workout.",1229990400,37,781,4.666666666666667
3618554,4,B001GP5TK4,Pretty good work out.  I usually walk and use the videos when the weather doesn't cooperate.  I bought this so I could change the routine.  The dance part is fun and easy to do.  The Pilates part is a good toning workout.  I also use some of her other videos.,1447977600,,259,4.1
3618555,5,B001GP5TK4,This DVD is a great workout and the instructions are easy to follow throughout the workout.,1446336000,,91,4.75

3618557,4,B001GP5TK4,"I like a lot of Denise's workouts, I've tried several from the library and own 2 or 3.  I don't seem to have a problem with cueing and anyway, if you buy a DVD presumably you're going to do it many times, so a couple times in and you'll know what's coming.  The dance portion, I would say intermediate is a stretch because I'm 53 and out of shape and I had no trouble with it, but for sure it gets you up and moving.  Good for days when you just can't give it your all but feel you need to do something. What I really liked was the standing Pilates, which is typically my thing anyway, a good solid 10 minutes of mostly arms but a little more.  She stretches you well, too. That went by quickly and is something I'd like to incorporate into my every day, although I can't do a push up to save my life and I just plank when she cues that, instead.  I find Denise encouraging - I mean, all these instructors have a little cheerleader in them, but I don't find her annoying.  I'd say add this to your repertoire, throw it in the mix every 2-3 weeks but do the arms more often than that.  For comparison, I also really like Jessica Smith and Tracy Mallet.",1438732800,,1151,4.088888888888889
3618558,5,B001GP5TK4,Great video. I am still learning the dance routines but it is fun and gets you moving!,1435536000,,86,4.117647058823529

3618560,5,B001GP5TK4,Great DVD and I love the standing pilates as I don't enjoy mat pilates. Denise is a fabulous 57 year-old and is a wonderful example of the rewards that lifelong fitness confers.,1420848000,,177,4.5625

3618577,4,B001GP5TK4,"Denise Austin always delivers a certain quality, which is why I like her DVDs.  Like all of her others, this isn't overly difficult, but gives you a decent workout.  You don't ever have to worry about hurting anything and the instructions are clear.  She's peppier than I'd like, but you can't help but find her genuine and endearing at the same time.",1341964800,,351,4.629032258064516
3618578,5,B001GP5TK4,"I really like this workout.  The first couple of times, I was struggling to get the steps in the cardio portion and my heart-rate only got up to about 110.  Now that I have the steps down, after the third time, my heart-rate was up at 150-160!  It is great, fun cardio and no pounding! The pilates are great two.  If I do the whole tape, the sweat is pouring off and I feel great!  A plan on doing this three times a week and Denise's Shrink Your Female Fat Zones three times a week.  I expect the pounds to be falling off by the end of summer!",1341792000,,544,3.990740740740741

3618582,5,B001GP5TK4,"I have many workout DVDs because I like to change things up and I got this one because I wanted something fun and energetic.  I was NOT disappointed. It has become one of my very favorite DVDs.

There are three sections - dance, standing pilates and mat pilates.  All three sections are great! The dance portion will get your heart rate up and make you sweat but is not difficult to follow.  I have read other review of Denise's DVDs stating that she doesn't cue well but I do not find this to be the case at all.  The pilates portion strengthens and lengthens but also relaxes.  If you like dance and/or pilates - BUY THIS DVD - you will not be disappointed.",1327449600,2,659,4.317073170731708
3618583,1,B001GP5TK4,I was disappointed in this dvd. I like Denise Austin but I really didn't care for this one. The pilates was ok but the dancing was not my thing.,1320019200,,144,4.0
3618584,3,B001GP5TK4,"This video is good for people who like to dance to get in their cardio. It is not very hard, and I ended up not sweating very much so it is probably good for beginners.",1292284800,,168,3.8285714285714287
3618585,5,B001GP5TK4,THE DANCE MOVES IN THIS DVD ARE NOT HARD TO FOLLOW. I LIKE THIS WORKOUT. ITS FUN TO DO BOOTCAMP 1 WEEK AND THEN DANCE ANOTHER WEEK. THE PILATES SEGMENT IS ALSO REALLY GOOD. BOTH WORKOUTS ARE ABOUT 20 MINUTES LONG WHICH I LOVE! YOU GET A GOOD WORKOUT AND IT DOESN'T TAKE FOREVER!,1271116800,2,278,4.166666666666667
3618586,3,B001GP5TK4,I really like Denise Austin but I'm afraid this dance workout is just paced way too slow and doesnt' really get your heart pumping. I've tried going a little faster than her to get my heart rate up but.. And its something about the footwork in the last dance that is just off. I do a lot of Zumba and Core Rythms and they really get your heart rate up and this just doesn't. But if you're a beginner and not really looking for a high impact workout this may be for you. Just a little too slow for me.,1269129600,,500,4.01
3618587,2,B001GP5TK4,"I've done a couple of other videos before and after having to sit out a while due to various things, I picked this up because it looked like something I could do, have fun with, and get some exercise.  Not so much.  As some of the other reviewers stated, the steps are called out right before she switches to them and they are not demonstrated.  If you have a background in dance (like maybe you were drill team or a cheerleader) then you will probably breeze through this, catching on quickly and really enjoy it.  For the coordination challenged, look elsewhere.  I may try the Biggest Loser video I've got, or I may go back to Kathy Ireland - I can actually follow those.  And I KNOW you want something that's challenging - if it's too easy it's not a real workout, right? But I need something I can actually DO, rather than marching in place trying to figure out what the heck is going on.....

(Next day: not good for bad knees either!)",1266105600,2,941,4.373563218390805
3618588,5,B001GP5TK4,I am hesitant to buy Denise Austin DVD's because of how people review she doesn't cue right.  This is my 5th purchase of her workouts and it's great.  I think the dance part is cued wonderfully.  She just repeats the steps over and over to make it easy to learn.  I'm new to Pilates but the workout definitely made me sore.  I consider myself an intermediate exerciser for aerobics and this is a great workout for my fitness level.,1262822400,3,431,4.405063291139241
3618589,5,B001GP5TK4,"I have actually been really disappointed in all the dance videos except for Denise Austin's.  Hers are dancing yet they stay on the path of workout type exercising if that makes sense.  Although the dancing with the stars dancers are trained dancers they are not certified fitness instructors and you can tell in that series of videos as well.  Certified instructors are going to do moves that have scientific research as being affective as well as moves that shouldn't cause the kinds of injuries you can have by just doing what these people are doing on your tv/dvd player.  I also realized after renting a few of these dance videos we all have types of exercising we like and will be successful at.  My best friend and I are so different in our desires, she likes the boot camp type exercising and I am a relaxed at my pace treadmill walker. So after looking at my exercise DVD's the ones that I am most happy with is TamiLee Webb and Denise Austin.  Find what you like for you and don't base it totally on a bad or good review.
To finish getting my baby weight off in 2010 I think I will make it the year of Denise Austin.",1261180800,,1126,4.363636363636363
3618590,5,B001GP5TK4,"I love this workout.

It was fun, enjoyable and got my heart working...and I didn't even get to the pilates part yet.

Lots of dancy moves done in a fun, fun, fun way.  I started feeling good within two minutes and felt very very good the whole way thru.

I thought the steps were perfect.  Not too complicated and not too easy.  Just enough to provide a bit of challenge and interest but not too easy where it is boring.  I have a very small workout space...if I can do it with my space, almost anyone can do it.  I have to maneuver a bit but it is still very doable.

For the record I don't have a problem with Denise's cuing or her personality.  Somehow I just get it without much of a problem. And I, personally, like positive personalities but that is just a preference.

Also, I have taken serious dance in the past (ballet, modern, and jazz) and still liked this video. I didn't think it was ""cheesy"" at all.  Before starting up cardio again, my exercise was mostly walking my dogs and yoga (both strenuous and just stretching).

I am really looking forward to doing the pilates segment and trying Denise's other dance videos.  I'll add on to this review once I do the pilates.

Denise, thank you for providing easy ways to incorporate exercise into our lives and in a fun, positive way, too.",1257552000,3,1299,4.376569037656904
3618591,1,B001GP5TK4,"Perhaps this workout would be OK if you have ESP -- Austin only gives you a cue that you're changing steps about a second or two beforehand.  I didn't feel like she gives the viewer enough time to do the routines either.  You just rush from one thing to another.  Also she doesn't pay attention to symmetry, so at times you're only doing a particular exercise on one side.

Finally, this may sound petty but I found her breathy delivery incredibly annoying.  It grated on me terribly and by the end of the workout I was in a fairly bad mood that could only be lifted by a nice post-exercise glass of wine (don't worry -- it was in the evening).",1250035200,,644,4.289256198347108
3618592,1,B001GP5TK4,"I love Denise Austin but this workout is not so great. I think if I were a dancer I would have gotten the hang of it and enjoyed it. But since I'm not, I found the instructions to be very poor. The moves are not explained and it was hard for me to follow along.",1246838400,3,261,3.7636363636363637
3618593,4,B001GP5TK4,"This is one of the most fun workouts I've done in a long time. I love the dance portion (she moves quickly with little explanation so you just kind of have to jump right in). Luckily there is enough repetition of the moves that even a novice dancer can catch on. When I started getting down the moves I was having a blast and actually caught myself smiling a few times!  How often can you say that about a workout? The pilates portion of this tape is excellent, too. Really great moves that I could feel firming and toning my body from the first few seconds. This is a fun and effective workout that I would highly recommend.",1235692800,11,625,4.296610169491525
8306521,5,B001GP5TK4,This Dvd is just what I was looking for in a quick Pilates workout. The dance part is ok but I really like the standing Pilates and the floor Pilates. I got a used one and was very happy to see that it was in great condition without any scratches. The standing Pilates is about 10 minutes but I felt truly satisfied with the workout. To me this is an Awesome DVD.,1505001600,,363,4.055555555555555

8306525,5,B001GP5TK4,"I love the 30 minute cardio. I worked up a good sweat and it works the hips areas. Denise has some good moves that I have done in the past in Zumba classes and it was a lot of fun.  I love the 10 minute standing pilates workout. I can do all of the exercises. A lot of the moves in the mat  pilates section are too hard for me, but I can work up to them gradually. This will be a regular workout for me. I am in my 60s and half an hour of moderate aerobics is all I need as long as I work up a good sweat. I also like do toning after the cardio. And the pilates sections are perfect for that. This is my first Denise Austin workout and I have ordered several more of here. I do not find any cueing issues.
