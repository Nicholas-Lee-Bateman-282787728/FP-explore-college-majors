8056453,5,B00091QSTC,"I and my friends have viewed a number of Gospel-based videos over the years, some of which have moved me to tears, and I do not easily weep. I have to say that I am happier to see the accounts of those people who met Jesus face-to-face and were moved by him than I am to see those who chose to reject him! Yet we do certainly all need to see what the Gospels have to say about those who chose to reject him. The Sanhedrin (with the notable and admirable exceptions of Nicodemus and Joseph of Aramithea); the cowardly and greedy Judas Iscariot; and Pontius Pilate, and of course Herod, the Tetrarch of Galilee (if that is the correct title of Herod the younger). They made their despicable choices and they had to burn with the inexorable consequences of their tragic actions. Though this video might be somewhat more disturbing to the very young and very sensitive than the others were, it is still an excellent and very inspirational video. We do indeed all have something to learn!",1400544000,,983,4.4972067039106145
