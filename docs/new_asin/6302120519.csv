427076,4,6302120519,"Take the story of a man torn between two women, add the music of Johann Strauss and the scenery of 1840's Vienna and you have The Great Waltz, an irresistible cream puff of a movie.  Miliza Korjus-rhymes with gorgeous and she is-portrays the fictional opera singer Carla Doner in a delicious performance that verges on May West camp, murmuring most of her lines through a perpetual full-toothed grin and waltzing herself giddy while singing absolutely impossible sounding obliggatoes to Strauss's walzes-never loosing a beat and never out of breath!  Luise Rainer's innate sweetness and vulnerability are perfect for Poldi, Strauss's devoted wife.  Watch her silent reaction when she realizes that the song she thought he wrote for her was actually intended for Madame Doner-incredible acting.  On the other hand, Fernand Gravet, as Strauss, is unexceptional and a bit bland.  Among the excellent supporting cast, Hugh Herbert as the befuddled music publisher and Curt Bois as the comic, but wise violinist are outstanding.  The movie does require a temporary suspension of belief.  It is full of improbabilities, including the all-female orchestra that performs Tales of the Vienna Woods in a biergarten--wearing evening gowns, Madam Doner's apparent ability to glance at a piece of music once and perform it word and note perfect (the citizens of Vienna take this one step further by singing along even though the waltzes in question have yet to be published!), and the most peculiar version of Die Fledermaus ever performed. If you are looking for historical accuracy or musical purity, this is not your movie, but if you want a delightful Hollywood operetta, you can't do much better than The Great Waltz.",1006646400,43,1709,5.170289855072464
427077,5,6302120519,"the voice of miliza korjus is the most redeeming reason for having this video. She was a rare gift to the vocal world...and hated by Jeanette Macdonald, because she knew Ms Korjus had a better voice and was most  certainly more beautiful! It is not to be missed for the glorious singing  of Miliza Korjus!",952387200,24,305,4.527272727272727
427078,2,6302120519,"This is not ageless cinema. It's dated, but it's fun. The scene where Strauss composes the Vienna Woods Waltz is one of the best in the picture (I'm giving no details away). The history is flawed, but the rags to riches  story is definitely a fun thing to watch on rainy afternoons. Music is  wonderful...of course!",939168000,16,315,4.607142857142857

427130,5,6302120519,"Purchased this movie for an elderly aunt who remembered seeing it when it came out in the late 1930's.  It arrived very quickly.  At first, I was concerned that it was a Japanese remake due to the mostly Japanese writing on the cover.  Turns out it is in English & plays beautifully.",1367452800,,283,4.403846153846154
427131,2,6302120519,"I saw THE GREAR WALTZ decades ago and had a pleasant memory of this romantized version of the Waltz King. I finally got this imported copy from perhaps Russia or a Slavic nation. It gives subtitle in that Slavic language plus loud narration repeating all the lines on screen. As all instructions are in that Slavic language, I have no way to know if I can turn the subtitle and loud narration off so I may listen to the English conversations and the music. It is very disappointing. Furthermore, the packing is so tough and it took me a long time trying to get the DVD out.",1363564800,,573,4.364485981308412

427133,1,6302120519,"This is a very old movie with minimal music. Also, the story is fiction with about 10% of real events.",1360972800,,102,4.15
427134,5,6302120519,"There are many movies made before my time that I only now learning about and accessing. I was on the internet researching the lists of ""top movies ever made"" and found this movie title on one of them. Being a music teacher, I am additionally interested in musicals or movies about musicians so this one caught my eye. I didn't care that it was an DVD from another country and the cover wasn't in English.....I just wanted to watch the movie and see if it was as good as a ""Top 100 movies of all time"" should be....My opinion...YES! Buy this movie if you are a music teacher like me and you'll be very grateful to have it in your library....you'll probably love it if you are not a music teacher too!",1328832000,,699,4.303030303030303

Cover IS IN JAPANESE....
Pictures of actors are JAPANESE....

We  DON'T  EVEN SPEAK JAPANESE...
nor do we  read  JAPANESE...

Made in Japan ???
Not  too happy with this,  and the price
wasn't  one of the cheaper dvd's  either.",1315699200,,306,4.803921568627451
427136,5,6302120519,"The title of this movie perfectly describes what it is, supposedly a biographical tale about the composer Johann Strauss the younger, it is actually a joyous fable whose purpose is to express the spirit of his music in a filmic language. To smirk or complain about facts or believability is to completly miss its point. The story moves very quickly and in broad strokes that resemble movements in a symphony. Musical underscoring is present much of the time and when it isn't, the visual editing creates a rhythmic flow that is in itself musical. Beautifully photographed in shimmering black & white, it depicts a picturesque 1850's Vienna of town squares, beer gardens, ballrooms, palaces, opera houses and bucolic countryside. When not being picturesque it is ornate & glittering. The musical sequences are long complex masterpieces of well planned editing that always serve to enhance the music. These sequences and the music are magnificently over the top, exhilarating and operatic in scale.  I would not describe the picture quality on this dvd as restored but the print is good with inky blacks and gleaming whites.
The stars are french actors Fernard Gravey as Strauss and Luise Rainer as his wife but the third lead is the real surprise, Miliza Korjus playing a totally ficticous opera star who, once she enters the story about 15 minutes in, ignites the screen and never lets go. Korjus is no doubt an attractive woman,though hardly a stunner, yet she exudes an erotic radiance that colors the entire film. Gravey also gives off a sexually orgiastic quality during his conducting frenzies. It's wonderful to watch (and hear) and I can't quite explain how deeply this film has taken hold of me, 3 weeks after discovering it, I keep returning to watch parts of it almost daily.
After seeing this I have vowed to discover other 1930's Hollywood operetta musicals.",1310774400,4,1870,4.97444089456869
427137,4,6302120519,"This movie is a real treat. High quality filming, fine acting and magnificent singing, performed by the incredible Miliza Korjus.

427138,5,6302120519,"Most of my life all I heard about was this movie called ""The Great Waltz."" My dad knew all the characters, the actors and loved the music. In the late 1980's I went to buy him the VHS video. The smile on his face was priceless. Frequently when I'd be home from out of town he still would say how much he loved this film. I watched it with him and noticed how his arms and hands felt every score's movement. I bought a copy for me as well. When he passed away earlier this year I was so tempted to place this film in the casket, but didn't. If you enjoy this genre of music by all means purchase it. It's lovely!",1304121600,5,611,3.975609756097561
427169,5,6302120519,"Movie goers from China and Taiwan through out generations adore this masterpiece. My parents at ages of 92 and 84 respectively saw the movie in China during the war with Japan. China delclared war with Japan in 1937 during World War II long before US did. Japan then blocked entire coastal line in China to cut off any supply from the sea. In the hardship of war US supplied China with necessities through air cargos and land delieveries including movies.

Shortly before 1949 Chinese Communists took control of China, my parents fled to US protected Taiwan and got married. My siblings and I saw the movie several times in two decades before coming to US. Personally I had not see the movie again since the arrival in US in 1986 until 1997. I moved from Utica to Poughkeepsie in 1989 and moved again to New Jersey in 1992 ever since. I found the movie in VHS form at a vintage store in Dover. I watched the movie over and over with different views and feelings.",1298332800,,962,4.497142857142857

427173,5,6302120519,"""The Great Waltz"", 1938 Black and White, musical.
The rags to riches story of the creator of the lively polka-like, waltzes, ""Blue Danube"" and ""Tales from the Vienna Woods"" Johann Strauss. His girlfriend and childhood sweetheart is a humble baker's assistant. He meets a glamorous and wealthy singer. Who will he choose? The story holds your attention, but the reason to watch this film is the many beautiful songs by several exceptional singers. Lavish sets carry away your imagination. Beautiful costumes by the man who clothed the ""Wizard of Oz"". Too bad this is not in color. They should put out a colorized version. It is a crime not to.

This movie even made me laugh once. The story has a moral dilemma, which I comment upon, under the ""comment"" button below. But, do not read my comment until after you watch the movie, because I reveal the ending.

I do not know the quality of the prints (Russian & Korean) available here, because I purchased the Portuguese release, in English, subtitles can be turned off, from Brazilian-Cinema. Other releases are available too online, elsewhere, if you Google.",1253059200,,1107,4.882978723404255

427175,5,6302120519,"Korjus (for whom alone I bought the DVD) was thrilling, better than her CDs I think.  Don't really care for the Strausses (with exceptions), but she was a miracle.  Good enough acting, actually an interesting story, good music (if you like J. Strauss Jr.).  The lyrics by the way were by Hammerstein.  He kept repeating his best line - it went, Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!  Highly recommended if you like either Korjus or Strauss or both.  Oh.  And Korjus was a good little actress herself!",1220140800,3,477,4.7439024390243905

427177,4,6302120519,"The highly fictionalized fantasia on the life of the great Johann Strauss. This 1938 film is a sacher torte of pleasure for anyone who loves his music and, in the lead, Fernand Gravet does a commendable job acting-wise. The very attractive - albeit large-boned - Polish soprano Miliza Korjus sings with a truly brilliant voice & she became the object of intense jealousy from M-G-M's reigning diva, Jeanette MacDonald! Because it was decided that there wasn't room for two Prima Donnas at the studio, the firmly established MacDonald was kept on the payroll while the European Korjus virtually went into American obscurity. Backgrounds for the film were shot in Chino, California. It is rumoured that portions of this underrated gem was indeed directed by Josef Von Sternberg.",1033430400,27,776,5.118110236220472
