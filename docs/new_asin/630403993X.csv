8461273,5,630403993X,"Powerful, Magnificent & Moving, if I had to describe it in three  words.  But since I don't let me begin.
God's Trombones is an awesome  work.  At the end of the trilogy, I always find myself longing for another  spiritual experience.  My senses were overwhelmed, as my eyes viewed the  unique video/art effects and my ears heard the melodious voices.  I  thoroughly enjoyed the mixture of singing and narration.  Especially in  ""The Creation"", narrated by none other that James Earl Jones.  What better voice to describe such a powerful story.  Of course, he does an  outstanding job of telling the most important story of all.  You can hear  the trumpets sound, as he tells the tale of creation.
My soul was touched  by the mixture of animated claymation and harmonious chords in  ""Prodigal Son"" (my favorite, of the three pieces).  The syle in  which the vocalists performed the songs with such dynamics, and the  narrator with such expression, made me feel I was in the theater audience,  not at home on the couch.  What an excellent way to tell a biblical story.  I can still here the chourus with all the powerful lyrics...""Babylon,  Babylon"".  (The voices are so moving, I wanted to know where I could  hear more of them, buy a CD perhaps.)
The ""watercolor in  motion"" effects in ""Go Down Death"" are beautiful.  A  marvelous account of death; ""sitting in the bosom of Jesus"".  And  such imagery, when the pale white horse races through the galaxy.  This  piece is perfect for those of us trying to come to terms with the death of  someone close to us, not just for children, but adults as well.  I just  can't impress enough how well done this trilogy is.
If you are like me,  ""God's Trombones"" is one video that you will watch again, and  again as if you are watching it for the first time.  With the amazement of  a child, mouth open and eyes wide with excitement.  After all, there is a  child in each of us.  We should visit this child from time to time.  Next  time you do, make sure you watch God's Trombone's...you'll experience God  through the eyes of a child.",965174400,15,2076,4.561643835616438
