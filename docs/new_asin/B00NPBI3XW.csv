Although it is a standard B cast they do a good job and raise the film up a notch.  Tamblyn plays the son of a famous gunman who has trouble fitting in because of his dad's rep.  Determined to break the mold, he is badgered into a fight by Myron Healy. a embittered deputy.  Defending a young woman (Gloria Talbot), who herself is plagued by having a famous outlaw father, he gets into a fight with the deputy and ends up losing his job and getting kicked out of town.  The sheriff likes him and tries to help him.  He travels to a town filled with desperadoes and a gang of young toughs.  Led by Percy Lopez and including Scott Marlowe and Wright King, the gang pulls penny ante crimes and is just of the cusp of becoming real outlaws.  Tamblyn falls for Talbot and shows his metal to the young gang.  Solid B and well worth a watch.",1419638400,,967,4.292817679558011
8679674,5,B00NPBI3XW,"As a fan of ""B"" western movies, especially those made in the 1950s I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. A great performance by young Russ Tamblyn in the lead role. If like me you enjoy movies from this era, you can't go wrong with this one. As always with the Warner Bros. Archives the quality of the dvd is very good.",1414886400,,314,4.25
