8385662,3,B0030BOCFK,"Maria Holic is a weird series that makes fun of the yuri genre...but even though it makes fun of the yuri genre, I feel like it's not doing a good job doing it.

The main character Kanako goes to the same school as the one her parents went to where they met. The thing is that it's an all girl school, but Kanako doesn't mind because she has a phobia of men and breaks out into hives upon contact. By bad luck she ends up encountering a beautiful girl but discovers that this girl is actually a man (AKA a trap) that is cross dressing as competition against his sister to see if they can survive the school year without anyone finding about their true gender. However because Kahoko found out, Mariya decides to make her life a living hell.

The series is mostly a slice of life as Kahoko tries to score with the girls at the school (none of them seem to realize she's a lesbian) and despite her bad luck, she manages to get a bunch of friends.

I think the biggest problem with the series is the unfortunate implications that this entire series has. Yes it's hypocritical for a cross dresser to bully a lesbian but the things Mariya threatens Kanako with is downright offensive at times and not funny. Threatening to burn her. I can do that. Threaten death on her. That's pushing it. Threatening to rape her knowing that she breaks up in hives if a guy touches her? That's not funny. It's blackmail and the fact that Kanako fears of anyone finding out her sexuality (despite making it very obvious to the viewer).

The other problem is how inaccurate Kanako is portrayed as a lesbian. So apparently she's a lesbian because she doesn't like men. It doesn't work like that (not saying that it's not possible but just because of an embarrassing incident in elementary school, she becomes a lesbian?) Also, the fact that Mariya calls Kanako being a lesbian and disgusting makes it come off as homophobia. Kanako's self esteem seems to disappear as the series goes on as nothing goes right for her given Mariya psychologically abuses her, blackmails her and also uses his feminine looks to make Kanako submit to him. It would probably not be a problem is Mariya honestly was a woman but the fact that Mariya is a male underneath that and how his sister Shizu apparently takes a masculine appearance in comparison, its very disturbing.

Which comes to the characters. Most of the characters are very bland except Kanako and Mariya. Since the anime needs their interaction, they get the most screen time but there is no character development in this season. Maryia only gets a few redeeming moments to show he's not a horrible person but it doesn't seem enough given how there isn't a single episode where Kanako gets a happy ending. The manga takes the problem out though giving serious thought to Mariya and Shizu and their bet but other than that, the series seem to focus on the comedy aspect instead of explaining the backstories of characters (then again the characters are so bland it probably doesn't matter).

This anime would have gotten a lower rating because of these implications that piss me off, but even though I'm appalled by Mariya's personality and annoyed with Kanako's idiot personality (she gets herself in a bad situation half the time after all), I do like the artwork and the attempt of trying something different in terms of story. However, I heard that the second series does better with handling the characters and the series does its research on the church.",1361836800,,3480,4.641233766233766
8385663,3,B0030BOCFK,i started watching this series its not bad just wondering if the creaters are thinking of a english dub verison of this. well they may have to found two people to play Mariya.,1342915200,,175,4.333333333333333
8385664,5,B0030BOCFK,"I usually DESPISE comedy anime, for the basic fact that it usually isn't very funny.  However, Maria+Holic was a blinding exception. Though I am not sure if it is an anime for everyone (because of the yuri, japanese-specific jokes, and a little perverse) it is definitely one I reccomend.  The complete collection comes with great bonus features and the subs are absolutely beautiful.  Take a good look at it, don't take it TERRIBLY serious, but enjoy Maria+Holic and it's nosebleeds.",1282003200,,484,5.025
8385665,5,B0030BOCFK,"So not much else to be said about this anime that the other reviewers haven't already covered. But  if you want a good laugh then this is definitely worth watching. I was really glad that they released  this to the US as soon as they did since I watched it from some fansub groups and thoroughly enjoyed it but thought this will never make it over here, but what a nice surprise. One thing I can say is you can ignore the goof that gave this 1 star because it only has subs. From what I've seen, most of the time american dubs only mess up an otherwise great anime.",1278028800,2,565,4.127272727272727
8385666,4,B0030BOCFK,"In Jan. 2009, the 12-episode anime television series ""Maria-Holic"" began airing in AT-X in Japan.  Adapted from the manga series by Minari Endo (""Dazzle"", ""Hatenko Yugi"") for the Japanese seinen manga magazine, ""Monthly Comic Alive"" back in 2006,  the anime series was produced by SHAFT (""Hidamari Sketch"", ""Mahou Sensei Negima!"", ""He is My Master"") and directed by Akiyuki Shinbo (""Hidamari Sketch"", ""Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha"", ""Bakemonogatari"") and series composition by Masahiro Yokotani (""PoPoLoCrois"", ""Himawari!"", ""Sgt. Frog""). Character designs are by Hideyuki Morioka (""Arcade Gamer Fubuki"", ""Sakura Wars"", ""Ultimate Girls""), art direction by Toshiharu Iijima (""Uta~Kata"", ""Gad Guard"", ""Hidamari Sketch"") and music by Tatsuya Nishiwaki (""UFO Ultramaiden Valkyrie"").

""Mario-Holic"" is about main character Kanako Miyamae.  Kanako has transferred to Ame-no Kisaki Girls Academy Dormitory Junior and Senior High School, the school where her mother met her father and hopes one day to find her true love at the school.  The thing is, Ame-no Kisaki Girls Academy is an all girl's school and Kanako is a lesbian who hasn't come out of the closet and she also has a problem.  She's a horny teenage girl who can't stop thinking about thinking of hot girls nude, in their underwear and each time she does think about them, she unfortunately gets a massive nose bleed.

But how long can she hide her wild thoughts?  She surely can't pretend that she likes guys because just a touch from a guy gives her hives.

Her first day of school started well as she meets the beautiful Mariya Shidou and her rude maid Matsurika Shinouji. Mariya's grandmother is the former chairperson of the school and her family owns part of the grounds of the school.  But Mariya's beauty captivates Kanako's attention.  But it's just the first day of school and already she sees a lot of beautiful girl's that she's interested in.  As Mariya tells Kanako that she will show her around the school, for some reason, when she touches her...Kanako gets the hives?

As Kanako follows up with Mariya's promise of showing her around the school, Mariya goes to her archery class and when she walks into the dressing room, Kanako finds out that Mariya is not a she but a he.

So, upset and devastated that Mariya is a guy dressing up as a girl, she vows to make her secret known.  Until Mariya shows Kanako his bad side and reminds her that her family is powerful and that her grandmother was the former chairperson.  And also, knows that Kanako is in fact a lesbian.  Immediately, Mariya goes into blackmail mode and has Kanako around his little finger.  If she says anything, she'll have more to lose than gain.

As for why Mariya is dressed up as a girl, we later learn that he and his twin sister Shizu are fulfilling their grandmother's wish of switching genres (she being a guy at an all-boys school and thus developing a hatred towards guys).

But with Mariya using Kanako and toiling with her emotions and the fact that Mariya is her roommate, how much will Kanako be able to stand?  Especially with beautiful women are all around her, can Kanako survive this school year?

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Maria Holic - The Complete Collection"" is presented in 16:9 Anamorphic Widescreen.  But what I enjoy about ""Maria Holic"" is its visual presentation.  Instead of going with the traditional anime art backgrounds or character design, for the series, there are so many variations of presentation for the series.  You get the standard presentation of the character design but the trees and surroundings are painted differently, you get visuals that look like oil paintings, visuals that look like '70s to '80s style of manga artwork, 8-bit video game style of artwork, 3-D artwork, hilarious super-deformed artwork and more.  Needless to say, this is a different style of anime series that instead of focusing on the typical frames around a certain scene, each scene has a different style of background at times.  So, ""Maria Holic"" is pretty creative in presentation.  Each scene is not consistent, so you get something different in short bursts in each episode.

As for audio, audio is presented in Japanese 2.0 with English subtitles.  The series is front channel driven but dialogue and music is clear.  For those who want a more immersive soundtrack can easily switch their receiver for stereo on all channels.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I really enjoyed ""Maria Holic - The Complete Collection""!  Although not a deep or serious anime series, it's one of those anime series that is so quirky and strange but yet presented in the most creative way as possible. After watching ""Maria Holic"", although not shown on a major television network in Japan, I hope the series receives some continuation because the characters are fun to watch and you wonder how this series will end.

As for the series, ""Maria Holic"" is not a demanding serious.  It's not for the serious-minded and truthfully, you can skip around from episode-to-episode because only a few are somewhat connected but its presentation is probably mostly driven by its quirkiness of its characters and its visual presentation.

As for the DVD, I was thrilled to see several special features on this DVD release.  Typically these days, a lot of anime series only have the clean opening and ending themes and trailers but ""Maria Holic - The Complete Collection"" has the Japanese voice actress interviews plus the Christmas 2008 screening which was pretty awesome to see and many others included on this DVD release.

Overall, ""Maria Holic - The Complete Collection"" is an anime series for anime fans who wants something different but at the same time fun, humorous, visually creative when it comes to artistic presentation.

If you are looking for a series that isn't too demanding or too serious, then definitely give ""Maria Holic - The Complete Collection"" a try!",1268179200,15,9106,4.856400259909032
