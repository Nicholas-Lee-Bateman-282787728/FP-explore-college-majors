3712172,5,B001NCE3XO,"I didn't know this was a Christian movie when I rented it from RedBox.  What a fantastic surprise!  I live on the East Coast and love all things surfing.  When I rented this movie I didn't know what I was getting, I just thought I would give it a try.  I ended up sharing it with my whole family and have recommended it to several friends.  My pre-teen daughters have fallen in love with Bethany Hamilton and we have ordered some of her books.  Although they can't decide if they want to learn to surf, or are scared to get in the water because of sharks.

I had never even heard of Christian Surfers International.  I can't tell you how wowed I was by this movie and the work in the world these people are doing.

Cool stuff!",1301270400,2,726,4.202898550724638
3712173,1,B001NCE3XO,"Like all great propaganda the movie starts out by pretending its something its not, a traveling surfing movie. At first it really seems like this with two interesting boys that are given the opportunity to travel the world and surf. But once you are sucked into the movie because of the surfing and traveling aspect then suddenly the propaganda starts and just gets heavier and heavier. Hello? Can I just enjoy the free spirit of these kids, the travel locations and the great surfing without all the Christian propaganda? I guess some church must have heavily funded the movie so they had no choice, but it leaves a bad taste in the mouth. This movie is trying to convert people to Christianity instead of just showing the joy of youth and surfing as it should. Maybe it should have been titled Love Your Lord and Surfing instead of Walking On Water.",1300147200,5,851,4.642384105960265
3712174,1,B001NCE3XO,"If I had known this movie was an attempt to proselytize me I would not have purchased it.  As the movie starts your pedophile warning instincts will begin to tell you that something may be wrong as a stranger convinces two families to let him take their young boys on a trip around the world.  The ""you need the Lord"" message is subtle for a while and the surfing footage pretty good, but as the movie progress the intended message becomes too much to tolerate.  Amazon should describe this movie differently, it should not be labeled as a surfing movie, it is more accurately an evangelical christian sales pitch.",1283558400,4,614,4.614678899082569
3712175,4,B001NCE3XO,"This was not what I expected, but it was still very worthwhile watching.  I didn't realize it was more of a documentary.",1232409600,2,120,4.454545454545454
3712176,5,B001NCE3XO,"We love this movie!  My boys are up incoming groms (ages 5 and 3) and they love this movie.  I love the story and the surf scenes.  (Also, love that it's wholesome with excellent surfing.  No trashy party scenes or half naked girls)  It's the next ""Endless Summer""",1229040000,9,264,4.416666666666667
3712177,5,B001NCE3XO,"Im an adrenaline junky at heart so I LOVED this film:)  I also know not everyone wants to get up and try everything they see on film, and so watching is enough to make them feel like they were there & yet still be in the comfort of their own surroundings. However, for others, watching this film will inspire them to do more! Wether it increases the desire to pay life-lessons forward like Jennings did or motivates one to get out and do something adventurous in life, Walking on Water is a MUST SEE that anyone will connect with.

*Fantastic surfing footage, funny moments, and an incredible message, this film takes you on a journey to look at your own life & what an experience like this would be like!  I hope you will get a chance to see it yourself!!",1229040000,5,756,4.347517730496454
3712178,5,B001NCE3XO,"I just watched this the other night and really enjoyed the excellent footage of most of the best surf spots in the world. The message is positive, and left me wanting to reach out to other surfers.",1229040000,3,197,4.351351351351352
3712179,5,B001NCE3XO,I had a chance to see this movie with my kids in a big theater out in California.  The film is very entertaining and the two boys are very funny.  The boys adventure in Africa were a highlight for my son and daughter.  This uplifting movie has some great messages for kids. The movie received the highest rating from the Dove Foundation and is approved for all ages.  If you looking for a movie to watch with your kids this one is great.,1228953600,9,437,4.228915662650603
3712180,2,B001NCE3XO,"I was very disappointed in this film.  It is really a documentary of 3 surfers trip around the world--NO real story line.  There is some surfing in the film but no relationship encounters that are memorable or endearing to the viewer. There is not a lot of footage surfing the ""mavericks"".  Generally it is persons talking about surfing.  Disappointing!!!",1432771200,,355,4.966101694915254

3712184,5,B001NCE3XO,Loved this movie. More like a documentary type and not what I expected. I really was inspired after watching. Loved the journey they take and lessons learned. Taught a really positive message to young surfers. I ended up trying to research on the internet what happened with the two boys featured and how their lives turned out. Really fascinating. Highly recommend.,1427846400,,366,5.016393442622951
3712185,3,B001NCE3XO,"Cool movie, but slightly religious which i did not expect. kids seem to have fun and the surfing is amazing for such young kids. Very jealous of their experience.",1427328000,,162,4.620689655172414
3712186,2,B001NCE3XO,"It is a bit of a bait-and-switch movie meant to tempt the audience with surfing (cool!) and then push a religious message (trying to make it cool by association!).  They gradually increase the religious language in a carefully titrated manner; kind of humorous if one is aware of what the editors were going for.  The content of the religious message is not enlightened or unique.  Just statements about how faith in the Lord will see one through difficult times.  A true and important sentiment to many people, but the message is not unique or delivered in any artful manner.  This is a trick movie that parents can show children to make religion seem more hip, and/or get the conversation started.  If you are looking to pull a religious bait and switch on your kids, then I this would seem to be a good choice.",1412294400,,813,4.611111111111111

3712192,5,B001NCE3XO,"If like adventures and the Lord, you will like this movie. Especially good for teens. It will motivate you to get off your couch and go catch a  wave in Hawaii, Peru, Australia, France, Indonesia, South Africa...",1393459200,,212,4.72972972972973

3712194,1,B001NCE3XO,"I received the DVD and since I took it out of the box it seemed not good to me. I unpacked it and check the back of the DVD for some scratches and it was in perfect conditions but the DVD is burned, is not original. I did not pay for a product that is not original. I was very dissapointed. I played it and got stuck 3 times. I want a refund of my money",1389139200,,353,3.6578947368421053
3712195,4,B001NCE3XO,"The surf shots and scenery was amazing, but I was surprised that it was a deeply religious movie. It was a bit preachy for a surf movie. Not bad, just not what I expected.",1378684800,,171,4.0588235294117645
3712196,1,B001NCE3XO,"I ordered this in error. I wanted ""Walk on Water"". I did  watch it, and I will never watch it again. I want to give it away but I do not want to make an enemy.",1374710400,,159,3.4166666666666665
3712197,5,B001NCE3XO,"I found this movie to be a realistic faith-filled inspiring documentary that teaches selfless sacrifice and endurance.

3712199,5,B001NCE3XO,"Two Surfers. One Dream. Finding Faith on the Journey of a Lifetime.
I found this DVD at Office Max today, of all places, and figured I'd give it a try. It's a surfing movie, and talks about FAITH on the cover...and it's under $10, so sure.  I JUST finished watching it, and it's very inspirational. It's a documentary, kind of like Endless Summer, but with a man who is taking 2 kids around the world. During their travels the kids see how blessed we Americans really are, when they see kids who don't have adequate clothing, but still have joy in their hearts.  The boys learn that it is better to give than to receive, that people are more important than the newest T-Shirt.
The trio travel to Peru, Africa, Australia and other places, meeting many other Christian ministers and children that live each day by faith. If you love youth, surfing, and/or the Lord, you will love this movie.",1370044800,5,889,4.55
3712200,5,B001NCE3XO,"The story is simple, but the message is powerful, the cinematography arresting and the music -- Josh Garrels, Katie Herzig -- perfect for its story.",1369612800,,148,4.96
3712201,1,B001NCE3XO,"The title is all you need to know. Christian propaganda. It's a real shame too cause kids living out their dreams should be inspiration enough. I should have realized something was up when the guy who invited the kids to go on this trip wasn't even surfing in the movie. The guy probably doesn't even know how to surf. I wonder if the two kids in this movie will grow up to realize that were used as a prop to trick children into thinking that if you believe in god, all their dreams will come true.",1364256000,,499,4.208333333333333
3712202,4,B001NCE3XO,"Great video for pre-teen & teen Christians who are into nature and/or surfers.  Beautiful film footage, awesome music and great testimonies.  Our whole family really enjoyed it.",1362096000,,177,5.518518518518518
3712203,1,B001NCE3XO,"Obviously the producers or somebody associated with the movie created different accounts and rated this movie 5 stars over and over again. I mean, it's pretty obvious with reviews such as ""fun for the whole family"" by Mother Of Two Groms and similar generic ""my whole family loves it and there's a great message at the end"" reviews from users by the name of Beach Mom and the like who have only reviewed this movie and nothing else.

Yeah, this is a Christian propaganda movie. If you're Christian then good for you. If you're not... then you've just been bamboozled. The movie was a bit better than the one star review I'm giving it, but seeing these fake accounts really pissed me off.

So yeah, nice fake reviews there, guys. Couldn't see through those.",1353369600,,756,4.634328358208955
3712204,5,B001NCE3XO,I bought this for my husband who has brain injury.  He used to be a surfer.  We have watched it over and over and it never gets old!  So well done.,1351814400,,147,3.6774193548387095
3712205,5,B001NCE3XO,"Great Surf Movie, that talks about the walk w/ God.  Its not an ""in your face"" movie...Its a great movie to show ""Youth"" groups.",1344902400,,128,4.333333333333333
3712206,5,B001NCE3XO,"I love watching surfing and this movie was mesmerizing!  It was beautifully told and an amazing story of a mentor with two kids.  Refreshing to see a good, clean movie against the typical Hollywood rubbish these days.  Disagree with other reviews, it is not ""preachy"" at all.  They present the gospel in truth, can't disagree with that.  Absolutely loved it, great family flick, especially for Dads and sons.  It's all about guys having fun as they travel the world.",1333152000,5,466,4.8354430379746836
3712207,1,B001NCE3XO,"The movie is more about Christianity than surfing.  I rated it low because it's somewhat manipulative.  It starts with solid surfing from some young groms and a few subtle religious messages.  Slowly it cuts the surfing and goes heavy on the religion.  No problem with the message, but the movie isn't being marketed as what it really is.",1332547200,4,338,4.775862068965517
3712208,3,B001NCE3XO,"Beautiful shots of the kids and pros surfing. But be prepared to be, more or less, constantly preached at about Christianity. This is basically a travel log. Sort of what we did on our trip, and how we love Christ. i would have given it another star if it weren't for the preaching.",1331856000,,282,4.339622641509434

3712210,5,B001NCE3XO,Great movie with an awesome message; highly recommend this movie to everyone but especially to those who surf.  If you are living and surfing without a purpose then you need to see this movie - life is about worshiping and serving God by serving others.,1329782400,,253,4.622222222222222
3712211,5,B001NCE3XO,"My husband's always watching surf videos, and now that our little boy is two, he's begun to take a great interest in them... the only thing is... many of them have a lot of content that's inappropriate for a two year old to watch (bad language, bikini women in super tiny bikinis, etc.).

This is a great film for my son to watch because it follows two great kids (who can surf better than I can ever dream of surfing) traveling the world and seeing that there's a lot more to the world than a bunch of fun waves, beautiful beaches, and gratuitous product placement. It's fun seeing my son get excited about getting into the water. :)",1327881600,3,634,4.372881355932203
3712212,4,B001NCE3XO,"great footage of some great surfers.  enjoyed the story and the movie but i was disappointed in what i thought would have been a great opportunity to explore the real meaning behind the idea to travel the world with a couple of young surfers.  the message was spoken but not acted out nearly as much as i would have hoped.
good stuff at any rate!",1323388800,,346,4.3076923076923075
3712213,5,B001NCE3XO,"I bought this movie for my surfer niece and nephew. We really enjoyed the surf scenes, the music and the message.

3712215,2,B001NCE3XO,The scenery was nice with all the waves and the different parts of the country. I was looking for more of a story line than a documentry. It would have been better to learn more about the boys and the fellow that went on the trip with them and their families.,1307923200,,259,4.098039215686274

3712219,1,B001NCE3XO,"I had no idea this was a Christian movie.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for a little Jesus now and then and the first of the movie started out great with only subtle Christain messages.
