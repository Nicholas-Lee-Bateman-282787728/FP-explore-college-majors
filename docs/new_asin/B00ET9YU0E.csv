8609304,5,B00ET9YU0E,"What you'll get
The DVD shows the training of Philippine Marine Force Recon on a 2 day course instructed by Tim Waid. The DVD contains two discs without regional restrictions. It contains:
 Introduction (12 min)
 Footwork (20 min) (don't skip this, it's the basis for every following topic)
 Bolo (29 min) (could also be applied for machete, kukri or baton fighting)
 Knife (23 min) (could also be applied for karambit, kubotan or pistol striking)
 Counter-Knife (7 min) (just empty handed counter knife; armed vs. knife is shown in the other topics)
 Empty Hand (24 min) (edge of the hand, palm or elbow; no fist strikes in here)
 Rifle / Bayonet (21 min) (striking with a rifle, he doesn't makes a difference whether a bayonet is mounted or not)
 Rifle disarming (11 min) (shows difference between disarming a rifle with or without sling)
 Rifle retention (13 min)

The System
Invented for military purpose in 1998 by Tim Waid. Break down of the complex Pekiti Tirsia Kali System to the bread and butter parts that can be learned in a few hours and can actually be used in real close combat.

Pro's
 Determined instructor (by watching the DVD you will have no doubt that he is willing and capable of killing you with the shown techniques. You also see this in using clear language like ""counterattack"" instead of ""defense"" or ""kill"" instead of ""put-your-preferred-political-correct-synonym-in-here"")
 Demonstration with full combat gear (instructor shows full program in tactical vest, sometimes with rifle slung on back. The shown techniques still do work in full gear)
 KISS at it's best (80% of the techniques are based around angle 1 and 2 and some basic footwork. He makes some parallels between shooting and close combat for demonstration purpose. So he takes what they already know to explain them something new. The simplicity of the system is probably it's strongest advantage.)
 Every attack or counterattack is made in movement, out of the line of attack, with some simultaneous cover for yourself against weak points of your opponent (that wouldn't be covered by an enemy soldier wearing a ballistic vest and a helmet)

Con's
 Pricy (for a 3 hours DVD; but for the information you'll get it's still worth it in my opinion)
 Missing the pistol part he mentioned (so with just a little fantasy you can think of it yourself, as it is very similar to the knife technique; however, instead of repeating the introduction part again on the second DVD they could have shown this for example)
 Instructor often lets the opponent attack in  a way his system teaches (angle 1 or 2) even though he sometimes allows them to attack with a straight punch for example.
 A little short on empty hand knife counterattack
 A force-on-force part conducted by the trained soldiers would have been nice to see what level they reached after this 2 day course (though not a real negative point, would just have been a nice idea)

Who this is for
I see primarily 2 groups of people who could benefit from this:

Soldiers
Soldiers have very limited training time and need a system that can be taught and learned within a few hours or days. It has to work under high stress, which means that the system has to base on simple movements and be as easy as somehow possible. It has to work with full gear on and with different types of weapons against differently armed opponents (rifle vs. empty hand, empty hand vs. knife,...). The main objective is to kill the enemy (not going to the ground, not controlling, not long fighting). This system is specially made for those purposes and fulfills all the listed requirements.

Law enforcement
Like Soldiers LE guys have limited training time and need a stress resistant system. The main difference is the weapons/gear and the objective here. If you are not SWAT you probably won't carry a rifle and a tactical vest on a daily basis. I can still see high benefits for normal LE  from this system. If you use a baton like they show you the use the bolo (in the DVD they even use sticks for training purpose) or if you use your handgun like they showed the use of the knife (if for example attacked empty hand while you have the handgun drawn and don't want to shoot the other guy, or if he attacks you with a knife on close distance). You may have to change the target areas to stay on the legal side (first strike goes to hands normally, but for the second strike you may want to chose something else than the face of the opponent).

(Martial artists)
For a martial artist this system is probably too simple. Don't get me wrong, this is a huge advantage for the soldier or the LE guy, I just doubt, that you would be satisfied to learn those few (very effective) techniques for years. Never less you can still profit especially from the footwork (getting off the line of attack) or are may interested in topics that aren't covered anywhere else (like how one would fight with a kukri or a palm stick...). Even though this isn't shown explicit you'll get it after watching the DVD.",1485216000,2,5010,4.696
8609305,3,B00ET9YU0E,"Great video, you get to see the great Tuhon Waid teaching Filipino Marines in close quarters combat. too bad its more like a documentary on what they learn, instead of being an actual tutorial for the buyer/viewer. You will only learn what they show to the Marines in this video. It needs to be more of a tutorial directed at the viewer.",1452470400,2,337,4.451612903225806
8609306,5,B00ET9YU0E,An excellent crash course on functional FMA applied to the battlefield. It also has a good amount of practical information for civilians. Simple and easy to learn. I recommend this product.,1422057600,,189,5.129032258064516
8609307,5,B00ET9YU0E,"Good presentation of material, the only problem I had with the product is that it would not play on a dvd player and only on my computer.. Might have been an oversight when it was made, but still a good program.",1412726400,,211,4.170731707317073
8609308,5,B00ET9YU0E,"I will say that if your looking for close-quarter combative fighting techniques that are based on the Filipino Martial Arts, then this would definitely be the way to go.  Regardless of what others(or myself) think or heard of Tim Waid, he does have body mechanics, understanding of the Filipino Martial Arts, and the way to communicate it effectively in this video.
  Most of the striking techniques are firmly rooted from a combat modality, where an individual (or soldier) will already be armed with the basic military gear that most fighting forces across the globe are already familiar with (i.e. Rifle, some type of knife or blade, sidearm or handgun, bayonet...).  The video starts with the premise that the solider or combatent is within close range (within 3 to 6 feet) and will have to deal with the enemy on an empty hand basis or employ one of the many tools that he has available within a close quarter scenario (interior of buidling, hallway, heavy vegetation area, etc).
  Overall, the video is very practical, easy to learn, easy to employ and if trained with effectively, can be utilized with a CQC arena.",1407110400,3,1121,4.842931937172775
