I thought the story was interesting considering the person took his story from life's experiences and true to life according to him.  Now, he isn't a Denzel or a George Lucas therefore I thought the story wasn't bad.  Very entertaining, but sad.  I am tired of Black Men wanting to be pimps, players, and just plain ole bull shitters but I think this man is trying to change his life and let you see what this lifestyle can lead too.  You will never be respected by the masses and only the people at this level will look up to you.  But over all the story did keep my attention in the sense that I can't believe women acutally bought into this crap.  Where are they now?  For the most part, I think he is a good writer may not wanna hear this stuff but he is giving it to you raw and uncut.  He is from the hood so consider the source.",1328140800,2,884,4.12280701754386
8325228,1,B000IOMYAC,"Trust me when I tell you this is one of the worst documentaries I have ever seen. Ron was a young pimp from California who had a large stable of woman and some success during the 80's. What could have made this documentary something special is the interesting selling point of Ron's three sons, and the so called MCA scandal. They were a singing group  called the Newtrons(Ron Newt spelled backwards)and up and comming R&B group created by there father. They began to have a large following locally, appearing at the Jackson Ranch and even on Soul Train. How was Ron Newt a pimp with very little education able to sucessfully put this together? How was he able to negotiate a multimillion doller deal with MCA? What were the origin's of the scandal? The Newtrons were about to take off like a rocketship into superstardom but instead crashed and burned. This should have been the focus of the film instead the documentary glosses over The Newtrons the main point of interest, in favor of 50 minuites of Ron and his friends talking over and over about how great they are. How much money they made, who was the greatest pimp and other nonsense. This sadly becomes both repetitive and pedestrian. These grown men, (Ron included) many in there 40's and 50's began to look like caricature's and clowns. This is a rush job that could have been great but instead it just comes off as lazy feeble attempt to pimp the public.",1215734400,9,1416,4.619047619047619
