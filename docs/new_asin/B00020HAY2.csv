2053093,5,B00020HAY2,"Larry Blamire wrote, directed and stars in this spoof of 1950s b&w science fiction movies that entertained audiences on Saturday afternoons.  The movie is not perfect, but if you remember with affection films like Plan 9 from Outer Space and Attack of the Crab Monsters, you will laugh out loud many times.  Written in 5 days and filmed in 10-1/2, from props to costumes the film captures the look of old sci-fi standards, and is even filmed in Bronson Canyon, the location of many a schlock feature, and uses vintage film music to excellent effect.  While the plot, involving a good scientist and an evil scientist (both of whom travel with their microscopes), aliens and their escaped mutant and the evil lost skeleton (bought on eBay for $100), is very good, the script could have used one more rewrite, and the pacing in the middle third is way too slow.  I'm giving it five stars despite those problems because I still laughed over and over, and the DVD features were great.
DVD extras include: a Q&A session at the film's 2002 premiere; trailer; a commentary track with Blamire and crew; a cast commentary; bloopers; cartoon; an 11-minute making-of featurette.
If you enjoy old sci-fi classics in spite of, or because of, the visible wires holding the creature costumes together, you should check out this funny and affectionate spoof.",1088726400,54,1341,4.868421052631579
2053094,2,B00020HAY2,"If you're going to revisit something old-and-bad-yet-cherished-by-the-cheese-loving-masses, you should either (a). seek to improve upon it or (b). strive for irony--neither of which TLSOC accomplishes. Mere modern reproduction does not irony make, and if you're deliberately tossing ""stylistic improvement"" out the window, then the ironic element is critical to the story's success.
Sure, it was mildly entertaining to watch the rigid reinforcement of stereotyped binary gender roles ... but The Rocky Horror Picture show addressed this theme better. Yes, it was entertaining to observe the age-old ""fish out of water"" scenes wherein the alien couple tries to plug in to humanity's social structure ... but hell, the SNL Coneheads were more convincing. Indeed, Animala represents the personification of ""otherness"" inherent in aggressive feminine sexuality ... but everyone from Eartha Kitt to Vampyra has done it with more depth and panache.
I appreciate what The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra was shooting for--really I do--and I get the jokes. I understand what they were aiming for with this film ... but unlike the people whose raving reviews I've read, I didn't think it was very special. Its in-your-face terribleness is so ham-fisted that it defies analysis, and its strict insistence on imitation permits no commentary on the form. TLSOC severely limits itself even while it pats itself on the back for being so true. That's dandy and all, and I surely appreciate the attention to detail. But what the producers of this film have missed is this: the old black-and-whites are great because they took themselves seriously and pop culture's long run failed to--not because they weakly poked fun at the creative and technological inadequecies of the past.",1088467200,7,1755,5.36231884057971
2053095,5,B00020HAY2,"The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra proves that THEY can make em' like they used to. This movie actually feels and looks like it was made around 1961. This movie was shot in black and white and filmed in Bronson Canyon, California where many other B-Monsters found a hospitable home while trying to conquer the earth. Even the musical score sounds like the stock library music B-Movie filmmakers used in those days.  So if you love
Plan Nine From Outer Space (1958) and Catwomen on the Moon (1952) then you will really enjoy this film.
 In this Special Edition DVD of The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra
you get:
 1) A Technicolor 1940s Ub Iwerks cartoon ""Skeleton Frolic""
 2) ""Obey The Lost Skeleton!"" making of featurette.
 3) Two separate audio commenteries. The Director (Larry Blamire) and Crew. And a very funny Cast commentary.
 4) ""Q and A at the American Cinematheque"". Quite interesting.
 5) Full color blooper reel.
 6) ""Virtual Skelectables"". A Imaginary collection of early 1960s Lost Skeleton bubble gum cards, games, drinking glasses
and box cover art of a ""Aurora Model Kit"" of the alien mutant
monster from the Lost Skeleton movie. Stuff you will never find
on EBay.
 7) Last but not least, a excellent retro style Lost Skeleton
trailer.
 I really enjoyed and appreciated ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"". Check it out and ENJOY.",1088380800,3,1330,4.845132743362832
2053096,5,B00020HAY2,"Praise the cinema gods! The return of kooky 50's Sci-Fi, with cheezy not-so-special effects, dialogue that even Edward Wood Jr. couldn't come up with, and an inane storyline, makes The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra a must see. You've got it all here, a mad scientist bent on world domination. A male and female alien trying to pass themselves off as Earthlings, the hero who wants an unheard of element (atmospheium) to make the world better, and more goofiness than Plan 9 from Outer Space and The Brain from Planet Erous put together.
Note the hot chick Animala. Though she was made from forest creatures, note her tight fitting costume and short haircut. Remind you of anything? No? Than my friend you have yet to see the 50's classic 'Cat Women on the Moon'. Watching her dance is one of the highlight of the film, as is her culinary skills at the dinner table.
Of course no Sci-Fi picture would be complete without a man in a monster suit, and you have it here too. Though you can see the guys boots sticking out of the celery stalk body, you go along with it, knowing that that's how you are MEANT to see it.
And last but not least, this movie introduces 'The Skeleton'. If the skeletons lines don't slay you into a laugh fest, check your pulse. Whether he's laying in the cave giving out orders or 'running' through the woods, you got to love him. His fight scene with the mutant monster can only be described as momentous.
For those who are sick of multi-million dollar movies without personality or fun, than The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra is strongly recommended.",1087862400,43,1566,4.576512455516014
2053097,5,B00020HAY2,"Bad movie aficionados everywhere should love this film. The tone is perfectly sincere; scenes are authentically static, cluttered with wonderfully clumsy dialog. The actors are spot on. The DVD is filled with lots of nice extras. Highly recommended.",1087776000,3,249,5.578947368421052
2053098,5,B00020HAY2,Never befor has something so horible entertained me so much. The fact that it embodies every bad or cheezy aspect of a 1950s B movie makes it something magical. Filled with quotible lines and unforgetable caritures makes this one of the best movies I have seen in ages. Don't be expecting cinematic amazement but do be ready to laugh tell it hurts. If there was one way to descibe this movie it would be laughable perfection.,1084665600,7,425,4.605263157894737
2053099,5,B00020HAY2,"I was a kid when I saw ""Airplane"", a new idea back then, a hack that made young innocent me insane with laughter.  I've since thought that, like a first love or first drug high, no experience could ever again afford me such bliss.  Oh, but... if Airplane was Mr. Rogers, The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra is Sesame Street.  I laughed so hard my lungs shrivelled, my brain fermented for lack of oxygen and my jaw locked open permanently.  Looking back on the event (through now permanent tears of craziness) I see something else in Lost Skeleton... it's not just comedy, it's ART!  If you think this might be your cup of tea, I say, get yourself in the right frame of mind (be SURE to not be alone), then don't look back -- you truly will never be same.  Lost Skeleton is a NEW experience.",1083715200,6,783,4.328767123287672
2053100,5,B00020HAY2,"This movie was just plain fun on so many levels. The bad dialog, the over acted acting, cheesy effects. Some might think of it as an ordinary b-movie but it's a clever homage to them. It plays it straight and never let's on that it doesn't take itself seriously. It will have your eyes watering and sides hurting from laughing so hard. And since it was made for $40,000 it shows it's just more than an homage. It shows you don't have to have a giantic budget to make an entertaining film today! I can't wait to get this one on DVD.",1082073600,14,531,4.215686274509804

Well if you answer yes to thhat, then this movie is for you. It has all the quirks of an old movie. The cheese of it all just makes it amazing to watch. It is a black and white films, but that just adds to the movie. The actors just bring that certian thing to each character that makes you just laugh at them. I am keeping this short and simple, but I am not a huge B-film fan but this has it all for a great movie.",1481414400,,545,3.831858407079646
2053104,5,B00020HAY2,"I think the thing that I love most about movies of ""this era"" was how wrong they imagined space exploration / travel. As someone who is very much into that subject... Just about everything from spaceships to space itself they were always way, way, off the mark. This film of course was purposeful in in doing just that but with all things Science. I loved the touch of using the old ""Science in a Box"" kits that so many kids had which mainly consisted of a microscope, some test tubes, and a few liquid and dry chemicals. Both of the super scientist in the film can be seen using one of these kits to do their very important science. Oh and the special effects will blow you away!

2053139,5,B00020HAY2,I've become somewhat of a blu-ray snob.  But back to the science.  I love this movie and wouldn't trade it in for anything.  It is a loving homage to the thrilling if somewhat preachy B movies of the 50's and 60's with a lot of humor thrown in for good measure.  There are a couple of fun special features on this disc that really add to the experience.  If you love those sci-fi movies of yesteryear then open up your wallet and dump it all out on your keyboard.  Find that credit card that still has some money left on it and buy this movie RIGHT NOW!  I promise you that you will not regret it!  And then when you are done go find the sequal.  Also be on the lookout for the third film coming soon!,1400457600,,701,4.0583941605839415
2053140,3,B00020HAY2,"Science fiction from the 1950's was a special kind of creature born from Cold War paranoia of the era. Lots and lots of movies about invading aliens, rampaging monsters and all sorts of nefarious mayhem. The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra is a nod to these movies done with a tongue in cheek level of parody. Much of the style and themes do hit their mark, but at the same time the movie does lack some essentials like pacing and maybe a little more focus on the source material. In the end you have a movie that's fun to watch if you are into making fun of these sorts of films, but the rest of you may get bored.

The plot is deliciously 50's that intertwines multiple themes into one film. A scientist and his wife track down a meteor in order to find a rare element. At the same time another scientist searches and finds a remote cave that holds the fabled lost skeleton, who also wants the element to help him rule the world (or something like that). At the same time you have a pair of aliens who crash landed and need the element to get back... oh yeah... they also let loose a violent monster by mistake. With these elements they made a movie that covers maybe more than half the themes from all those 50's Sci-Fi films.

So why do I say you can get bored? The movie has fun with some ridiculously redundant dialog. That dialog is very entertaining... for the first few minutes. However as the movie goes on this style of dialog keeps going and going to the point where it is no longer a joke and more like filler to keep the movie at a longer running time. So for much of the movie the plot moves at a snail's pace. I dare say this movie can be condensed by a good 20 minutes at least by shortening the dialog and getting the story moved forward faster. Not only would you not miss much besides longer dialog you would have a much leaner and more enjoyable spoof.

This is a low budget film, and because of that I have a hard time critiquing the acting all things considered. However I can at least comment on what could have been done better. So this movie based on 50's Sci-Fi, which includes 50's deadpan acting or theatrics. While the director did have the actors do everything in that subdued monotone level it wasn't quite the same. I recommend more viewing of those classics to get a better bead on the acting style. I hear filming only lasted ten days so I am sure timing constraints had a lot to do with it as well.

The movie is rife with intentional inconsistencies that plagued many flash in the pan thrillers of the day like visible wires, monsters wearing shoes, spontaneous costume changes, and more. This really adds to the fun, and makes a decent ""pick the mistake"" game when watching.

Special effects were fun, but some of the animation effects felt out of place. Maybe too ahead of the era? The cinematography was done post production, and some scenes feel very, very authentic while others you can tell more modern cameras were used. Again this is more a budget limitation than anything else. The music comes from stock scores and give this film a perfect soundtrack. Hats off to the score editing.

This Special Edition release comes with a few extras that help enhance the experience for fans of this kind of film spoofing. Here is the breakdown:

Commentaries - One crew commentary and one cast commentary. The cast commentary is the funner one to hear with lots more information and funny anecdotes about production. The crew commentary has a little bit of information overlap with the cast commentary, but there is still some interesting stuff in there... especially for aspiring movie makers.

Obey the Lost Skeleton - A behind the scenes featurette that ends up having a lot of the same information as on the commentaries. Think of this featurette as pure information and the commentaries as more entertaining.

American Cinemathque Q&A Session - The initial release of the film was at American Cinemathque, and this is the question and answer session they did after it. It was shot on a video camera and is kinda hard on the eyes compared to the rest of the DVD. The cast do have some fun responses to the questions, though.

Blooper Reel - Like other blooper reels, but this one has the color footage before processed in that 50's B&W wash. That alone makes this an interesting extra.

Virtual Selectables - Fake merchandising for the film.

I can see the allure of this film and am glad it has been as successful as it has been. I just wished storywise and scriptwise it was a tighter production with less fat and fluff. If you enjoyed the old MST3000 shows this will definitely give you lots to make your own little sit down session with friends. Hard core ""spoofers"" may get a kick out of it too.",1399939200,,4732,4.48953488372093

At first the only thing available was the sequel, so I bought that. Then after special ordering from two separate locations that could not fulfill the order, I found a region 1 copy out of the U.K. So if you like a-rate parodies of b-rate classic sci-fi, then this is the movie for you! The cast is hilarious and the brilliant, terrible acting and purposeful mistakes make this a hilarious and memorable film!

the other 15 of us, who where suckered into paying for this inanity, and actually watching part of it, we have a few questions to ask. why is redundant dialog redundancy supposed to be funny funny? (""let's together do this, together!"") why is campy acting and intentionally stupid plot supposed to be witty? why is maniacal laughter prolonged long after it is obvious that it is being unnecessarily prolonged necessary? (""hahahahahahahahaha! ah, hahahahahahahahah! aye, hahahahahahahahaha! eh hahahahahahahahahah!"") why are cheap costumes and a space ship made out of a painted toilet paper roll supposed to be clever?

the answer to all these questions is: this is a ""funny movie"" for people with no sense of humor. people who must be told, by stylistic exaggeration, that what they are watching is supposed to be funny and they are supposed to laugh now. people who always laugh when other people laugh. they're not sure why -- they just laugh. and it's also a vanity project, hoisted on the premise of a satire, which allows the inherently clumsy acting and comedic misfiring to masquerade as intentional parody. if only.

there is word play, then wit, then joking, then comedy, then satire, and parody, caricature, clowning and buffoonery, and then ... what comes next? we don't have a word for it, because it's too stupid to deserve mention. well, this movie has encapsulated it for all to see and to remember: ""CADAVRA: noun. kitschy humor, feeble and fatuous wit, pretentious folderol. as in, 'the young woman yawned at the old man's flirtatious cadavra.'""",1388016000,2,1878,4.917981072555205

Unfortunately they try way too hard at this spoofing thing and it comes out ridiculously unfunny.  However I am a brave soul so I went through the whole movie waiting for that little piece of redeeming social value. I even sat on my hands so I would not press the fast forward button.

They did include many of the proper characters such as Paul the scientist and Betty wife of scientist.  Then there is the infamous Dr. Roger Fleming the mad scientist. Toss in aliens, a mutant, and a mysterious girl that know how to act with her tongue.

While most of the things that we here are clichs and purposely stilted dialogue every once in a while we catch a line from a famous movie.  I am wondering how many lines I just did not realize were from famous movies?  Such as when Kro-Bar (Andrew Parks) exclaims """"You know it's funny but in a strange way I feel almost at home here."" well close to a enough to Forbidden planet.

It is the fifties and different factions each are searching for an element called atmosphereium. Each for his/her/its own purpose. Who winds and will alliances help in the struggle to obtain this rare and potentially dangerous element?

2053171,3,B00020HAY2,"Most bad movies are simply bad--but now and then you come across one that is actually bad in an entertaining sort of way, with the films of Ed Wood perhaps the most famous.  Released in 2001, THE LOST SKELETON OF CADAVRA is an homage to such films and it parodies the style.  The dialogue is particularly Ed Woodsian, with on-going word repetitions and frequent phrase inversions, and the skeleton and ""special film process"" references to William Castle.

The plot is actually somewhat involved.  Scientist Paul Armstrong (Larry Blamire, who also wrote and directed) and his wife Betty (Fay Masterson) are staying in a cabin in the woods while searching for a meteor containing ""atmospherium.""  At the same time, a spacecraft carrying aliens Kro-Bar (Andrew Parks) and Lattis (Susan McConnell) has crashed nearby; atmospherium is needed to repair the ship.  Mad scientist Roger Fleming (Brian Howe) seeks to bring the Lost Skeleton of Cadavra to life--and needs atmospherium to do it.  In an effort to disguise his intentions, Roger steals an alien ray gun and transforms several woodland creatures into Animala (Jennifer Blaire), who licks and wiggles.  There's also an escaped mutant, a hapless farmer, a hapless ranger, and all sorts of similar nonsense.

Fans of drive-in dreck will likely find the whole thing a hoot: the actors manage to capture the essence of bad 1950s acting; props are made from whatever is at hand (a caulking gun becomes a ray gun); the editing is deliberately flawed (items of clothing change between shots.)  It is a lot of fun ... but the film does have a downfall.  It's about fifteen minutes too long, and one feels it would have been more enjoyable if it had a shorter run time.  The special edition contains several extras that are slight but fun.  Certainly not for everyone, but recommended for hardcore fans of 1950s B horror movies, who will get the joke.

Blamire and his troupe of legitimate and canny acting professionals (no, you can't just wing this stuff; you have to know HOW it was originally done and WHY it descends to us as quaint and quirky) keenly understand the faux-conviction that informs those old films and renders them so naively charming today. These talented people take the cheesy tropes over the edge, make you blink in disbelief, and then establish a new edge.  Cheaply.

Those kitsch-meisters of the '50s might have gazed forward with their atom-powered crystal balls, watched Blamire's movies, and actually learned something from them. I'm not sure what. But surely it must be up there on the screen... somewhere?

2053184,5,B00020HAY2,"A loving homage to the schlock horror films of the early 60s, Lost Skeleton takes that favored approach of sticking a bunch of clueless actors in the woods to act frightened of things. The performances waffle between purposeful absurdity and reasonably faithful classic B-movie acting, and this is deliberate- the goal of the film was not to recreate a classic b horror film, but to recreate a really BAD classic B horror film. That said, every performer also emits a sort of genial wink-wink-nod aura that strips the movie of basically any pretension and makes the whole cast quite likeable.

The plot is a mashup of basically every sci-fi movie made between 1958 and 1969. It doesn't bare much description and talking about it would ruin all the zingers anyway.

While this film is only available on DVD it's a very clean digital print that upscales nicely. The audio is atrocious by design. Features are quite robust, and the making of/panel discussion clips are well worth your time.

Overall this is a film that will absolutely appeal to fans of the genre, fans of absurdist outsider comedy, and anyone with fond memories of Mystery Science Theater 3000 (although there is no connection save for the lampooning of classic horror-sci fi). If you can't stomach black and white cinema or you like your comedy more on the frenetic side your mileage may vary, but garish color zany madcap b horror movies are already a pretty robust niche.",1329782400,,1439,4.841463414634147

This spoof takes advantage of most (not all) of the qualities of those films to make something utterly ridiculous and, for the most part, very funny.  They certainly have the look replicated to sheer perfection and the casting is inspired.  If I have any complaints at all it's that this film should have been shot in full screen format, like all of the oldies, instead of widescreen (much as I love widescreen and hate full screen), and the screenplay wasn't quite up to par with the unintended lunacy of the originals.  The originals were quite earnest in what they were doing, however daffy the monsters were or the super-serious scientists that went up against them.  They weren't out to make a `bad' movie, it just kind of happened that way.  In this parody, unfortunately, the gimmick of double talk is overused to the point that it doesn't mirror anything I ever saw in any of the old 50s flicks, instead, it becomes an invention of the writer/direction/star Larry Blamire.

In Plan 9 From Outer Space, a hubcap on a string wobbled past the window and an actor said perfectly seriously, ""That's nothing from this world.""  This whole movie is like that.

And it's supremely quotable.  Examples:
""I'm a scientist.  I don't believe in anything.""
""Who knows how many millions will die by its hand?  If only it did have hands, my woman.  If only it did have hands.""
""We take our horrible mutilations seriously up in these parts.""

It bears some similarity to another of my favorites, Top of the Food Chain (also known as Invasion! (1999)) with Campbell Scott.

A great deal of effort was spent to duplicate the bad, bad dialog and the use of not so appropriate but cheap locations.  And many of the actors manage to approximate the looks of people from the 50's, but not quite.

A stunning study of the forces that drive us through life, and several people's attempts to resist transcending their assigned place in the scheme of things.

*****Spoiler Alert*****

Scientists do science, housewives cook, aliens undertake cunning clandestine surveillance missions among the humans, evil scientists do evil science, all while a malevolent skeleton attempts to subvert people's free will and a mutant rampages across the land in a murderous spree that the park ranger seems helpless to stop. Oh the humanity!

Why people cannot see the message writ here is beyond me. I will never be able to read Dostoevsky in the same light again, mainly because I can't get the odd Wattage bulbs for it these days.

Suffice to say that Kubrick, Jackson, Scorsese at al could learn a thing or two from Blamire.",1285718400,2,951,4.91875
2053195,5,B00020HAY2,"""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"" recounts that fateful day that ""the Earth was disemboweled in terror!"" Filmed in the miracle of ""Skeletorama,"" Larry Blamire's wonderful spoof of great 1950's science fiction films pays homage to and pokes good-natured fun at this genre of a golden cinematic age. Shown in black and white, the film doesn't miss an element that makes the old sci-fi films wonderful: the sets are perfect, the special effects are beyond perfect, the cast is incomparable, and the tone and nuances of the film are exactly on the mark.

Largely filmed in Bronson Canyon, the movie opens with Dr. Paul Armstrong (Blamire) and his wife Betty (Fay Masterson) driving a Thunderbird up a narrow road. He is a scientist, and they are looking for a meteor that has recently crashed in the area which Paul suspects contains atmospherium, the most rare radioactive element. Meanwhile, Dr. Roger Fleming (Brian Howe) an evil scientist, (""I'm a scientist; I don't believe in anything"") is hunting for Cadavra cave in the same area. Another ""meteor"" lands, but this one turns out to be a spaceship from the planet Marva, carrying Kro-Bar (Andrew Parks,) Lattis (Susan McConnell,) and a mutant (Darrin Reed.) The mutant quickly escapes, alarming the aliens, who also need atmospherium to repair their ship.

Roger finds long lost Cadavra Cave and it's famous occupant, the Lost Skeleton of Cadavra under a sheet about five feet from the cave's entrance. The skeleton comes to life for Roger, and immediately starts insulting him. The skeleton instructs Roger to get him atmospherium to help completely revive him. He then decides to rest (""I sleep now!"") leaving a three-way competition for atmospherium in Bronson canyon. Paul and Betty find the meteor full of atmospherium and the others scheme to obtain it. Lattis and Kro-Bar change their appearance into that of normal humans with their transmutatron, and decide to visit Paul and Betty in their cabin, although they are puzzled by their strange Earth clothes. The dialogue about Kro-Bar's tie (he finds the ""neck restrainer"" most uncomfortable) and Lattis' dress, which she refers to as an ""inverted cloth funnel"" is priceless. In another touch of genius, the aliens have great difficulty understanding how stairs and doors work (""This is insanity!"") and finally provoke Paul and Betty to open the door. Paul and Betty are puzzled by their strange mannerisms, and all four actors (especially Susan McConnell) are masters of subtle expressions and physical comedy in the cabin scenes. I found it a hilarious touch that as weird as their Marvan names were, that Blamire had the aliens choose yet another set of equally odd Earth names for themselves when they introduce themselves to the Armstrongs (Kro-Bar becomes Bamin, while Lattis becomes Tergasso.) Betty thinks they are the Taylors who rented them the cabin, so they are invited in for drinks. When invited to sit the aliens look anything but normal when they declare ""Fold yourself in the middle!"" and sit with a great flourish. Lattis quickly polishes off a very strong scotch and soda and gets talking about girl stuff with Betty (""I also appreciate your soft cloth funnel, Betty."") As her intoxication worsens Kro-Bar alleviates everyone's discomfort with the reassurance that ""My wife sometimes forgets she is not a space alien.""

Outside the cabin Roger saw the aliens use the transmutatron to change their appearance, so he makes a date for himself by firing the transmutatron at four different forest animals, creating the beautiful Animala (Jennifer Blaire, Blamire's wife) in the process. Blaire is wonderful in her velour catsuit. Her animal traits are perfect, and I especially love the fuzzy black booties that conceal her feet. Roger teaches Animala how to speak and eat with humans, then they go knock on the cabin door. The scenes that follow are a lesson in physical comedy, emotional control, and direction for actors and filmmakers alike. The dinner scene is beyond hilarious, and the wonderfully stilted dialogue is delivered absolutely perfectly.

The skeleton commands Animala to bring her the atmospherium (""Amish terrarium"") and he even tries his mind control on Betty, who passes out. The aliens figure out what Roger is up to (Lattis deadpans the line ""You are different from the other humans...more disgusting I think,"") and they agree to form an alliance to get the atmospherium from Paul. Before it's over, Animala does a very seductive dance for Paul (whose dancing is much less seductive, and much funnier.) This musical cavorting causes Paul to bring the meteor to the spaceship. Betty goes looking for Paul and is immediately carried away by the hideous (and deeply amusing) mutant, while great 1950's style music plays, followed by betrayals and a lesson in street smarts for Lattis and Kro-Bar.

I love that through it all the skeleton is incredibly abusive to Roger, the one person who actually cares about him, and Roger's next task is to set up a horrible skeletal wedding of horrors preceded by more dancing. Betty, Paul, Kro-Bar, and Lattis go inside the spaceship (""It's just like your house, only it travels through space"") and have some refreshments, in this case wine from cherries (""what we call 'linbooba,'"") although Lattis' earlier indiscretions notwithstanding, Kro-Bar insists that on Marva they gave up getting drunk ""eons of your years ago,"" which was an extremely subtle nod from Blamire to Ed Wood, which I absolutely loved.

I love the cheesy skeleton movements, especially when he walks and climbs down the mountain while Roger dutifully asks ""What orders do you have for us, my bony wonder?"" The skeleton hypnotizes Lattis and Kro-Bar and forces them to dance (the laughter quotient is turned to eleven during the alien dancing) before marrying Lattis himself. That, of course, means that Kro-Bar must be dispatched before the ""King of Cartilage"" can wed Lattis, and it's looking pretty bleak for the Marvans. Betty comes to the rescue by luring the mutant to the wedding, and as the wedding gets crashed, Betty battles Animala and Paul battles Roger, who is eventually choked to death by the skeleton for incompetence. Defying the odds, Betty defeats Animala, and the mutant battles the skeleton. It's all very tense, but the skeleton eventually gets tossed off a mountain, Animala gets changed back into four animals (which Blaire says are a fox, a bird, a squirrel, and a lynx,) the mutant succumbs to injuries, even though he has developed a mysterious and loving bond with Betty, and in the final scene, in perfect 1950's sci-fi style, Kro-Bar delivers a somber and semi-pompous monologue about understanding the differences between people.

The DVD comes with an amazing quantity of extras: there is a cast commentary, a crew commentary, a trailer, the ""Skeleton Frolics"" cartoon short that was shown with the film in theaters, an ""Obey the Lost Skeleton Featurette,"" a cast question and answer session, a blooper reel, ""Virtual Skeletables,"" and previews. Of these the commentaries are absolutely wonderful, and make clear not only the process used in making the film, and the opinions of the cast and crew, but really demonstrate the genuine affection that Blamire and company have for this genre of film. The bloopers are also a must-see, particularly the skeleton miscues.

I cannot recommend ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"" more highly. I have loved these silly sci-fi movies since I was very young, and I always will. This is an amazingly well done, respectful tribute and spoof of those famous movies, and I appreciate Larry Blamire having the vision to undertake this project.

2053198,3,B00020HAY2,"I am surprised, and also not happy that I write this, because I wanted to like this movie, or actually, love it...
I watched the previews, and a lot of the YouTube videos about this and was jazzed up to enjoy it, but man, I was really, REALLY surprised in the differences between the YouTube videos and the real thing. I now know they only showed the good parts on there, and in the previews, which were really good, so good that I could hardly wait until I had time to set aside to watch it without any interruptions.
Just so you know, I wasn't overly jazzed up, I was just hoping to see more of what I had seen in the previews, but what I saw was some 'not so funny' stuff, which I couldn't believe, because, like I said, I really did want to love this movie as much as legally possible...  :)

My problems with it was that they just tried WAY TOO HARD to spoof it, some parts were done really well, but some were just kind'a stupid really, I think they had a really good chance to do something here, and they kind'a blew it.
Not to say that I would tell anyone to not see it, but to pay $10.00 to see it (I saw it Streaming) it wasn't worth that, but it'd be worth a $2.99 rental, but paying more is not a good thing, not unless you are hard-core, and I thought I was. :)
This was definitely 'tongue in cheek', I am aware of that, but there is a limit to how far you (should) go, at least to me there is, and they passed that up way too many times, there were more than two tongues in the cheek, overkill, too much of a good thing.

Really, I'm not trying to ruin the experience for anyone, but at least go in with the possible expectation of it not being all that some say, but, we are all different, and maybe you'll be one of the lucky ones that love it.

Suffice it to say, there are ""motion pictures"" and there is ""cinema."" Our subject, ""The Lost Skeleton Of Cadavra"" is something else.
  As Shakespeare wrote - was it Shakespeare? - wait, we have the quote here somewhere. If we can find it, we will come back to it later.
  Confronted by such a screen spectacle, we tremble merely to contemplate its depths of profundity, its expanse of scope, its pierce of insight, its brilliance of illumination, its reverberation of consequence... Hold on a moment. We shall have to take our medication to stop this trembling before we can continue.
  Science! Is there anything more dazzling, more exhilarating, more utile, more swollen with promise? Yes, there is. Power! Could there be a topic more topical, a surge more surgical, an import more important? Certainly there could be. Sex! What could be more thrilling, more beckoning, more forbidden? Well, there's one thing. Death! Is anything more entrancing to the mind, more hypnotic to the senses, more elusive to the soul? Okay, there is. Wealth! Dreams of untrammeled desire sated, of acquisitive urges empowered, of insecurities forever banished. But isn't that the same thing as Power and Sex? Damn! Those trembles are back again.
  ""The Lost Skeleton Of Cadavra"" has it all and much, much more. Science. Power. Sex. Death. Mysterious meteors. Aliens from outer space. Ray guns. Mutant monsters. Resurrected tyrants. Mesmerized slaves. Did we mention Science? And the seductive, alluring ""Animala Dance""! Your hips will sway. Your legs will twitch. You will be unable to remain in your seat. You will probably go to the kitchen for a snack.
  The film's trailer warns us, ""You'll be sterilized with fear!"" It must be so because we find ourselves impotent to summarize in words a work that wrestles so far outside its weight class, in which each part is greater than the sum of its whole. Yet somehow it all goes together like skeletons and xylophone music. It's very complicated. It's scientific. Or, as Doctor Armstrong edifies his helpmate Betty, ""You know what this meteor could mean to science. It could mean actual advances in the field of science.""
  Who should rightfully possess the priceless atmospherium? Doctor Armstrong, the Earth scientist from Earth, Kro-Bar and Lattis, the stranded aliens who need it to power their space ship home to the planet Marva, or the imperious Lost Skeleton, arising like the noble dust of Alexander to assert his designs of world dominance and matrimony? The issues cudgel the brain.
  The roles of the characters are played by actors. Larry Blamire does all the science as Doctor Paul Armstrong. His meals are prepared by faithful Fay Masterson as his wife and spouse Betty. Andrew Parks and Susan McConnell are brave, resourceful and confused as Kro-Bar and Lattis. Brian Howe is evil as Doctor Roger Fleming. Jennifer Blaire fuses forest creatures together to become Animala. The Skeleton plays the Skeleton.
  Oh, before you go, here's that quote we promised: ""Where be his quiddities now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures, and his tricks?"" We have no idea what it means. Do you? We just dug it up because you can't bury a good quotation. Or a skeleton.",1276646400,,3402,4.973544973544974

2053201,4,B00020HAY2,"I recently viewed Alien Trespass which I think to be the better of the two retro spoofs of post-WWII sci-fi. Unlike LSOC, AT moves smoothly along that fine line between homage and satire, keeping its equipoise throughout. But it belongs more to the category of bigger (though by no means large) budget sci-fi films than the subgenre of LSOC. LSOC is within the Ed Wood realm of bargain basement budgeted sci-fi with a bizarre mix of weird subplots, naively hopeful futurism and good finally triumphing over evil, with self-congratulations emblazoned in the final credits. LSOC and its historical predecessors push doggedly through to the end with clumsy acting and even clumsier special effects -- and without shame. Like Wood, I don't believe many (if any at all) of the cheesy school of producers, directors and actors ever made it to the ""pros."" Actor Steve McQueen (and others), however, did make it beyond The Blob into mainstream stardom, and I suspect it was because the sci-fi level just ABOVE the ""cheesy school"" had actual connections into Hollywood. The tragedy of the unintentional comedy in films like LSOC is that it marked its makers as inept in basic cinema techniques, and left them forever on the outside looking in. Years later, we hipsters get our laughs from their misguided efforts, and Mr. Blamire has captured this sensibility well.

The comedic element (especially the aliens) kept us laughing and in on the joke throughout. Perhaps a bit too knowing for a completely successful satire, it has many rewarding moments, and I give it a warm recommendation.",1269648000,,1579,5.003802281368821
2053202,5,B00020HAY2,"Director Larry Blamire has said on making this film, ""We didn't want to make a tribute to B-Movies, we wanted to make an actual B-Movie.""  Job well done Larry, as this feels so much like the old cheesy-yet-fun films from the 50s.

The two lead characters, Dr. Paul Armstrong and, his wife, Betty Armstrong, are your average couple.  Paul's dedicated to his work and Betty enjoys cooking; but what happens as he waits for a meteor to land?  Well, an evil doctor named Roger Fleming is searching for the mysterious Lost Skeleton of Cadavra in Cadavra Cave, two aliens and their pet mutant from the planet Marva land, and, before ya know it, they're all in a race for that rarest of all rare elements known to mankind known as Atmospherium.

That's the basic concept people.  From there it's nothing but fun and lots of laughs.  Many might not ""get"" the humor of odd/wacky dialogue, but if you've seen plenty of B-movies and/or find yourself entertained by that voice-acting from the original Resident Evil video game, you're sure to get it.  The effects are, as expected, silly.  That and all the hilariously quotable dialogue make this an instant classic in my book!

The DVD features are especially fun as the director's commentary provides great insight in how they created the funny effects, and very funny things that went on during production.  The actors' commentary is also funny, but I personally like the other one much more.  One of the greatest features, in my opinion, is the gallery of promotional art and Lost Skeleton merchandise.  I don't think the merchandise was actually made, but it adds a lot to the fun.  There's an interesting Q&A as well, a simple little video on the making of the whole film, previews to old B-movies, and an Ub Iwerks cartoon!  Being a big enthusiast of golden age animation, I found this to be a very fun bonus.

Many 1950's science-fiction films are entertaining to watch because they are so incredibly bad that they are laughable. Yet, that entertainment value frequently does not last the entire duration of the film. What might be funny for the first half hour or so often degenerates into tedium after that. The same can be said for ""The Lost Skeleton"". I enjoyed the first half hour of this film and found myself laughing quite a bit, but as the film progressed, the joke soon wore thin and by the final half hour, I kept finding myself looking at the clock to see how much was left. Bad acting and a bad script, whether intentional or otherwise, are still bad and whether you enjoy this film or not will largely depend on how much of them you can sit through.",1230422400,5,1042,4.577540106951871

As an adult, I still enjoy them, though for different reasons.  I now get a kick out of the bad production values, the corny stilted dialogue, and the wooden acting.  They're not masterpieces by any means, but somehow I have to admire them for what they are and for the fact that they were even made.

Anyway, Cadavra is admittedly an homage to the horror films of the 50s.  And I feel it captures the genre perfectly.  Yes, it is funny, but the humor comes from the fact that it is played straight, and this was the film maker's intent.  I laughed out loud at many scenes (mostly involving the aliens' attempts to appear human).

I can understand that this may not be everyone's cup of tea, so to speak.  I suspect that some folks won't ""get it.""  All I can say is that I enjoyed it immensely.

2053212,4,B00020HAY2,"The 1950s were the Golden Age of schlock sci fi films- ranging from films so bad they've become classics- Plan 9 From Outer Space, and Robot Monster, to some better than expected films like The Brain From Planet Arous, and Them. It's the first set of films that is taken aim at by the film The Lost Skeleton Of Cadavra- replete with actors playing bad actors, who recite intentionally bad dialogue, that's repeated ad nauseam, as well as bad special effects and a determined `humanitarian message'. This spoof of such films was written, directed, and starred in by Larry Blamire.
  The best part of this film is that, to enjoy it, one need not be drenched in the films it spoofs- it plays as both a `straight' schlock film, and a satire. Blamire plays Dr. Paul Armstrong, a heroic scientist, in love with science, even as he notes scientists believe in nothing, out to retrieve a meteorite containing `atmosphereum'. Fay Masterson is devoted wife, Betty. Susan McConnell and Andrew Parks are aliens named Lattis and Kro-Bar- descendants not only of nineteen-fifties alien stolidity, but the old Saturday Night Live Coneheads couple, in their forced imitations of human customs. Brian Howe and Jennifer Blaire (Blamire's real life wife) are mad scientist Dr. Roger Fleming and his woman-beast Animala- created using the alien's ray gun- a direct knock off of Plan 9's Vampira....  The schmaltziness, choppy editing, black and white, stock 1950s sci fi score, stock nature film footage of the animals Animala's created from, bad special effects- a miniature rocket ship, bad Geiger counter-like devices, and a cheesy inside to the aliens' rocketship, plus typically inappropriate Cold War-era morality playing, make the film an unexpected delight. Some critics think that camp can only occur unwittingly- such as in the cases of Ed Wood, or the worst of the Roger Corman films- and they may be right. But, The Lost Skeleton Of Cadavra isn't camp- it's satire, and there's a difference- self-awareness. Viewed seriously Plan 9 From Out Of Space may well be `the worst movie ever made'- with classic lines as `You humans are stupid, stupid, stupid!' meant to be social commentary. Fortunately, its unintended camp quotient, and myriad laughs, make it far more enjoyable than many sober, and somber films that reek. The Lost Skeleton Of Cadavra does not have that problem, for it's knowingly being bad. While you may not think a scene or line funny, there's an `insider'-type meta-quality to the film that practically insulates it from any criticism. If you loathe `good' bad films along with `bad' bad films you'll never get this film on any level. If you can discern the difference you cannot help but, at least, love- if not revel in the film.

Yeah, they mostly get the look and dumb dialogue right, but the writers depend entirely on the look and dumb dialogue for the humor. That's the original film's job! The satirist's job is to take it to the next level. The folks who created this mess obviously have a real affection for the genre, and I appreciate that. Unfortunately, they have no comedic ability whatsoever that I can see. The actress playing the squirrel was the only inspired thing I could find in this train wreck.
For an original 50s shlock sci-fi film that is also a contemporaneous parody of it's own genre, take a look at 'Invasion of the Saucer Men.'

A married alien couple lands with their pet mutant to look for the same substance in order to power their spaceship.  There is also an evil scientist looking for the substance in order to revive the evil Lost Skeleton of Cadavra, which has been lying in a cave.
Writer/Director Blamire knows his stuff and does a great job of reproducing the kind of dialogue, delivery and acting we used to see in those old films.  He does a pretty adequate job with the film's look and a great job with the music.  Other folks have stated the problem with this movie, and I'm gonna pound it home further.  The problem is that spoofing something that was funny to begin with really doesn't work.  Granted, those old movies weren't supposed to be funny, but nevertheless they are, and it makes no sense to try to spoof them since they're already pretty much spoofing themselves.  That's not to say this movie isn't funny though.  It definitely has it's moments, no doubt about it.  The dialogue and delivery of the dialogue are done in a way to duplicate what you'd hear in the old movies, only it's overblown quite a bit for comical reasons.  This rhythm is maintained throughout the whole film and can be a bit grating on the nerves after a few minutes.  Some folks hated this, and it did bug me at first, but I did get used to it and it does result in some pretty funny lines here and there.
While this movie wasn't the sidesplitting spoof the makers seem to think it is, I have to give an A for the effort.

2053224,5,B00020HAY2,"There have been a few spoofs of 1950's and 1960's science fiction movies before and after The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra, but none have entered the strange and wonderful territory that Larry Blamire does when he wrote, directed and acted in this movie. Filmed on a shoestring in high definition video and screened at the Egyptian Theatre as part of the American Cinemateque series, it was discovered by a  film company executive who fell in love with it and scooped it up for Sony TriStar. It was then transferred to glorious black and white film for general distribution. It still shows up here and there at special venues but now you can grab a copy for your own personal viewing.

This movie goes beyond just a mere Sci-Fi spoof, and enters a whole new hilarious world. It is inspired somewhat by Plan 9 from Outer Space's Ed Wood's work, however this is an original piece of work, not just a take-off. Larry Blamire has an ear for wonderfully byzantine dialogue which turns on and references itself, and does hilarious verbal gymnastics throughout the film. His actors are all professionals in television and movies and have worked with the likes of Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg yet here, they were carefully directed and coached into the roles of enthusiastic but not-very-talented thespians acting seriously (but not too successfully) in a 1960's era low budget Sci-Fi B movie.

This film has layers of enjoyment beyond that of just a humorous imitation of a low budget film. You'll enjoy the carefully crafted too-long pauses in dialogue, the occasional semi-cracking of the fourth wall, the earnestness with which the actors wrap their mouths around the surrealistic dialogue and of course, the purposely low-budget designed yet spot-on rocket ship, monster and creature. The skeleton is well, a skeleton, which talks with a sonorous, self-important, echoing baritone, and the monster a ""Mutant"" which somewhat resembles a walking ear of corn still in its husk, was designed and built beautifully by Cortney Skinner, inspired by the low-budget movie monster-makers of the 50's and 60s'.

The major actors are  Larry Blamire (the earnest scientist), Fay Masterson (The doting but somewhat clueless housewife of the scientist), Andrew Parks and Susan McConnell (wonderfully impassioned and clunky space aliens), Jennifer Blaire (a sexy slinky cat-like [literally] femme fatale), Dan Conroy (a strangely un-able forest ranger) and Robert Deveau as a hapless farmer. These are all roles that you might have seen over the years in various genre movies, but here they are distilled into unexpectedly eccentric and singular comic performances.

This film stands up to several viewings (you'll spot something new each time) and you'll need to watch it a few times just to catch the dialogue you missed because you were laughing too hard the first time.

The DVD extras are as carefully crafted as the movie. There's an astoundingly authentic and funny period style trailer created by Michael Schlesinger, the Sony TriStar executive who discovered this film. You'll see hilarious outtakes (in color!). There's a cast and crew Q&A videotaped at the Egyptian Theatre (at which they were discovered by Sony) The cast and crew commentary is not only more entertaining than most you hear on DVDs but it also gives you an idea of the genuine warmth and affection these artists have for each other. You'll feel like they're in your livingroom with you. The ""Virtual Skelectables"" created by the Mutant creator, Cortney Skinner, are a series of ingeniously designed, imaginary retro collectables... toys, games and figures flawlessly fabricated to look like the real thing, as if the movie actually did exist in the 1950's and these were the products and toys marketed to go with the film. There's also a cartoon short, ""Skeleton Frolic"", a 1937 animated color film by the famed animator, Ub Iwerks.

This makes the perfect gift for that special someone (you know who that is) and a  perfect DVD around which to plan a party...be it Halloween or just any weekend.

2053229,4,B00020HAY2,"Someone from work lent me her copy, and I showed it to a group of friends having only a vague idea what we were getting into.  We sort of moaned at the first five or ten minutes.  Then when the aliens visited the cabin and sat down, we all cracked up.  We had to back it up and watch that scene again -- and then we didn't stop laughing for the whole rest of the movie.  We're going to watch it again with a bigger crowd so more people will get the inside jokes.

It really is a B movie, in the tradition of sci-fi and horror from the 50s, just ever so slightly exaggerated.  It's full of non-sequiters, recycled props, a cardboard rocket that lands in a broccoli forest, a walking skeleton that is obviously being held up by one of the actors, exaggerated acting, bad science, worse science, etc.  It has all the required elements for a sci-fi-horror story: aliens, a space monster, the undead, mind control, a good scientist, his beautiful but ditzy wife (who wears the same June Cleaver outfit the whole way through), an evil scientist, and his sidekick.  It takes place out in the middle of nowhere (just out of sight of the Hollywood sign).  Characters do things and give reasons for their actions, but at some point you have to give up trying to make sense of any of that and just nod and laugh.  That said, the plot hangs together surprisingly (disturbingly?) well, better than many actual B movies I vaguely remember.

It's intentionally ghastly.

As far as I know, they don't advertise this movie, it just gets passed around by word of mouth.

The bonus features are great.  Here's my favorite.  The movie was made recently, but in the style of old-fashioned sci-fi horror flicks, they made mock ups of movie merchandise: a board game, a lunch box, paper dolls, halloween costumes... and pictures of all that are included on the dvd.

If you like Plan 9 From Outer Space, Mystery Science Theater 3000, Doctor Who, Galaxy Quest, Amazon Women on the Moon, and Isaac Asimov's elaborate puns, then you'll like this.

The same crew is supposed to be making a follow up movie called Trail of the Screaming Forehead, and we're eagerly awaiting it.

The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that you really have to have the right audience for this movie to be funny.  I know plenty of people that don't appreciate this kind of humor like I do and just wouldn't get it.",1180483200,3,2378,4.475638051044084
2053230,5,B00020HAY2,"As an admirer of schlock cinema, you would think I spend most of my time revisiting the golden age of bad movies. No, I'm not talking about the 1970s. I watch scads of films released during the Age of Nixon and Carter, most of them appallingly awful, but this decade does not really define bad movie making. We need to look further back, back to the 1950s, to appreciate the truly dreadful potential of b-movie filmmaking. The Red Scare and the Soviet Union's acquisition of the atomic bomb threw America into a fearful tizzy. So did the space race. And what better way to capitalize on people's fears than to incorporate nuclear war and alien invasions into movies. What followed became the real golden age of the bad movies. I don't often go there, not yet anyway, but I know that the 1950s offer a cornucopia of cringe inducing cinema. Movies like ""Them!,"" ""The Day the World Ended,"" and of course ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"". These films achieve such heights of ridiculousness that it was only a matter of time before someone came along and viciously spoofed them. Enter Larry Blamire's ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"".

We have three important story arcs snaking their way through ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"". The first involves Dr. Paul Armstrong (Larry Blamire) and his wife Betty (Fay Masterson) on an expedition to discover a recently fallen to earth meteorite. Armstrong wants to locate the space debris because he believes the rock contains the rare element atmospherium. What's that, you say? Can't remember seeing that one on the chart back in science class? That's because it doesn't exist outside of this movie. We soon learn, aside from how the discovery and use of this element will benefit the field of science, that just a trace amount of atmospherium would allow a person to travel to the moon and back at least a half dozen times. That's the first plot thread, and Blamire could have made a fun film just by following these two dolts around. He decided to throw in two more ideas. The second arc involves the arrival of a spacecraft--populated by the aliens Kro-Bar (Andrew Parks) and Lattis (Susan McConnell)--in need of repair. Unfortunately, their pet, a hideous beast, accidentally escapes from the ship. They need to capture the creature before it attacks the locals. Too, they need some atmospherium to power their ship.

A third arc tells the tale of the infernal Dr. Roger Fleming (Brian Howe) and his plans to resurrect an ancient skeleton located in, not surprisingly, the Cadavra Cave. Fleming figures out that if he can only find some atmospherium, he can use the element to resurrect the skeleton and conquer the world. Or something like that. It doesn't matter what's going on, however, as the plot soon gives way to comedic antics executed so brilliantly that I sat in front of the television with mouth open in wonder. Blamire took great pains to make sure that his script, especially the dialogue, meshed with the 1950s cinematic atrocities so many people know and love. He succeeds beyond all expectation. Nearly every word, every phrase these characters utter, is stupid on a cosmic scale. Armstrong's fascination with the field of science. Kro-Bar and Lattis assuming the guise of humans and trying to navigate their way through a world alien to them. These things are as stupid as they are brilliant, if that makes any sense. The dinner scenes involving these losers rank as one of the most hilarious sequences I've ever seen in a film.

A few other elements of the film really hit the mark. Primarily, I'm talking about Animala (Jennifer Blaire). A whole separate review could discuss the merits of this odd creature, thrown into the movie just to rev up the camp factor. Created by Dr. Fleming thanks to his illicit use of Kro-Bar's transmutatron, Animala is part woman and four parts of different woodland creatures. Her behavior closely resembles that of a house cat. She purrs, drinks milk, and performs a dance number that truly is a marvel to behold. Honestly folks, you haven't lived until you've seen Animala go through her motions. I'd like to see Blamire make a sequel based around this oddball. This marvelous character aside, everything else mirrors perfectly a bad 1950s movie. The cheesy props obviously picked up at a hardware store, out of someone's garbage can, or on the side of the road work marvelously to recreate the atmosphere of a film only Ed Wood, Jr. could love. The costumes worn by the characters and the silly looking monsters are sublime in their awfulness. I also loved the actors' facial expressions and monotone delivery; they give the term ""wooden"" a whole new meaning. It's all intentional, of course, but it doesn't seem like it on the screen. It would be easy to think these really are terrible actors working for a terrible director.

The DVD version of ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra,"" which I suggest you pick up immediately at the nearest retailer, contains several worthy extras that heighten the viewer's enjoyment of the movie. Two commentary tracks--one with Blamire and other crew members and one with the cast--tell you just about everything you would want to know about every aspect of the picture's production. If you're not satisfied, a featurette called ""Obey the Lost Skeleton"" provides additional details. We also get a trailer for the film, previews for schlock classics from the 1950s, a blooper reel, a cartoon, and a Q&A with the cast and crew filmed at the American Cinematheque a few years ago. Run, don't walk, to get a copy of this five star effort. If this movie is any indication, Blamire's next feature (also a satire) ought to be another classic.

2053238,4,B00020HAY2,"Corny, pretentious dialogue. Hokey special effects. Stereotypical characters. Inept pseudo-science. A lame plot full of holes.

So why even bother watching ""Lost Skeleton of Cadavra""? Well, to start with, there's the fact that it's not a hokey sci-fi movie, but a clever, hilarious spoof of those old cheap movies made in the 1950s. It's gloriously pompous and idiotic, with some of the best/worst dialogue outside a Christopher Guest mockumentary. (""Why shake when we can touch other things... like lips."")

Scientist Paul Armstrong (Larry Blamire) and ""scientist's wife"" Betty (Fay Masterson) arrive at a rural area, looking for an asteroid made out of (I am NOT making this up) ""atmosphereum."" Little do they realize that evil Roger Fleming (Brian Howe) has found the Lost Skeleton of Cadavra, which needs atmosphereum to move, and subsequently conquer the world, yada yada.

To make matters worse, a pair of aliens have landed. Not only do they ALSO need atmosphereum, but they have let a lethal Mutant loose on the countryside. Both the aliens and Roger manage to infiltrate the Armstrong cabin to find atmosphereum. Now Betty and Paul must befriend the aliens, and stop the evil Skeleton and the killer Mutant.

The entire movie is mockingly affectionate of those old sci-fi movies -- it's even filmed in the same location as most of them. The costumes are cheap, the aliens are cheesy, and very few of the events make any logical sense. When the Armstrongs and aliens sit in a spaceship and drink ""cranberroid"" juice from decorative candleholders, the goofiness is officially complete.

Admittedly, the plot does slow down to a crawl in the middle, and seems to temporarily lose its way. But fortunately it's peppered with high-school special effects (check out the skeleton climbing down the rocks), ridiculous props (spot the caulk gun),  and the giant fish-faced Mutant, who falls for the Earth girl. It's practically a checklist for old cliches.

And then there's the horrible dialogue. One clunky gem: ""It is different, this 'Earth' as it is called. But then are we of the planet Marva -- as we call our planet -- not also strange and different to think planet and its people also?"" The best plot twist would have to be the ""Bride of the Lost Skeleton"" scenes, which would have made a great title for the movie.

Director/writer/actor Larry Blamire is wonderfully emotionless as Paul, saying lines like ""Betty, you know what this meteor could mean to science. It could mean actual advances in the field of science!"" with a straight face. I certainly couldn't. He's solidly backed up  by a cooing Fay Masterson, intentionally wooden Andrew Parks, and a goofily seductive Jennifer Blaire.

Made on a shoestring budget, with terrible effects and costumes and a clunky script, ""Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"" is a delicious little spoof. Now to wait for the sequel, ""Trail of the Screaming Forehead""!",1160438400,7,2903,5.041753653444676
2053239,2,B00020HAY2,"Parodying old B-grade science fiction is a tricky business.  The Lost Skeleton... assaults the genre with verve, from the alarmingly self conscious script, to the apalling special FX.  The problem here is that it cannot compete with the true and unmitigated unintended awfullness (and self parody) of films such as The Giant Gila Monster(dir. Ray Kellogg, 1959) and The Creeping Terror(dir. Arthur Nelson 1964).

  Whilst the script does offer some absurdist gems  (just listen closely to any of the dialogue involving the aliens, or the Ranger) it lacks a cohesiveness, that suggests that this is parody for the sake of parody, rather than with the nostalgia, affection and sympathy of Galaxy Quest(dir. Dean Parisot, 1999).  Perhaps the most irritating aspect of the film was the consistently pedestrian cinematography.  Many films of the fifties and sixties featured eccentric cinematography for a variety of reasons.  The relatively seamless cinematography here does not match the peculiarity of the dialogue.  This failures highlights perhaps the greatest strength of many of the old B-movies - the ambitious use of the camera.  Whilst this ambition often over-reached the abilities of directors and cinematographers, the passion for film was visible.  Here, such ambition has been removed, emphasising the blandness of the exercise.

And yet, in other ways, it's good.  Really good.""  ""You always know the right thing to say, Dr. Paul Armstrong.""

  The aforementioned Dr. Paul Armstrong (writer/director Larry Blamire) is out to do some science, looking for a meteor made of pure atmospherium with his wife, Betty (Fay Masterson).  The atmospherium quickly becomes a much-needed commodity for visiting aliens Lattis (Susan McConnell) and Kro-Bar (Andrew Parks) along with evil scientist Dr. Roger Fleming (Brian Howe).  Determined to raise the titular skeleton, Fleming requires atmospherium to completely revive the bossy bones.  Oh, and there's a deus ex mutina (Darren Reed) in the spooky woods as well.

  I've seen plenty of send ups of shoestring second-billed films and CADAVRA with its compelling plot and uproarious dialogue ranks among the top along with TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN, PLAN 10 FROM OUTER SPACE, MOUNTAIN OF TERROR DAY OF DREAD, THE COLLEGIANS ARE GO, and THEY CAME FOR THE SILION.

i saw this movie in a theater as part of their 'midnight madness' series. i was very much looking forward to it knowing

it was a camp homage to those old 50's sci-fi grade Z movies.

it starts off good with a couple in their vintage car driving out in the merky black and white countryside.

and then i noticed the main characters hair was not right.

he's wearing a contemporary hairstyle as opposed to what a man would be wearing in the 50's.  what sense does that make?

to make a long story short, everything devolved from there.

the only credit i give this film is the interesting change of black and white film tone throughout the movie.

and i loved the actress who played the 'cat woman'.

i'm glad so many people who wrote in with their glowing reviews of approval had a great time seeing this.

2053247,4,B00020HAY2,"Fans of the 1950's and '60s sci fi/horror ""B"" movies that were so prevalent during those decades will certainly want to give THE LOST  SKELETON OF CADAVRA a look.  Writer/director/actor Larry Blamire shows his love for those movies from a bygone era by creating a homage that is both funny and dead-on.  Filming the movie in glorious black and white and on location at Bronson Caverns where many of these low budget flicks were done is a stroke of genius.  The budget ($100,000) for ...SKELETON was even in the same range as the '50s and '60s models.

The plot contains elements of many of the great ""B"" sci fi movies:  Aliens who crash land on earth, an evil scientist bent on world domination, a hokey-looking mutant with poor costume design, and the platinum-haired hero and his All-American wife.  Throw in bad lighting, bad editing, stilted dialogue, and the ever-present melotronic ""B"" movie soundtrack and you've got the whole package.  The key component (literally) that binds all of this craziness together is ""Atmospherium"", an element found in a meteorite that recently crashed to Earth that each of the above parties (plus the Skeleton of Cadavra) need for various reasons.

Without reveiling any other plot details, let me just state that the formula used by Blamire and the cast are true to these great (and sometimes underappreciated) cinematic gems from the past.  As with some movie spoofs, the viewer will need to watch the scene a second or third time to ""get"" the gag.  Added features to the DVD include bloopers, movie trailers, director and cast dialogue over the film, and a question and answer session with the cast filmed after the movie's premier.

You look over at the person sitting next to you, both your eyes meet, silently saying exactly the same thing at exactly the same moment: ""What the heck was THAT?"" It is a split second of perfect, quizzical communion followed instantly by unrestrained laughter. Some movies just have that effect.

Every good 'n' cheezy B movie has a moment like that. Maybe it was the guy in the gorilla suit out in the desert with a scuba helmet on his head and a bubble machine. Maybe it's the 12 inch lizard with the taped-on fins so obviously thrown into camera range. Perhaps it was the rubber rocks that bounced when they weren't supposed to. Perhaps it's just plain bad editing.  I love those weird B movie moments. The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra is all those things you ran home for on a Saturday afternoon when you were a kid.

Personally, I think the only drawback to this movie is that it purposely makes those 'Ed Wood' goofs.  If it weren't for my knowing this, that the director was actually trying to be that awful, it would be the penultimate ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"".

The opening scene finds them asking for directions from a mysterious farmer (Robert Deveau) who has a strange and foreboding prescence. Unbeknownst to the Armstrongs, an alien ship from the planet Marva has been forced to land in the same woods. In order to fix their ship, the alien couple has to acquire part of the same substance the Paul is studying and after landing the aliens discover that their pet mutant (who is capable of digesting people whole) has gotten loose. As a final twist to the plot, an evil scientist, Dr. Roger Fleming (Brian Howe) is in the same area looking for the same substance that Paul is studying so that he can resurrect the Lost Skeleton of Cadavra and become the most powerful lackey in the world. False identities are formed, massive animal killings take place, strange creatures are brought to life, inter-galatic friendships are formed, and all of it in the pursuit of science.

THE LOST SKELETON OF CADAVRA is one of the most hilarious movies I have seen in a long time. It's perhaps the best parody movie to be made in the past decade. The film is a total spoof of the 1950s and early 1960s sci-fi creature features.  All of the cliches of those films are paraodized to perfection; from the menacing farmer who seems to have a vision of things to come to the helpful law official (ranger) who is blinded about what is really going on to inexpensive props, mad scientists, bad dialogue, stereotypical gender roles, and a ""scary"" monster--THE LOST SKELETON OF CADAVRA has it all. What's so remarkable about the movie is that it doesn't just make fun of the bad movies--it pokes fun at the entire sub-genre.

Larry Blamire not only acts in the movie as Dr. Armstrong, but he also wrote and directed the film as well. It's impressive that he not only wrote the dialogue, but was able to speak so much of it without once loosing character Of course that's due more to good editing and directing, but I have seen parody movies of this type before where some of the performers just couldn't stay in character. That doesn't happen at all in this movie. No matter how corny the dialogue is or how humorous a situation is in, the performers appear like the most devoted of method-actors, immersing themselves in their totally unrealistic roles.

There are some points in the movie that the plot moves too slowly. But these moments don't happen that often. Not everyone will like the picture and in fact many will be unable to appreciate the humor and find most of the movie plain dumb. However, overall, this is a great movie to watch if you've seen a lot of 1950s sci-fi mutant/creature type movies and have a good sense of humor.",1111536000,37,2902,4.596525096525096

Made for an inconceivably paltry $40,000 and change, ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"" is a spoof of all those low budget sci-fi monster movies that played on double bills (usually in drive-ins) in the 1950's.  Many of those films achieved renewed life on Creature Features-type TV shows during the 1960's and 1970's, and eventually ended up as fodder for ridicule on ""Mystery Science Theater 3000.""  Filmed in glorious black and white, ""Skeleton"" tells the tale of a scientist and his wife who head to the mountains to locate a recently landed meteorite out of which he hopes to extract a rare and precious element known as ""atmosphereum""  (though no one can explain, with any degree of specificity, what it is exactly that the precious element does).  At the same time, two outer space aliens land in the forest near where the couple is staying and accidentally unleash one of those infamous rubberized mutants into the area, who proceeds to terrorize the local citizenry and carry the heroine off in a gesture of interspecies romantic attachment.  Finally, we have the mysterious Lost Skeleton of Cadavra itself which has been left lying dormant in a cave just waiting for someone to bring it the atmosphereum it needs to put some get-up-and-go into it.

Given the sheer silliness of the premise, I wish I could say that I liked ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"" more than I did.  For one thing, the movie does a beautiful job capturing the look, sound and overall ambiance of the films it is parodying, and, for that, director Larry Blamire and cinematographer Kevin F. Jones deserve hearty praise.  In addition to the black and white photography, the film captures with perfect fidelity the atrocious costuming and chintzy special effects that served as the hallmarks of that benighted genre.

The problem, however, is that once the style has been established, Blamire, as the film's writer, doesn't seem to know quite what to do with it.  Although the deliberately flat and corny dialogue and the arch mannerisms of the actors are amusing for awhile, after about the first fifteen minutes or so, we get the point and want the film to move on.  We laugh the first time we hear the scientist declare generically, ""I've come out here to do science,"" but after about the third time around, the joke loses its freshness.  The film also does an effective job satirizing gender roles in the 1950's as well as the preposterous way in which sci-fi movies from that time period used generic-sounding terms to make themselves appear to be scientifically literate.  Again, all that is funny at first, but it wears thin very quickly.  Indeed, from past experience we've discovered that this sort of movie genre parody seems to work best in small doses; when it is dragged out to the extent of a full length feature film, it overstays its welcome.

This is not to denigrate the actors who have a blast hamming it up for the camera, and I do really appreciate what it is the makers of ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"" are trying to do.  The problem is that it's never very easy to make good movies out of bad, and this film, once the novelty of it has worn off, becomes just about as unendurable as the movies it is parodying.  Perhaps the filmmakers fell victim to that old conundrum of trying to make fun of something that is already laughable to begin with.

Any moviemaker who can produce something even halfway decent out of little more than baling wire and a shoestring budget deserves our admiration and support.

Instead, we have Fay Masterson and Jennifer Blaire, both of them prettier than Ms. Witherspoon and far better qualified to play Becky Sharp.  Neither of them does that here, as there is no extant version of VANITY FAIR that includes space aliens, evil skeletons, or women made from four different types of forest animals.

THAT story was written by Larry Blamire, who also directed and co-starred.  He plays Ms. Masterson's earnest-scientist husband (and she plays his pert-twit of a wife).  Ms. Blaire plays the lady of the animals, sometimes known as Animala, and to us lesser beings as Pammy Yaber, wife of one Rudolph Yaber, who is really Dr. Roger Fleming (evil scientist in plaid flannel shirt), who is looking for Atmosphereum to revive the dreadful Lost Skeleton of Cadavra, who has some vague plan for Taking Over The World.

Furthermore, Blamire wraps his farce in the clothing of a bad 50's sci-fi programmer, complete with canned music, plank-stiff performances (deliberately in this case, making the goofy things the people say and do that much funnier), bad camera work, and Bronson Canyon, where if you listen very carefully, you can still hear John Agar's manic laugh from BRAIN FROM PLANET AROUS --chilling no doubt, but never as terrifying as the sound of Our Reece murdering Shakespeare in LOVE'S LABOURS LOST--a crime for which Federal Law says she can be shot . . .",1106006400,4,2287,4.934895833333333

Pity that this movie only played in limited release, as it's better than most of what's out there these days. Larry Blamire has created an oddly nostalgic parody of fifties B-horror films, shot using many of the same locations they used, with props bought from eBay (according to IMDB), a budget of under a hundred thousand dollars (according to the DVD extras), and a fantastic cast who, as we are reminded both on the box and almost everywhere else, had to work really hard at being this bad.

The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra revolves around ""that most rare of radioactive materials-- atmospherium!"" A scientist, Dr. Paul Anderson (director Larry Blamire) and his wife Betty (the ethereally gorgeous Fay Masterson, recently in Paparazzi) have come out to the country to find a meter made of atmospherium that crashed to Earth. At the same time, another scientist, Roger Fleming (Brian Howe of The Majestic and Catch me If You Can), stumbles upon the lost skeleton of Cadavra, who's still sentient and requires atmospherium to physically rise from the grave. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, a spaceship from the planet Marva, crewed by Kro-Bar (Donnie Brasco's Andrew Parks) and his wife Lattis (newcomer Susan McConnell), have crashed to Earth, and in order to repair the spaceship, they need, you guessed it, atmospherium. It's not nearly as comlpex as it sounds; after all, it's a fifties B-movie. Actually, it's a 2001 B-movie, but there's nothing at all about this flick that will make you think it was filmed after 1959 save the DVD extras.

The script is abominably bad, but like all those abominably bad fifties B-movie scripts, contains so many quotable lines you'll be zinging one-liners from it well into the next decade. The acting tries to be terrible, and for the most part succeeds, though there are a few places where you can tell these actors are actually far better than the actors they're portraying. The effects are truly hideous, with (intentional) visible guide wires, spaceship detritus looted from old radios, and the like.

I am flabbergasted that so many customers are giving glowing reviews to this painfully witless and humorless film. It does boast some nice touches, such as B&W photography, authentic locations, and a very goofy monster designed by noted SF artist Cortney Skinner. However, Director Larry Blamire's decision to handle the writing himself destroys what might have been an amusing outing for genre fans. TLSOC resembles a SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE sketch that isn't quite working, except that it lasts 89 minutes instead of 5. Nearly every attempt at a joke falls flat SEVERAL times, and, though the actors seem game, they can't do much with this lame material. By the way: where are the homages to all of those lovable schlockfests of yore? In Joe Dante's films, that's where... Nope, I'm sorry, but this long-time genre fan cannot recommend TLSOC, and could not, even if its price were cut in half. In the special material (much of which outshines the main feature), Larry Blamire speaks of plans for another similar film, so to him I say: You're just not funny, that's all.

Blamire understood the conventions and faults of this odd genre, and he masterfully (and intentionally) wove these into this spoof film.  The scientist making general pronouncement about science, the Barbie Doll wife who becomes Beauty to the ET Beast, the evil scientist (like Raiders of the Lost Ark's Belloque), the confused aliens that come to an understanding.  It's all there.

The discontinuities are intentional.  The bad special effects are intentional.  Being a parody, all of this ENHANCES  the film. The visible wires on the skeleton are perfect.  And being an independent film, Blamire could film this in ""black and white,"" which makes the parody complete.

The only problem is that the film is a bit too cluttered. When he introduced the aliens, I thought tat there was too much going on for a film.  To his credit, Blamire managed to know all of the threads together.  Also the pacing could have been quicker.  However, but supercharging this film, he makes it a ""one dose"" parody.

I suspect he's a boomer like myself and his Horror/Sci-fi send-up is a real valentine to all those terrible, no-budget films that scared the hell out of us in the 50's and 60's. In keeping with the genre, ""lost Skeleton.."" was filmed in 11 days for around $100,000 which would have been $11,000 in 1958. Trust me every penny of it was put into the catering budget. The rest of the movie was an afterthought. There are moments of absolute lunacy that put me on the floor laughing including Aliens trying to walk up steps for the first time, a dinner scene with Aliens and a Cat/badger/mouse women eating for the first time and the possesed dance sequences.

2053273,4,B00020HAY2,"There are bad movies and there are so-bad-they're-good movies.  In the `50s and `60s, there were a lot of these latter sorts to be found in that subgenre of film know as the monster movie.  Poorly written, with special effects that were not very special, they had often had a perfect combination of earnest seriousness and complete cheesiness that made them somehow amusing on an unintended level.  The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra is a largely successful attempt to deliberately make one of these ""bad"" movies.

The story deals with a scientist and his wife who have gone to a remote cabin while searching for a meteor filled with ""atmospherium,"" an extremely rare element with wonderful properties.  Meanwhile, an alien spacecraft makes a forced landing nearby; the occupants need atmospherium to refuel their ship; they also need to retrieve their pet mutant, who has escaped and is now mutilating people.  Finally, there is the mad scientist who needs the atmospherium to resurrect the Lost Skeleton of Cadavra, who - when reanimated - will be able to take over the world.

Everything, from the opening credits to the final ""The End?"" is played straight as if this really were an old-time monster movie.  Most of the time this is pretty clever and amusing, although at times, it wears a little thin, like one of those Saturday Night Live sketches that runs a bit too long.  Overall, however, this is a fun movie - a solid four stars - and if you enjoy good parody, this is a recommended film.",1096502400,3,1492,4.77431906614786

Bless the shoestring film-makers of this world; what they make can bring such joy to us mere mortals.  Movies like The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra are so wonderfully kooky, one cannot help but smile at them.  Watching it, I was reminded of being a little child.  On Saturday afternoons, the local public television/UHF station would play cheap old monster movies.  Though most of the ones they showed were Japanese, the spirit of these movies was the same as that which infuses their Anerican counterparts; the idea that with a camera or two, some starving actors, some fishing line, an inexpensive location, a little makeup and spirit gum, and a rubber suit, one could make a movie.  Critics, take note; it is this attitude which spawned more ""sophisticated"" fare, like Clerks and Resovoir Dogs.

I would watch these Z-movies movies with my Dad, and we would fall over ourselves laughing, mocking the hammy acting on the screen.  Interestingly, Lost Skeleton does not do this -- at least, not the way I did when I was four.  Instead of winking at the camera and really overdoing it, the film-makers play it all entirely straight, which makes it that much funnier.  This is the reason why I don't find a lot of parodies (particularly Scary Movie) funny; they make their subject matter look stupid.  It is a far, far better (and more difficult) thing to pay humorous homage to a film genre by not poking fun at it, but instead laughing along with the genre's existing audience.  Evil Dead II does it; George Lucas in Love does it; Not Another Teen Movie......does not do it............

To say much about the plot would spoil the fun, but you can expect a stalwart scientist (played by writer/director Larry Blamire) and his wife, two ""aliens... from outer space"" and thier pet mutant (with prerequisite bad costume), an evil scientist (with a great evil laugh!) and his beautiful assistant created from forrest animals, and the evil Skeleton.

Unfortunately, THE LOST SKELETON falls rather short as an authentic re-creation of classic low-budget thrillers. The editing is too sophisticated; scenes that should have been presented as tedious medium shots are presented in a series of cross-cut closeups. The dialog (especially the Skeleton's) contains too much contemporary slang to be credible. Character names are obviously corny; no self-respecting director, not even one of modest talent and questionable taste, would ever call a major character ""Kro-Bar.""
