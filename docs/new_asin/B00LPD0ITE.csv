6498334,5,B00LPD0ITE,"An original and insightful take into a doomsday scenario that could be all too real.  The film is a low-budget production but takes you on journey with characters who find their world turned upside down in the moments after a cyber-Pearl Harbor.  Dealing with issues of family, loyalty, and our reliance on modern technology for all aspects of our lives, the story moves from the beginning and never lets up the tension till its unexpected conclusion.  For those of us who grew up in the 80s under the Cold War and enjoyed films like War Games and Red Dawn, this movie will have great appeal reflecting the updated geopolitical and technological threats.",1414022400,7,654,4.821428571428571
6498335,2,B00LPD0ITE,It reminded me of the foreign nation invades the US movies of the 80s.  Just as bad!,1479168000,,84,3.9411764705882355
6498336,3,B00LPD0ITE,Plot wanders all over the place.,1474243200,,32,4.5
6498337,1,B00LPD0ITE,This movie does not work! So I ordered from another company I hope it works.,1471478400,,76,4.133333333333334
6498338,3,B00LPD0ITE,Okay but not worth paying for. Would rather wait for it to appear on Netflix. The writer makes some valid points so it's worth your time to watch.,1470960000,,146,4.25
6498339,5,B00LPD0ITE,liked it so much that i accidentally bought it twice. although the picture quality was like watching it from an old VHS copy,1467072000,,124,4.434782608695652

6498342,5,B00LPD0ITE,Excellent movie..... It is so close to what is happening right now. Scary true..,1456531200,2,80,4.785714285714286
6498343,2,B00LPD0ITE,"Decent Story line.  Could have been a good movie.  You can overcome bad acting with good writing or vise versa, but when you have bad acting and bad writing you can't save it.  I'm more than a little tired of movies that portray law enforcement and the military as being sadistic idiots and anyone not from here as the hero.  Its the same kind of outlook that has brought this country to the place it is in.  If we don't wake up soon it will be too late.",1454284800,,454,4.113636363636363
6498344,4,B00LPD0ITE,"...Boo hiss & give me a break for the rest.
The technical scenario didn't seem at all far-fetched. The human scenario had me rolling my eyes.",1449532800,,141,4.461538461538462
6498345,3,B00LPD0ITE,In this world we live in that is all dependant upon Hi Tech gadgets and electric power to keep us alive this movie will definitely get you to thinking about just how fast we would fall without it!! Watch it and you will never leave your home without cash again believe me!!!,1449100800,2,274,4.288461538461538

6498347,3,B00LPD0ITE,This is why I'm a prepper. .,1438214400,,28,3.142857142857143
6498348,2,B00LPD0ITE,"Not a bad premise, but a very bad movie.  Very low-budget flick, so don't expect much.  Not very realistic in many ways, in terms of the ""survival strategy"" that the various characters adopt.

Fundamental premise (SPOILER ALERT) is that Chinese-made electronics are the real danger.  So, EMP-like scenario without the EMP or CME.

Really, for the price, not a very smart buy.  I don't recommend, and I've read a LOT in this genre",1436918400,3,429,4.808219178082192
6498349,3,B00LPD0ITE,It's was okay,1435449600,,13,3.6666666666666665
6498350,1,B00LPD0ITE,"Awful. I had heard that I should expect a ""low-budget"" product on this one, and I was prepared for that. However, the acting was so horrible, I could feel my toes curling up in my shoes. Had to stop watching 1/2 way through. Even for diehard fans of SHTF and TEOTWAWKI, my suggestion is: don't bother.",1427932800,4,301,4.392857142857143
6498351,3,B00LPD0ITE,Scary movie can this China hacking occur?,1424822400,,41,5.0
6498352,5,B00LPD0ITE,This movie is something that could happen....it's a movie that makes you think about our future...it's worth watching,1417737600,,117,5.555555555555555
6498353,2,B00LPD0ITE,Interesting concept. Not well written,1415664000,,37,6.6
6498354,1,B00LPD0ITE,"A real stinker, don't waste your time on this one.  I'd give it less than one star if they had that option.  Not one redeeming feature, bad plot (with ludicrous plot holes to boot), bad acting, and bad production values. This isn't even a B movie, it's an F minus.",1414886400,,264,4.26
8667628,5,B00LPD0ITE,I like low budget movies in general. This one was actually a good one imo.,1506470400,,74,4.0
8667629,1,B00LPD0ITE,Better to play tic tac tow vs yourself than watch this movie.,1505088000,,61,4.166666666666667

8667634,3,B00LPD0ITE,Its OK,1485907200,,6,2.5
8667635,4,B00LPD0ITE,One that makes you think and at the end makes you uneasy. Shows the new EW war and expands on it.,1483315200,,97,3.6666666666666665
8667636,5,B00LPD0ITE,One of the scariest movies I have seen. I have watched it several times.,1481414400,,72,4.214285714285714
