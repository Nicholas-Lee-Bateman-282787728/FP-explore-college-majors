8038370,1,B00064AEUQ,Just terrible and not worth the money.  The fights are horrible and the fighters have very little skill.  Puchase PRIDE instead where the best fighters in the WORLD come to fight.,1152576000,,179,4.741935483870968
8038371,1,B00064AEUQ,"The only thing that could have possibly saved ufc 50 would have been if the original main event of Mezger/Ortiz had actually taken place.  Instead the ufc decided to put in some no-name Canadian 185lbs fighter to take his place.  In typical Tito-like fashion, he takes the Canadian down and lays on him for 3 rounds.  The only bright side on an otherwise dull night is the St Pierre vs Matt Hughes fight.  But one fight is not anywhere near good enough to save this night from total and complete disaster.

Pride FC is the top organization in the world.  Sadly, as can be seen from this event, the UFC is far behind.",1152403200,,616,4.407079646017699
8038372,5,B00064AEUQ,"If you love UFC, you will love this DVD. Ortiz vs Cote, and Hughes vs St. Pierre for the UFC Middleweight belt. (note Hughes had lost to B.J. Penn and is now trying to get it back). Lots of great matches on the undercard. This DVD will not disappoint.",1151625600,,251,4.142857142857143
8038373,4,B00064AEUQ,"The War of 04'.  We see Rich Franklin continue on his path to a title shot.  He is truly a well-rounded mixed martial artist. Matt Hughes v. George St. Pierre was an interesting fight.  It appeared as though the fight was being dictated by St. Pierre.  He gave Matt Hughes all he could handle before making a costly error.

Ivan Salaverry impresses me once again.  He is the kind of fighter who lets the flow of the fight dictate how he will defeat his opponent.  He doesn't simply come in and impose his will.  He lets his opponent choose a style and then finishes him in that style - he's very scrappy and talented.  Evan Tanner, the ever-underrated warrior, shows us that experience and poise can prevail over raw talent and brute strength when he faces off with Ruthless Robbie Lawler.

Cheruto Verissimo v. Frank Trigg is another good fight.  Here we had two of the top contenders going at it.  They are quite equally matched but, in the end, raw power is the deciding factor.

In the main event, Tito Ortiz takes on no-name Patrick Cote, who replaced Guy Metzger due to an injury. Every single fight on the card that night was more interesting than this one. Nothing noteworthy from either side - just plain boring.

As an aside, we get commentary throughout from Heavyweight Champion Frank Mir, who does a very good job, in my opinion.",1142899200,4,1342,4.560669456066946
8038374,4,B00064AEUQ,"This was a mixed bag of killer fights and so-so fights. Matt Hughes vs. George St. Pierre is something that must be seen... easily the two best in that weight class in the world (in my opinion anyway). Many people thought that the main event was not great because Tito was supposedly meant to walk through Cote. Hate to say it folks, but you can't fault Ortiz for fighting somebody that is just too damned tough to quit. Good show... a must own. Buy it!",1139788800,,453,4.341176470588235
8038375,3,B00064AEUQ,"I always enjoy UFC cards, but this one wasn't particularly good.  The Tito Ortiz fight was extremely one sided.  Patrick Cote didn't belong in the ring with him because he was unable to get out from under him or defend against the ground and pound.  It isn't terribly interesting to watch Ortiz elbow Cote in the head.

The one unique thing I saw in this card was that two of the fights ended in the exact same arm bar.  It was the second jiu jitsu move I ever learned, after the America lock, and it was ridiculous when one of the announcers said that it was a very advanced jiu jitsu move, not one of the basics.  It is the second move on the Craig Kukuk-Renzo Gracie tapes, and it was executed exactly that way, both times, in UFC 50, at championship level.

The announcing seems a bit dumb at times.  The announcer was giving an example of an extreme underdog actually winning a fight, and the example he chose was Rocky.  As in ... duhhhh ... that wasn't real .... duhhhh.

Another dopy thing one of the announcers did was explain that Matt Hughes had successfully defended his welterweight title five times and then lost it, but was fighting to regain it.

What's wrong with that?  He didn't tell who Hughes lost it to, or why the title was now vacant.  Another ""duhhhh"" moment.

I really like mixed martial arts.  It is so much more interesting than boxing.  There's so much more you can do, so many more ways you can win.  And it is a lot more effective for self defense.  It is simply a better sport, period, as far as I'm concerned.  Boxing is like hitting the same five notes on a piano over and over.  Let's see, there's the jab, the right cross, the left hook, the uppercut.  Now what will we do.  How about another jab.  Gee wasn't that interesting.

It's nice to see Tito Ortiz growing up and not acting like an immature punk for a change.  He showed a lot of class when he complimented Canadian fighters, since his Canadian opponent Patrick Cote seemed to have some issues with that.  Contrast that to the stupid things Matt Hughes said about Canadian fighters being weak.  Matt Hughes is a sensational fighter, but he is a bit of a load as a person.  Maybe one day he will mature the way Tito Ortiz did.  Tito used to be worse than Matt is now, and that's saying a lot.",1129420800,2,2286,4.33806146572104
8038376,4,B00064AEUQ,"First off, I would like to say that I agree with everyone who says ufc is better than boxing, because even if a ufc main event doesn't deliver (like this one) the rest of the fight will. Fights are on a 5-point rating.

WARNING - Don't read if you don't want to know the ending of some fights

Marvin Eastman vs. Travis Lutter - much like the ufc 47 liddell/ortiz fight, this one has the two competitors sizing each other up for the first round, then 30 seconds into the 2nd round lutter steps in with a ferocious punch and puts down eastman.  2/5 due to the first round, +1 for the ko

Ivan Salaverry vs. Tony Frykland - this one is pretty horrible, all salaverry did was keep frykland on the ground in painful holds until frykland finally taps, and it takes frykland like 5 minutes to get up - 1/5

Evan Tanner vs. Robbie Lawler - experience vs. youth once again, tanner's a really good fighter and lawler is a hothead, just when you think lawler is about to put the hurtin' on tanner, tanner reaches up and bends lawler's arm back and forces him to tap, listen to what lawler says after tanner gets done hugging him, pretty good fight - 3/5

Frank Trigg vs. Renato Verissimo - this fight is pretty good, but it's also pretty one-sided trigg really puts the hurtin' on verissimo referre stops it, due to the amount of elbows verissimo was taking - 3/5

Matt Hughes vs. Georges St. Pierre - Welterweight Championship - hughes' fights are always really fun to watch, this is a pretty even fight, with an ending that could've been preventable if pierre would've blocked more this fight could have gone 25, but instead went 5, ends at the very end of round 1, great sportsmanship by pierre - 4/5

Rich Franklin vs. Jorge Rivera - this one is kinda sloppy, and almost goes the distance the puerto rican is wearing red, white, and blue trunks which is odd, Franklin ends it with a tap - 2/5

Main Event: Tito Ortiz vs. Patrick Cote - this one would've been alot better if mezger hadn't got hurt, what we get instead is a 15 minute ground and pound session courtesy of the ""huntington beach bad boy"" no one gives this fight credit, because it doesn't deserve it, ortiz is even pissed at how bad it was - 2/5",1111795200,8,2202,4.364303178484108
8038377,4,B00064AEUQ,"This one is ok. The Main Event was one sided because Tito fought a guy that was supposed to be on the undercard, due to Guy Metzger getting hurt or sick. The rest of the fights are pretty good, with none of them going the distance. Matt Hughes' fight was fun to watch, like usual. Its worth buying if you like quick fights.",1110067200,,323,4.142857142857143
