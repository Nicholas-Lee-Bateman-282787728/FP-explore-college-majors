--------------------------------------------------

Included in the ""TNA Anthology: The Epic Set"" box set are the following three pay-per-views:

* Victory Road 2004 (November 7, 2004) [TNA's first three-hour PPV]
* Turning Point 2004 (December 5, 2004) [TNA's second three-hour PPV]
* Lockdown 2005 (April 24, 2005) [TNA's first all-steel cage PPV]

Each PPV is split across two single-layer discs, as this was before TNA started using dual-layer discs.  I'm not very found of this, as I prefer for each event to be shown as one continuous three-hour program, but there's nothing us fans could do about it now.  TNA isn't going to re-release new DVDs of these old PPVs.  So we just have to live with the minor inconvenience of ejecting one disc and inserting another into the player to watch each event.  Bonus features are on the second disc of each PPV, in case you were wondering.

You should be aware that if you buy this set online, the three Disc 1's MIGHT be loose in the cases.  The first box set I ordered from Amazon had the first and third Disc 1's loose (Turning Point was the one that stayed put), while the second box set had all three Disc 1's loose.  All of the loose discs were scratched as a result of being loose and moving around while being shipped.  I had to return the first set because the scratches caused glitches when playing one of the discs.  The scratches on the second set looked bad, but thankfully the discs played fine.

There are lots of reviews of the three PPV's that cover the matches and give you the reviewer's opinions on them.  So I'm not going to say anything about that - though I did enjoy all of the matches, some a little more than others - rather I'm going to go into detail about the alterations that exist in the DVDs, when compared to the original live broadcasts.

I don't have the original live broadcasts of Victory Road 2004 and Turning Point 2004, so I don't know for sure if there are any alterations, but there *might* be in the Michael Shane (now Matt Bentley) matches.  You see, all instances of the name ""Michael Shane"" in commentary and on-screen graphics had to be changed to ""Matt Bentley"" for legal reasons.  This is because in July 2005, Matt Bentley was forced to refrain from using the ""Michael Shane"" alias, which he had used for his entire career, following threats of legal action from World Wrestling Entertainment, the employers of Mike Shane (one of the Gymini twins at the time), who had trademarked his name, something Bentley had neglected to do.

Bentley appears in the Victory Road 2004 PPV in the battle royale on Disc 1 (Chapter 2). He enters at 12:42 and is eliminated around 27:57. Bentley's match in the Turning Point 2004 PPV is on Disc 1 (Chapter 3) from 21:54 to 35:30.  In all likelihood, he originally used the name Michael Shane at these two events, so the commentary was probably re-recorded on the DVDs.

Now, the Lockdown 2005 PPV is one I have on tape, so I can give you complete details as to what was altered.  In fact, Lockdown 2005 was the first 3-hour TNA PPV I ever ordered, and the only one until Hardcore Justice 2010.

DISC 1
======
-- The 10-second long ""This is TNA: The new face of professional wrestling"" intro, which preceded the live program, has been removed from the DVD.

-- For legal reasons (the name was already copyrighted by another wrestler, then working for WWE), the wrestler known as ""Michael Shane"" had to have all instances of his name changed to ""Matt Bentley"".  The first alteration is in the video package that precedes the match, where a screen that read ""Shane"", now reads ""Bentley"".  When Michael/Matt comes out for the match, the graphic shown at the bottom of the screen was changed from ""Michael Shane"" to ""Matt Bentley w/ Trinity"".  The biggest change is that the commentary from Don West and Mike Tenay has been completely changed (re-recorded) for the entire match.  It's interesting to note that the name ""Michael Shane"" still appears on the entrance video playing in the background when he makes his entrance, and you can still hear the ring announcer announce him as ""Michael Shane"" behind the commentary at 40:17.

-- The Daniels/Skipper video package (which is the last footage on Disc 1) that precedes their match was much longer in the original live broadcast.  It stayed on the shot of the team on the entrance ramp longer, then followed for a minute or two with more footage and narration, before showing the black & white Turning Point footage.  The DVD cuts from a brief bit of the entrance ramp opening footage right to the Turning Point footage.

DISC 2
======
-- For legal reasons (WWE claimed copyright ownership), the wrestler known as ""The Outlaw"" had to have all instances of his name blurred or silenced out, with the name changed to ""Kip James"" on the DVD packaging and new commentary.  The first alteration is in the backstage segment with Dusty Rhodes where he picks the name of the next Lethal Lottery combatant.  He picks ""The Outlaw"", but the words are silenced out, thus leaving DVD viewers in the dark as to who just got picked (unless they could read Dusty's lips).  In the video package that follows the Dusty segment, a few instances of ""The Outlaw"" are silenced out.  The name ""Outlaw"" is blurred out on the pre-match line-up screen.  Finally, the commentary from Don West and Mike Tenay has been completely changed (re-recorded) for the entire match.

-- The DVD cuts out the Hard Justice 2005 ad at the end, originally shown on the live broadcast in between the end of the Styles/Abyss match and the TNA copyright ending.

The Lockdown 2005 DVD is dedicated to Chris Candido, who broke his leg at the live event, which lead to the post-surgery blood clot that caused his death four days later on April 28, 2005.  Since I did the research, I'd like to give you some information about the Chris Candido bonus features.

CHRIS CANDIDO BONUS FEATURE NOTES
=================================
-- The first match - Chris Candido and The Naturals (Chase Stevens & Andy Douglas) vs. Petey Williams (with Scott D'Amore), Elix Skipper, and Mikey Batts - was from the March 4, 2005 episode of Impact!

-- The second match - The Naturals (with Chris Candido) vs. America's Most Wanted (Lance Storm & Chris Harris) - was taped on April 26, 2005, and aired on the April 29, 2005 episode of Impact! on Fox Sports Net.  This episode was filmed and completed just before he passed away, but was dedicated to Chris with a photographic ""In Memory of Chris Candido"" screen at the start, and a photographic ""Chris Candido, 1972-2005"" screen at the end.  This was his final wrestling appearance.

-- The Xplosion outtakes were filmed about two weeks before he died, according to Jeremy Borash's exclusive comments on the Forever Hardcore DVD-R (which includes the same footage in chapter 42 of the main program - it's not on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/retail-DVD/dp/B0009YA3QI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">retail DVD</a>).  According to Borash, he was bandaged up and in a wheelchair because he was working an angle where he was supposedly injured as a result of getting beat up by Kevin Nash.

Since I taped the April 29, 2005 episode of Impact!, in which the second Candido match originally appeared, here are some notes on the differences between the original broadcast and the DVD.

* The original broadcast had a ""Tag Team Championship"" graphic over the initial close-up of the lights.

* The original broadcast had an ""Impact!"" on-screen graphic at the bottom of the screen naming each competitor as they entered: ""The Naturals, Chris Candido"" and ""America's Most Wanted"".

* The original broadcast had a 30 minute countdown banner across the top of the screen (with ""The Naturals vs AMW"" on the left and the Fox Sport Net logo on the right) for the entire match duration.  This is the ""Fox Box"" that Mike Tenay refers to at 9:27.

* In the original broadcast, 3 times during the match the Lockdown results would appear in a banner at the bottom of the screen.

* In the original broadcast from 17:10 to 17:17 there was a white banner at the top of the screen (right below the countdown banner) advertising the following month's Hard Justice pay-per-view.  It was accompanied by a sound effect when it appeared and disappeared, which is still heard on the DVD!

* The original broadcast at 18:30 there was a quick shot of a crowd member holding a nice AMW sign, which is missing from the DVD as it remains on the shot of the action that preceded and followed this crowd shot.

* In the original broadcast from 19:21 to 19:29 there was a small Hard Justice logo in the bottom right corner of the screen advertising the following month's pay-per-view.

* In the original broadcast from 21:26 to 21:32 there was a white banner at the top of the screen (right below the countdown banner) advertising the Jeff Jarrett vs. AJ Styles match on May 15th (at the Hard Justice PPV).  It was accompanied by a sound effect when it appeared and disappeared, which is still heard on the DVD!

* In the original broadcast, after the post-match comments, there was a replay of a shot of Candido on the floor by the side of the ring holding the belts, while Tenay's voiceover mentioned the matches for next week's show.  This was immediately followed by another Candido tribute screen which used a frame from that belt-holding shot.

And that concludes this analysis of the alterations between the original broadcasts and the DVDs.  The two biggest alterations in the Lockdown 2005 event are the result of legal name changes, so while I don't like the changes, I can't blame TNA for them.  Though I do think it's sad they let WWE claim copyright ownership of ""The Outlaw"" without fighting it.  There's no reason TNA should have left out the ""This is TNA"" intro (it's on the other two PPVs), and shorten down the Daniels/Skipper video package, as there was PLENTY of room for those extra few minutes on the disc.  So that's not forgivable.  And I only mentioned the removal of the Hard Justice 2005 ad at the end just to be complete.  That's definitely no great loss.

The changes to the Impact! match featuring The Naturals (with Chris Candido) vs. America's Most Wanted are, for the most part, completely welcome.  Watching the original tape from 2005, it was really sad that Fox Sports Net (FSN) forced TNA to put up that stupid countdown banner across the top of the screen for the entirety of the match.  Like anybody really cares about time limits anymore in wrestling.  The constant banner ads for the next PPV and scrolling Lockdown results on the bottom just added to the screen clutter.  So I'm happy that all of that crud is gone on the DVD.  Though I do find it funny that the PPV banner ad sound effect is still there.  I don't like that TNA removed the ""Tag Team Championship"" graphic and entrance name graphics as they added to the presentation.  That initial close-up of the lights looks naked without the graphic over it. I still don't know what to make of the removal of the quick shot of the crowd member holding the AMW sign.  The sign had a really nice drawing on it, and was certainly worth showing a quick shot of.  It's not like there was any real action going on in the match for those 3 or 4 seconds, anyway.",1285200000,,11969,4.8379970544918995
8114671,5,B000EVFSB6,"You may think to yourself that $9.98 for 3 DVD's, can't be good PPV's, right? Well you would be wrong! Let's look at what sticks out. Turning Point has the Elix Skipper walk of doom on top of the  steel cage, that people still talk about. Lockdown has AJ vs. Abyss, wth my personal favorite moments of AJ coming out of nowhere and and front flipping through the cage door to Abyss on the floor, as well as the sick cage door to the face of AJ. TNA really knows how to do their discs right, and they are a pretty good deal for all the discs I own. This 3 disc set is well worth the price, even if you're not a TNA loyal fan. Because if you're not a fan now, you will be by the end of all 3 discs. I'm out!",1282521600,,704,3.8551724137931034
8114672,5,B000EVFSB6,"This is my first TNA dvd I bought and a nice induction to TNA wrestling, I originally bought this set back in 2005 or 2006. I have first watched some episodes of TNA back in 2004 on Fox Sports Net, it was refreshing to see something different for a change. Anyway this is a great set of DVDs and it has hours of wrestling.

highlights from the DVDs:

*Victory Road 2004-

-20 man X Division gauntlet match- great match

-(NWA Tag Team champions)Team Canada Vs. 3 Live Crew- pretty good tag match

-(Monster's Ball)Monty Brown Vs. Abyss Vs. Raven- I'm a big fan of Raven so I enjoyed this match

-(X-Division champion)Petty Williams Vs. AJ Styles- good, but Scott Hall made it worse

-(Last Man Standing)America's Most Wanted Vs. Triple X- one of the greatest tag team matches Ive seen, a must see match!

-ladder match(NWA heavyweight champion)Jeff Jerrett Vs. Jeff Hardy- A nice main event ladder match to end this great PPV DVD. Kevin Nash and Scott Hall also reunite too.

*Turning Point 2004-

-(NWA Tag Team champions)3 Live Crew Vs. Team Canada- another great match from TNA

-Hector Garza, Sonjay Dutt, Sonny Siaki Vs. Matt Bentley, Kid Kash, Kazarian- I'm a big fan of most of guys in this match so this was awesome for me

-Serengeti Survival Match: Monty Brown vs. Abyss- great match with hardcore elements in this match
-Johnny B Badd and Pat Kenney Vs. Johnny Swinger and Glenn Gilberti(Jacqueline as the Special Referee- alright, but not that good

-Diamond Dallas Page(DDP)Vs. Raven- again, as a fan of Raven I enjoy most matches with him in it

-(X Division Champion)Petey Williams vs. Chris Sabin- great high flying action, this is what TNA is about!

-AJ Styles, Macho Man Randy Savage, and Jeff Hardy Vs. The Kings of Wrestling (Jeff Jarrett, Hall and Nash)- It's a good match except for the bad ending & the fact that Savage didn't show up until the end of the match, I wanted to see more of the Macho Man.

-(Six Sides of Steel)America's Most Wanted vs. Triple X- This is a awesome match, recommended for any wrestling fan, great hard fight until the end. They had one of the greatest feuds in pro wrestling!

*LockDown 2005- all matches are in the six sides of steel

-Sonny Siaki and Apolo Vs. Chris Candido and Lance Hoyt- The match would of been good except for Candido broke his ankle or leg so the match got kind of messed up.

-2 Out Of 3 Falls:(Prince Of Darkness Match)Dustin Rhodes vs. Robert Rude- kind of a boring match

-Ultimate Xscape Match: Shocker vs. Matt Bentley (with Trinity) vs. Chris Sabin vs. Sonjay Dutt- exciting X Division match, I wish TNA did more of these, its a great match!

-Table Match: Jeff Hardy vs. Raven- I'm a fan of both wrestlers so this match was awesome as hell, TNA was hardcore when Raven was involved!

-(Tag Team Champions)America's Most Wanted vs. Team Canada(Eric Young and Petey Williams)- AMW was a great tag team so this is a great tag match up

-(X Division Champion)Christopher Daniels vs. Elix Skipper- after Triple X spit Daniels and Skipper had a feud, this was a nice high flyer match

-(Lethal Lockdown Match)B.G. James, DDP and Sean Waltman, vs. Jeff Jarrett, Kip James and Monty Brown- This is
the first Lethal Lockdown match, great match with some amazing moments.
-AJ Styles vs. Abyss- solid match

I recommend this TNA anthology pack for every wrestling fan not just TNA fans! TNA need more feuds like the ones on these DVDs. They really need to bring back X Division like the good old days, I like TNA don't get wrong but the older stuff like 2005-2006 is unbeatable.",1274313600,,3552,4.626794258373206

TNA Anthology: The Epic Set
The Epic Set contains three TNA events. They are TNA's first two 3-Hour PPVs, Turning Point 2004 and Victory Road 2004, and TNA's first ever all Steel Cage PPV, Lockdown 2005. I'm not going to give match-by-match reviews, as you would hate reading all of that. I'll give you a quick summary of the event instead. Go to my profile for a Match-by-Match Review.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TNA-Victory-Road-04/dp/B000F6QEAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TNA Victory Road 04</a>
Victory Road was TNA's first 3-Hour PPV. Sadly, this one is the worst in this set. I gave it 3 Stars in my full review of this DVD. The strong points are: the opening 20 Man X Gauntlet, the X-Division Title Match, and Hardy/Jarrett for the NWA Title. Last Team Standing was an extreme disappointment considering the other amazing matches that these teams have had. The Mini's match and Monster's Ball were both fairly entertaining, but nothing worth a second watch. The rest of the event isn't very good at all.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TNA-Turning-Point-2004-Destiny-Awaits/dp/B000G38AWG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TNA Turning Point 2004 Destiny Awaits!</a>
This was TNA's second 3-Hour PPV and it was quite a step up. I gave this one 4 stars. The strong points have to be: The X-Division Championship match, DPP/Raven, and the 6-Man tag match before the Main Event. The Six Sides of Steel match between AMW and Triple X is one of my favorite matches of all time and would be considered the match of this entire set. The rest of the event is passable.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tna-Lockdown-2005/dp/B000ES14I0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tna Lockdown 2005</a>
This is another DVD that gains 4 stars. This was the first ever all Steel Cage PPV event. The opening match features Chris Candido breaking his leg, an injury that would go on to cause his death. The only thing truly bad on this DVD is the blindfold match between Dustin Rhodes and Roode. Everything else is very enjoyable to watch. Raven and Jeff Hardy put on a great Tables match. Lethal Lockdown and the Xscape Match were fun to watch. The Main Event between AJ Styles and Abyss was the show stealer and you will never forget it. The rest of the show is good and fun to watch.",1212105600,2,2747,5.293577981651376
8114674,3,B000EVFSB6,"TNA is a great company. It features some great wrestlers but ive never really found out where TNA hit there stride. The one point that I got away from TNA is that the X-Division is what people watch TNA for. Other then that, the company is just like WWE. Send the hate my way but its true. The only highlights of these ppvs in this set are the x-division matches. The stars in TNA at the time included DDP, Raven, Jeff Jarrett, Kevin Nash, and Scott Hall. WCW reunion anyone? If you like watching Jarrett hog the spotlight with the title along with Nash and Hall, then this might be for you. Granted they had Jeff Hardy but TNA did nothing for him. They do have a nice tribute to the late Chris Candido as well. Here is some pros and cons of TNA

PRO:

X-Division- The only reason why to watch TNA. The rest of TNA is like WWE.

Impact: Free tv tapings in Orlando. Worth checking out.

TNA Shop: Don West's insane deals are always worth checking out. I got this set and the entire 2005 PPV series for 60 bucks. Cannot beat that. Also sold mostly every dvd for five bucks at one time.

Samoa Joe: Greatest wrestler in the world today...perhaps

Cons:

Samoa Joe: While he is the greatest wrestler today, he is also the bigger loser. He loses all the title matches, teamed with Kevin Nash, and TNA really hasn't given this guy much.

Abyss: Using the Kane forumla for this guy. Ive seen his matches and if you've seen, then you probably saw them all.

Rhino: Just like in WWE, this guy is given nothing to do. Granted he did win the world title for a very brief run but he is only suited for hardcore matches. Even in those matches, he always loses. I loved the street fight with Christian in his home town, where he loses. The crowd looks stunned. I guess this guy will never get anywheres.

Booker T: Too early to tell but it looks like he is just anther midcarder. After the big hype surrounding his arrival, he is thrust into a feud against Robert Roode. Wow.

Christian Cage: He signed a contract and got his world title. He held it twice. Then Sting and Kurt Angle signed, now he's just anther face in TNA.

TNA shop: The sale of 5 dollar dvds was awesome. Paying almost 12 bucks for shipping was not.

Kurt Angle: Biggest Problem with TNA today. He signed with TNA got the belt (a perk a former WWE employee gets when he signs with TNA it seems) and is on Impact at least an hour out of two hours. Way to much Angle these days, even though he is one of the greatest wrestlers today. Enough is enough.

AJ Styles: From Phenomenal to a loser. Too bad TNA is not using his talents for a better reason other then comic relief. He can still wrestle a great match though.

X-Division: The only reason to watch TNA is now gone from TNA. Sure they still have the title but the division looks like WWE cruiserweight division right now.

Former WWE Stars: Andrew Martin, Relik, Black Reign, Kishi, Animal, Mr. Backlund, Scott Hall, Spike Dudley. None of these men equal ratings but still got paid. A couple are still on the roster. Plus it really makes TNA look bad signing a former WWE star and making him beat a top TNA star. Why not let a TNA star beat a WWE star for once? It'd make TNA look on par with WWE. Think about it.

Matches: The Gauntlet and King of The Mountain matches sound cool. Then hearing Tenay and West run down the rules and you've got a headache.

Heart to Heart with Mike Tenay: Tenay will sit down with a superstar and give a heart to heart interview about something. Rhino's drinking problem for instance. Sure its ok to do once in awhile but it seems Tenay wants to be more like Dr. Phil these days then be in wrestling.

There are a few other cons but don't get me wrong, TNA is can still a great company. Too bad right now they are stuck in WCW 2000 mode.",1199750400,3,3780,4.26890756302521
8114675,5,B000EVFSB6,"I'm gonna go ahead and say that when I heard Nash was coming back to wrestling I was thrilled. I remember it was October '04 when I saw the preview for Victory Road. Nash's last PPV was Summerslam in August 2003.
I had already come to accept that Big Daddy Cool was done. This dvd set holds the beginning of the Powerbomber's golden days in TNA. Beginning with Victory Road (11/7/2004) and Turning Point (12/5/2004). It also holds the end of Big Sexy's comeback with Lockdown (4/24/2005), the PPV he originally was set to wrestle in, but had to drop out of. Following Lockdown '05, Nash left TNA for 6 months. He returned in the first episode of Impact, October 1st 2005. I don't understand why the set jumps from Turning Point to Lockdown. The 3 best Nash TNA PPVs go in between: Final Resolution (1/16/2005) where he teams up with DDP to take on Monty Brown, Against All Odds (2/13/2005) his first one-on-one match in TNA - against champion Jeff Jarrett, and Destination X (3/13/2005) where he battles Kip James - the guy that cost him the championship. Lockdown's coolest feature, is a small segment in which Nash stumbles across a scuffle behind the scenes. The other 2 are great to watch specially if you're an Outsider/NWO fan. Hall and Nash really are brothers in the ring. Nash is doing the usual in Turning Point: saving Scott Hall from opponents he can't handle. In the conclusion of Turning Point the Kings of Wrestling (Nash, Hall and Jarrett) are ridiculously defeated by Macho Man Randy Savage. I recommend the moment you see Savage enter the ring, just remove the dvd from your player and pop in Final Resolution '05 (that's if you bought it). Everything pre-Savage is worthy of watching over and over again. Victory Road is great for Nash's small encounter with B.G. James and A.J. Styles. This saga is better watched chronologically, Once I received the trilogy I watched Victory Road and Turning Point back to back. I didn't watch Lockdown until I had already obtained Final Resolution, Against All Odds and Destination X. Its a really good storyline they came up with here, pitting Nash against Jarrett during Final Resolution after the 2 were buddies in the PPVs prior to that. To all Mr. Jacknife fans, these PPVs are a gift from the wrestling Gods, as I personally never thought I'd see a powerbomb again after WWE Summerslam '03. I thought watching Big Sexy beat the crap out of Frank Castle (Thomas ""The Punisher"" Jane) was gonna be the last great simulated battle royale courtesy of Diesel. Who knows if another Victory Road '04 can come again, Nash and Angle are beginning to turn on each other and his contract is almost over...
  -TL",1190419200,,2661,4.69593147751606
8114676,5,B000EVFSB6,"Like other reviewers have said this is a great way to introduce yourself to TNA wrestling (plus the 50 Greatest Moments in TNA is as well).

There are 3-Discs in this set, Victory Road '04 (TNA's first 3-hour PPV), Turning Point '04 (TNA's second PPV) and Lockdown '05 (Wrestling's first all steel cage PPV).

-Victory Road '04: A good PPV overall with a few standout matches.

-A great opening video package showing how TNA has grown, featuring some of it's best stars. Great voiceover too, very dramatic.

-The 20 Man International X-Division Gautlet: The rules are that two men start out, every 60 seconds, elimination occurs when a wrestler is thrown over the top rope to the floor. When there are two men left then the winner will be decided by pinfall or submission. The list of wrestlers include X-Division stars Sonjay Dutt, Kazarian, Puma, L.A. Park, Jerelle Clark, Myamoto, Matt Bentley, Hector Garza, Nosawa, Mikey Batts, Alex Shelley, Matt Sydal, Sonny Siaki, Jason Cross, Shark Boy, Psicosis, D-Ray 3000, The Amazing Red, Spanky and Chris Sabin.

-There's tons of great high flying moves, including a standing moonsault by Sydal on Shelley, while he was standing on Shelley's back and a twoer of doom super-super plex with eight wrestlers involved. It comes down to Hector Garza and Kazarian who was the first guy in the ring. After some great near falls and top rope moves by both men, including Garza hitting a great moonsault for a close near fall. The action between just these two would be worthy of a PPV match. Garza wins after reversing a roll up on Kazarian in about 26 minutes, a great match. 11/10.

-There was a Director of Authority (D.O.A.) election thing of sorts going on between Dusty Rhodes & Vince Russo. This was to determine who would get to run TNA. This was done mainly because Russo was leaving TNA. Basic promo thing here, supporting Rhodes.

-8 Man Tag Team Match: The Naturals, Kid Kash and Dallas vs. Ron ""The Truth"" Killings, Johnny B. Badd, Erik Watts and ""The Empire Saint"" Pat Kenney: Lots of guys in this one, not as much as the gautlet though. A good but short tag match that was helped by the crowd being so into it. Badd looked pretty good (sorry couldn't help myself there) after not being on T.V. wrestling for a few years prior to this match. There were some nice arm drags by Badd on both Kash and Andy Douglas. Loved the face off between Watts and Dallas, nice power moves, a chokeslam by Watts and a sideslam by Dallas. The action breaks down as all eight men get in the ring and the finish comes when Badd hits the bad mood hurricarana on Chase Stevens then Killings hits a variation of a pedigree on Stevens for the win in about 5 minutes. 8/10.

-The Monster's Ball: Abyss vs. Raven vs. Monty Brown. Great hardcore match with loved the thumbtack spot with Abyss and the pounce by Brown on Raven through a table. 9/10.

The Good:

-Last Man Standing Match: Triple X vs. America's Most Wanted. Hard hitting match, not as good as their other matches, but better than most mathces that other rivalries ever had at their peaks. 8/10.

-AJ Styles vs. Petey Williams for the X-Division Championship: Could've been spectacular but something seemed to be lacking, still good though, sick finish with the Canadian Destroyer on AJ from Petey. 7/10.

The Bad:

-The Jeff Hardy vs. Jeff Jarrett Ladder match, just wasn't too good and the run-ins by Hall made it sort of obvious who would win.

-Almost everything else, not that the performers didn't try, but the rest of the matches were lacking something interesting.

Overall, Victory Road was a decent show, just not great. 7/10.

Turning Point '04: Better main event than Victory Road '04, but about as good of a PPV.

The Best:

-The Six Sides of Steel Cage: XXX vs. AMW, losing team must disband. What a great match, tons of blood, great high spots and one of the sickest moves of the top of the cage by Elix Skipper that I've ever seen. Probably one of the greatest main events on PPV as well as on the greatest tag team and steel cage matches I've ever seen. 10/10.

The Good:

-Serengeti Survival: Monty Brown vs. Abyss: Great hardcore match, loved the thumbtack spot where Abyss gets his head slammed onto the tacks. 9/10.

The Bad:

-The finish of the Jeff Jarrett, Scott Hall, Kevin Nash vs. AJ Styles, Jeff Hardy and Randy Savage 6-man match: The match itself wasn't that bad, AJ and Hardy put on a good performance but the appearance of Savage at the end and horrible looking sitdown pinfall on Jarrett, really took away from the whole thing, in my opinion.

The rest of the card ranged from okay to good, but those are the standout moments to me. 8/10.

Lockdown '05: Great idea, better execution than expected. Thought the concept sounded rather repetitive, but TNA pulled it off.

The Best:

-AJ Styles vs. Abyss, fantastic cage match, tons of great spots in and out of the cage. Really liked the sunset flip powerbomb by AJ that threw Abyss of the top rope into some tacks (speaking of repetitive.) 10/10.

-X-Division Xscape Match: Shocker vs. Matt Bentley vs. Sonjay Dutt vs. Chris Sabin: High flying cage match that saw many great moves, but the sickest had to be Trinity doing a moonsault from the top of the cage onto everyone. 9/10.

The Good:

-Jeff Hardy vs. Raven: Great idea for a tables match in a cage, gave the possibility for there to be sicker high spots, which didn't exactly happen. The finish was nice though, Hardy stacked Raven on four tables and dived off the top of the cage onto Raven to pick up the win. 8/10

-Lethal Lockdown: DDP, Sean Waltman and BG James vs. Jeff Jarrett, Monty Brown and Kip James: Good cage match, and good use of weapons. Nothing leaps out as wow, but nothing horrible. 7/10.

The Bad:

-The rest of the card is okay to decent, though the Chris Candido moment where he breaks his leg in the first match, will make you cringe.

I loved the fact that the put some Chris Candido moments as extras on the second lockdown disc, including a six-man tag match with Candido & The Naturals vs. Petey Williams, Mikey Batts and Elix Skipper, the tag team match on Impact when Candido helped the Naturals win the tag team titles from AMW, and lastly where Chris hosts Xpolsion (TNA's syndicated T.V. show).

This is a great PPV put on by TNA, there are some okay matches but there are some outstanding moments that make it worth watching.

Overall this 3-Disc set is well worth buying, for about $25-30.",1166918400,8,6452,4.605240174672489
8114677,3,B000EVFSB6,"This set was the 3 disc set that included the first two monthly TNA PPV's (Victory Road & Turning Point '04) and the first all steel caged PPV (Lockdown '05).  This was basically during the ""Dusty Rhodes"" booking era so there's alot of hits & misses.

Victory Road:
20 Man X Division Gauntlet (Royal Rumble style match) - Hit
Note: Also available on the ""Best Of The X Division Vol. 1"" DVD

Ron Killings, Johnny B. Badd (Marc Mero), Pat Kennedy (Simon Diamond), Erik Watts vs. The Naturals, Kid Kash & Dallas (Lance Hoyt) - Would have been a miss if the crowd wasn't so into it.

Mascratita Sagrada vs. Piratita Morgan - Midget match.  You'll either like this one or hate this one.

NWA Tag Team Champions Team Canada vs. 3 Live Cru - Crowd was really into it so it's a hit.

Trinity vs. Jacqueline - Miss

Monster's Ball: Monty Brown vs. Raven vs. Abyss - Hit but not as violent as anticipated.
Note: Also available on the ""Best Of The Bloodiest Brawls"" DVD

X-Division Champion Petey Williams vs. AJ Styles - Normally I would say hit but too much interference from Scott Demore so it's a miss.
Note: Also available on the ""Best Of The X Division"" DVD

Last Team Standing Match: America's Most Wanted vs. Triple X - Hit.

Ladder Match: NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jeff Jarrett vs. Jeff Hardy - Hit and the match of the night.  Look for the Outsiders reunion here.
Note: Also available on the ""Enigma: Best Of Jeff Hardy"" DVD

Turning Point:
NWA Tag Team Champions 3 Live Cru vs. Team Canada - Hit

Sonjay Dutt, Hector Garza, Sonny Siaki vs. Kid Kash, Matt Bentley, Frankie Kazarian - Hit

Serengeti Survival Match: Monty Brown vs. Abyss - Hit

Pat Kenney & Johnny B. Badd vs. Glenn Gilberti (Disco Infernio) & Johnny Swinger with a Jacqueline as the Special Referee - Miss is an understatement, this is a dud.

Diamond Dallas Page defeated Raven - Hit

X-Division Champion Petey Williams vs. Chris Sabin - Hit

Macho Man Randy Savage, AJ Styles, & Jeff Hardy defeated The Kings of Wrestling (Jeff Jarrett, Kevin Nash, & Scott Hall) - It's a hit except for the crappy ending & the fact that Savage didn't show up until the last min. of the match.
Note: Also available on the Jeff Hardy DVD

Six Sides of Steel: America's Most Wanted vs. Triple X - To say this match is a hit would be the ultimate understatement.
Note: Also available on the ""Best Of The Bloodiest Brawls"" DVD

Also they did backstage skits revolving around ""Vince McMahon"" & ""Triple H"" looking for the tape of an incident when the WWE was at Universal Studios filming a commercial for the WWE Royal Rumble '05 and TNA wrestlers invaded the catering area with one wrestler coming out (Rey Mysterio eventhough his face is blured, you can recognize is tattoos) just to say hi to his friend Konnan.

Lockdown '05
Apolo & Sonny Siaki vs. Lance Hoyt & Chris Candido - Dud only because the first minute is when Candido broke his ankle due to one of the guys (can't remember if it's Siako or Apolo) fell on it after a dropkick.

2 Out Of 3 Falls ""Prince Of Darkness Match"": Dustin Rhodes vs. Bobby Rude - Dud.

Ultimate Xscape Match: Shocker vs. Matt Bentley (with Trinity) vs. Chris Sabin vs. Sonjay Dutt - Hit
Note: Also available on the ""Best Of The X Division"" DVD

Table Match: Jeff Hardy vs. Raven - Hit
Note: Also available on the Jeff Hardy DVD

Tag Team Champions America's Most Wanted vs. Team Canada (Petey Williams & Eric Young) - Hit

X Division Champion Christopher Daniels vs. Primetime Elix Skipper - Hit

Lethal Lockdown Match: DDP, Sean Waltman, B.G. James vs. Jeff Jarrett, Monty Brown, Kip James - Hit

AJ Styles vs. Abyss - Hit
Note: Also available on the ""Best Of The Bloodiest Brawls"" DVD

There's also the Chris Candido tribute which is a six tag tag team match from IMPACT (don't remember everyone involved right now); The Naturals with Candido facing America's Most Wanted for the tag team titles; and his last TV appearence co-hosting TNA Xplosion.

Normally I would say just get the Lockdown PPV since the best matches from the other two are on other TNA DVD's but since your getting 3 for the price of 1 or 2...I recommend.",1142035200,8,4114,4.518918918918919
