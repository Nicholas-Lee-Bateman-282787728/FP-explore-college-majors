8108039,5,B000EBCECC,I bought this as a gift for my brother after buying one for myself because it's so good.  If you're into gorilla art this doc is a must watch.,1375401600,,142,3.896551724137931
8108040,5,B000EBCECC,"Although, I don't agree with all the things Ron English does or has to say (and some of the pieces seem provocative only for the sake of being provacative, devoid of a message - or maybe I'm missing the point on some of his works), I found this film (as well as much of the artist's work) to be wonderfully though-provoking and also quite inspiring. This, to me, is the real purpose of art.

I also really enjoyed learning about some of Mr. English's early photography work, which are the sorts of things you could look at for hours, wondering how it was done - very cool.

I would recommend this movie to Spurlock fans who enjoyed Super Size Me, as Ron's work played a role in that film. I would also recommend this to artists, art-students, and persons interested in social activism. Some people may get their blood-pressure up, thinking of all the ways they disagree with Mr. English's messages or methodologies, even if you hate everything Mr. English does you may still find value in this film. I would not recommend this movie to people who are typically bored by documentaries.",1253836800,,1084,4.61139896373057
8108041,5,B000EBCECC,"Ron English is a prodigious, prolific, and courageous artist who has risked serious criminal penalties to tweak corporate America, the government, religion, and the art world with his guerilla billboards and works on canvas.  I greatly enjoyed this film, which showcases a wide variety of his work and has an enjoyable soundtrack.  His satires of Thomas Kinkade paintings made me fall off my couch laughing.  The film also documents some interesting collaborations with a number of other artists (performance and visual) and the musician Daniel Johnston.  Like many brilliant iconoclasts, he appears at times to be struggling to cling to the verge of sanity and to maintain his family life, but this may be the price one pays for surfing the cutting edge of popular culture.  A particularly fun feature was the little tutorial at the end on how to get away with putting up guerilla billboards -- try this at home, folks!",1220140800,,920,4.9869281045751634
8108042,4,B000EBCECC,"I was apathetic about Ron English's artwork before I saw this movie. And I didn't know very much about his billboard art. I appreciated the technical skill and surface appeal of the paintings but I didn't get the message, in fact I thought they were a little frivolous. Seeing the movie gave me a greater respect and appreciation for his work and his message. Now I am such a believer in his work that I recommend this movie to people. It does drag a little towards the end when the subject turns to his ""fine art"" career. The street/billboard art is just more exciting as a doc subject and also as art, in some ways. Still this is an excellent introduction to the world of this great artist. And it's also good to use in an art class (of ""mature"" students) as an example of political/activist and lowbrow/pop/popsurrealism etc.",1194912000,3,828,4.563758389261745
8108043,3,B000EBCECC,"Ron English looks somewhat like musician David A. Stewart, especially on the cover of the Eurythmics' 1986 album ""Revenge.""  He performs and creates a kamikaze art in which he pastes political art over paid billboards.  This almost seems like a happening from the 1960s as putting up the art is just as important as the message or style in the art.  Mr. English shows that he admires others who produce similar, borderline-illegal work.  He's even served jail time for expressing himself in this fashion.

I loved learning about this artist and I wish him well.  Still, I'm skeptical in many regards.  At one point, he positions himself as being against gallery art.  He seems completely self-interested and desirous of displaying his works, regardless of the price.  This work is gushy and could have benefited from non-supportive interviewees.  One of Mr. English's main targets is McDonald's and their fatty foods.  However, unlike the lead in ""Super Size Me,"" who was thin, Mr. English looks like a gourmand.  This reminds me of how Jay Leno takes Dr. Phil to task on demanding that others lose weight.  The work implies that Mr. English only quit his outlaw art when his wife complained on a talk show.  Basquiat damaged others' property too while making a name for himself, but there's still something unethical about what English is trying to accomplish.

Hollywood cranks out a ton of remakes.  Some say Shakespeare refashioned many old ideas.  Ron English too constantly reworks things that are already invented.  To some, that's edgy and creative, but some may find it boring and parasitic.  He even created a three-eyed creature that, to me, looks like a rip-off of the alien doll from Tom Hanks' ""Toy Story"" series.  Most people may associate pop art with artists who had minority desires, such as Warhol or Haring.  Like Koons and Lichtenstein, Mr. English has the desires of the majority population.  I am surprised that spray painting on buildings and trains isn't brought up, as they present the same ethical, legal, aesthetic, and political issues.

In watching this, I kept comparing English to Haring.  English covers political work that is relatively safe.  Who would disagree that smoking and fast food are problems?  Haring was fighting apartheid, homophobia, and all kinds of issues that had or have the world greatly divided.  When I saw English's working with objects in ""Guernica,"" I immediately thought back to a Haring biography in which Haring was upset that renegades damaged the original ""Guernica.""

This work includes profanity and nudity.  I could imagine it being shown in college art classes, but not in art classes at lower educational levels.",1180915200,2,2680,5.041002277904328
