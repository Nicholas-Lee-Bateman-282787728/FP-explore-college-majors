8594317,2,B00DLX764Q,"I was disappointed.  There wasn't anything in this movie that you couldn't see on any daytime soap.  Screaming, arguing and disension.",1398643200,,134,5.333333333333333
8594318,3,B00DLX764Q,"In terms of texture, this film tends to ""one-note.""  For some that may prove to be a bit tedious--that was the case for me. Also, the use of the interview as a device to, I guess, propel or explain more fully the inner thoughts of the siblings, seemed a bit contrived. I believe a film should 'show' and not 'tell'. If the story is properly scripted, you don't need a contrived device to do the work. After all, isn't that the whole beauty of film. Thankfully, we are introduced to more than one family and more than one type of sibling relationship. Sibling relationships--in all their variations--are very challenging and the film does a good job at showing that. Nonetheless, I was compelled to keep watching because of some really good acting. With the exception of Mr. Monteith's posthumous performance, the other players bring credible acting technique to their roles. Though I must say, Mr. Monteith's ending monologue in the film has an eerie prescience and portent that conjures the phrase 'art imitating life.' I'm not sure why there is an emphasis on sibling actors in the film, but two of the four sibling pairs, are either 'popular' or 'struggling' actors. Perhaps it is the obvious separation that fame and wealth can bring between family members. The film brings a rather sanitized resolution to the whole sibling relationship challenge, which may be for some, a bit Pollyanna. In reality, sibling relationships do not always end well; there is no kiss-and-makeup for some, perhaps many, siblings. Decades of dysfunction characterized by abuse (emotional and physical), dishonesty, substance abuse and just the day-to-day effort to survive in this world, renders some siblings impotent to forgive and forget. Regardless, the pain never goes away.",1391040000,2,1761,5.051546391752577
8594319,4,B00DLX764Q,"Which is a compliment.  Indian half sisters, schizophrenic brothers and the isolation of fame all get a gentle Canadian touch.  Not preachy or overly schmaltzy - just lighthearted insights.  I really enjoyed it and found myself in several of the characters.  It was a bit bizarre hearing Justin, the Cory Monteith character, speak of his ""Mont-entourage'.",1387929600,,355,5.285714285714286
8594320,2,B00DLX764Q,"Rented it because of Cory from Glee was in it. I figured it would be ok and I would give it a try. The concept and flow were good, but the acting was sub par.
Save yourself time by not wasting it on this video.",1379894400,6,210,3.688888888888889
