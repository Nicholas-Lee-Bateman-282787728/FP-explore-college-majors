8230123,4,B000XXWKDE,"Glass Fleet is the story Michel and Cleo trying to free the galaxy from the tyranny of the empire. It's kinda like star wars. If Darth Vader were gay and had braids there wouldn't be much difference. There a lot of interesting characters in this anime. There is a good mix of action and drama. The most impressive aspects of this anime are the animation quality and the space battles. It's a unique anime series and there aren't too many other series that are all that similar. I really enjoyed watching this anime. As I said the characters are the best part of Glass Fleet. The bad guy is so bad that you'll wanna fight him yourself, and the heroes will make you wanna strap up and go to bat with them. Overall Glass Fleet is a solid anime. I'd say that my only complaint is the sick little pervert that always follows Vetti, the bad guy, around everywhere. He's pretty sickening. Glass Fleet will probably be a good addition to your collection. It's not a bad price either.",1355270400,,975,4.4525139664804465
8230124,4,B000XXWKDE,"Besides the recap episode which serves as mostly a waste it would seem, this volume did a fabulous job of resparking my interest in the story and characters. While audiences may not find themselves rushing out to purchase and view the next volume, there is more than enough here to create a healthy level of curiosity towards what Michel plans to do next and what Vetti has up his sleeve as well. If you've been on the fence about this series in the past, this may be the volume that tips you one way or the other.",1215561600,,514,4.309278350515464
