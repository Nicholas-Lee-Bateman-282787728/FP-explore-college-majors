8275191,5,B0019T0JAW,Shurik's adventures are slapstick comedy for all ages. Another great film with nicely done subtitles. For every Russian who grew up in these times and all their friends.,1392681600,,169,5.071428571428571
8275192,5,B0019T0JAW,"This DVD has it all! Not only is the movie a great classic, but you get several biographies and interviews with the director and actors (and actress!) as bonus features, with all kinds of interesting background info.  Also, as you would expect, you can select the language you hear and the language of the subtitles, and of course you can turn them off altogether, as well.  But it's perfect for an American trying to learn Russian, and very entertaining at the same time!",1363564800,2,472,4.674698795180723
8275193,5,B0019T0JAW,My Ukrainian girlfriend introduced me to this movie. Now one of my favorites. Shurik is hilarious! It helps to have an understanding of Soviet history/culture to really understand the jokes in this.,1361923200,,198,5.21875
8275194,5,B0019T0JAW,"four wonderful russian comedies by the great leonid gaidai are available here with english titles. though russian comedy doesnt'travel well, gaidai's works do. there is much mack sennett in his world.
kidnapping caucasian style is a wonderful way to start as the characters are all enjoyable and the director brings out their best. if you like it check out the other three gaidai films and enjoy. the russians can make clean, enjoyable comedies. a great shame the director is unknown in the west!",1339459200,,496,4.9879518072289155
8275195,5,B0019T0JAW,"An anthropology student Shurik goes to the Caucasus' region to collect the toasts (cheers) peculiar for the region, known for its long standing wine culture, hospitality and sense of humor.

On the way to his project he meets a cute komsomolka who turns out to be the niece of a driver of the powerful towns' chief - Secretary of Raikomitet (something like a mayor or a governor). The aging mountain wolf needs a wife, and he arranges for his driver a fare exchange - his niece, in exchange for a number of cattle plus a Finnish refrigirator - an expensive rarity at the time. When the niece refuses, the chief with an aid of his driver decides to use an age-old method - stealing the girl, who when brought into her husband's-to-be territory should supposedly become submissive and become a perfect Caucasian wife. In order to accomplish that task, the chief decides to use naive Shurik to capture the girl under the pretense of learning an old custom which should make his project especially meaningful. Shurik of course happily concurs - after all its a once a lifetime opportunity!

To make sure that the crime goes just as planned, the chief's driver hires three crooks - the infamous Fatso, the Drunk, and the Coward - respectively played by Morgunov, Nikulin, and Vitzin. Crime goes wrong when Shurik realizes that he just partook not in the old custom, but in the actual stealing!

A late-Soviet classic, known to every Russian speaker, this comedy has touched and keeps touching hearts of at least 3 generations of movie goers. I just hope that the kids keep diggin' it.",1256083200,6,1579,4.734545454545454
