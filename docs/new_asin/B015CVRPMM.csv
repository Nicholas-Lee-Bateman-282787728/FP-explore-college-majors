7432510,5,B015CVRPMM,"Brothers Tyrone (Chris Paul) and Craig (Marlon Ladd) are zombie hunters who are separated from their sister Gretchen (Kelly Edwards). Their goal is to kill zombies and get back to her in the back roads outside of Oklahoma City. They meet their cousin Daniel (Kenneth Nolan) who has a zombie girlfriend chained up because we all know zombie sex is the best sex...for the first few days anyway. The film is a satire of other zombie films. In one scene we see fires that are haphazardly burning in places you wouldn't expect and reasons unknown. Mario (Phillip Borghee) has a basketball made up with a face, spoofing ""Wilson"" in ""Castaway."" In many ways this was a modern blaxplotation film with Cara Black taking the place of Pam Grier. The brothers fight and argue like a married couple, the funniest aspect of the film and in the middle of it all, they have a Michael Jackson dance off with a sound track that includes only a few riffs of ""Billy Jean"" apparently due to copyright and budget.

4 1/2 stars

Guide: F-word. Zombie sex. No nudity.

Note to self: In case of zombie outbreak, don't lay down and play dead.",1457308800,3,1116,4.597989949748744

I liked the choice of casting for the women leads because they looked like real women who would kick ass in a zombie apocalypse, not useless super models.  The brothers acted like real brothers.

7432515,3,B015CVRPMM,This is a fun and light-hearted little movie.

7432546,4,B015CVRPMM,"Shaun of the Dead showed that there was such a thing as a zombie comedy. Before that, zombies were considered strictly a horror genre, though George Romero always put n a little social satire. The result since Shaun is that with the notable exception of Zombieland, all of the attempts missed their mark and weren't funny. This one actually is. Bad To the Jones has been kicking around as internet webisodes here and there including You Tube. But now Amazon has picked up a consolidated version of the various episodes. They are loosely structured around two brothers's trek through a zombie infested Oklahoma to find their sister and see if she is OK. Along the way situations, both humorous and dangerous develop. The film doesn't really rate high as a zombie film, so if you're looking for lots of zombie action, try elsewhere. The zombie thing is the set up for the skits and the fact that they're truly funny and well acted makes up for the relatively small number of zombies. It could stand some editing. A few of the sketches go on a little too long. But overall this is a nice surprise.",1466208000,2,1094,4.615384615384615
7432547,5,B015CVRPMM,"It's a 5 star B movie, which to some people like me is a good thing.  The zombie makeup wasn't the best but it was good enough.  The jokes were not bad.",1466121600,,152,3.71875

7432553,3,B015CVRPMM,"Well, i'll keep it short and simple.
This is a low budget film. The production quality is pretty bad and if you came here for some big budget blockbuster, this won't be your cup of tea.
This wasn't a written masterpiece either. Don't expect a Stephen King novel in terms of screenplay.
What this does do is give you a pretty enjoyable zombie ride packed with action and humor.
I went into it with very low expectations(considering the list of zombie flicks available) and was pleasantly surprised. I probably wouldn't watch this a second time, but I sat through it the first time and enjoyed the experience.
I would recommend this, but only to someone who can look past the terrible production quality.
Go into this movie not expecting anything spectacular and I think you'll have fun!",1465344000,,785,4.737226277372263

7432562,3,B015CVRPMM,"An enjoyable low budget (not to be confused with no budget) comedic romp through the zombie apocalypse.  A dose of sibling rivalry, a Michael Jackson dance off, steroid zombies, and a mission to check on their sister, all while picking up a eclectic group of followers.  A  slightly different take on the zombie film since most of the people that aren't undead, are black--but they did throw in a token Mexican guy for good measure.",1464912000,,432,4.733333333333333
7432563,3,B015CVRPMM,"For a low budget flick it is surprisingly watchable if you ignore the fact that zombies have white face with a little blood around their mouths for the sum of its special effects.  Camera angles and movements I found to be especially effective at maximizing my interest.  It looks like it was actually shot by a pro with a decent camera instead of by a rookie with a tripod or Blair Witch style.  The comedy was a little thin and forced at time and the plot practically non-existent, but I didn't turn it off in disgust.",1464912000,,520,4.395833333333333
7432564,5,B015CVRPMM,"Ok yes this is a low budget movie but it is a great one. And just as others have said it is not a typical zombie movie.
