5049594,3,B0072DNDG6,acting was great...reminds me alot of ...the spy who came in from the cold.....  more suspense than action..a good sit,1403222400,,118,4.9
5049595,5,B0072DNDG6,This is a near perfect movie. Beautifully crafted and acted AND a great story. Curl up on your couch and let yourself be taken away. Watch and enjoy.,1400716800,,149,4.357142857142857
5049596,5,B0072DNDG6,"Personally, I still like the Alec Quiness version better.

 However, I realize that in this whirlwind world we live in, that shiny is better and keeps that short attention span... hey, eyes on the screen.

 This is an EXCELLENT FILM. The actors do a SUPERB job in their respective roles. Gary Oldham is wonderful as Smiley . Cumberbatch and Hardy are great as well.

 Hell, John le Carre is in it! ~~  Watch this version of a GREAT story if B&W fills with you dread and forboding.

~~  No really, you must watch it. ~~ It's a great retelling of a great spy novel. ~~

 Forgive me for that earlier part where I poked fun at you because I thought you wouldn't bother with something unless it was all covered in glitter and car crashes or semi-cute thirty-somethings playing teenage vampires and werewolves. It's not like you're with others right now and rudely reading this review upon a pocket telephone screen.

 **  A great story is re-told(covered) by a great cast. It's in color, just for you. **  That bit, was just me being smart-arsed.",1395705600,,1041,4.551351351351351
5049597,5,B0072DNDG6,An exciting cerebral adaptation of one of my favorite reads. The tones and nuance of the book were captured wonderfully.,1389225600,,120,5.05
5049598,5,B0072DNDG6,"This is simply beautifully done, compelling drama. It is a great screenplay from a great story by a great writer. All the acting is extraordinary, led by the extraordinary Gary Goldman.",1384214400,4,185,5.0
5049599,2,B0072DNDG6,"Slow and plodding script.  A lot of jumping around in order to make the ending impactful, which it wasn't.  Did not live up to the hype",1379721600,,135,4.153846153846154
5049600,4,B0072DNDG6,"Enjoyed, but purchased the book so that I could really understand what happened. Will watch it again.word word word word",1378166400,,120,5.05
5049601,3,B0072DNDG6,"The movie is excellent. Gary Oldman reprises and I think betters the earlier and excellent version with Alec Guinness in the lead. The rest of the cast is equally good. The movie does a wonderful job of capturing the mood and atmosphere created in the book along with the moral ambiguity of the spy service.

I would have rated the movie with 5 stars but because my HD laptop is not a compatible device with the Amazon HD service, I wound up watching the movie in standard definition. That was a mistake. The quality of the video in standard definition is not up to the task. Watch the movie in HD only.",1367366400,,603,4.383928571428571
5049602,4,B0072DNDG6,"The acting is impeccable. Gary Oldman completely disappears into the
role of Smiley; the voice, the walk, the tempo are all a unique
creation, a man who's strength comes from quiet, from watching, from
thinking, not from action. Rarely have we ever seen a movie hero this
passive. But this man is very actively passive. He may not move
physically, but his mind is racing like a computer. And Oldman is
surrounded by a top flight cast;; Colin Firth, Tom Hardy, John Hurt,
Ciaran Hinds, Benedict Cumberpatch, etc.

And the film is very well shot, delicately creating a dour world of beige
and brown mazes.

But in distilling a story this complex down to two hours, something got
a little lost for me. Smiley has to figure out who the mole in the
British secret service is. But with this much plot, and this little
time, we don't really get to know the suspects. So we watch and are
(intentionally) confused, and then answers start to emerge, and it's
all never less than interesting. But somehow it never crosses over into
the emotional or unshakably memorable either.

I loved Alfredson's 'Let the Right One In' for it's uncanny combination
of atmosphere, creepiness, intelligence and heart. For me, 'Tinker,
Tailor..."" has the first three, but lacks the last. Some of that is the
nature of LaCarre's work. But somehow I remember more moments, and more
feeling from the now 30+ year old TV adaptation. Paradoxically, by not
having to rush through a story this dense, there was room to really
feel and experience it, instead of just working to keep up with it.

But all that said, this is a refreshingly smart, adult, well-made and
challenging film in a world with far too few.",1328745600,,1675,4.706484641638225

5049605,5,B0072DNDG6,I absolutely love spy movies and this is definitely one of the best I've seen! Great acting by Gary Oldman!!,1427328000,,108,4.45
5049606,5,B0072DNDG6,"I watched Guiness do it over and over in the original BBC production...on PBS, on DVD, and there's no replacing Guiness. But this production is sharper, more economical, and dramatically and technically in a bigger league altogether. I saw it in theaters, I have the DVD, and I'm delighted to have it on Kindle. Others have reviewed the film far better than I can, but I'd like to compare one scene from the Oldman production to the original Guiness. .  The Guiness Smiley describes his interview with Karla, in India, in the 1950's, over dinner at a roadside restaurant, fueled by a little red wine, and we see the whole thing in flashback in an Indian prison cell. Oldman's Smiley invites Guillam up to his digs for a drink after Guillam has been grilled by the Circus top management. Tie and tongue loosened by drink and not a little fatigue, Oldman's Smiley acts out the 50's encounter from memory...as much to revive his own narrative and inspect a part of hispersonal  legacy as to inform Guillam...and it's superb. For me it was one of the best scenes in the film. I was deeply impressed with how much the story was compressed for the film without losing the spirit and intensity of the original, or the book (which I read when it came out). The soundtrack works beautifully as well. I'll be watching this for a long time!",1426636800,,1329,4.60337552742616
5049607,5,B0072DNDG6,I love this film (I've seen it multiple times - you have to if you want to catch it's detail and subtleties) but I suspect it's not for everyone. I lived and worked in Central and Eastern Europe in the seventies. This film captures the feel of the place and the times perfectly.  It's also a great rendition of the LeCarre novel (which I read when I lived in Europe).,1421107200,,367,4.242857142857143
5049608,5,B0072DNDG6,"Movies about spies are generally anything but subtle - for some reason, spy movies are action movies. This is not that.

Every scene, however, is significant. You look away for half a second, and you've missed some crucial detail.

""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" is quiet, careful, and demands your attention. It's what spy movies should be.",1420588800,,338,5.017857142857143
5049609,5,B0072DNDG6,"Excellent movie, and Gary Oldman played George Smiley quite to the tee.  Benedict C. also fantastic as was most of the cast.
Thanks to all.",1419292800,,139,4.56
5049610,4,B0072DNDG6,"Great Movie! Not much action, which is more realistic to the real world spy game, but the dialogue is excellent and character development does not lack. If you like clever spy movies, this is it!",1417478400,,195,4.6
5049611,5,B0072DNDG6,"If you are looking for a James Bond ""World is Not Enough' type spy film, stay away from this! If you want world class acting and a very well shot film, watch this!
The plot is slow moving and complicated and you have to pay attention to every sentence of dialogue.
The cast is first class and therefore the acting is superb. Gary Oldman is seriously overlooked when he is considered for Academy Award winning roles. He doesn't say much - in keeping with the Smiley character - but when he is on screen, you cannot look away. When he has to be forceful the men at the receiving end know they are in dire straits.
John Hurt, who is only onscreen for 5 minutes or so, is also fantastic. Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, Mark Strong, Tom Hardy... the list is endless and all performances are brilliant and flawless.
All the big wig main characters under suspicion are instantly unlikeable and in the same way, you root for the goodies, in their quiet unassuming way. Pay attention to the scene where Benedict Cumberbatch's character is hauled in in front of them and accused of consorting with the enemy. Outstanding.
5 stars for acting, cast, plot and for capturing the 70's so beautifully (without the aid of CGI).",1411344000,2,1214,4.599078341013825
5049612,1,B0072DNDG6,"The Alec Guiness version of ""Tinker, Tailor"" is one of my favorite British cinema pieces, and certainly one of the most engrossing spy stories I've ever seen.  So it is perhaps an emotional decision to say what I'm about to say, but:  I really hate this version of ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy.""

Beautifully shot, acted and staged, this film appears to have been written and directed by people with severe Attention Deficit Disorder.  It starts with no coherent explanation of what's going on, mystifying both newcomers and people already familiar with the story.  It leaps from the present to the past (and back) seemingly at random.  Indeed, we don't even find out that the film is set forty years in the past until about 20 minutes in, by which time someone trying to decipher the story from scratch would be hopelessly lost.

Important plot points, such as the initial Prideaux capture, Lacon's role in the story and Ricki Tarr's romance with Irina, are completely botched - indeed, many important plot points seemingly happen offscreen.  The ""big four,"" Alleline, Bland, Haydon and Esterhase, are given short shrift, and vast amounts of time that could have been spent advancing the story, or at least explaining it, are wasted watching elevators going up and down, office workers drinking, people weeping, and George Smiley (Gary Oldman, doing his best on a suicide mission) walking from place to place.  This movie could have been significantly improved by firing the director and scriptwriter and simply giving all the actors a copy of John LeCarre's novel.

I really wanted to like this movie.  I really did.  It pains me that it was this bad.  (It pains me even more that I bought it instead of renting it.)",1407628800,,1719,4.886206896551724

8508817,1,B0072DNDG6,This is a very pore remake of one of the best TV mini-series of all time.  Don't waste your time.

8508823,5,B0072DNDG6,"This spy movie for me replaces The Day of the Condor as the classic masterpiece of spy movies.  It comes close enough to The Good Shepherd to allow a comparison. The Good Shepherd is another film that explores the pensive, thoughtful, layered suspense aspect of the spy movie genre with little or no action, but a lot of intrigue and scheming.  I can't speak ill of The Good Shepherd, but Tinker, Tailor, Soldier Spy is just better.  It's the next classic spy movie, and I think my prediction will bear out over time.  We'll still probably be watching both twenty years from now, but I think this film will be seen as the paragon.",1477958400,,630,4.5
