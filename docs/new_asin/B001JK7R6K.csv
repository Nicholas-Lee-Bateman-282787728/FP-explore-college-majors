8313011,5,B001JK7R6K,"Super professional in depth meat and potatoes documentary. Its exceptional diligence like these fine works that takes the ""theory"" out of ""conspiracy theory,"" and presents more facts and shocking realizations than you'd ever imagine existed to rid the guess work. These are even masterpieces in presentation and execution. Great arrangement and organization. Also recommended: Greg Palast ""Bush: Family Fortunes"" and ""Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove."" Then watching anything by David Icke doesn't seem so far fetched and unbelievable. Not for the squeamish, but better to grow some balls now before the shit hits the fan, and be better prepared when the time comes and counts, which cannot be very much longer one way or another.",1353369600,,732,5.373913043478261
