4334730,5,B004DURSLM,"What a great buy!  In one package you can have some well made documentaries, covering many of the key UFO events.  Yes, some of these are older documentaries from I'd guess the mid to late 90s, but still well made and material is worth seeing.  If you like the UFO subject, this is a DVD set that I'd highly recommend.  I'd put this set up there with the Unsolved Mysteries UFO box set, and the Out of the Blue DVD, which are must haves if you like the subject.",1359244800,9,461,4.146067415730337
4334731,5,B004DURSLM,This is very informative. It exploits a lot of the presidental cover-ups from the 1940's. It's 6 hours of video. Good footage.,1311638400,4,126,4.7727272727272725
4334732,4,B004DURSLM,"This is a great idea by the History Channel: putting 10 documentaries (each are 45 minutes long) on one DVD set. The DVD set is not perfect but it's a great addition to a collection. Out of the 10 documentaries 8 of them are really good, while 2 of them are really horrible (UFO cults, UFOs of the 70's).

My Question is: Where is the ""Unexplained"" episode about Alien Abductions ?? This show was a classic and I don't understand why it's not included on this DVD set.

But this set is still very good, and at this price you can't go wrong. :)",1307491200,19,543,4.211538461538462
4334733,2,B004DURSLM,"I have been a huge follower of UFO's since I was a toddler, I am now 67 and hopefully far wiser.  However, back to the subject matter at hand.  I found this History Channel DVD on UFO's and Aliens to be very dated. In my opinion some of the sightings covered were lame at best, especially so since reading the hightly rated book UFO's: Generals, Pilots and Government Officials go On Record written by Leslie Kean.  Had I known before I bought this DVD that some of the material was quite old I wouldn't have bought it.  Then again I should have read the cover a little more carefully, as it does say Classics.  However, I must point out that their Ancient Aliens series is nothing less than outstanding, and I would recommend it highly to anyone.",1307404800,31,747,4.423357664233577

4334747,5,B004DURSLM,"I have enjoyed whether or not every think is true or not but it would be fascinating to find out if the American Government was keeping
 it's people in the dark, It would good to know if the Roswell event was an alien space craft and had alien bodies been found in the downed craft and have they still got them.",1378771200,,311,4.098360655737705

4334749,2,B004DURSLM,"The shows are your run of the mill escapism about aliens and other such phenomena.  Its the sort of thing we've been watching for years.  All in all, the programs themselves are well made and presented, however, the director is a die-hard fan of the shaky cam.  I can't bear to watch any of these shows for over a few minutes due to it.

The shaky-cam technique is used for every single shot.  Every single transition goes into a bob and weave with the camera before setting, momentarily, on something.  Even in interviews, the camera smears all over the place, never settling on the person speaking.  It is a clear example of shaky-cam abuse.  Who sits and talks to someone while bobbing and weaving their head and POV all over the place?",1375401600,9,739,4.545454545454546
4334750,2,B004DURSLM,"Nothing new here at all; very repetitive. Buy Ancient Aliens instead, it's a much better buy even if it costs more.",1363046400,2,115,4.523809523809524
