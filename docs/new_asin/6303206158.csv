608112,5,6303206158,"In 1979, Don Bluth, an animator known for his work at Disney Studios, broke with that company to start his own movie company. Though the films made through his company would never achieve box office success, his influence was obviously enormous to have landed such prominent talent for his efforts. This is demonstrated with the cast of this one, which includes Burt Reynolds, Loni Anderson, Dom DeLuise, and Vic Tayback. Charlie is a mutt of unknown pedigree that is murdered by his erst-while partner, Carface, when he escapes from prison. Vowing revenge on his former partner, Charlie returns from the dead and, discovering that the secret of his partner's success is an orphan girl who can talk to animals, he kidnaps the girl and begins a campaign to bankrupt Carface. However, complications arise when Charlie finds himself falling in love with the girl, and Carface repeatedly attempts to kill him again and steal the girl back. This has the usual Bluth formula of humor and tenderness, and an excellent score by the late Ralph Burns, who is also known for his work on 1979's ""All That Jazz."" The title song, ""Love Survives,"" is dedicated to Judith Barsi, who provided the voice for the orphan girl, Anne-Marie. She was murdered by her own father at the age of ten before the film was released.",1508976000,,1301,4.838565022421525
608113,1,6303206158,"Don't waste your money. This ""Blu-ray"" isn't a real blu-ray. There is no way this is HD. It might even be worse than the DVD. Terrible quality. Is this a fake blu-ray? Or did Fox really release this scam?",1508803200,,204,4.256410256410256

608206,4,6303206158,The little girl actually acts and sounds like a little girl. This movie has so many perfect imperfections. A real raw gem.,1507852800,,122,4.590909090909091
608207,3,6303206158,"I have fond memories of this from my childhood, so I was excited to show it to my daughter. She is two and a half. Not my brightest idea. I had no idea there were so many mature themes, such as gambling rackets, murder, torture, kidnapping orphans, intoxicated dogs, animal sacrifice, gang beating and hell and the devil. Thankfully by the end of the movie my daughter was bouncing on the couch singing ""You Can't Keep a Good Dog Down"". Hopefully she won't have nightmares tonight. Since I wasn't scarred by this movie, I'd say reserve it for older children and parents of toddlers be wiser than me!",1506124800,2,599,4.555555555555555
608208,5,6303206158,"A gangster breaks out of jail, heads back to a gambling den to pick up his dues, and ends up drugged and the victim of a gangland assassination by his former partner, all in the first twenty minutes.

All Dogs go to Heaven is a little strange for a 'Funny Talking Animals Film'.

 Fans of animation will watch Don Bluth do his magic at the height of his game, while children will honestly probably tune out all of the gambling, heisting, and duels of ego, instead just watching colorful animals do colorful things. It's hard to say who this film was made for: It's a crime story featuring dogs. It's an animated musical entirely about gambling and stealing and corrupting children. But Bluth keeps it so light and effortless that it all works (which separated it from, say, Cool World or Watership Down).

Effortless is a good description of the film, in the best way possible. Everything is smooth, silky, and natural. The actors have such natural rhythm, the colors blend together perfectly, and the film dances between themes of spirituality, loyalty, damnation, and sin with such even curves you won't notice them if you don't look. It's a magic trick, like all animation, but Bluth was always a Wizard at that. Take a watch, you'd be surprised what you can learn from a masters work.",1504137600,2,1288,4.685840707964601

That was really nice of Grounds for Thought to do! Thank you! Now I can just find an empty case for it. I thought I would have to print out the cover paper myself.

Now that I have a child of my own, I'm getting to rewatch all of these movies and see them through her eyes. The Bittersweet Story of All Dogs Go To Heaven, was just mature enough that it caused some interesting conversation around life and death with my child but it wasn't too overwhelming that it made her sad or negatively impacted her.

If our kids get to a point that that may be a possibility, I'm hoping this movie will open their mind to the idea and I'm hoping she might be relatable for them.

Like the other reviews said, the quality is about the same as it was on the VCR - it's not digitally remastered or anything.  I was happy with it anyway.  Once you've been watching it for a few minutes, you don't even think about it anymore.",1458086400,,629,3.8828125

608844,5,6303206158,"I watched this movie as a kid (90's baby) but never really could get myself into it. Growing up I was hooked on Disney and movies like this but when the animals died, I tended to shy away because they always left me a crying mess. This is one of those movies thats even better to watch as a teenager or adult because you can appreciate the humor a little more and even though it makes you cry, it's the good kind and not the sad kind. I'm almost 22 years old and I've watched this movie the past three nights in a row because I'm literally hooked. The little musical numbers are funny and catchy, and even though there's a bit of darkness to it, it's such a feel-good movie you can't help but enjoy it. They also picked an amazing cast, I loved all of the voices (and I'm definitely one of those people where if I can't stand a characters voice it ruins the movie). The overall message it sends to kids is awesome. Losing a dog is hard, I've been there and the pain is unimaginable, but as crazy as it sounds this movie gives me hope that all dogs DO go to heaven because they're so naturally good and loyal. If you need a movie to cheer you up after losing a pup this is definitely a movie for you. Or if you just want something to make you laugh and cry, it's also good for you. They just don't make movies like this anymore.

I'd recommend this to anyone and everyone. It's simply amazing, five stars all the way.",1457740800,2,1416,4.149090909090909

There are also a lot of great lessons that can be learned from it as well. Charlie is a German Shepherd mutt who seems to be a con artist of sorts, however, he does have a good heart. Itchy is a Dachshund who is his best friend and he seems to be kind of like a moral compass from time to time. Burt Reynolds, Dom DeLoiuse, and Loni Anderson are only some of the voice actors who do a great job with bringing the characters to life.",1447372800,,606,3.9754098360655736

609220,4,6303206158,"I love this movie solely because I saw this when I was a little girl. I had been trying to find good movies that my kids might like that isn't like most rubbish they put out today, sugar coated full of blah. Its not one of the top ones that had a bunch of singing and mushy stuff but its still good. It does have singing but its a bit different. Love all the characters and the sweet touching stuff. Its not overly done.

One big tip for those looking to purchase this movie for live stream off of Amazon instant videos. I highly doubt there is a big difference between HD and standard. I bought HD in hopes maybe they cleaned it up like most older cartoons that they say they have made into HD. It just looked like really sad and grainy quality cleared up, it looks as if nothing much was boosted up from what I remember off of VHS. Wish I could return it in a sense and just buy the standard. I feel it was more of a rip off thinking Id actually get a better quality. Just some advice for those looking to buy it for instant video.",1431820800,5,1033,4.063725490196078

609331,4,6303206158,"I have seen this movie so many times and always thought it was a good one. It tells the story of Charlie B. Barkin (Burt Reynolds) who is killed by his partner Carface (Vick Tayback). Charlie is then sent to Heaven but decides to go back to Earth, and befriends a lonely verbally abused orphan named Anne-Marie (played by the late childhood actress Judith Barsi). With the help of his pal Itchy (Dom DeLuise) he uses the little girl to win and gamble money, and also to get back at Carface. Along the way they meet a rather absurd looking alligator (Ken Page, The Nightmare Before Christmas). Anne-Marie then discovers a wallet that belonged to a couple Charlie stole from. Angry and hurt at him for this she decides to return it, amd is offered to be adopted. But, before she can be adopted she is betrayed by Charlie and kidnapped by Carface. Charlie and Carface face off until he is eaten by King Gator. Anne-Marie is knocked into the water along with Charlie's time watch. Charlie sacrifices himself to save the little girl. Because of his actions he is allowed into heaven. With the help of Itchy Anne-Marie is rescued and adopted by the loving couple who also adopts Itchy. Anne-Marie and Charlie re-unite one final time and share a tearful goodbye. Carface is sent to Heaven and much like Charlie he leaves to which Charlie replies ""He'll be back.""

This movie like any Don Bluth film has good animation. Younger children may not understand the thematic elements involving death and the afterlife. A family film? Yes, and not in a kiddie way it has enough humor to appeal to adults.

The film however has been edited for a G rating due to Don Bluth worrying about a PG rating. The things removed include an extendes version of Charlie's nightmare of being condemned to Hell, and also the word ""Damn"" is omitted from a song, however it does appear in the album release. I have to say even under today's standards the thematic elements and mild action are enough alone for a PG.

Overall Recommendation: Highly Recommended*

609676,5,6303206158,"WHY do so many people either *under*-rate this *AMAZING* movie or bad-mouth Charlie B. Barkin?!  Sure, Charlie's a scoundrel, but he's as lovable as either Anne-Marie or Itchy as you get to know him better!  And yes, Walt Disney's 'The Little Mermaid' made a bigger hit in theaters (I would have been happy with a tie; the same thing happened six years later between 'Casper' and 'Toy Story'; BUMMER!), but look how it sky-rocketed once it came out on video!

LOVE the characters *except* for Carface and Killer- GRR!!  (Literally.)  Those... BOZOS mistreat Anne-Marie horribly; and NO, Charlie and Itchy did *not* do the same thing!  (I HATE it when people say that!!)  *They* cared for her to *SOME* degree at least, unlike the canine version of You-Know-Who and Wormtail; and Charlie DID keep his promises to her eventually, even if a little late in coming.
Charlie- how can you NOT *love* that guy?!  He's funny, street-smart, DOES have a good singing voice (yeah, sure, Burt Reynolds wasn't a opera star, but then neither was Gerard Butler in POTO), and even though he collects gold, he has a heart made of the same material underneath his scruffy soft fur.  Like it says on the tin, ""The charm of a con-man and the heart of a marshmallow.""  He naturally IS a *good* dog who is loyal and kind- like I said earlier, just late in coming (or, in this case, late in life, ha-ha-ha).
Itchy- I LOVE *all* of the characters that Dom Delouise (may he rest in peace along with sweetheart Judith Barsi) voiced, and Itchy is one of the top 'ten'!  *LOVE* him as Charlie's best friend- if there were a sidekicks' club, he'd be in it along with Jiminy Cricket (whom Charlie could have used a visit from, I think), Timothy Q. Mouse, Dumbo, Bagheera, and all those other lovable/loving friends in the shadows/at the hero's side.  (And yes, I include Severus Snape in that category.)
Anne-Marie- LOVABLE and love-*ing* are the two best words to describe her along with beautiful inside and out.  She DOES look kind of like Snow White, but she also resembles Walt Disney's version of Pinocchio in both looks and personality.  A t least she could trust THESE two conmen, if running into some snags along the way.  I love that ""Love Survives"", one of my favorite songs of all time, is dedicated to Judith's memory.
The score- LOVE it!!  Favorite songs are ""Let Me Be Surprised"", ""You Can't Keep a Good Dog Down"", and ""What's Mine is Yours"".
The scenery and animation- PURE. *Magic* as *ALWAYS* with Don Bluth's films.
The timeline, 1939 New Oreleans, (same year that 'The Wizard of Oz' came out) is just a bonus.",1416441600,,2598,4.6644736842105265

609921,4,6303206158,"I watched an episode of the ADGTH series with great skepticism hearing what a lot of people were saying about it. However I was pleasantly surprised, the series is actually very good, not as good as the first or even the second movie but still good. The animation isn't great or on par with the first or second movie but I've seen much worse and i'm able to overlook it. Charlie and Itchy are still as entertaining as usual with the occasional appearances from Sasha or carface. Killer is also in the series which I liked very much seeing as how that sort of ties the series in with the first film, something the second film didn't do even though I liked that one too. Steven Weber does very well as Charlie, he's no Burt Reynolds who to me will always be the real Charlie Barkin, but still does pretty good and I wanna say better than Sheen's portrayal in the second film. Overall I give the series a 4/5 stars. There are few errors with it but I still like it anyway seeing as how i'm a big fan of the original. However I refuse to watch the All dogs Christmas one because that one sounds like and looks like a dud. So i'd say if you've seen the original add the second movie and the series to your collection but skip the Christmas one.",1408147200,2,1239,4.254237288135593
609922,5,6303206158,"Obviously I love this movie but let me point this out, the best thing about this movie as well as the sequel is that even though it's targeted towards kids adults can enjoy it just as much, even though the movie is rated G it is hardly like anything you'd get from a Disney movie, it has a lot of things in it like drinking, death, heaven and hell that little kids might not pick up on but the adults will. Despite what Charlie Barkin, the main character of the movie, is he is still a very likeable character, Itchy is sort of the pathetic side kick yet great friend of Charlie and Anne Marie who can talk to animals. The end of this movie made me want to cry and that's saying a lot because barely ANY movie does that to me and I'm a 17-year-old male so that says a lot about the movie. All in all this a very strong, fun, emotional film that will break your heart a little but in a good way. One of the best animated films of all time that isn't by Disney. If only Disney films could be more like this film. Love this movie, 5/5 stars all the way!",1408147200,,1050,4.028708133971292

610120,5,6303206158,"This show was a favorite of mine when I was younger and I was a huge fan of the ADGTH movies and always wished I could see more of the series. So I was very happy to be able to own the entire show at last! If I had known the entire series would be released when I was younger, I'd have been so happy, it's really great to have it now. The series' strongest point by far is the friendship between Charlie and Itchy and the sacrifices they make for each other and the support they give each other. Charlie and Sasha's relationship is funny and charming and as always, Charlie himself is a joy to watch and a charming rogue you can't help but love and Steven Weber's voice acting really helps you love the guy more.

The voice actors are very into their roles and they are very energetic and humorous, especially the late Dom DiLuise who brings so much life and personality and charm to Charlie's friend Itchy. Charles Nelson Riley also makes a return as Killer from the original movie and he is also very entertaining. Bebe Neuworth is also very good as Annabelle and diabolical as Belladonna, who is a very cool and delightfully evil addition to the crew. The animation leaves something to be desired, but I've been able to look past it, the songs in the show are not amazing by any means, but they are certainly catchy, in particular ""Itchin' and a Twitchin'"", and they are cute enough.

The storylines are interesting enough to keep you watching and Charlie's character provides a contrast that is entertaining; he is a character who is prone to roguish acts but he is put in situations where he has to help people and that is interesting dramatically. Again, you can't help but feel satisfied to see him get what he deserves and then love him when he has the courage to fix what he messed up and ultimately do what's right. Honestly, the only complaint I have is that I am a little disappointed with season 3 and the lack of mission episodes, but there are more than enough of those to make up for it in earlier seasons.

No doubt younger children will enjoy this show and perhaps even older ones as well. All in all, it is a very fun, charming show with fun characters and entertaining storylines and I am very happy to own it for myself!",1404432000,,2241,4.395180722891566

610263,5,6303206158,"Got this for my niece and ended up watching it myself. This is a very charming movie about an orphan girl who needs to find herself new parents. Charlie and his itchy friend find her being held captive in his boss's basement, they buster her out and take her somewhere safe.  they realise she can communicate with all animals and see's an opportunity to use her at the horse race track....but the squeaker is very clever and starts to realise they are not keeping their side of the deal.

There are some extremely funny moments in this and the animation is superb. There are messages here about sharing your own with the less fortunate with a lovely added song, sacrificing your own comforts for the good of someone else, what doggie heaven looks like and the corrupt mind of the bad guys. Will Charlie put his own priorities in second place to save the squeaker?

Anne Marie and Charlie are total opposites but its Anne Marie's innocents that really drives the whole movie always nudging Charlie in the right direction. The scene when Charlie is trying to get her to sleep is so funny. Kids and adults will love this and it is a worthy piece to anyone's animated movie collection.",1399420800,,1181,4.587677725118484

This is a great movie that shows that doing bad isn't a good thing.  The messages here are positive, if you're worried about that sort of thing.  The animation is classic.

610590,4,6303206158,"I grew up with this film. It was one of my childhood favorites. Nonetheless, there are a few things that give me pause as an adult hoping to view it with children of my own.

I do not speak of the overall dark tone of this movie. (More on that later.) Rather, I speak of content that was, frankly, inappropriate even in 1989 that most of us who last viewed this as children have forgotten about. First of all, there are a couple brief instances of uncomfortable racial caricatures. Secondly, it should be noted that the film paints animal fighting rings in a rather positive, or at least harmless, light. (Those who hold horse racing to be inhumane should be aware that it gets a similar treatment.) These are minor sequences that do not detract from the overall message of the film, but parents should be prepared to discuss these issues with their children if they feel it is necessary.

Unusually for a children's movie that depicts heaven and hell, the morality is more ""shades of gray"" than ""black and white."" The protagonists are involved in organized crime, and not unwillingly. There is even a surprisingly deep scene that questions the ethics of a man using stolen money to buy food for impoverished, ""fatherless"" children implied to be his own estranged offspring. Nonetheless, Charlie is damned mainly for his refusal to accept death at the allotted time, not his previous life of sin, and in the end, even a completely unredeemed villain is allowed through the pearly gates because ""dogs are naturally good."" For those able to process it, the moral complexity is one of the movies strong points, but it might be over the heads of younger children.

Overall, the animation holds up extremely well more than twenty years later, and the songs, while not exactly memorable, manage not to be annoying or cringe-inducingly bad. The voice acting is nothing short of spectacular. I'd still recommend All Dogs Go to Heaven to any parent willing to sit through the film with their child to tackle some of the less pleasant concepts. And if they can get past the unfortunate sequences mentioned above, adults looking for a solitary nostalgia trip won't be disappointed either.",1387584000,,2177,4.815508021390374

It wasn't a bad story, I just wasn't able to enjoy it as much as the second because it was about cheating death, not protecting life like the second. Also, I wasn't a fan of the little girl in personality or voice.

Finally i find the movie available on Blu-ray. i am so thankful to finally owning not only the widescreen version of this classic but 1080p HD!! and for the price it's well worth it. there are a few spots during the film where it's a bit blurry even for Blu-ray but overall it's a pretty decent HD transfer and did i mention it's finally widescreen :) main audio is English 2.0 Surround DTS-HD Master Audio. definitely a timeless classic not to be missed if you're considering buying this version.,1369785600,,768,4.532374100719425

610837,5,6303206158,"This movie is about a convict dog named Charlie Barkin who escapes from prison with his friend Itchy. Charlie is a pro con artist and will do anything for money. In the film, Charlie is double crossed and killed by his boss Carface. When Charlie goes to heaven, he meets a Whippet Angel who he dances with and starts to fall in love with, but then he steals his watch from heaven, winds it up, and comes back to life. But then he hears the angel tell him he can't come back to heaven. As the film goes on, Charlie meets a little orphan girl who can talk to animals. Her name is Anne-Marie, and Charlie wants to use her gift to make money. Charlie then starts making lots of money all the while making Anne-Marie happy by buying her tons of clothing and promising he will find her a family as well as help the poor. Anne-Marie later finds out that Charlie has been stealing money from people for his own benefit, and she gets upset about it. Charlie then begins having nightmares of what the Whippet Angel said to him. The next day, Anne-Marie returns the wallet to the family, and she begins to bond with the loving man and woman, who are surprised to hear that she is an orphan.

Near the end of the movie, Charlie gives his life in order to save Anne-Marie, and the Whippet Angel tells Charlie he can come back to heaven for his good deed. The ending made me cry during the scene where Charlie is about to go back to heaven, he wakes up Anne-Marie and tells her he has to go. He then tells her to take care of Itchy because he doesn't have anyone. Anne-Marie hugs Charlie and they both say they will miss each other. She then tells Charlie she loves him, and he tells her he loves her too. Then Charlie goes back to heaven and joins the Whippet Angel.

This movie is really sweet and cute even though it deals with some strong subjects. It has a sense of humor and doesn't take itself too seriously. It's a good animated film and it is one of my favorites.",1369094400,,1958,4.246648793565684

I felt compelled to help some people by deciding if the blu ray version of this movie is right for them. Let start by saying that I collect all of Don Bluth animated classics, but whatever opinion you have about the movie itself, I respect. Not everyone can be pleased by the story-line selected by a director on any of old times classic tales. But as a collector that buys the blu blu ray versions of such tales, I expect that at least some special restoration is done in the video transfer to be worth the upgrade. Well that restoration is non existent in any of the Don Bluth movies. The only movie that is an exception is Anastasia. Other than that, they all deserve ONE STAR for video restoration.

610916,4,6303206158,"Charlie B. Barkin is a dog, a German Shepherd mix in 1939 New Orleans. The dogs in this world have their own secret lives though, and Charlie's is one of a selfish crook and con-artist who runs a canine gambling establishment in the junkyard with his partner, gangsterish bulldog (I think) Carface. They each have their jittery sidekicks too. Charlie has sweet best-friend Itchy, and Carface has the psychotic nerd-dog Killer. As the film begins, Charlie and Itchy are breaking out of the pound, where Charlie is on Death Row. It's a little something Carface secretly arranged so he wouldn't have to share the gambling business with Charlie anymore. When Charlie and Itchy turn up at the casino that night, Carface and Killer move on to plan B. Long story short, Charlie goes to Heaven. But, he doesn't stay there long. Charlie finds his way back down (against warnings that he can never come back), and when he discovers Carface's big gambling secret to keep him always on top, a little (human) girl who can talk to animals, he decides to kidnap,... er, rescue her, so he can take his life back as top dog in town. And, so he does, promising the sweet, little, orphan girl (she's like 4 or something', I don't know) they will share their winnings with the poor and that he will help her find parents. Of course, Charlie being Charlie, he struggles to keep little Anne-Marie happy while serving his own ends, and soon he must deal with her wish for a home, Carface's impending retaliation, and the consequences of breaking out of Heaven!

Sounds like a pretty intense and unusual plot for a American animated film, huh? Though there are those who complain about it, ""All Dogs Go to Heaven"" certainly deserves some credit for braving adult themes and emotions. At times, creator Don Bluth could be found to be more daring in that department than competitors, not that it was Anime level (don't get me wrong, I'm a Disney guy myself, but it's all good). Of course, it was the pre-politically correct 1980's, so that helped too, even if the very end of it (1989). The film is not without a ton of problems though. For one thing, the dialogue, the story, and the animation is nerve-wracking. Imagine the Tex-Avery inspired scene in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" (my all-time favorite film) in the beginning, when, in the cartoon being shot, Roger is flying and bouncy all over the kitchen on fire and whatnot. Imagine a whole feature like that! Okay, that is a little bit exaggerated, but there is something about this film that is like that. It is all over the place, it is noisy and confusing even at times it shouldn't be. The characters are stumbling and talking over each other all the time and it is, well, just tough to stay with it because you get a bit annoyed, frankly. This is, more than anything, when there are no humans around, and it's just dogs. I can kinda get that, but it complicates the storytelling, which, in general is not the best here. Bluth may have a major Disney background, and heck, I know he's done great things before this (Secret of NIMH is just awesome and much better than this film), but if one were to just watch this film, you get the idea he is not very good at directing. Oh, I'll give you the redeeming qualities soon though, don't worry, but besides the constant jabbering, wobbling, and sight gags going on, you've also got the problem of the music, plus the most regrettably unused setting. 1930's New Orleans? You could barely tell this was New Orleans aside from a brief shot of a Mardi Gras parade and a quick use of the French Quarter much later. Yeah, there's an alligator in this decked out for Mardi Gras, but he could have just as easily been a trap for the Chipmunks in the Chipmunk Adventure's big finale in the Rainforest (also a better film, by the way). Another key flub here? The use of music. None of it had a New Orleans feel, really. One tune was even Reggae or something. That's just a guess; I don't know much about music, but I know New Orleans type music when I hear it. The songs are all over the place, too. Some of the music here is surprisingly good (a very small fraction), while some is just awful. Like, bad direct-to-video animated musical awful. If you can't get the music right, don't do a musical (why, oh why was Lady and the Tramp 2 made as a musical? But I digress...). As for the 1939 part of it, besides the cars, you wouldn't know it really. And there are a few things here and there that did not look accurate. The idea of setting it in 1939 New Orleans sounds awesome, but it was totally wasted here. For contrast, put on ""The Princess and the Frog"". BIG difference. Now THAT's how you do period New Orleans (circa the 1920's)! And it doesn't let down in the music department either.

Okay, so those are the big complaints, the poor use of music and setting, the frenetic scenes that can be irritating pretty much immediately, even when a quieter tone would have served the scene better (for example, the villain's scenes could have been played more like those in Oliver and Company, even though he was human there, and he would have been far more intimidating and far less annoying), and did I mention a key problem with the storytelling yet? It is so random and all over the place! Story shifts come out of nowhere and introduce important elements so suddenly and randomly (more of that freneticism), like the big alligator! In fact, that alligator bit even inspired a phrase, ""big lipped alligator moment,"" coined by the internet's Nostalgia Critic to refer to random, bizarre, and unimportant to the plot scenes like that. I would argue its plot importance since it introduces a character who provides some important help in the climax though (clearly the only reason the alligator is suddenly introduced). But, what about the good points of this much beloved film?

There are some good ones. Like I mentioned first, this film has more adult elements than most American animated features (though it was actually made in Ireland, Don Bluth is considered an American filmmaker). The film is beautifully animated, as one would expect from Don Bluth. And, while some would argue this, there are a lot of really enjoyable characters here. Charlie, Anne-Marie, and some of the other good guys, though some can be annoying at times (like Itchy, even though I normally love Dom Deluise) are all pretty lovable in their own way. Burt Reynolds is fantastic as Charlie, by the way. Judith Barsi, the little girl who played Anne-Marie, was adorable. This film was actually released posthumously, after she and her mother were murdered by her father in 1988. Vic Tayback, of TV's ""Alice"" played villain ""Carface"", and he is well-cast considering, though his scenes that come easiest to mind are still far too frenetic (Charles Nelon Riley's ""Killer"" does not help!). The humans are mostly done in rotoscope, which you may or may not like. It's a good contrast with the hyper activity of the dogs though (which I realize is why the film is so frenetic, but for storytelling's sake..., I mean, Oliver and Co. is much easier to watch; even Roger Dangerfield).

The emotional moments in ""All Dogs Go to Heaven"", and some of the dramatic elements, can be pretty effective, though I think this is strongest for those who can apply some nostalgic value to it (I probably made it just under the wire for this). If you didn't grow up with this movie, you probably won't fall in love with it now. Too many issues. I am not in love with it myself, and I sorta grew up with it (okay, I was starting High School, but that counts when you're a big animation fan/late bloomer like myself), but I can still enjoy it and have fond memories of it that I consider to be from my growing-up years. Would I take any Disney movie over this one? Yeah. The hand-drawn stuff, anyway, and some of the CGI, but not all of it. I'd take a few of Bluth's movies over this one too, but it isn't among his worst, either. It's somewhere in the middle. There's some cool stuff in this for sure, and you've got to give it originality points too. And it was for sure popular, as it had a theatrical sequel, a TV series, and a Christmas special, all of which I still need to see. Incidentally, I think I still have a couple of Wendy's Kids' Meal toys from this somewhere, or at least I had them for a long time. Notable, as they were among very few Wendy's toys that were comparable in quality to McD's and BK's (but, again, I digress).

Overall, if you love animation, you should check this film out, but it's got problems. Be patient, because it gets MUCH better once Anne-Marie is introduced, but it takes a little while. Like most American animation, it is not as good as anything from Disney, but it's as close as anyone had gotten at that time. If you grew up loving this film, you'll definitely want to pick the Blu-Ray up. It doesn't look particularly great to me and is probably no better than the DVD (I'm not an expert on the technical stuff though), but at least it is in Widescreen on Blu, and I think it's the first time this movie has been released that way. That's reason enough to get it on Blu. Sadly though, it is such a low-budget release that there isn't even a menu. It's one of those Blus that runs in a loop. But, at least they still gave it one bonus feature, the theatrical trailer. That's more than some movies with menus get. Anyway, give it a try if you think you'll find something redeeming in this film. It has both good and bad qualities, and it belongs in any animation or Bluth fan's collection. Honestly, if you get through the whole film, I think you'll be glad you watched it, even if it can easily be described as a mess, there is still a story there with some interesting elements and beautiful animation. They put a lot of work into this, even if it needed to be rehashed a lot. A good and original idea at heart.",1365292800,,9882,4.533893557422969

611139,5,6303206158,"Growing up watching films like The Little Mermaid, this was one that I also had an obsession with, but mostly in my 2nd or 3rd grade year. I've had the old DVD for many a moon, but it was starting to show its signs of retirement. And buying this Blu-Ray was the best way to relive my childhood. I think the last time I watched this film was either in junior high or at the beginning of 9th grade. Re watching it now, it's still got that same nostalgic feel to it, and on its own, it's a good, decent film. However, it does have it's problems. The story really is all over the place and it doesn't really flow too well. But the movie still kept me entertained. It also really did take a while for the film to get started. The songs aren't too memorable though. However, probably the most ""memorable"" song is the song with the crazy alligator, hence where the statement ""Big Lipped Alligator Moment"" came from. The characters are kind of memorable. Burt Reynolds is Burt Reynolds. He does fine playing Charlie. Though sometimes I felt that he did not like enjoying singing his songs, hence why Charlie Sheen came in for the sequel. Anne-Marie, the orphan girl who has an unknown reason on how she can talk to animals, is somewhat obnoxious. But she is just a little girl and I can't really harp on her too much. The friendship between Charlie and Anne-Marie is relatively decent and they do have some nice moments. But when watching other relationships like this, like Lilo and Stitch for example, it falls a bit short. The ending is rather nice and touching and the animation is pretty good. All in all, rewatching this film, it's still good. The transfer is fine, and it is an entertaining film. In my opinion, if you have kids, give this film a go. It's not perfect, but comparing it to the sequel, which I hate, it is miles better. Thank goodness I got the sequel from a Pizza Hut free with a medium pizza.

Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid!  He said as he banged his head against the wall several times.  Oh well.  I think from now on I need to take stock of which films I'm tossing, and which films I'm keeping.

But, to the movie.  It's a decent enough flick, telling of the greed and redemption of a dog living on the edge, who passes on, but steals a second chance for himself.  Highly original and extremely inventive story telling, this is one of the best animated children's films with an edge for adults that I've yet to come across.  Reynolds is the perfect voice for a roguish dog, and his ever faithful friend is of course played by the late Dom Deluise.

The little girl is just as endearing as the two dogs accompanying her.  It's hard to believe that she got mixed up in the capers of a mutt like Charlie, but her heart of gold sees his true character before time calls him back to his ultimate fate.

Don Bluth, master character animator and former Disney veteran, creates a visual feast of a tale, and brings to life his imagery of canine antics by not only drawing key sequences, but also by directing an all star fast.

Incredible stuff.  Now, if I could only find my lost dvd... dang it!

P.S. I don't know why, but at the time when I rented the VHS I felt really compelled to see it.  I didn't particularly dislike the film, nor was I a huge fan of it either.  But I liked the dog's adventure for what it was.  But for some reason I felt really kooky and odd about having a copy of the film.  I mean, I liked animation, and still do, but I'm not a big Don Bluth fan as such.  And this film, despite its rough spirit, felt a little uneven for some reason.  Still, it is what it is, and I can't say that I'd really reccomend it to any but the most ardent animation fan... which I am, I guess.",1310688000,,1981,4.232
611177,3,6303206158,"I haven't seen this before, so didn't have the nostalgia factor going for me as it seems to have been for some other reviewers. This had some cute and sweet moments, but overall just seemed too violent, difficult to explain, and dated for young children of today. The dogs in the movie are essentially a band of criminals, and one is killed by another. He goes to heaven because 'all dogs go to heaven' but wants to go back to avenge his death. He is told that if he does, he can never return to heaven, but he doesn't listen. On his return, he befriends a young orphan who can talk to animals, mostly because he wants to use her to gain inside info on horse races and the like. He eventually does genuinely come to care for her, and the story centers around his inner conflicts related to this. But for much of the movie he is a lying swindler bent on killing his killer, who is of course also still bent on killing him. It is really kind of a dog-infused mob pic. A far cry from 101 Dalmations or Lady and the Tramp or any animated dog movies of that ilk, which is what I was actually hoping for.

The ending is sweet, and made up for some of the movie, but overall the constant killing threats and attempts made me uncomfortable with this film, and seemed to baffle my kids. The animation itself is dated by today's standards also, and not in a classic/good way I felt, so I think this movie is just past it's prime.",1310342400,4,1419,4.236162361623617
611178,5,6303206158,"This is such an amazing movie, from the delightful animation to the songs (which are surprisingly good for a children's film). The movie centers on loveable scoundrel Charlie B. Barkin (Burt Reynolds), who is double-crossed and killed by his former business partner Carface (Vic Tayback), leaving behind a booming business and grief-stricken buddy Itchy (Dom Deluise). However, upon entering heaven, Charlie meets a Heavenly Whippet (named Annabelle in the sequel) who shows him the clocks representing the lives of all creatures on Earth, and, following a catchy song, rewinds the watch of his life--which was stopped. Charlie is then sent back to Earth, having been warned that he can never return to heaven, and eventually discovers Carface's secret to huge profit--a captive orphan girl who can talk to animals. With the help of Itchy, Charlie ""rescues"" aka kidnaps Anne Marie (Judith Barsi) and uses her in the same way as Carface--but keeping her happy by promising to feed the poor with money won in bets. But when Anne Marie discovers that Charlie is a ""bad dog"" and is using her, she runs away...only to be recaptured by Carface and his thugs. Before this point, she had become sick by falling in water (pneumonia is hinted at). Carface whisks the girl away to an abandoned ship, where Charlie is lured into the trap to save her. After a fight and an appearance by a somewhat creepy alligator, Carface is presumably eaten and therefore out of the way. Anne Marie then falls into the water (which is of course lit on fire by oil falling into it and being ignited) and Charlie has to save her. But his watch (apparently safe) falls from its place and into the water. Charlie, running out of air, struggles but finally makes the selfless decision to save Anne Marie, therefore abandoning his watch. After ensuring Anne Marie is safe, Charlie dives again for his watch--but we see the watch give a few ticks...and stop. Afterwards, we are left to wonder what became of Charlie--until a scene where Anne Marie is sleeping (I won't give away where she's sleeping). A ghostly Charlie enters the room, making sure Anne Marie keeps Itchy, without revealing to the child where he's actually going. We then see the Heavenly Whippet destroy Hell's dragon-like demon. I won't ruin what happens after that--all I'll tell you is that it makes me want to cry every time.

I really loved this movie--enough to watch it six times in two weeks. There aren't quite words to describe how I feel about it--it's that good in my opinion. It's heartwarming and masterful and features an all-star voice cast. I wish I could give this movie twenty stars. However I do not recommend the sequel, the only voice that stays the same is Itchy--Burt Reynolds becomes Charlie Sheen, and the Heavenly Whippet becomes a high-pitched, impatient, controlling drama queen. Plus there's really no plot--all it really does is set up the series. For hardcore fans of the first one, don't ruin your experience.

Rest in peace Dom Deluise and Judith Barsi. :(

I would like to share with everyone that Judith Barsi, the voice of Anne Marie, was shot in the head and killed by her own father before the film was completed and released. Her father then turned the gun on her mother and himself. The beautiful song ""Love Survives"" during the credits is dedicated to Judith's memory. She was ten years old.",1308787200,,3367,4.831889081455806

Briefly I'll mention that All Dogs Go To Heaven is a brilliant and moving story that is best watched on your own late into the night. That is the case for me and watching it on blu ray on my ps3 on the sony 32 inch could get better, except maybe for the seemingly infinished restoring job done on the film; the grane and blur in the presentation could be better. Also this Blu Ray has no menu. Its a 25gb blu ray disc so it doesn't have a main menu althought that doesn't mean that you miss out on any extras. This is one of my favourite movies and certainly an excelent example on and animated feature. As with most productions by Don Bluth there is attention spent especially to character animation, which is the key to brining them to life.
As with most Don Bluth films there are moment that make you wonder why they did it and that they don't really fit into the theme of the story.
From the start of the film, while your chuckling to yourslef, untill the end as the credits begin to role, with a tear in your eye, im sure that you will enjoy every moment and that this film will never leave your heart.

611212,1,6303206158,"I'm a huge fan of this movie and I was looking forward to the Blu-ray release, especially since the DVD transfer is pretty lousy.  Unfortunately, the Blu-ray isn't much of an improvement, and in some ways is worse than the DVD.

First off, the Blu-ray is totally bare-bones.  The only extra is the theatrical trailer.  There's no top menu, only a pop-up menu which lets you select scenes and toggle audio/subtitles while the film is in progress.  This makes setup a real pain, since you have to start the movie, choose your settings, and then restart the movie.  There's no recall function, so if you need to stop the film partway through, you'll have to restart it when you return.  In addition, you'll need to manually skip through the 20th Century Fox logo and ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" ad every time, since there's no top menu to jump to.

As for the film itself, the jumpiness/flicker from the DVD version is gone and the colors are bolder.  However, there's still a lot of digital noise--graininess, specks on the screen, etc.  Overall the picture looks like something that would be found on a DVD, and compared to the crystal clear Disney Blu-rays, it's extremely disappointing.  The bigger problem is that the Blu-ray is presented in widescreen format, despite ""All Dogs"" being filmed in 1.33:1 aspect.  So, the top and bottom of the screen are cut off, and large segments of the background art are lost.  Granted, people have always complained about black bars on their screens, and including a cropped-in option isn't a bad idea.  But why isn't a matted version there as well?  Surely there's enough room on the disc for both?

If you need to get a copy of this film right now, I recommend the DVD version: the picture quality isn't quite as good, but it's in the correct aspect ratio and it has a top menu.  Otherwise, hold off until Fox releases a true high-def restoration.",1301616000,40,1886,4.683890577507599

611218,5,6303206158,"""All Dogs Go To Heaven"" is a movie that's geared at children, but perhaps it shouldn't be.

It was a favorite of mine growing up, but I think at my young age, I wasn't able to grasp all of the dark undertones and ideas that were going on, such as Charlie finding himself in Hell during a dream or that Satan had appeared in a scene later on.
But despite that, I was still able to enjoy it for what it was.

Now, seeing it again about fifteen years later, I still love it but I'm starting to think maybe it isn't so good for kids. I've been shocked by the darkness that's sprinkled throughout it, something I never picked up when I was young. However, this isn't a bad thing and it doesn't ruin the movie. It's just slightly changed my view of it.

The story follows German Shepherd (apparently a mix?) named Charlie B. Barkin and his Dachshund friend, Itchy Itchiford. After being busted out of ""jail"" (a dog pound), Charlie tries to reunite with old Pit-Bull friend, Carface, only to be murdered by him after a nice night of partying and celebration. However, Charlie cheats the system and is able to send himself back to Earth after a little trip to heaven. Soon after, they ""rescue"" young Ann-Marie, an orphan girl who can talk to animals. Charlie, being the scheming mutt that he is, promises to help her find a family but only intends to use her ability to make himself and Itchy a fortune.

Now, this sounds like a cute movie that's okay for the kids. You get talking dogs, afterall. But it's not what it seems. There are quite a few rather violent scenes and if your child would be smart enough to catch on to the fact that a character was just murdered or something like that, it may not be the best movie. Charlie himself isn't even a child-friendly character. He cheats, steals, lies, etc.

Personally, I don't think that this makes ""All Dogs Go To Heaven"" a bad movie. I grew up watching it, as did all of my friends, and we all turned out fine. However, with the sheltered childhood kids are given anymore, it's no surprise that protective mothers have their reasons for hating this movie.

At it's heart, this movie has a good message and it's not all about the bad things in life. There is plenty of good in it that can teach kids more than the bad in the beginning will.

It's a very sweet movie that's able to make itself different from other kids' movies, but perhaps, not all kids can enjoy it for what it is. If you're a parent, I'd suggest you take a look at it first or, at least, watch it with them. If you don't think your kiddo can really handle the dark themes that's underlying beneath the ""talking dogs,"" then simply take it out and put in something more child-friendly.

""All Dogs Go To Heaven"" is a good movie, but maybe not the best ""kid's movie"" out there.",1285372800,,2787,4.366795366795367

The violence and adult situations are not clearly obvious, but little kids will probably be horrified at some of the images put on screen. As one reviewer mentioned before, this isn't really for young children, so every parent is warned. The one problem I had with ADGTH was the songs.

611271,2,6303206158,"Around the late 1970's, animator Don Bluth, frustrated with the output his company, Disney was churning, defected from the Mouse House to form his own studio.  His first production, THE SECRET OF NIMH, was a brilliant feature that still holds up well to this day.  This was followed by AN AMERICAN TAIL and THE LAND BEFORE TIME, both of which were made under the involvement of Steven Spielberg and were commercially successful.  Although none of those two films had the dark adult appeal of NIMH, they still are very charming, enjoyable features for both children and grown-ups.  But before long, Don Bluth had his first major misfire with ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN; critics were especially harsh on this film, and matters weren't helped by the fact that it opened alongside Disney's THE LITTLE MERMAID.

Considering that the movie has such a friendly-sounding title, one would expect ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN to be pleasant family fare.  Instead Bluth provides a surprisingly dark story involving gambling, deceit, crime, mistreatment, and murder.  That itself is not a problem for an animated feature per say, but it does call into question over whether the film is for children.  On the other hand, it's hard to say whether adults will find much to enjoy in ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN.  In short, it's a movie with a major identity crisis.

Set in a dreary junkyard of New Orleans, the movie starts out when Charlie B. Barkin, a rough-and-tumble German shepherd, is run over by a car courtesy of his former gambling casino partner, a nasty, cigar-puffing pitbull, Carface.  Before you know it, Charlie finds himself in heaven, albeit by default.  Here a whippet angel, Annabelle, tells him that ""all dogs go to heaven because unlike people, dogs are usually loyal and kind.""  This line represents the confused nature of the movie, since the dogs in the movie, the whippet aside, are presented as anything but.

Upon realizing that he's been murdered, Charlie steals his way back to Earth and plots to get even with Carface.  With the reluctant help of his dachshund pal Itchy, Charlie ""rescues"" Carface's prize, AnneMarie, a human girl who can talk to animals (in order to predict who will win the rat races).  Charlie claims that he will help the little cutie find her a family, but in reality he is using her skills to win fortunes at the race so that he can build a more elaborate casino of his own to bring Carface down.  Although he refuses to admit it, Charlie does grow to love AnneMarie...

The concept of the story isn't as problematic as the execution.  Aside from the human girl AnneMarie and a flamboyant musical alligator who appears about three-quarters through (with the vocal pipes of Ken Page), none of the other characters emerge as likeable, nor frankly, are even worth caring about.  Unfortunately, that also applies to Charlie; in trying to make him an anti-hero, the script (composed by more than ten writers) only succeeds in rendering the character TOO unlovable.  As such, the audience feels no empathy for Charlie, and worse, his redemption at the end of the movie does not come across as convincing.  (Further damaging to the character is the disappointingly uncharismatic vocal performance from Burt Reynolds.)

Besides the lack of an endearing lead, the movie's other problem is in the structure of the story.  The slowly-paced plot jumps all over the place and makes a habit of throwing in extra scenes which serve no purpose but to pad out the movie's running time.  The aforementioned musical alligator (who resides in a danky sewer infested with native rats) seems to have been thrown in from nowhere, as does a scene where Charlie tries to show his generosity to AnneMarie by feeding a pack of pastel-colored pups pizza.  The whole screenplay feels like a rough first draft; a bit more polish could have made this a tighter, impactful story.

Matters are not helped by the lackluster musical numbers by Charlie Strouse and T.J. Kuenster (AnneMarie's song and the gator's ballad are the only good ones; the latter in particular benefits from Ken Page's mellifluous vocal) or the uneven voice cast.  As mentioned, Burt Reynolds' stiff and lifeless Charlie detracts from his already unlikeable character even further (the only exception is a fiery confession to Itchy about his true intentions toward the end).  Dom DeLuise as Itchy is pretty good, but he's had better roles, notably Tiger in AN AMERICAN TAIL and Jeremy in THE SECRET OF NIMH.  Ken Page, as mentioned, is awesome in anything he does, but his character has such a small part that his overall contribution is unremarkable at best.  Similarly wasted are Loni Anderson (as a collie who once sired a litter with Charlie), Melba Moore, and Charles Nelson Reilly.  Judith Barsi as AnneMarie is probably the only voice that comes across as truly memorable, partially because her character is the sole legitimately likeable one in this depressing and joyless show.

Barsi aside, the only real positive about ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN is the animation.  Technically, this film has some of the most imaginative visuals from Bluth's team (by 1980's standards, that is), particularly a frightening scene where Charlie has a nightmare about ending up in a fiery underworld ruled by a gargantuan satanic canine-demon.  If anything, the movie is more of a triumph of animation than storytelling.

On the whole, however, I cannot recommend ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN as good entertainment.  Even though I recognize that the movie has its fans and the climax does admittingly provide some energy and a moving conclusion, the overall package is not in the same league as Bluth's better efforts.  Animation buffs will marvel at the lush artistry, but by the time it's over, ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN could very well leave a bad taste in your mouth.",1179273600,8,5805,4.885714285714286

611323,5,6303206158,"As a child, there was no better cartoon than `All Dogs go to Heaven', since I was such a dog lover.  As a child you watch a cartoon for the animation not for the story.  As an adult though you tend to get more out of films like this because, while being a cartoon, `All Dogs go to Heaven' is so much more.  With a moral that is so profound films of today tackle it over and over, this film succeeds mainly because we are given a timeless lesson in the most unlikely of places.

The story revolves around Charlie (voiced by Burt Reynolds) and his partner in crime Itchy (voiced by Dom DeLuise) who are murdered by crime lord Carface (voiced by Vic Taybak).  After ascending to heaven only to return back to earth in order to live a life of crime, Charlie comes across Anne-Marie (voiced by Judith Barsi), a young girl who is being used by Carface to further his gambling efforts.  At first stealing her away for his own selfish gain, Charlie begins to form a strong friendship with Anne-Marie that is soon compromised by not only his own morally corrupt tendencies, but also the growing dangers of Carface and his bloodlust towards Charlie.

Yes, as some have mentioned this cartoon borders on the dark overtones, but remember that the reason this is so `scary' if you should so call it is because as adults we can see the truth inside the sad story, but as children they will miss that entirely and will be absorbed in the animation and the `cute little puppies'...I guaranty it.  I watched this almost everyday when I was a toddler...and I slept fine.  It's only now that the story really haunts me.",1166745600,3,1600,4.4520547945205475
611324,5,6303206158,"Really, the only reason I'm writing this review is to debunk the ""too dark for children"" issue. C'mon people! Has the world gone soft or something? I watched this film when I was at least five years old back in the early 1990's and I thought it was incredibly satisfactory. Ya, it was scary in some parts. Ya, it was violent. So what? I don't remember getting any nightmares or crying or anything. In fact, the gritty tone of this movie was what made it so special. Most animated films these days are so horribly politically correct and ""dumbed down"" for children that I don't even know how they can stand to watch them themselves.

  Charlie, the protagonist of the story, I have to agree with the naysayers, really is an evil character. He lies, cheats, and steals all throughout the movie. Near the end, he says ""Look, I don't care about the girl! I tell her things now and then. I pretend to be her best friend but its bologna!"" But it's thanks to this horrible side of him that makes the climax of the film so powerful. If you haven't seen it yet, then I won't give it away specifically, but basically what happens is he overcomes his former self and does the right thing.

What I'm really trying to say is don't judge too harshly just because it's a little non-ethical with it's storytelling compared to today's standards. The movie really  does have an honest side and is a welcome addition to anyone's collection.",1161907200,9,1421,4.5136186770428015

I then took it upon myself to look through the hundreds of VHS tapes we had and find ADGH. After hors of searching I finally found it and popped it into the VCR. Wow, I was stunned. I had expected to be disappointed by how bad yet another of the movies I loved as a kid really was. But instead I ended up likening it a whole lot better now that I was older. This movie is so moving at moments that I really think it can make a grown man cry (all through it's not likely to have the same effect on little kids. They just won't understand what's going on). Eth part when Anne Marie is singing in the attic of the abandoned church is one of the saddest parts of any movie that I have ever seen. But the real treat I found was that the songs that I loved as a kid don't annoy me now that I'm 17. In fact, there almost as good (Anne Maries is better now that I know what she's singing about).
Word of caution though, in this movie there is a lot of stuff that you won't want a small kid to see. There's drinking, smoking, murder, death, hell, gambling, fist fights, gunfights, a singing alligator, and one of the scariest depictions of hell ever to be shown on screen. But I think that if the kids over 6 years old they can handle it. Just because they see a dog smoking doesn't mean they'll immediately go out and start to smoke.

Which didn't preclude me from liking the idea of dogs, or from loving this film way back when. On a nostalgia kick I bought it again and expected to have another aspect of my childhood destroyed upon being reminded of how horrible some of the things I liked back then actually are from an adult perspective (A few examples come to mind, but at least I won't have to contend with liking a few things on TV nowadays that will definitely have future adults cringing...).

Surprise, it's actually even more enjoyable now as an ""adult"". It's all as good as I remembered, or better.

When I was a child I never percieved it as a particularly ""dark"" film as so many claim it to be... Truthfully, the thing that has stuck with me over the years is the songs. They really are engaging and well written, not the squirm-fests that populate most children's films of any era. And while certain things stick out as not being acceptable in today's children's pictures (the drinking, and straightforwardness on topics such as gambling and murder), I definitely don't think that's the attitude that defines the film. To ""clean up"" this movie would be to suck the life from it, and make it just like any more modern children's film.

I have no qualms with showing it to my nieces and nephews. I think it's a shame that movies nowaday shelter younguns from anything resembling reality. Besides, at the core it's a great, touching story about love and friendship, and I think that's what shines through for most kids, and most adults upon watching the film. Anne Marie is absolutely adorable, and Charlie, voiced by Burt Reynolds is as likeable a scoundrel as any. The characters are all dimensional and believable, despite being dogs. Another thing that sticks out when viewing this film in comparison to more modern children's offerings.

It can now be seen, unfortunately, as a throwback to when kids movies didn't need to rely on flashy graphics or super-hip characters and settings to be entertaining. Current studios could use a dose of this adventurousness.",1137110400,58,2150,4.710106382978723
611330,5,6303206158,"I never liked dogs when I was a kid, mostly because I was a runt and they could pretty much eat me whole. Which didn't preclude me from liking the idea of dogs, or from loving this film way back when. On a nostalgia kick I bought it again and expected to have another aspect of my childhood destroyed upon being reminded of how horrible some of the things I liked back then actually are from an adult perspective (A few examples come to mind, but at least I won't have to contend with liking a few things on TV nowadays that will definitely have future adults cringing...).

Surprise, it's actually even more enjoyable now as an ""adult"". It's all as good as I remembered, or better.

When I was a child I never percieved it as a particularly ""dark"" film as so many claim it to be... Truthfully, the thing that has stuck with me over the years is the songs. They really are engaging and well written, not the squirm-fests that populate most children's films of any era. And while certain things stick out as not being acceptable in today's children's pictures (the drinking, and straightforwardness on topics such as gambling and murder), I definitely don't think that's the attitude that defines the film.

611375,5,6303206158,"All Dogs is such a wonderful movie. It tells a charming story about a neer-do-well junkyard dog named Charlie who rescues an orphan girl from an evil boss dog.

In the beginning of the movie Charlie is murdered by the evil dog, and goes to heaven, (all dogs do!) only to run away and go back to earth.  He is told he can never come back to heaven.

When Charlie gets back to Earth he rescues Ann Marie from the evil dog.  There are conflicts, and hard choices for Charlie and his new little friend. The movie comes to a dramtic climax and Charlie must make a very hard choice.  He does a heroically brave and right thing.  Charlie has redeemed his life of failure and misjudgements.  He has shown that deep down he is good hearted, selfless and caring.  He is no longer banned from heaven. It is very touching.

The story reminds me of the musical ""Carousel"" and Charlie is certainly inspired by Billy Bigelow. Both lived flawed lives, but were in their hearts very sincere and good. In the end of each story they redeem their lives with selfless good deeds and go to heaven. If you like the message of redemption in Carousel, you will like this movie.

The animation is wonderful old fashionedn non computerized. There are all sorts of positive messages for children about honesty, friendship, love, charity and loyalty. It has some scary stuff for very little children and may be too scary for them, but any child over the age perhaps eight or nine will love it.

Usually movies like these would be dumbed down so much that the movie would be, over the top, lame. The main character, Charlie Barkin, gets murdered by his partner Carface (appropriate name I think). Charlie cons his way out of heaven so he can seek vengeance on his killer, definitely something out of a gangster movie. I really think this movie should've been rated PG though because of much of the content in the movie. Like when Carface gets Charlie drunk (yes, drunk) before killing him. Also the scene in which Charlie dreams that he's in hell might scare the younger crowd. While Charlie maybe the protagonist, you'll most likely still call him an a-hole simply because of his selfishness. If you like gangster movies, there might be a slight chance you'll like this movie. The musical moments might kill some of the excitement but that's my opinion because I'm not a big fan of musicals.",1110931200,,1072,4.768817204301075

The lead character is gunned down in the first segment of the film, for instance.

The assault on Don Bluth's wondrous work continues with this DVD, which is totally devoid of the extras it deserves (widescreen and commentary, to name a few).

Sure I grew up with staples such as Bambi, Beauty and tbe Beast, and The Lion King, but I also recollect being hooked on All Dogs Go to Heaven, An American Tail, and The Land Before Time. Don Bluth's films are tragically overlooked. All Dogs Go To Heaven is a movie I still watch and enjoy now that I'm sixteen. It's a story about life and death. And Charlie is a great character because he's like an anti-rolemodel, but by the end, he's learned a lesson and become heaven-worthy. It's a story of redemption and full of heart. Highly recommended for all children. (Some parts may be a little scary for really small children, but parental presence is all that's necessary.)",1107129600,8,772,4.601449275362318

Really though, only a few parts of this film were scary (like that nightmare scene. That is FREAKY, even to this day!) This movie is definately darker, so I wouldn't show this to little tots. I reccomend 9 as a good age, any earlier and your kids could have nightmares...

An earlier reviewer said they were shocked at the content in this movie- yes, it does have drinking. It does have smoking. And murder. And betrayl. And Hell. It features gambling, guns, and all that- but guess what? So does the world we're living in. This movie was very realistic. Charlie isn't a role model figure. He's your average schmoe who just escaped the pound and was about to get back into a life that wound him up in the pound in the first place before he was killed. But he is forgiven anyways for it. And even more beautiful is, he was given a second chance. Technically, I still consider him dead, even after he comes back. He thinks he's seeking revenge on Carface, but instead he finds an orphaned little girl and he intends to kidnap and use her, but instead, finds himself careing for her. He looks out for her like a loyal dog would, and in the end, he sacrifices himself for her so she can live. He becomes a blessing to Anne Marie, and she becomes a blessing to him. She teaches him a valuable lesson. He didn't deserve to go to heaven in the first place, but he learns to love and in the end, achieves his salvation. ^_^

This movie has a very deep meaning, so it's for older kids and up. It's up to parents to tell their kids that Itchy and Charlie were lucky. Espically Itchy. Both dogs fell into all the temptations and pitfalls out there in the world, and Itchy was lucky to escape with his life. But just because these temptations are out there doesn't mean we have to give in to them. We can choose not to, like Anne Marie did. :)

I think this movie was a masterpiece.",1097971200,2,1987,4.293333333333333
611382,4,6303206158,"A world of warning I recomend unless you are an adolescent 10-12 or older  you do not want to watch the  this movie.  This movie has  gambling in it and thugs and some  old violence seen in the ganster movies.  It talks about Charley.
Charley was  a  naugty dog that carried only about himself.  The movie begins with Charlie and his pal Itch a wenner dog  breaking Charly out of prison.  I was real young when I saw this the first time about 9 maybe it scared the crap out of me.
Anni Marry who unfortunately was not put in the sequel and the Christmas movie.
Killer  and itch wer a hoot.  Carface, his thugs and King Gator not to mention the nightmare sequence when Charlie goes down into hell.  The party at the end when the river catches on fire kills  me.
I hated this movie at first because it made dogs look bad but now I love it. I would rent int but because it so old Blockbuster does not have it avilable to rent anymore.
The King Gator was  potrayed accurately as being savage.  He scared me  he was so big he was huge this alligator must have been about the size of a killer whale. About  Mabe  30 feet and  weighed probably about 30 tons probably.  Another reason the alligator scared me was he  came really close to eatting Charley.
Since it was rate G which I 100 percent disagee with I think I should have been either PG or PG -13 because of the scene befor this when Charlie  and Any Marry ar in the markeet air Carface is on top of this big gun.  He start shoot at charlie with I belivie it was a ray gun.
I just found out something really interest the King Gator is not a which doctor I thought he was awhich doctor becase he had a bone coming out of his nose.  Withc doctors  are belived to have supnatural abilities like to be able to steal  souls and stuff like that.
The only  thing that saves Charlies from die a painfull death inside the alligator stomach is his howl.  The people who wrote the script for some reason which I have never figured out made the King Gator a music fantic.
He thinks Charlie howl is beautiful he takes him out of his mouth.  In the chage with had been partly crushed by his huge teeth. Lets him loose and he refuse to eat Charlie instead the become friends.
This I fought was cease and one percent a cat and  a dog possible  like int Oddis and milo. But an alligator the most vicious of all the reptiles next to the crocodile impossible.
I also fought some parts where I human.  Like when carfcae ties Charlie up to a big Chain drops him into the water ro kill him was inhuman.  I also thought carface death at the end of the movie was in Human.  Come on you do not have a dog get devouured by and alligator in a movie that  hte book claims is appropriate for all ages rate G.
While wher eon it whats with these rating system people they need to be more pick those sickos only made Scare Movie R  It was  alot nastery than that.
If you like this see all dogs go to heaven 2.  I recomend that you don't see All dog Christmas Charlie which never should have been made. For it messed up  the whole Story line. Carface is not supposed to be alive he is supposed to be and he is supposed to be in Hell.",1084233600,,3150,4.115131578947368

It's not a movie for little kids, but it's a wonderful piece of animated art that is a refreshing new way of telling a story - I mean you can tell from beginning to end that this is not a Disney movie (not that Disney isn't good, I just think they shouldn't dominate the world of animated art alone).

So I was really happy to finally get it on dvd.

Time passed and as I was watching the end credits I was feeling very impressed and good.
So waddaya know, waddaya say? This movie is a true classic if you ask me. The Characters and their voices in particular are very good. Both Dom DeLuise and Burt Reynolds have done a great job and therefore it's very enjoyable to watch Charlie's story go further. I think the songs fit in pretty nicely too -ie. ""Soon You'll Come Home"" is good so are the others. What deserves a true thumb-up, however, is the animation - it's very good looking and surely 'feeds the eyes'.

Anne Marie is a darling character, adorable from every aspect. Especially her voice, which was done to perfection by Judith Barsi. I admit the villian is more than annoying, and not incredibly intimidating. The basic plot is good, and the animation is nice. Annabelle (The Whippe in heaven) is a slightly ditzy little creature, who is enjoyable enough in her little part. The songs are okay.

611513,4,6303206158,"I have not seen the DVD of this movie, but will comment on the movie itself:
With a movie based around dogs running a gambling (rat races) and bar joint, it already earns coolness factor among children's fare. As a child of about 9 when this movie was originally released (ten years ago) these references went straight over my head.  Strangely the movie is still entertaining, although slipping a bit into typical heartwarming stuff after the introduction of the little girl into the mix (who is being held by Charlie's - the German Shephard-like lead dog voiced wonderfully by Burt Reynolds - nemesis, Carface because she can talk to animals and thus know who will win the day's race.)
Set in New Orleans, the main plot (which the rest is filler really) is Charlie and his partner Itchy return to the joint that Charlie and Carface used to run together (up until Charlie was thrown into the clinker - the dog pound - until Itchy got him out, the great escape is where the movie begins) and under the guise of helping Charlie set up his own place, Carface holds a party at Mardi Gras where Charlie gets a little too sloshed and makes him an easy target for a cleancut murder.  All dogs go to heaven of course despite the fact there's little record of our lead actually doing any good in his earthly canine life, but heaven wasn't good enough for Charlie, he wants revenge, so he steals his watch of life, winds it back up and heads back down for Vengeance upon the ones who has done him wrong.  That's when his life gets entangled with the little orphan girl (called ""Squeaker"" by him through most of the movie after a rather cute scene which I won't spoil here), who he 'rescues' for 'using' her for his own selfish purposes instead of helping the child realize her dreams, but his coming to care for her in turn ends up leading to his own true salvation.
A very 'dark' film, in lighting and sometimes even in story, there's many morals to be found underneath, the biggest being that even imperfect people (or animals) have goodness in their heart, they only have to reach out and open their hearts to find it.  The badguys are truly bad although the lead villan's Chihuahua looking scrapgoat shows a kinder side sometimes, and are played out kind of like mobsters and not too over-the-top.  There are no ridiculous ambitions, simply the doing in of Charlie so that his claim to the business is his void (he'd be dead afterall), which is a refreshing pace from superhero movies.  The voice acting is very good in most cases, and a couple of the songs don't even make adults cringe too much (especially the one in heaven is quite nice).
A well done film throughout, which spawned a mediocre sequel and animated series.  However, there's no substitute for the original, which is one of the best animated movies to come out of the 90s period.  Children will love it, and adults will be able to watch it without feeling too ill or out of place, and those that grew up on it, probably still hold it close to their hearts.",976233600,19,3017,4.522935779816514

Then  our canine hero returns as an angel to perform some good deeds, including  the babysitting job with a little orphan girl who looks just like Snow  White in her childhood. And uhhh...the whole plot begins to take really  wild twists and turns as Charlie feeds a whole litter of stray pups pizza  (since when does pizza delivery exist back in the 1930s?), opens a gambling  carnival with his stubby-legged sidekick, runs into a HUGE crocdile who  thinks she is a bathing beauty, saves the pink-cheeked little waif from an  impending doom, and finally places her in a loving home before he could go  back to send all his eternity in heavenly bliss.

7841907,4,6303206158,"A great movie and a real nostalgia trip. My only gripe with this order is that the box doesn't match the pictures. I had hoped for the movie to come with the box shown--the one I used to love from my childhood. Instead it's that damned revised box art from the anniversary edition; the one where somebody broke Itchy's leg and Anne-Marie has Down's syndrome (also the croc is trying to cast a spell on Carface, for some reason. Maybe he knows Voodoo?). Not all box art is created equal, and it's time we stopped lying to ourselves and admitted it. What's more, I have a hard time believing this seller is the real Dom DeLuise.",1517270400,,626,4.405172413793103
