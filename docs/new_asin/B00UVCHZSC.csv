8708472,4,B00UVCHZSC,This is a decent enough version of Huck Finn. It's not too sappy and handles some of the tricky areas with a different slant.,1461283200,,125,4.25

8708475,1,B00UVCHZSC,"This film bears very little relation to the original novel. The screenwriter has just taken a few incidents from the novel and told his own story instead. The character of Jim in this film bears no relation to Twain's Jim. Instead we get a Jim who's a sophisticated and dapper urbanite (and who, despite being a slave, has wine with his dinner - where did he get the wine from?). Jim also seems to regard himself as morally superior to everyone else. He's an abolitionist who contemptuously refers to white man's law. The character of Huck also has little relation to Twain's character. He is not shown having any of the conflicts of the original novel. He doesn't go through any agonizing soul-searching, for example, before his decision to free Jim. He's also way too young and rather too well-fed with a soft squishy physique  more Huckleberry Fatt than Huckleberry Finn. One can't imagine that he has ever had to fend for himself.

Everything is sanitised and politically correct. Jim's an abolitionist, Judith Loftus is the post-feminist Strong Assertive Woman. The screenwriters have tried to enliven their tale with humour  but it has to be said that it is very 'German' humour consisting largely of fart jokes and crude slapstick. They would have been better advised to pay more attention to creating a coherent storyline. Throughout the film we are told that Huck and Jim are planning to live together in Ohio, but then at the end Huck returns to St Petersburg so that we can have a reunion with Tom Sawyer. Welcome though it is to see Tom again (he's a good-looking lad!), whatever happened to Huck's plan to accompany Jim?

Basically, the screen writers have not produced Twain's HF at all, but have just sampled some incidents and names from the story to make their own narrative, which is as flat and uninteresting as the Romanian landscape through which the characters pass, and as unconvincing as the CGI steamboats. As a matter of fact, the look of the movie is almost identical to that of the recent turkey of a film, 'Tom Sawyer & Huckleberry Finn', with Val Kilmer, Joel Courtney and Jake Austin. It seems that nowadays it is impossible for film-makers to make a decent version of Twain's novels. Oh well.",1437004800,6,2224,4.768831168831169
