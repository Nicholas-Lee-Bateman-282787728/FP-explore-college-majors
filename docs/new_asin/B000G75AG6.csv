2602063,5,B000G75AG6,"Myself being an Irish-American Catholic, this wonderful concert which the late, great Frank Patterson & Regina Nathan did with the Irish Philharmonic Orchestra & Chorus and so many guest soloists is without question a stirring ode to the Irish Catholic experience!  The hymns, sung in English, Latin & Gaelic are the most stunning ever.  The glorious chant of the Monks of the Cisterian Abbey in Ireland set the mood and joy for this wonderful salute to these classic religious hymns.  With the return of the Latin Mass in modern society, these anthems deserve another listen to.  You have got to get this for yourself; it's the greatest hymn of love ever presented!  It's no wonder this concert, based on Ireland's most loved and best selling albums ever, is worth your purchase price!",1152662400,4,786,4.924242424242424

I went with a friend who said the movie that came out before this one - ""God is not dead"" was much better.
