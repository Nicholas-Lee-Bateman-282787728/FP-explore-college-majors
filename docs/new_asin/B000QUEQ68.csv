2840349,5,B000QUEQ68,"This is were Dynasty really started.

As for why it took so long from [..]

Fans have been asking us where the second season of Dynasty is for awhile, and we're not surprised. The second season introduced Joan Collins as Alexis, and that's when the show really started to take off. Fox released the 15 episode first season in April, 2005, and we haven't heard a word about them continuing the series.

We called over there the other day, and Fox explained the situation to us. The first season didn't do as well as they had hoped (even taking into account that the show hadn't hit its stride yet), so they haven't scheduled any remaining season. There's a twist though; the rights to Dynasty go to Paramount in November, 2006, which means Fox wouldn't have been able to release the entire series anyway. Now that's good news for Paramount; Fox has already taken care of the first season and now they can jump in on season 2 (which should sell better than season 1 because it's more popular).",1180137600,,991,4.556179775280899
2840350,5,B000QUEQ68,Dynasty certainly took off with the start of season 2 and I am very happy that it is finally about to be released! No drama on television has lived up to the high bar set by the Carringtons!,1179792000,8,190,4.026315789473684
2840351,5,B000QUEQ68,"Finally the complete second season of ""Dynasty"" comes to DVD in August. After disappointing sales of the first season Fox gave the rights up to the DVD releases (thankfully) and Paramount now holds these rights. Originally airing from 1981-1982 the second season of ""Dynasty"" starts off with an electrifying story in which Alexis Carrington testifies at her ex husbands trial for the murder of their homosexuals son's lover Ted Dinard. This starts the stories in full motion as Alexis becomes the antagonist of nearly every character in the show. The Alexis character was also modeled after Iris Carrington from daytime's ""Another World"" who too was a rich female troublemaker. Joan Collins does a perfect performance as Alexis and it's hard to distinguish if Joan becomes Alexis or if Alexis becomes Joan but whatever the rate Joan Collins makes this season and makes this show what it become that year. The series quickly jumped into the top 20 Nielsen Ratings and would eventually go on to be  number 1 in America in 1985. The stories are told at a great speed with character depth as we see Steven, the gay son, trying to deal with who he is, even going so far as marrying a girl from the wrong side of the tracks named Sammy Joe ,played beautifully by a pre-""Melrose Place"" Heather Locklear. You will love the verbal spats between Sammy Jo and Alexis. Also the art direction is beautiful with gorgeous sets and who can ever forget the costumes. The season has 22 episodes and is a must for any true fan of prime time television. This was TV's first guilty pleasure. And lastly this is the season where Krystle and Alexis have their first cat fight in Alexis' studio. Way to go girls. Without a doubt the greatest primetime season ever of any soap opera. Enjoy!",1179792000,32,1765,4.73051948051948

2840365,5,B000QUEQ68,"Excellent! I was always curious about this show as my father often bragged he named me after one of the most infamous baddies on TV Alexis Carrington. I was too young to see the show in it's original run so I caught episodes here and there on Soapnet when it aired it and finally decided to just go ahead and purchase the DVD starting from season 2 since this is where Alexis first appeared.

The storylines and characters are all pretty intriguing. It is a little hammy and it can't help but be dated with the fashion but it is almost a glorious love letter to the excess of the 80s in every frame. The story of Steven's battle with his father and his homosexuality is really the heart of the show and I bet that was very daring back in it's day but Joan Collins is such a scene stealer as Alexis really it is all eyes on her and her schemes to destroy Blake and Krystle.

I am pleased to say the excitement hasn't aged a bit as I finished season 2 in several small binge watching sessions on the edge of my seat and I am now anxious to purchase season 3 via instant video to continue the saga of the Carringtons.",1411430400,2,1114,4.176744186046512

2840384,5,B000QUEQ68,"Dynasty was not what ABC thought it would be during its first 13 episodes, which aired as its first season in the spring of 1981. Season 1 wasn't terrible, it just wasn't the Dynasty everybody seems to remember. I remember watching season 1 and my mother asking ""Where's Joan Collins?"" and I told her that Ms. Collins didn't come in until season 2. Well, here she is... hold your hats... the bitchiest bitch of them all... the one we all love-to-hate... that grand English lady that Fallon vaguely remembers: Alexis Morell Carrington.

In the first episode of the second season, titled ""Enter Alexis,"" the mysterious witness removes her sunglasses to reveal British actress Joan Collins as a new arrival to the series. Collins' portrayal of Alexis Morell Carrington blazed a trail across the show and its storylines; the additions of Collins and the ""formidable writing team"" of Eileen and Robert Mason Pollock are generally credited with show's subsequent rise in the Nielsen ratings. The Pollocks ""soft-pedaled the business angle"" of the show and ""bombarded viewers with every soap opera staple in the book, presented at such a fast clip that a new tragedy seemed to befall the Carrington family every five minutes."" Alexis' testimony nonwithstanding, Krystle is immediately put off by the former Mrs. Carrington's condescending attitude and manipulations; Krystle's subsequent discovery that Alexis had caused Krystle's miscarriage by intentionally startling her horse with a gunshot settles Alexis as Krystle's implacable nemesis. Other new characters of the season are the psychiatrist Nick Toscanni (James Farentino), who tries to seduce Krystle while bedding Fallon and plotting against Blake, and Krystle's greedy niece Sammy Jo Dean (Heather Locklear), who marries Steven for his money. The season finale sees Blake left for dead on a mountain after a fight with Nick.

Dynasty's second season shows us the Dynasty-mania that made this soapy fun popular. This season is great, one of the show's best. So many back-stabs and surprises around every turn! I love this show and it just got better and better... until season 6 came anyways. It went downhill from there on out, but I still want all 9 seasons and the reunion movie!",1382832000,,2234,5.168508287292818

2840387,5,B000QUEQ68,It has always been my favorite nightime serial. Season 2 is great because it features the start of Joan Collins as Alexis. She makes the show for me. Her catfight with Linda Evans is a highlight. One serial you can watch over and over. Highly reccommended.,1372896000,,256,4.586956521739131

2840389,4,B000QUEQ68,"This 1981-82 Season of DYNASTY is where this drama about rich people humping around really hit its stride, especially since the arrival of British actress Joan Collins as Blake's scheming ex-wife(Alexis Carrington)and Heather Locklear as Krystle's foxy, but greedy niece(Sammy Jo Dean)brought a big surge in the Nielsen ratings & made this show very popular, since the ratings in its 1st Season of DYNASTY were quite unremarkable, but the addition of Alexis and Sammy Jo heralded DYNASTY's rise into the Top 20 in the Fall of 1981.

In addition to that, by 1984 DYNASTY was a top 10 show and by 1985, it was the #1 series on television, plus DYNASTY was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best TV Drama Series every year from 1981 to 1986, winning in 1984.

DYNASTY also spawned a successful line of fashion & luxury products and this show revolved around a wealthy oil family living in Denver, Colorado about a show pertaining to a bunch of rich people humping around who also had the best houses, the best cars, the best clothes,the best parties, the best dresses, the best looking suits, the best looking ladies, the best and most luxurious lifestyles, etc.; starting with the late John Forsythe as Oil magnate Blake Carrington & Linda Evans as Blake's new wife(Krystle Jennings)who had frequent rivalry with Alexis who was always either rolling on the floor or rolling in the sheets with Blake's rivals.

In fact, the steamy sex scenes, the catfights, especially between Krystle and Alexis and between Sammy Jo and Amanda(Catherine Oxenberg)are what kept the ratings on this show so strong for so long along with the fact that DYNASTY was the first TV show to use the word ""BITCH"" on television on top of that along with the fact that Joan Collins' character(Alexis)was the biggest bitch on television at the time just like Heather Locklear's character of Amanda Woodward on MELROSE PLACE was the biggest bitch on television in the mid 90's which nearly made DYNASTY MELROSE PLACE's predecessor along with the fact that people were often going to bed with each other on both DYNASTY and MELROSE PLACE.

George Peppard whose known as the brainy on-the-run Vietnam veteran(Col. Hannibal Smith)had auditioned for the role of Blake Carrington in the Fall of 1980, but was quickly replaced by John Forsythe since Peppard had difficulty dealing with the unsympathetic role of the patriarch Blake Carrington.

Unfortunately, DYNASTY dropped from #7 to #24 during its 1986-87 Season and then ultimately cancelled in the Spring of 1989 after a 9-year run on ABC, due to weakening in ratings.

DYNASTY's 2nd Season also takes me all the way back to memory lane to when we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had in 1981-1982 when Ronald Reagan was president and to when my mother and I used to look forward to watching this every Wednesday night at 10PM on ABC after watching THE FALL GUY at 9PM and THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO at 8PM.",1323043200,,2953,4.849206349206349
2840390,5,B000QUEQ68,"The ABC Network's answer to the hugely-popular primetime soap ""Dallas"", DYNASTY was created by Esther and Richard Shapiro to be the most flamboyant, daring and outrageous of all night-time drama series.  The lives of Denver's oil-rich Carrington family unfolded each and every week to the fascination of viewers all over the world, who couldn't get enough of their scandalous private affairs.

Fling on the shoulder pads and brew a pot of ""ghastly tea"", because this is where DYNASTY made it's real mark...

The second season opens with the arrival of Blake's first wife Alexis (Joan Collins) as the surprise witness in Blake's murder trial.  The one thing missing from the first season of DYNASTY was a real villainess, and Joan Collins' casting as the scheming Alexis gave the show a much-needed shot of adrenaline.  Whether she's rolling around on the floor with Krystle (Linda Evans) or rolling in the sheets with Blake's rival Cecil Colby (Lloyd Bochner), Alexis is a complete one-of-a-kind soap creation, an almost epic combination of old school wicked witch and one-woman demolition derby.  Did I mention the delicious studio catfight between Krystle and Alexis?  It's a doozy.

Claudia Blaisdel (Pamela Bellwood) awakens in the hospital to discover that Matthew has skipped the country with their daughter Lindsay, and is later pimped and  blackmailed by Cecil into stealing valuable documents from Denver-Carrington.  Things really go to pot when Claudia and Krystle struggle over a gun and Claudia's brain is literally shot to pieces - here comes ""Crazy Claudia""!

Fallon (Pamela Sue Martin) and Jeff (John James) break up, and make up...then break up some more...but in between they manage to conceive little Blake Junior who is born premature after Fallon was involved in an auto accident.  Nurse Susan Farragut (Christine Belford, aka ""Wonder Woman""'s duplicitous Baroness von Gunther) is assigned as the kid's nanny.  Should have smelled a rat right there...

New characters:  In addition to the amazing Alexis, Season 2 also boasts the arrival of Dr. Nick Toscanni (James Farentino), a psychiatrist/sometime neurosurgeon with an axe to grind about the role Blake (John Forsythe) played in his half-brother's death, who quickly falls into bed with Fallon and causes a few temptations for Krystle as well!  Krystle's ""gosh darn"" niece Sammy Jo (Heather Locklear) also comes to stay for a spell...looking for her own piece of the Carrington pie!

Fabulous fashions!  Steamy love triangles!  And Alexis!  It's all here in the second season of DYNASTY.

2840403,5,B000QUEQ68,"This is a review of the second season's worth of
""Dynasty,"" ABC's classic prime serial, from 1981-
82. As the title implies, this is the beginning of
the run of Alexis Morrell Carrington Colby Dexter
Rowan (here, just Alexis Morrell Carrington), one
of television's classic villainesses, played by the
great English actress Joan Collins. She came in at
the close of the first season and the opening of
this season to testify in the trial of Blake
Carrington, her ex-husband, who was on trial for
murdering Ted Dinard, homosexual lover of their son
Steven. Over the course of this season and the 22
episodes contained therein, you will witness Alexis
at her very best and wickedest, and she has many
defining scenes. In one of them, Alexis and Krystle
have a catfight in Alexis' studio because of
Krystle's anger at having lost her child. When it's
all over, the studio is in shambles. That was just
one of the defining moments of this season, of
which there are many (and all the other characters
have plenty, too).

Video:
The full-screen video that this season is presented
in is top-notch. There is some grain, and sometimes
the title sequence of each episode shows some
reprinting, but overall, CBS/Paramount did a
remarkable job cleaning up these episodes.

Audio:
CBS/Paramount also did a remarkable turn with the
audio presentation. The opening theme comes through
loud and clear, and so does the body of each
episode, as well as the closing theme. There is
English, Spanish and Portuguese audio, and there
are also subtitles in each language.

Bonuses:
Unfortunately, there is only one bonus (on Disc 6),
but it's quite disappointing. It is a text-only
family tree of some of the major players (Blake,
Krystle, Fallon, Alexis, Sammy Jo, etc.).
Interviews with the people who played these
characters (Forsythe, Evans, Locklear, Collins,
etc.) would have added a lot more depth.

Packaging:
The 22 episodes of this season are on 6 discs (four
episodes each on the first 5 discs, and the last
two on disc 6, plus the bonus). The discs are the
standard CBS/Paramount silver variety, and are
contained in a clear Amaray package, with the first
and last discs on the bottom left and top right
respectively, and the middle four on two trays,
with one disc on top on one side, and the other on
the bottom on the other side. The episode listings
are inside the case, but are covered somewhat by
the first and last discs. On the front of the
package, there is a group image of Blake and his
women, with the title ""DYNASTY: The Second Season""
at the bottom; the title is in a different typeface
(probably a block style) from the series title font
of Aurora. On the back, there is a huge photo of
Alexis, the defining character of this season and
of seasons to come, and a description of what's to
come in the season. There are also smaller images
of scenes from the episodes, and at the top, an
image of the mansion. At the bottom is some
technical information.

Menus:
The menus are somewhat bland still pictures, with
the episodes listed at right (Disc 6 has those and
an option for the bonus), plus a setup option below
and a ""play all"" option as well. Each menu has a
large image of one or two of the major characters,
and the ""Y"" image that opened each episode is seen
in the background.

Overall, this is (outside of #9) the greatest
season of ""Dynasty"" (mainly because of Alexis), and
CBS/Paramount's presentation is quite satisfactory,
but the impact of the episodes contained therein is
blunted somewhat by the lackluster family tree
bonus feature. Still, this second season's worth
comes quite highly recommended.",1260921600,2,3620,4.747217806041335

2840407,5,B000QUEQ68,"The second season of Dynasty introduces two new surprises that turn the Carrington household upside down and they will NEVER be the same.

The first surprise is Blake Carrington's estranged first wife, Alexis Carrington (Joan Collins). She is called in as a character witness in Blake's murder trial. She testifies about the years of neglect and abuse at the hands of Blake Carrington. What she does NOT testify about is the lifetime of secrets,lies, and personal vendettas to get even with Blake after all these years.

The second surprise is Krystle's estranged niece, Sammy Jo Dean (Heather Locklear). She is basically dumped on the Carrington doorstep by her father (who was married to Krystle's now deceased sister). What she brings with her is a lifetime of experience from learning how to survive on the ""wrong side of the tracks"".

 Both women are shunned and openly criticized by everyone even the household servants. They both find a friend and solace in Steven Carrington. Alexis from a maternal instinct and Sammy Jo from a survival instinct. By the end of the season, both women's fate is hanging in the balance as to how to get what they really want from the Carrington household. Will the two women be able to complete their plans for what they really want from the Carrington household? Sorry, you will have to wait until season 3 to find out.

This Season is also the last season that the original Carrington children actors work together. Al Corley leaves at the end of this season and Pamela Sue Martin follows suit a few seasons later. Although the characters were eventually replaced with good actors, these actors will always remain the originals in the true Dynasty fans' hearts.",1219708800,,1702,4.895833333333333

There never was, and there never will be again, a show like Dynasty.  Revenge, greed, lust, homosexuality, abortion, miscarriage, adultery--it's all here and it's a tasty treat indeed.

John Forsythe is the very image of corporate power and Linda Evans is a modern-day Melanie Hamilton, sweet and kind but with a steely resolve when it comes to family.  But it's Joan Collins who walks away with the show.  She doesn't get her ""look"" until about the 8th episode, and when she does it's a flashback to that super-sophisticated 1940s Hollywood glamour.  She wears her designer hats and turbans like a true diva, and delivers her acid-dipped lines with great style and flair.  You just can't look at anyone else when she's on screen.

Also, given our country's dealings in the Middle East, the show's setting in the business of oil gives it a very
contemporary feel.  After nearly 30 years, it's amazing how little the storyline has dated.",1214265600,,1003,4.898809523809524

Some of the scenes in Season One of Dynasty were so familiar with scenes on the Classic daytime soap Another World.

2840426,5,B000QUEQ68,"I watched Dynasty when I was a teen, and yeah, it was popular, everyone talked about it, etc., but I felt it was not as good as Knots or Falcon Crest at the time.  I found it's campy stiff acting laughable, and jeez, I was just a such a soap-snob believing this wasn't in the same league as ""real"" primetime soaps.  I was completely unappreciative of what a great soap opera this show had been.  I'm also shocked James Farentino ever got another acting job after tripping over the scenery he chewed.  Guy was Craptastic totally in melodrama-mode.

Once you get past the less Dynasty-like Season One with the boring Matthew and his *yawn* oil rig/family drama, Season Two kicks off and doesn't let up.

Joan Collins deserved every accolade she received for revitalizing this show and Alexis-centric season into what most people remember - an over the top serial about the rich and glamorous Carringtons.  Lets give the writers some kudos, too.

I thought I, at best, would find the DVD set a hoot and full of silly memories but instead found myself completely hooked.  A fun, melodramatic acid trip.

I do love extras, and yes, Paramount deserves a glass of champagne tossed in their face for doling out nothing but a sparse ""family tree"" with a few branches.  I wish they'd spring for some commentaries from the actors such as Ms. Collins, Ms. Evans, Ms. Locklear, & Ms. Martin (The men, too); but being as desperate for Dynasty as Sammy Jo was for Carrington leftovers, having no extras will not deter my collecting this entire Series on DVD.

2840436,5,B000QUEQ68,"I only got to see Dynasty when it was at its highest peak, that being the 1984-85 season.  By then, the show was campier than ever (""the Moldavia massacre"") and Pamela Sue Martin had left the series, only to be replaced by Emma Samms.

The second season of Dynasty showcases the show at its very best, when the series didn't venture into over-the-top and preposterous storylines, and the catfights between Krystle and Alexis were still fresh and invigorating.  And on top of that, you had Sue Martin, who stole every scene she was in, along with Collins.  The mother/daughter pair truly energized the show with their witty lines and naughty behavior.  Both Sue Martin and Collins had chemistry with every actor they worked with, and they gave the show the extra something it needed.

The only drawbacks were that Steven's character became less interesting, and more confused (his homosexuality was treated as a past indiscretion) and Lloyd Bochner's acting veered too much into camp territory to take him seriously as the show's villain.

But leave it to Sue Martin and Collins, and the growing cattiness between Krystle and Alexis to keep you entertained throughout this box set.",1189900800,2,1180,4.959390862944162

I do remember watching this the first go round, but hardly remember much of what I see, so it's practically all new again! Thank goodness for Joan Collins coming on and being the vile cat she was! This season is just the best!",1188432000,5,529,4.408163265306122
2840454,4,B000QUEQ68,"It's been a long wait but season 2 has finally been released. Hopefully it sells well and future releases follow on a similar timetable to the Dallas releases.

Season 2 is where the show really takes off, and watching these episodes again it's easy to see why.  The additions of spunky Heather Locklear and chic uber bitch Joan Collins - who in these episodes just seems so continentally exotic in comparison to the other California beauties inhabiting the cast that it's easy to see why she became Dynasty's superstar - are nothing short of inspired.

The show stayed white hot in terms of both storylines and ratings from this season through to the 1984-85 season, whereupon it descended swiftly into camp farce (albeit expensive camp farce), but in season 2 you get all the fun without the over-the-top stupidity of the show's later years: glamour, plotting, sex, conniving, and unexpected wit make season 2 of Dynasty utterly entertaining and very good fun.

You'll really enjoy watching these episodes - the plotting is top notch and the season's storylines simmer along nicely to a satisfying cliffhanger.  It's interesting to compare it to more recent prime time soaps, which are far more fast-paced.  Season 2 of Dynasty takes its time to get to the big plot pay-offs: many episodes pass between Alexis's causing Krystle's miscarriage (whilst wearing a truly hideous outfit) before Krystle figures it out and responds by creating the traditional Dynasty catfight.  It's the promise - and ultimate deliverance - of these delayed story payoffs that will get you hooked on the show.

The only gripe is the extras - an ""interactive"" family tree is not very exciting.  The rumoured Collins commentaries evidently did not materialise, and it's a shame the recent reunion show could not have been included.

But the lack of extras aside, you'll whizz through these episodes before you know it because the stories and the cast are all very compelling and great fun to watch.  It was really Dynasty's prime era - before it became just too over the top and collapsed under the considerable weight of its own glamour sometime in 1985.

They really don't make 'em like this anymore.",1188345600,5,2179,4.93972602739726
2840455,4,B000QUEQ68,"Season One of the classic serial sets up the story of the Carringtons and their circle at  a very thoughtful pace.  In Season Two, everything is gleefully torn apart and while the Carringtons suffered, the viewers benefitted.  It's said that Season Two is one of the best in the entire series, and I can say from watching each episode unfold, it's a nonstop party.  Marriages are jeopardized, affairs (or near affairs) unfold, confrontations happen regularly, cars crash; no wonder the ratings rose during this season.  The most obvious reason is, of course, the addition of Joan Collins as Blake's ex-wife Alexis.  By shaking up the Carrington balance, the villainy shifted from Blake to Alexis.  Collins is wonderful and walks in like she owns the show, although some of the wigs she sports are unfortunate.  A very young Heather Locklear also debuts as Sammy Jo who's quickly seduced by the rich life.

There are some drawbacks to the revamped show.  Pamela Bellwood as fragile Claudia, who brought so much grace to the show in the first season, spends a large part of the second season only appearing once an episode.  Al Corley seems to have lost his enthusiasm for the character of Steven, and indeed, he would exit the show at the end of the season.  Plus, James Farentino is terrible as Doctor Toscanni and his storyline never ignites, despite the number of storylines in which he's involved.

There are very few extras on the DVD, but I hope this won't stop anybody from taking a look.  People have waited long enough for Season 2, so let's hope there won't be such an interminable wait for Season Three.",1188259200,3,1613,4.776173285198556

Please do not hesitate to put out the remainder of the Dynasty season through season 9... even the ones that were not so great... there is still an audience for them.

Thank you and keep 'em coming!

P.S. Don't you agree that Joan Collins lit this show up like a fireworks display and shot it right into the stratosphere of television legend?",1188000000,,592,4.221238938053097
2840457,5,B000QUEQ68,"Joan Collins as Alexis, Pamela Sue Martin as Fallon and John Forsythe as Blake Carrington are such excellent actors and fit in so perfectly as these characters that I'm easily immersed in the story and lose all track of time...

 I put in the first dvd thinking I could watch one hour long episode then go shopping but I was wrong. These episodes are very addictive and I ended up watching 2 straight dvd's before falling asleep at 1am!

 Blake is charming but ruthless while Jeff played by John James is handsome and noble. Fallon and Alexis steal the show with their incredible acting. Emma Samms never did justice to the Fallon character after Pamela's leaving the show. Heather Locklear also arrives as the daisy dukes wearing Sammy Jo.

 I have 4 more dvd's full of episodes left and I'm dying to watch them all! I hope they get the 3rd and 4th seasons out soon since Dallas has theirs out already.

 The front box cover is absolutely gorgeous, the six dvd's are neatly arranged in a nice set that takes up the same space as a double dvd set... The picture quality is visually stunning considering these shows were made in the early 1980's, they look clear, crisp and sharp with no flaws.

How the DVD's are packaged inside, hard to get out.  Boring, grey, not exciting to look at.

The discs stay on the their spindles beautifully and are pristine and unscratched when you get them home.

Aside from a couple small instances where the source material clearly had some issues and couldn't be easily fixed, these episodes look better now than they did when they first came out.

Season 2 represents Dynasty on the runway and gaining momentum for take-off with the arrival of Alexis and it's such a shame they killed of Cecil Colby's character so early.

It's widely felt that Seasons 1, 2, 3, and 9 were it's finest.",1187913600,3,876,4.589743589743589
2840460,5,B000QUEQ68,"YES!!

After a long and torturous gap of years of waiting  -- during which time lucky ""Dallas"" fans were able to get 7 seasons of their favourite show issued to DVD -- finally we ""Dynasty"" fans have something to cheer about too.  At last the red tape transferring legal rights has been taken care of and a new company that seems to appreciate the value of this show has taken over the DVD issuing.  Let's hope this means the remaining seasons will now continue to come out in a timely fashion.

After waiting SO long, at long last the incomparable Joan Collins once again graces my TV screen with her ravishing presence.  I felt so let down when she did not even appear at all in the Season 1 set I bought.  Without her, ""Dynasty"" seemed bland and somehow lacking its usual spark.  Now finally I get to see the ""Dynasty"" I had been longing to see again.

The packaging for this set is slightly different from the Season 1 set that I bought years ago.  Instead of individual slipcases for each pair of discs, I was amazed to find all 6 discs fitted inside a single case only slightly thicker than a standard 1-disc case.  Usually this means some kind of system in which the discs are layered on top of each other and we must risk damaging them every time we pop one out to get at the one below.  But not so here.  This is a brand new case design I have never seen before, and each disc is completely independent of the other discs and quite safe.  I find this quite a good and effective design, and I think it will save a lot of space on my overcrowded and ever-growing DVD shelf.

Just a couple of minor quibbles.  First, as others have mentioned, the traditional ""last time on Dynasty"" intros have been chopped from all of the episodes.  I had always found these quite useful in refreshing my memory on the often intricate plot -- especially if I had not watched for a week or two.  And second, unlike the Season 1 set, there are no extra interviews or featurettes here, just a ""Carrington family tree"".  I would love for them to interview more cast members (especially the ones advanced in age who might not be with us much longer).  And how about some episode commentaries too?  I'd love to hear what Joan Collins and Linda Evans have to say about all their catfighting!  In this respect the set is a bit bare-bones.  But...I guess I should be grateful just to have this on DVD at all.

Hard to believe we have to say that for this show that topped ratings for nearly a decade round the world in its day.  But I guess the studio execs have more important things on their minds these days, like the latest pathetic waste-of-time reality show or moronic American Idol clone.  Ah well, at least now I have something good to watch so there's no need for me to be subjected to such garbage.

I just hope they hurry up with the release of  Season 3, because this one is so good I'm going to be through it in no time!",1187740800,12,2913,4.314917127071824

Claudia plays a large role and is borderline mad in her grief over lynsey, succumbing to blackmail and bed hopping to get information on her missing daughter. Sammy-jo marries Steven and charges expensive minks to Blake, lets it slip that Blakes isn't her father to Fallon & generally looks willowy and sexy throughout! This series is the first that introduced the famous ""scraps"" between Alexis and Krystle where Krystle emerges victorious at the end! Jeff loves and looses Fallon to Nick Toscini but gains a son.

I was not that bothered that the recaps were missing, if I could have had one, the recap for season 1 would have been handy, especially since we've had to wait so long for season 2 on dvd (2years 4 months). I hope Paramount release season 3 pretty soon can't wait for the lily pond catfight, I was so pleased with season 2 I have high hopes for future seasons.",1187049600,2,592,4.285714285714286
2840477,5,B000QUEQ68,"Well I was only 11 when DYNASTY premiered in 1981, but Alexis (Joan Collins) drew me in week after week. Yes, season two was the real beginning for DYNASTY; Joan Collins joined the cast as the devious ex-wife to Blake Carrington (John Forsythe), a constant nemesis to Blake's new wife, Krystal (Linda Evans) and mother to their children, Steven and Fallon. Another new face on the scene was Sammy Jo (Heather Locklear), a gold-digging parasite who gave Alexis a run for her money throughout the rest of the series.

Season two features the first cat-fight between Krystal and Alexis , in Alexis' studio, Sammy Jo married sexualy confused Steven, Fallon questions who her father is, and so on. I have to agree with other comments I've read here. It would be nice to have the recaps. DVD releases of Dallas have put previews before each episode and as I recall, both series had recaps before each episode and previews after. I'm thrilled DYNASTY is finally coming out, but it would be nice to have the whole Wednesday night show there, previews included. It's not going to desuade me from buying these by no means, but hey, why not go for the gold, this is DYNASTY, isn't it?

Also, why does everybody say that season 2 and 9 were the best? Granted, season 9 was excellent since most shows have run out of steam by then. I thought season 3 was a match to Dallas' season 3, when JR was shot. At the end of season 3, everybody hated Alexis and threatened to kill her. Sure enough, that was the season she was locked in that burning cabin with Krystal. The only seasons that lost my attention were 7 and 8. Somehow season 9 bounced back and I fully expected a 10th season. I hope the 1991 miniseries is releaed too, tying up the sloppy loose ends left in 1989 with the usual cliff hanger.",1187049600,3,1783,4.5

2840482,5,B000QUEQ68,"Seasons 1, 2 and 9 were easily the series' best years.

Season 1 was actually an intelligent (!) offering, but it was Season 2 that really got the balance right with the wicked ex-wife Alexis living in the art studio; her rivalry with Blake's new wife, Krystle; Alexis' scheming, manipulating, abusing, etc.; the series' National Enquirer tone.

It looked like DYNASTY was going to become the best TV show ever made...

But after that, the producers no longer seemed to have a story they felt compelled to tell. From Season 3 thru 8 the show and it's writing just got worse and worse and worse: illogical, stiff, self-conscious, shallow, uninspired, perversely unfocused, and even dull---- the program's quality recovering only in wonderful Season 9 when the key cast was dwindling and it was really too late.

But savor Season 2--- it's the year that put DYNASTY on the map, and the year the show was always trying, however incompetently, to get back to.",1185667200,6,955,4.840490797546012

Also I loved season 1 - it introduced us to the Carringtons and Krystles struggles from being a simple everyday girl to living up to the rich and their ways-I LOVED WATCHING HER learn the ways of the rich and still beliving in her own values-  ok- I am ready for the dvds now.............bring it on..............thanks,1185235200,3,1044,4.2462311557788945

2840496,5,B000QUEQ68,"At long last this long awaited 2nd season of ""Dynasty"" is out on DVD!
I agree that Joan Collins debut as superbitch Alexis really give the series a much needed boost.
I did also enjoy the first series thanks to John Forsythe,Linda Evans and particularly Pamela Sue Martin as the one and only orginal Fallon.
In fairness to Emma Samms who took over the role later,Fallon Mark2 spent her two seasons on ""The Colbys"" in tears but when Fallon returned to ""Dynasty"" later,the character was like her old strong self.
I also really liked Pamela Bellwood as the tragic Claudia,who lost her husband Matthew and daughter Lindsay,after season one(although Matthew did make a dramatic comeback at the end of season 7)she survived so much,only to die in the ""La Mirage"" fire at the end of season6.
It was a shame that Al Corley left in season2(due to being unhappy at Steven suddenly getting a glamorous young wife)he was so good in that part,Jack Coleman too over the role,although good too,Al Corley was the better Steven.
The new villian in season 2 was Nick(James Farentino)the Doctor with a grudge against Blake,thankfully Alexis really became the central villian and Nick disappeared after the 2nd season.
I was lucky enough to see the Joan Collins theatre show in England last year,she looked great and was so funny,she doesn't take herself too seriously and appreciates her fans,confirmed to me,when a requested signed picture was duly sent.
So like a lot of fans I agree that Dynasty really gets going when Alexis crosses the courtroom at Blake's trail and takes her hat off,enter Alexis!",1182643200,8,1584,4.892193308550186
2840497,5,B000QUEQ68,"It is great to see Season 2 finally appearing on DVD--this is the season where everything came together, and the characters and plot-lines exploded.  Contrary to what a previous review states, Joan Collins, who first appears in episode 1 of this season, wasn't brought in to ""save the show"":  her engagement was to be a brief story arc (the role was originally offered to Sophia Loren, who declined it).  The character proved so popular, that Joan was signed on a regular cast member.  ""Dynasty"" would remain strong for the next several seasons before it devolved into lunacy just as it was spining-off ""The Colbys"" as a separate series; during this time, Pamela Sue Martin left the series and the character of Fallon was later resurrected by Emma Samms, who--try as she may--just couldn't pull it off.  While the spin-off got off to a rocky beginning before making marked improvements while paring down its over-large cast, ""Dynasty"" continued to languish, mired by insipid plotlines (a fake Krystle?); in its second--and final--season, ""The Colbys"" was regarded by critics as the best-written soap on evening television, but viewers never caught on to the spin-off because of the strong counterprogramming by NBC (""Cheers"" was in its prime during that timespan).  ""The Colbys"" was cancelled after a stunning finale (aside from an odd Fallon/UFO encounter that came out of left field); Jeff and Fallon returned to ""Dynasty"" as it slowly, slowly improved and eventually put on a stellar final season.  The final season easily rivalled the early ""glory"" seasons in terms of plot and character development--during which the tired character of Krystle was written out, Emma Samms finally grew into the role of Fallon, and Sable Colby (Stephanie Beacham) was brought back as a stunningly-crafted nemesis for Alexis.  Joan was preparing to leave if ""Dynasty"" had it been renewed for another season; the producers had Diahann Caroll set to return as Dominique Devereaux to fill Joan's  stilettos.  Unfortunately, all but the most die-hard fans had given up on ""Dynasty"" by this time because of it its past years of mediocrity, so even the turnaround in its last year could not save ""Dynasty"" and it was cancelled.  The reunions which followed were disappointing.",1181606400,9,2256,5.119891008174387
2840498,5,B000QUEQ68,"It is well known that Fox Studio did not even know its own product. Season 1 of Dynasty was bad, which is why Joan Collins was introduced in Season 2 to lift the ratings. She did so amazingly. So what did Fox do? After disappointing Season 1 DVD sales they decided to CANCEL future Dynasty releases without doing their research or talking to fans. They have lost alot of money by being stupid and not knowing what their fans want. Perhaps they should have released Season 1 and 2 together from the start in 2005. This is what Paramount, who have taken over the rights, are doing. They are re-releasing Season 1 in a boxset with Season 2.  Or, you can just buy the great Season 2 on its own.

While it is very good news to FINALLY see Season 2 coming on DVD, it is bad news to see stupid film companies still taking their time releasing old TV shows on DVD when the format has been around for 10 years now. It's just not good business sense. Consumers want to see quicker releases for seasons. We don't want once a year like the Warner idiots have done with DALLAS.  Hello!

I'll be first in line for Season 2 of Dynasty. I would like Paramount to prove me wrong about the film companies by releasing subsequent episodes of Dynasty on DVD as quickly as possible.  Us fans deserve as much after the embarrassing three year wait for Seaon 2.

Bring on the catfights with Alexis, Krystle and Sammy Jo.",1181520000,53,1397,4.3538461538461535

2840500,5,B000QUEQ68,Finally season 2 is being released!  This is when the show got really good.  Season 1 was a bore.  Season 2 was great because that's when Joan Collins came in.  They should have her be front and center on the DVD box because it's thanks to her that the show lasted as long as it did.  She brought some much needed spice to the show.  And who could forget the infamous cat fights?  Can't wait for this release!,1180742400,8,409,4.166666666666667
