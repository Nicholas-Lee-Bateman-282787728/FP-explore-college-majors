8176193,1,B000NA26QI,"I loved Gallagher back in the day but don't get these shows.  Worst shows I've ever seen.
He has gotten so bitter and it really shows.  Crude & Rude.",1372118400,4,149,4.103448275862069
8176194,5,B000NA26QI,I've followed Gallagher for many years and even saw him perform in person. He's funny because he speaks the truth about so many subjects and makes them funny! Love him after all theses years..devoted fan here!,1357257600,,209,4.833333333333333
8176195,1,B000NA26QI,"This was very disappointing.  I am an old fan of Gallagher, but this video does not live up to his norm.",1231804800,5,104,3.9523809523809526
8176196,3,B000NA26QI,"The show was one of the most unorganized, which I expect a little from since it's live but not quite this extreme. There were lines being forgotten and goofy computer animated scenes in between acts. Gallagher usually does something along these lines in his shows, but the material wasn't there to counteract it. It's definitely worth watching, but it's not going on the shelf with his Sledge-O-Matic collection.",1185235200,7,412,5.073529411764706
