8324779,5,B0000TAZPQ,"Buy this now if you are a fan! The footage ranges from excellent broadcast quality to hand-held grainy video but what is captured is pure Westerberg in all his ragged glory. The sound quality is ok depending on the original source of the footage. Most of the songs are live in their entirety but some of the songs are cut short by edits especially ""Alex Chilton"" and ""Never Mind"". Also in-store performances at Tower, Amoeba and Virgin are shown. There is a lot of backstage footage of Paul getting ready and several interviews with Paul talking about Bob Stinson and record company hassles. It's cool to see his pre-performance demeanor. Also there are some performances of Paul in his studio and several ""videos"" of new songs. All in all a great dvd for Replacements/Westerberg fans and those just discovering them/him.",1068595200,2,821,4.871428571428571
