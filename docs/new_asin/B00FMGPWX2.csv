6014610,5,B00FMGPWX2,"I had to give ""Black Water Vampire"" five stars for breaking out of the ""same ol' same ol'"" mold from which many ""found footage"" movies are spawned. The acting was decent, and I was extremely impressed with the creature. I know many people run the other way when they discover a movie is of the ""found footage"" genre or when they see certain buzzwords on the DVD review (a group of filmmakers set out to...), but as many of my fellow reviewers stated, this is definitely worth checking out.

Incidentally, I saw this while working in the Texas oilfields a few nights ago... When I got out of my truck to go check fluid levels, fifty yards ahead of me in a clearing in a field, a winged creature touched down. I stopped dead in my tracks and my blood ran cold, even colder than the 31 degree temperature. Seconds later, I saw that  it was an owl. I breathed a sigh of relief, returned to my truck and laughed.

6014618,5,B00FMGPWX2,"Found footage films are now routine and there are many ordinary examples but sometimes you stumble across a good one. Black Water Vampire falls into this category. It's another instance of a group of people heading off into the woods to solve some type of mystery. In this case, following the story of a number of young women who have been murdered in the Black Water region. As usual, there is no mobile phone coverage and once they get there, they get lost. It sounds ordinary, but the story is told well, the acting is good and the vampire is gradually revealed, has great makeup and is entirely creepy. There are elements of other, more famous horror films 'borrowed' from but I won't name the main contributor as it will spoil the ending.

In fact, she spends most of her time pouting/screaming at her crew. I can certainly overlook these shortcomings if the film is creepy enough, but a puddle of blood here and there in broad daylight does not create any sense of atmosphere. It actually spells ""silly.""

6014633,3,B00FMGPWX2,"I'm a big fan of found footage horror, though I do openly admit that there are a lot of bad ones. This one in particular wasn't mind blowing, I can say that I would maybe watch it again if a friend wanted to watch it with me. Overall though, I have to give this movie props, because it was very well acted, the special effects also were very well done.
The trailer pretty much explains the movie, so if you liked the trailer or found it interesting, than thats basically what you are getting as far as plot and approach.
My biggest gripe with this movie, and this happens with a lot of found footage films, is no one brought any sort of weapon, not even a Leatherman, or pocket knife. This continues to be a lacking theme in many of the ""lost in the woods"" style found footage. Now I understand from a story purview of helplessness this is probably why this is avoided. As well as from a production cost, Im sure the amount of safety, stunts and so forth it would cost a lot more to have weapons being used. Though in my opinion, when I have seen FFH movies like this one, where the characters show a level of intelligence and adaptability to the situation to fashion or use weapons as well as pretty sound motives to defend themselves (Exists comes to mind as a good example of this) it actually makes the movie more scary, because it draws you in with the characters more. Most people who watch these, including myself, are thinking of ways as the story gets deeper for the characters to jerry rig, or find some way to protect or defend themselves.
Anyways, long story short, this is a well-made found footage movie, which is worth a watch, especially if you particularly enjoy this style of horror. Dont expect to have your mind blown, but you will be overall fairly satisfied by the end of the film.",1426636800,,1803,4.385074626865672
6014634,3,B00FMGPWX2,"**NO SPOILERS**

I just watched this one, twice. This is one of those found footage b-movies that walks a fine line between being a decent horror film and a cheesy microbudget disaster. Honestly, I understand why this movie has such a rare wide-ranging disparity in reviews.

It starts out identically to all found footage, kids-investigating-a-mystery-in-the-wilderness films. That said...

Where this film succeeds 1.) camera work, and 2.) acting. The actual HD quality was excellent, but more importantly the framing of shots, etc, was really well done. In addition, there is actually some quality acting. In fact, I think the actors were just handed some truly lame dialogue, which really handicapped them as far as what they had to work with. As a result, the characters often presented as a dry reading from a lousy script. Good job, though, to three of the four leads: ""Rob,"" ""Andrea,"" and especially ""Anthony,"" who did a great job for the first 75% of the film.  Danielle, the lead, was oddly inconsistent and the role probably would have been better placed in the hands of a more experienced actress. Too often she comes off as not having practiced her lines enough and too often was either stilted, overacting, but ultimately just wasn't believable. The ""townies"" were notably hit and miss, talent-wise - ""Sally Barnham"" and ""John Miller"" are old pros, for example, while the others ranged from decent to c-movie-horrible.

Where this film fails 1.) dialogue, 2,) acting, 3) directing, and 4) a total lack of scares, thrills, and chills. The dialogue is easily the worst part of this film, and the screenwriter seemed to hsve locked himself in a room and written dialogue that looks good on paper but doesnt translate as ""real"" when put in the hands of the actors. The director is ultimately responsible for all these so, the positives and the negatives can be placed at his feet (note to director - the ""spooky"" childrens' song replay during the drive was really unnecessary and a good example of the hit and miss of this film).

Kudos to the CGI team, by the way. I honestly found it difficult to discern between CGI and practical special effects when the monster (on the DVD cover, so I'm pretty sure it's no spoiler to point out there's a monster) made some of its appearances.

Oh amd fair warning for the kids... there's a full frontal female scene (but completely unsexy, as you'll see)...

OK... and correct me if I'm wrong, but... is that Stephen King at the 1:20:00 mark?",1424563200,3,2491,4.844705882352941

It's hard to understand why someone being attacked by a monstrous vampire continues to film.

6014668,3,B00FMGPWX2,"Does Black Water Vampire borrow from more successful horror movies?  I wouldn't call it 'borrowing.'  Lots of good films borrow.  Troll Hunter borrowed from the Blair Witch Project, which in turn borrowed from Cannibal Holocaust.  While these films were obviously influenced by other films, none of them outright plagiarized, which is more what this felt like.  I suspect they simply took the Blair Witch script and rewrote it, careful to change just enough to avoid copyright infringement.  While this was enough to placate the legal system, I feel that if this script were turned into a high school drama course, the writer would be called out on academic dishonesty.

Did it stop there?  Oh no. They also threw in rubbery bat-men from Coppola's Dracula (and a dozen other films at this point,) and tacked on a spooky homage to ""Freddy's Coming for You"" because hey, it's not like we want any semblance of realism in a lost tapes movie.  Still, Blair Witch was obviously the main focus of this opus.

This is sad, really, as if there's one thing they should have borrowed from Blair Witch, it would have been its genuinely creepy, gritty atmosphere.  Black Water Vampire came across as too polished.  You could tell that the lighting was staged, the sound had been edited (and a very obtrusive soundbite of an owl hooting foleyed into almost every night scene, because hey, owls are SPOOOOKY,) that the characters had proper camera harnesses to reduce the kinetosis-inducing shake common to the lost tape genre, and that when the director wanted you to see the monsters he paid good money for, the harnesses are ditched for a proper tripod.  This combined to nullify any suspension of disbelief this movie had going for it.

They should have also taken a lesson from Blair Witch in crafting a plot that made sense.  Remember the part where the kids in Blair Witch didn't have cell phones or GPS?  This made an immense amount of sense at the time as it was 1999 and these technologies were not as pervasive (or cheap) as they are today.  The Black Water filmmakers, meanwhile, live in a more modern era (one of the crew were recruited via Craigslist,)  so why are they using paper maps?  Better films have dealt with this by having cell phones that lose reception or GPS units that go haywire,  but not this flick.  Our heroes are apparently the only teens in the world that don't have cell phones and bloody Facebook.

The ""old coot"" who took the blame for the murders also doesn't make a lot of sense.  First off, they keep referring to him as being an 'old pervert' at the time of the murders.  Yet when we meet him, the dude's obviously in his fifties.  If he's in his fifty at the time of the filming, he would have been in his forties or late thirties at the time of the original murders (which took place when our heroes (in their twenties) were little kids.)  Unless we're going by GAP standards, that's hardly 'old.'  I'm also not 100% as to how the authorities suspected a human being of drawing the victim's blood out through a clearly inhuman bite in the neck.  It has a bit of the Dracula VS Billy the Kid logic going for it.

Without giving too much away, the monsters also didn't make a whole lot of sense.  In Blair Witch, the witch left behind piles of stones and little man-figures.  Did this make much sense?  Well, no, not really, but witches in myth/literature were mysterious figures who took part in rituals and arcane rites, so it's justifiable and atmospheric.  Why are vampires drawing inverted ankh-things with what is obviously spray paint on a tree?  Unless it's some sort of Stephanie Mayer reference, I just don't it.  It's like they were simply expecting the audience to accept the 'creepy' graffiti based on what had happened in the Blair Witch Project then on anything established within the plot itself.

The monsters also don't seem to have a solid MO.  When they talk of the attacks the film makers are investigating, the vampires generally bite people on the neck, but also sometimes behead them.  Why?  Never discussed.  Maybe they're going into hairdressing and couldn't afford one of those mannequin head things.

So, we have a derivative film that blows its suspension of disbelief.  Is that horrible?  Not really.  The acting, while a little cheesy and (again) derivative of better films, was actually pretty good, the build up was pretty good, and the payoff was definitely... well, I wouldn't call it GOOD, but it was definitely present.  The film managed a few pretty spooky scenes, and even though we've seen the rubber bat men a dozen times before, the director manages to pull them off without overdoing them.  For me, this makes it worthwhile as a $4.95 Saturday afternoon kind of film.",1394064000,2,4737,4.714981729598051

The movie follows the Blair Witch plot a little too close for comfort. There are tales of murder, of cabins in the woods, remote town, strange symbols on the trees, fighting hikers, confession"" video, lost map, etc.

The lead character is really annoying. Her acting is bad.

There are plot holes galore. One of the glaring ones is the lead is raped by the vampire. The next night she has the baby. Yep, it grew quick! But at the end of the film, they are giving the baby a one year old birthday party...and it's still an infant. The rate it grew in a day does not match the size of the baby at one year.

There were four young women murdered on December 21 over the past 40 years. One a year. But in this film, three people get murdered in one night.
