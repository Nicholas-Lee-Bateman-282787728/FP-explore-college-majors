Videos like Iron and Wine's ""Naked as we Came"" are undeniably beautiful while ""We will Become Silhouettes"" by The Postal Service is sure to get its share of laughs.  A great compilation all in all.  I cannot, however, get past the disturbance that is the Ugly Cassanova video.  That idea I had of throwing a party with this DVD playing in the background...yeah...shot.  Thanks, Sub Pop, for the obligatory gross-out video.",1151020800,,628,4.672727272727273
