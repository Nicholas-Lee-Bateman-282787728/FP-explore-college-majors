Starts out giving credence to ""catastrophism"" explanations of geologic features from large-scale local now-accepted flood evidence.  Missoula flood and others.  Google earth used.  Some information given as to reasons of the rejection of ""catastrophic"" explanations in geology in the 1900s.

One interesting point was about the evolutionary time scale.  Why do single celled creatures supposedly stay single cell creatures for 62% (2.875Myr) of supposed earth history (4.5Byr), when according to Darwinian evolution, mutations are especially important for small creatures due to a larger impact on a small genome, and that single cell creatures have many generations in a shorter time.  Also why do supposed human evolution, take only 0.002% of earth history to evolve, when they are the most complex creatures with largest genomes and longer generation times?

Another point from Dr Silvestru:  ""Neo-darwinianism says that evolution happens too slowly so you can't see it happening in the rocks.  Punctuated equilibrium says the opposite, that evolution happens too fast in bursts so you can't see it happening either in the rocks""

This lecture is not about radio dating methods,  but rather other related and interesting topics.
