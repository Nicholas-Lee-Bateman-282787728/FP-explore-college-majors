4481862,4,B004V6F94Q,"NOTE:  I received a free review copy of this DVD from the instructor.

This DVD is a follow-up to instructor Tracey Mallett's popular&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tracey-Mallett-The-Booty-Barre-Total-New-Body/dp/B0046BAAUE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tracey Mallett-The Booty Barre-Total New Body</a>&nbsp;DVD.  Although the original Booty Barre was quite tough, Booty Barre Plus Abs & Arms (or BB+) kicks things up a notch.  As the title would suggest, this DVD offers more work for both the arms and the abdominals, and Mallett also places a greater emphasis on the core throughout the workout.  However, this is still Booty Barre, and so there is still plenty of work for the glutes as well.  Props required for this workout include a sturdy chair, a light set of dumbbells, a small ball (one like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/9-Body-Back-Ball-Pump/dp/B00374O8JK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">9"" Body Back Ball & Pump</a>&nbsp;would work well), and a mat.  Mallett is working out in the same studio she used for the original Booty Barre, and there are four female background exercisers, one of whom shows some modifications.

The Main Menu of the DVD offers options to either Play All or to select each of the four chapters individually. I have described each section of the workout in detail below (times in parentheses are approximate).

FUSION WARM-UP (6.5 minutes)
Mallett incorporates some dynamic yoga-type movements into the warm-up, such as chair pose with pedaling the feet and pulsing lunges.  She also includes stretches designed to open the hips, but these felt too intense too soon--e.g., leg pulses performed from a standing splits position.  The warm-up concludes with sumo squats and side leg lifts.

KILLER ARMS (14 minutes)
For the arms work, Mallett suggests 3-5 lb. weights.  She and the crew basically perform three circuits, with the first two circuits each being repeated once.
*Circuit 1:  on toes for pec flies, high side bicep curls, and punches; curtsey lunge with leg kick/front arm raise
*Circuit 2:  on toes for shoulder circles, high front bicep curl, chest press, shoulder press, and lat pull down; finish bent over for windmill (alternating arms pull back)
*Circuit 3:  begin standing for tricep lifts rear, add alternate leg lift; go to floor for about 2 minutes of tricep dip variations

BOOTY BARRE & ABS (34.5 minutes)
As with the original, BB+ uses a chair for the barre work, but a ball is also used for some of the moves.  There are four total barre circuits; with the exception of the final circuit, Mallett ends each with brief ""cardio""--just like in the original BB, the cardio involves coming around to the front of the chair and performing jumping plank-type moves (a.k.a. mountain climbers).
*Circuit 1 (side to chair):  on toes for plies, wide-legged plies, and open fourth position (stepping both forward and back); also grand plies, deep squats, and pelvic tucks; cardio starts in down dog position (upside down V), then 3 pulses to ""pike,"" or jump in the air (balanced on hands only)
*Circuit 2 (side to chair):  plie with leg raise, side crunch, side kick, leg circles, knee swings, knee lifts, stork kicks; cardio involves knees in and out to pike
*Circuit 3 (face chair):  on toes for closed leg plies, pulses, leg lifts, and cat crunch; grande battement to front and side; warrior balance leg lift lifts, then touch down & raise up; Figure 8 dips to stretch; cardio involves knees in and out, adding rotation
*Circuit 4 (uses ball):  ball behind knee for internal/external rotation of hip, hamstring pulses; ball between knees for squats and pelvic tilts; finish seated on chair with ball between thighs for abs crunches

CORE CHALLENGE & CALMING STRETCH (23.5 minutes)
The first 15 minutes of this segment focuses on the abs/core, and the final 8.5 minutes provides a cool-down stretch.  Mallett suggests using a single 3 lb. or 5 lb. weight for the abs work.
The core work begins with a more traditional feel.  Mallett does start with a modified Pilates roll-up (coming down and up to the ""bra line"" only).  She follows this with several moves propped up on the elbows, including toe touches, bicycles, can can, and rock-n-rolls.  Next, she places the weight between the legs just under the knees for a series of crunch variations, including pelvic tilts, double crunches, and classic crunches; she finishes this segment by repeating the rock-n-rolls with the weight.  The following sequence is more Pilates-inspired but also more advanced.  Holding the weight in her hands, Mallett moves from lying with the weight overhead to rolling up into a bent-leg V-position and then ""explodes"" into a straight-leg V (or full teaser); she keeps the pace slow and even here.  She follows this with the Pilates rollover.  Next is the single straight leg stretch, made even more challenging by placing the hands behind the head and then twisting to either side.  The final seated move is an alternating ""walk up the tree,"" rolling up one leg, then the other.  Following this, Mallett flips over to her stomach for the swan dive, another advanced Pilates move, and then she performs the snake to stretch.  To conclude the core work, she does several sets of push-ups.
The stretch segment begins with a wide lunge to stretch the hip flexors.  Mallett then moves into a hamstring stretch and encourages participants to move towards a full split (which she and everyone but the modifier perform).  Additional floor stretches include wide legged forward bend (adding a twist), seated twist, and a hip/glute stretch.  Mallett performs a few brief stretches standing to finish.

At almost 80 minutes total, this is a LONG workout.  In terms of stamina and flexibility required, I found this to be an advanced routine--in fact, I would suggest that the Core Challenge segment would only be appropriate for those with good pre-existing core strength as well as prior Pilates experience.  With respect to the Booty Barre segment, however, I actually didn't find BB+ to work my glutes as intensely as the original BB.  I do think the barre work in BB+ is intense, but I felt it more in my thighs rather than my ""booty.""  I also found that while I really liked many of the moves that Mallett included in the arms section, I didn't feel comfortable just using one set of dumbbells throughout, as this weight sometimes felt too light, sometimes too heavy; unfortunately, there is little time for weight changes.

As noted, this workout is clearly designed with experienced exercisers in mind.  Despite the presence of a modifier, I would not recommend this DVD to a beginner.  Furthermore, if you were hoping that BB+ was going to be BB2, you may well be disappointed, as this is a completely different routine--with some of the same elements, yes, yet with a totally different feel overall.  But if you are up for a challenge, not just for your booty but for your entire body, then the new Booty Barre Plus Abs & Arms might be for you.",1306108800,58,7057,5.11333914559721
4481863,5,B004V6F94Q,"This dvd is such an incredible follow up to the first Booty Barre. I love the new choreography which challenges me in slightly different ways than the first dvd. I really like the sexier moves in this dvd too, including the figure 8s (LOVE IT!) and the snake move toward the end. I also like the single leg moves and the plie variations. This dvd focused more on the arms and abs, and less kicking than the first dvd. I wasn't sure how the first dvd could be topped, but I love both dvds so much and perform them each at least once a week. I am so bikini ready!!! Plus, with all the shoulder work and tricep work, my posture is much better. You'll love it!!! I'm pretty sure this is how Victoria's Secret models stay in shape.",1305676800,6,726,4.23021582733813
4481864,5,B004V6F94Q,"First of all, I did love the first dvd so perhaps I am a little biased.  However, if you are worried about this dvd being a lot like the first, fear not!  While it runs in the same format (arms, legs, core, & flexibility/stretch) it manages to be completely different!  Tracey has (pretty much) all new moves in this dvd; the arm section is longer as is the core section.

I am going to break it down from memory so please bear with me:

Fluid/dance warm up ~ 6 minutes

Arms ~ about 20 minutes almost <---- completely different from the first dvd.

Barre Section ~ about 30 minutes I am guessing.  It is broken down into 3 sections with a cardio interval between them.  The last section incorperates the use of a playground ball for just a little extra burn!

Core & flexibility - about 20 minutes.  Mostly standard pilates core work with a few extras.  A handwieght is used during some of the exercises.

...and that's it!!  I'm sorry for my poor reviewing technique - do not hold it against this dvd!!  Try it!!

P.S.  Tracey is her usual fun, encouraging self.",1305504000,17,1064,4.402061855670103
4481865,5,B004V6F94Q,Very motivational!! Tracey keeps you moving quickly in this exercise program and your legs will be on fire!! I like her style and she keeps it fun and upbeat and very fast paced. I bought this along with Physique 57 and I really like both of them equally. I will purchase more of Tracey's dvd's in the future.,1425254400,,309,4.344827586206897
4481866,5,B004V6F94Q,"Love this workout video! I do most of it 3 days a week on average! I say most of it, because this women will wear you out! I have noticed that my thighs and abs are tighter though! Can't say I'd recommend this video for someone with knee issues.",1418083200,,245,4.020408163265306
4481867,5,B004V6F94Q,"This is a very nice video, with an experienced and cheerful fitness instructor who is very flexible due to her dancing background. Since I am Afro American I would liked to seen at least one Afro American women model. Also, one reviewer said that there is very little cardio in this DVD. Most people need cardio in their exercise time.  This exercise video is not to be taken as easy!!!",1401235200,,386,4.514285714285714
4481868,5,B004V6F94Q,"I can't say enough about how much I love Booty Barre. I have always been a cardio junky, and I recently realized that cardio alone wasn't changing or reshaping my body. I wanted a DVD that would focus on reshaping muscles and targeting trouble areas while keeping a cardio pace. Booty Barre is perfect!

It has helped me to define my hamstrings which have always been flat, it's leaned out my thighs, lifted my glutes and tightened every other part like abs and arms. In comparison with Total New Body, this one is at a calmer pace, but longer and still leaves sweat on the floor. It leaves more room for focusing on form. The stretching at the end is fabulous and I think it's what keeps me from being sore.

My husband says I look better now than ever, and I've had 4 kids. That says a lot. I love Tracey, she's very motivating and engaging. And this workout has actually strengthened my knees and feet. I used to have pain in both and now it's gone!!!!",1398470400,10,955,4.359550561797753
4481869,5,B004V6F94Q,"I have purchased many different types of exercise DVDs, mostly barre and pilates, and this teacher, Tracey Mallett, to me, is by far the best teacher out there!  Some of her DVDs are definitely advanced and quite a challenge, but this one for example, although tough, was definitely more intermediate and easy to follow and ""doable"" and just as is true of all her other DVDs, she's very sincere, pleasant and fun in her presentation and style and she's not annoying at all, and in fact she's very motivational - I love her!  I would highly recommend any of her exercise DVDs to anyone who loves barre workouts and the mixture of pilates/yoga style and barre together.  The music is fun/uplifiting/motivational and most of all, she's an excellent teacher who really knows what she is doing, and how to share it clearly and in an inspiring and fun way with her viewers.",1398124800,,867,4.690789473684211
4481870,4,B004V6F94Q,"This is one of the best barre workouts that I have done.  I like Tracey's style and as a group exercicse instructor, I still find it very challenging and different than other traditional workouts.",1395619200,,196,4.764705882352941
4481871,5,B004V6F94Q,Great point from previous review. Great workout but helpful to know ballet positions and it's fast paced. Am looking forward to getting back in shape as older mom to 3 young kids under 6.,1394668800,,187,4.529411764705882
4481872,5,B004V6F94Q,"i really am surprised with how her workouts make you feel at the end. They are not long but, they work every muscle. I like that she is upbeat and cheerful but, not annoying. i have a few of her dvd's and I love them.",1388361600,2,217,3.8444444444444446
4481873,4,B004V6F94Q,"I would suggest watching this one before jumping in.  It's a very good workout, but she moves fast, so it's good to watch before you begin so you can get an idea of where she is going and what to expect.  It is quite long so prepare for that, however, you can do segments separately, total DVD is 80 minutes.  All in all it is a good workout and her voice and personality are tolerable.",1376956800,,386,4.12
4481874,4,B004V6F94Q,"This is an intense dvd. I tried it for the first time today, so I cannot review the effectiveness of it (though I highly suspect that this is going to be VERY effective)  but there were a few things that I would change.  It definitely needs different angles. A lot of the moves, the camera is not focused on the foot position so unless you have some dance experience you might be a little lost.  And maybe this was stated somewhere in other reviews but I don't remember reading it, she has an Australian(??? I think) accent and so she was a tad hard for me to understand at first.  You get used to her accent pretty quick but it sort of through me for a loop since I am so used to being yelled at by Jillian's 30 day shred and last chance workout.

I am excited to use this, alternating with my Jillian dvd's. It's a long workout but definitely so intense that your entire body feels it.

You do need a ball for the program, which I wish I knew so I wasn't able to complete 1/2 of the booty routine and won't be able to until I find the ball I need.  But everything else is awesome.",1376956800,,1082,4.099526066350711
4481875,3,B004V6F94Q,The video is fun and makes you look ridiculous! I really enjoy the arms section by itself. I feel sore and ripped after completing this section.,1376870400,,144,4.576923076923077
4481876,5,B004V6F94Q,All around total work out!! it is excellent!! I have bought more of her video's and have recomended them to friends.,1374624000,,116,4.571428571428571
4481877,5,B004V6F94Q,"It took me a LONG time to be able to complete this dvd. I had to take breaks, do every-other reps, use smaalllllllll weights...but finally I managed to complete it.

The arm section is my favorite. You use small weights (3 or 5 lb), but  you will be on your tiptoes or in a squat the whole time with virtually no break. It's not a long section (15 to 20 min or so) but it WILL do the job. It was the only arm workout I did for a long time and when I was finally able to complete it as they wanted me to, my arms looked great.

I hadn't done ANY core or arms for about a year...only running or hiking. It took me about 2 months to complete this dvd.

If you are a beginner, I recommend it because you can always improvise, and build up. Goals are important, and being able to complete this would probably align to your total fitness goals.",1373760000,2,838,4.030120481927711

4481879,5,B004V6F94Q,this video tool works fairly well is very time consuming and should be completed at least twice a week for results,1368144000,,114,4.476190476190476
4481880,5,B004V6F94Q,"Keep in mind that I am totally out of shape so I am unable to do 90% of the moves, but I still love this video. It will give you a workout. Even though I can't do everything I just do the best I can and it works out. I can feel muscles I haven't felt in years or even known I had to begin with. It is awesome and I can't wait to see results after a few months of doing this video.",1368057600,,380,3.5357142857142856
4481881,5,B004V6F94Q,"Another fantastic workout from Tracey. I love Barre workouts, and she is my favorite instructor for this type of workout. Very challenging. I don't think you can beat this workout for sculpting your butt, hip and thighs.",1367712000,,220,4.972972972972973
4481882,4,B004V6F94Q,I like to work out and I thought this tape was pretty difficult.  A great video if you want to challenge yourself and push your limits.,1365120000,,135,4.1923076923076925
4481883,5,B004V6F94Q,Tracey is an excellent instructor. I hope she makes more of these DVDs (I have 3 of her Booty Barre). It does get easier with repetition but it's a good workout no matter what. I  love this.,1360195200,,190,4.135135135135135
4481884,5,B004V6F94Q,"I've tried all the major barre videos and even studios, and by a long shot ... Tracey Mallett's Booty Barre is my favorite.  I am a distance runner, and have never had any dance in my life, but Tracey's cues are consistent and descriptive so even I can do them with ease after the first time through.  This workout is challenging to the fittest but the modifications enable anyone to do this workout and face the challenge of building.

Thank you Booty Barre and Tracey Mallett for a great home workout!",1359504000,,503,4.5054945054945055
4481885,3,B004V6F94Q,"Absolutely not my favorite workout, however I have zero dance experience and a lot of the moves were just too odd for me, I have yet to actually completely the entire workout for two reasons - 1. I get bored because it's not as fast paced as I prefer and 2. the moves are too difficult for someone without a dance background. With that said, the workouts that I have done were difficult and I definitely felt the burn while I was doing them, but was not sore the next day. It's also really long, like an hour and 20 minutes long, and with two kids, I don't have that kind of time. Maybe an hour, max, and that's on a weekend when my husband is home. So, would I recommend this....not really....but then again each to their own. I'll probably throw it into the mix a few more times to see if it grows on me, but thus far, definitely not my top purchase and I'll probably pass along to my sister who is into the ""dance"" workouts.",1358208000,2,927,4.184357541899441

Tracey Mallett is motivating and fun.  I have tried many home fitness videos and have never seen the results that I have from this video.  Tracey's cuing and form is impeccable.  This video is easy to follow and a must add to any home fitness program.",1357948800,3,408,4.259740259740259
4481887,5,B004V6F94Q,I absolutely love all of Tracey's videos!  She makes things very enjoyable while while getting a great workout.  Abs and Arms is a great compliment to the other Booty Barre titles with a little more focus on the troublesome areas.  I would highly recommend any of Tracey's products.  I plan on buying the new F.I.T. video as well.,1357862400,,330,4.637931034482759

I do exercise videos by Chris Freytag, Phsique 57, P90x, etc.  I injured my back and neck doing this video and  haven't been able to work out for over a week.  I'm a physical therapist and understand the body and the importance of good form.  This video moves too quickly and doesn't offer many modifications.  I think it might also have happened because I was trying to watch her and do the moves which , as I said, move along a little too quickly.  I recommend Physique 57 for this type of exercise.",1357257600,4,532,4.313131313131313

4481890,4,B004V6F94Q,"I bought Booty Barre because LOVE the Physique 57 DVD's, both volumes, and I was looking for something in the same vein to mix it up.  I work out regularly; weights, running boot camp, P90x, and I've found that Barre-style workouts are the best for me to actually change my body shape to leaner and less bulky.

Pros:
Challenging workout that hits all ""female trouble spots.""
I liked how it incorporated more flexibility training in with the strength.  I finished and felt sweaty and challenged, but also very refreshed.
Divided in to segments so you can easily choose the sections you want to do.

Cons:
The total DVD is pretty long -- 80 minutes to get in a total body workout.  I would never do the whole thing start to finish
The music is pretty boring
Not too many form pointers given; it would be easy for an inexperienced exerciser to hurt their knees in some of the exercises.

Bottom line:  I like the DVD and will use it to add variety to my workout schedule, but Physique 57 still wins the top spot for fun, challenging, efficient, effective workouts!",1356393600,2,1062,4.557894736842106

Plus, even though I can't continue sometimes during the workout, I'm not too sore to move the next day. It creates stronger leaner muscles, and you can tell a difference after 2 workouts.

It's definitely the best I've found - it kicks my butt, and I feel like it helps me when I go to my dance classes because even though it does different exercises, it strengthens and works a lot of the same or similar muscle groups. It doesn't take the place of a dance class for me, but it's a great workout for someone like me.",1355356800,,480,4.010416666666667

I would say this is not for beginners but it is something that you could do and modify as necessary, I guess.  There are very clear sections (e.g. warmup, arms, etc) so you could break it up if you wanted to.  Overall very worth the  $$",1345420800,,379,4.136986301369863
4481896,5,B004V6F94Q,"Just gave this a try and LOVED IT so much I wanted to write a review just to add to all the great comment ppl have been leaving. I don't recommend it for beginners unfortunately, since even I had to take many breaks. Not long breaks, but like any workout it takes a few tries to get used to it (On the other hand I'm also working out twice a day am/pm following two workout programs Insanity and Brazil butt lift so my muscles are a bit tired at the moment).

I started with the barre section and let me tell you it's tough but it goes by quickly. A lot of plies and lifting your legs and all these moves I'm not used to but loved the burn! Then I noticed I started with the second section and went back to the first since I was really enjoying the dvd, this also flowed by really quickly. I continued so forth until i finished each section of the entire workout sweating buckets. Your heartrate will not be very high but since the moves are tough you are really working your body out. After all the cardio and jumping in Insanity, I can definitely appreciate the focus and fluidity of this workout. I can definitely see and feel how doing this workout a few times a week can really tighten your body up and show results. Will definitely keep at it and try to see how I will incorporate this in my crazy workout schedule.

I'm so impressed I will review her other workout and more than likely purchase a few more. Tracey is a new Favorite!

P.S. Read a few comments about users finding Tracey's voice annoying, don't listen to those ppl. She's amazing, her voice is actually soothing, she doesn't talk too much and I felt she gave the appropriate amount of encouragement without being over the top.",1345248000,8,1698,4.316614420062696
4481897,3,B004V6F94Q,I was looking forward to this video because I thought it would combine ballet and cardio into a fun workout that would get my heart rate up. There is very little cardio so no real heart rate increase. It is good for strength and flexibility. I think it would be really rough though for someone with no ballet background and challenging to follow  Like ballet it is hard on hips and knees. I also didn't really like that you need to be barefoot to do it.,1341446400,7,453,4.267441860465116
4481898,5,B004V6F94Q,"This is what I call the 'middle barre'...I find this intermediate for me. I love it. Its a little harder than the beginners workout but easier than Booty Barre Total New Body. It has a 7 min warm up, killer arms fo 14 mins, Booty Barre & Abs for 35 mins and the Core Challenge and Calming Stretch for 23 mins. I like the arm workout and the days when I want to do Tracey's Fuse Lean I add on the arm workout from this DVD.

It combines yoga, pilates, ballet and dance. You can use 3-5 lbs weights.  I love how it has reshaped my body and nipped in my waist, something I thought impossible at 43 but its kept my weight down (without diet) which I love. My legs have toned and are nice and lean, lost inches in my hips and thighs and my arms and shoulders have a nice shape to them now. Highly recommend this DVD.

This will give you a long, lean look, and is also really fun! Tracey is beyond adorable and she doesn't make it seem like it's easy, breezy to do these moves. You can tell she, along with her assistants, are working really, really hard. 80 minutes flies by, and you'll be cleaning the floor with your sweat. I promise you will feel like a million bucks when it's all done! I definitely recommend adding this to your repertoire and making it a point to do it at least 2-3 times per week (depending on your schedule). Have fun!",1336867200,2,693,4.297709923664122

I can't wait to see the results of this after a few months.  I have only used it twice and feel driven to go back and do it again!

4481901,5,B004V6F94Q,"I'm 39 and am in good shape.  I've been working out six days a week since I was 21.  I'm also an intermediate runner.  It's hard for me to work up a good sweat with workout dvds, so I was really happy that I worked up a great sweat with this workout.  There was enough variety to keep me interested for the entire video.  I liked the music, not too Jock rock like and not so low that I couldn't hear it.  I feel like this is a dvd that is different and will challenge my body to define muscle, lose fat, and gain flexibility.",1330214400,2,525,3.9523809523809526
4481902,5,B004V6F94Q,"Several months ago I went out in search of a new workout. I noticed that all of Tracey's videos were getting rave reviews, so I just picked one that I thought looked good. Best decision ever.

I spent over 20 years as a dancer and stopped very suddenly when my first pregnancy developed complications. Bed rest packs on those lbs! 19 months after my first child I had my second. My poor body needed some serious rehab! I had tried a few different methods in search of my elusive pre-baby dancers body, but nothing was really working. Just wanted to feel healthy and strong again, not necessarily skinny. For me, working out should be fun (like dancing was for me) and I was having a hard time really getting into anything and sticking to it. (Yes, even Zumba. But, that's another story.) Then I found the Booty Barre. I saw results after doing this workout only THREE TIMES! I was shocked. Pretty sure my muscles were just happy to be worked like the old days. The movements are rather simple to follow once you've been through the workout a time or two (like with any video!). Due to my background, I already understand the technique and proper form for much of the ballet and pilates inspired sections--she doesn't go into a lot of explanation. I realize not everyone is a dancer,  but you can still benefit from this workout! Just do the best you can. (Please keep your toes in line with your knees! When you bend your knees, they should go right over your toes. If your toes are turned out farther than your knees can go, due to how much your hips can turn out, adjust your toes! This will help prevent knee pain and injury. Please be careful with those knees.)

I was in the middle of a fitness challenge with regular weigh-ins and measurements when I started this DVD so I can tell you that in about a week, I lost almost 1% body fat, .25 inch in my arms, 2 inches in my waist, and 1.5 in my booty! I call that results! I don't usually do all the sections of the DVD every time. I alternate days with the arm section and the barre sections, but always do the warm-up and the stretch/core sections. Those are important. (And it's ok to work your core everyday. For arms and legs it's better to alternate those.) Bonus? I did a little research on Tracey. She has two kids. That smokin' body had two kids. I'm annoyed by female (or male for that matter) instructors that claim ""it's so easy to look like me!"" when they've never experienced pregnancy and what that does to a body. Like a mechanic that never owned a car. Tracey also gained 55 lbs with each of her pregnancies. Hey! Me too. It's nice to know that you really can have a fit, healthy body after baby. I don't expect to have six-pack abs and a tiny bum again anytime in this lifetime, but Tracey Mallett is certainly helping me get closer! Couldn't ask for more.",1325721600,63,2827,4.391221374045801
4481903,5,B004V6F94Q,"This DVD is awesome! It will kick your butt. It doesnt look like much but its just amazing. I did the arms portion last week and I still feel like my arms look good :). Her voice keeps my interest and doesn't annoy me. She keepts it interesting and as a person who gets bored easily, i really appreciate that. I will say this. I did hurt my arm the 2nd day of doing this tape because I got ahead of myself and tried to do the advanced things. So make sure you gradually progress and if you can't use weights then don't. Work your way up to that and know your own limitations.",1318896000,,575,4.052631578947368

I thought I was in good shape, but I could not keep up and had to take little breaks throughout. Everything is clearly cued and demonstrated and easy to follow, and the work is well thought out. In this video, Tracey is not just presenting her excellent take on existing exercise formats, she is creating something completely new.  ""Barre"" classes based on the Lotte Berk method are popular right now, but none of them can hold a candle to this.  While she incorporates some of those exercises (such as multiple plies in releve), she goes way beyond that and pulls much more dance into the work. But you don't have to be a dancer; you just begin to appreciate how dancers make everything look so easy when they are doing something so difficult!  I don't think there is any other exercise regime as challenging as this workout.  So men, this may be called The Booty Barre, but your booty would be hard pressed to get through this workout too!",1318377600,3,1028,4.54054054054054

I love this workout,1317772800,,305,4.1
4481906,3,B004V6F94Q,"A have mix feelings for this workout.  This is my first attempt at the barre and while I was doing it I did not enjoy it.  I usually do high intensity cardio and cardio sculpt workouts, and/or the elliptical machine four to five times a week, hence I am not used to most of the movements.  Besides the fact that it tends to be repetitive, some of the exercises are a bit too hard and not enough instructions on modification or proper form are given.
However, after finishing it, I felt good, and after a few days I wanted to give it another try.  Still don't enjoy it, but I do feel the work.",1316131200,6,592,4.166666666666667
4481907,5,B004V6F94Q,"I have Tracey's first Booty Barre workout and absolutely love it, but held off on ordering this one since I was in the middle of doing an eight-week program when it came out.  As soon as I finished that other series, I ordered this one, and did it for the first time today.  It doesn't disappoint!  This is another fun workout from Tracey, and I felt like my whole body was worked after doing it.

To do this workout, you need a pair of three- or five-pound weights, a small playground ball, and a chair.

Since other reviewers have already given a breakdown of each workout, I won't do the same thing, but will just say that this is a challenging workout that has all new moves from her previous Booty Barre workout.  If you are familiar with the P57 workouts, Tracey uses the small playground ball in a similar way -- behind the knees and between the thighs to really tighten that area as you press against the ball.

The only thing I would change about this workout would be to have it be a bit shorter; it's hard for many of us to fit in a workout that is an hour and twenty minutes long, so having it be close to an hour (as the first Booty Barre workout is) would have  been nicer.  That being said, this workout flew by for me, and I never felt bored.  In fact, I'm looking forward to doing this one again in two days!",1310774400,3,1325,4.201581027667984

I was already doing a ballet conditioning dvd, but wanted a little bit more of a challenge, so I researched all kinds of barre dvds and this one had the best reviews. So the warm up was pretty easy, then when it got to the barre work......OH.MY.GOSH. It kicked my butt! and legs, and abs. I am kind of small already,a size 5-7, so I see results pretty fast when I workout hard. I just want to build lean muscle and not look so gangly.

Pros:  Good workout overall for full body.  Sweated buckets, muscles on fire for most of the workout.  Music, camera angles, backdrop, ""backup dancers"" all ok.  Cuing by instructor good, moves flow well.

Cons:  As always, I wish they had a music and cues only option --- as much as I like this instructor being tough, her voice gets too shrieky to listen to for long.  As far as cardio goes, I was rarely ever in my target heart rate zone so I would sort of categorize this as something to do on a weight lifting day or something.",1309824000,4,587,4.420560747663552
4481910,5,B004V6F94Q,"Another hit from Tracey Mallett, this is a follow up to the Booty Barre Total New Body.  I have both and love both.  The Booty Barre Total New Body is about an hour long, so I do it on work days when I have less time in the mornings.  This DVD is longer (about an hour and twenty minutes) so I do it on weekends.  Both are along the same lines (dance/pilates/yoga inspired moves with a few cardio drills mixed in) but they are very different workouts so I recommend both.

I have been working out daily since college.  I'm now 33 years old and consider myself in very good physical condition.  I love long-distance running, step aerobics, yoga and rock climbing.  I follow a low-sugar vegetarian diet, and watch my portion size.  In short, I thought I was doing everything right.  I was therefore resigned to my small belly pooch, my little saddlebags (curvy hips, if you're diplomatic about it) and the hint of cottage cheese on my bottom.  I believed these were products of aging and motherhood, and I thought there was nothing I could do about these problem areas (beyond hiding them), until I got the Booty Barre workouts.

In the span of three weeks, I have dropped a pants size and firmed up my hips and thighs.  My stomach is flatter and trimmer.  I finally LOOK like I exercise as much as I do.  That aside, I FEEL stronger and better.  I look forward to my workouts again, and I love seeing the progress I am making in other areas (faster run times, better endurance, more upper body strength, improved balance and posture).  Tracey Mallett's workouts are challenging, rewarding, fun, and best of all, they WORK.  Highly recommended.",1309651200,122,1642,4.565068493150685

The arm section was more intense than the last video and I loved that the abdominal section was longer. I have several Barre workouts and this by far my favorite because the time goes so quickly and it has that fun factor. Great for your lower body, my butt was on fire. I now rotate the two Booty Barre videos and feel like I'm finally seeing results!!

So worth the money..!!",1307577600,,655,6.266666666666667

I have been taking dance lessons for over 10 years as well as yoga, pilates and kickboxing.  This workout still kicks my BOOTY.  This DVD involves much more body awareness vs her first DVD.  It is a long workout, but it goes by fast.  The addition of the ball is great.  The ab section is pilates-inspired.  You need to have basic awareness of your body in order to do this video.  Certain phrases she uses are understandable but not necissarily common sense.  She does not go over basic ballet movements in the DVD before she begins, but the DVD is labelled as intermediate/advanced.  Another great video from Tracey!!!",1306886400,4,723,4.606299212598425
4481914,5,B004V6F94Q,"I loved this DVD!!  It is, though, the most challenging barre DVD I own (at least for me).  It is rated Intermediate-Advanced which I think is fair.  I think it does require good knowledge of one's own body as far as what things you can or can't do, skipping an exercise or using the modifier, or just doing fewer reps where needed.  It certainly gives me something to work up to which I appreciate.  Physical therapist and Pilates Certified Instructor Chantal Donnelly (Strong Knees DVD) performs the modified versions and I did need to follow her during the main Booty Barre workout.

I performed the entire DVD in one sitting after doing 20 minutes on the elliptical.  I could also see breaking apart the different segments.

FUSION WARM UP (7:01)
A fairly intense warm up including a mix of calf raises, and variations on squats/chair pose, lunge/crescent pose, standing splits,  wide leg squat with butt back, and standing side leg lifts while balancing.

KILLER ARMS (14:23)
Tracey recommends 3 or 5 lbs.  I used 5 lbs but I'm pretty strong and think many might need 3 lbs. The first part is done with legs together and lifted on the toes which adds a nice balance challenge.  Chantal does it with her feet flat instead as the modifier. I usually do mostly body weight exercises for upper body but like to include weights once a week (usually Squeeze Stronger Upper Body & Waist). Many barre workouts that include weights are pretty easy for me.  While this one is not as tough for upper body as Squeeze Stronger, I really liked the nice combination of waist and upper body work on this DVD. This was a very unique routine and I liked the fast pace.

Tracy hits the biceps, shoulders, triceps, chest....in various positions - on the toes, wide leg squat, curtsy squat, side leg lifts, and also balancing on one leg in a high static single-leg squat. She adds some nice twists to hit the obliques and waist.  You then  move to the floor for tricep dips variations.

BOOTY BARRE & ABS (34:37)
(Need a playground ball and chair for support - I used my Fitball)
This is a ballet inspired routine with an athletic feel.  If you are familiar with barre workouts and are looking for a challenging workout, this is it.  I have hip dsyplasia and can't lift my leg as high as Tracey does so I followed Chantal keeping my leg lower and also staying lower on my toes during relev.  These modifications worked really well for me.  You move your arms constantly through this segment.

This section includes:
o First position plie variations, including alternating with pass, second position and fourth position plie
o Second position plies - she does one version with butt back and knees moving in and out that I really felt in the butt!  Another version uses pelvic tilts to the front and sides.
o Brief cardio segment starting from plank and kicking both legs off the ground into a pike
o A variety of side leg lifts to work the glutes, obliques, and abs
o Cardio segment with low pulsing lunges, hands resting on the ground, quickly switching legs
o Parallel leg plies
o Static single leg plie with forward leg lifts - this might be too challenging for some to remain on one leg.  I do single leg squats twice a week so this was a challenging alternative doing them in relev!
o Parallel leg plie alternating with a forward leg lift, leg bent at the knee  - works the abs
o Leg kicks forward and then to the side
o Warrier 3 inspired segment (I really liked this)- pulsing raised leg and one raised arm, then bending at the hip to touch extended arm to the ground and back up again, and then sweeping the raised leg out to the side and straightening the upper body
o Parallel leg plie moving hips in a figure 8, raising and lowering
o Cardio segment - plank tucking one leg up towards the abs, and then moving into mountain climbers
o Glute work with playground ball tucked behind the knee
o Plies squeezing the playground ball between the thighs
o Sit on chair leaning back in small c-curve, ball tucked between knees, legs bent - raising and lowering the legs to work the abs

CORE CHALLENGE AND CALMING STRETCH (23:43)
Using a 3 or 5 lb weight is optional in this segment - I skipped the weight.
o Brief c-curve segment (approximately 2 minutes)
o Mostly pilates inspired ab work including bicycle, can-can, reverse curl  with weight between legs, classic crunch raising lower and upper body, oblique crunch, explode segment (start on back with legs in table, extend into boat/V with arms raised, includes rotation), roll over, single straight leg stretch, climb a tree
The ab portion lasts about 13 minutes.
o Back extension: cobra, swan dive, snake
o Pushups (20)
Stretching starts about 15 minutes into this segment.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:

I really liked this DVD.  It was fun and intense and for such a long DVD, time really went quickly. The Booty Barre segment is similar to her first Booty Barre DVD, but feels like a completely different routine.  If you have her first DVD and liked it, I think you would probably like this one.  This DVD makes up for the missing ab work on the first one.

My muscles felt nicely tight after I finished the workout, but because I had been careful to not lift my legs to high during the side leg lifts (followed Chantal) I didn't have any muscle soreness to speak of.  I did put in my Strong Knees DVD and did the stretch segment from it after I completed the workout (I like a lot of stretching).

Just as background, I'm 48 with hip dysplasia and some cartilage damage in one knee (although the knee doesn't bother me much anymore).  I consider myself to be advanced-intermediate for barre work. I have little experience in pilates, limited mostly to Tracey's recent Pilates DVD.  I do practice yoga on a regular basis.",1306627200,16,5760,4.584390243902439

8442978,4,B004V6F94Q,"I purchased this after being able to complete Ballet Body and BarreAmped without too much of a problem (still have a bit of trouble with Ballet Body: Upper Body, though).  The video says it's for intermediate/advanced exercisers but it is very difficult and most definitely geared towards those who have a lot of barre experience.  By that I mean you need to know form pretty well because Tracey hardly gives ANY instruction in regard to proper alignment.  You could really injure yourself if you are unfamiliar with neutral spine and the various ballet positions.  During one cardio segment she does a bunch of ""pikes"" without explaining how to do them without getting hurt.  I didn't even attempt them and stuck to basic plank exercises instead; she does some work with planks but again does not tell you how to align yourself for even this basic move.

That being said, this workout is tough and although I had to stop and start many times it is something that you can build up to with practice as you get stronger and more flexible.  I found the arm section to be the easiest despite doing reps in vee and plie poses (i.e. to keep all muscles active).  My main gripe is that some exercises are more suited for 3 pound weights and others 5 and you really don't have time to switch them out because she moves so fast.  She finishes on the floor with a variation of tricep dips that I found challenging.

The booty/leg portion consists of a lot of plies, kicks, some shimmies, and work with a playground ball.  Almost everything she does also targets the abs, which is a bonus.  She takes breaks from killing your legs to thrown in some cardio but it's not too intense (outside of the pikes I mentioned earlier).  Everything is extremely fast paced and requires quite a bit of flexibility but is undoubtedly effective if done correctly.

The core section begins with ""c"" work, which is hard on my back so I skipped over a lot of it.  The rest focuses on more traditional pilates exercises and some that utilize a light weight to get more bang for your buck.  She finishes with exercises intended to strengthen your back muscles but they were unlike anything I'd seen in other barre videos (i.e. intense and the looked like they could cause serious injury if you are unfamiliar with them).  I stuck to ""superman"" moves.

I was going to give this 3 stars due to the intensity and lack of instruction but there enough good things about the DVD to merit a 4 star rating.  Tracey is pleasant and not a drill sergeant, she does have a modifier, and the difficulty level is so high that it will be a challenge (for me, at least) for quite a while.  I like that she's doing the exercises along with you and doesn't use a voice over, which I find very annoying.  However, if you're new to barre I'd skip this one for the time being and try Suzanne Bowen, Jessica Smith, or Leah Sarago instead.",1436227200,3,2885,4.520231213872832
