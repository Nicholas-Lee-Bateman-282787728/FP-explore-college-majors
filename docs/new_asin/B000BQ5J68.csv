8090941,4,B000BQ5J68,"Meghan White's Ultimate Trainer is a compilation DVD of segments from her previous releases such as Ultimate Challenging Workout, Ultimate Beginning Workout and Pilates Sculpt & Tone. This would be a good start for someone who is a beginner and new to Meghan.
You can mix and match segments to make it a shorter or longer workout. Personally, since I already have her Ultimate Body series then I don't have use for this since I prefer the full length workouts and not shortened versions.",1136332800,15,487,4.809523809523809
