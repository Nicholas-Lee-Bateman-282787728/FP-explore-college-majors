8267853,5,B0017ZAU1G,"Shameless observation of life in New York City during the millennium. (When Prince, David Bowie and Michael Jackson were still walking the earth. Pre 911 this time capsule captures the mating and dating rules needed in order to ""get digits"" or land a date in America. Europeans and Americans invite the viewer to get into the heads and minds of so called ""millennials"" and other contemporaries. New York's (including the Hamptons and Staten Island) diversity and magik is hard to describe. So please check it out yourself and let us know, how you like it.",1492905600,,555,4.852631578947369
8267854,4,B0017ZAU1G,"This documentary (though a little dated looking, as it was shot in 2000), is surprisingly funny, largely due to the colorful (and sometimes hilariously odd) cast of characters in it. Dating is already awkward, but this really takes it to the next level. Very well made and quite entertaining, I recommend!",1382400000,2,305,5.0
