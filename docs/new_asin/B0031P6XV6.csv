4049329,5,B0031P6XV6,"It seems that the PAL Version of this DVD is released before the NTSC Version (which is the North American Market), many people who have not been able to play other Andre Rieu DVD's (other than on their computer)probably need to upgrade their players, most if not all will play all standards these days , even cheap $30 ones! I agree that for some purchasing on Amazon it's not always clear which version you will be receiving hence the bad reviews!,I got hold of this DVD last week here in Australia and once again for $20 you certainly get good value for money with a whopping 130mins of playing time (32 tracks), including a Trailer for ""Live in Australia"" and the ""making of"" as always the production values are excellent , it was nice to see some new stuff too , i have long felt that Andre has perhaps ""over done"" the emphasis on the Waltz content, and that this may have turned people off from purchasing more Rieu material. To clear up any confusion there are two Concert DVD's done in Australia the first titled ""Live in Australia""(Recorded in Melbourne)and which should be available World wide now, and later in December 09 the second DVD will be released here in Oz ""Live in Sydney"", and i would assume that the NTSC version should be available early in 2010.
Finally the last DVD for 09 ""I Lost My Heart In Heidelberg"" which was recorded in September at the famous Heidelberg grain market is due for release here around Dec14th 09 and from what i can gather there will be a total of 21 tracks on this one. I dare say that with Plans underway for a South African tour in the first quater of 2010 we will be seeing those concerts on DVD too.",1260144000,7,1651,4.434210526315789
4049337,5,B0031P6XV6,"Andre Rieu and the Johann Strauss Orchestra performances are pure musical extravaganzas.. The last date I and my Late wife Jenny Lee went on was to the Andre Rieu performance in Fresno, CA. My Jenny Lee and I were so rewarded to attend the performance. The Johann Strauss Orchestra member musician's  smiling faces exhibit the joy they have in performing.  The soprano singers have the voices of angels. The Platin Tenors also show their pleasure in performing. The guest performers add so much pleasure to viewer/listeners. One young guest was a particular stand-out to me. Thirteen years old trumpet player Melissa Venemos is a virtuoso. She played Il Silenzio more beautifully than I had previously heard it. Melissas's emboucher brought forth each note flawlessly. If those who read this review have not purchased Andre's DVD's, you are missing viewing and hearing great performances. I have many of his DVD's and play the Maastricht performances often. Andre is a virtuoso muslcian and has facial expression and announcements of each piece played that reveal how dedicated he is to the pleasure of performing his music.",1388534400,,1124,5.136612021857924
4049338,5,B0031P6XV6,"The audience is likely in the several thousands, typical for this master musician and orchestra.  They travel the world on a regular basis, but seem most relaxed at home in Maastrict, and the music they provide shows it.  The performance in this DVD is a great treat, as are the many others in my large collection of the works of this orchestra.",1381017600,,345,4.548387096774194

4049342,5,B0031P6XV6,"A great show. Good photography, music selections and the guest performer was outstanding. We view this more than all the others.",1353456000,,128,5.142857142857143
4049343,5,B0031P6XV6,This is one of his best concerts ever.  This DVD of Andre Rieu covers a wide variety of selections.  It arrived as advertised and on time.,1350864000,,138,4.269230769230769
4049344,5,B0031P6XV6,This dvd is not only a concert but rather a celebration of classical music and of local culture. Andre Rieu and his magnificent orchestra engages the audience and their response is one to behold. All of his music presentations bring me great joy.,1347753600,,246,4.744186046511628

4049357,5,B0031P6XV6,"Like all of Andre Rieu's concerts, this one sweeps you up and carries you along.
In a world filled with noisy angry music, to listen to the music of Johann Strauss and other romantic composers is an absolute treat.  Apart from the charm of Andre Rieu himself, one cannot help but notice that both the audience and his own musicians are having a great time.  One of the most moving pieces on this DVD is the song ""Nearer My God To Thee"", best remembered as being played by the orchestra of R.M.S. ""Titanic"" as the ship was sinking.  When you realize the significance of this tune, it is guaranteed to leave you with a lump in your throat.  All of Andre
Rieu's concerts are great but this one, played on his home turf in Holland, is special.  This is one DVD I shall watch many times.",1324944000,,782,4.328767123287672
4049358,1,B0031P6XV6,"Be careful when you purchase this item, it is in PAL format not NTSC. This will

4049359,5,B0031P6XV6,"This DVD contains 2 hours of pure joy, great music, perfect performances and the best connection you'll ever see between musicians and audience. If you're down or depressed, watch this DVD and within a few minutes you're smiling and feeling good. Better and much cheaper than whatever medecine or over the counter drug. Highly recommended.",1317168000,2,339,5.181818181818182
4049360,5,B0031P6XV6,"Somehow I did not realize this dvd was only available in the European format (PAL). I was pleased to find that I could still watch it on my computer with headphones. I enjoyed it totally. Andre Rieu went to great lengths to turn this dvd into a great production with many guest musicians. For me it was a soul-stirring surprise.

4049361,4,B0031P6XV6,The photo of this Andre Rieu Vrijthof Maastricht DVD is the PAL version. So beware before ordering and check with Amazon that they will send the NTSC format. It won't be the first time this situation happened...,1282348800,,211,4.72972972972973
4049362,5,B0031P6XV6,This DVD is right up there with the best of Andre's productions and offers quite a lot of new material. Everything is topnotch!,1270857600,5,127,4.565217391304348
4049363,5,B0031P6XV6,"Another exceptional performance by Andre Rieu in his hometown of Maastricht in Limburg Province of The Netherlands.  A world class performance, as always, by the world's best performer.  Andre and his highly talented orchestra are truly a classical world treasure. So, get a good glass of wine, sit back, and enjoy the show!",1270598400,8,324,5.09433962264151
4049364,5,B0031P6XV6,"I received this DVD in the correct NTSC format in three days.  This makes the 22nd DVD which I own and I have to say it is one of his best.  Andre is in fine form and graciously shares the stage.  The three sopranos, Carmen, Carla and Mirusia are in top form.  Carmen's tribute to Michael Jackson (Earth Song) exemplifies her talent - a classical soprano and opera singer who ""nails it""!  Carla rendition of ""Song of Olympia"" proves that she ""owns"" this aria.  Mirusia exhibits her power and range in ""Time to Say Goodbye"" without over doing it - she has a TREMENDOUS career ahead of her.  A LOT of new songs are played by the JSO along with the old standbys which are played to perfection. A excellent addition to anybodys collection.",1265673600,14,735,4.440298507462686

4049366,1,B0031P6XV6,"I still can't believe it! We ordered a DVD of Masstricht II &  Maastricht III from Amazon.com in early December 2009 without being asked to specify what region code we needed. We have bought several of these Andre Rieu DVD's without ever having to specific which region code we could use. I did not know it until now, but this regional coding business is a well established international program. It ought to be ""a given"" on the part of Amazon.com marketing management to not ship an improperly coded DVD product to a United States customer. DVD equipment manufactured and marketed in the North American market will not operate with video products not coded for the United States market.

Amazon cheerfully refunded my payments, but I had to drive to the post office to send the improperly coded products back. I still can't believe they did it without malice aforethought (i.e., get year end sales up any way you can!!)

amazon.  I had the strange notion that Amazon was an

American company.  I will just ""eat "" the cost and forget about it. If you would like it back, I can just give it back to you.

8387139,5,B0031P6XV6,"Sometimes there are events that transcend any description one could put into words, and this is one of those events. When you view this DVD, you have to wonder, "" Is this man the most Brilliant musician, conductor, composer and concert promoter of the century... or is he an absolute Loon on steriods?""  From start to finish you remain transfixed just waiting for the next act that will exceed your expectations. When Carmen Manarcha sings the Earth Song, by Michael Jackson, with the Children's Choir, your heart will break, your tears will flow, and you know Michael is smiling down. When Carla Maffioletti comes on as a wind up doll and performs, you will laugh like you have lost your mind. When Mirusia Louwerse sings ""Time To Say Goodbye"", you will smile and cry as you think of your loved ones and friends, and you will not exhale until the very last note. The Platin-Tenors will make you stand up and cheer, and you will sing along with the magic of their Opera quality voices and their light hearted humor. The uninhibitied antics and humor of the Johann Strauss Orchestra and Choir, as they connect with the audience, makes you feel as though you were sitting right on the square. And when all of these talents perform together.... they will blow the roof off the hall, or rattle the sky if they are outdoors. I would highly recommend this DVD to ANYONE who enjoys any type music and theater as it is all here. Please do not be put off by any of Andre' Rieu DVD's that are done in a different language, as your Subtitle option on your player will translate to English, and the content is done so well that you will loose nothing in the translation. Now buckle up and enjoy the ride !!!!!",1400371200,,1697,4.527687296416938
