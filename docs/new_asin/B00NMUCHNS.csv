6672958,5,B00NMUCHNS,"""Time Bandits"" is a weird and amusing fairy tale of a boy named Kevin who escapes from his technology-obsessed parents after six dwarfs burst through his wardrobe door. They've stolen a map from the Supreme Being and are intent on plundering the past, but they're pursued through time by the Evil Genius, meeting Napoleon, Robin Hood, Agamemnon, and other characters historical and fictional.

This intensely phantasmagorical spectacle is a must-see for children, children at heart, and fans of Terry Gilliam's singularly playful, satirical vision. He lets his imagination run riot, producing a film full of humor, action, adventure, and special effects. It features splendid performances from a cast that includes Ian Holm, Ralph Richardson, Sean Connery, and members of Monty Python.

Hundreds of Amazon reviewers have contributed reviews of this classic fantasy -- both glowing and dismissive -- but nearly all of them have been for earlier editions on VHS, Laserdisc, DVD, double DVD, Instant Video, HD Instant Video, etc. As usual, all of them are lumped together on a single page. The few who have purchased the Blu-ray praise the film but don't tell you what's on the disc. I will.

The 2014 Criterion release is the version to get. It contains a pristine restoration personally supervised by Gilliam as well as full-length audio commentary by Gilliam, co-writer Michael Palin, and actors John Cleese, David Warner, and Craig Warnock. The picture is clean, sharp, and colorful, and the remastered sound is crystal clear.

There's also a new documentary featuring production designer Milly Burns and costume designer James Acheson, a conversation with Gilliam of over an hour filmed at the 1998 Midnight Sun Film Festival, and a clip of actor Shelley Duvall on the Tomorrow show in 1981. Rounding out the package are a gallery of photos, a trailer, and an essay by film critic David Sterritt.

Join a young boy as he travels through time with a group of ecclectic dwarves as they are on the run from a great big head who tells them to return the map that they stole.  As he travels, he meets many historical figures like Robin Hood, Jesus, and Napoleon (and pilfering a few trinkets along the way).  But what will happen when the map falls into the wrong hands, can they stop the ulitmate Evil at the center of Time itself?

It has been a long time since I have seen this movie, but I remember a lot of it and it still was one of the best movies of my childhood (Ice Pirates and Ghostbusters are also up there).  Now compared to today's special effects and filimg, it does come off as a little corny - but this is a time when a movie has substance rather than flash.

In this fantastic voyage through time and space from director Terry Gilliam. A boy named Kevin [Craig Warnock] escapes his gadget-obsessed parents, to join a band of time-traveling dwarfs. Armed with a map stolen from the Supreme Being [Sir Ralph Richardson], they plunder treasure from Napoleon [Ian Holme] and Agamemnon [Sean Connery]. But the Evil Genius [David Warner] is watching their every move. Featuring, a darkly playful script by Terry Gilliam and his Monty Python cohort Michael Palin (who also appears in the film).

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Time Bandits is a cheerfully irreverent lark and part fairy tale, part science fiction and part comedy. It's a fantastic though wobbly flight through history and legend in the company of a small boy named Kevin and six dwarfs named Randall, Fidgit, Wally, Og, Stutter and Vermin. These are not your ordinary, run-of-the-mill little people. They are more like the angry, liberated kind of crowd Snow White hung out with. Because the film was written by Michael Palin and Terry Gilliam, and directed by Terry Gilliam, it's no surprise that Time Bandits recalls the manic work of the Monty Python group, of which Terry Gilliam and Michael Palin are founding members.

However, unlike the earlier Monty Python films, especially The Life of Brian, Time Bandits appeals as much too very young moviegoers as well to an older generation and times when it might scare the hell out of small children, but enjoyed enormously by an older generation with a humour we've come to associate with Terry Gilliam, Michael Palin and John Cleese, who turns up in Time Bandits as a very unusual quirky and eccentric Robin Hood.

Time Bandits has as its basis nothing less than the Greatest Mystery Story Ever Told, the creation of the universe. It is the mad quirky mind set idea of Michael Palin and Terry Gilliam that the Supreme Being [Sir Ralph Richardson] became a little forgetful towards the end of those first, eventful seven days and left some holes in time.

The dwarfs, who had helped the Supreme Being in His work, but always in lowly tasks in creating trees and bushes and doing repair work of one sort and another, eventually rebelled and took off from His workshop, taking with them the map showing where the ''time holes'' were. As Time Bandits begins, the dwarfs have just fled from their Supreme Being Master and, accidentally, run into young Kevin in his 20th Century London bedroom. Kevin is delighted by the strangers and enthusiastically joins their grand scheme to become the greatest international bandits in history.

Nothing, of course, ever works out as planned, especially by this unruly crew. By chance, they fall through one hole in time and find themselves with a short-tempered Napoleon [Ian Holm], who is in the process of conquering Italy. Though victorious, Napoleon is not happy. He feels himself to be surrounded by ''freaks'' meaning men taller than he is. When first seen, Napoleon is sitting in the ruins of Castiglione watching a Punch and Judy show with rapt attention. ''That's what I like,'' says Napoleon, ''little things hitting each other!'' He replaces his general staff with Kevin and the Time Bandits.

In swift succession, the band of dwarfs and Kevin drop into and out of ancient Greece, where Kevin becomes the adopted son and heir of Agamemnon [Sean Connery]; Sherwood Forest, ruled by John Cleese's in the guise of a posh Robin Hood, who affects the forced royal sort of affability of someone like the Duke of Edinburgh at the inauguration of a public swimming pool; the deck of the Titanic, just in time for one of the dwarfs to order champagne ''with plenty of ice,'' as well as mythical lands inhabited by giants, ogres and worse. The incomparable Shelley Duvall is wasted in two tiny roles, first as a medieval maiden whose hot-blooded lover Vincent [Michael Palin] has an emotional disability, and then as a passenger on the Titanic, still being pursued by Michael Palin, who this time is an upper-class twit.

Also seen from time to time is David Warner as the Evil Genius, who seeks to rule the universe with the dwarfs' time-hole map, and, near the end, the great Sir Ralph Richardson, whose Supreme Being [God] is a benign, weary, grey suited fellow bored to distraction by the question as to why He chose to allow evil loose in the world. He brushes the subject away, ''Something to do with free will, I think.''

At its best, Time Bandits is extremely very, very good. The physical production is elaborate and lush, and the special effects are marvellously well done. It's played with fine comic style by everyone from Sir Ralph Richardson, Sean Connery, Ian Holm and David Warner on down through to young Craig Warnock and the six irrepressible dwarfs, David Rappaport, Kenny Baker, Jack Purvis, Mike Edmonds, Malcolm Dixon and Tiny Ross.

The humour is surreal, spiteful and very funny, while Terry Gilliam's imagination goes berserk in the final half, set in a make-believe era known as the Time of Legends. Here we find an irritable ogre stricken with lower-back pain, a gormless sea giant, and the gothic vision that is the Fortress of Ultimate Darkness. The film's 5 million [$8 million] budget evidently couldn't keep up with Terry Gilliam's fevered visions, and a further two scenes had to be dropped, one involving a pair of spidery old ladies, the other a forest of monstrous hands.

The film's imagination versus rationality theme climaxes with an ingenious skirmish in which a toy-littered bedroom becomes a sprawling battleground. Here the shape-shifting Evil creatively dismantles an army of cowboys, spaceships and tanks rallied from the annals of history. Even being the Supreme Being [God] himself turns up, is a priceless cameo from Sir Ralph Richardson, looking like a slightly bewildered bank manager.

Such a non-ending would have been scrubbed by a larger studio. Indeed, arguments over the ending of BRAZIL caused major delays, discontent and ultimately the release of a directors cut to bring the movie back to Terry Gilliams original vision. Time Bandits stands as a glimpse at the filmmaking of Terry Gilliam freed from the oppressive structures of a high powered studio. His visual sense, especially consider the scene with the suspended cages; this scene looks like no other in modern films, and is unconstrained and his storytelling stands as he intended it. Time Bandits gives us a sense of what makes Gilliam such a unique and powerful director. And, again it is very very funny.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Time Bandits is presented in its original aspect ratio of 1.85:1. Black bars at the top and bottom of the screen are normal for this format. Supervised by director Terry Gilliam, this new digital transfer was created in 2K resolution on an ARRISCAN film scanner from the original camera negative. The restoration was overseen by Arrow Video and performed at Deluxe Digital Cinema in London. Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratched, splices, warps, jitter and flicker were manually removed us MTIs DRS. This The Criterion Collection's Blu-ray disc should be placed ahead of all other competition, especially pre-existing international Blu-ray releases. Flesh tones are stable throughout, while crush is undetectable and colours remain fully saturated. A few shots of the Napoleonic battleground have image inconsistencies, but they look to be in-camera fluctuations of natural light and movement and not transfer flaws. The high-definition transfer is not identical to the Arrow Academy used for their release of the Time Bandits in the United Kingdom.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The original stereo soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from the original 35mm magnetic track. The uncompressed stereo is quieter than one might expect of so boisterous a film, but a lack of any aural issues and consistent balancing of the various effects, dialogue, and music makes for a clear track. There is only one standard audio track on this Blu-ray release in the form of a 2.0 LPCM Audio Stereo track. For the record, The Criterion Collection has provided an optional English SDH subtitles for the main feature.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

NEW Beautiful Stunning 3D Special Printed Slip Cover.

NEW 2K digital restoration, supervised by director Terry Gilliam, with an Uncompressed Stereo soundtrack.

Audio Commentary: Commentary featuring Terry Gilliam, cowriter-actor Michael Palin, and actors John Cleese, David Warner, and Craig Warnock: Originally recorded for The Criterion Collection back in 1997, features director Terry Gilliam, and co-screenwriter and actor Michael Palin, and actors John Cleese, David Warner and Craig Warnock. To listen to the audio commentary while viewing the film, you have to press the AUDIO key button to select the 2.0 Dolby Digital Stereo.

Special Feature: Creating the Worlds of Time Bandits [2014] [1080p] [16:9] [23:22] This New piece, that is narrated by film writer David Morgan, featuring production designer Milly Burns and costume designer James Acheson discussing the creation of the films various historical periods and fantasy worlds. This is a must view, as you get some very insightful information of what went on behind-the-scenes of making the film Time Bandit.

Special Feature: Terry Gilliam and Peter von Bagh [1998] [480i] [4:3] [79:31] This conversation between Terry Gilliam and film scholar Peter von Bagh, recorded at the 1998 Midnight Sun Film Festival in Sodankyl&auml; in Finland. This lengthy conversation between Terry Gilliam and film scholar Peter von Bagh sees the two discuss the filmmakers childhood upbringing in Minnesota, the influence of various artists, comedians and filmmakers on his work, being a cartoonist, working on the Time Bandits and more. What annoyed me about this conversation was how the pompous boring idiot Peter von Bagh hogged the whole session and did not allow anyone in the audience to ask questions. But apart from this negative aspect of this session, it gives you a great insight oh what makes Terry Gilliam tick and how it gives a great insight on how his imagination about making his films. The only thing I didn't like, is how it suddenly ends without warning.

Special Feature: Shelley Duvall [1981] [480i] [4:3] [8:44] Appearance by actor Shelley Duvall on Tom Snyders Tomorrow show from 1981 in front of a live audience. Shelley Duvall speaks with host Tom Snyder about Time Bandits and The Shining and especially working with Robert Altman and realising that was a star after being recognised in a fast food drive-thru. What shocked me the most is what a thick idiot Tom Snyder and his ignorance comments on more intelligent British Humour, than compared to what we see from America? The image and sound quality was like if it was copied off a very bad quality VHS tape that had been recorded at home.

Special Feature: Stills Gallery [2014] 1080p] [16:9] This Stills Gallery reveals 25 rare photographs from the set and crew at work on the set of Time Bandits. You have to press the right arrow on your remote hand set to move the images forward and the left button to move the images backward. To exit you have to press the ENTER button on your remote hand set.

Theatrical Trailer [1981] [480i] [4:3] [3:10] Written as if it was a sketch from the Monty Pythons Flying Circus, and has a very silly [not very funny] voice over that kind of ruined it for me. Also why is the trailer not in the right ratio as the film and I cant understand why the people at The Criterion Collection could not have got hold of a much better quality master copy?

BONUS: Here you have is an essay by critic David Sterritt, entitled GUERRILLA FANTASTY. On one side of this fold out Sheet is a lovingly rendered essay by David Sterritt, as well as film credits and transfer info. On the other side is a beautiful colourful reproduction of the map that was used in the Time Bandits film.

Finally, Terry Gilliam's grandiose, darkly comic children's adventure has seen many home-video releases over the years, but The Criterion Collection's Blu-ray finally gives the film the package it deserves and is a joy to view and at times it makes you want to join in the fantasy adventure with Kevin and his time bandits friends in this fantastic voyage through time and space. Perhaps the greatest characteristic attributable to the Time Bandits is its sense of invention. The film does so many things on so many levels, all of them done very well. At first glance, one would not think of this as a mainstream production, but it made more than $40 million in U.S. cinemas alone  an exceptionally good figure for a ""small"" film. This, as much as anything, is a testimony to Time Bandits wide ranging appeal. The blend of quick-moving adventure, familiar faces, lowbrow slapstick, highbrow wit, and visual style offers more than one thing to just about everyone. And, with an ending that mocks the idea of ""happily ever after."" Time Bandits concludes perfectly. This is a great film that has only gotten better with the passage of 20 years. Very Highly Recommended!

THE STORY: Six dwarfs who have become bored working for countless eons as gardeners for The Supreme Being steal his map of doorways in time and plan to use it to become filthy rich. A young boy is inadvertently caught up in their scheme. Will he be able to return home? After adventuring thru the millennia with the half dozen rambunctious half pints, (and realizing how truly vacuous life was with his bland, stodgy parents), will he even want to?

THOUGHTS: One of director Terry Gilliam's more interesting films. A few Monty Python cameos add to the fun. Plot is fairly free form and those not used to Gilliam's scattershot stream-of-consciousness style may find it all rather confusing. It actually gets better with repeated viewings, as do most of his works. All of the actors here are fun, most especially David Warner as ""Ultimate Evil,"" along with his wonderfully dopey minions. I don't think I've ever seen Sean Connery look so relaxed on screen, and then of course there's the always unflappable Sir Ralph Richardson, who makes for a delightful Supreme Being. Fans of Pythonesque humor will find more to mine from this film that others, but there's pretty much something for everyone to chuckle at here. Surprisingly, it's fairly inoffensive and safe for the entire family; a rarity with Gilliam's work. The effects are pretty good, given the modest budget, and still manage to charm even 35+ years after the fact.

THE BLU-RAY: Criterion gives us a pretty good hi-def release of TIME BANDITS. That's not to say that this presentation is perfect. Far from it. There are instances of dirt & debris scattered throughout the film, albeit none too terribly distracting. The focus isn't as sharp as I had hoped (or as it should be). Also, many of the darker shots & scenes in the film exhibit a disappointing amount of crush (video noise). This is a decent transfer, but a full-on frame-by-frame restoration would have been preferable, especially given Criterion's always steep asking price. I bought mine used, so I feel I got a good deal.",1450915200,2,2320,4.883248730964467

Hey  guys  if  your  looking  for  something  more  interesting  or  something  you  won't  find  in  any  of  the  Back to  the future  movies,  I  urge  you  to  check  this  one  out.  They're  called  dwarfs  in  the  movie,  in  real  life  they're  Midgets.  They're  so  funny  when  they  argue.  One  of  my  favorite  parts  of  the  movie  is  the  end  when  the  OR I M I A  song  is  playing!  &  the  supreme being when he appeared, after Kevin's bedroom became a hallway. The supreme beings voice echoing like it was. That was awesome! Sean Connery is good in this movie as well, here for a little while before Kevin fell from the time hole Sean battles a huge guy with a big mask. He just about had him whipped, broke his sword in half when he stepped on it. I guess Kevin gave him the right advantage. Kevin & Randall whoever he is in real life had lots of exciting adventures. I'm sure giving each one up and moving on had to be hard. & they were on a quest for the fortress of ultimate darkness or just trying to escape the supreme being.
Randall finally got use to Kevin after not wanting to put up with him. I liked all the characters in the movie.
& the evil one how he faced the knights & cowboys at the end. Doing what he can to hang onto the map. Nobody knows for sure exactly what happens to Kevin's parents in the end when a piece of the evil was accidentally sent back with Kevin. Are his parents dead or alive? Or are they just in another time some place. With nowhere for Kevin to go now would the supreme being ever consider letting him join back up with his friends? I've thought about it before, why they just didn't make a sequel. A second Time bandits movie.
I liked the fortress of ultimate darkness too. Those guys aside the evil one must have worn plastic during the movie, they looked like they were going to do some painting. It looks like this movie was filmed in different parts of the world. Several different places. Where Sean Connery was kind of looked like Egypt. But I can't be sure of it. (Sean  Connery)  has  2  different  roles  in  the  movie  to  play,  first  where  he  meets  Kevin  &  Kevin  tries  to  persuade  him  into  letting  him  stay  &  live  there  in  the  village  with  him
 wherever  that  is,  &  at  the  end  of  the  movie  as  one  of  the  firefighters.  They all ran into unusual things, not to mention dropping in on Shelley Duvall & her boyfriend, she'd roll her eyes back & that's when the midgets fell on them. That's what I thought was very funny. Hey Randall? Why not tell those couple gee guys sorry to interrupt love & romance!  I  thought  whoever  played  the  giant  had  to  of  been  a  large  person  in  real  life.  The  giant  in  this  movie  tops  most  of  the  giants  I've  seen  in  other  movies.  This  one  must  have  been  almost  1000  feet  tall.
When I got it on blue ray I was disappointed with just one thing, no subtitles on this disc. Why? I feel like the producers or the distribution place whoever it is that's responsible should take this matter more seriously. I think that's what all of them need to do. Everything else appears to be fine.
I've  always enjoyed  this  movie.  They  travel  through  time  yes,  the  only  difference  is  they  don't  need  a  time  machine  or  nothing like  that.  Just  a  simple  map.  &  a  magic  door  appears,  &  you  end  up  almost  anywhere.  These  guys  don't  really  control their  destination.  They  just  travel!
I  have  enjoyed  this  movie  so  many  times  I  can't  keep  count  over  how  many  times  I've  watched  it  in  the  past.  That's  one  way  to  warp  through  time  going  through  a  dark  doorway  that  just  appears  out  of  thin  air.  I've  seen  other  movies  &  shows  about  time  traveling.
To  me  in  this  movie  this  is  one  heck  of  way  to  travel!  &  it  is  too  bad  it  had  to  end  at  the  end  of  the  movie.  You  know  what  I  think,  the  supreme  being  should  have  just  duplicated  the  map  &  kept  the  original  one  &  allowed  them  to  continue  to  travel  through  time.  Me?  I  love  to  go  exploring!  Traveling  through  time  is  a  Blast!!!",1429228800,3,4243,4.20026525198939

6673023,5,B00NMUCHNS,"Gilliam supervised this Blu-Ray transfer and it looks great with a lot of detail visible and the filmic quality preserved. This is a significant improvement from Criterions previous DVD incarnation.

Carried over from the DVD version is an audio commentary by director Terry Gilliam, co-screenwriter Michael Palin and actors John Cleese, David Warner and Craig Warnock. Rather fittingly, Gilliam starts off talking about the films origins. He excels at recounting filming anecdote and discussing some of the themes. He also recounts a story about how he accidentally injured Shelley Duvall during filming. Warnock recalls his experiences as a child making his first film. Cleese chimes in on his memorable cameo as Robin Hood and his take on the character. Gilliam and Warnock recall working with Connery as the former talks about how helpful the veteran actor was in working with the latter.

Creating the Worlds of Time Bandits features production designer Milly Burns and costume designer James Acheson as they talk about their work on the film. It was a dream project for them because they got to work on a variety of designs for all the time periods depicted in the film. They also talk in detail about what they wanted to do, accompanied by sketches, stills and clips from Time Bandits.

There is a conversation between Gilliam and Peter Von Bagh at the Midnight Sun Film Festival in 1998. The director talks about what influenced him as a filmmaker and what it was like growing up in Minnesota. He speaks highly of the surreal comedy of Ernie Kovacs and the animation of Walt Disney and Tex Avery.

Also included is a 1981 interview with actress Shelley Duvall on Tomorrow, an American talk show hosted by Tom Snyder. She talks about working on Time Bandits while also touching upon some of her other work. Duvall comes off as a charming and earnest person.

There is a stills gallery of rare, behind-the-scenes photographs of Gilliam and co. at work.

Finally, there is a theatrical trailer.",1421884800,37,1999,4.95223880597015
