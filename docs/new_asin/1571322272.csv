188202,5,1571322272,"If you are wondering why this ""Wishbone"" adventure is entitled ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" rather than something cute like the rest of the episodes, then you might be interested to know that this was originally broadcast in the fall of 1997 as a prime-time special in time for Halloween.  In it, the Jack Russell terrier with the vivid imagination imagines himself to be Ichabod Crane in the Washington Irving classic.  Yes, this particular episode is faithful enough to the original that it might prove too scary for the small fry, but Wishbone is clearly aimed at elementary students/pre-teens (i.e., kids who would reasonably be expected to be able of reading some, but clearly not all, of these books).  Even if you just judge this video in terms of Irving's original story, it is an above-average effort; reminds me a lot of ""Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol,"" where you are surprised how effective comic characters can be when they take something seriously.  The show tried to up the ante for their first hour-long effort and I think they succeeded admirably.",1010880000,7,1062,4.916201117318436
188203,5,1571322272,"I never really watched Wishbone before this video, just the bits and  pieces I caught when my daughter watched.  If anything I thought it was a  pretty silly idea for a show.  However, I have always loved The Legend Of  Sleepy Hollow, so when she checked this movie out from the library, I had  to watch it with her.  I absolutely fell in love with Wishbone!  This movie  is perfect, especially for little ones, it has tons of atmosphere but isn't  too scary.  I can't wait to own this one!",968112000,8,490,4.333333333333333

7797352,5,1571322272,"I'm a huge fan of the book (the Wishbone book, not Washington Irving...although his wasn't too shabby either) and the first year I read it to my class (8 years ago. Have read it every year since), I was lucky enough to find this. It's typical Wishbone, so we're not talking Oscar noms here, but they did an excellent job of adapting this book into a movie. My kids loved how close it was to the book, but were still able to recognize the slight differences too. Their favorite part is always the first time they meet Wishbone... they are always so tickled by him and why not? He's so different from characters they're used to now-a-days. I always show this after we finish the book at our Halloween class party. It's a great addition to reading the story.",1408579200,,755,4.438848920863309

7797355,5,1571322272,"I'm a collector by nature, and the stories I love---like Legend of Sleepy Hollow---I make a point of collecting its movie counterparts.  this and ""Night of the Headless Horseman"" are my two favorites in this collection---not that there's anything wrong with Bing Crosby's rendition, of course.",1222214400,,293,5.369565217391305
7797356,5,1571322272,"Wishbone is a jack russell terrier who imagines himself as different characters in literature.  In this story, he imagines himself as the schoolteacher Ichabod Crane.  Each of the wishbone stories has two parts.  In one part wishbone daydreams about being a character in literature, and in the other part his owner, Joe Talbot goes thru adventures of his own with his friends, and of course, Wishbone. This is another of my favorites.  It defintely teaches kids about literature, and of course, having a cute little dog helps.",1169164800,,526,5.011494252873563
7797357,5,1571322272,"When my 13 year old was young, Wishbone was one of his favorite TV shows.  We now have a 2 1/2 year old and I'm glad we saved our old video tapes since the show is no longer on.  Wishbone is a cute little Jack Russell Terrier. Our neighbors have one just like him so my little one thinks he's the one on the tape and loves to watch them all.  They are fun, imaginative and kids just love dogs.

In this version of Washington Irving's classic early American ghost story, Wishbone steps into play Ichabod Crane, the nervous school teacher who comes to Sleepy Hollow.  The producers did a good job of capturing the look of early colonial America and you know the budgets sure were not very big for these shows.  This is a good way for kids to learn about this classic story without having quite the frights of the actual story or theatrical versions.

The fact that my little one loves Halloween and all things scary even make this more of a treat.  Just wonderful!",1110153600,3,962,4.335195530726257
