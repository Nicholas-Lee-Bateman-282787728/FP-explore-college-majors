I am glad we have the capablitly to find these ships even if we can't retrieve them from the bottom of the lakes.",1370563200,,224,4.0
8183774,4,B000O77QJC,"I sure did enjoy this dvd about the shipwrecks in Lake Huron. It is informative and the video shots where great
but the vid is only about 30 or so minutes. I  would like to see vids of the other great lakes wrecks. This vid not only covered newer wrecks but also old wooden ones as well. It's fantastic to see these old wrecks so nicely preserved in the fresh cold waters of the lakes. I would love to visit them someday!! I do recommend this vid for
the shipwreck enthusiates!",1283644800,7,477,4.241758241758242
