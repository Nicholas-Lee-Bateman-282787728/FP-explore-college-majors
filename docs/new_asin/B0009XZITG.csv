BUT honestly I learned more from FREE yahoo groups!

This DVD does have some fresh ideas if you are stuck in a relationship rut or not knowing how, nor liking to play with your child.

But If you want to learn something even better than Floortime, check out the yahoo group called COMMUNICATING from Dr. James  MacDonald (worked with late talking children and infants at risk for 40 years now in his research and treatment clinic, I forget where, an Ohio University, I think).  I liked Dr. Jim's free advice at the group so much, and saw such huge changes in my kid and our relationship, that I bought the SHORTCUTS Dvd off his website.

I highly recommend the Shortcuts DVD over the Floortime series for any child with language / communication delays (I have used his ideas with both my special needs children - one with PDD NOS and one with Down Syndrome, successfully)

In fact I also must mention the other group that helped our family tremendously.  The free yahoo group AUTISM-MERCURY too.  Their guidance and advice from phD biochemists and herbologist, and regular parents doing the same thing, they all helped me heal my PDD NOS child to a normal state with nutritional interventions and toxin removal in a safe slow way over time.  She's now age 9 and is doing great.  She has lovely friendships within the neighbourhood and at her school.  She dances ballet quite seriously.  She is in a regular classroom, she is reading fairly well, she's a lovely sociable girl - a totally different child to what she was age 4 months to 3 years.

We started healing her from PDD NOS at age nearly 4 years and she was mostly well by age 5.5 -6 years of age.  I wish I hadn't waited so long to get serious.  I joined the lists and it took a long time to learn enough to feel confident (I was totally alone and without guidance here, as I live in China, but DAN doctors or naturopaths are all over the US and Europe and can help you along the way)

Don't waste your money on this DVD.  They bathe the child in WAY TOO MUCH LANGUAGE and having studied the Communicating Partners approach this DVD is actually painful for me to watch.  I see the kids shut down under way too much stimulation.!  Dr. Jim's approach is much more sensitive and focused, concrete and easy to apply.  His PLAY TO TALK book was good, the Shortcuts DVD shows it live (which I really needed to see and highly recommend over the DIR series).  Communicating Partners builds social responsiveness first,  through just SOUNDS - social sounding , then focuses next on relevant ONE WORD phrases in a similar but much more interactive (not parents just babbling on and on)  enriched relationship approach. The Floortime DIR was sort of revolutionary at the time (""kids with autism can be helped"") but we've come a lot further in our knowledge both of communication disorders and the biological underpinnings of the brain problems in autism.",1391990400,5,2956,4.586666666666667
8070048,5,B0009XZITG,"If you are not familiar with DIR concepts, I would recommend to read first ""Engaging Autism"". Anyway, it is the most helpful tool to engage not only autistic children but also the ones who are at risk. My two-year daughter is at risk and she is showing very good improvement. I strongly recommend it.",1199923200,8,300,4.574074074074074
8070049,5,B0009XZITG,"Another reviewer seems to be looking for a quick fix which DIR/Floortime is anything but. DIR/Floortime is subtle yet very effective for many higher functioning ASD children. It takes quite a while to learn DIR/Floortime through observing professionals doing it. These DVDs help broaden training, but they are by no means a replacement for direct observation. I don't think they even intended these for a replacement. These comments come from my personal experience observing several hundred hours of Floortime and ABA instruction given to my child by instructors with an average of 20 years of experience.  If used properly, these DVDs are rather good.  The production quality is NOT good, though.  No Academy's here.",1196035200,8,718,5.280701754385965
8070050,1,B0009XZITG,"This 'training' series did not fit my learning style at all.  Actually, Im not sure how they can even call it training.  I thought different methods/strategies would be  taught and then examples would be given so I would be knowledgeable enough to apply floortime therapy at home.  Instead, the introduction on each of the DVDs in this series is the same.  Even the books for the series are exactly the same in the beginning and end.  The only difference is the type of children used in the play examples.  Instead of being trained I feel like Im just watching different parents playing with their kids.  Every once in awhile a suggestion is made to the parents on how to interact differently.  I don't want to watch random parents playing with their children to glean from it whatever I may.  I have never received any sort of training in this manner.  It seems like they didn't want to put much effort into this training series so they just videoed a couple of sessions and copied them to DVD.  Every DVD in this series was a huge disappointment and waste of money.",1169424000,16,1067,4.557894736842106
8070051,3,B0009XZITG,"Greenspan seems to have the sexist view that if you are a stay-at-home mother, you spend your day watching TV and eating bon bons and you have a lot of time on your hands.  His program requires 6-8 20-30 minute Floortime sessions per day, 3 15-minute running, jumping and spinning sessions, and 4-6 play dates a week.

I have a three year old with special needs who goes to six one-hour therapy sessions a week.  Soon his schedule will change to five two-and-a-half hour days of developmental preschool a week plus four one-hour therapy sessions.  I also have a demanding five month old baby.  What am I supposed to do with the baby while I am having eight 30-minute Floortime sessions and three 15-minute running, jumping, and spinning sessions with my three-year old?  Listen to her scream while I ignore her?  Hire a nanny?  This is not feasible for my family.

There are some good points on this DVD for interacting with your special needs child, but after I watched this DVD, I felt depressed because I know I can not implement this program because I have a baby in addition to my special needs child and a household to manage.",1136505600,30,1132,4.592039800995025
