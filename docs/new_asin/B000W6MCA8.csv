""After the huge, lavish spectacles of previous tours, U2 decided to tone things down a bit for Elevation, which accompanied their All That You Can't Leave Behind album. Just as the album marked a return to a simpler more stripped-down sound, the live shows returned to smaller venues and a more intimate show, and from start to finish Elevation provides a welcome reminder of what a great band this is. Recorded in Boston, the show features a healthy mix of new and old songs, which were written over the course of two decades but sound as fresh and relevant as ever. From classics like ""Sunday Bloody Sunday,"" ""Where the Streets Have No Name,"" and ""I Will Follow"" right up to instant favorites such as ""Beautiful Day"" and ""Elevation,"" every track is stunningly executed. If you saw the concerts, this is a worthy and lasting souvenir; if you didn't, watch this and you might be kicking yourself.""",1287273600,,908,4.789808917197452
